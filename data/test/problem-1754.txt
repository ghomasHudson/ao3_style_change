Draco looked down at his daughter, prouder than he’d believed it was possible to be, and had known in his heart that he couldn’t be parted from her. His
Pans might even be right with that. When I saw Kayden last week, I had to spit out his spunk. Not that he was bothered by that, but what in Hecate’s name is wrong with me? I swallowed him a thousand times!
getting hurt. Draco laughs at my fussing. He says that he can look after himself, but I think he enjoys having somebody to talk to about his life.
And so, Draco did. He loved sex, and he was good at it. Draco was free with his body. He had adventurous sex with whomever he fancied. Sometimes Draco let other people watch. Sometimes he performed for his lovers and indulged their kinks. When Draco topped, he was generous and patient with his paramours. When Draco bottomed, he made sure his boyfriends had a brilliant time.
It was late on a Monday afternoon, and Draco was at the Prophet offices and hastily typing up an article about a case he’d watched conclude earlier that day.
Nothing seemed to help, and I was keen to call Bartsch – after all, he did say to contact him if anything unusual occurred – but Draco wasn’t having it. “I haven’t felt a contraction,” he grumbled, when I offered to Firecall. “I’m going to have an early night. Let’s see if the fidgety plum lets me have more than a few hours of rest. I swear to Merlin, it’s a good job that I’ve actually seen a picture of our baby. I’d be more likely to believe I was carrying a rogue bloody Bludger instead.”
Malfoy holds his breath for a second, his lips sucked in. After expelling the air noisily, he makes a flippant gesture with his hands. “I just . . . I’d rather . . . Forget about it, I’m being ridiculous.”
The problem was not necessarily that he didn’t want to hear the details, but I swear: if I keep talking to Potter about sex, my raging boner is likely going to kill me. I’m not sure whether that can be pregnancy-related or not, but my libido is on Fiendfyre. And Harry doing all these nice things for me is NOT helping.
Harry closes the door behind him with a thud, and Draco turns around at the sound, smiling and taking a sip from a tumbler in his hand. His face is shadowed, caught between the faint light of a delicate chain of fairy lights on their balcony and the thick darkness behind him. On his way to his husband, Harry grabs a knitted blanket from the settee, eyes on Draco who turns to lean back against the balustrade instead, seeing Harry instead of looking out into the night. Harry steps onto the balcony, into the cold air, and he wraps the blanket around Draco, only clad in a thin, long-sleeved shirt and pyjama bottoms. To his surprise, Harry feels Warming Charms radiating from Draco, and he feels unsure of why he thought Draco would freeze himself to death out here.
That, dear diary, was how Draco – carrying a baby that I couldn’t begin to tell him was mine – came to be my housemate. He tried to insist that I let him sleep on the settee, but I wasn’t having any of that. I set him up in the biggest, most luxurious bedroom in the house – Mrs Black’s old room – and told him that anything of mine was his too. Draco seemed a little dazed by it all, but like I said to him, I don't sleep in there anyway. I prefer Sirius’s old room, with his Muggle pictures still charmed to the wall.
I cut in, not wanting another second to pass before Draco got the help he needed. “The plum- Draco’s baby… They’re mine. I’m their father, I mean.” I paused. The words were out in the open now and couldn’t be
Two artfully cut curls of cucumber swirl into existence within the glasses. Draco sits up to hand Harry one of the glasses; cold, sleek texture under his fingertips, the sound of ice tinkling against glass, green against colourless ice. Harry ravels in the sensation of it all before clinking glasses with Draco. It’s been quite some time since Harry celebrated a drink like he does at this moment, taking a small sip that sends a wash of herbs and flowery flavours over his tongue,  tuned down attractively by the cucumber.
Harry blinks while his mind is busy catching up. He reaches for his wand under his pillow, only to grapple into soft, freshly laundered sheets and firm, ergonomic mattress.
a jar of lube from the same drawer he’d gotten the Firewhisky from. “Don’t worry, Malfoy. I’ll make sure you have a great time.”
“These are the messengers of Donn,” Draco whispers when three ghosts on ethereal horses that look a lot like Thestrals gallop up the hill and circle the fire. “I mean, not really—they are
Well, but what he did was get up, go to his nightstand, and frown into the top drawer for a moment. He came back with a picture that showed me, aged six or seven, on one of his horses with a cheeky smile, looking into the camera. “Draco,” he explained again, looking just as proud as my child-self in the picture. He looked so fond. He looked fonder and kinder than I’ve ever seen him look at me.
The last call I made was to Narcissa, who had demanded, quite rightly, that she be told the very moment that there was any news. Naturally, she was worried, but even through the Floo flames I could see how very glittery and excited her eyes were. She’ll be a wonderful grandma; I had no doubts about that. Since her release from Dartmore she had been a very different, much more laid-back person than the uptight aristocrat that I knew in my youth. “Can I do anything?” she asked. “Come to St Mungo’s or-“
All Draco wanted was a few weeks of quiet and calm. He was really showing now, and even simple day-to-day tasks were uncomfortable and difficult. Half his life was spent trudging to the loo, and the other half was spent sleeping. The miracle of new life wasn’t anywhere as romantic as
Draco’s smile grows bigger and somehow sadder. He crosses his arms in front of his chest, swirling the liquid that gleams like amber where the light catches the thick bottom of the glass. “You left.” A small pause. “And I drink.”
It doesn’t take a week until Harry feels himself drawn back to Lacock. He goes on a Sunday, hoping that Draco wouldn’t be working then. The week has been exceedingly exhausting, and Harry feels more than just a little disconnected from everything around him. He’s annoyed that he had to play hero again and save the bloke’s life, annoyed that his dreams pop up inside his mind all the time, and he’s also annoyed at the fact that he didn’t fuck Draco when he had the chance.
There’s a small mirthless smile. “Ever been married? That’s the perfect definition of being married, Potter.” They both laugh a little; Harry chances a glance at Malfoy’s hands. Two rings adorn his fingers, but Harry has no idea whether one of them looks like a wedding band. He’s not even sure whether he could tell a wedding band from any other ring.
Draco hesitates. He’s always worried about Wards. A relic of both his time with Voldemort and the time shortly after his return to England. Harry says, “Of course,” squeezing Draco’s shoulder as he pushes himself up. There is nothing Harry quite understands so viscerally as the urgency of love. “Let me adjust everything. They’ll have to Apparate right outside the atelier though.”
Had it been any other circumstance under the sun, Draco would have taken his wand and aimed a sweet Jelly-Legs Jinx in Theo’s direction for talking such utter tripe. Unfortunately, Draco couldn’t do a single thing because at that precise moment the Floo bells chimed and Harry tumbled out of Pansy’s fireplace.
Harry accompanied Draco on his first visit to the Wizard’s Health Clinic at St Mungo’s. It felt bizarre, felt otherworldly, to be sat in the waiting room amongst all the happy doting couples, and see them smiling, all of them glowing with health and ecstatic about their futures.
Harry squirmed and shuddered underneath me as I talked to him, voice low and needy. His hands were at my hips, a pleading pressure for me to act upon my words, and I had no intentions of leaving him in the lurch. I squeezed some more lube on his penis, blindly smeared some on mine as well. Then I sank down on his cock, pleased that I managed to guide him inside of me rather expertly.
, Harry wants to argue, but as the words are on his mind, on his tongue, he feels like that’s the whole point. He takes Draco’s face between his palms to make them look at each other, and he finds agitated despair in the other’s eyes. Harry feels calm and, for once in his life, certain when he says, “I can’t promise you that I’ll never feel the urge to run from my life again. But I’m tired of it, tired of making the same mistake over and over again by running away because I feel ashamed or like I’m not enough. But these doubts, Draco . . . they only lurk in when we’re apart.”
been Draco. Images force themselves upon his mind. Of the Weasleys, of Andromeda. Of Ron and Hermione even. All of them patient and understanding and loving because, found family or not, it’s what they have to do. Love him they do. That’s what they’ve proven their whole lives and especially when Harry reentered said lives. They accept him being broken, being with Draco Malfoy, being unable to lead that life that his generation calls
Diet is going okay. I eat a plum and an apple every day, those don’t make me feel sick. I found out that I eat rice very well, so I had a lot of rice and beans lately. Also, I ate some fish just yesterday without even feeling queasy.
Harry stands there, back to Draco, his wild hair loosely bound in a low bun. Ceramic is placed on wood, and the kettle will whistle any moment. Harry’s thoughts are calm, and for the first time since Draco has Sight, the first time since this thing between him and Harry had started over a case, they had both been drawn into, Draco considers Harry’s calmness to be naught but a pretence. Repressed thoughts and memories simmering below the surface of a soldier who’d suffered through a childhood of neglect and active abuse, torn between the desire to be noticed and the fear of being noticed.
After a shower, he stumbles over the bathmat. His clothes must be by the bedside, but he didn’t think as far as to bring any with him. The prospect of water running down his skin at body heat was just too tempting for any delay. When he grabs a white towel, the logo of the luxury hotel embroidered into the cottony fabric, the door opens, and he comes face to face with someone who looks every bit as dead as he feels.
During their restorations and mending furniture in the Manor, they listened to Muggle records in the small, cosy parlour whenever they took a break or called it a day. They made themselves at home in the drawing room that has a Floo connection to Draco’s new atelier on the edge of the Manor grounds. It's in a building that used to be a gatehouse.
I told him how good he felt. “Like I’m meant to take your prick,” I said, getting so much into that feeling of that glorious prickle I felt while sliding up and down his length.
There wasn’t a way to phrase my question politely, so I sat there in dumb silence. Teddy filled it, showing Draco a picture of Quidditch players on their brooms that he had drawn. With a flick of his wand Draco had them flying all over the page and Teddy whooped withdelight.
“Oh, it is. We tried some other stuff as well, but the side effects are sometimes just . . .” He shudders. “I felt in control of the shrooms if you know what I mean. Didn’t think of any of those nifty charms you seem to use.”
“For a while?” Harry prompts, playful, tugging at Draco and half-heaving him off the mattress until he’s half-lying on top of Harry and the both of them giggle like love-drunk idiots.
Harry considers asking whether he could read it—sometimes Tarquin shares his poetry with him, but more often he rereads his writing when he's down from his trip and he tears everything apart, burning the scraps to ashes afterwards—but Harry finds that he isn't in the mood for reading a cryptic succession of words that may or may not bear sensical meaning if strung together.
Merlin, but Draco needed some small respite. Fitzgerald had taken up residence in his consciousness like a particularly ugly toad and there was no shifting him.
Fitzgerald didn’t answer. Instead, he leant into a drawer, and pulled out a half-full bottle of Ogden’s.
, Harry wants to know, and almost simultaneously, the question of his dad’s whereabouts brands itself into the forefront of his mind. Harry swallows and clears his throat thoroughly before he speaks, trying not to sound as harsh as before, only half managing. “I’m sorry, I didn’t . . . When?”
” And, “Punching Robards like a Muggle, Potter? I’ve always known you to be oafish brute, but even for you that’s a new low.” It wasn’t until the year that Harry was greeted with a look of disgust and the words, “
Draco decided that he could. Holding onto his anger would only anchor him in the past, and he had too much to live for now. He had Harry, and he had Daisy. He had a full, good life.
As the weeks have passed, and Draco has gotten bigger, we’ve had to be more careful of our positions.
Harry wasn’t lying. The experience of giving his statement wasn’t anywhere near as bad as Draco had feared. Macintosh didn’t pressure him, or trivialise him, and he gave him plenty of time to answer each question.
But it never came. Harry only laughed, a deep rumble of a sound that was far too noisy and far too inelegant to be faked.
“Er- was okay,“ Draco says, most of his attention on a spell he performs. "I’m owling with a new customer, and I’ve got two more- Well, look at this shit,” Draco groans and implies an Exploding Charm with a flippant gesture of his wand at the cooking pot. “This is the lowest quality copper I’ve ever fucking seen in my- Merlin’s tits . . .”
Wrapping Daisy into a soft towel, Draco was leaning in the doorway, watching the two of them with a fond smile on his face.
Arms wrap around Draco, pull him down onto the bed. A dry sob escapes Draco’s mouth as he caresses the outline of Harry’s scrawny frame. “I love you,” Draco says, face buried in the crook of Harry’s neck. “Please, make it stop.”
I can’t, in good conscience, not be suspicious, obviously. But I can’t seem to find the crux of the matter. His looks might be horrid and he is as ugly as sin. Or perhaps he has a wife who could find out, and he hopes that the high amount of money would secure my confidentiality. But whatever it might be, I'll find out tomorrow night. If things go wrong, I’ll have my wand with me anyway.
Still, Draco knew he couldn’t be too careful. He’d left a party with Potter, left it willingly and on his own. Let himself be vulnerable, once again. He was so stupid.
“Fuck,” Harry groans, half from the way Draco’s erection tents his pants beneath Harry’s palm, half from the way his own cock is still frustratingly flaccid in his other hand.
Instead of getting a check-up in St Mungo’s, Draco advises Harry to go to a private Healer who might be expensive but discreet and, contrary to the hospital personnel, less stressed. Before his appointment, Draco only warned Harry that the witch was ludicrously full of herself, but that he needn’t be worried or ashamed because, “
“So, are they playing Muggle songs in wizarding pubs now? Or how come you’re so up to date about music?”
After a polite enough time—a glass of the host’s best scotch and one of his Cubans—Harry is ready to make an exit, feeling numb and queasy. He roams the rooms in search of the guy who punch-kissed him earlier, happy to see that he’s high as a kite. When he pulls him into a corner, their mouths find each other’s again with the same urgency but not quite as teethy as before. Harry hugs him close, saying, “Sorry,” before he Side-Alongs them to his hotel suite, determined to fuck his brains out if the bloke would let him.
But when I see Harry holding the swell of my belly so reverently, when I see his eyes flicker up to mine, hear him come home, smell the dinner he made… And when I think about Regulus’s old bedroom, right across from Harry’s bedroom, and that we’re working on turning it into a nursery at the moment – when I think about it, I can picture us living here. The plum whose sex is still a secret to us, Harry, and I. In my reveries, we are happy, showing the plum how important love and loyalty are. And both fun and manners, knowledge and play, work and leisure. It’s all playing in my mind like a very palpable memory that is yet to happen.
We see each other only with a guard watching us and for such a brief amount of time, but I dare to make a confession. She's much more fun to talk to. I’ll be so happy when she gets out of prison, but part of me dreads that she’ll turn back to the witch I used to know in an instant. Not that I didn’t like her, but it’d be great seeing her just a little more laid-back and all-round less judgemental. I feel a bit like a prat for saying that, but it’s true. She can’t afford to be a person who looks down on everyone but her closest family anymore. She will need to be open-minded and ready for change.
on the table, but I was too upset to even glance at them. Every so often I peered through the door, wondering when I might get news. Green-robed Healers hustled around the floor, their wands in hand, all of them wearing looks of intense focus on their faces. I hoped that Draco was getting fairer treatment, and a more open-minded approach than the last time he and I had visited here.
Draco looks at him, his expression changing from appraising to concerned. He wants to speak, but the whistle of the kettle interrupts him. They don’t sit but stand in the kitchen next to their steaming cups of tea, leaning against the counters.
Afterwards, the two of us have made a tradition of laying together, talking about everything and nothing and just feeling at peace.
“That really isn’t your colour,” Draco managed to joke, though his voice was croaky, and his whole body was trembling with nerves. “Clashes with your eyes.”
I would have said more, but the St Mungo’s porters arrived then with a wheelchair and a Levitating cot. We were transferred up to the side room of the Maternity Ward than had been prepared for Draco and your hospital stay.
Fitzgerald ruffled Draco’s hair before he stood up. “You’re a brilliant fuck, blondie. Seems the rumours are true.” He yawned. “Listen, I hope you don’t mind, but I’m going to grab a shower. The Arrows have some boring-as-shit fan event in Flourish and Blotts tomorrow. You know how it is. I’m contracted to attend. But this has been fun.” He lent over, and pressed a kiss on Draco’s cheek. “I’m up for a repeat session, any time.”
Harry raises his fork to his lips. The smaller the portion the better. Too much, and it’ll coat his mouth, catch on his tongue. Harry will
“Nonsense,” Theo chimed in, giving Pansy the look of love. It was two against one, and Draco winced. “Send that scratchy little monster you call an owl over to Grimmauld and ask Potter to dinner. He can take an hour off to come and say hello to his beloved’s best chums.”
That being said, memories of the night with Fitzgerald didn’t seem to want to shift from his brain. Sometimes he could be doing something innocuous, something
The hug lasted longer than a hug between friends should be allowed to last. Standing there right before the bed, swaying each other a little, and saying all these things… It was meant to end where it ended. We’re two gay men, after all, and it’s the natural thing to happen eventually, I suppose. Considering Harry’s apparent absence of a sex life and my unsatiable randiness that only seems to grow since I’m pregnant, it was inevitable.
, with him if they so dearly wish to act as his substitute parents. And for Hermione to speak her mind instead of acting after some psychology textbook, and for Ron to stop
Maybe it was the effort of Flooing – I’m not sure for how much longer he’ll be allowed to do it – but Draco was exhausted, and his magic almost completely depleted. As always, I followed Draco up the stairs at the allotted time and entered his bedroom. Draco stripped off his jumper, and the two of us lay face to face on top of the sheets. His bump was between us, rounder now, a curve under my palms. Magic thrummed through me, and I could tell that our little plum was ravenous for it.
Christmas, for me, was spent in the kitchen at Four Privet Drive, making sure that everything was exactly as Petunia desired. She and Vernon always liked a couple of glasses of sherry with their dinner, and I knew full well that they’d be fast asleep in front of the telly by the time the Queen made her speech.
The day is bright with pale skies and thin light. The Manor is perfectly symmetrical with trimmed hedges to either side, an imposing iron-wrought fence, and with its white stone walls rising high above the flat land.
conduct for the Muggles of London. I can’t believe that wizards partake of such behaviour.” He shook his head, likely realising that he had gone too far. “I have to ask - and I assure you, Mr Malfoy, this isn’t because of some prurient interest of my own – but do you prostitute yourself because you are addicted to Muggle drugs? You must realise that they are incredibly dangerous to your unborn child, and I do have to warn you: I wouldn’t have the slightest hesitation in telling the Wizengamot if you were addicted to such substances. Wizarding children can’t be allowed to remain in substandard care–“
It was an odd moment. Harry was smiling, eyes trimmed on the plum whom we had seen for the first time only an hour or so ago. I felt overwhelmed with a ton of unfathomable feelings, looking down at my body and seeing Potter’s face, affectionate and vulnerable over my bare skin, over my child. And his magic. I felt it. A soft prickle that streamed over the swell, gently lapping and receding at my sides.
“I don’t know how you dare show your face,” Cormac finished. “You weren’t raped. You’ve been with a million men and that brat’s father could have been any of them. You don't even know how to say no! You’re garbage. Human garbage.”
Draco made an appointment to visit Barnabus Cruff, and he asked him for a transfer of duties. Cruff was remorseful, and sympathetic, but there was only a single role available. Draco was offered a beat covering petty crimes and their sentencing in the Wizengamot courtrooms. It was a tedious, predictable job, and one hardly worthy of his journalistic talent, but Draco snapped off Cruff’s hand without hesitation.
That comment was the first thing that caught me off-guard, and it sort of vindicated my idea that he might be completely inexperienced, both with men as well as with paid sex. Right there and then, I wouldn’t have been surprised if he’d been a virgin.
“I’d rather not if it’s all the same to you,” came Harry’s reply. “Don’t get me wrong, Nott’s a nice chap and all, but too long in his company, and I might have to think about moving to Alaska. I've always wanted to study Polar bears.” He crossed the room before slumping down on the settee beside Draco. “What d'you reckon to my plan?”
Harry thought he would step out on a balcony with a makeshift bench and a makeshift ashtray that’s filled to the brim, but he finds himself on a huge, stone-cold terrace, a vast plateau above the city. Crashing against the railing and seized by the icy metal, Harry draws in his first real breath, too deep and sharp, a bite behind his eyes, a burn in his trachea. When he breathes out, a soft groan escapes his mouth together with the air. It feels so cold that he thinks he should see his exhale in the darkness surrounding him, but his breath just dissolves into the ether.
Harry swallowed hard, his cheeks heating not with embarrassment but instead with arousal. When he got behind the clear glass of the shower, watching Draco’s eyes travel down his body, Harry finally allowed himself to imagine the two of them together, to vividly picture it in his head. Touching Draco and being touched by him in return. He finds that he never dared to think about it too much or too deeply, afraid that he might start longing for things that were out of question.
“Now that’s what I call an offer I cannot refuse.” The blow-job-part was a tad embellished, seeing that they discovered a few days before that Harry was struggling to get it up. He’s had that problem on turkey before, and actually considered checking himself into St Mungo’s just because he dreaded the idea of wasting just one day of his life without sex. Without sex with Draco if he’s being honest. At least that is one of his top priorities at the moment. Take his mind off drugs, find reasons to stay at Draco’s house, have sex with Draco.
Malfoy draws in a breath, then he speaks, rushed and shaky. “So, this belonged to your, er, great-great-
He pays his attentions to Draco’s bollocks, nibbling and licking the soft skin, before he dives deeper and probes a lick below his balls and towards the crease of his arse. Draco inhales noisily. The muscles in his thighs and arse twitch, but his legs fall open as though he can’t decide whether he wants more or wants Harry to stop. But when Harry licks again, Draco mutters, “Fuck, Potter,” sounding desperate, but he angles his hips to give Harry more room to reach his pucker.
That’s a great fantasy, it genuinely is. A fantasy is all it is though. Reality hasn’t worked out like that.
Harry likes a challenge. I’d bet my life that the broom he’ll make (and probably even have finished by Yuletide) will be even better than something he’d had all the time in the world working on. Improvising and a certain amount of time pressure gets this man to achieve the impossible.
“I will ride you, Potter,” I told him. “I want you to fuck into me like you own me. And I will love every inch of you filling me up.”
we're understanding the other on a deeper level than we actually are. Not because we like each other.” Harry feels like punching him. Draco has at least the decorum to reel, adding an uncertain, “Do we? Because if you only-”
After that moment, Harry, for the first time, touched Draco’s penis. His hand was led there by Draco, and his boyfriend made a small, happy noise when skin connected with skin. Draco was rock hard, both of them were, and Harry couldn’t stop watching Draco’s rosy-coloured cock slipped in and out of his fist. He’s seen Draco naked several times before, but his gaze had never held anything sexual, not even when Harry had craned his neck only to see what Draco looked like down there.
Also, Harry wasn’t mad at me for having read his diary, not one bit. I tried to tell him everything I was feeling about his words, about my own fears, and about us as truthfully as I could. Now, I feel closer to him than ever before. It’s like we’d overcome something that day, something that had been like a wall between us before that kept us from understanding each other completely.
I wonder what he’s like for a shag. Perhaps some of the good-guy-act is naught but a masquerade? Potter must have some sexual urges, surely?
I worried my bottom lip because I still haven’t made up my mind entirely. “It has some pros and cons,” I said. “It doesn’t require much actual time that I spend working, I can plan my meetings quite freely. What do you think? Would you be jealous?”
But he’s here to have a fun, easy day, and sex would be the cherry on top of that. He won’t make this complicated and he won’t mess it up this time. And if Draco will judge him for anything stupid Harry might have said or laugh about his idea to come back in his life, Harry can just leave and never think of him again.
It’s a matter of minutes before they sit on a step together, their backs against either side of the wall with cum-stained trousers crumpled in their knees, both of them gulping for breath and smiling, satisfied.
The rooms they visit look as if they have been magicked as though from historical paintings. Even for the more traditional wizarding homes, the Manor looks like a museum, one that harbours antique after antique. There are studies that showcase magical artefacts, paintings of distant ancestors, and every sort of convenience one can imagine. Harry can’t help but wonder how the faded rooms must have looked like during Draco’s childhood.
After catching his breath, he looks at Draco who looks back at him, calm and very much expressionless.
With a yawn, Draco turned onto his side and buried his head into the pillow. The first thing he’d do when he awoke was quaff the opalescent hangover potion that he’d placed on his bedside cabinet. After that he’d write to Harry and give him Pansy’s address and the time that he needed to arrive.
According to that thick textbook he brought from Flourish and Blotts, wizard pregnancies can be very arduous, both on the baby and on the father too. Their bodies aren’t designed for it, which is why it is such a rare condition. Listen to this: only the most powerful wizards are able to conceive and carry to full term. For two men to create a new life, the magic of both parties must first be equally potent, and second their magical characteristics must coordinate.
They each leant against the sides of the shower’s small confines; Draco against the closed door, Harry against the tiles.
“You have indeed.” My eyes are glued on the potion. I feel excitement bubble to the surface inside of me. Our discussion—it’s nothing but the foreplay. I’m aware that my decision has been made as soon as Harry showed the potion to me. I try to understand why, try to analyse my craving for validation because, as far as I’m concerned, my life in ten years’ time, as will be foretold by this potion, will look hardly any different from what it is now. A life waltzing in between cultural events with my husband, slot in the politely occasional Ministry function—we’ve had enough politics for a lifetime—friends, and a slice of family, but only well-measured, and
Listen to me. I’m rambling, aren’t I? Not making even an ounce of sense. I’m trying to get my thoughts out on paper, trying to untangle the knot of issues that have snarled inside of me.
I was rooted to the spot and there was an odd pressure behind my breastbone. His pictures were explicit, and I clicked through them, scarcely able to comprehend what I was seeing. If I hadn't known better, I’d have believed myself
I had spent the whole day wondering what that bloke might request from me, but slowly it dawned in me that he probably wanted exactly what I had called it before. A date. A nice date where we would enjoy ourselves, and that would without any doubt lead to sex.
“Er- I just-“ Harry gestures around, unsure whether to take off the glamour already or rather turn on his heels and leave. His breath and heartbeat can’t seem to work properly, and he feels his palms get clammy.
“Otherworldly,” Tarquin concludes with Harry agreeing along, trying to phrase what listening to the band felt like, consumed by this crowd of black shirts and veils of swaying thatches.
When he came into the drawing room, Draco and Daisy were on the crème-coloured carpet in front of a low bookshelf that held mostly children’s books on it. Draco sat cross-legged on the ground; Daisy was holding herself up at the shelf, taking out one book after another and inspecting them. Last month had been Daisy’s first birthday, which they had celebrated together as a family, just the three of them with Teddy and Andi, at one of the first serene days they’d had this year. Warm enough to sit in the garden and enjoy tea and some cake.
The Mediwizard asked Draco whether he’d like to find out if the bump was a boy or a girl, during the ultrasound spell, but he shook his head.
I’m supposed to be brave and impetuous, supposed to be the perfect Gryffindor who gallops through life without a care in the world.
He stands and descends two sets of staircases, finding Draco in his workshop. He looks up when Harry stands there on the threshold.
We discussed everything via the internet as per usual, and I asked for kinks and special wishes. But he seemed to have not a single clue about the usual costs and customs of such a meet-up. He didn’t ask for anything odd but offered to pay for the hotel room as if that wasn’t clear from the start. The oddest thing is that he wants dinner first. I shall dearly hope he doesn’t mean McDonald’s or anything entirely too Muggle. But a man willing to spend 5.000 pounds for one night with me will hopefully have at least a modicum of taste.
Harry turned in his seat to face him. “Draco?” Harry asked, his face a picture of puzzlement, “what are you doing?”
“Come,” Harry says, dragging Draco along. They get onto the settee, and Harry spells the Wireless to play at a low volume. Their kiss is accompanied by some of Draco’s favourite Muggle tunes.
I’d fallen so hard for Draco, and the baby we’d made, and the life that we’d built in Grimmauld Place that I hadn’t dared to pause, hadn’t even dared to take a breath.
Shamefully, I’ve avoided Draco since the night we shared in the Muggle hotel. Nothing horrible, or obvious – just skipping out on a few of the pints we’d normally share with Hermione, Ron and the rest of our gang. I’ve claimed I’ve been doing unavoidable extra hours at work, and with the Christmas rush almost upon Diagon Alley, my lie is only a hair's breadth from the truth.
a victim. All I needed was somebody to believe me and to listen to me, and Harry did both.” Draco paused, gathering his thoughts. He wasn’t interested in recriminations or making Pansy feel guilty. “I’m not saying that to make you feel bad. I just don’t want to live in the past, Pans. I’ve got Daisy to think about now. I don't want her to know anything except love.”
Harry feels his heart rate doubling over and his hands trembling, but he doesn’t dare say anything negative because Draco looks so happy every time he talks about Teddy. Harry can’t abide the idea of tainting that happiness with anything he would say only because he’s feeling so estranged.
Draco paled. He ought, really, to have expected this. Pansy would like a Crup with a blasted bone. Usually, it was the thing he loved most about her. Definitely not today though.
I fucked my friend and paid him handsomely for the privilege of doing so. I don’t regret the sex, but I regret the emotions that the sex has released within me. I'm jealous of James Evans. I hate him.
“I don’t need anything more than we already do to be happy and to be completely besotted with you, Draco.”
, and she prescribes a few vitamins and potions against his lack of concentration, and some herb-based pills against nausea and the still occasionally occurring erectile dysfunction. But if her mood is all that Harry has to deal with in order to receive not one odd glance or remark for being
Draco stalked off to his bedroom, and I sat in the lounge, feeling incapable and useless. I want that. I want to be joined at the hip to Draco and never be apart from him or our little plum, not for the rest of my days.
Draco looks at Potter who looks at the ground, face seeming indifferent, mind concentrated on the tip of his boot. Draco hates it when he does that.
Draco watched Harry go, staring at the spot in the middle of his lounge where Potter had stood. He watched the last vestiges of his magic vanish, and he thought about what Harry had said. How he needed a friend, and how it didn’t matter what other people thought. How his life wasn’t ruined.
I will get this tension out of my shoulders, do some Occlumency to free my mind. Then I will unlock the door and call Potter in to infuse me with some of his magic because I feel queasy again now.
time rather than what I saw in the place growing up there. Everything is just tainted.” He looks agitated and restless while he talks, but there’s an air of relief about the way his shoulders are set.
Draco spoke to me today though. He spoke to me half an hour ago. Draco shouted, and he screamed, and he threw the food that I’d prepared for him and left beneath a stasis spell. I’ve tomato sauce congealed in my hair and tears are tracking down my face.
That was when Draco really lost his temper. He stood up and seized the plate of pasta that had been sitting waiting for his return and dashed it against the wall beside him. The crockery smashed into a dozen pieces and a dark red smear stained the wallpaper.
Andromeda and Teddy will also join them at the Burrow for brunch. They didn't for Christmas. Apparently, Molly and Andromeda had been in some sort of row that outlasted the Adventseason, and Harry did not, under any circumstances, want to get involved in it, so he didn’t ask. But Andromeda mentioned only last week that she’s invited to come and how she and Molly had been planting flowers in her garden. Whatever the feud had been about, the two witches seem to be best friends again. Andromeda announced that she will bring a certain infamous cake, and her mentioning that made Draco whistle appreciatively. Some of the ingredients are rare and hard to source, he explained later to Harry. “
, so much music, and art galleries, and restaurants, and days in bed or on the settee in the red parlour. Me playing the pianoforte under Harry’s appreciative gazes, and Harry reading achingly beautiful literature to me in the warm timbre of his lovely voice.
Inwardly, Draco cursed himself. He’d let himself get caught so easily. It was as if time had slowed down to a trickle. He was an idiot, and he deserved everything he got.
I’ll suggest to Potter that we both try to change that. I’ve read that I gave him a new kind of body confidence, one he hadn’t known before, but I’ll do my everything to make him feel wanted and precious. He’s not only needed. He’s not only needed to pay for my stuff, help me tie my shoes and support my magic for our child’s sake. He’s wanted just as much as he is needed.
Harry feels very much in the mood for some live music tonight. He slips into dark trousers and pulls on one of Nick’s band shirts, making fun of Tarquin for pressing his black dress shirt when all they want to do tonight is push each other around in a sweaty crowd of people.
It’s creepy how Harry can’t read Malfoy’s sodding expression. “It’s not like you know me,” Harry points out, starting to feel annoyed. Malfoy just shrugs in response. Harry thinks about a good way to leave, wherever he was, without being completely impolite.
Harry has been outside the wizarding world for long enough to be startled when a gathering of ghosts soar up the hill towards them, and he’s startled enough to frantically shove his hand into his robes for his wand, but Draco stops him from actually drawing it. He rubs his thumb over the inside of Harry’s wrist before he lets go of Harry’s hand again, and Harry feels a bit insecure about the customs of showing their affection in public, wondering whether the wizarding world has a problem with same sex couples because, as far as Harry can remember, he’s never seen any.
Now I know that doesn’t sound very exciting, but Draco had been very circumspect with his body since he went into hospital. Apart from the magic infusion sessions – which we’re still doing – we haven’t been sharing the bathtub, or any of the other dozens of intimacies that used to typify our relationship.
You know, I think there’s something going on between the two of them. I wouldn’t have expected it – the two of them are as different as Kneazles and Crups – but there were definitely a few glances that were shared just a moment too long. Even I noticed it, and I’m normally the most oblivious person in the world. We’ll see, shall we? If you’re reading this, Cassie, and Blaise and Astoria are lovingly bonded, you’ll have heard it here first.
Pansy came to stand beside Draco. “She looks so much like you,” the witch said, looking down at the baby. “I’d like to get to know her, Draco. Can you find it in you to forgive me?”
something to me. Every payment was a gradual step towards regaining some modicum of self-respect and rehabilitation! Making that transfer was no better than swallowing Polyjuice and pretending to be James fucking Evans, Harry! As long as I live, I’ll never be anything more than your rent boy, will I? I’ll never be anything more than a possession to be bought.”
My Mind Healer said much the same thing. I used to see Mike, a St Mungo’s Magi-Psychiatrist in the years after the war, and I made an emergency appointment with him the day after Draco threw the pasta plate at the wall.
I think – I hope – that we are more than that now. We’ve found a rhythm, these last few weeks, Draco and I. Found an easy existence that suits both of us. I cook light, healthy foods that Draco seems to enjoy, and he lets me watch the awful Muggle footie that he complains about so much. Sometimes we talk, and sometimes we sit quietly, reading and passing the time.
Harry found his own hand wandering down to his prick where he cupped his balls and gave himself a tug. Draco looked so flooded with satisfaction that he almost couldn’t stand the idea to have him tasked with anything other than enjoying his afterglow. But without waiting for an answer, Draco heaved himself up and dived down to Harry’s crotch.
Draco looked around in wonder and Harry grinned. The Chimaera’s Den was everything his boyfriend had wanted and more besides. “It’s so beautiful,” Draco said, taking Harry’s hand across the table. I’ve no idea how you managed to get the pair of us in, but you did Harry. It’s true what they say about you, love. You really are magic.”
, there’s nothing in this world he wishes for more deeply right now. Nothing. He won’t want to win this drawn-out court fight for the Manor, he won’t want his probation to end early, and, by Hecate, he doesn’t even care if Father will ever be released or if Mother will ever speak again if it only means for Harry to feel better.
With that last sentence, Draco seemed to have exhausted himself completely. His body sagged, and his eyes closed. I had a moment of pure, no-holds-barred alarm, but I felt my lover’s pulse. It was there, though it seemed to flutter under my fingertips. There was nothing for it. I wrapped Draco in the quilt from the bed and picked him up. We Apparated to St Mungo’s and from there on, everything was tumultuous and frightening.
I haven’t showered yet and part of me can still smell Draco’s spunk, smell the sweet lemony scent of his shampoo. The sound of his posh Wiltshire accent, the vowels softened by years living in London still ring in my ears. I can still feel the soft pads of his fingers as they caressed my skin.
Draco sighs, sounding exhausted. “Very rarely it’s a tad uncomfortable when the nipple gets hard. But . . . It basically never hurts, no.”
” Malfoy spit out Harry’s name like an insult, eyes twisted with hatred that, Harry now understands, was never directed at him. With a stuck-up nose and appraising eyes, voice as caustic as bile, Malfoy drawled, “
But in the end, I insisted on reading passages to him that I wanted him to hear, and I ended up reading half my journal to him. I told him about the storage room Mother had rented for her stuff and that it harboured more journals from my youth. “One day I will show you just how far back my infatuation with you reaches,” I told him jokingly, and Harry seemed to love the idea to hear about a pubescent version of myself, drawn between pretending to be straight, hating and loving stupid Potter.
When Harry seals his lips around Draco’s length, sucking at the velvety skin before he starts moving his head, Draco hardly moves or says anything, but he sucks in his lips, eyes glued on Harry. His cock is long and lean, his balls feel tight in Harry’s hands when he rubs his palms over Draco’s whole package. Harry brings his head up when he needs to take a breath and discard his spectacles.
When I got him out of his pants, I told him that he was huge. Because he was at least seven inches. Good thing, I’m in practice, I suppose.
The bloke, James, was the same height as me. He approached me with a lopsided smile and looked simultaneously nervous and pleased to see me there in the hotel lobby. And rightly so, because I looked fucking fantastic. Seeing that he found me over my profile where I do have quite some pictures of my enticing self in suits (well, or in the nude), I wore one of my more casual ones. Anything else would have been completely over the top in that hotel. Salazar, that sounds like it was one of the usual dumps I take men for a hook-up, which it really wasn’t. It was a very decent 4 Star Hotel. But thank Salazar, I do still have so many of my tailored clothes which mostly still fit. Merlin, but I digress.
“We shouldn’t let the night end like that,” Harry finds himself suggesting. “I mean- Let’s find someone who'll sell us a few more pills or some mephedrone. Let’s go home and . . .”
Abortions weren’t as straightforward for wizards as they were for witches, and Draco knew that he’d have had to be unconscious throughout the procedure. The idea of being handled – of being
“Alright,” I agreed, stepping closer so there wasn’t even a millimeter of space between the two of us. I hardly needed any convincing. Draco planted his feet carefully on the wet floor and held onto the soap tray so that he wouldn’t topple over. My hold on his hips became a touch greedier as he parted his thighs for my thick cock to enter. I thrusted slowly and carefully, trying my best not to jolt Draco or upset his balance.
I told Harry about that later, and he told me that he’s always been in awe at the way that we Malfoy’s take care of one another. It made me think about times in my life in which I found it rather infuriating to have my parents doting over me without seeming much interested in MY interests. Good grades, good health, good reputation. That was all that ever mattered. Being twenty-five, I hardly feel all that adult, but I realise how I’m copying all that. I feel like half of me has vanished ever since I found out I’m pregnant because-
The moment Draco appeared in Pansy’s lounge, he realised with abject horror that he wasn’t the only person who’d pulled out all the stops for Harry Potter.
Fitzgerald had ruined his life. He’d smashed it to smithereens. Everything reminded him of his rape, and he wore it like a shroud. His senses were traitorous. Smells catapulted him backwards through time. Sounds made him sick. Noises left him reeling. There had been a before and there had been an after and, try as he might, Draco couldn’t return to the person that he’d been before.
“I’d think that you give yourself quite enough of that. I’d rather remind you of all the world-saving you’ve done.”
Despite himself, Harry felt his cheeks heat and he nodded his head in agreement. “All I mean to say is that I’ll need some preparation.”
“Oh, right.” A few flashes of memories of that night flash back to him, all of which definitely place Lucius in the deadly peril category.
"I keep you away from your work sometimes," Harry says. Draco makes a dismissive gesture, but Harry feels indignant. “I mean it, Draco. Not only tonight—tonight is different. But on other days as well.”
His hands probed lower, and he squeezed the bulge in my trousers, looking up as though he was waiting for my consent. I answered by undoing my fly and shoving my clothes down.
Diary, I was immediately terrified.  My brain jumped immediately to the worst-case scenario. “The baby,” I spluttered, feeling a little like my legs were going to give out underneath me. “They’re- they’re…” I couldn’t finish my sentence because I didn’t want to hear the answer.
“I don’t think it matters what other people think,” Harry answered, matter of fact. “It’s your body, and it’s your baby. You’ve still got four months to make a decision about what you want your future to look like.”
Draco tried to sit up, but he found that he couldn’t. Fitzgerald’s weight was on top of him, and he couldn’t move.
Darling, I don’t care what you do with your life. You can be a Quidditch player, or you can make potions. You can bake cakes or raise Hippogriffs. As long as you’re happy, that’s all that matters. Happiness is everything, and I’ll make sure you have an easier life than Draco and I did. I suppose this is an apology too – I’m getting in early here, Cassie! – I don’t have a dad, so I’m not wholly sure how to do this fatherhood thing. I’m going to have to make it up as I go along.
When I felt that I was getting closer, my prick in my hand, I told him to go harder. I wanted a bit of that fantasy I’ve sometimes wanked off to. Potter, mercilessly pounding away at me in various positions, having his way with me just as he pleases.
Don’t know what to say. He paid everything, all of the remaining 9k. Here I was, happy that despite having cancelled all remaining dates after my breakdown, that I’ve been able to scrape up the necessary 82 Galleons for this month.
He only lived ten minutes away, and he laughed loudly when he answered the Firecall. “Looks like I’ve won three Galleons from Asti,” Blaise said,
I felt his nervousness. Harry was scared that I’d shove him away or tell him to stop. I’ve actually never seen him like this before. He's been different these past weeks. Always careful what he says, where he looks, where he places his hands. I feel like I’m torturing him by giving him the cold shoulder (the silence treatment in the first fortnight was possibly the shakiest, saddest I’ve ever seen Potter).
There isn’t much to say after that, my little love. Your other daddy couldn’t tear his eyes from you, and he confessed that he’d never been as proud of himself in his life as he was then. “She’s perfect,” he whispered to me, as soon as the Healers and the Mediwix were out of the way. “We’ve made a perfect baby, Harry.”
Never, ever in my life have I known lovemaking like I shared with Draco last night. I don’t suppose that I’ll ever know where he ended and Drake began. Sex is, of course, his profession, and I’ve no doubt there’s an art to making a man feel like they’re akin to Casanova. Still, there was a moment when the pair of us were fucking for the third and final time, slow and sensuous, and we came together and I felt, for the slightest sliver of a second, like we became a single person.
But it should be over, all of it. He just had to die, didn’t he? How is it possible that he can’t even-
The characters in Draco’s film performed their tragic tale but Draco was no longer interested in watching them. “But you came here instead?” he asked, his eyes flicking across to the other wizard. Harry was sitting very close and there was barely an inch between the two of them. “I wish you hadn't, Harry. Our fake date is finished, and I meant everything I said. I don’t want to lie anymore.”
A dry sob escapes Harry’s mouth. With a start, he presses his lips shut, and straightens slightly, concentrating on drawing in even, calming breaths.
“Gods, please,” Draco replied, unable to hide how keen he was. Harry grinned and leant in to capture his lips once again.
Draco raised his head and gave me a scathing glace. If looks could kill, then I’d have been six feet beneath the soil.
The two of us made our way to the Italian restaurant where I’d booked a table for the two of us. I don’t know whether this was the done thing, but I don’t regret it. Truth is, I’m likely a naive idiot, but I didn’t want Draco to think badly of James Evans. I didn’t want him to believe the man was little more than a randy oaf, concerned only with Draco’s lithe limbs and perfect pucker.
Pansy, of course, swooned and fell head over heels for Harry’s charms the moment that he complimented her about the new house. That Harry had followed it up with compliments about the food and her taste in fashion had only magicked the matter closed. Theo was altogether easier to win over. A few sentences worth of gossip about the Quidditch league, and the incapability of the Ministry of Magical Games and Sports to harness transfer fees, and the two wizards were as thick as thieves.
When he arrived, I was just finishing up on one of our MoonStar models, and though I waited for him to make his usual joke about giving my ‘shaft a good polish’ it never came. Perhaps Draco was hungry. He must have been. While the wizard was sitting at my drawing desk, he managed to consume most of a packet of Muggle biscuits, an act which is entirely out of character. He had always professed to not having a single sweet tooth in his head.
In fear of starting an argument that would only lead to Draco being quiet and too-agreeable for the remainder of the night, Harry tries to get away with silence. Draco downs his drink, eyes fixated unseeingly somewhere behind Harry.
Even so, Draco still wasn’t sure. The idea of handing the bump over, of leaving St Mungo’s without them, made his heart pound and his skin clammy. The idea of the bump not being
Draco cast a cleaning and drying spell over me, and I felt my skin goosepimple as I felt his magic wash all over me. Bloody hell, but it felt so good, all warm, tingly and intimate. Magic dried the starchy cloth of my jeans, and the fabric of my boxer shorts beneath them.
. At his job. And he’s into all these Muggle things. Like art and music. And cooking! Can you imagine? And he does some of the gardening by hand because he insists that the plants appreciate it more than wand-waving.”
“No need to apologise,” Draco says, sounding just as composed as he looks. “Do you need some water? Can I do anything?”
Harry thinks about that. “S’pose you’re right; I’m prouder than I try to let on. Neither were you though.”
“No,” Harry answered. “That’s wrong. Nobody can ask to be attacked, Draco. It doesn’t matter if she’d consented a thousand times before. It doesn’t matter if she were drunk. It doesn't matter if she was clothed or naked, chaste or experienced. The circumstances don’t matter. Nobody is owed sex, and if this girl changed her mind, then she had the right to be listened to! She had the right to be heard! If this footballer ignored her, then he committed a crime. If a person withdraws their consent from sex, then that is rape.”
“So you don’t get angry with me because I—what?—saved your life? Testified for you at your Wizengamot trial? Do you think you’re not allowed to get mad at me?”
The crystal chandelier is dangling from the ceiling. Draco points out how poorly his mum has repaired it, and when Harry looks only closely enough, he finds glassy fragments scattered all over the marble tiled floor and the huge reddish Persian rugs, reflecting the orange light in all the colours of the rainbow as though not even a week had passed after the incident with the Snatchers. The elves were instructed not to go in here, and Draco has never entered after he left the Manor the day of the final battle.
“I can do one better than that,” Draco answered, leaning back in the chair with a lazy smile on his face, and amusement evident in his expression. “What about dinner and a pint? You’ve had as much presence as a man made of smoke these last few weeks, and I’ve missed your face terribly, Potter! My hectic social life has gifted me a free night on Monday. Shall we make a night of it?”
The creek of the small gate barely manages to cut through the rush of his blood, buzzing in Harry’s ears with nervous excitement. A small set of stairs lead up to the front door. Off to the side, though, a dark-painted door is lettered
They are both giddy with a line of cocaine; Draco gave in when Harry snorted his second one, commenting Harry’s grin with, “It’s you who got me all emotional, Potter.” But aside from that, Draco didn’t bring up that Harry cried or asked any unpleasant questions about reasons or other things. On the coffee table sits the phoenix perch that Harry asked Draco to show him again, and Harry, in incredulous awe, tried to imagine an elderly lady in a Victorian-style furnished room with two phoenixes on that perch.
“She’s . . . My aunt can be a tad headstrong. Thinks that her way is the only one. But that doesn’t stop her from holding those close whom she loves. And you're part of that lucky bunch, Potter.”
beginning diary, though I’m fully aware of how awful Draco must be feeling if James Evans is the other father of his baby.
The Healer coughed discreetly and pulled me out of my reverie. “If you could sit down,” he asked, gesturing to a chair beside the bed, “and lay your hands on Draco’s skin? You don’t need to cast a spell; the baby instinctively feeds from it. Please try not to move around too much. A steady flow of magic is best for everyone.”
“You are,” I answered him. “You’re more than ready. How long have you been up?” I asked, knowing time was of the essence.
“The customs and taxes are low to promote competition,” Percy concedes, sounding outraged. “What the trade agreement is aiming to achieve is a better awareness in wixen who can afford the better, possibly homemade broom to pay the extra Galleon for it.”
Pansy was the first to get tired of Draco’s self-imposed absence from her life. When three of her owls had been ignored, and there had been four weeks of silence, Draco found himself holding an invite to brunch. He was expected at Parkinson Manor the following Sunday.
At least I alleviated my conscience about the money. I thanked him properly only one day after I found out about it, and the topic fortunately hasn't come up since. I still can’t believe that the reparations are paid, never to be thought of again.
I’m okay with that. Whenever this bloke realises that he can have a good few hours of “fooling around” for far less than that, his money will never to be seen again, thrown at the voracious gullet of the Ministry. The bank will be happy, and the one-off might even change my monthly instalment.
Before he makes a conscious decision, Harry wrenches himself free from Draco, gulping in air as though he’s just ducked out of the water of the swimming pool on the rooftop, or of a lake in the Forest of Dean. “Sorry,” he says quickly, realising that he must look like he’s completely mental. He’s shivering and breathing heavily. He braces himself for Draco’s touch, but it doesn’t come.
Draco wasn’t sure whether Harry was right, but he desperately wanted to believe him. Perhaps this would be what the rest of his life would be like. Moment by moment, day by day. He let Harry hold him, and felt the thrum of his powerful magic against his skin. He didn’t feel ensnared in Harry’s arms. For the first time he could remember, Draco felt safe.
Once we were in the way too conservative looking bed and breakfast where the guy was staying on a business trip to London, he seemed calmer, and we even chatted a bit before we got to it which is rare when he only wanted one hour with me. We got into bed soon enough though.
Harry loved the predictable domesticity their small family shared. The hours of the day, the days of the week, all neatly split up into lovely schedules. Draco, Daisy, and he all knew where to be and what to do. Harry liked it that way. Their life was family dinners, and bath time, and Saturdays with Teddy. It was coffee in the mornings, tea in the afternoons. It was finding Draco’s eyes and asking if it was alright to kiss him and it was Draco’s hand being held out for him to take, an invitation to loop his arm around his waist or rest his head on Draco’s shoulder.
Neither of us mentioned it. Perhaps we were both scared that things would come out that neither of us wanted to be out in the open. But I feel so overwhelmed right now. It was a nice night, we had chemistry. After the first few clumsy moments, the sex was great. His prick was the perfect size to make you exactly feel just like it was a little bit too much to take. And yet, I’m nothing but confused and scared now. What will I do if he’ll try to blackmail me? I’m not sure whether I could trust the Aurors to help out a Malfoy in need. That homophobic bunch will most likely laugh at my (not so) honourable occupation. And on top of it all, my sphincter has possibly never felt so sore before.
“Saved me again,” Draco murmured, sounding wistful, looking over towards where Ron was still standing. He’d been joined by Hermione, and Ron had wrapped his arms around his wife's waist. “Look at those two. Love’s young dream. Romance doesn’t come quite as easily for the rest of us, does it?”
Fitzgerald didn’t blow Draco though. He didn't touch him, and he didn’t look in the direction of Draco’s cock. Instead, he let Draco’s arms go free, and pulled off his own trousers and boxer shorts. He was fully erect and his cock stood to attention in front of him. Fitzgerald looked to be enjoying the proceedings very much indeed.
Harry feels calmer. He says, "You're making me feel all these things. And when it gets so much, just like now, I'm afraid of losing that. It'd be so easy to go backwards and feel nothing. It’d be so much easier to reject all that instead of waiting for it to be taken away."
“Yes?” Draco asked and Harry noticed that his boyfriend’s voice was higher than usual. His pupils were wide and his cheeks were flushed.
“Don’t forget to write an owl to Teddy,” Andi says while they are stepping into the night. “Tell him that you’ll be here for Yule—the boy doesn’t like surprises.” She says that as certain as night follows day, as though there's not a single doubt whether Harry will spend the holidays with them or not, and Harry suddenly feels so touched that he thinks he might weep right there while Draco takes his arm to Side-Along them home.
only because you consider me family.” It was a slightly (very) stupid thing to say. But it’s always at the back of my mind when I’m feeling low that, forever after Hogwarts, Harry is only friendly with me because we’re somewhat related through Teddy.
“So,” I say, eyes on the alabaster potion. “I’d have to swallow the whole thing to its very last drop. It’s
“The Ministry took it all,” Draco continued, seeming to want to get the words off his chest. “Every book in the library, every tapestry off the wall. For the first time in my life, I was left with nothing. I struggled on for a bit – made a few Galleons making potions for some dodgy Knockturn apothecaries – but I wasn’t getting anywhere. I was barely keeping my head above water, and like I told you in the Granger-Weasley’s garden, the little money I had I spent on drinking and nightclubs. The sex work… I know how it must seem to a nice chap like you, but it saved my life. Put money in my pocket. The anonymity of it – the freedom to choose my clients and my hours – it was a job I could do and do
Draco shook his head. “Thank you, but no. I won’t feel like it. Just going to come back here, and get my head down. This bloody bump is draining all my energy.”
“Partner makes me think of my time as an Auror,” Harry replies with a shrug. The tension starts thawing from his shoulders when Draco looks at him with mirth in his eyes. With one hand on the table and one behind Harry, Draco looks so open that Harry can’t quite resist leaning in and resting his head on Draco’s shoulder. The way Hermione beams at him doesn’t escape him, and also the way Teddy doesn’t seem to be quite sure if he’s okay with his cousin cuddling his boyfriend or if he’d rather him look away.
Harry took a sip of his six-Galleon wine and rubbed the back of his neck. The jig was up. “I’ve buggered this up, haven’t I?” His mouth was dry, and he couldn’t remember ever feeling so tense. Waiting for his Firebolt during the Triwizard Tournament hadn’t been as nerve-wracking as this was.
Draco said, thinking how awful it’d be if Draco thought the great Harry Potter something special. “You know, I’m just a bloke though. Please, just- don’t bring up this whole Chosen-One-nonsense, okay? It’s part of why I left, and I can’t- I just can’t take it.”
James looked at me for a second, wide-eyed, but after he took a breath and swallowed hard, he recovered and gave a laugh. Something in his whole composure changed then, and I finally had the feeling that the bloke was not here solely to have a little chat over pasta and white wine, but rather to get each other out of our clothes later on. Even though he was charming, he didn’t seem to be in a hurry.
All of a sudden, Draco felt strangely breathless. He liked to be able to move during sex. He loved fondling his partner, and making them feel good. He liked to stroke rib cages and squeeze bottoms. What Draco didn’t love was the feeling of being caught, but that was exactly what he was, as surely as a bug pinned to velvet.
He’d been so alone, and too frightened to face up to what was happening to him. His only recourse had been to try to blank it all out, but that hadn’t helped. He’d pretended so hard that nothing was changing but that hadn’t made a Sickle of difference. He hadn’t dared to reach out to anybody. Draco had buried his head in the sand.
Pansy shook her head and a tear trickled down her cheek. “Because you’re my best friend,” she said, “and it’s your birthday, and that's what we do! We see each other on our birthdays!” Another tear fell, and she sniffed. “And I miss you! Nothing is as exciting without you to talk about it with, and nothing is as funny. I miss you,” she repeated. “And Daisy too. She’s beautiful.”
As though he can read his mind, Draco says, “Sometimes I could imagine moving to the coast. Some picturesque town with a beach like this.” He sounds more sincere than romanticising. Harry can’t help but picture the tranquillity of the nearby small towns, him and Draco amidst it all, familiar with the times to avoid tourists and with the unpredictable weather. It sounds like another life, except that only their surroundings would change.
Seeing Draco look at him like that, eyes full of blatant want for him, for shoving this toy inside of him . . . It’s more than a little arousing. And just when Harry thinks that this might be all he needs to have nice sex, even without getting himself erect, the toy moves rather abruptly and causes Harry to jolt. Draco holds him, one hand at Harry’s arse, the other one, arm buried under Harry’s waist, is on the small of his back.
“I need to tell you two things,” I began. I’ve been playing this through in my mind with a thousand ways of explaining how I got into sex work, each one more circumlocutory than the next, trying to give him good enough reason for what I’m doing. But with his magic tingling over my arms and that warm, attentive expression on his face, I didn’t feel like it needed a lot of explaining.
Leaning over, Draco tried to give Pansy a small swat with the back of his hand. That bloody bint had sworn on her cauldron never to repeat that story to another living soul. Still, he doubted it was fresh news to Nott. Pansy had always had a mouth on her as wide as the Black Lake.
as the horsemen, obviously, who warned Conaire Mór about his impending demise.” Draco goes on telling the tale of a gruesome battle, grinning along as though it’s the most romantic narrative he’s ever heard while they watch the spectral show surrounding the fire.
In the morning Draco looked at Harry’s mess of untidy hair on the pillow beside him, and he’d felt a wave of genuine affection. Draco hadn’t slept over – and just
“Ginny Firecalled Grimmauld Place to warn me,” Harry explained to Draco, watching Cormac leave. “She told me that Cormac had been to dinner with Fitzgerald last night, and that he’d fed him a story. I tried to get here as soon as the words left her mouth, but I was too late. I’m sorry, Draco. I should have been faster.”
According to the few lines of text, Drake was twenty-five, a well-educated country boy, and he took cock like a champion.
When Harry feels the crack of Apparition nearby, he stirs from the photographs, feeling as though he’s been doing something ilicit. He finds Draco in the hallway, almost knocking into the bags that he’s Levitating to the kitchen. “I brought fish and chips,” he says, and when he moves both his wrists, his outer robes slip from his shoulders and dry themselves before scurrying away.
Harry does feel like going out—perhaps not only to a pub, but to go somewhere with Draco where they can dance and eat greasy Muggle food before that—but he agrees. When he mentioned the urge to find some Muggle club together and dance the night away on coke an hour before, Draco wasn’t too keen on the idea because he’d have to work tomorrow. Fair enough.
Merlin, I love Draco so much, and I love the plum, and I love the life we have made together. Everyday has been a revelation. There’s not been a day that has passed by without Jules teasing me for acting like a teenager having his first crush. Every day I remind him that I was far too busy as a teenager to have crushes, so I’m making up for it now. I’ve been buying our food during my dinner hours, and I’ve been Flooing home as soon as five o’clock arrives. I don't want to waste a minute.
Draco was perfectly gentle and patient with him. He lubed up his fingers and massaged Harry’s arse until he couldn’t bear it anymore and begged Draco until he pushed two fingers beyond the tight ring of muscles. It felt familiar and new at the same time, with Draco’s dark-grey eyes trimmed below his bollocks. Harry couldn’t fathom the idea that this person, whom he loved with all his heart would watch and want him like Draco did just then. It was all Harry needed in order to lose the very last vestiges of tension.
“Ah, but you got to read’em, mate,” another bloke says, exhaling smoke and nodding his head knowingly. He wears a beanie, and a stark white collar shows under his coat. His clothes look more expensive than those from the rest of the group, except for that ragged beanie and the earring he’s wearing, a simple black stud. His eyes have an amused twinkle to them, and Harry is fairly certain that he’s taking the piss with the other guy. “When she tells you something like ‘need to get up early’, you should immediately think about what she wants you to do. It’s simple once you got behind it. They say it’s so hard to wrap one’s head around women’s logic, but it’s really not.”
“I frankly have no fucking clue,” Harry replies, amused. He pierces his fork through a few leafy remnants of his salad, shoving them in his mouth together with some bread.
. Everything slotted into place. The small round curve of his belly. His flat refusal to drink alcohol. His constant tiredness and his fickle appetite. Even his furtive purchase of Healer textbooks two weeks ago began to make sense.
Salazar, save me. I sound like he was my boyfriend. I ought to stop living in a dream. Tonight, though, I’ll be adamant to repeat what happened this morning. I’ll come up with a good way of pursuing him. Perhaps I can tell him that it’s like pregnancy cravings, only that not my gums, but my balls are throbbing for sweet pleasure. Fuck, but I hope he’s not regretting it right now.
because I’d be dead for good if it wasn’t for your darned mother . . .” It takes a moment until he manages to breath normally again, internally repeating the question inside his head, trying to make it sound casual when he finally says it. “How is she anyway?”
The panic of his short breath increases with the nauseating belly-pull of the jump when Harry Disapparates.
baby safe and secure. As far as I’m concerned, James Evans was just another punter. Another faceless open wallet.”
What I came into was the bloke holding up a bundle of money. “This,” he said, counting a whole grand, laying the banknotes out on the rumpled sheets. “If you cancel all your plans and stay the night. Morning sex and shower sex if that’s alright with you.”
Harry frowns at that, drawing in a breath in order to protest, but he’s interrupted by a flippant gesture of Draco’s hand. “Don’t get too full of yourself. Every child of our generation was obsessed with the Boy Who Lived at some point. You can’t blame a seven-or-so-year-old me for that. You can’t even feel
A stupid, twee, little part of me even thought that Potter didn’t only like me because of the sex OR the chance at a child with another man. That he likes spending time with me as possibly more than friends. But looks like sex is all it was about from the beginning.
The words, spoken in slightly off unison, swim together as the low murmur bombinates through the night, through Harry’s body. In the middle of the black-hooded wixen, by the fire, stands another wix who wears the skull of a stag and a ramification of gnarly branches like a crown, the antlers rising high above them. Against their dark silhouette, kindled embers float through the air. The wix in the middle is the only one with his wand raised skyward, at the smoke-swirls emanating from the bonfire.
Harry wakes, still feeling all the eyes on him, endless shades of blues and browns and now grey too. Before he does anything else, he takes two morphine in the hopes of napping until they take.
When he sits back up to meet Draco’s gaze, he finds an unguarded look on the man’s face, finds lips slightly parted, eyes watching Harry with disbelieving awe.
Draco’s hips rut up against Harry but, just as frantic, his hand comes up to keep Harry at bay, at least a few inches. “We shouldn’t do it here,” he says, nodding over to the dark painted door that looks out to a rainy day through a small window on top. “As alluring as you look, Potter, I’m not sure our clients are in for a gay sex show.”
There wasn’t anything else for Draco to say. He couldn’t stay here, not with Theo’s worried mouth and Pansy’s red-rimmed eyes. He couldn’t stay there and watch Harry make clumsy apologies and vanish out of his life forever.
In the dark room, the covers pulled up to under his chin, Harry digs through the quilts until he finds the familiar heat of Draco’s body. He is scared to be lying there alone. Draco takes his hand and squeezes the way he sometimes does, firm and lingering as though he’s afraid that Harry might slip away, and Harry totally gets that because gloomy thoughts lurk in the corners of his mind; thoughts that make him feel restless.
A day before his hearing, Tarquin tells Harry, “I don’t deserve you,” and when Harry wants to say that he’d always be there for him, Tarquin interrupts him with a mirthless laugh, saying, “The worst part of it all is that you had to meet my parents. Hope it was only my daddy?” He sounds sad and caustic, and Harry can hardly bear how pale Tarquin looks. For the first time Harry explicitly  thinks that, maybe, he might be in love with him.
As it turned out, Harry’s often restless hands are very able to be still and precise when he only puts his mind to it. The moment the tip of the brush touches the wood, Harry’s fingers go very still and his breathing slows down. He’s enlarged the chair he’s usually sits in for the task so that he can draw up his legs on the seat and hold the little figurine on his knee while he colours the wine-red stripes on the rosy dress the young lady is wearing. She surely would preen if Harry magicked her into life right now; whenever she dances, she makes sure to swirl her dress around like it’s the most precious thing in the world. She is a true model.
For all the lopsided grinning, James was quite shy after we greeted each other. He glimpsed at me, looking very much like he had to muster up all his courage only to say: “You’re very handsome.”
A tingly wave of Draco’s magic streams over his scalp and down his spine, eliciting a groan emanating from deep within his throat. “Sweet Jesus,” he moans, angling his head for Draco to massage his nape. Just a second ago, his erection was straining against jeans, but now Harry feels far too relaxed for the urgency of that. He shifts closer to Draco until he’s in his arms, Draco’s hands a reliable pressure against his skull and shoulders.
First, I was only worried because “James Evans” had no chance of knowing that he was becoming a father without me managing to find him somehow. I didn’t think that would have been fair on anyone, not on him, not on the plum, and not on me. I wasted MONTHS wishing for a non-existent man to have his chance at being a part in the plum’s life, fantasising that he might want to be one of the first persons to hold them, want to watch them sleep in their cot, witness their first words, first steps, first outburst of accidental magic, and so on and so on.
Like a moth to light, Harry is drawn to the hotel suite, to the lobby each night in search for a group with familiar enough faces. But everything started to feel tainted with appreciative eyes on him and too-loud bellowing whenever Saviour Potter is spotted. It was inevitable for his last name to be ruined as well. Harry's blood runs cold on all the sounds that make up his name if spoken by strangers. And truth be told, he is surrounded by nothing but. The people who were fun to watch partying and listen to their thoughtless, self-absorbed vapouring are now the reason why Harry keeps experiencing severe paranoia from his usually pleasantly numb cocaine highs.
Gracious, but Draco couldn’t help but be in love with Harry. It had always been the same. Harry Potter had haunted everyone of Draco’s wet dreams since he was old enough to begin experiencing them. There wasn’t a single aspect of Harry that wasn’t perfect in Draco’s opinion. The other wizard’s hair was an obvious source of fascination. It was wild, and Draco longed to run his fingers through the untameable locks. Harry’s green eyes were the exact shade of a piece of sea glass that Draco had found on the beach as a child, and had kept beside his bed for a token of good luck. Despite the rocky path of their past, Harry was and always had been the unalloyed object of Draco’s desires.
His hobbies all involved healthy, outdoor Muggle things like camping, and bike-riding and jogging, and seemingly, they all had to be completed in a very joyless, non-magical manner. Apparently, it built character. Draco’s cousin, little Teddy Lupin, was always being hauled away on these awful-sounding excursions. There was a long-standing open invite for Draco to join them.
Salazar, but how things will have to change. Already have. I’ve never taken such good care of myself as I do now. Well, actually I’m taking care of another life rather than mine.
The blissfully numb feeling in his cheeks is very suddenly replaced with a dull sort of pain that, just for a moment, feels confined to the soft flesh above his jaw. Until it blooms across the whole side of his face, until his body seems to consist of nothing but the left side of his face.
With a snicker, Carol holds her hand in front of her mouth while she chews and swallows. “And here I was, thinking you were going to say what a smart-mouthed, desirable-looking lady I am.”
“Used to have.” Harry swallows. His mind drifts to cold-grey views across London and a mirage of Tarquin's smile. It seems like a lifetime ago, much like everything else in his mind is before the battle, before his death. “I’ve never thought about suicide,” Harry says, feeling like he needs to point that out. “Not about, well, actually doing it. Just about that it would’ve been easier sometimes to, you know . . . if I hadn’t come back.”
Draco would have liked to have locked the door to St Swithins Crescent and never left again. Never leaving meant he didn’t run the risk of seeing Fitzgerald shopping on Diagon Alley, or drinking in The Leaky Cauldron. Never leaving meant he’d never have to see that self-satisfied smirk ever again.
“I can arrange that, darling,” Draco murmured, and then he kissed Harry, deep and slow, while guiding him back to lie down, head on the soft pillow.
There weren’t any friends here judging their performance, so it didn't take many moments for their kiss to grow into something deeper and more sensual. Harry kissed Draco like no other boy had kissed him before. Harry’s kisses were as untameable as his flying, but there wasn’t any battle to their embrace. His kiss sought union and intimacy, sought the sharing of one breath and it was wonderful.
Instead, Harry finds himself in a quaint street in Lacock, Wiltshire. For a moment he thinks he would have had to go further  because Malfoy Manor can’t be far from here, but he’s sure that he's close. The street looks wizarding if the floating displays in the shop windows and the width of the street, much too small for a car, are anything to go by. It’s hardly different to Diagon, except smaller and quieter, the houses possibly older. Natural stones support white walled upper floors, warm timbres lead into dim shops through low door frames.
One awful experience wasn’t going to break Draco Malfoy. Hadn’t he been through a lot worse? He’d had to put up with the sneers and side glances of strangers ever since the end of the war. Draco understood that there were a lot of wixen out there that loathed him. One cretinous idiot wasn’t about to break his spirit and make him cower.
The light is dazzling in the window-less, marble-tiled room, but he finds a little relief in the cold, refreshing jet right from the tap, washing his face with trembling hands, drinking some of the water, concentrating on the soft rush of the cool wet.
Harry is dead serious, but Draco chuckles softly at his words, his chest bumping up and down beneath Harry while his own body is still seized with embarrassing sobs. It takes long minutes until Draco speaks again. “I think you have a very big heart, regardless of what the
The moment felt so blissful that I forgot that I’m supposed to hate Harry and promptly kissed that giddy smile from his lips, and his stubbly jaw, and his beautiful eyebrows. He looked just as happy as I felt, and in that moment while his magic was flowing from his palms, right under my skin, I felt like we were one, the three of us. Somehow each their own person (at least soon enough) but connected by something that will always bond us in a deep, fundamental way.
Unlike usually, they are on their way quite early. The last minutes of sunlight paint the dull, grey streets in rich colours, the asphalt gleaming as though it was gilded, while they walk towards the Tube station. Harry smiles when he spots the first folk that look like they have the same destination; people wearing cut-offs and shirts with art and logos on them, some of whom Harry recognises.
“But how does one operate technology when it seems to be so complicated with all these-” Draco gestures in search of words- “this
him, and Draco could get onboard with that. The man was into him, and that was a turn-on. Even so, they needed to inject some calm. Everything was suddenly too heated; they'd burn each other if they weren't careful.
I’ll admit, diary, that my heart was beating ten to the dozen as I sipped tea in Andi’s lounge, waiting for him to arrive. Teddy was beside me, nattering about his friends from primary school, and the class cat that they’ve just adopted, but – completely disgraceful, I know - I wasn’t listening.
“I regret it now,” Draco had smiled, sipping from his glass. “In the end the boy turned out to be quite a decent sort.” I watched Draco laugh, watched the edges of his lips crinkle, and I knew, in that one small moment, Draco was having a good time.
But after Harry remembered the weird familiarity of talons tapping against the huge windows of his suite, and the Gringotts seal on the thick, marble-hued envelope, he had hoped that the magic of the wallet wasn’t the problem but rather that his signature was needed. It turned out that it was his presence that was needed which made him feel all faint and dizzy, but the visit at Gringotts is over much more quickly than Harry anticipated. He feels light with relief after having repeatedly broken into cold sweat this morning, all in vain. If Harry is glad about one piece of legal advice he took after the war, it’s claiming commission for every product sold with his name on it. Money has flowed freely ever since, just as freely as he hoped without ever checking.
As we sat there, ordering wine and starters, it was all a bit stilted. Conversations about finding our way here, one of the first things I always ask about, because Muggles do take so much longer to get anywhere. But James didn’t seem to have anything to complain about finding the hotel and he did not start to brag or vent about his automobile. What a strange specimen of a man he was.
If he’d sought an abortion, Draco would’ve had to talk about Fitzgerald to the Healer. He’d have had to relive the details of their time together. He’d even have had to meet with Fitzgerald and gain his consent for the procedure. Wizarding law said that both parents had to lodge their written agreement with the hospital. Only then would Draco have been allowed to undergo the termination.
The last glass or porcelain rings into silence while Harry catches his breath, panting as though he’s just ran a mile. Draco’s eyes glisten with hurt and worry and disappointment. Something cruel wants to take a hold of Harry upon the sight, upon thinking that, finally, all his dreams are confirmed, finally he drove the one bloke away that he had fun spending time with. Again.
, a few loose scrolls of parchment and a short-feathered quill that functions as the cap to a small ink bottle.
Malfoy arches his eyebrows, glimpsing at him. “I bet you are. You must be.” For an odd moment, they smile at each other. Harry snuggles his face into the crook of his arm, head and chest light with a pleasant tingle. He thinks that, maybe, Malfoy’s smile looks flirtatious or maybe the way Harry snuggles into his own arm crook is.
Everything was a bit of a blur after that. Draco ran for the door, and by the time I had followed him, my friend had Disapparated. When I got home, I found him locked up in his room, where he remains now.
Draco doesn’t realise that he’s staring at Potter until green eyes look at him. “What has happened here?” he asks, and the trick works because Potter thinks about it for a single moment. About being locked in for days on end. About not being allowed food. Being allowed to the toilet once a day. And then a vivid one, the memory of sitting here on what looks like a poor excuse for a makeshift bed, too small, even for the small boy. He tries to repair his glasses, wondering why he’s always in the way of people, why they always accidentally knock them off or step on them when he wasn’t looking after them well enough.
“I’m not prude,” John emphasises, eyes on Harry. “I just told this prat here a thousand times this week that he’s got exams soon, and that he ought to sit his arse down and start actually learning.”
Teddy starts explaining to him about it. At least Draco knows the word internet and has actually used it on a laptop before. Bar from that, they stop at every other word and Draco makes Teddy explain in excruciating detail what an iPhone is. Harry listens closely because he honestly didn’t bother to learn anything about these newfangled, all-display gimmicks. His uncharged Nokia lives in the drawer of his nightstand now anyway.
The day Harry Flooes to Grimmauld Place, he reassures Draco that it’s something he has to do on his own. That it’s something he
Draco’s impassioned speech didn’t have the slightest effect on the Mediwizard. He paused before he spoke, but when he did, his voice was quiet and subtly threatening.
“No,” Draco says. He would have left it at that, but his talking tunes out the memories, replaces them with worried, stupid Muggle questions. “Not if we extract it. It will be used for research because it happens very rarely.”
The deal is, though, I am not a daft or inept wizard. Starting from that moment that I spurred him on so urgently, I felt an innate magic stream through the both of us. I was too much into it to stop myself at first, I thought it was naught but my own magic acting up accidentally. But I’m certain that I felt his magic too. It felt warm and powerful. Like he was touching me everywhere, all at once. Perhaps I’m romanticising a little bit, but I felt completely veiled in that feeling. And very much the same, I felt something from me reach out to James. I do believe that, in the very proverbial sense of it, we became one. I feel like a
Some of Draco’s punters like to tie him up or humiliate him. Draco says that he’s an actor, playing a role and simply giving them a good time but, as I find I can't stop saying, I’ve fallen in love with him. I can’t abide the idea of him actually,
At the moment Blaise and Astoria are sitting with him, gifting him their magic with their touches - and I’ve been shooed away from the ward and away from Draco's bedside, told to go home and try to get some sleep. I’ve been there twelve hours.
Harry was just calculating a smooth angle to start unbuttoning Draco’s shirt, when Draco gently pushes against his shoulder, signalling him to sit up. Pink lips and heavy-lidded eyes in the sedate light of the room. The hint of his smile is completely disarming. But Draco gives the impression that they are done kissing, hopefully only for now.
“Don’t you dare even ask,” Draco said, when he saw me looking in his direction. “My life, and what I do with it when I’m not here is none of your bloody business.”
Oh, I know I’ve brought the fantasy, hook, line and sinker. Drake the sex worker was very, very good at his work, and I believed it. Diary, when I was there, eating dinner, and dancing, and fucking, a voice whispered in my head that this was a real date, and that when Drake asked me to accompany him to his room, it was because he really wanted it.
I know it’s a silly precaution, but I’ve made him take an enchanted coin on his dates. It’s exactly like the one we used to use in the DA, except that it’s a Muggle pound coin. All he has to do is squeeze it in his fist, and then I can Apparate over to wherever Draco might be. “My Saviour,” Draco teased, when I insisted that he take it, but I noticed that he tucked it into his pocket without an argument.
She SQUEALED. She squealed, momentarily raising the attention of the guards and the other visitors, muffling the sound by covering half her face in her hands, but without taking her eyes off me. She asked me – several times – whether I was fibbing.
A familiar wave of nausea and revulsion coursed through his stomach, and he placed his own Cauldron Cake back on the plate. All of a sudden it tasted revolting. Draco thought he must have been pulling a curious face because Pansy furrowed her brow in his direction.
Teddy had been given a very generous set of paints by his grandmother. He settled into painting a picture of Draco and I, while I leafed through my new book.
Draco wept. He couldn’t help it, and once he began, he couldn’t stop. It was as if the dam had broken, and he wept the tears that he’d held on to so tightly, for so many months.
Harry led the way, slowly and carefully, and without making any sudden moves. The two of them made their way through the hall, into the lounge. Draco cast a Lumos and the two of them sat down.
"Potter." Something in Draco’s voice changes. He sounds almost outraged. "I am very desperately in love with you. With all of you. And if you would just accept that—very much like you took me to the Manor, very much like you’re guilt-tripping upon seeing my scars every day —if you would just accept that I want to kiss you and tell you that you're the most precious thing on earth whenever you're feeling low, that would be terrific. I want
Draco doesn’t feel much like speaking or explaining anything to the Muggle. He’s not worth his time or his insights, not worth of
“Please,” Draco answered, and I could see the tears already welling in his eyes. In seconds the room was filled with a loud whooshing sound. It was fast, faster than mine, and I could see that Draco was as surprised as I was. “Gods, that’s so fast, is that-“
“Draco,” Harry said, striding over the carpet to Draco’s side. “I’ve missed you. You’ve not been far from my thoughts all morning.” Then, without any hesitation at all, Harry wrapped his arms around Draco and pulled him into a kiss.
“Well-” Malfoy swallows and leans back and looks up at the ceiling, brows contemplatively furrowed. They are both sitting on the settee with their legs drawn up to the seat. Malfoy sits straight, head now on the backrest. But Jesus, it feels weird facing away from him. Harry turns to sit sideways, head and arms on the backrest. “For one, you always seemed like someone who’d enjoy . . . the mainstream. You know, pints at the pub, karaoke night if you’re feeling wild.” Malfoy pauses for a moment. “But then, you looked always so insecure inside your skin. In your too-big clothes and with this inability to phrase proper sentences.”
“I want to go with you,” Harry says before he knows it for a fact. “I’m not sure if . . . how . . .” He’s at a loss of words. Even the idea of facing Andromeda brings feelings of shame and guilt, feelings which he just doesn’t know how to explain. But what he knows is that he wants to do this for Draco, with Draco.
In front of us on the glass and marble coffee table stands an assortment of crystals. A whisky decanter, two tumblers with diamond-shaped embellishments, each filled with a sample of the amber liquid. Between the spirits, a triangular phial glistens, filled with a potion one might mistake for milk if it wasn’t for its effulgence.
I rearrange my long limbs, sit up, and brush through Harry’s hair. “Darling,” I say, and Harry’s eyes gleam in response. “Darling, I wouldn’t ever. After all we’ve been through, a glimpse of the future will hardly be a shock, whatever it is that I’ll see.”
But back to my one concern: if he’s a wizard and if he’s a Londoner, chances are that I know him and he will certainly know me. I wouldn’t even mind if he was too shy or felt guilty for fancying an ex-Death Eater, but I fear that he has powerful knowledge about me now. No one blackmailed me and there was no news or headlines in the
After a brief silence, Malfoy says, “You seem to have fun friends. That’s good. That’s really nice. You must feel comfortable around them. They didn’t exactly look like . . . Well, I probably got the wrong impression.”
“Draco is brilliant,” Harry says, his eyes searching Hermione’s because he doesn’t know what she thinks about Draco. Her expression is open and attentive without any hint of spite or doubt, but Harry feels the need to emphasise, “Like,
The others light their smokes, but he quit when Tarquin quit a few months ago. His fingers twitch, but he doesn’t give in as he stands there with Nick and Judith and her friend, the three of them caught in an ongoing conversation about all possible, amusingly miniscule details about chewing gum. The chilly air is a blessing on his clammy skin, and he bundles his tee-shirt in his fist, fanning air under the wet fabric. “What was your name again, love?” Harry asks Judith’s friend when their eyes accidently lock, and she tells him she’s Aanya. While they sit on the gravel together, picking at tufts of grass that force their way through, she writes her name into the dusty ground, showing Harry how to spell it.
, right, Johnny?” Harry laughs along, admiring the wiry frame of the man he ended up in bed with, still wondering how the sex has been.
Well, when Pansy visited me last week, she had the decency to bring a nice selection of chocolates. my favourite tea, and a few fresh plums. At least that's one thing I was able to stomach. “Thanks for trying, pet,” she said, and the way she looked at me told me that she was more than a little worried about my odd condition lately.
Draco runs his fingers over Harry’s lips, and the simple touch changes the look in both their eyes as Harry parts his lips. He sees Draco’s prick twitch in his boxer shorts, and Harry can’t help himself but rub his cheeks and his mouth over the swell, feeling aroused when he listens to the change in Draco’s breathing and feels his lithe muscles flexing with anticipation. The fabric darkens under Harry’s tongue. Only when he feels completely erect does Harry fondle with the hem of the boxers to take out Draco’s prick and lick the pink, glistening glans with abandon.
It’s just starting to get dark with a mostly overcast sky and the hint of the setting sun in the distance. Industrial buildings, tall but not reaching the level of the rooftop terrace, angular and silver with cement, shadows, and stale window shades. What a sombre view to look down into the world from up here, Harry thinks, bitter, and he leans on the ice-cold balustrade, face to the sky, briefly faint with a new wave of dizziness.
“Harry,” Draco interrupted him, caressing his head and his cheek. “You never pressured me. I know that, and I want to be intimate with you. It’s just a question of how. I felt like a kid-free afternoon would be a good moment to talk or, you know,
Harry sighed. “It’s alright. Just so much bureaucracy. I don’t want to complain, love. It’s just a couple of days' work, and then we’ll have the hearing in the courtroom and that will put an end to all this misery. Finally.”
Draco had the most neat and most perfectly pert little belly that I’d ever seen. Merlin but it was entirely beautiful. It took everything I had not to touch it.
until he would finally have his hearing. And only because he wanted to help—it’s always the same in this godforsaken world. It’s always the good guys who have to pay, just fucking always. Harry’s hands tremble while he reads the words over and over again, and he calms himself with one, two, well- fuck, he’s not even remotely drunk—
Harry wasn’t allowed to take Draco’s statement or come into the interview. Draco knew that he'd have to take that final step alone. “That isn’t allowed,” Harry said grimly, as the two of them sat in a freezing cold waiting room. “Fitzgerald could allege that I'd coaxed you, or that the DMLE wasn’t impartial in his treatment. We have to do everything by the book. Please don’t worry though. Macintosh is a brilliant officer, very experienced. He'll look after you every bit as well as I would. I’d trust him with my life.”
“Only read the Muggle news,” Harry replies, half-lying because he barely consumes any news ever. But now that Malfoy mentions it, he remembers Malfoy was said to have left Britain after his parents were imprisoned. He himself was pardoned on most of the charges. How odd it had felt to see Draco Malfoy in the Wizengamot chambers back then, reliving the day Harry was brought into the Manor by Snatchers, reliving the day of the battle, and hearing Malfoy’s meek voice explain his supposedly harmless intentions. Harry had felt nothing but pity for him. He didn’t even care if his words were truthful or not. He just wanted this farce to stop, to release him from Malfoy’s Pensieve memories, projected into the room for everyone to see, meticulously compared to Harry’s, to Ron’s, to Hermione’s, to Goyle’s; and, what the fuck, just release Malfoy too. Harry didn’t care.
If things could continue just the way they are at the moment, that would be terrific. The days I like best are seeing clients in the daytime and meeting up for a soiree with Pansy and Blaise in the night. Perhaps I wouldn’t complain about visiting Aunty and my cousin every other weekend. And the other weekends, I’ll gladly have one of these dreadful pints they serve at the Leaky with Harry and his lot. Which will mean no Potter-free weekends for me. He’s been chewing my ear off about the new series of kid’s brooms they have in his shop at the Phoenix brooms. I’m quite certain that he’ll have bought one for Teddy by the weekend. And with the autumn storms picking up this week, Aunty will completely hate the idea. Time to make myself her favourite relation.
“You need to shush,” Fitzgerald replied, his voice low. Draco wondered if he was trying for seductive, but if so, it wasn’t working. He was being told to shut up, and that wasn’t even remotely acceptable. “Do you run your mouth off like this every time you have sex, Malfoy? You’ll enjoy this plenty; I promise you.”
“I don’t know the Weasleys that well yet. I didn’t want to come off too judgmental. I can be quite a smug smart-arse. Besides, I've heard
He ought to be hungry. Harry remembers hunger. He remembers how it gnawed at his insides when he was small and locked inside his cupboard. How he’d dug desperately through the Dursley’s bin, looking for any crumbs that they’d left behind.
Aanya pets his back soothingly when Harry leans back to ease his breathing, the words ring in his mind from a different time, from a Pensieve, from a cluttered office; a contained voice,
Draco didn’t expect that the Aurors would arrest Fitzgerald. Harry had told him it was unlikely. “There’s no proof that'll stand up in a courtroom,” Harry had told Draco the night before. “There’s no magical traces that we can take from the clothes you were wearing. No photographs of bruises or any record from a trip to St Mungo’s. No witnesses or corroborating testimony. I’d watch your memories of the night in a Pensieve if I thought it would help, but I know it won't. The Wizengamot doesn’t allow intoxicated memories to be included as evidence."
Everything is orange and too hot. Fiendfyre or perhaps a curse? It’s not fair that he has to go through this again, he doesn’t want to. He’s going to fail this time, and he wonders whether he can just pretend that everything worked out fine. Dumbledore will see right through his lie, he supposes, but it’ll give him time. Time to get everything right.
“Merlin. That feels so brilliant,” Draco exclaimed, when I finally found my treasure. I licked and lapped at the head of Draco’s penis, careful not being too rough, knowing how oversensitive the pregnancy hormones had left him.
On a whim, Harry Apparates not back into the drawing room where Draco, wine, and music are awaiting, but on the far side of the grounds where a small forest rises into a natural border, enhanced with magic. The twilight is dark under the canopy of trees, the smells in the air fresh and mossy all the same.
I won’t say that to Draco though. I think he’d likely hex me for suggesting that we get bonded. None of his clothes fit anymore, and he is currently sporting an assortment of Muggle clothing that we’ve extended with magic. Draco believes that he looks huge and ungainly, but the truth is Draco hasn’t ever looked better. He’s gotten really big now he’s getting closer to his due date.
Things would be a tad easier if James had mailed me again. I ought to keep my appointments open just in case he's in London and wants to arrange a date. I’d chug down all the potions in existence for that. Decent chap, huge pay-off – I’d prioritise him anytime.
“Wrackspurts in my belly,” he said, tapping his feet on the floor and steadfastly not meeting anyone’s gaze. He kept my hand on his own, resting on his thigh. His bump was really showing now, his black shirt clinging to the soft swell of his tummy. “But I’m glad I’m here. Thank you for nagging at me to come, Harry. Thank you for looking out for me.”
Draco came to a decision. He hadn’t spoken in a while, and in spite of his very stupid joke minutes before, he was very aware that Fitzgerald couldn’t tell what he was thinking. He needed to speak up.
” Arthur took a more pragmatic approach.  He pretended not a day had passed since they’ve last seen each other, showing him a Muggle rail way that he had set up for the kids to craft and play with.
Draco Malfoy’s reputation preceded him. Draco was a flirt. Draco liked sex, and he liked plenty of it. He was out, and brash, and proud of who he was. Despite being part of their staff, Draco spent half his life in the Prophet scandal pages. There was always a different man on his arm, and a different man – or two – sharing his bed.
It’s a matter of seconds. He corks the glassen phial and shows it to Potter, giving him a quirk of his lip, which Potter knows to interpret as a triumphant smile. The magic swirls around itself, idle and as dark as the night sky, sparkling with a myriad of colours that appear as the tiniest dots, only visible to those who look at the world with open eyes. It’s a beauty to behold, mesmerising. Draco tucks it away.
Before they fucked that night, Draco hovered between Harry’s legs, taking his time to travel over the whole of Harry with his eyes and his fingers. And perhaps it was ruthless calculation on Draco’s side to choose the moment his pulsing cock was nudging Harry’s entrance, but he stopped, interrupting Harry’s breathy pleas for his prick with, “
Although I would’ve loved to agree with all his suggestions for our dates, I told him that I can’t do overnight stays. I simply don’t want to. He’s a nice chap, Kayden, but I’d miss dinner with Potter all the time. And he has taken to cooking all the things that I like. After every meal he wants to know what I enjoyed and didn’t enjoy, and he tells me to be blunt with him. He’s a great cook. I never used to think much about food, just needing some small meals to sustain myself, but eating together has become sort of a ritual.
He sighed. “I haven’t even managed to tell my mum,” Draco sniffed, incredulous that he was having this conversation. “I can’t think about things like that. Not yet.”
Harry cooked. He didn’t touch. He never came in for surprise hugs, or tried to kiss Draco goodnight. That was good. That was refreshing.
Something about the wanton expression Draco wore changed into surprise and then into confusion. “A dildo?” he asked.
Draco was nervous this morning, before we Flooed to St Mungo’s. We’d both been a bit snippy with each other, but I knew it was just worrying, especially on my part.
“Nah,” Harry concedes, “she doesn’t hate me, but she thinks badly of me. Did you see her face when I told her that I haven’t had a job for the past few years?”
If I told Draco the truth, I could cease all of his fears in a single moment, but then I would lose him, and the plum forever. I’m not sure that I’m ready for that.
“You needn’t be embarrassed, Harry. And relationships to people you know or don’t know—it doesn’t even matter, they can all be too darn complicated to explain anything. If I had known that you had no idea about any of your ancestors . . .” Draco lapses into silence. His eyes rest on Harry, heavy-lidded with something that might be understanding or affection. “You've had it rather rough in your life.”
Written there, I don’t think that looks too ghastly. We’ve all got the right to a private life, haven’t we? I mean, the idea of it feels a bit jarring. Before today, Harry J Potter wasn’t the type of man to buy sex. That was the preserve of old, ugly wizards who creep out to the rough alleyways behind Knockturn Alley to cheat on their wives. Young, vaguely good-looking blokes shouldn’t have to buy sex. For wizards like myself, sex shouldn’t be a transaction.
spell. Pansy was his best friend in all the world, but whilst she’d forgiven and forgotten him getting drunk and knocking over her Pensieve, Draco doubted she’d readily pardon him turning her fiancée's brain to scrambled egg.
Demonstratively, Harry draws his cocaine-filled vial from his breast pocket, wiggling it in front of her eyes. “Enjoying life to the fullest.”
Harry huffs a laugh, eyes catching Draco’s when he looks up from his food. They’re both smiling when their gazes meet.
I’m not ashamed to say that I cried too, Cassie, and so did Draco. Matching tears ran down our faces. Gods, but you were the most perfect thing that I’d ever laid eyes on, red and furious, and wailing loudly at the indignity of being born. I used my wand to cut your umbilical cord and then Bartsch cast protective magic over you, and wrapped you in a soft yellow towel, before you were plonked onto Draco’s upper chest for a cuddle.
He could tell that I liked it. My thrusting – so measured and careful until now – became erratic, and my breathing was rough and loud. There was a tightness in my chest and a knot of pleasure in my balls. It was foolish to try to fight the orgasm that was building so speedily within me. Hot ejaculate spilled suddenly between Draco’s legs, and I stepped backwards, leaning my head on Draco’s shoulder while I caught my breath.
Harry has. He thinks about the Burrow—there were chickens in a coop outside, clucking and walking around with these staccato movements they make. He hadn’t given them much thought at the time, but it feels like he might view them differently now, would he meet a chicken at this moment. He imagines a chicken on a plate and how gruesome it would be to slaughter it. Or to take a bite out of the flesh-and-blood body. “Merlin’s eyes,” he mutters at his vivid imagination and the queasy feeling in his stomach, earning amused and confused laughter from Aanya while agreeing with the absurdity of eating something that has its own life.
As you can see, my dear future-Harry, reading this in years to come, my thoughts always seem to drift back to Draco. Twice I’ve been back to the internet café, and twice I have searched out Drake’s profile in that seedy, grubby little room.
His face – always lean – looked emaciated. His skin was sallow, and there were purplish shadows underneath his eyes. Draco is usually very well turned out, but today he was wearing a loose wool coat and a long grey scarf, twisted twice around his neck. I’m quite an oblivious person usually, but even I could tell that Draco had dressed specially so as not to attract attention.
I felt Harry’s eyes on me rather a lot. I assume that, much like my other friends, he’s been a bit worried about me lately. Rightly so, but I haven’t considered telling anyone about the pregnancy as of yet. Potter asked me whether I wanted one of the Muggle treats he snacks on so often. Well, I ended up eating a whole packet of Hob-Nobs. I know that it was his polite way to say that I don’t look too well, but somehow, I don’t feel as patronised with Potter as I do with Blaise who always insists that my love life is so dire because there’s nothing on me to hold on to. If only he knew how much more of me there inevitably will be soon!
responsive, huh?” Harry says, voice challenging as he pushes three fingers inside of Draco, quicker and just a tad rougher than before, his other hand moving from the jut of his hips to Draco’ leaking cock between his spread legs.
Harry frowns, opening his mouth in protest. But he might as well hop onto this freely offered excuse. “So, mending, huh?”
At first, Andromeda is stone-faced, civil but distant, which makes Harry crave a little boost in self-confidence in the form of cocaine. The chilly air about her is far more unnerving than the idea of her obvious chastisement. His eyes on the photographs, Harry pointlessly comments how Teddy is growing into a handsome young man, and Andromeda replies, “Well, that’s the nature of time.” And when Harry sheepishly comments that the new settee looks nice, Andromeda points out how helpful Draco has been clearing out the old furniture and getting this cumbersome beauty to where it currently stands. At that, Draco gives her a pointed look and says, “Must you, Aunty?” It’s the first time that Andromeda doesn’t smile politely but laughs rather heartily, commenting, “Love’s young dream, the two of you. He won’t break, Draco darling. Don’t fret.”
Draco was more exhausted than he thought he’d ever been. Even his bones ached. Was this what it felt like to have a broken heart? He couldn’t understand how his body was still so stubbornly alive. How his lungs kept breathing, kept sucking in lungful after lungful of air, and the blood kept pumping through his veins. How the bump kept growing, bigger and more prominent with each new day.
As for me, I had a lot of thinking to do. Shamefully, I’d never considered the weight that came with carrying the Malfoy name, and just how bloody hard those first few years after the war must have been for Draco. He’d never looked like he was struggling, so I’d accepted it as a given that he was fine.
Draco wouldn’t have accepted five grand for a date with me. For one thing, he doesn’t do dates. Lots of wizards – even Jules, my colleague at Phoenix – have tried to court him. Draco is as polite as can be, but he never lets anyone inside his head. He never lets them in. Draco is as inscrutable now as he was at school. If I had propositioned Draco and asked for his services, I fear that I might have lost his friendship altogether. That is one outcome I cannot countenance.
was exactly what I needed.” The Beater seemed to catch on when he saw the sight of Draco's flaccid, disinterested prick. “Let me take care of you,” he coaxed, taking it inside his hand and beginning to stroke it. “We can’t have you leaving without your own happy ending.”
“Kiss me,” Harry prompts. Draco smiles and after a second, he leans down to put his warm lips on Harry’s, fingers trailing over Harry’s Adam’s apple. It feels intimate to have his fingers and a blade at his exposed neck. Something about it makes Harry think that he couldn't  go on with his life if he were made bereft of that care and the deep feeling it evokes.
Have I made a terrible mistake? I admit, my conscience is plaguing me now. It has grown to the size and fury of a Horntail. ‘What did you expect?’ my conscience taunts. Draco makes love for money, and like George said, sex is a commodity, something to be bought and sold.
Harry thought for a moment, then nodded. “I think so. That’s not meant to keep you from choosing your profession – I’ll be damned before I tell you what to do. I’ll respect any decision that you make. But if you only want to know if I’d be jealous… I’m afraid the answer is yes.”
had called their food ‘the most delectable in the wizarding world’, it seemed like the only subject on anyone’s lips.
Draco considered Harry. Even though Draco had taken his wand, he didn’t seem scared or angry. His facial expression was one of soft concern, and his body language was open and gentle. It was time to take a chance. Draco placed the two wands on the table between them. He slid Harry’s towards him.
Bloody hell, but the gang even made jokes about the subject over beer in The Leaky Cauldron. I know for a fact that we’ve chuckled over Percy’s straight-laced antics.
Harry takes a shaky little breath, cheeks burning with embarrassment. But before he can answer, both Hermione and Teddy break out in a little amused laugh. “You call each other by your last names?” Hermione asks. Next to Harry, Draco wears a pleased smile.
The last date he could have gotten an abortion had already passed him by, marked only by a tiny star that he’d stuck into his diary.
He was just about to suggest that he could fellate Fitzgerald when he felt himself being walked the two steps backwards towards the bed.
“Thank you,” Teddy exclaimed, throwing his arms around my middle. “S’the best present I’ve ever had! I wanted to go out and fly after Christmas dinner, but Nana said no! She says we’ve got to wait for our food to go down.”
The last thing I wanted was to pry. Draco was fragile – he was pregnant and had just been made homeless – but then he sat down on the bed and indicated that I ought to sit beside him. I did so and after a moment of hesitation, I took his hand. “I know that the Manor was sold,” I said, remembering the arguments that they’d made for heavy reparations in the Wizengamot. “I never thought much of how it’d have affected you at the time. It ought to have done so. It was your home.”
When we fucked for the first time, I even fancied that my client held me very carefully. I didn’t give much thought to that, bar from a few attempts of moaning loudly enough to have him pound away at me a bit harder. Still better than the other way round but… Anyway, when I had cleaned myself in the bathroom, I came back, ready to collect the second half of my money and leave.
“Christ, don’t be such a drama queen.” Incredulously, Tarquin chuckles until he looks up into Harry’s eyes.
“That’s what I’m fucking talking about,” Tarquin exclaims, bright with laughter and energy, his voice and steps resounding on the quiet streets. “We’re staying up all night, Pots. You and I.”
To share intimacy is so much better than to toss one off all by yourself. Sweet Circe, it really is. I'm sitting with Harry on a bench, overwatching the sea, and I just told him what I wrote down. To my astonishment, he told me that he keeps a diary as well to which I answered that only fourth-years call it a diary.
One hand on Harry’s arm, the other in the thin stem of his wine glass, Draco sips the last remnants of the ruby liquid, leaving Harry longing for another sip of his long-drained serve or Draco’s lips or both.
stayed.” A lump lodges in Harry’s throat, but he nods. He’ll ask Draco to watch all these memories in a Pensieve, the good and the bad ones; he knows he won’t be able to stop himself from that.
“Please excuse me,” Harry said, slipping his hand into Draco’s own, and squeezing it tightly, “sometimes I forget my manners. Still, you can hardly blame me. Draco, darling, you look delectable, and Pansy… Merlin’s beard. Draco told me that you’d made your new home into something magnificent, but I think he underdid the potion. Your home is lovely. Have
Okay. I’m starting to calm down a little now. Writing in here helps, I think. Draco is still upstairs, locked in his bedroom. I’ll go up and check on him in a couple of minutes or so.
But back to this morning. Potter had his hands on my belly, telling me about the idea to go to Diagon by bus after his work together for some more shopping. Now that I can’t Floo or Apparate anymore, it’s quite a nuisance to get anywhere. Harry tries very hard in asking his permission for everything now. He wouldn’t buy a plushie without asking me whether I liked it too.
Draco snorts and looks up from where he’s planting garlic before he bursts into full-on laughter. “Merlin, you’re such an idiot.” Grinning along and shaking his head, Harry goes over to him, not able to resist the way Draco looks when he’s getting his hands dirty. When Harry throws his arms around the squatting figure of Draco, they sway dangerously, but Harry manages to stop them from falling onto the freshly aerated, pitch-black soil.
And with that comment, Draco abandoned Harry Potter to his dreary, wholesome existence and stood up. Stuart Fitzgerald had just entered the room, and Draco was enchanted by the sight of him. Fitzgerald was six feet of toned, striking wizard, covered with a very snug black t-shirt.
One of us leant in. I have no idea who of us started this, but suddenly we were kissing. There wasn’t a moment of trying and probing for an angle, nor was it steamy. It felt like we’ve been doing exactly that for years. Sure of our movements, lips parting with the first hint of the other’s tongue. His hands were in my nape, his body flush against mine, and I held his waist between my hands, very much aware that I was starting to feel up all the firm lines, and dips and curves of his body. My hands were on his arse before I could even remotely try to stop myself.
“I know,” Harry says, swallowing. Pushing the thought at the back of his mind has been quite effective so far, but he knows that there are several things that are about to change. It’s inevitable ever since he decided to stay with Draco. “But do you really think Andromeda will want to see me? I think I . . .” With a sigh, Harry puts down his fork, not at all wishing to eat anymore. “I think I left her in the lurch. With Teddy. During Auror training, I used to visit at the weekends and take care of him until I just sort of . . .
He held me close, one hand on my hip, the other warm on my middle, stroking all over my belly before he made his hand large and held me, hips thrusting into me at an unrelenting pace until the rhythmical movements halted into a staccato of thrusts and I felt his hot spunk spill into me.
There was nothing for it. Draco had to leave, and he had to leave now. The pair had him backed into a corner.
All of a sudden, Harry was there. Draco hadn’t seen him arrive, or been conscious of his approach, but there he was. Harry was wearing his red Auror robes, and the mere sight of him burst the tight bubble of tension that had filled the office.
I was very adequately dressed. So was he, and he did not look ugly or like a complete weirdo. When I’ve learnt one thing during my days as a rent boy, it’s that all types of men want to enjoy themselves a little and will gladly pay for it if they must. But James didn’t look any different from all the other faceless guys I’ve been with. He didn’t look particularly smarmy or smug, not even wealthy. Not like a serial killer which I've sort of dreaded since I received his email. He had brown eyes and dark hair, with a clean-shaven face. Perhaps in his mid- or late-thirties. He looked very business overall. A bit nondescript.
“This your place?” Draco asked, gesturing to the room. He took off his shoes, good manners ingrained. “It’s spectacular.”
Harry scoots closer as they lie face to face on their sides, his leg hooked over Draco’s waist. He runs a finger over Draco’s slightly opened, velvety lips, down to the jut of clavicles that are naught but a blur without his glasses. Draco’s hand kneads his arse cheek, rubbing closer and closer to his crease, and Harry’s breathing gets heavy when a finger grazes his hole, followed by lube, charmed to be at body temperature. The head of the toy puts a firm weight into him as he feels it slip inside with one slow, gentle glide. He feels the toy and Draco’s hand somewhere in and on his arse and on his perineum.
Well, Father is like he always is. Writing this short sentence down hurts more than it probably should. He’s not the same person anymore, and I assume that he never will be again. But at least, I still get the feeling that he recognises me. The way he looks at me, the brief glint of happiness in his eyes – it’s full of a familiar love and recognition. He might not be able to tell me anything much in full sentences, but he’s somehow “there” when I tell him about my life. He just doesn’t know how to answer.
In the back of his mind, he can’t be fooled though. He won’t meet that person on a night out, hopefully high as a kite, and generously spending his fortune on liquor and drugs and luxury hotels for everyone who only asks nicely enough. He won’t be saved, and the highs he’s chasing won’t cure his cancerous soul. It’s okay, he tells himself. He’s finding joy in the moment. Which might not be him making the most out of his life and his talents but fuck it. He deserves some fun. He deserves some time to heal. He
Draco baulked at the idea though, claiming that he was exhausted, and that he’d overdone it with the turkey. I knew he was fibbing – he’d pushed his food around the plate, and hardly eaten a morsel – but Andi was keen to get her boots on. “As long as you’re absolutely sure, Draco dear,” she said,
Draco hums musingly. He leans back on his arms, and Harry thinks that he looks uncomfortable. “Why are we even sitting on the ground?” Harry asks.
It’s hardly crowded tonight. A small bar-height table in the corner feels just about right to spend some time there, getting lost in the upbeat chatter and music.
In bed they idly explore their bodies, naked but without any heat to their touches, and Draco says, “She can be quite a formidable witch, but I like her. And they are the only family that I have, even though I’ve only known them for five years or so.” Harry closes his eyes as Draco runs his fingers over his forehead into his hair, massaging gingerly. As if compelled to imitate the touch, Harry stops ghosting his hands over Draco’s bare sides and starts rubbing his shoulders.
“Well, it’s easy to forget about drinking and eating sometimes. And if you’re putting all this stress on your body just for the fun of it, you can at least stay hydrated in my opinion.”
I couldn’t understand how I’d so thoroughly buggered everything up. Why was Draco so defensive about my paying off the debt? There’s been many times in my short life where I’ve not been the most sensitive of men, so I thought perhaps Mike could put me right, and he did. I left his office feeling better than I have in ages.
if you care to know. And those taxes you so grudgingly pay? Hardly any of them go on the single mothers, the asylum seekers and the pride celebrations you worry about so often. And
I just returned from Flourish and Blotts. Before I go back out to work, I'm going to record the oddest occurrence. I saw Draco! Well, not to talk to, sadly. I saw him in the bookshop.
It’s quiet for a moment with nothing but the sounds of porcelain on porcelain in the air between them. When Harry finally looks up from the depth of his Earl Grey, Malfoy looks much more relaxed than he would’ve thought. He’s leant back in his chair, legs stretched out before him, and looking very much like he’s enjoying his cup of tea in silence rather than being chastised about Harry.
“I’m not trying to save you,” Harry answered, his voice calm in comparison to Draco’s own. “I’m your friend, and I’m worried about you. I know something has changed, something fundamental, and I care about you. Let me in, Draco. Please let me help you.”
Draco smells of woodsy cologne and his lips feel like velvet. His lips look thin and his whole posture rigid, but as soon as Harry takes off his spectacles, and they shift closer to each other, his body against Harry’s own
Draco must’ve pulled a face. “Is it that bad?” Potter asks, his amused tone a mockery of what he truly sounds when amused. Nervous. There’s nervousness bubbling at the surface of Potter’s mind, and it pleads for him to be let out. Potter takes a breath and rings the doorbell when Draco doesn’t answer. He’s used to his silence.
So far they have restored the kitchen, the living quarters Draco used to occupy with his parents two decades before, and the library with the attached study. Right next to the broad armchair in the study where Harry already plans on spending wonderful afternoons with a book in his lap, lives his grandmother’s phoenix perch on an ebony
His bump has dropped in the last few days, which the Mediwizards tell us means that our little one is getting themselves into a good position, ready to be born. It’s an exciting sign. Our plum is a proper little wriggler. They kicked for the first-time during week twenty-six, and I’m not going to fib: both Draco and I were more than ready to experience the movements of the little life that we have made.
All of Harry’s blood rushes south when Draco sits up and catches Harry’s wrists, pushing him down into the mattress. “Hands stay up there,
He’d go to bed and then in the morning, he’d visit the Manor, and have breakfast with Mother, just like he did every Saturday. He’d listen to the tales she repeated about her pure-blood friends, and he’d laugh in all the right places. He’d be entertaining company. He wouldn’t cry, and he wouldn’t be a victim.
“I’m okay,” Harry says. “I just-“ He didn’t drink anything. That’s certainly it. Out of laziness, he almost
“Harry,” he replies, giving a short incredulous laughter afterwards. “Potter. Harry Potter. Don’t worry, I won’t call you Harry all the time if you don’t like it.”
Harry’s throat constricts when he undoes button after button, inevitably revealing streaks of long-healed cuts, prominent as though inflicted only a few months ago. And briefly, memories dawn in Harry’s mind. Memories so repressed and simultaneously urgent that he briefly feels as though it happened only a few months ago.
Well, what can I say? I tried to view it as a date from then on. I thought that would be the best strategy to make it work and to make James consider seeing me again. I didn’t hold back then to complain about the wine, and we ordered another one with our main course. When his hands were on the table, I reached out to brush my fingers over the jut of his knuckles. James smiled at me and held my hand. The gesture was so chaste and his smile so genuine…
Potter. I don’t know how he does it, but for some reason, he’s always giving me the feeling that he knows what’s on my mind. And he’s not pushing me to spill the beans, nor ignoring me for taking AGES to confide something to him. If I’m absent, he sends note after note, not building up pressure but giving me options to accept seeing him or just chatting via owl.
, and he makes it sound as if Draco liking Muggle stuff has saved his life somehow. But he doesn’t know how to say any of that. His mind spins to coke or mephedrone and how they'd let him express whatever it is he’s feeling so much better. He notes Hermione’s eyes on his hands, and then his hands pinching his jeans and the skin and hair below. He makes himself stop.
“Your family has been through a lot,” Draco says. After a pause, “As we all have. But I’m glad that my work means something. Well, my assistant’s work in that case. Either way, I’m honoured that you commissioned me despite our family’s differences in the past.”
Impotent anger and irritation threaten to erupt again, but Draco only hugs Harry closer when Harry tries to push away. He continues, his timbre warm and decided. “And of your good heart and the way you always give me all of your attention when I’m speaking. And your dry sense of humour that, when you allow it, matches my own quite splendidly. And the way your hand always touches my shoulder when we’re talking on the settee, and you sing along to Green Day, forgetting about everything else in this world. And the crooked way you smile. Frankly, I want more of that. But I want it to be true because if it’s not . . .” Draco doesn’t finish the sentence.
When Draco looked at him, his silver eyes looked large and impossibly vulnerable. “Yes,” he answered breathily. “Yes, please.”
Instead of investigating this feeling that brings him into the long-ago past, Harry reaches into a hidden fold of the travel bag, and he draws a shallow wooden box from it. A key is inserted into the simple silver lock. Without any further ado, Harry opens the box he inherited from Tarquin. Inside he finds thousands of words, written in Tarquin's hasty script. Snippets of
Of course, Draco knew that as well, and he cast a sneaky Notice Me Not over the three of them when Harry haltingly started to talk about Teddy’s dad. The boy listened intently to Harry’s every word, very much with the same curiosity Harry always bore for stories about his own parents. “He was empathic,” Harry says when trying to narrow it down to one trait. “
“You will be,” Fitzgerald answered, not looking at Draco. He was fiddling with the lid of the bottle, his whole focus on that. “And I’ll be topping.” He smirked. “Should have thought that was obvious.”
But back to Harry. We were talking about which shops to visit and how much we wanted to spend. “I don’t want him to be overwhelmed,” Harry said while working away on the broom. “Last year, Christmas was so busy with all the pressies Teds got. I’d rather see him enjoy a few meaningful ones than receiving heaps, half of which were never even touched.”
Then I’m alone. So alone. Every day. I look out the window because I can’t abide the sight of the wet spot on the ceiling, the traces that the former tenant has left in the parquet-mocking linoleum for me to sneer at, and I phantasise about evenings a decade ago, a life I once led, of Harry because there’s no one else-
The blood froze in Draco’s veins and all the sunshine drained out of his day. He’d been looking forward to seeing Pansy and now everything was ruined.
Stuart Fitzgerald was waiting for him on the landing. “I was bored of all those idiots down there,” he said, stepping over to where Draco was standing. “Thought it was high time that you and I had some time alone. What’d you reckon, Draco?”
“Even if I wasn’t, it’s a little late to change my mind,” Draco answered, his laugh turning into a scowl as he had another contraction. “I really think we need to go,” he managed afterwards, as we stepped into the cool spring London night. “That one hurt much more than the others.”
When Harry sits back up, Draco seems to rediscover the necessity of breathing. He frees his face of some wayward strands of hair and tears, drawing in sudden breaths that jolt his tense shoulders. “This- Circe, but you’re bloody intense.”
Malfoy continues, “And after his prescription, I was on Xanax and Father’s collection of only the finest red wines for a while. That changed when I met my ex though. I quit Xanax because it actually only made me more anxious whenever I came down from it. And dreadfully dependent—thought I couldn’t leave the house without a pill or two. But anyhow, my ex and I, we were on so much acid.” Malfoy laughs, looking lost in memories.
and striding over to where Pansy and he stood. “Finally on first name terms after all these years. Never thought I’d live to see the day,” he said, giving Draco a sharp and rather painful poke in the ribs. “Now all you need is for him to get down onto his
Merlin, but I don’t trust St Mungo’s. No Malfoy has set foot in that hospital since Grandfather Abraxas had caught the Dragon Pox while he was a patient. Father used to ramble how only second-class-wizards were dependent on the care of public health. Well, sometimes I’m naught but a slave to his old-fashioned opinions. I want the best treatment, but I can only get what I can afford, right?
I kissed Draco, knowing that his complaints came from a place of worry, and the two of us made our way up to bed. The stairs were hard going for Draco, but he got up them slowly. I changed into my pyjamas as well. I didn’t want to be anywhere other than at Draco’s side in case he needed me. Climbing into bed beside him, I wrapped my arm around him. This was the right choice, I decided, as the two of us drifted off to sleep.
“You’re going?” Malfoy asks, startled, his cup rattling on the saucer. He gets up as well, and Harry half-remembers him, standing up after being sat in the middle of the room for hours on end, head bowed and shoulder slouched, but when he stood, there was an urgency about him. “
After Sundays, the flat is often strangely quiet. As though the weekends and the weekdays are taking place in different dimensions. But at least Nick is there more often than not, finding the gigs that are played on the weekdays. The venues are often small and the music extreme. And while Harry wouldn’t flirt with the idea of putting a metal record on, he feels absolutely ecstatic about the live equivalent. When Harry first stumbled into a death metal show, he was instantly hooked by the feeling of it. By the crowd moving and moving; the mutual understanding of when it was time to headbang, time to mosh, time for a wall of death. Back then he felt like an outsider who was consumed by the crowd and taught what to do.
Fitzgerald talked throughout, inane bosh about how well Draco was taking his cock, and how sexy Draco looked. Fitzgerald’s thrusts were erratic, and made a loud groan as he climaxed. He pulled out seconds later. Ejaculate spilled out of Draco and across the sheets.
Phoenix isn’t one of the famous brand names – we’ll never compete internationally with Cleansweep or Firebolt – but we do right for ourselves. Profits have risen every single year that I’ve worked there. Our brooms are far sportier than the big brand's models, lighter too, which makes them more manoeuvrable on the Quidditch pitch. I’m looking forward to Christmas. That’s when we make most of our yearly Galleons. Every young wix wants a smashing new broomstick in their stocking.
—sitting across from him in a broad armchair, his legs and fingers crossed, an emotionless expression in his pointy, pale face.
Of course, Draco found it easy to make love to my fictitious body. James Evans had a fit body, a giant cock and not a scar to be seen. His body hadn’t been misused with my diet of cigarettes and junk food. Fuck, but it felt good to be a real man for once in my existence. Draco seemed to like James’s prick very much. There was a heat in his eyes when he saw it erect, and I didn’t miss the soft throaty little moans that he made when I pushed inside him.
Now I’m part of a liaison that created a new life, only because I brag about taking prick like a champion on the internet, et voilà – not enough. Again. Oh, how my mind has been spinning around that crap! About the
Harry shoves his shoulders at that before he watches the telly for another minute. Feeling bored and lazy all the same. Harry inquires, "Is there music somewhere tonight? A live show or, I don't know. Just anywhere to be." Nick always knew where which bands were playing, which DJs came to which clubs, and even what’s on the darn London opera at the moment. They have actually been to the Royal Ballet—that must have been two years ago now—and Harry saw that Nick appreciates music very much, shushing Judith and Tarquin, and Dahlia who had still been with them back then, who were all talkative with mephedrone and the evocative aura of Giselle. Nick and Tarquin were the only ones who had been to the ballet before, and Harry watched the stage mesmerised by the dainty, graceful dancers, feeling bereft for all the years that he hadn’t been aware that such beauty—such striking fusion of music and movement and a story—that it existed all this time without someone showing it to him.
they’d welcome him with open arms, and that’s the worst part. They would look at him as if he’s broken and has every right to be. Worry and understanding in their eyes—it’s sickening. It’s just so embarrassing and pathetic that he can’t seem to keep his shit together like everyone else obviously can, effortlessly. They can do their fucking job without either drowning in work or skip shifts for several consecutive days without any notice. They can run their errands, and see friends, and talk to people without being an awkward idiot.
After another line finally took to his system, Harry stumbled into a conversation about something called Instagram. They showed Harry their iPhones that everyone seems to carry these days, and the pictures they’ve taken. One of them catches Harry’s eye when Harry comments what nice abs he has, looking almost insulted. Harry takes the hint and leaves the guy alone, talking—well,
Draco runs a hand down Harry’s spine, just in the moment that the kettle whistles and Harry starts pouring the hot water into his inelegant mugs, the tea-stained one with the two dancing Bowtruckles on it, that’s Harry’s, and the one with the autumnal floral pattern, that’s Draco’s. He’s hindered, though, because Draco wraps his arms around him,very tightly, holding him in his entirety.
“Oh fuck,” Harry finds himself muttering before kissing Draco fiercely. “Call me Potter, will you?” he requests, before he knows it, eliciting a smirk on Draco’s face.
“I’ll take DADA, Potions, Transfiguration, Herbology and Charms.” Teddy counts the subjects on his fingers. His brown eyes glisten with joy. Something in Harry’s chest constricts. “I’ll become an Auror. If my grades are good enough.”
Fitzgerald hadn’t even bothered to use a condom. The room was filled with the musty, detergent-like stink of cum. It turned Draco’s stomach. Usually he adored the scent of another man, but today it was repugnant.
The Mediwizard led us to a small side room. He opened the door and indicated that we sat in two chairs before he went to his desk. He spent a few moments leafing through the parchment papers in his desk before making eye contact with Draco once more. “Well, well,” he said, his stare taking in Draco’s form and lingering on his swollen middle. “A male pregnancy! I never thought I’d see the like in my lifetime. I’m going to assume that this is the other father?”
what? And who?” Harry is curious despite himself. He didn’t know how much he wanted to think, to talk about all of this.
Teddy is still the person towards whom Harry feels the most shame. He needn’t be, he knows that. Teddy, who wore his hair a beautiful chestnut-brown for Christmas, is a quiet but happy-seeming boy who likes to share his thoughts with Draco. Harry was happy simply listening to the two of them speak, and every time Teddy glanced at him, failing to be furtive about it, Harry smiled at him in an attempt to seem friendly and approachable.
Harry’s heartbeat quickens when he feels the tears well in his eyes. He rubs his face, his cheeks numb from too much wine. But the moment he meets his own eyes in the mirror, the feeling of loneliness and disappointment and
The evening is spent in a restaurant with loose enough drug policies if you ordered enough champagne alongside several courses of fancy food, and Harry is glad that he sits next to Carol because she is one of the few he has ran in the same circles with now for a while, someone with a life, someone with a
The thing is, dear diary, I’ve always wanted a family of my own. I suppose that a Mind Healer would say I’m a big cliché. The boy without parents wanting more than anything to have a family of his own. There’s an excess of love inside of me, I’m flooded with it, drenched and overwhelmed. Jules had to tell me to get my head in the game yesterday – I’d nearly chiselled off a finger – and he shook his head. “You’ve got it bad,” he said, scoffing at me. “I hope he’s worth it.”
Harry allows Draco’s ministrations, the both of them quiet. As the razor and Draco’s fingers card through his beard, Harry’s mind drifts to the days ahead that will be filled with family visits. It might turn out to be like Christmas—
Harry looked around too, and couldn’t help but feel just the teensiest bit impressed as well. A canopy of thick foliage hung above their head, dotted there and there with lanterns. Tiny enchanted flames flared in each. Moonlight shone through the leaves and Draco’s face glowed in the candlelight. The linen was a soft creamy white, while the wine list was incomprehensible and eye-wateringly expensive. The Chimaera’s Den was so perfectly
Christmastime, for Draco, meant his attendance at his mother’s Yule Ball. He would very much have loved to make an excuse, but there was no getting out of it. He’d already ignored far too many of Narcissa’s owls, and Draco knew the witch was growing suspicious that he had a secret.
Teds and Andi were still outside the cottage, gossiping with an elderly neighbour, but I’d nipped away, tired of their unconcealed curiosity. When I got inside, the lights were
I was still busy accusing Harry of talking rubbish because HE is the one who always caught the snitch away under my nose back in Hogwarts when Teddy started pleading with me to give a demonstration as well. He looked at me, his eyes big and his tone begging, and I almost gave in. But Harry cut in, suggesting that Teddy should rather get back on his broom himself because it will only be about ten minutes until his nana would call us all in for tea.
Ironically, it was the talk about Boggarts that made the conversation light-hearted. Draco flippantly said that his Boggart must’ve been drunk because he was certainly not scared of some gruesome variant of the Tooth Fairy when he was in third year, and it’s just one of these odd Muggle tales anyway. Then Harry mentioned Dementors and how Draco had dressed as one to give him a scare. Teddy laughed his head off at the idea that his cousin would pull such a childish prank.
and another one that leads into a study. “Before that, it used to be a playroom. Father had it changed the summer before I started Hogwarts.”
Instead of complying immediately, Harry adds a third finger, swaps them with his thumb. Normally, Harry wouldn’t exactly rush through sex, but he feels like taking his time with Draco. As though just one uncomfortable thrust due to a lack of thorough preparation is simply unthinkable. When Draco gasps and hips rock back against Harry’s hand, he firmly pushes him back with a pleased grin on his face. “
you how sexy you are?” I asked and Draco nodded his consent. I slipped to my knees in front of Draco, my pulse racing, my knees pressed hard against the floor of the shower cubicle.
Draco would have liked to have locked the door to St Swithins Crescent and never left again, but real life wasn’t like that. Every morning the sun rose, and the world continued, just the same as it always had before. Draco’s life had to continue alongside it.
They stop again after a while, far away from the others, eyes across the darkening sea as the sun sets at their backs. Harry feels touched by the beauty of this unfamiliar sight, wondering why they don’t Apparate to the seaside more often.
Draco picked up another couple of leaflets, added them to his pile, and then he walked away, as quick as his legs could carry him.
“What type of wix buys these?” I asked George, feeling a little scandalised as I examined a pair of handcuffs, enchanted only to be opened with a safe word.
as though he isn’t supposed to say it, as though it should be possible to come from Draco’s mouth with this posh accent of his.
My colleagues at Phoenix know that something has changed. My boss, Jules – thirty-three, a brain-box Ravenclaw, as sharp as a hex – thinks that I’m courting and has teased me about it when we’ve been employed together in the broomstick workshop, polishing and waxing the wood to a high gleam. “Who’s the lucky man?” he asked me only yesterday. “Don’t think you’ve got us fooled, Potter. You’ve been staring off into space, mind a million miles away. Is he a wizard or a Muggle? Spill the beans! When do we get to meet this Mr Mysterious?”
felt like too much. Knowing their gender meant that he’d begin to think about names. Children needed names. Children needed fathers, and Draco wasn’t sure yet that he could fulfil that role.
Draco laughed at these prudish, narrow-minded voices. So what if he was a cockslut? Wasn’t that better than the Ministry men, who’d lain down like lambs for Voldemort? Wasn’t that better than the bigots who’d brought their world to near ruin? Draco wasn’t about to listen to their old-fashioned pure-blood notions. He’d rather be the biggest cockslut in London than a hypocrite.
busy. I can’t be the only one of his clients that have gone on to fall in love with him. Perhaps it is an occurrence that happens often.
Potter couldn’t be the nice chap he seemed. It was impossible. Nobody could be as good, as genuine as Harry seemed. Draco decided to test him. He’d prove that, beneath Potter’s genial veneer, he was just like Fitzgerald.
“I don’t know,” he admitted, fiddling with his clothes until his bump was on display, “this makes it a little bit too real. Once I see them, I’ll know they’re really there… It’s just- it just feels so surreal - good surreal – but this is it, isn’t it? The start of a whole new life for me.”
It reminded me of the fact that my own experiences – when it comes to sex that is not work – are rather limited. I’m not used to making it about myself as well as the man I’m with. At least not to the same extent.
Oh, bloody hell, I loved it. I loved it so much. I almost came just from the way he was holding me. And how his potent magic thrummed through my body! Such powerful magic streams through Harry’s veins and often enough, he seems hardly aware of that.
“Get the fuck off me,” Draco yelled, flinching away from Harry’s touch. “I’ll hex you! Don’t you dare fucking touch me!”
The realisation dawns in Harry that Draco’s distance and his calm is a form of care, and he finds himself huffing an agitated laugh in lieu of answering Draco or voicing a thanks. After another deep breath, Harry lies back down, a few inches away from Draco, but he takes his hand and presses a kiss to the jut of his knuckles. “You’re very patient with me,” Harry says, and the words elicit a sad but kind smile on Draco’s face.
and Harry tries it. It opens to a room cluttered with a hotchpotch of different things, ranging from cabinets and armchairs to clocks, books, quills, and teapots. Several things move around or float through the labyrinth of less agile objects on display, and Harry senses at least a few
“Thus I bought this place-” Draco gestures to the room- “wrote my thesis here, organised the funeral for Mother, ran all those-” he huffs a laugh- “
My Mind Healer shook his head. “No,” he answered. “Not at all. You’re a good man who did something very wrong, but everything isn’t lost, Harry. Draco and you are going to have a baby very soon, and they are going to need both of their fathers in their lives. You have a real chance here to give that baby a good life, but you have to be willing to work with Draco to build a relationship anew. You need to start again but think of the opportunity you’ve been given. Imagine it’s a wand that’s been broken. With the right attention most can be fixed, and then they’ll be stronger than ever before. They’ll cast differently - you’ll have to relearn some of your spells – but it is still the wand that you chose. I doubt that Draco can ever forget what happened but perhaps you shouldn’t either. This is an opportunity to do things better, Harry, and to build a life based on mutual respect and communication. Be the man that Draco needs you to be.”
Love him they do, but do they like him? Do they enjoy spending time with him? Have they ever spent a few hours just talking to him, talking like he used to do with Tarquin, and now with Draco? They seat him at the table, busy with their own lives without any time left that would be spent with
“I just said that, didn’t I? Do keep up,” Harry countered, cleaning his glasses with the cuff of his jumper. “If we’re really going to pull this off, then you need to be quicker on the uptake than that! The Pansy Parkinson I remember from school was as quick as a whip and twice as cutting. Come on Draco, it’ll be a giggle! I’ve always wanted to see how the snake side of London lives. Will there be those fancy little hors d’oeuvres? Please say they will. Merlin, but I can eat a dozen of those and still have space for dinner.”
But boring, straightlaced old Harry still seemed interested in him. Draco couldn’t fathom it, not really. He didn’t treat Harry differently to any other acquaintance, but for some reason, Harry’s invites kept arriving.
Sometimes Harry could barely keep himself from Disapparating right on the spot. In fact, Harry would have stopped coming altogether if it weren’t for the Draco Malfoy, he’d get a glimpse of once Malfoy ran out of scathing remarks, apparently unable to stop himself until he was finished recalling the news reports.
And Harry laughs with them, incredulous and oddly happy to be here and to be alive with his arm around Draco’s waist and Draco’s warm palm on his thigh; with Andromeda who’s not familiar but not quite a stranger, but who he believes might become family again.
” I didn’t dare though. He might have said that he already had, and I don’t think that I could have borne to hear those words leave his mouth.
He wanted to use his fingers first, but I insisted that he should lube his prick up nice and well for me, no prep. Circe, but I won’t forget the way he looked at me then. So completely and openly turned on, his lips parted, giving me a docile nod. Usually I would have gladly accepted, but I knew this bloke would be careful not to rip me apart. And that’s exactly how it went. I lay on my stomach, James on top, and his arms were aligned with mine as he pushed inside of me, breaching me inch by inch, and it felt so good and careful, yet more decisive than that guy has been the whole evening.
I moved to sit astride him, on his thighs for now. I summoned the lube, and I started running my hands up and down our lengths, rubbing our pricks together, slick and perfectly horny for Potter. I didn’t see anything happening below the swell of my bump, but I didn’t need to. I know his prick, know what he likes, and I moved my fingers and my own cock against him.
All that matters is our plum. Our baby that the Healers and Mediwizards all assure us is growing happily and perfectly, and who is thriving under the new regime of donated magic. Draco is very keen to keep the circumstances of how they were conceived a family secret, and not let on to any of our friends that we’re no longer a couple, and I will absolutely respect his wishes. I’ve stripped Draco of enough pride already.
says,” he points out. “That the great Harry Potter is such a good example of a wizard and that his bonhomie is unchallenged. That he has a big heart even for Death Eater scum like you.”
I’m not letting him. For once, it feels just completely undignified and also, I’m not sure where my body wants to take too many touches. Potter kisses my cheek before he leaves for work and when he comes back, and that’s sometimes hard enough to digest. I swear, one of these days, I’ll turn my head to get a peck on the lips instead.
“I’m not sure why you’re this angry,” I answered, keeping my voice low and calm, as if I were talking to a spooked horse. “It seemed like the most practical thing to do, Draco. You’ve a baby – you’ve our baby - on the way, and they’ll be here in the world in a matter of weeks. Your plum will be here, in your arms. They’ll be your fresh start. The last thing you need are debts anchoring you to the past. It was such a small amount too… All I wanted to do was give you your freedom. Give you the breathing space to make a few choices of your own.”
They stand there in the kitchen for long minutes, arms wrapped around each other, both of them shivering in their dank clothes. Their bodies slot together like they are meant for just that.
Between kisses and words of adoration, they lost their clothes and their inhibitions. When Harry asked whether they should kill the lights, Draco seemed outraged at the idea, but then he asked Harry tenderly if he was okay with the lights staying on. “Want to see you,” Draco muttered, eyes on Harry’s chest and his hands buried in Harry’s hair.
, Harry wants to say, but instead he asks, "How am I supposed to promise something like that? On some days I'm feeling at the top of the world because of you. And on others I feel like the most pathetic scum in the universe. It’s . . . I’m . . ."
When Harry started talking, Teddy was still looking at him, interested, but now his eyes have dropped down into his lap.
Would someone ask, Harry would still refer to them as his best friends. Only that he’d have to add another name to the pair. Perhaps two names. Harry wants to move on, but he has no wish to forget Tarquin.
if it gets too awful. But I bet half the folks would cheat. Either enchant their voice or befuddle the audience."
“Fancy, huh?” Draco gives a smirk and pulls Harry closer and closer until Harry is sitting astride his lap. “He was Dutch. Same sex marriage was legalised in the Netherlands in 2001. So we married the same month it was legalised.”
