Draco kept staring at him, his lips parted a little as he breathed gently. “You heard?”
Draco gave him a once-over and promptly looked away with a faint blush. Up close like this, Potter’s exposed skin was a little too much to handle. He was not used to looking so much of that golden skin in the daylight. Potter seemed to notice this reaction and Draco caught him smirking from the corner of his eyes.
Ron rolled his eyes and took a gulp of his orange juice. “By pestering your former enemy, sure. The last time you tried to engage him in a conversation after class, Malfoy actually looked terrified, you know.”
“One last question,” Draco whispered. “Did you ever see me in your future, even once?”
“She said the prince’s hair is so soft,” she translated. “And she will definitely brag to her friends about touching your hair.”
“Bima, out!” Gita shouted from the edge of the field.
Harry’s response missed a couple of beats as his hand stopped its soft caress. “You’re getting married?”
Draco shook his head again, trying to let go of his lingering disbelief. “I never knew you could have a link to connect your magical core and your child’s,” he breathed, completely in awe.
Harry would sit with them, attempting to do his own studying. Emphasized on attempting because he barely ever got anything done and his friends, especially Hermione, were not very impressed. Mentally, Harry convinced himself that it wasn’t his fault that studying became incredibly unappealing after the War. It was unbelievable. They fought in the life and death situation, and now they were expected to just go back being normal students?
As a start, Draco brought his journal to the place where they watched
Malfoy sighed again. “Forgiven. Now pay attention to your potion.”
“What did she say?” Draco asked, hesitantly peering into the girl’s huge brown eyes. “What does
“Um, I…,” Harry stammered awkwardly. “I’ll find you a plane ticket.”
“Fuck. I’m ready now.” Harry paused to moan. “Please.”
Harry didn’t have a comeback for that because, for one, they were right, Harry was very reckless this time. The thing was, the whole thing had been supremely stupid that Harry was too embarrassed to even talk about it. But of course, his friends wouldn’t let him go that easily.
Before he knew it, Draco was dragged to sit in the middle of the gazebo by a group of excited little girls. With half a dozen of them surrounding him, Draco couldn't be sure if he regretted his decision or not. All the girls were squealing and shrieking excitedly, the more aggressive ones from the group were fighting each other to climb his lap while the others contented themselves by playing with Draco’s loose hair. Draco, not able to understand what they were saying to him let alone tell them off, could only sit there, flushed and just a tad mortified.
Harry took his time processing the information. “I didn’t know you can pass that kind of trait through generations. If you have an alpha child in the future, will they be like that too?”
Slightly arching his eyebrow, he gave Harry a tired look but then relented with a sigh.
“Potter,” Draco gritted out, effectively making Harry halt on his track. “Don’t. Just stop.” Draco waved his wand and the last piece of clothing flew from their closet to his open trunk. Another wave and his trunk was shut with a slam before levitating toward him. “This is it, then. Our farewell. Thank you for everything in the past years,” Draco said, his voice emotionless.
Why couldn’t they?
Malfoy went after him in concern when he thought Harry needed help, didn't hesitate to offer Harry a hand despite how uncomfortable it must have been for him, and he tried so hard to make sure he didn't take advantage of Harry while he couldn't think straight. The alpha could have just taken him, and with how much Harry had shamelessly begged him, Harry wouldn't even hold it against him; but he hadn’t. Malfoy didn't go beyond helping Harry relieve his need. Malfoy, an alpha with the most divine scent Harry had ever smelled, refused to take an omega in heat, practically offered in front of him. Harry knew no suppressant could give any alpha that much self-restraint.
The eyes behind those glasses were impossibly green when he gasped, “Harry.”
“Draco,” Draco gasped breathlessly. “
He left and Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at each other.
It was an unsettling look on Malfoy. And while Harry didn’t exactly miss his sneer, he knew there could be a better expression on Malfoy’s face. Like that carefree, unbidden smile he had when Harry saw him in the Owlery.
“We all had two weeks for that assignment!”
“What’s this?” she asked as she caught the object, her tone curious.
Draco took it and gave a gentle squeeze. “It’s nice to meet you, too,” he said politely.
They stayed in their bed until the sun was high, the temperature rose as the day rolled, forcing them to untangle themselves from each other as the heat became unbearable. They missed their usual breakfast with Gita and Meme but they couldn’t bring themselves to care. After washing up, they were out to walk around the village, no destination in mind.
But finally, he was ready to unreveal more secrets Harry kept from him. On the afternoon of his third day in Ajawera, Draco walked out of his cottage to make his way to another side of the village. The gazebo Gita used to teach her students.
Draco would have let out a breath of relief that Engel’s arrival to his house proved the first rumour was the true one, that Potter was away all this time to do some ridiculously noble deeds in Merlin knows where, but the initial news struck him again.
, you say
Draco didn’t understand what was happening at the moment, and from the stare Harry gave him, he was likely as lost as Draco, but Draco knew this was something to cherish. Something so rare and precious.
So Harry took a step back. He wanted nothing but to clear up the misunderstanding between them, but before that, he first had to find an answer to Malfoy’s question. What did he want from his ex-rival?
“Mr. Potter, it’ll be easier for me to run a proper diagnosis and treatment if you cooperate and truthfully tell me where it hurts for you,” she said with the most unimpressed face Harry's ever seen. He winced again at that.
Malfoy arched his brow in mild interest. “Here as in…?”
It was a wide clearing on the top of a low hill with a cliff at the west side of it, facing the sunset. In the middle of it, men were stacking a huge pile of firewoods while the women separated themselves to one side on the clearing to organize the pots they brought here. All around them, the kids were merrily running around in their beautiful traditional clothes.
—he would play chess with Ron, and casually tease him for losing as though they had been doing it throughout their schooling years.
am the old one.”
Before Draco could let his thoughts wander to more inappropriate places, Gita and Meme emerged from the house, a big pot on Meme’s hands. Harry instantly moved to take it from her.
Draco shrugged unapologetically but decided to remain silent for the rest of the video. When it finally ended, he looked at Harry with a thoughtful expression.
The little boy squirmed from his curled up position before his head finally emerged fully from under the duvet. He blinked his huge, grey eyes open. “Father,” he mumbled, voice slurring from his slumber. “Morning.”
Harry didn’t know what to say. He thought that the relationship between Draco and his father was unlike normal parents and children relationships, if there was such a thing. It was Lucius Malfoy after all. But, having Draco confessing his feelings so unbounded, trusting, made Harry think of the situation differently.
Harry pursed his lips in thought. “I don’t know,” he said earnestly, shaking his head. “It’s just… it sounds beautiful. I want to hear it again.”
“That’s why we’re here, right? To have us in the present.”
“Malfoy,” Harry cut him. “I think that is it.”
Neville’s eyes followed his finger to see the blond, who indeed was still engaging in a Merlin-knows conversation with Hagrid. “I heard he’ll be teaching Potions starting today,” he said calmly, shrugging.
Whipping his head to the left, Harry found Neville peering at him curiously, his eyebrows raised. The sudden presence of his friend was somehow enough to distract him from his inexplicable turmoil, pulling him back to where he was.
“Mate, I
Suddenly, Gita threw her head back and laughed.
“Your immobile legs said otherwise.” Hermione threw him the same unimpressed look as the one his Healer gave. “That’s very reckless, Harry, even for you.”
“No,” he muttered meekly. “I think I’ll actually fall.”
“So, Mr. Malfoy, I believe I never got to inform you of my intention for this visit,” said Engel. “Mr. Potter had mentioned you in his will.”
A couple of weeks later, Harry has been thinking that there's something different from Draco. Subtle, but Harry notices nonetheless. And that's
If Harry had to be honest, that part completely slipped his mind. But now, having Malfoy said that while being surrounded by his scent, Harry felt his head spinning from the thought of it. Malfoy. Knot. In him.
When he was fully inside, Draco sighed from the familiarity of weight inside of him. He felt Harry pausing to let him adjust, and Draco clenched on him in return, making him groan. Understanding the silent message, Harry began to thrust.
“No way! You’re really working on it?” Ron’s eyes widened comically.
Draco smirked at Harry, but the man only smiled sweetly in return. “Don’t worry, Draco, I’ll let you cry on my shoulder when you inevitably lose.”
“I smell something burnt.” He heard Draco’s voice from the hallway. “Are you here?”
He sighed and tilted his head in a pensive way. “I’d like to get Mastery in Potions and maybe go back to Hogwarts for teaching.”
A moment later, Maya disappeared with a pop.
Harry shook his head. “No seriously, I want to know how you do it. All this self-control, I mean. You don’t act like an alpha, you’re supposed to be a threat to those kids, not the other way around.”
Draco gingerly took his journal from the crate. With slightly trembling fingers, he opened the cover page of it, and a little metal thing fell to the ground. Puzzled, Draco picked it up.
Draco laughed again while gently patting Harry’s cheek, a little puffed out from his pouting. “Of course I’m biased. I’m your husband, it’s my job to stop you from worrying about nothing like this.” He smiled kindly at him and raised himself up on his elbow. “And because you will not believe my so-called biased opinions, let me just show you how
As he expected, Harry didn’t give him an answer. He just made a dismissive noise and scooted closer. Draco knew it was his cue to stop asking, to stop trying to understand their past and predict their future. But Draco pushed his luck by asking the last one.
The intensity of fingers in his arse and delicious sucking on his cock soon became too much to handle. Draco felt his climax building fast, low in his belly. He tried to suppress another wave of shudder.
The lips pressing against his were gone faster than Harry would like, so he let his instinct lead him to lean forward, chasing them. The pressure was instantly back again, firmer this time.
Later, when Draco walked slowly with Harry to their shared cottage, he found that he couldn’t shake the new knowledge of magical core connection from his head. How would it feel, to have your magic linked to your parents’? He thought of himself as a kid, playing on the Manor’s ground. He soon realized that their parents wouldn’t need that kind of magic in the first place. Unlike here, no matter how far little Draco ventured, he would still be within the Malfoys’ property. And there would always be a couple house elves watching him, anyway. There was no need for Lucius Malfoy to personally use his magic and monitor his son all day.
and to let it show.
Draco hummed in affirmation.
But today, being Harry’s fortieth birthday, was special. This morning, Draco didn’t leave their bed. He had his head propped on his forearm, lying sideways facing his husband who was still sleeping soundly, his chest rising and falling gently with his even breaths. A soft smile crept up to Draco’s face.
“What?”
So, of course, after Teddy outgrew his phase of playing with toys all day, he had to drag Malfoy into his new source of entertainment. Lately, it was Muggle animations. The small boy was obsessed with Disney movies, and from the stories he enthusiastically told him, Harry had a suspicion that Malfoy might even be a bigger fan. Malfoy would never admit it without being forced to take Veritaserum, but that didn’t stop Harry from teasing him.
Draco knew he hadn’t been the best person throughout his life. He was a school yard bully, he'd said a lot of mean things to people who didn’t deserve it, and he made way too many wrong decisions before he even reached adulthood. Hell, that was a little bit of an understatement. He stood on the wrong side of the war, he knelt in front of a mad man who called himself the Dark Lord, and even took a Mark he knew he would spend his whole life regretting.
Bewildered, Harry looked at his broken vial and the remaining potion in his cauldron. He then turned to see Malfoy looking at him with comically wide eyes. He touched his hairy face again. “Well,” he scratched his newly grown beard sheepishly and looked at the still stunned Slughorn. “I guess my potion didn’t work the way it should?”
“Malfoy,” Hermione replied. Ron just sat there staring at him with suspicion.
If Harry’s cock wasn’t hardening embarrassingly quick beneath his robe at the moment, Harry would have hexed the blond git. “I swear to Merlin, Malfoy, if you don’t take me to your bed this very second, I’ll find a way to get you kicked out of here for real.”
“I feel like it should, but it doesn’t, which is scary in itself,” Harry said. “Are you scared?”
Malfoy returned his grin with a cheeky smile that looked so good on his pointy face that Harry swooned a little. “Alice fair in love and war, Potter,” he said. “Now go to the hospital wing, you look ridiculous with all that hair.”
“Draco.”
“Are you ready, dear?” Molly asked, offering her arm.
And that's why Harry and Draco sat shoulder to shoulder on the couch watching a YouTube video that evening. Draco seemed to be very fascinated, asking Harry about all foreign icons on the website (
The raw vulnerability in his face knocked the breath out of Harry. A strong urge to pull Draco into his arms and
So later in the evening, Harry pushed himself to execute his bring-happy-Draco-back plan. Well,
Gathering his Gryffindor courage, he slipped his hand between Draco’s fingers. The immediate grasp that answered him was a great relief. Draco turned to him with a little lopsided smile.
Potter suddenly broke into a blinding grin. “You sound like an owl,” he said as though he couldn’t be more pleased with his own joke.
Harry, startled, halted his steps, his tune cut abruptly. “What?”
“Harry,” Draco whispered.
“Ah, that one is just like Apparition. The kids think of the place and the magical link will let the parents know about the location. If they approve, the parents will send their kids there, and bring them back again when they think about their home. Or when it’s their time to go home, I guess.”
However, that slowly changed as they started living together. Harry began waking up earlier, most of the time just to complain about Draco being up before the sun began to shift. But, as the years passed by, enjoying their morning together gradually became a part of their  routine. Though Harry wouldn’t stop his habit of complaining about it—just for the sake of complaining. And Draco found it endlessly amusing.
But, if Malfoy’s name escaped his mouth when he came, Harry wouldn’t admit it until the end of time.
Flustered at being caught ogling, Harry quickly averted his gaze upward. He then remembered the gift he prepared before, still tucked in his pocket. “I have something for you.”
Slowly, Malfoy turned to him, but his expression remained skeptical. “So, you’re here to thank me for that?” he asked, still frowning.
In the middle of the constant bouts of arousal going through his burning body, Harry couldn’t think of
. Then, he swept his eyes through the room and locked at Harry, standing dumbly in the middle of absolute mess. In an instant, the concern on his face rose significantly, escalating to panic.
Hearing the word
Malfoy threw a glance at Harry but he could only offer an apologetic look back.
Harry’s heart began to beat erratically.
“You want to be a teacher?”
A quiet laugh escaped him. “Honestly, I’m not sure, either. Maybe if not this, what else?”
Astoria pulled him into a warm embrace.
He looked at the parchment for one last time, carefully examining his name written in Potter’s distinctive script. He had no idea how it could be there.
Draco smiled and caressed the cover before opening the journal to read Harry’s next letter.
Molly, still partly shocked from the ungraceful fall, watched him holding Harry securely, her mouth agape. The expression in her face quickly changed to that of a happy and proud mother in a second. She moved to wrap both of them in a bone-crushing hug.
He held his left arm out to Malfoy instead and slapped the toy to his wrist. The long plastic curled around it in a way that resembled a bracelet.
Harry’s smile grew a little wider, more earnest. “She sounds like a nice woman.”
Suddenly, the rush dissipated, the fire gradually died down, leaving fiery embers in its waking. The heat was now steady and constant. Harry rocked into him slowly, as though savoring each stroke, and Draco let every wave of pleasure ripple through his body. They moved together in sync, always meeting the other in the middle. Two bodies merged into one.
He stared at the cover for a moment. It was a handsome journal, rich brown with golden vines decorating the soft surface of its cover. His mother gave it to him for his sixteenth birthday, a medium for him to pour his feelings, she said. A little smile curved on his lips from the thought of her. He flipped the journal open, his fingers stroking his old writings. Most of the entries were from the war, the last one being the night after Lucius was convicted guilty for his deeds and sentenced to a life long in Azkaban.
“Can you not—” Malfoy rubbed his temple exasperatedly. “You’re infuriating enough without a sound, Potter.”
Maya turned to Gita as if asking for permission. The woman just raised her eyebrows and nodded. Almost hurriedly, Maya grabbed Draco’s hand and shook it with immense enthusiasm. When she let go, she waved her hand with a high-pitched squeal, as though shaking hands with her prince was the best thing she ever experienced.
It was Malfoy’s turn to look confused. Slowly, he uncrossed his arms and frowned. “Well, I touched you that night.”
,” he said, his tone indignant. “What else was I supposed to do when Hermione told me you’re actively trying to end your life in my absence?”
“That’s a bit dramatic.”
Draco stepped into the kitchen and promptly froze on the spot.
Draco was ready to jump. “I want us to be real,” he said firmly. “I want to be with you.”
Harry turned to Draco with an arched brow. Draco shrugged.
It didn’t last too long nor too short. Both of them pulled away almost at the same time but stayed close, holding each other.
and I hate it.”
Tilting his head, Draco hummed in feigned deep thought. “You know what, I changed my mind,” he said slowly, his voice carrying a teasing edge in it. “Since you think you’re just too old and
Harry squirmed slightly from the sound, stirring awake. With the morning light falling on his husband’s  scrunched up face, Draco had to restrain himself from swooning.
“That sounds amazing,” Draco said, titling his head. “But a sacred ritual? Are you sure it’s okay if we come?”
?” Draco cocked his head and regarded Harry intently, the smile on his lips soft. “You don’t know?”
The shift between them was subtle, a little unexpected, but yet very welcomed. None of them expected to see a friend in Draco Malfoy before, yet here they were now, making a space for the odd and surprisingly caring person in their lives.
They spent the next hour walking around what could probably be lush woods if only there was less snow and more green leaves, Harry cursing under his breath every time a cold wind swept them and Malfoy wisely ignoring him. At one point, Harry asked him to stop for a minute because his body was shivering too much to cast a new Warming Charm while moving. Malfoy obliged, but not without voicing his irritation.
“Winning never felt so unsatisfying,” Ron said to him. “You should try talking to him, mate.”
Draco’s hand found its way to Harry’s hair, absently entangling the strands. “Well, the Greengrasses agreed to my marriage proposal. I have to finish reconstructing my house before the courtship period ends.”
“There are other places if you are just looking for the sun.”
Harry didn’t say anything. However, he let himself move on impulse again and raised his arm to curl around Draco’s back, protective and secured.
Malfoy smiled softly at him. “Well, I can’t spend all my time studying, Potter, that wouldn’t be healthy.”
“No.”
Draco put his hand on Scorpius’s still puffed out chest and inhaled deeply, concentrating on a thread of magic he got really familiar with in the past years. Immediately knowing what was going on, Scorpius followed his lead and placed his plump palm on Draco’s chest, right on his sternum. Together, they synchronized their breathing.
It’s not like Harry was jealous of his colleague. Okay, maybe he was
The corner of Harry’s eyes crinkled from his smile. “Of course I haven’t,” he said quietly, “I don’t think I could put it into words.”
He turned defensive in an instant. “Well, I-”
Draco loved it the way it was. For him, it felt like the time stopped when they were not together, a mere blurry period when nothing mattered, and it unfroze by the time they reunited in the private of Harry’s tiny apartment.
Nodding, Harry turned to Draco and grinned. “So can you leave your protective shade and join me around tomorrow?” he questioned playfully.
“You’re welcome, Potter,” Malfoy replied with a grin.
Right after Draco said that, Scorpius stumbled on his own feet and fell face first to the floor, his limbs tangled with his brand new broom. Astoria rushed to him, but Scorpius just sat up and looked at his parents with a sheepish grin.
He mentally cursed himself for letting his thoughts stray and cleared his throat lamely. “So yeah, I present to you, a slap bracelet.”
“An older lady asked me for help. She came to our home this morning… she said her cat ran away to that building and, you know, she wanted me to fetch the cat for her because, you know, the building…” Harry trailed off as he recalled the ridiculous series of events that was his day. He was disappointed in himself that he had fallen for such an easy trap, and prepared for the mouthful from Draco.
“For how long?”
Harry, who stood in the middle of the field, seemed to realize this as well. “Oh, this is going to be interesting, Malfoy,” he said challengingly before calling his own team member to pass him the ball.
“I forgot to tell you,” Gita said to Draco and Harry. “There’s an annual event coming up in two days. It’s an old tradition of this village, you should come and join us.”
“Quit being so dramatic, Potter.” Malfoy rolled his eyes. “I’ll help”
like an alpha. He didn’t even know Malfoy presented as an alpha, considering they hadn’t seen each other in years. The last time he saw the man was at his trial after the war when the two of them were just about to be eighteen. It was over five years ago.
But some nights, like this particular one, they were invited to one of the villagers’ houses for a pleasant dinner with the local families. And like always, they brought Gita to help translate the conversation with their host.
Harry saw in the corner of his eyes how Draco’s eyebrow twitched and something flashed in his eyes. Not anger. No, something softer, less dangerous but still promising something.
Slowly, he returned his wife’s embrace. “I’ll always be fine for the two of you,” he replied quietly. “Just stay here for a little longer, will you?”
What welcomed him was an almost empty vault with just small heaps of coins in one corner, next to them was a stack of wooden crates. Draco knew the Potters weren’t nearly as wealthy as the Malfoys used to be, but he knew there should have been more than this.
“Please,” Harry said, because what else could his brain come up with at a time like this?
“Maybe you spend too much time taking care of those blockheads over there to focus on your own study,” Malfoy had suggested lightly, pointing at Ron and Harry.
Draco smiled at her in understanding. “I can’t imagine anyone hating this place.”
“I know. It’s not that I want to protect you or…” Harry paused. “Well, I do want to protect you, but I don’t mean you’re not capable of doing it yourself.” He stopped again, searching the grey eyes. “I really loved all the time we shared this year. I didn’t expect it at first, but I enjoy your company a lot. I thought it would be amazing if we still could share that company even after Hogwarts.” He pushed the last bit out in a whisper, “please let me stay with you.”
“You’ll need this, trust me,” Malfoy said. “It’s okay if you change your mind now.”
Their lips met in a painfully soft touch, barely a peck, but neither tried to deepen the kiss. They stayed there, just inhaling each other in, and Harry never felt anything as intimate as that.
“Well, that’s really unfortunate that you think that way, sir,” Draco drawled. “You seem to offer great insight, and I'm sure Harry appreciates your concern, and will spend much time thinking over your words.”
She stopped in front of him. “Harry.”
But Potter was staring at him with a pair of hopeful green eyes, peering almost innocently from behind his long lashes. Draco hated himself for succumbing to those pleading eyes. He inhaled deeply before gritting out, “Who’s there.”
“I believe Harry would love to hear more about your—ah, perspectives, but I’m afraid I need to take Harry from you now. You see, everyone wants a piece of their savior, it wouldn’t be fair to them if they couldn't get a chance to talk to him tonight because one old nobody was hogging him.” Draco said, his tone impossibly polite and yet still sneering at the rude man.
“I’m so happy for you, boys,” she whispered vehemently before letting go and walking to where Arthur was standing.
When Harry looked up at Slughorn, he found horror in his teacher’s face—while his own felt all tingly and just a bit like it was burning.
“What did one plate say to the other?” he blurted out.
Of course, Malfoy knew what he needed.
Harry caught a tiny flick of Draco’s wrist before he moved to usher them both away from Grinspoon. “If you excuse us.” Draco’s voice was very mannerly and posh. “And oh, sir? I think you've got something in your teeth.”
“Don’t be, it’s okay,” Draco said, his hand found its way to thread the soft strands of Harry’s dark, curly hair. “Does it make sense if I told you it’s different now? Us, I mean?”
“Does it hurt here?” the female Healer with fading green hair asked him.
“Don’t you have other things you want?”
“Oh! They’re back!” Gita exclaimed, prompting Draco to turn around to find Meme and Harry walking side by side, a few sacks of newly harvested crops levitating behind them.
Harry should have thought this confrontation through and planned better.
Malfoy’s smile just widened when he noticed he’d gotten Harry’s attention. With deliberate slowness, he produced his wand from his sleeve and started waving it around in the most graceful movement Harry could dare to imagine. He felt his breath hitch as the ice crystals swirled around Malfoy, obeying whatever command the man gave them.
It was the moment that Draco decided he didn’t want to let go. He didn’t want this to end. He wanted to be with Harry, sitting next to him as their magic beat in sync, smiling with him, calling him by his name and having Harry call him by his own. As though they were the same person, one soul split into two, a pair of pieces that make one whole picture.
“I don’t have to be married.”
“I think I’ll just—”
Smiling to himself, Draco looked at the nice people around him once again before glancing at Harry at his side. Lucky didn’t even cover half of it.
Draco realized that nothing changed in Ajawera. The fields were as green, the sky as blue, the sun as hot, the people as friendly, their smiles as welcoming. But it was still a surprise to find that the cottage he once shared with Potter was exactly as Draco remembered when he left it. Still this handsome little building, just a bit more worn down from the years. The inside didn’t change much either. Every piece of furniture was still in the same spot it was seven years ago.
Then he let Harry pull him into their bed.
Harry couldn't help a feeling that there was something more to it.
Simple enough. Harry certainly could do this. If Draco was willing to go extra miles to ensure their special day would be comfortable for him, Harry could do his part without messing it up.
“Harry…” Draco stared at him wide-eyed. “You can’t do that.”
“You don’t owe me anything, Malfoy,” Harry said with a frown. He didn’t like Malfoy thinking this friendship as a favour Harry did for him. It wasn’t right.
Draco didn’t reply. He slowly tried to control his breath again, inhaling deeply and exhaling noisily through his mouth. A few moments later, he dropped his hand that was gripping on Harry’s upper arm and took a step back. He looked up to meet Harry’s eyes. Those grey eyes were no longer flashing with anger, they only seemed frustrated, with a tiny bit of relief in them.
He had made decent progress on Transfiguration, Charms, and DADA—thanks to Draco’s patient tutoring and Hermione’s insistent pushing—but things were still quite bleak for his Herbology and Potions progress. Especially Potions. There was just too much subtlety and way more materials than he could ever dream to master. Draco scoffed at him this morning at his negative thought, saying that he had time to learn enough and get an acceptable grade.
in her hand. Upon seeing Draco come, she put the newspaper on the table, facing down to hide the headline from him, but not fast enough.Draco saw a glimpse of unruly dark hair and a pair of round glasses on the front page.
And with him being raised in a traditional pureblood family, he does have a whole lot of muggle world to discover.
Potter’s smile turned into a wide grin for a reason Draco couldn’t fathom. If he had to be honest, it scared him a bit as he tried to lean back in his chair.
That plan involved him slipping into the ever empty seat next to Malfoy in their shared Potions class, just in time for Slughorn to open his mouth to start their lesson. Malfoy turned his head at the unwelcomed addition to his table with wide eyes.
Harry had seen many unlikely things happened before, being the Chosen One in a stupid prophecy and all that crap. But he was still appropriately amazed with how Malfoy so effortlessly blended into his life, even accomplishing the once impossible task of befriending Hermione and Ron.
Harry laughed. “Don’t worry, we have our translator,” he said. “Speaking of.” He looked ahead at their narrow path.
The hand on his neck held firmer as Draco leaned in slowly. So slow that Harry was sucked into the rhythm of his heartbeat, closer and closer. Draco’s eyelids fluttered closed, obscuring the mesmerizing pale eyes behind them, and Harry followed.
was easy enough, but it was hard to get a chance to reach the square where he had to stack them. Harry’s team was relentless with their shots, passing it quickly and throwing the ball with decent accuracy. Before he knew it, Draco had lost half of this team and only half of the
“I’m sorry they’re not here to be with you,” Harry said in the end.
Sweet and beautiful Scorpius, so kind and perceptive. Draco felt his heart aching as he ruffled Scorpius’s hair affectionately, wondering what he did to deserve such a perfect angel. “I’m fine, dearest. I just didn’t get much sleep last night.”
“My fault.” Gita shook his head. “I brought a lot of storybooks about western fairytales to teach English to the kids around here, ones with blond princes riding white horses. I believe she got that from there,” she said, grinning. “There might be many blond foreigners in the other parts of Bali, but I’m afraid your kind is quite rare to find in Ajawera, Draco.”
Harry did not know before, but he did now. And he relished the way that knowledge made him the happiest in a very long time, even more than when he had discovered he loved Draco.
Harry grinned from ear to ear, seemingly way too pleased with the idea, and slung his arm around Draco’s shoulders casually. “Well, a good prince won’t disappoint his princesses, right?” he teased.
, that scent. “Malfoy,” Harry moaned, pulling Malfoy closer to him, wanting to breathe him in.
kaburan
Harry looked up and caught Malfoy walking towards the table, the students trailing after him finally gone. The Potions professor cast a glance at Harry, head slightly tilted and brows furrowed in puzzlement. When Harry felt those grey eyes on him, another powerful wave of arousal hit him. Suddenly, it was getting hard to breathe.
Gita wasn’t surprised to find him suddenly appear at her door. If anything, she seemed to be expecting him. The witch looked almost as youthful as he remembered, still the petite woman with warm smiles and playful energy around her. Draco never realized that he hadn’t let himself miss this old friend for all this time.
Draco stopped folding his shirt, frozen in thought for a moment. “No,” he said at last. “I’ll Portkey back home.”
When he decided to quit his Auror training, he didn’t right away think his next move would be begging Minerva McGonagall to give him a job, or else he would drown himself in self-pity because he was the last one of his peers without any plan for his future. But that was what he ended up doing, after two failed attempts at ministry work and one embarrassing venture as a Quibbler journalist later, he was more or less a desperate unemployed wizard with too many expectations on his shoulders. To Harry’s delight, the headmistress was more than happy to let him fill the ever cursed position of the DADA professor in Hogwarts.
Harry laughed again, quietly. Draco hadn’t been an hour in this foreign place but he already loved it. There was something here that shifted whatever was between the two of them. Maybe it was the air, or the tropical heat, or the fact that no one here knew or cared about who they were. The liberated feeling was reflected in the easy way Potter laughed, how much he smiled, his light posture, and Draco could feel it affecting him as well.
The way Hermione said his name was enough to tell him that something was wrong. “What happened?” He could feel anxiety creeping out in his system.
Engel cleared his throat and Draco was jerked back from his thoughts.
However, it couldn’t reach Draco. He would have laughed at the irony, if only he had any energy left for such playful expression. The War had drained him empty. He had lost everything one could possibly be stripped off of. His belief, his trust for his parents, his pride, his future. It wouldn’t be long until they took the rest away. His family’s wealth, the ground he was standing on, his family’s name.
“You really talk a lot.”
knot him.
He lost track of time. The whole world blurred beyond them, leaving just the two souls intertwining in their sacred ritual. In that moment, the pain they suffered in the past and would suffer again in the future stopped matter. It was just them, Harry and Draco, in the present, and in
Harry looked up to meet his grey eyes, trying to appear defiant. "I know I'm right."
Draco let out a low, incredulous laugh. “You’re the one starting it.”
“This is amazing, Father! Best birthday ever!”
Draco knew his attempt of answering the question himself would only lead to more questions arising. Resolutely, he flipped to the next page.
Then, the game took an unexpected turn. Draco was a couple steps from the square and Harry was one breath away from throwing the ball when Maya, who was sorted to be in Harry’s group, tackled the dark-haired to the ground, effectively aborting the shot.
Harry’s cheeks flamed in embarrassment. Thinking about it, his kitchen did look like a crime scene with the red batter splattered all over the place. “Hey, stop laughing, I didn’t know baking would be this hard, okay?” he muttered defensively.
“Then what would you do on those rainy days?” Harry whispered, leaning in to press their foreheads together.
“Shit.” Harry tried to duck behind his kitchen counter as red velvet batter in the baking pan exploded violently from his spell. It was too late though, the sticky substance had found a way to his face and most of his shirt a second faster.
“Harry.” he looked at him straight at the eyes. “You don’t have to change anything. There is nothing wrong that you want to be more than friends, it doesn’t have to change what you have built so far. You know what? I think I might even strengthen it,” he said, his tone serious. “So what if you want to kiss Draco? You can still have both the friendship and kisses. Well, that is, as long as Draco wants the same thing, which I personally believe he does.”
“Come in,” Malfoy’s voice called from the opposite side of the door.
“I’m down,” Harry answered quickly as he put a scrawny boy to sit on his shoulder, apparently had adapted well enough with the mini wizards and witches ambushing him. “But I don’t know about Draco. The prince is a little delicate.”
“I know perfectly from our Hogwarts days how much of a sore loser you are. Can’t gracefully accept your defeat even after all this time?”
Finally, Harry blinked his eyes open, the green orbs reflected nothing but sorrow and guilt. Gone that unidentifiable emotion that Draco read as love. “You’re hurt after the war, and I… I was, too. We wanted each other,” he said slowly. “We were tired, we needed a break. We’re just… we fit like a glove.”
Scorpius tilted his head. “Bad dreams?”
“You’re supposed to say who’s there,” Potter said.
A few minutes of an unhurried walk later, they arrived in their little cottage. It was a tiny building, erected at the end of the dirt path right next to the woods. Gita said an elderly couple built it years ago, in hope their son would be back with a bride after he tried his chance in the city. The son did get married, but never returned, making the cottage pretty much abandoned after the elderly couple died and no one came to claim it as their inheritance. It was a sad story, that this lovely little cottage, very traditional yet cozy, was never loved. And now this place would witness their farewell and Draco’s heartbreak.
“Of my birthday!”
“I wonder if you’re as wet now as when you’re in heat,” Malfoy said, voice deeper than usual.
“Yes, Hermione, I am listening,” he sighed.
“Merlin, Harry,” he tried to speak in the middle of his roaring laughter. “You almost gave me a heart attack, you look like you just murdered someone. What on earth are you thinking?”
“Of course, the Portkey here is only registered for local administration. No one could get that data to know we are here.”
“I—I’m okay. This is actually just cake batter,” Harry said quietly as he scooped a little of that substance on his cheek with his finger.
Draco cursed under his breath as he once again narrowly avoided getting hit by the ball. He ran to the other side of the field as he formulated a strategy inside his mind. If he could bait the opponents to throw the ball far enough from the square, he would have enough time to put that last
He felt Harry’s smile before he heard it in his voice. “Let’s have this, then.”
Harry huffed and moved away from Draco, rolling onto his back. “It’s because Witch Weekly is obsessed with this false image of the Savior that I’m not. I wouldn’t even be on their list if I was just some bloke,” he said with a deeper frown.
When he reached his quarters, slamming the door as he walked in, Harry threw his stuff carelessly to the ground and flopped onto his favorite armchair facing the fireplace. Tiredly, he ran his hand through his face and slouched deeper in his seat.
Draco chuckled quietly, either because of how naive he had been before or how pathetic he was right now to desperately cling to this one fantasy until the very last moment. He gave Harry his last smile, as sincere as he could muster.
"Oh, pray tell, then, Potter, how could you know what
been doing it properly?”
Malfoy obliged by adding two more fingers at once, stretching him open. Harry’s breath hitched when he felt the fourth finger teasing his rim. He looked at Malfoy wide-eyed.
Malfoy’s eyes flashed with something unreadable, something dangerous and feral, but it was gone the next second. He gulped visibly and stared at Harry, writhing under him without abandon. In the end, he sighed again. “Where do you keep your lube?”
Draco wanted to ask. Instead he just nodded in defeat.
Malfoy tilted his head—his signature thinking pose, Harry noticed—and looked thoughtful for a moment. “Every item could be used as a practical joke, Weasley, as long as you’re clever enough. If you add a few more spells, I believe you can make this thing latch unwavering on someone’s wrist for some amount of time and they would have permanent middle finger pose as long as they have it on.” He stopped to consider his idea. “I think it would be a brilliant joke if anyone can get it on a teacher in the middle of a class.”
Gita furrowed her brows at the girl and crouched down near her. She talked to her in their language, which the little girl answered with the same excitement as before, her finger pointing at Draco again. Draco could only exchange a confused look with Harry, who curiously watched the entire thing.
“I won’t, I promise. Let me go and I’ll help you.”
He could almost hear a smile in Harry’s voice when he replied, “I don’t know. It might be, later in the future.”
He hesitated in his steps when he realised he had company. Ron and Hermione turned to look and for a moment they were just staring at him while Malfoy uncomfortably fidgeted.
From this slick black suitcase, Engel produced a roll of parchment. “It was stated here that Mr. Potter wished for all his wealth to be donated to Ministry-run charities, while the remainder of his personal possession would be temporarily kept in the Gringotts until all donations of his monetary assets were made. You, Draco Lucius Malfoy, will have sole access to Potters’ vault for the time being.”
Draco tried to regain his breath as he basked in the post-orgasmic bliss, relishing the slow drag of Harry’s cock as he pulled out of him. Harry, also panting heavily, flicked his hand carelessly and Draco felt a tingling sensation of a Cleaning Charm wash over him. Yet another show of Harry’s powerful magic.
A wistful smile bloomed in Harry’s face. He raised his arms to circle around Draco’s neck. “Draco,” he whispered back. “Please move.”
“Something I used to do with Mother. When I was a child, we had this game where we try to make the most creative alternatives for good luck. Or just good wishes, generally. We came up with many things. Some of them were so pretentious but many were just outright ridiculous.” The small laugh he let out was fond, nostalgic. “It seems like you could do with some morale-boosting right now.”
“I wouldn’t expect any less from you honestly,” Malfoy replied with ease, a small grin curved on his lips.
Harry, still mesmerized by the stunning glitters raining from the sky, failed to answer him.
, Harry thinks absently.
Those lips were turned downward again this morning. They almost always were, as long as Harry remembered, at least since they returned for Eighth year. Before that, Harry remembered scowls, condescending smirks, and unkind grimaces. But today, the elves served a pile of perfectly toasted bagels, delicious sausages, and mouth-watering omelettes. There was no reason to frown at the nice plate of breakfast under his nose.
?” She turned to regard her waiting students and talked to them in their native language. A moment later, the little class erupted in another round of cheers and the children began running to Draco and Harry.
“But you’re obviously in pain, what…,” Malfoy trailed off, giving Harry a careful once over, from the sweat on his temples to his shivering body. Harry watched as a realization slowly dawned upon him, his grey eyes widened impossibly. “
He kneeled in front of Harry and hauled him up back to his feet, his lean body showing off the unexpected strength. He put a steadying hand on his arm. “You really made me go down on one knee twice just to marry you, huh? You’re playing very hard to get, Harry,” he said mirthfully, the edges of his eyes crinkling.
“Aren’t you?” Draco asked, amused. “What’s the matter?”
Before Harry could blink, Malfoy was out of the hall, practically running from the still interested spectators.
, right? At least not without him knowing. He had been watching him for so long, he would know if there was anyone else other than his friends around him.
“No, no, it’s fine.”
Draco didn’t know what to say. Did he have to say anything to that? Harry implied he didn’t love him, only loved the thrill of being with him. And passion dies, he said. They were too broken for each other. What did it mean?
“Go away, Malfoy,” he tried to spit but it came out as a half whine instead. A blush spread on his face.
Draco was still absently staring at his journal that he didn’t notice Harry shuffling behind him, peering over his shoulder.
"I'm not," answered Malfoy without missing a beat.
Confused, Draco turned to Harry again, silently asking if this was supposed to make sense. The man just shrugged. “I guess magic works differently in different places,” he said.
, made him feel even more nervous. He silently cursed Narcissa who adamantly denied them sharing one changing room. It would be less nerve-wracking to have Draco with him right now in person.
“No-no, you’re not, really,” Harry said hurriedly. “It’s-I just I didn’t expect you to notice anything. No one did before”
“Who.”
“Yesterday I failed my potions project on purpose and the detention I got was the best two hours of my life. His cold and mysterious side is just irresistible!”
This would never get old.
This had got to be a prank. The Gryffindor bunch must be so bored out of their minds since McGonagall ruled the Eighth year students out of the Quidditch Cup and tried to find a new source of entertainment. Draco wouldn’t put it past them to see harassing a former Slytherin bully as a good laugh. He just hoped they thought of something better than sending the Saviour himself to deliver impossibly bad jokes to him.
In his defense, Malfoy was objectively good-looking. He always had been—with his tall and lean body, fair complexion, strong bone structures, and always-perfect hair. Harry thought it was only natural for finding the blond attractive. Especially now that he stopped being a git, his good features were somehow projected more prominently because of it.
“Going to new places means I can meet new people,” Harry said, not quite answering the question.
“What the—,” Harry muttered as he got up, gently straightening Maya who fell with him to a standing position. “Maya, why did you do that?”
“I wish I could see you more like that.”
Meme led all of them to walk down a narrow path to the direction of the mountain. Soon, Draco felt the inclination of the path rose and they hiked higher and higher. As they walked, they met other families, on their way to attend
Despite the half-delirious state he was in, Harry remembered that night perfectly.
He ran his hand through the soft, curly hair. “Rise and shine, my Scorpion,” he whispered.
“I just want to know the truth.”
Instead, Draco decided to focus on the rest of the writing. How typical of the noble Harry Potter, Draco thought with a little disbelieving huff of laugh. Even when he was running toward his inevitable end, all he cared about was how he could bear all the burden instead of letting people take their share. Harry had carefully planned everything just to make sure his departure would not hurt as much for people he loved.
Harry stares hard at the blond's face and his gaze inevitably focuses on his thin, shiny lips. No, it's not shiny, it's
“Oh, nonsense, Harry! Of course you won’t!”
If Draco’s body heated up a bit, he blamed it on the blazing sun above his head.
Draco sighed, but he let Harry pull him into his arms and gently slumped over his still stiff shoulder. “I don’t know why I should trust you this time.” He muttered, drained. “For a moment I thought I lost you.” His voice was barely above a whisper, but being so close together, Harry heard it clearly.
No matter when his class started that day, McGonagall required all teachers and staff to be present in the Great Hall for breakfast. She reasoned that it was when she usually made her school-related announcements and she didn’t want anyone to miss them. But Harry thought it was more of a disciplinary measure of the strict headmistress than anything else. She just wanted the teachers to set a good example by being ready and presentable first thing in the morning.
Draco had stopped laughing completely, his pointy face softened by Harry’s rambling. “Well, I can’t buy this kind of mess anywhere, and likely won’t be able to create it myself even if I try my hardest,” he said with a playful grin, his eyes warm. He huffed another low laugh. “Oh, Harry, I love you so much.”
Gita took the pot back from Harry. “Go find yourself a spot. The ritual will mostly happen in the center area there, but the sunset will be as much of an attraction here as the dance. I’d recommend to sit somewhere there.” She gestured with her head to the east part of the clearing.
Harry frowned at him from where he sat on the couch. "Isn't that a muggle term for experts in makeup? Why you asked?"
Now, with his head clear, Harry knew exactly what he wanted. He wanted Malfoy, and not just because of his intoxicating scent or beautiful looks, but because of the way Malfoy treated him when Harry was in his most vulnerable situation.
He pulled Draco close by his pale, slender hand. “I’m so sorry, Draco. I didn’t mean to make you worry,” he said earnestly. “It won’t happen again, okay? I’ll be really,
The grey eyes stared at him so intensely that Harry had to consciously refrain himself from fidgeting. “Of course I do.”
But there was more to it. Despite this letter sounding like the final message, there were more pages filled with Harry’s writing left in his journal. Before Draco could flip to the next page, a voice called him.
After one more look around the place, Draco sat on the edge of the gazebo and opened the journal he carried with him, flipping to the next page after Harry’s first message.
Maya gasped and furrowed her brows in hesitation for a moment before moving to her knees to wrap her bony arms around Draco’s shoulder. “It’s okay, don’t cry.”
"Then what's your problem?"
“It won't happen again, okay? I’ll be careful next time,” he sighed.
It took Harry no less than ten seconds to kick his brain into functioning again. Snapping himself out of his dazed state, he scrambled to follow the graceful steps of Draco Malfoy, slipping on the slippery snow and almost falling for the fourth time that afternoon.
Harry wrapped his cloak tighter around himself, thickly layered with the Warming Charm he cast over it, and threw an annoyed look at Malfoy. Couldn’t the git just humour him a little? He did know where the Ministry was sending him, thank you very much, and he also did a little research—though maybe not from the source Malfoy or Hermione would approve. Of all people, he asked Ron about Lapland, and the redhead knowledgeably informed him that it was the home of Santa. Eager for an excuse for a getaway and intrigued by the promise of Christmas spirit, Harry applied for the assignment right away.
Ajawera, for some reasons, felt like a safe haven. A sanctuary.
“Good,” Malfoy panted, a smirk was heard in his voice.
Malfoy wouldn’t be happy about the invasion of his property, Harry thought distractedly.
However, even that simple wish was crushed as soon as he voiced it to his partner before their departure.
It didn’t matter anymore, did it, now that Potter was gone either way?
Draco bent his knees to hug his legs, still leaning on Harry’s side. “Thank you, Harry,” he said quietly. “It means a lot, you’re listening to me. And this,” he pressed closer, snuggling. “I kind of miss this. Pansy and Blaise are big fans of physical touches. We used to comfort each other by being close together. I didn’t realise how much I enjoyed it until they are no longer here.”
He was just considering going back to his dorm when Hermione and Ron appeared from between two bookshelves and walked toward him briskly.
Draco made a noise of agreement. It was amazing. Just when Draco thought he knew all about magic, was so familiar with it all his life, he was being reminded of the scope of it he was yet to discover.
“You’re going to go to the Slytherin table, aren’t you? You’ve been staring that way the whole breakfast,” Ron said flatly from his side. “You have to stop it, mate. You'll start to become obsessed again.”
“But you don’t feel nothing right now,” Harry guessed.
Draco wanted to point out that he was certainly not Alice, but it seemed to be an insignificant thing to say when Potter was in front of him pretending to knock on an imaginary door. He might as well be an imaginary character if he wanted.
They walked closely side by side, cold fingers brushing every other step. Harry longed to put that pale hand in his. He glanced sideways to Draco, finding the blond had his head tilted up to silently admire the stars blinking delicately at them.
Draco hummed his affirmation. “Early next year, most likely. Maybe by the end of winter or in the beginning of spring,” he said. “It was not an easy thing, finding the suitable bride, but the Greengrasses value honoring their promises more than anything else in the world. They somehow still want to go through the arrangement they made with my father long ago, even after all this.”
If he asked to stay, Harry would let him, right? After all, Draco had convinced himself that one unreadable emotion in Harry’s green eyes was love. It had to mean something.
Harry loved his job, he genuinely did.
With Malfoy’s help, Harry managed to walk the rest of the way to his quarters. But, when they finally reached it, Harry was too far gone to remember why he needed to be there in the first place.
“I’m calling you Draco from now on,” Hermione decided without waiting for confirmation.
“What?” he whispered, voice small.
Draco's frown deepens for a second before he breaks into a brilliant smirk in understanding. Brightening his already glowing little pointy face. "Oh, you mean—"
The man still looked unconvinced, but he started to let go of that threatening demeanor. “This has nothing to do with that,” Malfoy repeated slowly. “You’re telling me… you
“Why Bali?”
And there it was, the gentlest pressure on his lips, soft and sweet.
“True,” he replied after a pause. “I like it here, though. Far enough from anyone we know.”
He frowned. “I can defend myself,” he said, repeating his earlier words.
So here was Draco Malfoy, walking uncertainly with his suitcase on the unfamiliar ground of Ngurah Rai Airport, located in a city he didn’t even know exist until a few days ago when the plane ticket arrived at his door. Right now, he looked around the buzzing crowd of excited tourists from all over the world, trying to find the sender of the said ticket among them.
“Will you believe my argument now or do we have to go for another round?” Draco asked eventually, bringing up their debate from earlier. “Because honestly, I need a respite. Maybe
Harry leaned his head against Draco’s and sighed. “I don’t know.”
“Well, it will be our honor to join you then,” Harry said, his hand sneaking to casually stay on Draco’s thigh. He leaned in closer to softly whisper in Draco’s ear, “I didn’t think we could be any luckier, but here we are.”
Slowly, the light from Draco’s eyes dimmed. “I’m sorry… I must have been very boring lately, right?” he said quietly with a deprecating smile.
“What the fuck, Potter?” he snapped. “Can you not randomly—”
jealous, because how could Malfoy get to visit practically every corner of Europe while Harry had to patrol back and forth in Diagon Alley to be what they called
. They had shared countless kisses by now; hungry kisses in the middle of the night fueled by mere lust, kisses drove solely by their need to not feel alone, simple kisses here and there just because. Nothing felt like this kiss.
“Well, if suddenly there are kids harassing you to get a touch on that fine hair, you know who to blame,” said Gita, glancing at the grinning girl. She said something to Maya in their language, which Maya returned with a pout and a seemingly reluctant nod.
It was not like people in Ajawera didn’t know they were together, it’s not even that a same sex relationship was frowned upon here, but a public display of affection between lovers beyond innocent hugs was quite taboo. Draco knew the nearest house was almost a hundred meters away, and no one was likely to pass their cottage this late of the night, but he couldn’t help the nagging feeling that they were breaking some kind of local customs by kissing in the secluded darkness in their temporary property.
Astoria eyes the couple again, her face unreadable. “Well, we can’t ask the deceased for an explanation, can we? Let’s just be reasonable and move on,” she said flatly, her tone impassive.
Harry tried to ignore the spark of hope that surged in his chest at the end of Ron’s comment. Instead, he focused on the first part. “You really think it’ll work?”
“Pretty much, yeah,” Harry replied. “But it’s fascinating. I reckon that’s good enough for a toy.”
But right now, however, Harry seemed to have one mission in his head: to get them off as soon as possible without Vanishing them entirely. And he was doing a great job. One moment Draco was desperately trying to get Harry’s mouth to kiss him again, and then suddenly he found himself sprawled naked in the center of their queen sized bed, Harry’s broad body hovering over his, the emerald eyes dark with lust.
Harry let out a self-deprecating laugh. “Hah, I’m afraid that I really don’t, Malfoy.”
Harry snorted in return and decided that opening up to Malfoy was maybe not that bad of an idea. He cleared his throat. “It’s just… everyone seems to move on and adjust really well after the War.” He paused to peer at the boy in front of him. Malfoy didn’t flinch at the mention of the War, his face carefully impassive. Harry continued with a renewed confidence. “Hermione and Ron… they have each other now, and they know about what they want to do in their lives. Hermione is pursuing a law career and Ron will help in George’s shop after getting his N.E.W.T.s. Hell, he doesn’t even need to take N.E.W.T.s, he really just returned for Hermione.” he paused again. “The fact that Ron is trying harder than me this year really says something, huh?” He chuckled humorlessly.
Just like before, Harry made sure to lock his eyes with Draco’s grey ones as he pushed in. This time, Draco held his gaze, staring into those green orbs as his whole body shuddered from the welcomed intrusion.
But Harry wanted that somehow, so Draco did.
“I went there once before you came, the beach isn’t that far. We can Side-Along to reach it,” Harry said, a flash of hope in his eyes. “It’s really beautiful, I promise. You’d love it.”
Maya paused for a bit, seemingly trying to translate Draco’s sentence and she nodded again. “I was small,” she agreed, making an exaggerated gesture about her height back then with her hand. “But you don’t change.”
Malfoy, the unlikely gentleman he turned out to be, pretended not to hear the moan and kept an impassive face as he let Harry lean into him. He even didn’t comment on the way Harry practically writhed against him as he silently struggled to drag Harry back to his room.
"You're an alpha,” Harry said instead.
Draco sighed and relaxed in the embrace, relishing the sudden yet subtle shift of the mood between them. He leaned his head on Harry’s broad shoulder, warmth and contentment began slowly to spread in his heart, almost wary and hesitant.
mean?”
But, as he walked toward the teachers’ table at the far end of the hall, Harry noticed something was different. Before his eyes or ears could pinpoint anything unusual, his nose picked up something first. A scent. Somehow, above the delicious smell of the meals served for breakfast, a strong, unknown scent reached him.
Draco’s chest constricted painfully. He looked away. “Did he?”
He squinted his eyes when he shifted and the morning light caught his eyes, still feeling groggy from his deep slumber. After blinking a couple times, the memory of last night washed over him slowly, the sensation akin to a gentle hug in a cold night. The crashing waves, the promise, the love-making. Harry.
It took him too long to understand the sentence in its entirety.
Harry hummed, hand still rubbing his chin, and jumped onto the desk, perching on the edge of it and looking down at Draco curiously. “Any interesting thing worth sharing?”
Harry stared at his side profile, illuminated softly by the moonlight. “It’s complicated?”
That night, Harry had witnessed something he'd never seen before. Malfoy was smiling serenely, laughing every time an owl landed on his shoulder to affectionately peck his ear. Throughout the years he'd known Malfoy, Harry didn’t think he had heard the Slytherin laugh. A sneer, yes, and maybe some sardonic snickers, but never a genuine, happy laugh. One filled with joy instead of contempt.
“Yes, yes. Go on. Don’t make me beg.”
“Well, strictly speaking, they don’t Apparate, technically. It’s more like a protection spell cast by their parents. In short, the parents link their magic to the child’s magic, and it allows the child to go anywhere within the range determined by the parents. It’s very useful if you can’t watch your kids play when you tend to the fields.”
Just as Harry asked, Draco gave himself a long moment to reflect this newfound information. It took some time, his brain simply refused to form a coherent thought as though it was scared to let go of the safety of the numbness he felt when his head was empty. But after a while, he finally managed to kick his brain into working again.
Out of nowhere, Draco had materialized next to him, and pressed right to his side with an arm around Harry’s waist in a somewhat protective gesture. He shot his most charming smile at Grinspoon, who had paused his ranting when Draco appeared, and his grey eyes glinted dangerously.
At that moment, Draco wondered if he was the only one who knew about Harry’s second life, about the death waiting patiently for him and Harry preparing himself to greet it. Did he tell anyone else about it? Did he even tell Gita?
Draco idly wondered how unmistakable the change between them was for an onlooker. It was not like the two of them didn’t act as a couple before, because they certainly did. They were two young men travelling so far from their hometown, renting a small cottage together and practically just playing around all day. Villagers talked to themselves that Draco and Harry were in
He shook his head, looking lost again. “I—” he sighed. “It’s… quite complicated. Things with Father.”
“I know, right? And the fact that he redeemed himself after what he did in the war...”
reaction to Malfoy being an alpha.
Carefully choosing his words, Harry said as he not-so-discreetly pointed to the man, “What is Malfoy doing here?”
He gave another soft chuckle. “No, you’re definitely not.”
That sounded like something the Savior would do, like a way Harry Potter would leave the world. Grand and noble. It was especially gallant after he had disappeared from the British wizarding community years ago. No one had seen him since, but the rumour spread that Potter was somewhere in the most remote area on the globe, doing volunteer work to conserve the endangered species of magical creatures. Other rumour stated he ran away to a beautiful island with his mistresses to live in a seclusion, avoiding the fame and spotlight he got at home. Draco had never believed the latter.
The food was amazing, the hosts were kind and friendly, Maya was adorable as always, and Harry’s arm felt nice every time it brushed his whenever he shifted. Draco was happy.
There was another silence as Draco tried to digest the information.
“Whatever you meant by that,” said Draco in lieu of agreeing with him.
Those lips are moving again, likely to scoff Harry in annoyance for not answering, but then a waiter comes to their table and places their order. Draco looks away to face the waiter and say his polite thank you, and then suddenly another shine catches Harry's attention.
Harry opened the door for Draco, lighting the room with the wand in his other hand. As Draco walked in, he caught Harry throwing a hesitant smile at him—and Draco recognized it instantly. A peace offering. A silent apology for earlier.
The shift between them was so palpable after that, the change of atmosphere almost tangible. Draco could feel it in the air they shared, in the way Harry touched him, in the way Draco accepted the touches. This was going to be what they were now. Harry and Draco here, in this place right now, with no concern about what tomorrow would bring them.
“You fucking rash halfwit,” Draco hissed as he marched to his bed. “Are you that eager to fucking die?”
Harry wasn’t sure he heard it right. “What?”
“You! To your left!” Draco shouted to a little boy from his team, not caring if he might not understand what he said. The boy dodged the shot just in time.
Harry hummed quietly. He seemed to like that answer and rewarded Draco’s honesty with a gentle caress on his chest, rough fingers grazing the old scars he once left there.
Draco kept staring at him, completely floored, as if he talked in Parseltongue. After what felt like a minute of baffled silence, Draco abruptly huffed a laugh. The laugh gradually grew louder until the blond wizard was cackling from his belly.
Maybe that's just the shiny Draco Malfoy.
Harry knows Draco loves all things pretty and shiny, that posh little git. But he didn't think it would ever come to this.
The Portkey brought Draco and Harry to a small village in the far north of Bali island. One step into the village, Draco could easily tell that they were indeed in a wizarding community—the magic in the air was so prominent after hours being in the Muggle world. He would even say that the magic here felt thicker than it did in his Manor, which said a lot. The strength of the magic depended on how long it had been there. The Malfoys first resided in Wiltshire in the eleventh century, and the only place Draco knew had stronger magic was Hogwarts. The fact that the magic radiated from this village was even stronger still, Draco wondered how ancient this community was.
“Really?”
And Draco loved him, too.
“Are you sure? I can help get you to Madam Pomfrey,” Malfoy offered, stepping closer.
“HARRY JAMES POTTER!” A voice boomed from St. Mungo’s corridor and right then, Harry knew that he was thoroughly and completely fucked, even more than before.
“What
Alas, Potter seemed to have purposely walked here to see Draco. He didn’t know how Potter always found him in the most unassuming situations, but it had been long since he gave up trying to find out the answer. As Potter advanced toward him with his odd, crooked smile, Draco tried to keep his unimpressed scowl on his face.
His green eyes met Draco’s, a spark of gentle excitement in them. “Let’s watch a sunset tomorrow.”
“No, I’m just—”
“And why don’t you?”
“All right, all right,” he sighed and looked back down at his book. “Do you know where I can get further reference on the origin of this spell?” He showed her the passage he was reading.
It was not hard to fall even harder for this whimsical village. Ajawera was nothing like anywhere Draco knew before. It was located in the middle of Indonesia’s most popular tourism destination, but this village was very obscured and secluded. Draco and Harry were the only visitors at the moment. The Balinese wizarding community was so small, only comprised roughly one thousand wizards and witches living together in their relatively vast land, almost fully self-subsistent. Living in the fertile land of Agung mountain’s valley, they grew their crops for personal consumption using intricate farming spells and charms, independently brewed the Potions to cure their sickness, and created practically anything they needed by themselves.
Harry turned to him again with an affirmative hum.
Well, yes. “It’s hard to be suspicious of an old lady,” he blurted quietly before he could think it through.
Malfoy shook his head with a snort, his smirk softened into a gentle smile. “Come on, there’s some Dark Magic to be identified,” he said and began walking away, leaving Harry standing dumbly, still staring at his retreating figure.
Draco blinked, staring at the top of his husband’s unruly morning head. “Well,” he said slowly, “it’s July 31.”
“Shut up,” Malfoy replied under his breath, not looking at him.
“Well, I get paid to do it and the job is easy. It’s not entirely pointless,” he shrugged. “Also, traveling abroad is fun. People are generally nicer in… everywhere outside Britain, I guess. Not that you would understand, though.”
Sitting on top of a hill as the sun set for the day, head filled with memories of Harry’s green eyes twinkling with adoration, Draco could only relish the warmth of
It was like nothing Harry had ever smelled before, intense and almost overpowering, but he knew what that scent was. It was the scent of an alpha.
Despite how much Draco associated this place with the sun, the nights in Ajawera were a lot more magical for him. The air was so clear that the cloudless night meant a sky full of twinkling stars, scattered from end to end. There wasn't that much light coming from the houses either, only a few lamps flickering warm light, barely enough to illuminate the village path. It was almost as though everyone agreed to give the stars their chance to shine. Draco felt a thick blanket of cosmic tranquility wrapped snugly around this village.
When Malfoy retreated his hand a beat later, Harry forced himself not to feel disappointed.
“Where are you going after this?”
“Gorgeous dress,” Draco breathed, looking back and forth between Gita and her mother. “Both of you look amazing.”
Like right now. Sated and suddenly relaxed as the tension ebbed away with their climax, Harry pulled him close, holding him in his arms. Draco would feel the gentle breaths Harry let out on the skin of his bare shoulder, and the calming rhythm never failed to confuse him. It always happened after sex, just innocent cuddles when the two of them simply breathe each other in as on borrowed time. It baffled Draco the first time Harry held him when he was ready to head out, thinking he fulfilled what was needed from him. Now, after years and countless nights together later, he still didn’t quite understand why Harry wanted him to stay.
, Draco wanted to ask. He knew Harry wouldn’t answer that.
Grinspoon, as dense as he was, was unable to detect the change in the atmosphere and continued with his insensitive and offensive monologue on how Harry was supposed to live his life. “I was just talking with Harry about his wrong decision of leaving his Auror career. It’s a shame, you know? Especially with what was laid ahead of him.” The stout man shook his head and threw a snarky glance at Draco as he spoke. “Sometimes I wonder if Harry has been getting bad influence from people around him. Like, I don’t know, maybe associating himself with the wrong kind of person?”
Meme flicked her wand and the sacks flew smoothly to the inside of their house, likely placing themselves in the tiny storage next to their kitchen. She then stopped to exchange a few words with Gita in their native language, offered a warm smile to Draco, and went inside. Unlike her daughter, Meme couldn’t speak English, but for Draco, the wordless interactions between them were more than enough.
“The wedding is in late March,” Draco said.
Not only Malfoy, but almost half of the students at the Slytherin tables were now turned to him, some with blatant bewilderment while others with apparent interest.
All in all, Draco understood he had a lot to redeem; many consequences to face. That was why when he was asked to go back to Hogwarts for what McGonagall dubbed as Eighth year for the war survivors who couldn’t take their N.E.W.T.s the year prior, Draco prepared himself for the worst. He was prepared for when many students threw him an accusing, dirty look his way. He tried not to think much of people whispering whenever he walked down the hallways, minding his own business. He didn’t take it personally when some professors couldn’t hide their disdain and treated him with subtle but unmistakable discrimination in their class.
The whole classroom was silent for a moment until Hermione broke it with her shriek, “Harry, your face!”
From the crack of the door where Harry had peeked into the room, he could see Malfoy sitting on the windowsill at the far end of Owlery, back against the window and head thrown back. His platinum blond hair was illuminated gently by the moonlight. Around him, no less than half a dozen owls were flying and hooting cheerfully.
And that was why Harry was sitting in the library alone, the Potions work in front of him unfinished. It had been too long, though, almost an hour and dinner would be served very soon. He wondered if Draco was actually in trouble or something bad had happened.
“It would hardly be exciting, Potter,” Malfoy had said to him with raised eyebrows. “There was one terrorist attack using Dark Magic in Rome a few months ago and since then people keep sending in false reports. They are all convinced there is some secret cult of Dark Magic users, which I highly doubt is more than a mere conspiracy theory,” he explained, sounding very bored. “Our job will just be walking around the reported area and confirming that it is indeed a false alarm. This is a job no one wants, Potter, you’d miss your fun little patrol with your fawning fans as soon as we arrive there.”
They probably should get up, getting ready for the day, but none of them moved. It was too comfortable; the morning, the afterglow, each other’s warm body and slowing heartbeat. They didn’t really have anything to do anyway, Draco couldn’t find a reason to let Harry, sated and sleepy, out of his arms right now.
“Pretty much, yeah,” he admitted. “I broke up with Ginny almost the first thing after the War. I didn’t regret it, not really. I saw it coming. It’s just… kind of threw me even more off balance, I guess. So many things happened and changed. Hermione and Ron adapted too fast, leaving the War behind and moving on with their lives.” Harry took a deep breath. “They adjusted with the changes and just picked things up where they left them. And here I am, not knowing what I should do or even what I want to do next. People assume I’ll join the Aurors after this, but now I’m honestly not sure if I still want it after all of this.” He lowered his eyes from Malfoy’s face and fixed them on the emerald slap bracelet, constantly on his wrist. The sight almost made him smile from the fondness he felt for his friend. Malfoy and his odd little slap bracelets. “Sometimes I feel like I’ve completed my purpose, you know, defeating Voldemort as the prophecy told me to. Like I reached the climax in my life and now I don’t know what to do with the rest of it.”
"I think my hair is better than his," Draco replied solemnly.
Malfoy eyebrows raised and looked up to meet his eyes. Harry didn’t know what expression his face was sporting at the moment, but whatever it was softened Malfoy’s demeanour a little. “What I’m trying to say is, it’s completely okay to be confused. There’s no rush to decide what you want to do. Even if you decide on something and it doesn’t work out, you can always leave it and do other things. We’re young, Potter, it’s our prime time to make mistakes.”
But it might just be them, just their world. The shift was meant to be a personal catharsis for Draco and Harry.
Without waiting for a response, Draco stormed out of the hallway, leaving a dumbfounded Potter behind. As he walked away, Draco cursed himself and his traitorous, rapidly beating heart—the sight of Potter’s earnest eyes still etched in his mind.
!” Maya shouted from Draco’s side and snatched the tangerine. For a second, Draco thought he did something wrong until he realized Maya just wanted to peel the fruit for him, making all of them laugh at her antics.
But, of course, something felt different right now. The last time, they were hesitant and timid, neither was sure where they stood with each other. It had been confusing, frightening almost, to be so far from home and finally allowed to change the nature of their relationship. To boldly take the borrowed time up front and be in the moment.
“I don’t know, maybe you need the gold or something,” Weasley mumbled, his voice full of disdain.
Or maybe it was just Harry. Draco knew him since he was an awkward eleven year old boy who was just introduced to magic, and practically watched him grow up into the Savior everyone adored. But from all those years he knew Harry, Draco never saw him this carefree. Like he no longer had any burden on his shoulders. As though Ajawera helped dissipate all his concerns, leaving a content and peaceful man to discover a life like he never knew before. And Draco loved this place for it.
“Shut up, Potter,” Draco retorted, rolling his eyes. He addressed Gita, “are you thinking of a game? That might be a good idea.” Playing actual games sounded far more intriguing than spending his entire afternoon awkwardly acting like a prince for these girls, letting them play with his hair.
Waving her hand wildly, the witch kept increasing the speed of her incantation, and the men followed her lead by being impossibly louder. The whole clearing vibrated—Draco couldn't tell if it was the sound that shook the ground or it was the magic around them, but it hardly mattered. The place was vibrating and Draco felt it to his core.
“They said we were having some turbulence and the plane started to shake like crazy. I was trying to find out where I was to calculate if I could think of a place near enough to Apparate in case the whole thing exploded.”
“That’s even more suspicious,” Granger said, frowning more deeply. “Why would Harry leave you with his personal belongings?”
And for now, there was something to clear between them. Without meaning it, Harry had unintentionally offended Malfoy, and he was determined to make it right once and for all. Harry knew Malfoy would run away again if he didn’t approach him carefully, so this time, Harry had a plan to corner him where his former enemy would not get a chance to get away.
So, almost halfway through the miserable party, Harry found himself in the company of Mr. Grinspoon, a fifty-something year old wizard with a stout body and a constant frown on his unhappy little face. He tried to stick with Draco throughout the night, taking turns rescuing each other from any unpleasant conversation, but he had lost his boyfriend ten minutes ago when a foreign wizard dragged him to talk about Potions. Not long after that, Mr. Grinspoon approached him and Harry cursed himself for not thinking of bringing his Invisibility Cloak, or following Draco to avoid other interaction.
Harry gave a long suffering sigh. "I don't know, Draco, do I look like someone who wears makeup?"
Like tonight. They both attended a Ministry gala, and, as most people knew, Harry hated this kind of formal event so much. Everyone would somehow think it was completely acceptable to harass him with their opinion on him. Whether it was false admiration of his heroic deeds, or blatant disappointment when they realised Harry didn’t live up to their impossibly high expectations. He reached the point where he couldn't even tell which he hated more.
To say that Draco was puzzled to find this man in front of his door first thing in the morning was completely justified. The puzzlement multiplied by a hundred when the wizard introduced himself as Harry Potter’s solicitor.
Harry’s steps halted.
That just made Harry want him more than ever. After that night, Harry finally accepted the sexual attraction he had for Malfoy. It was so much easier to admit your desire when you knew it wasn’t directed toward a bad person. Malfoy had turned to be a different man than the snobby teenager he was and Harry wanted to know him better.
“Anyway, why am I still Potter? Can’t we just be Harry and Draco here?” Potter’s tone was casual, but Draco could hear a hint of hope in it.
“Dinner’s on me,” Harry finished his joke with a grin, ignoring the unimpressed look Draco gave him and the thick air of confusion blanketing the Slytherin table.
Mentally, Draco wondered why it was so easy to forgive Harry. Too easy. Maybe because he never had a right to be mad at him in the first place.
“Your hair still beautiful.”
“Of course it’s hot, you’re in heat, Potter,” Malfoy said evenly, his tone as controlled as ever. “Let me go and I’ll get you some water.”
Life in Ajarewa went on.
When they joined the kids in the middle of the ground, Gita opened the box and took something that looked like a red, flat pebble the size of a child’s palm. “The game is called
“I would never,” Malfoy denied quickly, the blush on his cheeks turned a darker shade of red.
From the tone, Harry assumes Draco is lifting a single eyebrow in question, like he always does in a very captivating way. But Harry can't tell because his eyes are locked to the movement of those pretty, glossy lips.
out of shape, maybe I should let
“And how exactly were you baited?”
, Harry thought in defeat.
“Oh,” he mumbled, his tone a bit surprised. “Harry.” A little frowned appeared between his brows. “I forgot to meet you at the library. Were you waiting for me?”
, Draco thought as he examined the broad of Harry’s chest where the golden ray of sun hit the tan skin. Harry looked truly delectable like this, all lean muscles proudly on display for anyone to see. The thin layer of sweat from the high temperature and humidity reminded Draco of when he was under him last night, moaning his own name to urge Draco to fuck him faster. Draco was dying to touch him now.
“What?” Harry said in disbelief. “But he can’t work here! He’s an alpha!”
“Potter,” Malfoy called, his voice sounded very close.
Malfoy gave himself a moment for another laugh before working his fingers to undress Harry, the joyful grin on his face slowly turned into a predatory smirk. By the time the last piece of clothing was thrown across the room, leaving the two of them stark naked, Malfoy’s eyes were dark with lust. For a fleeting second, Harry wondered if he really should fear the man on top of him.
Hermione, still shocked that
Harry put the boy on his shoulders down and he quickly followed his friends. “That was pretty effective,” Harry said.
Without any pause, Harry moved to attack him again, pressing his body onto their mattress like before, but this time, he had both Draco’s wrists on each side of his head, trapping him. Harry bent his torso to lean in close, placing his lips right next to Draco’s sensitive earlobe.
, Malfoy had said. It implied that he would fuck him on
“Malfoy—,” Granger called.
Harry didn’t hate how it turned out. It was nice not to spend his energy shouting childish things at Malfoy’s face and being shouted at in return. It was also nice to not have to worry about being hexed or that the other was up to something bad.
"So people think Potter planned his death?"
“Boys,” Gita mused as she put the props back to the crate in the gazebo. She waved her wand to make the lines marking their court disappear and turned to the two men lying on the grass. “Shall we go home too for dinner?”
“You do what?”
That twit only rebuked with
Harry hadn’t even found a strong enough adjective to describe the beautiful scenery in front of him in itself, and he was absolutely not ready for what greeted him as he turned around. Malfoy was a few meters from him, standing tall among the ice crystals. His platinum blond hair was shining gently under the bright sunlight, looking almost otherworldly with the all-white background of the neverending snow. Framed by the light hair was his face, as pale as ever, but the scowl he sported the entire afternoon was gone. In its place was a delighted smile, open and genuine, and Harry was rendered completely speechless. He didn’t think he’d ever seen Malfoy like this. He looked like he came straight out of a fairy-tale.
Harry couldn’t shake the anger flashing in those pale, grey eyes.
Just an aimless stroll to enjoy the beautiful, untainted scenery of this little magical village, hand in hand.
“If the happiness is no longer attainable in the future, then no. I reckon good memories from the past would only make it hurt more when you don’t have the means to achieve it anymore.”
Well, rationally, because this was all a bad idea in and of itself. What did Draco think when he impulsively jumped onto the plane to ride more than half a day long flight here? Nothing, he didn’t let himself think and just let his heart guide him. To a small island thousands of miles away from London. To Potter.
“Who’s there,” Draco mumbled, feeling ridiculous.
“Why?”
She was standing in front of him with her hands on her hips, her eyes glaring daggers. Harry sat on his bed with a dejected face while Ron was watching them in silence from Malfoy’s bed across the room.
“Fine, you can touch,” he said in defeat, but not without a hint of amusement and a short breath of laugh. He bowed down low to let his long hair fall around his face, the straight strands spilled from behind his shoulders. “It’s just hair, though, nothing special.”
“It’s plausible, yeah,” Harry said quietly, a little frown on his face. A thought seemed to fleet through his mind and a small smile appeared. “It’s truly amazing, right? That you can be connected with your children through magic.”
Harry snorted and turned sober once again. “But seriously, Malfoy, thank you for listening. And maybe for fishing it out of me. It has been plaguing my mind for quite some time and, honestly, I don’t think I was fully aware of it.” He said. “You’re right, I shouldn’t be overly stressed out over my future at eighteen.”
Not that any of it would matter at the moment. The other Slytherins were still staring curiously. Zabini and Nott had  matching calculating stares, studying both Harry and Malfoy in turns, and Malfoy began to fidget in his seat.
“You smell so amazing that I almost want to act like an alpha for once,” Malfoy said with a breathless laugh, hips never slowing down. “If only you knew what it took to keep myself from devouring you that night. You, an omega in heat, begging me to fuck you while smelling like the most forbidden temptation. I was sure you were sent from hell just to test me.”
“They came back to offer an entirely new category last year just so you could be on their list again.” Draco threw him a challenging look. “They seem to really want you to reappear on their cover.”
“No, we will be there with some of the other women to prepare for the feast,” Gita said, waving her hand dismissively. “You two just enjoy yourselves and have fun.”
Harry’s grin widened. Malfoy could act impassive and untouchable all he wanted at work, but he knew the blond had a special soft spot for his cousin. He could never deny the child anything he asked, and Harry was amused to find out that Teddy asked
Harry held him impossibly closer. “
“Yes, a local game. I think you’d like it,” Gita said with a grin. She clapped her hands and raised her voice to get the children’s attention, then she talked in her language, complemented by broad hand gestures. Draco of course didn’t understand her words, but her students surely did as they erupted in loud cheers and hurriedly ran to the empty ground next to the gazebo.
“Something to write on so you can stop staining your hand,” Malfoy replied lightly. “It’s a slap bracelet, obviously, but you can write on it and slap it to your wrist. When you straighten it back, the writings will automatically be erased. I gave it a reminder spell, it should tingle every other hour to alert you.” He frowned a little. “I don’t know how well it will work, though, the spell. You should try it and tell me.”
So instead, they chose the simplest Muggle wedding ceremony and modified it a little. Their family would enter the ceremony room, then Narcissa would walk Draco down the aisle to where he would wait for Harry to make his entrance with Molly. The officiant would open the ceremony and they’d go straight to the vow exchange after that without readings of any kind.
“I don’t know.”
Harry had been feeling weird all day. Since the moment he got out of bed, he had been extremely restless, like something was off. His body was heavier than usual and he felt a bit feverish. Shrugging it off as the aftermath of staying up late for work the night before, Harry had started his day as usual. But, as the day progressed, the uncomfortable feeling just got worse.
Gita pulled her wand and waved it around in a wide circular motions. Quite fascinated, Draco watched as lines started forming on the grass, making a considerably big rectangle with a tiny square in one corner. “So this will be your court, everyone in the game stays inside the lines. That square is where the players will have to stack the piring,” Gita continued to explain. “Oh, and the opponents can’t move with the ball. They have to either hit the player on their spot or pass the ball to their team member.”
Draco hummed, thoughtful. “Plausible theory, no?” he said. “I need to look it up further, though.”
Oh, how Draco wanted to pull his hair out at that moment. Or maybe Potter’s hair. He didn’t understand what was happening, what Potter’s motivation was that kept him determined to tell Draco his crappy jokes. If the fact that he was completely clueless about the whole ordeal was not enough to drive him mad, Potter’s lack of understanding of humour was certainly sufficient for that.
It’s not that Draco walked around Ajawera with full formal robes everyday. He couldn’t because one, it’s so hot here, and two, he would look even stranger than he already was with his light hair and fair skin. No wixen in Ajarewa wore robes. Everyone practically lived in shorts and t-shirts. So Draco got used to having his arms bare early on, which was a bit hard at the beginning since he always had them covered back home. It didn’t really matter, though, no one blinked at his fading Dark Mark here. If anything, his pale skin might have attracted more attention to him than that scary looking tattoo on his left arm.
Draco is
His idle observation was cut short by Malfoy standing up from the chair at his desk, clearing his throat.
“No,” Draco said.
Draco lifted his eyes from the page and paused. What did he think? He considered it for a moment. His possible answer throughout the years was that Potter simply never wanted him. It was the only logical explanation, but at the same time it was also hard to believe. Whenever that thought came up, Draco’s mind supplied him with that one unreadable emotion in Potter’s green eyes that was so full of passion. Potter did want him once. Did he stop wanting Draco then?
But then again, when was Harry ever good at keeping things the way they should?
Suddenly, Malfoy leaned his body over Harry, his pale neck barely an inch from Harry’s nose. A silent invitation to breathe in his scent.
The stares the Slytherins gave him started to make him feel uncomfortable. Not only that, the students from the other Houses were throwing a curious glance of their own. Harry could distinguish Ron and Hermione’s among the others and he was not looking forward to explaining this situation to them. They wouldn’t understand.
“Not here, no, but she knows I’m away.” Draco paused to think about his soon-to-be wife. He didn’t know Astoria Greengrass that well other than the times he occasionally saw her in Hogwarts, a House-mate one year younger than him. She didn’t particularly stand out, didn’t attract attention to herself, and Draco didn’t think much of her. Later, after he reestablished the marriage agreement with the Greengrasses, he still didn’t think much of Astoria. He was just doing what he thought he needed to do, and she was somehow part of it. But, when Draco came to her before his departure, telling her he had to leave and asking her not to tell anyone about it, Astoria only smiled and let him go. Draco didn’t even tell her when he would be back. If he would be back at all. “I think she understands.”
On the door, Harry rummaged his pocket, trying to find the key. In Ajawera, no house was protected with a ward. Gita said this community was pretty much a big family, and warding your house from family would simply be ridiculous. In fear of insulting the villagers, Harry decided to not ward the cottage, but he seemed to understand that neither of them would be comfortable doing what they do without a layer of security for their privacy. That was why Harry came up with the idea of using a Muggle lock.
This far, Draco couldn’t help but keep pressing. “Will you be back?”
“Where are we doing, actually?” he asked Potter to distract himself.
As another thought came to his mind, Draco furrowed his brows. Ancient magic. Protection spell. Familial bond. Love.
“Yeah, sorry about that.”
Draco Malfoy knew he had nothing to lose, so he didn’t try to restrain himself when the deepest part of him led him to Harry Potter, the way his past, logical self would never do. He threw himself to his old rival, diving headfirst with no hesitation.
“You didn’t know what you asked, Potter, you were delirious,” Malfoy scoffed, looking away. “I should have brought you to Madam Pomfrey.”
“Sorted out.”
But if it came to affection, Draco was anything but grand. At the beginning of their relationship, Harry anticipated him to be an over-the-top boyfriend. He expected Draco to take him to a ridiculously fancy restaurant as their first date and to be as public as possible about it.
“Well, I didn’t,” he grinned. “It was just a lucky guess, but I do know now.”
“It hits me way later than it should. In a few months, we’ll finish our N.E.W.T.s and they will likely put me in a low-end job in the Ministry as my community service.” He sighed. “I was never under any illusion that people would fawn over me for what I did in the War, but I didn’t realise the extent of what they could actually do to me. If I really have to work in the Ministry—”
Beside him, Harry shifted forward to look at Gita properly. “I never asked this before, but how can the parents know where the kids want to go or when they want to go home?”
This time, Harry fully growled, deep from his chest, and Draco could feel the sound send a spark right to his groin. He mentally congratulated himself for accomplishing his mission. This was going to be great.
A smirk instantly stretched on Harry’s face. “What, scared, Malfoy?”
“That was over twelve years ago!”
He dragged his feet to the empty hallway leading to his Transfiguration class. It was still too early for anyone to head to their classes and Harry appreciated the quiet space he had for himself. He leaned against a huge window facing the lush grounds of Hogwarts’s garden, watching as the magical plants stirred awake, shaking the dew from their leaves.
He was in heat.
“It’s me,” Scorpius breathed in awe, tracing the dots representing his constellation with his fingers.
Harry huffed petulantly. “I landed on a tree, it really wasn’t that bad.”
“Real life,” Draco muttered, voice a little shaky. “Life outside the secure walls of Hogwarts. A life where people hate me, or my kind, enough to wish me harm. A life where Death Eaters like me face social sanctions every day. A life where we have to pay the consequences of our deeds and we are unable to even predict how much society determines the price would be.
But the blow didn’t come. Harry Potter didn’t push him away, didn’t look at him with disgust. Instead, the Savior welcomed him with open arms, embracing him. Reviving him.
. Potter, you’re
“Unfortunately. I didn’t prepare anything special for you.” He hummed. “But.” He produced a piece of parchment and wrote something on it. A few spells later, he reached out his empty hand. “Here.”
With a fond smile and full heart, Harry leaned down to plant a kiss on those pouting lips. In spite of his disgruntled tirade, Draco sighed into the kiss and moved his arms up to circle around Harry’s neck. “Your idiocy almost gave you a well-deserved death, but you better know I’m glad you’re somehow still alive, Potter.” He mumbled in between kisses.
Surely, love wouldn’t be as beautiful if it was one sided. Draco wanted it fully, blooming as beautifully as it could, burning as hot as possible. When Draco locked his eyes with Harry’s, he gave everything he had, answering the love he translated for himself with his own, stronger and fiercer.
The garden of Malfoy Manor which Draco was staring at was extensive and lush, expanding to every direction with various kinds of plants, both magical and non magical. The vivid green grass covered every inch of the Manor. It was thick but well trimmed, decorated with splashes of vibrant colours from the flowers scattered in small patches. Draco remembered running around that ground as a small child, his mother watching him with a book on her lap and a cup of tea in her hand. He remembered laughter when his mother cast a spell to make the daisies dance along with a joyful tune. He remembered the softness when she hugged and caressed him once he fell down and scraped his knee. He remembered when his father led him there with his very first broomstick, patiently teaching him how to float and leave the earth.
. He moved again with new determination. The birthday boy would be here anytime and Harry would be damned if Draco arrived to find Harry had no present for him. He had been having a hard time deciding on what to give his boyfriend as the man seemingly had everything he might want. He ended up planning on baking a red velvet cake, Draco’s latest favorite dessert with a heavy consideration on his sweet tooth.
Harry took it, putting aside his embarrassment. “Just tell me your secrets, Malfoy, I’m about to die freezing here,” Harry huffed as he stood up and shrugged the snow on his cloak off.
But then his brain registered what Neville just said and Harry stared at him with a frown of confusion. What kind of question was that? Of course, there was something wrong, Malfoy was sitting with the other teachers as if he belonged here!
If he had to be honest, speaking to strangers was not Draco’s favorite pastime. But he was in their land, thousands of miles from his own. Like what people said, in Rome, do as the Romans do. “Do they speak English?”
Draco wanted Harry and as far as he could tell, Harry felt the same. Why couldn’t they be together again? At home, it just didn’t make sense for them to be together. The Savior just didn’t stay with a Death Eater. But they weren’t at home, were they? No one cared about that bullshit here. No one saw a problem of them being together. And Harry told him he didn’t even plan to go home. So why did Draco still have to return to the place where everyone hated him, leaving one person he truly loved?
“When McGonagall told me the lock to the teachers’ quarters only works to keep students away, I knew it was the most stupid idea ever,” Malfoy said flatly. “But I gave her the benefit of doubt. Surely everyone who works in Hogwarts understands the concept of privacy and knows how to knock, I thought naively back then. Thank you for proving me wrong.”
“You know what I mean,” Harry bit out, struggling to keep his head straight and ignoring how his body started to react to the scent.
he wanted to say.
“Shut up, she only likes my light hair, that’s it,” Draco denied, embarrassed. Of course he remembered Maya, the cute little girl who squealed after touching his hair, and then disappeared into thin air with an Apparition-like magic. The whole thing was completely bizarre, but the cuteness and innocence of the girl left the biggest impression in his mind.
Later that night, Draco pulled a leather bound journal from his suitcase and sat down at a small desk in the corner of their cottage.
Shrugging, Malfoy took a break from his homework, his face showing mild boredom. He started engaging Ron with some new product ideas to sell in the joke shop. They did that a lot recently, the two surprisingly were in the same frequency when it came to brainstorming for pranks. It was really amusing, seeing his best mate engage in a discussion with Malfoy. Harry stared at them discreetly, his heart oddly warm.
“A Portkey station. Our lodging is still quite far from here.”
Wearily, Draco looked away and sighed. He stared at a vase of daisies and primroses Astoria picked from their garden yesterday, sitting innocently across the room. The vase was his mother’s favorite, bone white with soft blue geometrical patterns all over it. Draco remembered Scorpius had broken it no less than four times, and he only laughed it off each time as he cast a Reparo and tried to calm the startled toddler. That’s it, Scorpius and Astoria. Draco thought about his son and wife and took a deep inhale, still staring blankly at the vase. He could do this.
Draco stopped and frowned at him. “So how did you survive two weeks living here so far?”
Thankfully, Malfoy obliged, adding his second and then third finger. Without words, he fucked Harry open with his fingers, stretching, and prodding. Like the fingers on Harry’s cock, the ones in his ass were just as efficient, every thrust brought a wave of pleasure rippling all over his body. Harry shivered in pleasure.
“No,” Malfoy replied without missing a beat, his tone dripping with finality. He pushed Harry’s hand and continued to stroke his cock.
“Thank you, Ma’am, it’s really delicious, but I think I’ve eaten more than enough,” Draco said, which Gita promptly translated to the woman.
“You’re funny.”
Draco sighed, defeated. “Honestly, Potter, what do you want from me?”
Yes, Harry was an omega, and it wasn’t the first time the scent of an alpha had enticed him, but it was never exactly like this before. No scent, not from an alpha—or anyone, had made Harry feel a desire so fierce and overwhelming. No one had made Harry almost lose every single shred of his self-control like Malfoy and his very alluring scent.
A small pang of jealousy bloomed in Harry’s chest from the image of Draco cuddling with Parkinson or Zabini. He quickly shook it off and mentally scolded himself. It was inappropriate, being jealous of Draco’s friends. The ones he was currently missing, at that. Instead, he tried to focus on the body in his arm. Thinking on ways to comfort the mourning boy.
Draco threw him a lopsided smile, almost a smirk. “Why are you looking so surprised?”
There, under the soft light emitted by the moon, Draco looked absolutely stunning. His white-blond hair seemed to be impossibly paler, his fair skin almost translucent. The edges of his lean body cast dark shadows in the right places. Harry felt like admiring a work of art.
“I don’t know, Potter,” Malfoy answered, still half laughing. His grey eyes twinkled in delight. “Maybe you can come up with safer and more creative ideas later. Say, meet me after you've shaved all that?”
Draco wondered if something happened to his head during the war. Because,
Harry Potter had died. The Savior, the Golden Boy. Draco’s first instinct was to blatantly reject the news. It couldn’t be right, could it? Harry Potter, the hero who saved the wizarding world by defeating the Dark Lord twice. Was this some kind of joke? A dream? Maybe Draco just hadn’t woken up properly this morning.
Harry didn’t say anything for some moments, digesting the words. It made perfect sense, every single point Malfoy made. And he said it in the manner that implied Harry was foolish to even stress over it. Or maybe not exactly for stressing over it but for silently burying it and letting it get in the way of his attempt to build back his life. He should have told his friends. Shouldn’t have tried hiding it from Ron and Hermione. Should have considered confiding in Malfoy. Should have trusted Malfoy more as his friend.
A few meters before he reached it, Draco realized he wasn’t fast enough. The opponents were already back in control over the ball and ready to finish the game. He was vaguely aware of one of the kids passing the ball to Harry who was prepared to throw the final shot.
And tonight, Draco decided to himself what he wanted to interpret it as love.
He started to read.
The beach was as beautiful as Draco remembered from the first time they visited it, the blue of the ocean complemented by the scarlet shade in the sky as the sun crept to the west. The whole place was also as empty, the only sound that could be heard was the crashing of waves and the rustling of strong wind. As they walked hand in hand on the soft sand without a word, Draco pondered how similar this was to the time they stepped on this beach.
“That’s amazing,” Draco said. He patted the spot next to him and Maya sat down with a grin. “You’ve really grown up. I could hardly recognize you.”
“Harry,” Draco panted, his fingers sneaked to Harry’s hair.
The shiver that rippled through his body was like nothing he experienced before. When Malfoy finally had his balls against his ass, Harry found himself a quivering mess under the alpha.
It was more than just a kiss. It was a promise, a seal. A solemn vow to mark the beginning of what they passionately called
“I think Ron is right, Harry. I don’t get why your obsession with Malfoy suddenly resurfaced,” Hermione added, and her frown got deeper.
Not knowing what to feel, Draco couldn’t tell if he regretted chasing the answer or not.
he never let himself feel before. His thoughts would inevitably wander to the land of if onlys later, and it would hurt, but for now, he tried to focus on the new realization, so powerful and liberating.
Draco huffed incredulously. But, after Gita translated what Harry said to Maya, the girl turned to Draco again and stared expectantly with her huge eyes, almost pleading. And how could Draco deny her anything if she looked at him with those pleading eyes?
Harry walked faster and caught up to him, his breath coming out in white puffs, feeling suddenly energized. “Liar. I know you watched that movie with Teddy. He told me.”
Harry wanted Draco to remember, because remembering brought him happiness. And he wanted Draco to be happy.
“You teach English to the kids?” Harry asked, joining in the conversation.
The thing was, Potter didn’t come to insult him or try to guilt trip him for what he did in the past like most students who stopped him in the empty corridors of Hogwarts. No. Potter approached him every time to tell him
think?” he all but spat at Potter’s startled face, a little too much venom seeping into his voice.
Draco scowled harder. “I don’t think it’s any of your business, Potter,” he muttered, managing to keep his voice even.
Harry groaned, the nervousness bubbling up in his stomach at the thought.
Harry pondered on it. “That’s amazing. I can clearly see you being a Potions Professor with a billowing robe and oiled hair.”
After the War, it seemed like Draco’s self-preservation steered him towards a new tactic on how to gain a better kind of spotlight, the more respectable one. So, he disappeared without a trace for a few years, until everybody started to think he was dead. Then suddenly reappeared into society out of thin air as a Potion Master with five patents under his name, and a lab ready to operate. He was the headlines for a full week because of that.
She caught his grey eyes. “You have me.”
Harry didn’t get what he wanted at first, then Draco tugged his hand again, firmer this time, so Harry was pulled to shift next to him. Understanding, he moved to climb the bed, the mattress dipped with his weight. He shuffled awkwardly until he sat close next to the blond.
“I would never!” Malfoy gasped between his laughs. “The billowing robe part isn’t that bad, though. Just the hair part is too terrifying.”
Only in the safety of his private quarters, did Harry let himself release a bit of the building tension he felt every day now that Malfoy was back to his life.
Not knowing how to respond to that, Draco only nodded in acknowledgement. Meme was how Gita called his mother, a cheerful witch in her mid-fifties who somehow looked both ten years younger and older than her actual age at the same time. Her friendly and outgoing demeanor made her seem younger. Yet when someone tried to look closer, they would easily find the lines on her face, deeper than other women her age, created from years of hardship. Gita told him in the passing that her mother lost two of her children before she had her. And later, when Gita was barely old enough, her father left them, making her raise the little girl alone. And since then, it was just the two of them, Gita and her strong mother.
Maya turned to him and gave a small smile. “Yes. Harry say it… um,
“Referee! How can this be acceptable?” he turned to Gita, a petulant pout on his face.
“What about before that? Before Harry left? Did you meet him?” Granger asked suddenly.
, and the players’ mission is to stack twenty of them in a neat pile. If they succeed, they win a point.” She put the pebble back and took a purple, sparkling ball with roughly the size of a bludger in Quidditch. “Now, the opponents’ mission is to make sure the players fail by throwing this ball to them. A player who gets hit will be out of the game. If all players are out before they can stack all the
“Not yet, I need to let it simmer under the sun until sunset. It’ll be ready by tonight.”
Malfoy seemed confused. “Because my father is yet to disown me?”
Harry glanced at Malfoy’s cock. In its fully erect state, his cock was thick and glorious, curving proudly from his body. He imagined it in his ass, stuffing him full. Then he imagined how it would expand in him, stretching him wider than ever. A violent wave of arousal shivered through him, punching a needy whimper out of him.
“He said it would make the fake cause of death for his plan less of a lie—which just isn’t true,” Gita had told Draco. “But I think I had his own reasons.”
Draco’s eyebrows shot up, amused. “That’s bullshit, and you know it.”
“I’m pretty sure that’s how humans work. Adding one year to their age every, you know, one year,” Draco said, raising his eyebrows. “And I’m older than you, in case you forgot that I turned forty last month.”
He had a feeling Malfoy wouldn’t be impressed by his attempt at research, so he shut his mouth and decided to ignore his question.
“Yes, and it’s also January,” Malfoy said, his face remained impassive.
“For the last time, I don’t know how my name ended up in his will,” Draco said, exasperated and tired. It was too early for this.
Nothing ever felt as precious as this, no moment in his life could ever come close. The warmth, the rightness of it. The strength of this connection he created with his boy. In this moment with their magic sparking gently around them, Draco was filled to the brim by the overflowing love for his son and the primal need to always keep him safe.
The fact that the universe refused to kill him at that moment was just too cruel. “Yes,” Harry gritted out. “
“You’re certainly not okay, Potter,” Malfoy said, this time walking resolutely up to Harry. He reached out his hand to help Harry stand straight, but the moment that pale fingers touched his arm, Harry jerked violently with a yelp. Malfoy’s eyes widened in alarm.
The corners of Harry’s lips lifted. “Because you love the sun and there’s not enough of it in Britain right now,” he said, not looking at Draco.
It barely had been a week since Malfoy came to Hogwarts to take up the position of the new Potions professor, but it felt like Harry had had just about enough. It was very confusing; not only no one but him realized that Malfoy was an alpha, but it also seemed like Harry’s concern that the man wouldn’t be able to act appropriately around children was very misplaced. If anything, Harry started to wonder if he needed to worry
“Call me by your name,” Harry repeated, his tone an odd mix between a command and a plea. “Call me by your name and I’ll call you by mine.”
“It had been checked for its authenticity, the magical signature on it was undoubtedly of Harry Potter’s,” Engel continued.
“I was reading my journal because these past days have been so surreal. I don’t remember being nearly this happy in—well, so long. Years, maybe. And I want to remember the hardships I went through before so I don’t take this, our time together, for granted,” Draco said as he pulled Harry closer. “For me, pain is something to overcome, and it becomes an achievement that I can be proud of whenever I succeed. On the other hand, joy is just a moment to relish in the present. It’s not a currency to save so I could use it on rainy days.”
When Draco spoke again, and his voice shook a little, “And you, Harry James Potter, the Savior of the Wizarding World, a former Auror with almost seven years of experience, fell into a trap as
When the waiter leaves and Draco looks back at Harry, still dumbfounded, he frowns. "Seriously, Harry, what's wrong?"
“Why? Why can’t we be together?” Draco demanded. “
And there was Draco, sitting on his neat bed with his legs extended, crossed on the ankles. His straight back was propped on his pillows and his white-blond hair was falling to his face as his head was bent down toward his lap where a pair of pale hands were playing with his favorite piece of velvety slap bracelet absently. He didn’t seem to notice Harry’s presence and Harry was uncertain of how to alert him.
Draco read it over and over again until he memorized every word on that parchment. He kept reading it until the words stopped making sense. Good. It wasn’t supposed to make sense in the first place.
Greedily, Harry closed his eyes and inhaled Malfoy’s alluring scent, letting himself drown in the sensation of being dominated by the alpha’s scent colliding with the pleasure he felt on his cock and in his ass.
Draco looked around him to the people sitting in a small circle, Harry and Maya on each side of him. The night was warm but breezy, a perfect time to have a relaxed dinner outside. Draco didn’t visit someone’s house often—the Malfoys liked to entertain guests more than being one—but every time he did in the past, it was always a stiff and formal occasion when he had to pay extra attention to his table manner or his father would scold him as soon as they were back in the Manor. Never in his wildest dream Draco thought of a dinner invitation when they all sat on the woven mat on the floor and just openly laughed between their meals.
Harry gazed far out of the window, watching the West Tower looming on the other side of the castle. He stared at the Owlery on the top of that tower and remembered the night his so-called obsession of Malfoy resurfaced in full force.
“Of course you do. You said that yourself.”
“Lately, I’ve been having a feeling that it is maybe not completely unrequited… but you’re unlikely to make a move anytime in this century, so of course I had to ask first,” he continued lightly, a small smirk still attached.
“She is,” Draco said quietly.
. Now please leave me alone.”
“What did a buffalo say to his son when he left for college?”
Scorpius looked up to meet Draco’s eyes, his own huge in wonder. “Why?”
The next moment, silence fell between them again, Draco’s reassurance heavy in the air. Wind rustled around them serenely. Draco didn’t cease the gentle motion of his fingers while his face—still looked too tired for Harry’s liking—set in a confident smile.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy,” he said slowly, his voice a little choked up. He cleared his throat. “The 11 year old me would never believe I’d one day stand in front of you reciting a wedding vow. And to be fair, the 11 year old you wouldn’t, too. The brat would probably punch anyone who suggests he would marry the Boy Who Lived.” A low rumble of laughter was heard from the audience but he didn’t pay it any attention. His eyes were fully on Draco who was grinning at his words. Harry continued on. “But the 11 year old us didn’t understand much. We didn’t understand how to grow, how to live for ourselves just yet. We lived the way that was expected of us. I… I can’t put into words how grateful I am every day that we did grow past it. That we got a chance to find each other again. That we held on until this moment.” His voice broke at the end. “Took us long enough but here we are. I want us to keep growing together, getting older, being better and wiser. We’ll fall every once in a while, like I did so embarrassingly before, but we’ll help each other up again, like you did. We’ll make mistakes and we’ll fix them. We’ll compromise. We’ll learn to love the best and the worst of each other.” He stopped to take a deep breath. “That’s… that’s my promise to you.”
But stay he did, because Draco didn’t know what else to do, what kind of life he could have if not this. Restoring the name of Malfoy, building a respected pureblood family, raising a proper heir to carry on the task. Before this, Draco wasn’t sure he even had any reason to live left.
Still slumping, Harry reached his right hand to caress a piece of parchment curling on his left wrist. Another good luck on a slap bracelet Draco gave him earlier.
Harry wanted to tell Malfoy to fuck off again, but he couldn’t utter a word when he focused all his energy to restrain himself from begging the man in front of him to just take him right there and then. Malfoy, still clueless, just warily stared at him in concern and confusion.
“Perfect. Now, I’ll take one more marble and the chosen color will play first,” announced Gita. The color she picked from the bag was yellow.
Draco closed his eyes and sighed again. It was about time someone brought that up. He was sure Weasley and Granger wouldn’t be delighted with the truth.
“Because he deserves to know about your utter stupidity and
“Where?”
“You wish, Potter, I just don’t want to embarrass you by showing Gita who the delicate one between us is.”
He stared straight to his eyes, the grey eyes meeting green. Suddenly, Harry felt much calmer, as though the world disappeared, leaving just the two of them in the moment. Those grey eyes, as they always did, anchored him to the warm feeling of serenity, of safety, of
A soft exhale tickled Draco’s skin. “It does. A lot. And I think you know that it does make sense for both of us. You know I feel the same.”
“Writing a journal?” Harry asked quietly next to his ear.
Malfoy Manor had taken a great toll from the War, with it being occupied by the Dark Lord himself, and the garden had its own share of being ruined by that ominous shadow. While Draco wouldn’t say he tried to revive the glory of the old manor, he did dedicate years to scrub off the wicked aura latching to his house left by Voldemort and his loyal supporters, and he took extra time tending to the garden. If his parents couldn’t be here with him, he wanted at least the happy memories he had with them to stay.
“How do you think I managed to avoid you for so long? I think your scent might be even stronger to me than mine to you,” Malfoy said. “I can smell you from the other side of this castle, it’s too easy to keep a distance.”
Malfoy kissed him, and he kissed him back. No, he demanded more kisses from him. This must be a dream. The cold must have gotten to his head. Harry’s brain reeled as he stared bemusedly at the smirking man in front of him.
Harry pondered it for another long moment. By now, he was sure about the attraction he felt toward Draco was not entirely platonic. Still, he enjoyed Draco’s company as a friend a lot and he wasn’t sure if making a move would be worth changing what he already had now. He tried to voice it to his best mate, “the thing is, Ron… I like being friends with Draco. I don't want to change and ruin it by… by wanting more?” The end of his sentence sounded more like a question than anything else.
Harry couldn’t think of anything he wanted to do less at that moment. “Malfoy… it’s so hot,” he whined, hands tugging at his own robe to take it off.
“I was barely any help for Meme,” he said with a little laugh. “I have no knowledge of farming spells, and Meme can’t teach me anything in her language. It was still fun, though.”
know we can be together here. And you’re staying here, right? I can stay, too. Or I can follow you somewhere else. Anywhere.” Draco let out a shuddering breath when he saw Harry refuse to open his eyes. “If we can’t be together at home, then we can find a new home together, can’t we? Just you and I.” He gulped, and added quietly, “Harry,” he paused to gesture at himself, “and Draco,” he pointed his finger on Harry’s chest.
He would like to say that he forgot not to fall in love with Harry, but it would be a lie. He had loved him long before, beyond the primal passion and the thrill of first love. He had always known what he wanted. The only problem was this time, Draco forgot he couldn’t have what he wanted.
And it was why Draco found himself visiting the beach again, all alone. He sat on the sand, his journal opened on his lap at the last letter Harry wrote in it. If he had to be honest, Draco was scared to read it. This was Harry’s last words to him. Reading it would almost feel like accepting the end of it, wrapping up a chapter in his life that he had left unfinished for so long. It felt like he was about to finally let go of Harry, in a way that he never managed before. And it was daunting to say the least.
“Yes, Potter. I did say that it stings, didn’t I?”
To be Draco and Harry somewhere else, the present following them.
Harry, staggered, couldn’t find any word in return. He held his other hand so that both their hands were tightly intertwined together and shifted closer. Without realizing it, his breath followed the same  pattern as Draco’s.
Harry loved him. It was true.
But something in Harry wanted to have more. He sometimes wondered what a friendship with Draco Malfoy would be like. Malfoy was not like his old self, both in a good and bad sense. He acted a lot less like an insufferable git, which was good, but he also was too quiet for the Malfoy Harry once knew. Which was, somehow for Harry, a bad thing.
Gita was also laughing when she walked towards them. “Well, there isn’t any rule specifying a situation where your teammate betrays you,” she said with a snicker. “But I’ll make one for the next round. For now, how about we keep the point and switch roles?”
“We aren’t friends,” Draco said.
Right when Hermione opened her mouth to start another fit of angry shrieking, the door to his room slowly creaked. A white-blond head popped up and a pair of grey eyes peered around cautiously.
Draco pondered on the question for a while. It’s been quite long since he asked that question to himself. The last time was right after the war, when everything was chaotic rubbles and ashes. After he was freed from his charges, he sat alone in his room, blanketed in the remaining gloomy shadow of the Dark Lord, and thought:
The chanting got louder and faster—and Draco could finally feel the magic shifted around them. It was subtle at first, like a whisper, as gentle as the caress of the evening breeze on his bare skin; but the change in the air gradually became more noticeable. The magic felt stronger, denser, as though the magic was a sentient being and it responded to every spell being chanted loudly to the fire.
There weren’t that many crates to go through, only four moderate-sized crates stacked on top of each other. Draco wondered how long it would be to find the answer he was looking for. Would it be carefully concealed? Potter had always been an enigma to him after all. Would it take a lot of time inside this vault? Weasley and Granger knew he was going to Gringotts today. Were they waiting for him to deliver the stuff? Would it be suspicious if he took too long?
Other than prompting a tentative friendship between them, the bizarre afternoon also led to Malfoy developing an equally bizarre obsession of slap bracelets. For a few days after that, Harry found the blond sat on his desk, tinkering with various items and some advanced Transfiguration spells.
Despite all the odds where a rejection would have made more sense, Potter took his hand. When Draco tentatively came to him, Potter brought him closer, held him, kissed him. Potter took him, slowly, almost lovingly, his emerald eyes burned into him. Potter collected the scattered pieces that were him and built him back, only to take him apart again, and rebuild him again. Over and over.
The last thing Harry wanted at this moment was to have his friend witness him struggling over his very inappropriate boner in the middle of an ill-timed heat. It was never like this before. Yes, as an omega, Harry experienced a heat every now and then, but his past heats always passed without too much trouble. Normally, he would just feel a bit horny, and it would go away with a couple of wanks in the privacy of his room. Even when the heat came in the middle of the day, Harry could put the uncomfortable feelings aside to deal with it later at night.
means prince. She said you look like a prince from a fairytale with that blond head of yours. She wants to touch your hair to see if it's real.”
“Shut up, dimwit,” Draco replied, but he raised his own arms to circle around Harry’s torso, returning the hug.
Draco could only laugh harder, feeling Gita give him a curious look. It was
,” Harry demanded.
Her uncertain smile bloomed into a beam and she walked faster, skipping her steps. “People say you’re here again,” she said.
“My client, Harry James Potter, has passed away,” Engel said, his tone so impassive and factual that Draco had a hard time processing the information.
Stepping into Malfoy’s quarters, Harry let his eyes wander around the room, distracting himself from the fact that the whole place smelled so much like Malfoy—this was his territory after all. He had expected a lot of green, maybe even some pictures of snakes on the wall, but Harry was surprised to find Malfoy’s room was mostly decorated in different shades of blue. And it was so much more homely than he expected. The mismatched pieces of furniture and the fire crackling in the hearth made the ambiance a lot warmer and welcoming than Harry had anticipated.
Honestly, Harry didn't expect many things to happen in his already very eventful life—one of them is befriending the one and only Draco fucking Malfoy. And here he is, sharing a flat with his ex nemesis because
Draco wondered if he truly deserved
Draco put his hand inside the bag full of little round items and pulled out a yellow marble. Harry did the same thing and came out with a green one. Gita started walking around the kids, prompting every one of them to take a marble each and fairly grouped them based on the color they got. If they got yellow, they went to Draco while the rest with green marbles separated themselves with Harry.
Draco couldn’t look away. He could hardly breathe.
by his students. Not in a particularly inappropriate way, but whatever the students were telling Malfoy at the moment—Harry couldn’t hear it from this distance—obviously made him uncomfortable. Malfoy was frowning and his hands were twitching at his side as if he was about to take his wand and hex the teenagers who seemed still determined to pester him.
"Well, there must be more to prepare," Draco insisted, dodging the unspoken question. "We'll be starting a new life. Together. We have a lot to get ready for."
Malfoy’s body, still half-pressed to Harry’s side, went stiff. Harry didn’t know if it was a good or bad sign, but it was a reaction nonetheless. Maybe pleading could work.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, feeling useless. “I don’t know if I can do anything about it.”
“Harry Potter passed away.”
On his side, Neville turned with a worried look. “Harry? Are you okay?”
Harry groaned again. “Do you really have to rub it in my face that I’m turning forty today?”
At that, Draco laughed, shaking his head in amusement. “Whatever you want to tell yourself, Birthday Boy.”
“A slap
Taking a deep breath, he stared down at the small key lying innocently on his palm. Potter had invited him after all.
It was odd, having Malfoy being a part of his days, but he was strangely grateful for the change. With Malfoy, it felt like the four of them were just a set of friends hanging out together while without him, Harry felt like being a third wheel in Ron and Hermione’s recent relationship. Harry had tried to convince himself that nothing would be different between him, Ron, and Hermione, but of course changes were inevitable that his two best friends were romantically involved now. Malfoy somehow managed to balance out the awkwardness of the change and turned it into a new setting entirely.
“Wait, wait,” Potter blurted out, putting his hand on top of Draco’s parchment to prevent him from packing it into his bag. “Where do baby cows eat lunch?”
Harry wasn’t sure how Draco would respond to his impulsive but sincere proposal, but that certainly was not it.
To be fair, Lapland was indeed beautiful, the perfect picture of a winter wonderland. Everything was white as far as his eyes could see, blanketed by the soft looking snow. In the clear day like this, the white ground almost glimmered beneath his feet, illuminated by the bright but gentle sunlight. Even in the deserted wilderness that was certainly not the Santa Village Harry had hoped to see, Lapland was very stunningly dream-like.
Draco snorted. “What are you sorry for?”
Gita nodded. “English, Indonesian, reading, math. Just anything to prepare the kids for school. And very informal, just like casual afternoon classes every now and then.” She turned to the girl and ruffled her hair affectionately. “This is Maya, by the way. One of my students.”
Draco twisted his wrist left and right, admiring the messy accessories on it. Harry didn’t think his lousy creation deserved that look of wonderment that he had, but the awe in his eyes were so earnest that Harry’s heart clenched hopelessly.
Malfoy moved his hips experimentally, starting with slow, shallow thrusts. As soon as he was sure Harry could take more—
“A slap bracelet, Malfoy.”
“Nothing would have come of it, though,” Draco said thoughtfully.
Draco stared at him.
As if he didn’t know Draco wanted this to last forever. Draco almost hated him for that answer. Just almost. He understood his meaning, the unspoken
“She said she wants to touch your hair, Draco,” Harry teased. “Why don’t you let her?”
“Okay, Potter, calm down.” Malfoy raised his hands in a non-threatening gesture. “You’re in heat and you need help. I’ll take you to Madam Pomfrey,” he decided, his posture straightened and eyes steeled like he was ready to tackle a mission.
“Enough, I’m ready—Malfoy, just fuck me,” Harry moaned.
Malfoy, still standing before them, seemed very pleased with his strange sense of humour. He smirked and moved to turn around. “That’s all I got to show you. Good night, Potter, Granger, Weasley.” He nodded at each of them individually. He frowned when his eyes caught Harry’s. “Oh, and you better get back to work, Potter. That essay took
“What?”
Harry’s face was unreadable as he held Draco’s gaze. “No.”
“Oh, it is,” Gita said lightly with a shrug. “It’s pretty harsh for the wizards who live in the cities to make their ends meet. Some of them try to hide their magic to get non-magical jobs, some just use it to make money—and both are illegal according to law here. But it’s not like our government cares about them doing those illegal stuff, anyway.”
Harry didn’t say anything in return, his gaze turned a little sad. Draco smiled softly, taking the journal back from Harry and putting it on the small drawer of the desk. He stood up and took Harry’s hands in his.
“I’m here now and we’re talking. You failed, Malfoy.”
Once a dirty secret, forever a dirty secret. Draco wanted to laugh at how pathetic he was. “I met him once to thank him for testifying for me in the court.”
start moving again, Potter?” he said before adding in a low voice, “I don’t get paid enough for this, this task is supposed to be easy.”
“I never expected you to be the kind of person who discusses their future kids after the first time they have sex with someone. We haven’t even gone for a proper date yet,” Malfoy teased, snickering quietly.
"Harry, do you know what a beauty guru is?" Draco asked him out of nowhere.
“Well, that sounds like an irresponsible thing to do if you put it that way.” Gita frowned a little, rubbing her chin thoughtfully. “But like I said, it was not exactly Apparition. The protection bond between parents and children is so easy and natural to use once it was formed. We don’t even use a wand to perform it.”
“What does it mean?” Harry said, offended. “And it was a calculated risk, okay? As I said, I landed on a tree.”
The lips moved and moved, forming bizarrely lovely shapes. Harry’s eyes were glued to them, passionately following every tiny stretching and pursing.
She stopped at the door to throw a wide grin to Harry. “Draco’s so stunning, Harry, make sure not to fall down swooning over him!” Hermione jokingly teased and left.
“No, you do,” he said flatly. “You know you’re having some kind of trouble that makes it difficult for you to productively study.  I think you’re completely aware that you’re ruining your own chance in passing the N.E.W.T.s.”
“Sounds like the last speech of a loser to me,” Draco retorted flatly.
What caught Harry’s attention was, undeniably, a pair of grey eyes flashing in fury.
attention, but that’s not exactly the point. He wondered if Malfoy felt lonely without his friends. He wondered if he could fill that need of a friend for him. Harry wanted to approach him, to engage him in actual conversations that would hopefully lead to a friendship, but he didn’t know how.
Draco gave him a satisfied smirk, but an unreadable glint of his eyes told Harry that something else was afoot.
“Games always do the trick.” Gita winked. “And an empty threat that whoever fails to obey the instructions won’t be allowed to play.”
For them, this was a dance that they both knew too well. There were times when they eagerly tried to experiment with new, exciting things—wild positions, questionable locations, various toys. They still tried those things every now and then. But this, a simple position when the two of them could just feel all the pleasure and watch the other drowning in it, would always be their favourite.
If Harry had to be honest, he did miss his patrol. Certainly not for the fawning fans, as Malfoy had said it, but at least in Diagon Alley he didn’t feel as if every single one of his toes would fall off frozen. He hadn’t yet decided if the stunning scenery in front of him was worth the numb feeling in all his limbs at the moment.
“Your false confidence is hilarious.”
He expected all of that. He deserved that much after what he did, after all.
Malfoy regarded him in silence, his gaze calculating. After a long, torturous moment, he stepped closer. “Have you ever had sex with an alpha, Potter?”
Two weeks and countless unsatisfying wanks later, Harry decided to put an end to his confusing feelings and confront Malfoy. As he knocked on the door of Malfoy’s quarters, he belatedly reconsidered whether this was a good idea or not. The answer came in the form of a full-body shiver when Malfoy’s scent was carried through the door and teased Harry’s senses.
“Shhh, I got you,” Malfoy said calmly. His nimble fingers started unbuttoning Harry’s robe, effectively undressing him. Within seconds, Harry’s body was bare, skin all flushed, and cock achingly hard. The cold air of his bedroom, a contrast to the flame he felt under his skin, made Harry shiver uncontrollably.
Draco’s grip on the delicate cup handle tightened as his two uninvited guests glared at him. He was once again sitting in his drawing room, on the same armchair he sat on when Potter’s solicitor came just as uninvited. Malfoys’ drawing room had been very esteemed for generations, an elegant space that exuded the untouchable dignified air, a place to entertain the most respected guests in the whole wizarding world. Unfortunately, Draco’s guests today were not interested in being entertained.
They let go of the magical moment and Draco bursts into a loud, bubbly laugh. Harry can only stare with an awestruck expression.
“It is, indeed,” Draco said softly. “I want you to pour your heart into it. Write everything, both the good and the bad things that happen in your life.”
It also took Harry some time to understand Draco’s love language. He was not vocal about his feelings, apart from disagreements, and tended to be closed off towards Harry. He later found out it had to do with his rigid pureblood upbringing in which showing something, especially as vulnerable as love, was frowned upon. So, without vocal expression and grand gestures, Harry learned to note the small details when Draco’s feelings would show.
“At a beach,” Harry answered, the silent
But did they really have to?
After what sounded like a chaotic ruckus and some muffled voices of Mediwizards saying “Mr. Malfoy, please keep your voice down”, the door to Harry’s room was slammed open. In the doorway, stood Draco Malfoy looking terribly dishevelled. His pale face was flushed red, likely from rushing here as his breathing was visibly uneven. His chest, clad in a wrinkled dress shirt, was still falling and rising rapidly.
“Well, I’m sure you know all about accepting defeat, there’s no harm in letting you get a taste of victory for once.”
Until Harry leaned in, lips hovering over Draco’s but not quite touching.
“Maybe I would,” Draco said, hating how he could hear the pained edge in his voice.
Harry turned to face Draco who was smiling softly at him.
After those years together behind everyone’s back, Draco understood this kind of silence very well. This kind of tranquility didn’t feel constricting. Usually, Harry would talk a lot about nothing and everything when they were together, as if they were just two good friends sharing whatever happened in their respective lives. Draco always played along, because he didn’t see any reason not to, and because he liked the sound of Harry’s voice. But when Harry didn’t start a conversation, knowing that Draco wouldn’t either, it meant that he was giving Draco a chance to think about
Potter only grinned wider and leaned forward, apparently unaware of Draco’s discomfort. “Bison, Malfoy. Don’t you get it? Bison. Bye, son. The buffalo said ‘bison’,” Potter said, hands moving animatedly to emphasize his punchline.
Well, apparently yes, because that’s exactly what the rest of the returning Eight years did. Studying, hanging out with each other, moving on. Everyone else there except Harry.
“You’ll see.”
If he had to be honest, Harry rather liked how that idea sounded. He smiled to himself. “It can be arranged then.”
The sight literally knocked the breath out of him, sending him right to the ground with a loud thump, only narrowly avoiding taking Molly down with him.
Seconds passed and neither of them moved, silently inhaling each other.
Malfoy remained rooted in where he was standing. “Well, that was…,” he muttered quietly. “Pretty intense.”
“This is not fair!” Harry protested.
After listening to Gita’s half rambling, Draco turned to Harry and huffed a disbelieving laugh. “Don’t tell anyone?”
“Potter!” He called and walked towards him.
“I don’t know about you, Potter, but I’d like to finish this job before dark, which, in case you missed it in your research, will fall in less than two hours.”
In over two decades of his life, Draco hadn’t travelled that much. In fact, other than a few summer trips to France and one visit to the Durmstrang Institute when he was a kid, Draco never had any opportunity to leave Great Britain. During his childhood, he considered the expansive ground of Malfoy’s property in Wiltshire as his whole universe—and for a lonely boy who grew without any siblings, it was more than enough for him. Soon after he enrolled in Hogwarts, the castle and the magical land surrounding it became his new universe.
, for Merlin’s sake, his new friend and roommate. And his old childhood nemesis.
“I don’t think I am,” he said slowly, mirroring his frown. “Unless mingling with the Savior and his friends is not quite allowed for me, because that’s all I do these days.”
“Wanna go outside for a bit?” he asked softly.
“Diamond dust?”
“And the cold never bothers me anyway,” Malfoy added.
Maya’s father suddenly exclaimed and turned to Gita to say something. The witch’s eyes widened and she nodded.
But Harry already walked ahead of him, forcing him to scramble to follow in fear of losing him in the crowded airport. “I was the one inviting you here, just let me be a proper gentleman for once,” he said once Draco fell into steps next to him.
It was just a natural attraction. Just like Harry finding flowers in a garden pretty, and delicious foods on a table appealing.
? Oh my God, Ron, could Draco file a divorce right after we’re officially married? And this suit is too tight, what if I hyperventilate and faint—”
And that was what Harry had been consistently struggling with for the two years of his career as an educator. This morning, he left his bed after barely two hours of sleep, spending most of the previous night at his desk, grading last week’s exam he promised he would hand to his second-year students today. See, Harry was a responsible adult who worked hard all night. At least that was what he convinced himself, ignoring the fact that he was the one procrastinating on grading that exam until the very last minute.
