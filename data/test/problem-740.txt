his preferred way of being dealt with when in a bad mood was constant presence and companionship, so it was getting quite annoying trying to get space away from Hermione and Cho -- they just wouldn’t let him be. He’d be grateful if it were any other time (especially since when he was younger and in a bad headspace, he would scratch, scratch, scratch till he bled).
Draco then said, softly, “I think we’ve clogged the hallway up long enough. Let’s head to DADA.”
Professor Black smiled encouragingly but stiffened when the temperature dropped, and Minister Peverell calmly asked, in an eerie way, “Pray tell, what is this bad experience?”
"You know I love you, shortness notwithstanding." Harry mocked, before rolling his eyes, causing their small group of friends to laugh and were quickly glared into quietness by an irate Headmaster Snape.  They all winced and looked appropriately contrite, focusing on the sorting hat song rather than each other.
The three of them exited their dorm and were greeted by an anxious-looking Hermione and Draco, though they hid it admirably, Harry just knew them too well.  He smiled and linked arms with them, and they all walked to the Great Hall.  Everyone was mostly there, and he received plenty of sympathetic looks from his peers in other houses.  Harry sat down next to Lisa, Luna, and Anthony and served himself some french toast.
Hey everyone!! I hope you're doing well!  My friends tell me to stop apologizing for late updates, but here I am, apologizing for another very late update.  I swear I try to update more than once a month, but I dunno it never happens T-T Also AP season and finals are coming up so if I don't update this fic till school's out, that's why, and I'm super sorry about it.

“Mr. Remus, Mr. Black, Cousin Rhodesia, welcome, welcome.  Tinsel and Mipsy have been working quite hard on a lovely memorial feast.”
Michael was still sleeping, so Harry shouldered the task of waking up Terry. It took three alarm clock charms, an
Harry took a deep breath and exited the train, excited to start his 7th year, his last year at Hogwarts.  He would be taking his NEWTS and applying for apprenticeships, hooking up with girls and boys, and drinking liquor until dawn.  This year was his last chance to go out with a bang, though, as the first Potter in Ravenclaw in four centuries, he had made his mark already.
Ah, he was getting semantic with all this rumination.  Harry left his emotion tapestry to expand and grow and walked up the stairs back into the realm of the living.  He braced himself as all the physical feelings (chilly air, heavy breathing, itchy blanket) returned, and he waited out the disorientation till he was in full possession of his facilities.  Harry cast a
There is a pause, one that lasts long enough for the tears to prick his eyes, before Potter murmurs, “That’s for me to decide.”
The book also told him that being a vampire was a

saved me from the bludger, Potter. Did your head get hit too hard?"
"I didn't do it so that you could owe me," Potter was saying, but Draco quickly corrected himself.
Rolling his eyes, Harry took the parchment back.
Draco waved his worries off immediately with a motion of his hand. He scoffed and planted himself on the seat next to Harry. “My mother doesn’t know what she’s saying half of the time, so don’t worry about it,” he sighed dramatically. He turned his head towards the door. “Well, what are you waiting for? Sit down.”
There was a
"Charming good looks and a brilliant personality."
Severus nodded with all the patience he had in his body. "Yes, and you seem to be fine as well, Draco."
“You know what, Draco. I think I’ll take you up on that drink and that heart to heart talk. I cannot possibly be seen with someone who asks cats for their consent if they are amenable to be adopted.”
Ginny had once said.
This boy was interesting.
Hermione kissed his cheek in comfort. "No, it was all Ginny's idea," she whispered to him with a smile. "It just didn't take much for me to figure it out."
Lunch came very slowly for Harry. When it did, he all but ran towards the Gryffindor Tower to get Draco's wand. Ron and Hermione let him go easily, deeming it understandable that Harry wouldn't want to go inside the Great Hall just yet and promised to bring him food later.
He couldn’t imagine a younger Potter diving into cold, dark caverns and doing things that no child should ever have to do.
“What happened?”
he would end up going last. More time to worry and bite his already bitten nails.
, I don’t – ugh, Draco, we need to get you inside – how could you even –“
“You can refuse her, you know. You’re certainly under no obligation to babysit criminals.”
The table, Harry saw as they neared, was filled with plates of food that looked and smelled delicious. His mouth watered just looking at them. But he had learned well in the Dursleys never to touch food that wasn’t his so he hung awkwardly beside the man as the man took the seat at the head of the table.
Harry found out that he

He guessed that Potter's room might be upstairs. As for the loud thumps, Severus only had one word for them: "Mutts."

Harry nodded.

The sound of Ron's head hitting the table was ignored by Binns and the rest of the class, who were already fast asleep.
"Yes, and I believe they miss you dearly," he said, and then his face turned sour. "Albus informed me that Narcissa has been trying to send me Howlers."
"He's been sending you smoldering looks for the past week and you haven't given him a second glance," Draco said wryly. "Or a first."
There. Not quite perfect yet, but better.
Ron and Draco left for the mission on the 10th. If they only spent six days there, then they should have been back by the 15th. But Draco had said that he only got back on the 18th…
A dark figure beneath him gathered his attention. He looked down, surprised that while he had been lost in his thoughts, Potter had finally emerged from his self-imposed isolation and was looking up at him.
In the middle of the long dining table sat Potter, who turned pink and glared at him.
But that was what the serpent had said.

Quietly, she and Severus walked to the other end of the wall, where a large tapestry of an apple tree was draped. The apple tree stood in the middle of a meadow, where rams and zebras grazed grass. From time to time, a snake would peek out of the dark leaves of the tree. Draco didn't really want to see it right now.
They shared a grin.
And Harry Potter.
So he went to the library.
When Dumbledore finally,
He had been prepared to see her again. But even though she was a lot thinner and a lot older-looking than Snape remembered or even imagined her to be, it was like being transported back in time, when they were younger and life was brighter, when he and Lily were still the best of friends, when Petunia sent him cross looks every time he picked Lily up for their mandatory Saturday afternoon walk by the lake…
So Harry helps him up and Draco
Lucius' eyes widened at the sight of his son.

own blood and flesh.
Harry recalls it, 11-year-old Draco and the hand that he refused. He blinks, surprised at Draco’s reaction. Surprised that Draco still remembers that moment and thinks much of it.
Harry choked on his own saliva yet again.
Potter kept his back straight and his elbows on the table, but his eyes met hers and they were
After his parents had left, he had rushed to the dorms, burst into Potter's room, and opened his chest. As he expected, the Invisibility Cloak lay inside all folded and pretty.
A flurry of movement beside Harry made him jump in shock, but he quickly calmed down after realizing that it was just Severus. The calm didn’t last for long, however, as all sorts of emotions attacked him then. He felt embarrassment that he had been caught eavesdropping and shame at the realization that Severus had heard the words that Draco’s mother had said.
“My mother will be livid with you.”
Immediately, Draco’s head shoot up. He’s staring at Harry in disbelief. “What?”
Quick eyes had him seeing that the object the cat was currently sitting on was a picture of him.
Nothing at all.

But they step into the Courtyard and snow falls on the tip of Draco’s nose, and it’s the first snowfall of the year, and it’s beautiful and
Severus was silent for a moment. He regarded Draco with those hard eyes of his, as if mulling over what he was about to say first. "Harry will be staying with us. But worry not, Draco. I assure you you won't see him for the remainder of your summer vacation, if you wish it."
He and Viktor Krum tied for first place.
“Just go through that wall,” Sirius told him and it wasn’t really Harry’s fault that he whipped his head around to look at Sirius disbelievingly because the man did have a starling record of pranks. Sirius laughed at his expression. “I’m serious, Harry!”
When Potter looked up, Draco saw his eyes. Unfocused, glassy, and green. Bright green.
As expected, Ginny’s eyes widened at the thought of Harry doing a corkscrew dive just to avoid Malfoy. “Why on earth would he –“
His pinched expression looked a tad bit relieved, though, when he finally stood beside Hagrid.
Harry coughed in an effort to reduce his embarrassment. “Kiss it,” he said, trying to go for noncommittal.
The boy certainly made no mention of it.
And he knew that it was to keep sensitive information funneled around Potter, to make it easier to control the information that went out and to track if ever there would be anyone that even thought of leaking them.
Harry was not mollified.
"Then get hit."
Ginny takes hold of his sleeve. Harry looks at her, surprised, and she nudges her head towards Draco’s direction.
The closed curtains were not a surprise. If these Muggles were half as intelligent as Snape thought them to be, then they would have already figured out that sunlight was bad for Harry Potter.
Madame Pomfrey nodded.

cast the spell, but that didn't compare to the list of possible love candidates that Lavender Brown was compiling with some of the fifth-year Hufflepuffs.
"Nothing!" Draco answered quickly, pressing the Cloak closer to his body, as if it might protect him from Severus' wrath. Draco hadn't seen Severus that mad since the Weasley twins charmed his hair into pink two years ago. The Weasley twins weren't seen around Hogwarts for a week.
The first thing that Draco said when he Flooed inside Harry’s flat was: “I wasn’t joking about the wine, Potter.”
"You're not coming?" Draco asked, unable to keep the surprise from his voice. He immediately felt embarrassed. It almost sounded like… he wanted Potter to go with him.
"I'd say that counts as saving my life," Potter said amicably. "So maybe you can get out of your room now and stop moping?"
magic of the diadem. It took almost an hour of intense concentration, but oh, Mother Magic, Merlin, and Morgana had he done it! There was still the Horcrux, but there were no curses whatsoever.
and two unknown curses.  His eyes widened.  The Minister must be getting very angry to cast such curses verbally.  A glance at the class and Professor Flitwick showed that they were all as worried as he was (though he didn’t show it as much, and he quickly compartmentalized it).
Then came the tricky part, every 4 minutes -- exactly -- they had to stir 16 times clockwise and add a whole terrafire lizard that had been only fed may bells. Once they did that, their potion was thick and matte black and ready for the last step. Hermione took her mother-of-pearl dagger and slit her fingertip, squeezing four drops of blood into the potion. It swirled, and its matte color turned shiny and iridescent, like the oil spills Hermione had seen in pictures.
“I am not a sssssnake, m’Lord.”
and dismissed the class 25 minutes early.  Harry didn’t get up, and he waved away Padma and Cho in favor of letting his head rest against the cold brick.
Harry cast charm after charm, all in a quick succession that had Susan backing up and reinforcing her
Harry measured out 2 mL of peppermint oil and waited for the water to boil before pouring it into the cauldron. He crushed the sunstone, one gram at a time, while Hermione added each one, stirring clockwise four times between.
“Today, we will be testing our Amarenovis and then going over what we did and how we can improve.  I know you did this in partners, but you will be graded and assessed individually due to the sensitive nature of Amortentia and Amarenovis.  In the meantime, you will be working on the potion written on the board.  I will be calling you individually, and you will switch potions with the person called before you when it is your turn.  This potion will be graded, so obviously, try your best.  Now, first up for Amarenovis, Terry Boot.”
"Wait, Harry, I was joking! You know I love you, shortness notwithstanding." Draco pouted.
As soon as the Minister left Hogwarts, Harry felt the tension leak out of him, though he didn’t exactly know why he was so relaxed all of a sudden.  He just shrugged and headed to lunch with Hermione and Draco.  When Harry sat down at the Ravenclaw table, all the 7th years (and Luna) crowded around him, concerned.  When he was younger, he would have minded their nosiness, but now they were his family, and family could be nosy out of concern.
Why I used everything -
Debates could go on for hours or even days, but thankfully Cho’s team won in time for them to go to bed at a reasonable hour (11 pm).  When they all finished, Harry was brushing his teeth and pointedly not thinking about the Minister’s
Peals of laughter rang out in the chamber as they clambered over each other, roughhousing and ruffling hair, reveling in the ability to touch each other for the first time. They would need to plan grand schemes and minute details soon enough, but for now, time stood still just long enough for the two of them.
The Minister’s red eyes narrowed when he tried probing at Harry’s mental walls and found them stronger than before.
frigus - general cooling charm
“Anyway, I’m quite intrigued on why he’s coming to Hogwarts instead of having people apply like normal apprenticeships,”  Hermione said, addressing Harry and Draco in the comfort of the carriage.
Cho countered, “Yes, but not every spell needs to be time, focus, and energy-intensive.  You could quickly transfigure a thrown knife to butterflies or open up a hole in the ground.  If you were outdoors, you could use the environment to your advantage!”
“Harry Potter and Susan Bones.”
When he was in his bed, in his pajamas, he took out the diary and started writing.
“We have been invited to the annual bonfire and rites this year, as well as the Black family rites, in addition to the--” James paused and swallowed, “Our familial rites.”
Harry woke up just before midday, groggily stretching his stiff limbs and massaging his aching palms.  His makeup had mostly rubbed off, but pigment lingered under his eyes, and so when he staggered to the bathroom, he splashed his face with water and a palm magic
We're 3/4 of the way through the Facetious Arc!! (Remember when this was supposed to only be 1 chapter skdfsdjnk)
Harry mumbled something unintelligible into Tom’s linen shirt, and Tom just laughed again.
ventus calidus - hot air charm
Hermione was worried. She had only ever seen Harry get angry (not annoyed, irritated, or mad) two times. The first was in their 1st Year, and Draco had called Hermione mudblood scum. Harry had gotten all stony, icy, wrong, and Draco had woken up drenched in mud, pigs’ blood, and pond scum from the Black Lake (all of his clothes and bed sheets were too).

Father would either answer acidly or not at all, so Cousin Rhodesia didn’t bother waiting around for his answer, or pointing it towards him, opting to serve herself some papaya and drink her cardamom chai.  Harry smiled tightly and served himself some papaya as well; he could never get it at Hogwarts, and even if he did, it wouldn’t be nearly as good as it would be at home.  Everything tasted better at home, even if James was there to sour it all.
“Quite.  The ritual was quite taxing.”

“Good to see your manners are still salvageable despite all the rumors I’ve heard about you.  Come in; you’re letting the cold and warm air mix.”
They all murmured, “Blessed Samhain,” back, heads bowed accordingly.
The Minister let out a raspy, sibilant ki-ki-ki, and it took the class a few seconds to realize that the Minister was laughing.
Harry gleefully picked it up with reverence, tucked it carefully into his satchel bag, put on his cloak, and headed to the Chamber of Secrets. He had a quick conversation with Myrtle and paid his respects to Aquitaine the basilisk, but otherwise, he made his way down to the ritual room quickly.
Professor Black looked at them sternly before continuing, “Amortentia is one of the worst potions out there, which is why we no longer teach you how to make it and focus on the antidote, instead. Now, I have posted the instructions on the board, so gather your ingredients and begin.”
Harry did not react outwardly other than a narrowing of his eyes as he shoved all his (icy, frigid, so cold it burned) anger behind his Occlumency shields. Hermione led him to their assigned table and waited for Professor Black to start class.

Harry pulled back his magic and carefully prodded the diary when a tall man about 20 suddenly appeared, landing on the floor. Scrambling back, both the man and Harry panted, chests heaving in sync. Then the man looked at Harry and

They bowed to each other and squared off in a proper dueling stance.  Harry had never felt so small and helpless as he felt standing in front of the Minister, who was annoyingly tall and intimidating.

that Susan skillfully deflected, but she was put back on defensive.
If a Horcrux underneath Harry’s pillow became increasingly anxious as he mulled over the information he had been given, it was obviously due to his annoyance over how far his main soul piece had fallen. It was obviously not because Tom was the only other being who knew exactly what happened to Vivian Penmark or his fondness for Harry.
Hermione looked at him like he was denser than limestone before replying in a droll voice, “He’s coming to the Opening Feast because he’s looking for an apprentice. That was all was in your letter, Harry.  Please tell me you read it.”
T/W Reference to the past sexual assault of a minor and the Minister's usual creepiness.
At that, Harry shut the book and slid it back under his pillow.  He absentmindedly checked on his mind-space functions and settled down to do the same thing he did last night: run through, file, and weave all his memories and emotions.  Soon enough, he finished, just in time to get an actual good night of sleep.  He fluffed his pillows, messed with his blankets, and curled up on his side.  Harry exhaled and stretched out his limbs, trying his hardest to find a comfortable position, but to no avail; his mind and body were racing, reacting to all the new information he received.
Standing in the open room filled Harry with a sense of wonder, but he had no time to spare, so he quickly opened up his satchel and took out white chalk. On the stone floor, he drew a heptagon, straight lines crisscrossing all the way through, continually referencing the diagram and instructions Tom had written in the diary. After setting up the general shape, he summoned the basalt, letting his magic permeate the air. Harry took the basalt and meticulously sprinkled it over the pre-drawn lines. He dared not breathe as he evenly distributed it all and only did so when he had completely finished, taking a steep breath and inhaling harshly.
"Turpin, Ava-Rose."
And that box in the middle of his mindscape!  What on Mother Magic’s earth was that?? What did Harry deem to be so important to hide that he locked it up in a floating chest, chains, deadbolts, and numerous keys (useless, all of them) draped over the box? The Minister had tried and tried again to get inside of it, but the damned thing wouldn’t budge no matter how hard he pushed.  What was in there??
“Blessed Samhain,” the whole plaza chorused back.

Of course, he was impressed with the grades (O’s in everything except for an EE in Runes, which was well known as the most challenging subject at Hogwarts).  He had also aced his OWLS and was looking at a very promising future.  But there was nothing speaking of his magical prowess, nothing of what he was like.  Nothing at all.
People gave Harry anxious looks throughout breakfast, but he paid them no mind and conversed with his friends instead, gleaning what had happened the past two days from them.  He tried his best to push all thoughts of the Minister out of his mind, but he wasn’t very successful.  Thank Merlin today was his self-study day.
"Beach, Bernice.”  Was called out, and the sorting began in earnest.
Back in his dorm, after all the introductions and his overprotective friends were done, he sat on his bed.  He had changed into pajamas and drew the curtains.  He cast secrecy charms and wards, not wanting his secret to get out.  Harry could hear the rustling of Michael and Terry (his only roommates), so he waited till all he could hear was the flipping of pages and scratching of quills.

When he entered the Great Hall, flanked by Hermione and Draco, his magic hummed lowly, causing the candles near the ceiling to burn a little bit brighter, so he reigned it back in and bundled it uptight.
With Father not speaking and Cousin Rhodesia not budging on her stance, breakfast quickly ended, and Harry went outside to the horses.  He had thrown a cloak on over his robes, and combined with the sun; he was pleasantly warm.  There were only two horses: a bay mare named Turnip, which Harry had named when he was quite little, and a dappled mare named Chand.  Acorn happily greeted Harry and led him to Turnip, saddling her for a ride.

“Many thanks.”
When he was back in his room, he told Tom all about his research, and then they discussed the week and what to do when the 72 hours were up (it would be in the middle of Charms class). As always, Tom was remarkably helpful, and Harry was extremely glad he had Tom as a resource and a friend.
Headmaster Snape took a breath before answering, "That's all there is to the school files.  The only additional information that could be added is if he was a Quidditch player or was an especially problematic child, and he is neither."
To which everyone said, “

The plaza was decorated with all sorts of lanterns and flowers, garlands of marigolds and carnations and white roses floating through the air.  Dripping candles drifted about, contained in clear bubble charms.  The sunset saturated Moonlight Plaza, making it and all the people glow with a hazy, orangey sheen.
The Minister recalled every person he had killed for his Horcruxes (Myrtle Warren, Tom Riddle Sr., Hepzibah Smith, Mcauley O'Brien, Eliyas Woodley, Bertha Jorkins) and he rarely killed outside of them.  He had only ever killed three people for non-Horcrux reasons.  Tom Riddle Sr.’s parents were two of them, and that was for revenge.  But there was a final woman he had killed.  Lily Evans.  Her death had been a tragedy, but she had discovered the Ravenclaw Diadem and figured out what it was (but not for whom), so, regretfully, he killed her in her own home.  The stupid woman had thought she was here for the baby and had practically thrown herself in front of his wand.
“Last class, we went over the usefulness of charms in duels.  Now, you have all written your three sheaf essay on which charms you would utilize, so we will be testing them out in today’s practical.  Remember, duel to incapacitate, not kill, though it is important to know how to in a life or death situation.”
“C’mon! Let’s go!”  Draco called, linking his arms in Harry and Hermione’s, and walking to the Great Hall with his friends.  None of them would admit it sober or during the day, but they all had very lonely childhoods and found great comfort in each other and the easy, undemanding relationship.
“Cousin Harry!” Little Cousin Aquila screeched out, forgoing etiquette when she ran up to him in a flurry of wild hair and white linen.  Harry laughed and picked her up, spinning her around, Little Cousin Aquila squealing in delight.  When he set her down, Cousin Rhodesia, Uncle Sirius, and Uncle Moony all looked at the both of them with similar, kind fondness (though Uncle Sirus’ had a tinge of grief).  Cousin Ingram was apathetic as always, and Father’s face was pinched, though it was nothing to worry about -- he was always annoyed when he saw little children, even his own relatives.
Unfortunately, the Minister was undeterred by Harry’s anger and asked again, the room's edges freezing over.  Professor Black, sensing how dangerous the situation was getting, said in a way that belied his anxiousness, “Minister Peverell, perhaps you are familiar with the Vivian Penmark case?”
If anything, it made Harry more confident (but never smug), and Harry’s spell casting became sharper, brighter, and more powerful.  The Minister was getting angry at having lost the upper hand and became sloppy.  He had the air of a competent dueller who had spent too long at the top and had gotten complacent, and Harry tasted blood.
Harry drifted in, and out of sleep, shapeless dreams floating around his head; yelling here, blurry shapes there; a clear face of whom exactly, he couldn't say, and horses bounded across his room.  He slept restlessly, plagued by dreams as he was, so when Harry woke up, it was as if he hadn’t gone to bed at all.  Harry groaned and rubbed his eyes viciously till he saw yellowy honeycombs behind his eyelids.
Harry stared at Draco in shock, pretend hurt visible on his face before quickly shooting back, "Well, that's why you look like a giraffe."
“Welcome,” they said in a booming yet indiscernible voice.  “Blessed Samhain.”
Yesterday had been quite exhausting emotionally, physically, and magically, so it was no surprise that Harry slept like the dead, and barely woke up in time for breakfast the next morning.  He did, though, which was the important part.  And, he woke up just in time -- and refreshed enough -- to cause absolute chaos.  He did so, by quickly getting ready for the day, and shoving Rowena Ravenclaw’s Diadem that hadn’t been seen in centuries into his school bag.  Harry then proceeded to get to breakfast, sit down right next to Luna, and place the Diadem on Luna’s head, right next to her massive Queen Alexandra butterfly hairpins.
Some information:
He shouldn’t have been surprised, he thought, resigned, by the unnatural shadows in the far left corner of the classroom, but he was, and Harry was very, very angry. Harry didn’t get angry often, but there was something about the Minister’s single-minded obsession with him that made icy cold rage fill his veins. This was the man responsible for his fucked up home life and James’ depression (Harry knew that James was an adult, yes, but the Minister shouldered some modicum of blame), and this was the man who slaughtered his mother.
if you'd like!
Harry’s stomach dropped.  That was his schedule, mocking him in black letters.  Divination, Double Astronomy, and Care today, but today was his self-study day.  What he was more worried about was the Double Charms, DADA, and Transfiguration tomorrow and the Potions, Double Alchemy, and Advanced Arithmancy on Friday.  Hermione and Draco both looked vaguely nauseous as they came to the same conclusion as Harry.
Ron - Jack Russel Terrier (canon Patronus)
At that, Terry walked over to Professor Black’s office, where a ministry official -- Madame Spinstra, the only person legally allowed to touch Amortentia -- was waiting.
As the trio approached the door, James swung them open, gesturing broadly, with a plasticky smile everyone could tell was false.
Harry made himself ignore the upcoming events, how Father was angry, and everything else, instead of clearing his mind and leading Turnip down the leaf-strewn path.  Mother Magic and Morgana, this was good for the soul.
wanted anyone to find out about.  He opened it, took out a self-inking quill, and began to write.
The hat finished, and soon enough, the sorting started, prefects, standing next to the first year sides of the table to help them get settled.
“But should you not play to your strengths?  And if you aren’t skilled enough with transfiguration, then you’d just make a fool of yourself and waste energy, but if you are, then that’s an advantage.” Marietta said in a placating way that only served to further the debate (which was her intention).
He then handed the note to Harry and said, “Well, off you go.”
form.  He quickly filed that away, moved onto lunch, then Transfiguration, then the debate, and finally dinner.  Usually, he didn’t have to do all this work; it ordinarily did it itself, but with his mind shields newly rebuilt, Harry had to help all the functions run properly (cataloging information, filing memories, etc.).
gaudium - cheering charm
Ravenclaw’s Diadem.”
The Headmaster said, in a blasé tone that belied his true feelings, “The Minister has decided that, for the rest of the days of the week, he will be observing several classes to better learn about the students.  A schedule of his observation is in front of each student, so peruse that to your heart’s content.”
The Minister’s magic tensed, poised to strike, and sensing danger, and Headmaster Snape diverted his attention by saying, “While the file may not be able to tell you much, I know the boy quite well, so I could give you any information you would like.”
Professor Flitwick cast an invisible barrier that would absorb any fly away spells (as well as detritus, shrapnel, and anything else that could occur in a duel) but still allowed the audience to watch.
The Unspeakable led the group to one of the many bonfires where the rest of the Black families and the Nott family were.  As they walked towards their assigned bonfire, Harry scanned the plaza for Hermione and Draco.  Harry saw a glimpse of Hermione by the rest of the mundane-borns, so he wouldn’t be able to speak to her, but the Malfoy family was with the Black families, so tamping down the urge to run over and chatter excitedly, Harry waved and relished in the shock Draco’s body language portrayed.  Little Cousin Aquila tugged on Harry’s arm, eyes wide and excited behind her tiny dove mask.  She looked absolutely darling.
Susan and Harry bowed and faced off, waiting for Professor Flitwick’s countdown.
Harry immediately went on defensive as the Minister sent a flurry of spells, all of them a bright, sickly yellow.  When fighting an unknown opponent, Harry always went on defensive to see which spells they relied on, how they moved, and any other information he could catalog on them.  He used the Minister’s skill and his initial nervousness to hide that he was collecting data.  Sure, he had been scared, but now he was in his element.  Harry knew he had enough skill to come out of this reasonably unscathed, even if he lost.
Harry asked again: “Father, you have been paying the house-elves, yes?”
What a powerful, powerful boy his Harry was.  While the loss smarted his pride, what a glorious loss it was.  Harry Potter was a formidable opponent and would only grow better with time.  Harry’s ingenuity, swiftness, and range of spells made him a very, very talented duelist.  That combination of
Basalt Sand - Stabilizer (Basalt represents stability and steadfastness)
“My apologies,” Harry murmured, bowing his head.
“I know.  I can feel his eyes burning holes into me.  It’s like he wants me to look at him.”  Harry whispered back.
Harry couldn’t wait to get out of that classroom. It felt like he was being watched.  Every so often, the hairs on the back of his neck would stand up, and he would have to untense his muscles and even out his breathing.  Draco had noticed and was furtively looking around the room, looking for unnatural shadows, warped tiles, or faint shimmering (any sign of the Minister).  He had no such luck and was just as happy as Harry to flee from the classroom when Professor Escrivá dismissed them all.  The Minister left in the flurry of students and went back to his office in the Ministry to catch up on paperwork and plan out his next move.
Some info:
(See the end of the chapter for
Back inside, Harry noticed that Cousin Rhodesia had left, and a nervous Billa informed him that Father was napping and he, “Best be resting as well,” so Harry smiled and agreed, heading to his room.  He stripped and fell straight into bed, barely staying awake long enough to set an alarm.
Hermione stepped away and nodded her agreement, linking her arms with Harry’s on his right side, Draco linking his on Harry’s left.  They walked to the DADA classroom, and it seemed that everyone, from the littlest first year to all their year mates, knew about the incident in Charms.  Harry sighed but shrugged the whispers off and entered the room.
They were all dismissed for their next class, and Professor Escrivá left with them to talk to Professor Vector.  Halfway to the common room, Harry realized he had forgotten his textbook, so, waving away all his friends, he quickly walked back over to the DADA classroom.  He quickly made his way back but froze at the sight in front of him.  It was the Minister casting the
The Minister just watched all the reactions with an impassive face, uncaring of the effect he had on the students until he got to the short Ravenclaw he was especially interested in.  He would have to figure out who that was.  His intrigue tripled when his magic brushed up against another’s magic: dove grey mixed with a bright, almost unnatural lavender and extraordinarily powerful.  Without another thought, he let his magic envelop the other mass.
They waited for the potion to settle for precisely 24 minutes and 20 seconds before unceremoniously dumping the rose stems. After waiting 16 minutes and 12 seconds, Hermione added the rose leaves too.
Harry didn’t know much about his housemates' projects, just enough to know what he shouldn’t do for his. He knew a little more about Hermione and Draco’s, but it was mostly cursory information rather than actual explanations. And anyway, it didn’t matter because Harry was much more focused on his own project: predicting chaos. In his youth, he had formed a fascination with predicting everything (hence why he took Arithmancy and Divination), and that had snowballed into a near obsession in predicting chaos. There were plenty of muggle studies on that sort of thing, but Harry wanted to know the true way to predict chaos, and that is why he needed to get scouted to become an Unspeakable. Being an Unspeakable would allow him to study chaos and eventually learn to predict it.
The house-elves, bless them, brought up food and water during lunchtime, as they were accustomed to Ravenclaws elbow-deep in research, and knew that nothing could make them leave before they were done. Dinner, though, was a different story, and the house-elves gave them an hour's warning to wrap up before unceremoniously kicking them all out, to the amusement of the 1st years who had never seen anything like that before.
Blaise - Hyena (cunning, motherly, hunters, familial, social, survivors)
Damnit!  Draco won the bet, and by his smirks, he was enjoying the win.  But he didn’t recognize the name.  Was she the first muggle-born Slytherin in 10 years?  By the mutinous looks of some of the older students, she was, but the girl took it in stride, walking confidently, with near-perfect posture and a perfect mask.
Also, Tom's magic was totally sexually harassing/assaulting the students.  Like chill dude ever heard of boundaries...?
The Latin means, "Accept our offerings Lady Magic."
It was an eerie smile, and Harry was petrified.  With a shaky voice, he asked, “W-what are the rules of this d-duel?”
Harry countered with a
He stalked out of the room, anger clouding around him like a wraith.
The Potter grounds were fairly large, not anything too excessive, but nothing to scoff at, and certainly enough for a nice ride.  Cooing to Turnip, he coached her into a light canter, basking in the autumn sunlight.  Riding her past a line of trees, he admired the amber, sunshine, and copper leaves, supported by bleached birch trunks and branches.  Harry led Turnip into the forest, gravel and leaves crunching under her hooves as they trotted down the path.  With a sigh and a smile, Harry let the tension leak out of him, a light breeze ruffling his hair and blowing his cloak.
“If you don’t want it, it’s fine. I’ve got another gift for you but I have to place it under the tree first –“ Harry rushed out, but stopped when Draco flicked his forehead with a finger. “Ow!”
And then it broke.

And as easy as
Harry watched, dizzy, as his blood was collected in a glass phial, and then poured inside the cauldron. He watched like he had been separated from his body, like he was watching all these unfold like an outsider, as the cauldron sizzled, then spluttered, until it was sending hot streams of viscous liquid everywhere, and then –
Theodore whistled lowly as Harry walked into view. "Now that's a rare sight to see," he grinned.
He didn't expect the wizarding world to suddenly change their views on muggleborns like a switch at the death of Voldemort, but he also didn't expect…
Ginny’s nose scrunched up. She picked up the slice of tart on her plate and took a huge bite. “I’m over Harry,” she said through a mouthful. It came out muffled but being her brother gave you translating abilities. Ginny swallowed. “And he’s gay. And how will my flirting with him save the day?”
And it was this Harry—not Auror Potter—that asked him again, “How are you feeling?”
"Uh-huh," Ginny said and thankfully left it at that.
Harry looked at it, could almost imagine it was Voldemort’s eye looking at him, still watching him even after all these years.
The kiss slows down, and the movements of their tongues become lazy until they’re just repeatedly kissing each others lips, soft sighs coming out in small breaths.

Harry paused at this.
Harry placed his lips on top of Draco's, and it felt wonderful, and soft and chapped and gentle and
“I… Thank you.”
Harry didn't even feel sorry – he was absolutely shaking with anger as he stood up from his position on the floor and rounded on Lavender.
Harry was pretty sure the whole of Hogwarts
He wasn't prepared for the small smile that Potter gave him in reply. "Yes, I am, Malfoy. Remember.

The memories that he recalls now are a different kind, one that consists of stone floors, metal bars, a sinking coldness that penetrated your very bones, and the choice he made to avoid it.
Draco raised an even pointier eyebrow back. “It really was just that. It felt like Crucio, the one that Voldemort used to do on us to make the Marks hurt.”
“I…” Draco starts, and then pauses. He huffs. “Am I not anymore?”
"I do not

With a loud pop, they were gone.
Soon, loud pops and crackles in the air were heard all around them.

“I know. But you didn’t… have to.”
which is more likely to be honest, no offense –"
Draco scoffed. "I already believe it. It's much easier to believe than Potter working for the Dark Lord. I always had this suspicion that Potter acted like a stinking Gryffindor sometimes. It's absolutely disgraceful."
Draco couldn’t quite keep the judgment from his voice. “…Help.”
“Okay,” Harry said, still chuckling. “Alright. Then I’ve got your back.” He was rewarded with a smug smile. He swung his wand around himself. “
Harry is quick to assure her. “Oh, no, I didn’t think that.”
“I’m not really ‘keeping it’,” Harry said, shrugging. “It comes and goes. It doesn’t even sleep or eat here. It just lounges on my couch a lot.”
“You little bugger.”
Draco opens his mouth for his next retort.
Harry flushed; he had no idea about French kissing. He and Ginny had never gotten that far, but – but
His head was
Harry hesitated, before nodding.
As soon as Kreacher disappeared with a pop, Draco stomped upstairs to Potter's room.
“I…” Potter started, licking his lips nervously. “I’m not sure.”

He cuts them up anyway, because he

Ginny fell out of her seat.
“He’s a stranger to touch,” he said instead. He met Lupin’s eyes levelly. “Reprimand him if need be, but do not yell at him, do not raise a hand at him, and do not show any acts of anger in front of him, lest you want all of us to go back to square one. And for Merlin’s sake, do not let him near any cupboard under the stairs or do any household chore on his own.”
Harry startled, looking at him in question.
He also tried to listen to the lecture, but his thoughts were faraway, filled with Draco Malfoy and Self-Erasing Parchments.
Severus was making a very pained expression. "Harry
Harry shook his head, only to wince because it made his head throb. “If you hadn’t kissed me, even if you kissed the Snitch, you wouldn’t have seen the message. But I would have given the wine to you either way, I s’pose,” he muttered.
And he was gone, disappearing from the edge of the frame.
have skill on his own and was a respectable Auror in his own right.
He had planned to pull back almost immediately, but Draco’s left hand took hold of his collar and crumpled the cloth in his fist at the same time Draco’s right, the one holding the Golden Snitch, wound around Harry’s waist to press against his back, effectively pushing their bodies flush against each other.
Draco shrugged.
A lot of the Gryffindors and even some Hufflepuffs came up to him in random intervals demanding—err, asking him who the lucky girl was. The Patil twins were very persistent. Justin Finch-Fletchley asked him if it was a guy. Romilda Vane threw herself on his lap and tried to kiss him but only managed to spill his pumpkin juice on her.
The headache was getting better. He really should get to making that Head-Healing Draught for Victims of Crucio. The usual draughts never seemed to work well. He’d developed a recipe for it during his dark days in the Manor when Voldemort was still alive, but never got around to making it on the account of constantly being in fear for his life. After that, it got swept under the rug by his Auror training and pretty much just proving to everyone that he wasn’t going to start murdering them all.
“Banana pancakes.”

The next day at breakfast, Draco asked, "Won't I get a sanction from the Ministry for the Levitation Charm I used on Potter?"
Harry flicked a hand and the window slid to the side just enough to let the cat through.
In the middle of the stone circle, Malfoy stopped abruptly.
From the side of his eye, he squinted at Potter and at his robes. It didn’t seem like the same one Potter wore when they had delved down into the Chamber of Secrets. That one had a ripped seam on the collar.
days, Potter!" he growled, even as he jumped off his broom in one fluid motion and stomped the rest of the way.
“For what, then?”
With a sigh, he knelt down in front of the child and used a finger to gently tilt his head up for their eyes to meet.
, I will
The forest was still and quiet.
He didn’t think that Draco did much of Potions anymore, what with being busy with Auror fieldworks and paper works, but he still remembered how passionate the blond was for the subject back during their Hogwarts days. (At least, when Draco wasn’t busy being a prat or insulting Harry’s hair.) He remembered how he’d let his eyes travel to Draco Malfoy during class, a habit that translated into situations even
And then the burst of flames.
Draco nonchalantly takes his napkin and lays it over his lap. “Yes, she sent it over yesterday. Mother likes it.”
He read all about Time Turners after that.
He knew immediately that it was a wrong thing to say, but was still surprised at how uncomfortable he felt seeing the hurt flash across Potter's face.
All heads turned to Severus, who leveled his gaze on them all, cool and firm. Lucius and Narcissa were both hardheaded, Draco supposed it came with being a pureblood and all its entitlement, but he also secretly believed that his godfather was more stubborn than both of his parents combined.
And Harry kind of wished that he chose something else to say, because it really was awkward talking about his bits with the person he'd been pathetically pining after for years.
As they neared the Quidditch Pitch, Harry could see the black form of something curled up on the grass… A black cat.
were.
She suddenly jumped and enveloped Harry in a big hug, smiling widely. "Harry, that's great!"
"The floor looks infested," he found himself saying instead. No wonder his mother never brought him here.
Draco’s voice abruptly cut through the panic attack that was brewing in him as if dousing him with refreshing cold water.
Also, as he looked at the red dragon on his gloved palm,
. She turned to Harry. "We visited you in the Hospital Wing earlier, but you were still sleeping. Don't worry, I'll talk to Ginny later," she said firmly, giving the mentioned girl a stern glare.
Five years, and for some reason, he is still expecting Malfoy to revert back into the git he was in Hogwarts. Harry supposed it was out of habit. Or a certain hope that he could still read Malfoy as easily as he could in the past. This Malfoy was different. Changed. And Harry, for the past year, had started to find that uncomfortable.
that they had happened, once upon a time. Whenever that time was now. He could still remember how fun it was to race with someone as skilled as Draco and how they would sneak out even after dinner to go for rounds around the Manor or around Hogwarts.
Potter still didn't look mollified, but he paused, looked at Draco's face, and nodded. "Thank you. Severus will, err… help. I don't know how often it will happen, but…" He shrugged.
, he thought, even as he raised the egg in the air with a huge grin on his face.
to be friends with that ex-Death Eater, someone who’s a little insane.”
He accelerated into the air, towards the castle, ignoring the screeching cries of rage from behind him. The dragon was fast, Harry realized with his heart thumping in his chest. Fast for a 15-foot and some thousand pounds dragon.
That was improvement!
like this.
Remus. Tonks. Fred. Snape. Dumbledore. Cedric. Sirius.
He needed to find Potter.
They reached Potter’s office, which was really just a small room with a desk and two chairs in front of the window, a long bench pushed to one side, and a tall, potted plant in the corner of the other side. All possible surfaces were littered with piles and piles of parchment, except for the bench which had a pillow and haphazardly folded blanket.
Everyone’s still suffering and
Draco looked uncomfortable. He frowned, eyes fixed on the parchment even as the words disappeared. Finally, after a brief period of silence, he shrugged, seeming nonchalant. "Haven't kissed her yet?"
Draco merely smirked at him.
Realizing that he was not alone anymore, Draco looked up and he blinked hard at the sight of books hovering in mid-air. Quickly, Harry put the books down on the nearest hard surface and fished his wand from his pocket to take off the Disillusionment charm. He carried the books again.
Harry thought. He blinked some more, not really expecting that but thinking that he probably should have. He did have Malfoy's wand, in his trunk in Gryffindor Tower. He had thought of returning it, but either forgot about it or lost his nerve whenever he'd try to. Besides, Draco already had a new wand, but Harry reckoned it didn't work as good as his old one.
“You say a lot of idiotic things.”
He was surprised to see Draco grinning back. "Should you really be insulting me right now, after you had me go through detention despite my charity and kindness to help you –"
Harry tried to keep himself from smiling but figured he probably failed.
"Surely, Poppy, you won't keep a man from a tearful reunion with his injured son?"
Thank you so much for your kind words so far! <3 It makes my day reading them!
“Still not perfect. I’ll have to tweak it a bit more.”
The week passed by in a flash. Their summer homework was done, and Draco finally managed to get their Quidditch score to 29-28. (Potter deliberately took the last piece of pie that night, out of spite.) Their Wizard's Chess score became 8-0. Draco didn't know why Potter still tried.
What could be about this last horcrux that Potter deemed it necessary to withhold information from his friends?
“Just.” Potter ran a hand down his face, before sending him a grateful smile. “Been busy lately.”
Now that he was here… Nothing was going to stop him from getting to the Triwizard Cup.
He could almost see the hat smirking.
and thought rather pitifully:
“Malfoy,” he started, looking back, but Malfoy was already walking past him, towards the bald spot on the bank.
Draco Malfoy isn’t supposed to look like this.
Harry's world zeroed in on that voice then and on that familiar smirk. The same thing happened every time Draco talked to him. Granted, it occurred more often than Harry was comfortable with, even after four years of being housemates. It always tore him inside how much he wanted to be friends with Draco again, and at the same time how afraid he was that the same thing would happen in the end.
Draco wished very, very hard that this Side-Along Apparition wasn't going to end up like his last one. His last one had been with his father, and Draco hadn't known about their destination.
After the war, Harry didn't hear much of Malfoy, other than he was on probation for three years. Harry was surprised the day he arrived in the newly-renovated Hogwarts for his eight year and saw Draco Malfoy in the Great Hall. What surprised him even more was that the Slytherin had looked so pale, so subdued… so very different to the proud and regal Malfoy demeanor.
Afterwards, when all of them had gotten their own dragons, Harry almost felt jealous of them. At least they would only have to deal with the fear for a few hours. He had known for
Potter is arranging his robes as neatly as he can, before he takes out his wand again, taps the Map, and says, “Mischief managed.”
“Yeah, well, you don’t beat Voldemort empty-handed.”
“I don’t spend the rest of my days stuck in the wheelchair waiting for the next time Saint Potter comes back to save me, you know.”
spy on Harry a bit, see what he did during his days off, and then give Harry the shock of his life when the cat in his flat suddenly transforms into Draco Malfoy.
He went through a box with hourglasses of different shapes and sizes, some dried inkwells and a few broken quills, before he found the golden box with the label that read: L I L Y.
Remus released the breath that he hadn’t realized he was holding. Relief flooded through his whole system so unexpectedly that his eyes started to get warm. He had long since forgotten what acceptance felt like. He only ever got it from Sirius now but it was different to get it from someone whom you haven’t known for decades.
He was grateful that he had studied and practiced the Riddikulus Spell on his own before the Third Task. He was grateful that it worked. He didn't want to ask for help from Severus or Remus, because he was already sure what form the Boggart would take.
, of course, to get his nerves and wits together, but that had been done in private, after he had left Kingsley’s Office to ponder about the repercussions of accepting such a mission.
Harry only managed to escape the chaos and the grabby hands grasping at his clothes with the help of Madame Hooch, who had come to save the day with broomsticks.
His gaze is vacant, staring blankly at his plate.
Draco's eyes brightened.
Did his mother not know…
Draco smiled at Potter wryly. “I know. But I held it against myself enough that it didn’t matter whether he did or didn’t.”
Suddenly, the quiet of the Common Room became suffocating. Draco gritted his teeth, and turned, stomping his way back to the dungeons.
A sharp intake of breath. And then an accusatory “…You don’t say that and expect me to wait a moment.”
And then there was the fact that he was a vampire, just like Voldemort, and well, from what happened three days ago with Narcissa Malfoy, he knew now that his being a vampire was going to be a problem.
“Me, too,” Ginny says, head shaking. Her eyes are shining, and it’s obvious she’s fighting the tears back. “Last year, Harry, Hogwarts wasn’t even a school anymore. People were allowed to do certain… things.”
His fork drops in surprise. Flushing, he looks up. “Malfoy.”
The cat’s nose wrinkled.
“No –“ He found himself croaking out on impulse. “Absolutely not.” Inwardly, he cursed himself. He should have explained this better. “I have to… work for a while. But I can’t take you with me. It’s too dangerous and I don’t want you to get hurt. So I asked the help of some…
He wasn't a vampire. He didn't know what he would do if he was Turned into one.
“Absolutely not,” came the haughty answer.
The Slytherin first year boys had two rooms, each with three beds. Before the Time Turner, it was Harry, Draco and Goyle who shared a room while Blaise, Theodore and Crabbe shared the other. After the Time Turner, Harry realized that he and Blaise had switched places.
He covered himself and the fireplace with a Silencing Charm and let loose the infernal screams of agony from the egg. When he finally closed it, he found Remus' green head in the fireplace smiling widely and Harry knew at once that Remus had figured out the answer.
they had with Professor Dumbledore.
Theodore rolled his eyes at him. “To the Great Hall. The Goblet of Fire’s going to be spitting out the names of the lucky contestants for the Triwizard Tournament today.”
He didn't think that his father had actually believed that the Dark Lord would return, until… Until Little Hangleton.
Harry rolled his eyes in amusement. He wisely did not give notice to the fact that it was eleven in the evening and that they were wanted fugitives who have been hiding from society for the past decade.
Karkaroff caught it in his hand and unfolded it. His eyes widened, and he looked at Dumbledore.
chocolate frog.
When he opens his eyes, he looks straight at Harry’s and says, “I’m telling you now.”
Harry was surprised at his answer. "Thanks, Malfoy. I guess."
Harry could feel a flush creeping to his face.
But there
He could admit that he considered them as friends now after all those flying lessons and those midnight rendezvouses in the living room with both of them carrying bloodshot eyes and haunted looks from nightmares unspoken of. All those afternoons spent comparing their summer homework and hushed whispers about what was going on in the Wizarding World with Voldemort back on the rise. All that time spent fighting over the last scoop of mashed potatoes.

knew that Pansy had a crush on him.
That was true.
Harry groaned. He flipped Draco his middle finger as he stomped his way towards the dorms. "I'll wait for those 50 galleons, Malfoy."
In front of him, Potter chuckled at his comment. “Men in power usually are.”
Snape looked back at him with a grim expression. He knew what Dumbledore was going to say.
Bugger.
A hand nonchalantly slides up inside his shirt and rests on the small of his back, big and warm.
But Harry just walked past him, sending a light breeze to blow softly by Draco's cheek, and Draco was left there, amidst the broken shards of glass that resembled the state of his heart ever since his mother had told him through tears that he was scheduled to take the Dark Mark.
badge.
So he walked to the Fat Lady's Portrait, wrote the password on her dress with his wand, and sprinted up to his dorm.
“Harry,” Ginny pleads, a day after all the Halloween festivities. It is late in the afternoon, and the sky is an overcast grey. In an hour, it will be dinnertime. They’re sitting together in one of the stone benches in the clock tower courtyard, where Ginny had cornered him in a last ditch effort. “The Ravenclaws are
After a few moments, after realizing that the two men snogging in the middle of the room wasn’t about to stop anytime soon, the partygoers all went back to their business, amused grins on their faces and shaking their heads knowingly.
“But he’s my cat,” said Harry’s traitorous tongue that seems to want no help or advice on what to say from Harry’s brain whatsoever.
“I do want to pass my NEWTs this year, Malfoy.”
The cat on the couch popped a curious eye open.
"Sorry, mate," Ron said, glaring at his sister a few seats down who happily ignored him. "Told her off, but older brother powers don't work when your sister's Ginny," he muttered.
But Lily didn’t burn in the open sun, didn’t have sharp teeth or night vision or healing powers, and even when she had been down with the flu, had never been that pale.
The picture confirmed everything and gave him a confidence boost that no amount of his and Harry's flirtatious jokes (and they had a lot, mostly courtesy of Draco) could ever give him.
But then Severus sighed, and his face relaxed just a tiny bit, as he started to collect the papers scattered on his desk and arrange them into a neat pile. "I had complete faith that you would see the Second Task through."
“Nonsense, Draco!” Pansy, who was sitting across from them, scoffed. She grinned at Harry. “Harry’s a Slytherin through and through. He might even suck all our blood by tomorrow.” She winked and Blaise beside her snickered.
More and more hooded figures appeared in the night, until there were about ten, twenty of them, all gathered around the Dark Lord, Harry still tied to the tombstone, and Cedric Diggory's body.
Harry knew full well how
Expectedly, all eyes were on them. After all, everyone was also very eager to find out just who stood in Harry Potter's heart. And, err, well, between Harry Potter and the ability of speech.
One horcrux already rendered Malfoy unconscious for a whole day.
Harry struggled against the rope, looking elsewhere – anywhere but Cedric's body – and searching for his wand. He found it on the ground, near his bent knees. Harry craned his neck backwards, and saw a black, hooded figure leaning over a stone cauldron that bubbled noisily. On the ground was a bundle of cloth, and it was where the smell was coming from, and it flooded the insides of Harry's nostrils and intensified the pain in his head even more.
It's a silver ring.
But now, with Draco’s disturbed expression, the Slytherin sense of self-preservation was winning.
But Potter was there, and his father and the Dark Lord weren't.
must see him," Severus said, sighing heavily. "Tell Kreacher to bring you to the Quidditch pitch at 10 o'clock tomorrow."
With a huff, the cat turned its head away from him and left the living room to climb up the stairs.
"In his room," Severus replied easily, already having expected the question. "He ate lunch ahead of us."
Harry was surprised. “
my mother talking my ears off!”
And it was in Lucius' hesitation and Narcissa's thinly-pressed lips that Draco realized. Why Draco was staying in that Unplottable place. Why they had to meet in Hogwarts and not in Malfoy Manor instead.
Does anyone even survive after fighting the Dark Lord? Potter did. They didn't really fight, but that was something, right? There was a chance…
At some point in the past minute, Malfoy had caught up to him and had clamped a hand around his arm. Harry shifted his gaze from the clearing, from the ratty tent that wasn’t there anymore, and instead forced himself to focus on Malfoy’s piercing, gray eyes.
The look of amazement was gone, replaced by a flat look. “Not when their boss gives them a rare week off. Some wizards go to the pub.”
That would be for the
Harry had almost forgotten just how mean Draco could look like.
A part of Harry thought that he should probably rejoice, because maybe this might mean that Draco was returning back to civilization and eating in the Great Hall again but a greater part of Harry knew that this was (in a small, minute way) wishful thinking.
Was Draco asking him out on a
Not an insulting laugh, a… free, easy laugh that seemed to light up his whole face.

Harry grappled for any form of sense in this conversation. "But you like Draco, don't you?"
what that whole thing earlier was about.
Then, he added, more softly. "I'll listen when you can properly speak."
Harry allowed himself another deep breath. He patted his front pocket, where a spoon quietly lay. “Yes.”
It’ll be nice, he supposes. They’re going to build the happiest family ever.
He blinked those memories away and turned his head. Potter was looking at him strangely, eyebrows knitted together with guilt.
"Definitely more," he breathed out.
Hermione smiles at him sympathetically. “I guess not.”
Draco pulled back with a satisfied smile. "Okay, good. By the way, good job not getting toasted, Potter. You should have seen the look of devastation on Zacharias Smith's face." And then he was off, disappearing back in the crowd to sit back with Pansy and Blaise. Harry told himself that he had no business feeling funny at the way Pansy threw her arms around Draco's waist and leaned her head on his shoulder.
“Ronald here –“ Seamus emphasized his words by giving Ron’s back a hearty clap. “—told me of your predicament.”
“And about the sucking my blood thing,” Draco continued, shrugging awkwardly. “I was just trying to make you laugh.”
to say it so he just sat there, sulking.
Harry barely survived that meeting and had come out of it with his glasses broken and his manly pride shredded to pieces.
, Harry thought, inhaling deeply and releasing it on a slow exhale to force his nerves to calm down.
Dumbledore was watching all this with an amused smile. “Then it’s rather convenient that his guardian is a teacher, is it not?”
Harry’s shoulders drooped. “So this is about Draco.”
“Okay, I’ll lay off.” She grins, eyes twinkling. “But could you maybe sit in on some practices? Beat some skills into our Seeker? He’s good, really good, but he just doesn’t have the same sense for the Snitch like you did.”
Harry grinned at him.
All of the Champions' eyes widened at the sight. Even Harry. While he had been prepared to act shocked as if he didn't know that the First Task included dragons, it turned out he didn't need to. It was still his first time seeing a dragon up close, even something that small, and it was…
Harry glared at him, frustration making his hands go cold. Anger getting the better of him, he reached across the table to grab Malfoy's arm, barely registering the way that the other's eyes grew wide with fear, and yanked his sleeve up.
Spending the summer in Grimmauld Place instead. Explaining to Severus that he wanted to spend the last few months before Hogwarts with Sirius and Remus, since he'd be with Severus during the whole school year anyway. Learning the corkscrew dive from Sirius. Tending to Remus on the days after the full moon. Improving his human drawings. Going to Hogsmeade. Riding the Hogwarts Express. Sharing a compartment with a boy named Ronald Weasley. Choosing Slytherin again. Meeting Draco Malfoy for the first time but avoiding his offers of friendship with projected indifference until he gave up. Not being friends with Draco Malfoy. Not being friends with Pansy Parkinson or Blaise Zabini or Crabbe or Goyle. Not counting Professor Quirrel's ticks. Not getting detention. Not going into the Forbidden Forest.
Severus replied, unfazed. "The lesser that know, the better."

Back in the summer, it had been breakfasts, and now it’s late night snacks.
“No, it wasn’t,” Harry agreed.

Harry had half a mind to cook the infernal feline for dinner.
There was another uncertainty, one that Harry still hadn’t voiced out loud, even with Ron and Hermione.
Harry immediately set to work just in case the man decided to change his mind.
And Draco was walking up to him, closing the distance between them in one, two strides and he was cupping Harry's face gently, his fingers smeared with blood, and Harry couldn't believe it.
That didn't mean he still wasn't worried though.
Draco sagged against his bed, suddenly remembering that he was actually very tired right now. "I still think he needs detention for this."
He was the only Death Eater in the Ministry. The only one they could—due to lack of better options, really—begrudgingly trust with this mission.
July 31
Nervously, he walked nearer and saw that Draco had a book open in front of him. He reckoned that the blond wasn't actually reading though. When he got closer, Draco's shoulders visibly tensed.
Harry was torn between hugging him and flipping him the bird.
(Potter also likes apple pie.)
As he walked through the corridors of Hogwarts, he realized that it was already night time. He cast a quick
She held out a hand in front of Harry, a smirk on her face. “Pansy Parkinson.”
"Alright, alright, come over, you little wormballs," Mad Eye Moody gruffed out, shuffling into the middle of the room with a small black bag at hand. "Get one."

Harry scrunches his eyebrows in confusion. “What I did?”
cat?”
A few feet away, Ron muttered sulkily to his girlfriend. "So you two've been planning this all along?"
Harry flushed and, as enticing as that thought was, glared at him. He then picked up the Self-Erasing Parchment and scribbled furiously on it.
get him to relay that information to Granger, who was really the one with the soundest mind amongst the three of them and no doubt shared Draco’s thoughts.
cat,” Draco said, stepping around him and walking away.
But he still didn't make Potter's life easier. Two hours and two very sweaty and grass-stained boys later, it was time for lunch.
He briefly considered punching Potter, but he thought that maybe that would hurt. His hand. He didn't care about Potter's face. But he realized that that was barbaric and maybe he should just have Potter cater to his every whim when the school year starts.
Despite his accusation, his voice held a tinge of proud respect in them.
"I get by with an Acceptable, thank you very much," Potter muttered in reply. "I'm fine. I have this belief that if there's anyone that can beat Voldemort, it will probably be Madame Pomfrey. Also, I heal very fast. It's another one of my
"– You'd still owe me and I can still blackmail you into doing whatever I see fit. It's a win-win situation."
As soon as they enter the compartment where Ron’s waiting for them, they collapse on the bench and immediately take off their Glamours. They sigh loudly as they sag on their seats.
Well,
Harry didn’t have the heart to tell him otherwise. He nodded with a smile.
Harry gave him a flat look.
Potter, you mean to tell me I almost got the Saviour of the Wizarding World ripped apart by wolves because he was stupid enough to come after an ex-Death Eater on a
Potter gave him a dry look. "Well, vampire and apparent Dark Wizard here. What have you got to offer?"
Harry did not answer, only stuffed his face with more of the sweets.
Draco raised an eyebrow, but an amused, mischievous smile made its way to his lips. "And you couldn't have done that in the beginning because…?"
"Yes.
Both of them turned towards the portrait at the end of the office, behind the Headmistress’ desk.
"A lot actually put their names in the Goblet," Theodore said. "Even the Weasel twins tried."
But in the end, everything was decided on that blemish of ink, that monstrosity of a skull and a serpent.
“Are you still seriously considering Nott?”
That was true. Harry wasn't really concerned about the danger of the Tournament on its own. He knew that the professors from all three schools have carefully put safety precautions in place for everyone. What he was more concerned about was who could have put his name in the Goblet of Fire and for what reason.
Harry mouthed, his frustration building even more when no sound came out.
Some areas are still blocked for repairs, with the promise that repairs are to be complete before Halloween.
“Livid… you say,” Draco commented with amusement. He could already imagine what’s gotten Saint Potter’s knickers in a twisted bunch.
“Stop.
Good. That meant that Potter at least went home.
"There's no reason for you to keep him like this anymore!" Ron exclaimed, exasperated.
Potter was avoiding him again.
One glance over his shoulder has him looking into Narcissa Malfoy's blank expression. She shakes her head, a minute tilt to the side, before returning her gaze to her son.
Harry usually avoided starting conversations with Draco, but he also usually avoided being alone with Draco, so this was… Well, this was uncomfortable.
The horcruxes were gone, all destroyed.
Draco did. "I remember being insulted that people thought
But just. Sleeping.
He knew that spot. That spot where he had lain. Where Narcissa Malfoy had saved his life.
Well, of course it would be strange, wouldn’t it? Your male workmate offering his bed to you. But Draco could use the excuse that he was medically incapacitated and Potter could use the excuse that he was dangerously sleep-deprived, and so Draco didn’t comment further and just raised an arm to block out the room’s yellow lights from his eyes.
Despite the whole ordeal ending with everyone safe and sound, others still believed that it was he who had given Ginny Weasley Riddle's diary. As a result, Harry had grown used to Howlers greeting him good morning every day at breakfast – so much so that Dumbledore had arranged for all Howlers addressed to Mr. Harry Potter be sent to Snape Manor instead, where they were promptly taken care of by Gritty the House Elf.
"Ah, look at the time!" Sirius exclaimed. "We must really go, Harry! Places to see, people to meet."
Snape’s breath held.

Ron’s things quickly righted themselves back into place.
When Severus emerged from the living room and looked at him, his expression pinched and unsure and
At the corner of his eye, Draco noticed Potter tucking away his book and watching them.
He’s trying to avoid himself most of all, because he’s spent nights alone in Grimmauld Place and those nights were long nights, stretching impossibly further, as dark as a forest (dark as death), as quiet as the afterlife (like white noise) (the afterlife’s not that peaceful after all), with each tick of the clock echoing through the walls and counting all the people that he lost.
Pansy's eyes widened, before she nodded fervently in understanding. "That's true. You'll have to ask him then."
And, with a sense of despair and defeat, Harry knew.
That was another aspect of Malfoy that he was starting to be uncomfortable with. Their suddenly growing friendship. Or maybe it wasn’t sudden. It did take a few years, after all, to get from enemies to reluctant acquaintances to respected colleagues to… friends.
Ginny shrugged. "Take a chance?"
Harry excuses himself, doesn’t want to impose by staying for dinner when he’s already stayed for lunch. By now, he already knows a lot more about Draco than Draco would probably be comfortable with if he knew. He also knows a lot more about Narcissa, and Lucius, and it’s disconcerting, to feel this new empathy for this family.
Harry itched to try the pencil now but he didn’t know what to draw. He was sure he didn’t want to copy Dudley’s drawings though.
He surprised himself by throwing his arms around Draco as well, laughing in relief. “Draco!”
Harry kept vigil by his bedside the whole time, worried, scared, and
Harry shrugged sheepishly and self-consciously.
"You're really admirable, Harry," Ginny said with a smile. "Now if you'd just direct that charm to certain blond wizards…"
Draco was considerably less irritable after that.
Potter’s hand is around his waist in an instant. “Merlin, Malfoy. You can ask for help, you know,” he mutters through gritted teeth.
Catcalls and hoots resounded from their friends and colleagues around the room. People from the kitchen, the second floor, and the terrace outside popped their heads inside the living room, expectant grins on their faces.
On cue, a House Elf popped up in the corner near the dresser. He looked gnarly and sour, and his nose was longer than Severus', which Draco didn't think was possible. As he saw them, his mood seemed to perk up considerably, eyes becoming round. "Young master Malfoy!" he exclaimed, breathless.
Ron stared at him incredulously.
Draco jumps in shock, and he turns his head—
Hartsman nodded again. “Exactly. That’s why I sent Gary to do the job.”

“Are you going to Ron and Hermione’s on Sunday?” he wheezed out in reply instead because
Three months in Azkaban. And he couldn’t do anything about it.
The embrace tightened. "
Harry could suddenly move again.
"I am not moping!" Draco said through a mouthful of tart. Then, he remembered his manners. He wiped his mouth with the back of a finger with a huff. "Anyway, is your head okay? Severus might think it's my fault if you get a Dreadful in Potions next year."
“I don’t want you to destroy it. Ah, I mean. I don’t want
He wants to kiss Potter’s neck.
Draco's head snapped up in surprise and they stared at each other's eyes for a while, with Harry silently begging him to try to understand what he was about to say. Harry desperately wanted his Parchment right now.
The cat didn't even crack open an eye as he did so.
The Manor is beautiful in the morning, with its pristine white walls and marble floors. Sunlight filters through the halls and the air is fresh and crisp. Harry definitely believes that there is some magic in the works here
A flash of hurt lances through him with that. “I didn’t mean that.”
, he wrote.
Potter was on the other side of the door, had been for the past ten days, emptying his stomach again and again, even while Draco had been enjoying his treacle tart at lunch.
The lock clicked and the door opened just a crack – just wide enough for Draco to peer through with one eye narrowed accusingly at Harry. “That’s unfair,” he mumbled out.
Harry's face slowly coloured. He was touched that Snape would go out of his way to do this for him, as well as ashamed at how childish he was acting. He never did outgrow his fear of being a bother to other people, even Snape, Remus, and Sirius had all done their bests – in their own little ways – to convince him that he was anything but.
“Occasions?” Harry asks, thinking of the many fancy invitations that he’s thrown in the trash in the past three months. “You mean parties?”
The winter break afforded them the chance to eat at the Great Hall without the presence of gawking children.
Malfoy tore his eyes away to look back at him and give him a wry smile. “I’m not sure. I don’t miss the me that had been with him.”
"I was still right," Theodore muttered back.
Still, he reminded himself.
Sitting next to Draco in his usual seat again, Harry took away the Invisibility Cloak and reveled in Draco's wide-eyed, slack jawed expression. When Draco turned that expression to him, Harry could only shrug self-consciously.
Worst of all, adding to his budding irritation, he can’t even go near Draco anymore without being blocked by a doting fan, though, Harry thinks, this is probably a good thing. Draco never really retracted what he had said back in the Hogwarts Express, and his words have done a good job in convincing Harry to grit his teeth and ignore the urge to actively seek out blond hair and pale skin.
He was wrong, then.
Draco stretched his legs. “Hmm, yes, that

Hermione was already waiting for him (like she always was), but Draco was still in his dorm, probably styling his hair (like he always was).  Harry and Hermione waited for him, though, like good friends, and not 10 minutes later, he was out of his room, a little breathless, like he fought someone for mirror rights (he had).  Anthony, his roommate, was just as vain as he was, and they constantly battled for the vanity.  It was a strange situation, but they had lived together for seven years, so they made it work and refused to switch rooms or add another mirror.
The table exchanged looks.  This level of interest did not bode well at all for Harry.  While people respected the Minister, and he ruled with fairness, he was an obsessive, powerful man; you did not say no to him.
Professor Flitwick just raised an eyebrow and said, “Knowing your opponent is a part of dueling.  Now, do you need to go to the Hospital Wing?”
This fic has taken me so far, and if you can see the beginning versus this most recent chapter, I think you can see the improvement.  I spend quite some time on this fic, and it really makes me proud (and not just because it's my first foray into world-building and it's my longest fic).

Then it was his turn, and he ambled over to Professor Black. He smelled the potion and told the class that he smelled, “Green apples, dark chocolate, masala chai, ink, and vomit.”
The minister, on the other hand, was an oppressive, and depressive force in the castle.  As the days counted down to Samhain, his presence lessened, though, which Harry thanked all the powers above for.  Harry really had to focus on midterms (specifically in Transfiguration, Alchemy, and Arithmancy).  He also focused on self-studying for Runes and Magical Theory which were both incredibly beneficial classes to take, and NEWTS to have if one wanted to be an Unspeakable like Harry.

Without further ado, onto the chapter!

Harry let out a dramatic gasp followed along with smothered giggles, "A f-field mouse?! I know where you sleep, don't forget that."
Harry snarled, “I don’t see how that is any of your business,” putting emphasis on each word, enunciating crisply, anger sharp and cutting.
Harry huffed and said, “Exactly, I was only a little third year.  I could barely cast

And then backward, “
Professor Flitwick then summoned all the essays with a flick of his wand and banished the chairs and desks in another, leaving an empty classroom perfect for dueling.
Harry just stood up, put his hands on his desk, and hissed, long and slow. Well, he actually spoke parseltongue, if the Minister angrily hissing back was any sort of indication.
If he had taken a step back and taken a breath, he would have realized he was acting irrationally; he didn’t even know the boy.  It was quite strange to be so entranced by this little twig of a 17-year-old after knowing of him for barely a day, even if Harry was very powerful.  But the Minister was not one for introspection, so he continued to rage and rant, uncaring of the frightened students in their classrooms, feeling the very foundation of the castle shake.  Nor did he care about the hysterical boy in the infirmary, his equally terrified friends trying to calm him down.

Merlin, Harry felt dumb.
After the last dessert had been consumed, they all stood up at James’ command and walked out, robes billowing, all carrying the tray of offerings.  They walked to the roaring bonfire set up by the house-elves, and the sacrifice started.  James gently tossed a slice of sourdough bread smeared with strawberry jam into the fire, and as the bread charred, they all chanted, “Accipit munera nostra Domina Magicae,” three times.  Samhain had begun in earnest.
A person next to him huffed, and he whirled around to see his second favorite person in the whole wide world (the first was Hermione) Draco!  He was dressed in his black robes, blue and bronze accents striking against his pale coloring.  And hadn’t his sorting been a surprise.  It fit, though, and after several violent incidents in their first year, Draco had inserted himself into the fast-formed friendship Harry and Hermione had.
His two friends nodded their agreement, the conversation coming to a close as they arrived at Hogwarts.  The view never ceased to amazed Harry, even after all these years.  He let his magic stretch out, expanding and contorting in the air as they made their way inside towards the Ravenclaw table.  It was very rare that he could do this, but Professor Flitwick, his Head of House, theorized that it was because he was so powerful and so small.  He didn’t take offense at that, even though he very well could have.  It was well known to those close to him that he was malnourished as a child and would likely never grow taller than his current 5’7”.  Harry didn’t mind overly about his height, though; he was the perfect height for Draco to put his chin on his head and the ideal size for a cuddle with Hermione.
The Minister smiled slowly and dangerously before speaking, “I would like to duel with whoever wins this one; you both are very impressive.”
In a swirl of color and a last breath of air, Harry and his family were transported to Moonlight Plaza, the largest plaza in Wixen UK, where all annual rites were performed.
James continued for quite some time, ignoring how everyone was quite uncomfortable with how he talked about Lily.  It was this strange sort of immortalization and worship that didn’t align with how any real person should be treated.  He idolized her and placed her on an untouchable pedestal after her death, and it was near impossible to deal with.  No one wanted to speak ill of the dead, but Lily was by no means a perfect person.
“And your robe is ill-fitting.”
Harry jumped up and ran over into Tom, sending them both sprawling.
The girl looked a little lost before hesitantly responding, “Because it’s a Dark Spell?”
“Hey,” Harry whispered back, far hoarser than he intended.  He cleared his throat and repeated himself, this time clearer.
Hermione was the first to cast, and, thoughts filled with her two best friends, she cast, “
“Don’t thank me; it shouldn’t have happened in the first place.”  Professor Flitwick noted absentmindedly while writing the note.
It was all anyone could talk about for weeks to come, and Harry quickly informed Tom, who was quite morbidly impressed and enraged.  Aurors had flooded Hogwarts, and the students, and the teachers, were all in a muted frenzy.  By the time Harry had classes again, and the weekend was over, he had heard thousands of theories, had been questioned by dozens of Aurors, and was truly disappointed.  These students had decided to throw away their futures in exchange for what, money?  The thrill?  The Greengrass name had been dragged through the mud -- it was worth less than a first-generation mundane-born.  They were all looking at prison sentences, and that would likely mar their record for the rest of their lives.  The rewards were meaningless when those five students began to face the consequences of their actions.
They adjusted their wand grip.
Harry quickly summoned his DADA notes and fled down the hallway before the Minister noticed him, mind whirling, thoughts reeling.  When he entered the Great Hall and joined his friends, though, he cleared his mind and moved his attention to the bouncing conversation about the usefulness of spatial transfiguration in duels.
“Right!” Professor Black started, “Now after we went over the safety procedures on Tuesday, it’s time to start on our first project of the term. Ms. Brown, what can you tell me about Amarenovis?”
Harry disregarded that line of thought in favor of bringing forth the next memory: the Minister’s
A Gryffindor, Sophie Roper, raised her hand confidently. Professor Black nodded at her, and she came forward to sniff at a vial. She said, “I smell salted caramel, limes, and dung bombs.”

changing the ground underneath Harry to a slippery sheet of ice.  He tripped and quickly banished the ice, but it was enough for Susan to recover, and he lost his advantage.
Thank you so much for reading and have an amazing day!!
The Minister didn’t seem like he had caught on to Harry’s acting, and he was getting overconfident.  Harry inwardly smirked as the Minister started casting slower, using less impressive spells, and abandoned his shield.  After the Minister cast one last spell, Harry felt that he had learned enough and shifted onto offense.  He conjured a sand storm, and in the time it took the Minister to banish it, Harry was already shooting off spell after spell.  The Minister seemed shocked at Harry’s viciousness and attempted to gain ground.  He growled and tried to intimidate Harry by shooting off lethal spells, but Harry wasn’t fazed.
His waxing on of Lily was cut short when the group stood at the dining room entrance, and the dining ritual began. First, James entered as the host, and then Harry followed as the heir. Cousin Rhodesia, as the last blood-relative, entered the room, and Sirius and finally Remus trailed in.  They stood at their seats, and a ring of magic, they all sat down.  First, a simple soup was served; butternut squash -- Lily’s favorite.  Then followed course after course of small meals, legumes, meats, grains, berries, squashes, and dairies made appearances, and with each one, the best part was set aside onto a massive golden platter in the center of the table.
The minister watched the room with unfathomable dark eyes throughout the whole feast, purveying all the 6th and 7th years.  Promising candidates, all of them, but especially that one male Ravenclaw with messy black hair.  He was familiar, somehow.  Harry, of course, didn’t notice the eyes watching him like a hawk (Draco was not oblivious and was very worried about how interested the Dark Lord was in Harry).
Content warning for verbal/emotional abuse, James Potter bashing, and the general icky feelings of going home to an abusive parent to mourn your other parent who is dead. It isn't explicit or anything though.
These types of debates were not just common; they were expected.  Ravenclaws were constantly debating, educating themselves and others, and looking at things from new angles.  It didn’t matter what everyone’s actual opinions were. You just debated whatever you felt like and tried to win.  Despite the even number of students in their year, there was always a moderator to keep things from getting too heated.  (This was a rule imposed since Rowena’s time to stop students from hexing each other to get their points across).
nebula nebulosus - a charm that creates an impenetrable fog
And they were off.
Overall, the whole day passed far too quickly, in Harry’s opinion, and before he knew it, he had finished all his homework and was eating dinner with his friends.  There was a damper on the mood after Anthony, Marietta, and Helen got back from Care and gave hushed summaries of the Minister’s odd behavior.  Apparently, he sat in the very back, shrouded in unnatural shadows, which were even more peculiar given that it was a practical lesson with the thestrals.  Professor Romulus had taken it in stride, though, and was respectful and informative, like usual, if a little more cautious.
Finally, the sorting was over, and the Headmaster began to speak.  He had the same speech every year, so Harry tuned it out.  Instead, he took note of all the new students: Tallulah Cole, Bishop Corner, and Poppy Lake he knew from their older siblings, but he didn’t know the other 12.  15 students in total.  It wasn’t the smallest year, but it certainly wasn’t like Hufflepuff's year with 34 children.
But even so, at night, with a sense of guilt gleefully lounging in his stomach, he can’t help but return to old habits:
But there was no one inside the castle now, with everybody having gone home for summer.
If Draco minded, he didn’t show it.
Sirius waved offhandedly. "Moony and I were actually really popular in our day," he said, thinking it might be unwise to drop Arthur Weasley and Charlie Weasley's names in the conversation after they had kindly helped them help Harry cheat. Friendship was a beautiful thing.
The flowers, he might, because they were so pretty and had very distinguishable features, unlike the ferns, which didn’t look very different to Harry at all.
That thing about the Philosopher's Stone in his first year had been mental. Dumbledore and Severus had disposed of the Stone easily before Quirrel could get his hands on it, but there were still some people who believed that Harry was the one who let Voldemort inside the castle. (Who would have thought that the reason why Quirrel's turban moved a lot was because Voldemort kept on scrunching his nose up? Ha ha ha.) And the whole Chamber of Secrets thing! Up until now, Harry still had trouble convincing some of the Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs that he was
With the weight of those words, Harry decided to call it a day.
"Yes," Harry said, breathless and flushed as well. "Yes, it was okay. Amazing."
And Stinging Hexes, on the other hand, were still as painful as Draco remembered them to be.
"Can't really trust the memory of someone who just suffered a concussion," Draco muttered, biting off a big piece from his tart. "I just Levitated you. Almost gave me a fucking heart attack."
But he was
Harry appreciated its efforts though.
And there was something in the way that Potter’s eyes widened, in the way that Potter was looking at him so unguardedly that made Draco hold his breath.
Harry had frozen in place, five books weighing heavily in his arms as he
“Ohh, look at this! It’s an amaryllis. It’s really beautiful, don’t you think?”
“Potter, are you going to help me up or not? It’s rather discomfiting to be this close to your crotch.”
The dragon grumbled lowly, and smoke started coming out of her nostrils. Harry realized, with a growing dread, that she was getting ready to blow another stream of fire. Harry ducked down and kept himself firmly stuck to the boulder as flames erupted all around it.
"I always did live to torment you," Draco quipped.
“You don’t belong here,” Draco replies, rolling his eyes. “You’re too nice. We have a reputation to uphold.”
Harry cringed. “Is this about Draco?”
Harry nodded back nervously.
"I'm not hungry," he replied easily.
Harry really had no problems with all the hugging – really. But compared to Hermione, Ginny was jumping up and down while hugging him and it was actually kind of painful at being squished so tightly like that.
“Do not use that tone –“
Then, as if realizing what he had just done, Potter quickly let go of him and flushed red. He mumbled an apology, before coughing. "Err – I've been sneaking in Severus' room at night with the Invisibility Cloak. He leaves the Daily Prophet on his desk. I think he Apparates somewhere before breakfast every morning to get it."
It was the last thing his father told him, before September 1st rolled in, and the school year was to start again.
“Pair up to work on gravitational charms,” Professor Flitwick said to the whole class, voice amplified by a
and, noticing the time, thanked Professor Black and went to tell Maisy that it was her turn, leaving a stunned Minister behind.
After, the rites would then begin.  It would follow much the same as the familial rites, but more generalized and entirely in Latin.  Harry was quite glad he was competent enough in Latin (like all wixen as they were required to take a Latin class first through the third year no matter the school they attended) to call and respond, for he didn't know the phrases intimately, like many others.  There would be buckets of live coals and ashes, marigolds and carnations, and a raucous celebration composed of dancing and music where they danced through the bonfire, cooling charms on their lower halves.  The more Harry thought about it, the more excited he got (it also helped the longer he was up, the less tired he was).
Harry tuned out the sorting, clapping when he was supposed to until the next name he was looking for was called.
He looked stunning, to be sure, but there was an undercurrent of misery Harry tried his best to wipe away, to no avail.  Oh, that wouldn't do.  He closed his eyes tightly and breathed in and out to counts of three.  Harry peeked out and smiled, satisfied.  Now that was someone who looked happy -- it wouldn’t be seemly to be seen as anything else.
(See the end of the chapter for

“Yes, Father.  I am quite excited to perform a rite with her.”
The last touch he had to make was putting on his stag mask, but it would obscure his vision just enough to be annoying, so Harry withheld from fixing it onto his head, instead, staring at his reflection.
The Minister just smirked as Harry began to spiral.  He
O-okay, that was weird.  Harry decided to ignore the usually composed man who was currently angrily stabbing his eggs and sausages with a dark sort of glee--what had gotten the man so worked up that he was like this?  Harry was not the only one to have noticed; he should be worried about his public image.  People were sure to write home about that.  Oh, and whatever last night was.  That reminded him that he had to write to Uncle Moony and Uncle Sirius.  Harry made a mental note of that and started listening to Luna explaining what heliopaths are to Cho, in a very roundabout and musical way that annoyed the straightforward and no-nonsense Cho.  He snorted and joined Luna’s side, lightheartedly teasing Cho.
Professor Flitwick nodded and conjured a cup and cast
tumus bene - a decontaminating cleaning charm.
The Potter house-elves are Poppy (the chef), Billa (the handmaiden), Acorn (the stablehand), and Mopsy (the seamstress).
The next step was far easier: setting up the white candles. Harry cast extremely overpowered sticking charms, so the magic spilled over, tacky and gummy like glue paste, and set the candles at the vertices.
‘-it is being so wonderful to finally make rite masks-”
Harry let out a gasp as a fully corporeal
Harry ignored that, though, in favor of listening to Marietta spin a wild tale about her eldest sister’s latest suitor.  He laughed, and joked, and gorged himself on delicious food, happy to be at Hogwarts and away from James, even if it meant that he couldn’t see Uncle Sirius and Uncle Moony.
You couldn’t apply to it. Instead, you had to be scouted at graduation, get one mastery and four years of experience or two masteries, and then go through the cryptic application process. Harry had only known two other people who had been scouted as Unspeakables, and he was determined to be the third. That’s why it was so important to do so well at the Novo Novus Showcase (especially given his status as the child of a war criminal).
"Oh, Sweet Circe, I forgot too. Why’s he coming again?"
Harry spent a little more time on the DADA memory, cataloging information about the
Harry explained what had happened, going into near excruciating detail about the duel. Still, he knew his Ravenclaws wouldn’t be satisfied with a run-down, so he continued to go over spell after spell, minute by minute, till he finished.  They all looked stunned and started fussing over him.
Harry sighed and sat back up, shucking off his blankets - it looked like he would have to file everything manually, so that’s what he did.  He went through memory after memory, cataloging, filing, and shelving each piece of information.  Harry wove his emotions of the day (icy, cold, blue fear, maroon shame, chestnut brown fondness, lime green satisfaction) into the tapestry, and took a step back, really looking at his emotions.  It was a marvelous piece of fabric, stretching eons, rippling with magic, the loom moving by itself, weaving spools of thousands of different colors.  Blues, purples, reds, and greens overtook the tapestry with threads of rose gold love and deep, charcoal black hatred forming geometric patterns throughout.
“That’s a weighty accusation,” Cousin Rhodesia said, “I would have to report you, if that were the case.”
[18 g] Purpura Brassica, Crushed
James’ silence was answer enough.
Truth be told, Harry was incredibly excited, but at his father’s sour expression and clenched jaw, he just muttered, “More or less,” but at Cousin Rhodesia’s raised eyebrow, he repeated himself, enunciating clearly, and making sure to speak at an appropriate volume.  She nodded, having anticipated his answer, but a soft sadness in her eyes knew he wasn’t expressing the full range of his emotions -- he never did, back at home.
"You can't talk, pipsqueak."
The man looked just as he always did: entirely put together, save for his thumb-print eye-bags, and the stale smell of fire-whiskey that perfumed his being.
Also, this chapter was hardddd to not make into tomarry T-T so I just based it on seeing my best friend after a very long time (I've never been far away from my brother for very long).  I hope it doesn't come off as too shippy.
“Hey, Healer Malfoy!” Harry heckled, “My throat’s swollen, wanna kiss it better?”
They exchanged charm after charm, sweat dripping down their foreheads, lungs pumping.  They circled each other and resorted to physical dodges and evasions.  Harry ran circles around Susan, but she caught on quickly and learned to predict where he would go.  After a few close calls, he went back to standing in place.  Flashes of every color under the sun went off, and reinforced shields were repeatedly dismissed and recalled.  The class waited with bated breath for who would win.
“Father.”
It wouldn’t do to contaminate the ceremony robes for this evening, so he dressed in soft pants and an overrobe for brunch.  Cousin Rhodesia and Father were already seated and responded to his late rising with a “Good morning Harry,” and a “You’re late,” respectively.  He just smiled apologetically and settled down to eat breakfast in response.
His episode wasn’t helped in the least by Uncle Sirius’ release who, after several coffee ‘dates’ with Uncle Moony and Harry, had rebuilt some sort of relationship and was incensed to find out how James ‘raised’ Harry.  He wasn’t even mollified by Uncle Moony telling him he’d taken over after Harry turned eight and he was released from his house arrest; apparently, child abuse was totally inexcusable, and for it to happen to his pup?  Unforgivable.  He almost killed James with his bare hands after hearing about the neglect and physical abuse Harry had gone through and was only stopped by a pleading Harry, who had grown quite fond of his godfather and didn’t want to see him back in Azkaban.
Harry brushed his hair and teeth, put on his school uniform, tied his tie, and meditated for 30 minutes before putting on his socks and shoes. Ever since he had gotten competent in occluding some odd four years ago, he had stopped meditating every morning, but now that he had to rebuild them, it looked like he was going to pick up the habit again.
“Barely.” Cousin Rhodesia sneered before continuing, “I only have emotional connections with Harry, you and I are merely family members out of coincidence.  Nothing more.  If you aren’t paying your house-elves I will report you to an auror.”
The Samhain ritual I did was a mesh of tons of different celebrations/ceremonies (including but not limited to ancient Celtic Samhain rites, Día de los Muertos, and All Saints Day/All Souls Day), so it's not accurate to anything real and hopefully feels like an actual ceremony a culture completely split off from the rest of the world would have.
This chapter is a little shorter than usual, but I wanted to be mean and leave on a sort-of-cliffhanger so :)))
C/W: vague references to panic attacks and past non/con, and talk of teen pregnancy in a gossipy sort of way.
Soon enough, lunch was over and Harry, shielded by his friends who had Transfiguration with him (Terry, Sue, Helen, and Ophelia).  He had never been so grateful for the Head of House for Gryffindor, Professor McGonagall, as he was in the class period.  Her no-nonsense way of teaching made it so that Harry wasn’t bothered the whole time.  They were currently doing self-transfiguration, so everyone needed to focus.  It also helped that even the Minister was afraid of her, so he didn’t bother coming into her classroom.
When Harry returned to his body, he stared listlessly at the diary in his hands, thoughts whirling around, emotions a tangled, knotted mess.  He noticed that Tom had written something, but he couldn’t focus his eyes on the words.  Harry inhaled sharply and then read what Tom had written.
Sacrificium pro te mihi - My sacrifice for you
with twittering songbirds that Harry banished.  They traded back spell after spell, circling each other, but mindful of their surroundings, as good duelists ought to do.
.  He had 30 minutes to get to the Great Hall, so he reluctantly left his cocoon of blankets and got ready for the day.
Finally, the class period ended, and Harry rushed back to his dorm, flanked by Helen and Ophelia (Terry and Sue went off to the library).  Making some haphazard excuse about wanting alone time, he rushed into his dorm, threw his shoes off, and quickly summoned a quill.
(See the end of the chapter for
He was jerked out of his thoughts by Hermione exclaiming, "Merlin, Harry, I forgot that the Minister was coming to this feast.  I just remembered cause I heard Greengrass and Parkinson talking about it.”
Harry’s Blood - Sacrifice
just ran out, he stirred three times, clockwise.  Then, one by one, he dropped the rest of the dragon fruit gnats into the potion every three seconds, stirring 1 time in between counterclockwise.
“Mother Magic and Morgana Harry, you have no idea how terrified we were when Padma, Cho, and Susan told us what happened in Charms,”  Hermione said, her hands cupping Harry’s face.
I made some edits to the Black family lore (as well as other things, I've been going back and editing stuff -- mostly grammar and readability, so you aren't missing anything) and made it a matriarchy, so Andromeda, as the eldest daughter, is the Black heir, and her 'daughter' (I headcanon Tonks as genderfluid, and so they will be in this fic) Tonks would be the next in line.
Susan’s brow furrowed, and she double-layered her shield and quickly sent the spells back to Harry.  Instead of casting a shield, he dodged the charms and encased them with a
Harry let out a sigh of relief at the correctness and perfect timing because an embarrassed Chandan Moreau (a Slytherin who Harry had hooked up with at the end of last year, though Chandan was probably more embarrassed about the Amortentia incident than Harry’s blow job) was waiting for him.  Harry smiled gratefully at Chandan and walked over to the room, feeling like he was walking to his execution.
Harry was glad he could start the magical cycle for the first time and was looking forward to celebrating Ostara and Imbolc with his peers, especially.  He and other children of war criminals had been barred from all non-ancestral calendar rites, so Harry had never liked to think of the mid-September day where all his classmates were gone (with the exception of Neville Longbottom and few others) to celebrate Mabon, among others.  Mabon was actually the hardest because the Potter family didn’t observe it ancestrally, so it was just a glaring date Harry did his best to ignore.
Throughout this convoluted tale, Minister Peverell listened with an eerie intrigue.  The more Headmaster Snape spoke, the more he worried about Harry. This level of interest did not bode well.  Eventually, the Minister thanked him and left via floo, leaving a very concerned Headmaster Snape behind with quite a lot of equally concerned portraits.  Of course, Harry didn’t know any of this because he was peacefully asleep in his bed.
If this keeps up, they were going to have a long night. "Malfoy, leave the scrubbing to me and just do the inventory, would you?"
Remus rolled his eyes at their antics. He reached out and patted the boy’s head. “We had a really great time too, Harry,” he said, grinning. Then, he winked as well. “Now, you must be really tired. I suggest you go
At night.
"No, Harry," Remus said with the patience only Remus could have. "They're not Jigsnargles."
And he’s too tired to even summon the energy to look for his wand.
The figure paid him no mind.
” Potter irritably cuts off, probably because if they continue talking about this, they are going to have another argument. “That’s how I found you.”
He saw Theodore waving wildly at him from the Slytherin stands. He was yelling things that was drowned out by everyone else yelling. Harry grinned weakly at him. Beside Theodore was Pansy and Blaise, but Draco was nowhere to be found. Perhaps he went to the loo?
They were crossing the Stone Bridge now, heading for the Transfiguration Courtyard.
that smile.
"Harry Potter."
It was on the early morning of the 16th that Errol crashed into his window rather spectacularly.
"You're also not athletic enough or smart enough."
He went to bed happy that night.
Harry shrugged unrepentantly.
Draco shot him an amused look.
From now on, Harry was going to refer to that holy, all-mighty, well-revered Goblet of Fire as that stupid cup.
For the past six years, Sirius had plenty of time to imagine what life with the Muggles was like for his godson. He had imagined… no, he had
blood."
“To leave you alone.”
Harry sighed. “Draco, if you don’t open this door, I’ll call Severus to open it for me.”
Harry raised an eyebrow at him.
He hurriedly moved backwards as Madame Pomfrey closed the door to her room.
"I agree," Severus said flatly. Draco was almost amused. Severus complaining about his charge.
pass ingredients, too. And ask about Potter’s homework. And gripe about McGonagall.
“Do you?”
Harry nodded and forgot how to speak because Draco had inched closer to him so that even their arms pressed together.
Draco colored, unused to being praised like that. He was used to being praised for his grades, flying skills, even his charm, but not for his character. He knew he had a horrible personality. This made him feel awkward.
The ink disappears in a heartbeat and the paper folds itself once more. Potter pockets it together with his wand.  He crosses the room to get the Invisibility Cloak on Goyle’s bed, and then pauses. He turns to look at Draco. His eyebrows are creased with worry. “You okay, Malfoy?”
Draco wasn't sure whether to be grateful for that.
"—don't have the Dark Mark to brandish around anymore, do you? Still haven't learned your lesson yet, eh, Malfoy?"
That was a very probable reality, wasn’t it?
Ron and Hermione stayed dutifully quiet as he dashed back out.
When the last of the glass shards had fallen, and all that was left was the broken glass on the floor and the darkness of the hall, Harry felt like his throat had clogged up.
Seamus eyed him appreciatively. “What they say about gay men and aprons are true,” he said with a grin before Harry could begin defending himself.
but since when was his father civil with Professor Dumbledore?
"I…" Harry started guiltily, before a brilliant idea popped in his head. "I was just thinking that your hair looks better. The curls match your heart-shaped face more."
,” Ron let out in a rush, eyeing Draco Malfoy who was by the punch table, eyeing the alcohol present with narrowed eyes. Ron knew better though. Draco had been looking at the clock at least five times per minute, a sure sign that he was waiting for Harry. Ron continued. “And when he does, jump in, flirt with Harry, and save the day,
taking a lot of self-control not to turn in his seat right now. There’s an ache in his heart, but he’s used to that, so he stubbornly ignores it. “Well, it’s not any of my business, is it?”
Nearing Severus' office, Harry felt an already familiar wave of appreciation for the man. Severus wasn't sweet –
Granger had apologetically said.
Severus, for the first time that night, averted his gaze. "What, indeed."
Ron and Hermione were still sitting on the bed, having a Deep Conversation when he entered but Harry simply ran past them, grabbed his Self-Erasing Parchment, his Self-Inking Quill, and the Marauders' Map from his trunk.
, and they look pretty terrible."
Harry thought about telling her that Greengrass has not been in any way or form eyeing him, but Theodore idly commented, "Astoria's been really invested in you since the First Task."
That was pretty much how the evening went. Draco was his usual snarky self and Harry was his usual lovesick, hallucinatory self – only worse, because everything that Draco did or said now sounded flirtatious in Harry’s ears, supplemented by his newfound knowledge of the contents of Draco’s top drawer.
You’re being difficult on purpose, aren’t you?”
“That’s asphodel, not a lily, although asphodel’s part of the lily family too,” Draco was explaining three days into his stay as they crouched over a small portion of Snape Manor’s garden that held a variety of flowering plants.
The nightmares got better and less troublesome, but they didn't really go away. It was hard to feel assured when you weren't allowed to Owl or Floo-call your mother and father. Severus assured him that they were fine and that they were in constant correspondence with each other, which just irritated Draco all the more, because if Severus could talk to them, then why couldn't he?
Harry wrote on the Parchment slowly an hour later, as if he really didn't want to write it at all.
"Oh, God, Harry, don't…
—after he was given the Mark, his mission, and that soul-gripping fear of what the Dark Lord might do to his family should he fail. And he recalls thinking then, that the world isn’t such a bad one to wake up to, if he woke up to banana pancakes and bright, green eyes.
The very Malfoy retort actually startled a laugh from Harry and eased his nerves somewhat. Okay. Okay, they can do this. They’ve spent
Draco's smirk.
But it was only three months into Harry’s stay that he realized just how much.
“How long did I sleep?” he asked, his voice gruff from the rest.
They’re old recipes, hailing from his Aunt Petunia, with advice from Molly, and tweaked to his own taste. He doesn’t cook that much anymore, but it’s an old skill from childhood and one that you don’t really forget. Also, it reminds him of his days in Privet Drive, memories that he really doesn’t care to recall, but he’s getting better. After all, since his relationship with Draco began, he’s started to associate cooking with different memories.
Draco shrugged again unrepentantly.
Draco closed his eyes shut and held out his arm. "Just get it!"
Draco swallowed it without preamble. Even without Severus telling him what it was, he trusted and revered Severus enough as a Potioneer that he would drink whatever the man gave him.
To horror.
When he and Harry parted ways, he to Arithmancy and Harry with his friends to Transfiguration, Draco realized three things:
Another awkward silence enveloped them after that and Harry had no idea how to break the ice this time. Asking about the weather was already pretty lame, more so when you're rendered mute. And Draco had this disposition that seemed like he didn't want to talk anymore. Harry scuffed his shoes against the floor, feeling very self-conscious, and they stayed that way until Madame Pomfrey returned, fussing over the both of them and all but forcing them to drink more questionable liquids.
He takes Harry’s silence as a yes. He sighs, stares at the floor. “Man, I still don’t like him, but. I can’t say I’m happy about what happened to him.”
Draco wakes up to the scent of sweat, treacle tart, and fresh soap. He’s being carried on someone’s back, and he knows immediately who it is. His nose is buried in Potter’s hair and he’s not sure if
Draco gave a hollow laugh at the irony. “So I
But it's okay if he wasn't listening; Snape had been a great mentor to him after all.
It’s true then.
And Harry, in his own grief, had simply replied, “I know.”
Harry raised an eyebrow, then rolled his eyes. "Diggory was
He’s not supposed to
But Narcissa’s looking at him in a way that’s soft, and pitying, as if she understands. Harry has to look away from that.
alright?”
He had planned on showering him with all kinds of toys, taking him for daredevil broomstick rides around London behind his parents’ backs, and teaching him how to be a mean Chaser. He had dreamed of the child as a toddler, chubby and goofy smiles, to squeal in joy whenever Sirius would transform into a dog and back.
And it seemed that Potter had pretty much thrown all caution into the wind and made himself comfortable, sleeping peacefully beside him.
“Don’t you have enough pancakes with those weasels? I’m sure the Weaslette would love to fall all over your feet and hand feed you.”
Perplexed at the sudden change in Myrtle’s tone, Harry whipped his head to look back at him in disbelief.
“You do know that… you can quit, you know?”
On the night that November ends, Harry is lounging on his—it hasn’t been
Snape had asked then, in the middle of breakfast, in a stiff voice. “How old are you, Po –
Sirius gave him a dry look. "Jigsnargles are worms with twenty hairy legs and a voice box. What's beautiful about them?"
He wanted to live.
It has been three months since they last saw her, and it’s like something’s missing when she’s not here. They both want to see her, but Harry knows that Ron wants that in a way that’s different.
He and Ginny had come to an understanding that they weren’t ready for a relationship, with both of them still mourning all they’ve lost. Ron and Hermione had bravely taken on the challenge, and Harry had been cautious at first, thinking that it was one more thing that had to change. But at the end of the day, he loves his friends, is immensely proud of them and their relationship, and—lately—have been thinking that maybe it won’t be so different between all of them after all.
Myrtle appeased, Harry and Malfoy jumped down the long, winding slide that led deep to the undergrounds of Hogwarts.
Potter, of course, didn’t appreciate his authority on the case being thwarted by… well, all three of them.
“Yeah, well, you wouldn’t have needed to heal if it weren’t because of me,” Draco muttered against the top of his knees. He cringed again. “So I guess I’m… sor… err…”
Numbly, Draco recalled his father standing over him, shooting spell after spell, actually fighting fucking
“So who wants te go with Fluffy?”
Harry's face remained dreadfully pale.
Voldemort stopped him with a raise of his hand. "Oh, consider me appeased. Very much appeased. It is my first day in this new body, and I have not had a drink in such a long time."
He braces himself, readies himself to stand up and run should a fork come for his head, but Draco just snorts and looks at him pointedly. “Weasel’s going to have an aneurysm from laughing too much if he finds out that you’re feeding me breakfast.”
Hermione's responding smile was bright.
Harry outstretched his arms in front of him. “It’s fine,” he said, shrugging. “I’m fine. I heal very fast. It’s another one of my
Draco relaxes back in his seat once he sees that it’s just Harry. He frowns at the question. “I tripped.”

to be and Ron was pretty much announcing to the world that he was incapable of discretion. Draco really had gotten so thin since the school year started. Well, the boy was already thin enough to begin with, and Harry didn't really expect anything less because of the war and Lucius being sent to Azkaban for life and Narcissa and Draco being held on probation.
Ron looked at him incredulously. "No, YOU'REmad! And – and –" He paused, and Harry actually saw how his emotions transformed from disbelief to a reluctant realization to utter defeat. "And I know how it feels. S'not like you can help your fee –" Ron's nose scrunched up in disgust. He tried again. "
With another sigh, Severus turned to leave. "As I've said, he's… detained. You may fulfill your violent urges in a few more days. Until then, don't give Pomfrey any trouble."
Harry started at the sudden invasion of personal space but otherwise didn’t move back. He was confused by the fact that the boy knew him and that he was a vampire, but reckoned that Severus must have told him.
"Now, on the issue of your detention with Mr. Draco Malfoy for stealing from my ingredients…"
"You're
In response to that, Harry walked over to him and gave him a big, bear hug, much to his horror.
Ron shoved the rest of the frog in his mouth. "So, who is it?"
He picks up his fork, takes a pancake from the serving plate, and lets it plop on his own.
, and that’s what they talk about while eating Molly’s roast beef and mashed potatoes.
Draco felt sick. Courageous. Slytherins didn't do courageous. And he certainly didn't give out his blood for anyone to take, much less a vampire, but… If it would stop those godawful sounds…
Beside him, Theodore was practically livid. "What! I've spent the past four years trying to convince you to join the Quidditch Team and it takes Draco only four seconds?! You and I are going to have a long talk about this, Potter –"
And it was then that Harry realized that Malfoy had his own problems too. It made him wonder just how differently they had been brought up.
Vernon had asked. So had Dudley. Especially Dudley. Children were too inquisitive and too verbal about it for their own good.
"Anyway, I'm still not taking the spell off you."
With his face burning, Harry very pointedly not looked at him.
Immediately, Harry opened his mouth to say (or at least try to say) something stupid like sorry and the like so Draco saved him from further humiliation by quickly raising a hand up. Harry obediently shut his mouth, looking remorseful and just very put-out.
for teasing Potter. It was just not done.
Draco resumed his task of counting, this time with wormwood leaves. "Not yet."
Remus nodded grimly. "Don't charge into anything without talking to us and Severus about it first, okay? There's a lot of people out there who…" He trailed off, lips pressing together tightly.
The small edges of the bush’s branches dig painfully into his skin, but Draco’s laughter is contagious, especially when he looks so open and relaxed like that.
Draco dragged his eyes back to Potter’s. “How about you? Are you quite done with your little temper tantrum?”
"Harry," she said with a serious voice that made Harry dread. "Have you been doing well in your studies?"
“So is Harry,” Dumbledore said grimly. Snape’s mouth closed shut.
Lucius shared a glance with the two professors, as if they were agreeing on something.
And finally, sleep.
Draco doesn’t know when he stopped trying to get Potter to leave him alone.
He rolled his eyes and sighed exasperatedly, and the silliness of his reaction was what relaxed the tension in Harry’s shoulders enough for him to shake Blaise’s hand as well.
Draco glared. "What should I be mad about? The blood thing? That's hardly within your control, and –" He paused, raising an eyebrow at him. He looked at Potter up and down. Potter had lost weight. "Considering the two times it happened, you seem to be more bothered by it than I am."
Harry could feel his bones and muscles screaming with fatigue, but most of all, he could feel his fractured leg – courtesy of the spider – begging for attention.
Where was his father? Was he even…
“You look like you’re about to throw up.”
was the first thought that came to his head.
Harry wasn't fooled one bit that she was concerned for
Draco already hates himself. He’s not supposed to be doing this. “Tomorrow. Come back tomorrow, I mean.” His heart’s beating loudly in his chest, and he swallows, tries to steady his voice. “You have that cloak of yours.”
He decided against it though because he still wanted to indulge in his 'immature musings' and ire towards one Draco Malfoy a bit more.
Snape nodded stiffly, not knowing what to do with the gratitude in Lupin’s face. “Owl me how it fares if you wish.”
the hidden door.
Madame Pomfrey immediately stood up from her stool in front of Harry and walked over to Draco, frowning thinly. "What is it this time?" It wasn't accusatory. It was more of… deeply concerned.
that kept giving Harry those nightmares. And it was also banking on the theory that to nullify the dormant magic, one needed to use Voldemort’s own active magic, which they also theorized still lived on through his Dark Marks.
The Dark Mark had said “
He hoped that Draco didn't find this too weird, Harry actually trying to start a decent conversation that wasn't out of necessity or obligation to schoolwork.
Harry took out his Self-Erasing Parchment and his Self-Inking Quill and sat down beside Ron.
I merely
," Ron said, whining pitifully. "Why
There were a lot of uncertainties in this mission. Was it true that Voldemort’s magic still existed all these years? Was it true that it lingered in the places where his horcruxes had been destroyed? Was it even his magic? Could it be parts of his untethered soul? If all these were true, the next questions were about destroying it. How?
"You hate me," he blurted out. Then he realized what he just did and flushed in embarrassment.
At that moment, the Floo blared to life with green flames and out came Sirius Black and Remus Lupin.
Draco had been talking non-stop ever since they stepped on the garden, naming all the plants and flowers he could identify, and while Harry really was interested, he didn’t know he could remember all of them.
"Alright. Just had a talk with my godfather."
Instead, Draco stops reading them in the Great Hall. He pockets them, like dirty secrets, and reads them at night, before Potter comes. It hurts, of course it does, and at first, he had read them with the goal of finding out who they were from, but in the end, he realizes that he had been reading them like an act of penitence.
he had finished his shudder of horrified disgust, which was more out of obligation than his actual dislike for Malfoy.)
Viktor Krum was all his posters and slogans said he was – dark, serious, and buff. He stood in one corner in all his muscles and facial hair, not talking to anyone, which Harry saw was just his personality rather than any actual hostility towards the other Champions. Cedric Diggory – to Harry's disappointment – really was a bit of a wuss. He kept fidgeting in his seat whenever Harry neared, and it looked like he was torn between talking to Harry because they were both the Champions for Hogwarts or not because Harry was a Slytherin and a vampire at that.
Not unexpectedly, Ginny rolled her eyes and reached into his trouser pocket for the Self-Erasing Parchment and his Self-Inking Quill. (Harry loved the Weasleys, really. They make life so much easier.)
His prayer was cut short when the fireplace blazed again and out came Seamus Finnigan, all impish grin and mussed hair. Ron stared on in horror. Seamus coming immediately after Harry? That was either coincidence or… Harry really did take Seamus up on his offer for a ménage à trois.
? Tell what, exactly?”
He just realizes that he
Harry's eyes almost bulged out of their sockets and his heart almost burst with joy as he looked at his savior.
forever gone, and that it was Voldemort’s dormant
Harry slams his fist on the railing. The clang of metal rings loudly in the valley, and the bridge shakes with the force of his fist. There is the sound of blood rushing in his ears and he is light-headed with anger, at Draco for being such a dick, and at himself for still being so affected by him.
He pretended to be preoccupied with his chiffon cake, but out of the corner of his eye, he could see the way Potter’s shoulders were slowly stiffening and at the way he was trying very hard not to look away from his treacle tart.
“Huh,” Hermione repeats, pointing with her quill to the other side of the room.
Ron gave him a funny look. "You sure don't look like it."
It was just strange… to go from him hexing you to him offering up his bed because he saw that you weren’t getting enough sleep.
Harry shot him a glare.
And he knows, with the way Potter’s tense shoulders slowly relax and the furrow in his eyebrows ease, that Potter understands the trust and humility that he’s giving in that single act of telling.
, was his third.
Harry couldn't stop the grin that formed on his face. He often made late night trips to the kitchens to swipe some treacle tarts. After all, what was the point of having an Invisibility Cloak if you weren't going to use it?
. Just had a bit of fun. And yes. He’s my cat.”
Dinner came, and Harry brought with him a tray laden with sweets and his Potions homework.
Harry's expression softened and he sighed, rolling his eyes as he leaned forward to capture her in a hug.
important, wasn't it? Very important. Why would Potter do it? If Potter was going be hungry for human blood from now on, he didn't want to be in the same dorm with him. And Potter
He didn’t want to listen anymore.
He needed to get out of the hospital.
The fact that Harry had felt all fluttery and warmed at Draco’s snarling (because that really meant Draco had been worried for him, right?) disturbed him enough that he realized he really was sick.
Draco also found it amusing that Potter, Saint Potter, felt like he was obligated to ask that every time.
Harry had little time to see what it was before the cat sat on it, but he wasn’t the youngest Seeker that Hogwarts has ever had for nothing.
Voldemort's smile widened. Yellow, rotting teeth. Gums the color of fresh blood. Pointed fangs, reminding Harry that Voldemort was a vampire too, that it was Voldemort's fault that
For the past two nights, his sleep had been wrecked with nightmares of graveyards and snakes, sucking all his blood until all that was left of him was a dry husk made of skin and bones. Sometimes the snake transformed into Potter. Most of the time it transformed into the Dark Lord.
to talk about it.
Harry recited in the middle of the common room as the fourth years huddled together in front of the fireplace.
Harry winced, but that still didn't lessen the shock at having Draco so close, and if Harry just moved a little bit, then their lips would touch again and they'd kiss and –
an heir to the Black family."
And, if Harry thought about it deeply, he knew that there was a selfish part of him that was aching to share these things, these memories to somebody else. He, Ron, and Hermione didn’t talk about these things anymore, because after living through it, surviving it, overcoming it, what else was there to talk about?
Even though they were still a great distance away, the cat’s ears perked up and yellow eyes blinked open. Gracefully, it sat up, arched its back into a long stretch, and slowly transformed into Minerva McGonagall.
Potter sighed again. He’d been sighing a lot today. He put his glasses back on, and then looked at him seriously.
His broom followed the movements of his body easily enough. A slight lean forward and the broom accelerated. Harry leaned downwards and the broom swept in the same direction, before Harry leaned and they passed below a bridge, through a narrow arch of stone with Harry spinning full circle on his broom.
At this, Dumbledore sobered. “Yes, I expected as much, and I believe there’s a lot more things that he doesn’t know.”
Severus was sitting behind his desk in his office, a lamp at his side and an irritated look on his face.
"I was informed of what happened in Little Hangleton," Severus started, slowly. He seemed to be putting a lot of thought and care in his words. "Yes, you were bleeding a lot, because of Nagini."
Oh, he knew of the requirements.
The snake started to slither. Malfoy jumped and tried to grab his arm back, but Harry held firmly. Malfoy was staring at him incredulously, almost,
Ron stared at the words for a long while, before snatching another treacle tart. He shrugged. "Alright. Whatever floats your boat."
Potter didn’t seem to share his humor. He nodded gravely. “You did.”
Harry felt his limbs relax all at once at the realization that
"Harry," Hermione started in the middle of Astronomy. Harry and Ron shared greatly alarmed looks, because Hermione ignoring lessons meant that they were in for some serious berating, but she merely continued on as if she were talking about the weather. "You've been in a good mood lately," she said.
but is nonetheless grateful for all efforts to remove the remnants of Voldemort’s stay.
Severus' eyebrow remained raised. "I don't think it's wise to be threatening violence to another student in front of me, Draco, and nobody has said that you were
, but he likes this, eating pancakes like this. By the time he’s finished eating the fourth, Draco has managed to swallow three pieces. There’s syrup on his lap and the front of his nightgown, and there’s also some dripping down his arm, but Harry respectfully looks away from that, too.
Then, Hermione did something very surprising.
Draco sent him a dry look. “Both, Potter.”
"Still not speaking, Potter?"
Draco stares at him, and there is genuine curiosity in his next question. “Why?”
Now, Draco was almost a quarter done with his homework, and he worried what he was going to have to occupy himself with once he had finished it all.
Before he yelled out his destination to the fireplace, he narrowed his eyes at the cat and scowled. “If Harry really does enter a ménage à trois with Dean and Seamus, I’m blaming
“Well, I never! We are not barbarians!” huffed the cabinet behind the hairdresser behind one of the tables in the room.
brightest ideas ever?”
He kissed Draco again.
Astoria had said. He looks at the treacle tart, and thinks that it’s time for a story.
"But not anymore," Draco admitted, not answering the question because he didn't like talking about the handshake incident. "What if I didn't return your feelings?"
, because it's not like Harry's going to do anything about it or anything stupid like kiss him or something. No, that would be disastrous.
"Yeah, shite," Draco scoffed, now pushing him away. "My neck is taking
Stomach churning, Harry followed.
"Oh, God," Ron said, sounding like he was going to be sick. "I think the frog's still jumping in my stomach."
“Be careful, Malfoy. I might just consider that a compliment.”
let alone cast a spell. Harry was good with non-verbal magic, but those were easy spells like Scourgify and Accio-ing Yorkshire pudding from Dean's plate. Definitely not for fighting Scandinavian Goblins in Defense Against the Dark Arts.
It’s hard when Potter’s sweet enough to get angry for him. Draco closes his eyes and takes a deep breath before he does something stupid like confess.
He hoped they wouldn’t though.
Nagini slithered away from Draco, injured, hiding away to nurse her wounds.
Harry quickly swallowed his gillyweed.
“Because,” Ron said, his panic at having his best mate enter a ménage a trois with Seamus and Dean taking over his nerves. “Malfoy’s going to throw a hissy fit and maybe they’ll finally stop rounding each other and actually
Draco does. He doesn’t think he can do it for very
Crabbe was promised a cupcake."
Draco was startled at the offer. He blinked, before slowly nodding. "Much appreciated, Potter."
Harry glared at him. And not at the way Pansy had her arm hooked around Draco's. They had started to get physically close ever since fourth year started, and Harry knew that everyone had noticed but was just politely letting it run its course. Even Blaise sometimes had started to hang out Theodore and him more frequently nowadays.
, thought Harry sullenly.
Draco had just Scourgified his clothes and his bed, unable to stand the grit and the dirt anymore, when Potter asked if he knew that it was the Forbidden Forest he was walking to, which evolved into the conversation they are having now.
Harry shrugged.
Snape tried to keep the corners of his lips from twitching upwards. “Christmas,” he confirmed.
“I left my inkwell,” Draco sighed irritably and started to walk towards the library – towards Harry. He called over his shoulder. “Wait for me, Pans.”
have the rare week off. He should probably do that, then, if this was going to happen six more times.
a book from long ago whispered warningly in his head.
But it was gone as soon as it had appeared, to be replaced by his mask of indifference and yet Harry still felt like punching someone or kicking someone in the shin or – or – breaking his knuckles again on a tree, because he didn't hit girls.
He grit his teeth and paddled his webbed feet faster.
He had wandered upstairs, bracing himself should he bump into Potter, but he didn't see a wink of him the whole time. The third floor was a maze of hallways and rooms, and Draco hadn't been able to keep count of how many rooms they were. He didn't even try with the fourth floor.
Granger nodded in understanding. Draco liked that she hadn’t hesitated to even think whether he
Harry doesn’t know what to feel with the knowledge of Draco and Astoria being close enough that she can call him by his first name and that he had already told her of what had transpired last night. “Oh.”
“We made our choices. Now we are atoning for them. I am not proud of them. But given the chance to do it all again, to be given the choice to save the world or save my family, I… I don’t think I would have been any wiser.” This time, she glances back at her son, and says, slowly, “It just pains me, when I look back, to remember him having to make that choice as well.”
Harry grins. “So? How is it?”
wasn't going to be like other mornings because it was then that Harry's eyes turned to him and they were unusually brighter than normal and Draco realized that
A sudden splash and a sharply-uttered curse behind him told him that Malfoy had tripped. Harry tried to hide his laugh.
As they walked back to the dungeons, Draco occasionally complaining about Harry stepping on his foot, Harry let himself think that this was… okay.
But this meant that he was going to be spending his summer with Severus? With
It’s definitely weird, taking care of Draco Malfoy.
“My, my,” an old, rasping voice sounded out from behind them.
, Nott," Harry ground out through gritted teeth. His head was already starting to pound and it's only been an hour after he found that he was going to join this awful tournament where more than half of its contenders end up either dying or incapacitated. "We've been practically joined at the hip this past week. Trust me, if I had put my name inside that stupid cup, you would
Draco looks at him straight in the eyes, unamused. “Merlin, Potter, if we wanted you indisposed, Binky would have poisoned your pancakes by now.”
Potter nodded in agreement. It was a very Slytherin way of thinking. It was good that he and Draco were well-versed in that. "I'll let you know if there's anything new, or if there's anything that can help you and your family."
Draco's stare turned incredulous. "I just took out my wand, Potter. I might as well be ready to hex you!"
Harry, who is sitting across from them and thus facing backwards from their source of curiosity, turns on impulse. “What are you guys looking at?”
now and had bitten his nails off worrying about being burnt to a crispy fried Harry.
"Malfoy, Pansy wanted me to ask you something," he blurted out.
tolerate roughhousing."
Harry immediately shook his head, messing his already disorderly hair.
Harry smiles at her gratefully. He stands up and motions towards the door. There are too many people watching here. He hates it. “Mind if we take a walk?”
“Try it, then,” Harry said. “Let’s try your right hand.”
The knife was raised and the hooded figure raised a hand along with it. Harry watched in horror at the sight of the hand with its pinky missing, and knew what the figure was about to do. He closed his eyes as a piercing scream sliced through the air, and Harry knew that there was no hand left there now.
It was comfortable.
, before forcing an arm under Malfoy’s neck and around his chest, a leg under his hip and over his knees, and locking the rest of his limbs around Malfoy’s body, before shoving his hand in his pocket to tightly curl around the ink bottle—
His father was supposed to go somewhere in Romania for ‘business’ and his mother was going to visit a sick relative in Venice for a whole two weeks. They would both be back a few days before the first of September, just in time to accompany Draco in Diagon Alley and buy him new robes and school supplies.
"DRACO!"
And so, Draco found himself quite unready for the uncomfortable memories that were bringing themselves up to the surface the longer they stood in front of the bathroom door.
Draco wasn't sure. He was starting to get a migraine.
“Hey!” Ginny huffed, glaring at him reproachfully. “That tart still better be there when I get back –“
inside a Wizarding World where
And he swallows all the hesitation down his throat and pulls Potter down for a kiss.
It’s cold, but Potter takes his hand, curls his fingers around Draco’s, and they’re not supposed to be doing that, either, but Draco wants to.
By now, he had fully taken over Goyle’s bed as his. It’s as messy as his own bed back in Gryffindor Tower, sheets rumpled and pillows skewed sideways. Sometimes, he forgets some of his things, a quill here and a Merlin card gotten from a chocolate frog box there, and these are the things that occupy the bed when he’s gone.
And then, like a lit candle, all conversation returned at once, the hall bursting with excited chatter as they wondered which of the first years was the famous Harry Potter.
Draco scowled. "So? Why did you do it?"
“Only barbarians don’t ask for consent,” Draco scoffed haughtily, but a fond smirk was on his face. “You’re a wizard, for Merlin’s sake. Accio the feline.”
,” he quipped, using Draco’s term for it to get a smile out of him.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Yes, I know you’re Sirius.”
No one was present in the Paved Courtyard for everyone was busily scurrying off towards the Great Hall for dinner. Harry wondered if now was a good time as any to hex Ginny's hair into snakes.
Malfoy cleared his throat nervously behind him. “I suppose I’m to take care of them simultaneously then?”
“The second is Nagini.”
As if the war didn’t happen.
The next day, it was Draco who started the conversation.
"What's the first line again?" Blaise asked, elbow propped on his thigh, and his chin on his open palm. He tapped a finger on his cheek thoughtfully.
So he did what he only knew to do.
"No!" Harry shouted, thrashing against the tombstone.
“What – but – what –“
Whenever he’d leave for work, he’d leave the window open just slightly so that the cat could wiggle in and out as it pleased.
The cat sniffed delicately in the air, about-faced, raised its bum up in Harry's face and promptly walked away.
He frowned, his good mood suddenly plummeting down.
Theodore wasn't really mad. When they returned back to their dorms at the godawful hour of midnight, he lasted twenty minutes of not talking to Harry, before curiosity got the best of him and he asked, "So, what's inside the egg?"
That night gave him a particularly bad dream.
Snape may not be fond of showering Harry acts of favouritism during the school year, but that didn't mean Harry still didn't get any perks.
thing.
Harry felt his heart skip a beat. Was Draco…
Harry recognized it as Narcissa’s.
"Draco!" he exclaimed with a smile that he hoped wasn't too relieved and wasn't too ecstatic. “Since when have you been back?”
“He’d never believe you.”
Later that night, when dinner had went and gone by after being secretly spent in the library, Harry trodded up to the Gryffindor Tower with a skip in his step and a smile on his face.
The next time he woke up, it was to sticky sheets and the realization that he really did miss Malfoy's sneer. The bed next to his was empty and so was the rest of the Hospital Wing. With a burning face, he quickly Scourgified himself and the bed, and convinced himself that Madame Pomfrey wasn't going to send an army of Inferi towards him if he went out of the infirmary now.
She reaches over, takes his hand in hers, and says, earnestly, “Thank you.”
Snape couldn’t muster enough hatred within him to feel happy at the sight of Black in tears.
Harry grinned at him. “And
"Ow!" Draco exclaimed, glaring at Harry.
Now, it was Granger and Weasley’s turn.
At first he had thought that maybe the boy didn’t know his own birthday.
Draco really was flirting with him, it wouldn’t do to respond in kind since he had no idea how flirting worked and would probably just embarrass himself if he tried to attempt it. If Draco wasn’t, then the same reasoning applied.
Harry felt his hands turn clammy.
“Ah, I remember.” Seamus nodded dramatically. “Hols two years ago, am I right? The year you told everyone you fancied ‘em blokes and Ginny got you a pink apron to greet your future hubby with. Dean and I made a bet with that ‘un. I bet three galleons that you’d more likely greet your hubby with
. There were all kinds of shops selling all kinds of things that Harry’s only seen in books before. He saw cauldrons big and small, quills that changed colour depending on the writer’s mood and boots that walked on their own.
Something burst out from the hedges and Harry pointed his wand, ready to attack – but it was only Cedric, frazzled and out of breath and burnt slightly at the sleeves, yammering about Hagrid's Blast-Ended Skrewts, but he was gone as soon as he came.
And Harry thinks that she’s not just asking about the now, she’s asking about the yesterday, the tomorrow, and his every day. And he doesn’t know why he wants to be honest at this moment, maybe it’s because Narcissa has also already bared herself, that it seems… safe to bare himself, too. In the end, he allows himself a little bit of honesty.
saved my life. I… I want to…”
The staircase had seemed much bigger then, much taller. Harry remembered being 11 years old, short and small, looking up at the steps in awe and in wonder at the magical places it was sure to lead him to.
The thought of a pregnant Ginny made him shudder.
Harry bit his lower lip to stop himself from voicing out any more complaints or whines. It was unbecoming of a Slytherin, especially of Severus Snape's charge. He squared his shoulders. He exhaled loudly. "Alright."
through his mind and
“Oh.” Granger blinked again. “That means, only the last one…” Her eyes traveled to Potter.
And Madame Pomfrey had admonished his father that morning, telling him not to disturb her other patients, but… There was no one else inside the Hospital Wing besides him when he woke up.
– because Draco was bleeding, spluttering blood, and Nagini was squeezing the life out of him and there was chaos everywhere, everybody was screaming, and Harry saw Lucius fire a spell at the snake and lights were bursting out of everyone's wands –
Just like that, Harry felt embarrassment washing over him again. He grabbed a jar and scrubbed it with gusto. "I'm not interested."
Draco pursed his lips in confusion, as if he was perplexed that Harry didn’t want to drink his blood. “But aren’t vampires supposed to drink blood?”
It was probably for the best that he often blanked out from the pain at some point. He couldn’t remember being transported to the Hospital Wing, or to this… wherever this room was.
Harry starts to refuse, insist that she doesn’t need to, but the Weasleys know that he’s gone to the Manor today. Tried all tricks and tactics to get him
"DRACO!"
get his voice again.
Severus nodded. "The venom eventually loses its potency after a few weeks. But by then, your muscles would have started to atrophy, and your internal organs would stop to function. Enough time for Voldemort to… acquire what he wanted at his own leisurely pace."
Kreacher called him for lunch. Lunch was roast beef, mashed potatoes, and steak-and-kidney pies. Kreacher did everything for him: pulled up his chair, served him food, filled his goblet. Much like his House Elves back in Malfoy Manor.
was one name that always came up. “Goyle hasn’t been contacted by anyone in years. Nott, as I’m sure you’re aware, is a wanted wizard all across the United Kingdom for numerous, petty crimes.”
It did scar. Severus did what he could at the time, but it still left a gash on his chest that Draco sometimes looked at in the mirror to remind himself that he got what he deserved. “It’s healed,” he said instead. “All in the past.”
be another way for him to take the spell off!
"You're…" Draco started, swallowing nervously as Harry sat down on the chair across him. "You're really giving it to me?" he said, once again in that quiet and unsure voice of his that Harry had come to hate.
This time, Harry
, he thought grumpily then made another sudden swerve.
The next day, Harry woke up with a headache and a stomach feeling like lead. Nevertheless, he was decided that he wasn't going to spend the morning wallowing in self-pity and hiding from the rest of the world.
“Well, you haven’t really been exercising lately.”
to. Both of them knew that there were just some things that you had to do, and this was one of them.
“Invisibility Cloak,” Potter explains, as if that says everything about why he’s suddenly in Slytherin, in the middle of Draco’s room,
Potter leads them out of the Common Room, out of the dungeons, and out of the castle into the Transfiguration Courtyard. The sun is peeking out from the horizon, painting the sky and Potter’s glasses.
Draco makes it through half of his plate, before the fork slips from his fingers and clanks loudly on the marble floor of his balcony, and Harry looks up at him, ready to ask if he should get it for him, but Draco’s gone again.
Draco was snapped out of his thoughts when Potter called his name.
you thickhead.”
He’s dismayed to find that, over the course of the next few weeks, her name and Draco’s name are more often than not beside each other in the Slytherin Common Room.
But as far as Time After the Time Turner was concerned, Narcissa never said those haunting words. She never visited Snape Manor during that fateful summer, she never grabbed Draco's arm and forcibly pulled him towards the Floo, and never forbade him from being friends with Harry Potter.
And wasting concern over an ex-Death Eater?
It works. The suspicion is still on Draco’s face, like he’s wondering why Harry’s suddenly so talkative, but it’s mixed with a sudden curiosity. “Is that why you feel the need to bury your face in chocolate frogs after every meal?”
for a while now—bed, staring at the green curtains falling from the bed’s canopy. The colour is starting to grow on him. He likes it best on pale skin.
“That’s what the ridiculously long and frequent weeks off are for, right?” Draco said, more bravado than actual confidence. “And my Healer team from St. Mungo’s on standby.”
Draco didn’t even spare him a glance and Harry didn’t look back.
Madame Pomfrey cast some more diagnostic spells on Draco. "Now, Mr. Malfoy, is there pain anywhere?"
He sits down on the chair across Draco and lets the weirdness and the overall awkwardness of the situation sink in and settle. This is the first time he’s here without Narcissa to talk to, just him and Draco, who’s currently awake but is off in some other world in his head.
The library was empty, thank Merlin. Even Madame Pince was not present, as she was in the Great Hall finishing her breakfast. Harry quickly dismounted, placed the broom in one corner, and went straight for the 'J' aisle.
A window broke.
The night was quiet once more.
There was the sound of a chair scraping the floor and footsteps leaving and Harry found that he could breathe properly again.
Potter sighed heavily. “Nott is currently in Ministry custody. He was arrested just last night in England. We’re thinking if he’ll be willing to do what you’re doing for a lighter sentence.”
as thick as James'. His head, I would like to believe, he got from Lily."
Draco had wanted to ask, but knew that Potter wouldn’t answer him honestly anyway.
“Harry,” Harry cuts in.
When Harry turned back, gone were the anger and fury that once held Draco's shoulders stiff. What replaced them were shock and bewilderment.
It makes him uncomfortable, the way Potter makes sure to greet him every time they pass by each other in the halls.
all of our Auror Classes
After a small pause, Harry nodded slowly. Taking a small piece of spare parchment, he picked up his quill and wrote on it.
"Honestly, one would think that after all the bones you've broken, you would have gotten used to it by now," tutted Madame Pomfrey as she poured the contents of the bottle evenly into the two glasses. She gave one to Harry and the other, she gave to the person lying down on the bed beside his.
Holding his breath, Draco taps the parchment with his wand and says, “I solemnly swear I am up to no good.”
Sirius beamed at him and ruffled his hair again. “Good boy. Now, come on. Moony’ll bite both our heads off if we’re late. Now, step inside the fireplace and you take this powder, yeah? Throw it to the floor at the same time you say…”
Harry did not know what to do with such and sudden honesty.
Severus, dripping wet and his hair plastered flat on his head, spluttering furiously and cursing Albus and Minerva alternately for putting him in an Enchanted Sleep.
"Well done, Harry!"
Their eyes remained level with each other, even after Draco asked his next question. "Maybe more?"
“Then you know what it feels like. And to go through it again and again, every day, for three months.”
“Probably just to make sure we’re not hiding Death Eaters in our dungeons ready to ambush the Golden Boy to revive You-Know-Who,” Draco mutters.
"They are, Potter," Draco said agreeably, before a look of discomfort clouded his face. "I suppose I deserve it though," he muttered bitterly, body stiffening once again.
” Snape sneered.
Draco’s eyes lit up like fairy lights. “
seem to know a lot about plants.”
He goes about his every day, studying for tests, avoiding photographs, and laughing with friends, resolutely pretending that it doesn’t hurt.
“Blaise Zabini. My mother went out with a vampire once. Was absolutely smitten with him as he was her.”
“They’re both true, Potter. Don’t be so sensitive over it.”
Harry let it follow him to the nearest telephone booth and when the cat jumped inside after him, he thought about whether it was wise or not to let it enter the Ministry.
He’s not supposed to be swiping treacle tart from the dinner table so that they could munch on something while studying, because treacle tart is Potter’s favorite, and since when did he care about Potter’s favorites?
It’s worrisome how the words are out before he can stop them. “Can I come with you?”
Harry’s eyebrows furrowed in confusion at Remus’ funny tone.
The first thing that told him that there was something wrong was the retching.
When the shower of rocks stopped, Harry leapt forward and then to the ground, ignoring Malfoy’s hoarse cries of
Harry's shoulders were slumped, and his eyes were wide and green and nervous as they stared at the table. It was that that made Draco know that this morning wasn't going to be like the rest, aside from the fact that Harry didn't have any treacle tart with him.
And all the times that he had spent this year talking with Pansy, Blaise, and Draco again.
Definitely not.
Harry laughed shortly. “Thanks, Sirius, Remus. For all my new stuff and I had a really, really great time,” he said earnestly, hoping that his smile was big enough to convey his gratitude.
Even Malfoy becoming Seeker couldn't save them. And Malfoy was already pretty good, if a bit pigheaded at times.
And it was just that all these encounters with Draco were keeping him in this good mood.
"I am
She turns back to him. “It’s been a bit tiring to attend so many functions. I dislike leaving Draco alone, especially as he is right now.”
"It's a tried and tested trick," Potter said defensively.
to tell Ginny!"
Draco looked back just in time to see Potter fall off his broom and drop ten feet to the ground.
“Bollocks,” Ron says. “You better start using it on Astoria Greengrass, too. They’re getting awfully touchy.”
ready? You’ll be doing the hard part. I’ll just be waving my wand and screaming for the next hour.”
in front of the other students. Severus never reprimanded him for those but Harry still felt guilty.
and that was that. Gritty the House Elf nodded in acknowledgement and disappeared with a pop.
one more thing he was worried about. And he was pretty sure this required all of his concern right now.
“That’s Crabbe and that’s Goyle,” Draco introduced offhandedly. “I’ve got two more friends coming over, so –“
Harry choked on his own saliva.
Ginny preens at the praise. Then, she narrows her eyes at him. “Is it… because of…
of seeing him so strung-up and stiff and
Pansy's face was by no means heart-shaped, but he figured she would like that description. He was right. Pansy's face broke out into a satisfied grin. "Honestly, Harry, flattery will get you everywhere. If only I wasn't so enamoured with Draco, I really would snog you."
