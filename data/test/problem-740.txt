,,The great Hall is that way, you know“ Astoria said, smiling innocently and dragged Draco away from the grand staircase. He really just wanted to go down into the dungeons and into his room to get some peace but felt unable to do so, when Astoria led him towards the hall with such confidence and just maybe he was surprised that she was still talking to him, so he was a little afraid to push her away that she might really give up on talking to him.
,,I would like you all to open the book, on page 245. Ms. Greengrass, care to read it out aloud for us?“ Daphne got up from her seat ,with her book in her hand and started reading the text about how to spot signs of dark magic on objects. Draco emptied his head and concentrated on the lesson, marking everything that seemed important and could be used in the next exams. He had always been quite a good student, his grades mostly never less than an A but his outstanding grades were always overshadowed by Hermione Granger. God, how much he hated her for that. No matter what he did, there was always someone who was better than him and her smug face and the proud smile, whenever she got praised from the teachers or admiration from students, filled him with so much hate. She was a mudblood, unworthy of a place in a wizard school. Of course Draco knew it all had stirred from nothing more than jealousy. He had insulted her badly, treated her like dirt and hoped that she would just die along the way. He felt sorry towards not only her but all the halfbloods and muggleborn he had bullied over all those years without an ounce of pity. The feeling of remorse was still something he wasn't used to. What started as just words, he didn't really understood the meaning of and just imitated from his parents, turned into a hatred for all those who weren't reaching the standards of his parents. He had grown up with his parents, telling him to stay away from mudbloods because they are freaks of nature and that they all should’ve been killed as infants as they were nothing more than a disgrace to the wizarding world. Since he could remember, the flame of hatred in the eyes of his parents was so big. He never thought much about it and carried on with his parents beliefs.
The pair of grey eyes, that normally had a lethargic feeling to them, were now spread wide open and the terror of the nightmare as clear as water to see in those eyes. His heart pounding as if he had just nearly escaped death, started to calm down when he realized that he was in his bed, at home, safe. The bangs of his white-blondish hair were drenched in sweat and a look at the big block that hung above his door, told him that it was only 4 in the morning. He sat up in his bed and leaned against the steel wall of his bed, that was covered with a black vintage style cover to make it comfortable to lean against. It was silent and as much as he was used to this silence, his hatred for it had only been growing stronger in the past months. Maybe it was because he knew, this silence would never be interrupted again from voices he had been so used to hear his whole life.
When he first came to school, unlike most others he already had a group of friends, sons of his fathers friends he had known since birth and when everyone in the train found out that he was the only heir of the Malfoy's, they seemed to practically throw themselves onto him, to become his friend. But it only took a few hours and everyone found out about the great Harry Potter who was now a first year student at Hogwarts and if that hadn’t already been enough, he had the audacity to turn down a Malfoy and humiliate him in front of all those people. Draco knew he had made his mission to make Potter’s life at Hogwarts a living hell for that. He had expected to be the center of attention but was painfully thrown aside for the infamous boy who lived. Even though he had grown up, with only needing to point at something to get it and his mothers lovely words that he was a very special boy because he was a Malfoy, he seemed to have a hunger for attention that could never be filled. Much later, he would only realize that it stirred from the hunger for a love, he had never received. The one that had been missing inside his big bedroom, that felt lonely without someone to read him a book or tell him that the monsters underneath his bed were not real. Draco would more likely accept death than ever admit to himself, that the true nature of all his past action were nothing more than a attempt to feel loved.
,,Why are you here then?“ Pansy asked annoyed that Daphne always needed to be a moral apostle at some point ,,Because at least one person has to make sure, that Draco and Blaise don’t kill each other“ ,,As if that traitor would be brave enough for that“ Pansy scoffed gloating and grabbed her boyfriends hand, who was walking slightly ahead of her. Daphne looked at her sister, who silently followed them hoping for some sort of support but she didn’t gave the impression she cared much about what happened with the two boys.
Shivering from the cold night air, he tried to find some sort of shadow that stood out from the rest and looked like the big castle, that was his school but even though the moon was shining, his light was blocked out from the crowns of the trees that submerged the sky above him. Fear began to rise again at his hopeless situation. After the war, the centaurs had demanded a big part of the world to be theirs and if they would find him, they were surely not gonna make him live to see another day. Ready to try his luck, he concentrated on the magic light bubble that he created to stabilize his magic and started to head into a direction but took a step backwards when a small light appeared in the distance. He looked around, trying to find somewhere he could hide but expect trees, the forest allowed no hide away and running didn't seem like a very good idea too. The woods were dangerous, no matter where you are.
,,But don’t worry, this time I won’t let you search for a bleeding unicorn“ he laughed as if it was a memory that was dear but the boys surely remembered being scared for their life’s ,,Well then, we shall not waste time, reminiscing about old times right? Two days ago, one of the Centaur approached me and told me about mermaid scales they have found in the forest“ ,,Mermaid scales? But they live in the sea’s“ ,,Right, Harry. That’s what doesn’t make sense. I went to the sea and Hagiri, one of the mermaids, told me that the past weeks, some of their swarm had went missing and found later on, almost dried out and with their scales scraped off” Harry breathed sharply in  ,,but you see, the traces end at a hole, it’s big but you know-“ Hagrid giggled slightly embarrassed and pointed towards his belly ,,-I might have gained a bit weight the last months“ it wasn’t enough to make Harry laugh but he smiled lightly and told Hagrid that they would love to help him, at which Draco glared at him because he had said ’they‘, including him which wouldn’t be very close to the truth because Draco never liked that giant much. If he would ask himself why, he wouldn’t be sure if he could answer that question.
A small light bubble appeared in front of him, lightening just enough to see the outlines of his surroundings but sadly at the realization where he was, he didn’t feel better. They had dragged him down into the forbidden forest and he had no clue how deep they had brought him into. He sat down on one of the roots, he now recognized as the objects he had stumbled over a few times and looked at his feet that were greatly affected by the lack of protection. A mixture of blood, from where the sticks and stones had bore into his skin and the dirt that clung onto his skin, covered his feet and as the adrenaline and shock slowly went away, he felt the pain of it. Through his natural body reflexes, his right elbow with which he had used to cushion his fall, had a few small scratched too and burned quite heavily.  He cursed under his breath and moved his hand through his already messy hair. There goes his first peaceful night in Hogwarts. He felt foolish for believing that things like this wouldn't happen. Slytherin's had always been people, who took betrayal very serious and while everyone else was busy, healing from the wounds the last years had caused, it was clear that they wouldn't miss a chance to bully and hurt. It just seemed like they were the only ones, who returned this school year just the same as they had in the 5th year.
,,Stop, please!“ he whimpered, his voice cracking as he steadied himself on the sink, he had been standing at way too often, breaking down the last years.
,,It’s not like I wanna do this work with you either“ Harry had said, when they left the office and Draco had told him to stay away from him as far as possible ,,Let’s just agree to pretend like the other isn’t there, okay?“ ,,As if Saint Potter could ever pretend he doesn’t exist“ ,,Only once, please! Can you only once just stop being such a dick?!“ ,,What did you call me?!“ Harry rolled his eyes, clearly not in the mood to deal with Malfoy’s annoying behavior that he had been used to for many years now ,,Why did I decline the offer of getting away“ he muttered to himself but Draco had heard him and chuckled scornful
"I have no idea how we're going to do that for everyone else in Britain," Grandfather Arcturus complained, yawning hugely in the middle of "Britain".
"Well, let's see what it says," Professor McGonagall declared. "She'll not leave until we have some sort of reply for her person."
He was bigger than he seemed lying down, easily six foot plus. Very skinny, though, like he hadn't been able to eat enough for a long, long time.
The real point was a bit harder. Properly set up and maintained wards could forbid undesired people access to the property either by foot or floo or Apparation or broom. Even portkeys could be blocked. Draco struggled for a bit to get the wards to refuse access to anyone who had the taint of the Dark Lord's magic on their core.
"He stole my books," Harry exclaimed, "dumped me in a home where I'd never learn anything about magic and where I'd be abused. He hired Voldemort to teach at the school! I mean, from what Silverclaw said, there's no way he couldn't tell that Voldemort had possessed Professor Quirrell. Hogwarts has wards. We were all told we were perfectly safe there because of the wards. Then there's the whole thing with the Philosopher's Stone and the unicorns and the maze. How is hiding the Philosopher's Stone behind traps that three first-years can get through a good way of protecting the Stone? And, really, how do we know that prophecy that started it all is real? There's… so… many things!"
He slapped his hands over his mouth because that came out way louder than it should have. Harry flipped the hood back and grinned.
Draco huffed while Harry squawked with outrage. Both of them were drowned out by the shouts of protest from the Weasleys, Neville and Hermione. None of the adults looked as though they were going to listen to a single word of disagreement from the children.
The purple and ugly green magic screamed through the cell, making an electronic sort of screech that hurt Harry's teeth as it fled from a golden wolf that erupted out of Remus. The wolf was connected to Remus by a golden cord that led from its tail straight back to his chest. Draco clutched Harry's hand, shaking as hard as Harry did.
Mother bit her lip, smoothing her hands over her skirt nervously. "I would not dare to approach her. She was quite disappointed in my when I married Lucius."
As there wasn't much to share, just the warming and personalizing of the wards, their curiosity and dislike for Dumbledore's blessing and then the vision of Lady Magic, it didn't take long at all. Once Draco was done, Grandfather Arcturus grunted.
When Dobby lifted his head, his eyes were nearly all dark green with only lightning bolts of yellow and celadon shot through them like lightning bolts cutting across the sky at night.
Draco shrank their brooms, pocketing them. He looked and felt as nervous as Harry, peering around the statue as if he expected them to be attacked at any second.
"You were right," Grandfather Arcturus said straight to Harry. "The man we've all been calling Dumbledore isn't. He's… Grindelwald. I didn't bother with the Ministry. I went straight to Nurmengard myself. Remus came along. The man imprisoned there all these years was Albus Dumbledore. Grindelwald has been running around, using his name all these years."
Draco's eyes went from pale blue to electric sapphire as he straightened up beside Harry. "What else could it be?"
He kept walking, whispering "please help us save them all" under his breath. Each step brightened the gravel. After the first turn, Harry dispelled the lumos and put his wand away. After the second, he pushed back the hood of his cloak.
He kept his voice down so that Mother wouldn't ask what they were talking about while Remus and Grandfather Arcturus struggled to see if either of them could replicate what Harry had done without going into the Potter ward room.
That, thankfully, ended their violent-agreement fight. The gorgeous light from the stained glass windows of the library crept across the floor, up onto the table where dozens of books were spread open. It stained the blue, black, green and purple ink bottles red and gold before creeping across the table and towards the far bookshelves like a cat slowly pacing its way towards its favorite sleeping place.
He seemed hugely honored by getting to call Grandpa Arcturus "grandpa", far more than Harry had been when he got the offer.
He pressed his forehead against Harry's cheek and smiled as the exhaustion, the energy, the weird flow between them settled into something much more comfortable. Not all the energy leaving Draco and none coming back, but the two of them creating a pool between them that settled still and calm and warm around them.
The exhaustion was a riptide pulling him under that neither he nor Harry could resist, no matter what might come in the morning.
Draco gripped the cloak in two places while Harry wrapped an arm around his back and closed the gap again. Tippy nodded and then put his hands on their chests. His eyes gleamed with magic that zapped through Draco like he'd been hit with lightning.
He bowed his head and gripped the edge of his cot. There wasn't anything to see. When everyone else had done it, Harry had been able to see their magic drifting over their skin. For Remus, there was nothing like that.
"Oh, um, figured out how to break the curse on him," Harry replied with a shrug of his shoulders. "And, you know, a lot of other stuff. Are you okay? I mean, you dad did just die."
"Do you think there is a way to save everyone?" Harry asked after a long couple of minutes where they just held each other and relaxed under the warm weight of the blankets.
"Of course I want them," Harry said, pitching his voice low so that Uncle Vernon wouldn't hear him and letting it come out as hurt as he felt. "They're everything. It's my birthday, Dobby. All I've gotten all day is abuse and scorn. To get to hold even one of those would be… It would be such a gift. But I don't get that, do I? I guess that's to be expected. I mean, you're just one more person to hurt me in a long line of horrible, abusive people. Another terrible thing happening on another horrible birthday."
At least the wards sang with their intent to keep Dumbledore and his minions out. There was no way that Remus or Professor McGonagall would be able to come here. They would have been thrown back by the floo. If they attempted to apparate in, they would be thrown off. Even portkeys would refuse them.
"Do you know of a way to cure lycanthropy, Dobby?" Amal asked even though it was blatantly impossible to do so. "I mean, the curses are designed to stick to a werewolf. If Remus wasn't a werewolf, then we could get the curses off easy."
Not the top floor. That was probably reserved for really rich and powerful people. But still. High up, and in this area of London, and oh Merlin, Harry was going to hyperventilate right there as he walked up the hallway to his seneschal's office if he didn't stop fretting about how badly he did not fit in.
"Thank you, Dobby," Harry said, grinning. He offered a fist which Dobby proudly bumped before popping away.
He turned and Moody was there with an Unspeakable behind him. No, with a whole team of Unspeakables in their hoods and bland grey robes. Behind them was a healer who glared and pushed at shoulders to try to get through.
"Boys," Mother said as she put her hands on Draco's shoulders. "That's enough now. Grandfather, are you truly better?"
She trilled again, rubbing her beak against Harry's hair, and then grooming him like he was a chick.
"Whoa, you look terrible," Harry said. He pulled Draco straight to the bed, which had the curtains pulled back and the blankets turned down. "Into bed. Come on. Off with the robe. Slippers, too. You can't put slippers in bed, Draco. Ivy will have conniptions."
"Oh, my god," Harry gasped as he dashed into the library and then flung open the drapes to stare out the window. "Oh, wow. Draco!"
Tippy popped into the circle of the cloak, immediately wrapping his arms around Harry and Draco's legs. "Tippy does not like it here!"
Draco seemed almost impatient with Harry's ignorance, frowning at Harry, but he waved off Hermione's beliefs readily enough. Draco huffed as he scooted back so that he could hook his legs over the arm of his chair, leaning back into the corner made by the arm of the chair and the seatback with his arms crossed over his chest.
Harry grinned and went to his trunk. When he pulled out the invisibility cloak, Draco frowned at it as if Harry were being ridiculous. That lasted just as long as it took for Harry to sling it over his shoulders and cover his head. Then Draco gasped and stared at the spot where Harry had been.
Harry's head went back at the word "abusive". For a second, Draco expected that Harry was going to start shouting denials of the truth that Draco had seen with his own eyes. But Harry didn't.
It wasn't a voice. There were no words. Draco knew what had been said without hearing the words or seeing a face. It was Magic, pure and simple and so alive that Draco's eyes drifted mostly shut. Harry moaned and swayed, his eyes drooping, too.
Draco snorted a laugh, finally looking at Harry again. His eyebrows went up as he sat up properly. Harry didn't even realize that something was wrong until Draco held up a hand as if to shield his eyes.
"I must teach you how to dance," Draco whispered as they passed the library and found the second secret tunnel that would take them down to the proper passage into the bowels of Hogwarts.
"All right, that's enough," Harry announced. "Ron, Hermione, knock it off. Draco's my soulmate. Be polite or I'll, I'll, I'll sick Professor McGonagall and Grandpa Arcturus on you."
"Lady Magic," Draco whispered as the reversed sky trembled overhead and the black path cracked and showed gleaming rainbow ribbons of light below their feet.
Because he could feel every single mile between the two of them. It felt like their bond was a harp string that hummed after being plucked. The last twenty-four hours had changed so much that Draco was at a loss to get his mind around them all. Even Father's death and becoming the Malfoy patriarch hadn't been as big of a change as discovering his bond to Harry and the depth of Dumbledore's duplicity.
"I'd trust Dobby to hide them," Harry said. "But the fewer who know, the more powerful the prayer is. We have to get the entire world, Draco. Not just Britain but everywhere. There're so many people all over the world who've been affected. You know how long he's been doing this. We gotta get everyone, everywhere, if we can."
Yes, there was a solution. Yes, he could keep trying. Yes, it was absolutely worth it to go without sleep, to skip meals, to work himself to the bone and beyond if it would help the people he cared about.
"Most pranks do not require the map," George agreed. "This. This does. Right, so Dumbledore is there, and it does call him Dumbledore. Interesting."
Draco grinned at him. "Touch it with one finger, Potter. Think about it being in English. For Merlin's sake, you're the Patriarch. They answer to you. Though yes, you absolutely do need to learn runes. Both ancient and modern. They're terribly useful."
Harry stared at him. "More words, please. Who's Arcturus Black? Where is he? Can I make him an ally? What cadet lines? Who are they? What's family magic, for that matter? No one said a thing about that at Hogwarts."
"Yes," Cooper said with a little snort of disgust and a dramatic roll of his eyes when Remus opened his mouth to protest. "Is not the wards which was problem. Besides, wards here have been all redone, completely new. Weaknesses fake Dumbles put in are no longer there. Should not be a problem at all now."
Both Fred and George sucked in sharp breaths as they stared at Moony in awe. Draco rolled his eyes and pushed the map closer to Remus who seemed somewhat reluctant to touch it at first. He brushed one finger across the corner of it, eyes sad, before sweeping his hands over the surface.
Harry stared at the note for a long moment before passing it to Draco even though Professor McGonagall held her hand out to take it. Draco read it, frowning. He saw the exact moment that Draco reached the crossed-out torrid affair bit because Draco went beet red as his eyebrows flew up towards his hairline and then he slapped the letter against his chest.
Which didn't stop Harry's hands from shaking as he pulled the secret entrance open. It didn't stop his heart from pounding like a jackhammer in his chest. And it certainly didn't stop the worry and fear from echoing between Draco and Harry.
What the adults had to say was lots of cursing, Mr. Swashlin counting hours and then running for the Floo to send a message for Draco, and Mother hissing in outrage that Father had dared to sign such a contract on Draco's behalf without consulting her first. Not that she would have been capable of saying no, but the principle of it had Mother honestly enraged.
,,...well, then. I have to go now. I will see you in class later“ Draco continued to look after him, wondering why the Professor had seemed to have taken his side. Maybe he didn’t knew who he was? Who was he kidding, everyone knew him. The daily prophet made sure of that.
,,I was just...eh...stargazing“ he said, proud of his fast lie, which earned him a light chuckle from Malfoy, who happened to find his lie a little dull ,,Ahh, right“ Professor Crowly said, very aware of the fact that not one single star was seen on the sky but decided to pretend he bought the lie ,,And you, Mr. Malfoy? I do not believe you have been stargazing together, right?“ ,,Never“ he said as if it was a crime to even think about him, doing anything with Potter that didn’t include a fight ,,I just wandered around a bit“ he said shrugging his shoulders and Professor Crowly sighed, clearly knowing that both of them were lying ,,Well, the circumstances as to why the two of you are wandering around the castle at night and on top of that, a place that had been locked from the teachers, do not change the break of rules. I will discuss this matter with Professor McGonagall tomorrow and will let you know, what the consequences will be. You may go to your bed now“ he paused for a moment before continuing ,,and I do suggest not taking any detours and head straight to your common rooms“ ,,Of course, Sir“ Harry said, walking past Malfoy and Crowly, fleeing the scene as fast as he could. Professor Crowly looked after Draco until he disappeared out of his sight and made his way back to inform Professor Flitwick about his discovery.
,,What’s that about?“ he asked, gesturing towards Daphne and Astoria sighed ,,That?...let’s just say, my sister hasn’t changed at all“ ,,Huh?“ ,,well...the war-“ she began and for the first time the confidence in her voice wasn’t as strong. Was she scared to talk about it in front of him? ,,-I mean, it didn’t change her“ she cleared her throat uncomfortably and loaded her plate with potatoes and vegetables, not forgetting to put a few onto Draco’s plate too ,,At least, not like it changed me“ ,,And that would be?“ Draco said, raising an eyebrow ,,I just realized that things I had believed to be important, weren’t as important as I thought“ she was talking so cryptic and it was slowly getting on his nerves but he didn’t wanted to come across as too curious, so he just let the conversation die and concentrated on the food, she had placed on his plate. They didn’t talked until they had finished dinner but Draco was fine with it, he liked the company anyway and when they went back together to the dungeons, he did feel like this might be not as bad as he thought. She seemed to be genuinely interested in talking to him, even though it was hard for him to believe that she did not had any ulterior motives.
,,This little bastard“ he murmured to himself. He needed to vent his anger or he felt like he would explode. He couldn’t believe that the power his name had hold all his life had vanished to a point where even a lousy house-elf dared to insult him. He felt the embarrassment creeping in his anger, embarrassment of the fact that his most hated person had witnessed just how deep he had sunken. Not capable of getting himself to cool off, he used his wand to just let everything around him clash with the magic of his wand, cracking trees and almost disrooting one or two. He left he chaos he had caused behind him as Hagrid’s hut came into sight and just continued storming towards the castle.
Wondering about what he was supposed to be doing after class for the next two weeks, he said down on the Slytherin table and filled his plate with a variety of eggs, toast and vegetables. He just hoped he wouldn’t be doing the work with the scarhead together. He was surprised when he felt someone taking the seat beside him, considering that there were many more seats free and he wasn’t much liked by anyone here but as he turned his head and saw the cocky girl, that had saved him two nights in a row, he rolled his eyes ,,What do you want?“ he asked, feeling not really hungry anymore ,,Nothing“ she said and filled her plate, until there was almost no space left ,,I’m so freaking hungry. Skipped dinner yesterday. Big mistake“ she said, not caring about the lack of grace of talking while she was already stuffing the food into her mouth. Draco sighed and took a big sip from his glass
After some time, the school finally came to sight and he was more than happy to not have encountered any creatures that lived inside the forest. Now that the light’s from the castle lightened the area, he could see the face of the girl more clearly. She had long brown hair, that was tied into a loose ponytail and she had quite surprisingly pretty sharp features. The look on her face unreadable but it made him just even more curious about her
I also wanted to stay true to the events of the book and change as little as I can to match my story but the fate of Draco's parents was just something I had to change because it was so unrealistic that they were freed from any punishments just because they had decided last second to kinda change sides. They participated willingly in the first and second war and probably killed a dozen innocent people without any remorse. As much as it hurt me to make Draco lose them so sudden, I just had to do it.
As he looked around, he realized that the class had become a lot smaller than before but he didn’t expect anything else. A lot of Students never came back to Hogwarts, either because their parents did not want their kids to go to a school that claimed to be safe but never really had been or because they couldn’t go back to the place where they had witnessed their friends die and feared for their own life’s. The teachers also seemed unsure how to handle the situation. They doubted that there was even a right way because the kids had witnessed things no one was ever old enough for. While Draco was trying his best to stay focused and listen to the voice of Slughorn, who was telling them about a potion used for mind reading, his efforts were in vain as he felt himself slipping back in forth between memories and the present
,,You guys are so ridiculous“ said Daphne as they were sneaking through the empty corridors, with only their wands bringing a little light into the pitch dark night.
The looks they gave him went from surprise to disgust, to hate. He was sure he heard one girl whispering how he could dare to come back after all he had done and just like he learned growing up, he held his head high and went through the crowd, radiating a cold elegance as if he was untouchable. When he found an compartment that was empty, he sighed relieved and put the black bag, he hold onto as his luggage was being stored somewhere else, beside him. Nimensi, his black cat took her rightful place on his lab and enjoyed the sporadic strokes of her owner, who was trying to avoid looking at anyone. Ten minutes later, the train came into movement and slowly left the platform behind them.
,,Why the hell are they giving us always tasks like that?“ Draco couldn’t control his anger anymore and felt the urge to throw or kick anything but there was nothing around them, making him just more furious.
He missed her badly. She was still his mother and even though she had done all those horrible things and had her fair part of raising him into this arrogant, narrow minded bully, who thought that he was the center of the world, she was still the only person who had showed him some sort of love while growing up. She was only sentenced for 4 years because she had played a big role in the defeat of Voldemort, as she betrayed him and kept to herself that Harry was still alive but it did not change the fact, that she was willingly involved in murders, done for Voldemort. Even though they had not participate in the war itself and made a last minute change of sides , his fathers crimes had been too many and too ruthless to be ignored.
,,You know what Malfoy, I am really not in the mood for your daily dosage of bullying. I’ll leave“ before Draco could say any more, Harry had already turned around and left him without another word. He knew he should be thankful that Harry had spoken out for him after all he had done, he knew he probably would’ve never done the same for him, but he just couldn’t stop the hatred that was pulsing through his veins for that boy. He  first hated him because he declined his offer of friendship and took all the attention, Draco had expected to be on him but the hate was nothing more than superficial but the older he grew, the more the hate spread like venom. Harry was the reason all of this happened. Harry had teared his family apart, long before his father was sent to Azkaban because of him. His father always hated it when Potter was better at something than his own son and he didn’t shy away from showing the disappointment upon his sons failure’s. Draco would never be enough, that was something he realized when his father came back from Azkaban and still looked at him as if he was a little boy that needed supervision to stop him from straying from the path. His dad had given him everything to make him the best and still, there was always someone who was better than him. Draco really wondered if one day, he might be freed from the curse that was the existence of Harry Potter. That boy reminded him of everything he never had.
Most would probably think bad of him because he missed him but they just couldn't understand that they were still his parents and even though his father never left out a chance to bully him and forced him into a life that he later on realized he never wanted, he was still the one who bought the whole Slytherin team the newest broomsticks because he begged him to and the one who made sure that if anyone were to hurt his son, they would get their deserved punishment. Now that everyone was gone, he looked so ridiculous sitting on this big table, all alone.
Draco himself had to face a trial as it did not matter that he was a child when he received the dark mark. The only thing that saved him, as ironically as it is, is the trio he learned to hate with all his guts. Only because he saved Harry's life, when he didn't reveal his identity and did not participate in the battle, he was spared from Azkaban. He still remembered the Weasly's face when Harry spoke out for him. Ron hated him with all his might and honestly, Draco couldn't blame him. He might have not raised the wand and spoke the unforgivable curse that killed Fred Weasly but he knew that it was just as much his fault.
The bell rang, marking the end of the class and Draco was the first to practically run out of the small room. He was trying his best to stay collected, trying his best to even his breath and stop the storm that wanted to break loose inside him. Only when he finally found the nearest bathroom, he let his bag fall down to the ground with a thud and hurried inside one of the stalls, his breakfast finding it’s way out through his mouth. He was violently choking as he tried to breath between the urges to puke and the sobs that escaped his body. God, he probably looked so pathetic. A painful pitiful laugh escaped his mouth that even in this situation, all he was thinking about was how weak he is, which was interrupted by another wave of nausea. He didn’t knew how long he had been just sitting on the cold floor, crying like a little kid, with his arms around his knees but as he had already needed to cover his mouth with his hands a few times, to silence his sobs because someone came into the bathroom, he guessed that quite a lot of time had already passed.
So, this is a Drarry story as the tags have probably already said and it's gonna be a story that goes on quite slowly. I want to make the change between Harry and Draco realistic and therefore it's gonna take some time until the two will actually come close to being friends, so it will be one of this slow burn stories. If you are still up for it, then I hope you will enjoy this chapter and make you want to read more. I will try to set a date for an update every week in the coming days. This story contains some heavy subject's, so if you are sensitive for that please do not read it. Well, I don't wanna talk (write) too much, so I'm just gonna stop here and wish you have a good time with the first Chapter of hopefully many more ^-^
Some of the shelves had been knocked over and it’s whole content, which were at least a few hundreds books, had been tossed to the ground recklessly. Flinch had given them a list with the way to stack the books and they both had silently agreed to start at each different ending, to stay away from the other as far as possible. The afternoon went by slow, much too Draco’s distaste and when it was time for dinner, they were finally freed for the rest of the day but his mood didn’t improved as he saw the small progress they had made in this hours, which meant they were gonna have to spent a lot more time together in that tiny space. Draco was about to head back to his room, not really feeling much hungry, when someone grabbed his hand.
He couldn’t breath anymore. His throat was closing and he fell onto the ground, trying to hold himself up with his shaking arms. The tears spilled out of his eyes, dropping down onto the clean bathroom ground. He desperately tried to get himself under control but he still heard those screams in his head. In that moment he realized just how much he hated himself. He was never able to stand up against the paralyzing fear inside him. He had seen and done so many things because of it and still he couldn’t fight it. He was a coward and there was nothing he could say to prove himself otherwise. And in that moment he realized just why he hated Harry Potter, the one who was ready to sacrifice himself for all the good causes, so much. Harry Potter was all he never was and never will be. A constant reminder of his own cowardness.
,,I just wanted you to know that I’m not angry at you“ ,,I didn’t thought you were“ why couldn’t he ever be honest? ,,Oh okay, well that’s good then I guess“ he nod lightly, making her feel a bit embarrassed for believing that he would care enough about her to worry about her feelings ,,I’ll get going t-“ ,,Do you want to take a walk?“ Draco had blurred out, surprising not only her but himself too but he had no time to regret it as a big smile spread over her lips and she nod, a little life coming back into her beautiful eyes.
When they finally found their way out of the castle, they hurried down the mountain, trying to keep Blaise’s pace who looked as if he was ready to do whatever it takes to make Draco pay for turning his back on them. As the Quidditch field came into view, a lonely figure was already there, leaning against the outside walls with a bored expression on his face. An act, to let everyone think that he didn’t felt nervous. ,,I really wasn’t sure if you would really come“ Draco called from distance and started grinning as Blaise got closer and he saw the anger in his eyes. As he looked around he saw that quite a lot of people had decided to watch their fight, seeing faces of all houses.
,,Draco?“ the voice sounded oddly human and soon behind the light appeared the outlines of a human body that soon turned into the silhouette of a girl that looked a little familiar but it was too dark to make out her features clearly ,,Who the hell are you?“ he spatted angry and dusted the dirt of his black silk pajamas that costed more than most wardrobes of the other students. Her distinctive green eyes bore into his own cold gray ones and she sighed heavily, contemplating whether she should just turn around and leave him behind.
,,Draco“ the voice of his mother ripped through the tension, her voice calm and steady. She knew what would await her son if he wasn’t going to follow the orders of the man, who had no ounce of compassion in his cold, black heart ,,Do it or feel my wrath yourself“ his voice still as calm and collected but when his voice suddenly screamed ’Do it‘, loud enough to be heard in the far distance Draco had broken under the pressure and fear and spoke  the Cruciatus curse and Rowle’s scream echoed through the halls of the manor.
Which had been nothing more than a guess was confirmed, next morning when Flinch had told him that McGonagall wanted to see him before class started. It was weird that know the gargoyle statue was the gate to the office of McGonagall and even though Draco had only been inside the office twice in Professor Dumbledore’s years, he recognized just how much it has changed. It was more empty, less colorful. A lot of the interesting little things that had danced, flown and jumped through the room were now covered in light dust and stuffed inside the shelf's as if the magic had died with the owner. A big empty gold-brown frame covered almost the whole wall behind the desk and Draco felt a tightening know inside his stomach, knowing who that frame belonged to.
,,Come closer, son, come closer“ Draco stood frozen on his spot, his body just didn’t wanted to move and only did when his mother squeezed his hand tight.
Draco scoffed lightly and threw his wand on his bed, turning his back to Blaise ,,You know Blaise, you shouldn't forget I'm still a Malfoy. That name might have not as much power as it had before but believe me-" he turned around and a dangerous spark inside his eyes, made Blaise tense more ,,I will let you know just how much it still has left" Draco looked at his left arm, making Blaise remember what was hiding beneath his school uniform.
It was in the middle of the night when Draco awoke. He used his right arm to steady himself and scanned the room with sleepy eyes. He found noises outside his room to be the reason why he woke up and groaned annoyed. He had been finally having a good sleep for the first time in a while. He had just turned around, ready to go back to sleep, when he noticed through the moonlight that fell into the room, that the bed beside him was empty. A weird tingling feeling made it’s place in his stomach and the noises outside died down and it went silent. Before he could even get up from the bed, the door flew open and suddenly he felt his head being covered by something. He heard someone mutter a spell and seconds later he suddenly couldn’t move his body anymore. Overwhelmed with what was happening, he tried to shout but the material that was covering his face seemed to have been hexed as well, as he couldn’t make any sound at all. Suddenly, he felt his legs moving and got up from the bed and without his shoes on, he was being forced down the stairs until cold stone ground was replaced by wet earth and grass. He had no control over his body anymore. His heart was beating so fast and even though he knew it were only his classmates, he still couldn’t shake this little fear inside him that Voldemort was back and ready to kill him or worse, for betraying him. He tried to calm himself down, while he was being pushed forwards. No sound broke through the curse and it was all the more frightening because he felt himself stumbling a few times over hard objects, he couldn't identify and felt something thin, slapping against the bag, that covered his head. He didn’t knew how long they had been walking but out of the blue, his body came to an stop, almost making him fall down if the curse wouldn't have hold him up.
her words echoed in his hand and as he had almost convinced himself to take a step towards her, she looked up. Her green eyes that had been so lively the first time he had seen her, looked tired and sad, blending perfectly into the misty weather and he felt guilt crashing onto him. Why did he always had to be at fault for the misery of others? Convinced that she would’ve rather talk to the dark lord than him, he turned away, not knowing that she had hoped so much for him to dare to walk up to her but he had chosen the familiar feeling of loneliness. He had almost the reached the common room when he heard someone calling his name and when he turned around, Astoria was running up to him. She smiled at him but it was different from the ones he knew. This one wasn’t as sincere.
Around 6 he was back at the house and the house-elf's had already awoken and were preparing a preposterous big breakfast for one person, from which Draco would never be able to finish more than a quarter. Now that going to Hogwarts was only a few days away, time seemed to pass so fast and he felt himself getting more anxious everyday. The last time he had seen the castle it laid in ruins, with hundreds of students that looked like their souls have been personally sucked out by the dementors. He didn't doubt that the castle probably looked like nothing ever happened to it, those scars were erasable but what about the students, the teachers? Would everything feel the same or was the damage the war caused, still as visible as ever? Draco really wasn't sure if it wasn't too selfish to go back. Would he be a constant reminder for others off the horror they had to witness? His mother told him to only think about himself while she is away, she said not to care about what others think and do what's best for him but he wasn't so sure if she was right. The selfishness of only thinking about himself had been one of the reasons he was now all alone.
The wizarding world had been in chaos since then. The whole ministry had to go through trials and they were still ongoing and the whole system had been questioned as it was way too easy for Voldemort to get the ministry under his control. Draco doesn't know much about the whole chaos as he tried to not read the newspaper too much because it was a constant reminder of his past doings.
An hour later, he found himself entering the great hall with his Hogwarts uniform and if the looks hadn't been already bad, they were now. Everyone was looking at him, whispering and showing him openly how they felt about his comeback. On the Gryffindor table, he saw a particular red hair who looked like he was going to explode any minute, only being hold back by the skinny girl beside him that was Hermione. To his luck, no one seemed to dare more with the teachers, seated on their table on the other end of the room. ,,So he really is back" ,,He doesn't know decency" ,,I don't know if he is brave or a fool" ,,Brave? He's a despicable coward" He calmed himself down and shut out the hateful words surrounding him. He walked towards the slytherin table with a confidence, that it only took a second for a pair of students to make space for him. He felt anxious but made sure that no soul would ever be able to see through his facade of arrogance. He had every right to be here and he couldn't give a damn about their insignificant opinions, he told himself until he believed his own words.
Pansy had often laughed about their stories but she never participated much in them, she found her liking mostly in bullying the weaker ones. Suddenly the door opened and Blaise came into the room, his look cold and headed to his bed, where his suitcase was still lying untouched. Draco took his biggest one himself and threw it onto his bed, casting a spell over it so that the clothes inside slowly flew through the air into the closet and drawer. He felt a cold stare in his back but pretended to not notice it and keep to himself
He followed his mother downstairs and was surprised to see the amount of death eaters who had gathered. Even though they were on the same side, Draco felt the need to make sure his wand was close enough but he doubted that he would ever find the guts in him to try to fight one of the dark figures that filled the big dinning room. He felt more like running away. He always had. Suddenly everything went quiet, when a loud bang was heard from downstairs and a group of snatchers came into view. The one who stood at the front had a big scar, covering the place where his right eye should be and he licked his lips in a anticipating way, his greasy hair falling into his face
,,Oh hey Dra-“ Astoria cut herself off when Draco walked past her, not giving her one glance. Unfazed by his lack of manner, she ran after him, adapting to his pace ,,Wow, what happened to get you so worked up?“ ,,Leave me alone!“ he said, slightly feeling calmer than before ,,Must be pretty serious, huh?“ ,,What do you want?“ ,,You telling me what’s wrong“ ,,Nothing is wrong!“ ,,Yeah, clearly. That’s why you look like you would murder the next person that get’s on your nerves“ ,,Then why are your talking to me?“ ,,Because you would never win against me“ she said, grinning brightly and he stopped walking abruptly, making her adapt to his sudden stop and stared at her. He really wondered what she was thinking
I'm sorry for updating a day too late. The Chapter was already finished but I was so busy and came home very late and went right to bed and totally forget it. Anyway, here is the third Chapter and I hope you like it ^w^ ♥
When the boys had found themselves, done with their task and full of joy, they had almost smiled at each other but stopped when they realized who they were. It had taken them about four days and a lot of sore pain in their arms and they just hoped that whatever Professor Crowly would give them as the next punishment was something that didn’t include a lot of arm work and was hopefully not as dull as sorting books after theme’s and the alphabet.
,,Why I'm back? Since when is it your business what I do or why I do it?" ,,You aren't untouchable anymore Draco" Draco could tell just by how Blaise dared to call him by his first name ,,You daddy is rotting away in Azkaban and last year, you showed us all just how much of a coward you really are" he took a dangerous step closer and Draco tighten his grip around his wand behind his back ,,I don't wanna share a room with a pathetic loser like you but sadly McGonagall doesn't care that much, so I give you two options. You stay out of my sight and if I'm inside the room, you leave until I leave again or fall asleep or you will get a taste of your own medicine" of course Draco knew what he meant by that and he wondered who would help Zabini to get back at him. Draco knew there was quite a long list.
,,Why are you doing this? All of this, huh? I mean, trying to talk to me, even though I am clearly showing you that I don’t want to, getting into a fight with your sister because of me, saving me two nights in a row. What the hell do you really want from me? Just god damn say it!“ an unreadable expression took place on her face and she shook her head lightly ,,Is it so unthinkable that I just want to be your friend?“ ,,Yes! Because I’ve been doing nothing but treating you like shit“ ,,You are right about that. But I know it’s not that easy!“ her voice was strong, confident with no sign of backing down ,,I’m not living any longer inside this...this bubble“ she said, having difficulties finding the right words to get her message across ,,that my parents created and made me live in! I know, people don’t....understand us“ ,,Us?“ ,,Yeah, the way we were raised. Our parents told us that blood purity is superior and that nothing matters more but-“ she tried to calm herself down but failed miserably. All those different emotions were a lot ,,-I’ve seen people, my friends die because of that stupid reason! They had life’s to live, futures that waited for them but it was all taken away from them“ she whipped her tears away furiously and continued ,,People judge us, they will forever. For the once we are horrible people, who will be forever living in their sins and for the others we will be forever blood traitors, unworthy of our pure blood. I know that....that you are lonely“ she expected Draco to snap, get angry again and tell her that it’s ridiculous but he just looked at her, his face void of expression as if wasn’t sure how to feel about her words ,,And I know you are trying and I am trying too....I...I just wanted us both to feel less lonely, is that so wrong?“ he made no move to say a word or give her any kind of reaction, so she just sighed tiredly and walked passed him, her small figure disappearing into the dungeons.
,,Just don’t....think about it“ Draco said, scratching his neck in awkwardness. He never needed to calm someone down so he really had no clue what he was supposed to say to the boy, who had been sitting motionless on the ground for the past 15 minutes ,,Yeah because it’s so easy to not think about the fact that we are in a cave, who god knows how deep into the ground, with no way out“ at least he could still be a little spiteful ,,Just...I don’t know...think about, eh, Professor Flitwick“ Draco said helpless and Harry gave him an questioning look ,,What? That guy is a dwarf. Just his- “ ,,He is half-goblin!“ Harry interrupted him ,,You seriously are a dick“ ,,And there he is, Saint Potter, protector of all“ ,,I’m just not a racist, like you!“ ,,I’m not a-“ Draco stopped in mid sentence and turned away from Harry, groaning in frustration ,,I’m not a racist“ his voice was barely audible but Harry had heard him and scoffed ,,Yeah, not that you called my best friend a mudblood for years and treated everyone who who wasn’t a pure blood or a racist, like dirt“ ,,This, this is what I mean“ Draco said, turning back to Harry and looked right into his emerald green eyes ,,You are always so full of yourself. Harry Potter, the moral apostle, who would never do something unrighteous“ ,,What’s so wrong about that?! You just hate it because you don’t want to see that you are nothing more than a dick, who spent his whole life hiding behind mommy and daddy and cowardly only cared about himself!“ a dangerous silent filled the room and for a moment Harry was convinced Draco was going to kill him right at the spot but before said person could even mutter a word, the earth behind him began to vibrate and he jumped away from the hole. Seconds later, the snout of a Niffler peaked out, soon followed by the rest of it’s body. He had restored the path, albeit it didn’t look very steady, and had a little note on his back, which Harry immediately grabbed ,,It’s Hagrid. He said, it was a elf and that he caught it and that the Niffler has something inside his pouch to get us out“ Harry conveyed Hagrid’s message and Draco grabbed the Niffler, the disgust shown in his face as he grabbed inside it’s porch. The creature definitely not happy with that bit into Draco’s finger, making him pull away his arm forcefully ,,You little“ he said, ready to take his wand but was stopped when Harry walked towards him and smiled friendly at the animal ,,You got something for us, right? Can you show us, please?“ that little animal tilted it’s head a bit and gave a small nod. Draco let the creature free itself from his grip and land clumsy on the ground.
If he remembered correctly he had potion class now with professor Slughorn who was known for having a dislike towards students who have a lack of punctuality and even though everyone had already found out by yesterday that he was back, the eyes were still on him when he entered the room. He made his way towards one of the empty spots and gave everybody a cold look, who was thinking about saying anything towards him. Much to his own dislike, he saw the two familiar faces of Harry Potter and Hermione Granger on the other side of the room. While Hermione had stolen a few glances at him, Harry hadn’t shown any kind of interest in his arrival and Draco surely had no problem with that. He just wanted to forget that face that had been the reason his whole life turned out like this.
,,I want you, to make him feel what it’s like to betray me“ he eyed the dark lord for a second before turning his attention back on Thorfinn. He wanted to speak but he didn’t trust his voice to sound steady at all, so he just silently prayed for someone to come into the room right now and interrupt this scene that he knew, was going to haunt him forever. ,,Don’t be shy, he has done the same plenty and he showed just as much mercy as he did when he killed those little kids“ Draco tighten his grip around his wand but his hand wouldn’t obey when he tried to lift his right arm. He couldn’t do it and he knew that.
Who or whatever it was, that scrapped off the scales of the unconscious mermaids, had done it at least a dozen times and it seemed so brutal, Harry felt sick. Draco looked at the others sorrow filled face, wondering what his own expression looked like. Harry inspected the cave and two minutes into it, in between the scales he found a unusual amount of seeds and dead bugs. ,,Looks like a storage of food, which means-“ ,,someone is living in this hole, smart guess“ Draco interrupted him with a sarcastic tone and rolled his eyes. After Draco found a few pieces of black fur, he chuckled at the fear they had felt upon what could be living here ,,Niffler“ he said and Harry turned to him ,,What?“ ,,It’s the cave of a Niffler“ ,,Niffler?“ ,,Are you ever paying attention in class? Niffler, black fur, long snout, love shiny objects?“ ,,...but they are harmless“ Harry said after he remembered the class of Professor Kettleburn in third year ,,They would rather be eaten by the mermaids....unless-“ ,,-there is someone giving it to him“ Draco finished his sentence and Harry nod ,,Yeah, but who or better what?“
The day went by quickly and soon he found himself, inside Professor Crowly’s office with Potter right beside him.
His self-loathing was interrupted when Myrte suddenly came flying into the room, as she had heard familiar sobs echoing in the pipes ,,Oh, Oh Draco“ she spoke out, startling the crying mess of a boy who looked at her through a blurry visions ,,You are crying again“ it already took everything inside him to not choke on his sobs, so he didn’t even try to talk and just buried his face into his hands, trying to get himself to calm down but to no use. The screaming just wouldn’t stop. Myrtle put her hand onto his shoulder even though she couldn’t really touch him and he couldn’t feel it, she hoped the boy, she had seen crying so many times would feel at least a little comforted at the fact that he was not completely alone. It took a whole hour until Draco had finally calmed down to a level where only sporadic sobs shook through his body. ,,I’m such a disgrace to my name“ he whispered hoarse to himself and Myrtle shook her head ,,You are not. Others just don’t understand people like us“ he shook his head that had long ago found a comfortable spot between his angled legs, hiding his face from everything and everyone ,,I am. I am....so weak“ the disgust in his voice was so audible that Myrtle felt her own dead heart aching for the boy in front of her ,,My father...he would be so disappointed, if he could see me right now. He was right all along“ he tighten his grip around his knees and had to calm himself down before he would start crying again ,,I will never be strong enough without him“ ,,That’s not true“ ,,No? Look around, Myrtle“ he said, his voice full of hatred as he lifted his head and gestured towards the empty bathroom ,,I am sitting in a bathroom, crying like a pathetic little kid and no one outside this four walls cares about me or my name or who I am. They talk behind my back and dare to insult me head on. Two years ago, they would’ve gladly accept it if I told them to jump from the astronomy tower“ he exaggerated to get his point across and let his head fall against the white marble wall. His father had told him that as long as he carries the name Malfoy, he will get everything he wants and that there is nothing better than fear to make the people around you respect you and Draco had taken his fathers words to heart but now that he no longer had his father around him, he realized just how small he really is, how  powerless and he hated it, so much.
A sudden clear of throat startled the blonde and his head snapped back up, his eyes lingering on a shadow, too far away to recognize who it was but he didn’t need to. The voice that filled the silent a moment later made it pretty clear who it was ,,I don’t mean to pry but are you okay?“ at the worry in his voice and the absence of annoyance, Draco was convinced that Harry had not recognized him. He slowly lifted his body from the ground, feeling slightly embarrassed and stormed into the direction of the door but before he could reach it, the door was being opened from the inside and just a second later, Draco squeezed his eyes shut at the bright light of Professor Crowly’s Lumos.
,,What’s your next class? Mine is history of magic with Professor Binns. Really don’t like that guy much“ Draco just shrugged his shoulders and continued starring mindlessly at the Hufflepuff flag in front of him ,,You really aren’t one of many words, huh. Remember your old-self being quite a talker“ she restrained herself from calling him a phony show-off and decided to pretend to not notice the hateful glare she was getting from him ,,You know Malfoy, you aren’t making it exactly easy for people to like and understand you“ ,,Well, I don’t give a damn about what other people think!“ ,,oh, yeah?“ she said raising an eyebrow, not even convinced slightly. Just because he had never taken notice of her, didn’t meant that she didn’t had of him and from her observing there were quite a few things she could say that would most likely refute his statement of not caring about other people’s opinions.
Still a little hazy from the pictures he had been seeing just a few minutes ago, Draco got out of his black king sized bed and his bare feet met the cold ground beneath but it didn't bother him at all. It helped him relax and remembered him that the nightmare he had was now, just a memory of the past. It was to no surprise that his bedroom had the size of a dinning hall. The ceiling was high up and the walls were painted in a light brown, with a flag of Slytherin covering almost a whole wall. A big window hid beneath the black curtains, that allowed you to gaze over the whole property of the Malfoy Manor, including the garden that used to be the pride of the Manor and had the size of the great hall of Hogwarts. His room was extravagant with mostly dark furniture, just as you would expect from a Malfoy. Every item in this room probably cost more than one would ever be able to see from the first view. They were nothing special to Draco as he had been used to nothing less than the best his whole life.
Before I reveal too much, I’m gonna stop now haha (I already said too much XD). I do hope you liked this Chapter and  I guess I will try to update one Chapter every week, so tuned :)
,,Well at least, this coward saved your life when you did nothing but let yourself be caged by that squib" Pansy looked as if she was ready to tear his face off but was stopped when Blaise put his hand on her shoulder and gestured for her to go back to their compartment. The way she reacted to the touch, showed him pretty much that the two were dating now. Blaise gave him one last look before he disappeared with Pansy out of Dracos sight, who let his head fall against the wall. If this is how the next year was going to be, he really wasn't sure if he didn't preferred to be back in the lonely walls of his home.
,,Only if you calm down! We still need that guy“ Hagrid who had been silently watching the scene, positioned himself beside Harry and nod ,,I am your teacher. I will handle this situation!“ ,,I swear if you-“ ,,Should I deduct points for Slytherin?“ Hagrid said in a serious tone and after a few seconds, Draco walked towards Harry furious, snatched his wand ,,If you dare to tell anyone about this, I’m gonna make you pay!“ and with that said, he stormed off without giving another glance to any of them.
,,Can I ask you a question?“ Draco asked after they had walked in silence for the past 5 minutes and she nod, grateful that he was the one who broke the silence ,,Why did you approach me? I know, you said it yesterday....but what made you think that I’m different?....that I’ve changed?“ her answer came faster that he had expected ,,Because my sister had to stay in the hospital wing“ he looked confused at her and she only chuckled lightly. She put her hands into her pocked and breathed in the fresh air of the early evening, taking in the view from the top of the hill. From far away the forbidden forest looked so calm, no hint of the danger that lived inside it ,,My sister, she got hurt very badly in the battle. She got slammed into a wall and broke her shoulder and wrist and fractured her right ankle, so she had to stay at the hospital wing for a few weeks. I saw you“ she turned to look at him for a second with a gentle smile on her lips ,,Ms. Pomfrey had said that visitor’s weren’t allowed at night, so every night I slept in front of the hospital wing. I was afraid that something was going to happen to her and I wouldn’t be there to protect her, so I would take a peak once in a while and that’s when I saw the shadow of a boy. He looked so....“ the eyes she had seen in those nights had been filled with so much grief that she wondered how he was keeping himself together ,,I know you stayed there for the same reason I did“ his lips were pressed into a thin line and his eyes seemed to remember the nights, he had spent inside this hospital wing. He had wanted to apologize to them so many times but never could find the courage. She could see the shift in his expression, how he seemed to push those memories away and the lethargic look, she was used to see on him returned but she decided to keep silent. He was like a wounded wolf, one wrong move and he would bite at the hand that was only trying to help. They sat down on a bench, near the Quidditch field that allowed them to gaze over the valley that was lying beneath them and hear the bells of the church in Hogsmead in the distance.
,,Fuck“ he murmured to himself and felt himself panicking. His own source of magic was the only thing he possessed to protect himself from whatever it was that was making his way towards himself but he wondered if he even had a chance. Fear was trying to paralyze him as the light became bigger and the rustle of footsteps, breaking sticks carelessly, closer.
,,Sorry, this happened. I tried to talk them out of it but you know how Blaise is“ Draco scoffed. He had expected no one else to be the one who initiated the plan ,,They are gonna regret this“ Draco brought out between clenched teeth and the girl gave him a wary look ,,Not that you don’t deserve it“ Draco snapped his head into her directions but she did not care at all about the angry glare she was receiving ,,Everyone was more than ready to help Blaise out“ she continued walking in silence after, only now and then turning to the boy beside her to look if he was still there. Draco didn’t really knew how he felt. Some part of him had expected worse. This was just a childish try to bully him, just the same typical things they had done two years ago together. He guessed there were quite a few people who would actually like to really hurt him and maybe even kill him and who was he to say, he didn't deserve it but he surely would not let Blaise be the one to taunt him. Blaise wasn’t hating him for letting the death eaters inside he hated him because he had always wanted the Throne that Draco had taken as his own, the first year he arrived.
,,You can stay here, if you want“ without much hesitation, Harry took a sip from the potion and handed it over to Draco, who eyed the potion wary before doing the same. In a matter of a few seconds, they both felt their legs getting wobbly and the cave began to grow bigger, at least it felt like that. They were still quite a lot bigger than the magical creature. Without wasting a second, they made their way towards the hole that looked like it was going to collapse any minute again and crawled through the even more narrow space than before.
noticeably annoyed, Draco had almost started a fight with Filch, who only hold himself back because madam Pince had gave him an rebukingly look. He muttered his usual how he wished to have the old days back where the punishments were still useful and led Draco and Harry away from the eyes of the students, to a corner of the library that hadn’t been used since the war and was in a state of utter chaos. Before Harry could say a word, Filch had snatched his wand and grinned malicious ,,No wands“ he hold his hand out for Draco to give him his wand too, which he did unwillingly  with a wish for Filch to just vanish from everyone’s life. ,,enjoy your afternoon“ he chuckled ugly and left the two boys alone, who had been not very happy about the work but were now even more gloomy because without a wand, this would take days to finish.
weeeeeell :D that’s it for the second Chapter. Hope you liked it ^w^ I know you probably want to see more interaction between Harry and Draco but I warned you that this is gonna be a slow burn story because I want to try to make it as realistic as possible, even tho alone the fact that they develop feelings for each other is already pretty unrealistic haha but I’m trying. Draco and Harry have known each other all their life as nothing more than enemies, so they won’t suddenly like each other in the span of a few days and I’m also concentrating a lot on character development, especially Draco’s as I believe he is a Character that still has a lot to give and show. A potential that J.K Rowling wasted in my opinion.  All his life he had been following what his parents wanted and it’s not easy to free yourself from that, especially if their beliefs and opinions were all you knew and were taught to follow without questioning any of it.
With people like them, things like real friendships didn't exist, it was all just a game at who was better at hiding his weaknesses to get the Slytherin throne. Draco just happened to have always been very good at hiding his feelings and lying to himself but the fact that he was a Malfoy had helped out a lot but now that name was doing him more harm than good and he had to be very carefully because now there was no name to protect him anymore
,,Tonight, let’s meet in front of the Quidditch field“ Draco grinned mischievously because he knew that he had always been better at dueling than Blaise and if he wouldn’t take the offer everyone would believe he was a coward and Draco knew that, using it to his advantage.
,,Didn’t Ron wanted to come too?“ ,,Yeah, when I told him it’s time, he suddenly said he doesn’t want to anymore“ ,,Probably because of Hermione. She said she was not going to watch two idiots fight over some dumb ego problems“ ,,And Harry?“ ,,Don’t know. Probably doesn’t care“ ,,Yeah, understandable“ and again Draco felt the anger inside him raising. Everyone gets that Potter is a hero and has better things to do, they don’t have to rub it under his nose by every freaking opportunity they get.
They walked inside the forbidden forest and soon the sun, was blocked out from the trees and the warmth it brought gone, replaced by a chilly wind. ,,Hagrid, how is Buckbeak doing?“ at the mention of the bird, he looked up from the ground and listened to their conversation ,,He is doing very well but I think he misses you a bit“ ,,I’ll promise to visit him soon“ ,,I think he would love that“ Hagrid eyed Draco, who immediately looked away as if he didn’t cared at all about what they were talking. Draco always knew that it’s been them, who helped that Hippogriff escape but he never got the chance to prove it but now, he really didn’t care anymore what happened to that beast that had attacked him a long time ago. Somehow he was glad, that they hadn’t succeed in executing that animal. At least one death less that he wouldn’t need to walk around with. He pushed his thoughts aside and concentrated on kicking the stones and sticks away, that crossed his way, now and then listening to the conversation between the two unusual pair of friends. Soon, between the dirt and leaves on the ground Draco began to see the shimmering scales, that Hagrid had talked about. In the sea, they were hideous creatures who didn’t come close to ever being viewed as beautiful but this triangle formed scales, that reminded one of painted glass possessed a beauty that not even the darkness of the forest was able to conceal. Unnoticed by the two in front of him, Draco took a big one that had a greenish color to it and put it in his pocket.
The way he had treated the people around him, he could see now just how horrible he had been. He was so afraid of someone thinking of him as weak and leaving him out, that he didn't care about anyone else's feelings and did all he could to protect himself from harm. The voice of his father was still so vivid in his mind, drilling into him that emotions were nothing more than a distraction, a weakness that needed to be overcome and that people needed to fear you because that way, they wouldn't dare to betray you.
,,But I really wish that you will be able to complete your education here, with your friends and everyone else, so if you, well, ever need anyone to talk to, our new teacher in defense against dark arts , Professor Tregolor, has opened his office at any time for students who have the need to talk“ she wore a expression of expectation but Draco only nod awkwardly at the offer and stood up when she didn't continue talking. McGonagall cleared her throat, visible having a hard time showing another side than her strict one ,,You may go back to class now Mr. Malfoy, as you don’t want to be late on your first day“ he gave a half hearted smile and turned around, hurrying out of the room and away from the awkward tension.
suddenly someone grabbed him and Draco’s whole body shook under the touch, throwing himself to the ground to escape the grip ,,Boy, you alright?“ Hagrid had asked worried when the boy hadn’t reacted to his name getting called and seemed to be scared for his life at his hand touching his shoulder ,,Take your filthy hands of mine!“ Draco said spiteful, giving the half giant a look that displayed all the hatred he could find in himself. Not waiting for an response, Draco picked himself up from the ground and hurried away from the scene, leaving the two wizards back in confusion.
It might have been small but a little part inside him, a nagging feeling that he chose to ignore, never felt good with the things that came out of his mouth but he knew hell would’ve more likely froze before he would’ve admitted it at that time. He had been so blinded by his parents belief and he surely had no desire in him to question them. No, he wanted to have an easy life and do what needs to be done to make his parents proud. It was his priority, to please his parents. It would be a lie if he said it wasn’t hard to change and it still is. He had grown used to those beliefs and his parents had made sure that while growing up, he was only surrounded by people who shared that mindset. The realization that he just couldn’t bring himself to kill someone had brought a wave of question and doubts with them, that had been trying to drown him.
Suddenly he was being pushed to the ground and the spell broke.  When he teared the bag from his face, he was met with darkness. No living soul seemed to be out here and for a moment he questioned if he had hallucinated it but it was clear that he didn’t. He couldn’t see anything at all and he didn’t had his wand with him, so he closed his eyes concentrating on the magic inside him that could be used without a wand. It was something that you learned way later in life and not everyone managed to produce the magic so fast but his father had made sure that when Draco came to school, he would already be ahead of everyone else and right now he was thankful for it.
,,DO IT! or it will be you, who takes his place!“ the voice of the man that had been like a plague to his dreams the last two years, followed him through the corridors of the school. It felt like he was right behind him, whispering those words that he had threatened him with on this dreadful day.
I also wanted to say sorry for all my grammar mistakes and for the lack of sentence/word complexity. I'm not a native english speaker, so please don't be too harsh on me haha. But feel free to give me any kind of feedback, I appreciate everything :)
The next days went by in a blur and the boring and lethargic days he got used to, started to brighten up whenever he got the chance to talk to Astoria and made him forget the hours he had to spent with Harry in the afternoon. Their work the last few days consisted mostly of helping Hagrid with various trivial things, as watering the plants in his garden that were fighting the heat and feeding the little monstrous bugs which Hagrid claimed to be his harmless pets. They weren’t big but their bite surely hurt and Draco wish he could’ve just stamped on them as revenge. ,,God, when will this finally be over“ he murmured with a grumpy expression and Harry had to hide a malicious smirk. The bugs had been getting more and more violent whenever Draco was in their sight and Hagrid had said that the bugs have feelings to, so whenever Draco would look at them and push them aside with disgust, they feel it. The truthfulness of his words was yet to be proven but it surely did not took the joy away from seeing the composed bully jump around like a clown when they tried to crawl his leg up and bite him.
Draco knew it would've been better to just pretend to have not changed much and just try to get his position back but after what he had went through, who was popular and who wasn't suddenly seemed so unimportant. How had he been so obsessed with being popular to a point, where he hated everyone who only remotely endangered his position, bullying that person until all they wanted was for Draco to leave them alone. But he never did. If they once had gotten on his bad side, there was no turning back.
,,And I know it was you, who paid that girls hospital bills“ finally he looked up from the ground, a surprised expression lingering ,,Her parents....they were muggles, working jobs that didn’t gave enough to pay for the medicine that was needed. Her mother, she couldn’t eat or sleep properly anymore and she begged madam Pomfrey to let her stay the night. After she had fallen asleep at the bed of her daughter, I saw how you put the gold beside the bed“ he was taken aback by the realization that she had approached him, not out of a mood but because she had thought about it for months. She had seen him, Draco Malfoy who was known for hating mixed bloods of all kinds, save the life of a muggleborn girl.
Draco was definitely surprised to find out that she belonged to one of the sacred 28 families. He knew Daphne had a little sister but never really cared to find out who it was. It would be a lie if he said, he cared for anyone else than himself over the last years
The next days went by fast and Draco found himself getting closer to the train station, that would take him to Hogwarts. The taxi driver, a wizard himself, said nothing but Draco knew he had recognized him by the way he was starring nervously into the back mirror a few times. Who wouldn't recognize them. Photos of him and his relatives had taken the front pages of the daily prophet for a few weeks after the war and his distinctive white blond hair wasn't really helping to hide his identity. After a long ride, the black taxi came to an stop, right in front of the big entrance of the train. Of course like always one or two of the muggles would stare at him with distrust looks as he was loaded with quite a lot luggage and a black cat, sitting calmly on top of it all but most were in too much of a hurry to notice the unusual appearance.
Next day, the two soon-to-be 18 found themselves in front of Hagrid’s hut, where the half-giant had been taking care of the slowly growing plants and smiled upon their arrival ,,Well, boys . I heard you two wanted to lend me a helping hand with the little problem I’m currently having inside the forbidden forest“ Draco scoffed. This felt oddly familiar.
,,I’m not really hungry“ ,,But you should eat, you are so skinny!“ ,,I’m not!“ ,,Of course you are, you look like you haven’t been eating properly for months!“ Draco was amazed at just how she seemed to be not even a bit intimidated by him and he didn’t knew how to feel about that. He saw Daphne giving him a hard look as their passed her by and took a seat at the other end of the table. Did Astoria got into a fight with her sister because of him?
,,Come on“ was all she said before turning around, clearly deciding that it would've been a waste of her time if she came for nothing. Not waiting for Draco to follow, she headed back into the direction she came from and he speed up to match her pace, eyeing her from the side. She sure looked familiar but he could not tell what it was or who she reminded him of.
,,We have already met a few times but of course, the great Malfoy does not waste any second on people he can’t win something from“ she sounded a little bit angry about the fact that he did not only didn’t recognize her but never remembered her at all ,,Be careful with your word choice“ he said through gritted teeth and if she wouldn’t have been a girl , he would’ve already put her into her place ,,so what? I’m not afraid of you“ Malfoy closed his eyes for a moment, calming himself down before he would do something he would regret and took a step backwards ,,Just bloody lead the way out!“ he said, not really knowing where she had led them. Once again he followed her out of a forest, this time not thanking her before he stormed away from her when they arrived at the entrance of the castle.
Suddenly, a loud scream, that did not sound human, ripped through the air, startling the two boys who froze. Another scream and Harry freed himself of his paralyze, running towards the direction the scream seemed to come from, while Draco was still standing on his spot. Suddenly he found himself back in his home, with Rowle on the ground in front of him, screaming his lungs out. It took him a second to get himself back into reality but once he did, he started running after Harry. He followed him until they were back at the sea and the scene in front of him was horrifying. The House-elf that had been caught by Hagrid stood above a mermaid, with scales in his hand while the sea creature was bleeding severely from where he had ripped her skin off. Draco couldn’t do anything, frozen from fear and the brutality of the house-elf’s act. ,,You“ Harry’s voice dripped from hatred and the glimmer in his eyes showed just how much he would like to let the elf feel the pain he was inflicting on the poor girl that had been helplessly crying and screaming. The little creature only grinned lightly and with just one hand motion, he apparated, taking the mermaid with him.
He makes his way all the way back to his apartment with his hood still down and the watery winter sunlight lighting his bright hair like a beacon, and nobody says anything to him at all. Once back in his apartment, he draws open the curtain and allows the sun to fall across his bed unimpeded.
Although it’s late, the Muggle street is still terribly busy with their automobiles, the kind that haven’t been charmed to dodge between obstacles nor to have obstacles dodge around them. They make Draco anxious – he’d nearly been hit by them, once, when he’d wandered beyond his lonely little street with its park and corner store. The vehicle had swerved around him at the last moment, and then the driver had leaned out the window and very angrily threatened to shrink him.
“It’s Harry,” Potter laughs, stepping closer. “You were really into that huh? Took you a moment there.”
Draco runs his finger along the top of the book, pursing his lips as he thinks of how to explain what he means. “Our society is entirely built upon the assumption of magic,” he answers eventually. “Think of housing. At minimum, you’d want heating charms for the winter, wards, or even just magical locks. A Squib can’t do any of that. So, they either must rent somewhere that all of this is provided by the landlord, which is at extra cost mind you, or they must pay a third party to provide it for them. Heating charms and wards are not just a one-time thing either – they are a yearly expense at least. And it’s not cheap to have them done well.
Draco bites his lip, rubbing his thumb against the letters on the spine of his book. What could he tell that won’t give too much away? He reckons that there is plenty that Potter doesn’t know about his childhood that would be safe to tell, but all it would take is one detail to slip and this whole thing is blown.
Potter chuckles. “Hermione does most of the work,” he admits. “I’m usually kept pretty busy with the Auror stuff, and I don’t have her patience for research. I’m just a mouthpiece really. People listen to me.” He shrugs, a self-deprecating smile pulling at his lips. Draco snorts. No kidding.
"How about we start with… sitting together at breakfast? Or lunch? You know, casual stuff. More friendship than… you know." He aborted the same 'us' gesture from before. "Or we could just… chat in the corridors, that kind of thing." Draco looked confused for a moment.
“Yes, of course there are. There are lots of different kinds of all magic.” She said. He nodded slowly, trying to think of a way to ask her that wasn’t incredibly obvious.
Hermione nodded her assent. Luna watched Draco with both suspicion and sympathy. Perhaps she, of all people, could understand Draco's relationship with his parents, their roles within that house of horrors.
"Fine." He said, looking up at Harry specifically. "But I need you to promise that the Order will try to help my parents, Potter. Please. My mother cannot be there any longer." He said, the only real colour in his countenance was the pink that rimmed his shining eyes. Harry knew he was powerless to resist this request, so looked at the others for their input.
There are a lot of complex feelings and emotions here and, though I sincerely hope I don't, I am very sorry if this comparison offends anyone. I believe the war in the Potter universe is a directly influenced by WWII and how a powerful political force can specifically target a group of people, and how that affects the children on both sides. Wizards are made up, the victims of the Holocaust are not - this is not meant to trivialise real, horrific events.
do but...nothing else can change.” He said softly, his fingers barely ghosting over the smooth inked drawings on the crisp, though aged, parchment. Harry sighed and leaned over, taking Draco's hand and squeezing it. The blond looked at him, and Harry smiled.
“Let me help you-” he started, but Draco jolted back from the touch like he’d been burned, slapping his hand away savagely. Harry looked at him to find terror in his eyes, and anger and sadness. He didn’t speak, just stared at him, and Harry looked down. “Sorry…I won’t touch you again…” he said softly. He saw Draco’s jaw tighten but he didn’t say anything. He waved his wand over himself.
"I know that, mate, I have eyes." He said, his voice both soft and firm. "Those bastards have completely fucked him up, obviously, but that doesn't absolve him of anything. He's been living their way of thinking since he was born, and he's never once tried to escape or ask for help. He's still one of them, they've just made him their whipping boy. Hermione, you know I'm right." He said, entreatingly. She didn't quite look at him, her brain obviously working away. Harry tried to defend Draco again.
Harry let out a soft hiss at the contact, Draco’s hand was cold against his hot, hard cock. Draco stared at it in fear.
"You little piece of shit, we should have let them keep you-" Ron spat, fighting against Harry's hold, wanting to beat the shit out of Malfoy. The raised voice and sudden movement had Draco back in his defensive position, arms over his head and face, legs protecting his torso. Harry tried to subdue Ron while Hermione and Luna just… watched.
What little colour he usually had was back in his pale face, and his eyes were clearing of the cloudiness caused by such extreme pain. He looked back at Harry, clearly exhausted and afraid. He’d never suspected Potter capable of such anger, now he was scared. Harry felt a pang in his chest. He liked that. The fear in Draco’s eyes as he watched him, like a trapped animal watches its hunter, waiting for a strike, helpless. He didn’t have his wand, and Harry outweighed him easily now, though Draco was slightly taller. He’d never noticed how skinny Malfoy was, scrawny and weak.
“Calm down, Hermione, I’m sure its fine. That prick Blaise was bang out of order, he’s probably just trying to get it sorted so they know the truth.”
He gently moved Draco to lie on his back. He looked down at the boy beneath him, his flushed cheeks and long eyelashes, and realised how fond he was of him. How odd that they used to hate each other… At that moment, he could barely remember why. He just wished their first kiss, every kiss they'd shared since, had been shared when they both wanted to. He couldn't remember that either, their first kiss, it had all been such a blur.
This had Draco sobbing again, loud and unashamed, and the Monster felt it prudent to cast a few advanced concealment and silencing spells in case a stray villager happened to pass by, although it would be fun to frame Crabbe for raping Draco if they were caught…but deciding this was better, the Monster thrust savagely hard inside Draco, pushing him right up against Crabbe so he was practically in his friend’s lap, bound arms wrapped around Crabbe’s neck like they were lovers. Crabbe’s frozen eyes seemed to be staring right at Harry, despite his invisibility.
"Anytime." He said, grinning, and they both chuckled. "Excited about tomorrow?" He asked, always looking up and forward for hope and good things to come. Draco smiled and nodded, glancing around them, then back at Blaise.
"I did what I had to do. What would you do to protect your family, Weasley?" He asked, his own tone almost matching Ron's, almost his old self.
Draco soon fell asleep in Blaise's arms as they snuggled up together, trusting and warm, and Blaise loved him for that, loved him with all his heart.
“S-sorry, I can’t stop-...” Draco tried to say, closing his eyes as tears rolled down his temples. The hand rubbed gently, the constant gentle movement actually serving as a much needed distraction from his racing mind. Blaise waited until his breathing settled before speaking again.
“What? Why?” Ron asked, frowning at her. She rolled her eyes but didn’t elaborate further. Harry wouldn’t tear his eyes from Malfoy’s face, his sunken eyes and hollow cheeks as he forced himself to eat a tiny morsel at a time. His Monster rose with pride inside his chest, as if taking a bow. Harry lowered his head and used his hand to block the Slytherin table from his view, deciding to sit on the other side of the table from now on, as he laboriously ate his own breakfast without choking on it.
"Maybe, maybe not. They've been on their side for too long, they're bloody insidious." He said. "He's a snake, Harry, no matter how caged up and beaten he's been. A starved snake will go to whoever has the food, and still bite them to get it."
Draco was still mercilessly hard, the come glistening on his skin and his lust-clouded eyes making him look beautifully obscene. “Fuck…” Harry muttered again, his glasses steaming up completely so he took them off and dropped them down on the bedside table. Then he leaned over Draco, bracing himself on one hand beside Malfoy’s waist on the mattress while the other positioned his cock at Draco’s entrance. “R-ready…?” he asked, panting, the hot, twitching hole against his tip was very nearly too much for him to handle.
“Harry! Where have you been? You missed dinner – one of the first years accidentally stepped on Mrs Norris’ tail as her and Filch were going up to the teachers’ tables. The stupid cat freaked out and went crazy, and the first year accidentally sent a hex into the ceiling that made it snow some kind of icing sugar all over everyone!” Ron recounted with a laugh, brushing the powdery white residue off his robes. There was some in Hermione’s bushy hair too, which she kept trying to shake out by only ended up choking on the dusty cloud it produced.
The one who had spoken, Anthony, was in front and, when they reached him, he grabbed Draco’s shoulder almost forcefully. Draco wanted very much to slap his hand away. “We haven’t seen you recently, you must need our help by now, right?” he asked, grinning, the others leering at him too. Draco swallowed his gear and tried to speak in his usual, slightly bored tone.
"I… h-hate this…" Draco whispered, teeth chattering and eyes squeezed shut. Harry felt a pang of sympathy. He thought he knew what it was like to have no control after so many years under the Durselys' collective boot, but this was far more than that. This was the autonomy of his own
“N-Not… until… s-someone comes inside me… a f-f…few times…” Draco ground out, every muscle in his body shuddering. Harry swore under his breath, realising how much of a toll this would have on someone. No wonder he usually came here with three or more people… it must be so draining to do this every month, if not more. It also struck Harry how invasive this curse was too; what if Draco wasn’t gay? What if he didn’t enjoy bottoming, or found it painful or, most likely, traumatic? It didn't matter at all, he’d still be forced to go through it, or else go insane with this insatiable need. Harry held Draco tightly, overcome with emotion and adoration for the boy he used to have such hatred for.
“Blaise, don’t be stupid!” Goyle shouted, he and Crabbe just leaving the Great Hall. Blaise ignored him, gripping his wand. He wanted to make Potter suffer, like he’d made Draco suffer for who knows how long. He was just trying to think of the best spell to use, his pounding heart drowning out his thoughts, when a voice boomed around them.
, pioneering, it's going to change the world of Potions. And he left me the privilege to compile and publish it all posthumously for him." He said, smiling, glancing at Blaise, who squeezed him gently. Draco smiled and kissed his cheek. "Blaise is assisting me, of course. There's a lot to go through and he's
"You better be good to him, Potter." Blaise warned, his jaw set. He looked like he wanted to say something else, probably something threatening, but Pansy said they needed to go. She gave Draco a gentle hug too, then led the other three out.
“I accidentally nudged Malfoy and made him drop a jar of truffles, so now we both have to come back at the weekend and take inventory.” He said, lying so they didn’t question why Draco was scared of him. Hermione sighed angrily, shaking her head, Ron rolled his eyes, and the matter was put to rest as just another example of Snape being a twat.
He was ready to confront Potter in the Great Hall, in front of everyone, tell the whole school what their golden child Harry Potter does to people, but he spotted Harry on the staircase going down to the Entrance Hall instead. He was with Weasley and Granger, like it was just a normal day of classes.
Harry watched them moving slickly in and out of Draco’s hole, marvelling distantly at the tightness and heat. It didn’t seem real, it was like a dream…a nightmare… It reminded him vaguely of Nagini attacking Mr Weasley…how Harry had felt her rage, watched the strikes through her eyes, but he was distanced from it all… He tried to stop his hand moving, concentrating with all his might, but nothing happened, like he was completely paralysed, fighting against a barrier he couldn’t see, only feeling it’s strong, cruel presence. Yet someone was using his body, moving his fingers, his hand, without his permission.
“He must have been really ill… I feel sorry for him.” Hermione said, frowning with concern at the hollow shell of their nemesis.
They played one game, Draco slaughtering Harry. Even after years of playing Ron, Harry still wasn't the best chess player. Draco had a cunning, strategic mind and he was ruthless to say the least. Being a prideful person, Harry challenged him to another game and Draco, being an arrogant person, accepted.
“What’s the alternative? They serve a purpose, they’re willing and I’d rather a few hours with them once or twice a month than going completely insane, thank you very much.”
Warning: very hard-core and graphic depictions of sexual assault, rape, sexual torture, violence, dark spells, humiliation, non-con exhibitionism, imprisonment etc. Discretion advised!
Their lips parted, both panting and shaking from their almost simultaneous orgasms. Draco was looking up at him, his vision already a little clearer, a little more of his control back. He let out a couple of breaths, trying to regain some composure, before speaking in a cracked, breathy voice.
Draco nodded, trying to gather his cutlery with fumbling fingers and causing a loud clang that made him want to sink into the floor. Several people looked up or around at him and he didn't know what to do, feeling the overwhelming wave of sensitivity and need crashing over him.
“Shut up, Pansy.” Crabbe said, the Monster irritated by her voice. “Draco knows more about nice stuff.” Pansy scoffed, but when Draco didn’t object the Monster got excited. “I wanna get something today, so I can send it.” Crabbe said, standing up. Draco glared at him.
“Is that from your parents?” Harry asked, knowing the answer as he gestured to it. Draco sighed and nodded.
“Y-yes...” he replied, still shivering from the phantom cold. “It was the same.” He added, knowing Blaise's next question. He slid out of the bed, taking his own wand and going over to a washbasin, and cast ‘aquamenti’. He filling the bowl of his palms with the liquid before splashing the water over his face. Blaise watched him, a luminous figure in the dark room. Draco leaned over the basin, his breathing still too fast, his shoulder blades sticking straight up like knives under his pyjama shirt. He cast a strong heating spell over the water and sank his shaking hands into the almost boiling liquid, hot enough to make his skin prickle with pain, but he just wanted to feel warm again. He didn’t notice Blaise get out of bed, jumping when his voice was suddenly close to him.
“Zabini?” he asked in an even tone, infuriating Blaise further. How can he be so calm and arrogant after hurting Draco so badly, after breaking him?
“Fuck…!” Harry growled, opening his own trousers with fumbling urgency, feeling about to explode himself. Draco was crying, trying to turn onto his side, hiding his face behind shaking hands as he sobbed. Harry grabbed his hands, pulling them away with firm gentleness, and kissed Draco deeply. He felt him buck beneath him, his moan muffled by their lips pressed together. Harry pushed his tongue into his hot, wet mouth, moving his hands down Draco’s quivering sides. Harry knew this must be maddening for Draco, but this was the first time he’d touched anyone so intimately, and the fact it was Draco Malfoy felt incredibly surreal. He wanted to savour it before he woke up.
“What happened?” he asked Blaise quietly, glancing at him. He knew Goyle was fond of Draco, even if he’d never admit it, and Blaise decided he deserved to know.
good at organising." He added, teasingly, making his boyfriend grin and roll his eyes, kissing him back.
“Not to mention starting your NEWTs prep.” George added with a chuckle, to which Hermione nodded gravelly without the slightest trace of humour.
“About 6 o'clock, I believe. Looks it might be a pleasantly balmy Tuesday.” Dumbledore replied, turning slightly to smile at him as they walked. Harry was confused and a little upset about being locked away, being told nothing. Tuesday? Had he really only been in there for two days?  He wanted to know how Draco was, and what was going to happen... He wondered how much the teachers had seen in the Pensive, how much he disgusted them now... Dumbledore was treating him normally enough but the old man had a knack for lying with kindness.
Question for you all: would you prefer very explicit descriptions of the violence, like in Split, or do you prefer this sort of vaguer description?
"From your mother?" He asked softly. Draco nodded, hands trembling slightly as he traced Narcissa's immaculate cursive, and his eyes rose to find another pair of eyes watching him.
“This…thing in me… Every time I saw Draco…it would stir. It woke up when I was angry…when I wanted to hurt Malfoy but…it took over and…and really hurt him…”
"I'm going to ask him. If he regrets what he's done. If he feels any remorse. If his actions were justified." He said, walking deliberately towards the living room. Luna was on unofficial guard duty, sitting on the sofa Harry had vacated, Draco on the other. He was just waking up, sensing something was happening.
Harry’s Monster seemed to grow more excited at the proximity to Draco, and the urge to trap him against Snape’s office door was almost overwhelming. He wondered distantly if Draco was still scared of him, or if he had decided the first attack had only been a one-time thing and Harry had taken steps to control himself better. Maybe he thought he’d imagined what happened in Hogsmeade, like a nightmare. After all, Crabbe didn’t remember anything, and Draco would never tell anyone, he’d probably take it hiss grave. Harry thought about this, strangely placated, while his Monster grew more excited about lulling Draco into a false sense of security, until Snape arrived to let them back in.
“So…so Harry did hurt Draco… Oh…oh my God…” she whispered, slowly sitting down on the sofa with her hand over her mouth. McGonagall looked sympathetic, but Dumbledore and Harry returned before she could offer any consolation. The three of them left quickly, Harry carrying his rucksack over one shoulder, his jaw tight and eyes fixed ahead of him, blatantly avoiding his friends’ eyes. When they were gone, Ron and Hermione sat in silence, completely shocked. After a while, Hermione went up to bed, and Ron forced himself to go up too. The dormitory felt very wrong without Harry…
“Usually?” She shrugged, her eyes lighting up as they always did when she got to explain something complicated.
“No one knows we’re here, not even if they were pissing right next door…” the Monster said, disturbing the settling fog on Harry’s mind, watching his own hand patting the cubicle wall beside Draco’s head. “No one can hear you.”
He walked back and forth for what felt like hours, his heart racing in his ears, when, finally, the same ornate doors appeared in the wall. Harry let out a sigh of relief, and rushed in.
Draco’s mouth made contact the head, a bead of precum sticking to his bottom lip when he instinctively moved away from it. Another harsh tug of hair stopped him, bringing him right back and forcing him to take more of the salty flesh into his mouth. Harry moaned along with his Monster, being a virgin himself, he’d never felt the heat of someone else on his cock. It felt good. He didn’t need the Monster to encourage Draco to use his tongue, knowing that would feel better. The grey eyes flicked up to his face, then back down, and he obeyed.
His past crimes, for now, were shelved for later use. His most recent crimes required reparation, and this was the most mutually beneficial way to do it. They got what they needed from him as an insider, and he was left alive and unharmed. A 'win-win', as the Muggles said. He just needed to agree. If he didn't, they would have a problem.
"I do, though. Or…" he looked right at Hermione, perhaps sensing her want of proof. He swallowed, the words drying on his tongue. "I can show you." He whispered, and suddenly they were plunged into the same darkness Harry experienced last night, thick oily black.
Students were coming up the stairs towards them so McGonagall quickly switched from Order mode to Teacher mode, seamlessly pulling an essay that Harry had actually written from her robes and peered down at it through her glasses.
She was accompanied by Crabbe and Goyle, both of whom were glaring at the boys around Draco. Goyle muttered something to Pansy, who nodded, and he and Crabbe started walking towards them with a very clearly intimidating air.
He sat, pretending to read the book, incidentally a very dull volume on magical property laws in the 18th century, for a while until a bubble of rage had him lobbing the tome across the room, sending up a cloud of dust where it landed, and he began  pacing the room. The carpet was old and not very soft, the walls had ugly green and gold wallpaper that reminded him of Grimmauld Place, but with none of it’s nostalgic, home-like qualities.
Meanwhile, Harry was being swallowed by guilt. Of course he'd seen Draco's reaction to seeing him, and the look of terror on his face where there would have been a smirk and a rude comment thrown his way, almost in greeting. He'd been grateful to Blaise for handling it so well, getting Draco away, and even Pansy hadn't blown up at him like she'd obviously wanted to.
at it, doesn't mean he's innocent." He said, impassioned but not upset, not angry like he was before. He'd got that out and his long walk had helped him sort his chaotic thoughts. Now he was thinking pragmatically, which was not usually his job. He was the impulsive one, the stupid one, the hubristic idiot. Harry and Hermione stood before him in the light drizzle, listening but bashful.
"H-Harry…!" He gasped, his body writhing and bucking. Harry looked into his misty eyes questioningly, waiting for him to tell him to hurry up and fuck him already, get it over with. Instead, Draco forced himself closer to him and raised a shaking hand to cup the side of Harry's neck. "Kiss me…? Like last time?" He whispered, somehow meek. Harry let out a breath he hadn't realised he'd been holding and nodded, wetting his own lips quickly.
Hermione and Ron didn’t go down for breakfast on Sunday morning, too scared of rumours and questions to face the other students. They sat by the fire in silence, each consumed by their own thoughts.
Harry could feel terror in his chest, not his own but projected onto him by this ventriloquistic evocation. Together with Draco, both current and recalled, Harry and Hermione became aware of heavy footsteps approaching from a distance, the sound carrying through the silent house. All four heads turned to where they knew a door stood closed, but not locked.
“He…he’s been attacked…” Pansy said, looking at Draco for leave to tell the truth. He closed his eyes tiredly, and nodded.
“Snape did something...took a white thing from my head.” Crabbe said slowly, turning away from Draco and Blaise. He looked at Pansy because she was in front of him, and she stared back fixedly.
“I-I don’t need your pity… Get out…!” he tried to shout, sound angry, but his voice came out shaky, and weak with pain. His hair fell over his face, but Harry could swear he saw a glistening track slowly making its way down his cheek. His jaw was clenched, shoulder blades stabbing out from beneath his skin as he hunched over, tense.
“No, no, Mrs Weasley, it’s really fine – nothing to do with the food. I’ve just been, I dunno, really stressed lately.”
Also, to those into the Creature!Draco vibe, I'm not sure how far I'll push it but I don't want to make it a big thing, really - much as I love reading them. It might a theme but not a main plot, if you get me.
They were silent for so long he had to look up to check they were still even there. Pansy was staring at him with huge eyes, tears rolling down her cheeks, hands covering her mouth, and Blaise looked the angriest Draco had ever seen him.
“Yes. We are investigating the incidents, and trying to find witnesses.” He looked at the Crabbe, it looked like he was reading a book on his face. Crabbe felt too hot, his hands going pink, and his eyes felt like they were moving too fast. He didn't want Snape to see his dreams in his eyes. “We believe you may have witnessed one of these incidents. Do you remember anything involving Draco being harmed?” he asked. Crabbe looked at him, his head buzzing, trying to think of a lie.
“Don’t worry, Draco, I’ll look after you. I promise, I’ll make you feel great.” He said softly, kissing him almost chastely before sitting back on his heels. He looked down at Draco’s spread legs, understanding what he needed to do before Draco would feel better. “Do you know a spell to… you know…?” he asked, gesturing down to Draco’s entrance. The blond nodded, and Harry got up to find Draco’s wand on the floor in his pile of robes.
“We…had an argument, Professor, I’m sorry.” Harry said, glancing at Draco. Snape glared at them both, clearly unsure if he should believe him.
“Hi, fancy seeing you here.” Harry said, feeling stupid. Blaise huffed a laugh, nodding. There was a pause, and Harry thought about running.
“Lubrico.” The Monster hissed, pressing the tip of Harry’s wand into Draco’s tiny pale pink hole. Draco gasped as cold liquid spurted inside him, a completely foreign sensation, letting out a tiny whimper as the wand pushed further inside him. The hand around the back of his neck let go, and returned on his arse cheek, spreading it away for a better look at his hole. Then Harry dropped the wand into his pocket, and the Monster plunged two of his fingers inside the virgin hole instead, all the way to the last knuckle, and revelling in the muffled sob Draco let out as he bit down on his own arm. “No need to keep your voice in…” the Monster whispered, toying with Draco’s insides with Harry’s hand.
“If…if Snape does Legilimency on Potter…h-he’ll see everything…” he said, his voice shaking. Snape…and probably Dumbledore seeing what Potter did to him… He was just being sucked into a blind panic when he felt warmth around his shoulders. He looked up to see Blaise, his arm around him as he sat on the edge of the mattress. Draco looked at him, eyes wide, and Blaise returned his gaze, steady and calm, calming. He slowly looked down, letting out a shaky breath, relaxing into him. Blaise looked at Pansy, who looked very sad.
This wasn't just embarrassment, or whatever Potter made him feel by those touches and smiles, this was…
“I know he can’t…” Draco said softly, his voice small. “But he’s there w-when I go home…I hate the sight of it now, it makes me feel sick… My parents’ faces make me want to scream and…I-I can’t breathe in my own room, where I’ve slept since I was born…!” he sobbed the last part, his poor body shaking. Harry instinctively held him closer, moving him to sit across his own lap so he might feel safe, wrapping his arms around his nemesis protectively. Harry shushed him gently, murmuring reassuring words he didn’t believe. If Draco was under Voldemort’s control, the only way to stop it was to kill the Dark Lord.
Draco's mouth moved minutely, open and shut, like he was tasting those words. Then he gulped, absorbing them. Blaise took this moment of clarity as some sort of reliquishment and took another step closer, glad when he didn't flinch too badly.
"It's ok..." was all he could say, all that came to mind in the chaotic whirlpool in his head. Draco let out a soft breath, which could have been a sigh of irritation just as easily as a small release of his burden, of relief. Blaise grabbed Draco's hand with a smile, saying they needed to get back to bed, and they left the bathroom.
"We'd love to." Hermione said, when Harry failed to speak. Or move. He was staring at Draco as he spoke, and now couldn't seem to look away. Heat was bubbling in both of their blood.
"Bloody hell… That sounds really shit, even if it is Ferret Face." He muttered, considering it. Harry bristled at the nickname but kept it in check.
"No problem." He glanced around, then tacked on something he knew would set the school's gossips to work. "Harry."
He took a sip of his pumpkin juice, wishing it was wine or something even stronger, and tried to calm himself down. It was irritating how much of an effect Harry had on him these days, where he used to only feel distain for the 'Chosen One' now he felt a coil of molten metal in his stomach, heating every inch of his insides and skin. Today, it seemed even worse, unrelenting and throbbing.
Blaise strode down the corridor at a brisk pace, blood rushing in his ears, his whole body tense with rage. How dare someone hurt Draco like that? How dare they? Harry Potter did this, he needed to pay.
"Oh, there's-" he started, getting up too quickly, making the other men jump and move defensively. Blaise went for his jacket's inner pocket, his other arm in front of Draco, who had flinched backwards. Harry remembered then his right to carry a wand had been suspended for five years following the trial, as a condition of his parole. "Sorry! Sorry… I-I just saw Ginny..." Harry said, feeling his own face heating up. He stepped out from the booth and away. Blaise glared at him but stopped reaching for his wand, his eyes moving Draco. The blond man shook his head, taking a breath.
They finally arrived at the Slytherin common room, Draco having whispered ‘agoraphobia’ to a blank wall in the dungeons, which then dissolved to reveal the passageway. They went in and Draco quickly grabbed a discarded Slytherin robe from a chair.
The fear was instant, making his chest tight and head turn into a spinning mess. Blaise looked at him, seeing he was freaking out, and spoke softly.
They settled down in bed to watch a funny film about male models that Blaise loves, and Draco spent much of it watching his boyfriend rather than the movie. His nose wrinkled when he laughed, flashing his white teeth, dark eyes shining and full of mirth. Draco kissed his cheek and wrapped his arms around him, squeezing. Blaise's attention was immediately on him, running a warm hand over his forearm and elbow.
"The Order can protect you, Draco, as long as you help us." Hermione said, firmly. A balance was necessary, she decided. She would continue to be kind to the Malfoy boy, provided he did nothing to antagonise her.
Draco let out a strangled yelp, summoning enough strength to push Harry away. Harry, not expecting this, flew back into the other wall, tripping over his own robes. He looked up at Draco, who had one hand on his already bruising neck, and one hand reaching for the cubicle’s lock. Harry quickly pointed his wand at the door and said “Colloportus,” Draco’s hand snapping away from it skittishly.
“Well… that’s a tad embarrassing…” Harry muttered to himself, rubbing his hand over his face, wanting to laugh and burn the note like it never happened.
“I’m sorry…” he said softly. Draco made a small whimper-like noise, wrapping his arms around Harry’s neck. Harry sank lower, closer, kissing his neck as he manoeuvred his clothing to pull his own erection out. He huffed against Draco’s skin in relief, struggling not to let himself come. Their bare erections finally touched and Draco bit down on his own lip hard, apparently catching himself before he lost it again. Harry pressed his thumb into the blond’s mouth to stop him hurting himself, then kissed him again as he moved his hips, causing the most incredible friction between the hard cocks. Draco’s hands found Harry’s thick hair, fingers tightening almost painfully when he came again with a stifled scream.
!” He snarled the last word through clenched teeth, spitting his anger out like it was venom. “I hate what happened so much I want to die, I think about it every second of the day, it's KILLING ME!” He shouted, Hermione tried not to jump. He felt like a child in her arms, young and helpless as he trembled with too many emotions for one person to comprehend. He was a child, they all were. She had had enough of seeing her friend in pain. She grabbed hold of his face with both hands and stood to look into his eyes. There were tears in both pairs, doe brown and despairing green.
"I killed them to protect myself and my family. The Death Eaters kept us alive because we were an amusement." He said, through clenched teeth. "I regret having to do it, but I would do
“I’m sorry, Draco…I’m so sorry…” then tears were falling down Draco’s cheeks, but not from Draco’s eyes, which were closed. Pansy shoved Blaise away, hissing about waking him up, and gently wiped Blaise’s tears from Draco’s skin. Blaise’s chest was burning with sobs, surging in his lungs, and he had to almost run from the Hospital Wing before he could let it out, not wishing to wake Draco.
Draco glanced up at the Gryffindor table and, almost immediately, Harry looked back at him. They swapped minuscule nods, agreeing today was the day, and returned to their respective meals. They had a free period that morning, so most of their year group headed for the library after breakfast, their workload beginning to ramp up.
A few weeks passed, and it seemed what had happened in that bathroom was a one-time thing, a horrible blip in both their lives. Then came the first Saturday in December, when there was a Hogsmeade trip.
Draco woke up panting and freezing, like every night, and like every night Blaise felt his sudden movement, sensing his distress, and stirred beside him.
Harry made his move just as Draco was reaching the last staircase of his ascent, the coast clear all the way to Barnabus the Bewildered. Flying past the others, he rushed from the Common Room, grabbing a plate of sandwiches from the buffet, and headed for the Room.
“I’ve tried so many things…blowjobs, handjobs and just swallowing it, that didn’t work…” he sighed, blushing slightly, bringing his bare legs up to curl up on the sofa. “It was rather disgusting, but Blaise even gave me some of his to experiment with…I put it in food, drinks, on its own, put it…up there…nothing. It has to be sex with males, and they have to come inside my arse or I…I feel like I’m burning alive…” he said, sipping his drink but Harry was fairly sure it was just to hide his face for a moment.
defeat Voldemort, and he wasn't even 18, hadn't even sat his N.E.W.T.s., and yet he was expected to kill the most powerful dark wizard of all time.
“Be quiet, you bitch.” He snarled, feeling another overwhelming wave of rage. He grabbed a handful of Draco’s soft white-blond hair and pulled his head back, pushing his other hand against his mouth. His could feel the heat of Draco’s mouth against his fingers, and his monster wanted to feel it more.
They hadn't spoken much since the trial, the occasional owl letter with an update of their respective lives despite the other's hand in it. Harry knew Narcissa had more or less abandoned the Manor and was living close to Tonks’ parents, having rekindled her relationship with her surviving sister. Teddy lived with them too and was already fond of his great aunt, Draco had mentioned his little cousin warmly.
“Are you tight again, Draco?” the Monster asked with Harry’s voice. Draco tensed, swearing at him angrily. “We made quite a mess last time…I hope we don’t ruin your darling protector’s rug…” Harry felt confusion in his foggy mind. Snape was Draco’s protector? Since when? “I wonder how his Unbreakable Vow will be affected when I rape you on his very own desk…” the laughter was high and cruel. What on earth was an Unbreakable Vow? Harry didn’t even understand the words coming out of his own mouth.
He dreamed of Draco, screaming, covered in blood. He dreamed of Harry Potter turning into a dragon, and burning Draco alive, then crunching on his charred bones, the blackened shards raining down around Blaise as he stood, paralysed in his own subconscious. He woke up panting, his back drenched with sweat, and he felt sick. Goyle was sitting up, wearing his pyjamas, frowning at Draco’s empty bed.
Harry’s pace from then on was deep and slow, letting them feel every inch of each other as he moved inside Draco, who was able to regain some energy from the gear shift and recommenced his exquisite moans of pleasure. It was a very satisfying pace for the both of them. Draco came twice more before Harry, and after a break they were at it again. Three was Harry’s limit, but Draco’s fever seemed to have been quelled for now. The blond boy lay on the bed after casting his clean-up spells, completely exhausted and already mostly asleep, and Harry was more than willing to join him under the covers and pull him in close, falling asleep the happiest he’d been in a long while.
The boy jumped and turned, clearly in a lot of discomfort. His face was flushed and he was panting, shaking hand clutching the front of his robes tightly. His eyes were misty and unfocussed, like he had been hit with an Imperius curse or something.
"Right? I've always thought Draco would make a good cat. A Siamese, or a Persian maybe. Something posh."

“Don’t worry, I’m gonna keep to myself. Thinking about doing some research into being an Auror.” He said as they parted. She grinned and nodded, saying that was a good idea, before boarding the train with everyone else. He waved as the train drew away, then headed back to the castle.
It was dark by the time Draco realised how long he'd stayed in the Room with Potter, and how much he'd enjoyed the day. They'd laughed and talked and had so much fun that it didn't matter who they were or what they did the night before, they were simply friends there.
When he saw Draco, he was surprised. Then confused. Then suspicious all over again. He didn't look flushed or sweaty, or at all like the sorry state he'd been in before.
Snape and McGonagall were sitting either side of Dumbledore’s chair behind his desk, a chair set up facing them on the other side. Harry looked at McGonagall, trying to ascertain how she felt about him now, but she wore her usual stern expression. It was Snape who showed his true feelings, more so than usual. His lip curled in disgust as soon as he saw Harry, but seemed to check himself and looked at Dumbledore instead.
