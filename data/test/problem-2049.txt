To hell with this, Harry thought as he summoned all of the magic inside of him to break the body binding spell that the headmaster put on him just seconds ago. He felt his energy built up until suddenly it broke free and he was able to move agw. Immediately he pulled off his invisibility cloak and stormed out of the shadow.
Draco wasn’t noticeably moving anymore and his breath was steady meaning he was probably sleeping already. His body felt decently warm now so Harry could surely take his arm away from him.
So Harry just sat there. In front of his supposed enemy. In front of his known arch nemesis in fact. In front of Malfoy. In front of Draco? He'd never seen the blonde arrogant and proud Slytherin like this. Somehow broken and vulnerable. His skin look even more pale than Harry remembered and his normally ridiculously neat hair was standing up in all kinds of directions in a way that almost could be called curly. Wait, why was he, Harry, even looking at Malfoy? What did he care if Malfoys hair curled? Just like an hour ago Draco was threatening Dumbledores life and Harry was sure if he hadn't done something to stop him Draco would have attempted to kill the headmaster. What Harry didn't know the answer to was as to why exactly Draco would do something so terrible and stupid. Sure, Harry knew Draco disrespected Dumbledore for accepting muggleborns at Hogwarts, sure, Draco was on the everlasting mission to earn his fathers respect, but would even Lucius Malfoy go as far as ordering his own son to commit murder? No, it must be something else. After keeping a close eye on Malfoy over the past few months Harry had his suspicions. Suspicions that Malfoy was aiming to become a Death Eater and serve Voldemort. But todays events just now made it real. Draco must have already committed to serving the Dark Lord truely. But then why was he crying? Why wasn't he fighting Harry for interfering his mission, why didn't he do something instead of letting himself just be dragged along by Harry? Harry had no answer to that just yet. And he couldn't let himself think about it anymore, he could be glad he didn't have to deal with a fighting Malfoy, right now he had more important things at hand. Understanding Malfoy would have to wait.
With that he came walking back towards the tent.
The thestral bent down, obviously suggesting Harry to get up.
„I think I’m feeling sick, Harry“ he said weakly against Harrys ear.
Malfoys eyes appeared again at Harrys outbreak, their piercing grey peeking out from under his long lashes, but he remained quiet.
Harry rolled his eyes but he had to agree a fish would definitely beat another meal of mushrooms.
„I’m sure he could but have you looked at the weather lately? The sun is shining bright and there‘s not even a cloud in sight, so if some of your… friends… are looking for us they’d see us flying with a huge thestral like Shadowfax from who knows how many miles away“, Harry responded. „You don’t want them to find us, do you?“
Draco pondered for a moment. He wasn’t exactly freezing like yesterday, the fire warmed him up alright, but he wouldn’t mind physical comfort.
„I don’t even want to. How did you get used to trotting on a goddamn horse!?“
„Here, eat these, please“ Harry offered the apples Draco collected yesterday to Shadowfax. With an appreciative grunt the thestral got up to his feet and started feeding on the pile of apples.
He thought about trying to Accio the fish but even if it worked it wouldn’t be any fun. So he found himself a stick with a pointy end and started stripping down to his briefs.
„You’ll get used to it.“
„Thanks!“ Harry yelled after him.
This time Dracos head moved up a little so Harry could see his face. His eyes were looking up at Harry wide and confused and... they were red from tears. Harry thought he must have imagined Draco crying when they fled the tower, he thought his brain played a trick on him. But there was no denying it now. Dracos expression made Harrys anger crumble and when he didn't say anything suddenly Harry didn't know what to say either.
„Shit!“ Harry suddenly screamed.
Without waiting for Dracos reaction he entered the cabin, which was padded out once again with soft moss. Harry briefly considered choosing the other side of the small room to lay down just to see if Malfoy would have it in him to lay next to Shadowfax. The thought put a smile on Harrys lips but he decided against it, not wanting to be woken up by a screaming Draco because he had a nightmare about being eaten by a thestral. It appeared Shadowfax was already fast asleep when Harry made himself comfortable next to him.
„If you payed a little more attention in potions, Potter, you’d know what to look out for“, Draco said proudly.
„What, are you going to choke me?“, Harry raised his eyebrow at Malfoy.
Terrified by the impressing pace and the sudden heavy movement under him Draco gripped his hands onto Harrys hips for safety again. This felt different than yesterday when the thestral used his wings instead of his legs. Yesterday it was a soft swinging motion but todays quick trot on the ground had Draco jumping up and down. Harry sat somewhat more relaxed holding on to the thestrals mane.
„Oh“ was all Harry could say.
Draco flinched a bit at the thought of the thestral might being interested in his precious flesh. Anyway he agreed to preparing the huge fish for them. He bossed Harry around, describing to him which herbs he needed to find to make a meal. When they had everything together and got the fire going it was already sunset.
To Harrys surprise Draco didn’t even so much as to make a noise of protest, but the reason for the lack of protest seemed shockingly obvious - Dracos body felt cold as ice against Harry, and the shaking hadn’t stopped yet. Harry just kept holding onto him, hoping his own body heat could give Draco a little bit of warmth. But to Harrys great displeasure his own body was starting to tremble too by now, even their combined body heat wasn’t enough to withstand the crucial cold.
Shadowfax cast an offended glance at Draco.
„Don’t take it personal“, Harry addressed Shadowfax „He’s just not a big fan of any magical creature bigger than a house elf.“
„I… I wasn’t talking about that“
After another intense stare at Harry from these intriguing white eyes the thestral growled in agreement.
„No, what?“
„Come on up“ Harry said, reaching out his hand to Draco.
„Listen, Shadowfax“ Harry began and put a hand on the thestrals neck in sympathy „I don’t know why you decided to safe us last night but I am really grateful about it. Thank you. If possible I would be glad if you could stay with us for a while longer, we will need your help out here.“
Harry decided to prepare their camp for tonight. He chose a place a few meters away from the river, just under a huge tree. He summoned some wood and branches and busied himself building a little cabin, just like yesterday. It was again around three meters high and roughly large enough to fit the three of them inside. This time though Harry put in the effort of disguising the cabin a little, putting some delusion charms over it so it wouldn’t be as visible and obvious as the last one. When he was confident about the cabin he prepared the firewood in front of it for later.
With that the boy behind him stilled, still not letting go of Harrys hips though, as if making clear that if he was to fall, Harry was going to fall with him.
Draco realized in horror that he must have lost his wand during their fall, or maybe he dropped it when he saw Harry appear next to Dumbledore. It was only now that anger washed over Draco. Of course it was stupid Potter to ruin his task for him. Stupid Potter who stopped him from killing Dumbledore. Stupid Potter making him lose his wand. Stupid Potter who gave him an escape from doing what he was more afraid of than anything ever before...
Before Harry could react they had already reached the riverside and the thestral stopped and bowed down again for them to slide off his back. Draco rather fell off instead, towing Harry along.
„There was a time when I did.“
Everyones eyes grew wide in surprise and shock. And in Dracos case; fear. Sheer and utter fear was radiating off of him.
He grabbed the fish, walked up to Draco and let it fall into his lap.
Harry never thought that there‘d be a day when he’d be thankful for having a creature sleeping next to him that looked like a dying horse with wings attached to it but there it was. He didn’t want to risk waking Shadowfax so he went outside to call Draco and took a few steps until he realized Malfoy wasn’t there anymore.
„Do you think we should go back to Hogwarts?“ Harry asked Draco. He could see the blonde boys face go pale, his eyes indicating discomfort.
„Oh“ Draco hadn’t expected an honest answer like that but nevertheless he felt somehow grateful that Harry trusted him with this.
„Sleeping yet?“
After they finished demolishing the camp from last night and scattered the remainders of the fire, they started heading down the clearing, letting Shadowfax lead the way, hoping his instincts would lead him to find water.
Another thought that came into Harrys mind was how innocent Draco looked in his sleep. He looked nothing like the sarcastic mean git that Harry used to despise. With his face softened like this he looked what could be called nothing but beautiful to Harry.
As they were falling Dumbledore was already fighting off the Death Eaters remaining on the plattform.
Harry sighed and walked back to where he heard Shadowfax snoring. When he entered the hide again his heart almost jumped out of his ribcage when two pale hands wrapped around his mouth from behind.
„No worries“, Malfoy continued as Harry didn’t seem to answer his question and instead glared at him as if expecting an attack. „I just didn’t want to wake the bloody Pegasus“, he added smirking.
„No, I didn't fucking want to kill him. But I… I had to. I mean… I have to. You can’t understand. Nobody could ever understand.“ The last part came out shaky.
„Alright okay, sorry… Shadowfax.“ Draco offered and the thestral seemed to think it was good enough for now.
„You know, Malfoy – maybe you aren’t as purely evil as I used to think.“
He didn’t see him at first but when he looked behind their little tent into the woods he saw Malfoys back.
Shadowfax didn’t have the patience to wait anymore so he startet falling into a quick trot.
Just when Harry thought he might have pulled them to fall to their death their tumbling came to an abrupt halt when they landed roughly on some enormous moving object. Once Harrys eyes were able to focus on what was happening he realized that a huge thestral just caught them on its back.
Harry grunted. „I think we’ll rest here tomorrow as well. The day after we should be safe to go back home.“
„My legs hurt, Potter, I’m not used to walking this far at a pace like this“ Malfoy complained after a three hour walk.
And with that Harry got up on his feet walking towards the place where Shadowfax laid. He wanted to thank the Thestral for rescuing them but since he was still snoring Harry decided he didn’t want to wake him up again.
Draco lifted one hand up to close it around Harrys throat, placing his fingers exactly on Harrys windpipe. He pressed down for a moment to make his point.
„No.“
Malfoy rubbed his hands over his eyes, frowning as he took them away. Only now he seemed to remember where he was. He looked up at the thestral, who appeared to be a good 2 meters tall now in full lighting, wings not included. Dracos eyes went a bit wide and he quickly made an escape through the entry of the cabin.
„It’s your lucky day then I assume, it’s not like I could actually go anywhere even if I wanted to. We’re in a forest in the middle of goddamn nowhere and I don’t even have my wand.“
„Shit! Shit! Shit!“ he shouted out loud, punching his fists into the ground, which earned him an angry growl from the sleepy thestral.
A yawn disturbed Harrys thoughts.
Finally Dracos breathing began to slow down and his body also calmed from ist previous shivers. Harry was actually beginning to feel comfortable and warm, with Shadowfax‘ protective wing still being on top of them. He rested his head against Dracos neck, involuntarily breathing in his smell which reminded Harry a bit of minty rose petals and fresh green apples.
With that the thestral strode towards the water to drink and roam around feeding on grass again after.
„Sorry“ he said, although he didn’t look particularly sorry.
„Would you please try to stop shivering so hard? I can’t sleep like that“ Harry grumbled against Dracos neck.
Harry stalked towards the cowering blonde figure on the ground until he stood right in front of him. He felt his wand in his pocket but decided to leave it there, there would be no need for it since he saw Draco dropping his own wand back at the astronomy tower when he saw Harry stepping out of the shadows.
Draco got up groaning, „I can’t even move, Potter, my arse fucking hurts.“ With that he heaved himself next to the cabin and sat down again. „Fish would be nice.“
„Get off me, Malfoy! Careful!“
„You okay?“, Harry asked quietly.
Malfoy had calmed down a bit by now, or at least he wasn't shaking against Harry anymore, merely his arms were still wrapped around Harrys waist, but with no force.
„What is it, Shadow? Did you find water?“
Draco removed his hand from Harrys throat, putting it on his chest, exactly over the boys beating heart instead.
Suddenly Harry felt Dracos hands releasing their grip on his waist only to sling forward instead, hugging his arms around the other boys stomach. Harrys whole body filled with tension by the unexpected and unfamiliar touch, but he was too focused on leading the thestral than to be able to concentrate.
It was somehow beautiful how the stars and the moon shone through the empty spaces between the leaves and branches above them.
„Oh, just shut up, would you!“
„Congrats for stating the obvious, Potter. The word unusual is an understatement.“
„Mind giving me some privacy, Potter? I don’t fancy being stalked while peeing.“
„Sorry, I guess. Just wanted to check if you were still around.“
Shadowfax answered with another encouraging neigh, so Harry climbed on his back. Immediately the thestral walked towards Draco whose eyes widened again seeing Harry sit on the huge thestral.
„Malfoy!“ Harry demanded Dracos attention once again.
Draco hadn’t even finished the sneering question when Shadowfax lifted his front hooves up, rearing towards Draco. With his mouth open Draco fell on his butt into the grass next to Harry.
„Sod off, Potter“, came the lame reply.
Harry gazed down at Dracos hair, his head laying on Harrys chest. The blonde curly strands were lit by the rays of moonlight peaking through the ceiling and Harry couldn’t help but notice it had something angelic to it.
But it wasn’t as if anyone would ever find out, was it?
„Didn’t think I was gone, did you, Potter?“, Draco said, removing his hands from Harrys face.
When he was done the moon was already high on the midnight sky and the temperature must have already been near freezing point. Thanks to Shadowfax body heat the cabin would do a decent job of keeping the three of them warm or at least keeping them from freezing to death.
„You have no idea what I could do to have you be killed in an instant“, Malfoy continued.
Harry was already as close as possible to the thestral so if Draco wanted their warmth he needed to get closer himself.
Quite satisfied with the little cabin he created he put his wand away and started collecting some moss to stuff out the ground inside.
Harry again closed his eyes, trying to give his thoughts a rest. And to ensure they wouldn’t become cold while sleeping again, he wrapped his arms around Draco under the blanket of their sleeping saviors wing.
And that was when Harry started laughing. Laughing like he didn’t remember laughing in ages. It was just too hilarious seeing Malfoy scare from a peaceful creature like this. Harry just couldn’t stop himself, tears already forming in his eyes. His stomach startet hurting and his legs gave in letting him fall to the ground, still not able to stop laughing.
„Here, I caught it, you’ll cook.“
Why would Draco get all whiny about Harry asking him to stop shivering?
Harry was woken up by bright rays of sunshine breaking through the roof. He blinked a few times to adjust his eyes to the sudden brightness. When he could see clearly again he noticed that Draco was still sound asleep in the same position as when he driftet into sleep last night. By carefully lifting Dracos head off his chest, trying not to wake the blonde boy just yet, Harry attempted to get up. Doing so he accidentally nodged his elbow into Shadowfax‘ side who blinked awake and turned his head to Harry, his remarkable white eyes looking at him somehow deeply. The huge thestral withdrew his wing from both of the wizards, folding it back up. Harry managed to sit up on his knees without waking Draco who still slept sincerely.
But then Draco decided he’d rather not die here, in the middle of nowhere next to the worlds damn wannabe savior Harry Potter. So the skinny figure moved until he was in a similar position as Harry, laying on his side, his back to Harrys front as Harrys back was pointed to Shadowfax.
Harry found himself stuck in between the thestrals moving back and Dracos full weight laying on top of him. At some point during their fall Draco must have reached for Harrys arms, because now he had a death grip on them, as the thestral was flying them away from the battleground.
„I could“, Draco replied, not moving his hand.
Shadowfax moved in a slow walk towards the edge of the clearing, laying down under a large tree. It was only now that Harry turned around to see Draco sitting on the grass, his knees pulled up towards his chest and his head resting on his crossed arms.
They left Shadowfax grazing on the field next to the tent while the both of them headed into the forest to find something edible. To Harrys surprise Draco was not only gifted at finding berries but also knew which mushrooms to eat.
„Hm“ he said then, taking one of the berries between his fingers, eyeing it closely and hoping he could differ between a poisoned berry and a normal one. It did seem legit so he decided to just go for it and swallow it. It turned out to be surprisingly delicious. He couldn’t stop himself from smiling. And wouldn’t it have been as dark he would have noticed Draco was smiling too as he saw how Harry loaded a big handful of the berries into his mouth.
„Hey!“ Harry shouted, his anger flooding back, but Draco made no visible move.
„Let’s just look for some food for now, I’m starving.“, Harry suggested and Dracos empty stomach didn’t seem to protest.
„We're here because of you Malfoy, so why are you looking at me like that! What were you doing up there, huh!? If I hadn't stopped you, would Dumbledore be dead by now? Is that what you want? It can't be Malfoy, it can't be...“
Draco couldn’t stop himself from acknowledging Harrys defined backside. His spine shone threw the skin but his shoulderblades seemed wide and strong, his hip small and delicate. Draco couldn’t stop himself from blushing, why did he even bother?
„No.“
Suddenly Draco moved, turning to face Harry but his eyes were closed. Sleeping Draco moved impossibly closer and now draped his one arm over Harrys stomach unconsciously.
Harry turned around to get more comfortable, him being the one laying on his back facing the ceiling now.
Harry turned his head around in anger: „If you dare say one more word, Malfoy, I'll push you down myself.“
„We have to get moving and search for some drinking water.“
The food was actually pretty good. When they finished everything there was a weird silence. Like none of them knew what to say.
„Not yet. Please. Not just yet“ Draco whispered, his grey eyes drifting far away.
Malfoy still looked at him, his expression meaningless. „I said no, Potter.“
It felt like Draco was about to say something but couldn’t get himself to. But Harry already understood.
„What did you say?“
What a pathetic little pile of creatures they had to look like, Harry was thinking. To his displeasure Draco still didn’t stop shaking, now even more annoyingly since his back was almost pressed against Harrys chest. Harry sighed and after a short moment of hesitation he put his upper arm around Draco, drawing him closer.
Malfoy seemed to consider this suggestion briefly and Harry almost thought Draco would rather freeze to death than willingly coming within touching distance to him.
This actually was more of help than one might have thought, Harrys body soon warmed up and even Dracos body felt warm against Harrys chest by now, but for some reason the other boy was still trembling.
Draco just rolled his eyes.
„Thanks again Shadow, for carrying us. Don’t mind Draco, he just isn’t used to it.“
„Let go of me, Malfoy, we need to get off of him now, he's tired.“
Harry just frowned.
Harry felt his legs go weak as the adrenaline left his body. He let out a shaky breath and let himself down to the ground. He saw Malfoy lowering his head into his arms again.
So Draco wasn’t cold, not really. He was shaking because he was sorry for what he had been about to do, for all the things he had done already. Harry couldn’t help but to grip Draco a bit tighter.
„Help!“ Draco flinched and jumped behind Harry.
Now Harry was the one to burry his face in his hands, shaking his head in disbelief of this whole terrible situation.
Harrys attention returned to Draco who stopped purging by now but still looked a little bit green in the face.
Draco turned around.
„Don’t be a fool Potter. Trust your instincts.“
Just when Dumbledore made a move to cover Harry up behind him the boy jumped forward to grip Draco by his collar. Harrys eyes daggered into Dracos - acid green staring into stormy gray. He made use of all the built up adrenaline in his body and pulled Draco towards the edge of the tower. Just when a warning „Potter...!“ escaped Dracos lips Harry tightened his grip on him with both of his hands. The Boy Who Lived furrowed his eyebrows in full concentration and drew both himself and Malfoy over the edge.
Draco shouldn’t, he told himself. He should keep the rest of his dignity and resist basically cuddling up to his enemy and his pet.
After they found a decent amount of mushrooms and some more herbs and berries they returned to their camp. Harry pulled out his wand.
„Po-… H… Harry. There’s no space for me.“
After Harry finally stopped laughing he smiled up at Draco genuinely.
Draco nodded in agreement. They decided it was best if they erased their tracks in case the Death Eaters followed them.
Harry couldn’t explain why his body reacted the way it did but he slung his arms around Draco again, holding him to his chest.
„I spent some more time with the thestrals than the others in class. After Sirius died I felt like they were the only ones to understand me so I visited them regularly during fith year and they took me on rides through the forbidden forest.“
A confirmatory neigh escaped Shadows jaws and Harry looked a little harder but didn’t see anything so he closed his eyes instead. Yeah, he could hear a river run somewhere near. With an excited jump Shadowfax fell into a light canter and Dracos grip on Harrys hip tightened once again.
„So… - what’s your damn plan now savior? Are we going to ride into the bloody sunset with that nasty Pegasus of yours?“
„Do you want to?“
And Harry left it at that. Draco didn’t have his wand and he seemed to be somewhat even grateful to Harry, so Harry didn’t see the sense in prying any further into Dracos thoughts.
Well at least someone had regained their confidence, Harry thought. „Shadowfax is not a Pegasus. And he saved our lives if you didn’t notice.“
„Technically you didn’t catch it, the horse did. Isn’t he supposed to be a herbivore by the way?“
An unpleasant thought crept his way into Harrys head. Could it be possible for Draco to be wanting to be found by Death Eaters?
A little smile built on Harrys face
„Yeah… “, Draco yawned.
They ate together in peace, watching the sun disappear behind the trees behind the calm river.
It was a few quiet minutes later when Harry felt Draco beginning to shake next to him. Harry actually had a hard time trying not to shiver too, because it was even colder than he had expected. Lucky for him Shadofax‘ heat was warming him a bit. One thing was sure, he wouldn’t be able to sleep for even a second if Draco didn’t stop shaking as heavily as he did. Harry moved another inch closer to the sleeping thestral and rolled around so he was looking at Draco now.
„Can’t he fly again?!“ Draco asked Harry in hope of getting rid of the awkward feeling of the trot.
So this is for the two kind souls who commented on the first chapter of the story, I hope you will enjoy the second one as well :) I'm sorry it took me so long until I found the courage to upload it.
„You need to come closer Malfoy, if you don’t fancy the thought of freezing to death that is.“
Shadowfax started lowering towards the ground in circles until his hooves finally hit the high grass of the clearing.
Shadowfax let out a deep breath and naturally put his wing over them as a protective blanket again.
Harry teared Draco out of his thoughts by making a suggestive gesture to get up.
Harry growled a bit but moved so he was laying closer to Shadowfax so Draco could lie down next to Harry if he wanted to. The next thing he felt was Dracos arm accidentally brushing against his back as the blonde boy lay down next to him. Harry had his back towards Draco, his eyes towards Shadowfax who was still snoring peacefully. Draco must have been laying on his back facing the ceiling of branches above them.
Shortly after, Harry heard Draco enter the room and groaning when he got down. His body must still be hurting from all the walking and riding today.
Dracos tone was angry but when he saw Harrys embarrassed face he couldn’t help but to smile a little when he pulled his zipper up and turned around to face Harry.
„Let me down! Tell it to land! If you care for your life, Potter, you will get us down! NOW!“
And without even looking at Draco again he lay down on the soft moss.
Harry didn’t let himself consider Malfoys words, instead he said: „Doesn’t really matter now. We should prepare something to spend the night, it will get freezingly cold soon, and I’m not interested in waking up dead tomorrow.“
So the only thing Harry Potter could do was to stare. To stare and wait for Draco Malfoy to speak the words - the words that would undoubtedly enable his shaking wand to end Albus Dumbledores life.
„Didn’t fancy the ride?“
In the middle of the clearing he stopped and looked around. But even if Malfoy had still been there, there was no point in looking for him now, everything was already pitch black.
„Of fucking course not“, Draco mumbled.
To Harrys amusement Shadowfax also yawned, being the first to walk into the cabin, curling himself up on the ground and tucking his head under one of his wings.
Shadowfax didn’t seem to care about the additional weight on him as he trotted away happily.
„Don’t worry about it now. You’re here. We’re safe. Dumbledore is safe. We just need to get some sleep now, forget about the rest.“
Like that they fell into another blissful sleep.
Draco could only move a few inches away on all fours before he threw up wholeheartedly.
„Are you cold?“ Harry asked, being the gentleman he always was.
„Well then“ Harry said „Don’t you even try doing something funny like stealing my wand while I’m sleeping.“
Harry was having the time of his life plunging in the water, swimming as soon as it was deep enough. When he felt he was as clean as he would get he gripped the stick from earlier and was happy to see the water was shallow enough for him to actually see the fish swimming there. Actually catching them wasn’t as easy though. That didn’t stop Harry from trying and it was a full 45 minutes later when he stopped to have a break.
To help warn the more sensitive people, I added the tag "Implied/referenced Non-Con/Rape.
Draco stood up and extended his hand towards Remus. “Come on. We’ll write out requests in the kitchen and send them out immediately.”
Harry turned his head, forced to look at Lupin. He swallowed. “I’m scared you’ll be hurt if you go to Azkaban,” he said, but the fight, the dominance had left his voice.
‘Oh, right. I forgot,’ Draco apologised and he put his hand to the cold, brass gates, that opened when he removed his hand. The gates would only open for an Omega, and had been glamoured to only show the school building when one stood outside the gates.
After that you’d step into the store itself and you’d be surrounded by tall bookshelves that formed a maze through the store. In each section, there was a second-hand sub-section. Most second-hand books that were sold at Crossroads were still in a good condition, but they did have a section in the back in which you could find the books that were old and tattered. Molly always looked for books there, Draco knew.
Draco sat up straight, but knew he still looked mopey.
Did he distrust Harry?
Draco managed a watery smile. “But I should tell Harry, right?”
‘Because…?’
‘Draco, that’s unhealthy!’ Mrs Weasley reprimanded him, ‘you need certain things when you’re in heat, denying that could at worst kill you! And you’re still so fragile…’ She pulled him closer, hugging him tight, though awkward because Draco still half-sat in his chair, as was she.
the fact that this time, it is Harry, and not Lucius?
Mr Potter pulled back and stood up. ‘I should go.’
‘He’s nice. I like him a lot,’ Draco repeated what he had told Astoria a few days ago. It had gotten him somewhere with her so it might work in Neville too.
“David would’ve fitted just fine as well,” Draco muttered and he repositioned Alexander a little so he could hold the baby more comfortably.
‘Yes, yes…’
Harry looked away, so Draco tugged on their bond to see if he could feel anything.
“And about pregnancies?” She sounded rather detached and that helped Draco push his embarrassment and his awkward feelings about that subject away, and dryly read his notes on that out loud as well. “Male Omega pregnancies are rare due to an array of facts. Firstly, while male Omegas have the capacity to carry children, their body wasn’t originally made for such a task. Next to that, in order to successfully and without assistance conceive, both the Omega and Alpha need to have a strong magical core. Most advisable is that they at least have a grade O bond. Even if the couple successfully conceives, most male Omega bodies don’t adapt to the pregnancy well.” Draco stopped there, looking at Hermione. He wasn’t sure what he was looking for when he looked at her – compassion? Empathy?
He heard people talk, but couldn’t make out their words over the panic that filled his head.
Well... I've left you with a bit of a cliffhanger. See you guys next week!
“Thank Merlin,” Draco managed, forcing back his tears.
‘You can write your questions down if it’s too hard to ask them out loud,’ Mrs Weasley offered. ‘Write them down over the course of today and I’ll provide you with a written answer on whatever questions you have.’
‘I expect you two back within the hour,’ Adelaide pointed at them bossily, ‘and I want a detailed report of the house from you, so no fumbling and finding a secure bedroom for the two of you.’
‘I know. Just this one time?’
‘Mhw, you make me do it…’ Draco responded and he wriggled his hips a little, hoping to lure another orgasm out of Harry. Harry maybe thought that it was embarrassing that he could come over and over again when he’d knotted Draco, but Draco secretly liked it. A lot.
Draco shook his head, still not processing the situation. “What…?”
On day five, however, he awoke before she had come in his room to wake him up (as she had done every day prior). He sat up and looked around. The room wasn’t really big, but it was cosy. It was a bit cluttered and the wardrobe didn’t quite close, he noticed, but it smelled nice and Alpha-y, combined with something else he couldn’t quite make out. The weird tube-thing was still is his nose and he touched it carefully, wondering what it was and why it was there.
Draco looked away again, pulling his book out of his bag. He cleared his throat, tapping his fingers on his book.
Neither Omega said something as Draco joined Lupin at the table, pushing a cup of chamomile tea in his direction. Lupin mumbled something that vaguely sounded like a thankyou, and Draco took it as one. He leaned back, closing his eyes and breathing slowly for a few minutes, trying to ground himself a little more. The smell of tea and books was oddly comforting, and oddly reminded him of the time he had spent in the library back at Malfoy Mansion, before he presented as Omega. Looking back, his parents never should have pretended that Draco could still present as Alpha, or even beta. It had always been clear he would be an Omega. Even as a child, he’d been tall, slender, somewhat shy and introverted. He had lacked the physical bulk of an Alpha, and although he could understand his parents had hoped for at least beta, he could not have imagined why. Maybe life would have been easier if his parents had accepted he’d become an Omega right from the start. The switch from Alpha to Omega education had been weird at best - one day, he had been learning how to fight for, and defend a small group of people, and the other they’d tell him that he’d have to run if he sensed danger.
Hermione stepped towards the floo, ‘I’ll go see if there are any laws that prohibit an Alpha bringing his Omega immediately. Ministry of Magic!’ She disappeared into the green flames.
Harry looked away sheepishly. “I actually didn’t realise what I was doing until later.”
It made him feel alone and empty.
‘Well, let’s go in then.’ Harry pushed Draco forwards a little bit and Draco hesitantly opened the door. It was more formal to let Harry do this, because he was the Alpha, but if this was a shop meant for Omegas…
charmed books,
Draco nodded slowly, ‘okay… what do you suggest?’
In the end, the Aurors never caught Riddle. Pansy Parkinson was arrested and while she first claimed to have been under the Imperious curse, she eventually confessed to have hidden Riddle after his escape from Azkaban. She was also the one to bribe several Ministry officials to “lose” Riddle’s file and helped him gain ownership of more Omegas than was legal.
It worked. Draco relaxed underneath his hands. “Maybe I’ll ask him.”
‘No.’ Draco stubbornly turned his body away as well.
Diagon alley was nearly empty. Just a few people doing their shopping on a Monday afternoon. Fortescue’s was abandoned, the employee sitting behind the counter with a book.
Adelaide had permanently moved in with the Weasleys. Draco wasn’t sure what her relationship with Mr and Mrs Weasley was, and he was fairly certain he didn’t want to know the details either.
She crossed her arms, tensing the muscles in her jaw as if preparing to say ‘no’, when Draco made eye contact with her. He raised his eyebrows in challenge and added, “it’s Harry. I’m sure you know him.” If Harry’s behaviour before had been anything to go by, they knew each other.
he thought amusedly to himself.
‘No. Ron is always on Hermione’s side,’ Harry looked venomously at Hermione, ‘and Ginny is always against me to spite me.’
He still wasn’t pregnant. It wasn’t like he and Harry had been actively trying and he hadn’t gone into heat after their bonding, but still… He’d expected… something, especially since last time he’d felt that small bump. It had disappeared a few days after his heat though, leaving him feeling empty and craving.
‘Draco? We’re leaving!’ Harry called.
“So nothing came out of your last heat?” Adelaide probed.
Draco hastily obeyed, lying on the bed, flat on his back, staring at the ceiling. He could hear the soft clink of a belt being undone, and then the sound of a zipper. He moaned in anticipation.
“Harry and I want to have a baby,” he slowly said, still considering the words as they left his mouth.
“Me neither,” Draco quietly said. “They were so nice, too.”
‘You don’t think this is fun?’ Harry asked more seriously, bringing his face up to Draco’s eye level to look at him, but at the same time moving his hand down and palming Draco’s cock through his pyjama trousers.
Draco looked away from Mr Potter, to his mother, as if asking for permission. She nodded at him. He awkwardly picked up the hem of his long tunic and pulled it over his head. Beneath that he wore an undershirt, which he also took of carefully. Without looking at Mr Potter or his mother, he then fumbled with the complicated closure of his trousers. Mr Potter coughed again and Draco hastily pushed his trousers down. He didn’t wear any shoes, but did wear a pair if dainty white lace socks. It was a silly thing, really, wearing these girly socks when he didn’t want to dress like one, but when Miss Fawley had offered them to him he hadn’t been able to resist.
“I sometimes forget how sharp you are,” Draco chuckled. “We’re okay. We’re um, expecting twins, apparently.” It felt odd telling someone, even more so because it was Lupin. Lupin usually kept to himself, and so did Harry and Draco. It was a silent, mutual understanding. Only on rare occasions did they talk about anything personal.
“So tell me what you found.” Hermione sounded stern and not for the first time, Draco thought that she might’ve missed her vocation – she would make a wonderful teacher. “Well…” He hesitated, not so much because he hadn’t learned anything from his research, but because he wasn’t sure if he wanted to talk about it with Hermione. Not sure if he wanted to talk about it at all.
Draco felt relieved to have both arms occupied with the child, for he knew he would’ve rubbed his empty stomach otherwise. “We’re fine.”
Remus uncurled himself with another sigh. “You’re probably right.”
What do you think about Molly's response to Harry? Can Harry help Draco through his heat without knotting and/or bonding with him?? OHHH SO EXITED (even though it's my own story hahah)
Remus laughed bitterly. “No. Of course not.”
“I gathered as much,” Draco said drily, and Sirius barked out a wolfish laugh. “I like him, Rem. He’s sharp.”
‘To wake Mr Potter. You need him.’
‘But what… what happened?’ Adelaide pushed him for answers.
“Okay.”
“We’ll talk when he’s awake,” Harry added, waving his wand. It made a blueish purple shimmer settle over the kitchen, floating towards any openings like doors and windows before sinking into them. “A basic containment spell,” Harry clarified. “It won’t do any harm and if an emergency should occur - like a house fire - it dispels automatically. You’re safe. Both of you are.” He spoke the last words while making eye contact with Remus again, who nodded. Then, he pulled back further, and closed the door between the kitchen and the living room. Draco slowly let go of his death grip on the back of Harry’s auror robes, flexing his now painful fingers and rolling his wrists. He could feel Harry’s gaze on him, concerned and heavy, but kept his eyes low. Raising his eyes would mean he agreed with Harry’s actions, would mean he deferred to his Alpha, would grant his Alpha relief. And childish as it may be, Draco did not want to grant Harry that relief. Even if it meant he could not grant it to himself either.
‘I didn’t just leave her to court you.’ Harry drew in a deep breath and continued, ‘whatever Ginny and I had, it never really worked and me meeting you was what made it very clear to me that I didn’t want to be with her anymore. After visiting you at the manor Ginny and I talked about it and we broke up amicably. She doesn’t have any other place to live so we agreed that me could move to the fourth floor and that was it.’
“Yeah,” he replied, though his tone was a little weak. He splashed some cold water in his face before walking back to the kitchen. The curry made the back of his throat tickle, but when he swallowed a few times, the feeling went down.
Draco was eleven weeks pregnant when Harry started working again, though from home. They’d had to tell his boss that Draco was pregnant - he hadn’t wanted to give Harry any more leeway and this was the only thing that had softened the older man.
“I hope you’re happy.”  It sounded stiff and Draco blinked. “I am.”  He looked at Harry and couldn’t suppress a little smile. “Harry is the best Alpha I’ve ever had. I love him.”
‘It was nice to meet you, bye, Neville,’ Draco answered awkwardly.
he thought, but nodded nonetheless.
Miss Parkinson opened the door, stepping inside, ‘Blaise, I have someone that would like to talk to you.’
“Sign what?” Harry stepped into the kitchen, pulling off his sooty robe and hanging it away. Beneath his work robes, he was wearing a navy blue sweater and dark grey jeans, a look Draco wished he’d see his mate more often in.
‘It sounds like fun,’ Draco quickly stepped in, before Harry and Hermione got in an argument again.
Harry hummed in understanding.
Enjoy!
A silence fell over them, and it remained quiet for a few minutes. Draco eventually broke the silence, and asked, “and you? How did you meet your mate?”
‘And do they ever discipline you?’
Harry ground his teeth together. “Draco, I do not agree with this. Azkaban is dangerous. Sirius might be too. You’re pregnant. Who knows what they’ll do to you.”
Harry sighed, a little hopeless. “Why don’t you come with me?”
After the imprisonment, Myrion was closed for a few months, until Blaise Zabini gained all the permits to re-open Myrion. He became the new principle and implemented a few changes immediately; a lot of subjects were cut and Myrion became open to sensitive Betas as well as Omegas. Alphas still aren’t welcome though.
‘I already have the bathwater running for you. Come on.’ Harry took his memory-self with him. Draco could see now how concerned Harry was. He tried to follow the pair back up, but felt the pulling sensation wash over him as he was pushed out of the memory.
‘But shouldn’t we – oh sweet Merlin – kiss or something?’
Draco managed to stay with them for an hour, feeling incredibly bored and out of place, and then got up. ‘I think I’ll go to bed as well now. I’m tired.’ The fact that it was only half past eight made his lie uncredulous, but both Harry and Hermione nodded and wished him a good night.
‘I know, I know, it’s okay, I’m here, you’re safe here,’ Mrs Weasley comforted him and rocked him softly until the panic left his body. She kept on holding tight thought, and after a while, said, ‘did you want to report this to the ORO? They can help you decide if Harry has… abused you… and if… if any other things need to be done.’
Draco plucked a handkerchief out of his pocket and tied it around his nose and mouth. “Yes.”
wasn’t inappropriate – and pulled him along. ‘Come on, we only have an hour and you need to see it all if you want to give Adelaide that detailed report.’
I'm not sure how I feel about this chapter. It has some things that I'm proud of and really like, but some of it is just kinda bleh to me. Hopefully I'll be back on my feet for next week's chapter!
It took the better part of two weeks to get everything surrounding the courtship settled, even with Harry pulling on all the strings he could.
“I just... assumed he knew...” Harry whispered. He looked at Draco again and this time, Draco didn’t look at the floor, but looked back at his Alpha. “Do you trust me?”
“I remember the salty air… it was windy,” Lupin continued to volunteer information. “I’d run away from home a few months prior, and had settled in Cornwall because it was easy, and there was no magical community.”
Draco whined again, “please…” and the effect it had on Harry was instantaneous. He crowded Draco back against a wall, making him step out of his trousers, murmuring, “I’m here, I’m here. His fingers settled over Draco’s hips, flexing his fingers over vulnerable bones. It made Draco buck his hips. Harry laughed a low, hoarse laugh before sliding his lips over Draco’s again. His kiss was rough, and possessive, and Draco leaned into it, allowing Harry to take over command again. He let one of his hands brush past Harry’s thigh, while the other tugged on his boxers. It made the Alpha growl and Draco whimpered in response, “I’m yours, I’m yours,” somehow feeling Harry needed that confirmation.
day already, I’m sorry!’ She opened the door more and Draco curiously peered behind her, finding that the room was a light and French-ish decorated office.
Adelaide grabbed Draco by the wrist and dragged him into the store, ‘come on, I can’t wait to see what they all have!’
“Don’t you want to look around Edinburg for a while?” Harry asked.
“Draco’s pregnant.” Remus’ tone had an edge, as if someone had sharpened a blade over his vocal chords, and it had left a hard-to-heal wound.
Every muscle in his body ached. Even moving his fingers made him moan in pain. He wanted to lie in bed forever and die here. Right now would be a great time to die. No-one wanted him. He was alone and he would be forever.
Harry sat down as well, not responding and Draco watched as Astoria flawlessly sat down, using the technique that he had never really perfected. Feeling the pressure of three pairs of eyes watching him, he sat down slowly, making use of a different way to sit down.
‘Good morning, Draco.’
‘Hermione, Adelaide is pregnant. I didn’t want her walking all those stairs.’
‘I’ll run another bath,’ Harry said as he helped Draco out of his current one.
“Look at that, don’t they look nice,” Healer Roberts commented before pointing out all the features of their child like she had done before. She manipulated the image with a light wave of her wand, and Draco was sure he recognised at least some of the shape. It looked decidedly more human-shaped than last time.
Draco placed a hand on his stomach, patting it lightly. “I’d love to, but I’m
“Thanks,” Draco answered, trying to sound like he was in less pain than he actually was. Harry kneeled next to the nest, uncorked one of the vials he’d brought and handed it to Draco, who drank it quickly, trying not to seem greedy. Almost immediately, a pleasant warmth started radiating from his core, reaching every sore spot in his body and relieving the pain within minutes. “Fuck, that stuff is good,” he said. Harry, seemingly more comfortable now, chuckled, “we did pay more than enough for their top notch quality stuff.”
Someone shouted, he couldn’t make out what. ‘I’m getting him out of here, now! Deal with the parents,’ was the crude answer from his saviour.
“Just don’t think about it,” Draco interrupted. “We're here now, we'll just have to see what they can do for us.” He kissed Harry again, this time lingering a little. As the door opened and  Bella came in with a tray, another woman followed. Draco quickly rubbed his cheek against Harry’s in what he hoped was a comforting fashion before pulling back. Both women were looking at them and he blushed a little.
The tugging on Draco’s abdomen restarted and he closed his eyes for a second, feeling incredibly tired already. It wasn’t long before Bella presented their second child with a wide smile, handing her to Harry with the announcement that they had two girls.
‘No…’ Blaise slowly considered the question, ‘although…’
Harry swallowed and shook his head. ‘You need a cold bath first. Come on.’ He slid his arms underneath Draco’s body, lifting him up and holding him close. Draco moaned a little and tried to lean into his Alpha more.
“Come on baby,” Harry murmured as he dragged Draco along with him towards their bed. When they were close enough, Harry let his weight fall to the side, letting them fall into the bed. Draco playfully rolled over, away from his mate, only to be caged within Harry’s arms and legs seconds later.
He ended up catching a few more hours of fitful sleep before waking because of a sharp pain in his abdomen. Using one of the breathing exercises he’d learned at Sunny Springs, he started to breathe through it. This wasn’t the first time he was having Braxton Hicks contractions. “Stupid fake-ass contractions,” he grumbled to himself.
He got up, pacing around the drawing room, waiting for them to arrive.
Here's chapter 6! (Finally) I know that currently I'm uploading a chapter every 3-4 months on average right now and I do feel a little guilty about that, but with uni and the fact that I have to study 40-50 hours a week, this is the most I can produce.
Draco smiled his most submissive smile. ‘Thank you, sir.’
‘THEY ALL WENT TO MYRION!’ Hermione shouted triumphantly as she stumbled out of the floo, carrying a stack of file folders and looking more dishevelled than Draco had ever seen her. She threw the stack of folders on Harry’s desk and sank down on the couch next to Draco. ‘I think this might be the breakthrough we’ve been looking for.’ It sounded like she couldn’t quite believe it yet.
Draco shook his head. His legs would not hold him now, not now that he was burning and hot and wet… oh god, he was so wet.
So... How was it? No big confrontation with Riddle (I really wouldn't know how to write that anyway...) but I do feel like all the loose ends are tucked away nicely.
Now, Draco bared his teeth, “we’ll see who bites who when my heat comes.”
‘How?’
Writing pensieve memories is SO HARD OKAY. I
‘I’m bored,’ he answered, whilst inspecting his nails to make him look even more bored.
Draco hesitated, he
, purposely walking around and cluttering together, like ants. ‘What is this place?’ he asked, turning his head to see even more.
Draco opened the doors and inspected the amount of space. ‘I think that’ll do. Neither of us own a lot of clothes anyway. How much is… a hundred and forty pounds in galleons?’
Draco waved his hand dismissively. ‘Just someone that has caught my attention.’
That night, as Harry and Draco settled into bed, Harry asked, “are you and Adelaide okay?”
“I feel like shit,” Draco replied drily. “Like you said, they cut me open less than 24 hours ago. What time is it?”
“Your observation skills continue to baffle me.” Draco turned back around and busied himself with the garlands, tinsel and baubles. “Could you hand me the bells?”
Draco laughed light-heartedly. ‘And then they things about clingy Omegas… I was just upstairs, talking to Hermione.’ Harry’s hand found its usual place in the small of Draco’s back and he sighed a little, enjoying even these light touches.
As the days passed by, Draco grew more and more restless. Saying goodbye to Harry every morning was horrible and the fact that he sometimes went out on missions that took more than a day, making the Alpha absent from Draco’s life for sometimes two or three days, was terrifying. Sometimes he even had nightmares about Harry leaving him for such a mission. The thought that his Alpha might die in action –
‘Get over here. Now.’
‘And are you ready?’
. I know I have a dangerous job, and I… The idea that something might happen to me… leaving you and baby alone… I can’t stand it.” He let one of his hands sink down, sliding it over Draco’s hip before settling over his non-existent bump.
Draco quickly looked at Harry, who again smiled that hopeful smile, making Draco wonder what he was thinking.
Draco moved his chair so he could lean into Harry, though Harry’s lap would really be his preferred sitting place. “Edinburg.”
‘Go into the bedroom, at least.’ Harry’s voice sounded hoarse.
“Harry?”
Or at least were polite enough not to mention it.
‘Yes…’ Draco said a bit hesitant. ‘I liked it.’
Harry lifted his hand, wiping away the tears from his eyes roughly. “Yeah.” His voice was heavy with emotion. “I’m just… really happy.” He pressed his lips against Draco’s for a gentle, quick kiss, and lingered close after that. Draco stretched up a little, allowing Harry to bury his head in the crook of his neck. He ran his fingers through Harry’s hair in a soothing gesture, murmuring a low, “me too.”
Hermione sighed, but acceded, “I won’t, Draco.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You can also turn them off,” Mara said from a few feet away. She had learned that coming too close made Draco nervous, and did her utmost best to not trigger his over-active instincts. “Just a tap on the bottom should do it. It makes sure that they don’t go off during nap time.”
The witch thumbed through a notebook on the counter, mumbling to herself. Draco took the time to assess the establishment a bit more, noting the aged look of the exposed brick and the heavy use of velvet for the furniture. He would never use velvet upholstery for his house, even though it could work in some rooms in Grimmauld Place. It was too tacky.
‘Mrs – Molly?’ he asked carefully, because it seemed an intricate job and he didn’t want to disturb her.
She seemed happy and well-taken care off, which was most important. Although he sometimes wondered if maybe she was into older ladies. Adelaide was young enough to have more children than just the one she had now, and Mrs Weasley was an Alpha, so technically she and Adelaide could conceive another child. Draco knew Mrs Weasley kind off wanted more children and wondered if Adelaide’s boy was enough or maybe…
“I’m never skipping leg day again,” he groaned.
and it was so
“You can both stay the night at ours, if you want to,” Harry amended the statement, releasing his grip on Tonks a little more, but keeping her close nonetheless.
‘And that made you feel upset?’
But however nice it was to have Harry visiting this often, Draco started to feel locked at the Burrow. He couldn’t go anywhere and the property wasn’t as large as he was used to. There was very limited space to roam free and Mrs Weasley was always
“I do.” Harry sighed. “I just… I don’t know - I like working, and having a job, but I want to make a choice that’s good for
go against a no-kill order, only to slay one of the most feared villains in wizarding history, whilst managing to keep a Ministry job. That’s awe-inspiring.” Draco plated them both dinner and placed his hand on Harry’s shoulder for a second as he passed by his mate, before sitting down across him at the table.
‘Yes, sir, on what name?’ The Beta started flipping through a book, just as Adelaide also stepped inside.
Moving around usually helped against the fake-ass contractions. “Practising for real labour, my ass,” he said grimly, “I’m getting a c-section, for fuck’s sake.” With some more huffing and grumbling, he managed to get out of bed. He slid his feet into a pair of house slippers and started to make his way downstairs, stopping every time the stupid Braxton Hicks decided to rear its ugly head again.
“Maybe I am,” Harry admitted with a wide, uncaring smile, before bending down and finally sucking Draco’s cock into his mouth. It made Draco gasp for breath and his hips stuttered forward with a moan. Harry’s fingers held his hips in place though, and he slowly set a tempo.
Hermione’s eyes slid over Draco in an obvious manner. For the first time, the Alpha’s eyes felt intrusive, and it made Draco cross an arm in front of his stomach.
“Gosh, it’s cold,” Draco murmured as he pulled his cape tighter around his body.
‘There’s a good boy…’ Harry panted and he grabbed Draco’s wrist, pulling him forwards and into an embrace while he used his other hand to push Draco’s arse down, trying to bury himself inside as deep as possible.
‘Didn’t think so,’ Hermione said, sounding smug.
With more time on his hands than he could handle he often found himself discussing weird things like that… with himself.
‘All right, if you don’t want to talk, what
Dinner was always a strained event at Malfoy manor, but tonight was a new record.
Strong arms lifted him out of his bed, with blankets and all. It didn’t hurt all, not like it had hurt the other times he was lifted out of his bed. He was pushed against a warm, broad, flat chest and snuggled closer, feeling safe.
“Okay,” Draco murmured to himself, adjusting the sunshade on the stroller one more time. “Okay. Let’s go.”
“He’s a convicted criminal,” Harry sighed. “I’m an auror. It’s
“Yeah, it is my stupid Alpha lizard brain,” he agreed, trying to use an appeasing tone. “But it’s me when I say I think you’re beautiful. I love you for
Harry pulled his hand away. Draco whimpered, ‘please…’
“Fifteen,” Lupin chuckled. “Freshly presented, too. I had no idea how to handle my life, how to handle the knowledge of what I was. My parents had always treated me like any other, and the switch from that to being perceived as weak and vulnerable was awful. It was part of the reason I ran away.” He sighed, but it didn’t sound heavy. It sounded nostalgic. “It was a great summer.”
(See the end of the chapter for
A few days passed. Remus kept up with his correspondence, but Draco didn’t ask about it. It felt private.
It was not a good night. Draco tossed and turned, pulling the sheets over his body and kicking them back off again.
With a scowl, she uncrossed her arms and left the kitchen.
“There’s a good boy,” Harry murmured, his voice hoarse and breath hot against Draco’s skin
‘What?’
“We will, thank you.” Draco took the pillow, paid with the money Harry had given him earlier and joined his mate again. While Bella and Healer Roberts were kind and helpful, he’d rather not stick around.
‘So do you agree?’
“And of how many heats has this been occurring?”
Draco groaned. ‘I can’t.’
“I am,” Draco answered. “Thirteen weeks now.”
Draco grinned, unable to suppress this weird, happy, sated feeling that washed over him, ‘no, knowing where you just put your mouth. Brush your teeth first.’
Draco thought about her question for a while and sipped from his tea in the meantime. “I think I may have been a bit restless before the last two... different than usual...” He hesitated about how to tell healer Roberts about the other things and looked at the floor. “I, uhh... during... I’m always... I mean I always need Harry to ahm... to knot me but... it’s been... really bad... last time.”
“Just go away, damn it,” Harry growled, and soon enough, footsteps moved away from the door.
‘No,’ Draco confirmed as he wrapped himself in a towel quickly. ‘I need…’
“But...?” Hermione gently coaxed him into continuing.
“Aha.” She looked at Draco again. “How old are you?”
‘I’m sure that can be arranged,’ Draco smiled.
“I mean it, Draco.” Harry sounded a lot more serious now. “Maybe I haven’t given it that much thought, yet, but I would like to have kids and if you want them now then that is something I want, too.”
“We live on Ministry property,” Harry interjected, “please send everything to the Ministry sorting service. They’ll ensure everything will end up at our home.” He slid forward a business card with his name, function, and the address Mara had to use.
‘Go to sleep, Draco.’
‘I – ’
‘I don’t,’ Harry gritted out. ‘It’s my instinct. We barely know each other. Having a baby would be a disastrous idea.’
“I’m glad to hear that,” Remus replied, his tone completely neutral.
‘I know… Can you stand?’
Draco settled into a beach chair as Harry put up the parasol. “That’s better,” he sighed, enjoying the shade already. “I still can’t believe the stupid heat of the French summers.”
It's been a while since I wrote a cliffhanger like that, so I hope you like it!
Draco, face hidden against Harry’s shoulder, nodded.
that is was abnormal to have that many reports of possible abuse!’
So he did.
“Okay so we need...” Harry squinted at the list he wrote on a scrap piece of parchment. Draco snatched it out of his hand, sighing, “I can’t believe you are incapable of reading your own handwriting.” He smoothed out the crinkled piece and read out loud, “a gift for Ron, Hermione, Molly, Adelaide... Harry, you just wrote down most of the people we know.”
‘Oh, no, my father’s a Beta,’ Luna explained. ‘My mother was an Alpha but she passed away a few years ago…’
He leaned into her touch and tried not to cry, in which he failed miserably. ‘I… he left,’ he sobbed. Mrs Weasley guided him back to a chair and sat him down. ‘Now now, no need to be so sad because Harry left, I’m sure he had to go back to work or do something else. Not all of us have the liberty to be at home all day. He is a busy man.’ She handed him a handkerchief. He wiped away his tears and tried to push away the overwhelming feeling that he had been rejected again.
‘No.’
“Do you think he’ll get a pardon?” Draco eventually asked.
Draco slipped into Harry’s embrace and pecked him on the cheek. ‘Hi.’ He could feel Harry’s arms slowly wrapping around him and closed his eyes, expecting a kiss. ‘Where were you?’ Harry asked and he pressed his lips against Draco’s for a brief moment, ‘I couldn’t find you.’
‘It’s been a while,’ Astoria eventually whispered, keeping her head down.
Harry took the lead, and Draco tiredly trailed behind. When they were close enough, both Alpha and Omega paused to look at the company gathered: Remus, Hermione, and a woman Draco did not recognise, but, by the look in her eyes as she took in Draco, knew Draco somehow. Maybe she had been in his parents’ circles.
It was a quiet Friday morning when an owl flew through the open window of the garden, dropping a delicately wrapped package on Lupin’s lap before circling the kitchen and leaving it through the window it had used to come inside.
Hermione pursed her lips. ‘I don’t like this at all.’
“Did they seem… willing to negotiate the terms of Sirius’ remaining time?”
‘He might’ve mentioned something like that.’ Hermione seemed to hesitate, but decidedly asked, ‘do you feel like you’re lacking in something because you’re not able to do certain things with Harry outside of your heat?’
Harry stopped in his tracks, quiet in an instant. “I should…” He stepped back towards the door as if to leave the room, but stopped when Draco whined. “Please… stay…”
Harry chuckled. “Well, you heard Healer Roberts. It’s a 90 percent chance that all things go well.”
Draco looks up at Harry, who catches his eye and nods. They’re equally pink-cheeked, now. Draco takes one of Harry’s hands between both of his, and firmly smooths the salve in. His thumbs glide across Harry’s palm, working the salve in and working the tension out.
He unscrews the lid and scoops out nearly a full tablespoon.
And if Draco’s hand happens to tangle with Harry’s as they walk back to the castle, well. That’s just to verify that the salve is absorbing properly.
, Potter!
Really, he had been there to watch Harry interact with the students. Draco stares out at the frost-covered field, determined not to reveal anything. He can feel Harry looking at him.
Surely I was meant to know it was from you?”
Santa. You give a gift, like Santa, but it’s a secret. Like the Statute of Secrecy, but for Muggles! It’s in
“Or,” Harry mumbles softly, “You could keep helping me apply it after my tutoring sessions, since you’re so keen on watching them.”
Draco blushes again, but doesn’t mind as much as he had before.
Harry smirks at him. “I understand the nostalgic appeal of watching Quidditch practice, but what’s so fun about watching me tutor a bunch of wobbly kids?”
“Oh, come on,” Harry scoffs, eyebrows furrowed. “Brewing is your whole thing and you’ve smelt like whatever these herbs are all last week.” He blushes slightly, and pokes at the label. “Also, the brand on the label is an
Harry squints at him. “Yes, Malfoy, thank you, Malfoy, I’m forever in your debt, Malfoy,” he says, flatly. Harry grins expectantly, but when Draco is silent, he adds ruefully, “I know I should wear gloves when I fly, but I don’t like to. It makes my hands feel funny.”
Harry holds it out, and Draco takes it, then carefully scrapes most of the dollop on Harry’s hand back into the jar. He places it on the bench between them.
Draco splutters—Harry knows what he smells like?—then rallies, gathering the famous Malfoy haughtiness around him. “It’s not
“Walk me back?” Draco asks.
Aiming for nonchalance, Draco says, “Oh, look. You’ve finally got something to help those dreadfully chapped hands.” He wants to feel good about that delivery, but he doesn’t.
In for a Knut, in for a Galleon, he figures, and digs his knuckle into the knot of tension at the base of Harry’s thumb. Harry gasps softly.
“Really?” Harry asks. He sounds curious, but there’s something else in his expression that Draco can’t quite suss out.
Draco startles as Harry sits down next to him on the bench.
Harry just hums in response, his eyes slipping closed. Draco sets Harry’s hand gently down and takes his other hand.
to try to reveal your Secret Santa.”
Harry’s eyes crinkle, fond and knowing. He nods.
“Oh, you know.” Draco realizes he doesn’t have an excuse ready. He starts again, “It’s, you know. It’s good to keep tabs on how the students are doing, outside of their classes?” He hadn’t meant that to be a question.
“Alright,” says Harry slowly. He clears his throat, passes the jar from hand to hand for a moment, and then brandishes it. “I guess now would be a good time to try this out.”
Draco sniffs, mock-haughty. “Look, if an anagram was good enough for the Dark Lord, it’s good enough for me.”
“Well, it’s fine that you don’t know the technique,” Draco tells him. “Just– let me show you?” He’s already reaching for the jar.
Draco laughed lightly and wiggled his arse in what he hoped was an enticing way. “Well, why don’t you take what is yours, then?” His voice was nowhere near as husky as he’d imagined it, but he’d started it now so he’d finish it, too.
He could hear the door creak, and then soft, careful footsteps into the room. “I made tea…” Harry said in a quiet, low voice. Draco pushed himself upright and groaned when electrical jolts of pain shot through his abdomen, hips, lower back and arse. “Fuck,” he managed, immediately out of breath.
Draco studied Harry as he talked to Mrs Weasley. He found that Harry kept glancing at Draco, as if he was nervous or concerned.
‘She made me miserable,’ Harry affirmed. ‘We’re good as friends but that is all.’
“Do you want your friend to join you if Harry is unable to?” Healer Roberts’ eyes flitted over to Remus, who had gone a little paler than he usually.
Draco just laughed.
‘No no no, I can handle it, more,’ Draco babbled.
“I just changed the bedding. Didn’t wanna do it again,” Draco answered, not yet past his breathlessness. Harry laughed again.
Harry slowly let him go and sighed. ‘I guess we’ll have to go back then.’ He looked lost and a bit disappointed, so Draco bent his head down again, just a little bit, and pressed his lips against Harry’s for a quick kiss. Harry grinned, Draco could feel, and he revelled in the marvellous feel of feeling Harry smile against his lips, before pulling back. ‘We should really go upstairs,’ Draco said, trying to look strict, making Harry laugh. It sounded a bit hoarse and Draco suppressed a shudder, feeling that tinge of arousal come back up. Knowing that he had the skill to turn Harry on
Draco shook his head. “N-no.” His eyes passed over the body on the floor. “Is- is that…”
‘Omegas aren’t supposed to fight,’ Draco interrupted.
“We quickly realised that Riddle had escaped his cell - he had bribed a guard into polyjuice into him, and swapped them.”
“Potter,” Remus mumbled, sounding drunk. He pawed weakly at Sirius, trying to get him to come closer.
‘Oh god yes, bite me,’ Draco immediately mindlessly begged, ‘bite me, Harry.’ He pushed his head back further, hoping to entice Harry into finally biting him.
The experience was something he could only describe as completely weird. He felt tugging on his stomach for a few solid minutes, but everything was completely soundless until he heard Healer Roberts murmur something to Bella, quickly followed by a loudly wailing baby. From the corner of his eyes, Draco could see Bella wrap the child in a white piece of cloth, before moving past the screen and showing the child to Draco and Harry. “Would you like to hold her?”
‘Maybe, yes…’ Mrs Weasley agreed, clearly relieved not to have to talk about her daughter anymore.
Harry ordered for them, and Draco, uncaring, went to sit outside. The sun shone unusually bright for this time of the year, and Draco cursed it under his breath. Today was no day for sunshine. He wished it would rain.
Draco nodded, slowly realising where she was going with this. But by the time he had figured it out, Adelaide was already out of bed.
Footsteps walked into the corridor where he sat. He didn’t move.
Draco shrugged.  “I don’t know, but I don’t mind.” He hadn’t really told Harry about how often he visited the Burrow, not to see Adelaide or Molly, but to see the little baby. Harry had just assumed he missed Adelaide and Molly, and never asked.
‘I like it,’ Draco said innocently as he moved his hips back again. ‘It feels so good…’
He and Harry were feeding the girls in the nursery when he complained about it again. “I don’t get it. We can do all this weird and fantastic stuff with magic, but they couldn’t heal up my c-section with it. It
‘The Muggle world used to be – and still is – a lot less accepting of same-sex couples than the wizarding,’ Harry explained. ‘Now, what do you think about this one?’
‘Are you sure about this, Draco?’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘So do you understand that I am here to ask questions about your health and well-being?’
‘I was thinking about going to Ikea, actually,’ Harry said.
“I’m happy to hear that they did the job,” Draco answered with a smile. He had been having trouble sleeping himself, and had bought a weighted blanket to simulate the effect of Harry smothering him, moving the old blankets to the linen closet until Lupin asked for them.
“Mental health” was the title of the top one. After looking at the front for a while, he flipped it open. Once opened, the letters rearranged themselves into an informative text about a private fertility clinic situated in Edinburgh. It looked really pretty and the text was obviously aimed at Omegas, not Alphas.
“Okay,” Harry whispered. “Soon?”
As Draco wandered in, the Sirius Task Force - a name he admitted always made him chuckle - fell silent. It made him feel awkward, but he powered through, holding up two empty mugs and saying, “don’t mind me, I’m just refilling our coffee mugs.”
“You okay now?”
Harry tensed and looked at Molly, ‘he doesn’t know?’
They hadn’t bought anything for the baby yet - Draco wasn’t sure why Harry had not yet suggested it. He hasn’t said anything yet because somewhere, deep down - he felt fearful, afraid that they would fail, that he would never fall pregnant and then, be stuck with so many things they could never use.
‘Thank you,’ he murmured.
Harry laughed. ‘Sure, Draco, whatever you want.’
“How was your checkup?”
Which he did, eventually.
been rude. She was his only real friend, his only equal and to fight over something stupid was just… stupid.
Sirius took Draco in with new eyes. “I see.” He grunted as he lifted Remus over him, creating maximum contact.
Finally, on day eight, he and Harry decorated their bedroom together.
“I do believe your mother loved you,” the stranger corrected. “She always seemed less reliable than your father.” His tone was even, too.
‘Mrs Longbottom, such a pleasure to see you again, it’s been a while.’ Harry greeted the elderly lady. She wore hideous clothes.
“Panic?” Draco asked, just about ready to cry.
He regretted wearing them now, though.
Draco managed an indignant laugh and weakly hit Harry in his shoulder. “You promised we wouldn’t use archaic language in raising them.”
‘I know he will,’ Harry answered determined.
“Always,” Draco repeated, promised, confirmed.
.” His voice was steady and low. Harry was in auror modus.
“You’re pregnant,” the other Omega mumbled, his tone void of emotion.
Well, here's a weird, incoherent and fluffy chapter!
‘I believe these two could stay here, there is no need for them to be present during the inspection,’ Harry said in a concluding manner.
“Step away from him,” Draco repeated in a low, but non-threatening tone. To his surprise, the woman stepped back. First one step, then two, then a final third step. Draco kneeled, and crawled a little closer to the man. He sniffed. He smelled like honey, hay, soot and
‘Let’s go inside. I already informed Molly of our visit today. Why don’t you go first, Draco?’
Harry intertwined his fingers with Draco’s and smiled.
Or actually, I wanted to write it all in one go (Draco meeting the gang) but wanted to write it perfectly. I wanted to describe Grimmauld Place and many other things as well, because I felt that if I would "just" throw Harry's family in the mix it would feel awkward and strained.
Harry sighed. “I know, I’m just… You know.’
Obedience kicked in and he nodded. ‘Okay.’
He walked back to Harry and dropped the book on his desk. ‘Can I read this?’
“I can imagine.” Lupin seemed to crawl back into his shell. Out of embarrassment or discomfort, Draco couldn’t tell. If he had to hazard a guess, he’d say a combination of both.
Draco couldn’t remember how many glasses of wine he’d had – it had seemed like just one, or maybe two, but three hours later he couldn’t care less. He was pleasantly tipsy and he liked the world this way much more.
‘Fuck,’ Harry gasped.
“It’s amazing you managed to stay together,” Draco loaded up his paint roller again, turning to the last wall they had to paint. “That must’ve required a lot of determination.”
Harry laughed breathlessly and pushed back in, coming hard and tying him and Draco together.
Here's to hoping I'll have another chapter done soon...
he thought, feeling a bit disappointed. It was really fun to play with the children that were at the day-care at Myrion. He’d been annoyed first when Harry dropped him here so he could look around on his own, but now…
“I’ll write you in as one of my safehouse guests,” Harry offered. “You can stay as long as you need to.” After some hesitation, he added, “and see Tonks as much as you want, of course.”
‘I’m not going to either.’ Draco took a sip of his tea, trying to hide behind his cup. ‘I had to tell Mrs Weasley and Hermione and that was difficult enough.’
Harry wrapped his arms tightly around Draco, whispering, “you’re safe, you’re okay, I’m here, you’re safe…” He waited for Draco’s breathing to even out before carefully letting one of his hands pass over his mate. “Did they hurt you?”
‘Uhm. Hello,’ Draco said, feeling out of place. Luckily, Harry stepped in behind him and wrapped his arms around Draco. ‘Hi there, I’ve spoken Lydia about an appointment?’
Draco moved back a little, pushing his hips back in Harry’s lap, moaning a little. ‘You took good care of me.’
Draco fled down the stairs and back into the kitchen.
‘I won’t.’ It had felt a bit like an order, so Draco tried to obey. The need to submit, to show his Alpha how good he was, how obedient, burned inside him and this half-assed order wasn’t enough to sate that specific need.
Draco’s eyes closed again and he moaned willingly when Harry pushed a second finger in, and then a third. The bed creaked when Harry shifted into a different position and used his other hand to gently palm Draco’s cock. ‘Damn it, you’re so tight,’ the Alpha groaned.
Draco sniffed up the air a little bit, trying to determine if Ron was an Omega as well – which he thought was unlikely, because Omegas didn’t work – and decided Ron was probably a beta.
‘We should shower.’
Molly pushed a cup of tea in his direction, looking at him encouragingly, so he continued, “healer Roberts warned us that any of the treatments, whichever we choose, can leave me irrational, clingy and with irregular heats so...”
Draco stepped forwards and into Harry’s arms. “Oh, Harry.”  He pecked his Alpha on the cheek. “I love it.”
“Okay.” He finished his cup of tea and got up. Maybe he’d take a nap. He was kind of tired.
They waited a few minutes, until Adelaide didn’t look as if she was going to sick up all over the place. In the meantime, Harry offered Draco his arm and Draco took it, hooking his arm through Harry’s and pulling him closer possessively. Harry smiled at that and stepped closer to Draco. ‘Ready to go?’
Harry scanned the list. “Yeah, a few.”
Entering Crossroads, Draco felt at home instantly. He had only been to the bookstore a few times now, but was glad Molly had introduced him to it.
Harry pushed himself up, bringing Draco along with him. His hair was all messed up, and Draco brought up a hand to correct it, flattening Harry’s unruly hair with a smile on his face. In the meantime, Harry waved his hand again, dispelling the containment spell. “You can come in.”
Looking at the ground but also leaning into Hermione’s soft, friendly touch, he nodded.
So Draco turned away from Hermione and watched Ginny step out the door. Now that he paid more attention, he noticed how she stiffened when she saw how close the memory-Draco and Harry were. She did the whole greeting thing, complimented Draco and then dropped the bomb, making his memory-self flee.
‘You don’t have to understand it,’ Harry said, fighting to stay calm. ‘And if I may remind you, this is my house and I am the real Alpha in this household. If you don’t like what’s happening here, feel free to leave.’
‘Good boy,’ Harry praised him and suddenly Draco couldn’t hold back anymore. He cried out, shuddering when he came. Harry kept on grazing that spot inside him, making Draco gasp for breath and come until he thought he would faint from it.
“I saw that,” Harry laughed light-heartedly.
‘I don’t!’ Harry said in a raised voice and Draco tried his best not to cower away from the fighting Alphas. ‘I want it this way!’
Harry backed down, but didn’t apologize.
‘Did you contact the Auror Office?’ Harry asked, following her, forcing Draco to do the same.
Hermione blinked, eyes widening, ‘excuse me?’
he could still go into heat and if so, how close he’d be to one. It was more than unusual for male Omega’s to have heats past the age of 30, and Remus was certainly older than that. Maybe it had something to do with the limited contact and constant bond sickness. “I could ask Harry if he’d be amenable to vouch for you. I don’t think I’d be able to sway Hermione on her own.” He lowered his tone, adding, “she doesn’t seem to like you - either of you. Do you suspect…?”
“Have a nice day,” she added and then turned towards the next customer. Relieved, Draco made way to the exit. He could feel through the bond that Harry was near –
Draco glanced at Harry, waiting in a chair far enough away that he was sure he hadn’t heard. “Yes, thank you.”
Harry sat in one of the rickety kitchen chairs, looking calm, relaxed and at ease. Draco’s heart jumped and then he cursed himself. He was not in heat anymore, there was no need for his body to respond to Harry – or should he go back to saying Mr Potter?
“I know…” he murmured. “It’s just…” He looked at the baby in his arms so he didn’t have to look at anything else. The light weight was comforting and made it easier to speak on. “It’s just that every time… the last three heats… I had this bump… you know…”
Harry shifted in his seat.
‘You’ve never seen a moving staircase?’
Then, the fire faded, even if it was just for a few minutes.
‘Uhm. Harry and Hermione are downstairs, in the kitchen. Hermione wants to show me Harry’s memories of erm – what I told you about. Is that okay?’
Draco flipped the page in his book, inwardly happy that it hadn’t come to a confrontation. He spent a lot of time with the two Alphas, visiting Grimmauld Place five days out of the week during office hours. Harry visited on the weekends, so he saw his Alpha daily. He saw Hermione almost as frequently as Harry and confrontations between the two made him feel uneasy. Harry had been more dominant the last week or so and even though he wasn’t the type of Alpha that always wanted to be right (which was impossible with Hermione near), Draco had noticed that Harry actively contested Hermione. His presence seemed to both help, and make it worse. Harry was calmer with Draco near, but at the same time easily agitated and somewhat overprotective. Is was because of this that Mrs Weasley had decided it was better for Draco to visit Grimmauld Place more.
‘Just let me know when you want to see me again, or if you want to talk, okay?’ Hermione requested and Draco nodded. ‘Of course.’
“After that?”
Draco stared at the table, determined not to look at Hermione. ‘I don’t – I wanted – I had no idea Harry had been with others.’
‘Violet…’ he whispered again.
The woman - Draco could now smell she was an Alpha, and he was unsurprised - made a frustrated, desperate noise. “Please.”
‘And then what?’
Draco half-sighed, half-laughed. “Poor Ron.”
Due to someone noting that I should spend some more time on editing/grammar/spelling, I spend a lot more time in this chapter. I hope that is something you can notice.
‘About his heats, about whether or not we treat him right and then he made our child undress, because apparently Potter had orders to check for signs of physical abuse! As if we would EVER do such a thing to our precious boy!’
They didn’t.
“You’re drinking caffeine?” Hermione sounded judgemental.
‘Better?’ Harry stood next to the tub, his eyes dark and lust-filled as he looked at his Omega.
Draco hesitated, but Harry didn’t. “Is it really that easy? I read all this stuff about different types of bonds and it seemed pretty complicated.”
‘Well, would you like to join us?’
‘Oh no you don’t. I and I alone touch you.’ Harry sounded stern and very Alpha-y.
‘We should eat something.’ Harry broke the silence, standing up and moving towards the office door. ‘Are you coming?’ he asked when Draco remained sitting on the couch.
leaflets.
PREPARE FOR AN EXTRA LONG CHAPTER!
‘Well, not that but – you
When I didn’t answer, Hermione said, “You’re thinking of Voldemort aren’t you?”
Well, no one seemed to like this Harry. Trouble was, I didn’t know if I liked this version of myself either, but I sure as hell won’t go back to being a shell for someone to fill up. If this plane is going down, I’m at least going down sitting in the pilot’s seat.
Harry has a lot to be sorry about and he finally apologizes to Draco.
Mr. Potter’s voice was a low rumble when he spoke, “Frivolity can be enjoyable on occasion. Can it not?”
It wasn’t until the Dark Lord spoke about Potter that Draco snapped to attention. “Yes, it is a great victory to have captured such a nuisance. I believe that having the wizarding world know I posses their last hope helps to keep them compliant.”
In answer, Potter shrugged. Then he did something odd. He turned to face Draco and reached a hand up to stroke his face. Potter’s fingers were shaky as they trailed down from his cheek to his jaw. “She was right, you know? You are silver-tongued, charming, and beautiful.”
“I am not indifferent. I am simply…” Draco paused, searching for a word. His brain would not supply him with one. Well, not one that would help his case.
“Right, perfect. Whenever you’re ready, Potter.”
“Read over the file,” Robards continued, ignoring the rising chatter about the very hot demon killer. “Find her.”
After his session with Potter, Draco allowed himself to retire to his room until dinner. He found he needed to decompress after being around Potter for extended periods of time. With the addition of physicality to their dynamic, new and frankly unwanted feelings began to surface.
Harry hovered in a corner of the pitch, watching for a flick of gold against the darkness. He felt his heart pounding in his chest. It was nearly as bad as the time he had to face the dragon in the Triwizard tournament. He wasn’t sure if it was the adrenaline of the game, or who he was playing with, but his body felt as alive as the snitch had in his pocket.
“Apparently someone was,” Ron said. He took a seat next to Hermione on the couch and tugged the blanket over his lap, too. “She’s obsessed with me, Harry. Always watching. It’s creepy really.”
Beside him in the hall, Draco felt Pansy’s presence. She shifted her frame to stand taller, no doubt knowing her long, exposed neck would be appealing to suitors. The pale expanse that sloped down to her cleavage begged for lips to whisper promises of love upon them. That and her hourglass figure would attract even the cleverest pray into the spider's web.
She drew a deep breath and moved to stand on the side of sink so she could see my face. “Get help, Harry. You’re no good to anyone like this, especially yourself. I heard what you did. That boy. Sure you got him out of a bad situation, but the way you did it…how did that actually help? That kid is traumatized and you nearly killing his father likely only added more trauma. You let all this rage build up and it has to go somewhere. When you were fighting a war, it went to that, but…now it has nowhere to go but inside.”
He remembered how she sat there reading to him while he sat under the table and leaned against her legs. She would place a hand on the crown of his head and ruffle his hair whenever the tension in the story rose. The memory turned sour quickly when he herd footsteps approaching from behind him.
They were sitting on a bench in the faculty office waiting for Snape to return with McGonagall. Harry worried that this would finally wear McGonagall’s patience thin. Stealing from Snape wasn’t exactly a good reason to break to rules, not like all the times he broke them to keep Hogwarts safe.
“Stupid, stupid,” Draco mumbled to himself as he poured a cup of camomile tea. He sipped it, and it burned his tongue. “Doubly stupid, Draco. Way to burn your tongue.”
Draco lowered his head. If he was going to do this, say this, then he couldn’t look Potter in the eye. He trembled, his tired, potion-addled brain made it hard to think, hard to form a coherent thought, but he managed. “Because I know him, Potter, and he could never feel the same way.”
“Hmm,” Hagrid said, scratching at his beard with his free hand. He looked back and forth between Harry and Malfoy. “Fin’, don’ tell me. The look on Snape’s face, though, that was a sigh’. Glad I didn' miss it, I am.”
She cooed softly like a mother shushing a child, promising there were no monsters under the bed. “I can sense it, a block in your Life Energy. You won’t allow yourself to feel love, why?”
Harry felt his heart flutter in wholehearted agreement. “Then I’m thinking not so silly after all.”
Draco stuck his tongue out at the face and spoke to his reflection again, but softer this time as if to comfort himself. “Count to ten and breathe. It is just a party. There are just everyday, normal people out there. It’s a good time. Yule Ball afterparty is supposed to be a fun excuse to drink, so go have fun.”
“Oh, shut up, Reed. Let’s hope the ethics board isn’t soft on him like our Minister for Magic,” Lamont said. “He should have fired him, not put him on desk duty looking into the uptick in illegal magical surges. That’s what drove him to kick the guys arse in the first place. Putting him on those cases seems like an odd sort of punishment.”
“Her almost victim.” Draco took the Lock Box out and extended his hand towards Robards. “We got her.”
Hermione had the grace to look ashamed. “Right. Sorry. I just need this to go well. You know I am up for that promotion as Advisor for the Minister for Magic. I’d be the youngest to do it.”
“And what is your type then?”
“So what’s the question?” Potter asked.
“I lost track of the time.”
“So I’ve been told.”
“Sir.” Harry nodded. “I was just on my way up to meet you.”
Hermione smiled. “That is the plan.”
“You’re sure about this, sir?” Ron asked.
Malfoy shuddered at Voldemort's name, but he maintained his composure this time. “Is that what you were chasing out here? You were trying to find that thing out here?”
“Harry, that’s not how it works and you know it.” Draco pulled one of his hands free and cupped Harry’s face. He stroked his thumb alone Harry’s cheekbone, wiping away the tears that had fallen. “There’s no rush. We can wait until I make things right, until it's settled.”
Breathless, Draco pulled back and Harry found himself leaning forward, trying to recapture his lips. “Why did you stop?” he asked, surprised by the husky tone of his voice. “I didn’t want to stop.”
“Potter, slow the fuck down, will you?” His voice was shaky and out of breath. He must have sprinted to catch up with me. He’d been on the other side of the cemetery fence when I took off and somehow managed to catch up.
“Er, no. I suppose I don’t.” Draco tucked a stray piece of hair behind his ear as he spoke. He felt the top of his ear and it was hotter than a kettle. He wondered if Potter noticed how red the tips of his ears must be.
Yet other nights, nights like the last, Draco had the displeasure of reliving every excruciating moment. The details so sharp and so poignant that he would wake with the sickening taste of lavender oil in his mouth. After those nights, waking was as impossible as it was unpleasant.
Through the haze of his own desire, Harry barely noticed his own pants being yanked off inelegantly. Barely noticed how he ended up on all fours with Draco positioned behind him—cock teasing his hole.
Hermione noticed us first. “Well, nice of you two to finally show up.” She was drinking champagne. When she caught sight of our wet clothes she added, “Get caught in the rain?”
“Psh, I can admit it.” Everything around him blurred, until all he saw was her. He wanted to make her happy, so he continued, admitting something he had never voiced to another person, something he rarely even let himself think about. “It’s just, I don’t deserve to be loved—not until I make everything
“Has anything shown up dead that isn’t supposed to be here?” Harry asked, clarifying Malfoy’s point.
“Because you fight it. The visions are coming because they are trying to tell you something about the beast. It may not always be literal. Sometimes they are pieced together using parts of your own life to help you make sense of it better.”
“Lamont, Reed, lovely day to you,” I said, doing nothing to mask the animosity in my voice. “Better than your case is treating you, I reckon. According to the reports I’ve filed, you have no leads.” I cocked my head to the side and tried my best to look smug even though the world was spinning around me. Stupid hangovers. “Haven’t gotten any closer to finding your missing kneazle? I hear little Janey is very worried. With such a high profile case, if you need any help…let me know.”
Malfoy didn’t look at him, but nodded. “Just the potion settling.”
This led Draco to believe that Mr. Potter was every bit the man he thought him to be and every bit as likely to think that Draco was below his status. In school, they had a rivalry and Mr. Potter never kept quiet about his overwhelming dislike of Draco and the sort he aligned himself with. When Draco had power and finances and could not bring himself to care about one man's opinion, even if that man was Harry J. Potter.
I shook my head. “I don’t care.”
“Can I switch it?” Draco asked hopefully.
Harry pulled in a deep breath, thinking about it. “We do.”
The elderly couple in front of us turned at the mention of his name and the woman shushed us. The man shook his head in disappointment. Hermione gave them a nasty look and they turned back around.
Ron’s eyes widened with shock. “Oh, of course, that’s what George meant by ‘better leave the boys to it,’ after he walked away from you. I didn’t know what he meant then, but…oh Merlin, were you two going to do it at the party?”
Amid the after dinner rush of students in the Great Hall, Malfoy stalked over and pinned Harry in a corner. It reminded Harry of a very aggressive Flamingo attacking the water. All legs and pointy nose, but still sort of eye-catching. He narrowed his eyes and fixed Harry with a serious look then mumbled, “You
Stupidly, the only spell that came to mind was Rictusempra, so he shot it off in the direction of the gray blob. It missed her and hit the victim still unconscious on the slab. His body jerked and then the man shot up as if awoken from a nightmare.
“The pleasure is mine, I am sure,” Nikola replied. His accent was heavy, but he seemed to know English well enough. Once he finished shaking hands with Lucius, he turned his attention to Draco and smiled. It was a pleasant smile. An innocent smile. “And you are?”
I hadn’t been afraid of crowds until I started at Hogwarts. I couldn’t move anywhere in wizarding communities without people coming up to me, asking about my scar, wanting to touch me for luck, and a plethora of other ridiculous requests. It was worse now, after the battle. Now, I was an adult and apparently hot enough to warrant every inappropriate offer this side of the Atlantic.
“Hasn't it?” Harry asked petulantly. Of course he knew maybe he was being overly moody about the whole thing, but falling in love with someone who might not even care that you had fallen in love with them was much more perturbing than he could have ever imagined.
Harry’s throat was dry again and he felt the same warmth from earlier return but more slowly this time, like a cloud moving out of the way of the sun. The warmth hit in small increments until it was everywhere. He shook his head because he was definitely not letting himself go all warm and fuzzy over Draco Malfoy.
“You’ve been looking into them.”
“Yes, Father. If only.”
“Are you insane?”
“Maybe.” I glanced at him out of the corner of my eye. His jaw was clenched. His eyes were focused ahead of us as if he could see the fading magical trace, too.
