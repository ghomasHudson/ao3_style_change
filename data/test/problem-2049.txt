“You’re not,” Hermione said, still righteously indignant. “Not while Ron and I are around anyway. As if I’d ever let you be stuck.” She snorted. From his vantage point, Harry could see the depth of affection in the look Ron gave her. Ron didn’t even try to mask it, letting it shine through everything. Harry looked away and tried not to want that.
Draco stared at him for a moment, quiet. Their breath mingled together and Harry looked up, counting Draco’s eyelashes so he wouldn’t talk. He could tell that Draco didn’t want him to talk. The silence felt restful and necessary as Draco looked and looked at him and then his fingers were in Harry’s hair and he was tugging at it, urging Harry up to capture his mouth in a kiss which felt like comfort. Harry could feel Draco seeking and yearning, and he gave and he gave and he gave, kissing him back like he was drowning.
“Yeah but you weren’t, were you? You’re here. You’re very you. You’re very uniquely yourself and whatever happened — that’s not you now. You’ve told me that and I believe you.” Harry stepped closer, nearly treading on the toes of Draco’s shoes. “You are yourself. You’re still here. She didn’t mean that.”
By the time Hermione was finished they had a sizable list. It was surrounded by smaller lists, branching off, smaller goals. He told her he wanted to fix up Grimmauld and she added it; he told her he wanted to visit the goblins, unofficially, and she added it; he told her he wanted to get his hair cut and she added that too, approaching every addition with the same solemnity.
Silence swirled around them for a minute as Draco tilted his head, surveying Harry and then looking over at where their brooms were hovering patiently, waiting for them. Harry watched his expression change, shift, and then watched Draco swallow again. “Okay,” he said. “Okay. Let’s go eat, Potter.”
Harry felt his heart drop. He wasn’t sure why: he wasn’t sure what he had expected. He licked his lips and then looked at Malfoy, who still wasn’t looking back at him. His jaw was set and his shoulders were lifted, as if he was bracing for a fight. It hit Harry like a punch to the gut that he had hurt him.
When he kept mostly quiet throughout, Harry decided not to press it. He finished one cup of tea and took another, mostly to be polite. Harry ate one of the gratitude cupcakes and thought Ron would like them enough that he asked if he could take one home. Although Malfoy stared at him, he still didn’t say much of anything, just watching as Narcissa nodded and Blighter appeared to put them in a box for him.
Harry hummed in the back of his throat and sat back in his chair. He folded his arms over his chest, unconsciously mimicking Ron’s position in their earlier conversation, as he looked around the Malfoy kitchen. “I’m a questioning sort of person.”
Ron’s face was red and he shuffled his feet, looking into the corner of the kitchen and setting his jaw before he looked back again. “I’m your friend, Harry,” he said, reaching out and patting Harry’s arm. “I’m your friend and I’m happy if you’re happy, but I don’t want to know about —”
“No, I know.” Malfoy sounded uncertain for a moment, words coming out slowly as if he was giving them some consideration. “It’s just, Potter, you must admit that it’s a little foolish to think I wouldn’t know why you were upset. And,” here Malfoy started talking quicker, as if worried Harry would jump in, “if you dare deny that you were upset, then I’ll have to leave immediately. I have eyes, so I could tell.”
A smile stole across Malfoy’s face, smug and delighted. “Blighter doesn’t like you and it’s because he’s a good boy, who listens to everything I say. I have said a lot of very negative things about you.”
Herbert hooted and hollered, jumping around and pecking Harry when he wasn’t quick enough to get the letter off. Harry groaned and took the note, unrolling it even as he cast a spell. It was
with me today, even though you’re being impossibly stubborn, so I’m telling you that I’m going to be here for the rest of the night. I’m not hitting on you now but I’m going to undress you and shove you into that shower unless you do it yourself because, quite frankly, you smell and you’ve been assaulting my senses since the moment you came here today and I’m not prepared to let that continue, no matter what.”
“Mate,” Ron said, “it’s the best thing I’ve got to do so far.” He looked slightly abashed as he added, “Course, it would be even better with you there.”
“Merlin,” Ron groaned, shovelling steak and ale pie into his mouth. “This is your best birthday ever, Hermione.”
Harry followed him. He had not necessarily expected anything from the room: he had walked through enough of the Manor with Malfoy that he knew it was filled with odd rooms, rooms with nothing in them but a piano, some chairs and a lot of furniture with no defined purpose other than to look impressive. He had seen countless drawing rooms and studies, several of them in disrepair that both he and Malfoy had taken pains not to directly mention. He had seen the kitchen and the dining room and Malfoy had walked through a ball room once, shoes off, doing a dramatic rendition of Harry’s terrible dancing at the Yule Ball which had left him breathless with laughter.
He could feel himself starting to annoy people. Ron had thought it was funny at first and then blatantly told him, on the third morning, “Christ, I can’t even look at you in the mornings, you make me sick.” Then again, Ron had never been good with mornings, so Harry didn’t let it faze him. The barista at the coffee shop he kept ducking into commented on his mood and grinned at him, like they were sharing a secret. There was a picture in the
Ron groaned and said, “I hate this” and then folded the tea towel over his arm. He picked up a snow globe and shook it. “Hey, Harry? Do you want a globe for Christmas?”
Draco looked at him once and then nodded, turning his broom down and dipping into a twist that Harry sat back and watched. He wanted to clap. He wanted to tell Draco that he thought he was a great flier, that he wanted to hear him laugh and whoop and give himself to the air. He wanted to tell him that joy was waiting for him. He wanted to tell him so many things, but he opened his mouth and he knew the wind would steal his words.
Harry made solemn eye contact with Malfoy. “Yes, I accept your gratitude and will bear this nobly, as I bear everything.”
Harry hated that question and, frankly, he wasn’t sure that Narcissa Malfoy would like the answer. The truth was that he’d spent weeks upon weeks attending funerals and memorials and wakes, he’d sat with the Weasley’s while their grief was still fresh and unwieldy and Molly Weasley had cleaned and banked and cooked like her life depended on it. He’d visited the Creevey family, the pit in his stomach huge and gaping and sickening, as Bobby Creevey had shown him pictures of himself in Colin’s album. He had spent more time than he cared for apologising to people and sitting with their grief and when he wasn’t doing that, he was finding friends to disappear with. The day trips to Oxford and the nights in the pub, or that time he’d desperately searched out Seamus and they had ended up accidentally exploding the wreck of a car in a scrapyard. None of it sounded overly compelling or like things he should share.
“You don’t look busy,” he said, accusingly. “And I only wanted to make sure that nothing was wrong.”
Harry took a breath to try to get a handle on his own irritation. “I’m getting there,” he snapped. Malfoy sniffed and knocked against him sharply, digging his elbow into Harry’s side. Harry did the same back and they tussled for a moment, both irritable and somehow both of them started to smile. Harry laughed and then shoved at Malfoy. He stumbled and then righted himself, giving Harry a dark look as he pulled at his coat.
Malfoy — Draco —- did. Harry felt it on his hand and laughed, his forehead against Malfoy’s, delight radiating through him. His hand was covered in Malfoy’s come and after barely a second of thought, he reached into his own trousers, pushing open his jeans and pressing them down to grab himself. Harry watched his own hand grab his cock, watched as he started to work himself, heard his voice murmur things to Malfoy that he barely comprehended. He heard Malfoy murmur something back, a lot of things which sounded like endearments even as he said, “You’re an idiot, Potter.”
There was a moment when he honestly thought Malfoy would turn around and scream at him then. His back was rigid, the tension in his body unmistakeable, and then it eased somewhat. It did not disappear. “I am saying it. You just never listen to me.”
“Of course we do, Harry,” Ron said, stretching the arm that was wrapped around Hermione out to pat awkwardly at Harry’s knee. “You’re family.”
If he had thought about his actions maybe he would have been nervous, but Harry acted on instinct and he had good instincts. He knew that. He trusted his instincts as he reached into Malfoy’s trousers, seeking hot, hard flesh and grasping it. Malfoy let out a keening noise and stared at Harry with eyes that were mostly black now, pupils large. Harry grinned and leaned forward, kissing Malfoy deeply as he started to move his hand. His touch was too soft at first, tentative and unsure. For a second, Harry remembered he’d never
Quickly catching herself on, her voice sliding back into the affected one she had been using with Ron, Hermione said, “Your punishment shall be it is you who has to clean the bathroom this week. Don’t you agree, Ronald?”
Harry came home at the start of April to the sound of Hermione crying. Dropping his backpack, his heart seized, his chest constricted with fear and Harry’s legs pumped, carrying him through the house. The back door was open and Hermione was sitting on the back step, bent over. Harry shouted her name and she turned.
Malfoy had got louder and louder until he nearly shrieked the words at Harry. Harry blinked at him, his mouth open. They both stared at each other, like soldiers on a battlefield. Harry curled his fingers in and then immediately unfurled them: he didn’t want Malfoy to think that he wanted to punch him. He didn’t even want to punch him; he wanted to understand him. He didn’t want to face off against Malfoy like he was on a battlefield, either. He was so tired of war.
Malfoy Manor was large and looked gloomy still. There were many windows and about half of them were dark, as if there were heavy curtains drawn throughout. The garden around him looked as if the gardener had rebelled, handing in their notice months before and only a cursory effort had been made since to keep it neat. There were rose bushes gone thick, something practically wood-like with heavy thorns curling up the path. Parts of the grass looked like they’d been cut and others Harry was pretty sure would come up to his hip. He took it all in as he walked. The last time he had been here his stomach had been tighter with dread and anticipation; he’d practically ignored his surroundings, unable to notice anything but the swirling mass of emotions inside of him.
Harry nodded again, because they’d talked about this and he didn’t need Ron to fill in all his sentences to know what he meant. He nodded, because he hadn’t quite known what to say when Ron had admitted that Bill had looked hurt for a brief second, or that Fleur had sworn in French, creatively and at length. Or he had assumed it was creatively but Ron didn’t speak French and couldn’t have said with any degree of certainty. He understood but Harry couldn’t help the whispering part of him that wanted to ask Ron to come anyway.
He had always paid a ridiculous amount of attention to Draco Malfoy, Harry knew, but this was something different.
“Oh, are you?” Ron grinned, but tried to hide it. It was useless: he’d never been able to hide his emotions really and his was a mouth that
“No, Harry, I’m serious,” Hermione said, earnest and shining with it. “I just want you to know that. You helped us. Her, me, all of us, and we’re all grateful and you should know that if you don’t want to help Narcissa Malfoy that not one person would think less of you.”
“Do you know what you’re doing? Are you sure? Are you happy?” Hermione had the ability to look intense very quickly and she looked it now, wide, assessing eyes fixed on him. “We’re not — Ron has been telling me, but I wanted all of us to talk about it.”
When he arrived, two days later, he looked tired and drawn, like he hadn’t had much sleep. Standing in the doorway to the kitchen, he lifted a hand in a wave and slunk across the tiles. “Hey, Harry,” he said, as he reached for Hermione and pulled her into him, mouth descending into her curls. Harry tried not to look too closely as Ron’s eyes fluttered closed and Hermione's body curved towards him, her arms reaching to wrap around Ron’s waist. They swayed together, in the middle of the kitchen, Ron breathing into Hermione’s hair.
Harry laughed delightedly and pushed himself up and off the counter, landing with a thump which got him a disdainful look. He walked over to Malfoy’s cauldron and looked down into it. “Look’s bubbling.”
Malfoy looked at  Harry and Harry realised he looked both helpless and amused. Helpless, amused and slightly lost, like he’d wandered out onto a ledge and didn’t know what he was doing. Harry realised he’d seen that look on this boy’s face again and shifted his gaze to the distance. He cleared his throat.
“Hermione, I’ve not a clue who that is,” Ron said finally, after her weighted pause went on a beat too long.
The sunroom was empty. The study and the second study and the small study were all empty too. Harry hated how many rooms the Malfoy house had.
? It’s not like you were having the time of your life.” Malfoy looked very pleased with himself, underneath his layer of irritation.
Malfoy stopped and turned. His expression was the picture of distaste. “Aren’t you going to hurry up? You’re late.”
“What do you think you’re doing?” Malfoy shouted. He must have been practically screeching it, for Harry to hear him. After an internal debate that lasted barely a moment, Harry continued walking. “Potter, I asked you a question!”
“We survived a war,” Ginny said, raising her eyebrows. “A lot of build up, then a war, then a lot of funerals and a lot of trials. I think we deserve to be able to drink in the morning.”
Draco still didn’t speak. He kept studying Harry, eyes sweeping across his face. It made Harry feel self-conscious but he tried not to move or fidget or do anything but submit to Draco’s stare. He wasn’t sure what was happening, except that Draco looked intent and intense and they stayed like that for what felt like minutes. Eventually, Draco reached out and traced his fingertips along Harry’s cheekbone, down his nose, around his mouth.
Harry shrugged and half-wished he hadn’t. The heavy rain outside meant his jacket was plastered to him and the movement made him feel chillier, more sodden, like he himself was an extension of a raindrop. Blighter’s disdainful look told him that the house elf was having a very trying day. He wondered what part of the property the elf had decided to tackle that day, but decided against asking. He’d learned the hard way.
He found he preferred to touch Malfoy instead. His shoulder pressed against Malfoy’s and their knees rested together, forming a bridge. Harry gently reached forward and Malfoy’s hands wavered for a moment as Harry tapped his fingertips along Malfoy’s knuckles.
Ron was staring down at the books in front of him, a deep furrow between his brow which remained there when he looked up at Harry. He looked a bit ill, paler than usual with his freckles standing out. “I dunno,” he said. “This is all super advanced charms stuff.”
Her fingers were tight around Harry’s and he focused on that, the pressure of it, as he leaned back on the stool, resting his back against it. “I think I might think a bit less of me,” he admitted, keeping his focus on their clasped hands instead of Hermione’s face.
“I ran. I mean, I was running. With Yolanda. We went out and then I gave her a bath and now I’m here.”
Hermione stared at him and blinked harshly a few times, trying to push away tears. “What if I can’t?”
Harry just about muffled his laughter, pressing the sleeve of his shirt against his mouth to hide the sound behind. “Discrimination?” he asked, voice sounding strained.
“At the beginning,” Hermione said, managing to sound prim despite the fact she was in her pyjamas and it was before eight in the morning. “So, we want to look at where you are versus where you could be. Or where you have your offers to be, of course. We’ll put as much data on the list as possible and we can work from there.”
at this very address so just in case you wondered what that means it means I’m going to be very underfoot. At all times.” Malfoy narrowed his eyes at Harry. “You better watch your back, Potter. I won’t be caught out by you.”
Harry wavered for a moment before he said, “Well there’s not much to do outside of here either, so it’s not like you’re missing much.”
“That’s because you’re an idiot,” Malfoy said, in a tone that was almost normal. “I tell you it all the time and you never listen to me. I’m very clever, so you really should.”
Harry jumped and his head shot up. Malfoy stood a few feet in front of him, head tilted to one side, peering at Harry like an exotic bird. Harry couldn’t tell if Malfoy was wearing one of his too-large pirate shirts again. “What?” he asked, dumbly.
Draco made a deeply affronted noise and dropped Harry’s hand, shoving him away from him. Harry laughed and toppled onto his side and then reached out to pull Draco down with him. They wrestled, tussling with one another, and when the wrestling turned into writhing on the floor, Harry gave himself over with abandon.
Harry leaned back in his chair and listened to his friends bicker amongst themselves. He heard Hermione tell Ron that that wasn’t a good enough time frame but he also barely heard it. The words hit him and then fell away. Draco had written to Ron and Hermione and had barely mentioned it. If he scanned back, he could remember Draco assuring him that he’d reached out but there had been no mention of
Malfoy blinked at him and then turned away. Harry watched him watch Yolanda, who had taken to bouncing in front of them, running towards trees and then back again. “It seemed to have backfired.”
“Whatever. I meant it. Whatever you were gonna say, just don’t do it until you’ve thought about it and you decide whether you really mean it.”
Ron was just declaring his third “Well, I never!” when the court hushed and Malfoy was led in. He still looked too pale, too thin, too tall. He looked nervous too, biting hard on his lip as he was led to the defendant’s box and the guard cast the spell to keep him there. Harry watched Malfoy’s eyes travel everywhere, almost seeming to swivel in opposite directions at once. He looked restless, like he was dying to fidget and couldn’t. Harry felt anxious just looking at him.
Malfoy hummed. “Yes, rather. She played at my first birthday, too, although naturally I didn’t care much for it. She came back here a number of times before she died. My father always told me that I would one day learn from her but I was never truly motivated and she refused to teach me until I applied myself better.” He paused and turned his head to look out a window. Harry stared at him and wondered if he should be saying anything. The problem, of course, was that he didn’t have anything to say and Malfoy looked sad and wistful, his pale face even paler than normal. He wore a dark red shirt with large sleeves, a robe thrown around him as capitulation to the cold, although he had left it undone. Harry thought he looked stark and severe and so
“Put your finger down.” Malfoy did, slowly. Harry nodded and said, “You don’t know anything about my relationship with Ginny and you were dying for me to tell you all about it.”
Harry nodded and started to walk back down the lane. Malfoy hesitated and then began to follow. “Okay, I won’t compliment you. I just want to say sorry, though. I know I was being a bit of a bellend.”
Malfoy nodded slowly, looking at Harry with a piercing stare for a moment before he glanced down at the dog. Yolanda bounced back and forward from the trees to winding herself around them. Malfoy watched her, shaking his head gently. “Potter, we have known each other for almost half our lives at this point.”
for the moment) bedroom. Harry had agreed to mind Hermione’s owl, which he felt was an important step forward. He still didn’t want his own owl, a part of him pulling away from the thought, his heart twisting when he thought about Hedwig.
“We should go in,” she said eventually and, as one, the three of them stood. Hermione looked between Ron and Harry and then nodded to herself, taking a step back. “I’m going to get us a seat.”
“I know who Maleficent is!” Harry said. “I just didn’t know she played piano here. I thought she was too busy poisoning Sleeping Beauty.”
“Potter, don’t be ridiculous. I simply can’t talk to you without some proper fresh air to clear my head.” Malfoy did not look at him once. Instead, he wrenched open the heavy gate in the back wall and, completely unable to stay still, Harry followed him.
“Do you think we should just send her these?” he asked finally, after he’d picked up another one and found little that made much sense to him.
“I don’t care what you want,” Malfoy said, cheerfully. “In fact, I am making it my mission in life to do the opposite of what you want.”
A buzz went around the assembled gallery. Harry didn’t turn his head but he didn’t feel like he needed to: Hermione shifted behind him, brushing her hand against his back. He wished that Ron was here too, but Ron had taken him aside, voice low and apologetic, and said that he didn’t want to upset his mother any further. Harry understood but he couldn’t help himself from feeling his absence.
Draco sighed loudly. He set his quill down and folded his hands in front of him. It was very prim, which was hilarious. Harry tried not to smile. “For your information,” Draco said, “it wasn’t at all for a laugh. As you know, I have a mandatory meeting once a week with one of the therapists that the Ministry approved. She suggested that I write out everything that I had done. She suggested I try to make amends.”
The ‘now’ was important. Harry wouldn’t forget who he had been. He couldn’t forget what he had done. Harry looked down at the ground and then at Ron, who watched him with a careful, assessing gaze.
He stopped off at home, divesting himself of some of the treats. The thought seized him just before he was leaving and he grabbed some and a bottle of mulled wine, sending it to Lavender with a scrawled Christmas note. He watched the owl depart for a moment and then grabbed his backpack again, apparating to Malfoy Manor.
“No, of course not. I was a Slytherin.” Malfoy straightened himself, tugging at the collar of his shirt and then, clearly deciding not to bother pretending he hadn’t been eavesdropping said, “I heard your girlfriend dumped you.”
He decided Malfoy needed to know that. “Malfoy,” Harry said, slowly and clearly, waiting until the other boy looked at him before he continued to speak. “If you’ve brought me here to show me your award winning horses, I’ll throw up all over your shoes and then into every single one of those rose bushes. You shouldn’t test me either because I ate my body weight in macaroons like ten minutes ago.”
at first, not until Malfoy disappeared around a corner and Harry followed him. The front chamber of the room was filled with bookcases and a massive desk upon which were piled bundles of notes. A huge fireplace dominated one wall of the room, around which were arranged a few armchairs. One of them was completely covered in discarded clothes.
“Don’t play dumb with me, Potter. You and I both know that being here is probably last on your list of things you want to do. Why do you
. Harry stood there, practically frozen, trying hard to be a wall of calm in the middle of Draco’s incessant motion.
Having mostly tackled the hallway (Walburga would have to be dealt with after), Harry had decided that it was probably best to go to the kitchen. He loved Hermione’s kitchen; he loved the Weasley’s; he loved Hogwarts’. He wanted to love the kitchen of the house he owned, wanted to see parts of his own heart reflected back at him.
“It wasn’t that bad, I guess.” And then, amending grudgingly: “It was very awkward. And Malfoy didn’t talk at all basically when we were all in the same room.”
“He’ll be okay,” Harry said, pulling more weeds. Narcissa nodded and they worked together quietly for a bit before Harry realised that he hadn’t yet seen Draco. A niggling voice in his head asked him if he was putting it off. Glancing over his shoulder, he looked back at the house. When he turned back to the garden, Narcissa pretended that she hadn’t been looking at him.
Malfoy flushed instantly, skin heating several degrees. “I can’t believe you’re harping on about this again. You get one sum wrong and suddenly everyone’s a critic.”
“Yeah, I was.” Harry squeezed Hermione’s hand, hard, and she looked at him. He made a face at her and saw her visibly relax, just a little. “I was excited, but I don’t know if she’s wrong either. I haven’t really thought about it and Ginny obviously has. She just kept asking me what I wanted and I realised I didn’t know. I didn’t really know and I hadn’t been thinking about it at all.”
“Move,” he said to him in a voice he didn’t recognise as his own, a voice that sounded deeper and more hoarse. Malfoy nodded, scooting the chair back and Harry was in his lap, pressing himself close as Malfoy claimed his mouth again. Malfoy was fire under Harry’s hands, somehow both pale as snow and burning up. Harry wrapped his arms around Malfoy’s neck and moved, lifted himself up a little and then ground down.
“You bastard!” Ron laughed as he thumped Harry’s back, a loud clap that echoed in the corridor. Beside them, Hermione winced and Harry felt the thump reverberate through his ribcage. Still, it made him laugh louder, because it chased away a growing sense of unease that only got worse as he noticed Hermione checking her watch again.
Hesitating for a moment outside the door, Harry stood with his hand on the doorknob and tried to think about what he was going to say. He didn’t know. Had he been supposed to write back?
Malfoy laughed and Harry realised that he didn’t believe him. While the other boy had sounded furious and angry moments before, he sounded sad now, weary, like the anger had drained his energy. He looked smaller too, which was ridiculous because he was taller than Harry. Shoving his hands into his pockets, Harry rocked back and forth for a moment and then came to a decision. A few quick steps and he was beside Malfoy, waiting for a moment to see how he reacted before he dropped down beside him. Malfoy sat, tense and unmoving. He did not shift his gaze to look at Harry. Harry decided he was fine with that.
Obediently, Harry reached out and took a macaroon. Narcissa watched him eat it and neither of them spoke. It was intensely uncomfortable.
“Not all the time. Sometimes they’re normal things. I thought he was losing it because one time he asked me to describe a normal day.” Ron looked a little bit uncomfortable as he thought about it. “Felt like I was in some creative writing class.”
Hermione gave up on trying not to laugh and leaned fully against the counter, burying her face in her hands for a moment. Her freshly-braided hair even shook with the force of it. “You’re a saint, Ron.”
Narcissa frowned but appeared to decide not to take the opportunity to let him know how much she hated that greeting. Instead she looked at the ground in front of her, the still-green rose bushes and the leaves which curled up the side of a shed. “I’m trying to think of whether I want to incorporate some lilies into my rose garden,” she told him.
Harry stared at Malfoy’s back before quickly realising he needed to hurry if he wanted to know where he was going. He pulled his trainers off and kicked them by the side of the door, running after Malfoy. His socked feet slipped against the tiles and after the second time he nearly went skidding he shouted out, “Malfoy, are you not going to slow down?”
“It was Hermione’s birthday. We went out.” Harry started to chop the coriander. He was completely unsure if it was for the potion or for Malfoy’s dinner. “People tend to drink on other people’s birthdays, as you know.”
He did not say anything more and Malfoy waited a good ten seconds before he laughed and shook his head. “You are unbelievable. Truly. Let me assure you that however boring you are being, I would
Instead, Harry rubbed a hand over his mouth and trooped up the stairs to find Narcissa reading a book, sitting in one of the armchairs. She looked up as he entered, a smile on her face, and stood even though Harry tried to tell her not to.
They kept talking, lulls and echoes of previous conversation, trying to claw their way towards some normality that seemed far off. When Hermione said goodbye, mindful of the time, telling Ron to go straight to bed he promised he would. Still, when the call cut off both boys tumbled backwards, backs against the coffee table staring into the fire.
There was a brief pause as Malfoy stared at him. A frown appeared between his eyebrows before it was on his mouth, his thin lips twisting downwards. He looked confused and alarmed at the same time.
Harry squared his shoulders and walked up to the gate. Again, it sprang open. Again, Harry was struck by the disarray of the garden. He walked slowly up the lane leading to the front door, already anticipating knocking for a good few minutes (this time, he had built that into when he arrived) but halfway up the lane, the front door was flung open. Harry watched as Malfoy tore through the front door and down towards Harry. He was glad to notice that, this time, Malfoy was wearing shoes.
“That’s a terrible gift to ask for,” Harry said, pressing a kiss under Draco’s ear. He groaned and Harry nipped lightly at his earlobe. “I brought panettone for you instead. I think that’s posher.”
Harry’s visits to Malfoy Manor were irregular but not infrequent. Ever since Malfoy had sent the owl to Harry and his subsequent morning visit, the silent embargo against visiting any time other than exactly three p.m. in the afternoon was lifted. He did not always send word that he was appearing either, which started by accident and then became something of a habit.
“Of course.” Narcissa clutched her hands tightly in her lap and then sighed. She looked down at the scones in front of her and picked one up. Harry watched her carefully and methodically pick the blueberries out of the top. “I am not feeling particularly hungry. You can have these for your friend. Pass on my well wishes, of course.”
obscenely wealthy, despite the vaults that the Ministry had confiscated, the property that had been stripped from them, the objects in the Manor which had been entered into an evidence vault or repatriated. The house itself was evidence of their wealth but the last few years had turned it into a hollow of itself (according to Malfoy), a duller, less fashionable, far less well-maintained home without its dedicated staff. Harry had listened to Malfoy whine on occasion of all the grand things that had been stripped from their home, although he rarely let the other boy get far into the complaints before he cut him off.
, Harry thought, and calm. He was tall, easily six foot four, and slender, with rugby player shoulders. He wore a shirt which was rolled up and there were scars across his hands and his arms. When Harry looked at them, Patrick smiled and explained that he used to work with very dangerous creatures and that those creatures were not the sort that Harry would be dealing with.
“Don’t be smart. It’s a metaphor. We are going to be metaphorically imprisoned.” Malfoy evidently saw Harry’s blank look because he continued, “By the chains of our past.”
“It’s going to be okay,” he said and he believed it. Sitting back, he placed his hands on her shoulders and said, “They’re remembering. We’re gonna get you there. You’re going to be just fine and so are they.”
Her head appeared in the fireplace shortly after eleven o’clock at night and Harry could see the way that disappointment and fatigue had settled into the lines on her face even through the flames. Ron sat beside him and tensed, just slightly. Harry watched his friend smile, act jovial, grin, and keep his hands curled around his mug’s handle so tightly his knuckles shone bone-white.
It was on the tip of Harry’s tongue to say not yet but he couldn’t bring himself to. Instead, he just pulled a face and said, “Ron, if I have to talk to you, I promise I will.”
“Shoes off!” Ron imitated, but he was still grinning as he flopped into a chair and pulled his boots off. “Shoes off! As if you’re not dying for me to tell you what I did today.”
Malfoy laughed, the sound cruel in the hazy summer afternoon. “You’re one to talk about stalking, Potter. The rest of us — that is my mother and I — are trying to keep ourselves occupied.”
He found Narcissa back in the rose garden. She smiled and listened to him and asked questions and nodded. They talked for twenty minutes and when he asked where Draco was and how he had been, Narcissa’s face looked a little pinched.
“I hate this,” he murmured and then, voice stronger, Draco continued. “I don’t know if I do. I’m not telling you that I do. I just think that...I could. I feel like I could. I feel like it’s you.”
Malfoy blinked at him. “Well done. Of course it is. Why else would the door be charmed only to appear for me?”
“You hardly talk about things, Potter. It’s your least favourite activity, talking about emotions. It probably ranks down below getting flayed, but above being cannibalised.”
before. Everything that had gone wrong in his life, Harry was pretty sure had gone wrong because of other people’s desperate desire for more power. The thirst and the half-demented drive to accrue more power and learn how to hoard it. He heard the word ‘power’ and Harry’s stomach dropped and twisted, blood rushing to his ears. He felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand up and when he looked at the Malfoys he could see they were regarding him with almost identical expressions.
Ron sighed, heavy enough that it was a surprise the flames didn’t waver. “Shit, mate. What are we gonna do?”
.” Her voice was desperate and her nails dug into his skin. Harry looked up at her and there were tears all over Hermione’s face but she didn’t look devastated. “Harry, I swear I’m fine.”
He wanted to tell him all of those things but when he looked at Malfoy all he could think about was how exhausted he looked, how Harry had noticed every movement of his for the past few days looking slower and heavier, as if his bones were becoming more dense and he was unaccustomed to moving with that weight. He remembered how awful Malfoy had looked at the trials, the pallor of his skin after being in custody for those few months. Malfoy never talked about it but Harry knew the weeks in the Ministry’s cells had changed him. Harry let the silence sit, chewing on his bottom lip, cradling the glass in his hand and not drinking it.
Harry shook his head. “That’s not — I spend Christmas with you. If you want me there. If your mum wants me there.”
December, but if Harry squinted he could picture it in the middle of summer, filled with bursting beautiful plants, swaying in the breeze. Behind the house, a field stretched and fell off. He knew they were on a cliff and he stared past the house to the sea. It was a grey day and the sea turned and churned, waves crashing down and frothing against the shore. Harry found himself smiling and he walked up the garden path, rapping his knuckles on the door.
Harry stared at him and then smiled. He reached to cup Draco’s face and said, “I’ve never been happier to hear it.”
For Hermione’s birthday, they went to a museum. Harry and Ron arranged for a bottomless brunch before the visit and they were quite thoroughly drunk by the time they reached the museum, all three of them clinging to each other and laughing. Every time Ron saw anything remotely funny, he tried to tell them in a level tone of voice and completely failed. Harry was left almost breathless with laughter as he stage-whispered, “Why does that portrait have that tiny man with such a massive bulge?” and an elderly couple breathed in sharply with displeasure before hurrying off.
Pouring water into the cups, Ron said, “I don’t see why not. You’re really good with that sort of stuff, mate. And it’d be exciting to work with dragons.”
He laughed, his chest expanding further, and Harry took a long swallow of his wine until the glass was completely drained. Hermione followed suit.
that much of an artist, Harry, and no one wants you to draw on your skin.” Harry pretended to be affronted and she shrugged, citing tough love.
” Malfoy sounded disgusted. “It’s a figure of speech. Go find Mother yourself, I’ve things to attend to.” Malfoy immediately took off now they had reached the top of the lane, through the front door and heading down one of the corridors without looking back. Harry hesitated for a moment: he wanted to know what was down that corridor, he wanted to follow Malfoy and find out who was visiting, he wanted to know why he looked like a pirate.
but Harry found he was reluctant to say anything. He knew it would sound too sharp and the thought of a proper argument made him feel weary. Instead, he looked around the kitchen a little more: the large fire at one end, over which something was roasting, but which seemed to have contained its heat to its hearth. Everything was gleaming and clean; this room had obviously been taken care of before any other, more care poured into it than several of the Manor’s other rooms.
“You must have forgotten you were muttering about it while you were brooding outside my gates,” Malfoy said, airily. He folded his arms and scowled again; it took a moment for Harry to realise it was supposed to be an impression of him, which made him scowl, which made Malfoy smile. Harry’s scowl deepened.
“I was picturing our business cards.” Ron’s grin was broad and slow, his warm, lazy good humour shining across his face. “They were beautiful. My name looked practically new and innovative beside Harmond.”
“I would want,” Ron said, just as solemn and serious. “You’re a good mate that way. Anticipating my needs.”
“You can shove your amusement up your arse.” Malfoy’s face flushed. “Maybe it is! I’ve read a lot about it.”
Harry couldn’t say no with a threat like that. He replied still grinning, his feet firmly in the present, his heart thrumming with glee.
Harry pressed his hands deep into his jeans pockets for warmth and rocked onto his heels, laughing. “You said that a couple weeks ago.”
Sitting at the kitchen table, Harry flipped through the first book. He didn’t understand a word. He reached for the second. He didn’t understand it at all. He reached for the third.
Harry could feel his whole body flushing. Embarrassment swept through him, hot and rich, and he moved away from the oven and from Ron. Maybe the sources of heat were making it worse. Maybe he just needed to get away. Laughing a little wildly, he went to stand by the sink and the open window over it. “Ron, I really don’t want to talk about it.”
i realised vaguely when writing this and then after, when going over it, that november is technically autumn and not winter and then, after a short internal debate, i realised that i don't give a fuck! so! november's winter! it def FEELS LIKE WINTER so i stand by it and idwiw xxx
Harry felt, for sure, that Malfoy had never mentioned that he owned the fanciest fucking piano that had ever existed.
“He should not make that choice for me.” Narcissa’s jaw was set. “I’m his mother and it’s up to me to protect him.”
Lavender laughed. It was a bold sound, a far cry from a giggle, although she sounded just as delighted. “You were very vague. I wasn’t sure what was going on! I mean, I knew it wasn’t anything that serious, probably, because no one ever asks me anything serious but what if it was? My heart was going a mile a minute!”
“I don’t want you to say a single smug thing,” Draco had said and Harry had shrugged and said he wouldn’t. He had instead bided his time, waited until Draco looked happy and flushed, sending candles floating around some of the trees outside and
Harry watched him for a long time. It wasn’t often that he got to look at Draco like this — Narcissa knew about their relationship, but Harry preferred not to stay the night much. It felt strange to him, for reasons he struggled to explain. Although they slept together there really wasn’t much sleeping
Ron sighed. “Yeah, I know! But I’ve got it all set up. Hermione helped, of course — she’s going to be along later, she had to go and pick up some studying stuff — but every room has something else we thought you might be interested in. And it’s all sort of practical stuff. I mean, we kind of had to bandy our names around a bit, but there’s someone here who plays Quidditch, and there’s a Healer, because Hermione said you were talking about it that time. And then there’s a couple of other things we thought maybe you would be interested in, like we’ve got a broommaker in too and Bill got one of his cursebreaker friends in. It’s pretty cool.” Ron had been bouncing on the back of his heels, gesturing from one room to another as he talked or pointing up the stairs, his excitement obvious, but then he looked at Harry and took a deep breath. “I mean, it’s whatever.”
Harry reached out automatically, grabbing for Ginny’s hands. She let him fold their fingers together. “That’s not true, Gin,” he said softly. “Nobody thinks that.”
August had nearly melted away by the time Harry found himself alone with Ginny again. The Weasley household had been a constant grounding for the whole family for all their lives; with Fred’s death, it became more so. Bill and Fleur had been there practically every day, sometimes staying over whenever they seemed to deem it necessary. Charlie had apparently taken a leave of absence from work, although nearly every time Harry spoke to him he seemed jumpy, restless, always staring out of windows with a wistful expression on his face. Harry didn’t know how long he was going to stay.
“No. No. Look, it’s called justice. I — I’m trapped here because I tried to ruin a lot of other people’s lives. I tried to ruin yours too, once. I’ve had a lot of time with it and I think I get it. It’s only fair that I lose some of mine.” Draco still looked stern and hard, but there was a deep melancholy in his voice that Harry hated. He hated it, which was strange, because at the same time he was fiercely proud of Draco. “Of course I’m losing some of my life though. It’s the whole point.”
Hermione was not smiling. She was propped on one of the stools at the breakfast bar, feet swinging beneath her, slippers kicked off and on the floor. The remains of their dinner were in the sink and in front of her were two large slices of chocolate cake. She glanced at Harry, considering, wrapping a strand of hair around her finger and then letting it go over and over until he had taken a seat again and she sighed.
He didn’t wait for either of the Malfoy’s to acknowledge what he was doing or chime in. He didn’t really allow them a chance to speak either. He hadn’t considered that it might be weird, turning up to the grandest house he had ever been in and presenting the poshest people he had ever known with a handful of neighbourhood presents. The thought had simply not entered his head until he was placing stuff on the coffee table, glancing at the muggle labels. At least, he thought, some of it was from Marks & Spencer. Not that the Malfoy’s would even know the difference. Not that Harry really cared, except it was so utterly absurd that he almost laughed.
“Somewhere terrible, for sure,” Draco said, grabbing for Harry’s hand, pulling him along with him. He turned and stared at the large foyer of the manor, shaking his head, looking at Harry from the corner of his eye. “I don’t know what to do now,” he said shyly.
Harry hummed. “Yeah, we were. It was pretty great, to be honest. We went to a museum and an art gallery too, although I don’t know how much I learnt.”
“Of course it is,” Malfoy said, in a tone that didn’t quite reach unkindness but certainly pressed intimately against it, “but then again, Potter, you were always going to get a very important offer.”
Finally, Malfoy stopped, spinning round. He looked on the verge of tears, which was why Harry was not that surprised when Malfoy picked up a candlestick from a nearby table and threw it at him. It was a particularly bad throw, going extremely wide, knocking into a portrait who yelled loudly instead.
When she reached for the whiskey again, Harry reached for her wrist. Ginny hesitated and looked up at him, her head tilted to one side. “Harry?”
Harry tilted his head and stared at Draco for a moment. Draco pulled away from the attention, scowling at Harry, wrapping his arms around himself as he turned away to look outside of the greenhouse. While he studied the landscape, Harry studied Draco and tried to think of how best to get through to him. He wished he was Hermione, who was clever, or Ron, who had a tendency to be insightful and sometimes knew exactly what to say.
“I gathered,” Draco said, clearly trying to sound unaffected. He couldn’t; his voice was husky and raw, scraping against Harry’s ears. It made him smile, but Draco wasn’t looking directly at him and missed it.
to. He knew exactly what the invitation had said. Glancing at his watch again, he lifted his hand and banged the knocker several times against the door.
“You’re such a whinge, Malfoy.” Harry laughed as he stood and then helped Draco up. His cheeks were bright. He wanted to kiss Draco again but Narcissa was nearby and Harry had decided that he was going to be a gentleman. He wanted Draco to not be
” Malfoy clearly wasn’t actually going to respond to the questions that Harry was actually asking. Malfoy clearly had other things in mind. “You’re so self-righteous. How can you actually stand there and ask me that? How do you need things spelled out for you, every second of every day? How are you this stupid? It’s a
“You’re so uncultured,” Draco said, digging his fingernails in more.  “I wish I could tell you that it makes me sick.”
“I’m not going to embarrass you,” Harry said. “I’m not going to write you a letter either? Don’t be weird. I’m just — I’m just here. I just wanted to sit down.” He licked his lips, tasting Malfoy, watching Malfoy watch the movement. Harry swallowed again. “I didn’t expect that.”
Draco’s war with his worst instincts was taking place in front of Harry’s face. He could feel Draco’s heartbeat fluttering and felt the tremble in his body that meant Draco was telling himself not to move. His nostrils flared and his eyes narrowed and despite it all he said, curtly, “Fine. Move your hand, Harry.”
She left and Harry looked at Draco, who hadn’t said anything for a while. He was staring at the things on the table. Harry could feel that Draco only seemed to look at him when he looked away, feeling the weight of his wondrous stare like a physical presence.
Harry took a second to ponder every last life choice which had led him to this moment. “You are,” he said loudly, “the absolute bane of my existence.”
“She meant those things. What she said. She meant that people let the desire for power consume them and it obliterates everything else.” Draco glared at him and added, “But that doesn’t mean it’s always bad.”
Rubbing a hand over his mouth, Harry said, first through his fingers and then clearer, “Well, I can come and talk to you, I guess.” Malfoy’s gaze snapped away from the horizon to Harry. He looked perplexed and wrongfooted; he even took a step backwards. Harry quickly started to speak. “I don’t mean you you. I mean your mum. Too. Maybe Blighter, but I don’t think he likes me and I can’t tell if it’s because you keep getting him to ice
“Why would I make a thing out of it, Malfoy?” Harry asked, eyes glittering. “That doesn’t sound like something to make a thing out of at all.”
you to visit. Don’t be so absurd.” He quickened his pace just slightly. “I told you that Blighter was threatening poison and I’m trying this new thing called radical honesty.”
There was a light in Ron’s eyes that looked almost dangerous as he said, “Well, you don’t know everything me and Hermione’ve got up to.”
Harry blinked at Malfoy who had ceased playing when they walked into the room. The piano he sat at was huge. Harry had heard of grand pianos before, although he had never seen one. He certainly had never seen one as ornate as the instrument before him, polished until it gleamed, shining with a gold floral design that twisted up its legs, around its edges, spilling over the top. The piano was just off the centre of the room on a large podium, surrounded by vases. It was the most ostentatious thing that Harry had possibly ever seen.
Harry looked around helplessly. He wanted to call Yolanda over to him because her presence was a large comfort and he could lose himself in playing with her. Instead, he forced himself to look at Malfoy and take him in. He looked like he had thawed out since  Harry first saw him, the edges of an ice sculpture melting. He still stood still, posture unyielding, but his fingers were no longer curled into his palm to make a fist and his shoulders had retreated the tiniest bit from his ears. Harry took it as a sign of encouragement.
“I don’t need thanks.” Harry wondered what he usually did with his body when he sat down. Did he cross his legs? Did he cross his arms?  Did he slouch? He couldn’t remember and, instead, he decided to do nothing but keep very, very still. “I wasn’t doing it for that.”
Malfoy didn’t look like he admired Harry’s restraint. At the moment, he didn't look like he admired Harry’s anything. He still looked ill and sick and sharp and furious, blotches of colour high up on his cheeks as he breathed savagely and looked at Harry. “You’re
“I brought back a dozen cupcakes,” Harry said, warm and amused. Beside him, he felt  Hermione suppressing her laughter.
He eased himself down to sit, not watching but not looking away. He tuned out their whispered murmurs, he unfocused his eyes and looked at the ceiling, and then when the greeting was done he said, “Welcome home, Hermione.”
Harry swallowed. “I don’t think you’re about to explode. And I don’t — I  don’t want to tell you what to do. I want you to pick what you want. So you can be happy.” To him, it sounded like the right thing to do. Judging by Ginny’s face, she had slightly different ideas.
The thought warmed him as he walked into the Manor. Blighter eyed him for a moment and then said, “Happy Christmas, Mr Potter.”
which is, quite frankly Potter, a little upsetting! And all I see all day is her face, and Blighter’s face, and my face, and your stupid face and nothing else. It’s all just a
Malfoy snorted and then sighed. He brushed his fingers lightly through his hair and then said, “I’m getting my coat. That dog better not jump.”
Harry stopped to take a breath, trying not to trip over his own tongue, gearing up to start again when Ron stopped him. Ron reached out, clasping Harry’s shoulders and squeezing and Harry looked up into his friend’s face, nervous about what he would see there. He expected to see disappointment; instead Ron just looked vaguely sad. “Harry,” he said, gentle again. “Mate. I would never, ever ask you to do that for me. I don’t even want you to want to do that for me. It’s kind of nice and all, don’t get me wrong, but I don’t want you to be mildly miserable all the time just to make me happy.”
The laugh that Narcissa let out was brittle. “You misspeak, Harry. He idolised him. He always did. I — I feel like I should have served them both better, managed their expectations more.”
Harry sighed and then started to eat his breakfast properly, aware there was no use prolonging the inevitable. Hermione pottered about, making herself some tea, refreshing his, murmuring to Ron by the sink as he finished making his bacon. Once Harry felt that he couldn’t put her off anymore, he said, “Right. Let’s go. Where are we starting?”
“I know.” Malfoy smiled, a bitter looking twist to his mouth. They had been wandering down corridors for what felt like forever but he stopped now, leaning against a heavy door and letting Harry in first. Harry was surprised to find he’d been led to the kitchen but he didn’t say anything about it.
Harry found himself laughing, head tilted down so the laughter hit the earth. He raised his shoulders almost to his ears, hands sunk deep in his pockets and thought about agreeing. It would be so easy. He didn’t even
“No, I – no that’s all right.” Harry wavered in the doorway for a moment, trying and failing not to stare at Malfoy, who looked angrier every time he noticed Harry looking at him. Finally, he threw his hands up – quite literally, threw them into the air – and stepped back into the hall.
Malfoy was conspicuously and notably absent the next time Harry arrived at Malfoy Manor, only four days later. For a moment during the visit, Narcissa looked as if she wanted to say something, her mouth open and head tilted to the side in a gesture Harry realised he recognised from Malfoy. It seemed to pass quickly enough, however, and the whole visit would have been entirely unremarkable if Blighter did not inform him at the door, “Master Draco has asked me to tell you there is a gift in with the cupcakes Mistress Narcissa has sent this time.”
“I can tell that you’re making fun of me and I don’t mind. I’m trying to say that I messed up and it’s because I don’t like people knowing me. It’s weird to me that you do.”
Harry took a sharp breath in. “No, of course not.” He felt his own face twisting into a mockery of a sneer. “Already a pretty low opinion, huh?”
Two days after he got the job at the animal clinic, he stopped by an apothecary with a list and brought some of the ingredients back to Malfoy Manor with him.
that Harry would have called it avoiding. He had woken up in Malfoy’s bed on the first of November, morning sun crawling through a gap in the curtains. Malfoy had been asleep beside him, face pressed almost fully into the pillow near Harry’s head, one arm loosely thrown over Harry’s chest. Harry couldn’t remember when he had fallen asleep or if Malfoy had tried to rouse him. He was still half-propped up against the headboard with a crick in his neck from the position. Malfoy’s hair had fanned out on the pillow around him, pale and bright. He had been barely awake and reached for it, running his fingers through Malfoy’s hair and trying to will sleep away from him.
A faint smile flickered across Hermione’s face. Harry drank it in and lifted his eyes to look at Ron, who looked solemn but open.
He thought about what Narcissa had said and heard himself ask, “Do you think you’re losing your life here?”
Draco laughed and looked at Harry with dancing eyes. His hair was still gleaming in the firelight. As he took off his clothes, his skin was lit up by it. Harry thought he was beautiful, so beautiful, the most beautiful person he had ever seen. The light of the fire created patterns in light and shadow across Draco’s skin and Harry was so hungry to chase all of them.
Blighter nodded and then said, “The family room tonight.” He disappeared immediately with a loud crack.
“I’ve decided to say thank you,” Malfoy announced, loudly, and sounding as stiff as a corpse. “I recognise and appreciate that this should have come before now, but the atmosphere in the Manor really is oppressive and I decided I didn’t want to cope with it.” A brief pause and then he added reluctantly, “And you startled me.”
Ron shrugged. “Maybe. I hope so.” He chewed on his lip and looked around the small chamber, expression pale and worried. Harry could see the moment Ron decided to let himself slip into a slightly easier conversation. “Though if they come back, it’d probably mean we can’t live there anymore.”
“Unless you’ve changed your mind, I suppose.” Malfoy shrugged, lifting one shoulder, conveying for all the world that it clearly didn’t matter to him one way or the other what Harry did. He stepped back. “If you have, tell me now and I can let Mother know.”
Malfoy let out a choked laugh when Harry did. “You’re the exact dictionary definition of a decent sort, Potter.”
,” Hermione insisted with wide eyes. She looked cried out, exhausted and yet somehow happy, an ease in her expression which had been missing for months, if not years.
Ron nodded, looking thoughtful. “Can I say ‘I am the great Ronald Weasley and I command you move this date?’”
Settling into a routine without Hermione proved weird. For a few days, Harry tried to establish one of his own. Ron, technically, still lived in the Burrow, but spent most of his time in Hermione’s house. He got up at the same time every morning and it woke Harry up. They shared breakfast and Ron would leave for Auror training, while Harry would leave to visit Mrs Ormsby’s dogs. It turned out she had many of them: a German shepherd, who needed a lot of exercise, several Westie’s, who needed a bit less, and a pair of labradors, one of whom was very active while the other seemed incredibly averse to moving. Harry started to take the dogs when he went on a run. He would stay with them for a while and then take off. He started to volunteer, picking different charities, trying to find something to fill his time with.
The look Malfoy gave him was scathing and embarrassed, which made it even more scathing. Harry delightedly swung his legs back and forth on the kitchen counter. “Not everyone cares about
“Quiet down, the two of you.” Ron looked particularly smug at getting the opportunity to say that and turned to the front of the court as they started proceedings. Harry watched the Wizengamot pour in and found he didn’t know whether he wanted to look at Malfoy or not.
Malfoy shrugged. “Then you can shower. Except I think you’re going to angrily try to kick the shower first and I’m just here to protect my possessions.”
Ron was leaning against the wall when they exited the courtroom, his arms folded over his chest and his chin tilted towards the ground. The crowd parted around them, helped no doubt by the fierce glare that Hermione gave anybody who got too close. Harry noticed she didn’t once let go of her wand.
Now that Harry had told the Malfoy’s he was not going to keep coming back purely to annoy Malfoy, it left him at something of a loss. It seemed even weirder now to send an owl and request tea. Every time Harry found himself about to do it he promptly found something else to do. Hermione’s list meant that he had, in fact, too much to consider.
She disappeared quickly, her sharp steps ringing out and Harry looked from her back to Ron. “You going to come in with us?” he asked.
“Not even a bit, Weasley,” Harry said, but he was glad to see her looking lighter. He didn’t mind the embarrassment so much. “You know I hate being teased.”
Harry was thrown enough that he didn’t respond for a second. Then, he shrugged again. “Maybe. I don’t know. I didn’t really want to do any of the things we saw but it was nice to rule it out. Is sitting around in your manor and scribbling away helpful?”
“Don’t say anything until you’ve thought about what you’re going to say,” Harry said sternly. Draco made several indignant noises and then firmly licked Harry’s hand until he removed it from over his mouth. Wrinkling his nose, Harry wiped his hand on his jeans and Draco laughed at that, a bright, sharp sound which burst through the air.
had wanted to do this for him. That he had taken so much time and effort and tried to think of things that Harry would want to do. Harry felt something swell within him and he swallowed around a lump in his throat. “Ron, this was a lot of effort.”
Ron reached over to ruffle Harry’s hair. “Nah. You’re an awful liar. Come on, I wanna go for a fly about. Maybe it’ll clear your head.”
“Just our old friend Draco’s, then,” Ron said, jostling Harry with his elbow. Harry turned his head and looked at him, raising his eyebrows. Ron raised his right back at him. “You know, our charming old friend, who wanted to kill us, let Death Eater’s into Hogwarts, and one time pretended to be a dementor on you.”
Harry contemplated telling her that there was something soothing about getting to eat breakfast without list-making but ultimately decided against it. Instead he smeared some of his boiled egg over his toast and slowly started to chew. Ron flung himself into the chair beside him, turning beseeching eyes onto Harry.
Ron’s head whipped around in alarm and he looked at her with despair. “Hermione, this is no time for jokes. It’s time for a sacred ritual between one man and the food he loves. That he will never, ever tell his mother about.”
Reassuring Hermione took some time, but Harry did it and then left them, slipping upstairs to get dressed and stare at himself in the mirror. His concentration on his own image was absolute: Harry looked at who he was now and tried to remember who he had been.
of Harry smiling as he walked down Diagon Alley, his hands sunk into his pockets, the wind ruffling his hair. Harry looked at picture-Harry making eye contact with the photographer and realised that the smile didn’t even completely disappear even then.
Malfoy sniffed. “Don’t be so ridiculous, Potter.” Still, he turned his hand so his palm was against Harry’s and stared down at it. “You just have to not ask stupid questions.” He seemed to hear himself and then frowned, “Or we can work on the language thing, I suppose.”
“But you shouldn’t have to owe anyone. You’ve done quite enough.” Hermione frowned, leaning forward and reaching for his hand. Her grip was firm and warm, fingers curling around his as she stared at him. It made his chest feel like it was expanding and Harry grinned back at her, folding their fingers together, grabbing her hand in his.
. Harry grinned at it and made himself the biggest mug of tea he could and drank it. He showered with the radio blasting, singing along to Motown songs that made his heart soar. He walked naked to his room without worrying about anyone seeing him and when he got there he let impulse guide him.
Harry studied him for a moment. Malfoy’s jaw looked tight and the bags under his eyes weren’t quite as prominent as the first time Harry had visited Malfoy Manor. He supposed he looked less skeletal, as if Malfoy had slowly started to eat, but there was still something about him that looked thoroughly different than Harry remembered him from school. Harry hated it: he didn’t like mysteries he felt he couldn’t scratch away at and solve. “Okay,” he said. “So other people visit?”
From the look on her face, Harry almost wished he hadn’t asked but two seconds later and she was raising her hands to twist at her hair. “Oh, I don’t know! You hear such awful stories about custody these days. Or all days, but I’ve been reading about it so it seems more prevalent right now.”
For a few seconds he was blindingly, achingly jealous and then he brushed it away. He was happy for them. They deserved it.
The smoothly related truth startled Harry. His fingers twitched around the teacup and some of the tea sloshed over the side onto his hand. Harry looked at it morosely, knowing he couldn’t lick it away. Instead he grabbed for a napkin, dabbing at his hand and looking at the floor in the hopes he hadn’t spilled any. “You aren’t getting on?”
Glancing around, Harry tried to square his shoulders and remind himself of her advice. Her voice had been rich, smooth, carelessly casual. He could be rich, smooth, carelessly casual and brazen. He could meet all their eyes and push through the odd gleam. Harry smiled at a few he recognised, tilting his head in acknowledgement at the others. Several smiled, but he could tell from looking at them that they weren’t quite sure what to make of his presence.
“You were smiling in the Prophet,” Malfoy said when Harry next saw him. Harry breezed into the kitchen, setting a bag down on the huge table. Malfoy glanced at it and then at Harry, who frowned at him. “No, not like that. You were smiling in the Prophet.”
He couldn’t see Ginny’s smile but he could hear it in her voice as she tipped towards him, resting her head against his shoulder. “That’s all I want for you, Harry.”
” Ron’s smile grew as he talked until it covered his face, bright as the sun. He watched Harry as Harry finished kneading the dough and left it to rest before coming over to sit beside him.
Harry lifted one shoulder. “Maybe,” he said, “but I’d rather have a bit of foolish hope about people, than not.”
“It’s not that bad, mate.” Ron clapped him on the back. “I mean, picture it again: the two of us, partners in wands. Ronald B. Weasley and Harmond J. Potter, esquires, Aurors.”
They stopped by a bench fairly far into the park, secreted away between two of the larger trees. There was a fountain not far from them, lazily gushing water. A redhead girl was sitting on the edge of it, her arm wrapped around a toddler in her lap, excitedly talking to him. Harry looked at them for a moment, feeling a flutter of loss in his chest, before he looked away.
Hermione obviously decided to let him have some space because he barely saw her until right before he was due to go to the Malfoy’s. She met him as he came down the stairs, a cup of tea in her hands and a worried look on her face. “Are you okay?”
Harry pulled a face again, this time at the ground. He looked at his feet and then back up at Malfoy. “I don’t think that’s how it actually is.”
Malfoy was quiet, adding ingredients slowly to the potion he was working on. “That sounds very nice,” he said. It felt like a whole minute had elapsed.
“Only to you, Potter. I’d make no such promises in a more general sense.” Malfoy looked extraordinarily pleased with himself. He lifted a hand to smooth over his hair, tucking it behind his ears as he looked around the kitchen and then back to Harry. “Potter, I don’t know why you’re stressing about this. It’s ridiculous. Everyone has known you wanted to be an Auror for years. Frankly, I’m sick of hearing it. You already know what you’re going to do anyway, don’t you? When you really think about it.”
Harry was staring at it as he walked further into the room and it was only when he heard a noise that he turned his head and saw Malfoy clutching a bottle of firewhiskey. He then saw Malfoy’s bed, a gigantic four poster. He
When he pushed open the door, he thought maybe it didn’t matter if it wasn’t. He would find one. He would find somewhere he loved and he would be okay.
The questions were mostly a blur, backwards and forwards and Harry frowning deeply at the prosecutor.
Ron shook his head. “Yeah and that’s it, isn’t it? You wouldn’t make me, but I know I should. It’s just — Mum got a bit. And you know what she’s like, but I don’t think she’s wrong, but I don’t know if she’s right either.”
Even though he didn’t walk too fast, he still arrived for his interview too early. He loitered outside and considered walking to one of the muggle coffee shops and buying a coffee. Then he thought about how rude it would seem when he appeared clutching one and decided against it. He walked up and down the street seven times and then took a deep breath and went in.
Hermione came home just before Christmas. Ron had known about it apparently, although he didn’t know the exact date. When she arrived, hair tied back into a severe bun, tiredness painted in purple under her eyes, Ron launched himself forwards, throwing his body at hers and gathering her close, breathing deeply. Harry watched his friends greet each other from the top of the stairs, the fervent kisses, the way that Ron kept looking at Hermione like she lit up his world just by being there.
Harry watched the door for a moment, trying to work out what was happening in his chest, why his breath was short, why he wanted to claw at his skin and chase after Malfoy all at once. He did neither. Instead, he took his own deep breath and then finished undressing before stepping in under the hot spray of the shower. He turned his face up to it, letting the spray hit his chest.  The water beat down, a constant rhythm, and Harry lost himself in it. He let his eyes unfocus and let the thoughts he’d been repressing all day bubble up. The water washed away the grime and Harry watched it swirl down the drain with unseeing eyes, focusing instead on memories: his parents, swirling out from Voldemort’s wand; every memory of them he’d ever encountered; every picture he’d seen, from the moment Hagrid had pressed the album into his hands; the graves he had visited last year; their faces when he went to the forest, when he’d met them and thought about death.
“Talk about it?” Harry repeated, like an idiot. He stared at his mug. “Do I not seem happy?” The idea that he didn’t seem happy was ridiculous to him.
Harry paused in his chopping and turned his head slightly to look at Malfoy, studying him as best he could from the awkward angle. Malfoy looked stiff, still, and cool, the way he tended to when he was trying not to betray what he felt. He thought about Malfoy in the corridor throwing a candlestick and talking about his house arrest. A decision made before he really thought about it, Harry knocked Malfoy with his elbow and said, “I’ll take you after you get out, sure. It was fun.”
“I can’t bear you either,” Harry said, feeling lighter. “Especially not when you’re chucking candlesticks at me. Can we sit somewhere there’s no candlesticks?”
Because Harry didn’t know what to say to that or where to look, he ended up looking at Yolanda. She stared back up at him, tongue lolling out of her mouth as she shifted so she was panting against the side of his leg. She lifted her paw and pressed it to Harry’s knee. He smiled at her and rubbed a hand over her head, scratching between her ears.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “You really can’t help yourself,” he said. “It’s ridiculous. You’re ridiculous.”
“If you’re not, you certainly don’t have to go to the Malfoy’s again. No one is going to think less of you for dropping whatever it is you’re doing now.”
It wasn’t just the open house of possible career ideas for Harry. For the next fortnight, Ron kept arranging things for Harry to do, with or without him. He visited some training grounds and different shops — apothecaries were added to the list but when the two of them stood out the front Ron turned to him and said, “Look, I think I might have gone a bit mad here, wanna grab a pint instead?” After they grabbed a pint, Harry led them to a park, a couple of tins purchased from the nearest off licence swinging from a bag. Time had somehow lurched past them and it was mid-October now: Harry loved the splendor it brought to the park. The trees curled above them, creating a colourful tapestry of bright oranges and reds tangling together over their heads. A steady, cool wind had whipped through and shaken a sheet of leaves free. Harry and Ron trampled through them as they walked, the plastic bag swinging from Ron’s hand. Their feet crunched on the leaves and Harry smiled at the sound.
Harry shrugged, then nodded, then trailed after Malfoy. They didn’t speak as they walked up the lane although Malfoy looked like he wanted to a couple of times, opening his mouth and then letting his words turn into a heavy breath that he expelled. It was cold enough that the unspoken words formed a cloud in front of them; Harry relished walking through it.
The room was huge, almost cavernous, and he could see doors in the back which clearly led to other rooms – pantries, probably. There was a massive table in the middle of the kitchen and part of it was covered in half-prepared ingredients, chopped onion and celery, a mound of peeled potatoes, a loaf of bread that had been cut and left under a stasis charm. The bottom part of the table seemed to be Malfoy’s seat of choice, for he headed there right away. A small cauldron sat simmering on the table and there were books spread out around it, a few bundles of parchment with Malfoy’s distinctive scrawl fanning out. Harry was mildly surprised to see that there were four different mugs cluttered around the outside of the parchment, a tell-tale mark of somebody absentmindedly making themselves tea and forgetting to bring a mug along. This seemed ludicrous and wasteful when Malfoy was apparently stationing himself
“Can I maybe not have you then?” Harry started trying to walk. Malfoy had clearly not expected it and he let him pass before making a sputtering noise and matching their steps. “I never placed the order and I’d like to return it.”
When Harry arrived home, Hermione and Ron were standing together in the kitchen, a covered pot boiling on the hob. They turned to look at him almost as one and Hermione blinked in shock.
Harry didn’t know why he had caved into an instinct so quickly. He didn’t know what brought him to a place where he blasted through anything that could be good for him.
“We’ll stay in bounds, Draco.” Harry thought he had the patience of a saint. “I promise not to hurt your feelings by thoroughly trouncing you a million times.”
“You’re a motivational speaker,” Malfoy said quietly. He moved his hands so they were lightly resting on the piano keys, fingertips barely brushing against them. Harry watched Malfoy’s hands dance up and down them, occasionally pressing a key in. The other boy hummed a disjointed melody but otherwise they sat in silence. Harry wasn’t sure what the strange atmosphere in the air was but he felt like it was almost close enough to touch.
“I could buy us a place.” They walked out of the small room into the larger transportation department, weaving their way in between crowds of people. Most of them were too caught up in their own lives to pay Harry or Ron much attention. “I mean, it’s not really a hassle. Or we could do up Grimmauld properly. I do keep saying I’m gonna.”
“It’s very kind of you, Harry,” Narcissa said, like a mediator, giving her son a sharp look. Draco undoubtedly could not see it from where he was sitting but it was evidently not an unknown tone of voice. He looked slightly abashed and then nodded, a silent agreement with his mother.
and that's the end!!! i wanted to say thank you again to everyone who read and enjoyed this!!! i was going to wait to post it and end it on my birthday but i figured...eh, i'll bung it up a couple of days early anyway, it's not like i'm going to have much time anyway.
Ron broke the silence, although he did not think to stop eating as he talked. “So how was it? Dad always says they’re a nightmare.”
“Okay.” There was a sigh that almost sounded like relief and then, “I’m not sure if I can give you any tips or whatever but it’s bound to be not that different, right?”
It struck Harry then that that was probably quite creepy and he took a few steps back and then made his footsteps louder as he approached the family room for the second time. This time, when he got to the doorway, both Malfoy’s were looking at it.
She started to cry again, but she was smiling and she launched herself at him, wrapping her arms around his neck. “They said they want me to come visit. They said they’re starting to remember. They said they want to
A bloom of colour appeared on Malfoy’s face but he did not acknowledge it. Stiffly, he said, “It looked like you were having fun.”
Nobody moved from the ground for quite some time. When they finally did it was to order a Chinese, which came as they were devising plans. Ron would get the Portkey sorted and Harry had money. Hermione protested and Harry insisted, solemn and serious, and eventually she nodded. They were going to ask a professional to go back to Australia with Hermione and Harry would pay them. The Grangers were going to come home.
“Really? Even with,” here Harry trailed off, not sure how to be delicate or even if he wanted to be. He found he did, though. He had always wanted to draw reactions from Malfoy, to claw at him with words and hands and drag up anger, or spite, to make his eyes flash with heat. He didn’t want that in the same way, anymore. He wanted the other boy’s attention, but he didn’t want to hurt him quite so badly. He hesitated, licked his lips and then said, softly, “Even with everything that has happened here.”
Hermione tried to be stern but it was hard to be stern when she wobbled as she walked and her eyes were bright with alcohol.
“Well, why don’t you tell me what the other stuff is?” Harry hated that Malfoy sounded calm and reasonable, things he frankly didn’t associate with him. He also hated that he felt so out of sorts that this seemed like a normal thing to be asked, to share his vague thoughts on his future with someone who had once broken his nose on a train just for the fun of it.
Ron came up behind Hermione and looped his arm around her waist, leaning over her to look at breakfast. “I quite agree, Hermionicus.”
Draco startled and looked up, his quill scrawling a line across the page. Harry sniggered but didn’t move, his laughter dying off as Draco scowled. It was a quick scowl, there and gone, clearly replaced by embarrassment.
They had both stopped, staring at each other, Harry’s heart in his mouth. Harry could not remember what he had said or done but he had been in his bed ten minutes later so he supposed that it must have been enough for no one to have an argument. He hadn’t written to Malfoy since. He wasn’t quite sure what to say. He didn’t know how to pick apart the dense forest of emotions somehow contained within his body, a thing he was emphatically
“Not particularly,” Narcissa said, voice devoid of any inflection. “House arrest is rarely fun for those placed under it and Draco is so young. Being cooped up does not agree with him.”
“Oh.” Draco was silent for a second and then he beamed at Harry, so wide and brilliant that Harry would have won another war to be given the gift of that smile again. “I was lying. When I said I didn’t know. I do know. I just thought — I thought you wouldn’t.”
There was quiet for a moment, a quiet that was only broken by the ticking of the clock that sat on top of the piano. Lavender studied him and then said, lifting one shoulder in a shrug, “Okay. I can help you. I have a lot of books about it, though, so I hope you like to read.” She stood up and started to walk. Harry noticed that she favoured her right side, putting less pressure on her left leg and then tried not to notice it as she turned and looked at him. There was a wicked gleam in her eye as she said, “Who am I kidding? I remember you. You don’t like to read.”
Harry nodded, slowly. The movement was awkward, considering he was still cradling his chin. He kind of wished he hadn’t done it. Ginny turned her face so she was looking directly at him, but she hadn’t yet sat up. Harry searched for an answer and said, “So you’re going somewhere then?”
Harry nodded, but he didn’t realise how much he had taken that to heart until he was standing in the courtroom, waiting for Draco Malfoy’s verdict. They had arrived too late to get a seat and the three of them, Harry, Ron and Hermione were pressed against the back row. Hermione rested her hip against the bench and was chewing on her lip, periodically turning to glare at anyone who whispered too loudly near them about something she did not like.
Malfoy looked over at him desperately and shrugged. “How am I meant to know, Potter? I’m no Seer. It just seems it.”
Malfoy continued to look at Harry oddly. They stared at each other and then Malfoy said slowly, “That’s not what I meant at all. You idiot. I wish I could tell you not to come inside looking like that but I know you’ll ignore me, so how about you shower instead?”
“Next week, maybe?” Patrick’s eyes are dancing and Harry smiles back and nods. He could do next week. He could do whenever.
Harry moved forward and pressed his lips against Draco’s softly. The kiss felt more like an exhale, a breath. His lips ghosted across Draco’s, feather light, and then he moved to place one at the corner of his smile. He kissed the tip of Draco’s nose and his forehead. He kissed his eyelids, tilting Draco’s head towards him. Draco settled his hands onto Harry’s shoulders and his fingers clawed at them. He bent his head in benediction towards Harry as Harry pressed worshipful kisses across his face. Draco held on tight and Harry felt like telling him he didn’t need to. He was here.
“You are the news,” Harry said. Malfoy opened his mouth to protest but then decided against it. Harry grinned, still tracing the quill against Malfoy’s jaw. A moment later, he leaned forward, dropping the quill, placing his fingers against the place where jaw met ear and coaxing Malfoy’s face around. “You’re the only thing I’m interested in, anyway.”
Harry sniggered, amused even by this for a reason he couldn’t name, and then slid his shoes off. He kept his coat and backpack and wound his way to the family room. From down the corridor, he could hear the sound of voices every now and again and music, which he realised must be the wireless. The door was propped open and the closer he got the brighter he felt.
