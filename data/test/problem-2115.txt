"Anything you want Master." Draco replied. "I didn't know how you would like to finish this so I left it for you."
Draco nods again.
And so Harry does. He picks Draco up bridal style as Draco holds him tight, as if afraid that if he let's Harry go then Harry would disappear. He walks out of the court room, ignoring the chaos, ignoring Mrs Weasley and Blackburn tearing up the prosecutor in to pieces, ignoring the press, ignoring everything. It's Draco who is important. He walks out of the room and with all his power, apparates out of the ministry into his bedroom. He sits on the bed, leaning his back on the bedpost, holding Draco on his lap as Draco rests his head on Harry's shoulders and cries. Harry does too. They sit there crying with each other. Harry doesn't understand what he can do to make Draco feel better.
"This study is the place he used to do it to me himself." Draco says quietly. "This is where he made deals about me. Its where he-" Draco paused, his voice cracking. "The mark." He finished heavily.
"But it's you who is the said submissive."
Someone knocked my door and my patronus vanished. I lifted the wards and opened the door. It was Luna. She smiled at me and told me it's time for dinner. I straighten my robe and ask her to accompany me to the washroom. I quickly wash my face and we go to the great hall.
Draco cried laying there, Harry pulled him up, hugged him close. He cried himself. He cried as he told Draco everything. He told Draco about them guilting him, manupilating him into leaving Draco, using him for fame and money, Ginny's behaviour and how Harry was with Ginny. Sleeping with blond men, calling out Draco's name, everything. How he has been in love with Draco the whole time, how he's been heartbroken, full of pain and regret to ever hurt Draco like that, that he still loves Draco and always will. There was no one else. Harry begged for another chance. Begged Draco to give Harry one more shot, that Harry will spend rest of his life making it up for him. Harry said that he loved Draco. Harry held Draco as he cried in Harry's arms, holding his shirt tightly in his fist, holding him close. They sat there for who knows how long, until Draco cried all he could, until his breathing was slow and even while he still held Harry, his head on Harry's chest.
Draco takes two minutes to calm down and finally replies after swallowing the lump in his throat.
"Mrs Malfoy." Harry greeted back.
Draco sighed and dropped his wand hand. Instead he pointed one finger, counting.
The only thing he remembered was a jet of red light, lots of screaming, probably Daphne and Astoria, hexes being passed on and falling on the ground.
"Language Pansy! And yeah she was terrible. I hated her from every fiber of my body." Draco said.
"Would you like to come for coffee?" Harry asks.
SIRIUS!
"That's horrible!" Harry said. Harry knew how it was to be starved. He never wanted himself or anyone else ever to go through it.
"For a while." Harry replies. "Get up."
Harry could feel the air crackling with his magic. He was furious. Draco held his hand and nodded, telling him to go along with it.
Pansy watches mesmerized as Zacharias Smith speaks on the Daily Prophet radio channel. He's one of those arrogant bastards who haven't yet looked at Pansy. Which is a winner for Pansy because men, they always look. Pansy was the top editor in the Daily Prophet, thanks to Potter getting rid of Rita Skeeter. But while running to make a career in this Slytherin hating world, when she turned turned 39, she didn't realised. So here she was, single and getting old even if she looks like she's 25, benifits of being magical. Magical people lived twice as muggles so they were pretty young till they were 45 at least. And all men who are available are either there for her body, wanting a good little beautiful slave or just sex.
"Oh just my natural charisma, I assure you." Draco replied amused.
-Bee [I'll be writing myself as Bee because we are two people who's nameÂ  start with B]
"Promise me."
"What do you get if you win?" Draco asks and Potter smiles. And salazar, Draco feels something flutter in his chest. A feeling he hasn't feel in so so long. He doesn't even remember feeling this good kind of flutter. He never felt it with Christian as well.
"So you say."
"Avara kadavra!" A green light appears
"Malfoy. Just what do you think are you doing?" He spat.
"What do you think about Harry liking you?" Marina asks.
"Very well. Brace yourself.
There was no way Draco would let this chance go. He blushed and gave Harry is hand. Belle and Pansy let out excited squeals. Blaise suggested to use the washroom as it was the closest. Draco led Harry to the washroom and closed the door behind him.
"I've never seen you smile like that looking at anyone. Not even Christian." Iris says. "I'm happy for you Draco. I hope he's treating you well.
I can't believe you did that pads. That blew
"Toys! Want!" Teddy says excitedly.
Harry smiled. He was proud. He stated that he is dropping the subject from his NEWTS because he doesn't want to be taught by someone so incompetent. He caught on Draco half way. He caught on Draco's wrists, taking Draco by surprise and pinned him on the wall. Draco's wrists firmly planted around his sides with Harry holding him. Harry looked down in his wide grey eyes.
"I'm willing to do anything. Trust me I've been thinking since morning how do I help change the situation." Belle agrees.
"And so, there I was, learning how to play a guitar by a drunk, homeless man at 3am in the morning." Draco continues. "I mean, I was playing piano and harp good as a professional by the time I turned 7 but it's guitar I always liked."
Pansy can feel something churn in her stomach, suddenly vanishing her appetite.
Belle's POV
Harry feels the satisfaction settle in as he watches the defeat in Spine's eyes and smiles.
Draco blushes and can feel the small tug on his lips as he smiles softly, looking at the blue carpet below. Potter's praises does wonders to him. He never did understand why but they do.
"First name? This ought to be good." Harry chuckled.
Since the first year I had understood how shitty the defence against the dark arts class is. So I had taken it up on myself to learn all the spells. I read a lot and practiced in empty classrooms. I had learnt the patronus charm in the beginning of fourth year. By the time first half of the term was over, I had learnt to send messages via patronus. Many people don't know that of course. I never showed off my skills. People call Granger the brightest witch but she can't do half of the spells I can. I learnt them all before she did and she is a year ahead of me. Courtesy of being friends with the golden boy.
"Give paw, Draco." He asks and streches his palm out, waiting for Draco to give his hand. Well, in this case, paw.
"I'll go wear some pants." He says with no enthusiasm. "You should as well, Potter." He says and leaves for their room.
Harry watches Draco breath. He loves watching Draco. Draco is a kink for him on its on. He really shouldn't be surprised with this realisation after accepting he's always been obsessed with him but he still is. He remembers the six years of watching the Slytherin, two tables away, in between the crowd. Harry can always spot him out like he's on the spotlight. He remembers noting Draco's every move, imprinting it in his brain. Like knowing that Draco plays with his nails when he's nervous, he loves reading fantasy fictions more than other genres, he always have sweets as much as he can during breakfast, he always rubs the green apple with a cloth before he bites on it, things as such. And he's still here, laying besides Draco, watching him lay there with his eyes closed and brows smooth with a content smile on his face. He can't stop himself. He won't stop himself. Draco is his and he can watch Draco for eternity if he wants. His hand still on Draco's arse, he tilts himself to snuggle Draco, get him in his embrace, and Draco, like his good pet, always comes.
Draco licks the entire shaft slowly, runs his tongue along the slit on the head the swallows the whole length of Potter's huge cock. His throat fighting the intrusion but still forcing himself to go deeper. He bobs his head, uses his tongue, uses three tricks out of his blowjob book which makes Potter moan. He somehow manages not to touch himself, which, you have to know, was not an easy task. Potter doesn't control this time. He lets Draco have free reign and do it however he pleases. Draco makes a mental note of all the things Potter liked and dislike. It doesn't take long before Potter cums moaning Draco's name and Draco, he's immensely proud of himself. So is his cock. Standing proud and hard inside his silk hot pink shorts.
"He's French royalty. His status was in French like the Malfoys once had here. If father could get him in his pockets then he'd have french ministry in his pockets. He was in so many filthy businesses. Mostly omega trafficking and creature killings. Father used me to get a seat in their ministry and he used my Father to get me. Which is why, exhiling them to France was pretty stupid decision of the ministry. No matter his reputation here, he's still pretty strong in France."
"That only exist in literature." Draco chuckles. "He, he makes me feel."
"You have weird kinks Potter." Draco smiles and closes his eyes again.
"I agree. He's just so much more manlier. And classier." Millicent Bulstrode walks towards them wearing tight leather pants. Life after war has been kind to her.
Harry feels something satisfying in him as the Hufflepuff boy's eyes widen and he scrambles back of. Harry turns to look at Draco who is staring at Harry with an unreadable expression. And then without a word, Draco turns back and walks into the carriage, sitting with his back at Harry. Harry sighs and walks towards other carriage where Neville, Luna and Ginny follow.
"Yes Master." Draco replied.
Harry nodded.
I blush at that message. He cares. I check the time. There's still forty-five minutes to four pm.
Where are you, Draco? He never disappears without telling Harry where he is going. And he left at least a three hours ago. To get ice cream. Something isn't right. His phone is unavailable as well. Is he alright? Is he hurt? Has something happened- No! He's fine. Harry will find him. He's fine. Draco is fine. Harry feels a hand on his shoulder.
"Of course he can!" Hermione squeaks again.
"This is my house!" She yells.
Harry turns to look at Draco who is standing still and looking back at Harry with wide eyes and mouth parted. He looks paler than he naturally is.
The receptionist's eyes widened and seeing Harry, his green eyes. She knew who Harry was talking about. She stammered and pointed at Draco's direction. He dashed towards the direction, Ginny, Luna and Neville behind him. He saw Daphne and Astoria were hurt and bandaged. His heart was beating fast, he was almost afraid to look at Draco.
Impossibly, Draco's eyes go darker, he gives another moan and a nod. Harry tugs on his hair a bit tighter and pushes Draco further down his cock. He bucks his hips up and feel the tightning of Draco's throat. Draco gags and tries to take Harry even more deep. Harry helps him until Harry's cock is fully inside his tight, warm throat and holds him there for a few seconds, gagging Draco. Draco coughs and tries to breath through his nose. Slowly, Harry pulls him up only to push him down again. Repeatedly. He uses Draco's hair to push him up and down Harry's cock while Draco uses his tongue and is careful with his teeth. Harry slowly fastens the pace until he is effectively and aggressively fucking Draco's throat. Soon enough, Harry's balls tighten and he cums in Draco's mouth, which Draco hungrily swallows. Harry losens his hold on Draco's hair. Draco licks Harry's cock clean and with a pop, leaves Harry's cock.
"Why?" Draco whined.
"Yep." Harry replies.
"Potter told Draco that he can say no." Theo says.
"That's enough, Ralph." Hera controls her sob.
"Also, Wood will not be able to handle Draco's neurotic arse. Hyde on the other hand can very well deal with whatever Draco throws his way. Figurative and metaphorical way." Zabini walks to the table and places two glasses, pours something like scotch in them. Passes one glass to Lavender and kisses her. Gasps fill the room.
"Stay here. I'll get it." Cormac says and leaves for the bathroom.
"The point is," Ginny interferes. "Draco doesn't trust anyone easily. He might like you all but he won't trust you all. He has only just started trusting me and even that is because I've been living with them. He's an extremely private person and will not share with you unless he trusts you like he trusts Harry or the Slytherins. Or except he's extremely drunk."
They said their goodbyes, promised to visit soon, which Draco had a feeling they would. They walked in comfortable silence, hand in hand, close to each other until they reached the apparation point. Potter grabbed his hips, pulled him close and captured his lips in a deep kiss. Between the kiss, Draco felt the pull in his stomach and there they were, kissing in their- Potter's bedroom.
"Thanks." Draco replies.
"Meow" He speaks softly.
Harry grabs Draco by his hair and starts forcing himself in his mouth faster. Draco could feel Harry's hardness getting harder and bigger. Harry thrusts himself in Draco's throat so hard and fast that Draco gags. His mascara stained tears roll down his eyes. Harry is too much for him but he still doesn't stop and continues to gag on Harry's cock. While gagging, Draco uses his tongue to give Harry sweet sensations.
"Your receptionist Anita is sleeping sleeping with your assistant Clark." Pansy grins like a cat.
"Later Pansy. Promise. Go now." I say. She kisses my cheek, then kisses Teddy's cheek and leaves.
"Belle." We look at Pansy. "We can't let anyone know that we are helping. The dark lord, he will kill our parents then us. No matter which side they are on, they are still our parents. So I need you to make an unbreakable vow that no one will ever know you've been helping us. Once everything is done, slowly we will allow you to tell the truth. Are you willing to do that?" She asks.
"You look, conservative. But it's not you."
"You know that's not what it's about. I'm worried about you, Draco."
"Teddy. Meet your uncle Draco."
"You don't like her." Pansy states.
"Are you still mine?" Potter asks.
"In the end, what I mean is that Draco is a marked Slytherin. He's emotionally and mentally not ready for the backlash this will bring him. He's already going through so much. I forbid you to add on it. At least not until he's ready for it." Theo comands and drags Astoria out there without another word.
Harry pulls up Draco's skirt and stares at Draco's fine arse which has some pending bruises of the bites Harry had given yesterday. But what interests him more is the sky blue jewel sparkling on the edge on the buttplug Draco is wearing. The buttplug that is matching with the magical cock ring that Draco is wearing that will prevent him from having orgasm. Only Harry can remove it. Or the safeword. Harry raises his hand high and smacks it hard directly over the plug and Draco groans as the plug jerks against his prostrate. And with another spell, the plug starts vibrating. Hard. Draco moans as his head and eyes roll back.
"Just because you are comfortable going out dressed like a caveman, Potter, doesn't mean I am too." Draco replies and Harry again, groans.
"That's a nice song." Potter says. "I missed your singing."
Astoria sits on the chair besides him and holds his hand on the table.
Father puts my face close to Potter's forcing me to make eye contact. If I say yes, he will be killed. If I say no, he will be killed anyways. There's only one way to buy him some time.
Mr Holland gives us our belongings. We quietly walk towards Draco's room. Draco understood that I needed to be left alone. He gave me a kiss and went to Teddy's room with Teddy. I look at the comforter. It was of various colours and patterns. There were lilies, full moon, wolf, a black dog, a rat, a stag, a doe and starts embroyed on it. This was made by the people I love. Also made by the traitor who got them killed. Still, it was made by their love. I hold it and cry. I cry a lot. After few minutes of crying, I feel arms around me. I'm being hugged by Draco. I snuggle into his chest and cry some more. After a while, I open one of the journals to read.
"Then let him in." She places a hand on Draco's knee.
"Draco." Harry calls out and Draco turns around.
"Belle?" I saw a fiery red hair booming in the light.
Belle's POV
"People, if on our first seven years of Hogwarts, anyone would've told me that my best mate will end up marrying his enemy, I would've myself drop them at St Mungo's." The crowd laughed. "But as time went by and I saw how happy Malfoy made Harry, I couldn't help but be happy myself. Malfoy, oh sorry. Now your Potter. Potter, you've made our life hell. Not because you were an asshole, I mean that was there, but moreÂ  because Harry just won't shut up about you. I'm so glad that now you're with him because now we won't have to listen to him ranting about you 24/7 the way we did in school. I wish you both a very happy life and many children." Ron gave his toast and everyone had a drink.
"Malfoy. I have a preposition for you." Potter says.
"I like you too." Luna smiled genuinely.
"Don't worry. This will be our little secret." She assured me.
"No professor. I don't want to put any charges." Draco says.
Harry looks at Draco, who still hasn't moved his hands and they've got to be hurting by now. Draco doesn't look at him. Instead, Draco looks at the floor and looks awfully close to crying. This momentarily scares Harry. His hands immediately go to Draco's wrists, untangling them from Draco's back and pulling it out front. Draco winces at the pain. Harry pulls Draco in for a hug and holds him close. It takes a while but Draco then rests his hands on Harry's chest. Harry hears a sniff.
"Draco. I don't know how to tell you this. Will you, uh, you know, uh, will you like to, umm, go out with me?" Harry asks nervous.
Draco bites his palm over his teeth, trying to control a sob. This is where his marriage has come. When his husband no longer cares about their 20th marriage anniversary.
"What is it with her? What is wrong with her? Why has she been all snapping and hitting? And- Is he touching her hair?" Scorpius looks at where Rose went to see an older Ravenclaw tucking her hair behind her ear. And she's smiling????
"I have it in my bag." Draco whispers and hands Harry a bag that wasn't there before. Draco takes out the ingredients as Harry prepares for the ritual. He follows the rituals and casts the chants so that they don't have any magical signatures left on property. He takes Draco and apparates them back to Grimauld place. As soon as they reach Grimauld Place, Harry pulls Draco in for a deep kiss. Draco moans into it.
Pads. You sighed this morning when Remus woke up.
We get up and I erase the silencing charm. We leave the dorm with Diana glaring at us. Merlin I hate her. I have a feeling she'll be selling me out. We step in the common room and my heartbeat drops. How am I supposed to select one child? Luna is feeling the same. She takes my hand and gives it a gentle squeeze. We walk towards the first kid we see is sitting alone. She is a first year, has blonde pigtails and is working on her homework. We tell her to pack her stuff and that we are getting her to a safe place. Her eyes light up amd she runs to her dorm. We tell her not to tell anyone anything.
"Shushhh." Draco said and cupped her cheeks. "You look beautiful my Buzzy Bee. I'm so proud of you." Draco kissed her forehead.
"We found the student. It was a fifth year Ravenclaw Melanie Wilson." McGonagall says.
Draco's in a haze. There's a fog clamping his brain. He blinks several times before he can register the question his Master just asked.
He looks at Draco as he gives a shaky nod after swallowing again. His breathing is laboured and lips are still quivering. Harry doesn't think Draco has it in him to make any sound at the moment. Harry somehow manages to ignore the pleading eyes and turns Draco around. The curtains finally stop burning when there is not left anything of it to burn. He holds Draco's wrists in the same position and walks Draco to the corner near the window. He holds the galleon and makes Draco hold it on the wall with his nose. He leaves Draco's wrists and is pleased to see that Draco doesn't dare move is hands to get comfortable.
"Good boy, Draco. Good kitten. Such a nice boy." Harry babytalks as he strokes through Draco's hair with his other hand.
"Keep the scars. Heal them but don't make them disappear. It's important. Can you do it?" Harry asks.
"Little grass, you literally have bigger problems right now and you're asking me how I am holding up?"
I take Teddy in my arms.
"I'm sorry." Draco says, his voice craking. "Please don't be mad at me." And he finally sarts sobbing.
Ginny and Hermione are playing frisbee against Ron and Astoria. He laughs as he watches Ron fall then looks back at the sea. The sun is setting down painting the sky in various colours. It's beautiful but has got nothing on the sunrise they saw early in the morning. Draco always was partial towards sunrises. He looks at his toes as he curls it in the warm sand. He feels Potter sit behind him and bind him in an embrace by his arms and legs. Draco leans back as he allows himself to be held completely. Who would've thought that he would end up here with his childhood nemises now lover? If three years ago anyone had told him that he would be in love and would be loved so fiercely by Harry Potter, he would've admitted them in Janus Thickery ward of St Mungos. Bur here he is. Loved and owned by Harry Potter and he's free.
You'll have to live a good life for us Bee. We are proud of you. I'll always be happy knowing my sister is free no matter what fate I am facing. That will be enough for me.
"Yes, but he's a feminine man." Neville replies.
"Okay. So, it was summer holidays in fifth year. I told my parents that I'm going to out Theo when I actually was going to a muggle bar to get laid." Pansy could tell this tale to everyone without mentioning that it was a bar for trans people without outing herself and Belle knew that as Pansy had told many Slytherin about this. But only Belle, Theo, Blaise and Draco knew she was trans. "I got a bit drunk on wine and met this really cute guy called Marvin. He flirted with me and we hit it off. I was soon gonna be in Hogwarts so I didn't mind a random hookup with a muggle. He took me to his place, which was filled with dead animals. Dear head, bear head, tiger skin, etc, everywhere. I was so creeped out. Still we went ahead and made out a bit. Entire time we were kissing, I could feel the eyes of that dead bull fixed on his wall at me. I could feel his dead eyes staring at me. When we were having sex, he howled instead of moaning. Howled like a wolf. Then he tried to roar like a tiger. While having sex he tried to make so many animal voices. I pushed him, wore my dress back and ran out of there." Pansy said than fake shivered to show how creeped she was. Everyone laughed.
"Don't call me that!" Harry snapped.
"In my room. I had the elves remove and clean my old crib and Pansy buy blankets and toys for him. Daphne and Millie are helping me prepare a nursery for him." This is the most Draco has ever spoken to her.
Then Draco just looks at Christian.
Draco can feel the magic force him to stand. And he tries to defy but the can't. The compulsion makes him do it anyway and so he stands and he knows he can't go back on his knees or sit or do anything else but stand until Potter tells him otherwise. And Draco, he's extremely hard.
"We need to talk." Rose says, determined
- Bee.
"I feel like I don't know you anymore. Draco Malfoy riding the bus. I think we should introduce ourselves again. Hi. I'm Harry Potter." Harry stretches his hand for a shake.
It takes a better part of twenty minutes for Draco to calm down and he holds on tight to Harry through it all as if afraid that Harry will leave him. Harry stands there, holding Draco throughout the whole time. He slowly drags Draco towards the bed and makes him sit. Once Draco is sitting, Harry makes him drink water, which Draco slowly sips. Harry looks at Draco, his eyes and nose all red. His cheeks and chin pink, his long nlond lashes wet. He still looks extremely beautiful but Harry doesn't feel that good kind of giddiness which he usually gets watching Draco cry after they play. Instead, he feels his chest hurt in pain. Oh, how he wishes that he hadn't have to punish Draco. He places the glass back on the table and stretches his hand to caress Draco's cheek. Draco flinches and Harry feels his chest hurt more terribly. Harry can feel his eyes burning with tears but he somehow controls himself.
Bee. Are you okay? I heard that asshole motherfucker Crabbe used a crucio on you. I swear its taking every bit of my will power to not skin him alive. I hope you're fine.
He fondly touches his red collar. He loves that collar. Even though it's getting a bit worn out. He only removes it while having bath. It is not wide enough to cause him discomfort while sleeping. Potter had got him the black one as well in case he needs to match his outfit but he hasn't let go of this collar even for a day. That black one still lays somewhere in a drawer packed and completely new. This collar, Draco is so used to it that it is like a part of his skin now. Half of the time he doesn't even remembers he's collared. He wears this everyday almost all the day. Even when he goes out. Even at the burrow now. It's a part of him. A part he never wants to let go. Proof that he belongs to Potter.
It worked. Good. Draco has the sense to look abashed as he gives Harry a faint meow.
I relate to Tinkerbell because if I don't get attention I'll die!
"So kids." Said professor Storm after a lengthy, glorified introduction of himself. "Nightmares seem to be a normal problem among us who were there in a war. Thanks to the death-eaters."
"Everyone wants to be with me for my body. Only want a dumb and pretty trophy wife. I'm not that kind. I can kill without even having my robes dirty." Pansy replied.
Draco curses inside as he tries to hide his blush. He lets his hair fall on his cheeks.
Harry barely manages to nod. Malfoy scrapes his fingers through Harry's hair and Harry gives a content sigh. Malfoy pulls Harry a bit out of the shower, takes the shampoo bottle and pours a bit on his wild hair. He places the bottle back and gets both his hands on Harry's hair. Manicured fingers gently massaging Harry's scalp. Harry closes his eyes and lets Malfoy do whatever he wants. Malfoy closes the distance between them, close enough for their cocks to touch a bit for a few second. This is enough to get Harry harder.
"Neville leave me at once. Where the fuck are you taking me you fucking dickhead, arsehole, bastard!"
"Even if you didn't want to. Even if that hurt you. You would let me do it." Harry states instead of asking.
"Getting off on other people's sexual life, are you, head auror Robards? Mrs doesn't please you anymore?" Draco smirks.
Harry takes a deep breath.
Draco thanks Hermione and looks at Harry. Harry walks at him and caresses his cheek. His cheek, that has a slap mark. Someone fucking slapped Draco. Now this is going to get bloody.
Theo and Ginny reach Diagon Alley. Ginny leads the way to the shop where they can get hearing aids. The healer does a few tests on Ginny. Theo holds her hand the entire time and doesn't leave her at all. Ginny doesn't need the hand holding but she appreciates it and likes it as well. She smiles at Theo. When they finally get the hearing aids, Ginny happily grins at Theo.
"If your husband would've been alive, would you have still met Ralph?" Draco asks quietly.
"They literally ruined our childhood. I was seven and I was forced to stop having pink things because I had to be a grown up before even I was eleven. I remember all my soft toys being destroyed so that I can act as an adult. Apparently having toys is for babies, which apparently me, a seven year old, wasn't." Pansy laughed a fake laugh.
"Does it to you?" She asks back.
Bad things- camila cabello
Draco blushes. He doesn't understand Cormac. He's so nice to Draco when he has all reasons not to be.
"Draco! Draco please. I've fallen for you. I've fallen in love with you. You're in love me, you know that. Don't leave me. Please."
"A gift for Draco." Harry smiled.
"Are you okay?" Harry asked.
"Nope. Slow down."
"She'll be fine." Blaise said.
"Like you obey me, my Slytherin snake?"
"Draco, have a bit please. Just little. You haven't eaten anything since four days." Harry begs.
"How did it go?" Draco asked over the phone as he cut the tomatoes.
"You're perfect Pansy. I like you the way you are, no matter what body parts you have or don't have." Luna smiles at her.
"She's got fever. I'm taking her to St Mungos." Darien sneered.
Songs
Draco walks inside the sanctuary, planning to meet Nan. Instead of walking straight towards her room, he walks towards the kids area. He stands outside quietly, looking inside. Potter is in there, making that beautiful stag patronus dance and prance along, making the children laugh. He was laughing as well. He was so handsome. With one last glance, he turns and walks to his nan's room. The laughter and noises can be heard till Nan's room.
All he gets that day are a few laughs, Malfoy's no and detention by Madam Pince for screaming in the library.
"Come." He says in that authoritative tone that Draco found sexy. He nods. Potter walks towards the kitchens and Draco follows him. One step behind. Harry tickles the pear on the portrait and the kitchen doors swing open. They enter the kitchen and Harry gets him a chair. He motions Draco to sit on the chair. A silent order. Draco, a good boy as he is that no one believes, obeys. Potter goes to some elves and they give him two plates of fruits and sandwiches.
"No. I'm thinking how money makes us dance to various tunes." Cormac replies.
He doesn't know how long it's been since he stays in that position. His jaw and back aches. His body feels heavy and his mind is foggy, fuzzy. He feels hands drift through his hair and he gives a silent hum. He still doesn't open his eyes. He's not in this world anymore. He feels like he's drifting as he floats in the fuzziness in his mind. He's high and he doesn't want to come down. The hand massaging his scalp feels extremely good.
"I know it wasn't a Ravenclaw that's giving you information." Luna says slowly.
"I don't know what I can do to make you believe, my sweet pet. But leaving you is something I don't intend to do. Ever. I've never been able to leave you well enough alone. Always been obsessed with you. Even when I was supposed to be with Ginny, I couldn't get you out of my mind. Stalked you literally to death one year. When Ron used to talk about Hermione, I used to stalk you on the map. You know what, Ron and Hermione weren't even surprised when I told them that I like you. Do you know how that conversation went? Would you like to know?"
"Would you like an orgasm? You deserve a reward." Potter grins.
He takes a deep breath and slowly looks at Potter, who is looking back at him lovingly with an adorning smile. Potter pulls Draco's hand near his lips and gives his knuckles a soft kiss with his chapped lips.
"You let us go right now, boy or it wouldn't-" and uncle Vernon started screaming in between his sentence.
"I've spent more than half of my life like this. I can wait a few more months." Narcissa smiled.
"Will anyone tell me what's happening?" Ginny yelled.
"Harry relax. You look like you're gonna shit yourself." Ginny chuckles.
Harry enters the dorm. Loud music, no wait, art, as Malfoy calls it is blaring. Malfoy is singing along loudly while he packs his homework. Homework which Harry should finish as well but its okay. The D.A.D.A. professor adores Harry. Well, Harry Potter, not Harry but it is adoration the same. She will give Harry extra time. Harry sits on Malfoy's bed and switches of the music. Malfoy turns and gives him a scowl.
Harry chuckles. His pet is still a bit out of it so it seems.
"Her name is Nura." Harry laughed.
"Through and through young man." Nicholas grins.
"Just as weird as yours I suppose." Harry laughs.
"Harry, don't go." Draco says, his voice cracking.
"How does it work?" Harry asks.
"Like my aunt is getting along a well trained crup. He sits quietly and feeds himself with all the food the elves make."
"Take of your knickers." Harry commands.
"I miss her. I miss them both." Draco tells as he stands in the graveyard in Godric's Hollow. Harry waits patiently as Draco places flowers on Hera and Ralph's combined graves.
"Oh, I know guys like you. She'll never heal while staying with someone like you." Pansy says, her voice hard and cold.
"He says I have a choice. That I can say no." Draco tells Theo. Theo instantly grips him tighter. Draco breaths.
"That's true. Its freaky. She's so Slytherin. The time I spent knowing her, she hates people, she will kill you if you try to comfort her, unless she isn't too exhausted to finally let you comfort her, or is close to you in a different level. Also she'd rather kill herself than face her emotional problems." Ginny explained.
"You are his everything. Entire year I've seen him look at you like he has hearts in his eyes." Ron replies.
"So the rules are that I have to say no to everyone but say yes to you?"
"What is?" Astoria asks softly.
Draco walks towards the couch in the common room, Potter and Longbottom are sitting on. He 'accidentally' sits on Potter's lap instead of besides him. The common room goes quiet. He grinds his arse a bit on Potter's cock and gets up.
"Please stop!" Draco screams.
"I made Vincent Crabbe do it." Draco replied. "He could do it so I made him do it."
"Ginny?" I asked as I saw her coming from hiding.
"Was it good?"
"Please tell him if he changes his mind, I'll be there to talk to him. And please apologize for me. Tell him I'm sorry for pestering him."
"People? What's the occasion?" Darien asks.
Prongs please. She already thought you were an idiot. You just upgraded to super idiot. That was hilarious
Golden shower
He told Dumbledore that it's difficult to imagine him as a boy. He asked if his parents called him professor Dumbledore as well!
"No I couldn't. Tell me Mr Shacklebolt, would you have believed me, a boy with a dark mark, a Malfoy no less?"
"I'm not, pet. I'm just going to the loo for a minute." Harry tries to reassure him.
- Bee
"I've never told you this before, but I'm glad to have you in my life." Harry says. He's emotional and overwhelmed.
Draco took the semi fixed umbrella and ignored the curious gaze Potter gave him. He understood Potter's curious stare as to why a pureblood Malfoy would travel in muggle bus. But Draco loved busses. It was a way to be alone in a roon full of people where he could watch the scenery out. It is why he loved Hogwarts express as well. Floo and apparation always meant no getting to watch the roads. He later realised that he still had Potter's book in his hands. He yelled at Potter from inside the bus and showed his book. Potter smiled as he yelled back.
"So, what would you do after becoming a paralegal?" Darien asked.
"I'm not a baby." Draco mumbles with his brows drawn and cheeks pink.
"Oh, children." Draco hears and turns.
Soon a knock can be heard. Ginny dashes out to the door and opens it. It's little grass. Ginny immediately hugs her tightly and kisses her hair.
"Tell what about Potter?"
Make you mine- panic at the disco
- Bee
"Well, in that case, will you be able to forgive me?" Darien asks quietly.
Songs:
He gives a dirty smirk as Draco looks at him with wide pleading eyes. His breathing hard and the outline of his erect cock visible from the skirt. Harry watches with smug satisfaction as Draco squeezes his legs as a pathetic attempt to ground himself. He groans as Harry's grin widens and the vibrations become even more hard and fast.
In theory, yes
"A pet?"
Harry's eyes widened. He knew how cruel people could be about homosexuality. Especially family. He knew that if he was still staying with his uncle and aunt, it would've been even more abusive and torturing if they had found out that Harry was bisexual.
"Try telling us that your hair is black colour." Blackburn says.
Harry kisses Draco slowly, just the lips and then nibs on his bottom lip gently.
Harry took the comforter and placed it on them. They both soon fell asleep in each other's arms.
"Fucking finally." Pansy smirked.
"You could've come to the order." Kingsley replied coldly
Owls! We can use owls. We'll give owls some of their stuff like a scarf or tie or something and ask the owls to drop it of anywhere in Hogsmade.
Draco looks at Harry with these large red and grey eyes with his nose red and face all pink. His hair sticks out from everywhere and with those wide watery eyes, he looks beautiful. Harry tells him so and the small chuckle he gets makes Harry smile wider.
"I think you do."
"Hello there, my love." Teddy grins.
"Now." Belle demanded.
Butter is just food lotion
"He kissed me." Draco blushes.
"It was nice knowing you, Pansy Parkinson." Neville smiles at her as they sit in the restaurant after a long day of shopping.
"Draco, he's Nicholas Barnes." Draco's mother introduces him.
Theo got veritaserum and they all took empty glasses and Pansy handed everyone a dropper. Theo poured a little of that liquid and everyone's glasses.
"Yeah." Harry replied.
"Alright."
"You're a traitor Draco. You will see his filthy blood spill and you'll see him die a slow, painful death." Dark Lord laughs. "Crucio!"
Pansy leaves, leaving a shocked Zacharias Smith like that. She couldn't get herself to give a fuck that she just outed the guy publically. She can't care. She's hurt and he was the one who caused the hurt.
Draco sings with Hermione. Harry, who has given up on his homework listens to Draco singing. Draco has been in cheery mood since he found out he's not poor anymore and will not be as the investments and bonds his father made on his name will keep getting him money. Its sureal, looking and Hermione and Draco like that, sitting together and singing along like all those years Draco bullied Hermione never happened. That night they had sex again, only, Draco didn't get to cum. Harry slept like a baby.
Earl.'
Bee hope you're okay. Please see this as soon as possible.
"You think there's a chance?" Scorpius asks.
"Wow. You ramble quite a lot when embarrassed. Was it like I like you kinda kiss or I need to have you right here right now kinda kiss?"
"Would you look at that? It rang so underneath the ground and all around magic." He said as he picked up Draco's call.
Harry prepared a dark chocolate Marjolaine but instead of the pastry, he made it a cake. He made honey-lemon drizzle pastries along with it, raspberry dark chocolate sauce, lemon cheesecake mousse, lemon tarts and Madeleines. He put it on statis to keep it fresh but to not over freeze it when he heard the the door jingle. It was Ron and Hermione.
"How did this happen?" Healer asks as Cormac helps hold Millicent.
"It felt good. It was so quiet, Harry. So quiet and my mind was all fuzzy and it was so good and fuzzy. It was good. And fuzzy." Draco sniffs.
Draco knew how that felt. Somewhere, Draco still loved Darien. He would be the happiest if Darien came back, and everything went back to how it was. The romace, the laughter, the love, Draco missed it so much, ached for it.
"No offense taken." McGonagall smiles.
"You're not going to leave that, are you?"
"We dont care about his parents. They deserve the fate they've got. We care about Draco, Minister." Said Pansy. "Plus we need to make sure the truth is out in the world so that he gets rid of the tag 'Death-Eater'."
"Fine. You give us information of every person important to him and their positions and I'll get you out of this place." Harry promises.
Boy I've been reading an amazing fanfic with grey Harry but unfortunately its wip. Like mine. Also i read percy jackson first series. Does anyone else feel like percy jackson is a crack fic for heterosexual drarry shippers???
McGonagall gave Pansy a hug and gave her certificate.
"Belle?" I heard Blaise calling. He came and stood besides me. "Can I join?" He asked.
They stand there in silence, finishing their cigarettes. Even though, they barely said a word to each other, this is the most civil they have ever been with each other and Harry relishes in it. Malfoy stops the music and without a word, turns and leaves the dorm. Harry rememers how Malfoy looked during his trials. Face completely blank of any emotions, just standing there silently. His eyes gave him away though. Those grey eyes dark and broken. Something that day flipped a switch over how he felt about the blond. Or more like, finally made him realise how he felt about the blond, and anger and hatered wasn't it.
"Give me one reason why I should hire you, Ms Parkinson?" Elizabeth asks.
I pack a bag with Teddy's extra clothes, his bib, couple toys and extra diaper. I ask Tilly to pack his lunch and then take him to meet Aunt Romie. He plays a little with Aunt Romie and we talk about how smooth everything is going. I don't tell her about Hogwarts because I don't want her to worry. She looks more sick and tired. I doubt she'll last long. Only two minutes left to 2 pm. I say goodbyes and then floo to McGonagall's office with Teddy.
"Well, that's good, my love. I promise to always keep you happy, laughing and entertained." Nick says as he playes with her fingers.
"Oh, you are a skilled occlumence? You needed to learn when you were playing house with He Who Must Not Be Named?" Storm sneered.
Pansy glares at him as she takes a deep breath. She smiles an entirely fake smile.
"Healer! She's drunk poison. Please!" He drags healer towards his house. He opens the door hastily and the healer stops dead on the tracks, looking at the prostitue.
Darien asks her to go in the room and walks in the kitchen where Draco is making tea. They sit at the table as Draco pours tea for them.
"Did you see it yourself?"
"Potter?" He calls after having a seat. "You can sit here." Draco smiles, hoping to Merlin that he isn't embarrassing himself.
It had been a couple of days since they had spoken about the scars. Harry had made it his mission to heal Draco's scar. He want nothing but the marks he had left on Draco's body. Slowly and surely, he was going to heal them, physically, emotionally, mentally. He opens the vial that had the salve which cured the scars from the time he was cursed by the four siblings. Draco sits on the bed wearing only some sweatpants, leaning on the bed post, his hair tied in a ponytail. Harry sits facing towards him and looks at the salve. He remembers Ron buying it immediately as soon as it had came out, even though it was a bit expensive for him. He remembers Hermione's tears of relief when the 'mudblood' carved on her hand disappeared forever. He remembers holding Hermione while Ron applied it on her hand. Ever since the war, some woman had successfully made this salve that got rid of each and every scar, even the ones created by dark magic. And Harry was about to use it on Draco. He scoops a bit of the salve on his two fingers, slowly spreads over the 'TRAITOR' written on his pet's chest. Its from the same knife that was used on Hermione to wrote 'mudblood' and was done by the same person. Bellatrix Lestrange. Harry hated that woman. He hates the maniac laugh and everything she represents. He remembers holding Dobby in his arms as slowly his breath was taking away, just like his life. He pushed the painful memories aside and concentrated on the scars.
"I'm friends with psychopaths. If I didn't know that you both had some morals, I'd be shitting my pants right now." Ron sighs. "Alright. First we need to meet Narcissa. We need to know everything about the contract. One mistake and many lives will be at risk." Ron, ever the strategist helps.
I am called to ballroom. I really don't want to go anywhere near them. When I reach to ballroom, the sight in front of me feels like the ground has vanished. Harry FUCKING Potter has got caught with Granger and Weasley. Shit!
"Longbottom!" Pansy sighs.
Harry says.
"Shall I order for you?" Harry asked.
"He hit you again, didn't he?" He asks and her face falls. "Narcissa? Why? Why don't you leave him?"
"Not really. I was almost done. What is it, my love?"
"She's right." I sigh. "We can only do three or four students a week."
"Yes Potter. Do tell me how a filthy habit smoking is. I'm dying to get your opinion on this." Draco, the bastard still smirking, said.
"Divorce is still seen as a taboo, Harry. And no matter how accepting of muggleborns some purebloods are, they're still traditional purebloods. You remember how much Molly hated Fleur for having creature inheritance? And my Gran who forbid me to marry a muggleborn. Some things can't be changed."
"No worries about that young man. Your father had that one coming. If I didn't know you needed to do this, I would've done it myself."
"Um, Malfoy?"
Harry turns around and gives the man a smile.
"Endured the torture until they figured it out." McGonagall replied.
Draco does. He blinks twice then turns his face to his side so he's facing Harry's crotch again. Harry's erection can be seen through his jeans and it hardens more when Draco licks his lips. There is a crazy power rush in being fully clothed when Draco is practically naked. Harry undoes his belt and then his jeans. He pulls it down and his cock springs free. He wasn't wearing any pants. He stands behind Draco's head and tilts it all the way down so Draco's throat gives easy access. Draco's entire body is on the bed but his head is unsupported, tilted down to expose his long pale throat wrapped up in the red O-ring collar.
"Hi guys. New people I see." He smiles at them.
Astoria sighs.
"I'll try not to." He said in a small voice.
"You know," says Harry. "Kingsley, minister Shacklebolt himself had come to check on me two weeks ago. With a mediwitch. To check if Malfoy had put me under any curse or potion. You know whay they found out?"
Lucius slams both hands on the table and glares at her.
Draco's night didn't go well. He was too turned on to be asleep. His cock kept getting hard after faltering down. Orgasm denials turned him on and he was sure that Potter won't let him orgasm for the night. And he prayed that Potter won't this morning as well. But this was torture. Not being allowed to touch and definitely not being allowed to cum. But maybe if he just rubs his palm over his pants a little. Just a little friction to ease the erection, no one has to know. He sighed and dropped his hands above his head. He didn't want to disobey Potter. He obeyed people because he had to, but it was different with Potter. He obeyed Potter because he wanted to. And he didn't want Potter to be disappointed in him. He had his father to do that. He closes his eyes and forces himself to an uneasy sleep.
"That makes sense, I guess. But why don't we all know this?" Harry asked.
We all sit in awkward silence. I ask them to show me bathroom and they do. Once I'm out of bathroom I see Belle signalling Zabini to come with her. They look suspicious. I follow them to see what they're upto.
I went to open the door as soon as I heard a knock. I checked on myself and went to open the door. As soon as I opened the door I smiled at the lot and they smiled at me nervously. Well, everyone instead of Potter. He looked at me as if I've grown a second head. He looked at me up and down until finally his eyes stuck on my pants. Harry Potter was checking me out! I felt my cheeks burn.
"I think it's a good idea. I'll be happy to. I'll ask them as well." I smile and Say.
"Quite a lot."
Draco looks at him and he is surprised to see unshed tears in Christian's eyes. This is the first time he's ever seen Christian with tears. He knew Christian was an overly emotional person. The way he was with Draco was enough to show that, but he never showed tears. Draco could feel his heart breaking. He loved Christian, but not in a way Christian deserved to be loved. And he was causing Christian pain. But he had always belonged Potter, didn't he? Even when he didn't know. Since they were eleven, it was all about Potter. It was because of Potter he became a seeker, because of Potter he defied his family and went against voldemort and saved his life, because of Potter, didn't fight to hard for the wands when Potter escaped the manor, for Potter he got disowned by his father. It was Potter all along. Which is why it was so easy to fall in this relationship with Potter. And Christian was an older version of Potter. Almost similar, just eyes were different. Christian's eyes were blue but just as bright as Potter's. Draco bites his lower lip and looks down. He can't look at Christian right now and he doesn't know when will he ever see Christian again. Will Christian want to see him? Christian places another kiss on Draco's forehead which lasts quite a few seconds, then walks past him and disappears. Draco looks at the space where Christian was just standing and takes a deep breath. He smiles. At least he won't be hanging Christian off anymore. He belongs to Potter.
"On the wall. Just came, took my wrists and pinned me down with his whole body. Stated that he liked pinning me down."
"You do?" Draco asks.
Harry tangles his hands in Draco's wet, curly locks, pulling it hard as it exposes Draco's marked neck. He vanishes his underpants and hisses as cool air touch his cock, his cock that is on top of the lace of Draco's knickers. Draco moans as Harry grinds his hard cock at an awfully slow pace on Draco's buldge. The lace of the black silk, soft, smooth under Harry's cock. Harry licks the scars on Draco's chest, places small pecks, sucks the skin in, slowly working his way towards Draco's left nipple. Harry licks Draco's left nipple and Draco lets out a loud moan.
"I think I know some people who might be able to help me. Your name wouldn't come in the topic. You just keep me updated on what to do next. I'll do the tasks." Belle answers confidentiality.
"Then you better leave Kingsley. As whoever I date is my private matter and has got nothing to do with you. You have no right to barge in and demand answers on my life. I can date whoever I want, whenever I want."
I'm telling Remus
"Why did you stop me, by the way?" Draco asks and Harry grinned.
With a flick of his wand, the cat ears and tail were gone. Harry urged him to get up, wore a t-shirt and wished Draco won't ask for clothes. Him being dressed while Draco being naked gave him unbelievable amount of power rush. And he was pleased when Draco followed him naked, just wearing his collar.
"Will you marry me?" She hears Nick ask.
I haven't slept all night. The sun starts rising. I am already dreading this day. I pray the time stops forever. I finally get myself up and get ready for a horrible day. Draco hasn't been able to find specific kids Greyback is eyeing on. Apparently he likes to be spontaneous. I walk down to the common room to see Luna sitting incredibly glum. I feel the same. I sit besides her and keep my head on her shoulder. She takes her hand and hold me.
"The way she is though, she definitely should've been in Slytherin." Harry said.
"Very good. I'll tell you, this is only for a week. Then if we both want to continue we will, but not without talking about it. And if any one of us don't want to do this after a week then we don't do it at all. Do you accept the terms?"
'Pansy Parkinson'
"Are you absolutely sure you want me to do this spell on you, Draco?" Potter asks once again.
As soon as I reach my dorm, I hide my diary behind my potions book, pretending to read my potions essay I check my diary.
"Oh Merlin. Why can't she just back off!"
"And what did you say? Oh, my husband is so insensitive, doesn't believe in anniversaries. Always late, you know and always keeps me upset."
"What happened to me, happened. I couldn't stop it and I can't help it. Not now at least. And I'd rather not think about it now."
"You're adorable when you've just woken up." Potter mumbles sleepily.
"That's-" I can't say anything.Â  I don't have words to say anything.
Draco's POV
"Deal." Draco beams at him.
Draco looks at Potter with mischief gleaming in his eyes. He smirks, shakes his head in a no and walks away with extra sway in his hips. He hears a few laughters and Potter's frustrated groan.
"We loved having you both as well." Harry said. "Astoria in Hogwarts is not the only thing worrying you, is it?"
Harry doesn't reply. He doesn't want to lie to Draco and his silence answers Draco's question.
"Enough with your purist bullshit Narcissa." I yell back. "Family loves you and protects you. If you were my mother you wouldn't have let your pathetic husband abuse me. You wouldn't have let him force me to be a death-eater. You tainted me. If I knew Aunt Romie existed, I would have left you shitty people way before. At least I would have someone who loved me and kept me safe. You and your husband are a pathetic excuse for family and parents. Leave my house right now."
Forced masturbation
Its a lie. Draco knows he's ugly. Draco also knows that Christian believes what he said, maybe because he has never seen Draco's real self. He's never seen the scars. The truth. Draco's glamour has always been on whenever he's been with Christian.
Darkness. It's all dark between these walls that surround him. Once expensive and prestigious robes that surrounded his pale body are now rags he has been wearing since so many days. How many days? Two? Ten? A hundred? There's no way to know. There's never a way to know in azkaban or the holding cells. It has to have been a while though. His white blonde hair which he loved are now all greasy and longer than they were. They lost their straightness and now show the curl they originally had. And they reach his shoulders. That can also be the fact that he hasn't got time to cut them this past year. All of this for what? What does it matter now? He should just give up. Afterall his mother is dead. Everything he went through, everything he did to keep her alive. Gone. Dead. She will never come back. She will never call him 'Mon Dragon' while she strokes her slim pale hand through his hair. She will never sneak in his room with a plate full of lemon cheesecake filled with dark chocolate fudge to binge on while he rants about all the gossip from Hogwarts. She will never be back to give him a hug and sing him lullabies to sleep as she has been doing it since past eighteen years. She will never be back to give him romantic advises about the boys he likes. She'll just never be back with her kind eyes, gentle laugh and elegant aura. She'll just never be back, his mother. She's gone.
Can't speak about it now. No one can know.
"Good kitten." Potter says and scratches his ears tenderly, Draco naturally leans to the touch. "But you don't look like a kitten much."
Draco had a good morning. It had been a few days since he had started to belond to Potter and Potter made sure everybody remembered that fact, mostly Draco. Daily morning and night blowjobs that he made Draco give him was a proof for that and Draco pounced at that chance like a puppy for food. Draco had just one orgasm since then and that was when Potter was sucking him off. He had no experience but he made up with enthusiasm. Also, someone focusing on giving Draco pleasure and not just taking for him was just as good as it could get. Draco was happy. Still, a few things nagged in his mind. He still hasn't shown Potter his actual body. They hadn't shagged yet. Potter had fingered him but that's that. No one would wait this long to shag Draco. 'I want to take it slow. Go on a date at least before I shag you silly.' Potter had said. There were still two days left for the weekend for when they could finally leave the castle and Potter was excited for the date. Draco didn't know how the date would be but it wasn't his place to worry. He just had to show up. Potter was incharge.
"I could've done better. I could've gone to Potter."
"I'd like that." Theo smiled.
He's trying so hard to try and get normal. He doesn't feel it. In the back of his head, he knows his mother would be upset. But he just can't help feel dead. He feels nothing but numbness. He feels nothing but pain. It's been one month and thirteen days. He found out. Yes, his another birthday wasted. Does it even matter? His mother won't be here to celebrate. He hears the elf disappear. He takes his expensive shampoo and massages his scalp and washes it off. Mimi comes back and pours him a glass. He doesn't know how long he lays there drinking glass after glass.
Everyone stared at their common room a little too long. All four walls were of the four colours of the houses. The wall with the fireplace red, walls on the sides, blue and yellow. Wall towards the window, green. Outside the window was the beautiful view of the black lake. Comfortable black armchairs, tables, chairs and couch decorated the room. Draco went to look at the board with room numbers and dormmates names.
"Aren't they always? I won't be Harry Potter if there aren't nightmares."
I get up and everyone does. I put my hand forward and Belle takes it. Pansy takes out her wand and speaks.
That's when the floo to the US connects.
Blaise glared her for a second then took a drop of veritaserum. He crawled towards Belle. Belle could feel the butterflies in her stomach turn into a whole zoo. Blaise turned and looked at Draco, silently asking for permission. Draco nodded. Blaise looked at Belle again and slowly they reduced the distance between their lips. The kiss was slow and passionate. Blaise's tongue tried to enter her mouth and she happily gave access. After a few seconds of intense kissing, Blaise pulled back. Belle couldn't look at him and kept looking down at her lap. Her body burning with fire inside. Blaise gave another small peck and went back to his seat, smiling. Blaise spun the bottle amd it landed on Hermione.
"Professor, what if they try to hurt Teddy?" Draco asked really worried.
"Alright." He replies. "That will be for both of us. If any one of us want to stop what's happening then that's the word we'll say. Now what about name calling?"
"You can say no, Malfoy. Why do you think you can't?"
"How did it go?"
Sucker for pain- heathens
Oh fuck. Here we go again. Whatever you do just don't tell me.
"Who?" Marina asked.
Well, I said talk to her not mumble something and then yell at her. Not my fault you can't function like a normal human being
"Alright."
"You do know what parsletongue is, right? It's not just a language to talk to snakes but to command them. Parsletongue means being obeyed by snakes. They will always obey you." Draco explains.
"Wait!" Parkinson screamed when Nott said that he'll show me a room. "We have to show Bee her room first. We've worked hard on it. Specially Blaise."
"Scorp, you're my best friend, which is why I tell you. You're a fucking idiot and I have no idea how you ended up in Slytherin." Albus said.
And so Draco does. He takes a deep breath and gets on all four then puts his head under the soapy water. It doesn't take much effort to find Harry's cock and Harry moans as he feels Draco's mouth on it. After bobbing his head like ten times, Draco comes up for air and coughs.
"Oh this will be difficult. Well, I'm pansexual so hook-up is difficult. But if I have to select, hook-up will Ginny, marry, I guess Neville, can I not kill anyone please?" Luna said in her polite and dreamy voice.
"Belle! Belle!" I scream around in the castle. I run outside to see. Fuck! She's on the floor. She's bleeding. "Help! Somebody help!" I call out. A Gryffindor comes to see what happened. "Hospital wing. Take her to the hospital wing. Please!" He looks at me shocked but calls another Gryffindor and they take her to the hospital wing. Will she be alright? This is all my fault. I shouldn't have left her. I should've made her go during the evacuation.
"Sandwich is your safeword?" Harry raises his eyebrows.
I look at her with my jaw slightlyÂ  dropped. I immediately get my posture back. Live in Hogwarts with Teddy? That would be amazing.
"You know, that, you know, I feel, I feel the same about you." His pet gave a shy smile and Harry grinned.
"Tell me McLadem-"
"I'll get the water warm?"
"It's called decryphilia. Kink of being aroused watching someone cry." Draco mumbles sleepily.
"Sure. I'll ask her to join me after breakfast. Draco wants to go to this cafe he saw today so we'll be having breakfast there. Be ready by 7." Harry replied then started towards his room.
"I'm not. I'm seconds away from mental breakdown. I just want to run away to an island where I'm not a pureblood but I'm rich and I have Gin on my side. I'm a lucky girl. I never in my wildest dreams thought I'd end up with a Gryffindor. A Weasley no less." She chuckles.
"I can't hear you." He says smirking.
Draco is sleeping out on the couch in the gardens when Harry arrives. He's curled up in a ball inside a pink blanket with only his eyes and a bit of his nose peaking out. His eyes are closed. His curly blond hair sticking out everywhere. This will never get old, watching Draco's curly white blond hair. It's not completely curly. More like half wavy half curly. It's a good addition to Draco's pointy and sharp cut edges, the curls. Harry watches that one particular strand of hair that covers Draco's closed eyes. He sighs and wonders for the hundredth time if Draco ever goes inside the manor. Harry slowly raises his hand tucks that strand behind Draco's ears and hears Draco mummur something like Daly. Harry kneels in front of him, watching him. Draco's expressions so open, so free. This is the first time in two months he's seen any emotions this free on Draco. Even his smiles with Teddy have limits.
"What do you mean?" Pansy narrows her eyes.
Once Theo was done, Pansy stood.
Draco watches as Teddy's hair turn platinum blond just like his and he smiles. He doesn't look up when Potter and his Aunt leave. He smiles at Teddy.
"Sorry, the house is a mess. Have a seat please. I'll make the coffee." Harry says.
Hws he?
"She did. Thrice this week. Potter came along Twice with her."
"Do you care about the stupid gossip I do about people you don't even know?" Pansy asks.
"You're allowed to have this Draco. You're allowed to feel loved. To feel care for. There are different ways of showing it. You have always been subtle while Harry has always been bold about it. That's the only difference. He'll have to learn to navigate your subtlety while you'll have to learn to accept the boldness of it. You've been through so much, Draco. Some people will always hate you. Just like some people will always hate him. What matters is what you both feel for each other."
SHE GAVE IT TO ME!
Harry laughs.
"You don't get to say that with this rat nest on your head." Draco smirks.
"SHUT UP!" Belle yelled so loud and angry that Draco actually shut up. She turned to Harry who was almost on the verge of crying. "Jesus Christ Potter! Are you this daft? How you survived so many years is a fucking wonder. Take him to Slughorn. He might have an antidote." She yelled at Potter.
"You'll stay?" Draco asks, his voice cracking.
Its been three hours since Potter has left. Draco is worried and the fact that all Gryffindors, Slytherins and one Ravenclaw are in his room does not help to calm his nerves down. He smokes another cigarette, standing at the window. Dinner has past and Potter still isn't back. Draco knows that Potter is going to do something stupid, something that will put him in trouble, like always. He wishes Granger and Weasley would've gone with him. Just as he was about to light another cigarette, he heard his voice.
"Draco?" Charlie smiles.
"We are Slytherins yes. Our parent's are at the wrong side, also yes. But we don't want to be with them. Draco trusts you so we will trust you too. We need your help." Theo talks.
"When will you call me Harry?" Harry asks.
In order to verify new evidence of your innocence, a trial will be held on Wednesday, 11 am at the ministry courtroom. We suggest you hire a lawyer and have him submit all the proves and witnesses. This trial will sort out whether you are to be freed of all charges or sent in Azkaban. Kindly reach on time.
"No he isn't." Draco stays stubborn.
"No. Will try muggle torture tomorrow." Harry replied.
"Exactly. I was equally in danger with you as I was there. I had nowhere to go. You would've tortured me equally. Now Potter and I are dating. What about it?" Draco said.
"Draco, I need to tell you some things that I think Teddy shouldn't hear so give me a second." Harry put Teddy in his crib then cast a silencing charm. "Draco, I would absolutely love to see you wearing panties and then fuck you after removing them from my mouth. We are so buying you panties and girly tops today from muggle London once we're done school shopping. You're wearing them on our first date." Harry said grinning then kissed Draco deep.
Draco stood and faced him, giving him a tentative smile. Time to face the music.
"You tell me? You're the one with your tongue down his throat." Scorpius yells back.
"Oh Draco dear, you're a natural with children. I'm sure you'll be able to raise a child well. You're much better than Harry or anyone of them had been." Andromeda said. I couldn't help but feel proud.
He turns Draco around so he's laying on his stomach, his knickers still on his ankles. Harry showers his back with many tiny kisses and then his arse. He spreds Draco's arse cheeks apart and gives it a slow swipe. He feels a shudder pass through Draco. He performs a wandless cleaning charm in Draco that makes Draco shudder more. He kisses the pink hole and laps at it aggressively. Draco begs and begs Harry to let him cum, which Harry happily avoids. He plunges his tongue in and out of Draco's hole, sucking and fucking Draco with his tongue. After thoroughly rimming Draco, and stopping once in between because Draco was seconds away from orgasm, Harry, with a wandless accio catches the tube of lube. He uncaps it, pours generous amount of it on his fingers and pushes one finger in him knuckle deep. From other hand, he removed Draco's knickers, made Draco open his mouth and stuffed the knickers in his mouth, effectively gagging Draco and stopping his begging. He placed a few kisses on Draco's shoulders and back, and then a few bite marks while inserting another finger, scissoring and spreading him open. Then he inserted the third finger, pushing it in and out in an excruciating slow pace. Pace too slow for Draco to get any relief.
Shut up Sirius. How is he?
"Can I?" I ask. Aunt Romie nods.
I go to him and pick him up.Â  He catches my shirt with his tiny hands and looks at me. I smile at him and he gives me a nice smile.
Impossibly, Potter's face got even more strict and boy, Draco did not want to be on the receiving end of it.
Malfoy fell asleep on Harry's bed last night after all the thorough teasing and Harry, too exhausted after two wanks, [fucking Malfoy who didn't even give him a chance to cool down] sighed and resigned himself to sleep on Malfoy's bed. The moment his head hit on the silk pillows and sheets, he groaned. Two things, this bed is way to comfortable than his, it smells like Malfoy. It smells like that citrus flowery thing that suddenly takes him back to sixth year when they were making amortentia. Fuck. That was Malfoy's conditioner. How come no one noticed that he used floral products? How come Harry noticed? But that's not all. He even smells vanilla which he knows Malfoy smells like. His expensive bath products and having Malfoy in his arms for those few seconds are proof enough. This is going to be a long night. Harry inhales all fragrance Malfoy and closes his eyes.
"You're a fucking gryffindor." Pansy mumbles in between kisses.
"They're here, my boy." Mrs Parkinson tells Draco.
"More. Please. Master." Draco begged.
"Not my place to say. Who told you?"
"I knew it." Says Me Olivander. "This wand has been waiting for it's master since four decades now, Draco. It's a very special wand made by very special wood. The wood is blue mahoe. It's not easily available in Britain. Muggles don't think much of it but wands are not easily made by this tree. They only give wood enough for one wand. Only ones with the light affinities with a talent for healing can get this wand. This wand is for them who love learning and have curious personalities. Ones who are cunning. And the core, just like your last wand is unicorn tail hair. This wand will only be loyal to you. Even after death. Take care of this one. Its 9 and a half inches, smooth and flexible."
"There is no way you will leave Narcissa. If you remember, your sister stays alive as long as you stay here. But you anger me any more and it's the wolf cub that suffers. Only your blood traitor sister as a part in this contract that stays protected. And with them being in France, it won't be much difficult for me to finish that filthy little dog." Lucius laughs. "Tell me, Narcissa. Do you plan to make that wolf child suffer?"
Millicent smiles as Cormac can feel his heart break.
"Elf magic. All I needed to get the death-eaters in Hogwarts was a house elf. I could've just summoned any house elf and have them fix the vanishing cabinet and it would've been done in a day. They all were ignorant about how powerful elf magic is. I still tried to delay for almost an entire year in the preface of fixing that cabinet so that I could find a way to save my mother and be out of there."
Draco groans.
"And now I'd like to call upon the last witness. Mr Harry Potter." Blackburn announced loudly.
"The Prophet." He replies.
That they did. That night, after the park when Harry came back to his dorm, Ron, Hermione and Ginny forced their views on him. Made him feel guilty about wanting to be with Draco. Blamed on Harry for Fred's death, blamed Draco as well. Blamed Hermione having to obliviate her parents for a war Harry was apparantly the cause of. And Harry, the boy with no self worth, drowned in guilt, finally relented. And broke Draco's heart as well as his own. It took him opening up to Andromeda to understand the way he had continuously been manupilated. By Dumbledore, by Snape, by Voldemort, by his best friends.
"A while. Give her a chance, Lizzie."
"He told me. He told me about how much that man loves him and is heartbroken but will leave Draco be because Draco's happiness matters him the most and you are Draco's happiness." Hermione answered.
"Then let's leave." Draco says and pulls McLaggen up.
"Do you have a condom?" The woman asks as she unzips Cormac's pants.
Draco had a drink and suddenly dropped his glass on the floor. Everyone looked at him. He ignored everyone and went to Milicent Bulstrode. He took her by her hair and kissed her. Everyone looked at him in shock. Harry almost had tears in his eyes. Belle pulled him away.
"You know what night he dreamed about, don't you?" Harry asks Astoria.
Scorpius winks at the fourth year Hufflepuff who blushes and smiles back. There it is, that damned smug smirk. Rose can feel the anger rise in her spine as Scorpius motions the girl that she's pretty and she giggles, that bint. And she blows a kiss! That's it! Rose grips the tome she was holding tight and smacks it on Scorpius's shoulder and arm, repeatedly.
The loud music is back on much to Harry's dismay, blaring loudly with electric guitar and screaming voices. He enters the room to see Draco dressing up for the Christmas dinner. He gasps. Draco is almost touching the mirror, trying to perfect his eye liner but that isn't what surprises Harry. Draco is wearing one of Dudley's hand me down t-shirts that Harry used to wear. The dark sky Blue t-shirt is given a stitch in a way that it holds Draco perfectly, exposing his shoulders but sticking on his arms, like a perfect off shoulder top. It's still several sizes too big, especially for Draco who is much skinnier than Harry, or skinnier than Harry used to be. It hangs on him like a dress, which is he has decorated with a slim waist belt full of small diamonds and tucked it loosely under those damned leather pants. But what surprises Harry more is that the sleeves of that t-shirt finishes off at Draco's elbows, showing Draco's forearms. Harry doesn't remember when has he seen Draco dressed up with anything that reveals his forearms when he goes out. Harry smiles. Draco is dancing around, singing the song playing and applying glitter, no wait, highlighter on his cheeks, giving it a shimmering rosy shade. Harry shakes his head amused and walks towards the wardrobe to get his own clothes ready
He can see Draco's neck and cheek fill with colour as he addresses him as pet. But he is also biting his lip and looks so unsure of something.
"What do you mean?" Draco narrows his eyes.
"Draco, we all have been through shit. I know what you've been through. I was there for half of it. There's nothing wrong with you. You just have an eating disorder. Its very unhealthy. I know you don't want to admit it but if you care even a little bit about me or your son or any of us, you'll accept that you have a starving problem. And you'll get help for it. That's all I have to say." I say and run for my room.
"And I repeat. No you're not." She days again and I look at her. She sighs. "A tattoo doesn't make you a death-eater. You're too good to be like them. Why are you with them?"
By the time he was done, we were in sobs.
Cormac hands a parchment over to Darien.
"As much as I've heard, Draco, I don't think you are to blame. You and I, it's not us you know. It's them. It's Ginny and Darien who left us for someone else. Not us. Don't blame yourself."
"You named her after me?" Belle asked.
Harry did not know that.
"Sonmiuprohibe" is a spell i made of Sonmiune and Prohibere which is dream and stop in latin.
Hera cuts the call.
Draco looked at him with his eyes wide and concern.
"I didn't like the stunt you just pulled, Draco. Not. One. Bit." Harry growls.
"Just, please make it quick. Don't make him suffer much. He's still my father."  Nott says, places the glass on the table and walks out of the door, not giving a chance to respond.
"Who are you?" Harry hears a heavy french accent ask in french.
Draco kisses his chest and closes his eyes. Within seconds, he's asleep again.
"Oh you're dead!" Cormac grins. Millicent laughs as she runs and Cormac chases her.
"Blaise is much darker than Potter. Potter is bronze golden. Blaise is brown. Like proper brown. He grew up to be even more hotter."
Draco looks down at Harry's chest. "Ruin it." He said it almost non verbally.
"I'd like to not have any more permanent scars. I don't mind if the marks last a few days. I just don't want anything permanent. And no needles or knife. That's it I guess." He says, not looking at Harry.
Once we reach to the great hall, there's an another table added. That table had varieties of food on it while all other tables students usually sat on, had bowls kept. We walked to our table and sat. I looked at the bowl and it had some kind of gravy in it. It looked amd smelled disgusting. I glanced upon the staff table and saw Draco sitting. He stared at his food. Sadness could clearly be seen in his eyes. I wish I could go and hug him.
He turned around to see his mother in arms of a man who looks like an extremely older version of Potter. She breaks through his arms and runs towards him. And she hugs him. Draco hugs back, holding her tight. And thats all he does. Just holds her as she breathes him in, holding him. She peppers Draco's face and the top of his head with tiny kisses and holds him tight.
"Malfoy. I'm straight. I find every cock ugly. Even my own."
"He treats me the way no one ever has. He's brilliant, Iris. It's been almost a year and I've never been happier. I've never been happy, period, but with Harry, I am. And he's a damn awesome on bed."
"Well, yes. Sure. I am here however to talk about those four people. You have caused some serious harm to them, Mr Potter. We cannot let that slide."
"Let me be the one who ends his life." Draco said.
"I can't." Malfoy's voice is barely a whisper.
Robards didn't reply immediately, just as Harry expected. Now that wasn't going to work, was it?
Yeah. She is the best.
"Of course, you are." Ginny laughs.
"It is." Astoria says quietly. "We could never depend on teachers who wasn't Snape. And Snape gave us extra preference because someone had to. We always get worse punishments from the teachers than other houses get and we get more points taken for same mistakes. I can give you so many personal examples."
"Oh Merlin!" Pansy cursed.
"He did." Neville replies.
Yay! Kinky sex!
"To drill the table manners in my head, I was not allowed food for whenever I forgot the table etiquettes. Oh I spent so many days starving." Draco said.
"You are just figuring this out, aren't you?" Christian chuckled.
"Our apologies Mr Potter. It's just, we have never seen Draco without Christian here so we were mistaken. It's nice to meet you." Arnold says.
I can't believe that bastard. Oh god I wish I could use crucio on him! I'm glad you're okay Bee. You're our strong girl.
I am staying at the Weasleys. I was called down because some people were there to meet me. I go down to the kitchen and I'm shocked to see Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini and Theodore Nott. They have come along with Luna.
The party was raging and so many people were drunk except Ginny. Ginny hated drinking. After being possessed by Voldemort, she didn't like the feeling of not having control over her body. So no one forced her to drink. It was past curfew so the music had turned from party music to romantic songs. Ginny and Theo danced alongside Pansy, Luna and Ron, Hermione and Neville and Hannah. Blaise danced with Belle.
I don't want to be here. I don't want to be in a Hogwarts that has turned to be like this. I locked myself in the dorm and sat on my bed. I rolled up my sleeve to reveal the dark mark. I hate it. I hate myself. I hate that I was forced to do so many dreadful things that I didn't want to do. I wish there was a way I could escape. My thoughts shift to Harry. What is he doing? Will he be fine? I wished with all my heart that Harry succeeded in defeating this asshole.
The fight has started. All the death-eaters have managed to invade Hogwarts. We are all dueling with them. I fight those fucking death-eaters as much as I can. Lucky I haven't really shown anyone how good I am in defence.
Harry almost laughed at her reaction. After all they've been through, Hermione never swears. Even after her viciousness, she still was a goody two shoes in so many ways. Her eyes widened and Harry can swear he saw her bushy hair stand up like a cat's which briefly reminded her of that polyjuice accident back in second year. With some effort he managed to supress his laughter after he remembered that specific incident.
"How long has it been since you've cum?" Harry asks.
They look at each other for a few seconds and then laugh again.
"We need to talk." Harry says.
"Hey. I love my Gran too much. I can't say no to her." Neville argues.
"Please Potter. Don't." Malfoy says.
Potter, the bastard, doesn't even raise from his seat and then looks at Draco with a soft smile tugged at his lips.
"That was amazing, my love." Harry says after he caught his breath. " Are you okay?"
I cast a cleaning charm for her and she smiles at me. She gets up and looks over the mirror again. My heart drops. I know what she's about to do. She gives herself one bruise on her neck and one above her chest. She gives me a hug and a kiss on my cheek then leaves. It hurts me seeing her like this. I go to my dorm. I meet Pansy and others. We behave normal when I meet them. I dress up, fix myself and go to the death-eaters meeting. I write in the diary about the meeting before I leave.
Hand jobs
"What?" I freeze listening to this.
"It's okay. Keep going. The tears are a part of this." Draco convinces Potter.
Potter tugs at the leash and Draco realizes that he drifted off to some other world, he follows. He knows with that powerful magic of his, Potter could've just conjured a long mirror but he chose to walk Draco all the way to a walk-in wardrobe that connects to his bedroom. Double doors! This is going to be good. He loves wardrobes. Potter opens the double doors to a huge wardrobe filled with vanities, chest drawers, rotating clothes hanging place like the one Hannah Montana had in the first season. Draco doesn't know where that memory came from but he doesn't ponder on it long. That place is a dream and a nightmare at same time. Dream because it's exactly how a walk-in wardrobe should be but nightmare because its empty. There's rarely few clothes hanging there. That's it. Draco notes it mentally that he needs to fill this wardrobe with clothes, accesories, shoes, everything that Potter will like and definitely needs.
Finally it was the weekend. The eight years had decided to throw a party. A lot had happened over that time. Ginny and Theo were dating. Blaise and Belle had become closer. They walked hand in hand and shagged but they hadn't kissed yet.
"Cormac. You can call me Cormac."
"Your last article was a flop."
"Well, I can't let this go. You know that right?"Â  McGonagall asked and Belle nodded. "Detention on Monday after class."
"I woke up to Theo lecturing Potter to leave me alone, no matter how he feels about me."
"I don't know. I don't know many things now."
Love it pads! Congratulations!
"I need you to know this. I know you're getting married. Like, right now. And you're a pussy and weirdly obsessed with plants and you make me do stuff like scream on terraces and buy bra for your wife but every lunch we had together, I look forward to it. I, I'm in love with you. I know you're marrying someone your gran chose and you're too much of a pussy to stand up to her hippocratic arse and I know it's a lost cause and I'm making a joke of myself here. But it's the truth. I love you." Pansy rambles on and finally expresses how she feels.
"Sort out? I'm not gonna leave Teddy to some babysitter for a year if that's what she's gonna say." I tell Belle.
Draco Malfoy has always been powerless. He was powerless under his father's boot. He was powerless under Voldemort's rule. He was powerless when they lost the war. He was powerless when the ministry trials ruled him out for being forced when Harry Potter spoke on behalf of him. He is powerless now that he is alone in a big manor with no parents to look after him, not that they did look after him before. Draco Malfoy has always been powerless.
Jazz-kaban
"I won't do it. To Teddy. What Aunt Andromeda did to me."
Chastity
"Did you ask his family? Maybe he's on a vacation." Narcissa suggests.
"And what, Mr Potter, makes you think I'll dance for you?" Draco blushes.
"There are two days missing in my life, Harry. Two days that I don't remember anything about. Even Ted had the same two days missing. I knew we were obliviated and we wracked our brains over it a lot. Finally gave up a couple of years later. These are the two days missing, Harry. Oh, my Cissy. What didn't she go through to keep me safe. And I, I abandoned my sister. I was so quick to believe that she turned from us. I don't deserve it, Harry. I don't deserve her love and security." Andromeda started to sob again.
I'm sure Bellatrix would love to bang him.
"You're a baby for me Dracooo." She coos.
"Why didn't you stop that guy when he was about to open his pants?" Harry asked another question.
"Waste. Apparantly when mixed with cocopeat and ground rumbus root it loose the expectancy of underwater breathing by 5 percent. Which is weird because ground rumble roots are used to grow the expectancy of underwater plants while cocopeat is an excellent muggle mixture for the fertilization of- You don't care, do you?" Neville asks.
"15th September." Darien replies.
"Oh for Merlin sake, Millicent, what are you searching for?" Pansy asks.
Fuck you guys
Harry walked past her and opened the door to the room Draco was in. There he was. His Draco, laying pale on the bed, looking lifeless. He looked paler than usual. What shocked Harry was the scars. So many of them, barely leaving any space for the skin to show. All over his shoulders, his chest, his stomach. Harry was pretty sure that there were scars on his back and lower body as well. What horrified Harry the most were huge criss cross scars that go from his hips, stomach to his neck which Harry knows are the scars from the time he almost killed Draco in the girls lavatory. Harry curses himself. Hates that he's one of the person to add the scars on Draco. His Draco.
After dinner they reached home. Pansy saw all the stuff, smiled at Draco and kissed his cheek.
"Well, you better keep that promise." Potter says finally. "Because if you don't then it won't be pretty. I'm letting this one slide."
"No promises Dad." James said and hugged Draco.
"What is Mimi can do for Master Draco?" Mimi asks.
"So, did you have the information the aurors wanted?"
"Seven NEWTS and an entrance in Auror Training!" Flitwick said.
"Your obsession and stalking knows no bounds." Draco sighs.
"Wow. Dumbledore. I never would've thought." Marina blinks.
"I already have a safeword. Sandwich."
"And now I'm playing with you, pet. Remember, you can say your safeword and I'll stop. No questions asked and I won't be angry or disappointed either. Do you want to say the safeword?"
He takes them to the second floor and opens the door to the right. He opens the door and levitates her trunks in the room. The room is bright white and beige. He places the trunks in a corner and tells them where they can find the bathroom and supplies. He tells them to take their time and walks out of the room. He goes in the kitchen and sits on a chair at the kitchen table while Draco places the pastries and cupcakes on trays. He places the tray on the table and goes to bring out the tiny spoons Harry has never seen before.
They take their seat at the table and Draco pours everyone some tea. Harry can't help but think it looks like Draco is the housewife. He keeps the thought to himself. He knows Draco will hex him if he says anything out loud alone, let alone around company.
"What happened, after we left the court?" Harry asks.
"How is she?" Darien asked over the floo call.
"Neville! Neville!" Pansy yells just as Neville and Hannah start walking towards the alter. Wizarding weddings are this way. The marrying couple walk the alter together.
Hah! Bottom. Please use silencing charms.
"I know. But that's not the point. Its not my secret to tell. But if I ever have to, I will tell you both. I'm going to my dorm. I'll see you guys later." Harry says and without waiting for a response, turns his heels and walks towards the dorm.
Third person pov
- Bee
"Yes, Sir. Can you please look at these? There are business plans. Everything is set, I have the land, you keep meeting investers and rich people so, I thought maybe you could help." Cormac smiled hopefully.
Harry longs for him. He's been longing for him. He knows how it feels to have Draco in his arms. He knows how those lips taste. He knows how Draco smells, the fragrance of vanilla and apples. And watching Draco, it takes him back to that time.
"I know. Its called depression and eating disorder. Dray. You're like a brother to me. I need you to eat. That way you'll be healthy to protect yourself. I'm just asking to have good breakfast. Please?"
"I have a list. Don't worry about it. Two weeks from now, I'll go after a person who I know is a serial rapist. He picks out blackmail material and forces them with sex. Not a pedophile so no worries there." Harry confirms.
"When?" Healer asked.
Nott scoffs. "Please Lavie. There's no way these righteous golden people with sit with us mere mortals, lowly slytherins. They never could accept us when they didn't even know us. Prejudice and all. And they definitely won't now."
"I'm taking him back to the castle." Harry announces. "I'll meet you guys later."
Draco walked slowly along the lines in the park Harry had asked him to come along for. Narcissa was out in Paris this week, school trip. Darien no longer had time for Draco like he did once. Nan was with Ralph, it wasn't Saturday so they had made plans. Pansy was busy with Smith out of all people. So Draco accepted. They walked towards the lake and Draco opened the bag of breads to feed the ducks.
"Yeah. You can get me only in such places where no one would see. You leave first, I'll follow an hour later. Like a thief." Millicent taunts.
"Fuck off, Ronald. Don't you dare say that about my son. And free life? Look at me! I'm miserable because of you both. I could've been living a happy life as I want with Draco but you ruined it for me! You wrecked my already shitty life. He and Teddy were the only thing good in my life, something to look forward to. You ruined it."
"Ginny, if people should respect you for you decision to have a career then you should respect women to want to be a homemaker. Because just like you chose to have a career, she chose to be a homemaker. There's nothing wrong in wanting to be a housewife." Draco said.
Harry smirked. They could believe all they want but the Black Library and Malfoy Library had way too many books on magic none of these people knew about. Obviously it would give the whole world a fit if they found out that their savior is using dark magic. No wonder that magic is banned. It's not banned because it's dark, it's banned because it's powerful and these people are too stupid to not understand it's power. Or too stupid to not want to understand it's power. And Harry, was not the most powerful wizard of their age for nothing. He would have to tone down but. This can get real ugly real fast.
"I'm sorry, Harry." Draco cries as he turns and apparates listening to Harry beg him not to go.
"This was Draco's diary. These diaries are how we communicated without getting caught. Theo had charmed them." Pansy explained.
"Harry please. I'm sorry. I was just playing. Ngh." Draco moans.
Draco Malfoy looked beautiful to Harry.
Draco hates that name. He laughed so much when he read that's what they've named the killer. Potter wasn't amused. Why couldn't they name him something interesting like they did with Jack the ripper or the zodiac? Clearly the wizards don't have much of an imagination like the muggles.
"How is he?" Hermione asks.
Draco rolls his eyes. He has half a mind to say something sarcastic but sarcasm doesn't work on veritaserum. And he has to pretend that it affects him. So he does what he does best. He acts.
"I literally, really have no time for this. I have a special order and client who has birthday tonight. Please leave." Harry grit his teeth.
"Students. In lights of recent events, there have been made some changes in the school curriculum. You will have to take the subject Muggle Studies. It is compulsory. For years we have been taught the wrong information. From this year we will teach the truth and reality of muggles and muggleborns."
Draco watches his aunt walk towards him with Potter. What do they want now? What can he do now? He doesn't want them. He doesn't want anyone but his mother. He doesn't have energy for this.
Draco gets back to stare at the flowers and just like before, he's completely lifeless again. And Harry hates how he can't do anything about it.
It takes a while before Draco does look up. Harry held his breath the entire time. He isn't much good at comforting people, but with Draco he always seem to find a way.
Draco still didn't look at him.
Draco's POV
"Is that why you stare at my boobs every chance you get?" Pansy asks in return and Neville blushes.
"Can I touch it?" Astoria asked.
"Potter, what the fuck? What the hell did you do to McLaggen?" Malfoy asked Harry enraged.
"Really Bulstrode? You know love potion doesn't make anyone actually fall in love with you right? It just creates an illusion. Why the fuck would you do this?" Belle yelled at her.
Draco blushes more.
The sun raises in the sky, splashing all beautiful colours around it. Pink, orange, yellow and blue. It was a warm day, filled with love. Draco opened his eyes with a yawn. He had slept through the entire night after Potter made love to him thrice. He was extremely gentle, romantic, loving. Draco smiled looking at the sun. He felt content. His hands slowly went towards the red O-ring collar snugly wrapped around hiss neck. He caresses it with his soft fingers, thrilled to be wearing it. If it was up to him, he would never remove it. It was a symbol, a symbol of love, ownership, belonging to his Master, his boyfriend, his Harry, his Potter. He closed his eyes and gave a content sigh. He could feel Potter's chest stuck at his back and Potter's arm wrapped around his chest, effectively spooning him in to a cocoon. He's never felt like this before, not being able to stop smiling. In fact he is so out of practice that his cheeks already start to hurt and he still can't stop the silly grin. He doesn't want to as well.
Its important. This can show Draco that he accepts Draco like that. With all those scars, and he will still think that Draco is the most beautiful person Harry has seen. Harry will heal his scars himself.
"Oh yeah. Draco's quite an idiot about that. He never understands when someone is flirting with him unless they come and state that they want to have sex with him." Astoria says.
"Why am I here? Is this officially sanctioned arrest? Because this isn't the holding cell." Draco says.
Sirius. Come in the dorm now.
Draco froze and stared at him.
"Well, that was intense." Neville broke the silence and Ginny huffed a laugh.
I put this in an envelope and give it to the owl that I think was of my Aunt. The owl takes the letter and flies away.
"Who?" I ask confused.
Draco sees a glimpse of Potter before the bus halts in front of him, blocking the view. Draco freezes there, not climbing the bus, but also not doing anything else, not looking for Potter. As the bus leaves, Draco watches Potter half way crossed the streets, smiling and coming towards him.
"You want what?" Harry asks.
Harry opens the door and leans his shoulder on the wall, sideways. He looks at Draco who is wearing nothing but the black knickers and is laying down on the floor with his legs on the bed. He always plays the guitar in weird positions. He turns to look at Harry as he sings.
Harry is a little afraid that Draco will think its too soon. Is it? They did live the entire Christmas break together. Isn't this the step forward? And Harry loves Draco, he wants to live with him. He looks at Draco who is looking back at Harry with his eyes soft.
"You're not the only one with gay friends. Oh, by the way. You have to come at my place on 25th and 26th."
"Come up a bit." He demands and Draco does.
Harry doesn't want to punish Draco. Draco has had two very rough days and he isn't in the frame of mind. Last time this had happened, Harry had given him firm reprimand. If Harry let's it slide this time as well, it won't set a right example. But this was bound to happen. Draco managed being a good boy and not being punished for almost a year. This has to be a world record. But Harry doesn't know if it is the right time to punish Draco, after everything he has been through. He doesn't have anyone he can talk to about it as well. With a wandless accio, he catches a galleon mid air from the hand that isn't holding Draco's wrist. He then shows it to Draco.
[Belle is a muggleborn ravenclaw. She's in her sixth year of Hogwarts and is classmate of Luna Lovegood. She is half Indian and half British/French. She is plump, brown skin, black shoulder length hair and black eyes.]
"Lucius, you're giving me a migraine. Please stop pacing like that. What is the matter?" Narcissa asks.
An owl tapped the kitchen window. There was an elegant eagle owl with a green envelope. Harry with a swish of his fingers opens the window and the owl sits on the armrest of Draco's chair. Draco looks like he knows who the owl belongs to. He pets the owl and takes the envelope of it's beak. He opens it delicately and reads.
So many questions. Harry has so many questions. There are so many things he doesn't understand. So many things he can't believe. Teddy. Draco. He has to keep them both safe. Draco he will, but with Teddy being in France, how will he? Narcissa has taken an extremely dangerous risk by sending this letter to Harry. And help, Harry will give her. He rescued Draco. He'll rescue her too. He just needs to figure out how. So he does the first thing he can think of. He calls Hermione and Ron.
"We need to find a way out of the castle. There has to be a way out." That bitch Alecto says.
"Why are they in a jail?" Draco clears his question as he points at a panda.
"Yes."
"Draco, it's shopping. We're not going to a party. It's been fifteen minutes and you're still not done with your hair." Harry gives out an exasperated sigh.
"We can't smuggle kids everyday though. Someone will get on to us. We can only do a handful a week." Luna says.
Draco swallows. He hasn't met his mother since almost two years, ever since the trials and they were exhiled to France. And Merlin knows how much he misses her. Sometimes, so much that it physically hurts. And they are going to free her tomorrow from that bastard. And it's not just his mother that will be free. It's him that will be free. It's his Aunt Andromeda and the little Teddy Lupin that will be free. So many other people will be free. Draco feels his eyes burning as the tears form. He can feel Potter's arms around him after a few seconds. And Draco, he's terrified. Terrified of so many things that can go wrong. Terrified of what the future holds when his father dies. Terrified if someone finds some proof about what Potter has done for him and for them. He'd rather have Potter here with him than have his father dead. It's selfish, he knows. But no one in this world is as important to him as his Harry.
I can't believe that Malfoy. Coward. He came from back.
He presses the cane more, watching Draco struggle to follow Harry's command to breath slowly while in pain. Harty twists the cane more and Draco jerks behind. Then taking Draco by surprise, Harry gives a sharp swat across Draco's chest, effectively hitting the left nipple. Draco lets out a scream and cries. The sounds all beautiful to Harry's ears. A couple more swats, getting both the nipples hit, Harry then picks out the clamps and places it on Draco's nipples. Draco hisses. He knows the clamps are tight and painful. He then pulls the foreskin of Draco's cock ahead and clamps it shut. Draco lets out a loud scream. Harry worries that he went a bit beyond Draco can handle but then he hears Draco beg for more and breathes. He gives a small swat on Draco's cock and Draco jerks behind. Oh god. Harry is so hard. He canes Draco's front, the chest and the lovely cock again and again. Not keeping a proper rhythm, keeping Draco on edge. The clamps still tightly shut on Draco's nipple and cock. He stops and finally drops the cane. He looks at Draco. Draco is crying loudly, barely being able to breath. So many marks, red and purple, all over Draco's chest and abdomen. On his cock as well. Draco is barely managing on his tippy toes and he looks BEAUTIFUL.
Harry is in the library with Hermione and Luna when Malfoy comes with the blond sister and Zabini. Harry was drinking water when he literally chokes on it as he sees Malfoy enter. Malfoy looks at him and smirks. Its not just Malfoy. Its Malfoy wearing a nice black leather skirt. The length extremely indecent for school and gives perfect exposure to those skinny and lean, milky white thighs and long legs. He can faintly hear Luna and Hermione laugh. His eyes are fixed at Malfoy's thigh showing out of his barely there skirt and swallows a huge lump in his throat. The library suddenly feels extremely hot. Just to torture Harry more, Malfoy fake drops his book. He turns to give Harry a full view of his arse and bends down on his waist to pick it up, giving Harry a full show of those pretty blue lace knickers. Harry takes a deep breath and gives out a heavy groan. He burries his face in his palms and yells.
"You don't say anything. You have emotional range of a teaspoon. Why is Draco talking to him?" Harry holds the water glass so tight, his knuckles turn white.
"We were supposed to act surprise, Ronald." She sighs.
"We absolutely will. Hi. I'm Ginny Weasley." Ginny smiles at them and sits besides the smaller dark haired girl.
"I would love to-"
There's a beat.
"I don't know what you're talking about Mione." Harry didn't even look at her.
The Ravenclaw raises his hand and it comes down as a hard slap on Malfoy's face. So hard that Malfoy's face whips the other side. Malfoy slowly looks up and bites his lip then speaks.
"Graveyard in Godrics hollow? That's where my parents, Sirius, Remus and Tonks are burried." Harry replied with cracked voice.
"Oh I know many things." Harry winks.
"I'll tell you. I'll tell you if you let me go." Spine bargains.
"Don't talk with your mouth full, Ronald." Hermione scolded Ron. "And he's right, Harry." She turned to him.
Servus meaning slave.
"Do you think Mr Potter is the pedophile killer?" Prosecutor asks again.
Belle's POV
ScratchingBiting
Ron, Hermione and Harry look at each other tensed.
âYou still donât get it, Riddle, do you? Possessing the wand isnât enough! Holding it, using it, doesnât make it really yours. Didnât you listen to Ollivander? The wand chooses the wizardâ¦ The Elder Wand recognized a new master before Dumbledore died, someone who never even laid a hand on it. The new master removed the wand from Dumbledore against his will, never realizing exactly what he had done, or that the worldâs most dangerous wand had given him its allegiance." Harry said. What is he talking about? âThe true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.â
Morosis: the stupidist of stupidity.
*Fetishes*
I say my goodbyes and get home. I write a letter to Harry asking when is he going for school shopping so that we both can go together. At night I finally put Teddy to sleep and go to sleep myself.
Harry shakes his head with a small quirk on his lips.
Harry smirked. He knew she was just as ruthless. It was just very difficult to see.
"I'm not a Gryffindor! The restaurant is supposed to welcome everyone!" Millie argues.
"He does."
"You know pets aren't allowed on furniture, Draco." He says.
That only made Draco laugh harder.
âBut then, thatâs the Weasley boy!â shouted Lucius, striding around the bound prisoners to face Ron. âItâs them, Potterâs friendsâDraco, look at him, isnât it Arthur Weasleyâs son, whatâs his nameâ?â Father says.
"A- Amycus." She managed to say.
"Can I cross my legs?" Draco asks.
âWait,â said Narcissa sharply. âYesâyes, she was in Madam Malkinâs with Potter! I saw her picture in the Prophet! Look, Draco, isnât it the Granger girl?â
"Pansy, Pansy that's not it, listen to me." Millie tries.
"Can you elaborate?" Blackburn asked.
What the fuck people shut up or I'll puke
"Good night, Teddy bear. I love you." Harry covers Teddy with a blanket.
"Tada!" Pansy squeaked as she removed the blindfold from Draco's eyes. She had said that she found a perfect place to celebrate Draco's birthday. It was Harry's bakery. Fuck!
"Shut up! Shut up! You wanted to hide the truth from your parents then you should've told me. We could've come to an arrangement. I would've done the acting myself. Why did you have to lie to me? You're gay! That's it! Gay or straight, that's your right. But to use someone like that and break their heart, that is not your right. And it is not right. All you fucking hippocrates think you're so higher and righteous than us Slytherins. You'll are just as bad. Worse even. I never want to see your face again!"
Draco makes a face to show Harry just how unamused he is of this pun and Harry snorts.
He smiles and lays down on his bed. This, Harry counts as victory. This will show Malfoy that Harry is serious about his consent. That he won't touch Malfoy without his permission and that Malfoy can stop him whenever he wants.
"What do you mean 'of what relevance is that'? No one can touch you without your permission, Malfoy!" Harry almost yells.
Ow Moony why'd you throw that?
Its finally five. We go to the floo and reach Aunt Romie's house. We enter her living room. Its small but cozy. Toys are laid everywhere. Pictures areÂ  hung on frames, the place is very small but lovely.
"The aurors are on it." Lucius replies.
"We need to talk." Tori barged in the library, disturbing Draco's reading. He was in a very interesting chapter.
Harry muses. Amazing thing, legilimence. Beautiful, how one can just go to someone else's memories and find out every little details that the concious mind doesn't remember. Things that get registered to the subconscious. Like these four assholes coming out if this small cottage before attacking his Draco. He puts on a smile and knocks the door. The door is opened by the shorter lady. Her eyes widen, looking at harry and she beams at him. Harry continues smiling kindly. She takes Harry's hand and shakes it over enthusiastically.
"Hello, pet."
âIâ¦ maybeâ¦ yeah.âÂ  I say giving up. I don't have a choice. They'll know I'm up to something.
"Good." Harry breaths. "We also need a word. A word that you don't say while having sex. The word to stop everything that is happening."
Draco's smile faltered. Meet the Weasleys? After so many decades of animosity between the Malfoys and the Weasleys, Draco going in there, being a death-eater, this didn't sound good any more.
"Do you have any proof, let me rephrase that. Do you have any actual proof relating me or Draco to the murders, then let me know. Till then, you're only wasting my time." Harry smiled.
[Time skip where everyone is in Hogwarts and the to sneaks in to find the diadem]
"Mr Malfoy." Blackburn says softly and places one hand on his shoulder. He offers Draco a handkerchief which Draco accepts. "What loyalty bonds?"
"Extremely dominating. Extremely hot. It's like she was meant to be a dominatrix. But she's not much into giving pain as well. She avoids it. But she loves being in charge. I think I will be getting myself one of those collars from Ginny as well, soon."
Ron held him tight. Hermione had tears in her eyes. Harry looked at Malfoy and looked at him. He felt something break in his heart that day. Shattered more than it was ever possible.
"I love you too." I hug him tighter.
"You know the rules. Come on." Potter says sternly. He can feel the whole room's eyes on him.
"How do you feel about it?"
"Is she the one from the zoo?" Draco squealed. His face was bright and looked happily at Nura like a child looks at a puppy.
"Draco, this isn't a prison." Harry explains.
"Astoria Greengrass." The girl smiles back.
Harry had made an appointment with the zoo owners the next day they were back from zoo. Draco had clearly felt bad leaving Nura at the zoo and Harry would happily give Draco what he wants. So he paid a hefty amount to get Nura for Draco.
He completes washing Harry's hair, takes a towel and leaves the bathroom leaving Harry to finish his business.
"You ruined his cock through sheer will, are you saying?" Draco asks.
Phone sex (with
But this will only lead against your case in case we won the war and Voldemort looses.
Classic.
I asked healers to take extra care of her and we all apparated to the ministry. I took them to Kingsley who was now minister of magic. We all explained them and I gave him my own account that I made sure Belle was saying the truth. He saw the proof and smiled.
Draco snaps his head up and looks at Potter, Granger, Weasley and his Aunt Andromeda. His aunt's eyes are red rimmed and puffy as if she's cried a lot.
"Hey Malfoy. How about a quick round in my dorm before the breakfast? Come on." Smith says.
I'll try to get one more owl so it'll be easier. You will have to keep both owls Bee. You okay with that?
"I have made a list of few things that will help us make a case against the ministry. But to be sure, we need you to tell us everything so that we can have proper story to give to the lawyers. I'm guessing you have one?" Granger says.
"What are her options? Brothers, you, Granger who is not feminine or Lovegood who has a very unique fashion sense?" Draco says drily.
"No. But I'll be." Harry gives a rueful smile.
"And if you want to marry someone from 'our side' or a Slytherin?"
Harry walks into the kitchen into the fragrance of delicious food and coffee. There are waffles and fruit bowls with porridge.
"Tell me." Harry says.
"Listen. I dont care of you believe me or no. All I know is that many children's lives are in danger. They are children for fucks sake. There's only 24 days left for full moon. We can't save-" I take a pause and take a deep breath. " We can't save every children." I saw softly. "I've made my peace with that fact. There will be some children we won't be able to save and they will go through that horrible fate. But we have to do something. Please." I finally beg.
The professor's eyes flicked towards Draco and the Slytherins when he sneered saying death-eaters. Oh goody! This will be fun, Draco groaned internally.
"I don't feel very good." He says coyly.
"Why did you all keep it a secret?"
"What time is the portkey?" Draco asks.
"I know." Theo kissed him back blushing like he always did.
"Feed me and I live. Give me water and I die."
"Its blue." He said.
"And what about that man you were smiling to?"
"I'd love to go out with you!" Ginny yelled in excitement and gave Theo a hug.
"What the hell is this?"
"Neville! Have you forgotten who she is?" Augusta hisses.
"Shit." Draco hears Pansy.
"Draco?" Harry enters the room.
"What is this?" Mr Weasley asks as he opens his present.
As said before, their sex life was good. Harry even spanked him with the belt two times but as it hadn't been more than a couple of weeks since Draco came back from St Mungos, Harry wanted to take it slow. Harry had let him have one orgasm every night as well. This novelty would only last for another week though. Then Harry is putting him on dry spell for at least three weeks. Draco was always on edge while he wasn't allowed orgasm. It made him more wanton, more desperate to please Harry and Harry loved that Draco would trust Harry with such power. And he loved how Draco would try to cross his legs while sitting but then remembered he wasn't allowed to do so. One of the rules that he has to keep his legs parted all times when Harry was near. Unless they were sitting on the floor, then he needed Harry's permission. Till now, Harry hadn't made him ask for that permission verbally in front of everyone. Draco might be ripped off all the pride he has but Harry respected him so one pleading look was enough for Harry to give him a nod and the permission to cross his legs. But what troubled Harry most was that Christmas holidays were near. Harry still hadn't decided if he wants to stay at Hogwarts or stay at grimauld place that he has gotten it remodelled front to back by professionals. He wanted to ask Draco to come with him. Draco was living at Nott manor since he was out of azkaban. And more than that, he wanted Draco to come to the burrow and spend time with his adoptive family. Harry sighed, his eyes felt heavy. He'd worry about it tomorrow. Now, he kissed Draco's forehead and closed his eyes, drifted to his slumber.
Neville looks at Hannah blushing.
Harry pointed his finger to the bed and with a whispered aguamenti, the fire ceased. He looked at Draco sternly and felt small satisfaction to see Draco take a precautionary step back. He walked towards Draco and as he kept stepping closer, Draco kept stepping back until his lower back touched the bedside drawer and there was nowhere to go. He was panting hard, well aware that he stepped out of boundries. Harry abruptly turned him around and pinned his hands on the wall above. Draco yelped in pain as the drawer pressed against his lower abdomen and he was pinned in a very uncomfortable position.
"Ralph, will you have tea?" Hera asks.
Ron wasn't any different. His eyes equally widened if not more.
"Majority look like Potter."
After this unfortunately was DADA. Ugh I hate it. Amycus had taken it to make me be his personal rag doll. He was going to make me suffer each and every class. This time it still hurt a lot and I couldn't stop myself from crying. But it was slightly more bearable than yesterday. I guess I'll get a tolerance for pain. I can definitely add that to my plus points then.
That moment Luna walks in.
Harry doesn't know what to say. What does anyone say in such situations? What does one say when someone you don't expect turns out to be completely evil? But isn't that how the world has been? People with the kindest of faces being the ones who enjoy hurting you the most. People high in power who show how good they are become the ones who actually know no bounds to get where they want to get. Mafilda Hopkins. Just another ones of the selfish fuckers who would destroy someone else's life to make her own. Who would destroy a child's life. Many children's lives. Harry closes his eyes and kisses Draco's cheeks, his hand still firmly on that X mark on Draco's torso. He opens his eyes and locks it with Draco's. Draco's grey eyes worried. Harry can almost see the eyes of a little boy, terrified of another adult that will be hurting him, abusing him and his parents will do nothing to prevent it.
Draco clears his throat.
"I promised to get you out of the villa. I'm a man of my word and I kept my promise. You're out of there. But I can let you free. That's risky for me. I suggest you close your eyes. It will be less painful if you don't see it." Harry explains.
"How was it, rooming with the git?" Ron asks.
Draco turned and settled on his stomach, his chin on Harry's chest, looking at Harry with those sincere eyes, grey, so grey, like melted glass, or maybe mirror.
She desperately wishes that she never could've been a mother so that her son didn't have to go through so many horrors this man put him through. She desperately wishes there was some way she could've save him ever since he was born against her wishes. She desperately wishes Teddy wasn't born so he didn't have that threat for her. She desperately wishes she herself were dead.
I played with Teddy for another hour while Belle talked with Andromeda. Belle wasn't much comfortable with holding children so she played with Teddy from afar.
"You must have some idea why you told me."
"What was that?" Ron asked.
Harry saw the trembles in her hands, he could feel the fear she felt and Harry relished in every moment of it. She finally cleared her throat and spoke.
"Potter." Draco warned.
As soon as Draco sings this para, the crowd burts into loud cheers.
Draco blinked. Did he want Potter since years? Was it Potter for him all along? Well, he did go way up and above to make his life miserable. And to get his attention, he won't lie about that. He also does remember being more comfortable dating gryffindors like Woodie and McLaggen. And Christian definitely would've been a Gryffindor if he were a wizard.  Draco remembers hating Patil twins, Chang and Weaslette especially more. Huh. Looks like Draco always did have a thing for Potter.
"I asked you a question Narcissa." Lucius says.
"Did that first." Bill said.
"Draco, before he left after the battle, he asked me personally to make sure I take care of Belle. I knew Belle was getting the information from the inner circle but I didn't know who was giving it to her. She said she had made an unbreakable vow so she can't tell us until they themselves don't." Luna explained.
Outside common room they were greeted by a furious McGonagall. They all went in common room and everyone froze.
"Cormac, your boss told me you're hard working and intelligent." Darien says to Cormac after the call.
"Are you flirting?" Millicent asks.
"It won't go Harry." He sobbed. "It won't go."
"What?" Draco says, his stunned expressions not changing.
"You haven't seen movies? Why won't you see movies? You lived with muggles." Zabini asked.
"I don't plan to." Harry looks at Oliver in the eyes. "I love him and he's mine. I'll always take care of him. I love him."
"He said no, Potter. This is huge. We are so grateful for it to you." Zabini says.
"I ran into Woodie in Neptune. Iris, Keith, Arnold, Zee, Rosemary and Saif, none of them knew. I didn't either. So Woodie told us."
Merlin tits Moony you're awesome!
If. She said if and not when. If Harry knows anything about these Slytherins, then it is that they never say anything they don't want to. There is no mistake that she meant if and not when. So there is fifty percent chance that Draco will not tell him. But little grass is right. It is Draco's story and it is his right to let Harry know when he wants to. If. Not when. If he wants to.
"That is true. Not all are open minded like you." Bulstrode smirks and takes a drag of her cigarette.
For a moment, Pansy stares at his smooth pink lips. Smoother than she's seen men have. Lips so smooth, they can rival Draco's. Pansy doesn't know why she thought that and cringed internally. She drifted her attention back at Smith's lips and for a moment imagined kissing them. But this was her taking slow for once. So she took a deep breath, kissed his cheek and apparated to spend the night doing makeovers and movie marathon with Millie.
"Wow. This is all so overwhelming." Tori gives out a slow breath.
I had never said anything to anyone and I had gone through it all alone. The most someone knew was Myrtle.
"Doesn't matter. Because he forbade my godfather Sev to tell me that he actually was on their side. You know how many times I cried with Severus? Begging him to find a way so that I don't have to take the mark. I don't have to kill Dumbledore. Dumbledore made him vow to not stop me from taking the mark or the task because it would tamper with his plans. He is just as much part in ruining my life as the dark lord."
"Sit. Good kitty. Such a good kitty." Harry says and takes out a gumny bear from the paper bag then hands it out on his palm. Draco's face brightens as he sees the gummy bear then looks at Harry eagerly. His white blond bushy tail waging fast.
"I just know about what everyone else does. That whoever it is, is targeting pedophiles. " Draco says, deliberately not giving other information he has.
"Why is your son, Harry Potter and his side kicks here?" Lucius slamed his hand on the bedpost and asked.
"My father, he didn't let me have a childhood. I wasn't allowed to do things children are supposed to do. And if I wanted to do, he would, he would beat me. As I grew up, my punishments started to get darker. I've been crucioed more times than the days I've lived. My life was, it was similar to Sirius Black. I would've run away if I had a place to go to. Running away to Blaise's or Pansy's or Theo's didn't make sense because their parents were the same. Honestly if I had someone like you had the Weasleys to go to, I would've left that house so long ago. Only if I knew about Andromeda, I would've run to her. Then maybe I wouldn't be forced to this dark mark. We would'vee been together so long ago." Draco explained.
He watches as Draco opens his mouth to retaliate but Harry gives Draco a stern look and shakes his head. He watches as Draco grumbles a "Fine" and orders a chicken hunan sizzler along with a mocha frappe. They're going to be taking away most of Draco's dinner at home, Harry is sure. Draco won't be able to finish so much of food.
"Please don't. I already read three pages worth of complaints about how she keeps snapping at Scorpius and another three pages about how she let some other boy touch her hair. And another couple of pages from your son, telling me my son is an idiot. And I agree. My son is an idiot."
"No. Please don't go home. Stay at mine for few days please." Cormac panicks.
- D, T, B, P
Theo sat in front of Ginny. Ginny smiled at him. Theo signed good morning and Ginny grinned. She signed something to him and Theo looked down embarrassed.
"Now Mr Harry Potter, do you take Mr Draco Malfoy as your lawfully wedded husband, for better and for worse, for life and for death?" Mr Weasley asked.
"Hi Neville. I'm Belle." I say.
"Come on. It was nice." Harry tries.
"Keep dreaming, Potter." Draco replies with emphasis on Potter. Harry chuckles.
The fire was settled and Bill had sent everyone back. Bill, Draco and Harry were the only one there in the castle. Harry knew that a lot of work is still pending. The curse breakers will have to come a few more times and Draco was thinking to give Bill Weasley the manor for the week
"It's gone Draco. For real." He hears Potter tell him in a steady, reassuring voice.
"That was a good threat. Real creative, Harry." Ginny laughed.
"But its your right, Malfoy. You can say no." Hermione says.
"Its from here. This portrait, it has a passage that leads to Hogsmade. It leads to a shop that is of a man who if I didn't know better I would say is Dumbledore." She explained. I gave her a confused look. "The man who owns that shop looks exactly like Dumbledore. Like he is Dumbledore's brother or something." She explained.
"Then let me buy you the next one." Harry pesters.
"Aunt Romie, I'd love to raise children. I would love to be a father. Can I ask you something?" I asked. She nodded. "Are you alright?"
Harry sat next to Draco and kissed his cheek. Belle entered the kitchen and sat in front of Harry and next to Pansy. They all waited while Tilly to serve breakfast.
We were all sitting in the great hall for breakfast. I was feeding Teddy, suddenly an owl dropped a letter on Teddy's lap. I opened to read the letter.
They're all making friends but all Harry can think about is, where is Malfoy. His questions are answered when Zabini tells everyone its finally his turn. Harry turns to look at the stage and the host, very loudly and proudly anounces Malfoy's name. Malfoy walks on the stage with his guitar. The spotlight hits him, showing clearly his sheer blue top, tight leggings, his perfect eyeliner, glossed lips and glittered cheeks. He sits on the stool in the middle of the stage, starts strumming and soon, starts singing.
Lets do it bitches!!!
"I'll be fine." Belle said, taking a deep breath. "Can we do something?" She asked as she started unbuttoning his shirt.
Both the boys groaned. Harry put down the silencing charms and yelled to give them a minute. Harry looked at Draco while Draco blushed so much. Draco's face was as red as Ron's hair. Harry bit his lip and sheepishly smiled at Draco.
"Thank you Andromeda." Narcissa replies equally formal.
"Because I was talking about McLaggen. Then I asked him about an ex and he told me the closest thing to a relationship he's ever had before you was Christian. But you're his first. His actual boyfriend. Don't doubt Draco, Harry."
Once out of the club, Harry walks them to the alley behind and pushes Draco on the wall so his front is slammed on the wall, his cheek touching the cold dry brick wall.
Bondage [public under clothing]/ leather restraints
He said no they called me pumpkin and winked.
"I don't know. Maybe my father who abandoned me as a child. Maybe that classmate who ruined my robes because I didn't have sex with him. Or maybe that boyfriend who left me so that he can marry someone his mother chose, the bastard." Millicent chokes a sob as she lights the joint and sits near the window.
[Two weeks later]
Nick walks towards Narcissa then pins her on the kitchen counter. The counter hard against her lower back as she leans behind and Nick pins her hands on the counter. He raises one hand and places it on her eyes. Narcissa dutifully closes her eyes. She feels as Nick takes her left hand and places a kiss on her fingers and then gasps as she feels a ring slip her fourth finger.
"Yes. It's time that Lucius is stopped." Hermione says with determination.
"You're the best!" Draco says and lunges forward to give Harry a kiss. Harry laughs and kisses Draco's forehead after kissing him. Then Draco goes to their room and start removing soft blankets and arrange it for Nura.
"I'm making honey-lemon drizzle tomorrow. With raspberry dark chocolate sauce. I'll save some for you." Harry asks, looking hopefully.
"What happened?" She asks.
"So, can you hear me now?" He aska.
"And that took you three hours?" Draco asked quietly.
"How is that so?"
"Pansy, she needs a couple more days to heal." Cormac tries to argue.
Draco immediately curled into him and held Harry tight, silent tears flowing from his eyes. Harry held him tight, whispering sweet praises in his ears and petting his hair. It takes up to 15 minutes for Draco's sobs to slow down. Draco sniffed and looked up at Harry, his eyes red, nose and cheeks crimson red. He's looking at Harry, his eyes filled with adoration. Harry doesn't think he'll ever get bored with Draco looking at him like that.
After classes, Belle and Blaise were in the Room of Requirement shagging. Ginny was in Theo's room, teaching him sign language.
The bell on the door jingles. Saved by the bells. He gets up and walks in the kitchen as Eveta goes to greet them and take their orders. Through the day, Harry keeps himself busy with all the cooking and baking but he just can't stop the shaking of his hands. There is a pit in his stomach. It feels like that day he let Draco down, let him go. As the sun starts to drown around 4pm, the sky out is pink, golden and blue. The bakery is separated in two parts; kitchen and the place for customers to sit. The wall in between the two rooms have a small window so that Harry can see the customers. The bakery is relatively empty as Eveta brings the plates and cups in the kitchen for washing. The bell on the door rings as the door open and Harry, he can't help but feel the despair, the pain as he looks who entered.
Draco feels Potter gently take hold of his left wrist from under him, pull it towards it and give his arm where the mark is placed a tender, loving, soft kiss with his chapped, not so soft lips.
"Potter what the fuck? I don't care if he's alive or dead. IT'S YOU I CARE ABOUT!" He yells. "Do you know what you've done? What part of him being the most important person of France did you not get? There will be a proper investigation, Potter. Investigation. What if you get caught?"
Pansy saw the letter and couldn't stop the tears from coming. She ran to her room. Luna ran behind her. Belle wanted to go too but she thought it would be better for Luna to be there for her. It might get them some way to bond as more than friends. They all exchanged worried looks.
"I'd also like not getting pissed upon or having me pee myself. I hated that." Draco says tentatively.
Belle's eyes went wide. Why did Pansy say this?
"It's called being polite, Potter. You should try it sometimes."
Great Moony thanks. Now she thinks I'm a idiot.
"Is this going to be a regular occurrence?" Draco asks.

"Mr Draco Malfoy, do you take Mr Harry Potter as your lawfully wedded husband, for better and for worse, for life and for death?"

"Unspeakable is one profession where occlumency is used."
"Yes dragon." Harry replied.
Harry looks away to give them privacy as they start to snog. Right there. In front of Harry. Those bitches.
I think I found a way to get the money.
Draco didn't realise his heavy panting, the whimpering he was doing. He took a deep breath, tried to regulate his breathing. Potter caught his waist from behind, holding him still, hugging him. He didn't realise how much he wanted the comfort , needed it, until he got it. He looked at the ballroom now, faded like yesterday's dream. The wallpaper was mouldy and tearing from everywhere. The room looked like death, just like the greeting room. He remembered Granger getting tortured by his maniac aunt. He remembered getting tortured himself here for years. He didn't even want to look towards the stairs that lead to the celler.
The glass escapes Scorpius's hands and shatters on the floor as he sees Rose kiss the Ravenclaw boy in the corridors. He felt rage. He storms towards Rose and pulls her away from that boy.
After a small pause, Draco shily nods. Harry leaves his cheeks, holds Draco's hands, gives his tear stained cheeks a kiss each side and smiles. Then he tells Draco about telling Ron and Hermione about liking Draco after that night in the bar. He tells Ron's reaction and Hermione reprimanding him to act surprised to which he does act. Literally acts and fakes being surprised only to say he can't do it. To Harry's happiness, Draco lets out a weak chuckle. It's a huge progress after three days of silence.
"I said no." He growls.
"You're back early." Harry says as he hears Draco enters the room.
Boobs
Draco won't run. He's done running. He'll sit here, finish the cake, pay and leave with his head high. He wasn't the one who used Potter. He was the one who got used. He starts working on his paper again, ignoring Potter who is standing there, looking at him. The worst part is, he can't even blame Potter. Draco is a Malfoy, he's Potter. How can Potter be with a Malfoy after everything they've done in the war. Draco just wishes, that Harry hadn't played him the way he did. He shouldn't have gone along when Draco kissed him, should have never flirted with Draco with his useless puns and compliments and sweet touches. He waits until Potter leaves and then takes a bite of his cake. Fucking Potter! He had to be good in this as well. Thanks to his occlumency that he can keep his emotions inside. He manages not to let a moan out. He sits there, finishes his cake, doesn't even ask for the frappe he had ordered, goes to the counter and leaves extra money, smiles at the girl on the counter and turns to leave. As soon as he opens the door to leave, Potter calls him.
Harry swallowed as he saw Draco's eyes light up. Damn. Now that Draco has this leverage, he'll be like a dog with a bone. Draco gave a huge smirk.
I woke up in the middle of the night. Teddy fast asleep on the bed. Draco was no where to be seen. Tilly was here so I went to check in the bathroom. I saw Draco laying down on the floor, he has a blade in one hand and cut marks on his left arm, on and around his dark mark.Â  I sit besides him and take him in my arms.
"Well Draco? Is it? Is it Harry Potter?" Father asks.
When the burial was done, we all left for Malfoy Manor. The lunch was getting served. Suddenly all went silent. I turned around to see my Mother standing at the entrance of main hall. My eyes went wide. I held Teddy tightly and kept my wand ready.
