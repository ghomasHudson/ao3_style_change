Both men were thankful for the Christmas Holiday as it would the would have to face or interact with each other for at least another 3 weeks, but the memory of that night couldn't be forgotten or ignored
Harry's expression told her what she already knew. It didn’t matter how much she loved him, she wasn't blind. She knew Ron had a strong point of view about most things, he only heard what he wanted to hear.
Draco was squirming under Harry’s words and slow movements, he never stood a chance. “All-All day. I- The lingerie, it made me- ah feel pretty.” he managed to respond under the sighs.
There he was, Draco Malfoy the ethereal beauty that chased him in his dream but this… this was more than Harry could ever dare to dream
They spend the entire day talking about the war, the horrors of it, the pain of the dead, the guilt of the survivors and how difficult it was to fake your own lucidness for others.
“Harry! Moms asking what are you going to bring for Christmas dinner so we don’t have two pies like last time”Ron laughed  between biscuits
“Oh Harry '' Still in Harry's arms Hermione state “Hes good for you, isn’t he?” and the answer was in the expression full of love that Harry’s face sported.
Before he could check himself, Harry pushed Draco against the door and started kissing him like he had been wanting to do since he saw him since they came back from the Holidays.
The night passed without rest for both men, they woke up next to each other when the blonde had to say goodbye to change for classes. Draco transfigurated his sheer gown into a pair of robes before giving the brunette a kiss in lips and a wink as a goodbye, throwing a piece of clothing that hit Harry in the face.
Draco feels like he's splitting by half but his body is still burning with desire, Harry’s hands have him completely immobilized and every whine that come out of his mouth is admonished by a slap in his arse, so he swallows his pride and propping himself with his elbow he faces Harry and hopes he looks as desperate as he feels.
“Are you going to let me be the only one without clothes, Potter?”  he said lickings his lips while running his hand against the red lace teasingly while maintaining a firm eye-contact.
The blond didn't seem to be faced by Harry's shock, and with an effortless grace stood up and started to make his way to him.
“I- No, I… I came here after- after the lounge, I-I…” explanations were lost in moans when Harry started to bite his neck marking it as his.
Draco had only counted in Harry being agreeable to repeat their performance in the bedroom every week or so, when the stress would accumulate, the blonde had not dared to hope the other man would actually find him desirable enough to have him as more than a reliever of frustration.
“Stop whining Malfoy and start packing, I'm sure the aurors will come soon and I don't think they would consider your velvet robes as “vital to retrieve”.”
He never thought that there would be a day where he dreaded when the invitation would be extended to him. And if he was being truthful with himself, it wasn’t the invitation that Harry feared, it was the inevitable conversation after the invitation that made the man lose all his appetite.
Knowing that his nemesis is next to him, throwing snark and whining about meaningless things, assures him, the only way Malfoy would be so chummy with him would be if the war had ended.
Harry had woken up with the comforting warmth in his chest and a weight against his hand. He slowly opened his eyes to see that beautiful blond hair and started softly caressing Draco’s belly smiling at the thought that soon their babies would start kicking.
Harry vanished his robes, with a flick of his hand, leaving in his underwear, not wanting to lose one second of the performance in front of him. His efforts were very well-paid when Draco shivered and pressed his thighs together upon the show of wandless magic.
It's slow but Harry regains control of his body, extends his arms, flexes his fingers and holds Malfoys robes to aid him when he stands up.
“Its because it not a she.” Harry let out evading his friend's eyes. “I never specified his pronouns. You have seen how Ron is when Ginny or Fred bring someone of the same sex, for him theres only gay or straight. I-I'm bi and I have been dating this guy for almost 2 years” Harry felt how a weight was lifted from his chest, his secret had been killing him especially since he had found out the special news with his boyfriend.
Finally Harry let go, he sets a brutal place plunging his cock into Draco’s tight hole with all his might. Harry fucks him with his sight firmly in Draco’s face taking pleasure in the sound and expression the blond made. The way Draco eyes are firmly shut completely lost in all the pleasure he's feeling made Harry roam his cock as deep as he could a few times chasing the pleasure of Draco’s walls tightening around him almost devouring him.
The answer made Harry lose control of himself for a moment, snapping his hips against Draco’s drawing moans from both of them.
That hungry lust-filled gaze is back and Harry shivers when it gives him a once-over stopping in the tent that has formed in his pants. Before he can make any movement to try and hide his obvious arousal, the blond lets out a soft moan and lets his dark gown slowly fall off his body leaving him only his lace bralette and knickers that did nothing to hide his own arousal.
“What I'm trying to tell you Mr. Potter, is that the war can ruin so many things. It's very easy to get lost in the memories and sometimes you would feel like you are still at war but that's why you need to anchor yourself. If it wasn't for Draco I would be in St. Mungos, now everytime i feel like slipping into madness I look at him, safe and sound, next to me and I know that it really is over.”
Harry's insecurities only grow with the arrival Summer Holidays but he refuses to tell Draco about. Harry can only hope his story with Draco doesnt end here.
Draco, noticing the way the brunette stopped his distributions, narrows his eyes before grabbing his robes, spinning and pushing him. The other man can only fall into his bed, thinking the blond was done with him, but his mouth dries at the look the blond is giving him.
Harry groans when Draco’s lips capture his own feeling every noise that escapes the blonde in his own mouth. The way Draco’s hips start to match his own thrusts made Harry realize Draco is accustomed enough to take everything Harry is about to give him, so he lets go of Draco's pink nubs and breaks the kiss smirking at the needy whines he hears.
His life had been defined by the war and Voldemort, so many people died for him and what he represented.
As Draco start to fuck his own throat with Harry’s cock, the brunette watches how Draco lowers one hand to rub his own aching prick over the red lace knickers. Harry is unable to hold back the moans at the sight of Draco Malfoy touching himself while choking himself on Harry’s cock. The feeling of Draco’s throat tightening and the vibration of his mouth when he moans are almost too much for Harry.
Draco looks completely drunk in lust and whimpers escape from his mouth with every thrust even if the blond seemed to be painfully biting his lower lip to prevent it. “I… My-oh god...my nipples are-ah”
But it didn't matter lonely or accompanied, the two of them went to sleep with the other in mind and a ghost touch solidified their dreams.
“I'm afraid your going to look for your own anchor Mr. Potter, besides I think you would give him back in less than a week.”
“He's everything that I'm not and still we are exactly the same. I never thought I could love someone so much Hermione, most days I think I will explode from all the feelings I have for him”
It happened again, only a couple steps inside the Manor, it had happened so many times that Harry could feel it before it happened.
“Harry the war is over. You won” Malfoys says, slowly like talking to a child, the thought of being treated like a kid makes him frown but the words sink and his hand drops the wand. “Harry can you breathe? My mother thinks you're dying and I don't think this is your ideal way of passing”
That day was the first day, Harry didn't feel cold, a warmth had settled in his chest watching Malfoy and his mother discuss trivial things like there's nothing more important, and there wasn't, they had each other and that's enough for them. Harry went to sleep having made his peace with the Malfoys.
Harry was done, Rons comment had erased any doubt of his decision that he had when he entered their apartment “I'm not going to the Burrow for Christmas” and before he could be interrupted he continued “I'm not lying about my partner. I have never had any kind of romantic interest in Ginny and I'm done with Ron ignoring my decisions thinking he knows me better than myself.”
“I’ve been wondering why are you wearing this” Harry asks huskily between thrusts whilst he nibbles Draco’s earlobe making him face him.
Which of course, only fed Harry’s amusement. “I don't have a thing for lingerie, Draco. I have a thing for you in lingerie” and that comment had no right to be as arousing as it was.
Harry smiled and kissed Hermione’s forehead “I know well I didn’t but my partner did, he has a knack for public relations, we have a plan. After we go into hiding we will send a statement to the most important media so that no one can twist the facts. We will make some false clues about our destiny of flight so that they can't trace us“
Sensing the blonde mind wasn't in the moment Harry growled and bit the blonde’s shoulder drawing his attention and a moan. “Stop overthinking it, Draco. I want you and I plan to have you under me until you are either fed up with me or no longer able to keep up with me.”
And who was Harry to refuse that kind of proposal, between the blowjob and rimming they were both slick enough and Harry's patience was not infinite. Harry slapped Draco’s hand away from his cock and pushed the blonde head into the pillows again, before returning his attention to the red arse in front of him smacking the right cheek when he heard a mocking laugh muffled by the pillows.
Now, Harry was planning to make right by Draco and, Narcissa had another thing coming if she thought he would give up the blonde without a fight.
Draco knew how the cold Harry had felt when he had died so he held him close in every chance he had and Harry knew how trapped and alone Draco had felt in his own house so made sure to touch him every time he saw him, reminding him he was with him and Harry wasn't planning on leaving him alone any time soon.
Harry drags his hips back before slamming back in and repeats the slowly but brutal pace letting his chest fall until he can feel Draco’s back against him. He lets Draco’s wrist go and while depositing soft kisses in his collarbone, Harry maneuvers Draco until he has both his wrist in his hand in a thigh hold above his head while his other hand is playing with the blond’s pink nipple above his bralette.
A hand goes to his blond hair gripping it and pulling him until they are kissing again. Harry runs his tongue along Draco’s, drawing a long moan that almost draws a smirk out of him. Draco’s mind was going blurry, overwhelmed from the intensity of the kiss, so much he did not register when the other man pulled away and shoved the blond head until he was facing his groin again.
He had picked the blonde and left the Hall without a word, his only focus had been the shivering blonde in his arms, still catactonic from fear but sobered enough to recognize Harry as someone safe. In the security of Draco’s bedroom, Harry saw the other fall into pieces, crying and sobbing in his arms when all Harry could do was being next to him and repeat assurances in his ear.
Draco could feel how Harry’s length was slowly growing inside his hole, still full of come that was threatening to start dripping out of it because of the way the brunette was lazily rolling his hips and rubbing his bottom.
Things went south some days before the Christmas Holidays in Howards. In the Professors party someone had brought some extra bottles of wine and without knowing how, Harry ended up shoving Draco into his room and fucking him  against the wall with clothes still on and only holding him from his thighs and ass.
“Patience, Draco. Don't make me stop just to smack your lovely arse again” Harry taunts, the moans he hears almost making him laugh out loud but the lovely sight of his fingers pumping in and out of Draco’s greedy hole is much more worthy of his attention.
It was only a week after the start of term when Draco’s patience found its end, he was no gryffindor he didn't have the bravery that required to make an indecent proposal in public but he was ambitious and cunning and so he planned his next move where Harry Potter would have to make his mind about them.
Draco comes with a cry, walls clenching even more if possible around Harry’s cock, while the blonde completely melts in Harry’s hold. Draco’s knees had long given up and the only thing holding him now was Harry’s tight grip on him.
Harry just wanted to spend a whole day with Draco, a beautful man he had the pleasure to call friend and also a man who let Harry have his wicked way with his body. But Harry sees and does something he shouldnt have, and now he is presented with a very real threat to his relationship Draco.
Draco couldn't help himself when he gripped Harry’s tame of black hair and pulled him closer to  kiss his lips again, this time softer and slower showing the longing they had endured for the past weeks.
Draco looked over his shoulder with a teasing smirk, “Are you telling me, that our hero has a thing for lace lingerie? Should I lend you mine after this, Potter?”
Harry didn't stop defending them until his voice had faltered from shouting to the court. In the end, Lucius was thrown in Azkaban after confessing in exchange of freedom for his family, and Narcissa and Malfoy had been set free with a parole and ridiculous fine for “war reparations”.
Everybody knew he had been born to defeat Voldemort, to finally end the war that Grindelwald and Dumbledore had started.
“What about Christmas, Harry” softly said Hermione, who as perceptive as always noticed the apprehensiveness in his friends face
“Stop getting cheeky, Malfoy” Harry whispers slowly filling Draco’s hole, one rough hand wrapped around a pale wrist and pinning it against Draco’s arching back while the other is firmly grabbing the pale hips preventing the other man from moving and occasionally spanking the blond’s bottom, drawing moans and screaming with each slap.
The sight of Draco, the master of the poker face, not being able to pull himself together to finish a sentence, urges Harry to pick up his pace. But the cries from Draco, when Harry’s hand starts pinching the pink nubs, doesn't escape him.
Harry is close now, his cock is being strangled by Draco, who's crying and moaning from the oversensitivity of being fucked throught his orgasm, everything is too much for Harry.
It had appeared in the first page of every newspaper or magazine.Ex-Death Eaters were being hunted, with a count of almost a dozen of deaths an extremist group announced their objective was to erase any kind of Voldemort residue in the world. Some people called the angels of vengeance, Harry called them terrorist, the photo of the victims, a family of purebloods who had an only 10 year old girl appeared in his nightmares and filled him with fear
So with abandon Harry chases his own pleasure plowing into Draco’s tight spasming channel, his own knees trembling with effort to keep himself up before falling over Draco, hips stuttering in their pace as he buries himself and deposit his load deep into Draco’s sensitive entrance. The sight of Draco’s chanel stuffed with Harry’s cock and filled with come put a smile in the brunette's face.
Harry had never felt so useless, after that he refused to let Draco dismiss the incident as if nothing had happened. He had forced Draco to cuddle with him under the covers, ignoring the attempts of doing something more.
They had just finished cumming and Harry seemed to be already working him up for the next round, he could feel Harry’s cock still inside him and Draco’s own prick twitching showing interest. Draco couldn't believe this was the same man that had been ignoring his advances and his existence for a whole week.
“If you don't put your cock in me, Potter. I swear...”, another slap interrupts him and another moans escapes him.
The blonde gives him an once-over before leaving the room, nose held high and robes dramatically flaunting. The familiarity of the dramatic exit leaves a smirk in Harry’s face.
the list never ends neither does the screams, they are so loud Harry wants to cover his ears but his hands don't respond to him anymore. His whole body revels against him, shaking indecisive of bracing for the pain or attacking others, Harry fights for control every time but he nevers wins, he falls prey from his own body.
Implied but Harry’s declaration and lightheaded for the make-out Draco made his own revelations. “It was my first time, too. Purebllods are not really encouraged to have sex outside marriage, I never was tempeted but since that night...in the room I... ”
The first one showed her two men dancing and playing in the snow until they stopped for a kiss. She recognized her friend and she also recognized the other men
There were still bad days, when the cold became too much to bear, those rare nights where he was alone, he would curl and wrap himself while he trembled and cried until he knocked himself out and tried to start the day again.
Harry was confused, during the day Draco had been giving him the cold-shoulder, there had been plenty opportunities for the blond to try to seduce Harry. They had even passed a complete hour alone in the lounge where Harry anxiously glanced in his direction waiting for the blond to take a seat next to him and softly move his hand to his tight like he had done several times before.
A hysterical laugh makes its way out of Harry's mouth when he forces his lungs to breathe in and out. It's slow but his body is still uncooperative, he focuses on Malfoys calm voice.
The letter wasn't really a letter, it was two pictures, tears slipped through her eyes and a smile filled her face when she pulled the pictures closed to the light to see them.
“What happened, Potter couldn't get his cock wet during the Holiday so now he's looking for any warm hole” the bitterness Draco felt escaped between the words while he tried to bury his face in the pillows.
Harry was experiencing what could only be described as a divine experience and, if it wasn't for a pair of grey eyes that watch with vivid attention all his movements, he would have dropped to his knees to worship the ethereal creature in front of him
He’s freezing, he cant feel his fingers, where is he? Is he dead? Again? Is he sleeping? Is there a difference?
But he will be dead if he lets this night end just like that. Harry needed to fuck Draco with all his might to ensure that this wounldt the last night the blond would be under him.
Harry cringed at the question and Hermione knew that the news hadn’t ended. “Actually, We have decided to go into hiding until it is safe. I don’t know when will see each other so I really wanted to go without regrets or secrets between us,”
Wearing a sheer black dressing gown that was very loosely tied and did next to nothing to cover his taunting white skin that almost seemed to be begging to be marked.
“Harry, I never thought you lied but you have never brought her to any kind of reunion so I thought that it wasn’t really serious” The woman bashfully admitted. She knew that Harry had never shown any kind of interest in Ginny, romantic it is, but Ron strongly believed that  they were made for each other.
Harry would, now, wake up feeling a warm body next to him, assuring him that he didn't need to fight no longer, he could just lost himself between kisses and laughter with the beautiful man curled in his chest and nothing could stop him, there were no monster or wars in his door only a beautiful Draco waiting for him in the nights.
He only left his home to speak in the tribunals, trying to make right by the people who were next to him and assure that those who hurt them wouldn't see the light in a long time.
But there's no attacker, there's no danger, there's only Draco and his mother looking concerned and troubled, maybe because Harry is still pointing his wand when neither of them even had a wand.
It would take him months before starting to feel like he was in control of his own body, he still hadn't found an anchor but he settled for the company of his friends and now Draco.
The fine had included Malfoy's Manor and Harry, a bleeding heart as always, had helped the Malfoys to pick their personal belongings.
Before he could utter any other offensive word , Harry stood up almost knocking the tea table and tensely went to the kitchen ignoring Ron's call.
Neither of them knew what overcame them. Both of them never had any kind of sexual relationship before. Between the war and his fame the only romantic experience Harry had were that tears taste kiss he shared with Cho and an even more awkward kiss he had when Ginny practically attacked him at the end of the battle of Hogwarts, luckily the redhead got the message when he didn’t move to respond to the kiss. After that any kind of outing with someone from the opposite sex or even the same sex, depending how desperate the reporter was, made the media harassed him to the point of exhaustion, that scared him enough of dating or even going out with friends.
Draco continues to move forward, all the way until he's straddling Harry’s lap, giving a coy look before starting depositing small kisses in the brunette’s neck and travelling his delicate hands to his chest.
The panics settling in his body, the thighness in his chest making him fight for every breath gasping and panting as if his lungs had forgotten how to breathe, his eyes overflowing with tears he had shed so many times before. His mind reliving all the pain of the war, and his body trembling and sobbing trying to protect themselves from the danger that had already been defeated.
“Let's see who’s not going to keep up with who, Potter.” with the smirk still firmly in his face Draco started to roll his hips, slowly rolling back and forth while clenching his arse massaging the length inside him, savoring the expressions that passed in Harry's face as well as the firm hold the man had in his waist.
Harry laughed at the glare that Draco sent his way. “Finally you can put that mouth to a good use, Malfoy”
But he knew, he wasn't the only one, he saw how the older years would jump from loud noises and hide before remembering that no one was coming for them, he saw Neville evade the dungeons everyday because it made him remember the cellars in the Manor and the Carrows, he even saw McGonahall refusing to step a foot in the Headmasters office until it was completely renovated.
“My son loves complaining, Mr. Potter, his favorite topic by far is you. Oh, he would drive Lucius crazy when he came back from Hogwarts. “Father, you would never believe what Potter did now”, “Father, did you know that Potter said that” and “everyone thinks he's so smart, wonderful Potter with his scar and his broomstick”, oh I was more than happy to let Lucius pick him up so he could wear him down.”
“They are sensitive, aren't they Draco.” it's more of a statement than a question then he let gos the pale wrists now rededding from his hold, and now both hands are rubbing and pinching Draco’s nipples, drawing cries and moans out of the pink lips. ”I bet you play with them every night, don't you”
“Merlin, Harry. I-I'm sure we can discuss tha-that later,”Draco cried, slowly rising and releasing the sheet from his tight hold, without warning he reached and grabbed Harry’s cock with a tight hold and a debauched smile. “No-Now I need you to fuck me”
It was in the living room of the Granger-Weasley apartment where the monthly Golden Trio reunion took place. As always the tea was warm and the biscuits were crunchy, and with the Holidays around the corner there's a question that was suspended in the limits of the conversation.
He falls down to his knees pushed by an invincible force, his hands are thrown over his head, uncoordinated elbows knocking each other, his heart pumping as loud as the screams, who's screamin? Is he screaming? Is his mind screaming? Are the dead ones screaming?
“I-I have more pairs. Bu-But this is the-oh first time I used them, the-the whole day.” Draco was struggling keeping his head clear with the combination of Harry’s hips rolling against him while his cock was steadily growing inside him and brushing his prostate.
Ron oblivious to the tension in the room continued “I told you, you needed to ask Ginny when she broke up with the Tom guy. Really, you need to put your moves on her it's now or never”
Draco opened his eyes to a silver light and soft humming. It was a familiar song. In hindsight, he should’ve thrown a fit, considering he was resting his head on Potter’s shoulder. But instead, he paused and felt his breath hitch.
“I’ll ignore it,” The blond said with an unamused snort, yet he had a faint smile and the flutter returned. A small irritating flutter. “You can’t resist a reference, can you?”
Instead of prancing around, it was standing still and it didn’t vanish either. Absent-mindedly, he started to hum in a soft voice, oblivious to the fact that Draco Malfoy was awake, and listening to him.
He fished out the snitch with a small smile. The wings opened and fluttered as it hovered mid-air. “I was thinking about Quidditch. Sort of.”
He was convinced that the front page of the prophet would contain an absurd headline with a picture of Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter. It would cause a stir. "You're certain?"
Words had vanished from Harry's mind. His throat was left parched and the twinge in his chest intensified. He had a strange and compelling urge to comfort Draco but he couldn’t figure out how. Now, his thoughts were a whirlwind. “Draco -"
Draco gave him a soft nod as he rose from the couch. It was a reassurance – A reassurance that it will all even out in the end. “Rest well, Potter.”
“I might’ve mentioned a while ago that I wouldn’t’ve solved the complex riddles if not for Hermione,” He had a distinct change to the voice. It was softer, drenched in fondness. It had a small trace of fear as well. He wouldn’t’ve survived for six years without his best friends. “Ron, too.”
He was snoring with his lips parted slightly, and a strand of hair was over his left eye. Harry absent-mindedly brushed it out of his face. “I’m not perfect, you know?”
“In that moment, yes.” Harry said with a strained voice. He had wanted to hurt Bellatrix. Wanted her to pay the price for killing Sirius. Yet, he couldn’t. “I used the cruciatus curse on her – It didn’t work.”
“I’m not.” He chuckled, while opening the door, just wide enough for his skinny body to slip through to avoid the loud creaking sound it would create. The air was cold enough for the breath to appear in icy puffs. Malfoy closed the door with a soft ‘thud’ and turned to the sea. “for the record, I’ll never be finished with the remarks.”
” Draco’s voice was small. A mouse’s protest. The brunet could detect a trace of reluctance in the words. It caused a soft warmth to course within him for a brief moment, “neither do you.”
“If we’re clear –” He whispered in a clear voice, unclasping the hand, “– focus on the wand motion –” He paused and cleared his throat while he inched backward, “– on your stance and cast the charm.”
A laugh escaped his mouth. “In the second year, we brewed the Polyjuice Potion to spy on the suspected heir of Slytherin.” He said the ‘Heir of Slytherin’ in a mysterious mock voice. “As Crabbe and Goyle.”
"Pansy, for starters, might've mentioned it once or twice when we were working on a case," He said with a sigh. "she was on about a black dress for four hours," Draco shifted slightly, curling his fingers around the soft fabric. "for what it's worth, it suits you."
Harry remained silent. He didn’t imagine that Malfoy could’ve said ‘no’ to Lucius. If he wanted his son to be a death eater, then he would be one. And Lucius wouldn’t reason with Voldemort. Not even for Draco.
“Very witty,” Harry said in a slow, sarcastic drawl. A section of Harry Potter in the prophet written by Draco Malfoy was a cause of concern. A nightmare, in fact. “If you write, I’ll start a section about you.”
Malfoy did not wipe the scowl off his face. He did get the strawberries and chop it into pieces. He did not get the whipped cream either, because he was Draco Malfoy.
mourn you,” Malfoy said with the faintest laugh, seemingly unaffected by the glares or scowls. “A bit of patience, Potter. Patience.”
He wasn’t a pretentious, conceited prat that he was at Hogwarts. Beneath the poise and sardonic retorts was a Draco Malfoy who cared about Harry Potter. A small change. “I – we’re friends if you want to be friends.”
Draco focused on Christmas at the Malfoy Manor, yet it failed to cause the surge of content. Instead, it caused fear to course within. “I – I can’t find one.”
His eyes widened, as a blue light hit him in the chest. He stumbled backwards, and his vision was out of focus.
He wandered out in the evening for the cup of tea. And it was waiting on the counter. With the perfectly sliced lemon on the side.
Malfoy placed the paperback on the table, treaded into the bedroom, and closed the door behind him with a loud thud. “Or lock yourself in. A clever idea.”
“Christ, not a fight-fest with you,” He shifted in place with a curse, brows frowning, fingers fidgeting with the cup. “One of us is bound to screw up with an insensitive retort in the first five seconds.”
Harry frowned. Malfoy should’ve been starving, considering he hadn’t eaten in a while. Not that he cared, of course. He was merely curious. Besides, he didn’t have an appetite either. “I suppose we could bake cookies, if the oven –
“And I’m with an insufferable, excessively sarcastic Gryffindor. I’m at the verge of losing my sanity.”
He was merely tolerating Malfoy’s presence, wasn’t he? It wasn’t as if he cared about the blond. Provided he didn’t entirely despise him, he wasn’t particularly fond of him either. “Will you quit staring, Potter?”
He yelped, an intense pain flaring up his right side and he turned to squint at Draco. Perhaps, it wasn’t fractured, yet it was aching. “Oh, you’re not a delicate figurine, Potter.”
“You had the fucking audacity to keep it from me.” The blond inched closer, and his eyes were radiating stone-cold fury and his fists were clenched to the side – nails digging into his palm – as he trembled slightly. “Bon sang, Potter. Out of pity, you decided to –
“It’s a blackout,” He said with an uneven exhale, fingers curled into the back of the brunet’s maroon sweater, “occurs once or twice a month,” Draco leaned into him, which caused a small, incessant flutter in his chest, “Do not,” He whispered with a soft snort, “plot
Malfoy cursed with a soft groan. Clever, sarcastic retorts were rather amusing since they irritated the blond. “I should rethink your subtle and not-so-sarcastic compliments over the years.”
Malfoy caught the snitch and it struggled within the confinement. He half-turned to him with a confused frown and an arched eyebrow. Right on cue. “Why do you have a snitch with you, Potter?”
And the rage curled in him again. He crumbled the piece of parchment, and tossed it aside. He pounded his fists against his head. His body was shaking with the intensity of emotions.
“Perhaps you should cast a glance around the place when you not-so subtly compliment the chosen one.”
A flicker of hurt flashed across Potter’s face as he retracted his hand. The warmth lingered for one second. Only for one fucking second. “I don’t pity you, Malfoy.”
Draco–in an impulsive move very unlike himself because apparently an influx of emotions makes you incapable of making sound decisions–is the one to claw through the last seams of the silence first, "It's not pride, you know? Simply self-preservation."
“Don’t. I – I don’t want your fucking pity.” Draco exhaled softly and closed his eyes, only to open them as he felt another brush of fingertips and a soft touch on his arm, and he flinched slightly. “Don’t fucking touch me.”
“Sure, Potter.” Malfoy muttered half-heartedly. He added one half of the dry into the mixing bowl, and the blond whisked it together. Once the consistency was a lot smooth, he added the other half to it.
“Oh, if your vocabulary is functioning well, why can’t you string the words into a proper sentence and continue with our conversation instead of –” A pause. “are we friends, Harry?”
“Ice skating,” Harry said, laughing at the horrified expression on his face. “It isn’t that difficult.”
He didn’t have proper control over wandless magic. Of course, accidental magic was different. He chuckled, as his mind traced back to Aunt Marge – She had an inflated ego, and he wanted her to get over it. In hindsight, ‘inflated’ wasn’t the best choice of thought.
If he wanted to perfect it, he had to focus on the flow of the charm and he had to avoid a sporadic result. He figured that Hermione would’ve taught him to control it. She wasn’t with him though, and he had to figure it out on his own.
Draco stuttered out an incoherent mumble, which caused the brunet to chuckle for a brief minute until the shiver returned, “which, by the way, was a kind act – unwise, but kind.”
A small frown creased his forehead while he lifted a hand and caught the seashell and turned it over in his hand. It was cold.
"The precious Saviour to the rescue," the hint of ruefulness returned for a brief second, "you treaded over the hope, when you said that you will find a way out," Draco turned his head to Harry, "Once you do, I'm certain you won't care if I'm on a severed Island, alone and suffering,” A beat. “You won't fucking care at all."
“Yes, you’ve mentioned it once,” He could vaguely recall the change in the course of the conversation, when he had confessed that Ron was the first friend, he had in eleven years. “when we were –”
He was vulnerable, yet intimidating. And Draco found it to be both intriguing and irritating. He was almost beautiful. Almost. Draco decided he wouldn’t think about it again. Or even let the thought enter his mind.
Harry frowned. Malfoy was watching him with a hint of curiosity. He waved his hand dismissively in the air, and muttered a quick cleaning charm on the kitchen. One simple charm drained him. It wasn't a lot, but it did.
The brunet chuckled, raising the cup to his lips and the eyes widened with a small sip. “It’s incredible, considering it’s a tea without sugar.”
Malfoy scowled, and half-turned to face him with an arched eyebrow, “Oh, the world is ending every fucking day – what’s your point, Potter?”
Completely undeterred, Harry laughs heartily and leans forward to rub his cheek against Draco's before biting it, earning him a squawk of annoyance.
He brushed a stand of blond hair out of Draco’s face, and his fingers trailed to his chin. He closed the distance between them, with a soft and slow kiss.
“Yes, the red one.” Malfoy said with a confused frown and he was certain if the blond had figured it out, it would’ve turned into a feud-fest. “No trouble with levitating a small seashell, is there?”
“So, now you can’t form coherent –” He paused when Draco’s head drifted to his shoulder, the shirt soaking the cold sweat which was forming on his forehead.  “– sentences.”
Malfoy had a smile on his lips, and he raised the cup of tea to his lips to hide it. He held the cup in his hand, savouring the warms for a while. “Earl grey?”
He chuckled with a slight shake to his head, leading Draco to the centre of the room, to a place he had chosen on purpose. A place underneath a particular constellation.
“Fantastic – We have to deal with each other. We should bake in peace, and you – blond Stuart Little – can return to your bedroom after that.”
“I’ll consider it,” Draco said, underlining it with a well-practiced smirk. It was amusing to rile up the brunet, and the muffled groan he received in response was worth it. “You want to read another novel or –
“I don’t care if the obligations are fuck-all to you.” The words were underlined with a glare, as though daring the brunet to argue. “I had to save the ones I care about and I don’t regret it.”
He had to get out of here. Lucius Malfoy had disarmed him, and he didn’t have a fucking wand. He hadn’t fixed his glasses yet. With a groan, he closed his eyes, casting a wandless
The blond frowned, as he brushed the strand out of his eyes. The light was falling on his face, and his skin was even – Oh, shut up. “Sure you weren’t.”
“Yes, we can. And now get out! Nobody wants you here,” Ron glared at Harry while the smaller boy froze. Harry was still shocked by his ‘friend’s’ behaviour, standing there dumbfounded while the others stared at him.
"You," that voice was familiar, he knew who it was, "Ron?" No answer, "Ron is that you?" Harry felt desperate, the two figures were now more clear. They were his two best friends sporting angry expressions, and staring at Harry with hateful eyes.
Harry wished he could have a decent day, even just one normal day. Sometimes he wondered why Sirius never visited him. He missed him, but maybe Sirius had something better to do than checking on his worthless godson. Harry shook his head, trying to stop his train of thoughts, and continued doing his chores.
"how many lies that have you been told us? Am I not loyal to you?  ," now Ron's face turned red in anger.
Until he saw Weasley and Granger walking together in the hallway from the end of the hall, whispering loudly to each other. He gave an idea to test the Weasley temper but it's no a good idea to do it alone.
Draco was having a perfectly normal Hogwarts first day. Pansy and Blaise looked like disasters when he found them, probably from their snogging on the train. Sometimes he wondered if they had any sense of shame at all. Knowing Blaise he wouldn’t but it wasn't the same way for Pansy, he assumed that Pansy became like this because of Blaise which wasn't surprising if it was. The three of them were walking together leisurely.
He was tense and his breath was bated, wanting to pay no attention to all the people staring at him; his vision blurring as he started to panic.
"It's okay, you are like me when I was alive. I feel sorry for you, you can open up with me," Now Draco rolled his eyes because he didn't care what happened to the golden boy.
"Have you seen Harry Potter today? I've been wonder where the boy this morning," Albus ask in wonder.
"I can’t believe they let you back, ” Ron muttered darkly. “You killed my brother, you belong to Azkaban! You bloody murderer,” Harry ducked his head down and left, trying to avoid everyone and everything. He bit his lip to stop it from trembling, and firmly squeezed his eyes to stop unwanted tears from welling up.
How could he protect the whole wizarding world from that insane wizard when he couldn't even do this? How could he still save everyone,
“Ow! Are you blind or something?” The owner of the voice paused and Harry became more tense when he recognized the voice that belonged to a certain red haired boy.
"We haven't met him today, actually " Ms Granger answers. And it makes Minerva winder, how they haven't seen the boy?
, but he didn't want to know. Harry had felt stuck in his head and his back hurt. He merely remembered that there was blood, and then everything went black.
He asked himself, did he even sleep anymore? He didn't even notice that his uncle and aunt had ignored him in the past few days like nothing had happened...or maybe they didn't know.
Harry had been laying on the floor unable to move for hours now, it was probably already night time. He let his magic heal his body slowly, feeling some discomfort on his stomach.
After all of that dinner commenced and everyone started heading to their respective dorms.  Pansy and Blaise immediately went to the dorms and Draco decided that he wanted to take a walk.
His father and mother died, his relative hated him and himself again.  Alone, hated to be left behind, and just be a person, troubling the lives of others.  Is he supposed to be everyone's saviour?  Why should he?  everyone would die because of him, he couldn't do it, he couldn't. He ran even faster and into the bathroom and crying there, he sits on the cold floor and hugs his legs into a ball.
"What are you doing walking alone potter? Looking for another target and blaming it on you know who?"  Ron said in a dark voice.  Harry trembled a little as he faced his former friend, his mind immediately telling him how much he hated it like this.
"Did you see last year? I saw something was not right with his behavior ... like he faked his courage at the tournament last year," said Pansy, the others started to shut up and set their eyes on his friend,
His face paler than ever and his eyes winded in shock and fear. His hand trembling and his knee are weak to keep his thin body stand. He saw a dead body belongs to Cedric.
“What are you doing here Malfoy? Aren’t you supposed to be with the other Slytherins?” Potter asked surprisingly softly.
Harry heard that but he cannot seem to find where the source of the voice from. He finally kicks himself mentally and finally moves. He broke his gaze from Cedric’s dead body and look at in front of him. He saw Percy on the ground wandless and seems in panic and scare.
This was the first time he had ever seen the golden boy crying. Draco also realized that Potter was whispering something to himself, he didn't know what it was but he felt as if he was intruding on something.
He didn’t realize that the train whistle had blown, he felt tired and his eyes were heavy considering that he never got a decent amount of sleep at the Dursleys.
"I heard that you're a queer Potty," Harry kept silent, afraid of what would happen next. "Potty is a queer? How shocking," the gang laughed, Harry knew that they said it to get a reaction but he still didn't want to give them any satisfaction so he kept a stone face.
Ron let go of him and left the Emerald's eyes standing stiff and in shock.  Harry believed he had heard a small, freak-like whisper from the tall man.  He felt somethings staying him in his chest,  the intense pain in his chest making him hard to breathe .  He wants to be alone now but he is alone, always alone, he runs to Mrytle's bathroom and cries there.  It was so painful, he felt back again in his past.
“No! That’s not true... I would never kill anyone besides you, you monster! ” Harry cried and point his wand to the dark lord.
"It's your fault Harry, you failed me," said Percy's body laying on the ground lifeless. The dead body faced Harry with the eyes  open and staring at him.
He started to run not knowing where he was going, he didn’t care where to, he just wanted the stares to cease.
"Eh… guys, are you guys feeling off with the new DADA teacher?"  said Daphne while glancing at the woman who was dressed in all pink who was so eye-catching that it bled.
She just getting more and more worried about where the Potter boy at. Is there something that happens to him? Or someone just hurt him?
He was sure that his wrists were going to bleed soon. And they did. There wasn't much blood, only the angry-looking scratches that formed the wound. He felt the pain, but at least it alleviated his feelings.
“Why would I need something from people like you?” Malfoy shot back. It made Harry flinch, the sentence hit too close to home. It called him useless and reminded him of everything he had heard from the Dursleys and Dumbledore.
He glanced beside the pink teacher he saw an unusual expression on the headmaster's face.  He looked like he was looking for someone and that must be Potter, really confused about what the headmaster had always wanted.  Why is Potter always the one he's looking for?
“No!” Harry cried. He knows that they are the most hated people he ever met but, they are mother family. What will she think of him now?
"No wonder everyone attacked Potter earlier" Theo suddenly came to sit next to Draco on the soft sofa.
“Why would I be happy? You…you killed them!” Harry said in terror. But the other him laughs as an answer. He just keeps laughing louder and louder  and make Harry frightened
Minerva just stood there disbelieve. With a hard heart, she dismissed her self and try to find the Potter boy if he fine or not.
A loud bang sounded from his door and he opened his eyes. He hadn't realised that he was screaming out loud this whole time. His uncle was in the doorway looking angry and he knew that he was fucked. Vernon grab a handful of Harry's hair and threw him into the wall. "BOY! IF YOU WON'T SHUT UP, YOU WILL BE SLEEPING IN THE CUPBOARD !" Vernon screamed, kicking the smaller boy in his stomach. Harry curled his body into a ball, whimpering at the sudden pain.
The blood was still slowly spilling out, dripping down to the floor and staining his oversized shirt which was wet from his tears.
Draco shrugged, "So what do you want to do?” Blaise was about to say something but Draco swiftly covered his mouth, knowing he would get an inappropriate answer and he was having none of it.
Everything was black, he couldn't see their faces when their eyes were everywhere staring at him, glaring, accusing. At this point Harry was uncomfortable and slightly panicked. His breathing was heavy yet quiet, air silently forcing itself out of his lungs in small gasps. He pushed his trolley straight ahead, but the longer he walked the more people stared at him, whispers following him the entire way. It was impossible to avoid the effects of Harry just being there.
“AAAH” Harry fall from his bed and he winces from the bruise he has on his body. He stays on the cold floor panting and sweating. All of those were just a dream…. He felt exhausted and tired, unlike he has a good sleep anyway.
But at Hogwarts... it felt different without his friend.  Now friends have left in his dictionary book.
Harry tensed up and turned around, “W-what do you mean? I’m a Gryffindor, so this is my house?” he asks with an apprehensive and confused expression.
He walked to the bathroom and the surroundings were quiet and cold.  He walked in and he heard the sound of someone sobbing inside.  At first, he ignored it but he saw the ghost of a girl heading towards the sobbing voice.
Harry was locked in his room again as usual, nothing new. He usually opened his books and studied, he hadn't realised how fun studying could be before. Hermione just made studying feel like torture, and studying with Ron was no better, he always complained about everything and everyone.  He'd even acted like Dudley last year, looking back Ron had never been a good friend. Harry thought about the Weasleys, they all blamed Harry for 'murdering' Percy. Ginny gave him death glares and the twins had sprung an awful prank on him that had almost made him blind. Ron had started throwing insults at him, and it shocked Harry that Ron had done such a thing to him. Even Hermione had somewhat mirrored Ron's behaviour, going as far as to ignore Harry completely when he was in the same room. They'd both been ignoring him, and Harry didn't know what to do about it besides just dealing with it.
He didn’t realize that he was crying, He pressed hard his palm to his forehead trying to ease the emotion he had, all awful thing has ever encounter flashing before his eyes. Harry harshly thug his hair hard trying to remove all memory he just remembers.
He's trying to find his glasses, but he has them on his face. His vision finally got clear and trying to analyze his surrounding. The terror on his face and his face became paler,  he was in the cemetery again. He forces himself to stand up and look around just to make sure.
Minerva's voice started a bit hushed. She cared about the boy, she wants to help him but Albus always denied the fact the boy still need the help that he deserves.
The cause of the sobbing came from the toilet or, as Draco found as he curiously peeked around the corner, was coming from Potter. 'Potter? Crying?' Draco thought incredulously.
“No? Why not? We finally free Harry, think about it. No one will stop you, no one will use you and no one will hurt you anymore.”
Draco was supposed to get out of the bathroom and he did.  Processing what happened in that bathroom.  So Potter the boy who lived in silence cried and all the people he used to call 'friends' left him.  it was unbelievable how blind those people were, he let out a chuckle and finally, he went back to the basement and back to his dorm.  His friends will be shocked when they hear this.
Potter expected that he would insult him, Draco thought it was odd. “Blaise and Pansy are snogging, also Crabbe and Goyle are idiots so move it before I kick it off,” He growled
Harry felt disbelief in the fact that everyone believed Ron rather than him, he felt hurt inside but hid it and walked back to the Gryffindor dormitories.
funny ... now that Draco felt sorry for the golden boy, everyone should praise him, like him, love him.  Now that their topic of conversation was unusual, they never felt sorry for anyone other than their own house mate.
Then she came suddenly.  To be honest, Draco liked to be open about the ghost, but not very open.  As long as she doesn't leak about the things he said, he's okay with her.
All of those are the worse moment. He wants all the memories to go away and that makes him pull his hair even harder and make some of his hair pulled out from his scalp, whimpering from the emotional pain he felt inside.
Vernon decided he was done with the useless freak then, and ended it with one last kick on the weak body. He left, leaving the light off and locking the door. Harry could finally breathe, and greedily gulped the stale air into his lungs, not caring about anything else in the moment.
He tried to stop himself but can’t, he try to push himself screaming tell them to stop, garbing anything like rock but he seem can’t touch anything. He fell useless and panic trying to save Percy. But it’s too late.
Harry's face instantly showed fear and discomfort until he hid it under a similar mask. "None of your business," he answered softly and left. Draco was mildly disgruntled by the tone of his voice but didn't think much of it. After a moment, he returned to the dungeons.
Harry sat alone in a carriage on his way to the Castle, the familiar feeling of loneliness sounding inside him. It reminded him of the Dursleys, trapped in a small cupboard for years- he shook his head, wanting to forget about it all, including the most recent trauma he had suffered only days ago. Harry felt disgusting and blamed himself for being weak, it was his fault for letting his guard down, his fault that that had happened.
Well isn't this fucking great, having two best friends who dated each other and ate each others faces out in front of you without any shame whatsoever. And him in the same compartment as them, sometimes he wondered why Pansy wanted a horny guy like Blaise as a boyfriend?
"No, I don't want to waste your time Myrtle. It's my problem, I-I have to deal with it myself ... alone…”
"She's the worst and I have a feeling that this year defence won't be easy," Draco snorted and silently glanced at the woman.
"May I ask where is Mr Potter at? I've been searching for him in this morning," she thought she heard "Why always him," from the Weasley youngest son.
Harry jumps a bit. Harry looks up slowly t the giggling voice come from until he says shoes. He slowly and slowly moves looks up and he saw a figure it the dark
The whispers only grew louder, parents hugging their children close as they acted to protect their children from him. He wished some of his friends were still on his side but....he remembered his dream. He could hear that sentence ringing in his head again, reverberating against the bare edges of his mind.
"He killed him as a baby Minerva, I believe he can handle it wonderfully," Albus said again and make Minerva in disbelief
"So Potter loves cocks then," Gordon tilted his head slightly, smirking, and walked in front of Harry, grabbing a handful of his hair. "Let's satisfy him, shall we?" The gang agreed and Harry was automatically horrified. He watched Gordon pull down his zipper and show his disgusting cock in front of him. Harry shied away from Gordon's privates. "What the hell are you doing?!" he screamed, panicked. The gang finally got the reaction they wanted. "Why Potter? Not in the mood? Boys, let's make this bitch feel in the mood."
He felt Malfoy staring at him, Harry peeked up at Malfoy who glanced at his wrist. Harry quickly pulled down his sleeve.
" Potter, you won't know what's coming.But I-" hr stop for a while and grab Harry's collar harshly and whisper "I'm going to make your life miserable like you do mine"
"Huh ... I didn't think Gryffindor could be that stupid, especially that mudblood know-it-all-nonsense," Blaise said jokingly,
He entered the Room of Requirement and the room changed into a small apartment. There was a bedroom, a bathroom, and a small kitchen. For some reason the nice scent permeating the air made him relax a bit.
He only wanted someone ... one was enough to accompany him who believed in him, but that would only happen in his fantasy of living a normal life with family and friends.
The next day the Dursleys finally acknowledged his existence again, and he went back to his daily life with his LOVING FAMILY like always- doing chores, getting starved, being ignored or being used as a punching bag.
"He already had with his relative Minerva, you shouldn't have to worry too much about the boy. I believe he could handle it on his own," Albus answer a bit firm but Minerva was having none of it.
Gardening was Harry's favourite thing to do at the Dursleys. It let him get out of the house, away from anyone else, and cry alone. During this time, Harry let himself relax from the pain he received all day. He constantly pushed down his feelings to ease his days, but it only made his chest hurt and made it harder to breathe. He was always careful with everything he did so that his uncle wouldn't have any more reasons to hurt him.
Before the end of the Hogwarts year, Harry had decided to let Hedwig go free, and he was happy that his lovely owl was finally out of this miserable house and didn't have to suffer with him. But his happy thoughts quickly ended as he recalled his recent dream.
Draco looked around and sure, Granger and Weasley were already gone.  To be honest, he was wondering what Weasley was going to do.  He had the feeling that Weasley was punished it would be fun to look at.  He was again walking around the castle and he planned to go back to the Slytherin dungeons.  He already felt that he had enough to walk the streets of this large place that were secretive
Harry started to be silent and could only stare at his former friend, all the memories they had made suddenly darkened ... it was like burning a beautiful memory photo together and watching him become ashes.
Harry often entertained himself by reading his school books, at least it was something more productive than staring at his ceiling. His reading was suddenly interrupted when his uncle dashed into his room with an angry face. Harry was horrified, trying to think about what Vernon thought he did this time. He hurriedly shoved his books under his bed before his uncle could see them. Vernon grabbed a handful of Harry's hair, dragged him from his mattress, threw him to the cold floor, and punched him in the face.
" They the only family he has, and I think they just being strict at the boy. The Dursley the only safe place for him Minerva and the only family he ever had," Albus explained and it's obvious he doesn't care about the boy well being
The sentence was ringing and echoing in his head. A sudden burst of pain in his chest hurt as if a knife had stabbed him. Harry clenched his fist on his chest to ease the pain but it was useless.
Daphen who sat next to Pansy wiped his tears, "Sorry Pansy, but combining Harry Potter and Slytherin is ridiculous,"
Potter let out a long sigh in response and moved his trunk. Draco sat there with the thought of annoying the boy for the rest of the train ride until he saw a flash of something red on Potter's wrist. Draco looked up at Potter when he pulled his sleeve down.
"What?"  Pansy gape in surprise at Draco "Really?", Draco nodded, Draco had told him what he had seen, he didn't know fully but it tasted quite a lot.
'How... ' his eyes shaking and he keep staring at the figure who looks like him. 'what?' he become even more confuse when the other him standing infront of him and smiling.
"Boy!" Aunt Petunia called Harry from the kitchen, "Yes Aunt Petunia?" Harry answered, trying to keep a low profile to stay out of trouble. "Go weed the front yard now, I'm tired of doing it all day," she complained. Harry nodded, fully aware that she had done no such thing, and walked to the garden.
It's not like he was jealous, it was just disgusting when he always saw those two snogging anywhere and everywhere they could. Draco thought about sitting with Crabbe and Goyle, but he felt as if each year they got dumber and dumber and he couldn’t deal with that shit right now.
They merely chuckled and continued to the castle.  The first day was the same as their previous years, there was a sorting ceremony, Dumbledore's welcoming speech and also the introduction of a new DADA teacher who looked tacky. Everything about her was pink and prim, making people's eyes hurt just by looking at her. Not to mention her annoying sickly sweet and condescending tone.
Okay a think this long enough but hey I hope you guys like it, i am so so sorry took you guys so long :')
"Ron, you know that's not true" Harry tries to change Taller Boy's mind and just hopes a little he believes him.  But in his heart, he knew that it was impossible and made him sad.
He hadn't realised that night had turned into day until he checked his cracked watch and noticed that it was the time for him to go to Platform 9 and 3/4. Harry grabbed his luggage and went to the car because he knew his uncle would be getting impatient. Everything still felt dark and scary for him, ever since- No. He couldn't think about it.
Harry didn't know what would happen next, he just hoped that being at Hogwarts would make it better. His only home. His only hope.
"Just hope she didn't turn this school into hell as it is already is," Blaise howl and leaning to his girlfriend beside him
Seems they already left. Draco knew that the Weasley is up to do something, which seems like an interesting thing to know but it's none of his business so he walks it off and continues to walk wander around the castle.
They must be disappointed with the child they have given birth to.  He could not see his parents angry with him, the pain inside him was already stinging against his chest.
“Who- who are you?” Harry ask in a shaky voice but the other person seems happy. He walk close and closer until his face visible in dark. Harry was stun and confuse.
Harry sat quietly and wept softly trying to calm his sobs.  He waited in the bathroom until the afternoon passed his lunch.  Two hours before dinner he finally returned to the ROR and threw himself on the sofa that had appeared when he entered the room.  It felt empty to be alone, he should have already  used to it form  living with the Dursle.
"No, I didn't! Please, you have to believe me!" Harry pleaded to his two best friends. "Why should we believe you? You hurt us, you killed Percy and Cedric!" Ron growled with a hint of venom in his voice.
“What happened? Did I miss something over the summer?” Draco looked at his friend with shock splayed out across his face.
Harry looked up in slow motion and faced his best friend, no- his former best friend. Ron was hardly a friend now let alone a best friend. Ron's face became more visible but still shadowed and he saw the hateful face in front of him.
She in her way to find some of her Gryffindor students and search for the ginger hair boy and the bushy hair girl in the common room
Minerva hunch a bit and she remember that she hadn't met the Potter boy this morning and also yesterday, "I believe I haven't. I could ask his friends where he is," she answered and the hint of worry in her voice is noticeable.
He looks at the window and the sun seems to shine again, he just realizes that it was a new day. Harry look at the time and he missed breakfast, he doesn’t feel to eat anything anyway. He wonders what he should do today… there’s nothing he can do except stay there hiding from anyone or go out there and faced everyone, repeat last
"Albus, have you look at the boy?! He already tired from the Prophet giving him last year. Just give the boy a break!"
'Hopefully Blaise remembers to use protection,' Draco thought, sighing internally. He searched for a compartment that was empty or mostly empty. As he passed through the train, he could tell that most of them were crowded by the noise level. After a little while of searching he finally found a quiet one.
Harry's body shivered a bit and he bit his lip, just hoping that the person in front of him wouldn't have an adverse reaction.
From the looks of it, if that Weasel and the all-knowing Mudblood weren't aware, he was the only one counting how much he caught Potter fake smiling.
He felt lonely again, he forgot how it felt to be surrounded, like before when Ron and Hermione were always by his side.
Before he manages to cast a spell, Voldemort crucio Harry and leave him screaming in pain. The pain doesn’t stop there, Voldemort cast Crucio over and over again, the pain keeps going and going and going. Harry scream in pain everytime the spell hit him.
"Boy! Who do you think you are?" He growled, his face purple from anger. Harry found himself shaking in fear. "You used your freak power on my son! How dare you!" He kicked the smaller boy repeatedly and with increasing viciousness. Harry curled up and tried to protect his body with his arms, crying for forgiveness.
Harry sobbed, trying to get the pain out and squirming on the bed. But nothing worked. He cried himself to sleep, hoping that it was all just a bad dream.
"The second day at Hogwarts?"  said Blaise as he ate his breakfast, Draco also looked at the Gryffindor table and was snorted and didn't say anything.
Sometimes he wanted to know what Potter was going through, but his attempts sure didn't work. Potter had rejected his friendship in his first year. He still remembered the pain of being rejected by the person he had always waited for and wanted to meet, an unnatural feeling for a slightly spoiled child.
“who am I kidding, I have to get out anyway,” he whispers to himself.  In the end, he got out but using invisibility cloth just in case he ran into Ron and Hermione maybe another students who hated him by now.
Harry was confused, his attention now on his hand. Red liquid dripping slowly, it looks a bit dark and looks exactly like blood. Could it be his blood? Is he bleeding? But why does the blood cover all his arm?
‘Harry! Stop it, you idiot. He’s your headmaster and you should be grateful for what he does for you,’ he thought. However, when he thought about it, Dumbledore hadn’t even let Sirius get a trial as he requested and Dumbledore didn’t listen to Harry when he tried to tell him about the abuse he suffered at the hands of the Dursleys.
“We’re banning you from the tower, Potter. And we know that you’re up to something,” Ron growled. Harry was shocked, “What?! You can’t do that!” he cried.
Of course….who would want to befriend a freak.…a useless freak like him. He thought about the Daily Prophet. He knew that they only used his name for publicity and didn't care about the golden boy's plight.
“Are you serious?  Blaise, you missed a lot. where were you last year?" from his smug face Draco knew what his friend had been up to.
Potter looked ghastly, and as much as Draco hated to admit, he was worried about the golden boy. He wondered just what had happened to the golden boy to cause him to look like this, didn't he have a perfect life? He let go of his thoughts for a second and peaked at the dark haired boy again.
Myrtle tries to talk to Harry but Harry doesn't want to waste her time listening to Harry's troubles.  Myrtle doesn't force Harry to speak and Harry feels a little lucky with that.  Now he was alone again not knowing what to do now but to cry and hate himself again and again.  feeling weak and ruining everyone's expectations, now he doesn't feel that important anymore after everyone thinks he is a murderer and everyone believes his accusation.
"I - I don't know anymore" his voice was hoarse, and Draco immediately thought of leaving. He recognizes the voice that belongs to the golden boy. Didn't want Potter to see him in the same place again.
other than that, nothing interesting happened.  Draco glanced at the teacher's desk and saw the new teacher named Umbrige, whose smile was utter disgust.  Darco immediately felt disgusted and ignored the pink teacher.
It wasn't until hours later when the door slid open did Harry finally wake up from his slumber. He looked at the person who opened the door, everything was still blurry. He blinked rapidly to focus his vision and saw Malfoy stepping into the compartment.
“Percy, what’s going o-“ he stopped speaking when something walking through his body like he was a ghost. He notices the messy black hair and the milky tan skin the person walk through him and pointing a wand at Percy.
Harry froze in place until someone screams their lungs out and he automatically followed by the source of the scream. As he turns around but stopped, before he fully turns around he froze again.
Draco peaked through the window and saw Potter in there. 'Dammit' he thought. He had already searched most of the train and he didn’t want to waste his time looking anymore.
"No, don't!" Harry screamed out, his lungs contracting and his body drenched in sweat and shaking violently. "DON'T!" He cried out again and even louder, desperation making his voice crack.
It was nice to be outside again, to see the blue sky and feel the fresh air in his lungs. It was nice and Harry was having a great day, but he felt tired as he started to weed. Everything was going fine until Dudley and his gang showed up.
In the great hall, he didn’t want to sit close to his "friends", so he sat on the end of the bench farthest away from them and hoped that no one would bother him.
Hey- so yeah I messed up. I'm going to edit this again because there are a bunch of error in the story. I'm sorry if you confuse about it I will try my best fix it
“Blaise and Pansy are snogging, also Crabbe and Goyle are idiots so move it before I kick it off,” He growled. Harry let out a long sigh and moved his trunk to the luggage rack above him as Malfoy sat on the seat across.
He accidentally bumped into someone. “I-I’m sorry, I didn’t look where I was going,” he immediately apologized.
“What are you waiting for? Get out!” Finnegan screamed, making Harry shiver from the shout. He looked at all the people behind Ron, Hermione was completely silent but she didn’t take any action, Harry assumed her to be on Ron's side. Neville just looked at him in sympathy.
Harry always managed to sleep three to four hours, and if he was lucky he might get five hours of sleep if he didn't have any nightmares. He leaned his back against the window and put his legs up on the seat, trying to get at least some rest. For once, he had a dreamless sleep.
"I didn't do anything!" Harry cried. A hefty punch in his stomach made him cough blood out of his mouth. "LIAR!" Growled Vernon.
“Oh, Harry. You are silly, never thought I will call my self a silly bloke,” the other Harry laugh again and it keep terrified Harry.
“Merlin, Blaise.  Hold your hormones for once will you,” Blaise merely smirked and Pansy giggled with a slight shade of red painted on her pale face.
"But to be honest, I see that during this year, Potter has a Slytherin flavor too." Pansy turned the subject back to Golden Boy.  The other Slytherins except Draco laughed at Pansy and it was upsetting Pasy so badly,
"I heard that this year we have a new DADA teacher. Somehow I feel that this year won't be fun," said Pansy, Draco's attention turning back to his best friend.
“Need something?” he asked dryly, Draco could tell he was hiding something but he knew he wouldn't get any further. Instead he responded, “Why would I need something from people like you?” He could've sworn that he saw Potter flinch a bit.
"Ignoring us Potty? How rude," Dennis said with a playful tone. Harry didn't answer that and continued with his work. The gang tried to get a reaction from Harry, but they got none because Harry didn't want to give them the satisfaction. The gang, getting bored quickly, started to get physical. They surrounded Harry and Dudley gave him a sudden blow punch on the jaw. They continued to rain blows upon him until they suddenly stopped. Glancing up, Harry saw Dudley exchange smirks with the gang. They roughly pushed him down the street to an alleyway nearby. Then grabbing Harry's hands, Dennis forced him to kneel with his arms behind his back.
Harry stunned when he hears the manic laughter from behind him, the laughter gives him chills everywhere on his body. He recognizes the voice. The voice he always hated. The voice who ruins his life.
He watch himself casting a spell, he barely heard it. His cheek drenches wet from tears and terror in his eyes.
Potter was pale like he was dying, and his skin had a blue tint to it that highlighted the dark circles under his eyes. He was skinny and the oversized shirt he was wearing clung to his form, making him look even skinnier. 'Potter really does look awful,' Draco thought to himself, frowning slightly.
Harry heard someone calling him from behind, he knew it was the voice that someone who was usually close to him had,
"I heard that they were separated because Weasel's brother died and blamed Potter. The funniest thing is that they think Potter is a follower of the dark lord," Pansy replied, snorting.
Time was already heading to dinner, Blaise Pansy and Draco walked together to the great hall, Draco glanced over to the Gryffindor table to see Weasel and Mudblood discussing something with the youngest Weasley.  It was also unusual for Potter not to be there, Draco was looking for a certain owner of messy black hair with emerald eyes, after a few seconds of searching for him not there ... this morning was also not there now why is he not there.
A knife wasn’t his first choice. He didn’t wish to accidentally stab himself. Malfoy would create a song and dance about it.
Draco circled the trembling fingers around his arm in a rather weak grip, whispering a variation of profanities. In conclusion, the swearing wouldn’t cease. Fantastic. “
“Aren’t you supposed to be braiding your hair or wasting ten canisters of hair gel on it or whatever? I’m quite surprised you didn’t trap yourself in your bedroom/tower.”
Plus, the glamour he had cast on it was sort of remarkable, considering he had no previous experiences with glamour charms. Only an adept wizard could figure it out.
“A Patronus is conjured from a strong memory, filled with emotion. You need to find one a content memory, and concentrate on it, then say, Expecto Patronum."
He fished out the pocket-watch which was warm against his palm. It had caused the nightmare. A nightmare based on one of the worst moments of his life. The moment Sirius had fallen through the veil.
It wasn’t fun when Potter was agreeing with him. He might’ve reacted on a creative choice of words, which were yet to surface in his mind. “Can I practice a complex charm instead of a simpler one?”
With a relented sigh, he carefully walked to the bedroom door, and glanced around with a frown. Malfoy wasn’t in the room. “Er – Malfoy?”
“Who gifted Holding the man to you?” He asked with a frown, flipping to the first page and back to the one he was reading. “I assume – no, I’m certain it was a gift.”
It was about fairy-tales and fantasies. A land with faith, trust and pixie dust. A sky where falling stars live instead of burning out. A side with a soft fucking epilogue.
It was a light-hearted, carefree conversation. Quips, instead of venomous retorts. He wanted it to continue, that's a first. “Draco, you wouldn’t Obliviate your friend now, would you?”
Outside the window, a storm steadily crept closer. The beams of light break through the sky again, followed by a crash. Harry was startled, yet unfazed by the thunder. He wasn't afraid of storms.
"One day," Draco whispered against his ear, in a soft voice laced with a promise. "I want our fantasies to be real, and I know that it'll be worth the wait. You will be worth the wait, Harry."
Harry growled, and a punch landed on Malfoy’s jaw. Another. He couldn’t focus. He wanted to scream, and get away from Malfoy. He stumbled back, his chest heaving. “You deserved that, Malfoy”
Harry maintained a soft voice, despite the accusation in the argument because he didn’t want to witness the flicker of hurt on Malfoy’s face or experience the guilt again.
It was a fact. Draco traded insults with him thrice within an hour and the choice of words for the ‘
Draco placed the wand in the cloak while he muttered a colorful variation of profanities, pointedly avoiding the brunet’s gaze. “You – weren’t you focusing on the one with Narcissa – Of when you were eleven?”
“I won’t touch it.” Draco said, and half-turned to the door with the frown. He had an odd feeling about the said artifact. “You want the watch?”
With a nod, he pointed the wand in the front – Narcissa reading at night in a calm voice, the soft hums – walking to the lake in the evening when he was in London with her. “
He couldn’t react to it – was rooted to the spot – fingers trembling at his side and brushing over the warm, pulsating artifact. A small part of him was concerned that Malfoy would come up with a sardonic comment and it would cause a fight, considering the unfolding of recent events, when it was a family-related topic.
“Fuck,” Malfoy whispered, and realization dawned on him. “You haven’t eaten since – fuck – Four days.”
“Oh, it wasn’t the intention and you –” The scowl on Malfoy’s face was replaced with a confused frown, word trailing, the mouth caught open in a soft vowel sound. “wait–your first friend in eleven years?”
The closeness was sort of overwhelming. He wasn't touched often. Or embraced. He had never been the recipient of a soft, warm touch or of an intimacy and it caused the flicker of panic in him.
“Can you shift, Malfoy?” He whispered, shoving his shoulder against Draco’s, fingers searching for the small branch. “I can’t – ouch – fucking twat.”
Otryazan was a severed island. Quite fucking literally severed. He wasn’t sure if he appreciated the fact that the name of the Island was so straight-forward.
No, it wasn't. It was a fucking nightmare to be turned into a ferret while the others watched with amusement.
He closed his eyes, as the violet and black blended in his mind, creating a chaotic sky, alive with raw energy and dim stars. Yes, the sky had infinite stars. Only, the stars weren’t bright.
He decided to spare Steve the shell, and headed into the house again. He wasn’t intent on another fight-fest with Malfoy. It was the only reason he had wandered to the shore, and practiced wandless magic. Yet, he couldn't remain outside forever.
“I wouldn’t want you to –” He paused mid-sentence when Draco’s fingers circled around the artifact with an odd glint in the eyes. “Draco,” It was a warning tone. “Put it on the counter.”
“Why a few years?” Harry said in confusion with a short, uncertain laugh. He couldn’t grasp the connotation in Draco’s words and said, “I won’t be in Otryazan for a year now, will I?”
A realization dawned on him when he repeated it in his head. He had fucking implied he was focused on Harry Potter in the Yule Ball, fourth year. "Isn't your proudest moment to admit you were staring at the Chosen One in the yule ball, is it?"
The warmth was reducing, and the artifact rested lightly in his pocket – Almost as if it wasn’t there – And the rage subsided slowly.
“Yeah, well, it’s easy for you,” Draco had a tremble to the voice yet he maintained a bored-mien on the face, oblivious to the fact that he had a tint of pink of the pale cheeks. “is the stance
A quip, instead of a clear-cut response. Or it was the only way it worked out – subtle responses to a serious question – and it was fine.
“The third of December, 1996.” He whispered, as he went closer to the slender figure. “We wished on the falling stars, in the middle of the Quidditch pitch. I kissed you under the light of a thousand falling stars.”
Malfoy laughed, and the flutter returned. He detested it. He detested Malfoy’s laugh or the smirk on his idiotic barbie face. Or the way he brushed the strand of hair out of his fucking face.
“You produced a corporeal Patronus without a wand, when you can’t even perform a simple levitation charm without a sporadic outcome, wearing yourself out in the process and you still didn’t recover.”
“Eleven?” Malfoy whispered in a small voice, staring at him incredulously. “You didn’t have any idea of the wizarding world until you were eleven?”
The pause returned, lingering in the air for a brief minute. He wanted to clear his head. The troubling nightmare was imprinted in the mind and he had to force it out or he would return in a never-ending circle of remorse.
He didn’t even want to think about the ferret situation in the fourth year. It was still a sour topic, and sort of irritating. The brunet was clearly amused. Waiting for a reaction. “No headstone.”
The glint in Potter’s eyes was downright revolting. If conjuring a Patronus hadn’t worn him out, he would’ve hexed the brunet. Or he would’ve come up with creative insults. “I can’t tolerate your sarcasm. Not now.”
“Oh, for heaven’s sake,” The variation of French curses the blond whispered with it were incomprehensible and he figured it was wiser to ignore it. “you’re not my favourite Gryffindor.”
The sky had intrigued him. In that moment, Draco Malfoy wanted a glimpse into the mind of Harry Potter. One glimpse. Into a mind that held a beautiful night sky. A sky of infinity and starlight.
And as he started preparing supper, determined to continue the plan – Draco Malfoy walked out of the bedroom with an all-too familiar smirk on his face.
The silence returned, yet it was a comfortable one. He couldn’t find the right thing to say – words had evaporated out of his mind – what could one say when their arch-nemesis shares one of their most treasured and happiest memories of when they were eleven with them?
The panic surged within, an unsettling feeling coursing through his nerves and he exhaled in an uneven manner. Of course, he didn’t care about Harry Potter. He couldn’t. Yet, if he didn’t care – why was he concerned about Potter’s well-being? Draco couldn’t soften up on him. Not now. It would cause trouble.
In an hour, he opened the door slightly and glanced at the living room. Potter wasn’t breaking any more teacups. Or walking around.
He had to find out if Ron and Hermione were safe and if they were continuing with the horcrux hunt. He wished they weren’t. He wanted to believe that they were in a safe place. Wanted to believe they weren’t continuing with the hunt without him. It would be unbearable to stand the pain, if he lost them in the war.
. He hadn’t intended to offend him. It was only a quip. “Not the couch, Potter. Read or rest if you want to – on the bed.”
Malfoy’s voice was calm, clear yet strict in a sense while he briefed the brunet about the theoretical part of it and for once, he was focused and intent on listening to the blond. “Wait a second – spontaneous?”
“A warning,” He murmured with a slight quiver, lifting a brow, voice laced with sarcasm, which was one of the
Over the course of five weeks, the mutual resentment had reduced. He was comfortable with Draco’s presence who was sort of sufferable – minus the french curses.
“Would you rather prefer ‘temporary acquaintance’, Malfoy? I still can’t stand you, and you can’t stand me either. I will find a way out of Otryazan because I don’t want to be around you and –
“Oh, I was with Ron and Hermione, on my way to defeat Voldemort, until your precious father sent me here and now, I’m on a severed Island with the one person I don’t want to be with – so no, I haven’t forgotten, Malfoy.”
“Oh, well – why don’t you start with levitating the seashell – the basics, considering you can’t perform a proper spell without a wand, Potter?” Malfoy countered with a smirk. “You can swear, I can come up with retorts.”
“I prefer fairly-tales.” He chuckled, and inched a little bit closer to him. Only a little. “A bit of angst, and a little bit of an adventure, yet it turns out well in the end.”
“Pity,” He said with an air of drama, as he nicked a paperback novel from the bedside table, wrinkling his nose as he skimmed through the pages. “I wanted you to shut up.”
He let his mind wander, and it drifted to various memories. Memories at Hogwarts. At the Manor. The dark ones. The beautiful ones. And the most recent ones.
On one corner of the bedroom was a canvas easel, and a canvas was placed on it with a wide array of colours and brushes with a palette on the table beside it.
He turned his gaze to the canvas, searching for the tiniest bit of resemblance. A resemblance of the sky with Potter. And he didn’t find one. Or perhaps he didn’t know Potter.
The pocket-watch was resting on the novel, pulsating with an odd sort of induced magic. A shiver trickled down his spine and he exhaled unevenly. It was emitting a rather familiar feeling – as if he had been in the presence of the artifact at the manor. Yet, he couldn’t recall a pocket-watch.
“You’ve ruined me, father.” He said softly, a weak smile on his face. He didn’t want to be dragged into a war that wasn’t his problem. He never wanted to choose sides. “I never wanted to be a part of a war. I wanted to be safe. You were supposed to keep me safe.”
He decided to rest, instead of letting his thoughts overwhelm him. And he did, until Potter shattered two teacups. Or more.
They continued to walk in content silence, taking in the Christmas lights that had been scattered around the city, adding an aura of happiness along with them. They had warm coffees in their hands, as they made their way through the crowd.
“Oh you had to remind me, didn’t you?” If he intended for it to sound sarcastic, it didn’t because his voice had a strained edge to it. The after-effects of performing a spell in Otryazan was taxing. “I – erm – we should head in.”
Harry covered it with his fingers. He could feel the warmth underneath the fingertips. It was pulsating. Almost similar to a second heartbeat. “I warned you not to touch it.”
In an hour, he was piling two plates with scrambled eggs, sausage, baked beans, potatoes and he cast a warming charm on one of the plates. Malfoy wouldn’t deign to touch the plate. Or maybe he would. Harry couldn’t decide.
“I want you to tell me what we wished for on the falling stars,” He said, interlacing their fingers together and peering into the familiar grey eyes. Beautiful grey eyes. “Or I want to wish on the stars once again, if you will.”
“Yes, Potter.” Malfoy said archly and directed an irritated glare at him. “Believe it or not, I did not spend my childhood attending tea parties.”
Malfoy gave him a nod, but he wasn’t smirking anymore. “It’s pitch black. My sky doesn’t have a star. It’s bigger. It’s quiet, and it’s empty.”
Draco pointed his wand at the book, casting a simple levitation charm and directing it into the bedroom and frowned when the watch started to create a resistance, weighing the paperback down.
He, however, wasn’t certain if he could the six years of constant enmity. Or, perhaps, he couldn’t forgive Draco for what he had said to Ron and Hermione. Or the others. A small, small part of him wanted to offer a chance to Draco. One chance.
The cleaning charm was easier. He practiced it a lot often. And he had perfected the vanishing charm at breakfast. Only after a half-vanished toast, and a sort of vanished apple was he able to perfect it.
The lens mended itself, and he exhaled softly. He rested the back of his head against the nearest tree. He was exhausted, and he could barely resist his urge to scream.
"Of course you can, sweetheart,” Pansy said as she rose from her chair, placing a small kiss on Draco's cheek. "couldn't resist, could you, Potter?"
He wasn’t sure he wanted to. Not after he had painted the night sky on the canvas. And it was beautiful. A fine piece of art. It was beautiful in the chaos. A chaos – Infinite and eternal.
A serious conversation with Draco Malfoy was an ongoing nightmare, yet for once, it was one the brunet wanted to continue, without censoring it. “You could’ve –
“It’s not screwed up,” He said with a slow exhale, forcing the relentless thoughts out of his mind and focusing on the brunet with a scowl on his face. “and we’re on first-name basis now?”
And so he did – He recited the story of Rapunzel while they baked cookies – The soft laugh that escaped Malfoy’s lips was worth it.
“Not the idea I had in mind,” He said with a small grin, yet it only lasted for a brief minute until the brunet winced and the grin turned into a grimace as he forced out, “but it’ll work.”
Draco’s eyes tailed Potter’s line of sight, who was watching the sky in a trance with a fond glint, eyes transfixed on the full-moon. “You’re fond of the night-sky, aren’t you?”
“Oh, shut up.” Malfoy said, flipping the crepe with an irritated sigh. “You’re not smart. Or wonderful.”
“It’s quiet,” Draco whispered with a sigh, fingers outstretched to the sky, fingers tracing the pitch-black night sky, around in a sort of backward question mark with a small triangle. Leo. “Isn’t it?”
“Out of pity?” Harry scoffed, clenching his own fist to the side. “I don’t pity you, Malfoy. You have the right to know about the words your father said before sending me here.”
Harry cursed under his breath, carding fingers through his jet-black hair in frustration. He wanted to nudge him awake, or push him off but he didn’t. He couldn’t.
Harry clasped the right hand into his and couldn’t resist a small quip: “I’m Potter. Harry Potter.” Draco’s chuckle was light, laced with a soft him of amusement, which caused a small, familiar flutter in the brunet’s chest. “think my name is funny, do you?”
He clenched his fists to his side, his knuckles turning white, but he couldn’t get it under control. He inched closer to Malfoy, and they were nose to nose.
“Oh, can you quit it, Potter?” He said in a strained voice, the words laced with venom, yet in the current situation, it wasn’t holding the intended effect, which seemed to infuriate Draco further. “you fucking prat –”
Harry couldn’t figure out how to refute it. Instead, he watched while Draco strode out of the room and to the kitchen. He had screwed up but for once, he couldn’t find it within him to fight with the prat.
He raised his eyes uncertainly, and they were met by worried emerald green ones. He was kneeling down before Draco, a hesitant hand on his shoulder. “I don’t know, Malfoy. I only saw your father.”
“I do,” Malfoy said with a hint of fondness to his voice. A fondness of fairy-tales. A fondness of happy endings and it was kind of – beautiful. “I really do.”
“Mhm, sure.” The brunet said, oblivious to the fact that Draco Malfoy had cast a wandless warming charm over them in a rather subtle manner. After all,
“And to find out about the wizarding world at eleven was insanely absurd, I didn’t complain about the existence of wizards. You shouldn’t complain about the existence of hair induced with magic.”
“Are we surprised? You flipped a crepe in a perfect manner. You’re Draco Malfoy, need I say more?” Harry said with a soft chuckle as he carded his fingers through his unruly hair. “It’s self-explanatory.”
He scribbled on the back of the parchment after lunch, placing it inside the now-fixed cup and casting a cleaning charm on the plate.
“Christ, you’re not on the front cover of Vogue.” He paused with a soft sigh. A confused frown was etched on Draco’s face. “It’s a fashion –” The trouble wasn’t worth it. “Never mind.”
“I’m not,” Malfoy said, as he narrowed his eyes at him. Right on cue. “The slice of lemon on the side of the cup, and the perfect mix of hot and sweet – How did you know?”
A soft gasp escaped him when the blond stumbled over. Instinctually, he pitched forward, slinging an arm around Draco’s waist in a swift reflex – perhaps it was the five years of playing Quidditch coming in handy  – and a scent of sandalwood with hints of citrus washed over him. “Malfoy, what –”
He cleared his throat as he waited for a brief second, and half-turned to return to the couch, when he heard a soft whisper of: “I’m on the roof, Potter.”
“I was – er – The chocolate chip cookies are done, and I placed them aside to let them cool off. If you’re quite satisfied with your atrocious hair –
The silence was comfortable, yet he had the stirring guilt in his chest. Out of all the things he had in mind, feeling guilty for the harsh words he had uttered wasn't one of them. Not if he had 'uttered' the hurtful words to Draco Lucius Malfoy.
He felt rooted to the spot. His legs felt odd—heavy and stiff—weighing him down. The words were underlined with a glare, as though daring Harry to argue.
The plan – The one he had devised with Ron and Hermione – had headed south, and he was sent to a fucking Island, but it hadn’t failed. Not entirely.
He desperately wanted to get out of Otryazan. And he didn’t have a wand to enhance his magic. To make it easier. Practicing wandless magic was insanely tiring.
The brunet stared at him, almost as if he was calculating. Thinking. “On the top of the novel, is a pocket-watch. It’s an ancient artifact, don't -
The corner of his lip twitched and curled into a soft smile. The wisps of silver circled, and turned into a beautiful white stag. A familiar comfort washed over him. He was safe.
He turned, glancing over at a dishevelled Malfoy. Instead of the narrowed eyes, or disgruntled look he had come to expect from the blond, there was a softening of facial features and an almost smile directed at the him.
“I’m half-way through it.” He said, dismissing the relentless thoughts in his mind. He didn’t want to think about it. He couldn’t. If he started to count the faded stars, the sky would be a little darker. “No spoilers.”
He was angling for a quip – for the familiar comfort of antagonism – but it seemed to have infuriated Draco. Perhaps it was rather daft to push it with Draco Malfoy, but the sincere words had caused a surge of panic within him.
For about two minutes, the blond stared at him in a calculative manner. “I’m not revealing even a bit of it to you, unless it’s reciprocated – Not even a bit.”
“Perhaps.” He said in a small voice. “Yet, I still care about the lives of the ones around me, and it’s the difference between us. You’re driven by self-preservation, and I’m not.”
“I was sixteen and fucking scared, Potter.” Draco said in a spur of moment, and his eyes widened as realization dawned on him. He cursed under his breath and grimaced. “You wouldn’t know shit about it, would you?”
Draco’s brows knitted together, “Right, of course, why wouldn’t you, the precious chosen one, our dear saviour, care?” He said with a scoff and underlined the words with a cold stare, while he continued to tap his fingers on the kitchen counter. “I’m sorry, it was rather presumptuous to assume otherwise.”
Harry let out a chuckle, holding out his hand again to help him up, Draco grabbed it and stood up on his shaky legs.  Harry gave him a devious grin. “Now that you have to rely on me entirely – Shall we?”
” He whispered with a soft brush of fingertips. A brief touch. It caused a familiar flutter in his chest. A flutter that wouldn’t cease. “I want –” He paused. “wanted to be your
He sighed softly. Hunting the horcruxes was important. It was the only way to defeat Voldemort. The only way to survive and to save the wizarding world. He owed it to the ones who had lost their lives in the war.
A silence engulfed them, and he exhaled slowly and felt an odd constriction in his chest. He wanted to refute the untrue assumption. He wasn’t perfect, yet he couldn’t resist a quip.
He muttered a repairing charm, focusing on the core of his magic and it started to mend itself back together.
“If you behave, I’ll decide not to be Rapunzel for a while. And you won’t have to place notes to lure me out.”
Malfoy grimaced, and pain flickered across his face – And Harry wished he wouldn’t have said that last bit – The flash of hurt faded within a second and it was replaced by the familiar cold mask. “And you trust your instincts? Your Godfather died because you ‘trusted’ your instincts.”
Perhaps, Potter couldn’t figure out a way to argue with that because instead of a snide remark, the corner of his lip twitched and curled into a wide grin. “well, I can’t oppose to that.”
“Or a genie, which can fulfil our wishes.” He was certainly amused with the confusion with a hint of curiosity flicker across Malfoy’s face and he couldn’t resist a smile. “Aladdin had a flying carpet with a genie.”
Draco gave him a weak smile, and a slight shake to the head. He would’ve left Potter to stew in his own misery, because Draco Malfoy didn’t care about Harry Potter. Draco Malfoy didn’t invite the others in, to heal them. He didn’t care. He never wanted to care. Not even about Harry Potter. “You can’t stay out here, Potter.”
He frowned as he felt an intrusion in his head. An unwelcome presence, and he didn’t want to be vulnerable. He inhaled sharply, as he pushed it out of his head.
Draco’s mouth was caught open. Eyes wide. He exhaled a small puff of air. It was minty. The cut closed. “w-what?”
“I prefer the balanced ones,” He said in a soft voice. “A bit of angst, and a bit of content. It shouldn’t necessarily be a perfect ending. It can be sad, and it would still be beautiful.”
In retrospect, it probably wasn’t a wise idea to continue without censoring the conversation. In fact, it was a nonsensical idea, which was Harry's area of expertise. “Yes, my first friend in eleven years.”
Harry nodded. He had almost demolished the Headmaster’s office. He had zero regrets. In that moment, he saw a gleam in Malfoy’s eyes. Admiration. Awe. Only for one moment.
Draco narrowed his eyes, his demeanor immediately stiffening with both curiosity and suspicion. He wasn’t even supposed to know.
“Harry,” Draco said softly, and the brunet jerked his head in disbelief at the use of his first name, “My father – Did he say anything to you?”
It was barely a whisper. He wasn’t intending to say it out loud. Malfoy went awfully still, and he turned his gaze from the sea towards him. “No, I didn't, Potter."
The corner of his lip twitched, and curled into a satisfied smirk. He wasn’t supposed to laugh with Malfoy, but it was oddly comforting. Almost surreal. He stared at Malfoy, and all he could see was a boy broken by months of tragedy and pain, forced to be on the wrong side of the war.
His voice trailed, as he saw a flicker of hurt cross Malfoy’s face. Only for a second. “You should go have the quick shower, Potter.”
“Pfft. Can you imagine?” Draco said, with an ironic drawl. He could’ve never been a Hufflepuff. He wasn’t raised to be one. “father would’ve –
Not that living in Otryazan wasn’t a ‘break’. It wasn’t pleasant, but it was a break. He wasn’t camping and hunting horcruxes. Or on the run.
He caressed the warm sand with his fingertips, waiting for a brief minute. The soft sound of waves crashing on the shore was sort of vague. The sky was overcast with clouds. He wasn’t fond of a sky without stars.
They were both panting heavily, the adrenaline still raging in their blood circulation but with a hint of something more that made them both still. The laughter died down slowly as he found himself staring at the grey eyes. A second longer. Another.
Draco doubled over; the left hand clutched into the soft fabric of the sweater and a soft laugh flying out of him, a faint crinkle on the corners of the eyes. “You’re a moronic –”
not to touch it,” The trace of malice was clear in the voice with a note of impatience. He was, however, forcing a stoic, calm mien on the face. “yet, you touched it on purpose –”
A soft, slow music drifted in the air and the light of the enchanted ceiling cascaded a silver, beautiful glow on the room. It was a faint luminesce of the night sky. The sight of the stars - of the constellations - was, in fact, a wonder to behold.
“In the manor,” He said carefully, as his mind traced back to the pained screams and the endless hallways of the Malfoy manor. He forced it out of his mind. “Lucius – He whispered two words, as the darkness engulfed me.”
Draco scowled, tilting his head to the side and staring at the waves and exhaled slowly. Fantastic. The glamour had worn-off – He wasn’t fond of the eye – The left iris was the lightest shade of blue, and he had concealed it since he was eleven. “It’s defined as Heterochromia, Potter.”
Draco’s mind traced to his mother. He wondered if she was still coping with it. Or if she had given up. Salazar, he wished he could understand Lucius Malfoy.
’ face on, which is the case ninety-nine percent of the time.” The brunet said with a short laugh. “white isn’t your colour, if you’re angling for it.”
He wasn’t prepared for a stab of pain in the chest. It shouldn’t affect him. Yet, it did. He maintained the usual cold demeanor. An instinct of pure, Slytherin self-preservation. “No, he can’t –”
In the evening, Malfoy opened the door to prepare tea. He lifted his gaze from the novel, and watched the blond with an arched eyebrow. “Will you prepare a cuppa for me?”
He drew Draco closer and for a few seconds, he couldn’t find the words while he swayed to the music in a slow pace. “Oh, it is?”
Malfoy snorted, and gave a slight shake to his head. “To what do I owe the – What is the opposite of pleasure?”
“Sort of,” Harry mumbled, fishing out the pocket watch and placing it on the kitchen counter, on top of the novel. He hadn’t finished it yet. “you want a cup of tea?”
Draco focused on the stance – shoulders back with the right ankle turned outward – stretching the arm at the right angle and pointed the wand in the front. “In the ongoing episode, Draco Malfoy has the perfect stance.”
In the morning, he didn’t leave a note with the crepes at breakfast. Yes, crepes. Because Malfoy would specifically expect a sardonic note with crepes. And he hadn’t written one.
“But we’re not friends either, are we?” Draco had an unsure, wobbly voice. Sort of impatient. He shifted in place, arching a pale eyebrow.  “are we, Potter?”
It was kind of unbelievable. Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy in a bit of a banter which didn't involve insensitive retorts and didn't turn into a fight. It could be a fucking headline.
“Harry.” He said, the desperation in his voice growing. He wanted to be called by those names. Not ‘Draco’ or ‘Malfoy’. Fuck. He’d have even take ‘sweet cheeks’ right then.
A teacup shattered, and the sound reverberated in the house. He barely resisted the urge to slightly open the door and watch Potter as he tortured a poor teacup. And curse in French, in the process.
A deep growl escaped his mouth. Without a thought, he punched Potter. Over and over again. He didn’t fight back, only winced in pain. Draco wrestled him to the ground, his chest heaving with pain and rage. It pressed against Potter’s as they tumbled across the sand, and punched him in the jaw once more. “WHY AREN’T YOU FIGHTING BACK, POTTER?”
"Yes," Draco said with a small smirk, and his mind traced back to the train in the sixth year. "It's a rare privilege to break the Chosen One's nose, isn't it?"
"Don't you worry, Potter." He smiled, rightening Harry gently so they could continue dancing. "I didn't bring you out here to hurt you.”
He wanted to relax his mind. The thoughts in his mind were overwhelming, and he had to sort them out. And the one way to sort his thoughts, was to paint. He had an unspoken penchant for art. He has a little bit more to him than he let on. Painting was calming. It was a source of escape.
He could walk out of the house, towards the shore and argue with Potter. Despite the white-hot rage in him, he didn’t. He couldn’t risk another argument. Not after the last one.
“Wicked witch of the west – You didn’t – You’re referring to The Dark Lord as the wicked witch of the west?”
And he practiced near the seashore for a while, torturing Steve the seashell. It was bad enough that the poor seashell didn’t have wings. Harry was targeting its insecurities over the inability to fly. It went: “Oh, hi! You don’t have wings and you never will. I’ll levitate you for a while for selfish reasons and once I’m finished, you’ll go back to existing as Steve – The seashell without wings.”
It was bothering him, and he was morose at work. He hadn’t said anything to offend Harry, had he? He wanted to be called by the sappiest names – He fucking missed them. A lot.
“I figured.” He said, starting to walk to the seashore with a slow pace. “Perhaps, I should cast a silencio on you.”
Another mystery to solve. It was awfully cryptic, and he had never been the one to solve riddles. The wings of the snitch opened, and he let it hover mid-air.
“Quit with the comments,” Draco said with a note of impatience, “and explain why we’re on first-name basis.”
Potter nodded, and turned to leave. Draco caught his elbow without thinking, tightening his grip and inched even closer. Potter froze, his eyes wide and pupils dilating. He cleared his throat, and half-turned. He jerked his arm out of the grip, and Draco reeled a couple steps back. “You can’t – I – Was?”
hunting any horcruxes or chasing any new leads. He didn’t want them to deal with the fucking horcruxes while he was in modern-day Neverland.
Malfoy raised his eyes and arched an eyebrow at him with a scowl. “Yes, Potter. While you were resting, I had to prepare lunch and considering I won’t burn the crepes –
He wanted to amuse himself with another small argument. To have the satisfaction of winning. To gloss over a small victory over his arch nemesis.
“Perhaps that was not the perfect choice of words.” He winced, mouth simpering, the eyes wavering with uncertainty while his fingers flexed around the base of the cup. “Draco, I’m –” Potter inched closer. “I’m sorry.”
A brief flicker of rage flared in him as the words settled in. He couldn’t – wouldn’t – stop searching for a way out. “Oh, only because you’ve quit trying –
He raced to the further end of the dining room, firing blindly at the death eaters shooting red jets at him. He had to find a way out of the Malfoy Manor.
“You still fucking despise me, don’t you?” He whispered slowly, and cursed – coherent and sensible weren’t the same. The brunet had ducked his head and he had closed his eyes. “You fucking can’t –
Draco straightened the white sweater and his fingers curled into it, perhaps for the warmth, while he shifted in place, forcing a neutral guise on the face which could’ve fooled the brunet if not for the trace of impatience in Draco’s voice while he said, “If you want to continue staring while you search your deficient vocabulary for the perfect words in order to continue, you –”
The mere thought of the D.A caused a warmth to course within. It was a small act of rebellion. It was a brilliant ‘
as he draped the warm cloak over his shoulder. The moonlight was dancing off his hair. It was unruly and wild in its short-but-not-too-short style. The stands were falling over his forehead.
When he moved away, Malfoy cast again. The wisps curled out of the wand, and it was a bit brighter than before, hovering in the air for much longer. It was a start.
He wanted to refute with a similar, venomous tone. Yet, he didn’t. The cold, detached mask the blond had forced on a while ago had started to wear off. Draco had a slight quiver in his voice, a tinge of red on the face, shoulders tense. “Oh
Draco didn’t laugh. He didn’t comment on it. It was familiar to him – To be scared of your own dreams. To wake up in cold sweat, with a scream caught in your throat and being frightened of your mind as it weaves a nightmare as an aftermath of the demons you’ve faced. Of the mistakes you’ve made.
“Yesterday,” Malfoy whispered uncertainly, as he stared at him. “You didn’t fight back, because you’ve been there – In my place – You lost a father figure, didn’t you?”
Draco turned the head to the side – Perhaps, not a wise decision – it caused his heart to stutter. The faint light of the moon was falling on the tan skin, a soft silver radiance highlighting the delicate features of Potter’s face.
He closed his eyes, and focused on the spell. Yet, the content was replaced with sorrow. He couldn’t be with Sirius. He couldn’t have a home.
He was away from the war he never wanted to be a part of. But he was away from home. And if he could go back, he wasn’t sure if he would belong there.
He wanted to ignore Malfoy’s curious, piercing stare and forget about the fucking artifact. Preferably for a few hours. He couldn’t entertain a conversation about it. He wanted to force
“Draco,” he said in the softest voice. A confused frown creased the forehead and the brunet shuffled closer on the bed towards Draco with a nervous, uncertain sigh. “Of course, I care.” A pause. “why wouldn’t I?”
If he could find a way out, he would continue the hunt alone. He didn’t want any further casualties in the war. It was the chaos he had to deal with on his own and he didn’t want to have to rely on the others.
He didn’t write the last bit. He had hinted at it subtly. If Potter broke a few more teacups, and ruined the kitchen slightly, he’d be forced to come out of the bedroom. Not that he wanted to. He wasn’t ready to forgive Potter. Not yet. And he didn’t suppose that Potter was ready to forgive him.
Malfoy arched an eyebrow in surprise but he didn’t comment. He didn’t even want to live through that again. He couldn’t get the screams of pain out of his head. Hermione’s screams of pain.
“He did,” Potter chuckled sort of sinisterly, as he half-turned to leave. He directed an intimidating glare at Draco, and he laced his voice with venom as he said, “If he didn’t – I wouldn’t fucking be with you.”
The blond directed yet another warning glare and he couldn’t resist a short, amused laugh. It sounded more like a bark, really. “If I nicely ask you to dial it down a notch, will you?”
“I – er – Got you a few clothes.” Malfoy said, staring fixedly at the floor and cleared his throat. “And – erm, you can put them in the wardrobe. It has plenty of space.”
Malfoy cocked his head to the side with a thoughtful hum. He walked to the stove, taking the pan from him with a smirk. Harry watched as Malfoy pulled his lips in a thin line.
He was desperate to perfect it. Instead of waiting around, he wanted to overpower the Island and find a fucking way out. Plus, he didn’t want to be vulnerable, considering he didn’t have a wand.
“No, you were clear when you said you won’t clue me in on the artefact and your words of choice in our small row were convincing,” Draco was, however, indeed still curious about the artefact. He wasn't going to succumb to his curiosity driven urge to prod though, not after what went down the last time he did. “Insensitive, yet convincing.”
“Fuck you,” He had to resist the urge to hex Malfoy's mouth shut. In fact, he had no patience for Draco's antics or his incessant rants. “It’s
Lucius was staring, brows furrowed but resigned all the same. “I’m not going to turn you over to the Dark Lord, Potter.”
a skin care routine?” He repeated with a short contemplative stare. Of course, Draco had a routine for self-care. “I’ll interview you on it if I start a career in journalism, Malfoy.”
Malfoy stared at him. A second longer than required. And Harry was only wearing the sweater and boxer briefs. Another awkward silence ensued and he couldn’t resist a quip: “Hey Flynn, are you escaping the royal guards? Because you’re in Rapunzel’s tower.”
“I was in pain – And I didn’t know if I could deal with the loss of my Godfather. And that pain turned into rage. I wanted to inflict insurmountable pain on Bellatrix. Torture her. Kill her – I wanted revenge.”
“I was,” He said carding his fingers through his hair, as he forced it out of his head. “I saw you. You didn’t want to do it. You couldn’t kill a man – So, Snape did it instead.”
“Draco,” It was a soft whisper and with a confused frown etched on the face, the brunet clinked the back of the index finger on Draco’s. “what are you on about?”
Malfoy’s face turned into a painful grimace for a brief moment. One flicker of hurt. “Okay – fine. I can’t tolerate it, so if we can start with the Patronus –”
"That still doesn't change the fact that despite having been here for a few weeks, you found no reason to trust me enough," that hurt to say more than he thought it would, "enough to at least tell me about a fucking cup that could possibly get both of us killed."
The corner of his lip twitched, before curling into a teasing smirk. “It revolves around a ‘lost princess’ with hair containing healing powers and an evil witch with ageing issues. Of course it’s weird.”
It caused the brunet to laugh. A soft, amused laugh. With a faint chuckle, he moved closer behind Draco and placed a hand on the back while adjusting the position of the arm. “Relax, Draco.”
“I’m an –” Harry doubled over, a hand to his stomach, a boisterous, carefree laugh flying out of him on the sardonic comment. It caused a stutter in Draco’s chest. “we’ve already established that, haven’t we?”
“Point proven.” The anxious frown was replaced with an amused glint while the corner of his mouth curved upward into a lopsided grin. “Scoreboard: Harry Potter – 1, Draco Malfoy – 0.”
“You don’t care about the references,” He stated as a matter-of-factly. “You’re curious, aren’t you?”
Harry frowned. Voldemort didn’t show mercy – He would kill the ones who dared to cross him. Why had he sent Malfoy here?
He decided to practice wandless magic, considering he couldn’t move for a while. Plus, he wanted to work on a complex spell – Complex, yet familiar – The Patronus Charm.
The teacup shattered by the accidental magic, and the sound echoed deafeningly in the house. He closed his eyes, forcing the thoughts out of his mind and the panic subsided slowly.
Harry didn’t suppose it was wise to detest a dead man. A dead man who cared about his son in his own peculiar ways. Cared enough to risk his life.
“He was with you for what – five minutes?” Draco said with a soft snort, a brief flicker of contempt crossing the features. “If you could defend Weasley, couldn’t your self-righteous arse extend the courtesy to the
Tentatively, he advanced towards the kitchen counter and picked the folded parchment. A reluctant smile spread across his face, as he read the note:
Draco chuckled, as he muttered a few healing spells. The fractured jaw was mending itself, and the cuts were healing. He stared at the brunet. At the dark rings underneath the eyes. They weren’t unattractive. “Why didn’t you fight back?”
“You –” A frown creased his forehead, mouth caught open in the soft vowel sound and with a faint trace of sarcasm, Harry said, “open to criticism now, are you?”
“Oh, wait – You’re Harry Potter – It’ll have some sort of a complicated explanation. You’re right, I don't think I want to hear it.” Malfoy said, with a little smile. “Do you remember our Quidditch matches?”
“Yes, well, you’re the one casting a glamour on the eyes to conceal the fact that you’ve got heterochromia, Malfoy – Plus, I can’t figure why you want a glamour on the eyes – It –” He paused. “It – er – suits you.”
He sliced a lemon and placed it on the side of the two cups and added half a spoon of milk, and half the cap of cream to it with one spoon of sugar in his cup and cast a warming charm on it. Perfect.
1996. Third of December. Stars. Silver. The whisper. Light of a thousand falling stars. A missing piece of the puzzle.
He was enchanted, his body moving in along in tandem of it's own accord and it caused a warmth to surge through him. He felt content for once.
He was sprawled on the soft sand with the blond on the side, out of the corner of his eyes, and he caught a glimpse of a small cut across the top of Draco’s cheekbone. “Oh, my fucking Christ.”
With a chuckle, he dismissed the painful anagrams out of his mind, and wandered off to the kitchen, humming a song he would often listen to on the radio as Aunt Petunia would clean the house.
Malfoy’s finger traced the picture, and lingered for a second longer – The way it had, on Harry’s jaw near the sea – And his gaze was distant.
He stared at the sky ahead, as the thoughts raced through his mind. He didn’t know if he should trust Malfoy. He couldn’t. He wanted to get out of here. Why would Lucius send him here? He couldn’t save Malfoy – He couldn’t even save himself.
“Otryazan means ‘severed’ in Bulgarian,” He continued, as he stared at the sea. It was calm, and the waves were crashing softly against the shore. “I’ve tried to get out, but the ancient magic –
“The little blond lesbian from the snake house?” He said, with an air of drama. “You – What the fuck, Potter?”
It was a cold voice. A light illuminated the hallway. He turned. Lucius Malfoy was standing in the corridor, his hair lank over his shoulder. Harry trained his wand at him. “Walk away, Lucius.”
“A deal,” Malfoy repeated, and pursed his lips and directed a sceptical glance at the brunet. He was thinking. Calculating. “Could you – erm – perhaps teach me the Patronus charm in return?”
He didn’t even know Malfoy, and he wanted to. He wanted to know the reason his sky was pitch black, and didn’t have any stars. Was it because he was alone? God, he would’ve never thought that there was another side to Draco Malfoy. A side that he didn’t know about.
He decided to avoid thinking about Aunt Petunia. Or about any of the Dursley’s. Or of Voldemort, as he sauntered into the kitchen in a measured pace.
“So, now you can prepare a crepe – which is perfect, by the way – you can find a way to continue your to-do list which involves
Harry chuckled, as whisked the flour, sugar and salt. In another bowl, he added the milk, butter and the eggs. Malfoy was watching him intently. It was insanely uncomfortable. “Can you whisk it, as I add the flour in portions?”
He chuckled as the snitch fluttered and ascended in the air, only to pause mid-air in front of him. The familiar flutter of the snitch was kind of calming. Kind of close to Hogwarts. “I’m not certain you want to hear it.”
“Draco –” He shuffled forward sort of absent-mindedly, perhaps to comfort Draco, yet the blond raised a hand to halt him, one arm curling around warily around the abdomen, “what are you –”
“I couldn’t’ve refused,” he whispered in a small voice while the soft smile faltered and Harry felt an odd throb in the chest.  “not when –” A pause. “not when I’ve wanted to be your friend for six years.”
Draco couldn’t resist the slow grin forming on the mouth. “Yes, well, perhaps I’m fond of mundane fairy-tales about a love, genies, and flying carpets or a lost princess with magical hair now.”
He softened. The moonlight was dancing on the pale skin, and falling on the platinum blond hair. The soft snores and the sound of the waves silenced the whispers in his own head. “Night, Tinkerbell.”
Draco arched a brow in confusion. He had refrained from a clever, sarcastic comment when he had the perfect chance. Perhaps, it was a right choice to offer him one chance. “Inflated ego –” A beat. “and the Malfoy pride.”
There was a pause and Harry slowly shook his head. "You know we can't, Malfoy. In there – In the real world, we’re enemies. This is a fantasy, and we can’t have that."
“You’re insanely disappointed,” Harry countered, with a smirk. More banter – It was almost surreal. “Tea?”
Malfoy cursed with a muffled groan. The words were unfamiliar. Foreign. “Perhaps you can tone down the swearing a bit – quit glaring – Plus, I can’t even comprehend what you’re saying.”
He could detect another glimmer in the cup. The Head Boy one. He would’ve had the chance if he was in Hogwarts for the seventh year. Yet, one couldn’t be Head Boy
He was slightly fortified by the moderate success, he concentrated on the shell and willed it to float to his hand. The magic was stirring inside him, in a slow pace. The shell floated to his hand, and the stir halted.
“Oh, shut up,” He said with a small snort and the corners of his mouth upturned in soft amusement at the flicker of anxiety across Draco’s face. “the oh-so deficient vocabulary will suffice for a conversation with you.”
“Oh, I’m accustomed to it now, considering you can’t survive for a minute without sending a French curse with a sneer or a scowl in my direction.” He said in a low drawl. “Harry Potter – 2, Draco Malfoy – 0.”
He shouldn’t be here. Not with Malfoy. He didn’t have a wand to defend himself, and he was worn out. He didn’t have the strength to apparate out of here.
He fished it out, placing it on top of the novel, and the familiar rage started to fade. He exhaled slowly, putting his glasses on as he opened his eyes. The pocket watch remained on the novel. He didn’t want it close to him.
He scoffed. There was absolutely no fucking way that Malfoy had intruded his mind to know about the manor and his father. “You could’ve asked.”
Tom. Tom Riddle. Voldemort. He fished out the pocket-watch (or at least it was a pocket-watch to the eye), and stared at it. He couldn’t fucking believe it.
Harry arched an eyebrow at him. Draco hadn’t been anticipating it. He was missing a piece of the puzzle. He fixed his gaze at a distance. He watched the moon light up the night and cascading its light with a soft glow, casting a slivery sparkle on the water.
He cleared his mind and focused on the memories, searching for the fondest one. The one which can light a smile on his face.
“Wait,” Draco said, casting the thoughts out of his head as he wandlessly summoned the essence of dittany and a rag. “You aren’t supposed to know–"
The cup was conjuring an object. It was on the bottom of the cup. A badge. He fished it out and turned it over. Quidditch Captain. He exhaled. Quidditch. He wanted to play Quidditch. Wanted to fly on his beloved firebolt.
A little bit like his own life. It’s complicated and kind of sad, but it still has the little moments of simple contentment. It shouldn’t have a perfect ending, if his life has never been perfect.
“You saved him, didn’t you?” Harry clenched his fists to his side. He barely managed to hold back a retort. He didn’t suppose that: “Serves him right” would’ve been the right thing to say. “You saved your father’s arse, and that bastard sent me here.”
With a soft groan, he turned to face Draco Malfoy. He was slightly tense, and focusing on the potion. He had an odd sort of relationship with the blond. Not rivals. Or acquaintances. It was a mutual decision to call a truce. “I am focusing, Malfoy. I was only distracted.”
Malfoy let out a snort. A silence engulfed them, pregnant and uncomfortable. The blond peered into his eyes, glaring at him curiously.
Harry didn’t want to dismiss the possibility of this entire situation being a trap. He didn’t trust Malfoy. He would have to earn that trust for himself. He didn’t even care that Malfoy was a death eater. He had tormented him a lot over the years, and he wasn’t going to warm up to him. Not until he was certain that it isn’t a trap. “Why are you here, Malfoy?”
In the morning, a warm cup of tea was waiting on the kitchen counter. Draco almost smiled as he sipped the tea. Almost. It faltered as he traced back to the conversation near the seashore at night.
Malfoy smirked, and gave a slight shake to his head. With a sigh, he poured the chocolate chips and started folding the dough.
Harry cleared his throat, and released the grip of Malfoy’s wrist. He turned his gaze towards the kitchen Island, and frowned. A heavy silence hung in the air.
