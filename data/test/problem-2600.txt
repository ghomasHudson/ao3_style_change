He sensed rather than saw Ron stiffen. The lanky redhead's magic all but crackled around them, and Harry was instantly on his guard. His wand was in his hand before he even realized he'd released it from its holster, though Harry remained seated, following Ron's lead.
Charm."
"We had dinner a few weeks ago at that new place in Hogsmeade. His wife was a much more charming than I remember her being in school, but Merlin, can that woman eat! I assume it's mostly the pregnancy, but still. It was more than a little revolting to watch her eat ice cream topped with cockroach clusters and mustard," Draco said with a slight shudder.
"Alright," he sighed, marking his place in the thick stack of papers and setting them aside. He rose and stretched, holding a hand out to help Draco up off the floor.

"Who's the idiot now?" He asked the blond, barely holding back his own laughter.
"I wasn't a Death Eater. I was never marked. He knows that. I have had nothing to do with the Dark Arts since the war. The Ministry searched Malfoy Manor and all our other properties and removed any Dark artifacts."
"If he doesn't like it –"
Instead of backing off, the Auror slid into an empty chair at their table, earning a low growl of warning from Ron. "The papers will have a field day with this little rendezvous of yours, you know. First Oliver, now Ron? Poor Hermione."
TBC: Next up, the epilogue!
"What he said –"
"A few weeks," Neville admitted.
Draco flushed, shaking his head. He hadn't known, but it wasn't a complete surprise, either. He looked up at the portrait, pressing his lips together so he wouldn't laugh.
Harry closed that window, too, quickly growing annoyed with the site.
He knew Kingsley planned to blanket the chateau in several high-level Secrecy Spells, which would prevent any of the guests from talking about the marriage with anyone who didn't already know. It was a good precaution, since several of the guests would be children who could easily slip up accidentally.

Ron shrugged, still not meeting Draco's eye. He didn't pull away, but he didn't return the gesture, either.
"Oh my god," Harry whispered, and Draco whipped his hand back as though burned by the words.
He waved, giving her an exaggerated appraisal and a big wink. He saw her laugh once before she was swept away again, pulled into another crowd of well-wishers.
Harry's names and family seals appeared on the parchment, earning a satisfied nod from Kingsley.
But she'd conquered that reluctance when she remembered yesterday morning, when Ron had turned down her offer of a pre-swim romp in the shower in favor of poring over the
he slit his palms and squeezed so that the blood dripped into the bowl in a steady stream. Harry winced at the burn and then the aggravation of his wound, but he ground his molars and continued till he had filled the bowl half-way. After, he let his magic wash over the wounds, mending, stitching, cleaning, and seeping into the air. It was imperative to imbue magic into the ritual room as it hadn’t been used since he discovered it in the middle of his fifth year, and as everyone knows, rituals harness latent magic.
As Harry expected, he slept through dinner and, to the next morning. He was woken up by Michael casting several screeching alarm clock charms and, feeling remarkably refreshed, he headed to the bathroom and got ready for the day.

Both his emotions and his thoughts, memories, and information had to be put somewhere in his mindscape. While the idea of a library came immediately, Harry took longer to figure out what to do with his emotions.  He disliked the idea of keeping them in the same place, so Harry bounced between idea and idea on where to place his emotions.  He stumbled upon the idea of putting his emotions in a tapestry when Hermione talked about how sewing and other art projects helped calm her down, and Draco agreed, talking about his needlepoint with his mother and how it always soothed him and provided structure.  Potter Manor was decorated with tapestry after tapestry, so it wasn’t hard to make the leap and put two and two together.
As they slowed down, both boy and horse sweaty from exertion, Harry looked at the sun and groaned.  If he wanted any chance of a nap, he’d have to head home now.  With a fair amount of grumbling, Harry led Turnip back to the stables and handed the reins off to Acorn, making sure to smile and the house-elf despite his annoyance at the time.
"Where's the rest?"  Asked the Dark Lord, with a deceptively calm voice
Harry closed the diary with a smile like he usually did.  Sure, he had terrific friends, but Tom was different.  Draco was nice, but Harry was much too interested in getting in his pants for him to be family (unless they married), Hermione was a girl, and while Harry loved her, they didn’t wholly understand each other. The other male Ravenclaws weren’t close enough to be family.  So, enter Tom, the brother he never had.
It was clear, though, that he was speaking right to Harry.  They looked at each other, and Susan looked at him sympathetically.  They nodded their understanding, and the Minister’s smirk widened.
Sorry this chapter is so late, not only was this chapter so hard to write and I'm sure the pacing/writing is strange, but real life was kicking my ass.  I'm no good at writing filler chapters, but I really needed this to be a filler chapter because that makes sense within the story arc: hence my struggle.  (Also school is so much fun.)  But enough of my complaining and onto the chapter!
That revelation complicated things quite a bit, the Minister mused.  Oh well.  Harry would have to get over it, because he was the Minister’s now, and the Minister didn’t care for silly notions like
“Why I don’t wish to share my personal stories is, again, none of your concern.”
“But I’m your family.”
At dinner, while eating the beef stew, rice, and fried plantains, Harry thought of his week, and it was quite the week. This was not how he expected his 7th year to go, but oh well, at least it was interesting. Pushing all thoughts of the Minister and the past week away, Harry tuned back into the conversation bouncing between his year mates and joined in the light-hearted teasing, joking, debates, and storytelling.
They weren’t speaking at all, their shield charms flickering in and out, blocking spell after spell.  Harry hit Susan with an overpowered

Since his potion was finished and Chandan (Hecate bless him) had cleaned up for him, Harry told Roper that it was her turn and went over to Hermione.  In hushed tones, he explained what had just happened.  Hermione’s eyes grew wider and wider as Harry quickly spoke, and when he finished, she tiredly rubbed her eyes and stuck her hands in her hair.  She sighed and patted his head before handing him a quill and parchment and saying, “Well, there’s nothing we can do about that, so let’s just do homework.”

But Harry was getting ahead of himself, so instead of musing what it would be like as an Unspeakable, Harry spent six hours researching alongside his fellow 7th years on his Novo Novus Showcase project. They didn’t talk the whole time, but there was a sense of companionship, and it was nice to research next to all his friends, with the only sounds being quills scratching and pages turning.

Harry added, “He probably wants to see all his options. Not everyone good for the job would apply.”
Susan winked at Harry and shifted her stance.
It would be nice to finally have a mask of his own.  Hermione and Draco had never talked about them around him since they knew he was barred from the annual rites, but he had seen theirs one or two times (Hermione’s being a deep blue general masquerade mask and Draco’s being a peacock mask) and had intense and quite embarrassing jealousy for them.  And now, his childish wish he’d had since his seventh birthday -- the year children could join in on rites -- would be granted.
Harry gave Tom a roguish smile, wrinkled his nose, and launched himself at Tom -- like a snidget!
Harry paid no heed to the ending of the memory instead his mind was stuck on a loop of, “Why a runespoor??”
Being back in his own bed (and next to Tom’s soothing magic) had done Harry wonders, and by the time morning came around, he was well-rested and in a decent mood.  He was beyond grateful that today was his self-study day so that he could catch up on his classwork after the debacle and recovery of the past two days.
before banishing them.  The class was silent, they hadn’t seen anything like that before, and Susan looked on appreciatively.  She readied her wand, back on offensive, and opened her mouth to cast a spell when she heard a slow clap.  The Minister disillusioned himself and walked--no stalked--towards the pair.  They lowered their wand arms and stood, facing the man.
Harry let out a small 'aww' when he saw the first years. They looked adorable and so, so young.  He could see Lisa’s little sister and Michael’s little brother in the group, but he didn’t recognize anyone else, though Hermione did.  She gave a couple of encouraging smiles to a few of them--probably kids she knew from Merope’s.
After which, there were several more calls and responses, each in Latin and each welcoming Mother Magic and her blessings into space.  Though Harry knew some people still held doubts about the old ways (he vividly remembered when Lisa said her Mother would rant and rave about the heathenous rituals), he didn’t know how it was possible when during rituals he felt so
When the Minister was a safe distance away, Harry began to laugh with relief.  It was a breathy laugh with a near-hysterical edge, and the rest of the class felt the same.  He collapsed onto his knees and leaned against the wall.  Professor Flitwick cast
Harry was just glad no one else was targeted like he was.  That gratefulness didn’t last the night, though, and when he was back in the Great Hall for breakfast the next morning, he was in a dreadful mood.  He picked at his omelet and couldn’t stomach more than a few slices of fruit.  A letter from Uncle Sirius and Uncle Moony brightened his temper, though. They apologized for the lateness and were appalled with the Minister’s behavior, though there was nothing they could do given their war criminal status.  Uncle Moony was especially incensed, and according to Uncle Sirius, was about to storm over to Hogwarts and

Harry kept chanting, forwards and backward, over and over, watching as the diadem began to shake and vibrate, a storm grey shade slowly coming out. The shade flickered in and out of existence, and began to absorb the blood, sated like a cat drinking warm milk. It had consumed all of the blood except for the Ayin runes and was a solid near-black color when Harry changed the chant.
James continued as they walked.  “Sirius and Remus will be coming over for the mourning ceremony of our darling Lily, but they will be leaving after so we may perform the ancestor mourning rites.  Cousin Rhodesia will be there for both -- she’s decided that Young Cousin Aquila will not be performing in the Potter rites despite her recent 7th birthday, so Young Cousin Aquila will not be coming.  Tomorrow, on Samhain, we will meet up with Cousin Rhodesia, Heir Ingram Nott, and Young Cousin Aquila to head to the annual bonfire and rites. On Sunday, you will be attending the Black rites with Sirius Black instead of alone as the norm.”
Sensing that the duel was coming to a close, Susan cast

. Her family left the country and did their best to forget that they had a daughter. This was especially prudent given that people were coming forward on exactly what sins needed retribution (and there were many, many, many she had to atone for). Draco and Hermione wisely ignored the blood under Harry’s fingernails and the wild look in his eyes the three months before her family received that gift.
“Any questions?”

When he got into the room, Professor Black smiled at him kindly, but Harry was only focused on the Minister.  Rage crested in him, and he rudely asked, “What are you doing here??”
‘C’mon, up you go,” Tom said, shoving Harry off and then offering him a hand.

The Minister’s eyes widened at the implications.  Thankfully, Madame Spinstra, who they had all forgotten, was watching the students, not wanting to interfere with whatever the Minister was doing.  Harry cast
Everybody laughed, and Hermione replied after swallowing a bite of scrambled eggs, "I think it's inevitable that you’ll have Double Potions if you want to be a healer.  And, you know how Professor Black feels about having his NEWTS class early in the morning."
James readied himself for a lecture when the ward alarms sounded and laughter was heard on the manor grounds.  It was Uncle Moony, Uncle Sirius, and Cousin Rhodesia.  James straightened up, put on a moonshine smile -- all play pretend.
The next morning Harry yawned and stretched, ready to start the day.  Michael was already up, but Terry was the furthest thing from a morning person, and it would take quite a few charms and creative techniques perfected over the years to wake him up.  It sounded like Michael had taken on the “waking up Terry in the morning” task, so Harry cast
He must not have hidden it well enough because Draco grabbed his hand under the table, his thumb rubbing soothing circles on the back of his hand.  They weren't together or anything like that (though that might change if Harry had something to do with it). Harry was just a tactile person.  It took Draco some time to get used to the frequent hugs and warm touches, but now he found himself looking for subtle contact and physical comfort.  Hermione didn’t mind as much because she was a touch-oriented person too.
aspect of the memory.
The Minister paused and shuffled through the files in his mind, searching for Vivian Penmark when he got to the file, red hot anger, like fire and brimstone, burned through his core.
That didn’t show in his voice when he said, “I believe I am, though, from my understanding, you are not one of her victims.”
“Good.  It is to both my relief and distaste that we are attending the annual ceremony for the first time this year, though I presume you will enjoy the chance to see that friend of yours, Hermione.”
Harry breathed deeply before calling up the final memory: talking with Tom.  He skipped through the platitudes, small talk, and talk of

Their letter did much to lift his spirits during breakfast, but when he walked to his Double Charms with Padma and Cho, his mood soured, and his expression went stony.  They didn’t try to make him feel better, which he appreciated; they just quietly talked about the usage of charms in duels and which ones they thought were most useful.
"Slytherin!"
When the chanting was over and magic swam all throughout the plaza, adults began to pluck marigolds and such from the garlands floating about.  “Here,” they all said, handing them to the smaller children, blessing the flowers as they traded palms.  “Set them in the fire,” was said next, and each person, child or not, tossed them into the bonfires.  Curlicues of scented smoke rose up as the petals turned to ash, and more flowers fed the fire.
Before he did any potion-making, Harry set up his cauldron, knives, the salt mortar, and pestles, measured out all his ingredients, chopped the Io tongue with a copper knife, and crushed his purpura brassica.  Then he was finally ready to start making the actual potion, so in a brass cauldron, Harry poured 300 mL of Standard Potioning Water and the flame onto medium.  He cast

Harry gulped and readied himself, loosely holding his wand and squaring his shoulders.  Professor Flitwick unhappily counted off, and the fight began again.  While they were both more than willing to throw the fight, their competitiveness didn’t let them, so they cast spells with unrivaled ferocity and talent.

“Welcome home.”
The leaves and trees were colorful and wild, all fire and sunshine, on the cusp of change and death.  Harry meandered down the grimy cobblestone path till he stopped at the imposing cherry wood doors.  Harry fixed his hair, and without his influence, the doors swung open to reveal James.
He had heard about them once or twice before; the Potter library was a lot darker than one would think, but it was mostly as examples of Black Magic (not Dark, Black) and that you should never, ever use them.  Harry scraped the bottom of his mind for any information on them, but all he found was what Tom had told him, a couple of warnings, and one vaguely chronicled tale on Herpo the Foul.  Otherwise, he didn’t have much to go on.  Filing that on a brand new shelf, Harry moved onto the more
At that, Harry snapped the diary shut and slid it under his pillow.  He took off his glasses and tiredly rubbed his eyes.  Shucking off the blanket he was wrapped in, Harry twisted his legs into a crisscrossed position and began meditating.  In and out.  In and out.  His chest rose and fell as his lungs expanded and deflated in slower and slower beats.

waiting in vain for an opening.  He never gave her that, and the class was waiting eagerly for the finale.
“And who issss thissss… Jamessss?”
Harry took Tom’s advice and changed for bed.  He knew that he wouldn’t be up for dinner (a sort of bone-deep exhaustion was clinging onto his body from all the magical usage), so Harry just spelled on his pajamas and fell right asleep.

jinxes cast all in a row had caught him off guard.  It was perfect.  The duel was perfect.
Professor Black thanked him, and Harry took his seat, ignoring the Thoth-damned Minister’s heavy gaze. There were 10 minutes left in class, and Harry was praying that class passed without incident, but of course, it didn’t as the Minister decided to materialize and walk over to the front of the class, where Harry was sat.
The Minister’s face paled dramatically and quickly hissed back, “I didn’t know you were a Parsssselmage.”

Development!!! Harry is a lot more dangerous than the Minister thinks, and he's not afraid to crush whoever opposes him. Ruthlessness, in my opinion, is a very Ravenclaw trait, and Harry has spent years honing his knowledge and skills. He's also very, very ambitious, but it's knowledge-driven, and so... development!!
With James’ piece said, they all lapsed back into silence, tension thick like porridge.
If you’re reading this as a completed fic, this would be a good time to stop, get some water, go to bed, do that last assignment, etc. <3
Was it any wonder that Harry had grown to resent her over the years?  He loved her, to be sure, but instead of focusing on the present and the future, James was focused on decades in the past.  It was nice to remember people, but to only ever constantly talk of her?  It was excessive and obsessive.

Sarcastically Harry replied, “He’s the Dark Lord. Does he ever do anything normally?”
After dragging himself through his morning routine and picking at his scrambled eggs, Harry tried desperately to get away from his friends. They

He walked over to her and smiled, staying quiet while Professor Flitwick continued to call out names.  When Professor Flitwick finished, he reminded the classes of the rules (don’t maim/injure/kill, charms only, utilize verbal and nonverbal charms, proper dueling stance, and a few others that Harry didn’t quite catch).  Finally, it was time to duel properly.
Harry sent up a prayer to Mother Magic that the Minister stayed away for today (and the rest of his life) and left for breakfast with Hermione and Draco. He had Potions first thing in the morning (not double, thank Merlin, that was on Draco’s A days) with Hermione, Maisy, Anthony, and Terry. After breakfast, he walked to the dungeon classroom with them.
He tried to corner the boy’s magic, but it quickly found a gap and slipped past before his magic could absorb it. Harry gathered the threads of his magic, trying to bring it back to his body, but he was too panicked to do it properly.  The Minister snuffed the candles hoping to confuse this other magic, but it was wily and slicker than oil. The useless children screamed, distracting the Minister. That was enough time for Harry to calm down and pull all his magic back in.
Harry refocused on the sorting just as the first person went to Ravenclaw: Tallulah Cole, a positively tiny ravenette with big clunky glasses.  He’d have to get her to Madame Pomphrey to fix that; those frames would not do.
The Latin and Punjabi (sorry about the wrong script, by the way) mean the same thing as the English, and I used them because the British language of magic is Latin, and the Potters are Punjabi in this fic.
After he chewed and swallowed, Harry replied, “And I as well.  What about you, father?”
Harry internally groaned before politely replying, “I fail to see how that is any of your concern, Minister, and I ask that you respect my privacy.”

-- it wouldn’t do to be late after all -- and got up, sliding his mask on and tying a braided, tri-color rope around his waist.  When Harry got down to the foyer, Father, Little Cousin Aquila, Cousin Rhodesia, Cousin Ingram, Uncle Moony, and Uncle Sirius were all waiting, making awkward conversation.
Harry smiled and greeted Luna fondly before heading over to the 7th year section.  He chatted with some of his year mates, making small talk; yes, he had read the textbooks already Lisa, no he hadn’t seen the newest edition of
He left the class feeling very unsatisfied, so throughout lunch, he brainstormed with Pavarti and came up with his final idea: Alchemy and its applications to limb regeneration.  It wasn’t his best idea, but it was interesting and would pose a big challenge, so Harry was pretty happy with it.  He was also happy with his vegetable stew and the baguette he snatched up from the Slytherin table while passing on gossip to Pansy.
“That was one of the best duels I have ever seen; you truly have the gift of dueling,”  said Professor Flitwick.
If Harry had less competent occlumency shields, he would have rolled his eyes so hard they would fall out of his head. But he didn’t, so he just narrowed his eyes and tightened up his shields. They weren’t good enough, though, to stop him from rolling his eyes at Hermione when the Minister opened his Hecate-damned mouth and started to spew dramatics and absurdities.
"Is everyone ready?" Lisa asked, and once she got a nod or a verbal response from every first year, she began to walk out the Ravenclaw exit towards their tower.  Michael started telling jokes, trying to relieve the tension, and soon he had everyone giggling, or at the very least amused.  Harry laughed as he walked out of the hall, not noticing the crimson eyes that followed him with a predatory gaze. The Minister wanted--no
Hermione - Magpie (intelligent, perceptive, observational, willful, ambitious)
Harry tuned out the speech until his name was called.
By the way, I added chapter names of cool words I've collected over the years, just cause, so let me know what you think!
Harry smiled and replied, “Thank you, though I couldn’t have beaten him if he hadn’t gotten so overconfident and angry.”
He left his ruminating behind in time to change back into his day robes and head up to his room to begin getting ready for the dinner party and subsequent mourning rites.  Harry entered the bathroom and drew himself a bath -- Billa, the handmaiden house-elf, would be with James, so Harry would get himself ready.  Harry scrubbed his skin raw and rinsed his hair, one, two, three times.  Afterward, he drained the bathtub and dried himself off completely.  He sat, naked, at the vanity and manicured his nails, eyebrows, facial hair, and body hair till he was as close to perfection one could get.  Kohl lined his eyes and filled in his brows, vermillion powder dusted his eyelids and cheeks, and cake mascara lengthened his lashes into near-impossible lengths.  Pigmented oils were scrubbed unto his skin to cast a shimmery glow and gave his lips an imperceptible shine.  With a flick and swish of his wand, his Potter robes were wrapped on him, and after a few unnecessary de-wrinkling charms, he was ready to go.
After quite some time on the path, he led Turnip back into the open fields and threw her into a canter.  She whinnied with excitement, and her strides lengthened till she was all but flying.  Harry let out a whoop of joy, laughing as he pressed flush against Turnip’s neck.  Harry was going to regret riding so hard, but he could always put on a balm and sleep it off -- he had magic, after all.
“Do you yield?”  Harry asked quietly, chest heaving.
auris bona - a charm that improves hearing
Harry took a deep breath and ignored the warped shadows becoming more distinct and human-shaped as if interested in the duel.
Lavender cleared her throat before saying, “Amarenovis has two main uses; the more common one is as an antidote to Amortentia, but if one uses a bloodstone rather than a sunstone, any feeling of romantic love can be erased. An overdose of Amarenovis makes it so the victim can never love again, romantically, platonically, or otherwise. It looks like onyx and smells exactly like Amortensia, but with an added scent of what you most hate.”
Soon enough, Harry was more or less done with his makeup and put on his white shift-like robe, careful not to disturb any powder or anything of the sort (he had a preservation charm on, so it was unnecessary, but it was always better to be safe than sorry).  He attempted to style his hair as well, but the static of his magic made it near impossible to do, so with a sigh, Harry gave up.
Harry slyly said, “Professor Black, I hope you aren’t insinuating anything.”
Was called, and Harry could tell Michael was nervous.  He didn’t need to, though, because after about a minute, “Ravenclaw!” was yelled.
Harry danced with people he knew and people he had never met before -- not even in a passing encounter.  It was truly a night to remember, and oh how Harry felt rejuvenated.  But more than that, he felt connected, one with the other wixen in a way he had never felt before.  Their magics were all intertwined and pulsed together with a singular heartbeat, all connected under Mother Magic.  Flushed and sweaty from the magical exertion, Harry let out a slow, measured exhale, letting his aching cheeks rest, and reveled in the ever-present, all-consuming
Harry thanked Merlin that today was a lecture day (the previous day had been safety warnings, regulations, and NEWTS information).  He set up his workspace and began diligently taking notes.  Harry had assumed that the Minister had gone back to the Ministry to brood, but he, unfortunately, thought wrong.  Nobody noticed (besides Professor Escrivá, but she was in no place to speak up) that the Minister was skulking in the back row of the classroom, licking his wounds and keeping tabs on that Potter boy.

Harry called out, his wand slashing through the air with vicious efficiency.

When lunch was over, the debate was clearly not, so they put it on hold to go to their last class, but as soon as they got back into the common room, they resumed, and it only got more and more heated.  By dinnertime, all of the 7th years had picked a side and were fiercely arguing their point.  Sue, Harry, Hermione, Padma, Terry, Helen, Aaron, and Mandy argued how transfiguration was pointless and offered an opening while Cho, Draco, Anthony, Michael, Lisa, Maisy, and Jason maintained the position that it was extremely useful.  Marietta assumed the role of the moderator as it was her turn this time.
That got him a sharp elbow in the ribcage from Draco, who hissed, “Don’t be cheeky; he could be listening.”
Halfway through class, everyone had managed to cast the mist, and Harry, Draco, Hermione, Cho, Susan, Lavender, Blaise, Hannah, Greengrass, Nott, Weasley, Dunbar, and Jones had all managed to cast a shield.
Poppy was an older elf, shriveled with age, and wasn’t a fan of the new policies that required payment and off days for house-elves (years of being told you were nothing weren’t erased in a matter of minutes, especially not in a home as traditional as Father ruled). So he drank the last dregs of his mimosa to wash down the papaya and gather his courage.  Harry was no Gryffindor, but he wasn’t a coward when it came to those he cared about.
When the last student scurried out of the room, the Minister roared, and his magic lashed out, destroying the room in an explosion of inky black and coppery reds.  It was different hearing of the abuse from Severus, but to see it?  The Minister was apoplectic.  How DARE that man hurt him.  Harry was HIS to hurt.  To break his bones and char his flesh, till nothing remained but that gorgeous, gorgeous power.  And that despicable man would pay for hurting his Harry.  And that Hecate-damned mudblood and Malfoy heir.  Harry was HIS, not theirs.  His magic swirled around, only contained by the protective ward Hogwarts had for her students.

Uncle Moony had told him James had always despised children, even as a youth himself, found them irritating and unintelligent.  Little Cousin Aquila was quite smart for her age and rarely behaved indecorously, but Father still found reason to hold her at arm's length.
Harry woke up the next morning, feeling not right.  He couldn’t pinpoint exactly what he felt, but his skin was crawling, and it was a little hard to breathe. Stretching his limbs, he tried to get his mind off of the strange, oppressive cloud fogging up everything.  Harry groaned as he remembered they had Potions today.  He tiredly rubbed his eyes till white-hot dots swam, and he felt a little more in control.  He sighed, and then again.  Thankfully Michael and Terry were already up and more worried about getting themselves ready -- small mercies.  Harry headed down to breakfast with Draco and Hermione, waving away their concern, instead, focusing on eating his grits and sugar (a very delicious breakfast a Hufflepuff, Aquila Yates, who was a transfer from Ilvermorny, taught him).  He also focused on clearing his mind and on the new debate: whether agrimony or hawthorn was better in blood-replenishing potions.
“Yes I would, it would mean you were keeping slaves.”
When the Minister nodded, and his magic went back to normal, Snape could have cried with relief, but he had decorum, so, instead, he began telling the creepily interested Dark Lord the tale of one Harry Potter.  How a scrawny, malnourished 11-year-old boy was sorted into Ravenclaw.  He told him about his broken home with a dead mother and a deadbeat father and how his Uncle Moony, the Department Head of Dark and Magical Creatures, raised him.  How the boy was quiet, curious, and intelligent.  He told him of the boy’s magical prowess, academic strengths and weaknesses, and friends.
“Perfect.  I’ll write a note to Professor Escrivá letting her know what happened.”

He always forgot how stressful meals at home were -- especially when arguments were involved.  It was good to be back home, despite it all, because he missed Turnip and Cousin Rhodesia and Poppy’s cooking and Acorn’s fussing and Uncle Moony and countless other things that made home, home.
When he returned with all the ingredients, Hermione smiled in thanks, and they began to make the potion. Hermione poured a liter of Standard Potioning Water in their silver cauldron and turned on a hot flame.
Eventually, they all had to head to their classes, so they said their goodbyes and went their separate ways; Harry with Hermione, Maisy, Anthony, and Terry.  Harry prayed to Mother Magic, Morgana, and all the powers above that the Minister wasn’t going to be in his Potions class - just this once.  Alas, his prayers were left unanswered, and the Minister was sitting on one of the observing benches, scrawling away with a quill.  Harry audibly groaned, and Maisy patted his shoulder in commiseration, but they had class, so they focused on Professor Black, who was writing instructions on the blackboard.  Once everyone was seated at each of the tables -- individually in this class -- Professor Black greeted them.
Harry and Millicent Bulstrode had partnered up to practice
(not angry, irritated, mad, frustrated), the Minister looked worried.  Professor Black stepped forwards and began to soothe Harry.  He said, “Harry, I need you to calm down for me; I understand that you have had a bad experience with Amortentia, but all of us are legally mandated to not take advantage of you, and if you really can’t do it -- Ms. Granger couldn’t, and neither could Mr. Malfoy -- I perfectly understand, and I will just grade based on the physical characteristics.”
of Headmaster Snape, Harry turned his head to the head table.  Like the rest of the school, his eyes widened when the Minister ceased his disillusionment charm and was before them in all his glory.  He wore elegant evergreen robes with silver filigree.  From what Harry could see, Minister Peverell had an ivory dress shirt with an ebony waistcoat, and his hair was neatly done, combed, and gelled to perfection.  His magic washed off of him in sensual waves, heady, dark, and intoxication--it felt quite familiar.
“You wouldn’t.” Father said, continuing to slice his sausage into ribbons.
“I don’t advertisssse my sssskills, m’Lord.”
The Minister spat out, “Yes,” before burning the vines with black fire and sheathing his wand.
If there was one thing that he missed while at Hogwarts, it would be the food cooked by Poppy.  The house-elf had curated a massive breakfast, with assorted chutneys, egg and vegetable dishes, and decadent pastries, to name a few.  Harry neatly ate his food, taking care to mind his manners, and sipped a mimosa made with freshly squeezed orange juice, not daring to start the conversation.  Eventually, Cousin Rhodesia broke the silence and said, “After the ritual last night, I slept like a babe.”
She only managed a thin stream of mist, but Harry and Draco clapped enthusiastically, and both tried at the same time.  Harry cast a slightly larger stream of mist, but Draco didn’t cast anything at all.  He did a second time. They all looked at each other excitedly and then giggled at their absurd enthusiasm (well, Hermione and Harry laughed, and Draco ‘chuckled’ -- he was the only one who giggled).
“It is considered a Dark Spell because it relies on inner magic and is influenced by your emotions, even though you need to think happy thoughts.”
When Professor Flitwick got to him, Harry chatted with him, asking about his summer, the recent dueling championship, and if it was possible to still take his NEWTS in Runes as a self-study course during his free period even though he only got a low EE.  He was delighted with his schedule: Double Charms, DADA, and Transfiguration on his A Days (Monday/Thursday), Potions, Double Alchemy, and Advanced Arithmancy on his B Days (Tuesday/Friday), and a self-study day on Wednesday.  Harry was a little miffed he didn’t have Magical Theory or Runes as actual classes. Still, he could always self-study and take the NEWTS at the Ministry, as he did with his Apparition classes and his Astronomy and Divination OWLS.
The Minister’s smile widened, and he answered, “Any spell allowed and aim to incapacitate, no maiming and killing.”
Come bother me on
Harry gave into temptation and shifted, and the Minister smiled lecherously.
He read, re-read, and re-read again the information Tom had written, memorizing all the different chants. When he was confident in his memory, he put the diary and the diadem in the center of the Teth rune, took a deep breath, and summoned his wand. Waving it in the same pattern as the Teth rune, he chanted, “
The class cheered, and Susan congratulated him, but Harry felt nothing but dread.  Susan hugged him and apologized, but she could do nothing as the Minister strode over to the pair.  She scurried over to the rest of her classmates, and the Minister smiled.
I used pinewood for the buckets/bowls because they represent life and chrysanthemums because they symbolize remembrance. (I was thinking about using carnations too, but I think chrysanthemums tear better lmao).
” Professor Escrivá stated, rapping a knuckle on the blackboard, “Now, Mr. Finnegan, why are you learning this spell here, not in Charms class?”
The Minister’s magic screeched in anger, and the lights flickered back on as he reabsorbed his core.  That brat.  He was going to have him.  He was going to.
"Hello Harry, your wrackspurts are smaller than usual, but your midaleus is angry at being locked up.”  A dreamy voice noted, already seated at the table.

With a flourish, the Unspeakable called out, “
First Minister Marvolo would give a speech as the sun began to set and would finish as the sun finished sinking below the horizon.  Then the Head Unspeakable would welcome everyone to circle their bonfires.  There were too many people to do one large one, so they were sectioned off into groups of 30.  Next, they would all burn their shoes. (Harry thought it was strange, but burning shoes showed they shucked the trappings of humanity.  Technically they should burn all their clothes if one really wanted to be accurate, but they were civilized, shoes were enough).
and his eyes widened at the late (or early hour).  He’d be lucky to get four hours of sleep!  Oh well, he thought, before crawling back under the covers and falling into a deep, relaxed sleep.
He rolled his eyes and readied himself for another half hour of dueling.  Susan took a deep breath and squared her shoulders, her Hufflepuff tenacity showing.  Harry whispered a

Hermione and Draco were pressed up against his sides, providing the physical comfort he desperately needed.  Luna looked unusually solemn, and she whispered foreseen futures entangled in between comments on wrackspurts, midali, and nargles.  Lisa, Marietta, and Maisy fielded questions from other concerned students (his year mates in different houses, Ravenclaws in other houses, and other students who knew or of Harry) so Harry didn’t have to deal with their probing queries.  The rest of the 7th year Ravenclaws just formed a barrier around Harry, and he was beyond grateful for them.
and my tomarry aesthetic
“I have an announcement to make,” Headmaster Snape called out, his voice amplified by a
Then, the Headmaster called the end of the feast, and the food disappeared.  He stood up and said, “This year, our esteemed Minister is looking for an apprentice in their 6th or 7th year to study underneath him in the Ministry. This is an excellent opportunity, and I hope you all take advantage of it.  Anyone with a grade average of EE or above will be considered. Minister, is there anything you'd like to address to the students?"
themselves were moved to a new book on his charms shelf.  By the time that was done, Harry had entirely left his body and was in his happy-fuzzy-not-entirely-aware headspace when not focused on his maze-library-mind space.  It took little effort to bring forth memories, but it would take insurmountable exertion to move his body without damaging his mind, which was why it was so important to not be in a vulnerable space.

Hi!!! This chapter is longer than usual and it contains a bunch of spells of my own making, so a list of all of them and their meanings are in the notes below (for those who are interested).  Also, as usual, a lot of creepiness from our lovely Minister.
slithered out of the memory’s wand.  Then his eyes narrowed as he realized what exactly the silvery blue, serpentine being was: a runespoor.
Harry chuckled -- that was such a Hermione thing to say, so he just smiled and started writing his fifteen inches on the uses of purpura brassica.  Hermione worked on their other assignment (the long, six-sheave essay on the magical differences between Amortentia and Amarenovis).  There were only 10 minutes left of class, so they only finished their outlines, but it did give them both something to focus on, so by the time they exited the class, their minds were ready to focus on their next classes: Alchemy for Harry, Runes for Hermione.
To say the reaction was extreme would be a charitable understatement.  As soon as Hermione and Michael caught a glimpse of it, they practically screamed, and news spread like wildfire.  People were shouting, crying, and hyperventilating.  It was complete pandemonium and Harry sat back on his bench and smiled.  That smile quickly turned into a forced one, when he felt the Minister’s burning stare.  Didn’t the man have a job and whatnot??  Why was he here still??  Harry wanted to cry at the Minister’s overbearingness, and his own stupidity -- now the Minister knew someone (specifically Harry) was after his Horcruxes.
His white linen undergarments were first, so he stripped to his trousers and stood there, shivering, as his father looked on impassively, and Topsy did her best to work quickly.  After that, cornflower blue fabric draped over his lithe frame, wrapping snugly to his body in some places and flowing gracefully in others.  His Potter robes were arranged as Topsy sewed them, a deep v showcasing his embroidered chemise and crimson accents contrasting the soft blue of the Potter crest.
When the shade absorbed the last of the hyacinth tears, Harry poured his magic into the air, corralling the shade into the diary. It shrieked and screamed, and when Harry heard Tom scream too, he almost faltered, but he kept going until the wailing stopped and a strange feeling of
This fic was sponsored by Heat Waves by Glass Animals and was the only way I got myself to write this chapter.
Harry started from the very beginning of the day, pulling up the memory of waking up and breakfast.  He let the chill of early morning, the scent of tea, and the taste of bitter grapefruit wash over him but quickly discarded the memory, filing it in its proper place on the bookshelf, labeled with the date and contents in parselscript.  Harry recalled the next memory, Charms class, and spent time filing away each new charm and academic information he learned in their proper shelves before putting away that one too.
“I’m going to look at him,”  Harry said after a moment's silence.
That was another thing Harry missed while at Hogwarts: riding.
Draco smiled, the corners of his eyes crinkling, and they chattered absentmindedly, blessing the flowers for each other and tossing them into the fire.  Eventually, the sound of a tuning violin tore them apart, and Draco apologetically went back to his family.  As the orchestra (if it could be called that -- it was really just a handful of Unspeakables who specialized in musical magic) tuned, Harry and the rest of the plaza cast cooling charms and fire-resistant charms all over their bodies in preparation for the dancing.
Harry had not, actually, gained weight since the summer, but the comment stung in that sort of muted way, not cleaving straight to his heart but poking at his defenses, analyzing where he’d crumble.  Still, it hurt, and he pasted over a smile that turned into a genuine one when he heard the tinny voice of Topsy, the ancient seamstress elf.  She was withered and wrinkled, both from her actual age and then from the lack of magic in the air.  Three generations ago, Potter Manor was a bustling home full of life, but now its magic was weakened, reputation dashed, and home all but decrepit.
Susan was the first to cast a corporeal charm (unsurprisingly), and her shimmery, pale blue osprey dove across the room with fearlessness.  Buoyed by her girlfriend’s success, Hannah Abbott called out, “
Tom threw his head back and laughed, hugging Harry tightly, still lying on the cold stone.
vinea funem - a charm that makes vines capture the hit object
Harry canted, almost shouting, and the shade greedily absorbed the Ayin runes but shrieked when it drank the hyacinth tears too. It tried to stop, but Harry just chanted louder, letting his magic flow through the basalt, forcing the shade to absorb the tears. Harry knew his face was damp with sweat and tears from exertion, and the screams and wails the shade emitted were horrendous, but Harry compartmentalized and renewed his focus on the ritual.
Harry had many questions, but he knew better than to ask them, so he just said, “No, Father.”
“Truly?”

charm.
The Minister fell into a chair Harry quickly conjured and nearly roared in rage.  Harry ended the illusion spell and pointed his wand at the Minister from a safe distance.
Headmaster Snape tensed up slightly as he watched as the Minister became angrier.
Draco groaned and took an angry bite of toast.
[2 mL] Peppermint Oils
Harry put all the excess ingredients back in their storage cubbies, making sure to put them next to non-reactive ingredients and that all of it was inside the container. Simultaneously, Hermione methodically scrubbed the work table with a cloth imbued with a tumus bene. She scoured the cauldron, table, knives, and other utensils. When Harry got back, they both got out their notebooks to check the assignment. Pulling out parchment, quills, and ink, they outlined their 6-sheave essay since they didn’t have enough time to write the whole paper.
The other time was much, much more terrifying. In 3rd Year, there had been a student in their 7th Year -- a creep named Vivian Penmark -- who had drugged Draco with Amortentia. Harry and Hermione had discovered them in a very, very compromising and very, very illegal position. Draco told Hermione once, late at night, that while she was vomiting, Harry had looked at Vivian dead in the eyes and cocked his head.
She planted a soft kiss on his forehead and patted his cheek.  If anyone else had done that, Harry would have called them patronizing and condescending, but that was just how Hermione was.  To Harry’s embarrassment, the whole situation caught up to him, and he began to cry.  Hermione just hugged him even tighter, and Draco tilted Harry’s head towards him, wiping away Harry’s tears with the pad of his thumb.

Harry then greeted all the adults with a “Blessed Samhain,” thankful he didn’t have to greet them by name -- he couldn’t recall who was who for the life of him.  There were quite a few, and it didn’t help that he was an oddity given how he’d never attended before.  That’s likely why he was invited to the dinner party tomorrow as well.
The table laughed, but Hermione just rolled her eyes at Draco’s dramatics and responded, “You knew this would happen. Since when has Double NEWTS Potions not been in the first block?”
At that moment, making eye contact with the Minister’s dark red eyes, Harry vowed to do whatever it took to take down that man in front of him. Whatever it took. (If a green orb in the Hall of Prophecies glowed even brighter at that thought, well, Unspeakable Larkspur wasn’t going to tell anyone).
"Charmed with
"Drain the pasta," he said, hoping she hadn't heard the hoarseness in his voice. It didn't do to dwell on things he couldn't change, like his social standing and the effect it would have on Cal once it was revealed the boy was a Malfoy. He wasn't foolish enough to believe it would never happen; he just wanted to do as much good with the name as he could before it did. "We're about ready."
immediately in regard to my courtship and subsequent marriage.
"That wasn't what I meant at all, Harry! You'd be a brilliant father. I just meant would you be alright with raising someone else's child," Ron said quickly.
Draco nodded, striding out of the room without a word. He knew he'd been hard to deal with lately, but he was just so frustrated and excited. A tremor ran through him at the thought of finally getting to hold Harry today. The relief was tempered with anxiety over viewing the Pensieve memories. He knew he had no hope of the Gryffindor forgetting the promise he'd extracted a few nights ago.
"Severus," he said again, his voice full of warning.
She snorted, rolling her eyes. "Don't apologize to
Hermione sniffed, clearly skeptical. After all, it sounded like it was all a ploy for gifts. Harry had been frantic yesterday when he hadn't heard back from Draco about a gift, worrying he had offended the man by sending something so trivial. The thank-you owl had come shortly after his panic attack, but the memory worried Hermione. What if Draco didn't think Harry's gifts were worthy?
“Nothing. All thanks to you.”
Two years, Harry thought. Two years and they still look as fresh as the day he got them.
“The heart of the dark forest, Potter. Promptly meet me there.” Malfoy had murmured darkly.
“How sure are you that you want me?”
“Merlin,” Harry cried.
“I know, sorry,” Harry replied, still astounded that he was even here.
He had been told to venture into the middle of the forest because it was out of the way of prying eyes and curious whisperers. But Harry wasn’t sure seclusion was guaranteed here, not with the chance of running into a pack of centaurs or Acromantulas. A shiver rolled down his spine at the thought of Acromantula, but fear streaked him most when his mind came to the likes of werewolves and trolls. Shoving his hands into the pockets of his robes, he remembered why he was here in the first place. Something silky and emerald was wound between the fingers of his right hand deep in his pocket. He had something that did not belong to him, something rather disrespectful towards Gryffindor. Harry passed an ancient-looking oak tree, there was still time to change his mind; he could turn back without anyone ever knowing he had been there.
Hagrid eyed him suspiciously for a moment, but smiled cheerfully and bent to tie up one of the sacks. “Well then, school work is more important. Don’ forget ‘bout me when yer free, though.” and with a wink, he hoisted all three bags and set off towards the castle.
Hermione gritted her teeth, swishing her wand as she completed another favor. They were putting Stasis charms on tiny asters, which would enable the plants to survive until the guests could get them home and plant them. It had been Daphne's idea to give the wedding guests a favor they might actually use, and Neville had grown all 140 plants from seed himself, promising Hermione every single one would bloom into a gorgeous, healthy plant in the fall.
"And, uh, your husband? He's doing well?" Harry asked, desperate to keep his mind of the concoction she was eating.
"Leave it be, Madge-pie," Blaise said as he rounded the corner. Draco could have sighed in relief. "The boss-man must preserve some of his secrets, yeah?"

He looked up as Ron ducked through the door, looking dashing in the black dress robes Harry had chosen for him. Both Ron and Blaise would be standing up for them at the ceremony, but they'd chosen not to have any other attendants. Draco had figured Harry would want a huge wedding party to accommodate all of his friends, but the other man had surprised him yet again, deciding instead to have only Ron and Blaise.
Draco rolled his eyes, focusing on the box he'd just set on his chair. He was a bit reluctant to open any more gifts from Harry after yesterday.
"I'm fine. You didn't need to come home," he chided, pausing to study Freddie's increasingly agitated movements and noises. He'd only been half kidding earlier; she really did seem to need to eat all the time.
"Caleum Alexander Malfoy, please step forward."
"I'm sorry to drop in on you like this," Hermione said with an apologetic smile, "but I found something I thought you should look at straightaway."
He'd hoped to make a fast escape, taking advantage of the short recess Wedgewick called between the new and old business on the agenda to slip away. His plans fizzled when he heard the annoying man call his name, summoning him up to the platform.
Harry caught the bottle Ron tossed at him, testing its warmth against the back of his hand before scooping Freddie out of Hermione's arms and settling on the couch to feed her. He figured it was the safest place to be – they couldn't hex a man holding a baby, could they?
, she thought. She risked a quick pat on his shoulder as she passed, shocked to feel the tension in his muscles. She knew he was taking N.E.W.T.s seriously, but she’d never known
“Merlin, yes,” he moaned, bucking up into her palm as she stroked him through the wool. He lifted a hand to delve under her skirt, delighted to find there wasn’t anything between the tight leather and her skin. “Best study session ever.”
Hermione sat back with a thoughtful look. The writer sounded a bit pretentious, but his interests – and requirements for privacy and solitude – matched Harry's nicely. The bit about children, though, gave her pause.
His smile dimmed slightly, and Ginny wondered what she'd said wrong. Was Draco having second thoughts about going to Ron and Hermione's wedding? Had he decided it would be too awkward?
"I can't expose Cal like that," Draco repeated, but the words sounded less sure than they had before. He knew it was only a matter of time before he buckled to his own desire and agreed to meet with Harry, and he hated himself for his weakness.
are. I've been giving you the same advice for two weeks now, and you keep asking me the same questions."
"Are you ready? They're calling for you," Bill said, poking his head around the door.
," Draco spat, his eyes flashing. "You shouldn't have had this pushed on you. Children, all three of you!"
, Blaise thought, standing to go ask Madge for some tea. Draco was in a mood, which meant it was going to be a long day.
offices angrily would only serve to underscore his warning to the other media outlets. If he were that angry with one of his good friends, what would the great Harry Potter do to a stranger who violated the law? He laughed, remembering yesterday's scene. Luna's tears had looked quite convincing and he'd almost felt bad until he saw her wink at him before she started screaming at him for denying the public the news they deserved to have.
The bride always looked flushed with excitement, but you could tell a lot about how successful the marriage would be by watching the groom. Some didn't watch their wife-to-be walk down the aisle. Others watched, but didn't stare. Weasley, though, watched his bride progress down the aisle like a starving man looking at the only food for miles.
The door swung open before Blaise could reach out for it, and the wizard slipped inside, turning slightly to make sure Draco was following him. The blond's mouth was open to ask another question, though it snapped shut abruptly when the door closed behind him.
Ron shook his head, muttering darkly as he cast spells to bind and gag both men. He needed to get them somewhere secure to interrogate them before something else went wrong. Ron turned quickly when Harry groaned, his wand out again in case Cartwell had come with another accomplice.
"Caleum," Draco said sternly, "We've discussed this. It's better for you to remain in France where you won't be constantly hounded by reporters. You know I love having you at the Manor, and I hate when I have to leave you, but it's for your own good."
"If he sent that Patronus to someone else in the Ministry, then yes," Ron said, his frustration clear. He hated waiting around for Cartwell to make a move, but he knew this was their best shot. "Malfoy would have had this place registered, even if it was under a higher security clearance."
"Oh," she said, unable to figure out what else she should say. Was Draco really here seeking advice about pursing Harry?
They'd chosen not to sleep in the delectable silk pajamas Harry had purchased, preferring as much skin-on-skin contact as they could get to keep the bond happy. Even in sleep, Draco stirred, wrapping an arm tighter around Harry's torso and hooking his foot around Harry's leg.
Draco's lips twitched again, his eyes losing focus slightly as he remembered his mind-blowing wank with Gryffin the night before.
Silver light shot out of Harry's wand, winding around Draco's finger. When he lowered it, the runes that had marked Draco's forehead and chest disappeared, etching themselves in a thin band around his ring finger. The silver tattoo looked just like a ring.
Blaise closed his eyes briefly, nodding. It was likely that news of Cal's existence was spreading already.
"Seriously, though, the silver bond
Harry grinned at Draco's words.
She blushed under Blaise's appreciative stare, absently stroking the back of her hand, still tingling from Draco's kiss.
Draco hesitated, but clicked on the identification number. He keyed in his username and password, giving the site permission to contact the mystery man with Draco's own post. It wouldn't give his personal information, since his was also a high-profile membership, but it would give the man his e-mail address as well as a copy of his own ad.
"Draco," Severus mocked, his tone matching Draco's perfectly.
Ron had been unable to spare Draco from this interrogation, going so far as to file a formal complaint against his supervisor when the man insisted on bringing the Slytherin in. As a result, he had been barred from the interrogation, which may have been a blessing in disguise. Draco wasn't sure he wanted Harry's best friend to have access to him while he was under the influence of Veritaserum.
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. They belong to JKR.
manages to test these out," he said, laughing when George turned an even brighter red. He suspected she used Polyjuice, though that brought up a whole host of other questions. Maybe George wasn't as straight as Harry had always assumed; and Angelina was definitely kinkier than he'd ever suspected.
"Er, want to see my PEZ dispensers?"
Draco called for a house-elf to bring some strong tea and sat down to start writing.
Small lips trembled at the threat, and Draco could see the beginnings of tears in his son's eyes. He had no idea why bedtime had become such a struggle lately, but it was driving him spare. He'd already spent half an hour trying to coax Cal to bed and he was losing his patience.
His composure returned as he made the conscious decision to finish the ceremony, his haughty Malfoy mask falling into place. Harry smiled warmly when he saw Draco's grey eyes shutter and become remote. Most would have been offended, but Harry knew the wizard well enough to know it was simply Draco's way of dealing with his surging emotions. Draco's wand did not shake as he placed the tip against the contract, his voice strong and clear when he spoke.
#11837's
Hermione's eyes narrowed at the rejection, but she straightened and sauntered over to the patch of sand Ron had settled onto to read the paper. Yesterday's news was more alluring than she was, was it? Hermione smirked. She'd change his mind about that.
Kingsley nodded solemnly, waving his wand in an intricate pattern. Harry repeated the pattern, closing his eyes as he felt energy snake around him.
"Moving on?" Harry said quietly, grabbing Draco's hand.
"If there are any here who have legitimate claim to Caleum Alexander Malfoy and who do not wish this bond to continue, please speak now."
I'd make even more money if it came out who you are.
"Ginny, lovely to see you," Harry said pleasantly, enjoying Ron's discomfort at being caught out bad mouthing Slytherins. It wasn't something Ginny stood for these days, even in jest.
Blaise uncrossed his legs and leaned forward in his chair, continuing to look Draco in the eye.

Teddy's grin widened, but he held his hands out in defense. "How could I possibly cheat?"
"Yes," Harry rasped, closing his eyes as he ran a tentative finger down his own chest. He heard Draco gasp, but his satisfied smirk was gone the instant he felt an answering touch trailing down his thigh.
The bit in the kitchen is dedicated to Chi.Z.B. It's swapped from your request, sweets, but it made more sense this way, since it was Harry's kitchen. *grins*
"Ms. Skeeter, why don't you have a go?" Harry said, waiting for Hermione to lift the spell on the woman.
Harry mumbled the incantation to set the ward between them before the temptation to follow the path Draco's fingers had taken with his tongue became too strong. He shucked off his own T-shirt, his hands trembling as he made quick work of his denims and boxers. Draco laughed, an erotic husky sound, when Harry stumbled trying to toe off his trainers, which he'd forgotten about until he'd struggled to escape from the denims pooled around his feet.
"Excellent," Hermione said, narrowing her eyes to take a critical look at Harry's new haircut.
"Could you mention it casually?" she asked hopefully, her eyes traveling to Harry's laptop on the desk, seeking permission. He nodded, and she jumped up, eager to read the latest missive from Harry's anonymous suitor.
Draco chewed thoughtfully, studying his friend's chalky face. Blaise usually recovered quickly from hangovers, and in truth, he hadn't been terribly drunk the night before.
"Draco," Neville said, nodding toward his friend. "Pans."
? Harry wondered, frowning as he wondered if Sly thought the author was attractive. He used an extensive glamour for his publicity shots and his book tours, changing everything about himself. James Evans was his height and weight, since those were beastly to change, but he was blond, with grey eyes and striking features.
Harry sat across from her, his elbows on his knees, studying Hermione's face as she read. She was his agent, but more than that she was his biggest fan, and his toughest critic. If the ending was pants, she'd let him know. Hermione's lips pursed in concentration as she scrolled through the last three chapters of his novel, occasionally reaching out for her mug to take a sip of the strong, sweet coffee Harry had given her. He was just about to jump out of his skin when she finally looked up with a huge smile.
"Your Malfoy mask is slipping, Draco," Blaise said with a grin. "You're falling all over yourself to contact him. I can tell. Go on, then. Do it."
"That obvious?" he asked, his cheeks coloring slightly at his transparency.
The exchange couldn't have taken more than a few seconds, but Draco looked around, panicked.
, Harry thought dryly, embarrassed his body had betrayed his discomfort so visibly.
wrote it."
Harry snorted, kicking Ron under the table. "Like you give Theo a break?"
Draco's heart stuttered, and he could hear the roar of his blood pumping through his veins. It was the only way he knew he was still alive. Because surely –
Draco sat stock still, hoping the Auror might lose his temper and hex him, hit him, anything that might stop him from being compelled to answer. Anything would be better than the torture of revealing his son's existence, of ruining everything he'd worked to keep safe for nearly six years.
"The publishing house asked for a more youthful look," she said, biting her lip as she studied him carefully. "They wanted this latest photo to be hip and sexy."
Draco grinned like an idiot. They'd never discussed Cal taking their name, and he'd thought the boy wanted to keep his Malfoy heritage. He loved his grandmother very much, and Draco was surprised his son was willing to turn his back on her name. She had taken his resignation as Head of House well, but he figured that was only because she put her hopes of reviving the family name on Cal. One glance at his mother proved him wrong; she was beaming, tears streaming down her face as she hugged Blaise.
"How does he feel about kids?"
Ron insisted they eat before tackling Harry's e-mail response, reasoning they would all think a good sight better if they weren't hungry. Harry merely picked at his curry with disinterest, his mind clearly on the anonymous bloke whose post had sounded so perfect. His name and other personal details hadn't been included, and Harry was slightly apprehensive about what that meant. He wasn't sure he wanted to date a high-profile man; he garnered enough attention on his own. What if the man was a professional Quidditch player or something? It would be impossible to stay out of the public eye and date someone like that.
"We didn't court," Ron said softly, knowing what his wife was worried about.
He was prepared to see a physical manifestation of the bond after what happened at the promissory bonding, but Kingsley was still awed to see their auras swirl around them. The silver of the
Harry woke to a tapping on his window. It wasn't even light out yet, and he fumbled for his glasses, casting a quick Tempus before letting the owl in. Just after 3 a.m.
"She's brilliant," he said, leaning in toward Draco. The pair stopped, Draco's grey eyes curious as he saw Nev's goofy smile. "It's a bit early to tell anyone, but I can't stand it. She's pregnant!"
Harry smiled warmly, extending his hand to help Cal walk toward the ice. He absolutely itched to touch Draco – to run a finger down his pinking cheeks, to trace the outline of his perfect lips – but he resisted. The courtship rules were clear. No touching for them today.
Harry grinned, letting Carina down so she could run across the crowded train platform to see Teddy, who was walking toward them. He was a fifth year, and a Slytherin prefect to boot. Cal watched his approach warily, worried his older cousin might take up his dad's case.
turned out well, hasn't he?"
cook naked," he drawled, nodding toward the pancetta and goat cheese frittata.
, he thought, struggling to keep his face blank as he spoke with his godfather.
"The Australian wine guide I consulted said it is best served aged, so I thought you might like to try an experiment," Draco explained, his smirk turning into a smile when Harry still looked perplexed.
Draco glared at his oldest friend, crossing his arms tightly over his chest. "Who's
The music was pounding, and Harry felt faintly dizzy. Perhaps it hadn't been a good idea to drink, considering he'd passed on eating dinner. He swayed slightly, a giggle slipping past his lips as Charlie caught him.
Harry cleared his throat, pressing his wand against the parchment.
Hermione hesitated, worrying her lower lip with her teeth as though debating something with herself. As Harry cocked his head as a silent question, she gave him a small smile.
Harry quirked his eyebrows thoughtfully, spinning to check on his frittata again. Draco licked his lips when Harry's bare arse was on display as he bent to see to it. He carefully lifted the finished egg dish out of the oven, resting it on the range so it could cool.
Draco swallowed hard, steeling himself as a gentle wave of magic washed over him. He straightened his shoulders, his eyes blazing with determination. They were so close to the end – to being engaged. Part of him wanted to throw Harry down right there in front of everyone and do whatever was necessary to satisfy the bond, but a bigger part of him – the part that was a Malfoy – prevented any such lewd display.
Harry smiled as his thoughts returned to the present, watching Luna Transfigure the item. Despite being a member of the media, he knew he could trust her with anything. She was also the most talented among his friends at Transfiguring off-the-wall things, like the PEZ dispenser he'd just given her. Besides, seeing him storm out of the
Neville blinked, trying to make sense out of Ron's words.
"Great. I had dinner at their place last night. She just absolutely glows, and if Theo was any happier I think he'd burst," Blaise said, smiling fondly as he thought of the couple and their tiny, perfect daughter.
Blaise slowed his steps, not enthusiastic about getting in the middle of another Malfoy battle.
When dinner was over, Harry cleared away the plates and brought his laptop out to the kitchen table. Ron slumped in his chair slightly, not quite disinterested, but clearly uncomfortable with the idea of being involved in Harry's love life. Hermione's eyes lit up as she pulled the computer closer to her, reading the automated response to Harry's ad.
, he thought wryly, crouching beside Cal on the floor to gather up some of the scattered crayons. He grinned as he thought about what his father would say if he could see his grandson coloring with the Muggle implements.
"It's a Muggle sweet," Draco answered, studying the item carefully. "Harry collects them. This one is made to look like Justin Timberlake."
He fished under Cal's collar for the medallion the boy had worn for as long as he could remember, his eyes meeting Neville's over the top of Cal's unruly black hair. Neville nodded, placing a hand on Cal's shoulder. This was serious, then. He'd never even seen the safe house the Portkey would take them to, but he knew it was even more heavily warded and protected than the chateau. Merlin himself probably wouldn't be able to find it after all the work Draco and Blaise put into secreting it away.
Draco slipped one of the bracelets around his wrist, shivering slightly as the cold metal snaked around his skin. He tossed the other to Harry, relieved when it crossed the barrier ward without a problem. He grabbed the vial of potion next making sure it was tightly capped before throwing it to Harry as well.
He paused, hoping the Veritaserum would let him stop there. He almost cried out in frustration when he felt the niggling in his brain again.
"I'm not sure, exactly. And I, uh, don't know his name. He's another client like me, so his personal information is kept confidential. We've decided to keep our identities a secret until we know each other better," Harry said, suddenly aware of how silly that sounded.
Harry's eyes flashed defensively. It was easy for Hermione to look down on his attempts at finding a partner; she had Ron. His two best friends had been together for five years – they'd spent a few years after the war dating other people – and they were to be married in three months. It wasn't that Harry wasn't thrilled for them; he was. He was excited to stand in as Ron's best man, excited to see two wonderful people start a new chapter in their lives. He just wanted the same thing.
Draco thought wryly, raising his drink above his head so it didn’t spill as he made his way through the writhing throng of people.
Draco let out a breath he hadn't realized he was holding, looking from Neville to Harry. The other man looked much better than he had a few moments before, but still decidedly sick.
The post wasn't signed, nor did it have contact information appended aside from an identification number. Draco knew what that meant, since his own post was similarly devoid of personal information. Pansy only allowed high-profile clients to be anonymous on the site, and only after she had verified the person's identity and need for secrecy herself. After the verification process, the client was randomly assigned a number and a generic e-mail address. Even if Draco wanted to, he wouldn't be able to wrest the mystery man's identity from Pansy; she swore an Unbreakable Vow with each of these special clients, ensuring their privacy.
He registered the gasps of everyone in the room but Kingsley, though he was focused completely on Draco and the spell they were about to invoke. No one else had known of their intent to pursue the highest level of all wizarding bonds.
"Fine," she said absently, holding her arms out for Freddie. "Just signing some papers to close a deal on a building."
The darker wizard nodded, prodding Theo with his elbow. They managed to hit Potter with another Sobriety spell, and several men Draco vaguely recognized came to help lead the still-disoriented dark-haired wizard and the giggling bridegroom out of the club.
"No doubt," Harry said sourly. "It wasn't my arm I was worried about, at any rate. One of them actually slipped a hand down my trousers!"
Neville laughed softly, his face buried in his wife's hair. They, too, were wrapped around each other, though more decently than Harry and Draco. They darted for the Floo after Kingsley left, headed back to France. Draco had already made plans with his mother and Blaise to watch over Cal for the night, since he wouldn't be returning until morning at the earliest.
"Seamus Finnigan," the man said, crossing his arms again. He didn't look friendly, but Draco didn't think he had any reason to fear for his own safety. "I'm a friend of Harry's. He asked me to be the mediwizard on your case."
Harry tried to look stern, but a grin broke through. He threw a pillow from a nearby chair at Hermione.
The greenhouse – and Draco had to look closely to make sure that really was where they were, since it looked nothing like it normally did – was swathed in a soft glow, the reflection of thousands of twinkling fairy lights shimmering on the glass and the still surface of the small pond at the center of the large enclosure.
“You can wait one more minute, Ronald Weasley!” Lavender shouted, and Ron flinched at the unspoken threat in her words. If he didn’t watch it, the only action he’d be getting after the party was from his own hand.
Harry studied Draco for a moment, nodding as he came to some sort of silent decision.
"He can handle it," Draco assured him, resting his hands comfortingly on his husband's shoulders. "
Seamus and Dean elected to stay as well, leaving Theo and Blaise to help Draco get the two men home. They decided Apparating was too dangerous in their current state – and Draco was too tired to take the lot of them by Side-Along – so they opted to Floo from the Leaky Cauldron.
"He's
"Whatever happens, happens. We've made no promises to each other, aside from discretion. It was just dinner, Hermione, not a marriage proposal."
"They signed the contract with more than just ink," Oliver said, referring to the binding paperwork that signaled a couple's intention to court. Harry and Draco would complete it by signing the marriage contract later in the day. "They left an echo of their magical signatures on the parchment as well. What happened today was their magic recognizing each other. It's a good sign."
Whatever Harry had been about to say in his own defense was stopped by the faint ping that accompanied a new email. His gaze dropped to the screen, and he nearly shouted when he saw an email from Sly.
Blaise hesitated before nodding tightly, his eyes slightly wild at the thought.
"Open it. I want to see what makes it so bloody fantastic that you had to comb every wine shop in London looking for it," Blaise said, picking up his cup of perfectly made tea.
"I don't want to go to bed. Uncle Blaise, tell daddy I don't have to go to bed," the boy whined, turning shining grey eyes on Blaise.
"Is he?" Charlie asked, twisting so he could watch the darker wizard advance across the floor. They'd actually become friends, galvanized by the mortifying experience they'd shared. "Did you invite him?"
The same silver runes appeared on Harry, and Draco touched the tip of his wand, also glowing silver, to the parchment. His vows appeared there as well.
"Just read it, Hermione! The Aurors are found by this Crup, who leads them safely out of the building. After that it's simply a matter of a few diagnostic spells on the wards, which help the team figure out where the baddies are hiding so they can arrest them. Another perfectly cut-and-dried ending for James Evans and his Aurors," Harry said with a smile.
to marry him. He shook his head. He loved Harry like a son, but the man had such an infuriatingly black and white sense of right and wrong. He'd cut off his own leg before letting someone he loved make a mistake, and Kingsley was sure Harry was outlining all of the possible negative consequences of a union between himself and Draco. Of course, that was just Harry.
what you got up to last night,
"Being difficult again?" he drawled, crossing his arms and doing his best to look stern.
Blaise's eyes flickered to Ron, a sparkle of mirth flashing through their somber depths. "Weasley is our king."

"How much did
"Life's not fair, Caleum. Now go to bed before I call your
"Yes," he moaned, his hips bucking as the spells spread pleasurably through him, preparing him for Draco's cock.
Harry barely registered the whispered Lubrication Spell that slicked Draco's cock, his attention focused on the anticipation and desire rushing through him as Draco settled himself between his thighs, fingers raising a trail of gooseflesh in their wake as they ghosted along muscled thighs. Harry shivered, allowing Draco to gently guide his legs up until they were resting flush against the blond's chest, Harry's stocking feet propped comfortably on his shoulders. Draco turned his head slightly, his eyes not breaking contact with Harry's, and pressed a kiss against a tanned calf.
"Know each other, do you?" the wizard crowed, reminding Harry uncomfortably of Professor Slughorn. He hadn't missed the possessive gleam in the man's eyes when he'd addressed him – Wedgewick was definitely another collector. "Of course, of course. Probably see each other down at the club."
Draco read through the post twice, resisting the urge to tick off the compatible interests on his fingers. This bloke sounded nearly perfect to him, and he figured Blaise felt the same way, since the other man hadn't spoken up yet.
Theo tried the incantation again, slamming his wand down on the table in frustration when the parchment on the table in front of him failed to morph into a sapling once again. He’d tried Draco’s visualization technique and all of Hermione’s suggestions, but he couldn’t make it work.

be happening. He slung an arm around Harry's shoulder, steering him toward Theo and Ginny.
, for fuck's sake. Every news outlet in the world would be after that story. I can't see him Blaise, no matter how much I want to. I can't expose Cal like that."
Kingsley shook his head, refusing to release Draco's hand. "Please, call me Kingsley," he said, winking at Harry. "I've heard Harry speak of nothing else for weeks – I feel like we are already well acquainted."
A special thanks to Kamerreon for fixing my errors and soothing my ego throughout MLQ. You helped me think through plot lines and kept my grammar in-line. Thanks!
She nodded, her cheeks flushed.
"I just wanted to know, when you two were … you know, did you ever feel this, I don't know, pulse of energy when you touched?"
Blaise laughed, shaking his head. "A
Harry had been writing his wildly popular Auror series for three years. He started after a bad injury in the field had shaken him up enough to quit the Auror division. Ron thought he was mental; they'd wanted nothing more than to be Aurors for years, and after only five years – two of those spent in training – Harry was walking away.
Ron leaned in even closer, his voice dropping lower.
"Your magic is depleted, which is why you probably feel a bit disconnected from your mind and body at the moment," Seamus said, continuing when Draco nodded slightly. "The headache I'm sure you have should be the only lingering effect from the Veritaserum. We were able to heal your tongue, but there's nothing we can do for a potion-induced headache."
Before any of her friends could answer, Kingsley spoke up.
Draco cut his eyes toward the door, and seconds later Madge knocked and entered, Levitating a tea service for two in front of her.
“Hermione left her robes,” she said, grabbing the black material and stuffing it into her bag as well. Hermione had probably given up studying and headed down to the party herself, and she could give them to her when she saw her.  “I’ll just take them to her, shall I?”
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. They belong to JKR, along with my undying gratitude for introducing us to these two beautiful boys! Thanks again to Kamerreon for the beta!
"It – he shouldn't watch it now," he said carefully, meeting Blaise's eye. "It's important, but it's not something he should have to deal with today. Not with – not with everything else."
"I mean, had I known, I could have saved myself some embarrassment. As it was, I went on and on about how much I adored his work – do you have any idea how bloody mortifying it was when I found out I'd been writing to him all along?"
"Sev," Draco said again, his voice pleading. Harry's fingers were wrapped around his cock, which was quickly filling with blood despite his best efforts to discourage it. He did
"Harry," Teddy said, his deepening voice startling Harry. When had the skinny little boy become a man? He leaned in, returning Cari to his arms and pecking him on the cheek.
"– their son Caleum Potter-Black."
She nodded, her expression still severe even as she buttered his toast and sat the plate in front of him. He gave her a weak smile, reaching instead for the cup of black coffee she'd put down as well.
. Running into Potter and Smith in that restaurant had been a blessing. It had saved him from doing irreparable harm to his family. After all, Potter was hardly the all-powerful savior everyone lauded him as. He couldn't possibly keep news of their relationship out of the paper, or protect Cal if his existence was revealed.
