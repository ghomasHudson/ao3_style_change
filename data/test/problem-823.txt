“Maybe you do.” Astoria sneered. “And maybe, there should be a magical contract in place so that when it’s three am and you’re snoring and the babies are screaming and I’m tired of the dull pureblood-wife life than I won’t cave in a moment of weakness and head back out again.”
Harry groaned in frustration before throwing his arm over his head, trying to figure out what sort of mess he had gotten himself into.
“They need their father more than the world needs its savior. You’re the one who wanted a family so soon, stay home and be with them and leave saving the world up to someone else for once.” Ginny pleaded, her face contorting into a pout as she pushed away from Harry and walked across the room.
Draco felt his heart drop into the pit of his stomach, a brief shock of pain before he swallowed and collected himself “I believe it will just be the three of you tonight” replied evenly.
Harry looked at Draco for a moment, considering the offer before smiling tightly, “It wouldn’t be too weird. I can stay in here.” Harry briefly considered transfiguring the bed into two twins before deciding he was too tired to attempt it and instead got into bed and putting a hand on Draco’s arm, slowly rubbing his hand up and down in an attempt to lure Draco to sleep. It must have worked, because quickly after lying down Harry heard a faint snore come from Draco’s side, and he smiled and quickly fell asleep himself.
“I’m not involved, but neither is he. They told me they didn’t currently have any evidence against me, but now I’m suspended during the investigation and Jacob is sitting in jail.” Harry’s face started to crumple, the anger dropped off and he said quietly “Why don’t you just move on and let me be happy?” Harry turned and left the room, leaving Draco leaning heavily against the wall, feeling completely and utterly alone.
Draco nodded his head before heading back, peering cautiously into the rooms. He walked into one of the rooms to lie down and Harry sighed in relief as he watched him. Sure, Gin was going to murder him for not coming home, but at least for now his charge was someplace safe and maybe he could get some rest too soon.
Draco nodded his head once, before taking a quick breath. “Thanks. I doubt I’ll need to, but it’s good to know.”
Harry lost all control, grabbing at Draco's hair and fucking himself into Draco's wet mouth. He finally let up with a long groan as his cock emptied into Draco's waiting mouth. Harry watched as Draco swallowed before pulling off Harry's cock and turning.
“But, don’t you think it’s kind of odd? Like, I get why you’re rushing into this. You want the world to forget about the article and see you from a different perspective. But what’s she getting out of all this? Who wants to marry a guy who was just outed to the whole of wizarding Britain as Harry Potter’s evil ex? I mean, I know it’s not true but does she?” Ron fidgeted a bit, trying to avoid eye contact. “Should you really be rushing into marrying this girl when you don’t even know the reason she’s agreeing to it?”
“Are you sure this is what you really want Draco? I’ll admit, when you asked me to lunch I hadn’t expected it to be eaten two floors above your ex boyfriend’s hospital room.” Astoria smiled encouragingly at him, “Are you sure you’re really ready to marry someone else?”
After hours of flying Draco was sore and hungry, and since he had skipped breakfast he decided it was time to find some food. Touching down outside of a village, Draco shrunk his broom and shoved it into his pocket before searching for a restaurant.
Draco snorted, “I’m sure. This one hour raid that’s dragged on for almost two weeks is definitely almost drawing to a close.” He stopped and gave Harry a withering look, “They wouldn’t be bringing in outside help if they were close to solving this Potter.”
They’d settled into a bit of a routine, Draco would usually wake up first and shower and get ready, and then he would cook breakfast while Harry got ready. After breakfast they would usually receive a request from Ron or Head Auror Robards asking for some information or on one occasion some of Draco’s hair. Then after finishing whatever they needed to work on they would read or write or make stilted conversation. They tried to reminisce about Hogwarts days, but unsurprisingly they didn’t have many memories that were positive for both of them. Quidditch was a safe topic, though Draco seemed to have caught on early on that discussing Ginny’s team was not a good idea. Harry tended to make lunch, and afterwards they would play wizard chess or a card game. They would trade-off on making dinner, then usually they would receive a report for the day from the Ministry and Harry would work to write-up his report. His reports were short and repetitive, but it helped to remind him that this was just an assignment and not his new life.
“Astoria. I’m so sorry I forgot about lunch. There was an emergency with Harry and I needed to fill out some forms.” Draco said hurriedly. He looked around and Hermione had looked up from her books and was glaring at them, while Ron was eying Astoria suspiciously. “Can I buy you lunch from the Cafeteria? I would like for us to talk.” Draco pleaded.
Harry gave Draco a bewildered look, “But we are chasing a criminal. She killed multiple families. They’re going to bring her to justice for that.”
Harry slowly started to sit up, and glanced over at Draco’s bed, which was already made and was empty. Looking at the bed made Harry flash back to the previous night. He’d kissed Draco, passionately. He’d called Draco by his name. He’d gotten so drunk that he’d kissed this man and not even thought about his wife. Ginny. Harry’s mind flashed at the thought of her. She’d filed for divorce. He’d been drinking because his wife, the mother of his two children, his best friend’s sister had decided she didn’t want to be married to him anymore. Harry’s heart ached, he thought about the Weasleys, his family. He couldn’t imagine what life would be like without Sunday night dinners at the Burrow, without Molly’s sweaters, without his huge extended family.
Draco’s voice turned bitter, his nostrils raising in a snarl. “I promise. Things are over with Harry. I don’t even recognize the man he is right now. I’m realizing now that I didn’t really know him at all.” Draco spat.
Harry smiled lightly at Draco. They didn’t say anything else to each other as they sat waiting for the clock to strike eight, but they also didn’t release each other’s hands.
“Now Draco,” Narcissa stared as she seated herself in the lounge, “What happened between you and Astoria?”
“Draco, two visits in one week my dearest? Are you ill?” Narcissa floated through the parlor to wrap Draco in a light hug as he exited the floo.
Ron turned around in anger, grabbing his bag roughly off the ground and storming to the door. As he turned the handle he glared back at Harry, "I thought you were better than this." He said coldly before slamming the door.
“It matters, because he went to the bloody press calling this a witch hunt by a disgruntled ex-boyfriend.” Krones shot back as he threw the morning’s prophet at Draco.
“We’ve never gone out for a pint just the two of us. We’ve gone just the three of us, but never just you and me. Where’s Hermione?” Draco asked suspiciously.
Draco was so nervous for dinner, he almost canceled on Harry twice. Harry had made reservations for the finest wizarding restaurant in London, a place Draco had only ever been to once with his father when he was younger. He’d surprised himself, asking Harry to cancel the reservation and make on somewhere in muggle London instead. Though Draco appreciated the gesture of being seen in by Wizard society, he wasn’t sure what this dinner was. He fidgeted with his silver tie, trying to make it lay flat against his navy button down top. Draco had worn much less muggle clothing since the breakup, and it surprised him that he’d actually missed it.
They landed with a thud on the cold forest ground, the force of their landing pulling them apart. Harry jumped up quickly, pointing his wand at a disoriented Draco before Draco could even process their landing.
"I. Uh. Merlin" Harry closed his eyes and gulped, "I want you Draco." Harry's denial wouldn't make it through his lips as he saw the blond beneath him.
“This has the best chance of success. We’ve tried all the other methods to control him, but they’re not working. This is the best chance we have to save his life.”
“I was happy. I just didn’t want them to turn our love into something it wasn’t. You know what they do, they would take the fact you were a death eater, and that I was the bloody chosen one, and that we hated each other in school. They would run columns wondering if I was under the imperious, or wondering if I was turning dark. It would be a circus and it wasn’t any of their business. I just don’t want to be in the papers, I don’t want to be the Boy Who Lived anymore. I just want to be Harry Potter, Auror extraordinaire and boyfriend of Draco Malfoy, the best damn barrister the Ministry has ever seen. I don’t want to open my life up to their commentary.”
"Thanks." Draco looked at Harry for a moment, "It doesn't mean you're gay you know. If you're worried about that."
“It was supposed to give the taker the same sort of giddy feeling as Felix Felicis. It’s fascinating really, on a biological level it appears to drastically spike oxytocin and dopamine levels in the brain. Though the potion wouldn’t give the drinker any luck like real Felix Felicis, it would definitely decrease impulse control. Any thought or feeling they would feel would be acted on immediately on instinct. They also think the Ashwinder egg could have helped amplify feelings, making them stronger than they would normally be. The repeated use of the potions damaged the pathways in Harry’s brain and harmed his prefrontal cortex and his hippocampus. His emotions went haywire and he really lost most of his reasoning skills. He would have been really easy to influence.”
“It appears that he thought Harry was getting suspicious of him and the work he was doing for the smuggling ring and he wanted to try to smooth things over and distract him. He also had a bit of a crush on Harry and he says he let things go farther than he’d planned.”
Pansy rolled her eyes “That’s fine. I’m going to go find you an apartment. Meet me in my office at 4 and I’ll take you to your new home.”
Harry stared at the clock, wishing time would speed up and bring him closer to the weekend. The air felt thick in his office despite the charm that was supposed to mimic an ocean breeze; the two o’clock slump was hitting him hard. Harry shook his head, and then looked down at his parchment, tapping his quill lightly against the top of his shared desk. No matter how long Harry stared down at his report, he could not make the words flow. Claire, Harry’s partner and office-mate, had long since finished her paperwork and headed off to the core of the department in search of something new to work on or someone fun to gossip with.
Ron frowned at that, “You need to talk to her. There’s… There’s something really important that you two need to get figured out. You haven’t signed the divorce papers yet, right?”
Harry caught up with Draco as he stood looking wildly around what used to be Daphne’s grand home. Harry quickly cast an augmenti, and set about dosing the remaining flames as Draco searched through the wreckage, hope and fear waring through him with each step he took. When Draco was far enough away, Harry cast a quick
Draco pulled his head out of the fire and starting dusting off his clothes. Looking down, he realized it might be time to clean up a bit. Draco pulled off his clothes and lay them on the bed, he then took out his wand and de-wrinkled his outfit, then cast a quick cleaning charm on them. Finally, Draco walked into the bathroom to take a shower, clean his teeth, and try and organize his thoughts.
"Not me," Blaise said with a grin, "But I think you might have a good chance. This," Blaise slowly started stroking Draco's dick, "hasn't gone down since Potter walked in. In fact, I'd say it's even harder."
Harry pulled Draco towards him, pressing their foreheads together, “Tell me no if you don’t want this.”
Draco shot Harry a scathing look, “oh sure. A ten month old boy is missing and the home he was staying in was burned to the ground, and all that constitutes is a bloody letter.” Draco stood and approached Harry menacingly, ice raging in his eyes. Draco shoved Harry into a wall, getting right up into his face. “Tell me Potter,” he spat, “do all missing children receive this level of disinterest or only the children of ex Death Eaters?”
Draco skimmed over the contract some more before looking up at his mother again, “There’s a prevision for affairs in here? At what point and under what context they’re acceptable? What is this?”
Harry stared ahead at the beige house before him, scouring the windows for any sight of Draco’s bright blonde hair, “It’ll be soon. Once we see Malfoy we give the signal to the rest of the teams and we immediately go and take him. As soon as we see him we’ll be too busy to worry about anything, and before you know it everything will be over and we can go home and go to sleep.”
Harry blinked at him before answering, "Just thought it'd be good to work with someone new, and you looked free." Harry smiled lamely.
Draco stared at Harry furiously, "I don't have to explain my sex life to you Potter, but if you're really that concerned I can assure you they were all received while I was an eager participant."
Draco looked at her in confusion, “I suppose not. I never had any siblings, but I imagine it’s not the worst thing I could subject a Malfoy heir to.” Draco attempted to smile.
Draco stood there in shock for a moment before looking at Astoria and saying carefully“If you wish to proceed, nothing could make me happier”
Ron had begrudgingly agreed to check on Draco every few days to make sure there wasn't anything he needed. Harry felt guilty he hadn't had a free moment to check in with Draco himself, but knew he needed to focus on his kids at the moment.
Draco carded his hands though Harry’s hair, tensing slightly as Harry started to unbuckle his trousers. As Harry inched Draco’s trousers and pants down Draco’s legs, he ran his cheek along Draco’s hard cock, before looking up at Draco and whispering, “I’ve missed you so much,” before wrapping his mouth around Draco’s tip and sucking lightly.
Despite his assurances, Harry was getting nervous about the length of time they had spent waiting to hear from Robards. He wished he could risk floo calling, but knew that if something had gone wrong he could put Draco at risk by contacting the ministry. As time continued to pass, Claire slowly drifted off on the side of the couch while Harry and Draco stared ahead blankly.
“Can we be completely crazy and have a bottle of wine with dinner?” Ginny said conspiratorially, her eyes sparkling.
Draco paused, eyes flickering about the room before looking to the ground. “She may be staying with her lover.” He stated quietly, jaw clenched.
Draco pulled Harry’s hair tightly, a small prickling in his brain tell him this was a bad idea, which he promptly ignored. Tightening his grip in Harry’s hair slightly, Draco pulled Harry’s head up as he lowered his own until their faces were just centimeters apart. Finally, Draco licked his lips slowly before lowering his head slightly more in a tentative kiss, touching his own lips to Harry’s.
Draco's eyes flared, "I don't care if you fucking believe me or not. Kill me for all I bloody care. But I need my son safe." He stopped struggling against the ropes, kneeling on the ground, white hair falling over downcast eyes "Potter, please," Draco choked, "you have kids. You understand. I need to know he's safe."
Draco continued to look at Harry strangely for a moment before a slight grin came over his face. "Right then, good plan. Let's get started." Draco said cheerfully as he began to roll up his sleeves.
After distributing out small bouquets to everyone in his office, Draco sat down to write Harry a note.
Draco let out a dry, humorless laugh, “Oh? Is that right? Everyone has just forgotten who I was, and now they just see me as this poor father, trying to get his son back from his murderous lunatic of a wife?”
The head Auror laid out the case, and assigned the teams to their positions through the raid. “Potter, Sparks,” Robard’s called to Harry and Claire, “You’ll be in charge of apparating our informant out of harm’s way. His testimony is what is going to put these arseholes in Azkaban. It is imperative that you extract him cleanly, before any crazy spells start flying.”
“I’ll just be in the bedroom reading, come say goodbye before you leave will you, Potter?” Draco asked before turning and walking off.
Harry grabbed some floo powder off the mantle before throwing it in the fire, heading back to the ministry and preparing for the long night ahead.
"I just..." Harry stopped, struggling to find the words to continue. He stared at Draco's chest, covered in crisscrossed scars. Harry followed the map of scars down, to where he noticed two sickle sized bruises on Draco's hipbone. Harry gulped loudly, his mouth suddenly dry, "I just wanted to make sure you're okay."
Harry groaned and put his head in his hands, "We're getting along worse than ever. I think she's starting to hate me, and I'm honestly so frustrated by her. And I'm just feeling so guilty, I would never have done what I did with you if I didn't think I was getting a divorce."
Ron nodded cordially, putting his hand out to shake. Draco took it, watching Ron’s face skeptically. They briskly shook before dropping their hands again, and Ron came around on the couch sitting down on the far cushion. Harry briefly considered taking his place back on the middle cushion, but instead sat down in a chair across from the couch. Draco stood, straightening his trousers nervously.
Draco sighed and took a sip of his wine, leaning back against the cool comfort of the couch “I don’t know Pans. I thought we were good. I thought we were happy. Suddenly, I come home and he tells me I didn’t miss him enough or love him enough and he’s moved on with someone else.”
Draco looked at Harry pleadingly, “Were we? I keep wondering, if we were really so happy why was it so easy for you to believe that I didn’t care at all? Why was it so easy for Jacob to convince you that he loved you more than I did? Why was it so easy to go to the press and say all those terrible things about me when you wouldn’t even go into wizarding public with me for fear that the press would see us together?”
“Not real fights. Not really. I thought you just wanted to go to fancy places. I didn’t realize you thought I was ashamed to be with you.”
“Please” Kathryn sat down with a smile. When Draco had handed her the tea she took a sip and then sat back and started “I’m here about the Parsons case. My client wants a deal, and I was told you’re the prosecutor in the case”
Harry continued to stand there awkwardly his face flushing, “… Well. I… Yeah… No. I mean, no, I haven’t tried it before.”
They landed on a dark street in a magical neighborhood, the first hints of sunrise peeking out in the horizon. Harry held his wand in front of him, trying to get his bearings in the unfamiliar neighborhood while Draco got his footing after the unexpected apparition. The air was thick with smoke, and in their disoriented state it took them a minute to find the source. Harry turned slowly and saw the plot behind him smoldering, small flames remaining in the wreckage of what was earlier that night a home.
with other team's seekers. Harry flew high to search for the snitch, circling the pitch lazily, he kept one eye on Draco the whole time.
Harry gripped Draco’s shoulder lightly, “I’m sorry, Malfoy. I was just trying to help. Finish your list and I’ll make us some lunch.”
"I get it," Draco said gently. "It’s a lot to process going from getting a divorce to having a baby."
The healer looked annoyed but cleared his voice and started talking anyways, “very well. Auror Potter is going through sever withdrawals from an unknown potion. It’s making him paranoid and frantic and he’s starting to show large displays of accidental magic. We gave him suppressants and put dampeners in his room, but it doesn’t appear to be enough. We worry his magic might lash out and hurt himself. We need permission to put him in a magical coma.”
Draco finally released Harry’s cock and laid his head down on Harry’s thigh, his heart beating out of his chest.
“I’m sorry. They sound close though, and they’re going to bring in the Unspeakables. We should be out of here by the end of the week.” Harry said hopefully, trying to keep his voice cheerful.
Draco shuddered softly in mock horror, “That’s completely intolerable. That’s what I can do! I’ll create a scotch distillery in America. Drauphnir’s Distilled Spirits. Has a bit of a ring to it right?”
Draco nodded his head before leaning back wearily on the couch. Though still terrified for his son, the adrenaline was starting to fade from his system and be replaced with exhaustion. Looking at the clock on the wall, Draco saw that it was almost 8 am, he'd been awake for 27 hours and could feel his body shutting down.
Draco shook his head, opening his mouth lightly and blowing a cool stream of air onto Harry's heavy erection before pushing forward and swallowing Harry back to the root.
“I didn’t want to!” Draco was almost screaming at his point “I didn’t get go looking for this Harry. I was doing my job, responding to the deal I was asked to consider, and you decided to splash my face all over the fucking news. The only reason your boyfriend is in jail is because he’s a dirty Auror. I wouldn’t have even been at that Gala with Astoria if YOU hadn’t have blasted me to the press. What do I need to do? Do you want my memories? I’ll give them to you if it means you will realize this wasn’t some elaborate scheme”
“Yes, but I’m sure they have it there right? Fire whiskey, scotch, pumpkin juice? The drinks won’t be that different right?” Draco asked.
“Draco.” Adrian started, saying his first words since Draco had first sat down at the table, “You’ve been in love with Potter since you were 12 and couldn’t get enough of chasing each other on your brooms. I don’t think you could ever figure out how to love anyone other than him.”
Harry looked up, his eyes briefly meeting Draco's before turning away, "With anyone. Actually." He said shyly.
Harry rolled his eyes, then tried to answer with slightly slurred speech, “It's a magically hidden house. I would have had to give someone the address for them to break in, and since it's my house and they had my permission they're not really breaking in are they? ‘sides. It's just me.” He looked down morosely into his drink.
Fleetingly, Harry had hoped that his weeks apart from Draco would have helped to quell his feelings for the blond. Instead, seeing the warm way his children ran to Draco and embraced him sent a shiver through Harry's body. Feelings of love rushed through Harry's veins, and he questioned how he'd been able to stay away for so long.
“Draco, darling, what are you doing calling in the middle of the morning?” Pansy asked surprised as Draco’s face illuminated her grate.
Draco looked up to see Harry biting his lower lip, eyeing Draco and Blaise appraisingly, his trousers tenting obviously.
“Yeah, sure, cause those are easy to come by. It’ll be super easy to find a Secret Keeper while I’m here pretending to be under arrest.”
They sat in silence for a few minutes, Draco slowly sipping his scotch and Harry writing a quick recap of the day for his report. Draco smiled at Harry, “I wonder what the scotch tastes like in America.” Draco mused.
Ginny chewed her lip fretfully before looking up at Harry, “I don’t like it. You going off and me being stuck here with the boys, worried about you.”
“I know that over the years you two have been concerned by my lack of commitment to the future. Yesterday, Harry accused me of not moving on, and I realized he’s right. I think it’s time for me to get married.”
“This case was brought to me. I tried to recuse myself as soon as I realized you were involved. I didn’t believe that you would be a part of this, but I didn’t want any part in the case against you.”
Draco closed his eyes and took a drink of his beer. “I’ll do that. Thank you, Ron, you’ve been surprisingly insightful.”
Unfortunately for Harry, there was little to distract him from his thoughts; which he noticed were more and more focused on Draco. He thought about the conversations they had had; the stilted conversations at the beginning of their confinement and the open, emotional ones of more recently. Harry thought about the affection he saw in Draco’s eyes when Draco talked about his son. He thought about the way Draco bit his lip while he was focusing in chess, or how he would blow his hair out from his eyes while reading instead of moving his hands up and pushing the hair out of his face. Most disturbingly of all, Harry found himself thinking of the way that Draco’s lips had felt against his own.
. Happy? But it shouldn’t have happened, and I apologize for my lapse in judgement and I will make sure to never do it again!”
Draco took a step back, “I do not love you!” He hissed. “And you don't love me either. This thing between us, it's sex. It's fun, it's convenient. Call it stress relief, or exercise, or something to pass the boredom, but it's certainly not love!”
So I realize I said that things would cheer up, and I really did mean that. It just hasn't really happened yet. I promise, there's a resolution to this story coming, and hopefully all the angst will be worth it. Thank you for sticking with me through this, and the next two chapters are going to move things along much faster than the last couple of chapters have.
Daphne looked at Draco with exasperation, and started like she was speaking with a small child “You don’t love her Draco. And she doesn’t love you. You can’t marry her.”
“Mr. Weasley. There is no question that Auror Potter is facing severe damage from regularly ingesting a currently unknown potion for a long period of time. The only question here is if Mr. Malfoy is willing to give us permission to put him in a medical coma and have the best chance of healing him or not.” The healer said angrily.
Harry woke the following morning earlier than normal, and was done showering by six. He wandered into the kitchen, intent to make Draco breakfast like Draco had done for him so often. He pulled out the ingredients for blueberry pancakes and bacon, and quickly got to work. By the time Draco awoke, the entire house smelled of breakfast and Harry was just finishing plating their meals.
Three ales later the game was over and Draco was still no closer to going to see Harry. Instead, Draco paid his tab and headed outside, walking off into the distance until he was sure no one would see him and apparating to Malfoy Manor.
Meeting baby Rose went much better than Draco had feared. Though there was an entire parade of Weasleys, apparently Draco had managed to visit after Harry had left. Hermione looked exhausted, but she gave Draco a hug before allowing Ron to proudly show off their new girl. After extracting a promise that Draco would come visit after work on Monday, they allowed Draco to head off so they could get some rest.
Ron shrugged, leaning back on the couch. "So did you guys get your stuff moved back in?" He asked absently.
He tried reading, but couldn’t find the ability to focus. Ginny was leaving him. She’d sent him divorce papers. Sure, forsaking all others was listed in their vows but he was pretty sure that became null as soon as one person wanted out of all the vows to begin with. His heart was racing, and all he wanted to do was walk into the bedroom and kiss Draco again, taste him. Harry looked over at the desk, his divorce papers staring at him, haunting him.
Draco dropped the subject, but was obviously still upset. Harry didn’t blame him, but there wasn’t much he could do about it. He’d been honest with Draco, the ministry obviously wasn’t rushing to bring him home and that was a bit surprising. Though he’d never asked for special treatment, he had never imaged that he’d be trapped for two weeks away from his family with his in-laws raising his kids for him.
Ron smirked at him, “I’ve spent more than half of my life around Hermione, it had to rub off somewhat. I just hope she’s having as good of luck talking with Harry.”
Adrian smiled at Daphne, squeezing her hand and giving her a kiss on the cheek while Pansy rolled her eyes. “How’s life been going for you Draco?” Daphne asked brightly.
The next morning Draco awoke in a funk. He was angry at his conversation with Harry the previous day, knowing that he should turn Harry in for his completely unprofessional behavior. More than angry through, Draco was hurt that Harry thought he would abuse his position so much just to see Harry’s lover imprisoned.
Draco chuckled, moving his hands to start undoing the buckle of Harry's jeans, “isn't that what the monitoring spell was for? We just need to be fast.”
Three weeks after Lily was born, things seemed to calm down. Though she was still fussy, she cried much less. Harry and Ginny were both able to get around six hours of sleep a night, and they finally started to feel better.
“That would be helpful. Thank you. So three months ago, that would be late February? Did you notice any changes in Auror Potter’s personality at that time?”
“Hello Mother. Not exactly.” Draco said as he walked in, “I just took the day off to do some thinking and thought I’d come and visit you.”
“He wasn’t interested in fixing things. He’s…. seeing…. He’s already found a new partner” Draco paused while Pansy sucked in a breath and drew him in closer.
"I've been so scared, Harry. I thought I'd never see you again. I wondered, even, if you had died and Ron just wasn't willing to tell me.
Head Barrister Krones stared at Draco in shock. He looked like Draco had just told him he liked to murder kittens in his spare times. For the six years Draco had worked in the Ministry Legal Department they had never discussed their personal lives. “Thank you for informing me Barrister Malfoy. I can remove you from the new case which your original case has created, but I need to ask you if you are able to stay impartial in the original case long enough to appear before the judge to enter the plea. You already signed the paperwork, and if we try to assign a new prosecutor now he has to write a new statement and provide new memories.”
“Harry.” Draco started again, “I know it wasn’t all your fault, but that doesn’t change things. It’s been three months since you broke up with me. Three months that I’ve had to figure out how to live without you. Three months to think about everything that was wrong in our relationship.”
Harry looked at Draco confused, “Did you used to give head rubs often?” he asked, before quietly beginning to hum in contentment as Draco rubbed right above his ear.
Draco laughed dryly, his eyes dark, “Who would have thought ten years ago that you and I would be stuck living in a safe house in seclusion together?”
Before Harry or Ginny could object Lily was gone and the house was completely silent. They looked at each other slightly bewildered.
Laughing Harry put his hand on Draco's, “Actually, I came to talk about Astoria's case. I got a notice yesterday that the defense put in a motion to suppress testimony. Now there's a hearing on the motion, scheduled for next week, when the trial is supposed to begin. So there's going to be a delay in the actual trial. I thought you should hear about it in-person.”
“Have you seen the healer yet?” Astoria asked as she sat down, her eyes flickering to Harry’s letter in his hands before narrowing slightly.
Draco threw the door open to see Harry’s Auror partner Jacob Compton thrusting deep inside of Harry’s ass. “Get out of my house” Draco’s voice was like ice, drawing both men’s attention to the door.
“See?” Draco exclaimed suddenly, “We weren’t as happy as we pretended to be. We had problems and instead of fixing them we just pretended they didn’t exist”.
“When you told me you had been romantically involved with the partner of a suspect, you neglected to mention the partner was Auror Potter” Head Barrister Krones barked out as soon as Draco had walked in to room.
Draco let out a laugh and Harry started to smile as well. “So, you never responded to my letter yesterday.” Harry said.
Harry walked over to his own fallen broom and picked it up, walking slowly to the locker room behind Draco. When Harry arrived Draco was already in the shower, and Harry walked over to try and apologize again.
Draco rolled his eyes, “I accept your apology Potter. Though, it is my fault that your marriage is breaking up in a way. If I hadn’t asked for you to be guarding me that day, you wouldn’t be the one stuck here with me and your wife wouldn’t be upset.”
Theo and Blaise raised an eyebrows and looked at Draco, but Draco didn't even stop, "Can't. Sorry. Banned for life. Turns out they don't take kindly to using unforgiveables on the staff there." He said dismissively, head facing down.
“Next year?” Draco’s eyes bulged, “It’s June! That’s eighteen months! That’s longer than Scorpius has been alive! Are you saying he’s going to have his first birthday party trapped in a one bedroom safe house that’s being shared with one random Auror or another?”
“Any way. Any way you want me Draco.” Harry squeezed Draco’s arse cheeks firmly, pushing Draco against him.
Ron frowned, "I've made do. Read a bit, kipped on the couch mostly. I tried the crossword in the Daily Profit but I'm no good at it. The ferret's stayed in his room most of the time, though he's came out and cooked us each food a couple of times a day, so I'm pretty sure he's still alive. I'm not sure how you kept sane here for an entire month alone."
Draco looked down at his drink “It was a difficult day. It’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about”
Harry closed the gap, his arm going behind Draco’s back and pulling them together. They kissed in a way that Harry was quickly becoming addicted to. He felt Draco conform to him, his arms going up around Harry’s neck pulling their faces together. Draco’s tongue invaded Harry’s mouth, and he felt his body tense in arousal.
“Mr. Malfoy” The healer reached out his hand, “Thank you for coming so quickly. We need you to make a couple of decisions. Can I speak with you privately to apprise you on the case?”
Harry smiled, “Anytime Malfoy. I think it was very brave of you to give us the information we needed to help save those families.”
Harry followed her, trying to give her a kiss before she turned her head, presenting her check to his lips instead, “I’m sorry Gin. We can talk about it tomorrow but tonight I have to go. I love you, I love the boys, and I’ll see you in the morning.”
Harry looked at the note in his hand and tried to breath. Rolling his eyes at Ron’s code, Harry shoved the note in his pocket and went to wake up Draco.
As the door swung open Harry ushered Draco into the brightly lit living room that was revealed. Though cold and rainy outside, the living room was bright and inviting; the walls were tall and painted a warm gold with burnt orange moldings. The floor was solid oak, with deep brown and maroon furniture. Harry felt the tension release from his shoulders as the door swung closed behind him.
Harry landed back on the cliff side with a heavy heart. He'd had an emotional week, after his first talk with Ginny. The boys had gone to Grimmauld, and he was able to enjoy their sweet smiles and laughs. They'd played together, he'd read them stories, and he'd gotten to stay the night in their room as they drifted off to sleep.
I mean, sure, you might hate me for what I did to Draco. And that's fair. But you gotta be impressed I put 3 years into 1 chapter, right? I could have drawn that out for 5 chapters till everyone forgot about Draco entirely.
Ginny closed her eyes and took a deep breath, “I can’t talk more right now Harry. I’m not saying it’s forever, I’m just saying until we talk this is best.”
Harry looked down quickly before looking back up at Draco, “I haven’t taken it off since you gave it to me Draco. It’s one of the favorite things that I own.” Harry looked nervous, “Do you not want me to wear it anymore?”
Harry pulled him closer, “I love you Draco, and I’ll wait forever if you need me to in order for you to trust me again. I promise Draco, Forever.” Harry whispered hoarsely.
Draco chuckled nervously, “Forgive me for asking. It’s just… My name was splashed all over the prophet last week and I am currently probably the most hated wizard in the country. I’m an ex death eater, my family is in disgrace, and my ex is the most beloved man in the Wizarding world and he’s telling everyone that I’m scum. Why would you want to marry someone like that?”
Harry smiled, the thought of his sons making his heart soar. “Yeah. That’ll be good. I miss them.” His eyes got far away for a moment before his face darkened again. “I just think it’s ridiculous that she decided to file for divorce without trying to talk to me, but now suddenly she wants us to talk.”
Draco sneered, “No, you were only willing to tell the newspapers about me when you were telling them how I ruined your life and vastly abused my position with the ministry. You made me a pariah all over again, because you couldn’t be honest and let the world know about me.”
As Draco watched his wand sail into Harry's hand, he let out a screech, "Potter, what the bloody hell was that and what do you think you're doing?!"
Harry grabbed Draco's shoulder and focused all his magic on the anti-apparation wards he had earlier placed. The second he felt the wards begin to crack he pulled Draco and himself past, hurling them from the safehouse and into the darkness.
Draco moaned, releasing himself into Harry, which pushed Harry over the edge. As Harry came, he fell against Draco’s chest, “Love you.” He muttered, placing frantic kisses against Draco’s cheek.
"No." Harry said firmly, "I didn't save his life in the room of requirements just to watch people hurt him now."
“A deal?” Draco pulled the file from his inbox and opened it with interest. He had just received it that morning, and hadn’t had a chance to review the case yet.
Draco let out a laugh, "That's great! I'm glad you got to see them." He grew quiet for a moment, like he was trying to build up courage for his next question. "How’s the wife?" He asked quickly, his eyes darting away.
“Really?” Draco let out a harsh laugh, “It was Weasley’s idea that you should issue a betrothal contract to the family of the guy who just
Draco closed his eyes, drowning in ecstasy as he ran his hands along Harry’s back, clutching the firm body that was so familiar but at the same time felt almost new to him. “I never thought I was going to get to feel you again.” Draco panted as he broke away from the kiss.
Harry looked over at Draco, his eyes clouding over, “I don’t really want time to myself, thanks. If you want to do it that way we can, but don’t feel like you’re doing me any favors by leaving me alone in a flat that’s way too big for just me.”
Draco closed his eyes, taking deep breaths before looking at Harry’s intent face, “I know that now Harry. I know it wasn’t all your fault.”
Harry felt his blush flush all the way up to his ears, "I see. Well... I'm sorry for interrupting." Harry turned to run before he was suddenly halted.
Draco looked over cautiously, “I can’t ask that of you. You’ve been here enough, and your family needs you”
By the time Harry had showered and changed and made it into the living room, the pounding in his head had marginally reduced. Draco was sitting on the couch with a book is his hands, though the tension in Draco’s face made Harry doubt Draco was actively reading.
Draco looked up sheepishly “I was actually out of the country at the time on a case. We didn’t really get a chance to speak frequently enough for me to notice. When I came home it was nearly a month later and we’d broken up. Do you really think Harry’s current condition is relevant to your investigation?”
Draco didn't respond, instead ignoring Harry's outstretched hand and pushing himself up before heading over to grab his broom from where it had fallen.
Astoria laughed and kissed Draco again, holding him close as they heard the click of cameras beside them.
"You invited The ferret to go to Hogsmeade with us?! Are you barmy?" Ron asked that night back in the common room.
Ron turned to face the door, wand raised on alert. His mouth turned into a soft smile when he saw Harry before he quickly replaced it with a cold look. “The moon looks very round today.” He said loudly, using the identification phrase that all Aurors knew.
The next morning Draco did not expect to see the media hailstorm that was awaiting him in the courtroom. He wondered lightly who had tipped the press off that something important was about to happen, but based on the tone of the reporters he was pretty sure that they didn’t know exactly what to expect. Draco hoped they already had everyone in custody they needed, because there was no way this was going to avoid being front-page headlines. The judge called for order, and Draco worked on auto-pilot, answering the questions of the judge. While the defendant was reading his statement into the record, Draco tried to create a mask of controlled indifference on his face. He heard the deep intake of breath as Harry’s name was mentioned, and he knew that leaving court through the main door would be near impossible.
Harry wasn't sure what response he was expecting from Draco when he told him that Scorpius was with Astoria, but climbing out of bed and heading to the kitchen in search of a liquor cabinet wasn't it.
“Then what exactly did dearest Ronald say Harry? Be careful, your next sentence could determine if sweet baby Rose gets to grow up with or without a father.” Draco’s eyes shined like venom as he spoke.
"How's everything been here?" Harry asked nervously. He was very confident that if Draco had made Ron privy to what the two of them had gotten up to the previous week that Ron would not have greeted him so casually, but he was still a bit anxious about it.
Harry slowly started kissing his way down Draco’s body, stopping to lick at his nipples and bite lightly along Draco’s ribs, “I wouldn’t let myself think about never being with you again.” Harry said as he mouthed at Draco’s hip.
Draco knew when he went to bed that he was going to have a problem when he woke up. He expected to wake up to his mother fluttering through his room in a frantic storm, or maybe Pansy sitting on his bed waiting to yell at him. Part of him expected a fire call from Hermione, telling him his services as Godfather would no longer be required the following Sunday. What Draco did not expect was to be shoved awake by Harry.
Draco shot pansy a glare, “I was young and overdramatic then. I realize now marrying a woman won’t be nearly as bad as I’d thought.”
Harry narrowed his eyes, a feeling of deep unease coming over him, “This doesn’t sound like it’s going to be a fun time Sparks. Best calm down and prepare for a long night.”
Draco stared at the contract in confusion. “I’m not getting married to have an affair later on, I want that out of here.” He thought for a moment, “And so what if our children are squibs? I don’t want to just keep having them until we get a magical child, that’s ludicrous. Take that out please.”
“Not at all. I’m perfectly fine. Harry has decided he wants to see other people and that’s where we’re at. Can you get me sorted or should I call someone else?”
“That's not what I meant,” Draco soothed, “I just meant good as in I'm glad. I'm glad because it means I can still have you.”
“Do they?” Astoria asked in an almost pouting voice “I was thinking maybe we could negotiate things out and save them the trouble. We got the paperwork back from your solicitors today and they seem to have made some odd changes.”
"Oh," Draco said in mock shock, "I'm so sorry Potter, does the Dark Mark make you uncomfortable? I'd take it off, but it's kind of attached to my arm."
Harry looked up blankly, "And it's definitely mine then?" He cringed as he asked, but a small voice in the back of his mind wouldn't let him not.
. Something is obviously going on and I just need to figure out what." Harry said with irritation as he looked through the Marauder's Map, trying to find Draco's footprints.
Draco spent the rest of the week on auto pilot, wishing Harry would wake up so they could finally solve the mystery of what happened. The healers sent him daily updates, and he wasn’t sure he wanted them. The healers had found more damage to his brain, and to some internal organs. Working with the Aurors they had started to narrow down the potion that Harry had been on, and they had hopes that they could safely wake Harry up the following week. Draco had not been back to visit Harry since his first visit, but he knew Ron and Hermione and the rest of the Weasley crew were there to keep him company.
“I need your help Pans. I’ve returned home and suddenly find myself in need of a new place to live. At least two bedrooms, with an office, preferably on the top-floor of a high-rise with no neighbors beside me. Open floor plan, and at least enough space for a 6-person dinner table. There’ll be a bonus if there’s a dining nook in the kitchen as well. I’d like to move in tonight.” Draco quickly started rattling off his list.
“Drugged. Like, against his will?” Draco leaned back in disgust. He’d tried his hardest in the past day to not think about what could have caused Harry to start abusing potions, tried to push Harry out of his mind even while he was waiting to hear from the doctor how his condition was. The idea of someone intentionally harming Harry hadn’t even entered his mind. “Do you have any idea what the potions were meant to do?”
Harry performed to the charm and watched it open, “Well, I guess I took out whatever was in there.” He looked up at Draco, “Why a lumos?”
Harry pulled out some yogurt and a banana for Scorpius, and summoned a hangover potion for himself. Once Scorpius was eating and Harry was feeling human again he cast a quick tempus charm and noted with alarm that it was ten in the morning.
Harry's head cocked to the side as his eyes widened with the realization of what he'd said. “Right, well, I didn't mean to say it. I've tried not to say it, but I'm tired of denying it cause it's true. I'm in love with you, Draco. And I think you love me too.”
Draco’s head went up and he stared at Daphne confused. “What do you mean I can’t marry your sister? Why?”
Harry blinked up at Draco for a moment, uncomprehending. "I can't drink on the job." He said flatly, repeating his earlier sentiment.
Harry laughed a dry laugh, his soul feeling a deep sense of contrition, “So many reasons Malfoy. I’m me and you’re you, and we spent our entire teen years hating each other. No matter what state either of our marriages are currently in, for the time being we’re both married. I’m the Auror that’s set to protect you, it would be completely unethical for me to be in any way, shape, or form involved with you and I could lose my job. And lastly, we’re not bent.”
“I’ve got something for you.” Ron said, reaching into his bag and pulling out a small ring. “It’s a portkey. It’s set to take you back directly to your house at 9:00. You’re to go in, and not leave again for a week. Even mum and dad can’t know you’re home, they think you’re off in France. Gin is waiting for you, you need to talk. If they find the mole before the end of seven days then orders might change, but for now I’m here for a week and then you’ll swap back in. 8 am this time next week. Until then, DO. NOT. LEAVE. YOUR. HOUSE. Robards is going to stop by tomorrow morning and debrief you. He sent this letter” Ron again reached into his bag, pulling out a letter that was sealed with the Head Auror’s stamp. “None of the other Aurors can know that you’re home. Not even Sparks.”
Draco sat anxiously in the waiting room. He had considering going back to work but he wanted to make sure he was nearby in case the healers needed something else from him. Hermione was still angry with him, and had left briefly to pick up some books on potions addictions and withdrawl before coming back and transfiguring a coffee table into a desk. Ron was pacing around the room with Rose, occasionally checking on Hermione to see if she needed anything or chatting with Draco. Draco felt like he was going crazy from all of the waiting, and he was about to challenge Ron to a game of chess when Astoria walked in.
Scorpius turned and saw Albus and James and immediately squealed. Jumping off his miniature broom, he ran over and embraced his friends. Draco and Harry herded the children inside, and got them up the stairs to the playroom. The boys got very entranced in a game together, and Harry pulled Draco's sleeve leading him out of the room towards the library.
"I’m sorry, but yeah, that’s probably for the best. And I know we can't change what happened. Honestly, I can’t even bring myself to regret it." Harry growled out, "I just. I think at this point I'm still going to get a divorce. Does that make me a right arse?"
It was the closest to a joke Draco had ever heard from his boss, and he gave him a slight smirk “I’ll do my best sir” Draco turned and exited the office, heading straight home to pour himself a drink.
Harry walked up behind Draco, “I don’t blame you. I’m not mad. I was just…” Harry rubbed the bridge of his nose for a moment carefully, “I was just surprised. I know that none of this” he gestured around the safe house, “is your fault.”
Keeping his arms around Harry’s neck, Draco slowly started backing out of the kitchen, his teeth going to Harry’s ear and biting down lightly. Harry steered them towards the bedroom, his hands running up Draco’s side. As they walked past the couch a soft “pop” sounded from the in-basket on the desk.
Harry reached up, running his hands along the side of Draco’s face and pulling him in for a deep kiss. Draco melted into the kiss, opening his mouth as Harry ran his tongue along Draco’s bottom lip. “I love you.” Harry murmured when they finally broke apart.
Half an hour later and Harry had calmed from extreme anger to melancholy before he heard the bedroom door slowly open. Draco tentatively walked into the living room, sitting delicately next to Harry's feet. He waited until Harry uncovered his eyes and looked at him before shooting a tentative smile.
Doubt flickered in Draco’s eyes, and sensing it Harry put his hands on Draco's arms, pushing him backwards while also running his hands soothingly over him. “If I know the Auror Corp, they already knew he was missing and have every available unit out looking for him.”
Harry rolled his eyes, "yeah, I'm sure there's not a single thing you two could have discussed this whole week."
“All yours. Always,” Harry panted, pulling his wand from his bedside table, he quickly muttered a lubing and a stretching charm on himself before sinking onto Draco’s hard cock. “Fuck.” Harry exclaimed, “You feel so good inside me Draco.”
The Aurors left Draco’s office with him still staring blackly ahead in his chair. Finally, Draco closed his eyes in pain and put his head down on his desk.
Draco stared at a moving picture of his face, watching Astoria wrap her arms around him and kiss him, and anger flared through Draco’s normally carefully controlled mask. “You don’t get to keep doing this Harry. YOU left me. YOU moved on. YOU broke the rules and got romantically involved with YOUR Auror partner who turned out to be crooked. You don’t have the right to blame this on me you self-righteous prick. All I did was love you and you when you decided that wasn’t enough I tried to move on with my life. You don’t get to keep doing this Harry, you wanted out of my life? Then get out of my life!”
“No.” Draco started, “Astoria came by and I forgot. I apologize. I will of course be willing to take care of my cousin. He always has a place with me.”
Finally, desperately, after checking every other room in the house, Harry made his way to the boys  bedroom. Draco was not there, but sitting on the nightstand next to the gliding chair lay Draco's wand. Harry sat down, trying to go back through hazy memories to remember if he'd seen Draco with his wand or not.
Harry hesitated, wanting to ask Draco how he had gotten the information on the blood-purist movement but not wanting to make him uncomfortable. Instead he nodded his head, “I think your son is lucky to have a father who feels that way.” Harry smiled before gesturing for Draco and Claire to sit down on the couch.
Draco had just finished his first sip of tea when Harry slinked in nervously “I’m sorry Draco. I hadn’t realized what happened.”
Draco looked at Harry suspiciously again before making a curt nod, "Fine. Seekers game tomorrow at 4. See you then, Potter." He said before turning and leaving the room.
“Don’t ever apologize for your past Draco, we both have them. I just… Make sure he stays in your past will you?” Astoria asked carefully.
Draco didn't reply, but his lips definitely twerked up. Turning back to Scorpius, Draco called out, “Scorpius, look who's here!”
“Of course not son, your father was only joking” Narcissa put her hand on Draco’s arm and guided him to the couch, “Now what help can we offer our favorite dragon?”
Draco breathed slowly, closing his eyes. “I’m sorry, Potter. I just want to be happy. Surely you can understand that?”
Harry nodded his head seriously, taking the case folder Robards handed him. Skimming it over quickly he looked up puzzled, “Draco Malfoy has been your informant,” he asked incredulously.
Draco rolled his eyes before standing up and wandering through the kitchen, “Yeah. We’ll talk then. See if this fit of crazy has moved on by then. Till then, let’s just worry about lunch.”
"Harry?!" A desperate voice sounded from the second floor, and then footsteps could be heard racing down the stairs.
The relief on Draco’s face was palpable, and Harry wrestled with guilt that he may be giving Draco false hope. Harry wrote a quick letter to Ron, detailing Draco’s theory and asking for any information that might help to assure Draco they were working to get him reunited with his son.
Draco’s portkey landed him on the stoop of his home, and he entered through the front door excitedly, beginning wandering through the house searching for Harry. After checking the kitchen, living room, and den, Draco climbed the stairs to their bedroom. Draco stopped on the top step as he thought he heard Harry moan. His excitement at catching Harry in the middle of some self-love quickly turned to shock as he heard an answering voice which was most definitely not Harry’s.
Draco quickly walked to the elevators, snapping his hands impatiently as he waited for the lift to arrive. “I edited to my wards to not let through any mail containing the words Harry or Potter.” He said sheepishly. “So you don’t know if this is poison or plant damage?”
Draco looked up at Harry, his eyes burning holes into the other’s skull, “You were going to end this though… It wasn’t some one time mistake?"
Harry let out a snort, “I can guarantee if someone had told me back then that this would be our lives now I would have checked them into St. Mungo’s.” Harry paused thoughtfully for a moment, “Though I suppose it’s not all bad. You’re a lot better than you used to be Malfoy.”
“Harry. I'm sorry. I get it now. Your job is important to you, but so are we. I really think that after this, after seeing you could put us first...I think I made a mistake.” Ginny said softly, grabbing Harry's hand in hers.
Draco exclaimed happily as her found the whiskey, pulling out a cup before turning to Harry, “am I pouring a glass for you too?” He asked.
“You come back to work. If you’re gone for two weeks it looks like a suspension which looks like an admission of guilt. You submit your memories for an external investigation which will be run by a special prosecutor through the unspeakables department. You’ll work on cases removed from the Aurors department, and most importantly, you be seen moving on with someone else. The department has a table at a gala this weekend, and you and your date just RSVP’d to be there.”
Draco smiled, “I’ve actually always been this amazing, and you just never understood what a great guy I am until now.”
This mantra kept repeating itself over and over again in Harry’s head. The day before the mantra had included
Harry immediately met his lips to Draco’s, excited to see him after weeks apart. Their mouths collided forcefully, Harry trying to convey all the feelings he could never tell Draco into his kiss. Draco ran a hand through Harry's dark hair, eliciting a moan before they both broke apart.
Draco leaned back slightly, still close enough that he could feel the heat of Harry’s breath but not so close that their mouths would touch accidently. “Hey Potter?” He said softly.
Ron hesitated, looking down at his hands, “You should ask her that question, mate. I know she’s anxious to talk to you. Pretty lousy not sending her a single letter while you’ve been here.”
Draco took a step closer to Harry, his eyes vulnerable. “I am sorry that you’re stuck here. With me”
Harry smirked, “I just wanted to do something nice. Figured you’ve made breakfast plenty these last few weeks.”
Draco laid his head on Pansy’s shoulder and finally let his tears fall. When his emotions had finally drained out, Pansy walked Draco to his new room and tucked him into bed. She laid down next to him and quietly fell asleep.
At the bottom were apparition coordinate and the name of a restaurant that Draco vaguely thought they might have gone to before. He wrote back a quick agreement to lunch before heading upstairs to get ready for work.
Ron let out an exasperated sigh, “Alright. I promise. Tell Gin I said hi. And promise you’ll give her a chance to explain. She’s having a rough time of it too, okay?”
“I mean, it appears he’s been abusing potions for at least three months. He’s showing severe damage to his frontal lobe and prefrontal cortex. We can’t get near him to start to heal that though, and we need to get him through his detox before we can even begin to try and heal him.”
“Do you really have any complaints? Are you telling me you want to marry me because you’ve fallen deeply in love with me and can’t imagine a day without my smile?” Astoria asked wryly.
Draco leaned back and took another sip of his drink before smiling at Harry, “I’d give up my life to make sure my son has a better chance, yes. His safety, security… you really don’t think that’s more important to me than my name?”
“What was I supposed to think when you spend three weeks away and only call me twice? What am I supposed to think when it’s only two months later and you’re engaged to someone else?” Harry asked. His voice dropped glumly “I’d never even heard you mention her name before Draco. Were you seeing her when were still together? Do you love her?” Harry tried to catch Draco’s eyes, but they were firmly looking towards the ground, “I didn’t even know you liked women Draco, I thought you were gay.”
Draco continued to glare, “They’re my cousins too Harry. I could easily take Teddy over to see them.”
Fast as lightning Harry had Draco behind him and was firing off spells of protection around them. Claire rose from her position on the couch, her hand shaking slightly as she began casting spells. The mystery wizard was powerful, countering Claire's spells with a practiced ease. Another two men exited the fire, out-arming Harry and Claire. Harry tried to Incarcerous the masked men, but they were quickly able to counter his spells. Harry and Claire fought desperately, but they were barely able to keep up and the men moved closer towards Harry and Draco. As another spell began to break through his defenses, Harry realized they were no match for the mystery wizards.
Harry woke up slowly when a ding came from the living room, the indication that a letter had arrived. He started to get up before suddenly taking in his position; his front was draped around Draco's back, his left arm under Draco's torso, and one leg was thrown haphazardly over Draco's leg. As soon as Harry became aware of who he was wrapped around he slowly tried to extract himself; that was definitely not the position the two had drifted to sleep in. Once Harry had gotten his trapped arm free he rolled out of bed and sat up in horror.
