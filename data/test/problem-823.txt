Draco wished maybe he had chosen Gryffindor this time around, after all.
"I that a prediction or a threat?" asked Harry.
"Then let us begin!" said Bowie.
He raised his hands dramatically, revealing not

"Perhaps we ought to return to my office," suggested Dumbledore, "where you may tell it in peace."

"Ow! Well, he's not—"
Dolohov was supposed to kill Gertrude McKinnon.
, whatever they were calling the prat now.
"The Aurors tend to give us what we want," he said, "and get out of our way. You should follow their lead."
"Oh, it might as well!"
Draco swallowed. He held his wand high and close to his chest.
Remus smiled easily. "I just asked what your plans were for today. Since most of the Houses are holding their Quidditch tryouts, and James and Sirius usually try to spy on the competition…."
"A mammal ear," repeated Harry.
isn't going to save you from an attack. I don't care if you're injured or half-dead. If you can breathe, you can fight, understand?"
"Do you have information on Antonin Dolohov or not?" asked Hermione, pushing forward with that hard look in her eyes.
"And what, Mallory followed him under Voldemort's orders?" James asked, trying to keep the sarcasm out of his voice and really consider it. "I don't know about this, Pads…."
Harry shrugged. "What's Quidditch without a few broken bones?"
Regulus cocked his head, studying Harry. On Sirius, it was always an amusingly dog-like movement. On Regulus, it was birdlike, a little more predatory, a little more alien.
He was less pleased with his own ongoing insomnia, but he was glad
Laying Hermione down in the dirt felt like ripping out a piece of his own soul and leaving it behind. But he had to do it. She would understand— for Ron, she would understand. He settled her back as gently as he could, placed her fallen wand in her hand against her chest, and then left her alone in the warm, dark night.
"No, we won't," said Remus, deceptively calm. "Harry has already been through enough. Harry is struggling. And
James Potter.
The war hadn't touched this Hogwarts like it had his own. Everything here was so easy, so simple, so safe.
Draco Malfoy was on the cobbled pavement of a street in Knockturn Alley beside him.
"What happened, Gertrude?" he asked. "Do you know where you are and why you're here?"
"This school year alone," said Remus appreciatively. He continued their previous conversation as if nothing had interrupted, "Hogsmeade is well worth a visit, if you think you can skip one weekend at the library, of course. There's this wonderful little bookshop, even, if you'd like to look at some additional resources. And we usually have lunch at the local bar, the Three Broomsticks. They make an
He heard Dolohov laughing— felt the agony of Cruciatus Curse ripping through him, tearing a scream from an already bloody, aching throat—
"You don't have to do this, you know," said Ron quietly, from where the trio stood in front of the wrought-iron gates leading into the Malfoy Estate. He was looking out of the corner of his eye at Hermione, whose eyes were too bright and whose lips were in a hard, firm line. "You don't have to go back in there. Harry'n I'll handle it."
"Couldn't have done a Sonorus?" muttered Malfoy irritably, still cringing as he uncovered his own ears.
James was still waving and now pointing emphatically at the seat next to him, between him and—
Draco knew he was holding onto his other questions, waiting for the opportune moment.
"It was my fault," he insisted quietly. The words he had been keeping to himself for months, even from Ron and Hermione though he suspected they knew, poured out of him in a soft, hoarse rush. "Voldemort was after me. You lot would never have been in that position if I had stayed away. Everyone who died…."
Harry's heart clenched as it did every time he entered the Great Hall, which was why he had taken great pains to avoid it in the past week. There were the thousands of candles floating above the four long, glistening tables filled with smartly dressed, freshly scrubbed children. The dark sky glittered with stars above them through the enchanted ceiling.
Harry struggled. He could still taste blood in his mouth, feel his own throat tearing from his screams. He couldn't
Though Harry looked at them all with a strange intensity, it was different with Peter. Everything about Harry's aura, powerful and bright while directed at James, Sirius, and Remus, became closed off and cold when he looked at Peter.
"What was Ilvermorny like?" Greengrass asked, gazing at him with dewy eyes.
And now he had attacked him.
much. Why the ever-loving
"—just look at your mum—"
It looked deserted, but he heard voices coming from a room in the back.
"What— what are you doing?" demanded Harry, struggling, as Dolohov turned away and surveyed the wreckage of the shop.
Malfoy eyed him again, and now it was wary.
He tried to put it from his mind, but he kept returning to that look on Potter's face. It had been horrid, nothing but panic and desperation and… and that was not the Potter Draco knew. That was not Dumbledore's reckless golden boy, the schoolboy who could do no wrong in the eyes of the professors. That was not his Quidditch rival, not the second coming of Godric Bloody Gryffindor who had an undeniable 'saving people thing' and who flew like a bloody bird.
Sirius slung an arm around Gertrude and said, "That's why you ladies need a full gentlemanly escort to the village. The Marauders would like to offer our humble services for the weekend."
"Ron!" Harry shouted, whirling to protect him before another Killing Curse could fly. He stood over his friend, breathing hard and trembling with exertion, but his wand was up and ready.
"Why would—?"
Sirius, grinning, flicked his wand to release the Charms professor. Panting, Flitwick stood. They bowed to one another, and Flitwick moved offstage to supervise with Bowie.
"Oh! Yes. Um, thank you." The girl scurried off.
It was well after dinner, and, as far as they knew, he was still in the library.
"I wasn't— that wasn't what I said at all!"
— except maybe his mother."
Fear like ice water poured down Harry's spine.
"Come on," muttered Harry. "We're blocking the door. What's next?"
"Oh, dear, that's not a flattering look for you," said Malfoy with a smirk.
"Ohh, what a lovely bonnet," Sirius whispered as the snake stared down one second year girl. "I just remembered I'm a girl snake, and I need a bonnet to cover up
He tried to breathe, tried to think of anything else.
His vision was tunneling. He was suffocating under the panic, under the pain. But Dolohov wouldn't let him pass out, that was too much a kindness for him.
"What," said James, not far from Harry.
"Now, students," said Bowie, with mock seriousness. "Despite being the only two on speaking terms, Remus Lupin and Harry Parker could not fathom a way for us to overcome our immense and passionate hatred of one another. It was determined that we would proceed to the duel. Remember! Since we are all wizards, the fight shall be to surrender or inability to hold a wand! Now, seconds, thirds, fourths, get up here."
Wormtail was back.
He wasn't stupid enough to think Dumbledore had bought it, of course, but at least he hadn't pushed for the truth. Dumbledore was oddly wary of altering the future, considering he was the one who had suggested Harry and Hermione use a time-turner to save Sirius and Buckbeak in their third year.
Harry pinched the bridge of his nose.
James spotted them immediately and his face turned thunderous and scarlet.
, Malfoy! What the fuck! How
's in fourth year. Dirt. Dirt and grass and mud and something that smelled tremendously like fertilizer. As the badger kicked dirt merrily over all the Hufflepuffs, Sirius grinned behind his hand, took aim at the badger's targets, and shot off jets of dirt at them.
He curled in on himself, groaning in pain. He felt the skin of his arms against the bare skin of his chest.

Malfoy was a construction of his mind, Harry reminded himself. It was no use arguing with him.
"You just don't want to believe anything bad of him so you can recruit him for the Quidditch team!"
Judging by that expression, he had.
He stood, blood going cold and roaring at the same time. "You watched me flying? You were

"What? You
"Yes, I see that," snapped Harry. "I meant: Why Knockturn Alley?"
Anyway, uh…. Right. That's that. Nice chat. Bye."
The rat really was their friend. They included him, they listened to him, they went out of their way to reassure him when he hadn't tested high enough to continue a class with them.
And there was Wormtail, twitchy uncomfortably under Harry's haunted gaze, painfully shy and inferior.
. Parker, you may stay and watch if you like."
"Harry—" came Ron's voice several yards away, out of breath. He was moving as he continued, "—Malfoy tricked us!
"But is it magical or mental?" asked Lily pragmatically.
Worse, what if he tried something and reverted back to his black hair, sitting just a couple of seats away from his lookalike father?

It was hatred.

"What is it, what happened?" he demanded.
Sirius frowned at them. "The scar on his forehead. The one from a Dark curse."
Draco diligently kept up his wards, traps, and protective charms.
The look on Sirius's face was ugly.
Malfoy gripped his shoulder, and Harry held onto the sensation like another lifeline, another thing to keep him grounded in reality.
"Oh, for— I know Dumbledore was cryptic, but
Snakes were the worst.
"Sorry," said Harry, even though he wasn't. He was too busy dealing with his own upturned worldview.
Sirius drew up to Malfoy until they were almost toe-to-toe, but Malfoy refused to move. A moment later, Malfoy blasted him back with a wind charm Harry didn't recognize, but there was enough brute strength that Sirius couldn't avoid it.
"Hogsmeade?" said Harry. "Oh. Yeah. Little wizarding village nearby, isn't it?"
Though Harry was able to admit he had never known Dumbledore as well as he'd thought, even he knew Dumbledore could not be so cruel as to pretend not to remember him.
"Sir, this is important," said Draco firmly. "I promise I'll Obliviate you afterwards if you feel you shouldn't know, but…" He hesitated again, uncertain exactly how to say what he needed Dumbledore to understand right off the bat. He decided to dive straight into the heart of it. "Potter— Harry— is important. To the future, I mean. And you're important to him."
"The two duelists will also agree on
that on the horrible night approaching. If he could change Wormtail, he could change
Harry found himself smiling despite his dismal thoughts. "Thanks, Marlene."
Breathing hard, Harry pulled a lock of his hair into sight and watched it, dazed, as it turned from jet black to straw blond.
Rather than trying to be subtle with Peter, Remus tapped Wormtail on the shoulder and whispered something in his ear.
on my everything bagel! Everything!"
Black was eyeing his trembling wand with worry.
"I'll simply set Professor McGonagall upon you!"
He probably shouldn't have worried. As usual, James and Sirius made themselves the center of attention as soon as McGonagall stopped speaking.
Harry managed to disarm Rabastan and stun him. He dug furiously in his robes for the hidden inside pocket where he'd stowed the coin.
Snape lifted his chin in defiant pride, as if he expected Harry to scoff at the idea that Voldemort could be interested in him.
There was a confused but calculating glint in Malfoy's eye as the silence stretched unexpectedly. Harry could see it as he began to piece it together, undoubtedly thinking of when they had first arrived in the past and Harry had assumed they were dead.
His Patronus wasn't corporeal, but it was bright and swift. It raced between the desks to launch itself between Rosier and the illusory dementor like a misty, silvery shield.
Harry hadn't exactly portrayed himself as stable these past two weeks.
"Oh, no, what's that on my tail?" Sirius whispered in falsetto as the snake swayed drunkenly back around on itself, curling up and eyeing the hall judgmentally. Only those nearest Sirius could hear him. "By Salazar, it's dirt! Dirt on my tail! Why would such a noble, purebred serpent as I have
"The Mudblood and the Chosen One," he said, over the sound of the streetlamp beside him exploding from one of Harry's missed spells. "My lucky day."
"Sirius and Remus were younger," said Harry. "After they died, I mean. When I saw them in the forest."
Remus was pacing as well as he could at the mouth of the tunnel, which was the only part large enough to accommodate a seventeen-year-old boy standing. Peter sat closest to him, hugging his knees to his chest as if to make himself as small as possible so the rest of them had enough room. James had attempted to lean against the rounded wall of the tunnel for the first few minutes, but stooping so that his head didn't hit the ceiling had given him muscle spasms, and he'd finally taken to crouching across from Peter.
"What? Don't you point your wand at my owl!
He broke off suddenly and looked away, blinking hard.
, Harry recalled suddenly, and he couldn't help glancing at Remus as grief rose up within him. Dolohov had escaped before Kingsley had rallied the Ministry and started making arrests, but Flitwick had incapacitated him, at least.
. Maybe it had been Malfoy's comment earlier about not letting the war take anything else from him.
"But what
He stuffed both hands into his pockets, wrapping one around the handle of his wand, and cast another glance back at the Slytherins.
Potter had loved this man like a grandfather, had confided in him, and together Potter and Dumbledore had defeated the Dark Lord— the Dark Lord who scared Draco so much he could hardly be in the same room with him without pissing himself.
"Another what?"
"And now," said Professor McGonagall, after the last first years had been Sorted, "we have two students recently transferred from our sister school, Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in North America. They will be attending classes here for the year leading up to their N.E.W.T.s in the summer and as such need to be Sorted. First, Draco Mallory."
"Parker!" Snape called as Harry turned away, going to find Remus or, hell, even Pettigrew. Harry stopped, took a deep breath, and turned to face his would-be potions professor. Snape didn't smile. He looked serious. "This balancing act you have going on between the Gryffindors and Slytherins… it's not going to last. If you want to maintain a friendship with Mallory, you won't be accepted by them. And if you become friends with them, they won't stand for your alliance with Mallory. You'll have to choose."
But maybe it did.
"Well, then, if you've got all the answers, where are we?" asked Harry. He didn't want to stand up to get a better look around, therein also giving Malfoy a better view of his ass. He wondered why robes hadn't appeared for him at his first thought, as they had the previous time.
Sirius circled Malfoy, forcing him to turn in place, but Malfoy still didn't give an inch.
, thought Harry bluntly.
with his eyes to Remus. And, bless him, Remus gave a slight shrug and headshake in response.

Harry almost felt bad. He still didn't know why Draco Malfoy of all people had been transported along with him— if anything, he had been holding onto
"He's the only one who can get us back, isn't he?" Draco's voice sounded far away even to his own ears.
He wouldn't meet Malfoy's eye for the rest of class.
"Hey!" she called sternly. "Whatever you boys are arguing about now, cut it out! I'm not cleaning up another of your messes this early in the morning! Don't make me take House points!"
It was a nasty, drawn-out fight.
Harry wondered if he had started practicing Legilimency yet.
He took the bed next to Severus's in the dorms, he took a seat at the breakfast table next to Severus, and now for the third time, he took the desk next to Severus's in class.
"Either. Both. Selena Salazar's

Nothing.
Harry found himself laughing as he and Malfoy kicked off.
"Let me challenge," said Flitwick. "I so rarely get to be filled with righteous indignation."
He couldn't find a pulse.
They couldn't see every angle at once, couldn't fight so many opponents with only each other for help.
Draco's lips wanted to pull into a scowl, but he fought to keep a straight face. "Yes. He obviously thought he could somehow defeat Dolohov. It didn't happen, as you can see."
"Don't get smart with me, Po—Parker," hissed Draco.
"I may have been… a disappointment… but at least I never killed… my master!"
He turned on his heel and headed back to the boys' dormitory.
"I didn't mean it as an insult," said Malfoy, turning a sharp gaze around their vicinity to make sure nobody was paying attention to them instead of the duel. "I just meant… well, in pureblood families, we call it the Black family madness. No, hush, Potter, it's still not an insult, it's a fact. I'm sure your godfather was nothing like Auntie Bella. But they were related, and it occasionally shows. And I would apologize for the comparison, but he did just piss in
Harry gaped at him.
He sent a stinging hex at Sirius's foot, warning him to wrap it up.
Harry floundered, as he did every time someone expressed interest in Ilvermorny. "Er— yeah— we just…"
Had… had Severus Snape just tried to recruit him? Him, Harry Potter, for Lord Voldemort?
They tried.
He had liked Quidditch once. Maybe he still did— or

Draco snorted once. "Now you've done it, Parker. I know a jinx when I hear one."
They had made it halfway to the hospital wing before Harry could respond.
Guilt and concern hit Draco in equal measure.
They had looked more real than ever as he was about to join them.
"You will have it! Draco Mallory, as my second, will be there as well!"
"Regulus's," said Malfoy, throwing a leg over his own broom with a mischievous grin. "Nicked it when he went off to shout at Jones-Kieffer. I'm sure the whole castle will hear when he finds out."
, he reminded himself.
world needs him," continued Draco, "but… I think we broke him. And… and I think… I think we need your help to fix him."

them.
The tiny group, plus two freshly turned eighteen-year-olds, followed McGonagall into the Great Hall.
"Padfoot, I'm telling you: I didn't step in. I don't even know what Protego Horribilis is. You're probably hallucinating like that time we took that purple potion, remember?"
, Harry thought, startled by his own forgetfulness. They had learned to become animagi recently. Of course, they would have started out by experimenting with transfiguration spells such as this. And no wonder Remus was behind. He hadn't learned to become an animagus with them; his wolf was in his blood.
He let out a breath.
Severus, at least, could sleep in peace. This Severus hadn't gone through a war yet.
Sirius shrugged and went back to his breakfast, though his expression was dark. "Who better to tell when their mistress is acting odd than her faithful house elf? Nobody casting an Imperius can account for every little thing, like whether the victim takes two sugars with their tea or three. Maybe they know they like red wine over white, but do they prefer a Cabernet or a Bordeaux? Goblin-made or French? The best acting in the world can't fool a house elf. She's the first to go. Then the Muggle-born outreach program? Perfect for Death Eaters looking for targets. Midge had a list of names and addresses at her fingertips. Probably took three weeks for her to copy them all down and hand over to the Death Eater cursing her."
Harry's mind scrambled, grasping for a hold on the real world, on Kingsley's voice and what those words meant.
"Interesting," said Regulus quietly. "Are you complimenting Sirius's ability to defend himself, or are you saying you wouldn't come to his defense if I were to verbally eviscerate him?"
Draco let out a sigh of relief.
"Judases, all of you," snarled Sirius.
"I see," said Dumbledore again. He surveyed Draco again with that penetrating blue stare. Draco wondered if he knew what he had almost let slip, that Potter had been expecting
(See the end of the chapter for
"I like him," said James, purely to forestall whatever Sirius had prepared against Parker. "The girls have adopted him like a puppy, and you know they're canny. They'd be the first to turn on him if he were a bad sort."
He'd gone through his own hell over the past year. He hadn't spared much time to wonder over Potter's.
Cold sweat trickled down Harry's scalp as he struggled to breathe. He found himself swaying, the edges of his vision graying. He tasted blood in his throat as his memory screamed itself hoarse.
, either."
"Gosh, what effusive praise." Malfoy rolled his eyes and said, "As someone who prefers all his limbs intact, I never stood a chance against you, did I?"
"Maybe they didn't see," whispered Malfoy. "All this steam…."
Dolohov had killed her.
"What."
"Now!"
The table on the far left roared its approval, and Harry pulled off the hat reluctantly. He nodded to McGonagall as he stood, and she gave him a suspicious but polite nod back.
"Of course, Headmaster," said James, blushing. Sirius was trying to tap out, his face having been submerged in pumpkin juice for several seconds now, but James shoved it down even harder and attempted to rub his nose against the bottom of the bowl.
His wand.
"I'm not mad!"
"Implying there's a
Dolohov didn't let the man finish. He threw himself backward, Apparating, and took Rodolphus and Rabastan with him.
Sometimes the reality of it hit him like a bug on a windshield.
Lily took the spot on Sirius's other side, across from Harry, while the rest of the girls clustered nearby.
He continued muttering uncomplimentary things under his breath as they changed directions toward the library, but Harry ignored him.
Well.
Malfoy made a sound somewhere between a whimper and a gag. His face remained impressively straight.
"Wormtail, the trapdoor!" said Sirius, right before transforming into a shaggy black dog and tackling James from behind.
Acid burned his veins. The fire in his chest was hotter than Crabbe's Fiendfyre.
Of everything, that part threw James off the most.
After a stony moment of silence, Malfoy said, "The war took too many things I cared about. It won't get flying, too. If you were half the Gryffindor I thought you were, you wouldn't let it take something you loved from you, either."
"No?" murmured Lily. "Okay, let's try:
at the curriculum?"
They bowed, neither taking their eyes off the other.
"Because the timing would be lost, Evans," said Sirius, but he seemed to realize Harry was too well-defended to continue. He gave Harry's shoulders a parting shake, too rough to be entirely friendly, and let go. "Jokes are all about timing."
"We can't
On the other side of the Floo, they came face to face with a bemused Albus Dumbledore. He still had auburn peppered in his hair, and the silver was not as pale as they had known it.
"Yes?"
Harry threw the Snitch in the rubbish bin on his way out.

Sirius barely glanced at it before he closed it and passed it back. "Imperius Curse. Looks like someone got Midge."
Harry snatched Nott's wand out of the air. A split second later, he'd followed it up with a
She gave him a faint smile. With one last squeeze on his arm, she took a step back.
"Black, Parker," said Malfoy easily, cutting in before Harry got started. "Were you congratulating Parker on the duel, as well, then?"
Draco wanted to confide in a man like Dumbledore. He wanted his

thought Harry, anger rising within him like a serpent ready to strike.
Remus breathed steadily, the only sound in the tunnel. His voice had softened, yes, but nothing about it had weakened. He was sure of himself in a way that he rarely ever was, and James took that as seriously as it deserved.
The two seventh year Slytherin prefects, Evan Rosier and Johanna Wilkes, tried to point Draco to a seat across from them like a disobedient dog, but Draco smiled a polite, icy smile and sat between Severus and a teenager who
That was a strange response, but Remus accepted it with an only slightly delayed grunt.
James wasn't planning a diabolical, elaborate prank on Harry to get revenge. Unless, of course, his plan to get Harry drunk at the Three Broomsticks on their first Hogsmeade weekend counted. It wasn't so much a prank as a curiosity.
Malfoy looked delighted and a bit like he might swoon.
TBC...
. Young, handsome, arrogant Sirius Black. Padfoot.
"Next, after the weapons have been established, the challenger issues the location of the duel. Then the challenged is allowed to select the time. Between them, they select their seconds, or wizards who will take over in case the primary is unable to continue the duel, and occasionally thirds and fourths and so on, depending on alliances involved.
They were huddled at the foot of the stands under the Invisibility Cloak, spying on the Slytherin tryouts.
Harry made it through the doors out into the entrance hall and took the first corridor he came across. From there, he slammed his way into the first broom cupboard and shut the door behind himself.
"Dear Head Boy," Dumbledore continued serenely as the rest of the students roared with laughter at their expense. "Perhaps you and the Head Girl would be kind enough to relight the candles? Since, of course, handling the aftermath of pranks is something that falls under your

"He may be a Death Eater," said James softly. He looked up and caught Sirius's gaze, held it. "He may not be. That's not important. The world's not sorted into good people and Death Eaters. Some people are just bad. And you and me, mate? We can't fight Voldemort and Death Eaters if we're just going to go home and be bad people. We have to be better."

Harry sighed. He rubbed the bridge of his nose.
, Draco sighed to himself. He did get the gist of it, though. Yes, Potter was the only one who could get them back.
He whipped his wand at Hermione, and then they were dueling madly, like Sirius and Bellatrix at the Department of Mysteries.
"He is," Malfoy answered the original question, his tone clipped, and Harry could
Harry's— ugh,
Pleased with himself, Harry waved his wand and tried to nonverbally end the spell.
With an effort, he forced it down and swallowed hard, taking a long swig of juice to wash it down. When he was able, he said, trying to affect disinterest even as his eyes watered, "He only meant I was raised in the Wizarding world. He wasn't. I'm not sure he understands the difference between pureblood and half-blood, honestly. It was different at Ilvermorny."
"I suppose Sirius sent you?" asked Harry glumly.
Oh, no, don't, uh, don't worry about it. Lily is my friend, too. I mean—
"Madam Pomfrey does, however, believe both Mr. Potter and Miss McKinnon will make full recoveries," Dumbledore finished quietly, watching him.
She looked up at James with mirth in her eyes and a quirk of a smile.
his wand in the fireplace when we Floo'd. You were naked when we turned up in Knockturn Alley, and you used it right then and there against Dolohov. What are you hiding?"
.' Once you feel you've got a grasp on it, have your partner try to jinx you. No more duels to the death tonight, please; I've only got so much whiskey left in this flask. Now, we've got about thirty minutes left, so chop chop! Off you go! Ah— Mr. Mallory, a word first, if you please."
A blinding, jagged white bolt of lightning shot out of Malfoy's wand. The explosion of sound was deafening.
. And then Aunt Bella wanted to test me when she came to live at the manor. She… she actually fights a lot like your Sirius. Quick, aggressive…. She's the one who taught me that spell. The Dark Lord taught her, you see. She and Snape were his… pupils, I suppose, in the Dark Arts."
"Run along," said Potter Senior, and he had lost the laughter in his face.
Dolohov grinned and motioned two Death Eaters forward.
After class, one of the Gryffindor girls— not one of the McKinnons or the redhead with Harry's eyes, Draco couldn't remember her name— came up to him before he could finish packing his bag.
"It would have been hilarious," said Malfoy primly, sticking his nose in the air, "except, for some unfathomable reason, you could produce a Patronus at
"Please, call me Lily," said Lily easily, still giving him that smile and that fond, knowing look. "Will you be joining us in Hogsmeade today? We were going to give Harry the grand tour."

When— if— Draco betrayed them, they would get Hermione out of there first, even if it killed them.
Draco let out a heavy breath and looked out the window onto the pristine Quidditch pitch in the distance.
Thanks for reading! And a big thanks to Stoneage_Woman for beta-ing!
Perhaps Flitwick was tired from his flashy duel with Bowie; perhaps he and Bowie had arranged beforehand for the winner between them to bow out quickly and let the students have their shot at each other. Either way, Sirius managed to get a full-body lock on Flitwick surprisingly quickly.
James let his head drop in his free hand and made the hissing spell even louder. "I'm going to smother him with his pillow tonight, I swear to the Founders."
Until Harry figured it out for himself, they were stuck, and he should be doing something more useful with their rare opportunity than going to school and working on homework and worrying about upcoming N.E.W.T.s.
"That must be some letter," said Lily, watching the scuffle with her hand inching almost subconsciously toward her wand like she was about to break them up at any moment. She had porridge and bits of egg in her hair, though she had brushed off most of the crumbs from the toast that had hit her square in the nose. "We've mentioned both Hogsmeade
Lily was watching them curiously.
It was late in that second week of term that Severus dropped, exhausted, into his bed and then let out an ear-piercing screech, popping back to his feet as if his bed had been a massive spring.
Then he slashed his wand in frustration and strode up to Malfoy, rage boiling over. He grabbed Malfoy's collar and jerked him roughly back to his feet.
He glanced down and saw the Invisibility Cloak draped across his lap, as innocent and inevitable as if it had always been there, as if he hadn't
James took control of the red grotesque flames and rearranged them into a crimson and gold lion.
"Can't your brother have a conversation without you sticking your nose in it?" Harry snapped, his pleasure in James's companionship disappearing like a candle being snuffed. "It's no wonder you two can't get along if you never leave him alone. He's his own person, you know, and he's allowed to talk to who he wants
"My bladder!" howled Harry, clutching his stomach. "I'm gonna—"
"They'll be at this a while," said Remus. "So, what are you studying in the library now?"
And somehow he was in 1978 instead.
Harry didn't know what happened next.
Why had he volunteered to watch Malfoy try out for the
So many.
It was painful to say, painful to remember the way Sirius had been taunting Bellatrix just before she had gotten in a clean shot. Worse still to be revealing that weakness to anyone else, but
"Harry clearly has issues Mallory knows about," he said in his most confident, placating leader voice. "And Ilvermorny doesn't have a Slytherin house. Whatever Mallory is, I don't think he'll be as easy to bunch in with that lot. Even if they're not friends, maybe Mallory is just a decent sort helping a classmate."
He hated talking about the future. He hated the idea of splitting up the three of them. They had been through so much together. They had counted on one another to stay alive, to stay sane, to
Harry opened his mouth to retort but then stopped. He thought about it.
"As loathe as I am to offer it," said Draco with a sneer and contemptuous once-over in Harry's direction, "lunch? You look as if you haven't had a decent meal since sixth year. I could have Addie arrange sandwiches and tea."
"Died? We're not dead! Why would you say—? I would
James glanced furtively at the head table. The professors were usually more tolerant of the fireworks display at the welcoming feast as long as it was relatively harmless and the skill behind it impressive enough. They
He gave up the pretense of strolling through the shops very quickly and let his feet take him straight to Knockturn Alley.
How could Draco Malfoy understand the cost of winning? How could he understand the responsibility and the guilt that had been laid at Harry's feet from the moment he turned eleven years old?
. There was no wasted movement. It was clear he had a plan, a mental map, and years of experience. He tossed the Quaffle, caught the Quaffle, and threw it for a goal all with the same fluidity, never slowing or hesitating even as he accounted for his teammates' flight patterns.
Harry didn't respond. He closed his eyes, clenched his fists, and tried to get air back into his lungs.
"Don't whine at me; it's not going to change the truth. Hey, c'mere, mate, let's go this way…."
his glasses.
He'd had to reduce his status to
bed, so forgive me if I'm not particularly sympathetic."
"It's just, you and Mallory just transferred," said Remus, unsure where Harry had gotten lost. "Why would they be so close unless they had known each other already?"
"So, Harry," said Remus, looking a little wild around the eyes. "Any…
She excused herself shortly after that, and Harry followed suit.
He'd thought of his mixed success with pranks in the past— dressing up as dementors for that Quidditch game in third year, the Potter Stinks badges in fourth— but nothing along those lines seemed good enough as revenge against the Marauders.
"I, uh… just have a bad feeling, is all," said Harry. "Something's going on, and… ah… well, trouble has a knack of finding me."
"I think I have an idea," said Remus. "If you'll allow me?"
Harry slid down in his seat and wished for either an escape or a quick, painless death.
James supported him from the Great Hall with an arm around his shoulders, though Sirius could walk just fine.
"As a date? I don't think that's any of your business, Potter," said Lily, tossing her hair back loftily. "Is it, Harry?"
Potter was having another breakdown. Because of
When the Dark Lord had tasked Draco with killing Dumbledore, he'd known it had been little more than his own death sentence. He'd been given a year so that his parents would agonize over him, all the while knowing he was doomed.
Even if Draco stripped Potter Senior and Black of their robes, he recognized he was more likely to get a detention than vindictive-sweet revenge.
"Correct," said Bowie. "The Shield Charm will repel all but the Darkest curses, and it's always good to disarm your opponent first chance you get. Five points to Gryffindor. Alright, Potter, have a seat. Miss Evans, you're Head Girl, let's have you next."
"But… the full moon isn't until next week," said Wormtail, breaking the macabre train of James's thoughts. Wormtail fidgeted with the hem of his robes as they turned to look at him. "He can't have lycanthropy. If he went to see Madam Pomfrey yesterday… well, the last full moon was over two weeks ago. He wouldn't still be injured. Remus heals pretty fast. Right?"
Remus shot him a swift, wry grin. "Glad I could help."
"I don't think we're dead," said Malfoy. "I think… I think we've somehow traveled back in time. We're in the past. That's why Dolohov and the others are so young. That's why Gimmick Alley is so different. The shops we know haven't been built yet, or they're owned by different people. It's the only logical explanation."
James, Remus, and Peter blinked at each other. James tried to convey
"What?" exploded Draco, before he could stop himself. "But you dueled the—"
Sirius leaned back on his hands, wide-eyed and pale.
It was the look the adult Sirius gave Snape at Order meetings. It was the look that meant he didn't trust him, that meant he thought Snape was still loyal to Voldemort.
"So be it! Be there at eight o'clock, evening, sharp!"
This, the dueling club and Bowie, must have happened the first time around in the original timeline. He and Malfoy hadn't altered
He cleared his throat and said, "Sir, in the future…."
had been targeted.
The gagging noise became more of a choked whine.
"I think he might be friends with that Mallory," James admitted reluctantly, "but that doesn't mean he's going to run to McGonagall on us all year. As long as we leave Mallory out of the worst of it…."
A house-elf answered the door, looking just as drawn and haggard as the rest of them. The little elf led them silently to a room on the far side of the house. She didn't ask who they were or offer to take their cloaks. She didn't fall over herself to tempt them with tea or biscuits. She simply stared and then started down the entrance hall, through the dining room and portrait gallery, and expected them to follow.
The flames shuddered for a split second before turning sapphire blue and gleaming bronze. The amorphous cloud took shape, coalescing into a giant bronze and blue eagle. The great eagle flapped its wings and gave a screeching, "CAW!" before taking flight around the hall.
Lupin, dazed by his own happiness.
Hermione clearly fought to keep her stern composure, but her cheeks tinged pink.
He was turning red again.
He didn't know why, in that moment of blind rage, why it was worse to image a dog willfully peeing on Severus's bed rather than a bratty teenager casting a rude spell with a wand, but it suddenly made all the difference.
He and James had bounded back to their feet, grinning and panting, but Sirius's face turned suspicious as he caught Harry's question.
Harry, Remus, and Marlene dove out of the way as the boys went careening off the table on their side.
Potter, Severus had said. Probably Black, too. They were never far from one another.
"Why did you volunteer to be his third?"
"Stop it," said Malfoy irritably, swatting Harry's hand down.
Lily, Mary, Marlene, and Gertrude chose that moment to emerge into the hall.
Second, it might end up being
Harry trudged forward and sank onto the stool. McGonagall placed the hat on his head.
More and more it seemed like a better use of his time than going back to school and spending fruitless hours in the library with Malfoy.
"Right," she said crisply, giving no sign that they had gotten to know each other at all in the week leading up to the start of term.
they teach, Miss…?"
, was Harry's usual answer, born out of years of not even remembering his parents, but somehow the words stuck in his throat this time.
Remus stared at him.
is headmaster— the one man everyone knows Voldemort fears. Parker is in hiding."
He wondered for the first time in his life: What could James Potter have done, who could he have been, if he hadn't died so very young?
Death Eater!"
Sirius across the face with a fish tail.
Harry's breath was short. He clenched his fists, his nails digging bloody crescents into his palms.
He, Draco Malfoy, a
Harry screamed as it tore through him.
"That's not—" began Snape, flustered, "I never said—"
Hermione and Harry caught each other's glances while Ron only looked mournfully up at the ceiling. Eating regular meals, it turned out, was a habit, and one that they had lost during their year on the run. The past few weeks doing the understaffed, overworked Aurors' work hadn't helped matters.
He wasn't upset— at least, not about going to the dorm alone. It gave him ample opportunity to set up the wards he, Ron, and Hermione had perfected over their year on the run. He had found weeks ago that, despite Voldemort's defeat, he could no longer sleep without them.
It smelled fresh and free, ozone and wind, the lush evergreens of the Forbidden Forest, the sunbaked grass and the cool-clean water of the lake. The warmth on his face was the warmth of life, not flames. It mixed with the coldness of the wind, flushing his cheeks and the tip of his nose.
Harry didn't respond.
Sirius and Peter both made faces at the idea of a decent Slytherin.
"So, why do you think he defended you today?" asked Remus. His face was impassive, but it wasn't judgmental, at least. He seemed genuinely curious.
Despite what the rest of
Severus Snape, Draco Malfoy, and Harry Potter, all the same age, or near it.
Harry looked at him with interest and something else. Something more profound, though Remus shied away from identifying it.
Jets of light whistled in every direction; sparks danced off shields.
"Great, then," said Bowie, taking one long, last drag on his cigarette before flicking it off the stage. The few nearest students scattered to avoid being burned. "Professor Flitwick, let's do a reenactment of this morning, shall we?"
"What do we think of Parker?" asked Sirius. There was a cold, calculating glint in his eye that always made James uncomfortable.
Harry was tapping and rubbing the table next to the book, his gaze a million miles away. He did that a lot, both the fidgeting and the thousand-yard stare. He didn't seem to be aware of either habit, and Remus had been too polite to bring it up. Whatever issue Harry was struggling with, whatever he had needed healing potions and the first week off magic in class for, it was serious, Remus could tell.
Sirius huffed and went back to his food.
Draco had no idea how he would answer.
"Yeah…" muttered James, taking his turn to look at the floor while Sirius glared at him, daring him to argue.
"Prongs," said Sirius wearily, resting his face in his hands. "There was only one condition. The Quidditch one. We've
In all his years at Hogwarts, Harry couldn't remember hearing that about Flitwick before. Why hadn't he continued the dueling club in Harry's time instead of Lockhart?
He was yelling by the end, leaning forward to get in Sirius's space.
The pleasure turned to unthinking, animalistic terror at the sight of a wand pointed in his face. For that second, Harry could only see Dolohov's wand, hear the jeers of the Death Eaters, screaming,
Dumbledore blinked once. Slowly, as if in a dream, he took the wand and looked it over, that glazed expression still on his face. Then his eyes sharpened, and he examined Potter meticulously.
over him. Did the Gryffindor common room have a
The plan, therefore, was to research a solution in the library, and meanwhile, in case they never found what they were looking for, at least create an identity they could use in the outside world complete with N.E.W.T. credentials. If they hadn't found a spell to return them to their proper time by the end of the school year, they were doomed to live out the rest of their lives quietly, not interfering with the events they knew would happen.
With nothing else to occupy him, he wandered down to the common room, thinking of sitting in front of the fire.
"Evans. Lily Evans. And I've still got my final exams from previous years, if you'd like to see."
Even though Harry had been the one reminding Malfoy it was a safe, supervised duel, it was difficult to watch. After the first few exchanges, he had to turn away, close his eyes, and focus on breathing.
As N.E.W.T. students, there were few enough of them that all four houses had the same class together.
, if I ever touched his possessions again. And Draco, the utter prat, was just laughing the whole time like
Harry nodded. It wasn't his, anyway. He hadn't set up a subscription in this timeline, hoping to be gone before he needed to catch up on "current" events.
Sirius nodded his understanding, and four hands went idly to the wands in their pockets down the Gryffindor table.
A grim-looking man with a messy blond bun on his head and an overabundance of jewelry raised a whiskey flask and lit cigarette in greeting.
It always felt like he would wake back up in the tent.
So many others had died for him.
It didn't take him long to figure out he wouldn't be getting any sleep that night.
He reminded himself he wasn't there to stay, anyway. Though Draco and Dumbledore suspected Potter was the only one who could return them to their proper time, Harry had laughed at the idea. He had been no help to the point of
— wins. Come on."
The three boys hadn't noticed them yet. They could still leave and continue on their journey to the afterlife.
Indeed, Sirius's wand was lying useless on the ground next to him, doubtless slipped through his numb fingers before or after the lightning strike.
, to have proof they ought to have been more suspicious of Harry from the start.
One of the girls shrieked. Or it might have been Pettigrew.
He found himself trailing the loud ones— Sirius and James, Lily and Marlene— and falling into step with Remus, who was looking at him thoughtfully.
Harry Bloody Potter. Was that why he was restless?
And then another thought struck Harry, and he swayed where he stood from the blow of it.
"Welcome, you lot, to the first dueling club practice!" cried Professor Bowie, immediately hushing the chatter from the dozens of assembled students. It was the upper years' practice, mandatory, held separate from the lower years. They were in the Great Hall, the four long tables gone and replaced with a sparkling golden stage near where the high table had sat. He continued, "I have Professor Flitwick here with me as co-coach, since he has won not one, not two, but
She wasn't breathing. Her chest was still, eyes closed, her lips parted slightly in surprise.
Sirius, across from James and Harry, gave a fond chuckle. "Oh, Wendall the Wedgie Bat. Or should I use Wiggle Whipperpants this year?"
Draco opened his mouth to snap no, that he didn't want their seconds to try to talk either of them out of it for any condition, but he stopped. He smiled his own chilly little smile. "Yes," he said. "I will accept your
was the executioner, boy, not me," said Dolohov, with an amused, vicious glint in his gray eyes. "Me? I'm the
Harry stiffened in response. "Maybe you lot should change
Harry threw the Cloak over himself and headed to Gryffindor tower to return it before his absence became suspicious.
"Fine," said Rodolphus curtly, apparently taking the lead since Dolohov had cracked. "Give Dolohov back his wand, and we'll go."
He passed it to Harry, who frowned as he read over it.
He could congratulate Potter on apprehending Dolohov, Draco thought, summoning Addie to fetch his good cloak. Because of course Potter would succeed, with the whole Auror department babysitting him. And Draco needed to stay in Potter's good graces, at least until the trial was over. If he could get Potter to testify in front of the Wizengamot on his behalf, his case was as good as won.
"So," said Sirius, lounging against the door jamb like a damned underwear model. He was fully dressed, but his robes were open, his tie loosened to the point of falling off, and the buttons of his shirt were undone almost to his navel.
James grabbed Sirius's uninjured shoulder and leaned forward until their foreheads were almost touching.
"That would indeed be an incredible power," murmured Dumbledore. "He was using no magical artifact? No spell or ancient rune?"
He made a dismissive, shoo-ing gesture towards the Slytherin table.
The rest of the week passed with a stony tension among the Gryffindor seventh years. A line had been drawn yet again with the Marauders on one side and Harry and the girls on the other.
. Voldemort offered that deal and
"Dolohov won't be an easy arrest, Harry," said Kingsley Shacklebolt. He had moved into Fudge-Scrimgeour-Thicknesse's office for the practical purpose of being locatable, but he had yet to move any of his personal items in. He had only been elected in an emergency session the previous week, after Harry had thrown his whole-hearted, extremely coveted support behind him. Harry suspected that was part of the reason Kingsley had offered him, Ron, and Hermione Auror positions even without going through their N.E.W.T.s.
"He does only seem to have two volumes," observed Malfoy, smirking. "Even in the common room. He's either the picture of a soft-spoken, well-mannered pureblood heir, or a screaming banshee. There's no in between."
"He was
"The last thing we both saw was green light," said Draco, sinking back into his chair as he honestly considered it. "Potter was about to be killed, but I jumped in front of the curse. It
They howled like a couple of monkeys, grabbing onto each other even as they both sank to the floor.
"Pilchardo Dispucto?" asked Malfoy curiously.
TBC...
"You talked to him? When?"
Slytherins at Ilvermorny," came Lily's voice coming up on Marlene's other side. It was chilly. "Next time you want to make fun of someone's choice of friends, why don't you think first?"
It would have been painfully awkward, sure, but at least it wouldn't have been
"Mallory said the students were evacuated, remember?" Sirius cut into James's spiraling thoughts with the precision of a Legilimens. "C'mon, Prongs. It sounded like only a few of them snuck back to fight or whatever they did. The school definitely survived. Although I bet that Fiendfyre was tricky to put out."
Draco forced himself not to flinch. With all those looks he had received in the past month, he should be used to it.
"My family and I are from Britain," said Draco stiffly. "We only moved to America for a few years for my father's job."
James shot off a spell at Sirius's fireworks.
"Oh," said Harry. He watched the blush creep higher up Snape's cheeks, reconsidered what he knew of Snape's history, and felt instantly mortified. "
you were dead. I'm going to make it so that the Wizarding World never turns to you again. You're going to spend the rest of your life regretting the first time you ever heard Lord Voldemort's name."
He turned on his heel, and Ron and Hermione followed.
As the Snitch darted away from James, almost too quick to see, Harry snatched it out of the air.
"First years, please note that the forest is out-of-bounds.
"They were talking about Fiendfyre," said Sirius suddenly, frowning as his eyes clouded in thought. "That's powerful magic. And a student— that Vincent bloke— cast it. It sounded like he couldn't control it properly and it turned on him, but even being able to make something that powerful
"I haven't a clue," said Draco, "although Potter thinks we're both dead."
"I don't know…" said Remus. He chewed on his bottom lip, staring at the ground with an expression of distress. "If V-Voldemort attacked Ilvermorny… do we know if Ilvermorny…
"Elodie Greengrass," said the girl. She had a droning, subdued voice, but a cutting glint in her pale eyes. "And that fellow there with his nose already in a textbook is Severus Snape."
Ravenclaw lost its mind, standing and cheering, while the other Houses and teachers clapped and laughed good-naturedly.
"Poor sad sod never takes it any easier, either," Sirius added. "Quidditch tryouts or no, he'll be moping the rest of the week."
The portrait hole banged open, and James, Sirius, Remus, and Peter staggered through. They looked like they had been rolling around in the Forbidden Forest by the dirt and general disarray of their clothes.
He only gave a spiky nod, not meeting James's eye, and pushed off from the doorframe.
"Hey, Ferret-face!" Harry shouted into the fray. "Quit taking the piss and finish him already! His arm movements are too big, and he keeps leaving his left open!"
Footsteps came pounding up the corridor between the dorms.
Automatically, he started calling memories to the forefront of his mind. Luna, "
Draco opened his mouth, turning back to the elder Black to tell him, when he saw that Harry had accompanied Lupin down the table to see what was going on. As they leaned in to listen to Black and Potter Senior explain it in excitable whispers, Lupin's face grew exasperated. He rolled his eyes to the enchanted ceiling multiple times as if to ask for patience from a higher power.
Smiling a little to himself, Harry thought of Snuffles' ear, swished and looped his wand, and said,
This was no crime scene— at least, not yet.
And before Draco had time to cast aspersions on the idea of him and Harry—
The other three turned identical looks of bewilderment on him.
You can't have it both ways, Malfoy. That's just—"
"Not now," muttered Harry, stashing both the Elder wand and Dolohov's in his borrowed cloak. He moved to the girl and knelt next to her. "Hey, are you alright?"
He had only ever cared about Severus among the Slytherins, and Severus was currently a dark-hearted, ambitious, grudge-holding
" he cried, but not even silver mist emanated from his wand. His whole face twitched, and he tried again, "
Lily marched forward with a determined set to her jaw.
James covered his face with his hands. He couldn't see Remus's expression that way, but he already knew the dangerous, animalistic glint that would be in his eyes.
The breath caught in Harry's throat, and he took an involuntary step back— Dolohov's laugh, raising his wand—
Draco sent them a judicious sneer before returning to the Gryffindor girl.
He was enjoying himself.
No, Harry hadn't, but that was typical Dumbledore.
Draco clenched his wand until his knuckles were bloodless.
Draco didn't look back at his Housemates, but he nodded once and affected his own disinterested look. "Of course. Couldn't be more obvious, could they?"
He didn't know the girl, could barely see her face between all the blood and her shielding arms, but she seemed to be a Muggle or Muggleborn by the way she dressed.
"Vincent," said Harry. "And he— you don't understand, Draco. I still have nightmares— the shapes coming out of the fire— and I'm not fast enough, my reflexes aren't good enough, and one of the monsters leaps out of the flames and
"There's something wrong with them," said Remus musingly.
All around the table, Slytherins of every year were smirking knowingly to each other, jostling a neighbor in the ribs, or treating the rest of the Houses to predatory, superior looks.
Malfoy nodded once, still not looking at Harry, and repeated as if to himself, "He doesn't know."
Harry heard his blood rushing through his veins. His breath was too fast.
"He has his moods," said Greengrass sedately, "especially just after the summer hols."
Sirius led the way out.
"Po—Parker is fine," said Draco shortly, finishing with his bag and standing. "If he's not at lunch, you will probably find him in the library. If you'll excuse me?"
, but the rear halves of what looked like two trout.
"So?" asked Peter, next to Sirius, while the others attempted to connect those two statements.
Mention of revenge had been suspiciously absent.
"Good morning, Draco," said Lily Evans, interrupting the staring match.
"Wait just a fucking
The ground at Sirius's feet exploded like a grenade, blowing Sirius into the air yet again, this time engulfed in a mushroom cloud of fire and smoke.
A terrible night, yes. God, yes.
is more than we'll ever be taught at Hogwarts."
The injuries accumulated. A gash across the face. An arrow of fire through one shoulder. A stinging hex in the eye, a Jelly Legs curse to one leg, shrapnel striking like bullets—
He had that same drawn, haunted look now.
The room was a small study about the size of a professor's office. The walls were lined in bookshelves and the odd magical trinket here or there, and the main desk sat facing the two large windows overlooking the gardens. There were no spare seats for guests.
When he saw those warning signs, he redirected conversations as quickly as he could. How much it helped, and if any of the others noticed, he couldn't tell.
The part that threw him was: Why would Voldemort care anything about a sixteen- or seventeen-year-old child? The way Harry had phrased it had struck him as very personal. If Ilvermorny had been attacked, as James and Sirius both inferred, Harry hadn't just fought Voldemort for a split second in the midst of a much larger attack.
He gestured to see if he could help her up, and she gave a reluctant nod.
The Elder Wand slapped into his outstretched palm as if it had been thrown by a giant invisible pitcher. Harry flicked it at Dolohov and disarmed him before that terrible curse could fully form. He snatched Dolohov's wand out of the air in his other hand and stood in the mouth of the alleyway, radiating cold, shrieking fury.
Transfiguration had Harry wishing he'd done more preparation before jumping right back into school. Taking a year off while studying little more than Defense had seen his sixth year transfiguration knowledge dry up. It was far worse than the little things he usually forgot after a long summer holiday. Instead of forgetting details and specifics, he found he had forgotten entire spells and concepts.
it. I don't think dueling is fun for them. I think it's serious. And if that Mallory bloke was willing to challenge you to one over Snape… well…." Here was the uncomfortable conclusion James had finally drawn, and he glanced at Sirius in worry. He finished, gently but immovably, "I think you might have gone too far this time. If Mallory and Harry were both willing to fight to what, in their heads, would be to the death, and they hardly know Snape…. Well, Pads… that should probably tell you something."
The boys nodded.
"Is that the best you can do?
Draco had no idea who was more shocked to hear those words coming from Harry Potter's mouth: himself, a teenage Severus who had scarcely met Harry before, or Black, who looked unspeakably betrayed by his fellow Gryffindor.
Harry sacrificed one of the hands covering himself to pinch the bridge of his nose. His glasses, he noticed, were gone again.
Regulus's dark eyebrows raised, a practiced, elegant motion.
was just a joke.
The proprietor, a short man with a bushy mustache, opened the door, allowing the shop light to illuminate the man on the step.
"I don't know, Padfoot," sighed James, rubbing the bridge of his nose beneath his glasses for the millionth time, too.
The snake slithered onto the Slytherin table, and it would have been eerie, chilling even, had James not been able to hear Sirius's ridiculous commentary. The realism of the flame-snake, the powerful, graceful way it moved, the way its tongue flicked and it raised its body to stare at each student dead in the eye.
Sirius's face scrunched in consternation, but Regulus's lips tilted, the beginning of a smile.
Harry cracked a smile. "I doubt that. But that'll be good for a laugh later."
The sheets had been rumpled by Severus's less-than-graceful fall and then exit, so Draco didn't immediately notice the wet streaks.
"Would you like to be the challenger or challenged?" asked Bowie. He tucked his flask back into his trouser pocket and drew his wand.
. So, whichever of us got to you first, we wanted to say you don't need to worry about a thing this year, alright? We all know how hard it is being an outsider, and we've got your back. You'll have at least one of us in all of your classes, so we can show you to the classrooms and help you catch up on anything you missed from the previous years. And we'll never leave you to fend for yourself at mealtimes, and you'll never face a Slytherin alone while we're here, and… and…."
"Who's is this?" he asked, inspecting it appreciatively. Whoever owned it obviously loved it and took good care of it. The handle was well-polished and conditioned, the twigs neatly trimmed.
Sirius's face, illuminated in the dazzling white light, was wide-eyed and open-mouthed. He was frozen in shock.
"Tabbard's Pawn," said Malfoy as they hobbled toward him, a pair of cripples too proud to lean on anyone but each other. Harry could practically see the snarky comment about Gryffindors swimming behind his eyes, but at least he kept it to himself. "They'll be easier to bribe into silence than the lawyers."
His best bet was to distract himself for the time being.
"Parker called you a pureblood," said Severus, as neat and pointed as a needle.
Green light filled his vision even as something collided with him, throwing him back and ripping Ron's body out of his arms. He was aware of grabbing it on instinct, feeling warm skin under his hand, and then something wrenched in his gut, and he screamed again.
He and Severus turned on their heel and resumed their walk to the Slytherin table.
Sirius kicked him again.
. Not yet."
Harry listened, and as Remus talked, a slow, sparkling smile began to emerge.
And Draco saw red.
"And I shall bring Sirius Black as my second!" said Bowie dramatically.
They reached the mouth of a cramped, spindly alleyway and skidded to a halt.
They had been on the same side for just a moment there. Neither of them had wanted Snape tormented as Sirius had done.
Nice one, Remus.
Everything Voldemort had done in his rise to power was terrible, of course. Scarcely a month ago, they had almost lost Gertrude to his sick followers for no other reason than having Muggle parents. But the idea of an entire school full of children falling under his wand…. James didn't want to believe someone even as twisted as Voldemort could do such a heinous thing.
"Ah," said Draco, and his look of confusion cleared. He nodded to himself once, decisive, and said, "You've gone mad."
"Yes," Regulus said, after a measured pause. He was still looking at Harry as if Harry were a puzzle he meant to solve. "I did mean to congratulate you, Parker. It was impressive the way you analyzed Sirius's fighting style and saw his weaknesses so quickly. A man with your skills would go far… in life."
Harry crossed his arms. Ron held Hermione close against his side. Hermione's eyes glinted with a hard, bright light.
friend," snapped Harry irritably, coming to Ron's defense in an ingrained habit. "I can't remember which one of them it was, but one of them hit me in the back with a Bludger after I'd already caught the Snitch."
He had tried to kill Sirius in the Department of Mysteries.
That only made Harry laugh harder, and it sounded like it had the same effect on Malfoy next to him. His ribs and abdomen were aching with the effort of continuing to laugh. It
from you! And
Except Dumbledore had been consumed by the Deathly Hallows in the end, almost as much as Voldemort and Grindelwald had been. The only reason the Elder Wand could have come to Harry in Knockturn Alley was if it remembered its allegiance to him in the future. And he didn't know what Dumbledore would do with that knowledge— knowledge that Harry had accidentally accumulated all three Hallows at some point in the past year, and the Elder Wand was truly his.
"Shut up, Sirius," said Harry in a cutting tone, not missing a beat, though he grabbed onto the table as if to steady himself. "I just… I can't even look at you right now."
"Hm," said Severus. He took a drink of his juice, apparently content to let the subject drop, but Draco caught that dark, gimlet gaze on him more than once during the rest of the meal.
James Potter shot a sideways glance at Sirius without moving his head.
"Listen to me carefully," said Draco. "You do not get to personally decide who lives and who dies. Therefore, it is not your fault when somebody dies. If you want to play the blame game, look at it from my perspective. It was
Harry's words at breakfast came back to James.
Mulciber dropped to his knees he was laughing so hard, clinging to the doorframe to support himself.
He didn't know if he could do it. He didn't know how he had survived as long as he had without them by his side.
Sirius and Malfoy didn't seem to hear.
"Why would I be
"You may as well get patched up while we're here, Scar-head," he said. "What could it hurt?"
"You won, Potter," said Malfoy eventually, as they neared the library doors. "Why do you walk around like you were the one defeated?"
Quick, lasssssiesssss, give me your clothessssssss…. I can't let Sssaalazaaaar see my laaaaadyyy-ssssnake partsssss…"
, obviously."
. Their teacher had mentioned the words
Tonight was the night Dolohov was set to meet with his contact at Everest Wands. (Draco wasn't stupid. He had decoded the parchment before surrendering it to
"Now, any questions before our demonstration?"
"These dates are coded," said Hermione. "But I think— yes, I'm certain— there's one this week in Knockturn Alley. Harry—"
"Quick question, Professor," said Sirius, even as he assumed a dueling stance as natural as breathing. "You're not going to give me detention if I manage to hit you, are you?"
to his standards."
"Potter!" hissed Malfoy, coherency flooding back into his face. "Your hair! Fuck!
anything. He straight out said Voldemort was after him."
Malfoy continued staring at him. His mouth worked silently for a moment, starting, stopping, and starting again. Then he just shook his head and dragged his hand through his too-long hair.
And he was alone. He was alone for the first time since he'd stumbled into the wizarding world.
But sometimes…
They looked to Dolohov, who was staring at Harry as if someone had just walked over his grave and didn't respond to their urgent whispers if he knew him.
"Can't get to the coin—" Ron managed, diving under the checkout counter even as the marble countertop exploded over his head. "Can you—?
He edged in that direction, scarcely daring to breathe.
"You are clearly an advanced wizard," Snape bit out. "Leave Mallory to me.
Still, Draco didn't give a rat's ass about any of the others.
"Uh, I don't… care?" said Harry. He almost winced, preparing to have House points taken, when he remembered Snape
since first year. Between them and Crabbe, Draco had learned to place wards on his bed curtains and check for tampering every night.
"Then I forfeit," said James easily, wrapping an arm around Sirius's shoulder and urging him forward. "Congrats, you win. What a glorious occasion. You sure showed me. Et cetera, et cetera. May I be excused now?" He added to Bowie, who nodded. "C'mon, Pads, let's go. One foot in front of the other, there you go…."
"I have since seen the error of my ways," said Malfoy and, though curt, he sounded sincere. "Though, to be fair, we might have won that game with your friend's worthless efforts as a Keeper if you hadn't just snatched the Snitch right from under me. I was lashing out."
"How can you tell?" asked James. He ran his hands through his hair, though for once, it looked like a genuine reaction to stress rather than an attempt to look good for Lily.
He tried to feel the solid wood beneath his fingers, not the warm rush of Snape's blood. He tried to smell the Ministry office, musty and damp, not the ash and stone debris from the falling castle. He tried to see his own hand, pale against the dark desk in the dimly lit office, not the flashes of red and green spell-light he saw every time he closed his eyes.
"The DMLE is setting up wards around each of the Muggle houses on the list, and they'll have around-the-clock guards for as long as the department can afford it," James reported at breakfast a few days after the Quidditch tryouts. He was summarizing sections of the letter to an attentive audience. "Dad says they interviewed the Jarlsbergers' house elf, and she was convinced something had been wrong with Midge just before they fired her, so it gives credence to the idea Midge was under the Imperius. They're still searching for who could have cast it, though. Not much to go on there."
Harry could only stare in open-mouthed astonishment as James started toward them, and Sirius and Remus dove to grab him.
Why couldn't Harry have it both ways? Why shouldn't he defend both Black brothers, even from one another? If they only knew…
will take over and duel the primary. The second may defeat the primary, in which case he will stay and continue to duel that primary's second, or he may lose, in which case the original primary may duel the opponent's third, and so on. Basically, once we start, we are in this until one team is fully finished. There is as much strategy in planning the order of a team in dueling as there is in any Quidditch match. Understand?"
He didn't know how long he stood there, but, slowly, he became aware of staring into space, his breathing returned to normal and holding his wand, which had been stashed under his pillow, in a white-knuckled grip at his side.
So, he had been surprised but genuinely pleased to find Harry at the pitch watching the Gryffindor tryouts. That was a good sign his drunkenness would lead to a brilliant, wild night rather than a horrible blackmail night.
Harry only noticed it was over when the audience around him began to get up to leave. He trailed after them. His foot had barely stepped onto the grass at the bottom of the stands before Malfoy was there, cheeks flushed from the bite of the wind and brown hair swept back from his face like spun sugar. The rest of the Slytherin team made for the locker rooms, but Malfoy stopped by Harry and plucked his goggles from his face.
"Marlene! I need that owl!"
," snarled Malfoy, grabbing the back of Harry's robes and physically shoving him back against the wooden stands.
"They barely know Snape," Sirius repeated. "Do you think they'd feel the same if they knew he was a Death Eater? After whatever they've been through?"
"You know Rosier's one," said Sirius, shoving his hands deep in his pockets and staring at the floor. "You heard your dad complaining about the new policies his dad's enacting at the Ministry, forcing wizards to have a blood status interview before they can immigrate…. And the Rosiers run in the same circles as the Averys, and Avery would pull Mulciber in because he's shown the right attitude and has the right bloodlines…. Be serious, here, James. You think Snape has been their little cling-on for six years and hasn't even thought about joining them?"
And more than that…
The Elder Wand was a heavy weight in his borrowed cloak. He wondered why it had appeared, unless…. Its power would die with Harry if he died undefeated. Was it dead, too? Had followed him into the afterlife?
Sirius's lips twisted disapprovingly, but he bowed his head once.
curse," muttered Sirius, but James ignored him.
Seventh year in the Slytherin dorms— his first time around— had been hell. The son of a disgraced Death Eater, he had been a prime target for the others to step on in order to move up the hierarchy. Crabbe especially had shoved Draco's face in the dirt to curry favor with the Carrows, who had been impressed with his brutality in performing curses in Dark Arts class.
the Death Eaters. And Voldemort always has to make an example out of disloyalty."
And Harry himself just called Malfoy his friend,
Lily continued doggedly, looking painfully earnest, "I figured out what happened, you know, through the rumor mill. I'm glad…. It was very good of you to stand up for Severus like that. So, thank you. And I've already thanked Remus, Harry, but I'm so glad you two forfeited when it was over. I was absolutely dreading any of you getting hurt."
James thought uncomfortably of the rumors of Voldemort's Inferi army and wondered, only half-joking, if they had an infiltrator in their midst.
"'Another' can have multiple meanings," said Dumbledore thoughtfully. "It can mean, as Mr. Potter probably intended, 'another' as in, 'You will not kill
"—What?"
He thought about it some more.
"What? And let this scrawny Potter-looking runt get away with—?"
Draco found his voice when the other Slytherins— God, fifth, sixth,
"Using Dark magic doesn't automatically make you a Death Eater—"
Just as Draco was about to demand to be included in his thoughts, Dumbledore murmured, "
Draco looked around at the gourmet spread that had appeared at Dumbledore's clap and couldn't have felt less hungry.
Draco knew Severus's childhood hadn't been a happy one, though he had never bothered to ask for details. It soon became clear, however, that it took time for him to open himself back up to Hogwarts after spending time at home. It took the first week for the Hogwarts food to put a little color back in his cheeks, then the second week for him to stop looking so emaciated. It took days before he spoke to anyone, and then a full week before he spoke in more than monosyllables.
The war.
And Black… Black could probably just raise an eyebrow at the nearest witch and get a date on the spot. Salazar, the girls would probably be
James counted it down with what would look like an absent-minded tapping of his fork against his plate to the casual observer.
He couldn't recall mention of Voldemort taking the war to America, to Ilvermorny, but that wasn't surprising. The Dark Lord preferred to operate in the shadows, cultivating an atmosphere of uncertainty and fear. If nobody knew where he was at any given moment, people everywhere would be afraid of him, all the time. Nobody would dare move against him openly for fear of repercussions.
Harry pounded his fist on the floor, physically unable to handle any more laughter without dying.
. And then
stupid stuff."
Maybe it wouldn't help anything. Maybe it didn't mean anything.
Lily glared right back. "How's your everything bagel?" she asked cuttingly.
Draco started and swung to look at her.
Harry felt as if he were the one who had been hit. He staggered a step back, the pain of his own injuries rushing to the forefront of his attention, the smell of blood overwhelming — Dolohov's raspy, delighted laugh as Harry screamed for the hundredth time— the Death Eaters hooting and whistling as Dolohov systematically destroyed his clothes, leaving him naked and utterly defenseless— panic and
"Sad, what the world is coming to," said Gertrude quietly. She rubbed her ribcage absently, a habit she had picked up since her attack.
matron?"
Harry paused.
Draco shoved the idea aside and focused on Dumbledore, leaving a battered Harry Potter to a very determined Madam Pomfrey.
James and Remus looked at each other. Even Sirius sat up so that he could share in their consternation.
Severus's cheeks colored even as he scowled his most dire scowl, and he flew past their beds toward the bathroom. He slammed the door shut behind himself hard enough to rattle stone, and there was the distinct click of a lock.
Silence fell in their wake, broken only by the teenaged girl's muffled sobbing.
James knew he would remember the sound of breaking one of his best friend's ribs for the rest of his life.
But he so clearly remembered Dolohov aiming the Killing Curse at him. Harry
"Hm?" Harry glanced up from where he was supposedly working on his Potions essay, though he hadn't written more than a sentence in the hour he'd been there. Her question registered, and he caught himself grinning. "Oh. No, I just… I went for a fly after the Quidditch tryouts. It was… nice."
"I don't care," said Harry fiercely. "If there's even a chance we can catch him, we have to take it. He could go underground any moment and we'd lose him forev—"
Harry shook himself. It didn't make sense, but there was no one he could turn to. Ron and Hermione were gone— weren't even born yet but also just
"Where?" asked Harry.
The silence he left behind fell heavy and stifling.
"I used to," said Harry, shoulders tensing. "How can
Dolohov had been going to kill Potter, kill Draco, but Potter's last words had been,
, wrapped herself around. She regarded the Slytherins with venom in her gaze and upon her forked, candlelight-flickering tongue.
Herrod and Schrodinger were killed in the first few minutes. Then the Death Eaters formed a circle around Harry and Ron, blocking the exits and keeping them constantly deflecting hexes from all sides, even as Harry and Ron dueled other Death Eaters one-on-one inside the circle.
He could spend the rest of his life hunting Death Eaters and Dark wizards, and it still wouldn't be enough.
"Potter," repeated Dumbledore thoughtfully. His chin came down to rest upon his laced fingers. "Why would Mr. Potter think you're dead rather than, from your perspective, in the past?"
"It's a long story, Headmaster," said Draco almost as weakly.
fault they were dead.
He came upon two bodies just outside the front door, both supporters of the Dark Lord, though they had never risen to Death Eater status to Draco's knowledge.
"You don't have to be pureblood," said Sirius. "And you'd be surprised how convincing they can be when they want. Listen… what if Parker and Mallory were Death Eaters? Probably got cold feet when he saw what Voldemort was doing to his country and tried to get out. But you don't just
There was a pause, and then they abruptly began sniggering again.
He hit something hard and fell, and when he looked up, he saw someone who looked astonishingly like himself staring back, startled.
"Uh," said Draco eloquently.
"He's no Gryffindor!" shouted Sirius, leaping back onto the stage and clutching his wand. His robes had a scorched and smoking hole on the left side, show blistered red skin underneath.
"You know, the shield," said Sirius, waving a hand with effortless elegance, as if that would help clear up James's confusion. "When Mallory shot that gods-be-damned
As the two Marauders hobbled off to the infirmary, Bowie turned to the rest of the students and said, "Alright, you lot. Since the show's over, now it's your turn. Everyone, pair off. You'll be practicing your Shield Charms tonight, which all of our duelists demonstrated. Here's the wand movement again, and the incantation is '
"Why don't you and Mr. Potter stay here for the time being?" said Dumbledore kindly, seeing Draco's rising panic. "We have a week until classes start, and this bears discussion before you simply go out into the world and potentially alter history. Wouldn't you say?"
He settled into the bed nearest the door, careful of his still-tender ribs, and lay down.
"I know a lot of things you don't know, Ferret-face," said Harry, not looking at him. "What are you referring to in specific?"
Voldemort supporters."
"Thanks, Parker," said Malfoy, straightening his robes and dusting imaginary lint off his shoulder. He sounded as if he were merely thanking Harry for holding a door open or keeping the kettle warm.
"Harry Parker," said McGonagall.
Harry didn't know why. Voldemort had occupied that home. His followers had bled their darkness into every nook and cranny. He could only imagine the number of innocents who had lost their lives to the Death Eaters for
Remus gave him a sympathetic look and took the seat on Harry's other side.
He was sure it had something to do with the objects being Hallows, but he didn't understand why or how.
Mostly, Harry thought bitterly, he and Malfoy had gotten to know Madam Pince best. She was even stricter and more difficult to get along with than he remembered from his own time. The one time Harry had dared to eat lunch while perusing a book, she had caught him and made him fear for his very life— yes, Malfoy and Dumbledore had done a fair job convincing him he was alive and in the past, not dead.
annoying habit ever, Potter."
doesn't need any more of
Draco looked at Dumbledore, and the struggle within himself intensified.
He wondered for the second time in two days if it wouldn't be so bad to be sorted into Gryffindor after all.
"A complicated relationship indeed," came Regulus's voice, still droll, as he appeared with crossed arms and raised eyebrows. "Sirius, it seems we have a genuine Gryffindor-Slytherin mediator in Mr. Parker. You wanted to know what we were talking about? I insulted you, and he came to your defense saying you were the best person to bear the name 'Black' in generations."
" said Harry.
James hammed it up a bit, keeping the tension going as the lion apparently lazily went around stretching to show off his sleek, muscular body, and jutting his fuzzy, flickering head into people's chairs in demands for praise.
"And Regulus what?" asked James, dread filling his stomach like ice.
As soon as he stepped into the shop, he came face-to-face with a startled Rookwood and promptly blasted him through a wall with a
Draco faltered. Duels barely required seconds, and that was mostly a formality. He hadn't considered needing a third. He hadn't exactly been subtle about his lack of respect for the other Slytherins and their egos. The only one he could think of was Elodie Greengrass, but he doubted she'd be willing to duel a werewolf for him if it came down to it. She was civil, she wasn't a saint.
volunteers from your veteran seventh years! Boy, are they going to give you a show!"
It had been bizarre seeing Ollivander so young, and he had cut off the man's speech rather rudely, but he hadn't been able to help it. It had been even more bizarre seeing a young, slender Molly Weasley pulling toddlers Bill and Charlie by the hands as she ran errands in Diagon Alley. Her hair had been in beautiful waves down to her waist, and, for a split second, Harry had thought it was Ginny.
"Don't you—" began Harry, incensed, but he was interrupted by a pointed cough from the doorway into the Great Hall. He turned guiltily and saw Professor McGonagall leveling them a disapproving look. "Sorry, Professor."
"And the lightning Mallory shot at you in the duel," said James quietly. "I swear to Merlin's mother, I felt every cell in my body
Lily flushed but attempted a smile valiantly. "Ah, right. Silly of me. I keep forgetting."
Sirius took over.
But his anger was misplaced, and he just as abruptly felt ashamed of himself.
"Come on," said Harry, giving Ron an almost imperceptible nod.
Sirius grinned, just a few teeth shy of a snarl.
"Quite," agreed Draco dryly.
And it was directed at Harry.
Sirius and Remus had always told Harry he flew like his father. Now he had seen it for himself, perhaps for the only time he ever would.
"I don't—" Harry began, shaking his head.
James could tell he was losing them.
"Snape is mine," said Draco, not even glancing back at Severus to know he'd accept. Any chance to curse Potter Senior or Black, he knew he'd be on board.
"Mr. Black, do please get your hands out of Mr. Potter's trousers," said Dumbledore tranquilly, cutting through the excited buzz of voices in the darkness.
The last time Harry had seen it, the spell holding the floating candles had been destroyed in the battle, and Flitwick had still been too injured to recast it. The four tables had been vanished to make room for all the bodies.
They could be joking around, throwing around some harmless banter, and Harry would slowly relax with them. It would feel like progress. And then the smallest comment would set him off— a comment on the Chudley Cannons' chances that season, Peter wondering if Li Mei Chang would go to the first Hogsmeade weekend with him, Sirius talking about repairing that damned motorbike he'd bought over the summer from some neighboring Muggles, James bemoaning how his parents were still suffocating him at seventeen with their twice weekly letters, Remus muttering darkly about having to learn the Patronus Charm even though less than half the wizarding community was capable of producing a corporeal Patronus….
Flitwick tore the pointed hat off his head and threw it forcefully at Bowie's feet. He cried, in his shrill voice, "You have insulted my dearest bosom friend, sir! I demand satisfaction!"
"Mr…?" said Bowie expectantly.
have hit me or missed both of us. I'm certain it couldn't have hit Potter. But then we woke up in this time in Knockturn Alley, and he was saying the most ridiculous things…."
"It's none of your concern," had been Severus's cold response. "You made your position quite clear after your little duel with Black."
"Oh, yeah, that I believe." Malfoy sounded placated. Then, uncertainly, "What… precisely did you say? He's not stopping. Oh, Merlin, you've broken him. A lightning strike he survives, no problem, why not? But I leave him alone with you for five minutes and—"
Hermione—
They left their books for Madam Pince to return to the shelves and went their separate ways in the corridor outside.
Before the class had time to prepare themselves, a cloaked figure had appeared in front of James and shot a brilliant red spell from its wand.
Sirius's expression was almost funny. He didn't seem to know whether to be shocked, offended, angry, or confused. "You have no idea what I—"
"You're very good at this," Harry found himself saying, as James and Remus traded seats.
Draco stared, flushed beet red to the roots of his platinum hair, and whirled around to face the opposite direction.
"If you want to start another Muggle duel on the Quidditch pitch, you'll get your chance in just a moment," snapped Malfoy, getting right up in Harry's face despite the wand between them. "Look, we just spent the last five minutes going over all the traumatic experiences you've had with Quidditch, and that
"How very Slytherin of you, Mr. Potter. However… after seeing what's in your mind, I do not feel I can place you in Slytherin."
The war had taken too many things from him, too, but he hadn't gotten a choice about those. Why would flying be any different?
It hadn't been common knowledge by the time they had been flung backward in time that Harry
And they had gone back to what very well might have been Dolohov's first murder.
After an interminable amount of time, Madam Pomfrey burst into the office, her wand already up.
Draco sneered automatically at the thought of Potter and turned another sharp about-face in his pacing.
Harry found his teeth chattering, a familiar, all-encompassing dread filling his chest as a hooded, cloaked figure rose in the front of the room.
Regulus was a graceful flyer. Not flashy by any means, but a Seeker didn't need to be flashy. They just needed to be observant and fast. By his scrupulous judging of the candidates, he was both.
James squeezed Sirius's shoulder companionably as he considered his answer.
Harry stared at his blond reflection in dread. He just barely recalled working on human transfiguration in his sixth year— changing the color of their eyebrows, the shape of their nose, etc. It had come in handy more than once when he, Ron, and Hermione had been on the run and needed disguises when they ventured into a town for supplies. But he had no recollection of the spellwork involved in human to non-human forms.
This wasn't a meeting with a—
"You got banned after the first game," said Malfoy, his voice practically crackling from the dryness, "for attacking me like we were in a Muggle pub fight."
A bit off, that one, he and Sirius had almost instantly and nonverbally agreed.
For God's sake, Malfoy had shown
Instead, Draco had put Harry in that impossible position where he couldn't "do the right thing" and stay on good terms with his family at the same time.
was easy?" asked Harry. It sounded different than it would have before the war. There was no teenage angst and bravado. It was dry, grim.
Draco stilled.
It still irked James that his fellow Gryffindor had not only joined the Slytherin team, but he had also helped Mallory win that first duel. It wasn't even his duel to win!
Harry looked back at the matron, shocked, but then cowered under her stern look. His gaze shot to Draco, questioning, and Draco lifted a shoulder as carelessly as he could.
Regulus cast Malfoy an unreadable look before he nodded and glanced up at the still-playing Gryffindors.
would do well not to laugh at the Dark Lord's name," Snape went on imperiously to Malfoy. "Not with the company you—"
"Done with your library work already?" asked Remus, glancing at the stout grandfather clock on the mantle.
"It wasn't the same," Harry cut across him, before he could say something incriminating. He shifted awkwardly and looked away from them all. His breathing had sped up, become shallow. "Fighting for your life… for your friends' lives… isn't the same as a duel."
Malfoy, however, only nodded and murmured thoughtfully, "Like Bellatrix."
They were so quick, Harry didn't even have time to see their wandwork in order to copy it.
Harry caught a glimpse of frizzy brown hair through the shelf behind Malfoy, and he opened his mouth to ask Hermione to grab that Old English book of translations—
"Not so much," said Remus, giving Harry a wan smile. "He's never going to apologize, not to Snape. Uh— I should mention that's what seconds and thirds do in duels. Er, bearing in mind I'm not from a Founding Family or anything… we're supposed to see if there's a way to talk this out before letting it end in bloodshed, from what I understand."
"Anybody want to help Mr. Rosier?" asked Rosier, taking a puff on his cigarette. "Anyone?"
James Potter.
"You heard what Mulciber did to Mary last year, and she said Snape just stood there and
"Er—" he said, shoving the Cloak up his robes as surreptitiously as he could under the stares of the entire Gryffindor graduating class. "I— uh— what was the question? No, never mind. I really need to, uh, go. Bye."
Slap number thirty-two, second of the seventh year.
Harry felt his hackles rise, and he looked away from his future godfather. "Dunno," he muttered. "Must have heard it somewhere, mustn't I?"
"I will never regret challenging you, you gormless worm!" said Flitwick. "Harry Parker shall be my fourth!"
"Here we go," said Malfoy, at once becoming serious.
, but they so rarely talked about their parents it was usually easy to forget. He hadn't had such a mindboggling interaction yet. "I'm a half-blood, but my mum was a Muggle-born. I grew up with her side of the family."
Harry's eyebrows shot to his hairline. Ron and Hermione looked aghast and insulted.
chocolate cream pie—"
?" said Marlene mockingly, shooting the Marauder a venomous glare.
James plopped onto the bench next to Harry at breakfast the following morning as if it were the most natural thing in the world. He was playing with a Snitch exactly like Harry had seen in Snape's memory from his fifth year.
A small fission of cold fear swept through him.
First of all, maybe they could get utterly sloshed and have a great time together. Maybe it'd break down Harry's ridiculously high guard and help them become friendlier. One could never have too many friends.
Dumbledore fell silent for a moment, looking out at them. Candlelight flickered in his half-moon spectacles, obscuring his eyes. He continued more quietly, and the student body hardly breathed for fear of drowning his voice out, "I need not remind you what dark times we find ourselves in. The danger to our families, the danger to our society outside these walls has never been greater. I have always strived to make Hogwarts a safe haven for students. However, I need your cooperation and support in order to make it truth. Please, I cannot urge you strongly enough to do the right thing. Take care of one another. If you see anything strange or suspicious, report it to a member of the staff immediately. Obey the rules, even as pointless or restricting as you may find them. Only by actively choosing to be cautious, vigilant, and united will we get through this terrible time. Thank you.
Draco fought a blush and looked away, keeping his head held high.
they?
Harry's wand hand was shaking. Something tumultuous crashed behind his green eyes. He seemed to be struggling, but Draco didn't know if he was trying to hold himself back from cursing Black or trying to hold himself
Marlene wiped her eyes and glared at Harry, remarkably like her sister. "No, anybody
The smell of the feast wafting through from the kitchens added a layer of nausea to Harry's roiling gut. He forced himself to keep his eyes forward on the procession of first years. In his pocket, his fingers clenched around his holly wand, which he had reclaimed from Ollivander's on the previous day, grounding him.
? Is that why… I mean, it's just the two of them so maybe not, but… what if that's why Mallory and Harry are here?"
All eyes were locked on the mesmerizing display.
Draco was uncomfortably aware that he had little to no idea what Potter had been up to while Draco attended their seventh year at Hogwarts. School that year had been far from pleasant, even though the Slytherins were favored over the other Houses. It had been a shock even to their sensibilities to get a taste of what the world would be like under the Dark Lord's rule. It was a lot harsher even to purebloods, and watching his classmates from every House crumble under unmerciful, never-ending punishments had changed something in Draco.
It was a bold statement coming from an unarmed teenager, except for the throng of powerful,
they'd worked out in fifth year to mimic rain, and the next crash of firework waves exploded out of existence and left the whole of Ravenclaw House soaked, as if they'd taken a real ocean wave to their table.
Harry clung to his sleeve and tried to breathe, tried to ground himself in Malfoy's presence.
He clapped Sirius on the shoulder, bracing and sympathetic.
It came down to luck.
It would be raging in 1978. That had been near the height of the Dark Lord's first reign. His father would already be a Death Eater. There was nothing Draco could do to change that.
The name niggled at the back of Harry's brain, but they had more pressing matters at hand.
Severus shot him a narrow, thoughtful look and didn't speak immediately. He filled his own plate of breakfast food before he finally said, "You didn't need to do that. It was foolish. The Blacks are well-known for their dueling prowess and powerful Dark magic."
Dolohov and the Lestranges looked up, their expressions confounded.
He had
"They tried training us as recruits," Ron offered with a deceptively careless shrug, "but it turns out Hermione taught us all that rot in our first month of On the Run Bootcamp."
"Rosier and Wilkes," he repeated pensively, pretending to mull it over. Then, "No, I'm afraid it would never have worked out between us. Draco Mallory, at your service. And you are?"
been defeated. Hadn't he?
"Never!" said Bowie. "Though, if you wish contact, we will need thirds, as Black and Mallory are not on speaking terms. I name James Potter!"
"How dare you?" hissed Severus, white and shaking with rage. "I
"Hey! Hey, guys!" Mulciber shouted over his shoulder, toward the common room. "Guys!
. Nothing is going to change telling it five thousand and one times!"
"Why don't you run along,
"Oi, Scar-head, snap out of it," came a familiar drawling, snide voice.
Peter nodded into his dessert plate, covering his mouth with a hand as if politely to keep people from seeing him chew.
"Gosh-darn and blast it all," said Bowie, shaking his head. "They're not speaking either! We shall need fourths, if you are so cowardly that you wish to pass along your regrets for challenging me. I name Remus Lupin!"
Draco rustled through a sheaf of parchments on the desk and finally unearthed a small, scrappy bit like someone's last minute shopping list.
They made it to the first moving staircase that would lead them up to the infirmary, and James prodded him up the steps with quiet encouragement.
Harry stood and let his hands fall to his sides.
Even when they spoke of his and his parents' trial, he didn't get restless. There was a vague sort of resignation there, that what would be would be. He would plead his case, and if he was sentenced to Azkaban, then he was sentenced to Azkaban. He was lucky enough that he was one of the few even getting a hearing, and the only reason the Malfoys stood a chance of freedom was that Harry Bloody Potter had vouched for their change of sides near the end.
," Draco sneered, lip curling at the mere idea of being in a street starkers with Potter, "and why… ah… certain people weren't there to greet him, I suppose. Kept muttering about King's Cross Station. I don't know. He hasn't been making sense."
this year. And then, after that is done, you may choose three terribly generous individuals to help clean up the rest of this…" he gestured to the dirt and fertilizer, the puddles of water, the carnage of raw eggs, "…mess."
Dumbledore chortled and feigned scratching the great cat under the chin. Remus had it purr even louder.
The fire-badger stood on its hindlegs in the middle of Ravenclaw table, sniffing with its nose up high in the air, its smoky little whiskers quivering.
Malfoy stared at him, pale, with his lips slightly parted. Finally, he shook his head and muttered disbelievingly, "
"Fascinating."
"HA!" shouted James, holding up a round, feathery mass from the tangle of his and Sirius's limbs. "Go, Gingerweed, go! To Potter Manor!"
She was so alive. So
"I know what I said! And it
Harry found his wand in his hand in an instant, aimed at Malfoy's throat.
wasn't the one who nicked it…."
Harry and Lily stared at each other, wide-eyed and speechless.
"Don't worry about it. Just move faster."
Malfoy let out a startled laugh, and then he said, "Merlin, the sad part is I think you actually believe that. Was there a single year that went by
with Harry," said James, eyes brightening as they landed unerringly on Lily. "You didn't invite him as a…."
Harry's face, however, went slack with shock and then dark with fury.
"Draco."
The fire-badger went to town digging, and here Sirius cast a spell he had created to directly combat his mother's constant
"He's a tight-laced rule humper who's friends with a Slytherin," said Sirius without hesitating.
James understood.
His eyes had changed. They were no longer sharp and derisive. There was nothing gleefully mocking in his face anymore. There were bags under his eyes and faint lines of worry and grief.
Harry thought, confusion and fear writhing in his belly. Voldemort offered that deal and
Lily's easy smile took on a knowing twist. "Mallory, huh. Did he make it?"
"I never noticed a scar," said Remus.
He took a deep, shuddering breath, and then another. Empty-handed, ungrounded, he fumbled in his pockets for something to hold.
"Yeah," said Harry weakly. "Yeah…."
They were all looking at Harry as if they had never seen anything so fascinating.
"Right, thanks for that, Malfoy," said Harry. "It's been fun."
Harry looked away, swallowing hard.
Malfoy took a step back, his wide eyes boring into the side of Harry's skull.
"I think he's waiting for us to do a trick," James whispered to Lily, on top of whom he was still lying. "Quick, let's kiss. It's the only wa—"
"You say that every time, Padfoot!" James shouted, wrestling him for position on top. "But it's a pipedream! A
"Correct. Fire is the only defense against Inferi, as no spell has been found to prevent dead flesh from burning. Five more points to Gryffindor. I'd have given
"Ugh, that rogue Bludger to the arm. And then that imbecile removed your bones. Most disgusting thing I've seen in my life."
The tunnel behind the one-eyed witch statue leading into the cellar of Honeydukes was getting too small for them now, but James hadn't been able to think of another place Harry Parker was unlikely to interrupt them— the dorm, the bathroom, the Great Hall, the

Fred, leaving George alone. Remus and Tonks still reaching for each other. Colin Creevey and his goddamn camera.
Malfoy didn't hesitate. He ducked under Sirius's latest hex and shot a Blasting Curse of his own into the left side of Sirius's chest, which he had indeed left open after a grandiose movement for the Full Body Bind.
living soul.'"
"How'd you know that?" asked Sirius sharply.
Harry heard Ron's angry voice and Dolohov's laugh.
"Yeah," said Harry, moving away from the Marauders. "You'll— uh— have to remind me what thirds do. We never really got that far at— at our school. And I don't know etiquette like you purebloods…."
"Stop stalling, Black!" shouted Bowie from the sidelines, lighting up another smoke. "Hex your Charms Professor or I'll hex you!"
He didn't examine the thought too closely.
Draco didn't have anything by dawn.
Dolohov was patient. He took his time. He took pleasure in doing his work thoroughly.
"Nice one, Pads," said James, clapping Sirius on the shoulder with a grin.
"I won't pretend Sirius was in the right," said Remus. "He didn't tell any of us about it before he went and did it. But you've got to understand, the way they are, if Sirius hadn't done that, Snape would have started it with a hex in the hallway or a smear rumor started about, you know, whatever he thought would embarrass James or Sirius at the moment. They're not friends. James and Snape are fighting over Lily's affection, you
"Don't be ridiculous," said Harry, giving Snape a scorching side-eye. "Didn't you hear Malf— Mallory at breakfast? He's going to beat Sirius. For
Silently, he walked toward the Slytherin table, fuming and ashamed.
Lily shoved him off her with an irritated huff.
It took Sirius a moment to stop shoveling blackberry tarts into his mouth to catch it, but when he did, he cast James a surreptitious thumbs-up beneath the table. Cheeks still as full as a chipmunk's, Sirius gave Remus's toe a stomp next to him, and Remus jolted.
That, and the British and American magical governments had never especially gotten along. James's father had always said it was something about how they treated their Muggles, how they were so strict on enforcing their Statue of Secrecy, it bordered on fanatical. Given a magical government even more secretive than the Ministry, plus their distance and disenfranchisement with the British Ministry after the wide-reaching Grindelwald turmoil, James wasn't shocked the Magical Congress of the USA hadn't released details of an attack to the British.
"Oh, what now?" came Malfoy's voice. "Did you tell him a dirty joke? Those are supposed to be for me!"
believable."
Marlene McKinnon had said she owed him. Where had
"Pads, that's… I didn't know that."
Peter and Remus flinched at the name, but James only clenched his jaw a little tighter.
Harry looked at Draco with fiery determination. "I'm your third."
"Alright," said Malfoy. "Meet me out at the pitch in thirty. I need to change first."
Harry barked out a startled laugh as he mounted the broom. "I've never heard someone scream
shouted Harry.
Then Malfoy said, sounding both angry and shaken, "What the hell was that, Potter? McGonagall was right; that was a transfiguration lesson, not a free-for-all! And I thought you
The creature wailed in agony before Bowie flicked his wand again, and it disappeared.
when he had been killed— but he had figured out it wasn't Malfoy's doing. Malfoy had no more desire to see another rising Dark Lord than Harry did.
It had been hard sitting at the welcoming feast as a stranger among the Marauders. It had been uncomfortable going to breakfast and making small talk with Remus and Mary while James and Sirius bickered with Lily and Marlene. It had been surreal sitting in a classroom with them as an equal, a regular student among regular students.
On Saturday morning, Draco fell into step beside Harry and the Gryffindor girls as they lined up to head into Hogsmeade. Filch was, inevitably, checking permission forms from all the younger years.
"Uh, practicing the Shield Charm?" said Harry. "Do you want to try to jinx me, or should I jinx you?"
James capitulated, allowing Sirius to guide them closer to the pitch, where Mallory and Parker were just meeting.
Voldemort had tortured
"It is weird you're here," Harry conceded. "Dumbledore had already died when he met me at the crossroads. I figured it was his spirit or something, since he wasn't a ghost. But last I saw, you were alive and— well, not
The destruction was horrific. Bodies lay strewn about the floor amidst broken shelves, exploded walls, and disintegrated merchandise. It smelled of burnt flesh and blood.
He was polite and quiet, and he mostly spent his free time with the girls or in the library, but there were sticky moments whenever he interacted with the Marauders either in class or in the dorms.
"That must have been hard," said Remus, and the words sounded pale in comparison to the depth with which he felt them. "I know it's… it's tough out there in the real world at the moment. The worst we have to deal with here is detention. I can't imagine…."
"Good for him. Well, either way, I'm glad you had fun."
The terror mounted, gripping around his throat like Pettigrew's enchanted silver hand. It was choking the life out of him.
"Mr. Malfoy," said Dumbledore, "I think it would be in everyone's best interest if I did not know—"
Dumbledore's last will and testament. Months in a cold, dingy tent struggling to figure out what those last words meant, if it was a clue that could bring down Voldemort or save their lives.
"Speaking of the Three Broomsticks," said Sirius, also ignoring James and Marlene's duel-slash-food-fight, "we need to stock up on booze when we go out. We're about to be
Someone grabbed his arm, and Harry reacted violently, ripping his arm free and stumbling backwards.
Remus nodded, and Peter quickly said, "Yeah!" But Sirius didn't look pleased.
"But why would he…?" Sirius began, plaintive, for the millionth time.
Harry's feet moved before his mind caught up. He found himself between Malfoy and Sirius, wand raised and crying
Sirius got him in a headlock and toppled him off to the side. "I
Harry thunked his head against the shelf behind him, squeezing his eyes shut.
Malfoy stared at him like he had grown a second head.
"Do they know each other from childhood?" asked Remus, cocking his head to the side in curiosity.
Harry frowned at the undoubtedly intentional pause in there. It was clear he meant to imply something else, something specific, but seemed to be feeling Harry out before he confided his true thoughts.
After an uncomfortable moment in which the trio catalogued the points of ingress and egress, potential hiding spots or weapons, the door swung open.
bad to happen to him…."
Harry scowled and pulled again at his altered hair.
Potter had a break after Transfiguration, but Draco had to leave for Alchemy. Draco had been thrilled to enroll when he'd first seen it. There had never been enough interest among the other students in all four of his last years at Hogwarts, but these students in the past had better taste than his peers, it seemed. Now, his excitement was subdued in the face of Potter's breakdown.
It didn't matter, another voice countered, because Sirius was already dead. Nothing could hurt him anymore.
Once everyone had had their fair share, the badger dropped down, shifted, and became a snake in the grass.
He had been grilled, all under the veneer of politeness, on his blood status and family ties his very first night. It had been a tricky dance for Draco to navigate. He needed enough connections to make staying in the Slytherin dorms livable, but he had to be especially careful not to drop names of wizards who could be easily reached and questioned.
Where were the Aurors? Was it their bodies in the front room? And where was Granger? Draco knew she was the real force to be reckoned with among the Golden Trio. Surely, they hadn't gone after
A sound of scuffling caught Harry's attention, too, and he and Malfoy shared a look of confusion before Malfoy realized he was, again, staring at a naked Harry Potter. He spun back around and fiddled with the clasp of his travelling cloak.
"I understand why I can't remember," said Malfoy eventually, "seeing as I wasn't even in your House. But it concerns me that you can't even remember."
"That's not— I can't—" Harry struggled to find the words, struggled to contain his irrational panic, but then gave up. He made to push past Malfoy toward the school, gasping for breath.
"That doesn't make it okay," said Harry thickly. "They're old enough to know better. I've just turned eighteen— summer birthday— and when I was seventeen, I was worrying about… about much bigger problems than House rivalries and girlfriends."
Ridiculous, proud, stubborn Gryffindors. It was no wonder McKinnon had gotten herself killed, a Mudblood as cocky as her.
"Because it was the right thing to do! Because I couldn't do nothing!"
James pulled himself together with a grimace of sympathy.
TW: Panic attack ahead
how true that was, seeing both Harry and Lily together.
"Hm," said Remus. They walked a handful of steps in silence. "He might be missing home. Maybe you're the closest he can get. Maybe it took traveling a few thousand miles away, and bunking with Slytherins, for him to realize you're not that bad."
White, silver, and gold streaks seared into the air to join the stars in the enchanted ceiling. There was a flash like sunlight, and then the hundreds of burning projectiles fluttered softly back to the ground, their shapes changed into that of delicate, glowing white lilies.
And Dumbledore's wand had been missing that day Harry had accidentally summoned the Elder Wand. It stood to reason the Cloak had come from James's trunk, not the future timeline.
"We both heard it, Moony," said James tiredly, raking his fingers through his hair. "He didn't
Well, if Remus was in on it, it couldn't be too bad, Harry reasoned, returning to his breakfast. Remus would at least warn him if it were terrible.
"Rosier, sir," said the boy. "Evan Rosier."
Remus had grown up to be an exceptional wizard. During the Battle of Hogwarts… there had been so much going on, all of it so fast and so unpredictable. Harry didn't know what had happened during Remus and Dolohov's duel, but he very much doubted it was anything like the controlled conditions of a dueling club.
He proceeded to ignore Rosier and Wilkes with the magnanimous grace he'd picked up from his mother at holiday balls. She had normally employed it against those pureblood and half-blood families with recent besmirches to their names— a daughter marrying a Muggleborn, a son producing a squib heir— but Draco had learned the tool well enough to use it for his own agenda.
Harry looked away, suddenly self-conscious. At least his thoughts on Dolohov had been derailed.
Beater.
Draco's heartbeat thrummed like a hummingbird's wings in his veins.
He had also grudgingly acknowledged to himself that Malfoy probably—
"Last time I
"I didn't really expect your friend to last this long against Black," Snape muttered to Harry, as the violent, fast-paced duel dragged on. "He must be quite talented."
Unless it was Dolohov.
He thought of Crabbe burning in his own Fiendfyre.
He was still clutching the Snitch in one hand, forgotten.
"Oh," said Draco. It hadn't occurred to him that Potter might already have made plans for the day. Plans that hadn't included him. He glanced at Harry, who was unusually twitchy, shoulders tense, hand hovering near his wand-pocket, head on a swivel. He didn't even seem to notice Draco's presence. Draco stopped himself from rolling his eyes. He returned his attention to Lily and said politely, "If it's not too much trouble. I would hate to be an inconvenience."
Draco forgot his question. Fortunately, Harry didn't seem inclined to answer it, anyway.
Harry kept placing one foot in front of the other, a habit of not-dying so many times, until he reached his old familiar table, filled with unfamiliar bright faces.
Severus… would be in his seventh year at Hogwarts. He hadn't taken the Mark yet. He hadn't
Draco eyed him in disbelief. And he'd thought they were scraping the bottom of the barrel for Defense professors in the

Dolohov glanced back at him and laughed. So did the remaining Death Eaters.
"I brought you a broom," said Malfoy. "The pitch is free now that Slytherin tryouts are over. Let's go for a fly."
"It still feels weird to me, too, sometimes," Harry admitted. "I grew up with my aunt and uncle, who were Muggles."
Finally, the lion jumped onto the table and sauntered straight up to Lily. It sat down in front of her and stared, heavy-lidded and purring.
"I… can't… breathe…" gasped Malfoy. "You would… have made… a
… plans?"
want to know is why Voldemort would try to kill him. It was Mallory's friend that cast Fiendfyre, so they're obviously not afraid to use Dark magic. And…." He trailed off.
He thought of Dumbledore falling off the Astronomy Tower, the light already gone from his eyes, after Malfoy had disarmed him.
And then Severus had taken that burden from him. When Draco had been too spineless to cast the Killing Curse, Severus had done it for him. He'd shredded his soul so that Draco wouldn't have to.
"Oh, not at all! Any friend of Harry's is a friend of ours."
"That's right, sir."
He didn't know where the strength came from— he hurt in ways he had never known he could hurt— and he definitely didn't know where the power came from.
With that, the floodgates opened.
He placed his hand on her shoulder, and she flinched violently, crying out.
Regulus ghosted from Harry's side to take charge of his Slytherin team candidates, directing them and the equipment toward the center of the field.

Thanks for reading, and thanks to Stoneage_Woman for the beta read! Don't be too hard on Sirius just yet. I know that was a super dick-move, but he'll get better. And this was a pretty short chapter. The next one should be longer again (the duel!!). Thanks for all the support, and stay tuned! ❤

"Yeah," said Sirius, "or maybe another great black dog will find his way to pissing all over your bed."
"He's a bit delicious, isn't he, your Ilvermorny friend?" asked Marlene, sliding neatly up to Harry at the end of class. She was throwing a heavy-lidded look over her shoulder at Malfoy. "I don't usually go for Slytherins, but that was just sweet how he stood up for you."
He didn't even have to open a door to see into the back room, because there was already a hole in the wall the size of his mother's dress robes closet.
He couldn't breathe.
Rosier's smirk became more of a scowl. "
Lucius, like all pureblood fathers, had taught Draco dueling etiquette from an early age.

Draco's hands were shaking. He clasped them tightly in his lap.
They grabbed Harry around the upper arms, holding him in place. One of them took his wand.
"Fine," spat Sirius. He picked up the hat and held it up like a flag. "Granted. I accept your challenge, Mallory. Wands. Midnight. The Forbidden Forest behind Greenhouse Six. James is my second."
"Hm," said Harry. "That's weird. First year, maybe? I ended up in the hospital wing, but I don't think it was Quidditch related…."
Sirius gasped as if he had been stabbed.
Snape shot a startled and annoyed look in their direction at the outburst.
"And he could cast a Patronus at thirteen?" Remus muttered, definitely to himself. "Unbelievable. And I
"Get it together, Scar-head," said Malfoy, and Harry felt the pressure of a hand grasping his shoulder. He clung to it, trying to ground himself in any way he could. Malfoy continued, "You've never seen me play Keeper before. You've got to watch."
Eventually, Harry asked, "Does he hate me now? Sirius, I mean."
"I got you, buddy," said Sirius, and he reached for his own wand, the duck head clamping it in a bright orange bill. A sweep and loop of his wand later, their hands returned to normal.
"Don't be idiots!" snapped Draco with as much disdain as he could muster. "It was those bloody Gryffindors, the— what do they call themselves?— the Marauders. Snape had barely sat down."
"I don't want to start a fight with them!" said Harry, exasperated. "Just like I'm not trying to start a fight with you. Look, I know Lily used to be your friend. Shouldn't you be supporting me and my— my—
The class was looking pale. Their breath frosted in the air.

Harry glared at the ground, chest heaving, blood pumping in his ears.
Harry found himself fighting a blush of embarrassment as James glanced over at him, seeing he'd made no progress at all.
Harry started forward, horrified, his heart in his throat—
Harry didn't appreciate the Malfoy inside his head, but it was
It had only been a month ago.
"Is that it?" asked Draco. His gaze was almost feverish. "Are we even?"
And then he was out of Hogwarts, the battlefield, and in a dark, abandoned shop in Knockturn Alley.
"Then why are you
Draco frowned and, after a moment, pulled out his wand. He approached Everest Wands slowly, at an angle out of direct view of the front windows. Hesitantly, he weaved his wand around himself in a disillusionment charm. Maybe the Aurors had closed the street after the arrest? But it didn't hurt to be cautious.

"No, we were
Malfoy fumed. "You've been holding something back. I didn't know for certain until yesterday evening, but then you lied to Dumbledore. I know you didn't just
Draco wanted to argue that of course he did; his mother was a Black. But Draco Mallory had been in America for the past decade. He couldn't claim to know British society as well as he did.
Harry didn't even seem to notice Draco's reaction, didn't seem to think it was anything more than an obvious, automatic response. His gaze was already darting through the courtyard again.
"Sure," said Lily. "Just checking on you. We could hear you cackling from across the hall. See you back in the tower."
Remus passed Harry a square of parchment and quill, and Harry passed it to James silently.
After what they had been through, the war and the torture and the desperation…
"I'd rather keep our discussion between us, thank you."
He was ready to move on. He was done.

Shattering glass and bright flashes of light came from the front of the shop.
He hoped it was the latter, just for old time's sake.
Lily scoffed and Marlene laughed outright.
"Another classic Slytherin sentiment," said the hat. "But, Mr. Potter… you walked to your own death."
Malfoy continued, unaware, "Marlene McKinnon was one of the original members of the Order of the Phoenix back in the Dark Lord's
Remus sighed. He flicked his wand in that particularly effective way Harry did when casting
"It's alright," said Hermione. She watched him, worrying her bottom lip, and Harry saw the struggle behind her eyes. Eventually, she sighed and said, "You can't keep going like this, Harry. Don't you think you should take a break before joining the MLE? Take some time for yourself?"
"Well, why didn't you just say so?" asked the hat jovially. "In that case, it's easy enough. You'll go to GRYFFINDOR!"

He saw Hermione race past him out of the corner of his eye, straight for Dolohov, who had broken off mid-sentence with the proprietor when Harry attacked.
who won't have you bitch-slaps you back into place. Go on."
Then the badger dropped to all four legs and scurried off, startlingly fast. It raced around the Great Hall under Peter's direction, stopping suddenly to sniff or darting unexpectedly toward someone. The students laughed as the badger went to harass the Hufflepuff table, trying to climb on students and nose into their pockets.
"Right," said Bowie, his voice carrying. "We shall demonstrate how a duel in numbers works in reality. Professor Flitwick and I will try to incapacitate one another, and once one is incapacitated— I know not yet which of us, though I regret it may be me— his
Then Sirius Black caught sight of them. He lifted his head, made a show of sniffing the air like a dog, and said, "What's that smell? It smells like someone pissed their pants. Oh— hi, Snivellus!"
"We were just on Gimmick Street at Everest Wands in Knockturn Alley," continued Draco forcefully, rushing to get the words out before Harry could argue. "There's Tabbard's Pawn, across the street, like it should be, but Little Snek's Rare Pets isn't beside it. It's a grubby patch of grass, like Little Snek's never existed. And we're standing in the exact place Everest Wands should be, but there's just that grimy old shed attached to the lawyers' office over there. And the lawyers' names should be Hildebrandt and Kosh, but it's Chattem and Sons. It
The lightning struck the shield like boiling water crashing into ice. Steam billowed around them, scalding and thick. The force of the blow knocked Harry backwards almost into Sirius, but he ducked his head against the pressure and held his wand in both hands, giving the shield everything he had. Eventually, his feet stopped sliding backwards, and he felt the pressure bearing down on him lessen.
Peter sniggered as he twitched and flicked his wand, going after a girl who had called him a dunce on the Express a few hours earlier.
"Yeah, you arsehole, I still remember you dressing up as dementors the next game trying to get a rise out of me, thanks."
"You saw him at the welcoming feast," said Sirius, suspicion and distrust flaring in his blue eyes like unholy fire. "He had no appreciation for our hard work! He looked

Harry couldn't see the look that crossed McGonagall's face, but her tone had gone softer when she said, "Mr. Potter, see that Mr. Parker finds his way to the infirmary, please."
"Don't talk to Padfoot like that!"
Hermione didn't move.
Fighting like his life depended on it.

"Vince is the one who tried to kill us," said Malfoy firmly, and Harry glanced up to see him looking hard at Harry, like he could tattoo his words onto Harry's brain if he tried hard enough. "You are the one who saved us. And if you couldn't save Vince, too… well, that's war, isn't it?"
"My mum's worried," said Mary, clutching her own letter, which was on a sheet of composition notebook paper. "She says the Aurors have been training her and Dad what to look for to know if a wizard is stalking them, and they have to come up with passwords and such to know if the other is under an Imperius Curse."
"If it helps," said Harry, also feigning interest in the professors' duel, "Sirius tends to favor the Blasting Curse. He's quick, but he can get distracted… playing around…."
Lily was looking at him with such earnest pain and sympathy in her green eyes.

"Blimey," James said loudly, saving Harry from further stammering. He was looking at the Prophet with a stormy, pained expression. "The Jarlsbergers were found dead yesterday. Henry and Midge. They were friends with my parents."
He took off at a trot toward the sounds of a fight in a nearby alley.
"POTTER!" he bellowed so loudly and so suddenly, Harry almost jumped out of his skin. "GET YOUR RUBBISH TEAM OFF MY PITCH BEFORE WE START USING YOU FOR TARGET PRACTICE!"
Beside him, Snape went rigid, following his glance.
"Sorry," said Harry sheepishly. "I haven't meant to be."

The berk's arrogance knew no bounds; of that, Severus had been entirely straightforward.
enjoy a student who studied over the summer break.
Malfoy preened under the attention, though Harry doubted anyone else would notice. They hadn't spent seven years getting to know the prat's moods from across a crowded classroom or Great Hall like he had.
"You'll still have Peter to cheer for you in the otherwise deserted stands," Remus told him with mock solemnity. "But I, for one, thought this would be my only chance in
That wasn't Hermione on the other side of the shelf.
"No," said Remus, straightening. He paused, and something in his posture shifted, softening. He sighed. "Listen… I love you guys, you know? You were my first and only friends for a long time. But Sirius, Harry
"Of course not," said Harry, pushing out the chair opposite him for Remus.
It was surreal, almost mesmerizing, to watch James toying with it knowing that a Snitch… sometime twenty years in the future, a Snitch holding the Resurrection Stone would bring James back as a ghost.

Lost in the dementor's misery, he had forgotten Malfoy was there. He'd forgotten where he was— in the past, in front of the only people in the world who would recognize his Patronus's form for what it was.
"Oh, come on, you don't know he's a—"
Harry looked at Malfoy, considering, and swallowed hard.
"Good," said Bowie. "Once we are out, Flitwick and I will referee. We expect nice, clean duels from all of you. Nothing illegal, nothing lethal. Got it?"
Rosier scowled. Several of the Slytherins looked offended on his behalf. The other students remained silent.
"Possible," he said gruffly. "But the wand movement is wrong."
"Moony, we've already told you everything
Draco could no longer sleep in the company of others, and that all his dormmates were present or future Death Eaters did not help matters.
"We learned how to light a candle in first year, Potter," she said, pulling out her wand. "I think I've got this."
"Ow!" Harry scowled and moved his knees closer to Remus, hopefully out of Sirius's range. "How should I know what they're talking about? I don't have Extendable Ears."
"Enough!" said Dolohov. "We need to leave, now!"
A dementor.
Harry found himself on his feet, gasping for breath, his wand pointed at James's chest. James's wand clattered to the floor at Harry's feet, the result of an

"Oh, not this again," muttered Malfoy behind him, sounding aggrieved, but Harry ignored him.
He couldn't tell which bodies were stunned and which were dead. He recognized most as Death Eaters, but there were a couple he didn't know at all.
Draco hesitated and then nodded. A week. Another discussion. He could do that. That was a plan. He
He had gleaned over the past two weeks that the oddly-named gang was something like the predecessor to the Weasley twins in his time: Pranks were their bread and butter. The rest of the school knew to stay on their good side lest they become the next targets of a well-aimed Levitation Charm or bucket of hippogriff dung. Moreover, the rest of the school

Sirius, wipe that ugly look off his face—
And when Mallory had finally spotted his target, he'd had a surprisingly good offensive game.
It didn't last long. Within two seconds, he was in a full-out duel with Rabastan-Fucking-Lestrange.
The Gryffindor team whooped and descended in a flurry of scarlet and gold and breathless laughter. Harry caught the smell of the wind on their robes, fresher than rain and even more exhilarating. They tromped past the Slytherins without even glancing at them, heading back toward the locker rooms.
Draco gave an elegant shrug and waited for his goblet to fill itself.
Gertrude slowly, painstakingly unwrapped herself from her ball. She struggled to sit up, but Harry battled his inner hero and didn't help her. He knew she would be better off without him rushing at her, even if he knew his only intention was to help.
He understood, unfortunately. He wanted to be angry; anger was familiar, safe. But he knew intimately how one just reacted when a wand was pointed in one's face, how
It was like the Battle of Hogwarts all over again, though.
On the street harboring Everest Wands, the lights were out. The streetlamps as well as the lights inside the various shops. Nobody roamed the street. Nobody was in sight. It looked like the shops were all closed, but Knockturn Alley
Because apparently Harry thought they were dead.
"I'll take him, Professor," said Malfoy, and then he was urging Harry to stand.
"I challenge you," said Draco, "to a duel. Wands only. Midnight. You choose the location."

Severus had shouted Potter's name so many times during their years at Hogwarts, it took Draco a moment to remember this Potter was Potter Senior,
"Oh, no you don't! Don't think I haven't noticed the state you're in, young man. Hop into that bed there. Quickly, now, if you please!"
"Magic… though mysterious and powerful… is as a force of nature," he said. "It is bound by laws of action and reaction, cause and effect. It must make sense, even if we do not see all the pieces that led up to a particular outcome at the time. People, on the other hand…. People, I have found, are just as mysterious and powerful. But they are not bound by the same rationality."
you?" Harry demanded, shoving him hard. He was aware of movement around them, professors and the other students getting over their shock and stirring into action, but he could barely see them through the dense, lingering mist. "I
The staircase arrived, and they climbed up.
She managed it, leaning exhausted against the brick wall behind her.
"He was friends with Lily for years, though."
"You go to Hogwarts?" Harry asked, frowning. The name McKinnon tickled at his recollection again.
Harry looked up to find Snape's dark, bottomless eyes on him. Astonishingly, he didn't look judgmental or derisive, but there was an intense, piercing quality to his gaze.
hadn't Remus paid more attention?
Remus resumed pacing. His poor shoes, already worn low in the heel, wouldn't last the school year at this rate.
Harry caught himself staring at the Snitch, a feeling of dread curling in his stomach.
Dolohov's curse of purple fire, laughter—
Message received down the line, Sirius looked pointedly at the boy sitting between them, Harry Parker, and then tilted his head at James, a question made to look like he was smoothing his fine, wavy hair in front of the ladies who were staring at him.
Sirius was the only one who looked comfortable, lounging behind them like he was at the beach. And he was taking this turn of events much better than James had expected. He seemed pleased,
This James looked entirely suspicious as he tried to feign innocence, a kid out for petty revenge.
Snape nodded once and returned his attention to Sirius and Flitwick's match, satisfied.
"Write to your dad," suggested Sirius. "He deserves to know, if he hasn't figured it out for himself already. And he's got contacts in the outreach program from being friends with Midge so long, right?"
"Ah, Rosier," said Bowie darkly. "Your father is head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation, isn't he?"
Knockturn Alley—"
And the Cloak had responded.
How long did he have left? Two years, two and a half?
"What were you and Regulus talking about?" Harry asked, forcing his mind back to Malfoy instead of a clearing in the Forbidden Forest filled with Death Eaters, Hagrid, and Voldemort.
"Yes, obviously," said Harry. "We're
, could it?"
"This
Then Malfoy was howling with laughter right beside Harry.
Hufflepuff didn't think it was quite as funny, given it wasn't a real badger but
It hurt. She and Dumbledore were the most difficult to be around because, despite being two decades younger, they still looked like themselves. They looked like
"It was great," said Harry, his defenses weakened with honesty. "You're an amazing flyer."
"And now you've insulted me, he jumps to my defense," finished Regulus. He glanced sidelong at Harry and said to Sirius, "I wonder what he would do if I insulted you to your face? Which of us would he jump to the aid of?"
Even young, Harry had nothing else to think about Wormtail, Peter Pettigrew, the
The little balls of flames detached themselves from the candles and rose into the air. It took the students and teachers a few seconds to even notice, but then they quickly began "ooh"-ing and "ahh"-ing.
"Yeah, Parker, that was
"Moony—" he began weakly.
Since Ron and Hermione's…
Above them, the eagle dove into the dispersing water and landed on the table a yellow and black badger.
Two and a half years for Regulus Black to become one of the grasping, decomposing Inferi beneath the surface of a lake in a far-distant cave.
"We talked about this, Prongs!" Sirius said, clinging to one of James's arms while Remus braced himself bodily against the other. "Stick to the plan!"
Thank you for all the comments, follows, and favorites! And, of course, thank you Stoneage Woman for beta-ing! Y'all are the best! 💖
Two of the three Hallows had come to him in a moment of need, even though… even though they didn't belong to him. Not in the here and now. The Elder Wand was still Dumbledore's, just like the Cloak was James's.
"Sorry," he said, "what?"
Harry, James saw, was frowning harder, displeased. Then James noticed an equally dark warning look from McGonagall and Slughorn, and he quickly moved onto his part.
Remus sat down and tried very hard not to look guilty when Madam Pince stalked by. There was no way she knew it was him under the Invisibility Cloak checking books in the Restricted Section for their map, right?
gone; he'd never be able to turn to them for help again— and Harry was leery of how Dumbledore would react to Harry's knowledge of the Hallows. Power, Dumbledore had said, had always been his own temptation. Harry couldn't blindly trust Dumbledore as he once had. Not when he knew exactly where the Elder Wand, Resurrection Stone, and Invisibility Cloak were in this timeline. Not when Dumbledore might ask.
Harry got to his feet in a daze. A Patronus. Yes. Yes, he needed to cast a Patronus. That would get the images out of his head. If he cast a Patronus, maybe he would be able to stop shaking.
They added two new Chasers— a huge adjustment to any team dynamic, he'd have to keep an eye on that development— and one Beater. Screamy McMindfuck was still going, making James snicker, until Regulus finally put an end to it by burning the bat to cinders and going for a new one.
They hadn't needed words for moments like this in months.
"You can't just say that about every Slytherin now!"
Sirius called a Marauders meeting in the bathroom of their dorm, since Harry Parker could walk into the dorm at any moment.
," Black continued mercilessly. "My training partners were Bellatrix, Andromeda, and Narcissa Black— now Malfoy. And let me tell you, my family didn't get the name Black because we teach our kids so much Light magic from a young age. Get it?"
"You and Lily?" Harry echoed, surprised. He could guess why James wouldn't want to antagonize Lily, but he'd never heard of Marlene McKinnon in relation to them.
He was saved from further awkwardness by the arrival of a small brown owl, which landed in front of Marlene and Gertrude as if it had been waiting for them. It stuck out its leg with a letter attached.
Severus flushed, and he looked away briefly before he collected himself. He said, so low Harry had to strain to hear, "I just wanted to say thank you. For that Protego Maxima. I saw that idiot's curse would have hit Evans. Expulso… it would have been terrible."
He had wished for Ron and Hermione to be by his side in this timeline almost constantly, but now he felt truly adrift without them. This was… this was what they
So, James was surprised when Sirius murmured, "It was a joke. It was a
"What."
"Don't talk about my friend like that, Potter!" said Lily hotly.
," and moved on.
And— Harry couldn't breathe. There was Remus Lupin, sitting next to the mousy haired, pointy-nosed Wormtail, tucking his book beneath the table with a shy, apologetic smile and… and he was
Still, Dumbledore waited, his gaze skewering Draco to his seat.
It probably wasn't even the first time.
Rage and disbelief sparked in Harry, but he bit his tongue and forced himself to hear Malfoy out.
"If you thought turning down your first offer of alliance would be a show of power," said the Greengrass girl, "that was a poor choice. Rosier and Wilkes— those prefects— are at the top of the hierarchy. They'll make you pay for that."
Harry had to stop himself from drawing his wand and hexing him in reflex. Then he turned to stare at his former nemesis.
So sorry for the delay! I had most of chapter 7 written when I posted chapter 6, but I was really unhappy with it. Instead of continuing on to finish it and write chapter 8, I decided to scrap 7 and start all over... three more times. So, basically, what I'm saying is that you've caught up with me now. I have not started chapter 8 yet. I'm planning to skip this Friday's update and try to get back on schedule starting next week. I just didn't want to make y'all wait any longer on this one. Please leave me comments and let me know what you think! I love hearing from you.
"James Potter, let go of Gingerweed right now!"
Harry was far more closed off than any of the Marauders, including even Remus himself, and getting to a peaceful acquaintanceship with him hadn't been easy.
Thanks as always to my wonderful beta-reader, Stoneage_Woman! And thank you all for reading! Expect updates alternating Fridays at this point, I think. I haven't started the next chapter yet, but 2 weeks sounds reasonable... right? Lol, let me know what you think of this one! I love hearing from you!
"Oh," she said. "I'm sorry."
"If you don't want wands, send the change along with your second," continued Draco coldly. "And, as you know the castle better than I do, as a new transfer, I
Potter looked at Dumbledore as if the headmaster had told a joke he didn't find particularly amusing.
He revealed his own transfigured hands, which were shaped as duck heads, complete with feathers, bills, and distractingly loud quacking.
"Next, we are very pleased to welcome back Professor Kettleburn from his sudden mid-term vacation last spring, and he asks that you please refrain from asking personal questions about the two fingers missing on his remaining arm."
He yearned to see Severus, even for a moment. To see him alive and unburdened by his role in the war…. It was a thought Draco had never even considered, that there had ever been such a time.
"You are, in fact, the actual worst. Even if you weren't famous for surviving the Killing Curse, you should have died at least a dozen times by now."
"Alright," said James, pulling the ends of the Cloak closer. "I think I've got a good idea of what Regulus's strategy is going to be. Let's go—"
They both straightened and stared hard out the window.
Finally, Snape said, "He is an odd sort, that much is clear. Still, I doubt he can win against Black. A no-name half-blood against the Ancient House of Bl—"
He could breathe, he reminded himself.
Harry shot out the door.
Antonin Dolohov had reminded Draco of his aunt Bellatrix, the few times they had all met. They were wrong in the head, and they took a truly perverse glee in mutilating others. But Aunt Bella had always seemed a bit frantic, while Dolohov was more easygoing. Aunt Bella, even while torturing the latest helpless Muggleborn to stumble into her lair, always wanted to be by the Dark Lord's side. She seemed to have a mental timetable always counting down, things to check off a list as quickly as possible before she could get back to groveling at
Grudgingly, the flame-snake moved to the center of Slytherin table, and Sirius split some of the candle flames from the mass to become a clutch of eggs, which the
"Get lost," said Harry, so quietly he doubted anyone could hear him, but the three nevertheless straightened indignantly, "or I will kill you where you stand."
Hermione wasn't there, even though it was the Hogwarts library, and why would
"Thank you," he said. "That's… that's really kind of you, Marlene. I appreciate it."
He didn't know how he would react to a stupid Quidditch game. He didn't know if he would be able to keep himself grounded, if he'd keep his head and remember it was just a game.
Black looked like he didn't know what to make of Draco, like he'd never seen anything like him before. Then he threw his head back and barked out a laugh. "You've got the language and the attitude of a pureblood," Black said, still chuckling, "but you have
"It could be a trap. You two wouldn't last five minutes without me."
And here it was. He could Apparate to Spinner's End at that very moment and find his teenage godfather, unmarked, unscarred,
— and he was
Malfoy stepped between Harry and the doors, forcing his attention on him.
"Knockturn Alley," said Malfoy.
After a couple of hours, Malfoy set down his book, stretched, and raked a hand through his chestnut hair.
They selected the books they had been working through lately and took their seats.
And—gibbering toadstools,
"I will agree to contact," said Flitwick magnanimously, "if you wish to send along your surrender— or apology."
Sirius kicked Harry under the table.
"I don't need a parent's permission," he said. "We're adults at seventeen in the wizarding world, remember?"
James let out a slow breath and bowed his head. "Hell," he said eloquently.
Sirius treated him to the same furrowed-brow sidelong look. "'Course you did. You cast Protego Horribilis. I didn't even know that one existed."
Once inside the infirmary, McKinnon safely under Madam Pomfrey's care, Dumbledore turned to the boys.
They could only keep up a constant barrage of spells, hexes, jinxes, and charms for so long before they simply got exhausted.
Or maybe Harry's subconscious had thought of Malfoy as Ron: familiar, a friend. And going to Quidditch tryouts with Ron was always a no-brainer.
It had been the night he had run away from home.
Through his blurry vision, a pair of scruffy men's uniform loafers appeared, alongside the dainty, gleaming pair of a girl's shoes.
"Mal— uh, Mallory and I weren't friends," he found himself saying, almost pleading. "Back at our school, I mean. We actually spent the last six years hating each other. His family and friends, and mine…. We had very different views on the world, you know?"
"Do you surrender?" asked Malfoy pleasantly.
. Some of us want to
Then, despite the visceral response to seeing them, the boy had hardly said two words since. He had sunk into the spot between James and Sirius and then picked at his food uninterestedly. Even though he was skin and bones and, beyond that, looked so exhausted he might have spent the day leading up to the feast
"I don't like fighting, Potter," said Malfoy at length, as if it cost him a great deal to admit. He didn't meet Harry's eyes. "Neither did my mother, actually. But, as I said, she did teach me to win. And when Black was casting those curses at me, all I could think about was Aunt Bella, and my mother watching in a panic, and I just knew I had to win at whatever the cost… and so I cast that spell. That's all. That's what happened."
Wormtail's turn.
"Right," said Harry, his mouth continuing where his brain stalled. "See you there."
"I know," said Draco, taking a bite of bacon. "But I couldn't let that stand. What he did was despicable. And I meant what I said about him not knowing
to a Death Eater and expect to get the truth! We have to lay a trap, probably dig through his stuff, and if you have any friends or relatives in the States you could write to—"
Any good humor in Malfoy vanished. He looked away, his expression drawn.
Sirius had barely said a word to James or his parents for days while he recovered.
The floor dropped out from under James's feet. He swayed, dizzy, like someone had hit him with a Confundus.
His applause was slower to start, scattered and confused.
Sirius's brow furrowed, and his eyes were solemn, penetrating, as he held James's gaze.
They'd fought for
Draco glanced away, frowning, and crossed his arms. He didn't know if he was annoyed at McKinnon or himself for that last thought.
The most he could do was get to know these people while he had the chance. He and Malfoy could figure out a way to return to their own time any day now, and then the Marauders and Lily would be gone forever. Again.
" said Harry again. His heart pounded violently against his ribcage, so hard he was afraid it would jump out. Blood rushed in his ears like a waterfall. "
, when Mulciber walked in, drawn by the shouting. Mulciber stopped dead, took in the scene, sniffed the air, and then abruptly howled in laughter.
Understanding flooded through Harry. He hesitated and then grabbed Malfoy's forearm and gave it a light squeeze, startling a swift, surprised glance from Malfoy before he again pretended nothing was happening.
Then the images shifted. He saw Hermione falling under Dolohov's purple curse, that look of surprise still etched on her face.
"Usually, he'll try asking her out for the whole weekend first," Remus told Harry matter-of-factly. "Then when she turns him down, he'll try wheedling her out for one drink at the Broomsticks."
"No," said Draco, and the word was bitter on his tongue. "It hasn't escaped their notice that… well, my ideals don't align with theirs."
"Hey," said Sirius, jutting his chin toward the Slytherin table. "What's your friend talking to Regulus about?"
some information from the seventh-year curriculum I've found worthwhile. If you study the text on your own time, you just might do well enough for your father to hand you a job on a silver platter, like you've always expected. Anyone else?"
" cried Lily, blasting a stream of fire at the Inferius' chest.
"Why, you little scumbag," said Rodolphus, taking a few threatening steps forward and raising his wand. "Do you know who it is you're talking to?"
Harry eyed him and the Snitch warily. He knew James and Sirius were upset over how he'd helped Malfoy win the duel against Sirius. They hadn't exactly been shy with their grumbling the night before. Harry had heard a number of mutterings on the themes of traitors and shame and disappointment.
. He had been giving Draco the cold shoulder ever since Harry and Draco had almost died laughing over his offer to join the Dark Lord.
Harry and Hermione kept watch from an abandoned storefront just across the street from Everest Wands' backdoor.
"Get your delectable ass down here and find out!" Black called back, wise enough not to announce their intentions to duel where the professors could hear.
"—randomly shouts out your darkest secrets, threatens to kill you in the way you fear most, and then sobs hysterically until you cuddle it?" said James, stroking his chin pensively. "Yeah, mate, good choice. Quidditch can be a high-stress sport. We don't want anyone who cracks under pressure."
