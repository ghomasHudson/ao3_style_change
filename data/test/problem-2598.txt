Malfoy turned to look at him and his eyes narrowed at the sight of Harry's probably not-very-pleasant smile.
"What kind of ridiculous safe house doesn't have an escape route?"
"What? It wouldn't be the first time. I can see the  headlines now: 'Secret Ministry Romance! From Supply Cupboards to Sneaky Elopement!' Wouldn't that be something?"
"See you tomorrow, Potter," Malfoy purred.  Harry fled.
"Blimey, didn't see that Bludger. Sorry, mate, it was just a thought."
Draco was seated on the edge of the bed and he had already removed his shirt and boots. Harry obligingly got up and stood before him, knowing the opportunity for argument had passed. Draco pulled Harry down onto the bed and a moment later, Harry's shirt was torn open.
Harry smiled in contentment and drifted off to sleep.
" Harry asked in a stage whisper.
"I don't think the spell was the problem. I just think we need more power." He glanced over his shoulder, fixing his argent eyes on Harry. "That's where you come in."
"Oh, stop. You are making me blush. If you don't mind silencing this racket, I would like to speak to Kingsley Shacklebolt, at once."
Harry hurried after him and caught him by the shoulder, spinning him around. He faced the angry silver stare. "It's not possible. You would not have passed the final exam. It's a
And then Malfoy’s hands were back, spreading him wide once more and his wicked voice asked, “Want me to tongue-fuck you, Potter?”
yanked away his wand and then the attackers bound him with magical ropes. Parkinson roused as they did so and she was given the same treatment.
Hermione stumbled out of the grove and back to the fire where Ron had just finished tossing another lump of wood into the coals. A red spray of cinders shot up, illuminating Ron's face when he looked at her in sudden concern. He sprang forward and grabbed her arms.
"We're meeting under my terms, not yours. You've been chummy with Potter recently. Why?"
"How was the Quidditch thing last night?"
Draco banished some unidentifiable debris from a nearby chair seat and Scourgified it before dragging it closer and sitting down across from Finnigan. "I am afraid that I lied to you, Finnigan. I don't need to talk.
"Wait, Ron! Just wait!"
"Hufflepuff." Draco snorted. Potter guffawed. Draco thought Potter looked terribly cute when he gazed at Draco with such adoration.
"Are you completely barmy?" Harry yelled. "What if that had killed her? Hell, what if a Muggle had seen you? What if—?"
"Are you going to marry her?" Harry asked and then made a stern mental note to bring some Ton-Tongue Toffee next time he planned to be near Malfoy so that he couldn't speak.
Harry scowled at his back, shook his head, and went out.
"Join the club," Harry muttered. "You, um… look great."
"Oh, you know what it meant."
"No. You will not."
Tonks and Remus heard them enter and hurried into the entry hall to greet them. Tonks gave Harry an exuberant hug and then did the same to Draco, causing Ron and Hermione to blink in surprise.
Hermione tried.  She should have known better this late in the game, but still she tried.  Harry would have been grateful if it had been anyone but Malfoy she battled.  Harry knew perfectly well that words were useless.
"I don't much care. If you can stay the night, maybe we can do both? I want to do everything. Everything I can."
"Game over," Malfoy said smugly. He lowered his wand and smiled brilliantly. "See you tonight,
Potter tasted of brandy and chocolate and something uniquely different—
"Well, hopefully the task you set her to will take a few months," Harry said with a resigned sigh. He knew by now that Draco could be evasive for weeks, if necessary.
Malfoy pulled nearly out and rammed forward, hitting that exquisite spot once more.  “Come for me,” he said at the same time and Harry
Draco pulled Potter tightly against him and whispered the spell into the Chosen One's hair, feeling the softness of it against his lips and drinking in the clean scent.
despite my protests otherwise. I admit it was hard to protest too loudly when he was being so charming, and that mischievous twinkle in his eyes was a surprise. If I hadn't known he'd been taking the piss all evening I might have been taken in. Merlin, I suppose I was taken in, to be perfectly honest. He's bloody gorgeous and it was something of an ego boost to have him pretending to be my date. Once or twice I may have imagined myself kissing him, but I can't go down that road. It can only lead to pain, so I have to smash such ridiculous thoughts before they start. It's nice that we're getting on, at any rate.
"That is what they will say, yes."
"Auror Klein knew the risks when she signed up for this job," Shacklebolt said in a firm tone and Draco blinked at him in surprise. He'd expected Shacklebolt to be a hardcase, but never to the point of allowing one of his Aurors to die.
Potter looked confused for only a moment, until he caught up to Draco's train of thought.
"Yes. How about 'Draco doesn't like you and refuses to go.'" Draco chuckled at Potter's not-amused face. "Fine. Just tell her you are very busy with International Quidditch things. Meeting with someone to go over regulations, blah blah, very boring, regretfully decline, etcetera."
"Erm… my house," he admitted.
"We're closed," Fred said automatically. Ron was in no mood for his brothers' games.
"That's all I know! I swear it! Eddie, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."
"Before he gets to one of your 'trusted' people and carves them open for information?" Another spike of anxiety pierced Draco's midsection. "Does Potter know about this?"
Malfoy said nothing to that and Harry plucked petals until he held another barren stem. He dropped it. "Your glass is empty," Malfoy commented finally.
"The Seabreeze Club. Johnston and his friends left the club and were walking to another pub up the street when Johnston collapsed."
Tim sighed heavily. "I suppose I should get home and listen to my stepfather tell my mother what a terrible job she did raising me. It's a tradition, you know. Thanks for the drinks, Draco. Mrs Malfoy. 'Night, Harry."
Harry crouched next to Malfoy's still form and turned him over carefully, wary of a possible spinal injury. The chunk of debris had hit Malfoy on the lower back. Harry winced when he saw Malfoy's face; it was badly scraped from contact with the ground, and rapidly swelling. Blood trickled from one nostril. He was limp in Harry's arms.
"How what?" Pansy asked, but Potter knew precisely what Draco meant.
Harry sighed in frustration, knowing he was beaten. "All right. I'll see you by the end of the week. Be careful," he added quietly.
Harry hopped off his broom in front of Malfoy Manor and stared in amazement. The façade of the mansion was nearly complete. The colonnades were gleaming white and the curving marble steps led to the stately, finished portico.
ooOoo
Pansy laughed at Draco with her best blank expression. Luckily, she was quite good at masking her emotions. Potter sighed, probably sensing he would get nothing from her. He turned back to Draco with a quick shuffle that put him a couple of steps away—back to the safety zone of dead air.
Teddy, instantly distracted, bolted ahead and scared up a small flock of birds that had unwisely landed near the path. Teddy roared and jumped at them and they took off with a loud flapping of wings. A feather floated to the ground and Teddy pounced on it. "Is this a peacock feather, Uncle Harry?'
Potter redid the lube charm and then used one hand to line up his cock whilst the other held tightly to Draco's hip, holding him in place as he opened Draco up for the first time in far too long. Draco groaned and clenched his hands into the covers, wishing he'd thought to move closer to the headboard for leverage.
A ghost of a smile curved the corner of Malfoy’s lips. “You are the most interesting thing that’s happened to me all day, although I have to admit that isn’t saying much.”
Malfoy's stare was penetrating. "I always did that with Crabbe and Goyle."
A modern wizarding dance tune thudded a jazzy beat into the air and a single, tenacious couple gyrated in front of the jukebox, all groping hands and slow kisses. They had been at it for hours and the witch had lost her shoes sometime previous.
Footsteps approached and Harry looked up to see Tim Clark approaching, still clad in his Auror robes. His face was streaked with dust and his brow was furrowed. He sprawled into the chair next to Harry.
Harry chuckled. "I doubt I will escape his wrath. We share an office, after all. He will tell me I should have stopped you."
There was a loud clink and Harry looked over to see Agatha staring at him through her distorting lenses. He fixed a reassuring smile on his face and she smiled back before returning to her task. Harry turned back to Malfoy with a tense frown. Malfoy nodded.
"Maybe you two should go back to your room?" Hermione suggested dryly.
"I won't talk to anyone but you. I will see you tomorrow. And keep a close eye on Eddie, won't you?"
The two of them got to their feet, linked hands, and strode through the crowd. Whispers surrounded them, but Harry didn't care. For the first time in his life, he felt like a hero.
They carried the pizza back to the flat and sat on the floor, eating the cheese-laden crust while working on Draco's latest puzzle. Thanks to Draco, Harry had developed an actual appreciation for wine. A full-bodied red tasted amazing with the pizza, and they had consumed an entire bottle before Harry knew it. His stomach was pleasantly full and the tipsy feeling was nice.
He kissed Draco lingeringly to emphasize his words and Draco sighed again.
"Goodnight, Draco."
"I'm sorry, dear, there is no word on the boy yet, but a message came for you." She handed him a tiny sealed envelope. He tore it open and found a message scrawled in a neat script.
He returned with the glass and regained his position as Draco took another drink. "Tell me," he said.
.  The very thought of it caused heat to slither through his veins and pool in his midsection.  After the twenty he had taken a few days ago, ten seemed like nothing.
"Your Christmas gift."
"I can send someone to take care of that for you," he offered.
"Did you pay someone to kill him?"
Harry looked at Agatha, happily emptying bottles for Malfoy's potion racket, and felt a peculiar twist in his heart. Sometimes it was hard to remember that Malfoy was a git.
It showed possibly too much of his dark-haired happy trail, but the outline of his cock was very nice, and the light from the window fell straight across the centre of his cock, highlighting the middle portion with unusual visual interest. The angle was unfortunate--if he'd been able to, he would have turned the camera a bit more to the right, because the entire thing was centred, breaking the first rule.
The note of challenge in her voice spurred him to lie back, resting his head on his crossed forearms. He scanned the sky. "There," he said and pointed, "a giraffe." To his surprise, the silly practice was rather relaxing.
"Maybe his Animagus form was a fire crab," Brady suggested. "I once knew a Dane whose Animagus form was a sea slug." He laughed at their expressions of disbelief. "Yeah, he rarely transformed and was nigh unto useless when he did. The Danish magical scholars loved to study him, trying to find a correlation between personality and Animagus forms. He was rather slug-like."
Harry took the path and walked into a garden filled with roses of every colour and fragrance. He was nearly sidetracked by the urge to smell each one, but stopped only once to inhale the scent of a deep red version with blooms as big as dinner plates.
, Draco thought uncharitably), the least he could do would be to pry some details from Potter. Perhaps the Ministry was being overzealous and Mark was not the primary player in whatever crimes were being committed.
"Your house-elf won't be coming. I sent him on an errand. A well-paid errand, I assure you." He smirked at that. In support of Granger's pet house-elf freedom bill, the entire Ministry had been forced to free their house-elves. The poor confused things had no idea whom to obey and were easy targets for suggestion. It had made home invasion so much easier for Draco. "Ah ah ah! Stay right there. There is no need for you to trouble yourself by getting out of bed. We can chat right here." Draco had pulled up a chair before awakening Quartermain and he didn't bother to uncross his legs as he lifted his wand.
"Harry," Draco said and came all over his abdomen.
Malfoy drank deeply and Harry felt a twinge of sympathy. He had never considered how terrible it must have been, to have Voldemort and his minions living in his house. The very idea that they would have used him for their pleasure… Harry lifted his glass and took a bracing gulp.
"Sort of," Draco said and reached out to take it from Harry. The item was attractive, fashioned of multiple strands of leather in dark brown and green, with small silver rings dangling from the laces. He lifted his hand to take it back, but Draco held it out of reach. "It's an ankle bracelet."
. Without a word. I suppose it would explain why I hadn't seen him in a couple of days (although it doesn't explain his weird note on Wednesday) and okay, I admit I'm pretty pissed off that he didn't even mention it to me. I thought we were friends! Don't friends tell each other things? I'm torn between wanting to throw things and grab Malfoy and... well, kiss him, for one thing, but he has this façade of bored nonchalance right now that I don't know how to penetrate. I'm so bloody confused. Oh yeah, and we had Hermione's party tonight because otherwise she wouldn't be surprised (even though she probably wasn't surprised anyway) and I should have been paying attention to her but instead I was preoccupied with Malfoy all night. Should I have invited him to the party? Someone needs to invent a spell that helps people figure out what to do with their lives because mine is fucked up.
"Harry, why are you staring at Malfoy? Did he do something? You look like you want to kill him." Luna's voice was mild, as it always was, and Harry forced himself to look away from his tormentor. Luna had taken to sitting with various friends during meals instead of sticking with the Ravenclaws, a habit that had been mirrored by many others. Harry sometimes thought about sitting with the Slytherins...
Mindy nodded. "I recognised him right off. Such a handsome man." She sighed dreamily.
sure," Parkinson said with a snort. "He caught me naked in his tub and fled like a pack of werewolves was on his tail."
"Um, and the instructor's name is?" Harry asked.
He sat up with a frown. Why hadn't Potter fought back? What if he had wanted Draco to kiss him? What if he really had sent in the photograph to be critiqued? The thought made him pause. What if...?
, if we do that. I don't want to snatch at happiness now only for it to turn to dust later. I don't want to cause trouble with her family, so if I have to save enough to buy her a fucking castle in order to please her father, then so be it." Finnigan had a mad light in his eyes and he seemed to catch himself leaning forwards, half-shouting at Draco. He straightened and looked away.
"You know, I've been thinking about that. We know it's safe to Apparate
Draco laughed.
Wednesday, 19.5.2004
cared enough to keep him alive, and not merely for political reasons.
"My name is Harry. Don't be frightened. I'm an Auror. I'm here to take you to your father."
," she said in a tone that spoke volumes. She waved Harry off. "I'll do it."
Feeling extremely self-conscious, Harry sat down on the bed, trying to look casual, and most likely failing miserably. Luckily, Malfoy was already immersed in the article and paid Harry little mind.
Rosier's expression was plainly disbelieving. "You honestly think you can play Harry Potter?"
"Hey! What you doin'? You know it's four in the mornin'?"
“Want me to fuck you, Potter?” Draco asked huskily.
"How is the duck?" he asked, forcing small talk in order to distract himself from his pending insanity.
"Well now, that's where you two come in. You see, they built a sort of fail-safe device to this spell. In case someone released it by accident, I suppose. Or more likely to appease some do-gooder philanthropist during its creation. Regardless, the bloody thing can be stopped by a
When he was gone, Malfoy sampled his dish, made a sound of approval, and then continued his tale. "As I said, Violetta spoiled me terribly. Looking back, I'm not certain if she merely thought I was an adorable child, or if she had some issues with paedophilia." He chuckled at Harry's expression. "Fear not, she never behaved inappropriately. I was six years old and when we returned home I drew pictures of her and missed her dreadfully. Until I met Jacques. How is the cod?"
"And now?"
Draco was torn between consternation at Harry's lack of trust and a swell of pride that Harry could see through nearly all of Draco's machinations. He made a mental note to concoct a story worthy of Scheherazade and her thousand-and-one-nights. In fact, he might have to draw it out just that long, in order to guarantee himself a place in Harry's bed for that many evenings in a row. He gave Harry a speculative look.
"I meant every word," Harry said, taking another step and turning into the aggressor once more. It had served him well last time as a means of deflating Draco's well-deserved anger. "I am sorry for lying to you, by the way, but I'm not sorry for getting to know you as Mark, without our past history to cloud your judgment. It was a rare opportunity to discover how lovely you are beneath all of the… thorns."
“Go on, I’ll try to get there on time, but no sense both of us being late if I don’t make it.”
Potter wrestled him over with a movement that Draco would have paid to learn. Potter straddled his hips, but Draco had not lost his grip on Potter's cock. He twisted his hand and squeezed. Potter hissed.
"Well, there is now. We are all here to learn, not to criticise." He glanced over and found Potter staring at him as though he'd turned into something baffling. Before he was tempted to analyse it, Draco turned back to the photos. "Now, then. As you can see, the focus on this first photo is on this part of the broom handle..."
"Improving." Harry paused and then blurted, "How do you feel about Eddie? Do you think he's good for me? Do you sense anything… off about him? Or anything?" He didn't really know how to put it into words.
He shook his head, knowing full well that he wouldn't be indulging in any of that nonsense with any of his students. He had sworn off romance completely and had no desire to indulge in even casual sex. He had two perfectly capable hands with which to bring himself off when the occasion warranted. Sex simply led to emotional entanglement and heartbreak, and similar foolishness. He wanted no part of it.
"I am not cynical. I am a realist. And yes, Blaise, please set up the bunting. Salazar knows this place could use some softer colours, although the lavender is going to clash horribly with this green. Perhaps we can remove this painting entirely? Or cover it with fabric? Possibly a banner announcing the purpose of this grand gathering?"
. I am not marrying Astoria."
“Nothing too strenuous.  A mere ten lashes should be enough, don’t you think?”  Malfoy’s voice was smooth as silk and his nearness did strange things to Harry’s libido.
He was near enough that Harry could see the marvellous colour of his lashes—pale near the lids and darkening to gold at the tips—and smell the smooth bite of his cologne. This time it made Harry think of mountain lakes. He wanted to lean closer and breathe it in. Something about Malfoy's scent was strangely calming, or perhaps it was Malfoy himself who was beginning to have that effect on him. It was a dangerous thought; even so, Harry did not pull away.
"I passed several of those. And I was concentrating on following Hedwig. Didn't notice."
~~~~*~~~~
It seemed to understand Draco, because it stopped fighting to free itself. Draco loosened his grip slightly, not trusting its placidity. "I named you Harry, by the way, because you seem to be fairly stupid. I'm glad to see you were properly named."
That wasn't fair. Godric, I'm edgy right now. I think I'll go for a walk. Feels like ants are crawling on my skin.
THE END! :D
"Oh god," Harry said. He looked up and met Draco's eyes. "Draco, I…"
"Does this vampire thing cause you to behave irrationally? Not that you were ever particularly rational, that is."
jilted a Malfoy.
"Draco, language!" She picked up her wineglass. "Still, you are right. He's quite boorish. No wonder his wife left him for that half-blood parchment salesman. What was his name?" She took a drink and drifted off into her own thoughts again, successfully shoved away from worrying about Draco by the usual mention of business. Although Draco had to admit that her knowledge of gossip had come in handy more than once when it came to business dealings.
The Slytherins walked into the decorated portion of the hall gingerly, their eyes scanning for signs of vandalism, wands out. The scene looked placid, just as lovely as it had the previous night.
Harry Potter's wand!" The wardrobe door shot open and Potter's wand shot out from its hiding place inside the pocket of a black cape. Obviously, Rosier hadn't decided what to do with it even up to the point of putting the damned thing under lock and key. It was sad how the mighty had fallen. Draco's final bit of business was to cast a Locator Charm and attune it with a long range.
"Don't act like I'm taking you to the gallows. The food will be worth a little wardrobe discomfort, I promise you. Now, put on these trousers and we'll see if everything fits."
Malfoy came into my office this morning and apologised for being an arse. He even brought me a treacle pastry and a cup of tea. I suspect he's up to something, but he left before I could call him out. Okay, weird, Malfoy's owl just showed up with a note asking me to lunch on Friday. I can't believe I'm waffling on this. I should say no and let things get back to how they were, but I actually miss spending time with him. I wish we'd never gone to that stupid party.
"I moved most of my father's collection up here," Draco said. "Make yourselves comfortable, Weasleys. I'll get us some tea." His voice was gracious enough, but for a slight stressing of the name.
When the books were stacked in assorted piles on the floor, Harry dusted and polished the wooden bookshelf, and then began to place the books inside. He lifted a large, leather-bound volume emblazoned with
I got home on Saturday morning, locked down my Floo, and slept all weekend. I don't want to see anyone. I used the last of my Dreamless Sleep and I need to convince myself that I don't need more. I have the final list of names from Dubai and Malfoy is definitely one of them. I can only cling to the hope that it refers to Lucius and not Draco.
The teasing tone penetrated Harry's shock at having blasted a hole in the wall. He turned his head and felt Draco's lips slide over his jaw. Somehow Harry twisted around, although he later had no memory of moving at all, and then his lips were on Draco's. Draco did not stiffen in shock, as Harry had half-expected, and there was no pulling away. Instead he made a needy sound and opened his mouth, as if all the spell-casting had been foreplay and Harry's response was exactly what he had been waiting for.
"But this place is under a Fidelius Charm."
"Then block your Floo. Too late now, anyway. I need something."
wand. It was doubtful he would be foolish enough to attempt to use that one, however.
Draco frowned. "Not even an angry slap or two?"
"Yeah, but I think we'll need to start somewhere. If we find out Malfoy's right about Greyback, we'll need to move quickly on this."
another reason I wouldn't mind them leaving," Harry admitted, earning a seductive grin from Draco.
"Wednesday," Pansy said.
Alarm bells began to clang in Harry's brain. Whenever Draco was agreeable, it meant trouble. "I'm going outside to see what time it is. And I should send a Patronus message to Hermione, too."
Remus and Tonks kept them entertained throughout the meal with tales of their time on the Continent, which thankfully kept Draco and the Weasleys from verbally drawing blood.
Harry heard a whisper of sound and then something soft dropped onto the small of his back.  Godric, it was Malfoy’s other glove.  The thought barely registered before Harry felt Malfoy’s bare hand questing over his buttocks, squeezing the welts and drawing another pained gasp from him even as his cock twitched in Malfoy’s gloved fist.
Harry scowled, but he supposed Malfoy was correct. "It's a modified Imperius with a hint of Legilimency and a Stinging Hex thrown in. It's astonishingly clever, really."
"You'd help me?" Harry had less restraint than Draco, obviously, because his fingers skirted the edge of Draco's jaw and drew circular patterns near his ear. It was damned diverting.
Draco walked to the ottoman and sat down, as before.  He crooked his index finger at Potter, as before, and smirked slightly when he moved forward woodenly.  No erection yet, Draco noted absently.  He wondered how long that would last.
"I love this shirt. Take it off."
"I'll get you some blankets," Harry said and escaped the kitchen to locate some linens. That had gone easier than expected. He breathed a sigh of relief.
"That's the one. I'm hoping to find someone to cover for me. I sort of promised to take Hermione out that night weeks ago. I know she'll forgive me if I have to reschedule, but…"
She snickered. "You know, there isn't a man alive that doesn't make that exact same face when I mention that hex."
"You were definitely no slouch in the magic department." Even at the time, Harry had been impressed by Draco's ability to repair the Vanishing Cabinet. If he had been pressured to do the same at that age, he doubted he'd have managed it. Not without Hermione's help. And Draco had been without Harry's support system. Crabbe and Goyle had to have been pretty useless.
Draco, of course, had no intention of staying, especially if Crabbe was coming for him. He felt like a rat in a cage trapped in the bloody Ministry "safe house" when he knew he'd be safer with the ability to put thousands of kilometres between himself and Crabbe, at least until whatever had driven him to seek out Draco had been determined. Not for the first time, Draco cursed himself for allowing them to lure him into such a simple trap.
Harry scowled. "No. Yes." He sighed. "I suppose it depends."
"Only a
He held Harry into his arms and and rested his chin on Harry's dark head. "Please live, Harry," he whispered. "Please."
Brady flew up and saw him struggling not to drop Malfoy, but he made no move to assist.
Harry couldn't breathe for a moment. Draco laughed throatily.
have had success. With Potter, it was a given. Draco snorted.
and that having a high enough social status will make up for that." He stressed the words in a fair mockery of Draco being dramatic.
“No, thank you.” Draco couldn’t help the way his voice and body went rigid.
“And I am a Death Eater.” Draco took a long drag from his vice before vanishing it.
Draco had had little time to even bother thinking about coming out to his parents, though he knew what their reactions would be down to the hand gestures. His father would yell about carrying on the Malfoy name and call him a faggot. His mother would smile and pet his hair, telling him it was normal to go through these types of phases as a teen. Draco knew it wasn't a phase as much as he knew that his name was Malfoy.
I- uh- well, I got you a gift. It’s not anything much. You don’t have to open it if you don’t want to.” Harry held a small wrapped package he had pulled out from beneath his bed.
“I think I’ll stay here, the Weasleys invited me of course but I don’t know, without Fred it seems so wrong and Ginny will be there.”  Harry looked empty for a moment before shrugging. Draco was reminded forcefully that the Weasleys were missing a son and his heart ached for the people he was raised to hate.
“The- the one at the end of the hall.” Draco hiccupped and gasped and Harry just nodded and carried him towards a bed.
Eventually, the bathroom door slid open and Draco looked up at Harry’s green eyes.
Draco began to bob his head, pleased to hear the hitch, moan, and curse on Harry’s breath as he did so. Harry’s fingers dug into Draco’s scalp and just when Draco placed his hand on Harry’s balls, Harry screamed.
They had sent Draco Malfoy his letter of invitation to Hogwarts to receive his N.E.W.T.s a month before school started.
“Probably, yes. I erm- it just helps a bit.” Draco hated the croak in his voice and glanced down at his tangled bed sheets.
Draco opened his eyes, not remembering closing them in the first place, and turned to see Harry standing at Draco’s back in a protective position.
-------
Draco nodded in and out of sleep until his stomach’s grumbling woke him. He cast a Tempus only to see it was 5:00 pm and everyone would be at dinner. His aversion to The Great Hall had only been growing as he thought of all the faces of hatred and the boils across his body from hexes cast by them. He knew he could call for a house-elf to bring him something to eat, they often did this for sick students, but he couldn’t bring himself to take advantage of a house-elf’s generosity.
That's when an idea graced him like a light from heaven.
“I forgive you for the past you know, you were just a kid.” Harry's voice had said it but Draco was certain it wasn’t him who spoke it.
“Are you planning on actually leaving this room anytime soon?” Harry spoke so directly to Draco that he felt rather ambushed, taking a step back in surprise.
“No.” The word had passed Draco’s lips in a curl of smoke before he could even think to stop himself.
Draco’s luck seemed to have no plan of changing though because when he entered his room there was Potter with his back turned to the door. Harry Potter skipping lunch was unheard of and quite annoying. Draco sighed audibly and Potter shuffled, turning to him.
Harry pulled away to open his bedside drawer and Draco longed desperately for him to hold him, screw the potion.
Draco ate and eventually was unnerved by the silence, usually Harry would ask how his day was or need help on one of their recent assignments. Draco glanced over to Harry’s bed and was startled. Harry was sat cross-legged with tears cascading down his cheeks, and not a single emotion displayed on his face.
After scrubbing himself clean of the treacherous day he had suffered, he turned off the shower and grabbed his toothbrush.
Draco knew he was loud during sex, but it never ceased to surprise him what noises came out of him.
He slept well that night.
Draco stood in front of Harry, who slowly unbuttoned his shirt. Harry’s eyes were piercing Draco’s soul with the directness of his stare. Harry’s shirt came down and rested at the crooks of his suntanned elbows. Harry offered a crooked smile as Draco took in the wonderful body in front of him.
“I try,” Draco whispered as he crawled up and planted a kiss on Harry’s lips before laying down next to him.
“Why not? Here, I’ll do it.”
“You have done plenty of foolish things but this, this is where you are allowed to be foolish. You are allowed to feel things whether or not they make sense. You’ve seen enough harm done to take your time and mourn.” Draco didn’t recognize the words coming out of his mouth.
Draco’s pride screamed as Harry slid a supportive arm along his back, but he felt the exhaustion set into his bones, quieting any objection he could have managed.
“The en suite bathroom, Malfoy?” Harry’s smile was crooked as he chuckled at the weak rebuttal.
---------
“Thank you, Mr. Draco, thank you!” Tilly wrapped her frail arms around Draco’s knees and then left with a pop.
“Okay, Draco, okay.” Harry’s eyes met Draco’s and Draco broke. Draco broke naked, in front of Harry Potter, in a bathtub.
When Harry apparated to Malfoy manor he shivered, but that shiver had nothing to do with the spell nor the weather. The gates were open and without protective spells, leading him through their open arms and to the front door, also left open. Harry’s sense of foreboding tingled as he drew his wand and crept inside. The house was quiet save for the whistling of the wind.
Draco still ate in his room and in classes he always sat next to Harry, but it was an improvement.
“Alright, alright. Let’s go.” Harry had slid into a comfortable smile that reeked with the sense that he had gotten what he wanted.
"New leaf," Draco spoke, eyes kept distinctly on his shoes, ones that had been expertly shined earlier that day. He thought the password was cheesy and stupid, but had no one to speak that opinion to, and was sure no one cared to listen. Dumbledore nodded and his painting swung to reveal a common room.
Classes were shit. No one sat near Draco, giving him a wide berth and plenty of room to remind him of his past actions. He was bored with the droning teachers and tired of sitting ramrod straight as to not irritate the hexed skin of his body. At lunch break, he retired back to the room he shared with his nemesis. He would do any homework sent his way. He was in no mood to be around others and their opinions of him, so the decision to alienate himself came with ease.
Now, without the company of his roommate, he felt rather lonely. He loved his friends but with their relationship now completely official he felt himself taking a step back, seeing them together made him happy in the most unfortunate way.
“Are you hungry?”
Harry’s eyes glinted with a mischievous nature that made Draco’s heart thrum, and Draco couldn’t stop himself. Draco craned his neck slightly and brought his lips to meet Harry’s. Harry’s lips were warm and soft, just how Draco had imagined. Draco took in Harry’s aroma of pine and mint and felt much more intoxicated from Harry than he had felt from the butterbeer.
“You were a Death Eater, now you’re just a survivor like the rest of us.”
“You’re amazing.” Harry panted, gazing unseeingly at Draco.
“Hey, hey, let me help.” Harry’s voice was in his ear and he felt himself shiver under the breath.
“Okay, do you know what helps you?” Harry breathed.
Harry spotted watery boot prints that lead in a straight line towards the back of the house. As Harry followed the trail, he wondered if he could convince Draco to stay his Christmas at Hogwarts, away from this cursed house. Harry was met with another open door and a trampled grass trail that he followed with a quickening pace, the cold making him shiver.
"'Deed it would! The boys down at the pub would be—" Toby's face fell. "Well, they'll never believe me, will they?"
. He wasn't ready to hear it, especially not in the context of an irritated tirade, and definitely not whilst covering ground they had already been over time and again. Harry was tired of being painted the bad guy while Eddie was the long-suffering paragon of virtue.
Draco glanced up warily when Crabbe's people returned. A small group of ragtag Aurors accompanied them, one of them lying prone and following by way of levitation. Draco blanched when he recognised Auror Klein, the one Potter called Kay-Kay. She walked unsteadily and one side of her face looked like a sheet of blood. Draco wondered where Finnigan was; they were usually found together.
Harry rolled his eyes and pulled out the card. A sad-looking puppy on the front rolled over and looked pathetic, paws curled and belly exposed. Harry sighed. Eddie had always been a fan of the sappier greeting cards. He opened it up to read
"Too bad. I'm betting I can get Eddie begging for his life before you tell me how to find Malfoy. You seem the stubborn sort, so I'm sure it will take us a while." Rosier lifted his wand.
.  Merlin, they were only halfway through.
"I want to go to the hotel. Our hotel."
All at once, he channeled the energy from
~~~~*~~~~
their marriage was in trouble before Malfoy. And now Harry. How had the bastard done it? Harry was straight, for fuck's sake! He'd been engaged to Ginny! They had snogged like love-starved beasts so often during the Horcrux searches that Ron and Hermione had threatened to douse them with ice water more than once. Hell, Harry and Ginny had probably even had se—Ron's mind abruptly shied away from that implication, but the image of Harry with
Draco showed his teeth at Roderick, who gave him a glare and flounced across the room, pushing himself into the group that surrounded Potter. Draco drained his champagne glass and went looking for another. It was going to be a long night.
"Gryffindors are supposed to be brave."
Harry chuckled throatily. "Stop that."
Harry woke in Draco's arms and realized it was definitely an experience he wanted to repeat at least a thousand more times in the future. He never would have guessed Draco to be a snuggler, but it had been a very pleasant surprise. His warm body was pressed along the length of Harry's back and their legs were intertwined. Draco's arm hugged Harry close and his fingertips rested against Harry's collarbone.
, you do…whatever it is you plan to do before Harry gets here." She exited with Weasley trailing after.
"I don't know where he is," Harry said truthfully.
"As you can hear, we don't have time, so I suggest you utilise what tiny bits of brain tissue you carry around in that cranium of yours to find us a way out this death trap."
Harry bit his lip. It seemed wrong, somehow, to let Draco sleep with shoes on. Bad enough he was sprawled over his bed and would likely awaken stiff and chilled in the morning. But to sleep with shoes on… Harry grimaced. Ever since his days of Horcrux hunting and being forced to sleep fully clothed, shod, and ready to run, he had hated to sleep in anything more constricting than pants. Even socks left him feeling stifled. Feeling magnanimous, Harry sighed and walked around the bed to carefully ease the shoes from Draco's feet, thankful that they were wizard-style ankle boots with no laces. It took a few more minutes of gnawing his lip with indecision before he reached beneath the trouser legs and tugged off Draco's socks, as well.
She huffed a stray hair out of her face and then sat back on her haunches. The bit of paper dangled from the wall. "I've always hated this wallpaper. I thought I'd take the time whilst Ron's away to rip it out. Of course, it's more difficult than expected. Too much force on the Scraping Charm and it gouges a hole in the wall. Too little and it leaves bits of paper."
"Then why aren't you in here yet?"
Confused, Harry dropped the garment and picked up the card. It read:
Harry's thoughts were sluggish. He was having a hard time processing Draco's words with the languid heat that began to steal through him from the touch of Draco's thumb on his lip as it caressed one direction and then the other.
"Nothing. I'm just… damn, I'm good, aren't I?"
“Coming, Potter?” Malfoy snarled. “We must get rid of this odious spell as quickly as possible, mustn’t we?”
Astoria Greengrass and thought that might land me in Azkaban. You were the next best thing," Harry admitted, suddenly finding his tongue again.
Draco shook his head. "I don't think you're ready for that. Is this your first time with a man?"
"I went to Pansy, of course, and Blaise. Once I could function again, I learned. I soaked up information like a starving man sops up gravy. I found out everything I could about everyone I thought might be even vaguely guilty of destroying my life. I learned their habits, their methods, their preferences, and their weaknesses. I knew their friends, their loved ones, their mistresses, and their enemies. I learned to remember everything. Names, faces, connections, patterns. I could meet a man and instantly recall his wife, his in-laws, his cousins, his uncles and step-cousins and aunties twice removed. I knew his business and his bank balance, and all of the wicked little habits he tried to hide away from the world. I became an information broker, of sorts, trading knowledge for power. And then I went hunting."
"When it involves you? Yes." He unbuckled Draco's belt and slid a hand into his pants. Draco drew in a sharp breath.
She shook her head as if bemused. "I never would have suspected Malfoy of being gay."
"Stupid bird," Draco muttered.
Andrew appeared again and cleared away their dishes before producing a visual display of the various desserts. The chocolate mousse looked delicious, but Harry had to try the treacle tart, despite his need to counter Malfoy's expectations. Malfoy ordered a pear tart with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.
“Cigarettes and calming draught.” Draco choked out when he realized his cigarettes were in his pocket in the pair of pants he had shed by the pool.
Draco closed his eyes and leaned his head back until he felt Harry’s presence sit down beside him. He watched as Harry gingerly handled Draco’s wounds, wrapping and cleaning each one. The scar tissue of the area would make a healing spell useless, and Draco knew that. Harry plucked the cigarette from between Draco’s lips and vanished it, and then he curled so that he was holding Draco.
Draco blinked sleepily.
As Draco rolled his luggage behind him, he rested in the sound of the clunk that the wheels made when meeting the cobblestone path up to what was supposedly the "eighth-year" dorms.
“Says the human furnace!” Draco shot back with a glare.
“It was the right thing to do, and heaven knows I’ve done plenty of the wrong thing.”
“Can you-” Draco didn’t like the gravel in his voice so he cleared his throat, “could you summon my things from beside the pool?”
He couldn’t bring himself to attempt breakfast, but with nothing else to do; he felt out of place.
-----
When Potter saw he had gotten his attention, he said something that took Draco more back than his name.
“Then I’d tell you to get over yourself, but thankfully we aren’t having that issue.” Harry’s words were automatic and made more guilt crawl the length of Draco’s torso.
There stood Harry Potter, his tan skin glistening in the morning light, his hair wild, his eyes piercing in Draco’s clothes. The black slacks came up too high on his ankles, and the white button-up strained slightly on his shoulders. Draco had seen pornography less enticing.
Without a second thought, Draco rose and walked with his head held high towards his dorm. As soon as he had made it around the corner though, he found himself rather dizzy, leaning against the wall for all the support it could give as his aching body sagged. He was certain he looked a right state with his shaking body being covered in bright red stings and his willowed appearance.
Draco woke with a start and flinched away from whatever held his arm.
-----------
Once the vial was empty Draco took a shuddered gasp and grabbed back onto Harry.
------------
Draco pulled gingerly at the atrocious wrapping until it was completely unwrapped, there in his hands was a picture frame with a pressed and dried Narcissa within.
“What are you doing for Christmas Draco?” Harry looked up from wrapping a rather enormous book, that Draco had to assume was meant for Granger, and looked Draco in the eye, knocking the wind out of Draco.
“Did you have any plans for today?” Harry blew at the steam of his tea and looked Draco in the eye.
“No, I haven’t” Draco pulled his pack of cigarettes from his trunk.
Without hesitation, Draco’s boney fingers stretched to his razors, and he clasped the cool metal. Rolling up his sleeve was like revealing an atrocity.
There in front of Draco lay Tilly’s dead body. Draco’s wand was pointed and the taste of the killing curse still sat in his mouth. He had killed her. Her tiny body leaked blood that began to stain his shoes. His favorite pair of shoes were now sullied with an elf’s blood. A hand crept to his neck and grabbed hold, the unmistakable cool of his father’s hands burned as he heard the whispers began.
When Draco took his N.E.W.T.s he knew he passed with flying colors, and he was right. Harry whooped and cheered when they got their scores, Draco’s being at the top percentile.
Draco felt clothes being slid over him and he was thankful for Harry’s desire to help every miserable creature he came into contact with.
“You smoke?” Potter watched the curling smoke escape Draco’s lips.
“I’ve wanted to do that for so long.” Harry’s voice rang like bells and Draco smiled.
“What in the world do you have to be sorry for right now?” Harry’s hushed breath ran over Draco’s ear.
Draco could feel the dumbfounded look on his face.
“You haven’t been in The Great Hall,” Potter spoke, gazing at Draco.
"I owe my life to your mother, I was repaying her. How is she?" Potter's face was unreadable, but Draco was certain his wasn't as he felt horror wash across him before he could wipe it off for the neutral disinterest that he was known for.
Soon, much too soon, the water felt like nothing at all; the wind lapping at the freezing water didn’t phase his body.
“I really don’t mind Draco.” Harry had stopped laughing but his lips held a genuine smile as he placed his calloused hand over top Draco’s silky one.
Draco turned and looked out to all the land that had been preserved by his family's money and wondered what would happen to it when he sold. He couldn’t find it in himself to truly mind, though.
-------------
Harry leaned down to place a possessive kiss on Draco’s lips, and Draco was pleasantly surprised by the lump that touched his stomach from between Harry’s thighs.
Harry wished that Draco was here, a wish that presented a stark difference from his younger years.
------------
“Yes. I could go back to the manor.” Draco couldn’t piece together why he had asked Harry in the first place, but he figured it had something to do with talking to literally no one else for weeks.
Christmas was rapidly approaching to Draco’s chagrin, and he knew the manor would be there to greet him with icy marble floors and empty rooms.
“Oh.” Draco couldn’t string his thoughts together as he walked towards Harry’s bed and sat at the end.
Draco drooped at hearing that he had not in fact murdered an innocent, the fight leaking out of him. He noted the cool tear stains on his cheeks while he tried desperately to catch his breath.
Going to take what he hoped to be a soothing shower before an early night, he walked into the en suite bathroom. He shed his clothing in several fluid motions and placed his too expensive soaps. The water sprayed over him like a balm, and he hummed in satisfaction.
Draco woke, rolled onto his stomach, and screamed into his pillow. Of course, this was the perfect time for Draco’s childhood crush on Harry to make itself known again.
“Just call for a house-elf, you know they’ll be happy to bring you something,” Now Potter looked at him as if he were daft for not having the idea. “Then you can stop giving yourself lung cancer for a bit.”
Draco pulled the smoke deep into his lungs and his eyes fluttered in satisfaction, he blew the smoke above himself and Harry, stretching his neck to do so.
“We are friends,” Harry stated dismissively when understanding dawned on him and he had to force his jaw closed.
Harry reached out and put his hands on either side of Draco’s face and brought Draco towards him. This time Harry was prepared, and the kiss was passionate. Draco felt high on Harry’s breath alone as they kissed each other so deeply he felt he was touching Harry’s soul.
“What?” Harry was full-on doubled over laughing now.
“Isn’t it a little early for a smoke?” Harry questioned, still sitting beside Draco’s fragile form, hand resting on Draco’s shoulder like a plaster over a wound.
“We are not. You want to leave, you’re just telling yourself you don’t and since I’m quite tired of the room smelling of cigarettes, you are coming with me to lunch.” Harry seemed smug as he spoke.
Harry swung the door to their shared room open and walked in, closing it behind him and gazing directly at Draco. Draco felt a sudden sweltering heat that must have blown in from the window, so he flicked his cigarette out of sight and shut it.
“Who did that to you? I’ll kill them.” Harry’s eyes didn’t move from Draco’s arm as he threatened.
“Stop it!” Cried Harry’s voice above the cacophony of spell casting, and they did.
Draco thought for a moment, scrubbing the tears from his face, flashes of the house elf’s corpse at his feet causing his chest to clench.
-----------
“Harry rested his head in the crook of Draco’s shoulder and nodded. Draco reached between them and placed his hand on the soft pajama bottoms that held back Harry's throbbing member. Harry grunted and pushed into Draco’s hand. Draco’s own cock was throbbing with blood by the second. Harry moved the collar of Draco’s shirt and began to suck a love bite on the crook of his neck. The noise that escaped Draco was nearly pornographic, and Harry chuckled in satisfaction. Draco began to slip his hand under Harry’s shirt and over the planes of his stomach and chest. Slowly he worked his back down towards the more pressing issue and graced his hand into Harry’s pants. Harry wasn’t wearing any underwear, which made his gut clench desperately as his hand roamed some short curls before brushing Harry’s member. Harry groaned again as Draco slipped him out of his pants, seeing that Harry was impressively large.
“It can’t be stupid if it’s making you this upset.” The words left Draco without a thought, but he was glad they did because it seemed to cause a shift in Harry as he leaned into Draco’s side and closed his eyes for a moment.
When they finally pulled apart, panting slightly, Draco rested his head on Harry’s shoulder and Harry wrapped his arms around Draco and laughed.
-----------
“Oh, Gods.” Harry gasped before he went and busied himself with collecting bandages and the like.
Once he had stuffed his clothes haphazardly into his luggage, he waved his mother's wand to summon a house-elf, before remembering they had freed them all after the trials and he was glad when no one appeared to help him pack. Some of his favorite elves had begged to stay, cried on their knees, but Draco had to look away, disgusted with their loyalty as he presented them each with idiotic little vests that he had spent several weeks sewing by hand. They could only truly be free, far away from here.
“Yes, I use the bathroom at least three times a day for your information.” It wasn’t Draco’s best come back, he could admit that.
Maybe Harry knew he couldn’t convince Draco of his innocence because he only whispered; “Shhh, you’re having a panic attack, has this happened to you before?”
Carrying Draco was much easier than dragging him through water, Harry thought as he climbed the stairs and pushed open every door until he came across a bathtub. Draco stirred slightly as he was set down into the tub. Harry pushed down the drain stopper and ran warm water, not hot as he knew that would hurt Draco’s delicate skin.
“Hermione and Ron are spending lunch in the library so you don’t have to worry about them,” Harry said as he heaped a large serving of mashed potatoes onto his plate.
“Hey,” Draco whispered against Harry’s lips. “May I?”
“What do you mean ‘what’?” Draco demanded. “It’s Christmas morning and you’re stuck in this blasted manor without a gift in sight, all because I needed rescuing like some damsel in distress!”
At lunchtime, Draco had managed to stumble over to their window and smoke out of it, attempting to be courteous to his roommate.
Draco was doing just that when Harry entered the room with dinner. Draco took the plate gratefully from Harry’s outstretched hand.
Horror washed over Draco, he had completely forgotten the notion of Christmas as soon as he set foot in the manor. There in front of him sat the most well-known wizard in the entire world, and he hadn’t even a gift for him.  Draco put his head in his hands and groaned.
Draco found himself asleep before Harry had even left the room. His dreams mingled together in a blur of confusion until one stuck out like a sore thumb.
“Certainly.” Draco placed the coin in Tilly’s tiny hands that made the coin look huge.
“I’m sorry I didn’t get you anything,” Draco mumbled.
Harry dropped the vial off the side of the bed and curled into Draco, bringing them down on the pillows and wrapping them in the blankets. Draco’s breathing evened.
"Not much to be done about it, Potter."
----------
After a while, Draco had taken to sitting at the head of his bed and staring into nothing.
Harry’s glare was cut short by Draco leaning down and kissing his cheek. Harry shuffled, more awake, and quickly rolled the both of them so that he was on top of Draco.
----------
“You smell like lavender, your laugh sounds like a birds song, you are kind, you are smart, the clothes you wear fit you perfectly, your skin is like snow, I can pick you up, you talk in your sleep, you count on your fingers, you hum when you’re pleased, your breath tastes like cream..”
He had long before the Patronus' arrival decided to skip dinner, his nerves already fried. He hadn't eaten often over the summer, so it wasn't difficult to skip another meal here and there, though he would have to face the Great Hall, eventually. The thought made him shudder.
----------
Before Draco could even wrap his hands around the brunette’s neck as he so wanted to do, a house-elf appeared between the two with a plate of cheese and assorted fruits, disappearing just as quickly after setting the plate in Draco’s shaking hand, his cig between two fingers on his right hand completely forgotten.
Draco and Harry continued in their pattern for a while, they would have conversations here and there, Draco would smoke cigarettes and cover his dark mark in scar tissue, Harry would go to classes and bring back food from the kitchens, they only woke from nightmares once in a while, and it worked.
Draco’s tear threatened to fall as he looked up at the ceiling. Suddenly, there was a weight next to him, Potter had sat down.
He found that asking a house-elf to do away with his luggage made his gut churn unpleasantly. Images of his father sneering down at the unlucky elf who was forced to throw himself at a wall flicked violently through his memory. Draco couldn't even think of what the poor creature had done to deserve it but he was certain it didn't warrant that abuse. He approached the painting of none other than his ex headmaster and the man he had once been ordered to kill; Albus Dumbledore.
“The luckiest,” Draco said with whatever breath was left in his lungs.
----------
Draco knew his feelings could never be reciprocated. Harry Potter was the chosen one and Draco Malfoy was a death eater. It didn’t help that Harry was probably definitely straight.
He had known he had a crush on Harry Potter since he had seen him getting his robes tailored their first year. Harry Potter was not only the boy who lived, but the boy Draco dreamed about. The day that Harry rejected Draco's hand in friendship was the worst day of little Draco's life. He had craved Harry's attention from then on.
“Alright Tilly, it would make me very happy if you,” Draco rummaged around in his pocket for a second before pulling out a galleon. “Would accept this as payment.”
The brunette starred right through Draco and took a long blink before nodding. Draco’s mouth went dry. He turned stiffly to his bed and rummaged through his bag, more so for something to do than anything else.
That morning Harry got up and dressed without a word to Draco, who was curled into himself like a child without any intention of moving. The weight on Draco’s chest anchored him to his bed, his head fogged with nonsensical thoughts about running back to the cold empty manor that he called home. His ex-nemesis had not only been woken by his shrieks but had sat with him as he cried about nothing. Draco was mortified.
“Harry. Call me Harry and you have no idea how much I wish we could.” Harry’s voice cracked, and he scrubbed at his face.
“Alright then.” Harry stood swiftly then and walked over to his own bed. Draco couldn’t help the way his body flopped down onto his mattress without the support of Harry’s presence to hold him up.
“Really, Mr. Draco sir? Are you sure?” Tilly’s eyes filled with tears that made Draco shudder.
“Is there anything to go back to?” Harry’s question was innocent enough, but the answer ached like a hole in Draco’s chest.
-------
“Hey.” Harry’s rough and sleep ridden voice spoke from beside him.
“Bloody Gryffindor Savior with a hero complex trying to drag me out of my own bedroom! The nerve!” Draco slid into his robes and stood at the door, tapping his foot impatiently.
----------
Draco held Potter's eyes until the brunette looked away.
“Harry? How can I help?” Draco was becoming more frantic, he had never seen Harry Potter in this way and he truly never wished to again.
The holidays continued in an ease that soothed Draco. He had quickly taken to sleeping in Harry’s bed because it smelled like the brunette and he seemed to sleep restfully instead of intermittent states of panic. Harry never complained, just chuckled, and lifted the cover for Draco to slide under.
“You must forgive my foolishness, I’m so sorry for the trouble, please feel free to send me the costs of your trip back.” It was easy for him to slip into the way he had been raised, especially when it came to speech patterns, the formality lathering his every word like he was performing.
Draco’s body sagged onto his bed and he placed his hands over his face, rubbings at the stress under his skin.
-------
Shaking his head in a dull effort to clear it, he started towards the stairs that he hoped led him to a bed, maybe with a pillow, he could scream into. The stairs were short and when he arrived at the top, he looked above the first door to his right, to a plaque that read to his horror "Malfoy & Potter".
Draco thought he might scream but found he lacked the energy. “Everything! Everything’s so wrong! I was so wrong!”
Harry nodded sleepily and stretched out his empty hand, which quickly caught a pile of clothes and a wand that had come rushing through the door. It certainly wasn’t the first time that Draco had seen someone’s power as attractive, but the way a pool of electric warmth settled beneath his navel made him shiver as a good reminder. Harry stretched his hand full of Draco’s things towards the blonde as he yawned and rubbed at his face with the other hand.
“I’ll stay as long as you want me.”
With little of a thought, Draco walked to the bathroom where he took in his reflection. His eyes were still sunken, skin grey, and his body still looked sickly and frail. He then remembered the blemish he could remove, that sat right under his sleeve, that if gone would surely make bounds in his appearance.
Finally, Harry gave one firm squeeze to Draco’s cock and Draco came back arching into the air and a scream pulling from him. He saw nothing but white as his nerves tingled and danced in pleasure. He only began to come down when he felt kisses being pressed all over his face.
“Alright, Draco. Can I heal those hexes for you?” Harry’s empathy was leaking from his every pore and wrapping Draco in it.
“You don’t have to,” Draco whispered, trying not to let pleasure drip into his voice.
“My parents- my parents died on Halloween, a bit of a bummer really, makes it hard to enjoy the holiday. You know, the feast just doesn’t taste the same if all you can hear is your mother’s screams while you eat. Seems foolish to miss people you never knew though.” Harry looked at his hands that were playing with the edge of his blanket as he spoke, the tears rolling slower down his face than before.
Draco recalled when The Prophet had published the expose on Harry and the Weaslette's breakup and the thrill that shot through him before he had quickly squashed the thought. Draco had always thought Harry too good for her, anyway.
Two years in and they bought a house, they both now saw a therapist of their own and their bad days became less frequent.
“It’s not your fault, Potter.” Draco’s voice creaked like an old chair.
Draco felt warmth begin to settle into his bones and he hummed in agreement. Suddenly, his arm was pulled from his side and his eyes shot open. Potter was holding his arm up to his face, the arm covered in self-inflicted carnage. Draco pulled back and shuffled to get in a better position when he realized he was buck naked. It all came back to Draco with startling clarity, the pool, then Harry, now the bath.
“Filthy Death Eater scum!” Screamed a voice from behind them.
Draco leaned over and kissed Harry’s cheek.
“Why would I?” Draco felt confusion strewn across his features.
“I’m heading to the manor, what about you?” Draco hoped against the odds that the statement didn’t come off as intensely depressing as it was.
“Fuck.” Harry said as he grabbed hold of Draco’s hair.
“You were just a kid.” Draco countered, thinking longingly of his cigarette.
----------
"Fuck, Malfoy. Sorry."
“Haven’t you got anything less formal?” Harry asked as he scratched at his shoulder, Draco knew that shirt, it was very itchy for something so expensive.
Harry sat back, his legs crossed, and sighed.
----------
As Draco pushed open the grand doors, he felt warm air rush past him, escaping into the chilling evening. His shoes clicked over the marble as he walked past the sitting room, glad that the charm to light the fire in anyone’s presence had long since faded. The house felt hollow and much too powerful to be in Draco’s charge. It was like the thrumming heartbeat of this grand estate had died with his mother, now all that was left was unbridled death. Draco’s stomach churned unpleasantly at the thought.
Draco looked to his damaged skin and was satisfied. He rinsed his arm and rolled down his sleeve. He apparently had impeccable timing because a startling knock pounded at the other side of the bathroom door.
He always knew that humans had large capacities for hate, having been raised by Death Eaters and later the Dark Lord himself, but he had never known that self-hatred could be so prominent. As a child had no reason to dislike himself, he was an heir to the Malfoy throne after all. As a teenager, he had started to have doubts about his family and consequently himself. He found those doubts to have come far too late when he watched the atrocities inflicted by the same man who had branded him. There was no escape for him, he has been claimed by his heritage before he was even given the chance to have distinct morals. Now that he was far away from that life, it never seemed closer. Disgust crawled his spine and reminded him that hundreds of the students in the castle he sat in right now had been harmed by his actions and had seen the hatred he reaped. Draco’s body curled further into himself and he hoped against the odds that peaceful sleep would take him.
Deciding to walk toward his first class and sit outside the door in the hall was his plan. It proved to be a stupid plan that made him susceptible to stinging hex after another when he nodded off. His skin boiled where the hexes had struck and he shielded himself with a textbook, feeling rather deserving of the ambush that only calmed when the day’s first professor walked out of his door to investigate.
So he waited, cigarette between his lips, for something to happen.
“No need to apologize, I well... I get them too so I suppose this evens the playing field a bit. Try to breathe with me.” Harry’s voice was calming and Draco caught more frequent breaths, focusing on Harry’s hand resting lightly on his shoulder.
“You’re so fucking pretty, Draco,” Harry whispered as he began to stroke faster.
Draco breathed deeply, calming the anxiety scratching at his chest only slightly.
“No, no, I don’t think so.” Draco breathed out unevenly and reached for his cigarettes.
“Hmm?”
----------
“I’m sorry! Oh my Gods! I’m so sorry!” Draco began to remove himself from beneath Harry, who was unmoving.
“Truce!” Draco giggled as he looked up at Harry who had him pinned.
"Potter," Draco turned on his heel towards his roommate, trying not to sneer. "I know that we've had our differences but I must thank you for speaking at my trial. I owe my life to you." He decided not to mention that Potter hadn't spoken for his father, who had received the dementor's kiss.
Without another thought, Harry jumped into the pool and swam, swam as quickly as his freezing limbs would allow and grabbed hold of Draco’s limp body.
The decorations were simple and neutral, the room empty of movement save for a crackling fireplace that sent a shiver down his spine. He missed Goyle sometimes; they were never close but Vincent was a constant protector and now his absence was a reminder of the death of his childhood.
“Don’t be sorry! I don’t need anything, I just stumbled across this and thought of you is all.” Harry pushed the package into Draco’s hands.
Sobs ripped from Draco’s chest like claws, and Harry wrapped his arms around him.
----------
Harry had suggested they go down to the kitchens for dinner since not many students had stayed back; it wouldn’t be a bother to the elves. Draco had eventually agreed after some placating.
“Do you mind?” Draco asked, more out of social obligation than anything else as he lit it by the tip of his mother’s wand.
They were walking up to the dorms when Harry placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder for a moment and the deepest warmth seemed to seep from it. A warming spell.
It was Potter's turn to display horror across his face.
“No, I suppose there isn’t.”
Draco was taken back by Harry’s directness, they hadn’t spoken to each other for days on end but now he had the audacity to order Draco about and what was worse, Draco wanted to listen. Draco didn’t think of himself as easily bossed around, but something within him wanted to do what Harry said. Probably, Draco thought, it was Harry’s Gryffindor ability to lead people into danger as he had done most of his life.
“You're lucky you’re cute,” Harry smirked down at the now helpless blonde.
As he brushed his teeth, he looked to his reflection, and it pleased him to not see Lucius Malfoy looking back at him, but that's where the pleasantries stopped. His gaze fell to his dark mark, and he sucked in an icy breath of disgust.
“Do you wanna talk about it?” Harry whispered, his face so open to whatever Draco had to say.
“Do you think I should stay here?” Draco glanced up to Harry who was sitting on his bed doing his homework. Draco popped a grape from the plate Harry had brought from the kitchen into his mouth.
It would be nice, Draco thought, if loving someone and being loved cured people. He would like that, but it wasn’t how the world spun. Draco had never known this to be more true than right then.
“Please don’t go,” Draco begged into Harry’s shoulder.
“Thank you,” Draco said in awe.
When the final days of school crawled towards them Harry and Draco decided to rent an apartment together. Harry didn’t want to go back to his godfather’s house, and Draco didn’t want to return to the manor.
Harry began to survey the boy for injury as the tub filled, and Draco woke. Harry was raking Draco’s body with his eyes when he came across a wad of purple scar tissue. Harry scooped Draco’s forearm from the water to get a closer look.
Draco pulled away to look at Harry, and he knew that he had done something he would regret. Harry’s eyes were shocked and his lips parted as if he just didn’t have the words.
“This is the eighth year table, you can sit with Slytherin if you like.” Harry rubbed at the back of his neck as if he felt wrong for leading Draco to the table they sat at.
----------
“Which room is yours?” Harry whispered to Draco, nose pressed to his hair.
It was soon dinner time, Potter had spent an extensive amount of time flipping through a Quidditch magazine while lying on his stomach until a Patronus had been sent by a voice that had to be Granger. It had asked him down to dinner, saying that she and Weasley had arrived.
Walking through the castle was uncomfortable, Draco held his head high as anxiety pulsed through him. Draco had no intent to make conversation with the man striding contently beside him, so they walked in silence, heels clicking.
“No, no, I quite think it’s better if I stay here at this point.” Draco thought of the hexes that would be thrown if he were to get up and walk across the hall and shuddered.
“Suppose I do, though you mustn't tell my father,” Draco spoke with a bitter chuckle, “it’s terribly muggle of me.”
“Draco! Draco, it’s just me, you were having a nightmare!” Harry spoke with a strangely calm voice for someone who was woken by screams.
Harry seemed to be confused, maybe a little offended, but said nothing as he rose from Draco’s bed.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ o ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Malfoy smiled.
"The spell is contained by a tangible object. It's inside of a small metal cask. Locked, of course."
Harry scanned the crush of warm bodies and sighed. The urge to feed was there, as always, but it was, at the moment, controllable. Mostly, Harry was bored.
"Do you mind knocking off a few minutes early? I'm in the mood for a pint."
"Don't do it alone. Just in case."
Harry gnawed his lip thoughtfully. He knew Draco's reason for not looking through his father's things; it was simply too painful. Harry was surprised Draco had even offered to translate for her. He opened the bag he held and was not surprised to see a dozen pairs of sunglasses in a variety of styles. Draco never did anything in half measures.
"I'll make a list and we can start checking them out in the morning."
"I don't care," Harry said adamantly. "I think they should leave."
"Now that you're awake, you can take that talent of yours and heal
Suppressing a shudder of desire, Harry took control of his wand, even though Draco's hand was still wrapped around his.
"A bed. You have a

Draco spun slowly and his toes trailed over the circle already drawn there from a dozen previous rotations. He no longer bothered to try and balance his weight on his toes; it had been a lost cause to begin with, and now he could only concentrate on trying to pull in another breath and exhale before he strangled on pain.
Harry doubted his logic was quite sound, but he couldn't think of a counter-argument through the alcohol fumes clouding his mind. Seamus trotted back a few minutes later with an old camera. He waved it in the air happily.
"Yes, Potter. Have we accomplished enough today? If so, I think I'll go home."
"And you stole mine from Shacklebolt."
"As far as the eye can see," Malfoy said. "Will you carry Ayah? She doesn't like Gavin, and I usually have to make two trips. In fact, she doesn't much like anyone, so take care she doesn't nip you."
Neither had Draco, frankly. Before he could gather his thoughts enough to comment on the fact, Potter had pushed himself away from the wall and, with a last muttered apology hanging in the air behind him, fled. Draco's brow furrowed. It was nearly ten minutes before he felt composed enough to step out of the darkened hallway. When he did, he went looking for Hermione Granger.
"Bastard tease," Harry muttered. "Did you learn nothing last night?"
"Well, now, that sounds mysterious. Where is his holiness? He can't be at home either, since that is a matter of public record."
"You said that you would make riding on that Muggle contraption
"Come on, Malfoy, if we're going to be exclusive and you're going to be seen with me in public, I think we might as well skip the silly dancing around the issue. I like you, all right? And I think I could grow to like you a lot more, so it's
Wednesday, 28.4.2004
The Basilica of Santa Croce was an impressive structure, although after viewing Hogwarts, Harry had difficulty finding more than a passing appreciation for other stone edifices.
"Shite, shite, double-shite--is this even a cock, Merlin help us, I believe he's trying to be
kissing it." Harry marched forwards and levered himself over the edge. Draco was suddenly glad of the safety-minded Muggles. He would have been… concerned if Harry had suspended himself over nothingness in this rain.
"Well, it explains why you… why you were so friendly with me."
"Are you sure about this?" Blaise's features were indistinct due to the Umbrella Charm that surrounded his upper body, but even with the droplets dribbling down between them, Draco could picture the dark look sent his way. He smiled and his footsteps slowed. "When have I ever been uncertain about anything?"
"Let me lube this up for you," Potter said as he tossed the wand on the bed. He slid back down and took Draco's cock into his mouth as though he'd been starving for cock and needed to swallow as much as possible. He gripped the base and pulled slowly off, sucking hard the while, and then swirled his tongue over the head in a move that had Draco nearly arching off the bed while making inarticulate gasp-groans.
"Probably not. I need you to do something for me."
"Note to Weasley," Draco said companionably and used a spell to clear a path, unwilling to risk another metal spike though his foot; it throbbed painfully with every step. "Never tie her up. It seems to anger her."
"C… c… cold," he managed.
Draco looked at Harry. "I know where she is." He levelled a Stunner at Eddie, who toppled over without a sound. Several additional spells left him bound him tightly.
" Harry asked.
"I've been yours for quite a while," Harry admitted.
"How do you know that?"
"I was hoping he'd been eaten by a thestral, or possibly smothered by a lethifold." Ron smiled dreamily, as if envisioning the gruesome scenarios.
"Well, then, I suppose I owe you one," Draco purred and let his hand slip beneath the green silk to touch Potter's abdomen. Potter leaped backward and cracked his hip against the back of the couch. Draco moved forward, effectively trapping him. "Don't be nervous, Potter, you've already felt me up. Tit for tat and all that." Draco's hand moved purposefully downward and he gripped Potter's cock, which was already pleasantly hard. Draco smirked, but Potter's nervous panting was more satisfying than any witty retort, as was the moan that seemed wrenched from Potter's throat.
"All right, girl. Find Draco."
“I suppose I wanted to see if this morning was just a fluke,” Malfoy replied.
He handed the note to Potter, who swore.
"Spoilsport. Let's go."
"That one is known as the Godric." The voice was cool and not unfamiliar. Harry turned to see Narcissa Malfoy standing a few feet away. She held a large, flat basket half-filled with cut flowers. Her hair had been pulled back away from her face and she wore simple-looking robes in a dusky shade of pink. "Of course, I always lied to Lucius about that. He would have had them torn out, I think. He never understood that roses are more than their names. All he cared about were those beastly peacocks. Hello, Mr Potter."
"That's the wrong box," Malfoy said.
Harry forced himself to move, taking several steps until he was stood next to Malfoy's perch.
“You want to come, don’t you, Potter?” Malfoy asked and nibbled on the sensitive flesh beneath the head of Harry’s cock, using his tongue to push beneath the lace of the panties.
Harry lowered his wand guiltily and noted that Malfoy did the same. Giving in to a sudden impulse, Harry stepped even closer to Malfoy and slung an arm around his shoulders. "Of course not, Minister. Malfoy here was just showing me the proper technique for casting a Heat Detection Spell. We're great pals now, didn't you know?"
"Look, you know Granger bought into this plan. At least trust her if you won't give me the benefit of the doubt. I would not have allowed Pansy and Blaise to attend if I thought they would be in the slightest danger. I have few enough friends that I can't risk the ones I have. In fact, they are the only two. Well, there is Gryphon, but—frankly, Potter, we don't have time for this. I'm certain you'll do whatever heroic act is needed should the occasion warrant. We've already gone over every possible scenario and I need to get back to Rosier before Pansy does something stupid and gives it all away. What do you use to shave, by the way? Your face is delightfully smooth."
"I did. The fucking Ministry bollixed up his transfer to Azkaban and he escaped. Of course, he wants revenge. He fancies himself the next Dark Lord."
Harry shut his eyes on the memory and took a steadying breath.
There was a pregnant pause and then Ron said, "Yeah. Okay. Um…"
Harry shook his head with a tight smile. "Is that really what you've brought to bargain with? Greyback is in Azkaban, and has been since the war."
"Well…" She swallowed and then raised a brightly lacquered nail to pause the thought as she drank the last of Draco's apricot juice. "I've just returned from Cambridge and it turns out that Mark Birmingham owns a substantial estate there. You should see the grounds! Even I was impressed. He wasn't there when I 'happened' by, so I stopped in to ask a neighbour about him. The elderly gentleman was quite happy to see me."
Narcissa put down her teacup and hugged Draco at that. He only looked mildly uncomfortable and Harry smiled.
“But it occurred to me that there have been several incidences in your past that were never appropriately accounted for,” Malfoy continued.  As he spoke he smacked Harry’s wand against his open palm—once again clad in black gloves, Harry noted.  His mouth went dry at the sound and his mind spun with the memory of those gloves touching him.
He broke the connection, banked the fire, and went back to bed.
Draco felt like seven kinds of a fool as he quickly passed through the grubby barroom of the Leaky Cauldron, hoping to hell no one recognized him. He plucked at the waistband of the unfamiliar denim trousers—the
"I do not snore!"
like that.
"I suppose. Where do you want to go? The canteen?"
"The first thing I plan to do is get rid of those heinous floral arrangements," Draco muttered as Luna Lovegood entered through the opposite door. Trailing behind her was a veritable forest of potted chrysanthemums. Lovegood stopped short.
Her fingers tightened around Draco's. "I paid for that betrayal, as well. I sometimes think the Dark—
Harry thought back to her file. Her birthdate was two years before Harry's; it was hard to believe she had been teased out of Hogwarts only two years before he'd arrived. Harry could not imagine giving up magic. Not for any amount of teasing or tormenting. He had a few unpleasant memories of his own from Hogwarts, namely the Heir of Slytherin incident in his second year, but he would never have turned his back on Hogwarts. He opened his mouth to say so, but Malfoy's voice cut in.
Hermione coughed and seemed to shake herself. "I don't know, it was very odd. Do you think you can do it again, Harry?"
"Bloody hell, Weasley, are you mad? There is no telling what you might unleash doing that. Some of these are not mirrors, but doorways. Mirrors have tricky magic even in their simplest form. They never reflect reality.
"What is so bloody funny about that?" Hermione gritted, nearly giving him another attack of the giggles.
“Should it? You’re the one about to be hexed by your housemates, I think. Nott looks none too pleased.”
Harry nearly suggested they stop off at Malfoy Manor in order to give her time to do some real research, but he did not think Draco was quite ready to have his least favorite Gryffindors tromping through his mansion, even in its current state of renovation.
"Quite right, Auror Potter. We've been working on a spell that will, in theory, contain intangible—and near intangible—creatures."
"I do know that. Come on, I'll protect you." He held out his hand as he opened the door.
"Any of them. I'll know where to go once we open it." With that, he walked to the nearest door and yanked on the handle. It opened to reveal such brightness that they all had to blink and cover their eyes in order to adjust to it. Once he could see again, Harry stood next to Draco and peered through to what seemed to be a large, open plain of grass, yellowed from heat, extending away into a great distance where a tiny jutting of mountains broke the horizon line. "Right, then. We need the third door to the left of this one. Go open it now or the room will spin again when we shut this."
Draco opened his eyes and immediately shut them at the sudden onset of light-induced pain. The tent had no windows—they had never found it necessary to pamper their clients to that extent—so it was relatively dim in the room, but even that was enough to give him a bloody headache. What the hell had happened?
"I'll repay her by not hexing her arse for meddling in my affairs," Draco growled.
Hermione's face showed no surprise. In fact, she smiled. "Harry, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm actually very happy that you've finally come to grips with it." She leaned forward and took one of his hands in both of hers. "I honestly thought you would be in denial forever."
The words rooted him to the spot, mainly because Draco had used his first name.
"I thought you weren't going to ask. But no, we were not."
Draco pulled his hair again and then kissed Harry until his breathing turned into lovely panting gasps and his fingers dug into Draco's flesh.
Draco packed the last of his gear and prepared to mount his broom. Harry slung on his cape and heard something rustle as he fastened it around his throat. He reached into a pocket and pulled out the note Draco had sent him, so long ago. Harry opened it, intending to skim it once more and then be rid of it forever.
She blinked at him. "Sir? I got a pay increase six weeks ago."
"The peacocks are gone?"
"Hermione!"
Tuesday, 11.5.2004
. This is a celebration, not a time for strife.
Harry's hand tightened and he leaned closer. He already knew what Draco had found at home. He'd read the reports, but hearing it first hand, knowing the anguish that young Draco had been about to encounter made him sick to his stomach when he remembered his own first reaction at the news.
"Draco—"
Even so, the memory of how he had got that way served to stop his breathing a dozen times while he remembered Malfoy’s hands, and tongue, and
Tuesday, 1.6.2004
"We found a reference to this book and Granger remembered seeing it in here last night," Malfoy said mildly.
And not just because people kept kissing Draco Malfoy.
, Two, 'You will marry into a family of sufficient blood purity', Three, 'You will produce at least one Malfoy heir and continue our lineage', Four, 'You will—'. Never mind. As I said, not happy memories." Malfoy lowered his hands. His eyes seemed to track the stone railing that edged the upper gallery. A faint flush tinted his cheeks and Harry realized he probably regretted his outburst.
"Don't get used to it," he warned dryly, but he grinned when he said it. In truth, most of his pure-blooded ideals had been shattered in the war. And then there was Harry, whose blood Draco had once thought tainted. Now he would die before allowing a drop of it to be shed. Then again, everything in Draco's life could trace back to Harry one way or another.
Harry beamed at Ron and then caught him in a crushing hug. Ron laughed and tried to break Harry's ribs with his return embrace.
"What? You wanted me to
Finally catching the hint, Bertram pulled a moue of obvious pique and flounced out. Draco had stopped writing again and his grey stare was intense but unreadable.
… He couldn't suppress his gasping, choking cries.
Harry shook his head and followed Curtis with one last glance at the woman. The room they entered was brightly decorated in a balloon theme, with large balls of colour on the walls, balloon-shaped floating lamps, and other spherical paraphernalia. Curtis placed his daughter in the crib and she gnawed on the rattle while staring up at him through huge blue eyes.
"How is everything this morning, Mr Malfoy?" Mindy placed the usual stack of mail on his desk.
Harry shook his head sadly. "Not with that one. He hates me, although he doesn't remember that right now."
"We need to get to the Department of Mysteries
Draco's hand did not fall away, instead, his fingers traced down the side of Harry's face, causing the breath to catch in his throat.
"You've been working for Mulciber all along?"
"Give me a bloody break!" Crabbe yelled. "It's a fucking Malfoy. His life isn't worth all of this. He isn't worth one hair on this fine figure of an Auror's head." He gave Klein a shake.
The green eyes flashed angrily. "Can you please just take me to Goyle? Time is of the essence."
"Counsellor Cockamamie?" Angelique asked at the same time.
"Well! Oh my! This is... This is quite an honour, Mr Potter, sir!"
"Very well, then. Call if you need anything."
Ron coughed. "Yeah. Want me to go tell him you're… busy?" Ron looked away and flushed nearly scarlet at the word.
, Harry finished as Draco trailed off. The silver eyes had shifted and Harry turned to see Hermione in the doorway.
He sent Seamus back for Eddie and had him taken to Auror holding. Harry watched Eddie stumble past, awake but groggy, bound sturdily with magical bonds. He felt a twinge when their eyes met. Eddie tried to speak, but Harry turned away, trying to hold onto Draco's earlier words. Harry hadn't been in love with Eddie, but it had been a near thing and would have eventually led to his utter devastation, if not for Draco.
What are you talking about? You haven't tainted me. Why are you holding me so tightly?"
"Exactly. Who would go there?"
"You don't look frantic. And Pansy was here last night when your owl arrived."
"You're being ridiculous, Ronald, and I'm not going to argue with you about this any longer, inside or outside!"
Harry blinked at him. "What? But I can't—"
"We are not good at talking about other things, Potter."
So Harry had let him go. That had been four agonizing months ago, the worst winter of Harry's entire life.
"I don't think that has changed much," Potter said with a snort as he opened the door to the pizza parlour.
"I suppose that will work. For starters."
He went straight home after class (feeling slightly disappointed that Malfoy hadn't asked him to stay after this time) and pulled out copies of his earlier cock photos. He sat down on the bed and shook his head with dismay. They were absolutely dreadful, and now he knew why. The composition was off, and the lighting--Merlin, he was lucky to have earned an A on the last photo, due to the ridiculous lighting!
," Harry half-sobbed. He tipped his head up to watch and the sight was nearly his undoing. Draco's blond hair fell messily over his forehead and Harry's cock disappeared and reappeared into Draco's mouth with each stroke that sent quivers of delight shivering through Harry's entire being.
Despite his shout, he did not release the headboard, so Draco took pity on him and licked a stripe up Potter's cock, earning a tortured-sounding intake of breath.
"Must you spend all day chatting inanely with Muggles? I would like to get this over with and get out of here."
Hermione flushed, but picked up a sheaf of papers and handed them to Draco, who scanned them with a single raised eyebrow.
Malfoy smiled when he opened the door and Harry grinned back. A canvas tote dangled from Harry's shoulder and he held it out, gripping it by the straps. "I come bearing gifts this time."
"Wait," Harry said. "The wards are down and we don't want Muggle company. Give me a minute to reset the Anti-Muggle Charms."
Harry was not forgiven.
Mrs Wells-Barton gave a tearful gasp that Draco suspected was entirely faked. He could practically see the gears turning and wished her luck, although he doubted that Wells-Barton was deceased. Either he had been in on Rosier's plot from the beginning or he was bound and stuffed into a closet somewhere. Of course, there was always the chance that he wouldn't be found before starving to death or suffocating. She could hope for that, at least.
"You need not sit on the floor, Mr Potter."
Day off! I took a long nap and then sent Kreacher out to restock the pantry so we don't starve to death. Sometimes I forget that he needs every detail spelled out or he will just lurk around the house all day doing nothing.
"Are you sure?"
"Don't go yet," Draco said behind him. He heard more than felt Draco moving, and then a warm body pressed against his back and enveloped him in a clinging hug as lips brushed over his neck.
"Now, Harry, the walls are thin and this bed creaks terribly. We can't disturb the Weasleys, you know."
And Harry laughed.
"That's totally awesome!" Teddy bellowed. He raced down the hall and thundered up the stairs. Harry pulled out his wand and cast an invisible barrier that would keep Teddy from toppling over the railing if he got too close to the edge.
"Me, too," Hermione added with a glance at Ron, who shrugged.
Monday, 5.1.2004
While Draco worked, Crabbe and his goons systematically sent spell after spell at the warding circle, which had no effect other than causing the runes to glow more brightly. Draco suspected they were sustained by magic and anything sent against it merely made the wards stronger.
“I don’t see anything,” a Slytherin girl snapped. Harry thought she resembled a giraffe.
"So we were only half dead?"
Tim launched into an explanation of what they had been up to, embellishing at will, and making the others laugh at his increasingly outlandish descriptions. Narcissa seemed riveted by the tale and exhibited evident pride when Tim revealed that Draco had been the one to invent the spell that had taken down the creatures. Draco only rolled his eyes. With the alcohol pleasantly warming Harry's insides and Draco sitting far closer than Harry had expected, he allowed himself to bask in contentment. He was meant to have dinner with Ron and Hermione later, but for now he was happy enough to enjoy the company of his teammates and his enigmatic partner.
"Cho Chang. It was rather like kissing a wet sponge," Harry admitted wryly. It had been a happy memory at one time, but had worn down into a vaguely uninteresting muse.
have a problem with it because Draco was quite alone at the moment. But looking for illegal potions ingredients always put him in a traipsing mood. He even though about humming a happy tune, but sometimes that attracted irritating creatures like fairies and mentally-challenged songbirds.
Harry laughed aloud at Draco's growing bafflement. There was a good chance Draco would decline his invitation when he discovered what Harry had in mind, but Harry hoped his competitive nature would win in the end. He nodded.
Harry sighed heavily. "Yeah. Bloody hell, is it really too much to ask that someone restock the fucking milk? It's Monday morning, for Merlin's sake."
Draco sat down on the bed and watched in amusement as Harry pulled out a small earthenware jar. The wicked look in his eyes caused Draco to raise a brow. "What is it?"
Draco hugged her tightly. "Christine?"
"Indeed. I would love to take you to Isabeau's new boutique in Actu Alley. She sells the most adorable shoes," Narcissa added.
Harry was beginning to think the man was a few feathers short of a Snitch.
Toby grinned and nodded. One of his teeth jutted out at an odd angle and he had a habit of playing with it with his tongue. "Yeah, plenty of pipes needed replacing. We had a whole team working day and night. Took most of the summer. I bought a new chair with my extra income." He patted the arms of the plaid chair in which he sat. "Has Vibratin' and Massage Charms," he added in a low voice.
When he made his way back to the cistern stairs, Zabini and Parkinson were gone. Cursing every Slytherin he'd ever met, Harry pelted down into the darkness after them.
"Hermione! What's wrong?"
Ron stormed into the shop in a fine rage, slamming past a female underling that was preparing to lock the doors for the evening.
Draco Flooed straight into Potter's house. He barely took in the décor before stomping out of the room and into a small kitchen, also empty. Bloody hell, if Potter wasn't home, Draco would be tempted to burn the damned place down.
She grinned. "Well, then. I suppose I'll make us some tea, since you'll apparently be here for a while. I think we have some chocolate biscuits that Ron hasn't located yet." He followed her to the kitchen and helped her ransack the pantry while they waited.
"He'd probably try a longer jump," Draco said decisively. "Let's try the Villa."
Impulsively, he took the button and marched into Eddie's room. Feeling like he'd acquired an important clue, he rapidly flicked through each of Eddie's hanging garments. Shirt after shirt, robe after robe; none of them had related buttons. Neither did his waistcoats or tunics. A quick search of Eddie's drawers turned up the same results. The button was an anomaly.
Draco. The same Draco who was back to treating Harry like he was lower than squid droppings, or slug slime, or some other foul substance found on the bottoms of shoes or the darkest dankest corners of a potions cabinet.
"It's a long story," Harry said lamely. "Blaise just needs a place to crash for the night."
"Do you think we should look for an ice cream shoppe?" Potter did not need to know Draco had amended his case-centric question. "For Teddy." Draco had discovered he rather liked jaunting around Britain searching for clues to the long-dead murder case, even if they had turned up little of value. It had been far better than sitting around at the Ministry. Also, Potter's mood had improved hundredfold; he practically glowed with vitality.
Potter lifted a brow at him. "All right."
Harry snorted, although he was impressed with the speed and tenacity of the gossipmongers. "Oh that," he said and dropped into his chair. "That was nothing. It was a joke." His stomach clenched when he said it, because the encounter in the lift had been anything but a joke, at least from Harry's perspective.
Hermione exchanged an anxious glance with Harry and then nodded. "Of course."
Weasley tried to rush forwards with a cry, but Harry held him back. "It's just a reflection, Ron, look." Harry was correct; Granger appeared in eight different mirrors, some close, some more distant. Finding her in reality would not be easy with reflections upon reflections beckoning them falsely.
It came without warning—Malfoy’s mouth was suddenly there, lapping at his arsehole, sucking it for a moment, and then pressing inside.  Harry cried out and thrashed in his bonds, nearly yanking free of Malfoy’s probing flesh, except the grip on his arse was firm and Malfoy moved with him, shoving forward until his tongue was as deep as it could possibly go.
Harry’s heart began to thud as he toed off his shoes and unfastened his trousers. He let them fall and then stepped out of them before kicking them beneath the chair to join his shoes. He still wore the emerald panties, of course, although his erection was partially disguised by the hem of the t-shirt he wore, which hung over the material.
"I think I'm getting there. Just go with it."
"What do you mean you're not going? Of course you're going! We're partners now!"
to produce even more Malfoys to be as bloody miserable as the rest of you?"
"What does Shacklebolt want this time? Could he not have simply demanded my presence in his office, as he usually does?"
"Tufnel Park. Islington."
Waiting for Draco, who had never arrived.
Harry planted kisses on his mouth, over and over, and finally took Draco's lower lip in a gentle bite before sucking on it. The action earned a groan from Draco and a shift in his position that pulled Harry more firmly against him.
"Hermione. Cool, innit?" Weasley lifted the cup and slurped at the hot tea.
Within the hour, all of them were comfortable enough in their casting ability to feel ready. "Let's go!" Tim said and bounced in place. "I'm ready to fry those creepy bastards! Have some Christmas cheer, dementors! Ha!"
Harry didn't last long after that. He had wanked mercilessly over the past few days, but even that had only taken the edge off his overwhelming desire. He reached out blindly and touched Draco's soft hair, clutching it as he whispered a warning. "Draco, I'm—"
"It was lovely to meet you!" Harry called to her retreating form and then looked owlishly at Draco. "What document?"
"Mistress Narcissa is being in the garden, Mr Harry Potter. Please to be following the path." The house-elf gestured at a smaller path that led beneath a rose-laden archway. Harry nearly sagged with relief at not having to enter the house.
"Similar, but not the same. With a Patronus, you are pulling forth your own happy memories and turning them into a tangible creature. With this spell, you can use something as simple as a sense of well-being, which is then magnified a thousand-fold."
"Hogwarts? You went to
Harry tossed his wand aside, cursing his luck. It was obvious he had just made things worse for everyone, except possibly Parkinson, who scuttled away around the edge of the circle until brought up short by a woman Harry hadn't even noticed. She gestured with her wand and Parkinson walked sedately over to join Shacklebolt and the others. Crabbe hadn't seemed to notice his victim's escape. He was fully focussed on Harry. A Summoning Charm called Harry's wand into Crabbe's hand and he smiled when he held it aloft.
"Poisoning case. Multiple victims. Those there are records from all the Cardiff apothecaries and potion dealers. Auror Weasley requests that you search for anyone selling Sorbus anglica berries. That's apparently a rare ingredient."
"You should definitely take the antidote. Just not
"Thanks, again," Malfoy said tightly, with only a hint of sarcasm.
He also fetched his wand and returned to the bed, where Potter was still sprawled in a sexed-out pose, looking spent and gorgeous. Draco wanted to pounce on him again, but he forced down the thought. Potter cracked open an eye and then sat up, alarm wiping out the sleepy look with terrifying speed. The Ministry had been fools to let him leave the Aurors, Draco realised.
"No. The opposite, actually. Anders assigned Ron elsewhere. We're scheduled to meet with the others in ten minutes. Are you ready?"
with Seamus. Not that you're not a fit bloke, Seamus."
Potter's pants were next, catching on one ankle as he tried to kick them away, but Draco didn't wait for them to join the trousers. He pounced on Potter, tackling him back onto the bed and kissing him breathless. One of Potter's arms was trapped, as he'd been in the process of shrugging out of the shirt, but when Draco was finished kissing him he didn't seem to have the energy to worry about finishing the job. Draco decided he rather liked him looking thoroughly unprepared, wearing nothing but socks and half a shirt.
. Wait until you taste these, Harry. Consuelo is a veritable goddess in the kitchen."
Ron had been released from St Mungo's and was at home recovering, although he was asleep by the time Harry left the hospital and Flooed in to find Hermione reading a book on the sofa. She sat up and gave him a smile.
Malfoy shook his head with a half-horrified, half-panicked look. "No. She detests me."
. In a flash of inspiration, Harry decided to test the theory.
"Oh, pish. Criminal types frequently panic and pull up stakes. Although in his case, he was probably alerted the moment the Aurors showed up at Azkaban to ask questions about Fenrir. How is the tea?" Draco smiled innocuously. Draco hadn't tipped the man off; he had
"Because he won't harm the boy if he wants a ransom. We won't trade for damaged goods."
"What's bacteria?"
"Well?" Draco asked as he took a drink.
"Isn't it obvious?"
Lunch was interesting. Okay, lunch was extremely awkward. We met at some swank pub that Malfoy obviously hangs out in, as they were all fawning over him and practically ignoring me, which was fine, it was good for a change, except that it was super-obvious he'd paid them to, or ordered them to or whatever. Anyway, why am I hung up on that? I'm glad the staff paid me no mind. We were seated in the centre of the damn room and everyone else certainly noticed us, that much was obvious. I don't know if Malfoy thinks it will cause less gossip or more, putting us on display like that, except that it was anything but a romantic meal. He was stiff and business-like the entire time, asking about my latest case and made vague small talk about some unusual item he's been studying that he's not allowed to talk about. Even as I write this I'm not sure what he wanted.
"Oh god," Angelique said, and then darkness joined the cold, as if stars and streetlights and house lights had been swallowed up. "Oh god, no…"

Harry turned and hurried after Malfoy, catching him at the polished metal lift doors. Malfoy said nothing, simply stared at the doors until they opened. Two white-clad employees and a Muggle dressed in street clothes stepped out, leaving the lift empty. Harry and Malfoy got on.
Curtis laughed aloud, shocking Harry again. "Bloody hell, that one always impressed me. I know it's wrong that he cheated, but you have to admit it's a brilliant bit of magic." He sobered and looked at Harry. "I take it the jig is up, then? Is Draco being booted finally?"
The man had recalled that "Old Jackson" had been in charge of the dementors. Wizards who were proficient in casting a Patronus Charm were the only ones allowed on the same floors as the dementors, but "Old Jackson" had been able to control them using something he called a "Stinger". The guard had been unable to elaborate; He only remembered that "Old Jackson" had been quite proud of the spell, which he had invented himself.

He let go of Harry’s wrist and Harry crawled onto the bed, sprawling face down, as instructed. He kept hold of his wand, willing to trust Malfoy, but not to the point of stupidity. Regardless, he gasped when the first cold shackle clapped around his wrist. Malfoy pulled it to the corner of the bed and attached it to the post. He did the same to Harry’s ankles, spreading his legs apart, and finally his other wrist.
"Don't be hypocritical, Granger. You know the invite list contains those likeliest to throw their Galleons at your cause. Although I'm certain you peppered the event with enough rabble to disguise that fact."
"When do we leave?" Ron gritted, breaking the spell.
"So, I'm a messenger now."
Sunday, 14.11.2004
The knife in Harry's heart twisted. Merlin, he had seriously fucked everything up. "You know Montoya is in love with you, don't you? He isn't pretending."
"It's just the
, Harry thought.
The door swung open and a diminutive woman beamed at him through dark eyes. "Welcome, Mr Harry. Mr Draco is swimming in the pool. Come, I will take you there." She had an accent, Spanish, possibly.
“Brilliant! Then come have a drink with me. My treat.”
A bang startled them both and then Parkinson's voice carried from somewhere in the house. "I'm taking this green room!"
"What does that mean, exactly?"
"No, I want to get up early and get started. You know I've only got the one bedroom completed; if I'm to have guests they will need a place to sleep. Even Weasleys deserve the proper Malfoy hospitality. Bring them along when Granger is finished with her shopping or whatever they came to London for. In the meantime, I'll search for Father's journal."
"What's up, Harry?"
Draco laughed. "I know exactly where we are." He marched over to the unconscious Maeve and spent a bit of time modifying her memories to exclude all recollection of Draco and events following. Then he snatched up the knife and returned to Harry.
focussed on Neville. I was being encouraging."
Potter's hand left his thigh and Draco's tried not to think about how it had felt there.
Harry did not see Draco reach his destination because he threw himself forward in sudden determination. He might allow Draco to sacrifice himself, but he'd be damned if he'd let him do it alone. They crossed the glowing barrier at the same moment.
Trusting Rocco to take care of both the Muggle situation and Tim Clark, Harry gathered Malfoy into his arms and Disapparated.
"Here all alone?" Malfoy asked.
"This is where Greyback grew up, although he was never seen there after he left home. I'll mark it as low probability."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ o ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Don't be silly, Potter. You'll go back and marry the ginger--you'll go back and marry
Too bad a couple of straggler employees had been wandering the halls after hours, including Gorge McKeen.
"I have prepared missives that will be sent to the Aurors and the press." Draco did not, actually, but he did have a file that would be delivered to Harry in the event of his untimely demise. He would, however, do everything in his power to prevent the necessity of it being sent.
Harry nearly spoke aloud and barely masked the words with a hoarse cry.  He clamped his lips shut and nodded in an exaggerated fashion several times.
In that awkward fashion, they slowly crossed the room. At one point, they had to leap down onto a platform, with the first of them landing as close to the middle as possible, and then scrambling to adjust as the second person landed nearby. It was nerve-wracking and exhausting. At one point, Parkinson nearly slipped off the edge and away, but a quick dive by Ron, followed by a frantic scramble by the others to straighten the lever, caught her by one arm. He hauled her up, using muscles that might have impressed Harry had they been on anyone but Ron.
"I can come back and help, if you'd like," Harry offered.
"I was worried about the werewolves," he said. "They were traveling with vampires at the time—werewolves cannot
Lunch with Malfoy was brilliant. I'd nearly forgotten how he can make the serving staff practically lick his boots with his combination of spoilt expectation and natural charm. He certainly hadn't any of the latter in school, but maturity seems to have softened him and made him kinder, or something. He has this look in his eye that almost exudes the promise of great reward, if only you give him exactly what he wants. I've seen it work on everyone but Kingsley. It works far too well on me, I admit.
Then again, Draco grinned, that was part of the allure. He raised the camera.
"I think—can we try that later tonight?"
Greyback had included instructions regarding how and where to drop the money. He would arrange to exchange the freed prisoners for the boy after the Galleons had been received.
"Oh. Yeah, that makes sense." Potter dragged a hand through his hair, causing it to stick up on top more than usual. It made Draco think of bedhead, which led him down a merry ramble into picturing Potter in the altogether. "Sorry, I'm just tired."
Harry felt a moment of relief. Malfoy did not know about Harry's Animagus form; he was simply asking about his own falcons. "Yeah, of course."
He opened his eyes to darkness, but it wasn't complete. He turned his head and saw a black candelabra on a low table. It held six or seven flickering candles that lit an object beside it on the table. A small golden cask. Draco sat up with a sound of denial. The cask was open!
Potter took a deep breath and nodded. "Merlin, I can't believe I let him take my wand. How am I going to get that back? Assuming he hasn't snapped it or burned it or something."
"What is that?" Malfoy asked, pointing at the helmets.
Malfoy's office was tiny, but extremely neat, with one wall spelled to resemble a shaded forest lane. His desk was large and took up nearly the entire space, leaving room for only a single guest chair placed at an angle before the desk.
Greyback had a fire going and the small space was thick with smoke, despite a ventilation hole in the ceiling. Harry's eyes went to Niall, who was bound near a darkened curve of the wall. The boy coughed, looking pitiful.
"It's important, but you need some information first."
" Greyback spit-snarled his name.
He turned to see Malfoy still seated. His arms rested on the chair as though his bonds had never been freed. "Malfoy?"
Draco hurried after him. "Oh for Salazar's sake, Weasley, stop and think a moment."
"Quite right. A relic from the days when the Malfoys employed gardeners and gamekeepers, horsemen, and men-at-arms. The family was much larger then, of course. Too much work for house-elves alone."
Malfoy's bare hand rubbed slowly over Harry's throbbing arse, arousing a new level of sensation and hardening his cock even further, although he wouldn’t have thought it possible.  He knew it was leaking profusely, possibly dripping onto the seat of the chair.
"That should be ritual magic, then."
Had she staked him out for the wolves? Not that any self-respecting wolf would eat a human unless they were starving to death. If there were any wolves left in Ireland. More likely she had just left him for dead. But why?
"Isn't it obvious?" Draco had rolled his eyes.
ooOoo
and snorted at the title. That one certainly seemed like something a book-loving Ravenclaw boy would read.
"Are you saying you protected me?"
, Draco had thought.
Malfoy shrugged. "Why not?"
What had to have been more than an hour later, Draco was dragged from his cell by two different Aurors, a hard-faced woman and her burly companion. Without a word, they ushered him to the lift where they descended to level ten. Draco did not think they would have had time to convene the Wizengamot, so he was not surprised when they bypassed the ancient courtroom for a metal door some distance down the rough-hewn corridor. Inside, a single, rectangular stone table occupied the centre of the room, with a stack of files thereon, edged with several uncomfortable-looking wooden chairs. A lone chair sat to the left side of the table and a scattering lined the opposite side. Ron Weasley was stood next to one and Quentin Quartermain—the Minister's Undersecretary—waited behind another.
“Well, that settles it then, you're coming to the manor with me.” The statement seemed to fire from his lips before he could stop it, and Draco felt the burn of embarrassment sit high on his cheeks.
The entire time Draco had been sucking Harry off, Harry had been spewing a list of profanities that had no end.
Draco pulled Harry further into his side and held him as tightly as he could manage, ignoring the prick of his own tears at the corners of his eyes.
As Draco approached his childhood home, he felt as though tethers of darkness were latching onto him and pulling down. The sky was lightly spitting down and gave the cold air a foreboding that looked natural for the manor. The grounds were covered in overgrown yellow grass, and any flowers his mother had planted were nothing but crunchy piles of decomposition. The house loomed over him like his father had when he was younger, powerful, and full of hatred.
"Why did you decide to come to the Ministry? If you'd been helping me all along, why open yourself up to danger? You were nearly killed!"
Ron looked terrible, but the fact that he was awake and complaining about being hungry was a good sign. Hermione sat at his bedside, holding his hand and looking worried. "No, you cannot have battered cod and chips, only the items on your 'acceptable foods' list, as instruct—Harry!"
"Maeve. Apparently her devotion to you has not wavered."
In the nearest loo, Harry splashed water on his face and avoided his own gaze in the mirror. Bloody hell, how could he possibly be attracted to Draco sodding Malfoy?
"Do you see how the edges of the roast are crisp, dear, and the meat shows no pink on this side? That is just the way Ron prefers it, isn't it, sweetie?"
Draco moaned when Harry twisted his wrist and then sent one hand questing lower to stroke over Draco's testicles.
"I am his mother."
Draco struggled to move, but the bitch's
"Harry?" he murmured, pleased, and smiled softly.
Harry nodded.
Potter's voice cut through Draco's haze of rage. "He doesn't have your bird, Malfoy."
." The statement sounded more like the old Malfoy than anything he'd said previously and Harry gave him a sidelong stare.
"Yes, we already had a nice chat whilst I was tied up and being tortured. However, that notion seems to have backfired. I have no intention of being silenced." Draco frowned, realising that Quartermain was a useless dead end, just another tool in the large arsenal of his nebulous enemy.
"How did dementors receive their instructions?" Malfoy asked. "I'm not clear on how they communicate. The book mentions a sort of telepathy, but the description is vague."
"Perhaps," Malfoy replied with a sneer.
"Oh, you know I wouldn't, but Godric, I wish she would put a cork in it. One more word about how Ronnikins prefers this or Ronnikins prefers that and…" she shook her head. "Never mind. I'm here to calm down. Do you have any alcohol?"
Weasley shook his head. His face was so pale that his freckles stood out like blood-spatter. Some of it was blood spatter, Draco realised. Weasley was peppered with cuts and contusions. Draco glanced at the spear of wood through Weasley's leg. That needed to come out, but it would likely result in a gush of blood that could easily kill him.
Malfoy sat up stiffly and glared at him. "Fuck you, Potter. What do you know about it?"
"Very good, Mr Potter. Now, if you would be so kind as to take Ms Parkinson's place, I believe I have some unfinished business with Minister Shacklebolt."
"I had a really long day. Thank you for dinner." Draco sat down and cancelled the Warming Charm on the plate. A delicious smell wafted up and he realised that he was ravenous. He ate carefully, trying not to bolt his food like a hungry wolf.
"Oh shite, I'm sorry," Malfoy said and patted at Harry's shirt, smearing the droplets more firmly into the fabric. Harry set the glass on the counter to avoid more spillage. "Want me to suck that off for you?"
ooOoo
"Flashier? Are you trying to suggest something, Potter?"
” Harry sang, unable to stop himself. His eyes widened in horror as he realized he would have to sing the entire thing, most of the words of which he could not even recall. Dennis joined in, miserably.
"Yes. I don't trust him, and yet all of my digging has not turned up anything substantial. I suspect his recent problems with Harry might drive him out of his hole."
"Potter," Draco said even though his voice was less steady than he would have chosen, "You constantly underestimate me."
Potter relaxed a bit, visibly delving into his memories. He did not sit back, but some of the tension went out of his shoulders.
"Hush, Potter.  No more talking." Malfoy moved to Harry's other leg and bound that one to the other side, effectively strapping Harry to the chair.  A tendril of nervousness skittered through him, but beneath it was a thrilling anticipation.  His breath already came faster than normal and his heart raced.
"What about you?"
"They're mine," Draco said. "I'll be moving them to Malfoy Manor as soon as I finish the antechamber where they will be stored."
"Good plan!" Weasley's voice was in the falsetto range and Draco wondered if it was permanent. Now was not the time to bask in another's ill fortune, however, especially if the greenish mist creeping towards them was any indication.
"What is it?" Draco asked.
"Yes, sir. As you wish, sir." Maeve Disapparated.
. It's what he does, Harry. Not even your magical prowess could have stopped him."
Draco patted his full stomach and stretched out on the bed. It was hellishly uncomfortable, but he'd slept on worse. He hadn't lied about the breakfast, either. The crumpets had been delicious and the tea had been strong and hot. Draco wondered if the quality would have remained the same if the cook had known it had been destined for a Malfoy. He wrinkled his nose. They probably would have slipped poison into it, or at least an explosive laxative.
Harry stepped into the kitchen just as Parkinson wailed the latter. "I'm Mark." He pushed a hand through his hair and winked at Draco, who seemed to be ignoring her in favour of making tea.
"No monogrammed stitching? No tag that reads 'Property of Draco Malfoy, Slytherin Sex God?'" Harry prodded.
Draco had quite forgotten he was holding his wand, even though it was currently digging rather painfully into the flesh of his hand and crushing one of his ribs. He had forgotten everything except the feel of Harry Potter's breath on his neck and the sound of his smoldering voice saying the most insane things…
Shutters dropped over Draco's eyes, quick as a door slamming.
"What
. The stupid blood lust was only magnifying it.
Harry flushed but forged on gamely. "I'm trying to protect Ron and Hermione, of course. I know you are only trifling with them, but
Harry did not see Malfoy over the weekend, but he certainly thought about him. He kept replaying the scene in the Ministry toilet over and over in his mind until it acquired an almost mythic quality. He let his fantasies play out in his daydreams, thinking of Malfoy walking into the stall and shoving him up against the wall to press a hard kiss upon his lips.
Malfoy sobered. "I'll get back to you on that. This little display was most likely to get my attention. He wants something from me, so I will meet with him and find out what it is."
"And I've been thinking that you should also start working on Malfoy Manor. Bring it back to what it once was. Before the war. I can help you."
"You're damned distracting!" Draco burst out and Harry's eyes grew even wider before he grinned. Hermione returned at that moment and sighed.
"Oh, don't give me that. Fenrir is back in Azkaban, Ralston Rosier is locked up, and Virgil Crabbe is dead. I have done your administration more favours in the past month than you can ever repay."
were, but I vowed to learn. I promised on the remains of everything I loved that I would hunt them all down and make them pay."
“This looks like a good place to escape to.” Harry’s gaze swept over the rooftops, beautiful and somewhat quaint in the bright afternoon sunlight. It was brutally warm in the city, but the café sat on a hillside and enjoyed the benefit of a light breeze.
to be saved, Harry Potter couldn't fucking resist. "You sneaky bastard, I knew you should have been sorted into Slytherin." Draco's voice was a light whisper, but he sought frantically for something to assist. Damn it, he did not even have his wand!
Draco's hand flitted down Harry's spine to the crack of his arse and back up. Again. And again. Slowly.
Eddie had been surprisingly understanding, despite Harry telling him next to nothing. "They need me to help with something, I'm not back on active duty," Harry had insisted upon arriving home. He'd stopped off for take-away curry.
"You have changed," Harry admitted, "but that is not helping me with Eddie."
"You're not going to rush back and make up with Carmichael?"
They sat in a tiny Muggle used bookshop that contained a number of small nooks with cosy chairs and wooden tables for reading. The place served coffee and pastries. Draco loved the atmosphere, even if the cappuccino was a bit watered down for his taste.
Draco tried to gather his scattered wits. He tsked. "Fired? Is that all? No time in Azkaban? What has the Ministry come to?"
message. He spent the night with Fred and George at the shop."
"Does this look familiar?" Harry asked.
Anders sat up straight at the mention of the Unspeakables. Anders had a well-known running feud with Charlemagne Croaker, the head of the Department of Mysteries. "Unspeakables? Certainly not! This is an Auror matter and we do not require input from the bloody Department of Mysteries!"
"Open up, Malfoy," Weasley said.
"I like that one!" Teddy said.
Draco caught sight of Ginny Weasley clinging to the Korean Seeker and laughing in apparent delight. "That doesn't bother you?"
They stopped spinning in an open field with rain pouring down on them. A tumble-down barn fashioned of greying wood and overgrown with ivy stood nearby. Crabbe ushered them towards it.
When the door shut behind them all, Harry schooled his features into an impassive mask as a hated voice said, "Here we are.  I suppose we should all get comfortable.  Potter, you wait right there."
Malfoy directly behind Harry and his voice was low, close enough to Harry's ear that his hot breath steamed the side of his neck.
Draco watched until the door closed behind Potter, and then he went back to studying the photo. Of all those taken during the session, only Potter had broken the boundaries of Draco's mundane instruction. The photo was brilliant--an expanse of blue broken with the crosspieces of the window-frame, with just the right amount of perspective added by the fruit bowl to give it an ethereal quality. The focus was on the window, rather than the bowl, making the viewer long to see what lay beyond the glass. Of course the only decent photo of the lot had been taken by Potter.
"Damn straight, you do," Nottingham muttered.
Harry nodded, thinking it rather was. A Slytherin boy walked past him and sang in a low voice, “
"He raises alpacas, or some such thing. He's turned into a bloody hermit since Vince… well…" Draco's voice trailed off. Fuck, it shouldn't still hurt after so many years, and Vince had turned into a right bastard at the end, before he'd nearly killed them all with that damned fire. Potter's hand touched his arm for a moment, and Draco met the green eyes, surprised at the sympathy he found there. Goddamn Potter. Maybe all this dredging up of emotion was not a good thing, after all.

"Correction—I won't talk about it to
"What is the matter?"
If Hermione had any idea I was using this journal to try and put my thoughts in order, she would likely be ecstatic. Right now my mind is whirling. At the meeting yesterday evening I learnt that there were several British businessmen contributing to the poaching and illegal potion ingredients operations, mainly by investing heavily in the controlling corporation. Of course it isn't owned by a single person, as that would be too easy. These wizards seem to have studied Muggle criminology, because it's a convoluted mess just trying to determine who is involved. And once involved whether or not they have criminal aspirations. Purchasing shares in a company does not make one a suspect unless one is specifically aware that the company is a shell for illegal activity. How many of the investors are clueless? Of course it gets worse. One of the names that turned up is
The four of them walked through space and Harry tried to focus on Draco's shoulders rather than gawking at the visual display around them. It was as though they stood in a remote location with nothing to block their view of the night sky. The sheer number of stars was mind-boggling, and threatened to reduce all of his problems to the insignificance of a speck of dust.
"What's the plan, Potter? Do you think Draco is in there?"
"I suppose one them is you?"
The rest of the afternoon passed in near-absolute silence. Harry sat at his desk and drew doodles on parchment, trying not to think about dying alone and friendless. Draco said nothing and merely returned to his journal, but the scratching of his quill had long pauses between and he frequently brushed the feathered end against his mouth with a soft
Hermione must have been watching from a window, for the instant they touched down on the road before the house, she bolted outside and threw herself on Harry. Her eyes slid sidelong to Draco. While he did not see the expected animosity reflected in her brown eyes, he did not see a friendly welcome, either. She looked much the same as she had at Hogwarts, though a bit taller.
, either. I'm a good Auror and I plan to stay that way."
"I have a headache," Draco announced breezily to Crabbe and Goyle as he placed Harry back on his shoulder. "I'm going to go lie down. Don't look for me in class."
He cast the same spell and this time applied it to himself before bending his knees slightly. Keeping his left hand firmly on Harry's cock, Draco thrust himself gently into Harry from behind, delighting in the shudder of pleasure that rocked Hary's frame.
Flint paused, looking uncertain, but then he shrugged and started out.
"What is that, then?" Harry asked.
"Come on. It's tasty. Very expensive, of course. Imported from Sweden."
!" Tim yelled and the Wisp popped back into the bottle. Tim shoved the cap in with a flourish.
"But?"
He wondered suddenly where Harry was and sighed, knowing Ireland was a bloody long flight from London. Draco likely would not see him until morning. Draco considered bolting, but at that moment Maeve returned from another room, carrying a tray laden with food.
"Draco, I—" Potter started, but the words turned into a strangled sort of gurgle when Draco mouthed the head of his cock through the material of his briefs. Draco felt a rush of pure pleasure.
Harry sat up and noticed that Hermione also looked languid and content. She smiled dreamily.
"Go home?" Draco suggested. "It's a long flight, you know."
Potter groaned. "If I move, I'll come."
Malfoy looked at him, obviously surprised at the question, which Harry hadn’t meant to blurt aloud. “I don’t know, Potter. Do I seem bored?”
"Six!" hit the same spot, even harder, and Harry bit his lip against a gasp.  It felt almost...
"I looked for you for weeks," Harry said suddenly, staring fixedly into the flames and poking at the embers with a stick. "Tonks tried to help, but it was getting close to her time." His voice was heavy with recrimination. Draco had missed the birth of his own cousin's child—another tick mark on the long list of his transgressions. "She asked her Auror friends for help."
Harry allowed a lascivious smile to curve his lips and he winked suggestively at Tanner as he said, "
"I want to know—" Draco started and then the door opened.
"I've gone mad because of Harry Potter," he muttered. "That should be reason enough for any man."
"I'm not trying to be amusing. I'm serious," Harry said around Draco's kisses, which could not have been easy because Draco was starting to warm to the action.
Tim actually rounded the desk and clapped Malfoy on the shoulder as the others laughed. Several passers-by paused to stare inside curiously. Brady invited them in for a drink and soon Malfoy's tiny office was full to bursting with well-wishers. Most of them had doubtless been drawn in by the promise of alcohol, but at least it was a start.
Harry thought it unlikely, but he frowned at Draco's words. "Wait. Someone hired Crabbe? I thought he was working on his own!"
Hermione's words caused Harry's head to snap up. He stared at her. "What does that mean?"
He handed it to Niall. "Here, I kept her safe for you."
had sent Harry into a rage of cleaning; he had tackled one of the seldom-used bedrooms of Grimmauld Place, Vanishing dust and mouldering fabric with snarled spells as he tried to Vanish the headlines from his own mind.
"Draco Malfoy!" one yelled over the din. "You are under arrest for… well, for a huge assortment of crimes. Fraud, burglary, attempted murder, coercion, bribery—"
Draco lifted himself onto his elbows so quickly that he nearly cracked Harry on the forehead. A thunderous scowl darkened his brow. Harry leant back, surprised. "If you don't mind, I would prefer to touch
"Um… do you mind if I come in? It's a bit cold and I wouldn't want…" he gestured towards the infant.
"Hermione!" he yelled.
*^^*^^*
"Granger, apparently your husband has whisked Draco away to some mysterious safe place and he strongly suggests that Pansy and I hide out for the duration. And by that, of course, he means that we should locate him as quickly as possible because the incompetence of the Ministry knows no bounds, and he would be safer walking the streets of Diagon Alley in our company than locked up in some hideaway. I'm hoping you can help us locate him before Crabbe does. He is not to be taken lightly."
Ginny moved closer and put her arm around his waist. "Hey! You're right. It's not fair of me to poke fun. I know you've been trying." She leaned even closer and spoke in a low tone that only he could hear. "I do sort of like Michael, though. I wanted to see if you were going to get jealous if I spent some time with him. And, well, you obviously aren't."
a freak. The only noticeable difference was that people gave him a wider berth. They still gawked, of course, at the scar, but now they also stared at his teeth.
"He tried to seduce Hermione," Ron explained to the twins.
Harry shook his head adamantly.
Saturday, 25.12.2004
"Is this some new vampire kink you've acquired?" Malfoy asked, but his voice was ragged and breathy, and the sarcastic tone was not quite as potent as usual. Harry felt Malfoy's chest hitch as his lips slid over his throat, carrying his tongue on a wet path over the jugular… the vessel containing Harry's worst need… Harry felt the edges of his control slipping away.
Harry grinned. The game was on.
"What? What do you mean 'have fun'? I'm not going to Azkaban alone!"
Potter's palm was on Draco's thigh, so near to Draco's hard cock that he wanted nothing more than to press Potter's fingers there and rut against him, uncaring of anyone that might walk past.
"Merlin, you kiss like the very devil," Potter said as his free hand trailed over Draco's back.
Harry chuckled and hoisted himself out of Draco's bed. He reluctantly left the bedroom and went downstairs to find Ron and Hermione in a prime fighting stance at the foot of the stairs. Hermione's fists were clenched and her cheeks were red. Ron was shouting at her.
"I hate when you do that."
married?"
He popped back into the kitchen and placed the paper sack on the table. "Eddie?"
"Well, this might throw a gnat's wing into your potion. My target is a Weasley."
"We nicked it from the Ministry when they shorted us on a payment."
"Shall we see if Maeve is still where you left her?" Harry's voice was slightly disapproving. God forbid Draco leave the evil, murderous witch lying on the ground in the rain. He sighed.
Draco's eyes narrowed. "How do you know all that?"
It took Harry a moment to figure out that Malfoy was referring to the Sword of Gryffindor, which Neville had used to destroy Voldemort’s snake. It was difficult to think at all with Malfoy sucking on his neck in such a pleasant fashion.
There was more mingling and a small cluster of bigoted, like-minded souls attached themselves to Rosier and spoke bitterly about the good old days. They spoke quietly, however, because it was obvious to anyone with political ambition that opposing this particular measure would not be a wise idea, as the Minister for Magic and most of the Department Heads of the Ministry were on board. Draco had little doubt that the Wizengamot would bow to public pressure and allow it to pass. Everyone present knew it as well, and dared not engage in arguments at social functions.
"Have you ever heard of Excrutiatus Elixer, Draco?"
ooOoo
"Get on with what things?"
"It wasn't quite what you think."
Draco agreed. "She'll claim it was an accident and concoct some ridiculous reason for us all to be in here. At the moment, she's in with us, so she needs to get out. She knows we won't leave without Granger."
Tim groaned. "More? But we've got the spell down now."
Harry laughed. "That would be the whole place, wouldn't it?"
He slipped through the throng, no longer headed for the door. He disposed of his untouched wineglass on the way. Drinking wine was pointless, so it had only been for show. Malfoy moved, his eyes searching for someone, missing Harry completely. He walked with his usual arrogant stride, ignoring everyone he passed but for a cursory nod to those that greeted him. Harry caught him when he passed a darkened hallway. Caught him and dragged him into the dark.
lube!" Draco might have been impressed with Potter's wandless magic if he hadn't been so glad to see the small bottle in his hand.
"Good," Sarah muttered to Potter, who snorted a laugh. Draco might have liked the chit if she wasn't always half-hanging over Potter.
"Why the doubts, Potter?  Everyone has always known you would marry and join the ranks of the Weasleys. Or have you met someone else?"
Curtis put out a quick hand. "Now, Raina, you just stay there and rest."
"Are we leaving?" Draco asked.
"Of course I know Cho. Surely I've mentioned it before."
"I'm not here to talk about your meals. Kingsley said you got a message last night, but they can't read it and you won't talk about it."
"Yeah. You probably need to think about what to ask for in return."
," Harry said.
That was because Draco had located and paid off everyone with access to that knowledge, or at least all of the ones who would have sold the information. "Which parts? Even I can't get the Department of Mysteries." That was also a blatant lie. Draco prided himself on his fibbing skills.
Harry stared at Draco, wondering what could have possessed him to say such a thing. Harry was angry, yes, probably more enraged than he had ever been in his life, but he certainly did not want Draco gone forever. It had been bad enough with him gone for six long, agonizing months. It was all he could do to stay in his seat and not reach across to drag Draco into a kiss, willing or not.
His come spattered the bed, what little there was of it, since he had climaxed down Malfoy’s throat earlier, and electric shudders seemed to go on and on. Malfoy sagged over his back, feeling warm and solid against him. Despite the glorious feeling, Harry’s arms and legs trembled with exertion. He sprawled forward in a limp heap, Malfoy atop him, with his hot breath panting against the back of Harry’s neck.
"Draco! Bloody hell, we've been worried sick about you! Why didn't you let us know where you'd gone? I was half-terrified someone else had killed Crabbe and taken you, although Parkinson was dead certain you had gone off on your own."
"Didn't think you'd stop," Draco breathed, becoming extremely aware of Potter's hard body beneath his.
Potter didn't reject the notion outright, and his white teeth worried his lower lip for a minute as he considered it. Draco wanted to crawl onto the bed and help him with the lip gnawing, although one would think he'd had enough of kissing in the past hour. (He hadn't.)
Draco whispered in Harry's ear.
Malfoy's lips were pliant and soft, and just as unmoving as Harry's had been during their prior kiss. Harry pulled away and met his eyes again. "Why did you kiss me last night?"
"It's no bother," Harry said and admired Teddy's hippogriff, which had several more eyes than necessary and fangs sprouting from its beak.
"Time for bed," Draco suggested pleasantly. "'Night, Granger." He ushered Harry into the tent without a backward glance and practically dragged Harry into their room.
"Ow. I didn't know you were a biter."
He waited, but Harry seemed to have lost his words. "You what, Potter?"
"Perhaps you are simply a prat!"
"Unmade?" Tim asked again.
"Maeve, I have a small job for you." Draco gestured to her.
Draco preened. "I know."
"Since when do you
"Not playing," Harry replied and kissed him again.
"Apparently you haven't cornered the market, yet."
Harry pushed away with effort and paused for a moment to enjoy the sight of Draco Malfoy looking thoroughly dishevelled—hair a mess, lips red, eyes half-lidded, shirt open…and trousers bulging attractively in a way that demanded unwrapping. Harry reached for the fancy, old-fashioned silken lacing on the trousers Draco wore.
"Don't you look like the very
Draco avoided Harry's gaze, knowing to look at him with
"What do you mean? Of course I arrived with—"
Draco banged into his office on Friday in a black mood. He had spent most of Thursday at the Manor catching up on accounts, paying bills, stocking the larder, and dealing with the endless house-elf complaints. At an ungodly hour of the morning, he had finally sought his bed and the much-desired peace of a good sleep, only to be haunted with visions of messy black hair, green eyes, and a body to
Harry landed on the roof and trotted forwards in time to see Draco casting a Sleeping Charm on the kids. Memory Charms were next; they had all been brushing up on them recently, since the case had put them in contact with a large number of Muggles. Harry doubted Draco needed any help Obliviating a couple of small children, but it wouldn't hurt to—
She expected to find Harry and Draco at the site of the spell, but they were nowhere to be found. She waited for a short time to see if there were any visible effects on the nullification field, but nothing appeared out of the ordinary. She cast a flying spell at a nearby stick and sent it across the field, but it dropped a few feet away.
"I hear you are working with Draco."
"Perhaps, because—" Draco's words were cut off by Harry's kiss. He chuckled at having found an effective way to shut him up. It turned into something of a game when Draco continued to try to speak. Harry couldn't contain his laughter and the resulting jumble of unintelligible sounds soon had them both giggling like idiots.
"They need to make chocolate flavour." Harry's lips tickled Draco's neck when he spoke and Draco shivered. He twisted a hand in Harry's hair and pulled his head back to expose his lips for a kiss. He sucked on Harry's mouth until he felt Harry's breathing change to something less languid.
"Yeah, fine. I guess we're done for the day, then?"
Draco licked a stripe from Potter’s balls up to his anus and then circled Potter’s hole with his tongue several times.  Draco was rather shocked at him own behaviour—he had never done anything like this before, with anyone, but he could not seem to stop himself.
"Thanks for breakfast, Potter. I'm managing to keep it down, so far."
"Un. Un… wha—?" The power of speak having apparently deserted him once more, Harry could only stare as Draco sank to his knees.
Harry kept reading, cringing at times at the painful, angst-ridden words of a child desperate for friendship. Harry gnawed his lip until he tasted blood and then he pushed the journal aside, knowing he was becoming too invested. Syed's past was not his own, despite the fact that many of the words could have been written by him as a ten-year-old, crying silently under the stairs in his cupboard.
Malfoy heaved a sigh and frowned as he raised his arms and began to massage his wrists. The white shirt he wore had loose cuffs and as they slid back, Harry could see the merest edge of Malfoy's Dark Mark before Malfoy stretched his arms apart and rotated his shoulders. "Merlin, that feels better. Now I could use a glass of wine and a visit to the loo. I don't suppose you lot plan ahead for things like that?"
"Um. The beginner." He handed back the pamphlet.
Most likely he would be so beset with lust for Maeve that whatever he felt for Harry would eventually be overshadowed and finally forgotten. Draco wished he could close his eyes. He hoped to hell she had not attuned the potion, although it wouldn't matter with her staring into his eyes the way she was now.
"I'll bet it's a ghost!" Paul said in a hushed tone. He hunched his shoulders and formed his fingers into claws. "Or a…demon."
"Head hurts," Draco muttered, and Potter nodded. He Summoned a vial from a nearby table and uncorked it.
"An updated internal map of the Ministry. They made some changes in the past six months and I haven't found anyone willing to divulge the new layout."
. Or perhaps he simply wanted Hermione to fall in love with him, regardless of the consequences.
"I said good night in a perfectly pleasant manner. What was rude about it?" Draco asked and kicked the door shut behind them.
