?” he said skeptically. He snorted. “I think my mum has that book, Harry.”
“With proper gear this time,” Harry said, taking Draco’s hand.
I wonder how Slam would go with an exploding snap card deck?
you fit just right.”
“Well you went to all this trouble. Cleaned it, prepped yourself, yes? Go ahead.” His chin lifted a fraction. “See how you like it.”
--------
“Where to next?” Draco asked.
“Damn it!” Draco cursed, scrubbing his hair and turning once more to the baby. “He’s a McNair. Both his father and his aunt were allergic to mandrakes. I’d bet he is too.” His fingers landed on the sheets, just outside the boundary of spells. “It’s okay, baby, we’ll take you home soon.”
“Mm.” Draco ran a finger up the length of silicone, almost exactly as Harry had done. “You know, you’re not meant to share these sorts of toys…”
Fuck, Pansy was going to kill him! Draco wiped his mouth automatically. “It’s fine. Just a little—” his eyes swept the shelf of sweets, “leftover acid pop. Blue raspberry. Tasted like shit and I spat it out.” His words came too quickly to be normal. The potion couldn’t be wearing off already, could it?
She bounced the baby, smoothing a hand over his fuzzy head. “I don’t know whether to be relieved or offended that we weren’t as well.”
“No good,” Draco said. “Harry lives in a house. I almost hit him with my bike?”
.” Harry wiggled his fingers in jazz hands at the pun, making Draco roll his eyes with a laugh.
A six minute walk turned into a thirteen minute walk with the pace the children set, but they all had a wonderful time gawking at the city buildings and the streams of muggles that they passed. Draco heard several happy oohs and aahs over their “adorable holiday club outing”. So much better than the hisses and glares they might expect from magical onlookers that would recognise them.
Draco had two or three inches of height on Harry, and all of that must be in his legs because the dildo was stuck to the wall just a little too high to be easy to reach. Harry stood on his tiptoes to line himself up and was just about to lower himself onto it when the door opened.
“You are so clever.” Harry kissed him again, more soundly this time. And his hand landed on Draco’s thigh with a soft squeeze.
“Does it have to be over our bed?” Draco stepped into the shower with a sigh as the warm water hit his skin.
Draco rolled his eyes and yelled over his shoulder, “You can finish Annie’s!” Greg scrunched up his face and Draco sighed. He shook his head at the woman behind the counter. “Better make that twelve or I’ll never hear the end of it.”
(7:38 pm) Don’t spend the whole night panicking. It’s fine.
“More like having a good time the
“No, Little Bit, it’s fine.” And
And then Potter pulling Draco down next to him so their knees bumped for a game of gobstones with Daria and Libby.
“Me too.”
“Oh! “ Ron exclaimed, slamming the table. “Remember that time the voice actor got laryngitis and they had to hire someone new at the last minute to re-record
“I’m sorry I asked,” Dev says, getting to his feet.
Draco’s eyes widened and, chastity charms be damned, he started beating on Harry’s chest. “You absolute fucking lunatic! What if I missed?!”
Draco could have cried to find them both intact. Jane’s dose had been just right, and she happily chirped about sleeping peacefully in the blankets Draco left for her. Robbie had no injuries, but had a hard time staying awake. He, perhaps, needed a smaller dose for next month. Draco and Jane stayed with him until he was alert enough to eat breakfast.
, I tell myself as I sit right next to him on the sofa and set the bowl of popcorn on both our thighs. “You don’t mind sharing, right?”
When Draco tried to peel Annie off him, she started crying and grasping his t-shirt in her tiny fists. “Don’t let him take me! I wanna stay with you!”
As he gathered his materials back into his battered briefcase, Mr Whitehead casually asked, “What will you do if your application for fostering is rejected, Mr Malfoy?”
The Ministry didn’t want them.
“Slow down before you choke on it,” Draco said, serving up his own plate. “I’m not going to bolt down my lunch like that so you may as well take your time.”
(10:45 pm) Oops I’m so sorry. Wrong number.
“Okay. Sounds sort of like you.”
He barely nodded in Weasley’s direction before frowning at Draco. “You look like shit. What’s happened?”
He texted back,
“We’re not dating,” Blaise said, with Neville grinning at his side. “We’re just friends who hang out sometimes.”
Tyrannus Basilton Grimm-Pitch has a fucking
“Fair trade. You’re a gem!” He hurried to his office to get his bag and floo home.
“I didn’t
The air in front of him rippled and his blasted husband appeared, smiling and dishevelled, from underneath his Invisibility Cloak.
Draco brought his knee up to cradle Harry between his thighs. “Do you think anyone else could fuck me like you do? You have to know you’ve ruined me for anyone else.”
His whole body lit up with excitement when he heard Draco coming in the door. “You’re home!” Harry said happily as he exited the kitchen. And then he had to laugh.
How could he have forgotten about the fiendfyre? Draco had nearly lost his life that day. Of course flying would bring back terrible memories. Although he thought he remembered Draco flying last autumn before the weather got too cold for it. Or maybe his memory was faulty, as he hadn’t taken to paying such close attention to Draco at that point.
With a grin and a huge flourish, Harry signed his name at the bottom of the contract. “It means we’re free.”
“Thank you,” Draco said politely. “Really, thank you. We appreciate all your help. He might have died if the Wilsons had been slower about bringing him.”
“You can do that from afar.”
“It’s okay, love,” Draco said softly, pulling Harry in for a hug. He trailed kisses over his lips and cheeks and nuzzled his hair. He whispered, “Tell me what you want.”
,” Ron said, grinning at Harry’s bewilderment. He turned to Hermione. “Hey babe—”
“What’s his name?”
“Mr Malfoy,” Ms Coddle sighed, “I admire what you’re doing. I really do. But a baby… This is best for everyone.”
Draco got off for time served.
“Shit, I think we left it in the kitchen.”
“Yeah it’s…” Potter waved his hand absently. “It’s a whole stupid thing. Never mind. The point is… These kids… they’re lucky to have you. Lucky to have this place to call home.”
that kept drawing us together is over. Fresh eyes on the situation really helped.” As frequently happened in new situations, he thought of Molly. “This would make a good Molly story.”
He giggled to himself and smoothed down his wrinkled robes. Perfect. He took a pinch of floo powder—hmm… better purchase that as well—and rolled through to Diagon Alley. The Calming Draught immediately served its purpose when it made Draco nod politely at a young witch that came through the floo before him. No panic today!
return? Would they even be in a fit state to take their children back? Did they have homes or incomes to return to?
Intrigued now, Draco turned on the sofa to face Harry more fully. He took Harry’s hands and closed his eyes to quiet his own thoughts. He blinked his eyes open and smiled at Harry. “I’m ready when you are.”
Harry came hurrying in. “Sorry, I was going to warn you at dinner since I promised no more surprises. Today’s kinky thing is sex with a mirror. Ta-da!” Harry opened his eyes and mouth wide and for some reason made jazz hands as well. “I enlarged the mirror from the little bathroom and put it up temporarily. I thought the ceiling would be best.”
“Everyone has a name.”
Harry routinely wrapped himself in his Invisibility Cloak, snuck down to Malfoy’s office in Magical Law, and napped while Malfoy enjoyed his weekly lunch date with Pansy Longbottom. With Harry’s whereabouts unknown, he could get a peaceful rest to fortify him until the weekend.
And he didn’t stop. Not when Harry traced his inner thighs again. And when he ran a finger up Draco’s length. Not when Harry laid his head on Draco’s thigh, although he seemed to have trouble drawing in an even breath. Each sour note and tiny screech of the bow only made Harry more bold as Draco struggled to continue on under the sweet torture of light caresses and tiny kisses across his tender skin.
“This thing I paid real money for? Not likely.” Harry flicked his wand and soft whale sounds echoed through the bathroom from his mobile resting on the counter. He dug in the cupboard under the sink for the waterproof lube Draco mixed for them. “It was in the toy box.”
And the entire time, she silently begged for more.
His newfound joy brought with it an inner calm. It didn’t matter what the
“Oh come on, forty-one isn’t too old! And I think it’ll be fun. Do you want to see the list?” He pulled a folded parchment from his pocket and offered it to Draco.
The simple phrase launches me back over the years before the delicious weight of him on my tongue became comfortably familiar. I struggle to recall the sweet innocence we both shared once upon a time.
The hot rush of his blood only got worse when Malfoy stepped closer and rested his hand on Ron’s arm. Squeezing lightly he asked, “Are you feeling all right? This is a lot to deal with.”
“Mr Malfoy!” Ms Coddle called, chasing after him. “Mr Malfoy, I really am sorry. These evaluations are necessary, I promise. It wasn’t a ruse to distract you. But you have to admit we’re in a difficult place, given the ages of your board members. If you had an adult—”
“If we can prove we’re fit to care for the kids, I’m sure they’ll let them stay,” Draco said, although his brain screamed this was in no way true.
After cleaning them up, he tucked himself into Draco’s side, draping an arm over his waist. Draco’s hand idly caressed Harry’s back, and into his hair. Harry closed his eyes and soaked in the soft intimacy of it all.
“It’s okay, love, we’ll be all right.” He could hardly stand her arms around him, pressing against the filthy, reeking mass of him. But she didn’t seem to care. He ran a hand down her back and held her as tightly as his weak arms would allow.
--------
Draco shook his head vigorously and all the flowers stayed in place. “I don’t mind.” He called a broom up. “It means I can fly
“Mr Malfoy, the Ministry isn’t asking for much here. We’re just interested in why the children of so many Death Eaters are gathering in one place.
“I wonder what they’re asking her,” Potter said, making a silly face at the baby in his lap. “We didn’t exactly have time to explain everything properly.”
“Holy shit,” Harry whispered as Benedict decided he’d had enough of her sass and a picnic by the lake needed fewer clothes. Maybe he should move to his room for this part, instead of his favourite chair by the common room fire.
Hope began to warm Harry from his very core. Fucking
Harry’s body reacted to the hug in the way Ron expected—with a familiar warmth that Ron felt when he hugged George or Bill. With one more hearty slap, he stepped away and returned to his own boring room. And couldn’t resist making a silly face or two in the mirror.
“What’re they doing here?” Greg asked. Roger climbed into Greg’s abandoned chair to hide, peeking between Greg and Jason to get a look at the group.
“I believe we do.” Blaise stepped closer to Neville. “Now if you don’t mind, I was promised fun of a different sort that doesn’t involve you.”
“Yes.” Draco picked at a piece of lint on his trousers. Harry wanted to kiss away the frown lines on his brow, but friends didn’t kiss away each others’ worries.
Ron scoffed, “Like we don’t see each other all the time.” He leaned into Draco, pleading his case. “I was up until almost two in the morning listening for the
“Merlin, Harry, your fucking
“Fifteen more days!” Ron beamed. “Then I’m marrying the
Pansy laughed loudly enough to draw several eyes. “More than! Draco would
A wrinkled little Elf appeared with grey tufts of hair growing from his ears and a wrinkled blue tea towel wrapped around his waist. He immediately squeaked, pulling his ears down to hide behind. “Master Davie! What is you doing here? Mistress is being upset with you!”
A fucking
,” he said and a duplicate page appeared on top of the first. “Here you go.”
Ms Coddle pointed to the line of trunks. “What is all this?”
Draco walked through the eighth year common room as quietly as he could. The New Year’s Eve party carried on into the wee hours of the morning and he didn’t want to wake anyone still sleeping on sofas, armchairs, and even the rug in front of the banked fire.
“This
“What we need,” Draco said, “is a House Elf.” The Manor’s two remaining elves had been seized by the Ministry for ‘testimony’ and then never returned. They didn’t come when Draco called so he could only assume they were dead or their enchantment had somehow been lifted. Maybe his father had freed them as an act of goodwill?
They didn’t want to question her too hard on whatever memories the school room dredged up, and decided on a different approach all together. Daphne talked to Daria about her favourite places in Malfoy Manor, and together they created a special reading corner just for her. A nest of blankets, fluffy pillows, and cushions by large windows streaming with early morning light gave Daria a quiet, safe place to read, write, draw, and learn with Daphne while Theo, Pansy, and Draco supervised the others.
“Ease up,” Ron said, “they’re just characters. Speaking of weddings, you told me to remind you about your shoes,” he said to Harry. “Did you get that sole repaired or are you going to get a new pair?”
“I guess yesterday, talking about threesomes and then there was that guy at the club hitting on you… It made me remember. Before, when we first started dating. And I… I think I’m worried I’ve grown complacent.”
Everyone in the yard froze when they saw Trainee Harry Potter standing awkwardly behind Pansy, looking at Draco as though he’d never seen him before. Annie buried her face in Draco’s neck. “Is he gonna take me?”
--------
“I have homework…” Draco said hesitantly, but Harry made a face at that.
“I believe they went to the hospital? They had a baby with them, crying something awful! And a red rash all over. It was oh… an hour ago?”
Potter pulled up a chair, licking at his own mint chocolate chip cone.
When Draco called Jason and Bryce, he heard a whimpering from the Littles. Elyon whispered to Daphne, then ran over to give Bryce one more hug. He didn’t know which brother would take the parting hardest, Bryce or Elyon.
“What if the merpeople see us?” Harry asked as he slid slowly, carefully into Draco’s delicious heat, both of them braced against the glass wall holding back the Black Lake.
“I’ll bring takeaway for dinner.”
“Unbelievable,” Draco whispered. The boys crowded around, helping Draco to line them up on the attic floor.
Harry leaned into Draco and gave him a sloppy kiss. “I may have had a little more than two.”
Harry adjusted his half-hard cock, then scooped up his wand to glamour himself. “I’m sorry about yesterday. For surprising you and not considering Claudia or Gregory.”
“What are you supposed to be?” Draco asked, laughter laced through his words.
Harry laughed. “Come in and we can talk about it over tea.”
at it.” Behind her, Draco shook his head theatrically. “So is Draco. He’s dead clever. It’ll all be fine.” She plucked their two beers from the bar, leaving Draco to pay.
“Well… yes and no,” Draco hedged. “It’s good for them. For the family name. If Harry Potter courts me. Even if there’s no betrothal.”
“Fuck this lonely shit,” Harry said to the empty flat.
“I’m working on it,” Draco said decisively.
“Congratulations,” Andromeda said, kissing him lightly on the cheek. “Your mother would be proud of you.”
(6:11 pm) #8. You’ll be a fan too by the time the night is out.
“Okay, great. The private rooms are one galleon per person per hour. Will you be renting any equipment or props?” At Draco’s head shake he continued, “All right. There’s a clock on the wall that counts down your hour. If you are more than five minutes over, it’ll automatically charge you for another full hour. And there’s a ten galleon cleaning deposit. It’s returned to you if the room is left as clean as you found it.”
Ginny. She had a great sense of humour and spirit of adventure. Adventure that extended straight through to the bedroom. It was undoubtedly the sex that drew Harry back time and again.
(10:35 am) Was I really so distracting?
“Granger was with us.”
And there was Harry, taking his hand and pulling him in for a twirling dance, making the robes flare out to let the silver embroidery catch the light. They shared champagne and laughing kisses. He remembered Harry’s hand around his waist as they talked with friends and shared a plate of hors d'oeuvres.
My fingers slide into copper curls to yank his head back. I hiss in his ear, "Do you trust me, Snow?"
Harry huffed a laugh into Draco’s neck and then came with a soft groan of his own. “Yes, fuck, that’s so good…” He slumped against Draco for a moment. “We should add fucking in my workshop to this game. But it doesn’t have the same appeal since it’s just in the back garden and no one is around to almost catch us.”
Seeing Draco in his formal robes made Harry’s heart flutter. Damn, his boyfriend was gorgeous! He loved seeing Draco so posh and put together, knowing what his sleepy morning face looked like with his hair sticking up everywhere. Hopefully in a few weeks, he could have that all the time. Courtship sucked, even if he couldn’t say so out loud. He didn’t need any more ‘I told you so’s.’
“They wouldn’t let me court you if they already know they’re not going to allow a betrothal, right?” Harry argued on Saturday, when they had a moment alone. Truly alone—they’d promised Theo to behave if he gave them this one evening free of chaperoning. “Isn’t the point of courting to see if we get on enough for a betrothal?”
“Like two strawberries ready for plucking. Mm, delicious and beautiful.” Harry bit one cheek playfully. “But probably no one will say anything.”
“Good idea.” Draco kissed the top of Harry’s head, and then gathered his things for work.
The tiny reminder of the war, the families they’d lost, and their reason for gathering in the first place made the happy glow evaporate. Everyone shuffled awkwardly in place and goodbye began in earnest. Potter promised to return soon, and then let Draco lead him to the floo.
Draco pouted and shoved his husband. “That’s a terrible start to this story.”
Unfortunately, everything else on his lists needed to be purchased in the magical world. Inkpots and quill cases. Magical books and parchments. Dragonhide gloves and cauldrons.
And then she swept out the door as Harry choked on his own tongue. Bloody fucking hell, Draco would
“Good. That’s the goal.” Harry gave Draco an appraising look. “You look fantastic. I’m so glad I kept this and that it still fits.”
It wasn’t until he landed in Diagon Alley that he realised he still wore his muggle jeans and t-shirt. People gave him odd stares but he ignored it as best he could on his way to Quality Quidditch Supplies.
Harry shrugged and let Ron cast, since there wasn’t a muggle in sight. “Perfect, thank you!” Harry rubbed his hands together. “How much longer?”
The unexpected comment almost made Harry choke as he sat up to take the book. “What the fuck? I thought they were for research!” Harry flipped through quickly, but no sexy words jumped out at him. But he did see loads of dialogue, which he wouldn’t see in a non-fiction book. “Are you saying these are like…” His voice dropped seductively, “
(5:53 pm) Yeah, ok I see where that’s weird.
“Noted.”
Blaise welcomed him with a wide smile. “There’s the master planner!” He rubbed his hands together. “Where’s my prize?”
,” he said, pointing at his mouth. “You see how I’m emphasising the ‘s’ sound? That’s because it’s plural. That means there’s more than one.”
and Harry thought that would do both brothers some good.
“Yeah,” Harry said, digging in his trunk for the pyjamas he hadn’t needed for almost a week. “He likes to count our days together.”
“I love you more.”
“It’s right here, love!”
I stalk after Baz out to the middle of fucking nowhere, when he suddenly turns to me expectantly. He
“You don’t know that.” Harry wanted to reach for Draco’s hand but was afraid with Narcissa Malfoy watching so closely, even if she couldn’t hear them. “I’m Harry Potter, you know. It would be very advantageous to allow a union between us.”
Jane crowded close behind Draco instead of answering. Draco shook his head. “Why don’t you bring some food to the conservatory? Astoria, can you get Theo for me? And the big med kit? Come along, Jane, it’s this way.” Astoria’s eyes widened when they met Pansy’s but both of them hurried to their tasks.
“Doesn’t Harry prefer to be early when he can, to avoid work distractions that make him late?” Draco asked, once again laying his hand across the back of Harry’s chair.
“I see.” Draco bit his lip but didn’t say anything else.
The flames in the fireplace turned a bright green only seconds before the floo dumped a giggling Harry onto their sitting room floor.
“You’ll
“Huh,” Harry said, his heart skipping a few beats. Draco wasn’t considering it, was he? “Interesting idea.”
-------
Annie giggled, wrapping her arms tight around his neck. “Run, Draco!”
Auror Blakely didn’t seem to think so, but Draco stayed silent on the subject. The others were waiting on them and now wasn’t the time to belabour the point.
Draco’s head hit the shelf behind him as he sighed at the ceiling. “Your mouth is a fucking dream,” he moaned softly. He tensed when a minute or two later he thought he heard more footsteps outside. “Hurry it up.”
(7:38 pm) And the war was nearly 7 years ago. We’re not the same people we were then.
“It’s okay, I don’t mind kneeling for you.”
“Perfect!” Draco grinned.
“Oh Harry, every day with you is a new adventure.”
“Are those our
“Is that how it was?” Harry asked, looking down at his assigned reading to avoid having to look at Draco. “Resistant at first but having a good time by the end?”
“Just like that. Naked and hard and so beautiful. Play for me.”
Draco groaned and decided he didn’t care about preserving the hardwood floors of the Manor if it meant he never had to talk to Lavinia Malfoy’s portrait ever again. She had to be the most sour of all his ancestors and why anyone wanted a talking portrait of her would forever be a mystery. Let the house be lived in. He had other, more important things to think about now.
“Are you trying to distract me?”
“We can’t get pregnant, can we?” Harry choked out. Oh fuck, was there
As Harry’s sweaty body collapsed onto Draco, he huffed a tired laugh into Draco’s shoulder. “That was just… so, so good.”
“I don’t think Draco wanted to reset anything.”
Good, we’re on the same page.
“Okay, next game. You have to bounce the ping pong ball on the table and into the egg carton. When the carton is full, we’ll see who has the most.” Harry charmed ten ping pong balls green and gave them to Draco, then charmed another ten red for himself.
“Sounds good. Want help?”
When it looked like Theo had nothing more to say, Harry prompted, “If they don’t approve, then what?” Ugh, what a git, leaving Harry hanging that way.
The door flew open and Harry chased Draco inside the moderately priced (ugh, as if they weren’t both wealthy beyond imagining and could afford better, but alas their impromptu holiday coincided with a conference) hotel room, straight to the bed. Harry’s body covered his and Draco almost gave in to the questing hands and the hard cock pressing into his hip.
“Others with us.” Daphne swallowed heavily, then reached into her pocket for the apple. She held it out to Draco. “Can the others come too?”
With a mock gasp of indignation Ron said, “You mean we don’t roll through your floo at all hours as though your house is an extension of ours? Well now I’m just heart-broken.”
“If you wanted to be the big spoon, you should have said so years ago when our sleep roles were first defined.”
“Yeah, see… I don’t think we are…” Harry darted away from another swat. “But next time I’ll give you fair warning.” He picked his Cloak up off the floor and shook it out. He set it on his shoulders, making half his body disappear. “Can you help me get out of the shop? Maybe step outside and look down Diagon Alley for no reason?”
“Oh absolutely. And the boots… Sirius would be glad you’re still getting use out of them.” Draco knew almost nothing first-hand about Sirius Black but had seen and heard enough of Harry’s memories to feel confident in saying so. Especially when it always brought a soft smile to Harry’s face. “Your timing is perfect. The portkey should be leaving in just a few moments.”
be met with hexes.” He opened the gate and gestured to the road. “Get the fuck out.”
“Yes,
“Still…” She pursed her lips and looked over the group. “I understand Auror Trainee Potter has been visiting?” At Draco’s nod she said, “It might be best for them to see a familiar face. Trainee Potter, why don’t you go with Mr Preston to interview the children.”
Harry shrugged, not really wanting to explain about the choices he’d never been given.
“Just kiss me, you plonker.”
“I may have overdone it on the stimulants today,” Draco admitted reluctantly.
Theo took the two goblets to the lab to clean just as the wards alerted Draco that someone had arrived in the visitor’s parlour.
“Oh, erm…” Harry looked at Draco, brows raised in question.
“I thought you might be interested,” Potter said, flashing her a winning smile.
“Tomorrow, you idiots. Tomorrow!” Draco waved absently and crawled up the stairs to his lavish bedroom. He sprawled across his bed, not bothering to change out of the robes he wore.
Draco could see on his face the same worry that someone would go through their rubbish bins and discover the load of rejected sex toys. Even if no one had ever gone through their rubbish bins before.
“I don’t care. We’re only allowed out of the castle once a week and I’m taking advantage of it. I want to buy a present for Draco. Something special.”
His thin white t-shirt turned near translucent and he almost laughed as Harry’s eyes scanned the sight appreciatively. His husband was nothing if not predictable.
Draco didn’t see anything worth laughing at. “We didn’t get letters,” he said simply.
He doesn’t seem to have caught on yet that he’s teaching me all the wrong lessons. And I can’t wait to do it again.
“Yes. Your father would have brought it himself, but he is indisposed.” She handed a parchment scroll to Harry.
After lunch at the Three Broomsticks, where he had to sidestep Draco’s second offer of getting a room upstairs—he didn’t need
Fucking hell. How did they burn through them so fast? Didn’t Draco
“An extended house party for my birthday. Our post, if you please,” Draco said, holding his hand out for the letters.
“Not as cool as the dragon, but better than the dodo so I’ll take it.” He nudged Harry’s leg. “Get to work so we can get to playing.”
.” Harry groaned and dropped his head into the spray. Water cascaded down his back and over his sensitive, stretched rim. “Fuck… I want to be inside you. More than anything. I want it to be me. Fucking you harder and harder and -” He broke off on a moan and slowed his rocking to ease the building burn in his thighs.
“Finally, our family’s last Hogwarts acceptance letter!” Harry whispered happily, brandishing the letter at Draco. “I know we’ll miss them, but damn I’m excited about the empty-ish nest.”
Clothing quickly became another pressing issue. Almost none of their new guests had clothes to wear when they arrived. They’d gone through the Manor to find robes of all sorts, but for the younger children, they didn’t fit well enough. Pansy and Theo managed to alter them a little, but they still tripped over hems or dragged their sagging cuffs too near the fire to be safe.
“Are you going to Japan?” Ron asked, looking just as confused as Ginny. “Or is it research for Molly?”
My too-sexy, too-adorable, too-straight roommate looks down at
“That is... really putting the cart before the horse. You haven’t even kissed me yet. Haven’t told your friends you’re gay—”
Draco made a dismissive sound and stuck his tongue out at Harry.
Boy shorts. The style had a name and it was boy shorts. Which seemed somehow ironic.
! Why hadn’t he told Ron and Hermione about it? He’d been Harry’s healer for three years now and they’d been friends for about that long. Surely Harry knew they wouldn’t be upset about it.
“Are you all right?” Potter asked as he dragged him from the Apparition alcove.
Entirely too early the next morning, Harry heard a knock on his door. Ron mumbled something incoherent from his bed and threw his extra pillow in the direction of the sound, then settled back into sleep.
As they parted ways for their rooms, Draco asked, “Would you like a kiss goodnight?”
“Hoo-hoo! This date is about to get interesting!” Harry laughed. “I’ve not drawn
“Good. Just checking. I’ve heard it’s the most common type of fantasy.” Harry dragged his lips along Draco’s neck, sucking a tiny love bite into the sensitive skin. Then he sat up, shaking his head. “But it holds absolutely no appeal to me. This seemed fun though, don’t you think?”
Potter found them there, all covered in paint. He bundled up his Auror Trainee robe and threw it angrily into a corner. Draco frowned at him, “I thought you were quitting that piece of shit job.”
Harry made an inarticulate sound and hurried towards the infirmary. Ha! As if he cared about Theo’s petty jealousy. At nineteen years old, Theo should be well beyond it. Although being here at school made them all feel about thirteen years old most of the time so perhaps not.
And he seems to fucking know it with the way he draws each kernel into his mouth with a flick of his tongue.
Draco rolled his eyes at the tiny voice. “Elyon, you can’t say bullshit. It’s not a proper little boy word.”
“Better than a wife, you mean?”
ever again. Guilt still sat like a lead weight in his stomach when he thought of the commands he’d given Draco over the last two weeks. “This will put us on even footing. Equals. Both invested in a future together. But you don’t have to if it’s not what
“Are you sure?” Harry asked, already typing his number in. He didn’t have any interest in dating Pansy (who was taken anyway), but he liked the idea of keeping Ginny on her toes, wondering whether Pansy or Draco posed the bigger threat.
, about my life is up for public consumption.” He sighed and looked at Draco. “I just liked having this one thing that was mine. Something no one knew about.”
For a brief moment, a flash of indignation shot through Draco. Wouldn't a perfect day mean sharing intimacies with the love of his life? But it dissolved as quickly as it came and instead Draco melted into his husband’s embrace.
Draco turned in Harry’s arms with a smile. Harry had been more affectionate than usual since their return from the spa. Definitely worth every single knut, and another reservation in six months. He tilted his head back so Harry could kiss along his neck.
What. The.
“And if I’m not?”
Harry gave Draco a hug and ran a hand down his back in soothing circles. “Are you nervous?”
“Right, sure. A family, a quiet life. Sounds lovely.”
Perhaps Malfoy would do the same and Harry could find out if the ink went all the way up to his shoulder.
“Yeah so, instead I wanted to show you another memory…”
Draco let magic build in his hand and then zapped Harry’s cheek with it. “You know I have my ways.” But that only made Harry giggle all the harder. “What are you doing here and why did you have to scare the life out of me?”
“Time to make plans,” Harry said with a grin.
“Don’t we still have those roller massage thingies? We could charm the set of them to work over both of us, like a couple’s massage.” Giddy excitement coursed through Draco at this decadent play during a random week night.
“Honestly, how are you such a lightweight?” Draco laughed, easily dodging Harry’s groping hands as he spelled Harry’s pyjamas on him. “Were there mixed drinks too?” A quick charm for his teeth, instead of his usual toothbrush, and one to empty his bladder for him, and Harry was as ready for bed as Draco could make him.
He rearranged the books on his shelves so they didn’t look so empty without Draco’s books.
look relaxed, with his hands in his pockets, but the tension in his shoulders tells another story.
“You wait here!” Harry said, guiding Draco to sit on their bed. “I hid your gift in my workshop so you wouldn’t find it while you were snooping around.”
(12:19 pm) Ha! No way that’s true! And no way I’m drawing my sweet, innocent kitten like that.
“Yes. Which room is yours?”
“Now,” Draco said breathily as he slid down Harry’s body to kneel on the shower floor. He scrunched up his face. “Can’t you at least cushion the shower floor?”
“Yes, but perfect in every way.” He kissed the top of Draco’s head.
So he asked Kreacher to pack extra food because all of their friends were just the worst.
Draco laughed. “That was indeed amazing.”
, he thought to himself.
two forty-one year old men to sneak aboard.
“No,” Draco said firmly, stepping between their visitors and Jason. “You are not taking anyone with you. He was left, quite clearly, in
“I’ll keep that in mind. Good-bye Harry,” Draco said softly. He hesitated briefly, then pulled Harry in for a last hug.
Draco snorted loudly. “Beans and — You can’t name your dog
They watched as Daphne and Theo hung a massive banner along the longest wall—Malfoy Home for Lost Children.
“No she isn’t!”
Pansy’s grimace had deepened as more and more ice cream melted and dripped and smeared over everything. Greg bounced Chester in his lap, making the little boy giggle as he tried to eat his ice cream through the jiggling. Daphne gave Orion a small lick of Lizzie’s vanilla cone, then blushed and shrugged when Draco glared at her over it. Draco had to roll his eyes—he wasn’t naive enough to think that was Orion’s first little treat.
“The Ministry floos were a nightmare and I couldn’t apparate even one more time today, so I thought I’d walk but then… Rain. How’d you get home so quickly?”
Each button he fumbles to unfasten is a call, a signal, a cry for help.
“Well, everything looks good. Except for the obvious,” Draco said with a little chuckle. “I’ll let you know as soon as the new potion is ready and you can switch back. Until then, try and—” He did a double take at jittery Harry. “Just try and stay relaxed, all right? You’re going to be fine.”
They’d both taken the afternoon off for this, even though neither of them could imagine it would feel like anything more than either a silly school exercise or something reminiscent of battles they’d long put to rest. Why was this on a list of kinky activities? Although Draco did have hopes to turn it into one.
swirled together with
“They also do commitment ceremonies for same-sex couples.”
Potter’s double take at Draco made every single flower worth it. “There are flowers in your hair.”
“I want to marry you, Harry,” Draco said softly. “Let’s set a date and do the commitment thing and maybe we can do a private magical bonding at the same time. Anything at all. I want to marry you.”
“Right. Early morning, I suppose…” Harry didn’t know how to say goodbye without being able to touch Draco at all. He shuffled nervously for a moment. “I guess I can’t kiss or hug you goodnight so…” Ugh, another stupid, awkward wave. He shoved his hands in his pockets. “I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“The Aurors are holding up the approval,” she said without preamble.
“Please,” Harry scoffed, “Ron and I just call that shit even and move on. We’ve saved each other too much to bother keeping track.”
An unseen bell dinged when the clock began counting down five more minutes.
“Annie, are you enjoying your ice cream?” Potter asked politely.
He reared back, managing to smile anyway. “Thank you, Little Bit, but that’s all yours.” He reached for a napkin to wipe at her face and dripping hands. “What NEWT year?” he asked Potter.
“They wouldn’t have been so suspicious if he hadn’t come from Malfoy Manor. They wouldn’t have taken him from any other home.”
“I’m sorry… I didn’t expect…”
“That’s not—that can’t be true.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco smiled at him one last time. He scanned Harry as though trying to memorise this last moment. Harry wished he’d showered and dressed, but he hadn’t wanted to miss a single minute of Draco’s last morning.
“Perhaps.”
“Even if it means I luckily get everything exactly right to give you a mind-blowing orgasm?”
“It’s fine. It’s a reality we’re all living with. We can’t avoid it forever.” Draco tucked his hands into the pockets of his jeans. “The children enjoyed having you here.”
In the photo, Draco’s polite, contained smile broke when Harry surprised him with a kiss to his cheek. The joy rolling over Draco’s features transformed him and made Harry’s heart ache all over again.
And what would happen to them when their parents
“I love you, too. Every day.”
Both Robbie and Jane whined at the taste, but obediently drank under Draco’s watchful eye. Hopefully they’d dosed Robbie correctly this time and wouldn’t run into any problems for the full moon.
Draco spent the afternoon in the makeshift lab with Theo, working on the Wolfsbane potion for the upcoming October moon. One day, when there weren’t so many people watching his every last move, he’d like to tweak the recipe and see if he could make something more shelf-stable. They’d come up with a few possibilities to test, but couldn’t risk ruining a batch, with aconite in such short supply. Better to go with the recipe they
“Good plan. But I’m only catching it once and then I want off this thing.”
This had been a horrible fucking mistake. Harry laughed nervously. “If you like... you know…” Maybe Draco didn’t want it to be a date? Maybe it could be something different… like a thank you? “I mean, you sort of owe me… from before… when I saved you from that tumble? Right?”
“Ron… It’s not… I’m not
“I know. But we’ll make it. And we can work out something better for the betrothal contract. Ron said there’s more leeway there.”
But Draco gave Harry’s hip a squeeze and stepped back. Harry carefully slipped off the toy, hissing when it popped free. He kept waiting for embarrassment to overwhelm him, but the sweet high of his orgasm still swirled through his veins and he couldn’t really care about anything at the moment.
share that with me more than once in my younger years.”
coating every surface of the Gryffindor common room. His words might have had more impact if half of them didn’t come out on a hitching moan as Harry’s pace picked up.
Immediately contrite, Harry babbled, “Nothing, love, you look beautiful. Gorgeous. It’s barely noticeable at all.” Harry held a towel out to him with a hopeful expression that begged for forgiveness. “Really, I’m so sorry.”
The older one glared at Draco. “We don’t want to stay here.” A little girl perhaps, judging by the pitch of her voice.
“Hello, we’ve got a large group here today,” Draco said with a smile, gesturing at the boisterous children. “They’ll eat literally anything so could we have a variety of ice cream cones? Any flavours at all will do.”
Giddy excitement bubbled through Draco as he traced Harry’s collarbone. “I
As he lashed his purchases to his bike’s cargo rack, his heart leapt into his throat. “Potter,” he groaned in greeting. “I thought your spying had come to an end.”
Sure enough, the healer pulled the curtain back and smiled down at Orion. “Excellent. His colour is good, and he’s breathing well on his own.” He nodded at the mediwitch behind him as he signed the parchment on his clipboard. “He’s free to go as soon as Mediwitch Mallory finishes up.”
“As much as it pains me, it’s time we admit you make Draco happy.” She gave him the box, then turned her back to him. Harry fumbled the necklace out of the box and set it around her neck. “And if it’s marriage or continuing to put his life in danger… I suppose we’ll have to take marriage.” She patted her hair and the necklace, and turned to him with a tight smile. “Don’t fuck this up, Mr Potter.”
“And Granger?” Draco asked, maintaining eye contact with the Auror.
Memories assaulted him, filled with blood and sweat and fear and hexes and hate. He jumped off his bike, not caring that it crashed to the ground. Pacing tight circles around it, Draco gripped his head, mumbling, “No, no, no.” The world tilted under his feet and he hit his knees, his stomach roiling. Breathing became difficult and his face prickled as he struggled to inhale.
“If you think I’ll believe that a single butterbeer can get a twenty-five year old man drunk, you have another think coming.” Malfoy sidled closer to Harry and traced a finger down the condensation on his bottle and whispered, “On the other hand, if you think you’re sober enough, we can explore this a little more at mine.”
“Yup, that’s doing the trick,” Harry said. Two minutes later, he sheepishly emerged from the bathroom. “Okay so… I think I like Draco.”
“Just children,” Granger responded. Ignoring Blakely entirely, she focused on Draco. “Why were they on the streets? Why weren’t they placed in homes when their parents were arrested?”
Niall threw the ruler aside and took Dev’s cock in hand, growling against his lips, “This is a stupid waste of time when I could be wearing a big dumb grin of my own.”
Draco kissed Harry’s temple and went off to bed. Even if he didn’t fall soundly asleep until Harry’s body curled up next to his.
Harry stood more slowly, and smiled at Draco. “Erm, well… Are you coming to the common room?” he asked.
“You know I have,” Harry said, nuzzling Draco.
“No! We’re not doing anything to risk my mother coming back here to chew my ear off about my
As if Draco knew how to live a life without worry any longer. Still, they celebrated the way they usually did, with ice cream and too many fizzy drinks for so late in the day. Theo’s study of wards over the last few weeks taught him how to shield a room from magic entirely. They managed to set up a telly and VCR Draco bought at
(10:38 am) The list is *that* long?
, what was that?!” He held his throbbing hand to his chest protectively.
“You might have it anyway!” Potter yelled at his retreating form.
be embarrassed because who wanted anyone to see their personal items strewn about?
“Simon, you clumsy fuck,” I groan as I yank off the ruined shirt and throw it to the floor.
With all the excited chattering in the common room, it took a while for Harry to notice Theo hovering nearby. But he couldn’t ignore it at dinner when Theo sat right between Draco and Harry. At first he thought it might be a kindness, so they didn’t accidentally bump elbows and shock each other. But Theo didn’t have that sort of kindness in him.
“Not this time.” Draco kissed Harry quickly and then left for their room, unbuttoning his robes along the way.
Harry stroked Draco’s hair, and rubbed circles down his back. “Admittedly, you came back to a dreary situation. It’s not like that anymore. Now it’s a place you would have been happy to return to. It’s going to be fine. You’ll see. Come on, let’s go wait by the gates. The sun will perk you up.”
“Eh, it’s mostly cheese toasties and chocolate frogs. But there’s loads of wine.” He ducked his head down to peer into her face. “You can stay as long as you like.” His rattled brain struggled to call to mind something important. He shouldn’t have drank so much of the potion. Oh! “Astoria too. If she’s around.”
Potter returned a few days later with a large basket overflowing with sweets from Honeydukes. They didn’t know the birthdays for most of the children and so decided to celebrate everyone’s birthday at once on the fourth of October. Greg loved the idea of sharing his birthday with everyone, and it kept things simpler for all the caretakers.
me and burning everything away until I was nothing but light and fire and melting but in a good way that I never wanted to end, even if I died from it.”
Harry spluttered as he passed the signed waiver over. “Ten
Unbidden, memories of having Harry against these very shelves when the shop first opened flooded Draco’s mind. Apparently it took very little prompting for the adrenaline surge of his fight or flight response to turn to a fuck response instead.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Not really, I suppose. Where’s the magical element?”
The sword presses into my throat and the sharp tang of my own blood assaults my senses. Snow makes a choked sound and the sword falls to the ground with a clatter that reverberates through my whole body.
What a wanker, Harry thought with a grin. A delicious, sexy wanker that he was going to ravish later. He didn’t listen to a single word in Defence and wondered if they had enough time during their lunch break to do all the wicked things tumbling around in his brain.
? I thought I said I didn’t want to do anything illegal!” But his feet followed after Harry anyway.
“Apologies for the long walk to the front door,” Malfoy said, leading them down the drive.
“Is it possible to go overboard when your name actually means dragon?”
They had a nice time walking the bustling streets together. They got a few double takes and Harry saw several fingers pointing, but Harry went ahead acting as though they were any couple enjoying the spring weather. Harry liked hanging out with Draco outside of their lessons and common room. Seeing him smile made his heart beat faster and Harry just wanted to giggle like a mad fool about it.
with Draco, you know…”
“I mean, it’s still rather new. The idea of it. But the more I think about it, the more I’m…” Harry’s words came quickly, tripping over each other in their haste. “I just — I read those words and I could see it, you know? Another man petting my dog and asking for extra jam on his pancakes and now I’m…” He nervously licked his lips. “Yeah, I think it suits me better than — than the alternative.”
None of them caught Harry’s attention like the simple, unembellished square in the lower right hand corner, almost underneath
Draco closed his eyes for two seconds and they popped open wide and bright. “I didn’t realise that was an option.”
“Not really.” But then seconds later, Potter said, “Training is not going well.”
“Ah well, it’s supposed to be the Mirror of Erised.”
Draco smiled and kissed Harry lightly. “Just so long as you know you don’t need luck to get into my pants.”
The stares of other people made his skin crawl. He didn’t know whether their hate was real or imagined, but it prickled enough to be real to him. And he fucking hated it. But it was Draco playing host to this little drinking spree, and so it was Draco that had to go.
I know everyone goes nuts about Simon and Baz's first kiss in the forest with the fire. But I much prefer their kisses in Baz's room just after so I wrote about it here!
“Not really. There are too many outcomes to truths and lies. Who can say if you would have lived or died if I’d acted differently?”
They held the cat figurine together, and Harry managed a sweet kiss before it whisked them away to London.
“I know.” Draco gave him a small smile. “I know and it’s fine. Or it will be one day when I can forget this episode entirely.” He sighed heavily. “I’m sorry but I think I just want to be alone right now.”
He pulled a long rope from his messenger bag and held one end out to Daphne and the other to Greg. They stretched it between them and Theo, Pansy, and Draco got started spelling the children’s hands to the evenly spaced loops.
When the path opened up to a small clearing with a gnarly tree that looked perfect for climbing, Harry decided the spot was good as any for sketching. He spread out a blanket and pulled two butterbeers and a box of homemade biscuits from his bag. Draco joined him, adding three bakery boxes to the snack pile.
“Your Aunt Andromeda is signing on with us?” Pansy’s eyes darted from Draco to Potter and back. “You have a lot of explaining to do.”
“How old is she?” Ms Coddle asked, interrupting his thoughts.
“Thanks for letting us crash the party,” Pansy said as she also stood. “We’ll have to do it again sometime.”
“Yeah, you think Saint Potter is going to keep secret what he’s seen?
“This isn’t a fair game! You fly with the nephews and nieces all the time!”
Daphne’s story became a common refrain. “The Ministry has seized our accounts until the trials are over. And there’s paperwork to be done. They said I was of age and could just get a job to tide us over. But no one’s hiring and the ones that are don’t want possible Death Eater sympathizers.”
, getting right to the good stuff!”
Harry picked up his sketchbook, happily buzzing with ideas for his Draco Deer.
“Since I stole it—”
“Thank you, Mr Malfoy, for your time and the tour. It was very… informative.” Ms Coddle held her hand out to shake, considerably more cordial than when she arrived. “We’ll review our notes with the board and let you know when your application is ready to progress to the next stage.”
No, there wasn’t, with their parents in prison.
“Oh,” he said, bewildered for a moment. “I forgot a flannel. Hold tight.”
“I would love to,” she said warmly. “I’ll bring butterbeers for the children.”
Merlin
There was a long beat of silence. “All right. Call if you need me.” The sounds of her footsteps faded away.
Whatever teasing Harry hoped to accomplish got turned back on him when Draco subtly shifted as he talked so that his arse rubbed lightly over Harry’s growing erection.
at it! Draco stomped off in the opposite direction, even if that meant taking the roundabout route to his office. Because he had letters to write! Real work to do! He couldn’t waste his afternoon with a pretty boy that wanted to play
Potter scrubbed at his hair. “Eh, well… Sort of. It’ll be fine. I’m quitting soon anyway.”
Draco winked and waved before entering his own room two doors down.
Silence builds until I can’t take it anymore and finally yell, “What are you—”
“Yeah, okay.” Harry found a clean t-shirt too and led him back to the front door. “You won’t tell anyone, will you?”
Potter shrugged unapologetically, “You didn’t answer when I called your name so… stinging hex. You told me not to let you fall asleep here.”
Harry’s carefully held control fled him in that instant and Draco couldn’t say he was sorry to see it go. He loved when Harry lost himself, trusting Draco to hold onto him. It never got old, the way Harry moaned Draco’s name like something precious. The way his body moved against Draco’s. The soft surrender when he collapsed, sweaty and spent, against Draco’s chest.
“Pickles is a free Elf,” he squeaked. His eyes darted erratically again and he looked ready to flee. Gently, Astoria passed Orion over to him. The Elf sighed happily and hugged the baby close. “Pickles will take the baby for a little bath.”
Draco tapped Potter’s boot with his own. “Are you trying to wrangle a spot on our Board of Directors? Ha! As if we’d ever hire the likes of you!” Draco scoffed and mumbled, “Gryffindors!” under his breath.
Harry perked up at the small black box tied with a purple satin ribbon. “Ooh, so fancy!” He opened the box and found burgundy satin and lace.
In the kitchen, Greg, Jason, and Alex were taken by surprise amidst a snack with Roger, Chester and Orion. How the fuck had they not heard about their unexpected visitors? They all jumped to their feet when the group came in. Chester, much like Annie, panicked and tried to climb Greg like a tree. Greg handed Orion to Jason and picked up Chester.
“I want you to beg for it, Harry.”
“I already told you it wasn’t,” Draco laughed, kissing each of Harry’s cheeks. “I want to help you and I can’t do that if you don’t tell me what’s wrong.”
“Muggle clothes?” Alex asked with a sneer.
He could cross the common room and sit next to Draco and smile and ask him on a date and it would be no big deal because they were friends and he didn’t need to be nervous about it, even if this was his first date with a guy, because Draco had dropped a hint or two that he might be interested too and surely Harry hadn’t misinterpreted that—
“Bloody fuck!” Ron yelled and ran for the bathroom, slamming it behind him.
“I have three t-shirts,” he blurted out. Then his tongue hurried on without consulting his brain. “I bought a pack of undershirts during a muggle studies outing. They’re thin and boring and white.”
Jane didn’t answer, nibbling on her bread and focusing on her plate. Potter didn’t seem offended and turned to Gretchen instead. She bounced in her seat and begged Potter to take her flying again. Daria and Libby whined about a promise Potter had made to play gobstones with them, and Elyon said they did that last time and should play football instead, while there was still enough daylight.
Draco shoved Blaise out the door and rolled his eyes while Harry spluttered uselessly.
As expected, their friends followed, looking appropriately somber. Harry did his best to keep a serious face on as well.
“Calm down?
Draco’s fork halted halfway to his mouth. “Is that so?” he asked, instantly suspicious.
“Mm, remember that farmer yelling at us to get the fuck off his property?”
He locked the door to the study and pretended his flat didn’t have a spare room.
“Touch your body? Hmm… sounds like if I came
Ms Coddle leaned forward conspiratorially and whispered, “Mine isn’t very tidy either. My mummy despairs of me ever learning to make my bed.”
“Naked?”
Draco nodded and closed his eyes against the light brush of magic.
“Goodnight, Harry,” Draco said and offered a small smile.
Kneeling side by side in front of the coffee table, they started bouncing their ping pong balls. They went absolutely everywhere, and were tricky to summon back so that they didn’t accidentally summon any from the carton. Harry had an early lead, but clearly grew distracted by Draco’s
children of a union, and they’re more open to adoption and all. Others specify blood relatives. I’d guess the Malfoys are caught up in blood ties, so Draco will probably need a natural heir.”
His smile of relief is answer enough.
(12:15 pm) 26 adorable animals!
“Romantic as ever,” Draco sighed.
Draco turned to them with a completely straight face and said, “On behalf of my goddaughter, who is a very big fan of the adventures of Molly Meow, I messaged Harry expressing our concern over the recent loss of Molly’s goldfish.” He frowned at Harry. “Why does a cat have a pet goldfish? Isn't that odd? When Mr Wiggles died, I honestly worried Molly might eat him instead of bury him.”
“Is this your first time?” he asks as I slowly lick the underside of his cock.
“Really? Yes. That’s great. Yeah. Er, tomorrow?”
He scoffed as he approached. It figured these two would find a way to make Draco’s life miserable. He crossed his arms and spoke through the bars. “Can I help you?”
Before the wizard could launch into a spiel about duelling spaces, Draco said, “We’ll take a private room.” They didn’t need random strangers witnessing their ridiculous duel. He signed the waiver after a brief glance and passed it to Harry. They had no intentions of incurring injury and wouldn’t sue the gym even if they did.
bumping of hips and elbows, and the occasional groan of frustration that might be considered obscene if someone else heard him.
Draco clapped his hands decisively, “Okay, one problem at a time. Let’s worry about Hogwarts first. We need lists. Pansy, if you could compile all the Hogwarts supplies from the letters. Books, cauldrons, that sort of thing. Daphne, you handle personal items. Toothbrushes and parchments. Greg, why don’t you talk to the kids and see if there’s anything specific they want or need. Whatever we can’t owl order, I’ll pick up myself.”
Stuffed animals, bouncy balls, and little lorries and cars tumbled out of a basket barely large enough to contain them. Growing up, he never imagined a day might come when toys of any kind were welcome in this space. But Draco would do anything that made the children feel safe and loved. Including, he couldn’t help his wince, the dirty handprints on the wall. Good thing he had a decade to clean it up before his father found out.
All the children gathered in the large ballroom for the distribution of letters. Theo duplicated all of them before handing them out. But not everyone welcomed the start of the school year.
“Yes well,” the witch nervously brushed her robes, “we’ve had many contributions and outreach programmes in the works, and they all take time to approve. As it happens, we’re here now to move forward with your application. With an inspection.”

Harry smiled back. “Goodnight, Draco.”
for this shit. “I’m going to bed,” he said, turning back towards the house. “I can’t deal with this right now.”
He summoned a few towels and used them as a pillow on the hard tile. Curled up on his side, he tried to ignore each cherished memory turning sour and painful. He wondered dimly how he could ever show his face at the castle again. Had anyone else known? Did they all think Harry was some horrible human being for enslaving Draco and using him for… for…
“I tried telling her that,” Harry muttered. “Did you figure out who was behind the attack?”
Molly Weasley, of course, insisted that they all stay for dinner afterwards.  Harry noticed that Percy hadn’t made an appearance yet, so he was surprised when he felt a tap on his shoulder and turned around to see Oliver standing there.
“Merlin’s beard,” Harry muttered, finally rolling his eyes like he’d wanted to for several hours.  He rubbed his temple and pressed the button for the next available lift.
Harry was running late, again. He had underestimated just how long some of his work tasks were going to take that morning and it wasn’t until a paper crane landed on his desk with a very curt where are you? we’re supposed to be at the open house in fifteen minutes that he even realized what time it was.
“Well Harry, we do have an opening here for next term… as the Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor.  Professor Murphy has accepted a position at Ilvermorny, he missed the States too much to continue here.  But it does leave Hogwarts in an utter predicament.”
“A touching speech, Mr. Malfoy.” Percy said as he reached for the glowing kettle. But Oliver slapped his hand away.
For Harry, this book is about him learning to understand feelings. He suddenly is feeling not only his own emotions but Voldemort’s and he’s finally starting to get it. When he’s in his first detention with Umbridge, he feels Voldemort’s happiness and doesn’t even recognize it. But later in the book he’s able to translate Voldemort’s feelings and that’s a sign that eventually he’ll be able to translate his own.
“The only wedding I’ve attended in the wizarding world was interrupted by Death Eaters,” Harry said pointedly. “I want to be able to experience a true wizarding wedding with Ginny. I want to pull out all the stops, and make this an event that nobody will ever forget..”
This sounds an awful lot like Harry is at least attracted to Cedric, even if he’s not interested in him romantically (or willing to admit that he is, feelings are complicated for him).
“Hermione Jean Granger, you and Ron are best friends and absolutely perfect for each other. You know I question most things and always have, but I have never questioned your love for each other.”
“I realized that the outfit I wanted to wear today was here,” Ginny said and held up a pile of clothes. “And Harry was actually here looking for me. He needed some relationship advice regarding Hogwarts Hottie that wasn’t from Hermione or Ron.”
“But, I’m a trained auror!” Harry protested, as the pair worked together to deflect spells.
Harry Potter explains that a house elf appeared in his bedroom with the mission of stopping him from going back to Hogwarts. Dobby is worried about Harry Potter’s safety and knows that there’s something sinister in the works, but the Weasleys explain that Dobby is also probably following orders.
“I may have been able to figure that one out for myself, Malfoy,” Harry suppressed a chuckle and took in the run-down booths lining the sides of the bar and the floor which seemed sticky no matter where he stepped.
“Potter, I don’t think this song requires looking like a bowtruckle. I think there should be some rhythm involved.” Draco barely suppressed a laugh. Harry stopped moving and rolled his eyes.
evening. The two of you surely deserve each other.” Draco pulled the cloak he hadn’t removed tightly around himself and began to exit the room when Cormac crossed the floor to meet him.
“No-” Harry started.
They were waiting for the kettle to start glowing when the door swung open and Draco stood in the doorway. He was panting with his hands on his knees.
“What is it?” Draco asked as Harry led him towards the kitchen.
“That’s only a contributing factor.” He waited for Harry to swallow the potion. “Unfortunately, your behavior was deemed as reckless, you endangered yourself, your coworkers, and countless others, and you disobeyed a direct order from a superior.”
“I see what you meant, Pans, he really is like a walking advertisement for draught of living death.” Ginny was sucking on what appeared to be an acid pop.  Pansy came into the room, clearly having just buttoned her blouse.
“You know, I’ve been wanting to go there for ages but it’s so difficult to snag a table. So sure, why not,” Percy said, removing his cloak from the back of his chair and putting it on. “Lead the way.”
“Draco,” Oliver shook his head like he was talking to a small child. “If this is about Percy and Cormac, Harry already spoke to me about it. And I’ll tell you what I told him, Percy explained everything to me about how it was a work related thing and had nothing to do with our relationship.” Percy tensed slightly. Draco allowed himself a moment of relief when he realized that Harry hadn’t sold him out completely. He only warned Oliver about Percy but didn’t mention their involvement in the fiasco.
The pair has put their differences aside. They might not yet be friends, but they’re no longer enemies/rivals. Their relationship has changed enough in this moment where Draco trusts Harry, and Harry is willing to risk his life to save him, that they open up the possibility that they could be friends (or lovers) in the future. But saving Draco once is not enough for Harry Potter, who definitely gets off on saving people. He saves him again later by stunning a Death Eater that Draco was pleading with, and
They stopped and turned to see a formidable centaur.
“Yes, of course, misery loves its company, I suppose,” Draco sighed, promptly tucking away the strange sensation of grief, regret, and closure he felt at his father’s death. Draco desperately wanted to change the subject. “So, uhm, working for a pseudo family member who’s the brother of your ex must be buckets of fun, huh?”
“I sometimes can’t believe just how far we have come. To say we spent our entire childhood bickering, would be an understatement. But, I wouldn’t have wanted to bicker with anyone other than you.  Ron, you’re my fiercest supporter and you’re the only person I want by my side forever. I love you and I can’t wait for this next grand adventure.”  Hermione grabbed Ron’s hands as she finished. He tightened his around hers before clearing his throat.
The trio started making their way back to the edge of the forest when suddenly they heard a voice behind them.
“Did you forget that it was winter, Potter?” Draco rolled his eyes fondly, eyeing Harry’s lack of outerwear.
“None taken,” Harry spun Ginny around. “Maybe someday I will be as lucky as you and find my Pansy.”
"Just call the damn patronus, or lumos, or something. I don't want to move, otherwise this plant is going to swallow me whole!" Harry was also furious and yelling.
(398)
“No. I meant when.” Harry said definitively. “Oh, by the way, Percy wants to cancel his dinner with Oliver tonight to go on a date with your boyfriend, McLaggen.”
“Looks like she saved the best for last.” Harry whispered, leaning over Neville so that Draco would be able to hear him.
“So how long is long enough to wait it out for them to show?” Oliver said right before taking a big gulp of his lager.  While Percy was being somewhat friendly, alcohol usually made everything a tad bit smoother conversation wise.
******************
“Is that true, Percy? Did you lie to me about the nature of your relationship with Cormac?” Percy gave a slight nod. “I don’t care about the Quidditch tickets, you wouldn’t be the first person to date me for those.” Oliver smiled slightly, but then frowned again. “But you lied to me, and that’s really not okay. I may not be the most successful when it comes to relationships, but I know what I’m worth. I’m going to go to this Quidditch game alone, and I’m going to keep my flat. If you want to move into that house, maybe Cormac will help you afford it.”
“The Burrow?”
“Do you think they’re ready for that?” Draco mused. “Maybe we should wait until New Years.”
“Why don’t you pick out a guy,” Draco offered. “And then I’ll go over and talk to him, get the ball rolling, and you can come over and insert yourself into the conversation. That way there’s less pressure on you to make the first move.”
By the time they make it to the Hogwarts Express, things are heating up. Or at least Draco wishes they would. Draco specifically goes looking for Harry on the train (an action that will eventually become a habit for both parties) and offers Harry his (morally questionable) friendship. With this seemingly innocuous question, Draco’s villain origin story begins, and we’ve entered into the Enemies/Rivals phase of our ship. Draco wants to be friends, Harry declines, and Draco immediately retaliates by making fun of Harry because he’s hurt and that’s how he deals with embarrassment. Mocking Harry Potter becomes his defense mechanism to hide the fact that he was upset by rejection.  This particular moment will fuel Draco’s path through the Enemy/Rival phase.
“Yes, just what every man who’s dumped by his school time sweetheart when she realizes she prefers girls to boys dreams of.” Harry replies, not missing a beat despite the topic of conversation.
“The beat so phat, gonna make me cum,” Pansy shouted as she grabbed Ginny by the waist.  Draco threw a pillow at the couple as they danced their way out of his bedroom. He sighed, and rolled out of bed to get ready for yet another Saturday spent working for Oliver Wood.
"Then why would they trust you with it? Surely there's someone more adept at potions."
“First, you expressed concerns about your current health. As you know, Madam Promfrey is a skilled healer, and I’m sure she will be up to the task of monitoring your health. We also have an accomplished potions master at Hogwarts, who will be able to make the wolfsbane potion for you each month.  This wouldn’t be the first time that we had a werewolf teaching at Hogwarts, and Remus seemed to do just fine. I strongly believe that you are capable of doing more than moping around Grimmauld Place. I think it would be good for you to interact with other people, and your extensive experience fighting the Dark Arts would be beneficial for all of the students to learn from.”
Draco drummed his fingers on the table at the head of the Great Hall. The sorting ceremony and feast had always bored him. There had never been a lot of excitement for him regarding house selection, considering he had known he’d sort Slytherin since he was old enough to comprehend words. And though time had passed since his days in Hogwarts, the association of Slytherin and evil hadn’t gone away nor ceased to upset him.  Honestly, he couldn’t wait for it to be over so he could just get on with his life. Just as he was about to completely zone out, McGonagall’s death stares be damned, someone burst through the doors and caught everyone’s attention.
And then there’s the Marauder’s Map. Harry literally spends hours in front of the room of requirement trying to get in, he ignores his friend’s birthday because he’s too busy looking at the map, and goes out of his way to stalk Draco:
“No,” said Harry and Ron together.
“You will,” Ginny said. “But for now, we’ll just dance as two friends who used to date. Shouldn’t be awkward at all.” Ginny smirked as Harry pulled her a little closer.
“You do know that I am right here. I can hear everything you’re saying about me.” Draco interrupted.
Draco was pleased to see, when he looked at his silver watch, that it wasn’t even midnight yet. McLaggen had sent him an annoyed owl earlier telling him that if he wasn’t done with work by 11:30 then he shouldn’t bother coming over. But Draco wasn’t that late, and after his day at work dealing with Oliver and then running into Potter, he really wasn’t in the mood to go back to his apartment right away. It would be much easier to ignore his thoughts if he was in somebody else’s bed.
“That’s very dishonest of you,” Harry said through gritted teeth.
“He isn’t-” Draco and Harry said simultaneously.
But luck was rarely on Draco’s side, and a few weeks after Christmas, Oliver requested his presence in one of the conference rooms.  This was unusual, only because Draco was the one in charge of scheduling meetings and the calendar was empty.   Draco entered the room, and fought the urge to walk right back out when he saw that Percy and Harry were also in attendance. Harry tried to silently get Draco’s attention, but Draco stubbornly refused to look his way.
“I think he gets it, ‘Mione. You’ve only said it a couple hundred times.” Ron said, placing his arm around Hermione and patting Harry on the back.  “You’re going to be brilliant at Hogwarts.  Plus, you might even get the chance to mess with Filch or Peeves.” Ron winked as Hermione huffed.
“Okay….”
“I want somebody to like me for me.” Harry sighed. “I want somebody who looks at me and sees someone other than ‘the-boy-who-lived and...the boy-who-lived, again.’”
“You’re writing to Pansy to give The Prophet a scoop on what it’s like to sleep with the-boy-who-lived?” Harry was furious. “So you don’t want to be my boyfriend but you’re fine with telling the entire world that you slept with me? Did you only invite me home that night after the bar because you figured you could get a nice paycheck from a gossip column out of it?”
“Oh, I have. For instance, I have learned that first impressions aren’t everything.” Harry leaned in towards Draco.
“You’re the one who walked into me,” Draco sneered. “
“He didn’t tell us much about it,” Ginny answered. “Just that he didn’t want to be an assistant forever and maybe it was time to take a risk and do something he actually wanted to do.”
Another little moment of Drarry, actually happens near the beginning of the story.  Harry is sorting through his trunk to decide what to bring on his adventure and what to throw away.  While doing this, he comes across an old badge in the bottom of his trunk. Yes, it’s the
The last thing that Oliver heard as he grabbed the kettle and felt the customary, but unpleasant, tug of the portkey was Draco calling out: “Oh, and Oliver! I quit!”
If the analysis for the next few chapters sounds familiar, it’s because Harry Potter still hasn’t figured out his feelings, and Draco Malfoy is still dealing with his by mercilessly making fun of Harry. In my personal head canon, by the second book Draco Malfoy has figured out that he has romantic feelings for Harry. There’s not really definitive proof of that because Harry’s POV does not allow for that sort of realization, so WHEN Draco figures it out is a personal decision by the shipper, but narratively it makes sense that Draco would be more in touch with his feelings than Harry and it would happen earlier on for Draco than for Harry.
Harry limped over to his bed and collapsed into it.  He knew he was expected at the feast in a few hours, where he’d have to plaster a fake smile on his face and pretend to be normal for the students. He’d briefly considered pulling a Mad-Eye and being cranky and mysterious… Then he remembered that that had really been Barty Crouch Jr. and determined that might not be the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor he’d want to emulate.  Especially given all that he now had in common with another of his DADA professors.
“It looks like both of us got stood up for our work meetings,” Oliver said, finally checking the time. “I was supposed to continue my meeting over dinner at La Sirene. The reservation is pretty soon and I know it’s really hard to get in there, I’d hate to waste it. Would you want to join me?”
“You’d think you’d be less of a bore this far removed from Hogwarts, but I suppose you’ve always been a beacon of dullness. Some things don’t change, I guess.” Oliver shrugged and watched Percy’s face turn just the slightest bit red.
“Err, right, sorry.” Harry said, mentally kicking himself for apologizing to Draco, of all people. “No, we set this muggle account up back when we were still dating for emergencies, and it’s too much of a hassle to change it. Plus, it’s not like either of us uses it that much. Just when I need to get fucking diner food at 9pm for my fucking boss. She must have had a muggle-money related emergency and didn’t replenish the funds.” And then, Harry Potter, kicked the brick wall.
They each placed their order when the waiter came over to check on them, and before they knew it the chicken tikka masala, lamb kabobs, and naan were placed in front of them. Harry dove in greedily, and Draco took a dignified bite.
“You’re firing me.” Harry repeated.
“Delivery for Percy Weasley.” The wizard said. He had a large bouquet of flowers in one arm and handed Harry a delivery slip to sign with his other. Harry signed his name without much thought, put the flowers on Percy’s desk and sprinted to the lifts. Draco was waiting in the atrium with his winter coat and scarf.
“Just take it Potter. Let off some Davies related steam, I’ll just go sit over there,” Draco waved in the direction of the makeshift bleachers and sulked over, as Harry hesitantly accepted the broom.
At some point before Harry confronts Draco in a bathroom, he runs into Moaning Myrtle and she describes a boy who is
“Clearly I was, Malfoy.  That’s how I recognized how badly it was going. It’s not as if all of us were trained to pick up on subtleties to exploit later.” Harry said.
“He was just trying to cheer me up, Hermione.” Harry answered. “So, what happens now?”
“You know that all I do is bestow greater knowledge on you,” Draco started, “My thought is that we have two bosses who are entirely too obsessed with work, right?”
“I know that, but don’t I deserve a say?  Isn’t this supposed to be the most important day of our lives?” Harry ran his hands through his already mussed hair in frustration. “The whole reason we fought a war was to have a chance to really live.”
“No, Potter, you wouldn’t want to know what I
“I told you Cormac was a jerk,” Harry said, approaching Draco after the match was over and handing him his broomstick.
******************
The reader, luckily, doesn’t have to wait for Harry Potter to figure out that Draco is already starting to feel remorseful.  In the very first chapter, we get to see into Malfoy Manor and how Draco is starting to understand that life under Voldemort isn’t as grand as he was raised to believe.
The pair was smart enough to nod solemnly. Draco set down his empty goblet and braced his hand on the back of his chair to stand up, trying to look less intoxicated than he felt.
obsessed with Draco but it wasn’t just starting now…it was for most of the book.
Draco groaned as he fumbled with his keys and finally unlocked the door to his flat.  He used to enjoy the reduced workload that came from Oliver being preoccupied with fake bliss and Percy, but now all it did was give him more time to ruminate on how lonely he was.  As if missing Cormac wasn’t frustrating enough, he was also beginning to think Harry might have been right about coming clean to Percy and Oliver. They were set to close on the row-house Draco and Harry had seen in three days and Draco felt like he, maybe, owed it to Oliver to keep him from making such a lasting commitment with someone who was as shady as Percy.
The gold colour gleamed off the surface of the symbol, into Harry’s eyes. The movement was encapsulating, hypnotic. He blinked, coming back into focus.
“Goodbye, Harry,” said Malfoy, and turned before Harry could answer, heels clacking on the cobblestones.
Satisfied, Hermione leaned back. “Of course we’ll meet him Harry,” she told him, ignoring the slightly strangled sound coming from the bedroom. “Just owl me a time.”
He sighed. “I’m curious, alright?”
It was Harry’s turn to raise his brows graciously. He did, enjoying it a little too much as Malfoy stared at him.
“What makes you want to fuck?”
“You and your writing,” Malfoy said fondly, and then stood up. The (pink) table rocked a bit. “Harry. Charlie. Let’s go.”
Malfoy said in a high, reedy voice, “
“Yes,” said Oceania, “I dare you to eat an entire pack of blue cheese.”
Malfoy leaned a little closer. Anyone else watching would have hardly noticed it. Harry noticed it.
Sex with men has always been nice, too. It’s been awhile, but she and Ginny were in love once, or thought they were, or something – and it was nice, so nice. Good. Lovely. But with Malfoy, it’s like discovering what sex is supposed to be – sex is not supposed to be nice. Sex is not supposed to be a fun way to greet each other in the morning, or a couple of orgasms here and there – it is not about pleasure. It is about power. It’s about letting go of reality – who you are in the sack is not the same person as who you are out and about. It’s about want – it’s about how what you want can be traced back to what you hate. Want and hate. It’s the same energy, just dressed up differently.
“Urm,” said Harry, “Why does everyone keep bringing the gay thing up?”
“A big one,” Oceania added.
“I…it’s just, I think I might be bisexual.”
But he had promised Draco this.
Harry made eye contact with Malfoy. Malfoy raised a brow.
“You don’t give the impression of wanting to give anything at all,” he said quietly, and then tugged a knee up to wrap his arm around. “You just let people think what they do.”
Harry rubbed at his jaw. “I think, maybe, that it’s about not being the person I want to be? Or maybe, just realising all of that, quite suddenly.”
“Malfoy,” said Harry. “You’re vibrating like a toothbrush.”
“Oh,” said Draco. “I didn’t know you would be here.”
“Mm,” said Harry. “I bet I could fuck him up.”
“It’s mostly Draco that calls it that.” Hayden was still using that careful voice. “He reckons the dragons attract them.”
“Malfoy,” says Harry again, stupidly, staring at her, feeling compelled, for some reason, to say things, without actually knowing what things.
“I’m just…” Harry sucked in a breath. “Just…”
When Draco kissed him again, he was already full of his own submission. He felt dizzy with it. He racked up the jumper and slid his hand up Draco’s spine, fitting easily along the dip. Draco’s tongue got messy. His hips and thighs opened up and bracketed Harry, and then he was open to it.
Tom smiled at him. “Hi Harry,” he said. “Yes, I do know you. Draco always had a lot to say about you.”
The next day, Draco came around. They were in the kitchen making sandwiches when he knocked.
“One more time,” he said, softer. “Deep breath in. Yes, there. Then out.”
“What are you looking at?” He asks.
“I’ll see you around,” Malfoy said. He was looking right at him. Had he been looking right at him this entire time?
His footsteps were brisk on the stairs. Harry took the hint and went to wait in the living room.
“If it’s just Draco that doesn’t like magic,” Harry began to ask, “how come no one else almost never does as well?”
Apparently, the outfits were representative of the “light” that replaced the “darkness.” Then there were more dancers, one in a blue mask and one with a beard, and then some red pills were handed out with wine, the latter of which Harry felt himself go a little queasy at and had to decline.
“What about me?”
like that.
Harry looked between the two of them. “Are you two…” he began, and then stopped.
“There you go,” said Oceania, and then they were pushing back into one-legged dog and doing some weird tipping thing with their legs and hips and Harry definitely felt like he shouldn’t be doing this. It was all wrong. Something was inside of him, tight and resisting. He swallowed.
Malfoy shook his head slowly, his forehead dragging over Harry’s shoulder. Then he said: “You just can’t think for yourself, Harry Potter.”
He suddenly realised he had been quiet for too long. He was here to help Malfoy. Hastily, he tried to remember his own process when meditating.
“Just,” he agreed.
Harry took a sip of his beer. Malfoy took a sip of his Russian.
Draco was silent for a moment. Harry had to close his eyes.
“Yes, well.” He sniffed. “I suppose you’re welcome.”
“You’re not even doing my mouth,” Harry protested, but tried to flatten his muscles all the same. Malfoy’s finger just kept rubbing. Eventually, it disappeared, and when it came back, it was sharp and pointy and not very finger-like at all.
“No, no.” says Potter, shaking her head, black hair getting everywhere. “I mean, we did, for a while – because during the war, it was hard to find places to stay, as you know – but then they got married-“
“When you close your eyes,” said Harry. “Pretend that I’m not here. Or that I’m not – you know, me. I’m just – a voice inside you. I’m not something else.”
I know, at this point updating is the fanfic equivalent of attending a high school reunion, but in case anyone cares, I was in the middle of my first original and wildly different novel and getting jobs and general upheaval in my personal life, and you get it, shit happens. But as consolation, this is a long fucking chapter.
“I guess,” he said, when Luna didn’t speak.
Harry closed his eyes for a brief moment, and then took an extraordinarily long sip of coke. Even Oceania was trying not to laugh. She was trying to hide it, but he could see her, biting down on the edge of her glass and shaking.
“That’s a weird kink Potter.”
Zambini grinned widely, like a shark in a very elegant suit. “You can call me Blaise, Harry.”
The sun was as orange as a peeled grapefruit in the sky. Almost bloody – freshly born out of the mountains. Harry looked, and he looked. The wind rustled past his ears, dancing through his hair. It was getting long. Maybe the first thing he would do when he got back would be to get a haircut.
He took the train in. He lived so near the city centre that it was only a few stops for him. On the train, he stared firmly out the window, feeling like everyone was watching him even though he knew they couldn’t be.
Hermione rolled her eyes. Harry slapped him on the back.
He went over. Draco was leaning against the beginning slope of the nearest mountain, sprawled amongst the grass with two books and a half-eaten plate of bao zi spread around him. He wasn’t reading the books. He was staring up at the sky, his head resting in his hands behind him.
“Come where?”
“Fuck,” he said, taking it in. “I can see.”
Next to the contents page there was a large, scratchy drawing of a dragon with a sun halo. Harry glanced up at Draco, but he was already immersed in his own reading. Harry skipped down the contents list cursively, before his eyes caught on chapter twelve:
"For the project."
“I thought I apologised for that,” said Harry. He was frowning, suddenly, like he’d lost his footing, and seeing him like any fight left in Draco dissolve, easy as butter in a pan.
The blush was climbing back up Malfoy’s throat. “You just miss the maid outfit.”
It had taken twenty minutes to attach the elaborate ensemble that Harry was now wearing, which consisted of a corset, a waistcoat, shorts, thigh highs, knee and elbow pads, a choker that looked suspiciously like a dog collar, gloves, some weird strappy things that Harry was fortunate enough to not know the name of, and finally, socks. The corset wasn’t done up right and Harry had drawn a hard, hard line at thongs, but all in all, Malfoy should be so fucking grateful.
There it was. There it was. Harry closed his eyes and leaned into her more. Her hair smelt like pears against his face.
“You heading?” asked Harry.
“I’m not saying I predicted the context!” said Hermione, throwing her hands in the air. “I mean, there are definitely…elements I didn’t see coming. But…” She turned back to Harry, putting one hand over his. “It’s a bit full circle, isn’t it?”
“That’s alright,” said Hayden, and then dissolved into giggles again, “God, that’s cute.”
“What would you like?” he asked. Harry looked at his throat, and then looked away. The lighting was weird in here.
Pansy just rolled her eyes. She drank some more of her whiskey.
“That’s alright babyface,” said Draco, leaning back against one of the counters. “I already ate. But I got you flowers.”
Harry turned back to the sky. The silence was easy, comfortable.
“It’s not like I’m leaving you!” Harry’s voice was incredulous. “It’s not like…why are you acting like this is, this is…so personal?”
“Dragons,” said Harry, “I think that’s what I want. Dragons.”
unfair. Why are you here? Why are you here
Harry brought himself back up. He watched Malfoy stretch like a cat, and then waited for everyone else to leave so he could help him put away the mats. Oceania gave him a thumbs up as he passed, swaying slightly to the music as she went to turn it off.
His voice was thick. Malfoy said, “What would you want me to ask?”
“There’s nothing wrong with it,” Harry said quickly. “There’s nothing wrong with being strange.”
Draco felt his whole body heat. “Oh.”
“Come
The crowd seemed like a much smaller thing from up here. He could see the people who were dancing, the people who were drunk. The people who were touching. He wasn’t sure, but he thought he saw two men together at the edge of the crowd. He thought he saw two women as well. He could definitely see some men and women together.
Despite himself, Harry smiled. Malfoy slapped at his cheek.
“But you’re both telling stories,” Harry pointed out.
“So how long are you planning on staying?” Charlie asked conversationally as they made their way up.
“’Bout a couple months,” said Charlie. “Some keep at it for a couple years. Been here myself for a while. I’m thinking of heading off to Malaysia or somewhere in a while though. Like to keep moving.” He flashed Harry a quick grin.
He gestured up and down Harry’s body. Harry blinked, and then began to laugh.
“How’d you end up here anyway?” says Potter. “All by yourself? In a cottage like this?”
This running didn’t look like healthy running. He couldn’t even tell if it was helping. The familiar compression in his chest and nature smells weren’t calming him this time. It only felt like his body couldn’t keep up with his mind.
“Sorry,” he said, and waved to put some more on.
“When have I disrespected you?” he asked quietly.
“You’re such a
“Okay,” said Harry, and then he kissed him.
Harry realised, belatedly, that the moment was slipping him by. “Wait,” he said. “I actually meant to ask you. I forgot to get video footage last time.”
“Charlie,” he said faintly, “I think, perhaps, that you are my soulmate.”
“Of course you are dearie,” said Oceania, reaching up to pat his head.
He kept pushing, further into the forest. If he got hurt here, would anybody even find him? His feet began to stumble as he sped up, his breathing too loud. Everywhere, trees. More trees. He was never going to get out.
Harry laughed.
“Did you not?” They finally sat down and crossed one elegant leg over the other. “A secret is hardly secret if it’s sauntering around the place and flexing its muscles.”
Another time, Draco asks:
They kept kissing, one of Harry’s wonderful hands now cupping the back of Draco’s head, his fingers buried in white hair. Draco completely melted under his body. The other hand reached down and rubbed him through his trousers.
“Absolutely,” said Harry. “But now –” he patted his chest with his hand, “ – now it’s a sort of spiritual confusion.”
said Harry.
Malfoy’s eyes stopped fluttering and were yanked back to meet Harry’s. It had been a harsh thing to say; Harry could see it in the wideness of Malfoy’s deadly sober eyes, the clenched tendon in his jaw. It had been a harsh thing to say – but Malfoy had said a similar thing to him earlier.
Harry raised his brows at
“I’ve been well,” Draco said evenly, folding his long hands on his lap. “And you?”
“Does Draco know?” Harry asked before he could stop himself.
“Prick,” he muttered into Harry’s ear. He felt him grin against his shoulder.
Malfoy bit his lip. Then he peered forward.
Malfoy shrugged. He wasn’t smiling, but he wasn’t cold, either. “You’re doing forward fold wrong.”
After a few minutes the path widened and Malfoy fell back, letting Harry catch up with him. They were walking side by side now. Harry could feel his tongue in his mouth.
Harry didn’t know why he was doing it. There was no reason for him too. If he really wanted to communicate with Draco, he certainly could. He hadn’t yet. But he could. So there was really no reason for him to do this.
Malfoy grinned. His eyes flicked back down, sticking to a spot just beneath Harry’s throat. Then he glanced off into the trees again and bit his lip down.
“Just Osh,” she said, and winked. “Let’s get this party started.”
Malfoy had gone still, and then he was metres away, fussing with used cups. “Why do you ask these things Potter?” he muttered, his voice low, and it was almost like he was talking to himself.
There was a few beats where they just stared each other, both red-skinned and wide-eyed. Then Harry felt the warmth drip down his jaw, and realised he was crying again. He brought his hand to his face.
“Like what you see?” came a familiar drawl.
Harry blinked. Then he nodded and looked away again. Everything was a blur of sensation, and the crowd still looked so small.
“Is that actually a thing?” says Harry. “I’ve always wondered.”
Oceania snorted into his chest. “Oh, leave him alone you two. He’s not even straight.”
Harry rolled his eyes, but the effect was probably lost in the middle of so much movement. The girl Malfoy had been talking to passed him her glass before disappearing, and Malfoy shrugged before downing half and passing it to Harry. Harry smiled at him over the rim.
“Oh my god,” Harry had said after a beat, “You’re really going to make me do this.”
Malfoy was still quiet, so Harry lifted a hand and ran it through his hair. He’d expected it to be dry, but it felt quite soft. He twirled a loop around a finger and stared at the curious contrast between stark white and warm brown.
“I wonder why,” said Hayden. They took the coffee cup from Malfoy’s hand and then frowned down at it when they realised it was empty.
“It…” Harry ransacked his brain. “It’s…an abuse of authority. You’re my teacher.”
Harry bit his lip. “Something about being brave,” he said quietly.
“That’s a bit rich,” Malfoy pointed out, “For someone in Gay Dragon Village.”
Benjamin pointed between the two of them with a lip gloss applicator. “Should I leave you two alone?”
“I am.” Malfoy’s voice went low and sort of syrupy. “You should see how they beg for it.”
said Malfoy, and suddenly he sounded wounded too. “Can’t you – won’t you tell me what’s wrong?”
Potter frowns. “Do you have any sugar?”
Harry frowned from where he was situated flat on his stomach on a mat next Malfoy. “I don’t know how you can do that right now.”
The thundering grew louder.
“Urm,” he said. “Okay.”
“What?” Malfoy’s head whipped around. “What did you say?”
Although Harry loved her deeply, and fully supported Oceania’s exploration of her own sexuality, there was not a single part of him that wanted to witness any part of it. It would be like hearing Hermione and Ron fuck, and as soon as he had this thought he wanted to douse his head in bleach and pry open the mouth of a pissed off dragon, before merrily walking down its throat and shuffling off this mortal coil and all the firing neurons in his brain.
There were huge, swirling sunflowers blooming across the plastered length, sweeping across the light fixtures, and behind them was a vibrant, deep-set blue. They reminded Harry of something he had seen before, but he wasn’t going to pretend to know about art.
“Those aren’t teeth,” Harry protested. “It just has a prominent mouth.”
Draco breathed a laugh, but the sound of it almost ached.
“You’re sorting them by mat thickness,” said Harry, and then paused, “And did you just…”
“Make it really gay,” said Hayden, who Harry had mistakenly pegged as an ally.
“You can have it, if you like,” she encouraged.
“Just say I’m on the team.”
Harry swallowed. Malfoy’s finger continued to move. It was a strange sensation. He couldn’t remember the last time someone had touched his face.
Harry raised a brow to himself at the use of the word “camera.” The grass they were standing on was so thick and green he wanted to sit down on it, so he did. Malfoy turned to look down at him.
He knocked before going in the bedroom. Oceania wrenched the door wide open.
“You know,” Harry remarked to Draco as they watched on. “Sometimes I think she and Hayden gave me something an awful lot stronger all those months ago, and that the rest of this is just a hallucination.”
Harry opened his mouth to speak and then stopped. Closed it and swallowed. Malfoy was here, white and skinny and naked and still wet from walking into a loch at night and somehow, that all didn’t seem quite so significant. What he’d said had changed the way Harry looked at his expression.
Harry nodded. He was holding Malfoy’s eyes. Malfoy frowned.
wanted for himself.
Draco sounded amused. “That won’t be necessary.” He rubbed the precum into the slit with his thumb.
Draco stood up. The chair screeched back. They all stared at him.
“Must we be such stereotypes?”
Malfoy looked up, chewing, his eyes sly in a way Harry had learnt at a very young age to not trust.
“I’m trying to be brave.” His heart was hammering in all of his limbs. “Like you told me to be.”
Draco pointed his wand at his hand. It filled with oil. Then he moved so that he was kneeling between Harry’s open legs on the edge of the sofa.
“You can silence me,” Delia warned. “You can’t silence the longing hymns of the heart.”
“Yeah.” Malfoy licked his mouth and wiped his upper lip with the side of his hand. “You?”
“I don’t love you as much,” Draco replied reflexively, and then looked very angry with himself.
“Yes,” said Tom, starting to look a little exasperated, and also a little amused. “Draco knows.”
“Well, aren’t you just strapping,” she said. “I’m really glad you went for black instead of pink now. It really gives you more of a dominatrix feel.”
“Yeah,” said Harry. It came out sounding relieved. “Yeah, yeah, I’m here now.”
“Harry,” says Draco.
Harry closed his eyes. The world was dark and private again, just for a moment. Then he opened them to the living lights. The only goal here was pleasure.
“It’s just Draco,” said Hayden, “He loves to talk about the gay thing.”
“I think you try very hard not to be,” she said pleasantly.
“...That’s part of the fun though. You never know if you’re going to get good ones or bad ones.”
Was that it? There were always reasons to be unhappy, small reasons, small misfortunes to endure. And maybe some of the reasons weren’t small, but even so, they didn’t seem to explain the sensation of the vast open ocean of despair that was always tugging at his chest, even during the better moments, even when he could almost call himself happy –
It would drown him. It would drown everything.
“It’s on the floor,” he said to one of the strange locks.
So she does, she winds her arms there and lower, gripping Harry’s hips and buttocks in her hands, and Harry mumbles against Draco’s lips and presses her thigh right into her.
“Urm.” Malfoy ran a hand through his hair. “No. I suppose I just don’t know why you’re doing it.”
“But you should tell me about your spiritual awakening,” Luna told him.
“Well I’m glad you’re having fun,” grumbled Malfoy. He was clinging to the thermos like a life-band. “We don’t have to do this if you don’t want to.”
“I’m not telling you you have to open the letter. Forget the letter. Just… remember why you came here. Okay?”
Pansy narrowed her eyes, but it was mostly thoughtful as opposed to suspicious. “I think he is a writer, “she said finally, “in as much as he enjoys it. That’s clear enough, when you read it. But in terms of skill, he’s a bit amateur. I suppose that’s okay though. Draco thinks that kind of thing should be raw, anyway, whatever that means.”
“But if these years have taught me anything it is this: you can never run away. Not ever. The only way out is in.”
“The persimmons are better here than in Tesco,” said Oceania casually as they progressed to the bread section. She picked up a loaf and narrowed her eyes at it.
Oceania blushed even harder and wandered into the adjacent kitchen to fumble with the tea pot. “He’s silly,” she muttered to Harry, jerking her head in Malfoy’s direction. “You’re silly!” she said, louder.
“No,” said Harry.
“What are you going to do now?” Hermione asked. She had grown up since Hogwarts too.
“I think this was a mistake,” Malfoy said.
“Really, Osh?” One of his knees hit Harry in the face as he tried to look up at her. “You’re really going to come for me when I’m the only thing between you and your next life as a single blade of grass?”
Harry raised both brows. “Are you?”
The sun was in their eyes. Harry didn’t care. They both listened as Oceania scrambled into a more secure position in order to drape the now very crumpled paperchains around the lion sculpture.
Harry grinned wider. “No,” he said. “No, that’s just bungee jumping and fire walks.”
Now, he heard Malfoy shuffle on the grass next to him, and he was pretty sure Malfoy was on side, looking at him. He didn’t dare open his eyes.
“Okay,” he allowed. “You can take care of yourself. But I haven’t very open with you, have I?”
It rushed back in the form of the corridor of Grimmauld Place. Harry had dropped his hand; he was already sauntering down to the kitchen, shrugging off his robes. His shoulder blades were insistent against the thin cotton of his shirt. Draco had to blink his eyes closed for a moment.
“Mm,” said Charlie around the fruit juice straw, before putting it down. “I guess. We did a fire-walk once. That was fun.”
Harry swallowed hard, in the middle of his throat. A silence passed him by.
Harry had never seen Malfoy like this. Not ever, not even when they were at Hogwarts. The red had bloomed across his face, a violent, ugly red. His lips were stretched tight, his eyes alight. Harry didn’t even know someone could look that angry.
“What? Why?”
Now Malfoy looked at him. His eyes weren’t as big as Harry remembered, but they were clear all the same.
said Harry.
“There is no time to eat all of those. Put back three.”
Harry looked at Malfoy again, betrayed. Malfoy had finally looked up, and he blinked away from Harry’s stare a little guiltily.
“Morning,” Harry offered.
“You were cast out.”
Harry looks up at Draco, emerald eyes scorching into her own, her mouth a swollen rubicund and her skin damp and warm and black where the strands of her hair cling desperately in wild little whorls to her pores, and she tips forward and presses her mouth against the white curls beneath Draco’s stomach. Draco inhales harshly, and runs her fingers over Harry’s forehead, wiping back the strands. And then Harry nudges Draco’s thigh to the side, and opens her mouth against Draco’s crotch.
“I wasn’t the same,” he admitted. “Without you. I was okay. But I wasn’t happy. Not in the way I was when you were there.”
“No,” Harry got out, between laughs. “I just like the name Jane.”
“Knitting,” said Draco, turning his attention back to Harry. He looked quite serious. Oceania turned back to her tomatoes.
He eventually came to a tall, unstable looking building that was covered entirely with painted green tiles that looked like they might all come sliding down at any minute. He blinked, and then pushed on the heavy door, finding himself inside a dingy little room, lit by flickering lamps and draped with patterned scarves. There was no furniture save for a broken wooden stool in the corner, and reception desk, behind which sat a blonde woman with bows in her hair. She looked up at Harry, and frowned.
If Harry blushed any further he might simultaneously catch fire. It would probably be for the best. “Just,” he said. “Like. All the obvious stuff. You know. Their hair. And figures. And like, legs.”
Harry had to admit it was pretty cool, in a sort of goth way. He didn’t know what he had expected – snakes and emerald windows, maybe. He stepped around the coffee table to get a better look at the Gene Bilbrew print.
(See the end of the chapter for
“On the stage,” Harry said absentmindedly. Malfoy gave him a bewildered look, and then swirled around to behold the wonder that was indeed Oceania, at her full Osh potential. She was up on the small reflective stage, shimmying around, Putin’s tutu-clad form swaying back and forth the bouncing crowd like a lantern guiding a lost ship home. As they both watched in unequivocal appreciation, Oceania squatted to her knees and began to shake her body in a way that made the tutu move rather explicitly. The crowd went wild.
“I lied,” she crooned.
“Breathe in and out,” said Tom. “Deep breath in, long exhale out. Let your body relax deeper into the silence.”
The green indicator light flashes on.
“Molly?” said Hayden.
I ask to get my pearly white ass beat. But this? Really? It’s the
“Draco.” His throat was dry.
“That’s fair,” said Blaise.
now, but it was too late to back down. He was already here.
“Ready?” he said, tugging at the hem of his t-shirt. It was sky blue, and clearly part of a matching set with his leggings. Harry found the idea of Malfoy having both exercise leggings and then everyday leggings incredibly amusing.
Harry just smiled. He felt like he should be surprised. But something about this felt as inevitable as everything else that had happened.
“A tea cosy,” Oceania replied immediately. “I haven’t got one with a dolphin on it yet.”
“Mmm,” Oceania smiled and wriggled over, so that one of Charlie’s knees was freed.
share things with each other.”
“Yeah,” he said softly. “Maybe I am.”
“Sure,” said Draco. “Shall we sit on the dragons’ laps, or do they have boyfriends?”
He took him back to his room. It looked just as messy as Draco had thought it would be, but was otherwise a lot more humble and ordinary. Something about the space was self-aware, as if it knew it would never be a home.
After a few more moments, he sat straight up and turned the light on. He rubbed at his eyes, the yellow light pricking through the red of his eyelids, and then turned out of the bed and padded across the carpet, trying to find his socks from the day before.
“You win,” he told her. She beamed at him.
“I like that you wear muggle clothes.” Potter’s voice seems to be growing louder. “I like that you make tea in the morning.”
,” answered Hayden, and then they bit their lip. It flushed white where their teeth dug in. “But I believe in healthy doses of selfishness, don’t you?”
“Harry,” she says, dragging her lips across her face. “Harry, love –“
And he disappeared back into the corridor without another word.
When they came back ways up Harry put the thought of gentle flying towards Jane, phrasing it as a question. She did three more twirls before inclining her neck under Harry’s palm and straightening up. Suddenly the world shuddered back to rightness, and they were drifting horizontally along.
Malfoy scowls, banishing away the glasses instantly and crossing her arms over her chest.
“Look,” he had said to Mayo when they were flying around Yoga Mountain, “I’ve got to feel this. It’s not right not to.”
She comes to with a gasp, choking back on the rattling inside her throat, grabbing at her shoulders and cheeks and the sides of her head and pants for breath, her chest closing in on her –
Oceania took another bite and said, with her cheeks full: “I was thinking I could help you.”
Oceania pulled back to look down her long nose at him, which was pretty impressive considering her height. “Harry,” she said sternly. “Don’t tell you’ve started living your life in fear.”
“Shall we go find her?” asked Malfoy. “I have the most wonderful idea. I think she would like to hear it out.”
They both watched as the fingers on the hand relaxed.
again, but even he knew what little good that did either of them. Draco was just sitting there, on the other, drinking firewhiskey and loving him. Trying to understand it was like trying to understand the size of space, or how magic worked, or why he’d grown up in a closet.
And when they were there they both fell across the various sofas and Harry, quite drunk really now, rolled over to his side and said: “Osh, are you in love?”
He needed air.
, I –” There it was, that wounded sound again. It bled between them, unfinished. Harry held his breath even so. He knew, because it was wounded, that it would stay unfinished. The blue wanted to crest within him again, and he wanted to swallow it down.
“You heard me,” they said, and then spoke slowly, as if talking to a child. “Neither.”
Harry moaned. He wanted to come badly.
“Fuck you,” he said again, quieter, and then turned to look at where Oceania and Charlie and Counter Girl were still fucking about. He looked at all the empty alleys. He looked at the lights.
When he woke up, he was lying back against the mat, blinking up at the cracks in the ceiling. He sat up. Tom was holding a string of beads, a book with characters open in front of him. He looked over as Harry moved.
“We’ll take these too,” said Malfoy, before Harry could swipe his card. He was pushing a least twenty bottles of lube across the counter.
“Hermione, I think that’s quite a bit better.”
“That’s brilliant Harry,” said Tom, and the sound in his voice, so genuine and reassuring, popped the panic. Harry felt it wash away. He breathed.
“See.” Oceania jabbed Malfoy in the chest, who looked down at her fondly, which was a bit alarming to watch. “Hay’en knows how to embrace the pos’tive energy. Unlike
Harry closed his eyes. He reached out and took a sip of the coffee anyway and burnt his tongue. He opened his eyes.
Draco rolled his eyes for a full ten seconds. “Give those to me.”
He couldn’t help it; he rolled into Malfoy’s body. Malfoy made a small, desperate sound.
“Nothing.” Her fingers tapped on the desk. “Fancy a coffee break? I haven’t even had my third today.”
“Yeah.” Harry felt like the bulb in his throat had swelled. He looked away. “I know.”
Of course. He had been gone for a few hours. Probably.
Pansy levelled him a very knowing and borderline chiding look. Well – it would have been chiding if it wasn’t from Pansy. Her eyes were glittering.
Harry exhaled noisily and turned out of the storeroom.
Tom raised his brows. “How did I know I wanted to be a monk?”
Draco looks at her, her heart hammering in her chest, and then Harry slowly lowers her smile onto Draco’s mouth and kisses her again. Her body is hot and slow as it moves against Draco’s skin, and all Draco wants to do is wind her arms around to the small of her back and secure her there.
Harry stared.
“Alright, alright,” said Malfoy, rubbing at it. “There’s no need for that, really, be a doll now, won’t you?”
Harry couldn’t help himself: “Not what you expected?”
It was a far cry from the monochromatic severity of downstairs. There were feather boas everywhere, shimmer, sequins and powders and heels piled high on the double bed like a knicker-blocker. Malfoy and his friend picked up some palettes and brushes and resumed doing their makeup.
Draco looked at him, and knew something was going to happen. He could feel his hands shaking. He too had gotten braver, but you could only build from the ground up.
“Oh indeed.” The man was dark-skinned and had a round, bald head. He was wearing lashes the size of airplane wings. “What’s this?”
Harry laughed again. “When are you leaving?”
And he was saying, can I touch you?
“So you understand,” said Pansy, “that he is not the type made to weather rejection.”
“Me,” said Charlie, “Not Mum.”
“That
Malfoy did, shuddering slightly. A muscle in his jaw jumped. Harry reached forward and covered his right hand.
“I know you read.” Draco begins to climb back down the ladder.
At least Oceania had only given him the corner of the ceiling. The only way anyone would be focusing on his painting was if they sat down on the armrest of the sofa and immediately craned their head up. He tested this theory himself, and was forced to admit that the effect was somewhat alarming.
“Do a handstand holding a bowling ball between your legs,” said Malfoy, having apparently recovered from the Tom ordeal. “No. Wait. Go and hit on the lady behind the counter.”
“Alright Wizard Picasso,” said Draco. “Point stands.”
“Those bastards,” said Malfoy. Oceania grinned and gestured for them to follow her. They headed towards the neighbouring forest and took the same path that they had taken the first time Harry had gone drinking with them.
Malfoy’s lashes moved up and down again. “I was. I wasn’t. You know what they say. Give a man a gimp mask.” He straightened up abruptly, his hands moving wider apart on the sides of the table-top. “Oh, it’s such a bore to talk about school. I never knew you lived so close. There’s a café a few streets down that bakes wonderful bagels. They put halloumi in them, and this sauce – delectable. Do you like bagels, Harry?”
Pansy rolled her eyes, but it was fond. “You’re beyond bizarre, Harry Potter.”
He looked over at Malfoy, then again at his leggings. He wondered how many people had to leave in order to feel like themselves.
“Ah,” said Luna again. She stuck another spoonful of ice cream in her mouth.
Harry glared at him again, but it was half-hearted.
“I suppose…in that case,” He says after some serious deliberation. “…Another crepe wouldn’t hurt.”
Delia was a muggle. She didn’t know. They had joked about it, but she didn't know, not really, not like Ron or Hermione or Ginny. Her steady brown eyes were trained on him.
“It hurts,” said Harry, pressed a palm against his chest, right where his ribs met. “Here.”
“It’s alright, Harry.” Oceania had stopped smiling, but her eyes were warm. “Do whatever you have to.”
They went for a walk. The side of the mountain was beautiful, candy-green grass and crumbling rock, tiny pieces of it skittering over the edge and falling down into the village below. Harry followed Malfoy, his eyes stuck on his white head, the bend in his legs as they climbed. He didn’t know where they were going.
“Rowing?” asked Harry. “I thought you’d been gardening.”
Oceania replaced the bricks and the three of them scampered back around to the archway while Draco whistled the theme of mission impossible under his breath.
“I thought you didn’t like rules,” he said, after a moment, quietly.
Tom was looking at him. He also looked like he had figured something out, but he didn’t seem to mind the answer. When he saw that Harry was looking back, he smiled.
Of course, Draco’s bedroom turned out to be none of those things. One of the walls was pink, however.
“How do I say it?”
Malfoy slipped the handbook into his back pocket and straightened up. His own jeans were immodestly tight, Harry noticed. He was half-surprised the handbook didn’t pop back out.
Inevitably, it turned out that Malfoy was permanently located in the training space next to Harry’s.
“Once a slytherin, always a slytherin,” Oceania had quipped, “What colour of leather do you like best, Harry?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry!” he said, getting to his feet. “Sleep well? You’re up early.”
“Well, jeez Harry,” said Malfoy. “Think happy thoughts. I don’t know. Imagine quidditch. Kissing girls. Eating something other than cookies.”
Now that the crying had stopped, the silence had come back. Harry pulled a raw breath into his throat, past his collarbone and into his lungs. He pulled it back out.
Harry stepped back and Malfoy walked past him, not looking back to see if Harry was following him. Harry glanced one more time at the intensely organised mats, and then left as well.
Harry bit his lip and inhaled deeply. “Damn,” he said, once he’d gotten a tenuous grip. “Dammit. Am I really?”
“Just in a practical sense, you need her to trust you in order to look after her. It’s going to be your job, as her tamer, to check for injury and damage. See here,” Malfoy gestured with his other hand to the expanse of blue. “You can compare her wing to the diagram to make sure that it’s healthy. But you also need to familiarise yourself with her. Learn what’s normal in her, because normal is different for every individual.”
“You didn’t tell me where we were going,” Harry reminded him. “Are you actually pouting?”
Harry smiled back. Grateful.
“Like, it doesn’t matter how it feels. As long as it feels true.”
It’s terrifyingly easy to lie to the people you love. And Harry found that, after lying to them, you can’t quite love them the same anymore.
“Speaking of which,” Oceania blithely continued, “You will keep coming to the yoga class, won’t you?”
“Do you?” she retorted playfully, turning over to face him.
When he got there, he found Malfoy asleep on the sofa. His form was pale, and curled up small. He seemed the most breakable thing in the room.
Malfoy dropped his head, disappointed. “Yes.”
“Do you want to go for a walk later?” Oceania asked from where she was washing the tomatoes.
He blinked at it. When you got up this early, it felt like you were the only person in the world. He started to walk.
“So am I,” said Oceania, after a long moment in which Harry primarily stared at Draco’s left eyebrow. “Gender identity is very important.”
Harry swallowed against the dryness of his throat. “I don’t know,” he answered.
“Nothing,” said Harry. Nothing, nothing.
“Okay.”
“Draco,” said Harry.
Harry smirked, just a bit. “Why not?”
“Perhaps.”
“Oh,” he said.
Harry leaned against the door frame. “No,” he said. “Even if I had thought about it, I would still have got it wrong. You are –” He had thought he was going to say “too much to fit in my mind.” But halfway through he had realised he was going to say “unlike anyone I’ve ever known.”
Now Luna looked at him. For a moment, Harry thought she was going to say something else. But then she smiled. One of her front teeth was slightly wonky. Harry had never noticed before.
“She’s brilliant,” said Malfoy, from where he was leaning near the door. His arms were folded, and the smirk still wasn’t quite back in his eyes. He had come after all. “I keep telling her to try selling something.”
“I like that you just used a metaphor to talk about metaphors,” said Harry, “Very meta.”
“I like to order a glass of Merlot, but it’s better value if you get a bottle.”
“Everyone needs something to believe in.” says Draco, his voice soft, and he thinks that these beautiful places of worship aren’t really for the various muggle gods at all, but rather for themselves. God is just a place in your mind, and everybody needs beautiful places for their minds to go.
“You’ve not been adverse to my research before,” Harry points out, referring to her newfound awareness of the g-spot, something Draco didn’t exactly complain about.
“My,” he said, after a pause. “You really are learning your gAy-B-Cs.”
“She’s a delight,” said Malfoy, looking back at Harry, “If you think this one is spiritual when she’s sober, you should see her under the influence of pretty much anything.”
“I could say the same to you. Isn’t a little early to be giving orders?”
Harry opened his eyes, and they were green enough to be their own kingdom. “Brilliant,” he said, and smiled as if it were the easiest thing.
“How?” says Harry.
soup drinking?” Harry pushed himself up cross-legged next to Malfoy. “I’m not sure if I’m ready for this.”
“No,” said Hayden. “I’m planning to obliviate the cashier, and then apparate with the trolley.”
“Oh.” says Potter. “That’s okay. Sugar. Who needs it?” She laughs uncomfortably, and glances around the room.
So. Harry likes girls.
Harry managed to keep himself quiet for a grand total of a whole thirty seconds.
“You know me,” says Malfoy. “I stepped on your face.”
Harry gave Malfoy a look. “He just told me he didn’t perform.”
He supposed there was something to be said for these old religions.
“Sure,” he said, shrugging. If he was going to do this, he might as well do it properly.
The door wrenched open. Oceania was standing there, dressed entirely in denim and what Harry guessed was every woman’s dream shade of ochre.
“Have you ever prayed before?”
He couldn’t help it. He looked over at Draco. He knew he shouldn’t, but – well.
It takes a couple more months after that for Harry to realise that she’s in love with Malfoy.
Draco. A history.”
Here Harry skipped through the next five pages to the sub-heading:
“But it’s true,” said Tom. He was also smiling at Harry, in that quiet way of his. “You’ve done so much growing, Harry.”
When they rounded up into the plaza, Malfoy was waiting there.
“Here,” he said, handing Harry the meat, “You have a go.”
Luna looked pleasantly surprised. “I’ve been wanting to make some more queer friends,” she told him.
Harry felt himself shift. “You said you weren’t yourself.”
“Sexy?”

Malfoy just kept looking at him evenly.
Because this place did attract an interesting hoard of people. Spiritual people were always a little odd to begin with, in Harry’s opinion (the fact that he was now somewhat spiritual had done nothing to change this, as he was decidedly odd himself), and spiritual people who were willing to travel to a somewhat obscure festival in a remote corner of the Himalayas were even more odd. Spiritual people who were willing to travel to a somewhat obscure festival in a remote corner of the Himalayas
“Oh no,” said Harry, “That’s okay.” His arm was still raw from where Jane had almost got him the day before.
“Oh no. Oh bloody fucking hell no.”
The blue wasn’t anything he could share. It was just there, in his body, and he didn’t want to think about it.
“Yes,” said Harry. From the corner of his eye, he saw Malfoy raise his brows.
“Yes,” said Harry. “It’s…an unearthing. An incredible one.”
“Malfoy.” Harry rolled his eyes. “I have heard of Wuthering Heights. Just like I’ve heard of Jane Eyre.”
“Time is circular,” Blaise informed her.
“Draco,” he said again, quietly. It scratched his throat on the way out.
“You should see yourself,” says Harry. “You should see yourself when you’re like this.” She pushes in, hard, and Malfoy yelps, eyes snapping open as her legs wrap around Harry’s waist.
“You don’t find it despicable?” was all he said after a moment. Harry frowned.
“Harry. Turn to the other diagrams then.”
“You’re doing it right now,” said Draco. “Prodding at the wound. Checking to see if it’s an entrance.”
And he was saying, are you okay Harry?
“Luna has to get back,” Blaise announced. He nodded towards her, grinning shrewdly. “She has tea to attend to.”
“No,” said Draco. “There’s my to-read stack, just over there.” He pointed to the stack. There were maybe twenty books in the stack, which was still a lot of books in Harry’s opinion, but still did not make up a particularly large fraction of all the books in the room.
It was the only way to ever really go, after all. The grass and mud, cold and compressed beneath the roughened bits of his feet. He felt it between his toes first, the change from ground to silt to water-surface; the gradual dampening, and then the sinking in. He was up to shins. He was up to his knees.
“I should spell it green.” Draco says dryly. Harry falls back onto her elbows and surveys the room.
“I don’t want to leave,” he whispered. “I just…”
“Malfoy,” said Harry, and the sound of it was a shock, too. “You have to relax.”
“I don’t know,” said Hermione, frowning a little. “Ron and I are quite different, aren’t we?”
“I remember Benjamin.”
Having his eyes closed hadn’t actually been that bad. Not compared to this. It was almost torturous, having Malfoy and his black eyelids, all up in his peripheral vision. Malfoy was applying some tickly black stick to his lashes. It made him blink furiously.
Pansy just made a sort of “mm” sound. She was observing Harry in a way that was so rakish he felt like he was deeply underperforming. He opened his mouth, and it was a faucet turned on.
“Come on.” He dropped down, gently taking Malfoy’s feet and getting them into the shoes. There was a sharp inhale, and a hand grabbed automatically onto Harry’s shoulder for balance. When he came back up, Malfoy seemed to be unable to look at him.
“Everything that’s magical about anyone is in your head,” said Hayden.
“The real question is where did you get leather socks?” Malfoy was murmuring behind him. “Where can
“If I go back there,” Harry said, with certainty, “and ask for Draco Malfoy’s picture, he will castrate me.”
Harry Potter fell back to the ground, and began to cry.
“I like the space,” she told him. “I like the space because it lets me make it mine.”
Malfoy hummed, a little considering sound. “I suppose you’ll send me a copy before it’s posted.”
“I wish you came with a handbook,” he said out-loud. “An instruction manual. How to Understand Draco Malfoy for Dummies, 101.”
“You tell me, baby,” he drawled.
“Is it what you expected?”
Harry sucks in a breath and glares at her.
“They’re always upset,” Malfoy said, sullenly, but helped her open a packet of persimmons, offering one to Harry. Harry declined.
“Because of Jane?”
“You know,” he said, in an attempt to rescue them from the general tenseness, “the way you guys talk sometimes makes me feel like I’m lucid dreaming.”
“Life’s a circle,” he said after a long moment. Harry slapped his hands cartoonlike over his forehead.
Harry waited again.
“You told me to trust you,” Harry reminded him, trying not to sound to accusative and failing.
“Turn out the lights,” he instructed from under the duvet. Harry did, and climbed into the temporary bed. The pillow was silk, he was pretty sure.
“Bloody fucking bao zi,” said Harry, “I was really counting on the hallucinating thing.”
“What did you want to borrow me for?” he asked, disrupting the curiously tense atmosphere.
“Urm,” said Harry. “Will I?”
Harry reached out and gripped Blaise’s hand. “I am very, very human,” he said, looking him dead in the eye.
“Okay, Draco.” says Harry, steering his crestfallen boyfriend towards the exit and away from the narrow-eyed museum curator. “Let’s go get some ice cream.”
“Do you want to take that off?” he asked, nodding at Malfoy’s waterproof. It was bright yellow, and had pink flowers stitched on to it. Malfoy opened his mouth, and then nodded quickly, tugging it off his arms and handing it to Harry’s outstretched hand. Harry also put it on the bed, though with slightly more care. Some of those flowers looked like they might come off.
“Oh,” he said when they looked up. “Sorry. Am I interrupting something?”
Draco breathed. It felt jittery, like he was breathing something other than oxygen.
“Help me understand, Draco.”
Malfoy came back up abruptly, turning, wide-eyed to face Harry. His mouth was pale, his pupils blown. Two hands came up to cling at Harry’s shoulders, and he stared at Harry unnervingly.
“Reach through the cage.” said Malfoy.
“Even when you’re drunk babe,” said Ron, “You’re still so fucking smart.”
Malfoy tilted his head. “Metaphorical paths,” he said, carefully.
Harry glared at her, and then Malfoy. Malfoy quirked a brow.
“Yeah,” he said, “Suck it.”
When Draco came back, it was with a bottle of wine and two glasses. Harry laughed, swiftly hiding “The Hungry Caterpillar” down the side of the sofa. He watched as Draco poured them both glasses, and then drank deeply from his own. When he was done, there was a line of ruby liquid beading across his upper lip. His rubbed it away with the side of his thumb.
He held Harry’s eyes for a long time. Waiting for a change, or some kind of indication, perhaps.
The lounge was all done up for him. One of the sofas had been made up with a pillow and covers. Harry noted that it was unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, the one directly under the sunflower he and Draco had collaborated on. Oceania deposited his suitcase next to it.
“I am gay,” said Tom, very calmly. “I’m both.”
“Careful there. I have a boyfriend.”
He liked to read anytime.
“Right,” said Malfoy. His ears were a bit pink, and he sounded out of breath. Harry put his hands into his pockets and tried not to kick the dirt in front of him.
“So,” continued Hermione. “If being around these people is important to you, then it’s important to me. I don’t want to stifle you, Harry. But I know that…before…you felt like sometimes we were bad at understanding you. And I want to try.”
“Osh!” yelled Malfoy. He thumped a fist against the door. “Open the fucking door!”
Harry swallows her words and sits up. She stops looking at Draco.
The way the light was hitting Harry’s eyes made them look liquid. There was something curious and tentative, something that, to Draco, looked as if it wanted to reach out and touch him. Perhaps it was his imagination. He’d been reading too much.
“What's wrong with my planes?” asks Harry, slinging an arm over Draco's shoulders. Draco just scowls.
“You don’t really look like a woman,” he said instead.
“Yeah,” said Harry, giving a relieved grin back, “I mean, not really. I mean – I thought I might be lost, see –”
Malfoy shot him a dirty look. “Because I like Luna Lovegood. And it’s well written,” he added, after a beat.
“I didn’t ask for that kiss,” says Harry. “I was practically a bystander.”
There was something else to be said, he knew, but he didn’t have the vocabulary for it just yet. Or, no, he didn’t have the courage. Or, no, it was the knowledge. It was the knowledge he didn’t have.
Harry looked away. When he could bring himself to look back, Draco was watching him a little curiously.
“Fuck
Later, they did take a break. Luna brought out scones and jam and they ate it on the grass as the day began to brown with age, even though it was getting cold out. As they did Harry looked around at the garden, and the jam stuck to his fingers and thumb, and some of it got in his hair as he sucked it off. Luna finished her second and said, contemplatively: “I love it here.”
Malfoy’s entire body stiffened. “What?”
“Draco,” murmurs Harry, as if in assent, and then she steps back and helps Draco with the rest of her clothes. Draco leans into kiss her, deeper again, kissing her with all the agony of loneliness, of wanting and not having, and then falls back against the wall, her lips trembling, and watches as Harry takes off her own clothes. She reaches out for Harry once she is naked, but Harry just takes her by the shoulders and steers her towards the showers. “Come on,” she says. “You don’t want all the hot water to run out.”
The water was too deep here. Harry grabbed for Malfoy’s torso, pulling at his naked waist, trying to propel the two of them backwards. Water, everywhere. There was too much to think.
“What?”
They were having a campfire. Oceania had thrown in some strange plants earlier that probably weren’t hallucogenics, and it had filled the surrounding forest air with a soft, warm smell that reminded Harry of spring. Everyone was here: Charlie, Hayden, Tom, Osh, Draco – they were all here, and it was all so lovely.
“I was joking.” Malfoy looked at him, and this time his eyes stayed. “Are you yourself?”
“I bring it on myself, don’t I?” said Malfoy, and the bald man said, “You know you do, darling.”
Trigger warning: drug use
Then plank, and chaturanga down. Upward dog, and then back to downward dog. Oceania got them to bend their right knees and bring them forward. Then extend.
Draco opens her eyes and steps back. She moves behind the kitchen counter, and looks over at Harry Potter.
Malfoy made another sound, more like a protest. Harry was still holding him in place.
And then, to Harry’s mild alarm, she drunkenly planted herself on his lap.
Draco frowned thoughtfully as he took a sip of the tea, looking at all the books like he’d just noticed they were there. “I think so.”
Malfoy kept looking at him for a moment. Then he turned his head and looked at the trees.
“Draco,” said Harry, and there was something horrifically soft in his expression. “You’re rambling.”
He hadn’t realised he had missed this.
Draco ran his finger over the glass rim. He licked his lips.
“I think anyone can seem strange,” said Luna. “If you pay them enough attention.”
Malfoy nodded, crossing the room to try and find a less zoomorphic bowl.  “Ah,” said Harry, moving so he could reach the tap. “That explains why you’re so skinny.”
“Fancy!”
and Draco says, “Come here,” and Harry gasps and squeezes her eyes shut and digs in her fingernails, and her hips go erratic as she comes onto Draco, and Draco watches, brushing her hair off her face and reaching up to kiss the corner of Harry’s mouth.
“Uh,” he said. “Okay. I mean, I have plenty of books to read so –”
He cleared his throat and tried again. Malfoy raised his brows at him over the body of the persimmon.
Ron and Hermione stared at him. Harry drank a lot of water.
Ron looked predictably startled, but he came. They stood and hugged it out. It was awkward. Of course it was awkward. Harry felt so suddenly grateful that he even loved the awkwardness of it. They clumsily slapped each other on the back a few times. Hermione came back with the tea, and upon witnessing them looked as though she might start crying
“Exactly,” he drawled.
“Queers?” asked Harry.
“You’re coming with me,” she commanded. “Blaise has cancelled on me, the utter prat, probably because he’s engaged in a threesome with two other well-dressed snakes. I’ve already done my eyeliner and lipstick. Chop chop.”
“Well, then let me tell you how it’s going to be. I’m going to take you here, first, against this wall, and you’re going to scream, and then if you’re a good girl you’re going to eat me out, you’re going to suck me dry on your knees, and then I’m going to fuck you on the bed, until you can’t think of anyone or anything, until you can’t think of fucking a man again, until you can only think of me.”
“I won’t.” she says. “I’m not going anywhere else.”
“Oh.” Harry didn’t know why he had said that. It was just that – he’d assumed. “Yeah, I guess we’re done here. I’ll send you it when it’s done.”
Malfoy’s eyes widened. “Excuse me?”
“Yes,” said the voice, and then it laughed, quickly, a rushed sound. Harry couldn’t believe this was happening. The phone was sliding in his grip.
“I think I can manage,” said Malfoy, his voice dry, and then upon noticing the mat in Harry’s hands – “Give me that.”
Charlie nodded. “Yup.”
That was more than he had meant to say, but now he had said it he found that he couldn’t regret it. He was leaving. And here he was, looking at Draco in the eye, and the look on Draco’s face – it was so, so wonderfully profound. That look – Harry felt that he was going to miss it, perhaps most of all.
“That’ll be nice,” said Hermione, “Close to home.”
“Out of
“Oh, fuck off.” Malfoy stood abruptly and began to pack away his diagrams.
The next day was The Wong.
Pansy’s eyes narrowed further. “Are you now…” she drawled, stepping closer. Her velvet boot things clacked on his wooden floor. Harry stared at her, not unlike the way small rodents stare at oncoming birds of prey.
Malfoy just breathed.
“Merlin’s beard,” said Malfoy, jumping.
So. We shall see. Let me know what you think.
“So how come you’ve already got a path into Jane?”
After, Potter had kissed her eyelids and had gone to get biscuits from the cupboard. She had brought them back, and got crumbs all over the mattress, and then they had done it again. And then again. And then they had a bathroom break. And had done it again. And then Potter had gone to actually make tea, except Draco followed her, and watched – and there had been something so delicately aching inside as Draco had watched her boil the water and make the tea. Watching the bubbles climb each other angrily. Watching the shift of Potter’s brown arm as she lifted the handle. Watching her add the milk, and all the while something delicate was shattering, beneath the white skin of Draco’s body.
Benjamin cackled. “Astoria reels in every green-eyed trade.”
Harry had been afraid of the blue for a long time.
Malfoy twitches.
“We should discuss it.” Harry nodded in a way that he used to say
“You really thought I was selling blowjobs under the family name?”
Draco leaned against the side of the door frame. He was wearing a red jumper, with matching rose leggings. He so rarely wore red. Harry was kind of getting the urge to trod down the throat of a pissed off dragon again.
“You shouldn’t stereotype.” says Harry. “Behaviour is no indication of sexuality.”
Malfoy straightened up and crossed his arms.
“I suppose,” he said, “That it was less of a logical decision than one might expect. In my experience, sometimes you have to do away with logic. When something is right for you, you will feel it.” He looked at Harry, smiling. “Does it seem strange to you?”
“I just wanted to say,” he began again, and now Harry was pretty sure the whole pub was looking at him, “that I’m sorry for the way I behaved during my adolescence and although I understand my behaviour is not excusable, I hope you except this as the sincere apology it is.”
Draco was suddenly overcome by a rush of love so big it was embarrassing. It was always embarrassing. He swallowed.
“Okay,” said Harry without thinking, and got up.
Harry racked his brains. “About paths.”
“Yes,” she said. “He did live here before he left, after all. It’s still his true home.”
He was grinning. Along with the letter were several polaroid photos of Jane from varying distances. There was also a photo of Oceania sticking her tongue out with a pan in her hand filled with what looked like scrambled eggs in it. There were also a few shots of the landscape. One of Charlie with a strained expression as he looked up at what Harry assumed to be the new dragon.
Malfoy was inches away, and Harry’s eyes were free to roam. It hadn’t been that bad. The planes of his face were dynamic this close up, and you could see that he wasn’t really that pale at all. Pale was the wrong word. He was a combination of blue veins and red blood, ruddy flesh and carved bone, all sealed away in a skin so light it was translucent, a formality settled over his vitality like a table cloth.
