“Okay, Harry,” he whispers, and Harry feels warm and dizzy and tingly and ecstatic.
“Wait, but I thought you could Apparate within Ministry quarters…” Harry wheels around and sees Draco, a mildly amused expression resting on his features. “Were you really going to let me hail a cab and ask to be whisked away to Knockturn Alley?”
Harry tuned out as the list went on. He was replaying that moment when he was hiding down low, under Dumbledore’s office, watching Draco standing with his arm outstretched, wand trembling in his hand as he attempted to perform his mission from the dark lord. He remembered Bellatrix at his side, her arm around his waist, whispering in his ear.
“They’re your family, Draco.”
“I could drown in you,” Draco whispered in his ear.
Harry could feel his cheeks burning as he pushed down, determined, Gryffindor stubbornness. He groaned as he felt Draco’s hips beneath him. Let his weight drop down.
“Fuck.” A word finally made its way out of Harry’s mouth.
“Of course you weren’t,” Harry scoffed.
Harry could feel his heart racing at the prospect, he knew it was stupid, and he knew that he shouldn’t, and he was really going to try not to...but...he knew that part of himself was already resigned to letting Malfoy fuck him again. He knew from past experience that Malfoy was all too good at turning his no’s into yes’s, and that before he knew it he’d end up naked on his back with Malfoy buried deep inside him, moaning filthy things in his ear and he’d be screaming the place down. He hated his body, how it yearned for Malfoy; how it shivered at his slightest touch and even more, how it refused to react to anyone else’s. He hated Malfoy for doing this to him, he was sure he’d never had the slightest thought in that vein until Malfoy had taken him - against his will as Harry would always insist - and made him his.
Harry
“It really was quite adorable how you finished each other’s sentences. Keep up the good teamwork!” She winks.
He returns a few moments later holding bright crimson drinks in both his hands, singing along cheerfully to the song—even though the song has no lyrics and vaguely resembles the pieces of Mozart Harry’s 2nd grade music teacher had forced him to listen to--either that or an exceedingly depressing funeral march. He slips into his seat, humming.

Not that Harry was counting, of course. He simply had a great watch Ron had gotten him for his birthday two years ago strapped on his wrist. And it wasn’t like he was
“Shut up.”
“Look, when you say you’re
“Don’t get jealous?” Harry guesses weakly.
“Bloody hell, what is in that damned bag?” He yells, sliding the leather backpack off Draco’s shoulders and sighing in relief. “That thing must have weighed at least as much as himself. I don’t know how he
“He’s holding onto you just like he holds onto his stuffed lion, Francis Leopold.” Theo snickers. “He told us he’d thrown it away the instant he got sorted into Slytherin, but we’ve never seen him go to bed without it.”
“Really? Why?”
“Good afternoon to you too,” Harry grumbles, just as he notices Hermione and Ron approaching in the corner of his eyes and begins to panic. Just because he had adopted an amicable relationship with the Slytherins—perhaps

long, Potter, and we were always enemies. Don’t get me wrong—I liked being enemies, for the most part, because I could stalk you and tease you and laugh at you. Then we were co-workers, then partners on a mission, and then maybe even friends and I was too much of a coward to grab an opportunity when I had one, so I devised a crazy plan on the spot and convinced you I was drunk, so I could be less of the stuck-up prick I am normally and—“

going to ever say what he was thinking out loud. Because he was thinking that this would probably be one of the last times he was going to be alone with Draco Malfoy, just the two of them, and he was thinking that he didn’t want that to be the case. He was thinking about the way Draco had snuggled close to him late at night and the addictive touch of his skin pressing up against his and how open and vulnerable he had been earlier—to hell with it, he was saying it. Well, maybe not the whole truth, but he was going to have /some/ fun before he had to say goodbye. He needed to. He clears his throat. “It has…. It’s actually been decent, working with you. And, you know, since we don’t hang out much often,” he winces, “I thought we could celebrate… before parting ways.”
Harry blinks, all thoughts of ruined clothes flying out of his mind instantly. “I’m sorry, did you just call me—“
“You mean when,” Harry intones darkly, but rises from his chair and heads for the door, Draco following him close behind.
Their exchange barely registers with Harry, who’s still investing all his willpower into not pressing his lips against Draco’s right then and there. He clenches his fist, removing his shoulder from under Draco’s head as cautiously as he can manage, and setting it against the wall instead.
Harry laughs uncomfortably. “I suppose, sir.”
“One. More.”
“I can hear you, you know,” Draco comments, standing up and stretching. “But I would rather not start any new arguments, seeing as we’re going to be stuck with each other for the rest of the day, or possibly even longer.” He shudders.
and Harry called
The kiss starts off gentle, with Harry curving his arm around Draco’s waist and holding him up, tentative and innocent. Harry can sense Draco’s surprise, but he responds quickly, enthusiastically, and Harry smiles as he tastes the sweet, fruity tang lingering on his lips. A fire builds in his chest, crackling and glowing, and as Draco’s hands tug at his hair and his tongue flickers playfully against his lips, the fire leaps into his throat, scorching and scalding hot. His heart throbs, and he squeezes Draco’s body closer to his, pushing his lips hungrily against his, and jolts of electricity snake down his spine, making him crave more with each passing second. Draco clutches at the hem of Harry’s shirt, pulling it down and grunting in frustration when he realizes it’s a button-up, and Harry lets out a low moan—and they break apart, breathing hard. “Public space,” Harry whispers, the tips of their noses brushing and sending the flames into a frenzy again, forcing Harry to shove the compelling desire down. Draco rolls his eyes but nods, straightening up.
Draco blinks, then his gaze hardens, his relaxed countenance stiffening. Harry wants to reach out and comfort him—murmur reassurance and encouragement, squeeze his hand, hug him tightly, anything—but he doesn’t.
“The very best,” Draco agrees, turning to Harry. He narrows his eyes, sighing exasperatedly. “You got something—“
Harry watches him warily as he strolls out of the room—hair perfectly combed, robes perfectly pressed, posture perfectly poised, perfectly
“We’re here,” he whispered, and Harry craned his neck, expecting to see another boring old store but scrunching his eyebrows in confusion when he’s instead greeted by the sight of an old woman leaning against a rickety wooden armchair, snoring softly, her gnarly fingers clutching the gigantic dusty bucket resting in front of her. The letters
Harry winces. “Good morning?”
Harry gives him a dubious look but slowly makes his way out and up the stairs, guessing Draco’s locked himself in the guest bedroom. He knocks, but he doesn’t get a response.
He lets out a breath he didn’t realize he’d been holding when he’s ushered into the room and sees that the bed is definitely made for two people or more. Once Theo leaves (“Good night, sleep tight, don’t let the bedbugs bite—in this case, the bowtruckles, because I think my father might have stored them in a box somewhere in here,”), he hurriedly changes into his pajamas, glad he’d brought them along, and is about to get into bed when Blaise enters, groaning, hauling Draco behind him.
“Me.” Draco mutters. “Thanks for the interesting bit of information, Blaise, I’m sure everyone will forget about that quickly enough.”
“—and exhibited destructive behavior by throwing
“I have no inkling as to what moment you’re referring to,” he sniffs.
“Breakfast will be served soon.” He says loudly, and their eyes practically shine in anticipation. “Pancakes,” he adds.
“Oh, Draco was a huge help,” Harry supplies, and Draco cuts him, giving him a look.
“No need,” he says smoothly, and Blaise passes them, tugging an uncooperative Draco behind him sluggishly.
“Alcohol is hardly different from water for me.” He smirks, his gray eyes sparkling mischievously. “And Blaise and Theo are right—when I do get drunk, I end up acting quite loud and obnoxious, not all fluffy and cuddly like a baby kitten.”
for so long in your life.” He frowns. “Sorry, was that mean?”
“Ah. Teeny, right.” Malfoy looks momentarily lost before his gaze lands on Harry, shifting uncomfortably. “Teeny, this is Mister McVee, he’s visiting us from down South. And you know who I am.”
“What do we have here.” Harry looks up to see Theo and Blaise striding towards them, wearing nearly identical smirks. “My, Potter, your face could pass for a ripe tomato.”
“I’m coming in,” he announces, but a muffled voice replies, “Yeah, like the hell you’d be able to.”
He grins. “Wow, talk about being a perfectionist.”
valuable family heirlooms that cost a literal fortune to replace—“
“Us? Which us? I have no idea who you’re referring to, Harry, because you won’t tell us anything.”
A slow, satisfied smile stretches across Draco’s face, much to Harry’s bewilderment, and he turns around. “Why, I think we’ve got a pretty good idea of who this young man is, Trent.” To the woman, who’s still grumbling about how this mysterious man should start looking in the market, begin exploring his options, he says politely, “Thank you so much. You have been an immense help to us today, and we will be sure to let our uncle know.”
Theo gawks. “This is starting to reach new levels of horrifying.”
Harry blinks, confused. “But how do you—“
“Clearly,” he muttered, blowing at the tiny burns on his hand. Draco fishes another sparkling vial of liquid out of his bag, throwing it to him.
Harry caught wind of their conversation and almost choked.
“Of course it is,” he pouts. “Oh—whoops.” His wand slips between his fingers, but Harry reaches out and catches it just in time, passing it back to him. He laughs. “You were always a better Seeker than me."
Teeny’s wide eyes well up in tears, and she sniffles, before pulling out a groggy, discolored handkerchief and blowing her nose into it noisily. She hiccups pitifully. “Mister Malfoy must not…” Another hiccup. “He must not be so kind to the house-elves.”
Draco looks down at his lap, where his hands are clasping each other, fingers intertwined and palms folded. “Yeah.” He says. “Yeah, not as in I think you’re right, Potter, but yeah, as in let’s go get that Time-Turner, bring it back to the Ministry, and blow it to bits.”
With a loud, deafening pop, his feet hit solid ground. He lifts his head and lets go of the two, wrapping his coat tightly against the chill. He grits his teeth and nudges Malfoy forward, while guiding Teeny by placing a hand on her back. “Yes, that’s right, just keep walking, no, not that way, yes, nice and easy—“
“Er—I’m, uh—“
Harry tries to pry the tissues out of Draco’s hand, but he continues to dab fretfully, eyebrows pulled together in concentration and biting his lip, looking adorably distressed. Harry shifts as Draco’s knees dig into his thighs, choosing to focus his gaze on the intricate carvings adorning Draco’s wand, but finding it trailing back to Draco—more specifically, his face, and even more specifically, his lips, which he was now running his tongue along nervously.
Harry purses his lips to hide his amusement and shakes his head. “You go on.”
“Well, there were a few misses in his speech, but yes, ‘Mione, don’t you think…” He trails off, in search of a better way to phrase his thoughts.
for Draco to get drunk. In fact, he was worried about what would happen if he did, because whining, pouting Draco Malfoy wasn’t a pretty sight. (Wait. Screw it—it was. Extremely.)
“Oh, please, Draco used to be up
Harry gapes, and he notices Draco’s mouth is hanging open, too. He leans over and mutters, “Guess we didn’t see
Draco nods hesitantly and takes a sip of his own drink. Teeny seems to sway, dazed, and lets out a loud belch followed by a giggle. “Teeny is liking this drink, sir!” She gulps down the rest of the bottle and bangs it down on the table, grinning widely. “Could Teeny have some more, Mister Mc… McBee?”
“Don’t
“What? When?” He asks, caught off his guard.
“Shit, Harry, I didn’t mean to—“
“Mister… McChee? Mister Mac and Cheese?”
“I will turn
Harry shrugs. “Your loss.” He pats Hermione’s shoulder and reaches for the doorknob, then pauses, frowning.
Nevertheless, Harry kept telling himself he didn’t care about how many shots Draco downed or drinks he drained. And even if he did, which he totally didn’t, it was merely because he would have a terribly difficult time trying to Apparate with a slurring, staggering Draco Malfoy grasping his arm.

“Honestly, Potter, did you ever read a single page of
“Yes, and you’ve only contributed to that pile—a considerable amount, in fact,“ Harry mutters.
They sit down and scarf down their meals in companionable silence, the clattering of cutlery and Theo’s occasional remarks (“The maple syrup is fucking
“Hello,” Luna replies with her telltale lilt. She purses her lips contemplatively, pointing at Harry’s glass. “Harry, are you sure that’s safe to drink? The shade of sapphire blue awfully reminds me of Billywigs—I got stung by one once—well, on purpose, because I heard it could provide you with great insight when your creativity has been stalled. It wasn't the most pleasant experience.” She tilted her head. “But I did get a flash of inspiration for a new project, so maybe you
“Where is your Young Master?” Draco asks, then says, a tad more gently, as Teeny’s thin, parched lips begin to quiver, “I came here looking for my friend, Theo.”
“Shut up,” he retorts, channeling as much malice as he can into his reedy tone, but it ends up sounding sad and defeated. He groans.
Harry balks, wondering just how low Draco’s tolerance was, until it occurs to him that he might have accidentally switched the glasses. Sure enough, the half-empty bottle sitting in front of Draco was streaked with a telltale dash of bright red liquid. He groans. He now had a drunk house-elf cackling madly about how the hanging lanterns were salsa dancing and a drunk Malfoy smiling—actually

would be a better word for one of them—there was no guarantee that his friends would, too.
“Could you describe the other boy a bit more clearly?”
Harry glances around suspiciously, wondering when Draco will come back, but shakes his hand. “Harry.” He sees Ethan’s eyes flicker up to his forehead and he pushes his hair back, rolling his eyes. “Potter.”
you just conveniently ignored.”
“Hmm…” She slams the bucket down on the floor again, and the noise reverberates around the streets, causing Harry to wince. “Sorry, boys. You’re going to have to tell your uncle he just missed his chance. The item’s been sold.”
“Very.” Harry presses a chaste kiss onto Draco’s chin, relishing in the way the color floods his cheeks instantly, and pulls back reluctantly. A question forms in his mind. “Oh, wait. Was the, er, name-calling intentional too?”
Harry accepts the paper but winces when he feels Draco’s eyes drilling holes into his side. Once Ethan has disappeared safely out of sight, the card bursts into flames in Harry’s hands, and he drops it, yelping. “I think I have blisters on my palms now,” he complains.
“Not now,” Harry teases, and turns to him. “So where should we go?”
? I don’t know if I should blame your misuse of pronouns on your faulty grammar or diabolical personality.”
“And Draco, you’re probably wondering why he didn’t pass it on to you. But there’s an explanation for that.” Draco refuses to look at him, gaze fixated on his shoes.
“How did you—“
Their feet hit solid ground, and Draco immediately lets go of Harry’s arm. Harry breathes out a sigh of relief, but frowns when he feels a flicker of disappointment following it.
Draco kissed the top of his head and began to massage his shoulders. Harry melted into him, letting himself enjoy a moment of serenity.
“Yet.”
She pulled her arm out his grip and walked down the corridor.
Harry bit down on Draco’s neck and picked up his pace, flying high on the pleasure, on the sound of Draco crying out beneath him with his every thrust. He was getting used to the wall now, the times between hitting in were getting shorter, he just gasped and carried on, pounding Draco into the table, regardless of how blue it was making his balls. It was so good. Too good. Nothing in the world had every felt like this soaring euphoria.
“If you’d like to underdress down to your underwear and lie down on the coach and cover yourself with the towel, I’ll be back in just a moment.”
“He said he hadn’t eaten in five days!” Harry exclaims. “I know what it’s like to be painfully hungry and it would’ve been simply
“No,” Draco says, climbing off Harry’s lap (much to his severe disappointment) and settling into the seat at his right. “I never was.”
, Ronald!”) , and for once, Harry’s glad that they’re fighting, because that means they aren’t paying him any attention.
“You mean Young Master Nott? Why, he’s at his family cottage in Chestnut Orchards, of course.” Harry crosses his fingers under the table, hoping she doesn’t realize her slip-up, but she simply frowns and asks, “Why is your name Mac and Cheese, sir? Did you choose it for yourself? Of course, Teeny isn’t knowing what mac and cheese tastes like, because her masters have refined taste, but her brother says it’s delicious--“
“That’s nice to hear.” Draco replies happily. “You must not have gotten much
“Are you hearing yourself?” He shoots back. “Malfoys don’t do cooking.”
“Hmm, I don’t know.” Hermione answers. “I’m simply suggesting this based on the careful analysis of your personal records here at the Ministry. Our systems have reached the conclusion that you two would be a perfect match in all sorts.”
“What name calling?” Draco averts his gaze, and Harry laughs.
Draco clears his throat, but the woman continues to gently rock back and forth, her eyes closed and oblivious. Harry bites back a laugh as Draco, shooting him a glare, reaches out tentatively and taps her shoulder.
“Yeah, well, I have the best of both worlds.” Harry cautiously makes his way over, settling down on the bed with a few inches of space between them. He decides it’s best to wait until Draco wants to talk.
“Well, I’m sorry for talking to a guy who, for your information, came up to me first and complimented me on my
charming. “But sure. Are you up for some drinks?”
“It’s a tad nicer than I expected,” Draco observes, already on his feet and striding towards the entrance. Harry, hastily dusting off his robes, follows him.
Even Blaise’s bored countenance morphs into surprise. He shrugs at Harry. “When the git gets drunk around us, he starts throwing things and spending money on shit like amulets shaped like pickles, not whimpering like a pathetic baby and begging to be hugged.”
The three of them settle into a dark but cozy corner in the back of the bar.
“Now, Blaise, where are our manners?” Theo rolls his eyes. “Good evening, Potter. Red hair is truly not a flattering look on you. Come in.”
, Harry thinks furiously) before Harry clears his throat and says nervously, more to Draco than to Teeny, “So, er, if you can hold onto my arm—both of you—“
“The Nott cottage, sir? Well of course, Teeny remembers it clear as— clear as—“
He feels the steady pressure of Draco’s hand gripping his forearm, and Teeny’s sharp nails pinching his right hand, and concentrates on the familiar image of the warm, cozy bar he used to visit with Ron and Hermione right after graduating to celebrate their victories and—
Hermione forces a very tight smile on her face. “Well, I just thought I’d come by and say goodbye.”
“Mister Malfoy is too kind…” Teeny wipes his eyes on the paper napkin, then holding it against the lights and examining it, shining with gratitude. “Teeny is having a ‘something new’ now, all her friends and family will all be so jealous—“ The color drains from her pale face, and Harry, sensing another hysterical tantrum approaching, hurriedly places the bottle in front of the elf.
“Me?” Harry asks, unsure. “Wouldn’t it be better if you two went? I’ve known Malfoy—well, I’ve
Harry swivels his head to his left, where Draco is gently rocking back and forth, his arms wrapped around his knees, humming serenely.
Blaise snorts. “Sleepy much?”
Soon enough, his vision floods with color again, and he stumbles, holding on to the hem of Draco’s robes to stay upright.
“Mm-hmm,” Draco says, placing the velvet box gently inside his backpack and turning around to face Harry. “We did succeed after all—Granger’s definitely going to be happy.”
, did you shove them in the freezer? Why would you
“Right. Only the poor house-elf,” Draco shoots back. “Besides, do you honestly think I’d get drunk on a single drink? Please, Potter.”
“He passed away last month.” Draco says simply.
have to drink it?” Harry protests. The potion looked a lot tastier than the ones he’d previously drunk, but he was not looking forward to the agonizing transformation.
She doesn’t seem to have felt it, as her snores only grow considerably louder, but as Draco leans forward again, her eyes fly open and she snaps, with contempt and annoyance lacing her grubby tone, “I’m asleep!”
Draco stands up, nearly knocking over his chair and stumbling, a look of wide surprise in his eyes. “Woah,” he says softly, smiling sheepishly at Harry. “Guess I’m a little tipsy. Do you want anything?”
“I’ll just have a Firewhisky, thanks,” he replies curtly.
Once they’re all settled (Harry very uncomfortably so), Theo clears his throat. “So, we’re guessing you’re here for this.“ He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small, cube-shaped box. He snaps it open, and the Time-Turner is resting on the velvet cushion, glowing a dazzling, radiant blue. “And we intend to give it back to you—but give us a chance to explain.” He bites his lip anxiously, and Blaise places his hand over his, earning a quick half-smile.
“Excuse me?”
RIght on cue, Slughorn comes trotting up, his hair noticeably grayer and his belly bulging even more prominently than during Harry’s Hogwarts years, but his voice remains loud and booming. “Harry! I wasn’t sure if you could make it, with you being the Savior of the Wizarding World and all--but of course, I did help you quite a bit on your journey, it wouldn’t’ve been right any other way—“ He clapped a hand on Harry’s shoulder, causing him to wince slightly. “How have you been doing? Bet you’re raking in money by the Galleons, eh?”
Draco knocks again, and the wide eye emerges again, this time accompanied by a glimpse of a big, pointy ear. “Hello, er…”
Draco stays motionless for a couple seconds, in which silence blooms around them, enveloping them in a morose atmosphere. He finally sneers, but his voice trembles. “Yeah, because it really sounds like he did.”
“Be nice, Blaise. Potter, we won’t destroy you, we’ll just secretly murder you.” Theo says, grinning, carrying a platter with several teacups on it and placing it on the table in front of them. He looks up at and gapes. “What on Earth is Malfoy
Hermione’s eyes flutter closed and she takes a few deep breaths. She says, in a sickly sweet voice, “I hope you remember he escaped and we had to send out a disproportionate number of reinforcements.” She fixes her eyes on Malfoy, who was rather enjoying watching Harry flounder. “And you, Malfoy, tend to be too forceful on them. You scared the living daylights out of a woman who was mistakenly accused of stealing her neighbor’s
“Now, why can’t you tell us where Nott is?” Draco prods, his tone still tender.
that? Huh?”) being the only sounds. Once they’re all done, Draco sends the plates soaring over to the kitchen, where they pile themselves in the sink.
Harry rolls his eyes but picks up the plates, letting the other two float behind him, and treads into the dining room. He sets the plates down, grinning, and Draco walks in, a trail of forks, spoons, and knives floating over his head. They jump onto the table and march their way over to each placemat, and Harry raises his eyebrows, amused. “Cool trick.”
“Oh.” Harry frowns. “Is that allowed?”
Harry sighs. “I know it isn’t the most appealing plan to your new and active conscience, but we’ve got nothing else. And it’s not like we’re intending on revealing Nott’s secret to the world or whatnot—Teeny will have nothing to feel guilty about.”
“Could you make it any more obvious that you’ve never been to Knockturn Alley?”
“You’re actually saying that like you’re any better.” Draco comments lightly, and Hermione nods in mock seriousness. “But enough with the festivities. We have to get going if we want to avoid the crowds. We’ll be off, Granger.” He nods swiftly, and before Harry can do anything more than look up in confusion and let out an involuntary

Instead, he told himself to get his head in the game. He found Blaise setting Draco down on a fancy turquoise sofa, draping a plaid navy blanket over him.
, because now he was desperately attempting to block out mental images of snogging Draco Malfoy, and his face was heating up, and Draco’s fingers were causing strange tingling sensations to spread throughout his entire body and he was feeling delirious and wobbly and dizzy—
A hasty, loud knock sounds at the door, and Hermione bursts in, yelling, “

, I should’ve gotten the Hawaiian cocktails instead—“ He rushes over to Harry, a fistful of tissues clenched in his left hand and his wand dangling from his right, and practically sits on his lap. Ignoring—or simply not noticing—the stifled sounds of panic Harry’s making, he starts dabbing frantically at the red blooming in flowery shapes almost directly over Harry’s chest.
Draco lets out a soft moan and his arm slips down to land on Harry’s torso. He toys with the thin fabric a bit before sighing and falling back into a quiet slumber. Harry grits his teeth and breathes in, breathes out—it was going to be a long, long night.
“If it makes you feel better, I do believe that part about him loving me,” he says, looking out at the window, where the sun glimmers joyously over the lake. “And the rest’ll take time—healing, accepting, forgiving. But I’m willing to wait.” His gaze flits over to Harry’s, and a trace of a smile flickers on his face. “Besides, since my father’s gone now, I can get rid of those blasted peacocks in our garden. They’ve really taken a liking to my shoes—and by
idiot, okay?”
“That sounds rather possessive.”
“Draco.” He looks up, his eyes clouded in uncertainty. “Your father did love you. He was proud of you and he trusted you. He wanted you to be safe and happy, even if it meant going back on everything he’d ever fought for. He made a great sacrifice making these decisions, and I think… I think the only reason he became so determined was because he loved you.” Harry finishes, feeling odd and tender and fragile.
“Really? Your best?” Harry jokes, but his voice sounds stiff and strained.
Harry smiles. “Alright.” He notices Draco pointedly looking away, and rolls his eyes. “You can join if you want, I promise I won’t run away screaming even if you do.”

“Young Master Nott is… is….” Teeny lets out a wail, rushing over to a round mahogany table placed in the center of the room and slamming the flower pot on her fingers repeatedly, screeching and yowling, causing Harry to use every ounce of self-restraint he had not to stuff his fingers into his ears and roar. “Bad Teeny! Bad Teeny!”
Harry rolls his eyes but goes and grabs two Firewhiskeys (one with extra shots) and a Butterbeer for himself. When he returns, Draco is passing a paper napkin to a stammering, blubbering Teeny, suggesting that maybe he trade her old handkerchief for something new.
“Sleeping together, yes.” He frowns. “That doesn’t sound quite right, but you get the idea.”

, Harry thinks, somewhat scathingly. He was so fucking
“Uh—yeah. Right.”
“I like your… er… shoes.” Harry says lamely, even though his shoes are hardly unique—or stylish, for that matter.
Draco stares back at him, wide-eyed and startled and mouth hanging slightly open and ears tinged a dull, embarrassed pink, the fluorescent lights spread across his cheeks and coating his skin in a velvety glow—
“Of course,” Harry grumbles, fishing in his pocket for his wand and a scrap piece of paper. He holds it up to his eyes and reads, “Abbey’s Antiques and Accessories? Sounds fairly benign.”
Harry bites his lip but returns with another glass, which he sets down in front of Teeny cautiously, contemplating warning her about downing too much of it—but she grabs it, squealing excitedly, and gulps it down hungrily. Thankfully, her alarming pace seems to slow down a little, and Harry turns to Draco—except he has his head on the table, face sweaty and flushed pink, smiling stupidly.

“I wish I didn’t have to agree with you, but I really can’t disagree.” Draco says tiredly.
“Probably because it’s true,” Theo chirps.
The woman cracks open an eye, sighing and sitting back up straight at the imploring look on Draco’s face. Harry glanced at him and noted that he was indeed a proficient actor—he nearly felt bad for him.
happy to be welcoming a Malfoy in as a potential family member—but all’s fine as long as you’re the one to tell my mum you two are swapping spit.”
“Wow, Potter, you can be so dense sometimes.” He responds dryly. “Of course we don’t, what are we, human beings?”
“Fine.” He huffs, crossing his arms over his chest as Draco levitates a carton of eggs, containers of—baking soda? baking powder?—and a plethora of boxes and cans towards them. The lids fly open, pouring its contents out to its respective dishes, and the eggs glide out of their dimples and crack themselves over a plastic bowl. Harry watches in stunned amazement as the utensils and ingredients spin, jump, and twirl of their own accord, creating a cheerful, bumbling racket.

, Harry thinks, but doesn’t dare voice his opinions out loud in fear of another outburst. He instead takes a step back, holding up his hands, and says, “We’re from the Mi—“
,” Hermione coughs, and Ron glares at her.
Harry gapes at him. “You… you know how to—“
“But—“
“Nott and Zabini.” Draco says smugly. “They weren’t exactly exclusive when we were at Hogwarts, but it seems like they’ve made things official recently, no?”
Blaise appears in the doorway, grumbling and shoving a couple of shiny coins into Theo’s outstretched palm. His eyes land on Harry and he scoffs. “How do we know it’s you, Potter? Your cute little scar is showing under that hideous mop of flaming hair.” He motions to his forehead, and Harry touches it self-consciously. "Also, we were expecting you."
Harry whips around and Draco stands there, shaking his head in a condescending way. Harry grimaces. “I never really learned magic for these sorts of circumstances.”
“Why?” Harry forces out, his nonchalance swiftly fading when Draco runs a hand through his hair and fixes his gaze on him.
The house-elf glances around surreptitiously before whispering, in a barely audible voice, “Teeny, sir.”
So... plot twist... kinda? XD
“Not so much mean as it is true,” Harry says, shrugging. “Fighting a Dark Lord and attempting to escape near-certain death only to eventually succumb to it—well, it tends to consume a lot of your leisure time.”
Harry looks up. A lean, lanky guy with chestnut curls lopes up to him. “Uh, are you talking to me?”
Draco doesn’t even turn around, still fully concentrating. He groans in frustration as the blueberry he was fiddling around with rolls over, but he finally gets it right in a few tries. (Actually, Harry’s not sure what the difference between the last two was, but he thinks it’s best not to ask.) He spins around, beaming triumphantly. “They’re perfect. Go ahead and take them.”
“No handshake?” Draco drops his hand, shaking his head. “Not very polite, are you?”
“Malfoy’s just jealous because he hasn’t had enough friends to know what friendship means.” Harry pretends to think. “I’m sorry, did I say not enough? I meant none.”
“I think this is what they meant by disgustingly romantic,” Harry murmurs.
“Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy, that can’t be right!”
“Mister McVee and I here have some very good news to deliver to Nott. Could you at least give us a hint?”
, but the door remains firmly locked. He tries a number of other spells he’d watched Hermione perform in similar situations, but none of them work, the last one simply shooting red sparks that bounce off the door. An idea suddenly occurs to him, and he taps a little bug crawling on the wall, successfully transfiguring it into a hairpin. (Professor McGonagall would’ve been proud.) Twisting it and shoving it into the lock, he jiggles it a couple times, and the lock clicks open.
“Let’s just stick with Trent for the name.” Draco decides. “Trent McVee.”
“That… well… we don’t make good partners.”
“Really?” He asks, a tad drowsily. “But it’s only been… what…”
, do you mean—“
Blaise glares at him. “Thanks to your brilliant plan of get-the-house-elf-wasted, Theo and I didn’t get a wink of sleep last night.”
“Oh, for fuck’s sake.” Draco mutters. He rummages through his backpack, holding out a small vial containing a brick-red, shimmery liquid. “Drink up, Potter.”
“Right. Fine.” Ethan retorts, and passes a small piece of paper over to Harry. “For when you get tired of this bloke.”
“Then I can’t think of a better thing to be.” Draco replies, wrapping an arm around Harry’s waist and pulling him closer, enveloping him in a lazy, passionate kiss and smiling--
“But maybe…” Harry thinks, images from the Hogwarts kitchens of a certain miserable house-elf popping up into his mind. “We could try getting her drunk.”
Harry takes in a sharp breath. “Oh.” But he thinks of what he’d overheard the other day, and he’s suddenly confused. Surely Draco wasn’t lying, but that didn’t explain why no one, including himself, didn't know about it.
“So you want to hang out for a while?”
“Quite tall. Thin. Brown hair, pale skin. Looked a bit like he’d collapse after a single blow to the head.” Harry started to feel hopeless at the woman's vague descriptions, but Draco looked at her intently, nodding encouragingly. “Oh! And he came with a boy—I wish I meant that differently, but I don’t. They were holding hands,” she says distastefully.
“And what exactly do you mean by that?” Draco questions, the impatience creeping into his tone.
“Why does everyone keep saying that?” He complains.
don’t need to get wasted.”
Ron’s mouth opens and closes, before he whispers a shocked
Draco raises the ornate brass knocker in the shape of a lunging snake and raps it against the door three times. A terrified squeal and a hasty pattering of feet sound from inside the house, and the two exchange a look.
were, either, Draco.”
“Anything you want to get, Malfoy?” Harry asks, preparing to get up and order.
Harry was really starting to miss the original Slug Club. The huge swarms of chattering, waving, shouting people were deeply annoying him.
it, quite frankly—“ he barks out a laugh, “But here you are; here we are! To us.” He raises his extra-large glass, filled with a bubbly golden ambrosia that resembles Felix Felicis, and clinks it against Harry’s. He takes a huge gulp. “Ho! I see your friend Hermione Granger is here too! I must go say hi, she’s definitely going to become a
“Look, er… we can go if you want.” He suggests, silently hoping Draco will insist on staying.
“For instance, Harry has a track record to be slightly too lenient with criminals—and don’t bother arguing, Harry, I know that you removed the chains from a serial killer because he couldn’t pick up the slice of pepperoni pizza you decided to buy him.”
“Honestly—no.” He shrugged. “But I was going to wait until you got in the cab to tell you.”
“If he wanted to prank Harry by making him obsessed with him, all he needed to do was start disappearing into the Room of Requirement again. Either that or reopen the Chamber of Secrets, but I personally think the former would’ve been slightly easier,” Ron snickers. Harry adds
Harry blinks but nods hesitantly, wondering why Draco wasn’t telling the truth.
“—sabotage each other’s relationships relying on carefully structured plans that, unfortunately, failed to reach the same level of immaculate perfection when carried out—“
“I don’t know, being drunk?"
“Are you sure?” Harry asks dubiously, eyeing the bucket. “It might be stuck in there somewhere. Could you possibly take another look—“
“We really have such great friends.” Harry grumbles, taking a gulp of his drink.
Harry trails behind the pair, still trying to wrap his mind around the fact that they were a couple. It wasn’t that he hadn’t seen two guys holding hands or, hell, even kissing passionately in public before—what stunned him was the easy connection they held, the sparks of chemistry. And what terrified him was how much he found himself desiring it—not just the shagging-a-guy part, nor the playful, snarky banter part, but both of them, equally as much and a
“They succeeded--well, in making the Time-Turner, anyway. And they continued to elaborate on their scheme, adding specific details, devising alternative methods, and eventually, their outline wasn’t an outline anymore—it had grown and expanded until it was a very tangible and very plausible plan. However, time was running short. Ministry officials were getting impatient, citizens were rioting for harsher punishments, and so the number of potential participants were decreasing significantly every day. They soon decided to carry it out on the same day the Dark Lord had first fallen—so again, on your birthday, Potter.
Too late. Draco scoots closer in his sleep, snoring softly, and reaches his arm out blindly, and after a few tentative pats in which Harry’s eyes and nose kept getting poked, he settles for petting Harry’s hair. “Crazy hair,” he coos, and Harry genuinely wonders if the bloke has a hair fetish.
“Move,” he commands, and Harry hastily rolls over to the right to make room—perhaps more than is necessary—for Draco. Blaise sets him down and turns to leave. “I’m guessing Theo already told you about the vicious bowtruckles, so I’ll give you a different warning instead: Draco sleepwalks, sleeptalks, and sleep—well, you’ll find out.”
—and sighs. He already missed drunk Draco—silly, adorable, and best of all, daft.
Harry gapes. “But you—you—“
“Malfoy,” he tries, praying Draco had just suffered a temporary head injury because of the racket Teeny was causing, and was going to snap up and lash out at Harry any moment now—but all Draco does is nod sleepily, his eyes sliding out of focus.
influential figure one day, mark my words—“ He gives Harry a final, parting pat and waddles off cheerfully in Hermione’s direction.
“Wow.” He throws his hands up in the air. “What a kind, caring, noble group of individuals the Ministry selects for its most prestigious positions. What. A. Group.”
“In my defense, I was going to wait until you hailed the cab.” She says, snorting.
Harry winks at him cheekily. “I’m glad you think so.”
“Well, isn’t that nice of you. Do you want a farewell hug?” Draco says dryly, leaning against the wall.
Ron gawks. “You mean the time he started pulling out all my socks and burying his nose in them because apparently, my feet smelled ‘exceptionally glorious’?”
“I told her I
“I knew that Apparition was allowed within offices, so I must have, right?” The truth was that Harry had simply heard Hermione lecturing a group of students from Hogwarts while accompanying them on their tour of the buildings—but Draco didn’t need to know that.
“I’m not that great at reading people,” Ron retorts defensively. His eyes land on Harry’s, and he gives a tentative grin. “I’m happy for you, mate.” Harry’s heart collapses in relief. “I’m not going to lie and say that
“I really did spend my entire life trying to please him.” He says scathingly, but also like he doesn’t have the energy to muster enough bite. “I don’t know which is worse—that he never got to tell me the one thing I desired most in person, or that he never properly trusted me until the end. Or maybe it’s that even now, I seek his approval and… crave it.”
get the idea? Harry’s mind was racing, his heart frantically throwing itself at his rib cage in a frenzied, erratic rhythm. He lets himself be led up the stairs, stumped into silence. It was absolutely bonkers, but he felt much, much more nervous than when he had been about the confront the violent, savage Hungarian Horntail during the Triwizard Tournament.
He pulled down Harry’s boxers slowly, keeping his eyes locked with Harry’s.
“Open your mouth.”
“One please.”
“Shh, darling.”
He pulled himself up onto his knees.
He told himself he was just going to talk to Malfoy, to see if he could convince him not to tell anyone about this, to somehow escape from this whole embarrassment unscathed.
“Here?” Harry asked.
“My god. You Gryffindors are challenged.” Draco flicked his wand at the curtains. They shivered then sealed themselves together.
Harry nearly wept against the door as Draco let go of his cock and knelt down in between his legs, spreading his cheeks with his thumbs.
“We need to try and find the one that sounds like the one you’re experiencing. Start looking.”
Harry’s legs were still wobbly when he go to 120 and dragged himself up. The bell had already rung. Classes had already begun. He guessed they weren’t going to potions. He prayed to god that no one noticed they were both missing and put two and two together. Still, even if they did, Harry wagered no one would guess what they were really up to. He put his cloak back on, picked up his bag and walked on still shaky legs towards the bathroom, praying no teachers saw him and demanded why he wasn’t in class.
Harry didn’t think he was sleeping. He often woke up in the night to find Draco wide awake, eyes open and staring at the ceiling. He’d sleepily try to comfort him, but Draco would just kiss Harry on the head and tell him to go back to sleep. He didn’t try to reason him with him anymore, there was no easy answers here. Harry was learning the hard way that the lines between good and evil weren’t always are clear cut as he’d always assumed.
“Fuck.” Draco collapsed on top of him, wresting his chin on Harry’s chest, smirking at the mess he’d covered him in.
“You treacherous little snake!”
“Maybe there’s hope for your dancing skills yet, Potter.”
Harry cock bobbed hard in between his legs. His whole face burned now. Draco smirked at him. Harry was pinned to the bed by his stare. He tried not to shake. Draco was delighting in his awkwardness and Harry knew it. He tried to take a deep breath and pull himself together but the breath caught in his throat.
“You ready for a proper fucking now?”
“What the hell are you doing here?”
“We have reached a verdict.”
“Been promoted to Prefect, have we?” Malfoy sneered. “Maybe I’m waiting for a date, Potter.”
“You smell surprisingly good.”
Too soon, they disappeared into this night.
“How do you know? You’re not even in all my classes.”
“Thank you.”
The outcome had been the sudden appearance of leather canes and candle wax on Malfoy’s bedside table, and this personality. A lot of the time after he’d made him scream out his orgasm and got himself off he switched back, bantering with him casually, not as if he liked him, but not like he hated him either.
“Both.”
“Well keep reading then.”
“It’s the giants.”
“Don’t be nice.”
It was only when he realised the circle had gone quiet and looked down at the bottle when he realised it was pointed at him.
“Yeah?” Draco prompted.
“Careful.”
Oh god, he was using that voice. Harry had become aware some time after they’d started this that something had snapped in Malfoy, he didn’t know what had caused it, didn’t dare to ask, but it seemed as if Malfoy had become two people. The Malfoy he was used to, who talked dirty and wound him up but at the end of the day wasn’t so bad and would still wrap his arms round him afterwards, kiss him and maybe let him sleep in his bed. And then there was the Malfoy that came out occasionally that was cruel and vindictive, growling at him and pushing him to the limit of everything; pleasure, pain, sanity...He had at first thought that Malfoy had just created this after they’d been fucking once and he’d tried bringing his palm down on Harry’s arse as he fucked him, Harry wasn’t sure exactly what noise he’d made, but he knew that Malfoy had delighted in his response.
Harry threw another orb of light at the chandelier that hung over the hall. The Death Eater had Draco by the neck with a wand to his temple. Another stood behind him in an identical black robe. He couldn’t see either of their faces.
Harry nodded, throwing his cloak around himself and walking down to Defence Against the Dark Arts. He slid himself down in his usual desk, hoping he didn’t look as flushed as he felt. He couldn’t look Hermione in the eyes.
“Do you know what the house looks like?” Harry interrupts impatiently.
, not smirking or sneering or twisting his face up into the typical contorted expression he claimed was
“And you?” Harry turns to Hermione and demands. “You too?”
“My alarm didn’t ring,” he grumbles, rummaging in his pocket for his wand. He fishes it out and spells the curtains closed, cloaking the room in a hazy darkness, and Draco narrows his eyes and swishes his wand in the air, effectively throwing them apart again. Harry huffs but settles for sinking into his seat, burying his head in his heads and muttering about how insufferably annoying Draco is.
“Riiiight.” Draco draws out the word, setting his glass down. “Hmm.. well, let me just—“ He twists in his chair to reach for his bag, but his elbow knocks over the glass and sends its contents flying across the table and—oh /hell/—straight onto Harry’s shirt. He groans as the vibrant red liquid soaks into the fabric, spreading rapidly, and Draco’s mouth flies open.
“You probably don’t know this yet, Potter, but I get jealous really easily.”
to believe him.”
Draco takes a sharp left turn, leading them into a particularly bustling area of Diagon Alley, with whining children and hopping wizards bumping into them and hurrying along. Harry tries to force all thoughts of the outrageous snippets he’d just heard out of his mind as Draco leans forward and announces, “We’re leaving.”
“Don’t you dare. You stood up against your family, against Voldemort, you’re one of the bravest people I know.”
“Fuck. I. Yes.” He spluttered.
“You’re delicious,” Draco told him.
“I’m a Death Eater slut!” Harry yelled at the top of his voice.
How could he have been so stupid as to think it was a love potion? And to confront Malfoy about it of all things. Mortifying. He raked his hand through his hair, tugging on it, wishing for the fifth time that day that he had a Time Turner. Not that it would do anything about his throbbing cock, but it would do something about his severely damaged pride.
“Please. Fuck Draco you’re killing me.”
“You’ve got no clothes,” he said.
"What were you crying about?”
“Noted. Now shut up, get your clothes off and get in here with me.”
“Its okay. I’ve done my fair share of reckless in my time.” Harry helped Draco over to the bed.
“Sure?”
“Good boy.”
“Did you know you go cross eyed when you concentrate really hard?”
“I can’t handle how naïve you are sometimes Potter. It’s adorable.” He rocked Harry’s hips back and forth. “Speaking of, get these off.”
“Get him to the table.”
Draco squealed as Potter pushed a third finger inside him.
Harry watched Draco across the hall. He looked even more tired and drawn out than he did last night. Harry’s heart hurt. Draco was lying. He was better than this. He knew it. And it was tearing him apart. Draco knew what would happened if he switched sides. Draco’s parents would be dead in a second.
“He hit me first!” Draco said.
Draco took his hands away abruptly, letting Harry fall in a heap on the floor. Harry gasped oxygen back into his lungs. His bare forearms against the cold tiles bringing him back to earth.
Draco slammed his hips back against him in protest and Harry cried out, grabbing Draco’s hips so he couldn’t do it again.
“Ah!” Harry’s breath hitched. It felt bigger, harder, hotter, than the toy.
Kingsley nodded and walked out.
Harry got up to do as he was told. The crack splintered a little further.
“I might have a nap myself actually.”
“Is it?”
“What’s so fucking funny?”
Harry desperately wanted to kiss him. It seemed trivial after what had happened last night, but it was the reining thought in his brain. Not a blow job, or a fuck, or whatever else Malfoy had spoken about last night. He wanted Malfoy’s tongue in his mouth. Their bodies pressed together hard. He wanted the heat back. The pressure.
She ran up the stairs to meet them, glancing at the Death Eater on the floor before stepping over him to get to Harry.
“They’re my family, Potter.”
Harry rolled his eyes.
“Please! God Draco please!”
Draco blinked.
“Want me to do it? Want me to get myself off fucking you?”
“If it gets any worse—“ she started.
“I want you to fuck me,” Harry whispered in his ear.
“Okay,” Harry sighed. “Yeah, okay, I’ll talk to him.”
“I hate you.”
Draco rolled his eyes. They would do things the slow way. He turned away from his bedroom and went downstairs to the dining room. Tonks, Remus and Mrs Wesley still sat at the table, but it went quiet as he walked in. Mrs Weasley left the table.
“For doing what?!”
“Here?”
“You’re in love with me...” Draco whispered in his ear, “and it’s tearing you apart inside hiding it from yourself.”
“Wouldn’t want everyone hearing for themselves what a desperate little slut you are for me would we?”
Harry groaned that Draco was once again going to make him pleasure himself, hammering the point home that he wanted this, needed this, that Draco was in no way forcing him and he only had himself to blame. He was so close though, that there really was no other option, so he pushed himself down on Draco’s hard cock in one smooth movement, crying out as he did, only eliciting a grin from Draco, not even a hiss of pleasure.
Draco smirked at him across the table.
“Twenty minutes walk.”
Harry must have let something slip on his face. He had no idea what gave him away, but Malfoy knew. An expression of disbelief gave way to one of pure amusement.
“What do you want?” Harry asked him, getting himself some bread out of the cupboard.
“So why pick our side?”
Harry shook his head.
Draco opened his eyes and blinked at Harry.
“No,” Hermione said, “not till we know for sure...sorry.”
Harry’s heart leapt. Jesus Christ. How could this feel so right? How could Draco fucking Malfoy who’d arranged the kidnapping of him and his friends for Lord fucking Voldemort feel so right.
“Cammomile. I always find it helps one to sleep, in times of trouble.”
Harry knew he should be wary but all it did was make him harder.
He knew he got rough when he was this turned on, this passionate. It flicked a switch in him, it always had, his dick took over, and he just wanted wanted wanted.
Harry pushed his head straight back down, wanting it so badly. He put his hands on Draco’s arse, pulling him in further.
“Hands on the wall. It’s time for your second try.”
“Child,” Harry muttered under his breath.
It was late when Harry got home. The sun was coming up over the high rises as he looked out from the windows of his flat. Despite Major’s weather protection charms he had still somehow got soaking wet. He was drenched and shivering. He ran himself a steaming hot bath and threw his wet clothes into the basket. He shuffled round in his dressing gown and cleared up the coffee cups, looking for a while at the space where Draco had been sitting on his sofa. He’d missed his chance. He was sure.
“Elderflower. Don’t tell me you’ve never had Elderflower before, Potter?”
“No. Let’s go before... “
“You started it.” Harry could feel his temper rising again.
“I came here to save your life, Potter, you could be the least bit grateful,” Draco huffed.
“QUIET!”
Harry winced. “I won’t.”
“Draco, come on, we’ve got to get out of here.”
They walked over to the edge of the campsite, that just happened to back onto the drive of the house they were meant to be watching. Through a great deal of privet hedge of course.
Draco leant towards him, Harry chest was tight.
It was the slightest whisper in his ear, but it woke Harry in an instant. He tensed. Draco had slid into bed was leaning over him, stroking a finger across Harry’s forehead.
Hermione winced.
“He was already dying, you know.”
They headed towards the library and Harry waited until Ron was out of earshot.
“Yeah, Potter, yeah that’s it. Come nice and hard.”
“Go for it, I can get you hard again and suck you dry.”
“Yes! He’s under a lot of pressure. So am I.”
There was chorus of “fines.”
Harry sobbed onto the paving.
“You wouldn’t like me if I was nice.”
Harry closed his eyes and put his hand to his head.
An alarm went off and Harry froze, suddenly remembering where the hell they were.
“Maybe I don’t need it!”
“You like that?”
“That arse Potter, god.” He slapped his hand down on it and Harry jumped, his cock twitching to attention.
Despite Harry’s instance that they were *never* doing it again, they spent most of their nights together in the days after that. They were a bit more sensible about leaving in the morning before anyone else woke up though.
“Spread your legs.” Draco slapped Harry’s thigh.
“God you love it rough, don’t you? ‘Spose you have had a bit of a fucked up childhood. We’re a perfect match. You’re going to love choking on my cock.”
“Yeah, yeah, fuck,” he groaned. Pushing his arse back against Potter’s deliciously long lubed up fingers.
“Yes they’ve bloody told me why! God, you’re all impossible! Letting this monster do what he likes!”
“Yes, Draco...please...please...I need...”
“I don’t know what else to think.”
“Cos I’m hungry. And I’m meant to be watching you.”
“Uhuh,” Harry managed.
“Thank you,” Draco said.
“Fuck!”  Harry yelled. Tight, insanely hot heat.
“Harry James Potter, don’t you walk away from me!”
Draco pulled back and grinned at him.
He said it as if Harry had any power of movement. He picked him up and carried him downstairs again where Lucius had left his broom waiting for him on the table. He carried him outside into the cold night air and put him in front of him on his broomstick.
“You okay?”
“You’ve done something to your hair. Why isn’t it sticking out?”
Draco took his fingers from inside him and Harry heard him undoing his trousers and pushing down his pants. Harrys heart was in his throat, his hand shaking against the wall in anticipation. To want and not want to want something at the same time. It tore him apart.
Harry was sitting in the girls’ bathroom at midnight frowning over a cauldron and seriously regretting his words. The mixture in his cauldron looked like wet soil that had been lurking at the bottom of a drain for several months. It smelt much the same. He was trying to contemplate whether his stubbornness and loathing for his new ‘feelings’ about Malfoy were worth drinking/eating the sludge at the bottom of his cauldron when a pair of size four patent shoes came into view. The sheen on Hermione’s tights glistened in the candlelight.
“Apparently they’ve known for ages, Wormtail knew about it, from when Sirius and him used to be friends at school.”
“Malfoy?” Harry’s head snapped up, trying to find his face in the dark.
“You’re better than that.”
“God, are you all coming into have a look? He’s not an exhibit!” Hermione glared at them all.
Draco smirked a little at Harry’s lack of response. Harry’s face must have shown everything he wanted to say.
Draco snorted.
Draco slid two fingers inside Harry’s mouth, then three, sliding them to the back of his throat till Harry gagged. Draco stroked the back of his head.
“I didn’t know what you liked,” Draco said innocently.
Harry shivered. It was inexplicable that Draco’s skills with spells turned him on.
“Aren’t you supposed to be keeping an eye on me?”
“I am not in love with you,” Harry hissed in his ear.
“Why the fuck would I do that?”
“No. Suck me first.”
He knew it was fruitless. Draco wouldn’t put his family in danger. Anything Harry said would cast doubt on Draco’s allegiance. Hermione grabbed his hand and squeezed it tight. He was relieved that someone knew what was going through his head and shared it with him. Knew his heart was ripping apart as Draco walked across the bridge towards his mother.
Harry ignored him and continued to rock his hips, shuddering every time Draco’s long fingers hit just the right spot.
Draco lifted up Harry’s arm and lay his head on Harry’s chest, putting Harry’s arm around him. Draco let his arm curl round Harry’s waist and twined his legs with Harry’s.
Harry closed his eyes but did as he was told, resentment burning through him already.
They walked into the large entrance hall, finding Lucius waiting for them at the bottom of the stairs.
Harry groaned as he felt the base of his cock tighten.
This was how Voldemort had risen to power. He realised that now. Fear, manipulation, luring people in, holding friends and families to ransom. That and the promise of power.
He pushed Draco off him, much to his muffled objections, and got up to go to the bathroom. It was 7am, a little early to get up, but there was no way he was getting back in that bed with a naked Draco. Forget it.
“Yeah alright.” Draco sighed, kissed him again and pulled himself up and out of the bath. Harry followed him, dazed, already desperate to pull Draco back to him. Draco cast drying spells on them both and they pulled their clothes on in silence. Before Draco left Harry pulled him back and put his arms around him, holding him tight. Draco, to his surprise, didn’t object, but held him back, kissing him on the shoulder before pulling away.
“I don’t believe you deserve to go to Azkaban.”
“No! I fell down the stairs. Really.” He added when she gave him a skeptical look.
Harry frowned.
“Yes, thank you. Just a bit…spinny.”
“Easy Potter. Take it slow.”
“You’d rather it did?”
“You feel real fucking good like that Potter.” Draco slowly stroked Harry’s cock back hard, started to rock his hips.
Harry just looked at him, dazed.
“Maybe I pay a bit more attention than you realise. Relax, Potter.”
Harry groaned as Draco came from nothing but being fucked at his cock against the tiles. His arse clenched around Harry’s cock and Harry cried out as he came, sinking his nails into Draco’s hip. He panted in Draco’s ear as the water continued to run down his back.
“What are you staring at?” Malfoy asked.
He put his hand in between them and ran the palm of his hand down Harry’s hard cock.
“Thereee we go. That’s better.”
“Major.” Draco nodded back, his black polite work expression back in place.
Draco took off his uniform and hung it carefully on the back of his chair. Draco was gorgeous, ivory, lithe, and silver hair curled on his chest and in between his legs.
“You know what people do just before war time, Potter? Especially when it’s very likely that one of them is going to end up dead?”
Harry was sure he was dissolving. Melting, into Draco. Into whatever Draco wanted, needed, him to be.
Harry cringed.
Draco shuddered at the colour of the water coming off him.
Malfoy’s face was getting pink.
Harry slid out of the classroom before Ron and Hermione could miss him and doubled back into one of the alcoves, waiting for all the students to leave for lunch. He watched them look around, shrug, then carry on without him. He couldn’t lie to them. It would be far easier to avoid.
“They were going to throw her down her with me, but I think they thought separating us would be worse for her.”
“Are you a Veela?” Harry blurted, as it occurred to him. He used to think about it before, at school, when they learnt about them. Their pale seductive skin, their ability to make men fall at their feet. Maybe he had fancied Draco at school.
“We don’t have all night,” Harry said.
Malfoy just smirked at him and crawled back into the tent.
Harry nodded, peering into the cauldron.
“Are you serious?” Draco interrupted. “They would have killed us.”
Harry pushed himself harder, wanting all of it, ignoring his throats protesting. He closed his eyes in frustration as he gagged again and yanked his head back, gasping in a breath.
It was a long ride to the Malfoy Manor and Harry felt himself reluctantly relaxing back against Draco as they flew. Draco kissed him briefly on the side of his neck, his arms were already wrapped round Harry; the only thing keeping him on the broom in his still somewhat jelly state. Harry winced. All he could think of was Ron and Hermione’s faces looking up at him...the horror in their eyes.
“You said you wanted us to practice our defence skills, in case-“ Draco started.
Harry sighed, picked up their plates and walked over to the sink, hearing the handcuffs clink as Malfoy dropped them onto the table. Harry turned on the tap and squirted some soap into the bowl, trying to stop himself imagining Draco throwing him back onto the table, clicking the handcuffs around his wrists and fucking his brains out.
“What do you want me to bet, my fucking sandwich?”
Harry frowned.
“A good ride is great for stress relief you know. How long since you get laid boy wonder?”
“Okay. Clear view. For all we’re going to see,” he muttered under his breath.
“Potter you can’t even walk in a straight line.”
Draco ran a hand up Harry’s back.
Harry considered.
Harry spluttered.
“We regret to inform you that due to staff shortages, there is no trolley services or canteen trolley available on this service. Our sincere apologies.”
“Yeah, you want some of that, Malfoy?”
“You look like shit,” Harry told him.
“Yess…” Draco hissed with the air he could catch, cresting higher, unbearably close.
“And Potter?”
“Yes,” Draco moaned. “Yes, yes, yes.”
Draco leant forward to whisper something in Harry’s ear.
Harry gritted his teeth as he tried to go slow, more to annoy Draco than anything else.
“Thank you.”
“Fuck me.”
“Your welcome. Catch you later, boy wonder.” Draco winked at him, turned and vanished through the moving bricks.
“Desperate little slut,” Draco whispered in his hear and Harry groaned.
“That’s sweet. Maybe you should have married her.”
“Now will you fuck me?”
“Ow fuck Malfoy-“
Draco offered him his arm and Harry took it, letting him pull him up.
“Don’t be too hard on yourself Harry. It’s okay to feel angry for what they did to him.”
“You’ve got coffee down your shirt, Minister,” He explained.
“Ohh, Potter you’re a dream.”
“I think my father threw it on the fire.”
Hermione threw her hands up in the air and stormed back out into the hall. It caused Draco great pleasure to think how outraged his father would be to have all these mudblood’s storming around in his house. He’d write a detailed letter to him about it in Azkaban if it wouldn’t compromise their position.
Draco was relentless, sucking and tonguing his balls until Harry was a blathering mess. His hips jerked back and forth and he pulled on his wrists, desperate for the soft wet incredible heat that was Draco’s mouth on his dick.
He found the place and waited, questioning himself as he always did about whether he’d remembered the location correctly. The bricks began to shift with the click clack sound of magic Harry could only dream of understanding.
“Rude. Do you know who I am?”

Harry opens his mouth awkwardly, considering gently removing his body from this, er,

Harry scoffs indignantly. “Like we have any clue as to where we’re going.”

They console a worried Teeny with a few more reassuring remarks (
“Sure, Potter.” He snickers. “You look just like a Weasley. They were always your surrogate family, no? Now you even look the part. Red hair, plenty of freckles—oh no, you’re a tad too short, now, aren’t you?”
“That’s right,” Harry says, plastering a fake smile onto his face. “We’re your friends, Teeny. You can trust us.”
“Shut up.” Draco hisses. “I don’t need you to announce it to the world.” Harry frowns. “If you don’t want to completely embarrass yourself, Potter, I suggest you listen to me and do as I say, starting with the

“Okay,
Harry opens his mouth to protest, but Blaise cuts in. “Just listen to me and things will be so much easier, Potter."
do partners, they don’t with Malfoys.”
“Right.” Harry says under his breath, still in a slight daze, and walks out to confront the disgruntled, tired faces of Blaise and Theo. They’ve started to poke and prod at the dripping mess (which Harry doesn’t quite think is eggs and toast anymore), and their expressions lighten up considerably when Harry enters the room, bringing the delicious scent of pancakes with him.
“Listen, Zabini, I’m not just here for any reason, Malfoy and I are—“
“How come

in them."
Harry shrugs. “He left of his own accord.”
Harry’s mouth drops open, and he runs a quick tally of the traits the woman had described in his head—they fit the two Slytherins perfectly. He nods grudgingly, not wanting to give Draco the chance to start gloating. Thankfully, Draco merely grabs his arm again—Harry was really beginning to wish he hadn’t heard the part about
been greater, stronger, and better a man than he ever was, and he was only now discovering it. He was scared to tell you about the Time-Turner, scared you’d continue to push yourself even when he was gone, scared you’d be unable to throw away the expectations he’d forced upon you and, yes, go ahead with the plan. He was scared for you, Draco—he wanted to protect you.” Theo gently closes the lid of the box, sliding it over the table. “He loved you.”
Harry pours some of it onto his hand, and feels a cool, calming sensation spreading. “That’s so much better.” He frowns. “Also, why am I Potter again?”
“Liked, I meant liked.” He corrects automatically. Harry cocks his head, raising his eyebrows. “Fine. I said loved. Happy?”
Harry grins back. “And I always thought they were so graceful.”
“Don’t ask.” Draco holds up a finger and tosses him a whisk. “And I can’t do all the work here, can I? Whisk up, Potter.” He points to the far right corner where a salt shaker is tilting itself over a bowl, straightening up and returning to its original place after giving a final, decisive shake.
.” Draco grumbles. “And she was thrashing so badly, it was hard to get her to comply.”
“We didn’t want to make a big deal out of it.” Draco continues. “My mother and I had to pay at least a dozen news outlets and media companies not to publish it as the front page article or whatnot. We already had enough grief and sadness to deal with as it was—we didn’t need to see witches and wizards grumbling about how he’d never received proper punishment—how it had been a, a
Draco’s sitting on the edge of the bed, his back to Harry. “I keep forgetting you were pretty much raised as a Muggle.” He says resignedly.
“Which working style? I don’t know which one you’re talking about because you obviously do not have one.” She huffs, twisting around to face Harry. “And Harry, did you send Slughorn to come pester me? I had to promise him a private visit to the Ministry to get him off my back—that and my word to include him in my inauguration speech when I’m elected Minister of Magic. He said when, not if,” she adds, a hint of pride in her voice.
“What you’re trying to say is, you used to be a human house-elf,” Draco snickers, striding into the room, and Harry rolls his eyes.
“Unfortunately, Wizarding households operate slightly differently.” Theo replies, appearing in the doorway and shrugging. “You can try if you want, though.”
“Fine. Then I’ll be your idiot and you be my prat.”
He was not going to let some gossiping witches do weird things to his brain.
Teeny nods bracingly, determined. She reaches a trembling hand out, knobby fingers curling on the bottle, and tipping her head back—drains half the bottle.
“Of course,” he says, sounding even more interested than before. “I like your scar.”
“Wow, I’m impressed, Malfoy.” Blaise says, watching the plates soar over their heads and wiping his mouth with his napkin. “I thought you didn’t know where the plates went.”
“—not to mention that he was the reason I found my knickers dangling from a fucking makeshift Quidditch hoop at the Head Table on Christmas morning.”
“Now I’d be delighted, just as long as it was with my daughter instead, imagine the fortune and fame he’d bring with him—“

“So, uh… This is where we get going, huh?”
“Well, I
“The love potion wasn’t for you to start drooling over Weasley,” Blaise interrupts, eyes sliding over to Draco, whose cheeks were beginning to rapidly flush with color. “You were supposed to fall in love with the first person you laid eyes on, and that person was supposed to be—“
Harry and Draco look at her, at each other, then back at her. Harry curses under his breath while Draco pinches the bridge of his nose and heaves a long, agonized sigh.
“You’re drooling.”
“Because he’s dumb and reckless and he doesn’t know how to turn people down.” Draco appears around the corner, strolling in their direction. He reaches a hand out, smiling pleasantly. “Draco Malfoy. I’m here with Harry.”
“As a matter of fact, I have. More than once.” He says nonchalantly, folding the paper. “I’ve seen you there, too. Well, more like stalked.”
rather possessive.”
He scowls. “Yes. Stop bullying us.”
“Fun?” Harry snorted. “Absolutely. I’m enjoying entertainment at its finest.”
Blaise shakes his head. “You understand him. You’re—you’re similar in ways you don’t see. Trust me on this.”
Draco rolls his eyes. “What is it, Potter? Say it.”
“The trouble he went to trying to hide it from us,” Blaise adds.
Harry doesn’t know whether to laugh or punch them in the face, so he settles for an awkward nod and shuffles inside. Theo hoists a drowsy Teeny onto his back, and Harry tries his best not to look too surprised, but he turns around and says, “Draco isn’t the only one who’s chosen to reflect on their past.”
“Twenty minutes and nineteen seconds.” Harry supplies. “Not that I know for sure,” he adds hastily.
Harry nods stiltedly, although he didn’t—couldn’t—know what that would feel like. He had always known that Draco had had a rough relationship with his father, but dismissed it with the thought that he was lucky to be dealing with those problems, as it meant that he, at the very least, had a father.
Harry barely suppresses the urge to lose his temper, and decides to handle his initial task first. He faces Teeny, who’s singing what sounds like a nursery rhyme but has lyrics like
“Polyjuice. It’ll turn you into a Muggle that I captured specifically for this purpose a few years ago.” He explains, then tilts his head. “Don’t tell Granger that.”
“Really? The frying pan?” Draco mutters under his breath, but continues to stir anyway. Harry bites back a sheepish grin, but he suddenly notices Draco’s warm breath ghosting on the back of his neck and freezes. It was too much. Harry could duel renounced Dark wizards and break into Gringotts and survive a myriad of encounters with beasts even Hagrid would find not so much cute as terrifying—but he could not just stay there, while Draco Malfoy’s platinum locks brushed against his ears as he leaned over to check the state of the batter and his soft
