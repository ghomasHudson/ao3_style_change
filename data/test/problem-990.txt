He moved to pull the blankets back again, but heard a muffled “If you plan on keeping your hands attached to your body, I suggest you remove them from the blankets.”
Once they’d finished with Healer Walkins and obtained the pain relieving potion for Harry, they stopped off for a small lunch at a nearby cafe.
“Really, Weasley? I expected you to have some sense of brains in that thick-headed skull of yours.” Draco said, rolling his eyes.
He walked over to his room and sat down on the bed. He soon found it was very comfy and his eyelids felt ten times heavier. He cast a quick Tempus charm: 8:05. He thought a nap would do him some good, seeing as he had a hell of a long day. First his trial, then Harry's defensive outburst, then more of his trial, then that discussion with Kingsley, then coming home with Harry Potter-
“There’s another thing we are wondering about.” Draco said. He wanted to bring it up now, that they had gotten the answers to their previous questions. “Can-can the prophecy control emotions, acts or thoughts?” Draco needed to know. He trusted Harry, but you can never be too careful with magic. He didn’t know what he’d do if everything Harry had said and did was all a lie.
She shook her head. “No, I’m not mad. Extremely confused, but not mad. I didn’t know you two have grown so close over the past few days.”
When Draco looked out the window from the sitting area to see Harry’s naked arse being submerged in the ocean, he nearly fell out of his chair.
“Oh, Harry!” Hermione said, coming down the stairs. She strode right over to Harry and hugged him tightly, however, nothing like the embrace Ron and Harry had shared.
He sighed. “I wouldn’t get on with it, so he said something, uh ‘I’ll find someone that’s able to’ you know…”
Harry humphed. Draco escaped the grasp and rolled onto the floor. “You claim to love me but you won’t even touch me.”
“No, you’re absolutely correct, Mr Potter. From what Healer Marigold has told me, your health has improved majorly since last night. I want to run a few diagnostic tests as well as prescribe some replenative and preventative potions from making this worse than it is. If all is well, you’re good to head home.” Walkins says with a smile.
They ate in a comfortable silence for a while, before Harry decided to break it. “So, I was thinking…”
“You know, I don’t need to deal with this. I’m tired of your attitude.” Harry said. He walked past Draco and up the stairs, heading to the bathroom to take a long hot bath.
Longest chapter I’ve ever written. Enjoy! (I love receiving comments about my work: suggestions, edits, criticism and compliments. They give me ideas :))
One particular comment, something to do with 'no good Death Eater scum', as Harry believed he heard, made him grip the bench so tightly, it made an ominous creaking sound and a few splinters found their way into his skin. He rubbed them gingerly and avoided the questioning gazes from the few that heard it.
“Harry?” Both Ron and Hermione’s voices could be heard from different places in the house. They came by after dropping their luggage and things at Grimmauld Place. They still hadn't decided on where they were going to live, but they decided to stay there temporarily until they found a place of their own.
“I am not!” Harry laughed. “Come here, you oaf.” and with that, he kissed him till they both were breathless and hungry.
Oh my gosh it's long and fluffy and angsty I hope you guys like it. I tried to add more Alpha/Omega info in it. It took me too long to figure out how this chapter was going to go but here it is!
“Someone’s in a good mood.” Draco realized, as Harry approached his side of the bed. He leaned down and kissed him square on the mouth. It immediately made Draco light headed. He accepted the kiss happily, albeit confused.
“Harry, is everything all right?” Draco asked, padding down the stairs as Ron continued to vomit in the bucket. “Ha, slugs.” Draco laughed, clearly thinking the same thing as Harry.
He never calls her Parkinson, only when he’s really mad or serious. “I swear, Pansy. I don’t want him to be embarrassed by me. We haven’t established anything, yet. I don’t want people finding out, then tormenting him because he’s with a marked Death Eater, and him leaving me, all because you have a big mouth. I fucking swear, if you ruin this for me-”
Harry seemed to deflate a little at draco’s words. “Alright, but I don’t want to be here for longer than I have to.”
As Harry gave the two hugs goodbye and waved them off, Draco approached him, hands stuffed into his pockets, and a glumish look in his eyes he tried to hide with a half smile.
“Stop that now, Draco.” Harry ground out. It was fierce, powerful even, making Draco obey the Alpha’s command. “Now, I assure you, you aren’t working alongside criminals. They’ve all been put away in Azkaban or dealt with otherwise. And another thing, I am not going to be Minister, nor am I so ‘worshiped’ as you believe me to be. Now settle down, or you will lose this fight. Do I make myself understood?” Harry overpowered Draco, who’d reversed their positions. Draco was sitting as Harry towered over him with his mighty presence.
“Ok honey.” Harry kissed his forehead and quickly slipped out of bed to get the potions from their bathroom. When he returned with three different vials, he uncorked them and set them on the nightstand beside his lover. “Anything else I can get you?” He placed the back of his hand to Draco's head before sharply inhaling. “Sweetheart you're burning. I'll get you a cloth.” He moved to the bathroom again and returned with a cold wet cloth. He charmed it to stay that way. After Draco had downed all the potions and lay back down with the cloth on his forehead, Harry sat on the edge of the bed running his hands through the blond hair in a soothing manner.
Her expression was cool and calm. Harry didn’t know if that was a good thing or a bad one. “Together as in ‘together together’?” She asked and Harry nodded. She took a deep breath before she stood and made her way over to the shrieking pot on the stove. She poured them both cups of tea, and another one for who Harry presumed was for Draco. She placed his cup in front of him and sat across from him again, taking a calm sip from her cup. “I casted a cooling charm.” She said gesturing to his cup.
Draco knew Harry needed him, he said it everyday, obviously making Draco believe him. He believed him so much because Draco knew he felt the same way. He thought of all the light kisses they’d share when Draco brought Harry a cup of tea, or when Harry would card his hand through Draco’s hair as they cuddled on the couch watching the telly. He smiled, remembering how much he really loved all those times, and how much he really, really loved Harry. And when he felt strong arms return to their place around his waist and a warm body press against his back, he knew everything would be alright.
Since they were already naked, no undressing was required. Draco pushed Harry onto the bed and crawled over top of him.
Draco and Harry loved each other immensely, and although a prophecy was to thank for bringing the two together, it certainly wasn’t needed for them to show how they truly felt about one another.
He kept thinking about the blond, and the day's events. He was tired, yes, but this situation seemed to keep his mind occupied farther than his exhaustion could reach.
“What’s in it for me?” Draco asked, not really expecting anything, just wanting to play around with Harry.
“‘Ight, mate. We’ll come through then.” Ron and Hermione emerged from the green flames moments later.
“WHAT?!” Draco shouted, pulling back to see Harry smiling. “Are you kidding me right now?” Harry shook his head. “Weasley said you were talking to Kingsley about a promotion, but I didn’t know it was this fucking big?!”
"Good morning. I made some breakfast on the stove for you." Draco said, not bothering to look up from the paper.
Harry was right, of course, as Draco could feel his back arching uncomfortably and his wrists stinging with the force of Harry’s grip.
“It’s out of control and downright annoying right now. I’m sure you can do something to stop all of this.” Harry was pleading with the minister to put an end to this madness.
Draco wanted to pull his hair out. On one hand, he wanted to scream at Harry because he doesn’t know that Draco loves him and he can’t tell him. On the other hand he wanted to snog him senseless because he was right. They were having a good time in there and Draco always has to take everything to heart.
“Each cursed mail is three regular envelopes. Takes about the same amount of time to send off a cursed as it is for a couple regulars.”
“I was really concerned as to why this happened, seeing as Harry has had no previous experiences with seizures. So, naturally, I took to my books and found out that- oh, hi Harry. How are you feeling?” she said upon entering the room.
“Um, I’m actually unsure about that, to be completely honest with you.” Hermione responded, blotting her mouth with a napkin.
In one fluid motion, he kissed Draco so powerfully, drawing his attention to their lips, as he slowly breached the blond. As soon as he bottomed out, Draco ripped his lips away, turned his face and screamed, tears pooling in the corners of his eyes.
Draco, however, paled and looked almost panicked again. Harry just wanted to smooth the worry right out of his features. He opened his mouth to reply, then when no sound came out, quickly shut it again. He dropped his gaze to his fiddling hands and finally replied almost in a whisper, "I guess so. I don't really have a choice, or any other option for that matter."
Draco smiled. He turned towards Harry’s chest and kissed him languidly. “I suppose owning my own potions shop would be nice. Maybe buy a house, now that we have each other to live with. Maybe… a cat to keep us company.” Draco said.
“Well, from what you and Ms Granger have told us, when you found Mr Malfoy, he was emotionally unstable. His mental state was probably what was compromised when the spell hit, seeing as emotionality and mentality are connected strongly through neurological attachments.” Madame Pomfrey supplied.
Draco sighed deeply before gritting his teeth and saying “I'm not getting sick. Malfoy's don't get sick.” He stood abruptly, grabbed his tea and swiftly left the kitchen, leaving behind an annoyed and deeply concerned Harry.
Harry's smile reached from ear to ear and the sight made Draco's heart warm. “No, I suppose not. Hang on, I'm coming down.” Harry turned back to his study for a moment and Draco made his way to the kitchen.
“Healer Walkins," Draco adressed the woman. "Hypothetically, if someone said they loved their partner, they couldn’t be lying due to the prophecy making them feel the love, right?”
Harry, after watching his friends leave, turned back to the blond and said, "well, come on then." before he walked towards the Floo networks. He barely caught a glimpse of blond following behind him through the long, twisting corridors.
Harry shook his head, saying “No, it’s fine. I love them.” Draco smiled and felt his cheeks heat as he looked back down to what he was doing. Harry sat down beside him and they stayed there in silence before Harry asked “Is there anything I can do?”
“I came to apologize for my behaviour. I know that you’re just trying to help us, and I’m making everything more difficult. To be honest with you, I don’t know what’s happening; I can’t control anything. Not my moods, not even my magic. Once I lose control, it’s very difficult for me to gain it back again. I feel like I’m constantly fighting with myself, but barely, because I only lose control one side, the other I have no grasp on. So, I just wanted you to know that. And I’m sorry.”
“So that’s why they want you to watch over me. So that if anything goes wrong, you can save me. Oh, I love being saved by you, Harry.” Malfoy said. Any other day and Harry would’ve thought that was a jab at his self esteem, but with the pure look of admiration in the blond’s features, he knew it was anything but.
After a few seconds, the thought of what was happening penetrated Harry’s mind and he finally pushed the blond away, causing him to land hard on the floor.
Harry pulled off Draco’s tie, Draco pushed off Harry’s jacket. Harry slipped off Draco’s jacket and Draco untied Harry’s tie. They both started to unbutton each other’s shirts.
Draco looks down at him, a smirk forming on his features. “And what, pray tell, would you do if I don’t?” He says hotly, climbing back over Harry and pressing himself into the others’ body.
Draco’s cheeks heated and he ducked his head into Harry’s neck. Strong arms tightened around him further. “Me too.” He mumbled.
Harry nodded. They were enjoying breakfast in the Great Hall, while Harry told the events of that morning.
“I’ll speak with you outside.” he said, not stopping and walking right past Harry to just outside the shop doors. Potter followed willingly.
“Don’t I know it. She out ranked me multiple times in multiple classes, back in school. She’s great, but man did that hurt.” Draco chuckles.
The Omega was drooling before he realized what he was doing. Quickly wiping the back of his hand on his lips, he stood and moved to the dresser to change. He could see Harry in the bathroom mirror, fiddling with some kind of potion flask that Draco didn’t know what it was for. Shuffling towards the bathroom, a question on his lips, Draco abruptly stopped as Harry shut the door. He didn’t even see Harry looking back at him.
A week had passed and everything was going really well to Harry’s surprise. He was a little worried about Draco falling back into the ignorant git he used to be, but Draco proved him wrong. He was extremely helpful now that he was more comfortable being around Harry. He’d helped organize a schedule for Harry, sorted through his mail with him, even went as far as arranging meetings with Kingsley and other important Ministry members.
“Yeah, it’s not going to be easy, but at least we know what to expect and how to handle each situation.” Draco replied.
“I was just letting you know.” He said affirmatively, masking his attraction for the man in front of him.
Harry broadcasted a smile that was full of so much love and adoration, Draco almost wanted to look away.
“Say another word about it and I’ll kick you out.” Draco said threateningly. “I’m a beautician Potter, not a linguist. Although my lexicon is particularly diverse, compared to your barbaric, subpar, plebeian vocabulary.” he might as well have stuck his nose high into the air with the level of ponce that radiated off of him.
Harry sat down at the kitchen table and thought back to what Hermione said. ‘Wait until he comes to you.’
“Harry!” He shouted, but above the constant chattering and voices that flooded the Auror offices at a never ending rate, it wasn’t a very loud shout, barely making it over the voices of the other Aurors.
He stood, stretched, and padded towards the door. He knocked a few times, but when there was no response, he opened the door to just a sliver so Draco could hear him better.
Draco's eyes widened drastically and he became a rosy pink that complimented his pale complection. "Um - I, uh - what - who - um.." he stuttered. Harry thought he looked very cute. He took in a deep, shaky breath and ran his hands through his hair again. He paused for a moment before he abruptly stood and left the kitchen without another word.
“Ah! Harry!” Draco cried, bucking up violently. Harry pressed a hand over his hips to keep them down, before swallowing him again.
Harry smiled. "None of that. You can borrow mine until we can go shopping." He started back up the stairs and entered his room. He quickly returned with a pair of comfy black slacks, a dark blue sweater, a pair of red pyjamas, and a few pairs of briefs. "I know sharing underwear must be really weird with your old school nemesis but its better than probably what you have right now. They're clean, obviously." He said with a shrug. He handed the pile of neatly folded clothes over to Draco who took them gratefully.
“Where? I don’t- oh, Harry. My Harry!” Draco exclaimed, trying to extract himself out of Madame Pomfrey’s grip.
Ron Levitated him to sit down beside him. “I will set you free because I’m not feeding you. But if you make so much as shift towards Harry, I will bind you back up and drown you in the Black Lake. Got it?” Ron said.
Joey bit down a sudden grin and pretended as if she hadn’t heard his slip-up. “He told me about… you know.”
Joey sighed. She released Draco and let her gun-wielding hand fall to her side. Draco let out a breath, trembling from head to foot as he took his seat once more.
“Also, if he’s that willing to cut you out, he’s probably not worth it in the first place,” Ron chimes in, towel in hand.
Waiting for Draco hurt like hell, but the pain faded immediately when Harry saw him. Poised and postured as usual, though the shadows beneath his eyes and slightly mussed hair implied he hadn’t been sleeping well. Draco caught his boyfriend’s attention from across the hallway before Defense class, his silver eyes gleaming, wearing a meaningful look that made it clear he had much to talk about.
"I wonder if he actually wrote it." Hermione tapped her chin thoughtfully. "Maybe his mother did?" Harry had informed his two friends of Narcissa's betrayal to the Dark Lord in the Forbidden Forest, and they were now aware of her softer side.
“Ah. Well, you’ve got a good head shape for it,” Ron said sagely. Draco raised an eyebrow at him, but everyone else seemed to find this acceptable.
Part of him had longed for the day that Lucius regained his sanity, so he could get some sort of closure. Maybe they could reconcile, and Lucius would come to terms with the fact that Draco would never bring home a pureblood woman. Then again, who was Draco kidding? Lucius Malfoy was the most stubborn and hateful man Draco knew. It would take him another lifetime to grow into the loving father Draco truly needed. But this was the only lifetime they had.
“Sure.” A cozy silence fell upon the room as Harry flipped through the pages, occasionally scratching out a signature. As Draco sipped his throat-searing whiskey, he watched Harry work, bent over the paper and biting his lip in concentration. Draco wondered idly if Harry bit his lip the same way during sex - he didn’t in videos, but porn stars often made love differently off-camera.
Summer stretched tantalizingly before the young Aurors-in-training at Cambridge Academy. Like everyone else, Harry was looking forward to traveling, soaking in London’s rare sunshine, and practicing the new spells he’d learned that year. But for the first Saturday on holiday, Harry was satisfied with a small birthday party in the backyard of Malfoy Manor, attended by his three-year-old godson and best mates, instead of dreaded half-acquaintances he had no skills to entertain.
His heart dropped. The Mark was still there, plain as day, though its color had changed from a deep black to a light crimson.
“I wanted to see what it would be like. To take care of him for a while, as a couple. She said we could take him to London over Christmas.”
is a romanization of a Thai word that roughly means attacker or abuser, used ironically by the Following as they are named after the very thing they claim to fight against.]
Feeling his face grow warm, Harry pulled his gaze away and fixed it resolutely on the board, though he knew, without looking, that Draco was smirking.
Padma rolled her eyes. “Obviously not, Gavin. Can you stop being a pain in the arse for two seconds?”
, Draco thought resolutely, glaring at it. “We’ll deal with it later,” He declared, waving his wand over his torn sleeve, and it inched to cover the Mark. Connors’s brow was still furrowed in concern, but Harry’s cautious smile spoke pride. “So, Dahlia needs us for something?”
The walk from the apartment is a short, biting one - the brightness of the day is deceptive, and the wind blows just as icily as the night before. Harry is eager to get back into his apartment, and he dials the thermostat as soon as he and Draco walk in.
“Oh, you will,” He replied and jerked his head vaguely down the street. “The bald man in black. He’ll take care of you. Goodbye, now. And good luck.” Before Joey could ask any more questions, Auror Henderson Melocotones swept back up the stairs without a second glance.
What to do now? Pansy hesitates on the threshold. Draco is the first man to be there for her, to hold her like she means something, to compliment her without expecting a kiss back. She can’t let go of a love like that. She refuses.
The door to Draco’s room was a touch ajar - not exactly inviting, but Harry pushed it open anyway. Inside, Draco walked absentmindedly back and forth, face buried in a thin stack of parchment, blond hair gleaming in the lamplight.
It was the first time Ron had addressed Draco by his first name, and he looked slightly awkward doing it. But Draco’s expression had become pleased at Ron’s last statement; so had Harry’s, in fact - he was delighted that Ron had finally accepted Draco as more than just another untrustworthy Malfoy.
Pink hair stands out against the warm reds, greens, and browns of The Raven and the Mushroom. Draco practically lounges against the cash register as he takes people’s orders. It’s a slow day today, and Harry walks right up to him in the middle of his shift, box in hand.
“What’s their problem?” Ron interjected. “It shouldn’t matter to them. People can love who they want.”
“One day, a bird flew over the desert and dropped a seed next to the poisonous flower. A rose grew there.”
“In truth…” Henderson cleared his throat. “Yes, I suppose there is. A sector of underground Manila was overlooked in our planning. Miss - pardon me - Auror Clarke had to evacuate it by herself.”
Malfoy forces a laugh, high-pitched, a little insane. “Why would I want to be friends with you, Potter? You’re just another thick football bastard with a head so big he can’t fit it up his own arse.”
“Don’t ask what’s wrong,” Draco said, his voice breaking as Harry approached. “You…you wouldn’t get it.”
“No harm…!” Harry took furious steps towards her. His hands were clenched so hard that his nails dug painfully into his palms. Gun or no, he was about ready to sock her in the face. “He could have died!”
“Quidditch finals are coming up soon,” Harry cut in, feeling terribly uncomfortable. “Do you, um, think Ravenclaw’s well set to beat Gryffindor?” He regretted the question immediately, and Draco elbowed him sharply.
The words slip out before he can stop them. Suddenly, Draco is more awake, his melting mercury eyes turning into cold steel. “A nympho?” He echoes, voice freezing over, though Harry notices the crack of emotion right before he dons a mask of indifference. “Is that all you think of me?”
,” while simultaneously drawing her wand back. Owen suddenly appeared to be moving in slow motion; the whole class could see his wand raise as if going through molasses.
Those left behind. Like George, the broken half of a whole, wearing a constant mask of a smile to hide the pain beneath. Harry had spoken to him soon after graduation, telling him about his dream, or his vision rather, of Fred visiting him beyond the grave. He’d made it clear he wasn’t sure if the dream was real or not, but George had appreciated it nevertheless and was both melancholy and glad at the news that his brother would be there for him in whatever afterlife came next.
“Good. Listen carefully.” Draco drew himself up to his full height, donning the authoritative persona he’d developed in preparation for Auror work. “Get yourselves out of here and wait. There will be people like me,” He gestured to his uniform, “Waiting to bring you to the surface.”
Harry is hesitant to get rid of the dozen vinyls of Draco’s favorite albums, which will no doubt stand out amidst his own collection of jazz and old pop. He tosses the shoegaze and hard metal but can’t bear to part with
Dahlia dug around in her jeans pocket, pulling out an amulet made from gold, its charm dangling with a ruby that glistened as if on fire.
For a terrifying, fleeting moment, Draco wants to join them in whatever heroic quest they’re undertaking. But then he spots the mask of an infiltrating Death Eater, and he remembers what side he’s on in this godforsaken war. Leaving Goyle unconscious by the wall, Draco brushes off his clothes and grits his teeth. Whether he has a wand or not, he knows exactly who he serves. And Voldemort won’t hesitate to kill him lest he forgets that.
One thing Harry knew for sure: so close to the ground, at the edge of the Forbidden Forest, that was not a Quidditch robe he just saw. Ignoring Ginny’s shouts, he flew straight down, branches tugging at his limbs as he glided through the treetops and landed.
Everything was new, delicate, and unexplored. Draco still kept an unyielding wall around his soul, but a small part of Harry yearned to pull it back, brick by brick.
“Blimey, you sound like Hermione,” Ron remarked, genuinely concerned at this proof of their similarities.
Her words painted such an accurate portrait of Draco, Harry was embarrassed that he hadn’t seen it sooner - that Draco would be much happier sweating over a cauldron than on the battlefield. Harry knew that in his heart of hearts, so why didn’t he connect the dots?
Number two: Henrietta was in love with him. Supposedly, anyway. Draco couldn’t believe that anyone would ever love him…except for the fact that Potter did. Which brought him to his next point.
“The Following,” Harry concluded. “They’ve got to be the ones tracking us.” He turned to Ray, who had been listening with polite interest. “Do you know anything about them?”
Luna and Ginny held up their poster and cheered loudly for Ravenclaw as Madam Hooch blew her whistle, and the players flew into action. The green- and blue-decorated spectators whooped and hollered as the game began, but Draco did not join in. Instead, he simply watched the pitch intently, eyes scouring the space. Harry recognized his movements immediately; the Slytherin was searching for the Snitch.
Malfoy gave Harry his trademark smirk, which Harry wanted to immediately wipe off his handsome face. The solution, naturally, was to kiss him.
Ron blinked, bemused. “Er…” He looked to his friends, but even Hermione was stumped. “Agatha?” He guessed. The Fat Lady frowned and sniffed in response.
“I’m sorry.” Hermione’s hand soothingly rubs Harry’s arm. Her curly hair spills over her shoulders, framing a deep brown face furrowed with worry. “That’s awful.”
This is the Draco Harry loves. This is who he misses, who was taken away from him with a couple of fancy electrodes and a broken heart with nothing to lose.
Draco stops dead. Somewhere far away, metal shutters crash down upon tile, echoing through the cold chamber of the mall. “What?”
He writes, then thinks to himself, that’s because I’m a shy bastard who has the social skills of a college freshman.
The quarter moon shone hesitantly onto the glittering snow, peeking its bright and curious face around the earth’s shadow. Standing beneath the crest of the hill was the town of Ottery St Catchpole. Windows from the many homes glittered with cheer, the solemn and silent church steeple standing over them like a mother watching her children. Within most houses gathered groups of family and friends, both wizards and Muggles, winding down after a well-spent, peaceful Christmas. The Burrow was no different, though, with six teenagers residing inside, it was a bit more chaotic than usual.
“He’s not on the map. He dropped off the map, I have no idea where he…” Justin breaks off, abandoning the computer, and reaches for Harry’s house phone instead, dialing Pansy’s number as fast as possible. “Come on, pick up, pick up…”
For once, Harry did not feel the instinct to search for Draco’s white-blond head within the crowd. He felt, for the moment, satisfied and fulfilled with just Ron and Hermione’s company, though their hands were entwined and his empty. Harry wanted to fool himself for a little while longer, telling himself that he didn’t need Draco - it’d be safer for them if they found other, more suitable partners. But at the same time, Harry knew the tug of his heartstrings would overcome logic, just as it always had, and he’d be in Draco’s arms at nightfall. Harry only hoped he’d never have to choose between his two friends and the former Death Eater - he wasn’t sure he could.
Amidst the youthful chaos, Draco Malfoy had vanished. Harry tried not to worry about it too much; many people periodically left from the party, usually to make out with their significant other. Harry suspected that Hermione and Ron, though both claiming to go to bed, had gone off to do the same after a couple hours. It was thus that the Boy Who Lived found himself alone and tipsy at midnight.
“Foolish boy.” Hundreds of voices boomed in unison across the clearing. Dao’s tiger mask seemed to snarl as she raised her hands, and Harry and Draco were dragged like ragdolls to face her, their arms pinned to their sides. Harry noticed, with satisfaction, that Dao’s hands were shaking. Though still having tenfold the power of an average wizard’s, the spell that imprisoned him was weaker than her last.
“I would have stopped them,” Harry says half-heartedly, ignoring this last comment. Can he really face down his team on his own? He doubts it.
The potion’s surface suddenly became a translucent, rose pink, and the scent of fresh tangerines drifted through the air. Harry and Draco both sighed in relief.
“Been such a pig-headed jerk?” Draco offers, a real grin tugging at his lips, and Harry falls silent in surprise. “Don’t worry about it, Potter. Most teenage boys are like that. You were kinder than the rest of them.”
"Does he ever get like that with you? Without the potion?" Harry asked, tilting his head towards Ron.
Justin rolls his eyes and returns to typing away at the computer. Luna watches the screen intently for a few moments, then glances to Harry.
She pulls away. Luna breathes hard, swollen lips and pleading eyes craving more, more, but Padma feels the inexorable piercing of something terribly wrong, and she looks to the window.
The hotel’s mezzanine glowed with opulence, even more so than the lobby. Plush, maroon velvet sofas were flanked by gilded end tables on either side, set with bowls of questionable but fragrant potpourri or vases overflowing with flowers. The carpet, soft, patterned with red-and-gold paisley, held the faint, telltale streaks of a vacuum.
Draco held up his wand, still marveling at the magic it had performed only moments before. “Yes,” He replied, and he wasn’t lying, not even to himself. “I know I can.”
Harry Potter. Draco spared him one last glance at the threshold. The Gryffindor looked even younger asleep, his untidy jet hair sticking up adorably every which way. Draco sighed, his hand pausing on the doorknob. He could no longer deny it, looking at the Boy Who Lived as he slumbered. Draco’s feelings from his youth had selfishly resurfaced; his admiration of Harry’s courage and kindness was reluctantly turning into affection.
The night outside the house roared with the absence of silence. Cicadas, crickets, and tree frogs tried to shout over each other, joined by the goats’ sleepy bleating in their enclosure. Even the flora made sounds, creaking branches and leaves rustling in the slightest breeze. All the noise provided a shelter for prey and camouflage for stalking predators.
Harry thought to himself, then Draco said something under his breath. “Are you talking to me?” Harry asked him with a nudge.
The pair enjoyed the display for the better part of a half-hour, alternating amicable sidelong glances with sips of potent whiskey. The fireworks bloomed like neon flowers against the black velvet of the sky, and Draco let himself relax, listening to the muffled pyrotechnic booms through the thick glass.
Harry knew it just by instinct, but a few moments of memory-searching presented him with a solid reason. "Well, you didn't rat me out. In Malfoy Manor. You knew it was me."
“Then I’ll be drunk in peace,” Draco replies, and his voice is still low, and close, hissing like water on hot pavement. He downs the whiskey in one go, shuddering as it sears his throat. The crowd shifts abruptly as another party crowds in, and Draco’s suddenly pressed against Harry, face nearly buried against his neck.
Trust shone in emerald-green behind the round spectacles, already gathering dust again. Joey wondered if Harry really trusted her, or if he was putting up a front. It was true that the trio had settled into a rhythm of looking out for each other the past few days: Draco and Harry did spellwork and talked to people, Joey kept their supplies in line, and all three took night watches. Since they hit land, Joey had done her best to appear a model, law-abiding Auror will no ill will borne towards her teammates.
“No!” Harry clapped his hand over Draco’s mouth, but Dao’s power, combined with the dementor’s, drew Draco’s soul slowly through Harry’s fingers. “No…Stop! Stop it!” Harry was crying now, watching helplessly as the spark in Draco’s eyes dwindled away.
“I know you don’t.” Draco prefers thrillers, action - horror on occasion, though he can’t stand gore if it exists for its own sake. He’s told Harry before. “I liked it.”
“Yes. Hard work and a creative mind, then.” Luna exhales, smoke wreathing her bright blonde hair like the halo of a goddess. “I admire her.”
Seeing the distressed look on Harry’s face, Hermione began to hurry them along beside the train. “Er…we really should be going, or all the good seats will be taken.”
Harry turned away from her after she spoke, watching Draco intently. The Slytherin’s jaw was already working - from anger? Harry wondered. Or was he imagining things?
“Don’t kill him! DON’T KILL HIM!” Draco yells at them both. He knows the Dark Lord wants to murder the Boy Who Lived himself, but even beyond that, Draco can’t bear to see Potter dead. Not yet, at least.
Harry took a deep breath, hoping to high heaven that Draco was ready to retaliate if the witch did not like his answer. “No,” He said firmly. “I won’t go with people I don’t know. Especially if they attack the school I care about. A school that I still go to, by the way,” He added.
The computer beeps as another memory is wiped. The pixels began to tear through the virtual flesh of another.
“I only procrastinate because I know you’ll help me,” Ginny replied, dramatically batting her eyelashes.
Percy’s nostrils flared. “I do wish you had sent me an owl too, Mother,” He said bitterly, and sat down hard in his chair.
Draco repeated a string of similar thoughts all the way down the lift until they got to the entrance. He told Marisa to find out if Narcissa and Lucius could have separate cells and joined the other guard back in the boat.
Not to mention that Harry could no longer ignore that he found Draco attractive. Objectively. At least he thought so…
In her arms is a box. Colorful pens, her lucky river stone paperweight, her calendar, everything she used at Lockhart, plus a file and a cassette tape. She opens the trunk with some difficulty, the box clutched to her chest. It’ll take about three trips to move all the records to her house, Luna estimates. Will Padma stop her when she finds out?
“Hello, everyone. I know you’re all excited to fly, but-” Ginny glanced at Harry again, who stood next to her. “Potter, could you stand with our prospective players, please?”
“All right,” Harry said finally. He pursed his lips, then took a swig of tea. Usually, Draco could read him like an open book, but tonight held one of those rare moments when Harry purposely kept his thoughts to himself. “I’m hungry for eggs. D’you want some?”
Then Harry feels it, like a million digital eyes watching them. Then tendrils of data begin to tug, gently, at Draco’s coat.
“Isn’t that funny,” Pansy jeered. “Look how little Potter does whatever Draco tells him to, Henrietta. Like a dog.”
The vial flew, crystalline and golden, through the air. Harry saw and heard it land for a split second, then the glass shattered.
Harry looked up from their Potions textbook and peered into the cauldron. “…Neither?” He offered, shrugging. “Fuchsia? I dunno.”
The sequel will probably start to be published around Christmas. Until then, I’ll take a short break to finish another Drarry fanfiction that I started on a whim in late summer. It’s based heavily off a Charlie Kaufman film, so the story isn’t exactly original, but I’ve had a rollicking good time putting it on paper nevertheless. I hope you’ll enjoy that one as well :)
, Draco told himself, and reached out instead, tangling his fingers through Harry’s locks. Harry’s lips curved, and he turned his head slightly to kiss the inside of Draco’s wrist.
They continued along in this vein up until it was time to leave the Burrow. Four students sported their Weasley-knitted sweaters - Draco, strangely tolerant of the cold, carried his - as they waved goodbye to Molly and Apparated to King’s Cross, meeting Luna on the platform. They spent the journey in friendly conversation, but a tense atmosphere lingered in their compartment. With every out of place shake of the train, they flinched and watched the windows for anything amiss.
“I don’t think showering a three-year-old with sweets and kisses translates to an evacuation, treasure,” Draco said, deadpan. “But maybe you
Draco huffed exasperatedly, but he didn’t confront them. It would only support what everyone said behind his back; that he was a filthy supporter of Voldemort, who wished for the destruction of their harmonious society, and wasn’t fit to lick anyone’s boots. Even his fellow Slytherins kept an icy distance, not wanting to associate with the losing side any more than they already had the misfortune to.
Draco shuddered, thinking about their voice. It reminded him of his father’s, persuasive yet deadly. It was terribly ambiguous, with no accent to place, no gender to affix to it. Their only identifying feature was black eyes, which could have been any shade of blue, gray, green, or brown in the darkness of the cavern.
This was kind of a filler chapter, I'm not going to lie...But I kind of liked the simplicity and imagery bits of the scenes, it was relaxing to write.
“We need to be more careful,” He surmised once Harry had finished. “You think we can’t even talk without people jumping to conclusions?”
He took Harry’s hand, and Harry had a sudden sense of déjà vu as he watched Draco’s blond head move ahead of him, fingers laced gently but firmly as if beginning to curl around the Snitch. Yet how could it be déjà vu; he’d never been at Draco’s house with him, at least not like this, never like this. Draco’s walls had come tumbling down, and Harry could see every part of him. The child that collected rocks and bones and flowers in his mother’s garden, the jealous teen whose bruised knuckles betrayed the words he didn’t dare utter, the young man that had finally made room in his heart for another.
“You’re doing it tonight?” Harry’s heart had begun to beat faster as if Ron’s anxiousness had become his own.
Draco looked down at his forearm, where the black snake’s coils had been marred with red, raised lines, parts of them crusted with dried blood. He’d done it out of pure spite, with the same razor he used to shave. It was mania and anger that poured out of the cuts and dripped onto the tiles that he’d had to clean thoroughly, lest Teddy see. Self-harm, though only half of it was self-hatred. The other half was a lead-heavy fear of the thing on his arm, feeling as if it was beginning to wrap around his soul.
Harry, who knew the Weasleys well enough, was aware that they were not so easily swayed by material things. “Not with the vase,” Harry told him. “With your kindness.”
Without the security of a wand, Harry faltered, pushing back his parents’ voices with his clammy hands clenched over Draco’s shoulders - he, too, had begun to shiver, eyes unfocused, muttering under his breath. “Stop…stop it, don’t hurt her….”
"Now, if you would all please join us for the burial ceremony," The small wizard announced. Charlie, Arthur, Percy, and George waved their wands at the casket, which floated. Dozens of mourners rose to follow the procession to the graveyard.
The teenagers gathered in the kitchen to make their late breakfast, either settling for classic circles or branching out into more adventurous figurines. The rest of Christmas Day stretched before them like a warm, glorious promise. Harry recalled the Christmas before - he and Hermione camped out in the forest, alone, wondering if Ron would return, his wand broken, despair settling over them both faster than winter setting in…
Athena greeted her companions the second they walked in the door in a flurry of feathers, hooting so loudly that Harry was grateful for the Muffling charms they’d placed around their flat - the neighbors would have been curious otherwise.
Several things happened in quick succession. A black figure passed through the edge of Draco's vision, so swiftly he might've imagined it if he hadn't suspected they were being followed. The dust and smoke stilled as someone Apparated directly in front of them with a startling crack. All three on-edge Aurors immediately pointed their wands, and the stranger raised his hands as a sign of peace.
The energy in the expansive foyer had changed entirely from earlier. The witches and wizards sat huddled on the steps, whispering among themselves. Young eyes ranging from ebony to honey trailed the four adults as they headed for the front door.
The pair’s noses were nearly touching, and Harry was finding it difficult to think. He silently sifted through the information Malfoy had just given him, scrabbling for a label.
Harry’s name, despite Draco’s initial teasing about it being common, sounds lovely when Draco says it. Or perhaps
The dungeon door slammed behind Hermione and Ron, sending cold echoes throughout the common room. Amber coals had begun to die down in the brazier, making Harry shiver. He patted his pocket for his wand to relight it, then remembered he’d left it at the dorm.
Ron and Hermione came to a halt a few feet away, within speaking distance, though far enough to leave a deliberate gap. Ron’s brow was furrowed in anger, while a mixture of emotions danced across Hermione’s face - above all, she seemed distressed.
“Fucking unbelievable,” he growled, kicking his chair, and it teetered for a second before clattering to the ground. Joey flinched, but Harry’s anger seemed to be aimed more at Draco than anyone else. “A week and a half, and nothing. No owls, no hints, no ‘hey darling! I’m going to run away to some unfindable place where I could be in danger!’” Harry fell off into angry muttering, pacing the floor. His robes were beginning to smoke.
“I have something you want.” In a series of swift, graceful movements, Rabbit stood, freeing Harry, and slipped something from under their robes. Harry was expecting an amulet, but a small charm dangled from a silver chain: a tiny vial, filled with a silvery substance.
“Have ye been listening ta me, wain? It’s my real name for the purposes a this wee operation.” Charon suddenly launched into a heaving coughing fit, lifting his cloak to his face, and the three young wizards jumped in surprise. He took a moment to breathe, rather wheezily, then continued speaking. “Bad air down here. Nothing ye wains hafta worry about, ye got young lungs. Now shift it.”
” After twenty-nine recitations, Draco flicked his wand, and the door opened. The darkness of the foyer yawned vast and intimidating, and Draco hesitated, wand hand lowering, eyes widening in fear.
The hunger for answers burns even more than the heartache. Luna heads for the apartment first, but upon spotting the Lockhart van, stops dead. She’s reminded of the equipment Justin and Pansy had carried in only hours before - cold, impersonal technology that had torn her and hundreds of others apart.
“Not on an ordinary date, I mean,” Draco mused, watching Ron and Hermione as they moved farther and farther away. “I’m sure he’d wants to talk to her alone right now.” He started walking again, and Harry followed him.
Care of Magical creatures - Harry waxes poetic about Draco (what else is new) and how he doesn't like the subject. Draco's starring appearance in the chapter is just being a little shit (what else is new) in class.
Inside, Ron was laying on his back in his bed with his arms crossed behind his head. When he saw Harry, his eyes narrowed and he and turned his back to him to face the wall.
"He was…skeptical at first." And Draco huffed sarcastically. "But after I told him about the Gillyweed and the task, he believed me a bit more."
get his revenge on them. Like he talks about the war, but it's in future tense. I just never thought about it enough."
Draco held back a retort about the school’s shitty curfew rules, silently getting up (without bowing this time, thank Merlin) and walking up to the door once again.
"Technically, I won." Harry had his back turned to them, and his voice conveyed no emotion Draco could pick up on. "But I didn't want it. Neither did the Diggory's."
"That's right! Ten days! Now get your hollow skull out your fucking arse. I didn't take that fucking clip, so stop bothering me about it! This is why nobody in Slytherin wants to date you! I heard the Sorting Hat made one mistake in it's life and that was placing you here instead of in Hufflepuff." Blaise spat vemenously. "Now kindly don't speak to me again until you regain even a
"Draco?" Snape sounded slightly worried now. It must have been something on Draco's face, or the shaky hands gripping his Godfather's arms, or the way he was looking at Dumbledore as if the man might disappear before his eyes.
Taking another step, he found it was coming from one of the rooms. He took one step forwards before his brain registered the twinge of familiarity in the voice. His heart jumping, he immediately raced towards the sound and threw open the door. He stood in the doorway, chest heaving, before he was hit with the sound of loud shouting coming from a person stood inside the room.
When he felt he could, Draco slowly pulled away and pulled some tissues off the table, handing them to Harry who was rubbing his face.
He cleared his throat, readjusting himself on his seat. Pansy was to his side, talking to another one of the children by the window of the train. “Well, if you want to be in Slytherin, you will be, won’t you?”
Draco saw Ronald and Granger in the corner, just shy of looking like animals backed in to a corner. "We wanted to -"
Umbridge’s eyes narrowed for a moment. “Right. Miss...Granger. What might be the problem? I find that the aims are fairly straight-forward-”
"Draco." Harry said again, steadier this time. Draco looked at him finally. He looked angry at first. If Draco hadn't seen Harry angry before, he would've thought he was at that moment. His eyebrows were drawn together, and his eyes were boring in to him with a blazing determination that made Draco want to look away as if averting his eyes from the sun. This wasn't anger. It was something solid. Certainty, like a lifeline in a rough sea that Draco wanted to clutch on to.
"You like it too." Harry said, the moonlight making the darkness beneath his closed eyes a dull grey colour.
"Moody?" Draco asked, leaning forward. Harry didn't notice the sudden urgency in his tone, and his eyes were still covered by his arm to see Draco's frown.
They both turned to Lancaster in the bidding of an answer. Draco almost wanted to be told he was completely wrong for once. He knew the Ministry was bad, but only thought it had been like that for the past decade or so - only ever since the first war happened. This was...systemic. It was an archaic bloody system they were talking about…
He knew this feeling. It was similar to that moment in the first task of the tournament, when he'd summoned his broom. He'd held his wand up to the sky, and screamed,"
“Ah,” Lancaster’s eyes lit up in recognition, looking slightly relieved, “Your father mentioned that, has he?” The man deflated slightly, which Draco accredited to the slight discomfort he may have felt at the resistance to the Veritaserum. “Well,” he leant forward on his seat, making Draco and Blaise do the same, “This is all off the record of course, but when I came into this position half a year ago, while having been briefed on the general contents of Level Two and One, I’ve never actually been down there.”
Of course, the wounds on the back of his hand stopped healing early into the evening and there was a steady flow of it as the words only got cut deeper. Blots of blood stained the parchment and blurred over the lines he wrote. At one point, he was sure he felt Umbridge’s satisfied gaze staring at the scattered crimson drops.
“Just leave me alone,” Harry said as calmly as he could, laying down facing away from Draco in hopes that it might calm him down and stop him from possibly lashing out at the boy.
. Hermione, helpful as always, said nothing and picked up the jar she had been eyeing and walked away. So much for
"It's Harry." Hermione said with a pointed look to Ron. Harry's scoff was lost between his two friends having a silent argument as if he weren't there.
Draco crossed his arms defensively, face going nearly unbearably hot. "I…didn't want it to bite me!"
"Then things just got extremely more complicated." Sirius said gravely, resting his forearms on his knees.
“Thank you.” Draco sighed behind him as if finally getting something off his chest. The reality of how much pressure Draco was under hit Harry again, and he felt a strange sense of satisfaction at having not said anything about his scar, just because it lessened the burdens on Draco’s shoulders.
"Yeah, why?" Harry frowned, not knowing what was so funny. Draco just shook his head, laughing quietly to himself.
Draco nodded grimly, "It's a magically binding contract, and if either one breaks it, will result in their death. So, unless I'm stupid enough to kill myself with the slip of a tongue, I'll never be able to say anything without a consequence. The weight of that alone will help me not give in to the temptation of telling anyone. It's the best we can do to keep each other safe. I will vow my loyalty to you, and any betrayal will kill me. Will that work for you?"
"Why the fuck would you do that?" Harry shrieked, feeling his lack of hair once again since the Yule Ball.
Harry immediately felt a strange sensation from where his and Draco's hands met. Tightening his grip curiously, he felt the faint thrum of magic beneath Draco's skin as if he were holding his wand. It was unfamiliar, and felt slightly like that time when he held Draco's Hawthorn wand by the lake.
Severus was silent for a long time, but Draco knew it was best just to wait it out. After thirty silent seconds of the crackling coals for company, Draco heard a long, drawn out sigh and almost let out a whoop of joy.
"Nothing else? Nothing suspicious?" Draco pressed on. He tapped his index finger impatiently. There was something more, something he was missing. He could tell he knew it but couldn't seem to recall.
No. He had seen it. By Merlin, his wand moved. It had even rolled a bit from it's place. He could tell because it's top side didn't have a layer of dust on it anymore.
Unable to stop himself, he glanced back to the Phoenix, which inexplicably looked more developed. It was looking at Draco for some reason, chirping happily. He couldn’t stop the small smile forming on his own face at the sight, which he found he couldn’t maintain for very long before it fell.
Harry grunted in acknowledgement and prayed to any possible God that Malfoy kept his damn mouth shut. Just for a few minutes. Just for once.
"I'm surprised, Potter." He said as he came back from the spin, "You haven't fallen on your arse yet." He didn't even look like he had broken a sweat, save for a few strands of hair falling over his forehead from being gelled back.
“He thinks I’m crazy, and so does his Mum!” Harry yelled back, eyes wet. “Just what the stinking Prophet says, and everyone else thinks the same thing! Everyone!”
“You two need to get a life.” Pansy sighed. “And by the way, Draco, has Umbridge been acting weird?”
.” Pansy intoned in a cold, menacing tone. Draco spotted a child in the back shiver slightly when she spoke, which sent a surge of satisfaction through him . “Don’t forget it, or you might become very comfortable with the corridor floors at night.”
“Hey, is Slytherin scheduled for the pitch today?” Harry asked suddenly, breaking the spell of quiet.
", and felt the buzz that it'd worked all throughout his arm. He remembered the adrenalin rush in his veins from seeing the Hungarian Horntail so close, and the way his mind narrowed in to the spell so acutely because he absolutely
Right, he didn’t need all that. He skipped some more paragraphs until a certain few words caught his eye.
“Hey.” Dean’s voice said behind him, and Seamus said nothing, seemingly absorbed in his posters. “All good?”
After assuring Blaise that no, he wasn't going to storm the Ministry and no, he still wouldn’t tell him what he was planning, Draco rushed back to the Library. He went straight for the section filed under
"Here and there. You know how it is for him." Sirius's tone became a bit grave, but he chirped up after a moment. "Haven't seen him since the night I escaped on Buckbeak!"
hex or seriously maim Draco. By the Lake they talked, the whole conversation being a blur to Draco except the few parts Potter had spoken about muggles and…muggleborns? Yes, they argued about that for a bit. Then Draco's father came up and…his stomach churned as he remembered Potter's words about his Father, of what he did in second year. Draco truly had no idea what had happened. As far as thing like that went, his father kept him the dark.
"Enjoying the outside." Harry said with a sigh, then added curtly, "And also avoiding everyone inside."
that's enough venting I think. I've been sitting on this shit for 2 weeks, though. cut me some slack.
Draco hesitated, coming to stand at his chair and sitting in it when his father waved a hand in permission to do so. "Well…" He wracked his brain in trying to remember what he did before he said it. He mostly blanked out whenever he was in a duel. "You've been hitting me with that spell for days now, so I knew it's motion before you even cast it. And I know some Latin, so I knew it translated to something like '
"Erm, no. Not exactly." Harry brought his palms up to look at them, wondering why Draco did it all the time and what it was he saw in them. "To a large extent, he really is Malfoy. He's mean, sadistic and for a while had the most awful prejudices about blood purity. That was all him. For a while, I also really did hate him. I hated how he thought he was better than everyone. That he hated them because of who they were without any sort of solid basis. I hated him with all my being so much that I thought he was the Heir of Slytherin and even capable of killing."
Then he realised that they were silent sobs wracking through his body, that were automatically restrained as much as possible and pulled in to his chest. He didn't make any sound. Anybody passing by would have thought he was laughing like a lunatic, not crying like he was a little boy in his cupboard again.
, Blaise, that I am the embodiment of Slytherin. Some may have even mistaken me for the Heir of Slytherin himself!" Draco said proudly, crossing his arms defiantly.
"He'll be fine. Just some well-needed rest for his nerves to repair themselves." Madam Pomfrey assured him when he asked. He was meant to be asleep too, Sirius guarding him from outside in his Animagus form, but he couldn't let go of the tension from the past few hours.
"I think they'll say it's a very nice haircut you got, Harry. ' Oh, Harry, how on earth did you do it?' They would say, ' Why didn't you take
He bent over the sink and his stomach heaved. He vomited and his body convulsed as if trying to rid itself of sickness. As if trying to purge his own body of the disgust it felt at the image of his own face, riddled with those sanguineous eyes and resembling something that haunted him while both sleeping and awake.
“Oi, that’s my best friend you’re talking about.” Ron interrupted him righteously. Harry paused for a moment, before finally understanding what the other boy had said. “I won’t stand for it, Harry.” Ron continued, elbowing him a little so even Harry managed to smile slightly. “See? You think he’s great too.”
A pathetic voice in his head cheered on. He promptly ignored it and vowed to do so as long as it existed. Was this sleep deprivation? He really should go to sleep on time for once.
." He heard her cry in to his shoulder. It confused him at first, before he realised she probably wasn't just talking about what had happened moments prior.
"He left in a hurry from our meeting - erm, his tardiness may also be my fault, by the way." Draco said apologetically.
"He was in a pout since you left." Hermione appeared on Harry's other side. "Pretty sure he almost made Snape hex him in the meeting earlier."
"Th…Thanks, I guess." Ron said, looking down at the badge with wide eyes. "Thought for sure Harry would get it, though."
"I mean where were you at breakfast? Ron said he also didn't see you in your bed this morning. Harry if there's anything you need you can talk to us-" Anxiety spiked in Harry immediately. He hadn't realised how much energy he'd spent trying to avoid the topic at all.
situation these past few years. I simply repeated the remarks my father would say, but I know that they're wrong now and I'd just like to apologise for myself." He said the words before he could think about them, but felt an immense amount of relief after (even if he did feel like throwing up as well).
Draco laughed, eyes bright as if taken off guard, “Been reading, have we? What was that, word of the day?”
If Draco didn't know better, he'd think his mother's tone was less instructive and more warning. He would have thought it was just his imagination if he couldn't see the intense worry in her eyes that no one but him might have been able to pick up.
A moment later, he felt a blanket of warmth encompass him, and he hadn't realised that he'd felt so cold until he was surrounded by it. He realised that Malfoy had his wand out and had probably cast a warming charm on him. He looked at the boy gratefully, vision still blurry despite his glasses sitting crookedly on his nose.
the Gryffindor right in front of Blaise. Watching the water go down the drain, Draco finally recalled what happened after he and Potter's truce.
Umbridge EATS that shit up and Harry, in a final effort to make it believable, uses wandless magic to momentarily change his eye colour to red. Umbridge watches in catatonic shock and he cancels the spell, acting as if nothing had happened, and leaves the room.
Holy shit he was in Harry Potters house, living with him for Merlin knows how long. Then it dawned on him that he'd eventually have to come to figure out his own living arrangements. That thought pushed him over the edge and he drifted off into a peaceful sleep.
Harry’s throat suddenly became too tight to breathe. He loosened his tie then immediately the distinct feeling of prickling started behind his eyes. He blinked back the tears that threatened to fall, still trying to get air into his lungs. As soon as Ron and Hermione noticed, worry etched into their features. As they sat him down in a nearby chair, trying to calm him down, he stood abruptly and started pacing around the vast expanse of the room. He managed to remove his tie - why was it so tight?! - but he still had trouble getting air to his oxygen deprived lungs. Hermione and Ron’s pleading voices for him to calm down drowned out in the rush of blood he heard in his ears.
“Looking for another player?” The man eventually asked, a deep accent coming from him. American? Draco wondered. Regardless, there was only one person he would’ve wanted to add to his game, and it wasn’t this man.
Harry surged forwards and grabbed Draco, wrapping his whole, massive body around the blond’s smaller one. He glared at everyone around them before looking down at Draco.
Harry didn’t have a plan, just that he was going to confront the blond about what happened with the cursed necklace. When he approached the bathroom and finally got a clear view of Malfoy, he watched him for a moment; he was nothing but a scared kid, unaware of what was to become of him with the dangers of war looming over them.
“Oh hey, just some pancakes.” Harry replied, glancing quickly over his shoulder before returning to the breakfast.
He just needed a quick cold shower to cool himself off. He felt fine, aside from his burning skin. He didn't think anything of it, probably just his boyfriend’s skin’s oven-like tendencies to overheat his small body. Especially when they cuddled too close together. Plus it was June and they still had their big winter comforter on their bed.
“He’s got a private room to himself. McGonagall thought it wise that we live alone, to not ‘disturb other students.’” He read from the parchment.
Dumbledore had led Harry to his pensive and removed the memory of the bizarre interaction between him and prophecy-telling Trelawney. Dumbledore had watched it through first, and when he surfaced, he didn’t have the usual knowing glint in his eyes. He beckoned Malfoy forward.
Harry sighed. He felt really bad for him. He released the incarcerous and immediately Malfoy’s arms were thrown around his neck. He was not expecting to get a lap of Malfoy right before his shower, especially when he was naked under his robe.
“Mr Malfoy, I need to ask you some questions, please,” Madame Pomfrey begged. Once Malfoy was paying attention to her, Harry tried slipping out and returning to the common room where he could forget all of this, but Hermione’s other hand wrapped around his other arm.
“No?” Harry said. Draco nodded. Harry licked his cheek. Draco screamed. Harry laughed. “Take it back.” He repeated.” Draco scowled and shook his head, trying his best to fight his smile. “I’ll lick you again.” Harry threatened. Draco scowled harder. Just as Harry leaned down, Draco reached up and kissed him soundly. Harry released his hands from the shock and Draco wrapped them around his neck. Draco quickly sat up, on top of Harry’s inviting lap.
Draco woke up burning again, and this time with a headache. Except now, he only had the sheet covering him, and Harry off to his side of the bed.
Draco did sob, then. He cried and cried as he wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck and held him for a long time. They cried on each others shoulders, and held each other for all that it was worth.
“Well, um, cause I thought that every time you said that, it wasn’t you actually saying or feeling those things. It was the prophecy.”
“If you do anything to anger the prophecy, even a long time from now, it may act up again. Say you have to travel away from each other, even if it’s for work or something, and you aren’t intending on leaving each other permanently, the prophecy won’t know the difference and it will cause pain, possibly to both of you, regardless of your feelings for each other. If you have an argument, even a long time from now, you will feel pain. It’s a horrible thing to have to deal with, one should be able to live freely, but alas, that is the fate of being bound to a prophecy.”
Harry needed to talk to Hermione. She'd know what to do about his recent development of feelings for a certain blond Omega. She knew he was an unmated Alpha, not only with overly protective traits, but also sensitive magic. He was just a mess.
“Well, because that’s what I thought, after what you said last night. About not choosing to marry me, or whatever. I wasn’t aware you weren’t serious until you came in.”
Another blow to his chest. Draco revisited the memory of his and Harry’s wedding day. Not a very good one, if you asked him. “I see.” he said. He began backing out of the room, trying to give Harry space, again, lest he get hurt even more.
He stopped when a hand grabbed his wrist and he heard a mumble similar to “Stay.” He turned back to see Harry who just looked up at him with wide eyes.
“Right. I assume you have no idea what you’re doing, then?” Jonathan asked. Draco did nothing. “Well this is where you’re going to spend all your time.” He said, turning back to the main area “That’s Ethan, Mason, Philip and Danny or Danielle, but she prefers Danny.” Jonathan said as he pointed to everyone in unison with their name, which they all gave nods or a little wave to him. “Everyone here calls me John or Johnny. Applies to you too, seeing as your our new recruit.” Jonathan went and stood at an empty section of table beside the woman, Danielle. “This is your spot. This is where you will sort the mail, produce any necessary incantations or cursebreaking spells on the mail, and then send them off to the correct department, office or section of the Ministry." He then went and stood in the place he was in when Draco first walked in. “We all stick to our spots. When you're given a spot, you stick to it. You will sort the required amount of mail a day. If you have any questions or concerns, don’t, cause no one here gives a shit. We aren’t paid enough. Get started, you have quite the pile.” And he went back to sorting at that.
“Yeah, I’ll go.” He got up right away to go see what the franticness coming from his best mate was all about.
After a few of the customers were either processing or paying, a particularly muscled, tan-skinned, dark haired, lighting-bolt scarred Auror walked in.
There was a pause of silence and Harry just looked at Draco with so much affection, Draco blushed. “So...?” He asked, avoiding Harry's gaze.
“Shh, shh, baby, I’ve got you.” Harry said, leaning down to wrap his arms around Draco, kissing his neck and shoulders as the smaller man shook within them.
“Thank you so much for that assessment Ronald, I so needed your input on this situation.” Harry replied sarcastically.
“You betcha.” He said, then pushed Draco up the bed so he could kneel in front of him. He wrapped a hand around Draco’s cock, bending slightly to lick and suck at his head. He kept his ministrations light, but after a hand crept it’s way into his hair, he took the whole thing in his mouth. Draco wasn’t particularly that big, about average size, and with Harry’s lack of a gag reflex, he was able to swallow the whole thing.
“Just- take a second. Breathe.” Harry breathed a breathy laugh, mainly because of so much kissing, his lungs haven’t quite regained their strength. “Are you sure you want to…” At the look Draco sent his way, Harry quickly continued. “I mean, I do, but I just want to make sure you’re ready.” He placed a hand gently against Draco’s cheek, the returning pressure against it almost immediate.
Draco sighed. “Ok, cause, I know I can be very forward sometimes, but I only want to do things we both agree on. And you’ve been very clear about this whole situation, and I truly respect your opinions.”
And with that, something in Draco cracked. He had been so nice to Harry this entire time, doing everything possible to make him feel comfortable. He was new to this too. He was going through the same problems as Harry was. If they hadn’t gotten married, they would’ve both died. They knew this. But Harry was insistent on being a little shit to Draco, like he blamed Draco for this. Yeah, the first few years they knew each other, they weren’t civil in any sense, but that was when they were younger. Draco had since apologized to Harry for being so nasty towards him, and they had a few good times over the last year or two.
Since the incident, when he found out Malfoy had feelings for him, it felt… good. He liked being liked, he enjoyed having someone want him. He had never had that before. Even if it was a boy, even if it was Malfoy.
Draco stood and gathered his empty plate and coffee mug and put them to wash in the sink. Harry stared at him with incredulous look.
Harry pulled back the other way, wanting to get far away from Draco’s nakedness, lest his nakedness make Harry’s naked body react.
“What? Oh, sorry, no. I ask all my customers that. I was just being polite.” Draco said defensively.
“And you can’t Accio it because…?” he teased, untying the letter from the owl, petting it lightly, then watching it fly back out the window.
Harry’s back started complaining with the position he’d been in for a while. He vaguely remembered he had a bed, and decided that would be the more ideal place to finish this. Before he’d even pulled away from Draco lips, he scooped him up and carried him, thin legs wrapped tightly around his waist, all the way up to their bedroom.
“Honestly Potter, you need to stand up to those children once in a while or they will think they can walk all over you.” Draco said, picking up his beer and taking a long sip. He’d decided to go out with Potter again after he’d apologized earlier that week, and so far, there have been no invasive kisses or inappropriate groping. They revisited the pool hall across from Draco’s salon, as it was the easiest place for both of them to meet up at.
He stood at the end of the aisle, hair combed and hanging loose around his face, dressed in an immaculately designed suit, similar to Harry’s, talking to a woman Harry recognized as his mother.
Draco had been polite at the wedding and showed the same attitude now, so they assumed he had everything under control.
“Yes, we’re doing very well Kingsley. Thanks for asking. Are we all set to start, then?” Harry asked.
Not only did she call him ‘Draco’, but she also said she was worried about him and asked him quite nicely to talk. His eyes narrowed and he asked “Why? What are you planning?”
Boyfriend. It was still so new. He’d never had a boyfriend before. He wasn’t even really gay, not that he had anything against it, he just never really considered it. The only reason he had one now, was because he was actually his mate. That was new too, but he was ok with that. More than ok, actually, cause he really liked this Harry. The one he never really got the chance to know back at Hogwarts.
He shook the boy as he called him “Harry? Harry, wake up.” He sounded very congested and cursed his weak immune system.
Harry felt much, much better he got that off his chest, but now very, very hungry. The corner of his lip pulled slightly as he said “Starving.”
The medi-witch nodded. “Ah, yes. Marigold Pearings.” she introduced herself, extending a hand towards Draco.
"Location can play a part, yes. The place you received the prophecy, or even bonded, will have a higher control rate than, lets say, a place you once visited during a vacation." Walkins assured.
Harry jerked awake. The bed next to him was empty but still warm, and the shower was running in the conjoined bathroom. He stretched out, much like a cat would, and padded off to the bathroom.
“Baby, please.” Draco said as he slowly pulled out a few inches, trying to release some of the pressure.
A grunt and then the blonds head finally appeared over the blankets. “I normally am, but not when someone’s screaming rings in my ears all night!”
Calling it a room was an understatement. It was more like a suite. Malfoy had everything he needed, all to himself.
Draco shrugged and dropped his gaze to the floor. He was quick to start pulling the sweater over his pale hands in a nervous manner. "Ok, I guess." He said quietly.
“I’m glad you like it! I’ve been told I make some great pancakes.” Harry said, filling his own plate. All he got was a grunt in response, as Draco’s mouth was so full of pancakes.
“Ready for another?” He asked, before sitting up and with a renewed energy, started pounding away into Draco.
He pulled them off the shelves and put them beside his poetry books. He knew that his main purpose was to mate with an Alpha to pass on the genes, but none have presented themselves to him.
Harry groaned around the cock in his mouth and sucked harder. A few seconds later, and the hand in his hair tightened as Draco’s seed exploded in his mouth. A moment later and he came on his hand, too. He swallowed his husband’s seed savouringly. He stood up and leaned over the blond to kiss him passionately.
“Oh, dear Merlin!” Draco screamed. “What did you do!” He grabbed his dick in an attempt to stave off his orgasm.
Draco was very hesitant, but he knew that if Harry trusted her, he could too. He really wanted to barge into Harry’s study and confront him for telling her and Weasley, but he knew that Harry would just get riled up and make him talk to her anyways. He decided to just avoid all of that.
“Oh, cause you hate being cooped up inside this house with me all day, right? Because Merlin forbid you spend anytime with me-”
“Gin. Oh you don’t know how happy I am to see you.” He hugged her immediately, trying to pull some comfort out of the touch. They had officially broken up after they graduated, with Harry having to bond to Draco Malfoy and Ginny realizing she liked Luna much more than ‘just friends’. Now, Ginny and Luna were attending Harry’s worst nightmare together, and Harry was secretly still panicking.
“Ok, ok. Don’t worry. Everything will be ok. Do you need some water? Are you going to be sick again?”
Draco was worried. He was upset at the fact that Harry was probably lying to him, and he was anxious about how Harry felt towards him.
Snape came through the doors moments later, courtesy of McGonagall's patronus to him, alerting him that Malfoy had woken up.
That was the first time Harry had heard him speak during the whole trial, and to say it shocked the pants off him was an understatement. His jaw dropped and his eyes widened. Draco peered over at him with a raised eyebrow but said nothing.
They ate in silence for a while before Draco spoke quietly "I couldn't help but notice you call me by my first name."
I literally cried while writing this-could be because I'm hormonal rn but also because Drarry is my OTP especially this soft, loving Drarry. I love this trope. I love this fic. I love this update. I hope you enjoyed it too.
“I want to see how long you can stay quiet, love.” Draco says. Harry looks at him, regards him for a moment, then nods.
“What’s w-wrong with me?” Harry cried. “Why did this h-h-happen to me? Why do all bad things-s happen t-to me?” He hiccuped as he furiously wiped tears from his eyes and cheeks.
Draco smiled. Impressive, Harry actually could form a not-so awkward sentence around Draco without looking painfully uncomfortable.
Harry looked dumbfounded and draco thought about it for a moment. “That does make sense…” He said slowly.
Draco felt all the blood in his body race to his face. “Yeah, well, I’ve made a profession out of it, I better be good at it.”
“Wha- you’ve never had pancakes?” Draco just shook his head. “Well, you are today. Sit, they’re done.”
When Harry peeked out of his study to find the bathroom empty, he made his way over to clean up. He quickly gave up the task of trying to scrub the wretched brownie batter out of his clothes, so he shucked them off and decided to shower again instead. All his unhelpful mind kept supplying was the feel of pressure against his lips and the taste of uncooked brownie on his tongue.
Feeling a pang in his heart, he bit his lip and nodded. “Ok.” He went to sit on the edge of the bed again but Harry quickly shuffled over, making room for him to lie down next to him. Draco just looked at the spot, then to Harry, then back again. “I don’t know..” he whispered. "Are you sure?” Harry just looked at him expectantly. He sighed and lay down beside him. “Don’t expect me to do this every night. I like my own bed to sleep in.”
He worked from 8 to 6, 6 days a week. Although his shop was always full with customers, hired employees, and sometimes volunteers, Draco felt alone.
Harry hummed. “And what about your neck?” He asked as he moved his lips to the small section showing above Draco’s collar.
They lay there silently, except for their heavy breathing, their orgasmshave been ripped so hard from them.
The water shut off then, signalling Draco had finished. Harry closed the door and sat back on the bed to give him some privacy. It wasn’t really needed though.
Hermione gave him a stern look before saying "Oh, and flipping out on the Wizengamont Council and getting yourself thrown out of court is 'being careful so far'?" She asked with her hands on her hips.
Draco loved his job more than anything. He loved his clients, he loved that he could run the business how he wanted, he loved making people happy. He loved expressing himself through his work, while also helping those that were too shy to do it on their own. He gave people confidence, which was the most fulfilling part of his work.
Harry laughed before leaning in and placing a chaste kiss on the blond’s soft lips. It was different from when Draco had kissed him, small and quick, but he loved it all the same.
The halls of 12 Grimmauld Place were usually silent, faint whispers coming from the few portraits that littered the dusty walls every now and then.
As he kissed and licked Draco’s neck and collarbones, he started creeping down his body, moving to his chest and stomach. Once he reached Draco’s wispy blond happy trail, he stopped to look up at the blond, searching for a sign for him to continue. All he saw was lust soaked eyes and red puffy lips. He groaned in appreciation.
“Are you going to touch me, Harry?” Draco asked, gently brushing a strand of hair out of Harry's eyes.
Just as Malfoy’s hands started creeping up higher, he was lifted up off the ground and away from Harry. Harry looked up to see Ron holding a perturbed Draco Malfoy.
Harry Summoned a buck from the shed in the backyard. He handed it to Ron just as his nausea overtook him. It reminded Harry of their second year and the incident with the slugs. Man, Draco was a little prick.
Draco thought for a moment then replied with "Not since I was young, three, maybe? I don't remember much, if anything at all. Just that it's dark and damp, oh, and that horrid house-elf."
Hermione nodded in agreement. She and Ron tried telling him other things that might’ve changed Harry’s mind.
Harry sighed and rubbed his temples. He’d been dreading this day for weeks; ever since he’d heard what he’d have to do. He’d considered running away, hiding from everybody and everything, somewhere no one would find him. But of course, he couldn’t do that. Not to all those that had helped him: the Weasleys, who made him apart of their family, Hermione who constantly helped him in school and was always such a big supporter of his, and all those parental figures that took on such big roles in his life, ones that were never quite filled by those he needed most.
Draco has already said his farewells. The limo was also packed. He had nothing left to do to distract himself from the painful look Harry was so vividly expressing to everyone. He couldn’t help but feel like this was all his fault, like he forced Harry into this. But he didn’t. He was in the same boat as Harry, but Harry was treating him like the shark-surrounded waters, ready to attack at the slightest movement.
When he finally returned home, Draco stood in the entryway, arms crossed, foot tapping and a look of disapproval upon his face.
“Dray?” Harry prompted, mind wine-muffled and slightly aroused by the proximity and smell of his husband so close to him.
Draco felt his eyes burn and saw his vision cloud up before he threw his head into the pillow, and sobbed, wondering when he became such a sensitive sap.
Draco took a seat and waited for Harry to bring the… weird brown...circular ‘pancake’ things? “Those are them?” he asked, pointing to the plate on which they sat.
“Well…” Draco paused for a second before a huge grin broke out on his lips “It’s wonderful! How is it so soft? And the syrup? Wow! Just, wow.” He started cutting himself another piece as Harry broke out into a laugh.
“That night, I had met up with a few work friends when they had finished their shift. That’s why I was a little late meeting you. We had a few drinks and talked a bit before I said I had to go. I didn’t want to say I was going on a date, but they had strung it out of me. I refused to say who it was with though, knowing they’d take the shit on me. It’s just who they are. Since I wouldn’t say who I was going out with, Seamus, you remember him from school, he’d cast a revelio-type charm that enhances one’s feelings. It’s a stupid prank that we used to pull on each other in school. Someone had found it in the restricted section at Hogwarts once, I don't know how.
Then Draco turned from on to crushed (and a little embarrassed), because he knew Harry would never want him like that. As he watched his husband dive beneath the waves, he knew Harry would never want to be with him.
“Be that as it may, he cannot stay in the hospital wing forever. You are more knowledgeable about wizard care than any other student that may be willing to care for him, and seeing as it is a punishment for you, to make sure you won’t do it again, I think you should be on your way.” McGonagall said sternly. She was not in the mood to negotiate.
He kept true to his word, staying put beside Ron. Because Harry was sitting in front of him, though, he had no problems making lewd gestures and sending him seductive looks.
Harry looked conflicted for a moment before saying “I don't think hot tea is good for you right now. But I can cool it down for you first.” Draco smiled sweetly and nodded. “And I can make you some of Molly’s famous chicken noodle soup. I know you like that.” Draco nodded again, more vigorously this time. “Ok love, you stay here. I'll be right back.” He kissed his head again before exiting the bedroom and making his way to the kitchen.
“Socialization?” Draco spat. “You call shared work spaces and forced communication with daft employees ‘socialization’? I ought to wring your neck, you have no idea! Malfoys don’t interact with such vermin of the employed ‘middle class.’”
“There, there he is, Mr Malfoy. Here he comes.” Madame Pomfrey tried to calm the blond, but he wasn’t having it.
He heard the padding of feet and honestly expected the bed to dip a little bit on the opposite side of him, but it didn’t. Harry went to sleep on the couch.
“Potter, you’re helpless. Looks like Finnegan needs a reminder on consensual spell casting in regards to colleagues and acquaintances.”
He ran his tongue over his lip, still able to feel Malfoy’s softness there. He enjoyed the kiss, and he would’ve enjoyed it more if it wasn’t coming from Malfoy.
He never really got over the bloke, but he did pursue his passion, which was undoubtedly hair styling, which he’d practiced throughout school on his fellow students, mainly in his eighth year when he had the freedom to do so.
"That's a very good thing! I mean, I like this you a lot better than before." Draco just stared back at Harry, so he continued onto what he really wanted to say. "There's just, um, one more thing I'd like to ask."
I'm thinking one or two more chapters? Comment any good ideas you might have for this fic, I could use the help! Thank you guys so much for reading, I hope you enjoyed it :)
“What do you mean by cursebreaking? Don’t they have cursebreakers for that?” Draco asked, not giving two shits about not asking questions.
And with that, he shooed them out of his office. Draco just stared wide-eyed at the floor, before quickly glancing up at Harry; he then silently walking down the corridor, leaving Harry alone.
“Well, Ron, when a man and a man love each other-” Ron interrupted Harry though, throwing a pillow at him.
“So,” Harry began, picking up a quill to fiddle with. “Are you an Omega?” Harry knew the answer, he just wanted to hear Draco confirm it.
“Ah, Mr Potter. What can I do for you?” Kingsley asked as he saw Harry sitting in his office, waiting for him.
He trails kisses as he lowers himself down Harry’s body. When he gets to Harry’s cock, he grasps it firmly and places little kitten lick all over it. Truth be told he’d never sucked off another bloke, let alone shagged one. He does his best to remember how Harry did it the first time, and before long, he’s having his hair pulled at and warnings of Harry’s orgasm being whispered above him. He reluctantly pulled off of the throbbing gem and licked it a few times before he announced:
Harry grabbed the spatula and rubbed a large glob over Draco’s cheek and neck. Draco scooped a large amount and spread it all over Harry’s face. They both stopped, laughing uncontrollably.
“Thank you.” Harry said. They took their seats beside each other, surrounded by maybe ten other seats. “What has gotten into you.” Harry asked, shifting to look directly at Draco.
Harry looked up to see the blond staring down into his plate, clearly avoiding eye contact. “Well, yes, but that's not all.”
“Why not?” Draco retorted. “I like doing hair and making people feel good about themselves; Merlin knows I screwed up enough shite in my life, it was about time I turned things around.”
Draco breathed in deeply, trying to think of how to ask. “Well, I was thinking, wondering more like, because well, I don’t know, I don’t even know if you know, but, well-” Draco rambled before he was interrupted by a chuckle from Harry.
“I understand, Harry, and I will do everything I can to help you and Mr Malfoy. I will speak to the Prophet’s editors and tell them to shut it down.” Kingsley wrote something down on a piece of parchment before returning back to Harry. “Is there anything else I can do for you?”
Draco hugged him tightly before retreating back into his library. Harry quickly sent Ron a reply, then  went to their room to change before flooing to the three broomsticks in Hogsmeade. He hated aparating.
“So,” Dumbledore began, “it seems that the prophecy is exact. I will consult with Professor Trelawney and see what her expertise is on the matter. She will, of course, watch back the memory, and once we’ve consulted, we will meet again boys. Now, off to your classes.”
No, Harry would never do that, he thought. Harry did love him, as proven time and time again. He just wanted to sort some feelings out, and Draco had to respect that. He had to respect his Alpha’s decisions, he thought. After all, Harry did have both his and Draco’s best intentions in mind.
Draco bucked up immediately, but was held fast by Harry’s hands on his hips. As Harry licked and sucked Draco through the best blowjob he's ever had, Harry fisted his own cock in his underwear to relive some of the ache that accompanied their explicit activities.
Draco blushed. “We were, well…” She nods her head, knowingly. “But we stopped to talk for a minute.”
Draco was grossed out by the man’s behaviour, sure, but he didn’t think he should die because of it, let alone from Harry who was bound to make it a miserable death, seeing how hard he was squeezing.
“Ok, but you could have fucked me over a grand, intrinsically engraved desk before you’ve even worked a day behind it, leaving you with the memory of stretching me open and fucking me deep and hard every time you sat behind it until the day you retired? Wow, missed out there, Potter.” Draco said, starting down the hall again and pulling Harry forward. An arm snaked around his waist and pulled him close to a hard chest.
“Ok, Mr Dictionary. Tell me something fun about you! Tell me something no one else knows about you. Like your deepest darkest secrets.” Harry’s eyes shine brightly.
In his slightly intoxicated state, Draco did his best to divest the two of them of their clothes. He licked and sucked, petted and rubbed every inch of Harry’s perfect body.
“Ok...ok Harry…I have to go…” Finally he pulls away, pressing a hand to Harry’s chest. “I’ll see you soon.”
The corals, fish and oceanbeds created an atmosphere Draco had never experienced. It was so full of life and colour, he felt as though he wanted to become a fish just to join this world he was missing.
The Omega winced and extracted himself from the Alpha’s embrace, wrapping his own arms around himself. “Are you ready? We’ve gone over some possible question they might ask, so you should be good for those. You know they’re going to start off with basics: job opportunities, ministry functions, current projects, etcetera, etcetera-”
“Oh come on, Harry. We’ll have to do it sooner or later. It’s just sleep.” Draco said, starting to get under the covers.
Draco regarded him for a moment and twiddled his fingers in front of himself, posing in a very seductive way. And if he bit his lip too, that was his own business.
“I know, babe. But from what you’re saying, about him taking down that guy, and the way he was acting on your first date? Oh honey, you have absolutely nothing to worry about.”
“Ok, but why did you kiss me, and why did you call me ’Dray’? You’ve never even called me by my first name, now you’re onto pet names?”
“Dr-Draco.” Harry murmured, his breath coming so quickly he felt light headed. He was about to get molested in front of his whole house by his rival. He did not think this was going to happen when he woke up this morning.
“I promised her I wouldn’t. It’s not my news to tell.” Draco finished, his nose upturned, such Malfoian grace coming from that gesture alone.
He sighed and made his way to sit on the armchair across from the couch. She turned to face him. “Ok, fine. I’ll talk, but just so we don’t upset Harry. I can’t take that right now.”
Draco covered his face with both hands, trying hard not to sob. Harry pulled his hands away and gazed up so fondly at him.
Ron sighed then thought for a moment. Harry nodded towards his girlfriend with a questioning look, who was currently chewing the end of her quill into pieces. Ron saw what he was looking at and said “She hates Trelawney. More specifically divination. How ‘bout we go to Dumbledore tonight instead?” Ron had started listing the ingredients for a Pepper Up potion, so Harry decided to leave him to it.
“Stupid comforter.” Draco mumbled. He leaned over, grabbed a tissue and blew his nose well before turning back to Harry. He leaned in to kiss him when he was stopped with Harry's finger on his lips.
Draco wanted a full minute while Harry adjusted to him, before slowly adding another inch. Harry again had to stop and adjust.
“Welcome back, Mr Malfoy. How are you feeling?” Madame Pomfrey immediately started fussing over Malfoy.
“It’s looking pretty long, unless you like it that way. Personally, the shorter styles suit you better.” Draco said, running his hands through Potters hair, getting a feel for it to see what type of hair he’d be working with. He’d never say his personal opinion to his clients unless they specifically asked for it, but this was Potter, and Draco felt a certain strong confidence when around him.
Draco had barely sat up when Harry was already stumbling out of bed and into the bathroom. The door shut behind him and the lock clicked proudly.
No one would have suspected a thing, Draco being discreet about his personal life with those around him. At least, if Harry didn’t have his arm tucked obnoxiously (though lovingly) around his waist, and the other resting on Draco’s other arm or hand when it wasn’t holding his glass.
Harry took the bags to the cab as Draco did one last sweep of their little resort. All seemed in order. He then looked around fondly and took in the place where they created some of their first memories, which he was sure to miss. A pair of arms snaked around his middle as a head rested on his shoulder.
“His core.” He hears Hermione gasp behind him. “A replica of it.” She amends. “The light blue strands should be thick and glowing. As you can see, they’re quite faint. He’s on magic replenishing supplement, as well as the necessary physical potions he needs to help with the onslaught of the seizure. Mentally and physically, he is stable. Magically, he needs time to recover, but he should also bounce back with that too. He is quite powerful, there is no doubt in that, and with anyone else, the results of this would’ve been far more detrimental. For Mr. Potter here, he survived with far less damage than he should have. He should consider himself lucky.”
“Actually, Madame Pomfrey told me that you’ve been taking up time in the hospital wing, apprenticing her. She said that you are interested in becoming a healer.”
“Fuck, look at you.” He whispered crawling back up to kiss Draco full on the mouth. “So fucking precious.”
“Oh, now you want to communicate?!” Draco rebutted back. “Why should I? It’s not like YOU want to do this thing together! I have done everything only for you this far. It’s been a day! A fucking day and I regret this! I would’ve rather died than married you! Because you know what’s worse than being married to someone you don’t like? Being married to someone you love that HATES you!”
Draco propped himself up on his elbows and watched as Harry pulled off his underwear slowly and tantalizingly. They both gasped as Draco’s half-hard cock sprang upward, Harry at the sight and Draco at the sensation.
Harry felt his cheeks heat and his heart clench. He breathed deeply before replying "I think you deserve a second chance." He said with a shrug. "Now go shower, I'll make dinner."
Draco just wanted to bond with Harry. He would never regret it, as Harry told him he might. Harry was the only being Draco had ever wanted. Harry was his Alpha.
"I know Hermione, I know. I'll be careful. I have been so far. You don't have to worry, honest." Harry said, trying to calm his friend's frantic nerves.
Oh damn. There goes a twitch. And another one as Harry tightened his arms around Draco’s waist. Draco squirmed uncomfortably to hide the fact that Harry pressed up against him made him feel more than a little aroused.
He hated when she did that. And by that, he means give him every reason to rethink his feelings or perceptions.
He quickly swallowed and said "It's alright, I can read it later. I'd like to talk to you actually."
Draco bit his lip and giggled at Harry's worries over him. “Yes, everything is fine.” Harry visibly relaxed. “It's about us, actually.” The stiffness returned, wide eyes accompanying it.
Harry gulped. He mouthed like a fish for a moment, taking in everything the Professor just said. Then it clicked.
“Wait, did you just make me agree to all those things because you actually thought I’d do them, or just to prove a point?”
He was so excited too. He was excited to marry Harry, to call him his and to just be with him. He just wanted to show the boy love because he was never able to do that before. Draco vowed to always be there for Harry, through anything and everything, thick and thin, even if they were fighting.
20 minutes later, when they had ascended into the air and were cruising along, he gently put the magazine down, crept into the small bathroom the plane supplied, and locked the door behind him. Before he could even turn around, he bit his fist to stem the pitiful sounds he made as hot tears streamed down his face.
Harry sighed and said “I know this is hard for you, and it’s confusing and totally messed up, but I want to be there for you. I want to help you, let me help you.”
He watched the Omega bite his lip in concentration as he made yet another list, putting a broad smile on Harry’s face. He walked up behind Draco and snaked an arm around the thin waist, he pressed a soft kiss against his neck. Draco chuckled as he turned his head to capture Harry’s lips against his own.
Harry turned and ran, Malfoy right on his heels. As the door slammed shut behind them, they could both hear a loud scream of frustration then a loud ruskas as if Snape had just swiped his hand across his desk, causing everything to crash and break on the floor.
Draco looked for anything to take his gaze off of the all encompassing green that stared at him so brightly. “Well, yeah, kind of. I’ve, um, never done anything with a-a bloke before. Only a few girls, but nothing huge. I-I don’t know. What about you?”
Harry chuckled. “I just wanted to check in. I’m in the mood for take out; anything you want?” He asked politely.
“Then you said those things last night when you were feeling so raw after the seizure and everything, so I thought you really meant them. But now you’re saying you actually love me and that it’s not the prophecy making you love me. So does the prophecy have an effect over your emotions or not?”
"Yes, but it seems that the prophecy's physical affects, specifically the pain, started once we returned to England. Does location play a factor in the prophecy's ability to have control over us?" Draco asked, beginning to get flustered over every new piece of information.
Draco screamed, wrapping a hand around the base of his cock, staving off his orgasm for as long as time and pressure would let him.
The rest of the day, Draco spent alone, roaming the house in an attempt to better familiarize himself with the new(ish) space. He didn’t want to think about Harry’s attitude since meeting with the healers back at St. Mungo’s. He realized, after spending so much time with him, that Harry was one to mold himself around his environment, and clearly, he didn’t agree with the energy at St. Mungo’s.
Once they arrived at the airport, Draco helped to unpack the bags so the flight crew could repack them into the private aircraft. Harry went right into the plane without so much as a look his way.
Of course he is, Draco thought. He’s an Ex Death Eater of Merlin’s sake! Why would anyone be proud of that?
Draco grabbed Harry’s wrists, where his hands held Draco’s cheeks, and held onto them tightly. “I know.” He sniffled.
“I was lonely last night, after you came here to sleep. I missed having you beside me.” Harry replied.
“I’m a little concerned about the effects of this prophecy. Harry had revealed to me the other night after our first visit, that he experiences pain when we’re not together. I assume that’s due to the prophecy trying to get us to connect more with each other.”
Kingsley sat back in his chair and thought for a moment. “I assume you don’t want to join the Aurors by any chance?” Harry shook his head, about to speak but was cut off by Kingsley. “Yeah, Robards can make anyone want to leave the Aurors, nevermind join them. He’s a tricky one, that man. ...I do have a position that will soon be free. My right-hand adviser is retiring at the end of the month. You are welcome to take the position. It’s a fairly easy position. There’s not much to do unless I need a second opinion, or a hand with difficult cases, which aren’t too common. I’m glad you came actually, because I’m certain you’d be perfect for the job. It comes with your own office space. As for Draco, he can be part of the Ministry’s ingoing/outgoing memo and mail responding staff. We always need more of them. It can be arranged for him to work close by you.”
Draco spun around and stared at Harry with a serious expression “Are you sure you want to finish that sentence?”
“So, Potter. Got any plans for tonight?” Draco asked nonchalantly. He asked this to all his customers, wanting to know if they had plans so he could help design the perfect style for the event.
Harry didn’t mind. Aside from his previous years in Hogwarts, he was actually passing Potions for once. Without the distraction of Hermione and Ron (who were currently in Transfiguration; they had a single class of Potions after Harry), as well as Snape’s tendency to ignore him so far this year, he remained quiet and attentive throughout the lessons. Any time they were making Potions in class, he’d pair up with a small, shy Ravenclaw; Milly, he believed her name was. She was good at Potions, and they always passed or did better than a pass during their partnership.
“So how is ferret doing? You guys have taken quite the blow recently with the Prophet and everything. How’re you taking it?”
The blond didn’t even have a chance to turn around. He was hit with the unknown spell, the one Harry had tried uncovering for months prior to, ever since he got a hold of the potions textbook. He didn’t know what the spell did, but he was dying to find out- and what better subject to test it on than his rival?
Draco continued his work, luckily not getting any cursed mail on his first day. No one really spoke throughout the shift, and Draco certainly didn’t say anything else.
Clearly not in the mood to socialize, Draco left Harry alone and went to the kitchen to make himself some lunch. He’d heard the shower turn on, then off 10 minutes later. Harry never was one to take long showers.
Malfoy shifted into his own space, away from Harry, filled his plate with breakfast, and ate in silence until they left for class.
Harry entered and the big smile returned on his face once he caught sight of Draco. He scooped him up in a big hug and kissed him passionately. They stood there for a few moments, lost in each other before Draco pulled back, and bent over practically coughing up a lung.
“I guess because I’ve loved you for so long, and it took so much to get to where we are, I just couldn’t believe you could feel the same way about me as I feel about you. I love you so much, and for you to even come close to feeling the same way, I had to make sure you actually felt it, and weren’t being made to feel it. It was truly nothing against you, you can just never be too careful when it comes to magic.”
“Harry, baby, Harry! Oh no, no, no, you don’t get to do this to me.” Draco freaked, as he watched over his husband.
Ron watched the exchange between his two friends before he spoke, "Umm, 'Mione, I know you're worried, but you should have a little more trust in Harry. I know he just flipped out on the Minister and Wizengamont, but he's managed to keep his magic in check, so far." He turned and addressed Harry, "And Harry, I know she can be a worrywart," he received a glare from Hermione for that, "but really she just doesn't want to see something bad happen to you." Ron finished with a sympathetic smile, gracing his freckled features. Harry looked at his best mate with a slight frown, but shared a tight-lipped smile nonetheless. Ron looked past Harry's shoulder towards the courtroom as he caught sight of one of the Aurors approaching them. "Now, they're calling you back in. Go and save the bloody ferret, once again." He said with an eye roll.
Harry sighed and shrugged. “I honestly don’t know. He’s doing ok. We’re doing ok. I talked to Kingsley today, he’s gonna shut it down.”
“Draco, it wasn’t meant like that. It was just a suggestion for me to get out everyday and do something. If you’re interested, I’m sure I can get you a job, too. Maybe we can both work closely under the Minister. Doesn’t it get boring being here all day, everyday?” Harry had moved around the desk, and knelt down in front of Draco in his chair. He grabbed both his hands and kissed them gently.
After Draco was fully hard and leaking, without a word, he pulled out of Harry’s mouth, crawled down the bed once more, flipped the brunet over again, and promptly ate his arse out with the most splendid sounds.
“I think I’m going to go for a run.” Draco said suddenly. He got out of bed and dressed quickly, seeing as he was still naked. He was just about to walk out when Harry cleared his throat.
“Those are sent from the sender to the recipient through the Ministry halls. We never get memos down here, it’s against policy.”
“It’s alright baby, I like that you knew about that though. Have you been reading up on manifesting?” Harry asked, switching from petting to rubbing soothingly up and down Draco’s back.
Sorry it’s such a short chapter, but it’s meant as a filler. I’ll try to make it more interesting soon.
He could just have inhaled a large amount of dust sometime the night before. Probably from that damned comforter.
After being given the potions with strict directions Draco was sure to follow, the two men made their way back to their temporary home at Grimmauld Place.
Harry looked deeply into Draco’s eyes, adrenaline, fury and lust all mixed in a swirling pool of emotion within them. If he could only touch Harry just a little…
Harry smirked and shrugged. “Alright, but I'm still getting it for you. And you're going to wear it.”
He peed and washed his hands. Then, purely out of curiosity, he peeked in through the shower curtain to find one very naked Draco Malfoy-Potter.
Harry waited patiently for Kingsley to finish. His job sounded great, much like what he was doing now at home. Just reviewing files for Kingsley and his many ideas to add and subtract minor details to the Ministry, Hogwarts, and its post war-efforts. It was very easy work, however, that was an owl every few days at least. He could imagine how much more he’d have to input his opinion into Kingsley’s archaically vicious attempts at reassuring the wizarding population of Europe that Voldemort was dead. It was done with. Why couldn’t people just move on now? Not to forget what happened, but to rejoice that it ended how it did and continue on with their lives they might not have had, had Harry misstepped slightly. He was just tired of constantly being reminded of the war and Voldemort and how he ruined almost everything.
“Truth is, I’ve never had a real relationship. One with true feelings. I’m still trying to figure things out and I’m very confused because I feel things but I don’t know what they are. I don’t know what anything means, but I do know that you’re not as bad as I thought. You’re actually pretty great. And it took that argument to make me realize that. And that, possibly, maybe, I might..like you. I mean, we’re married now and we’re stuck together. But, now I’m not so averse to the thought. I guess, I don't know why or how, but I like being here, with you. It’s just going to take me awhile to give you every bit of me, because I don’t know how to do that. But I’ll learn. I’ll try.”
“I don’t appreciate being lied too, and it clearly wasn’t nothing if you had to close the door to prevent me from looking. What was the potion for?”
“I know. I lost control back there, and I really shouldn’t have. You’re still fragile, clearly, and it was my mistake to let go of my composure. I’m sorry if I hurt you.” Harry said sincerely.
Damn, it's been a really long time. Sorry about that guys. First part of this story is done though! I WILL be continuing with this story, so don't worry. I've been trying to figure out how to write this chapter and this is the best thing I've come up with so far. I'd love for you to review and give me some ideas/things you want me to incorporate in this series. Thank you :)
Draco obviously knew it had to be a nightmare. He had his own, but nothing like that. He nodded before asking “War?” He turned to see Harry nod, but no words came from him. He sighed before patting Harry’s leg. “Try and get some sleep.” He said as he made his way to stand.
As they walked closer to this beautiful piece of architecture, they could see sheer, white linen drapes cascaded down every wall, covered every window, and framed every doorway. Beautiful white and brown accents and decorations brought the whole theme together.
“I’m fine.” she said, rounding the bed and kissing his cheek affectionately. “Ron had to go into George’s this morning. He regrets not being able to see you, but he says hi. He’s doing well too.”
Now Harry was afraid that Draco was upset at him. Harry knew his friends meant it in a way that he get a hobby for him to have a regular routine again, to feel a bit more human with a schedule, instead of just being at home all the time. Not that he didn’t like being at home, especially with Draco, but the days did seem to just blur all together. It certainly wasn’t meant in a way to offend Draco.
Draco seemed to deflate somewhat at that. He sat there silently for a minute. He didn’t bring up what Harry had said about his behaviour earlier that day, and he was actually glad about it. He must’ve came after that part. The blond had been all sorts of moody lately, and Harry really didn’t want to set him off anymore than he already had been. But only because Harry couldn’t handle it. He’d been on one hell of a rollercoaster lately, and his magic had been harder to control than normal. At breakfast, he lost control out of nowhere and the window they sat beside at the restaurant, shattered. They were never going back there again.
Draco just flopped back down on the bed and stared blankly at the ceiling. “My husband is being controlled by magic.”
He’s pulled out of his thoughts when he hears the question come from the reporter “Is there anyone special in your life? In a romantic sense, that is.”
“It seems that your presence helps him.” The medit-witch says. “Keep in contact with him. He might just recover quicker.” She says, then leaves the four of them alone.
“Do you really think that everything is alright?” Harry seethed quietly, loud enough for only the two of them to hear.
Sape pinched the bridge of his nose in agony. “Sectumsempra: to cut or slice by sword. If he was hurt physically, which is what it was intentionally made for, he would’ve been cut to pieces as if hit by a sword. Since it wasn’t though, his mind has now taken the damage. It as severed all that is reality to him. He can not, and will not control himself. If you don’t want to be covered in blond Malfoy until he’s fixed, I suggest you STAY AWAY.” And with that, Snape left the hospital wing without a glance back, leaving Harry to question all that is magic and how it got him into this mess.
When Draco found the pilot to ask where they were and where they were to go, Harry continued to gaze around in awe. He had never been anywhere other than England and Scotland, especially not for a tropical vacation.
“So what are you going to do now?” Hermione asked, wanting the rest of the story. They continued to fill them in, making sure to leave out their conversation from lunch.
Draco glanced up through the stairwell and back towards Harry and the room beside his. He chewed his lip nervously before asking, just above a whisper "Is it alright - I mean - um - if I could - uh - have that one?" He quickly pointed to the spare room beside Harry's. "I mean, I don't want to be intruding in your space..." he started before he noticed the beaming grin hanging off Harry's face, then quietly faded out.
“Give. It. To. Me.” Snape ordered. He Summoned it and Snape caught it. “If i ever catch you using that spell on anyone, I will use it myself. On you. Understood?” He whispered menacingly to Harry.
Draco bit his lip again and nodded. "It's ok though, I can just wash these-" he said pulling on his shirt but was quickly interrupted by Harry.
Draco put the book down and sat back. He ran his hands through his hair again and again trying to calm his nerves. It was a lot to take in. He needed to talk to someone, he needed an explanation. Why did this always happen to him? First the Dark Mark: although now faded, it was something he would’ve been happy to live without. The Death Eater title, or Ex-Death Eater now, had only brought on unwanted comments and abuse. He regretted what he did more than he could say, but he didn’t have a choice. Now his inheritance. He would’ve been happy to be able to choose his own spouse, and not need some age-old magic do it for him. When would he be able to choose his own path in life?
Harry laughed at that and stripped down, before jumping in from where he stood above the water. Draco shrieked as he got splashed, and when Harry surfaced, wet and gleaming, Draco felt his mouth water.
Harry attempted to lift his hips up to touch his cock, but Draco was thrusting so powerfully, he wasn’t able to manage it.
The medi-witch nodded, a stance of pure business and professionalism radiating off of her. Draco admired the behaviour, wondering if he could project the same if he were in such a tasking position.
Draco laughed. A full out, very unattractive and very inappropriate for such a fancy restaurant, guffaw. Harry peaked a little smile, too.
“Hell no.” Harry laughed as he grabbed Draco waist, pulled him into his lap and attacked his neck vigorously.
Harry breathed a deep breath, tightened his hold on Draco, and kissed him full and hard on the mouth. A passionate and sexy kiss.
“I don’t know what I am.” She put her cup down and laced her fingers together. “I’m surprised that this happened; confused how it did; questioning what could’ve made you talk to him before I had a chance too. Knowing you, you would’ve scared him off. But, if you two are able to get over your past and differences, then I guess... I’m happy for you. As long as you’re treating each other well, that is.”
Her smile grew. “Yes. He’s so happy to be with you Draco. He hasn’t been able to stop talking about you. Good things, I mean. He really likes you Draco.”
“Want you now…” Malfoy whispered, cupping his hand behind Harry’s neck, looking down at his lips as he leaned forward.
As he was trying to think how much Harry has changed since they graduated a few months ago, the subject of his thoughts exited the bathroom and came to lie down beside him. Draco smiled at him and Harry smiled back, though a little strained. Draco wasn’t one to beat around the bush, he really wanted to know what was wrong with Harry.
Once they arrived, she ushered the two of them into her office to have privacy during their discussion.
Weasley’s eyebrows practically disappeared into his hairline as he saw Harry wrap himself around Draco.
A few days later, Draco and Harry sat on the sofa, enjoying some telly and a few glasses of wine. Quite a few, if you asked the two empty bottles on the kitchen counter.
“I said ‘I’m fine.’ I don't need you babying me. I can take care of myself. Anyways, nothing's wrong and I'm not sick.” He said, huffing and crossing his arms.
Harry visibly relaxed and caught the message Draco was throwing at him. He smirked and asked “I think we've established that we're mates now,” Draco chuckled, “and, I'd really like to be with you. So, Draco Malfoy, would you like to be my mate-made-boyfriend?”
Draco sits puzzled, once again, as he comes up with no answers as to why Harry was taken away from him.
“That couch is not suitable for sleeping. Don’t get any ideas, though. This is my last resort.” Harry huffed and pulled the covers over his head.
Draco had finally convinced Harry to go in the more expensive and posh looking stores after finding nothing in Harry's regular department stores. He wasn't worried about the money, being rich helps, he just didn't want to deal with the kind of people that shopped in the expensive and posh looking stores. When they apparated onto the front step outside, they saw the door was unlocked. Immediately, they pulled out their wands and shared a look before they crept inside.
Snape was now standing, leaning over his desk menacingly, with his hands spread far apart to hold himself up, seeming to keep all of his restraint from reaching forward and strangling Harry with his bare hands.
“Yeah, interested. It’s not a for-sure thing yet.” Harry mumbled, scuffing his shoe on the floor. It’s true, he was interested in medicine of the magical sort, but he wasn’t 100% sure that that’s what he wanted to do. It just seemed interesting.
Hermione wasn’t shocked by Harry’s outburst. He’d been like this all morning. At least he showed an emotion besides a mind-numbing expressionless mood that seemed to haunt everyone around him for the past month.
“Not that we’re aware of.” Hermione says. “I feel like he would’ve told us. Or he would’ve experienced one with us. We were together all the time at school.”
“Harry! Nice to see you again. And Draco, you as well. I hope you’re both well?” The Minister greeted them, shaking both their hands firmly.
“I’m so fucking excited for this, Dray. You are fucking amazing, I hope you know.” Harry said, lining up and pushing slightly.
Harry silently chuckled to himself before interrupting Dracos small rant, asking “Need some help with that?”
“Don’t. Just shut the fuck up and listen. You don’t get to come into my shop and disrupt my day like that, after that stunt you pulled the other night. All of those stunts, actually. If you think I’d waste my time with someone who does those things, or behaves like that towards me, you are worse than I thought you to be.” Draco said, glad he’d now said his part.
“Oh, come on now.” Harry said, easily, EASILY, lifting Draco up and settling him back onto the large table. “Tell me, what did you want to talk about.”
“Like it hot, scum?” Crabbe shouts, but Draco can tell by the terrified look on his face that he has no control over what he’s done. Flames pursue Weasley and Crabbe alike, licking unnaturally large and fast over the towers of junk.
Dahlia ignored this last barb, flicking her cigarette. A tiny ember landed at Dao's feet. “Kayala didn't want us calling it that.”
“It’s fine. I’m just saying,” Harry glanced over at Draco, who had drained his mug and listened attentively, “I’m not dating him because I feel sorry for him. Maybe, deep down, that’s why I let him approach me, but that’s definitely not the case anymore. I genuinely like you, Draco,” He continued, speaking now directly to his boyfriend, “For lots of reasons. It’d take me all day to list them all. I hope you don’t think I’m with you just because I feel obliged to.”
Harry thought triumphantly, as various fluids dripped down his warm body onto the flagstones. Looking around, he chuckled as he noticed how much of a mess they’d both made, though cleaning it up wouldn’t erase this glorious memory of Malfoy bleeding at his mercy, a memory Harry would surely recall many midnights in Gryffindor Tower with the scarlet hangings pulled tight round his bed.
Hermione’s lips press into a thin line. She grabs her basket of finished laundry and heads up the stairs. Ron doesn’t meet Harry’s eyes, scratching the ears of their dog.
"May I kiss you?" Draco whispered, so politely that Harry had a fleeting urge to give in, but he pulled his hand away instead.
The krasue, for Joey felt sure that no English word identified what she saw, had a body made of organs - there was no better or simpler way to describe it. From its floating head dangled an esophagus, a stomach, and ropes of intestine that eerily made no noise as they swung, dripping sickeningly with blood. An unbeating heart, connected by blackish-red veins, glowed from its center with pulsing blue light.
Harry’s voice came to him, muffled, as if through a door. Trying to slow his breathing, Draco glanced up, meeting eyes as deep green as the fountain water.
Dao’s power was waning. Harry felt it, felt sure that if there were no dementors around, he could break through her spell, make a desperate leap for their wands and potions, buy more time for Joey.
Hermione mouthed to Harry. He shook his head at her, but she gave him a threatening look, and he relented.
The snake’s black tongue flicked forward. It was ten meters away. Seven. Five. Draco stumbled backward, putting distance between them, but he could see the beast’s eyes still. Did it have teeth? Would it strangle him? He felt himself growing faint.
Yet Draco is here now, and as more people crowd into the bar, he stumbles and catches himself on the counter, thigh pressing against Harry’s, shoulder poking into his side. This time, it’s Draco who apologizes, and Harry replies that it’s fine, but he’s distracted - a lock of lilac has flopped its way from Draco’s otherwise perfectly done hair.
“Ahhh, our little Harry fancies a girl, eh?” Ron teased with a Weasley-twin-esque grin. Harry chuckled wryly at “little”; though he was about two inches taller than Hermione, Ron still towered over them both.
“No, no…it’s fine. It’s just been a while since I’ve performed a spell like that. I’ll be all right in a minute.”
It was Draco’s turn now, and he tensed uncomfortably under everyone’s gaze. “I guess…Same as Weasley. Looking forward to the future.” His voice quavered slightly at the last word, and though everyone else missed it, Harry certainly hadn’t.
“Muggles have to pay a lot for international calls,” Harry explained quickly. “This one doesn’t usually go overseas, but it’s got a little…” He stuttered at the word “magic” and said instead, “Help.”
“Well, yeah, but I didn’t think you’d get close,” Ron said. “It’s weird, you hanging out so much with him and stuff. Harry,” he added, lowering his voice. “He was a Death Eater.”
“Oh - thanks.” Harry took the bracelet and slipped it onto his wrist. Ron, Hermione, and Draco were all wearing one, though Draco looked less than thrilled about it. Luna was wearing five on either wrist and her hair was adorned with a few, which appeared accidental. “What are these for?”
And just like that, Harry knew they were properly friends again. Ron put his arm around Hermione, and Draco kissed Harry’s cheek without checking to see if anyone was watching. The four -
“Break for scrimmage,” Ginny announced. “Sort out your sides. Fiona, Harry, gloves on for the Snitch.”
Joey looked down at her hands, resting in her lap. “I come from powerful bloodlines, both wizard and Muggle. Nigeria doesn’t really have a Statute of Secrecy. The country’s ruled by Muggles, so wizards, who don’t have much access to wands, are driven into hiding and never stay in one place long enough to gain a deeper understanding of magic. Any real wizard autonomy in my country existed long before my time.
A wide smile spread across Harry’s face; tears of relief began to pool in his eyes, and he didn’t even try to blink them away. Of course, Hermione and Ron would accept him. They’d been to the cusp of life and death together, made mistakes together, got into fights and made up, saw each other fall for the wrong people more than once. Harry felt stupid that he’d considered the possibility of Ron and Hermione treating him like an outsider.
“Draco?” Harry wonders aloud - he’s never heard the name before - and as soon as he does, he’s falling, leaving the name behind, tumbling into the dark. His tie whips against his face; he loses his glasses, but there’s nothing to see, only ink.
Dahlia took out a stack of mail and began to sort through it. One of the envelopes caught Harry’s eye as it slid out. An involuntary shock trembled down his spine as he recognized the color - ruby red, like fresh blood. The shade was unmistakable.
“Excellent work, as usual,” He commended. Draco smiled smugly as Pansy threw both he and Harry a dirty look from across the dungeon.
The warm rays of sunshine gently illuminated their faces. Harry could barely believe the scene had been so idyllic only minutes before.
The effect was immediate. Joey gasped, dropping the empty cup, and she stared at the ceiling, eyes rapidly becoming so bloodshot that the whites turned crimson. Veins along her arms and neck bulged as if about to burst.
“Phoenix?” Harry asked, and Ray nodded, sending the amulet swinging. The feather's scarlet glow bounced about the gem's reflecting sides; Draco was nearly hypnotized with it. Ray smelled rather distractingly of the same spices that had been hovering around the market.
“Gotcha!” A girl shouted, throwing away the photobooth’s curtain. The two young men jumped apart, pressing themselves against the opposite sides of the small box. Draco’s head hit the wall with a thunk, and he winced.
On the pullout couch, Harry slumbers, his mind wrought with memory. Years and years of it, tearing away from his cortex, and dissolving into nothingness.
“What?” Harry said, caught off guard by the suggestion. “What, no, I stopped being a Parselmouth when…you know.”
The Quidditch pitch, however, remained nearly untouched. Its towering vastness was slippery with the earlier morning’s mist, wind whistling through its multiple nooks and crannies.
The glow from the solitary lamp, burning steadily with its electrical loyalty, bathes the scene in warmth. Justin’s eyelids droop; he wishes he were back in front of the monitor, methodically clicking away. But he’s confined across the room, forced to watch a flame burn between his girlfriend and his boss, a flame that…
At the beginning of the new term, the inhabitants of Hogwarts stayed in bed for as long as they possibly could, their sleep schedules not yet adjusted from the activity-filled nights and late mornings of the holidays. As dawn broke rosily over the snow-covered hills, the corridors sheltered only a few early risers and professors preparing for the day. Down one of the castle’s many hallways strode two eighth years, black school robes flapping in their wake.
“Oh - Thank you.” Padma takes it and sips. It’s nearly black, with a dribble of milk, and no sugar. “It’s just how I like it. How did you know?”
From within his robes, Kevin retrieved a delicate gold chain with a crystal watch hanging off the end. The instrument seemed dainty in his enormous hands. “
She was grateful that she could still cast spells. The potion she’d drunk in Vietnam, or the poison it had meant to counter - one or both had sapped her physical strength, making her more tired more easily, but her magic hadn’t suffered. Not yet at least.
“Darla Major was a twelve-year-old Muggle,” Caroline said gravely, once she realized Joey wasn’t going to read the rest of the article. “The niece of England’s Prime Minister. I do not know if Draco knew that. The Death Eaters killed Muggles indiscriminately in those days.”
Harry’s mind immediately became clouded in suspicion. The way Malfoy wouldn’t meet his eyes, how he made sure to close the door, his pale hands fidgeting…it was enough to make any other Gryffindor to quietly reach for their wand.
His companion gropes about in her mind for an answer, but she’s equally benighted. “We’ll help him. We’ll save Draco, I promise you.”
“Yeah, fine,” Pansy sighs, dragging herself off the armchair she’s claimed. She slides, sock feet on a wooden floor, and stops in front of the door. “Hi, Luna,” She says as she opens it.
It had changed, not drastically, from their negotiations, but Harry’s smooth baritone had somehow gotten even darker and huskier, like raw honey.
Only when the quartet reached the Slytherin common room did they take off their numerous layers. Hermione and Ron settled by the armchair, the former whispering something in the latter’s ear. Harry wiped the melted snow off his glasses while Draco folded his scarf and gloves, putting both in the large pockets of his black overcoat.
Draco looked from the letter to the writing kit, immediately putting the pieces together. “You’re the most ridiculously sentimental person ever,” He decided. “But maybe you’re right.” He opened the box, took out a sheet of parchment, and smoothed it onto the stone tablet. Next came the inkwell, carefully set upon the cobblestones. The plumed quill trembled with uncertainty in the dim light. “Will you help me?”
The trippy, in-and-out-of-consciousness style was the most fun part about writing this fic. Every chapter, every new scene that took place in Harry’s mind was an opportunity to experiment with his backstory, his doubts, and the way his thoughts manifested in a tangible form under the influence of Lockhart’s technology.
The curse had cut her nearly an inch deep, and Draco winced in sympathy when he saw that even her ribs had been nicked. The cuts snaked from her waist up to her chest. “You’re going to be okay,” Draco muttered, mostly to convince himself, but the unconscious Joey didn’t hear him.
“Staying here, I expect,” Draco said evenly, but Harry could see the bitter look in his eyes; of course, Draco would stay at Hogwarts if his own family didn’t welcome him.
“No, they’re just racist,” Joey said bluntly, pulling out a folded piece of paper from her pocket - instructions from Auror Melocotones.
On a whim, Draco reached down and slipped off his shoes. The rough sand was a little cold, but he hardly noticed. Draco rolled up his trouser cuffs and edged into the water, which was freezing, even at this time of year. It was invigorating, the chill clenching his muscles just enough to shock. Behind him, he heard Harry’s bare footsteps, and soon he waded next to him.
“Luna!” A grin spread across Harry’s face as he realized who it was. “It’s nice to see you.” Though many people may call her Loony, Harry felt that her oddball personality was the welcome, familiar thing he needed then.
Two related accounts nestle close. Two men, whose recklessness and fear tore them apart faster than they had come together.
Draco did not respond. He shrunk away, pulled himself from Harry, and curled his knees to his chest. Harry started to reach out to smooth his hair but left for the kitchen instead. Draco didn’t need to be showered with affection right now. Hell, Harry wasn’t sure
Joey realized she was standing nose to the grate, hands hanging limp at her sides. “Yes,” she mumbled, too preoccupied with her thoughts to apologize as she stepped out of the lift.
“Yes, but…” Henderson frowned at Joey, tapping his chin. “Aura blocking is not something the Healers in London will have any experience with. Nor the Healers here, even. I’m assuming you want it fixed?”
“Me too.” She reaches forward, taking his hand for the first time. She’s never allowed herself to feel this much for anyone until now, to empathize. Only now, when everything, their lives, their souls, are on the line, can she find it within herself to comfort her friend. “We’ll think of something.”
With an almighty groan, the dragon’s eyes fluttered closed, and it buckled towards the stone roof. Draco’s swell of victory didn’t last long as the beast’s massive body began to slide off.
“I think I’m gonna be sick,” Draco murmured, paling, but he stood his ground. Joey, on the other hand, bent double and vomited for the second time that week.
Joey rested a hand on one of the bags of rice, the cloth rough under her palm. Her stomach turned suddenly, and she took a deep breath, waiting for the discomfort to pass.
“Thanks,” Harry muttered, feeling the edges with his fingers before throwing them across the lake. Ron mimicked him, skipping stones, so they bounced four or five times on the surface. As they threw, Ron began to discuss Quidditch, asking his best friend about Gryffindor’s upcoming match with Hufflepuff the next week. Harry tossed out what he hoped were satisfactory answers, but in truth, he barely followed the conversation. He focused more on his own thoughts and the path of his stones. Each bounce elicited a slight splashing sound, and Harry found the rhythm strangely soothing as if he was listening to the clipped cadence of Draco’s speech.
Harry picked up the painstakingly detailed notes, which seemed to record some sort of experiment. Phrases like
Dao eyed Harry and Draco as they slowly approached, weapons at the ready. Her hands slowly began to fill with lightning, blue and lilac bolts flashing between her fingers. Her eyes darted between them, but Draco understood it as well as she did - to attack them would leave her guard way open. Dao relented, letting the magic dissipate. Natural lightning lit up the sky behind her, briefly throwing harsh daylight upon the clearing.
Just then, the door flew open, revealing Professor Dahlia, whose short black hair was dripping wet. Beneath her black robes, the jeans and T-shirt she was wearing seemed to be damp as well, but she strode to the front of the classroom as if nothing was out of the ordinary.
Harry exchanged a glance with his boyfriend. Questions, in their experience, weren’t often a good thing.
The pages behind this journal entry have been torn out. Today is apparently the first time he’s written in it for two whole years.
“It just occurred to me that we could have ridden that thing out,” Harry mused, surprisingly calm as the building crumbled beneath their feet.
“Didn’t I tell you? He’s the new undersecretary to the new Minister for Magic,” Ron said. Hermione looked much impressed.
Ginny put down her toast and wiped the crumbs off on her robes. “We’ve talked about it a lot, and we decided not to make a big fuss. After telling Ron and Hermione, we’ll just start holding hands in public more, kissing when a straight couple would be expected to kiss. If we act like everything’s normal, maybe everyone else will, too.” She gave him a shaky yet hopeful smile. “We might have stayed in the dark forever if it wasn’t for you.”
“My humblest apologies,” Melocotones said with an obnoxious bow of the head. “Please, stick close to me, all of you. We shan’t speak of the mission’s details in the open.” He turned rather jauntily and headed back to the pedestal, the trio of young Aurors close at his heels. Melocotones took out his wand, and Draco inhaled sharply, glancing about at the Muggles, but none of them seemed to notice. Melocotones slid the tip of his wand vertically down the brick. Nothing appeared to change, but Joey felt the atmosphere shift, something like cinnamon and ancient, castle-bred musk drifting from within the pedestal. The scent of magic.
A particularly souped-up moped sped close by, and the noise prompted Ron to ask, “So, where are you?”
“Potter!” One of them calls and kicks the ball over. Harry takes it with ease, dodging one opponent, passing off the ball when he can’t handle the next. The sun begins to peek through the clouds, and Harry uses the extra visibility to his advantage, watching, waiting for an opening.
She begins to load the boxes of files and tapes into her car, starting with the most recent ones. Piles upon piles of memories, intertwined with the people that lived them, accumulate.
Joey glared at her. “I’m finished here. Think about what I’ve said.” She turned, heading for the door.
It was clear what her rival thought - they laughed gaily as the wildly shot bullets flew into the trees behind them, and they knocked the gun out of Joey’s hand with another spell.
He mouthed to himself as he headed for the dormitory. Well…he wasn’t planning to break up with Draco after Hogwarts. Hopefully, they’d stay together as Aurors - working as exes would be painfully awkward, to say the least.
“Hermione, let’s buy some Toothflossing Stringmints for your parents,” Ron suggested, “And maybe I’ll get Canary Puffs for Bill and Charlie, they miss those…”
“Well-worded, Hermione. Three points to Gryffindor.” Dahlia nodded approvingly. “Yes, that’s more or less what I’m getting at. Humans, Muggle or no, inherently have light and dark parts, our wistful hopes and tendency to kindness constantly at war with our nightmares and thirst for revenge.” Professor Dahlia swept her wand through her Patronus, which dissipated, leaving the chamber slightly darker. “As magic users, we are able to channel our souls, in their entirety, through our wands. But we cannot treat this responsibility lightly. Let your lightness, your kindness, shine through your magic. ‘Cast with compassion,’ as one of my own teachers used to say. Because doing the opposite can have destructive results.” Her warm eyes landed on someone. “Draco, would you like to share your thoughts on this?”
“I…I tortured her. But I refused to kill her.” Draco tried to focus on the green of the grass, trying to erase the image of Voldemort’s red eyes, gleaming viciously in the dark. “And then…” He stopped.
From the far side of the clearing, Harry saw Draco's eyes widen. He met his gaze, and in a split second, they understood each other and moved in unison, breaking through the magical constraints. Harry, closer to Joey, dove for her - a cold, steely force tried to tug her away, but he thrust out his hand, weakening Rabbit’s spell. Simultaneously, Draco reached into his pocket and pulled out a rosy, orange-colored vial. He dropped it and crushed the glass beneath his heel.
“Your aura is more than blocked,” Faraday said, brow furrowing. “It’s been…sabotaged. I think you’ve been poisoned.”
I'm so glad to be back to WTSC after a month-long hiatus! (c. Aug-Sept 2020) The break was definitely what I needed; I wrote some original short stories and started a new Drarry fanfiction (it's not published yet and won't be for a while). But no worries, I'm still invested in this particular story. I want to take this time to thank everyone who's been following WTSC; 36 chapters and 100K+ words is a big commitment! A reminder, though, that there is more to come... In any case, I hope you enjoy the rest of the story, and that it continues to make you smile, make you think, and make you believe in love again.
“I still don’t get it,” Draco said thoughtfully as their hands drifted apart. “Why you’re so intent on giving me a second chance.”
Draco blinked, not entirely understanding what this meant, but he bent his head. “Thank you for your hospitality.”
“Erm…” There’s something off in his gaze. Draco’s hands clench as they fall to the bed. He glances away, thinking. “The Charles River is frozen this time of year.”
“It’s a lucky thing we’re exempt from mid-year exams, or you’d never finish,” Hermione scolded one evening as she added writing to her color-coded notes. “And lucky that only the thesis for the extended essay is due before holiday.”
A Muggle weapon in a magical  fight. Harry wasn’t sure if Joey was either very brave or a complete idiot.
“Er…oh, damn.” Harry stopped in the middle of the corridor and clapped a hand to his forehead. “Left mine in class.”
The scent of marijuana lingers in the worn carpet, not quite overtaken by the scent of Hermione’s new potted orchids. She and her husband, Ron, sit on opposite sides of the living room, her folding laundry and him petting the fat, grizzled corgi on his lap as Harry speaks.
I need to know. The thought repeats like a chant through Luna’s head as she kneels by the desk, gingerly pulling on all the drawer handles, one by one. The top right drawer doesn’t give way; it’s locked. With shaking hands, Luna searches her pockets, finding a couple of loose bobby pins in one. She pushes one against the desk, bending it into shape, cursing when she drops it.
Narcissa, wasting away in her Azkaban cell. She had been coldly civil to Harry the few times he’d visited, which he supposed was fair. He worked for the system that kept her in there, after all. Harry’s stomach turned when he realized that Lucius had died just feet away from her. How long did Narcissa sit with her husband’s corpse before the guards took him away?
Before Harry could check on his teammates, iciness suddenly washed over him, as if he’d been dunked in the wintry Black Lake. Tears pricked his eyes. It didn’t matter that he’d downed two opponents - more enemies were to come. They would always come, in crippling numbers, and there was nothing he could do about it. Fred, his parents, Dumbledore, Moody…Their sacrifices had all been in vain.
“Still, I would not stoop to being friends with seventeen-year-old you,” Draco says firmly. “So, I suppose my question is…have you changed?”
going to curse his eyebrows off. Instead, he sighed in defeat, walked over to Harry, and perched on the edge of the sofa.
“You did,” Draco said, pulling his sleeve back down. He took a deep breath. Harry knew most of his secrets by now; he might as well give him the whole truth. “Remember back in October when I left school for a few days?” Potter nodded, and Draco gave him an abridged account of what had happened at Malfoy Manor.
“Oh, I know.” Ron kissed the top of Hermione’s head, and she beamed. He returned the smile, still in the same inexplicably buoyant mood he’d been in when they started. Draco saw him glance at Harry, and a message passed between them, a secret glance between friends. Draco tamped down rising feelings of jealousy; he was sure he’d find out what the look meant soon enough.
“Don’t think so.” It’s an evasive answer, coupled with a thin press of the mouth, but Harry doesn’t push the subject.
“Nearly a day,” Draco told her. Joey looked around, noticing that they were, once again, on the road, in the back of a truck bed. “The driver doesn’t know we’re here,” Draco informed, noticing her wandering gaze. “We’ve got
A sudden silence had fallen over their part of the field. The students closest to them stared, some shocked, a few indifferent, others mildly disgusted. Harry felt Draco tense, but he didn’t step away, only leaned closer, glaring around as if challenging anyone to object.
“Acquitted?” Joey looked at Draco, who had opened his eyes but still didn’t look thrilled to have a gun to his head. “You’re innocent?”
“Potter, don’t you have class?” Madam Pomfrey materialized behind them, precariously holding three various-colored bottles. She glanced down at their entwined hands but made no comment.
“Well, that’s our friendship scuppered,” Harry said sarcastically. “Can’t say a word to each other if it’ll hurt Ronnie’s finer feelings.”
“Not ready for m-more?” Ron stuttered as he started yawning as well. He squinted at the clock above the fireplace. “Oh. It’s past midnight. Although it’s Friday night, so we could play another game.”
“I must know you from there, then. I’m the assistant manager,” Draco says with an air of knowingly false superiority.
Harry thought the wind picked up, rushing over the deck, as the stranger left. He was probably just imagining things. He hoped so.
“Draco?” Harry asked as Draco turned the envelope over, scanning the blank side as if hunting for clues. “I’ll open it if you like.”
A wave of dizziness, brought on by Apparation, overtook Harry. Fresh pain shot through his forehead, and he steadied himself against a tree trunk, gritting his teeth.
“You’re not telling me everything,” Joey said decisively, jabbing the article. “If this got out, if this was true, there is no way the Academy would let him in. And if it did, the news would spread like wildfire.”
Icy rain shot by the windows as the trio walked along Hogwarts’s nearly empty hallways. Lately, the weather acted as indecisive as a child in a candy shop, switching from snow to pouring rain to cold sunlight as the heavens dictated.
“What?” Harry looked at the apple and blinked. “Oh. Er… I’m not supposed to bring food. Ron gave it to me, you see, and I forgot I had it…”
Yes, there it was, sneakily spiraling up the Ravenclaw goalpost. It would be hard for Harry to safely get to it, especially since Gryffindor was going more on the offensive. Draco clapped politely when his boyfriend’s team scored, ignoring the dirty looks he got from other Slytherins, who were there simply to heckle. “Forward, Potter,” He muttered, knowing Harry wouldn’t hear him, but miraculously, his broom dipped in the right direction.
“The whole, ‘oh, I’ll defend him, he’s not dangerous’ business,” Draco said. “It’s fine, I’m used to people acting like they’re afraid to have me around. They aren’t
A few beats of silence as the car turns, Harry’s hands flexing against the steering wheel. “Sorry if I was a little overbearing today,” Draco says.
The gleam in his eyes told Draco that he genuinely believed that. “When did you get so wise?” Draco asked teasingly.
And yet, he never gained the courage to speak to Joanne directly for the rest of the school year. Not until their circumstances forced it.
Pulling back, Draco briefly met Harry’s eyes before leaning forward. Their lips met with all the tenderness of two people who understood and cared for each other, but quickly there was something else, the same kind of desperation and desire for closeness that had brought them together in the first place. Draco no longer felt faint when Harry’s tongue parted his lips, but only moaned slightly, involuntarily, noticing with interest that he tasted of mint. As he was wont to do, Draco tangled one hand in Harry’s messy, damp-with-sweat locks, the other gripping the back of his shirt as if begging to tear it to shreds.
Sleep turned its nose up at them that night. Joey lay awake for hours on the couch in Charon’s living room, listening to the pedestrians and the few motorcycles that sped past the thin walls. In the early hours of the morning, it became quiet enough that she heard Draco and Harry, together on the floor mattress. She’d had a slight, nagging worry that they’d do something less than chaste, even with her nearby, but the only sounds were slight rustles of fabric as each turned to hold the other. A few times, Joey heard whispers, soft and slow words of comfort that she couldn’t quite make out but understood the meaning behind.
Luna shakes her head once. “I know where I’m going, Justin. I can’t decide anything for you. I have a job to do.”
about me?” Draco lamented, but he continued, “Physical contact is simply important to me. As it is to many others, in fact. No need to excessively read into it.” Harry snuck a glance at the blond and wasn’t terribly surprised to see that his pale face was flushed - although that could have been from the cold. “Sometime soon, you owe me secrets, too, Potter. It’s only fair.”
“Hmph. Well, it should be quite easy. Ooh, I wonder if we’re learning the theory, too?” Hermione’s eyes shone.
Harry tapped his broomstick against his thigh, thoughtfully. “Huh. I never thought about it that way. Wouldn’t that be cheating?”
Harry flicked his wrist, wand sliding into his hand; he cast a murmured spell about them, and the implement disappeared up his sleeve. “Muffling Charm,” He explained quickly. “Right. You know how Charon mentioned a few Aurors would be evacuating civilians as the dragon’s let loose?” Draco and Joey nodded. “They’re doing it to prevent collateral damage, obviously, during battle. And on the off chance that this whole thing,” He jerked his head vaguely towards the unseen ceiling, “Will collapse.”
Waiting was agony. Harry paced, drawing on the cave’s vast magical reserves to try and heal his cut. The bleeding had stopped, but pain still shot through his skull, and Harry muttered the same spell over and over again, doing his best to heal himself.
And then he stops, though even Luna is not sure why. His heart must be breaking, as hers is, into a million pieces.
Pain cracked along Draco Malfoy’s temple, and he brought a hand to it, feeling for blood. In front of him, Gavin Laurent backed away, panting, flexing his fingers to keep them from cramping. Draco saw the furious glint in Gavin’s pale blue eyes and knew that he wouldn’t care if he
“And there is much to explain,” Dahlia replied wearily. “Much to do, much to say. But what to do? What to say?” Her gaze searched the tangle of vines and leaves before her.
One good thing about Ron and Hermione ignoring him, Harry reflected, shoving his books into his bag as the bell rang, they wouldn’t ask where he rushed off to. He climbed up six flights of stairs in quite a hurry, leaving him panting slightly once he reached the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy demonstrating a pirouette to a group of trolls.
An enormous, silvery, glowing elephant, with gleaming white tusks, stood a few feet from the fountain. The Patronus - Draco felt that it must be one, though he’d never seen one twice as tall as himself - stood nonchalantly in the middle of the sidewalk. The Muggles nearby paid no mind, walking straight through the bright animal. Draco glanced nervously around, but no police, no sleek-robed wizards came to apprehend them.
“There are much easier ways to do that. Something like,” Harry cleared his throat, raised his voice slightly, and made a haughty face, “‘Potter, I
Draco hesitates, but even as he does, he leans closer, both basking in the other’s warmth. “Are you sure?”
Joey rested her head against the window and watched the city crawl by. The last thing she remembered was the warm, golden shape of a Buddha statue, its peaceful smile and her own drooping levels of adrenaline sending her into a restless sleep.
Healer Marigold had left momentarily to retrieve the necessary potions Drcao knew he’d have to fight Harry into taking, the stubborn Gryffindor he was.
“Body-binding me is no way to treat a guest, you imbeciles.” He sat up and rubbed the back of his head. “Where’s Harry?” He asked after a moment. Everyone turned to look behind Hermione. “Hiding already, Harry? I suppose so, we haven’t gotten to the fun parts, yet.” He smirked to himself.
“Something about me uniting with someone that I hate and makes me angry, signing off on old magic, and not to heed it as a warning but a guide. Oh, and he has blond hair and grey eyes.” He left out the part about how he thinks that its about him and Malfoy.
“Well, you passed out, but I hadn’t noticed until just before I came. I tried to pull out but I ended up… well coming, anyways. I pulled out right after and brought you here. I cleaned everything up, and turned out you'd came too. It was all over my drawers.” Harry laughed again. “I feel really bad though, I’m really sorry I let things continue…”
After that, he focused on his schoolwork, training to become a skilled potioneer. It was what he was best at, after all.
Harry stood and walked in front of the blond. Seeing his Omega in distress had really brought out his Alpha instincts. He crouched down to see him better and took his hands in his own. “If you're lost, I'll find you.” And with that, Draco broke down and a heartbreaking sob filled the silence in the study. Harry slipped his arms around his waist and pulled him in for an embrace.
When he moved back to the bed, he folded the comforter down to their feet and covered himself with the thin sheet instead. He closed his eyes and focused on sleep, when he felt a pair of strong, muscular arms snake around his bare waist. A pair of lips found their way onto his neck and started kissing him gingerly. He immediately leaned back into his boyfriend's embrace when a sinus-squeezing sneeze escaped him.
This chapter is mostly relating to them discussing bonding and their future together, with a bit of fun stuff in between ;)
He got out of the bed and unlocked the door. “Hi ‘Mione. Sorry, I just needed to get out for a minute.”
Harry lay awake for another hour or so, really considering why it was that he couldn’t submit to Draco’s request.
Harry stumbled through the fireplace in the living room of Number 12 Grimmauld Place before eagerly turning and waiting for a certain Omega to stumble in after him.
When the call ended and the flames died down again, Harry turned to take a seat at his desk, when he was taken by surprise at the blond already in his seat. How long had he been there for...?
Harry smiled sheepishly before nodding. “Yeah, ‘f course. Hey I’m going to make breakfast. What do you want?” He said, getting out of bed and throwing on his housecoat.
Harry breathed in his scent and kissed him again, and again, and again, until they were breathless and panting.
“Just deciding if I should leave you out here.” Harry lied, he really didn’t want to live with Malfoy.
“Now you’re prepared.” Harry smiled. Once Draco stopped arching, Harry wrapped himself over the blond, kissing his eyes, cheeks, neck, lips, everywhere basically, as e wandlessly conjured lube onto his cock and his mate’s pretty little hole.
“We’ll be ok. We’ll get through this, remember?” Draco repeated the words from their wedding, from when Harry was promised to Draco forever, and when Draco sincerely wanted to be there with him every step of the way.
“Yeah, I can tell you mate, you fucked up big on that one.” Ron commented, shovelling eggs into his mouth.
“Draco, honey. If you are worried he’s not attracted to you, don’t be. Otherwise I will personally perform a lobotomy on you ‘cause that level of stupidity is not allowed on this earth. If you are worried about him judging you for being marked, ask yourself why. You said he was really interested in your job? That’s a sign that he’s interested in your present, not your past. Old Draco has nothing on current Draco. Current Draco with his own business, choices, life. You are a good man, Draco. Sure you once made bad decisions under the control of a sociopathic, hedonistic cunt. But those weren’t of your own will. You are good. You are loving, and kind, and you care more about those around you then you do yourself. If that isn’t a difference in itself from who you were before, and no one else can see or appreciate that, then they don’t deserve you.” She stopped to really look at him. “But between you and me, I don’t think you’ll have that problem with Harry. Also, since when has he become Harry.” She laughed, changing the whole serious mood into a light-hearted one.
Draco didn’t have the chance to stand up and punch the guy off of himself, before he was pushed aside and the creep was thrown off of him. He whipped around to see the man pinned to the wall, Harry’s hand wrapped around his neck.
“No! Let me go! Harry, come back!” Malfoy screamed, as Harry ran up to his dorm. He could hear the blond screaming down in the common room, but didn’t care. Hermione began talking to him in hushed tones.
Harry didn’t look at Draco at all while he spoke. He either looked out at sea or down at the sand beneath him. When finished, he was out of breath.
"Me neither, but he's got nowhere else to stay, and I've got all of Grimmauld Place to myself. I thought I'd offer, seeing as the Manor is closed up and everything." He replied quickly. Hermione and Ron just continued to stare at him so he turned to the only other person in the hall. "So, umm, Draco, would you like to go? Do you have any clothes or anything?" He asked, suddenly nervous as his hand reached to scratch the back of his neck.
“Harry! No! Don’t let him! Harry! Save me! Please! He’s HURTING ME! HARRY!” Malfoy screamed, flailing his arms and legs, now being held in Snape’s grasp.
When he finally came up for air, Draco was hard, leaking, and panting from the exertion just made on his prick.
Harry nodded. But, he felt bad for the blond, in a way. Not being able to control what you said or did? That’s scary. Malfoy was going to be absolutely humiliated when he returned to normal. Oh well, you get what you deserve, right? Harry knew all about that.
"Because…you've already broken the Statute of Secrecy once this month." Draco said quickly. He tried to pull his hand away from Buckbeak's, but just ended up bringing Harry's hand with his. The boy, infuriatingly, didn't let go.
Looking at the letter addressed to his father, he was still unsure which side this came from and which side Umbridge herself was on.
the bloody house, within the room of none other than the late matriarch of one of the oldest pure-blood wizarding families in Britain.
He watched Draco run a hand through his hair, causing strands that shone silver in the wand light to cascade over his face. Draco blew out a long, drawn breath that sounded tired and haggard, and the shadows over his face made him look even more so.
"Pride is unbecoming." His mother used to say to him as a child, with a small, secret smile when his father wasn't in the room. Draco would smile back, but it was never returned after it disappeared off her face almost as if it had never happened. He never understood why, before he came to realise she never said things like that where his father could possibly hear, and the fact stayed with him tucked away for a very long time.
"What are you two on about?" Weasley asked almost exasperatedly before Draco left the room. He didn’t wait to hear Harry's reply, quickly walking to Charms with his chest feeling oddly tight.
“Tut, tut, I don’t seem to have made much of an impression yet,” she said, smiling down at his hand with a look of such maternity that it took all of Harry’s self-control not to bolt out of the room. That was his
" Harry finished, expecting raucous positive feedback at his joke. Instead he got Ron staring him with a sympathetic look on his face and a few people around him looking at him weirdly. He was pretty sure he saw Snape stop and stare at him in the corner of his eye.
The door opened a long mane of red hair appeared. "Watch out if Mum hears you say that" Said whom Draco assumed was the last Weasley, Ginevra. Draco shivered when he thought about what his father had done to her. "Oh, hello Harry!" She said, before her eyes landed on Draco. "Malfoy, as well." She said with a polite nod. Draco nodded back, reminding himself to talk to her later.  Ginevra looked back at the twins, "The Ears are a no-go."
Ron nodded and left, glancing at Harry over his shoulder once before he passed through the door. The dorm was empty except for Neville whom was desperately searching through his trunk for something. Not wanting to be pulled in to helping him find whatever it was the boy had lost, Harry quickly picked up his spare uniform and robes and went in to the showers.
Draco took an uneasy gulp, feeling discomfort from it because of how dry his mouth felt. "I know that. That's just another part of the plan."
"Alright, alright." Harry laughed, shaking his head and looking at Draco with the biggest smile on his face it almost made Draco turn red.
"Er, Ocular Replenishing Potion?" Harry tried to say confidently. Snape scowled, obviously disappointed he couldn't take more points off of Harry.
Draco got up along with them, hearing the scraping of chairs behind them as Sirius and Remus also got up to see Harry off. He followed Harry out the kitchen, hearing before he left the room from Tonks, "Oh, Arthur, by the way…" The man halted to listen to her, but the two continued on.
." Harry hissed, exiting the kitchen to see Draco freeze on the stairs with one leg in the air above the step in front of him. Once he saw the look on Harry's face, he broke in to a run.
It didn’t help with Umbridge’s class inspections, which were nothing short of distractions that only put him off his concentration and agitated him further. He also nearly had to leave the room during Defense one day that week, after Harry had landed himself in detention yet again for the same reason as last time. It only cost Draco every nail on his left hand after gnawing at them agitatedly and he could barely even glance at Harry the next few days out of pure anger. He didn’t even bother trying to speak to the boy, lest he lost control and bit his head off.
Draco was let go and pushed forwards to the opening of the room, Harry stepping back to let him through. The bird - Buckbeak - pulled it's head from where it was ensconced within the shelter of it's wings. It was a vulnerable, protective gesture and Draco gritted his teeth irritably, looking down on the creature through his nose in an attempt to stave off the glimmer of affection it instilled in him for the creature.
Maybe deep down he really had missed Hogwarts. It just certainly wasn’t shaping up to be an easy year on him, however.
“Of course.” Draco bit out monotonously, his mind running in so many different directions that he felt the conversation in front of him slipping to the back. “He’d be his own spy.”
