'He knew.  He told us, but we did it anyway.'  Harry began pacing in front of Hagrid's hut.  Madam Pomfrey and Professor McGonagall deciding that Harry needed to work through his rage before going in to see Draco.  'He is never going to forgive me.'
Only Malfoy had come back.  Pale and shaking and limping and so bloody quiet.  He wouldn't look at him, those grey eyes always staring at the floors.  He wouldn't look at anyone.
'No.'  Draco was quick to allay Harry's fears.  'Not once.  I can't explain it, Harry.  I don't understand it.  But this,' he dipped his eyes to the cloak, his hand buried within it's folds.  'It's so warm.  It feels like you.'
'My trunk?'  Draco blinked.
'Did someone hurt you?'
Harry had no place in mind, all he knew was that he couldn't bear to be around anyone at the moment.
If he just didn't look too closely at the empty chairs that littered the room, not listen to the laughter that never quite seemed to reach into every corner.  If he could just not look at Harry.  At the dark circles that surrounded his perpetually tired eyes, the age in his young face, the slump of his weary shoulders.
'Where...where did you get it?'  His voice little more than a faint whisper, his throat still desperately sore.
I'm going to clean you up, Draco.'  Harry told him, but still he held him close.  He didn't care about the vomit, the sweat and the urine soaking into his own clothes.  But Draco deserved to be clean and dry and safe once more.
Strange, how the memory came to him now.  Slipping past the forgotten years and breaking through the cracks left by so many more.
Dressed in what appeared to be only pyjamas, a book at his bare feet and his knees threatening to buckle beneath him.
He knew it was rude of him to keep pretending to sleep, the least he could do was to open his eyes and adknowlede her help and attention.  But he couldn't bring himself to meet her concerned gaze, and the sympathy he would see in her eyes.
'I...I've never...'  Draco whispered, slowly drawing back, his eyes dipping.  'Not...not properly.  U...unless...  There was a...a man.  He would...'  He hesitated, seeming to search for the words.  Harry knew what he could not say.
'I...I couldn't.'  Draco shook his head.
'Everything okay?'  Professor McGonagall asked gently as she stepped closer, seeing how pale Draco looked, how near to sleep he was, and how tightly Harry held him close.
Barefoot and crying.  Alone and clearly sick.  Standing in his common room, Ron had just watched Draco walk out of the door with the very same book all those weeks ago.  He could have done something then.  Talked to him, been kind.  But no, he had been too headstrong, too stupid and thoughtless to even ask.  And worse, so much worse, he had walked away when Draco had been so very hurt, so very sick.  A jagged piece of glass pressed to his arm.
Draco could only nod, if he spoke now he would surely tell him everything.  Staring into the flames, he covered Harry's hands with his own.
'It will be here.'  She said softly, watching as his trembling hands reached for the heavy door, yanking it open.
Harry had his arm tight around Draco's middle, the white of his grip betraying his fear.  Sheer will alone propelling them achingly slowly across the empty corridors and up the insurmountable staircases.  Often she cursed under her breath as they reached yet another one of those steep stone hills, seeing the pause Draco had to take, the breath he had to gulp before taking that first heavy footstep.
Minerva McGonagall smiled in pleasure at her two young charges, 'Gryffindor it is then.'
He turned to the still silent McGonagall.  'He stays with me.  If you send him away, then you also send me away.  I'll take him somewhere you won't be able to find us.  You are not doing this to him.  I'll not see him passed around like some unwanted pet.  Draco stays here.'
It wasn't real when he swallowed, when the suppurating wounds parted, blood, hot and cold and dark pooling on the stones, the stark sharpness of his every bone pressing against his pale flesh, eager to burst free.
Neville watched him walk away, head dipped, shoulders sagging under the weight of his betrayal.
It continued for so long that he was unable to count the days.  Night and day had no meaning here.  He had fallen from the world and all he knew was pain and suffering.
'I'm worried about you.'  She looked down to her hands, now lying empty on her lap.  'We both are.  Ron and I...'  Her tears were coming, Harry could hear them in the catch of her breath.
'Harry will not see it that way.'
Hagrid would fetch them all.  The three who had tirelessly put him back together in their own ways.
Perhaps it was time to retire, put those ghosts to bed once and for all.
'Hey.'  The green eyed boy spoke from the doorway.  He looked afraid, a look that Draco knew he had never seen on Potter before.  'You are awake.'
To forgive.
Often, Harry had thought back to that time, to that single moment when he had sent Voldemort into the eternal darkness.  He would look back and wonder if he had he the chance, would he do it all over again.  Would he draw his wand against a fellow wizard and condemn him to death?  Would he have that strength?
He might never hold the wand that sat in her office, patiently waiting in its simple box for him to come and take it for his own.
Draco nodded wordlessly, his palms digging deeply into his eyes.  Two months of being ignored, of grief and emptiness.  Of only having looks of pity from teachers who didn't know what to say, of only having Harry, only ever at night.  Only when everyone in the castle were asleep.  Two months of pretending.
Nott's face twisted into a scowl, watching the exchange between the young boy and the old man.
'Well, we will have to cross that bridge if and when we come to it.'  She nodded, defiant.  'Why don't we take him somewhere, the kitchens perhaps, or the Library.  Somewhere quiet, where we can't get interrupted.  And we will listen, we will let him talk, and tell us what really happened with Malfoy.  And what we can do to help, to move forward.'  She smiled, and breaking her own rule against ostentatious shows of affection, her lips briefly met his in a stolen kiss.  'Now, go and get us some more of that Wormwood Essence before this cauldron boils over.'
'Off you go, my boy.'  His hand was a heavy weight on his back, urging him forward into the rushing crowds of students all eager and wanting to get to the Great Hall.   'You mustn't be late.  You need a good meal inside of you.'
Panic washed over him, drowning waves that coloured the floor in stinging bile, a mirror into the place he would never forget, never be rid of.
He felt that surprising hand suddenly tighten in his hair.  It hurt, it tried to break the nightmares.
'Let me see.'  Harry said quietly, looking at the arm Draco had hidden from his sight.  Foregoing the hard chair, He sat on the bed, holding out his hand expectantly.
Forever, the scars were his forever.
'No, it's...it's okay.'  He shook his head, forced a tight smile.  'I'm sure the whole school will soon know what happened tonight anyway.  It is only right that you hear it from me first.'
His sleep was snatched in increments.  An hour or two when he should have been in the Library, a skipped meal.  A moment when Draco closed his own heavy eyes.  He would sleep later.
'Just tell me that you are okay.  That is all I want to hear.'
'I can't think about anything.  I...I don't deserve him.'  Unwanted tears clouded his vision.  Crying again, he thought sadly.  When would he be done with these infernal tears?  He was a Malfoy, and Malfoy's didn't cry.  Not in public anyway.  Tears were meant to be hidden, were for closed doors and boys who couldn't cope.  'He's...he is too good for the likes of me.'
'You don't have to tell me anything, Draco.  It is entirely up to you.  I don't mean to pry.'
'I'm not going to Hex you, Ron.  I was wrong earlier.  You were right, I haven't been telling you the truth, and I'm sorry about that.  But there is no fault here, there isn't anyone to blame.  Draco hasn't done anything wrong.'
'Me?'
It was late, and Harry Potter couldn't sleep.
'It's for the best.'  Draco whispered, 'And H...H...  Potter will realise that.'
Harry kicked off his shoes, swung his legs up onto the bed beside Draco.  He didn't ask if this was okay anymore.  It was their way now, it was how they slept.
Made to look into those soulless eyes and cry.  Sob as pain raced up his spine, as he felt his unwilling flesh tear and accept this sickening intrusion.  As his innocence was wrenched from him, never to feel the same again.
'Yeah, hot water.'
Harry gently pulled him into the alcove, urged him up against the hard wall.  And just as he had thought moments ago, Draco was relieved to see that the tapestry did indeed offer further protection.
'You knew.'  Milly's whip crack voice was like a death knell crashing over him.  'You did, didn't you?'  She asked the question Greg had dreaded ever since Draco had returned to the school, a haunted shell of the boy they had all known so well.  Finally, he had been discovered in his torturous treachery.  'That's why you told Theo to leave him alone, why you were so adamant.'  She set her hands on her hips, her eyes dark and dangerous in the dim light they hid behind.  'Oh, it all makes sense now.'  She spat, her ire growing by the moment.  'All this time.  You knew, and you kept it quiet. Like the filthy secret it became.'
'We...'  He watched her throat as she swallowed heavily.  She spoke again, softer now, afraid of the anger still behind his emerald eyes.  'We are now going.  Are...  Are you still coming with us?'
The second was Neville.  Harry had woken late in the night to the soft sound of crying coming from Neville's bed.  Not about to roll over and go back to sleep, Harry had gotten up, climbed in beside the crying boy and given him a sleepy hug.  It was the anniversary of the day Neville's parents had fallen foul of Bellatrix.
He turned to Draco with a smile.  'All finished.  You ready for me to pick you up again?'
Officially Harry could now add a fourth.
Those lies spilling from that twisted mouth, sly and grinning.  Glittering eyes in a spiteful face.  Enjoying every second of the torment he inflicted.  Watching Draco's eyes fill with unwanted tears, helpless under the might of his cruelty.
His face wore a convincing smile, and he interacted with his friends easily, a laugh never far from his lips.  But there was something hidden, a hurt that he had buried deep.  His usually quick reactions a fraction slower, his hands minutely shaky, his bright eyes clouded.
'Hermione...  Please.'  Harry sobbed.  'Don't do this.'
'Harry?'  Professor McGonagall touched his shoulder lightly, wrenching him back to all surrounded them, and to the way Draco still shivered.  'Let's get you both to wherever it is you want to go.'
The thirst, the infection and agony.  The scars and the dying tremors.  The mess on his thighs, the fingertip bruises.  The obvious reasons.  The violent rape and the ruthless claiming.
Now that everyone had turned from the breaking chaos of the corridor, all eyes were lighting on him.  Glaring and obvious, murmuring and stealthy, they all wanted to snatch a look at the person the Saviour had almost strangled in front of them.
But...  It was important to Draco.
He wanted the fire.  Even if he wasn't prepared to sit beside its warmth.  Someone might catch him there after all.  But he still wanted its distant heat, the light the flames brought.  Picking up his treasured book and tucking it carefully under his arm, he made for the common room.
'I think after everything that has happened, McGonagall wants this year's season to be a memorable one.'  He bit down on the corner of his toast, trying at least to make the effort in front of his friends.  'I was going over old tactics, looking at the form of players, that kind of thing.  It's not all her fault, Hermione, I got caught up in it.'  Harry lied to their faces.
'That's right.'  A slippery smile, a wet touch.  So close.  'Look at what you have become.  They would be so very ashamed of you, darling boy.  You are learning.'  Snake eyes fixed themselves on the dark figures behind Draco.  'Again.'  His terrible instruction barked.
So many voices, too many curious stares.
In the distance he could see the enormous dog sitting beside a white mound, his head thrown back in anguish, crying into the night air.  The moonlight that permeated the thick trees did little to disclose what the indistinct shape could possibly be.  Far too small to be an injured Unicorn or Centaur, Hagrid got closer.
'I...I'm sorry.'  Draco knew that Filch couldn't send him back to his bed, he didn't have one any longer.  'I didn't...couldn't...'  he stood, suddenly mute, the bile rising once more.  He had nowhere to go, and this caretaker wasn't as stupid as they all liked to think.  He had sense, he had been here long enough to know when he was being lied to.  'I...'
'It's too cold to be hanging around out here.'  He took in the sight of Draco's thin jacket, claimed from lost property, a thin, threadbare scarf wrapped uselessly around his neck.  'Come in, the kettle is almost boiled, I'll make us a brew.  How does that sound?'  The giant gently touched his shoulder, smiling through that great fuzzy beard of his.
A flash of a wand, a muttered curse that cracked bones.  That man surged forward, broke away from the rest.  He was laughing now, laughing down at the person Draco had become, raising that terrible wand once more.
It was knowing he would never pass his exams, no matter how long he stayed within Hogwarts solid walls.  He would never be able to cast the most simple of spells, it was knowing that never again would he be able to complete an essay or an assignment.  It was the hard reality that he would never be good enough.
'Don't say it so loud!'  He hissed at her, his eyes raking the faces of those surrounding them for any sign of attentive shock.  Finding nothing but students intent on there breakfast plates, he turned to her.  'Harry's not himself.  He's not well.'
She hated that word.  Hated it with a passion that flared brightly in her chest.  To think that, to use that to describe a young boy who had only just touched adulthood, one of her students, one of her own.
There was one particular night he recalled with clarity.  Saw it in his dreams, knew that they had all been a part of something that could never be understood, never be forgiven.
'It's what I did.'  Harry said softly.  'I killed someone.'
Now school had become nothing more than hiding at the back of each and every class, waiting for the teacher to declare the lesson over.  Knowing that his mind would continue to fail him, knowing that the eyes of everyone around him held curiosity and thinly veiled contempt.
'Look!'  Hagrid pointed as Draco's lips parted.  He looked like he was fighting for breath.  'I told you, he's awake.'
'Quiet.'  McGonagall told him.  'So very quiet.'
He tried to open his eyes, aware of a light but unable to summon the strength required to part his heavy eyelids.  This was not like any dream he'd had in the Cell.  Those were cruel, promising him the world, but only delivering the darkness, the cold, the vicious punishments.
They hated each other.  Everyone knew that.
'H...H...?'  That voice was back again.  The agony had stopped, for now at least, leaving an ache that was easy in comparison.
'If anyone can convince Draco that residing in Gryffindor Tower is a good idea, it is Harry.'
'To the life I was meant to have.  An ending to all of the things my parents wished for me to achieve.  A good job, a person to love, a life lived with happiness, without fear.  They wanted so much for me.  I was the only child they could have.  Mother wanted more, but it wasn't to be.  So all of their focus and hopes went into me.  Father was strict, but not cruel.  He wanted me to be the best, at school, at everything.  Mother, she spoiled me.'  Draco smiled softly at the memory.  'I was a brat, but I...I thought I could have it all.'
'Ssh, it's okay.'  Harry soothed, running his hand over Draco's hair.  It worked, the body in his arms stilled, finding comfort in Harry's few words.  Draco trusting him implicitly.  Harry couldn't think about that, not now.  When this was all over, he would think about it then.  Think about the way Draco clung to him, his fragile arms holding him as tightly as they would allow, his head on his shoulder, his body pressed close to him.  Later.  Much, much later.
Nott never believed that it would all come down to this.
He had come to fear each and every one of those wands more than anything else they could imagine for him.
The rubber bottle would not hold its heat for long, but still he carried it over to his bed and laid it upon the neat covers.  He never quite caught the Charm Harry would often use to heat the water inside, a Charm that would last for days and days.  But not the week.  It had never been left that long before.
'That's enough!'  Harry was there, grabbing at Ron's shoulder with considerable force.  'Leave him alone.'
'Erm, Professor?'  He stopped by the open door.  'I'm afraid I am slightly early.'  He hitched his fraying bag higher up his shoulder, ever mindful that the strap was close to breaking point.  He should wait in the corridors, it was only fair to the uncomfortable Potions Master.  But he was cold, needed to sit himself into a chair.
'Even the perfect Gryffindor's couldn't stand you around, Malfoy.  Even they saw through the act you've got going on.  You sold your family for your own freedom, my father is being held prisoner, your own friends died.  All because you were too weak to do as you should, to fight with them.  Where were you when they needed you?  When they were dying.  You turned your back against us,  Malfoy, worshipping under the robes of Snape.  You disgust me.'
There was that voice again.  Calmer this time, and with a touch to his shoulder.  Warm and forgiving in the face of all he had wrought this horrible day.
And it was wrong.
With a racing heart Draco caught the flash of black hair, the glint of the growing sun catching on the edge of glasses.
'It wasn't luck.  I w...was his plaything.  He didn't want me dead, he wanted to consume me, own me.  I was his toy.'  A sob tore its way from his throat.  'I...I still am.'
'I'm sorry.'  Hargrid murmured, his own tears held back.  He tried to hold the boy gently, tried to lessen the pain.  But it was beyond his control.
But it wasn't Harry.
The crushing weight of the night pulled at him as his eyes closed, Draco's quiet voice lulling him to sleep.
After the deafening silence, came the noise.
Ron's eyebrows rose in surprise, a hesitant smile quirking his mouth.  'Do...'  He stammered, coughing into his fist.  'Harry...  Do...  Do you want a game?'  He asked, hope flaring in his too bright eyes.
'I... didn't, didn't want to believe it.'  Greg stuttered, staring at the floor, too ashamed to meet the icy glare of his friends.  'I...  I heard things.  Horrible things.  But...  But how could it have been possible?  I didn't understand, I don't think I wanted to understand any of it.'  His voice grew weak as his tears came.  Swiping at his face, he struggled to find any words that would help tell of his fear, his impossible choices.  And his raging guilt.  'It...  It was Draco.  And...'  He sobbed, finally breaking under the weight of all he had known.  'And our own families.  They...  they did that.  And...  I let it happen.'
'It's not your fault.'
There would be no hesitation in his action, there would be no regret, no confusion or second thoughts.
The ink pooled against Harry's shoes as he pressed through the silent crowds.  Pushing against the wall of shock, the stillness.  Shattered glass and empty paper under his feet.
'I see you.'  He hissed, too quiet for the teacher to notice.  'I know what you are.'  His face closer now, his mouth at Malfoy's ear.  'And soon enough, everyone will know what you are.'
'I'm fine.'  Draco told him again, managing a watery smile.
He might run.  Just as he had begged Harry to do.  He might run so far that Harry would lose him altogether.
'Y...Yes.'  He licked up the drops again.
'I...'  Draco's voice caught in his throat.  He wasn't good for Harry, it wasn't fair to put him through this.  He needed to keep pushing at him, push him away, make him realise that he was a horror, a shit and not deserving of his dear friendship.  Swallowing heavily, swallowing around the lump lodged in his throat.  'I shouldn't have said it, it was wrong of me, cruel.'
'It's all right, Harry.'  Draco reassured him.  'It was going to happen eventually.'
Draco had grown to hate the memory.  There would be no grand saviour from the pages of an asinine book.  There would never be a dashing hero to scoop him off the floor and carry him to safety. He quickly discovered that his father had been right in his derision of his mother's pastime.
This was someone new.  Someone terrifying.
Spells, incantations, they had no effect.  Draco was trapped in his nightmares, his head thrashing wildly, his eyes rolling, but no closer to waking.
Draco allowed the worry to fade, leaning his head back against Harry's shoulder, his body relaxing into him.
'Draco, no.  You should be in bed.  You'll catch cold.'  Harry's voice resisted, but his body didn't.  Sinking willingly into the comforting embrace, his own arms rising, holding on to the fragile boy before him.
'Too...too loud.'  Draco murmured, his face pressed into Harry's neck.
He lived for Harry's visits.  For that kind smile that still seemed embarrassed, despite all he had already done for Draco.  Washed him, cleaned up his mess, fed him.  Seen him in all his shame, in all his stark agony.
'He won't.'  Madam Pomfrey stood, straightening her skirts.  'It took an age to make him return to his House this morning.  Harry wants to be with you, Draco.  Don't try and push him away.  I believe it would be more than he could bear.'
But what if this particular box contained a picture of Dumbledore within it's folds?  The thought almost made him return the Frog to it's original place.  His present would instantly become a cruel reminder,  wrenching him back to the past.  Would Draco think Harry meant to cause him pain?  Would he think Harry had done it on purpose?  Undoing all they had achieved together.
Some were unfamiliar, thankfully.  And some were not.  He wasn't meant to leave, wasn't expected to live.  Masks had been forgotten, faces were remembered.  Eyes that climbed into his body and stole his life.
'No.'
At first he had dismissed it.  They had needed it, they both needed the way they would wrap themselves around each other without a word being passed between them.  How they would sleep, chasing away each others nightmares.  How they would always wake slowly, curled up so close.
Known with one look at the thin, shaking boy that the whispers were true.
There was nothing left.  Only the bad memories of this place, of the man standing over him, swathed in black and demanding everything.  What had been the point in fighting to survive for all this time?
Broken.
'Don't even begin to tell me how sorry you are right now, Neville.  You have no idea how fucking sorry I'm going to be when I now have to go to him and tell him that every single person in that room,' he jabbed his finger towards the closed doors of the Great Hall.  'Every single one of them has his name on their fucking lips!  I've got to find a way of telling him that he is out of time.  They will come looking, do you realise that?  Nobody will be happy until Draco is seen.'
'My sweet prince.  My darling boy.  I came back, for you.'  It stepped closer, robes billowing, face twisting, settling into its final monstrous shape.
'I...I didn't...'  Draco stammered, making Nott grin.
'Yeah.'  Harry answered, forcing his voice to work, hoping that it didn't sound like he had been crying for most of the night.
Wands and Curses.  Spells and Hexes.
'Just knowing I have it is enough.'  Draco told her.  'I want what's best for him, and I am not that.'
“I know,” Draco smirked.
Draco knew to keep quiet, knew it wasn’t his place to question the men and women who were doing everything in their power to keep him and his family safe, but he couldn’t help the annoyed huff that escaped his lips as the house rocked for the seventh time that day.
“Did you mean what you said, Hermione? You think Draco and I make sense?”
“Mrs. Malfoy, I don’t think you understand—” the head auror began, face clouding over at her insinuation of his incompetency.
Harry sighed. “Look, Draco, I didn’t mean…” And there was that worried mouth and those troubled eyes. Draco missed the happiness. “Please don’t take this the wrong way. I meant it when I said I want more with you. It’s just—”
Draco glared at her but she only leveled him with a look that reminded him why they had to play nice. That reminded Draco he was trying to
“Get your lazy arse out of my bed.”
“I know,” Harry replied.
“So you haven’t succeeded,” she stated. Draco sank further in his chair. Now that he was more mature, trying for the first time in his life not to be a total prat, he realized how awful his family could sound at times. And he knew from experience that more often than not they weren’t trying to insult anyone. They just had been raised by parents who spoke the same way, who never considered anyone’s feelings outside their own small circle. He glanced over at Potter in his embarrassment, hoping to convey that he really wasn’t like that anymore, but Potter wasn’t looking back at him. All the better – what did he care what Potter thought of him?
“What else do you want?” he whispered in Draco’s ear, hitting a spot Draco had never reached before.
“Good.”
Draco felt stubble beneath his mouth, tasted the lingering trace of his own toothpaste. He felt Harry’s nose bump into his, and heard the soft sounds of their lips.
Harry joined him on the floor. “Sorry I didn’t tell you.”
Draco looked up and saw a polite yet guarded expression on the other’s face.
Only a handful of people were privy to Harry’s happiness. Draco had watched those people walk arm-in-arm down the Hogwarts hallways. He’d heard them laugh from across the Weasley joke shop. He had seen them share stories that made Harry’s eyes light up, and share hugs that made his eyes go soft.
“Shut up and fuck me,” Draco demanded.
“Oh you’re not late. I’ve just let your team know that there’s breakfast in the dining room, so please do join us when you’re able.”
“Wha- what?” Draco responded, unable to think properly with the pleasure that was racking through his body.
And Draco dared himself to be bold.
“He is nice,” he agreed.
“Yes,” he echoed. Draco reached up to bite down on his shoulder. “That is, if you’re saying…” Potter rolled his hips down in an imitation of what they were about to do, confirming what exactly Draco had in mind. Their cocks brushed and as mind-numbingly good as it felt, Draco wanted it to move a little lower.
Harry shrugged. “Probably some kid trying to sell chocolates door-to-door or something.”
“Aren’t Slytherin’s into breaking the rules?”
Then he heard the noise again, and his eyes flew open.
have spare bedrooms, and Mother always
, after what they had just done together. “I just… this isn’t me.”
Potter gave her a winning smile, the same one Draco had seen him use on professors and reporters. Undeniably appealing, undeniably fake. “Thank you, Mrs. Malfoy. You’ve been so generous tonight. And I have high hopes for tomorrow, I’m sure we finish up today’s work in a matter of short hours.”
“Shut up,” Draco grumbled. “You’re just as rich as me, Boy Wonder.”
“What?” he replied. It meant more than
“That’s nice. Why are you doing that?” Teddy asked, focusing on Potter’s hair now. He didn’t seem to mind.
He felt a reassuring pat on his knee, and for the first time in a long time, Draco was happy to be Narcissa Malfoy’s son.
“I’m sorry, we—we should have owled,” she said, and Harry realized with sudden clarity that she was
Narcissa pursed her lips. “Not asleep yet, are you?”
“I’m um, I’m supposed to take Teddy to the zoo today, and well, he was really excited to see you, and I know he wouldn’t want you to go away so soon, but you probably have work to do anyway, but if you don’t—”
Draco swallowed, and bowed his head graciously, with all the ease of his blue blood.
Harry Potter was standing in his hall.
For his part, Potter grabbed Draco’s arse, following Draco’s lead by squeezing it only once before tucking both of his hands under the waistband and pulling down. His newfound nudity made the brush of borrowed silk Potter was wearing agonizingly delicious against his cock, and he didn’t even care if he ruined his own pajamas by leaking all over them.
“I’ll meet you at the train station, then,” Harry said, ignoring the question. He moved to walk back into the great hall, then turned over his shoulder. “Tell Teddy I’m looking forward to our first date.”
, was he going to be forced to say it?
All of him was laid bare before Draco, from those green eyes so much darker than Draco had ever seen them, to that spot between his legs that Draco couldn’t look away from – the curve of his cock.
Wanting him right back.
“That’s good.” They were still staring at each other, and Draco didn’t know if he was supposed to turn away or not. He settled on not. “Congrats on your acceptance,” he said, gesturing to the group of aurors. Not that the department could ever deny the man who had defeated one of the most feared wizards of all time. Still, he was being polite. And guarded.
He walked back to the hall, where the aurors were still all paused for their own lunch, eating out of containers. Potter was sitting one step too far from them, making it apparent he hadn’t quite bonded with the others yet. This would make the question easier to ask.
, he thought, and then chided himself again for wishing it.
“Darling?” His mother’s eyes were sharp and her mouth just as lethal. Her expression said
Draco turned back to see Harry was still lying in his bed. He grabbed his shirt from the floor and threw it, hitting Harry right in the face. He tried to set his features to convey something like
“I’ll have you know my flat is
Howlers that crashed through windows with the force of their aggression. Jinxes that made the whole house shake. Hexes that poured ash through the walls. And on two very memorable and very terrifying occasions, thieves that apparated right into their dining room and trashed the place.
Harry smiled as he heard Draco muttering all the way down the hall, complaining about “bothersome gits” and “sad lonely fucks” and “I’ve got a wand and I’m not afraid to—”
But the thought of Potter staying under his roof made his stomach twist. It wasn’t even that, really. The thought of Potter walking through his
” he growled into Draco’s neck.
Harry caught him by the arm. Draco turned, looking first at Harry’s hand, then up at his face. He was wide-eyed and blushing still, and Harry gently spun him around until the two were side by side, facing Ron and Hermione.
“Potter,” he whispered.
Movement drew his eye away, and he saw the aurors were all sharing glances as they shuffled their feet, looking to one another for confirmation of their choice. This time when Draco looked at Potter, he caught his eye. Only for the briefest of seconds, green meeting gray, and then Potter looked away, swallowing visibly.
And as Hermione bit messily into a raspberry truffle, and as Ron got up to find himself a drink from the sidebar, and as Harry relayed the story of his first date with Draco, and as Ron complained
“Watch it!” Harry complained.
“Am I—oh fuck—am I as good as they say I am?”
“Harry!” Teddy exclaimed, delighted to see Potter in the doorway. His godfather went over and scooped the little guy up, much as Draco had done earlier. He stayed in the doorway, watching. “Why are you here?”
Draco nodded, sharp and short. He hadn’t considered that Potter had an opinion on his new life choices. Somehow his approval made something gnaw at his chest. He ignored it.
“Mmm,” Harry said, pulling away. “Let me… just…” He tapped his wand to his watch, and the huff of sparks stopped. When he turned back to Draco his grin was goofy, and Draco had to stop himself from thinking something stupid and mushy and very un-Malfoy-like. “Good morning,” Harry said.
its occupants rather than arrest them. Mere curiosity, that’s what had held Draco’s attention all day.
The two had… not quite made
“Sure,” Harry said easily. “I’ve got to fly back with the aurors, but I can meet you at the floos on the edge of the city in an hour or so.”
Draco watched his mother give him a kind pat on the shoulder, and then she turned and left the room, closing the door behind her.
nice. He sighed, and smiled.
It was only when they walked into the dining room together that Draco remembered his shame. They had not been quiet the previous night, and seeing his table surrounded by aurors reminded him to feel that familiar friend
Except, of course, this was
. But he hadn’t elaborated, and Harry was still unconvinced.
“I—what?—Har—oh—” Draco stuttered. He was past the point of embarrassment now, but thankfully Harry seemed just as delirious even under his frustratingly coherent speech.
The fireplace crackled in tandem with their cards, and Harry couldn’t believe his luck. How cozy and warm he felt in this drafty old flat, how safe and seen. Valentine’s was going better than expected.
, seeing the things that Draco had grown up with that had made him
He made quick work of Draco’s shirt until he was laying naked under the boy who’d occupied so much of his attention for so long. His younger self might never have imagined this exact scenario, but he’d known from that first auspicious meeting that he’d never be satisfied unless Potter was in his life causing trouble.
He was right though. It was now well-dark outside, and Draco could see his own constellation appearing through the grand window. This was clearly going to be a two-day job.
“God Malfoy, you feel so good,” he whispered. The sound Draco released was unholy, and Potter only pushed harder in response, adding a third finger. “So pretty laid out like this.” A rough and calloused hand pushed through his blonde hair, and Draco hated to admit how the gesture was hotter than anything else that had happened that night. Potter must have noticed, because then his hand was wrapping around a lock and tugging, and Draco frantically clutched at his shoulders, digging his nails in just to release some of the pressure building inside of him.
“You can’t stay in that chair all night,” Potter pointed out, still looking anywhere but back at him. He yawned.
Draco felt those golden wings take flight in his chest, and he forced them down. He would
The Malfoys had been dealt a better hand than some, after the War. Lucius had been sent to Azkaban, yes, but Narcissa and Draco were sentenced with two years community service. No prison time. Draco had spent it volunteering at the Muggle Center in Hogsmeade. For two years his unpaid labor involved filing wand applications for squibs, charting unusual magical activity in muggle households, scheduling Hogwarts scouts to confirm the abilities of young muggleborn children, and all other business related to the frayed and tense liminal space between their world and his.
“Well. All the guest rooms are full and I thought since you and Harry are closest in age, he might share your room tonight?”
“Of course, not a problem,” he murmured. His eyes found Potter’s, and they were impossible to read.
and sometimes something like
It wasn’t long before he drifted off to sleep.
He pushed the thought away, focusing on the present as he listened to his mother and his aunt fuss over a benefit they had agreed to support. Teddy was watching just as attentively, with a face so unlike any of theirs. A face that was round and soft, lacking any trace of Black angularity. Russet brown hair that Draco had seen turn red a couple of times, big eyes that were kind and trusting.
, after all. But slowly, he’d started mingling with those familiar faces he’d scorned for so long. When he ran into Justin Finch-Fletchey at a bar four years ago, he’d stayed for a conversation and even bought the other man a drink. When his co-worker invited him as a plus-one to The Quibbler’s annual Yule Ball the following year, he’d spent a surprisingly-pleasant evening befriending Luna Lovegood. Two years ago he’d been sent the invitation directly, to the Patils’ summer garden party, where he made awkward but efficient conversation with Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan. And for the past year he’d been a regular presence at Neville Longbottom’s intimate dinner parties.
Then Potter was thanking the auror and turning away, walking straight toward Draco. He barely had time to adjust his posture, slouching into an uninterested bored pose, before Potter was upon him. Their eyes met briefly, and Draco raised an eyebrow, before Potter turned toward the window. He looked back down at his manual, then drew his wand and uttered a curse too low for Draco to identify. A thin stream of pink emanated from the tip of his wand, lining along the windowpane like glue. Then it vanished. Potter smiled.
“But you make perfect sense,” she followed.
“Yes,” he parroted back. His back was arched, his hands clutching at his sheets, his legs were spread and his hole was only inches from Potter’s cock. How much more obvious did he need to be?
. Not a
He saw three eyebrows rise.
“You wish we hadn’t? You—”
“That would be very kind,” the head auror said, accepting his mother’s offer. She smiled pleasantly, then invited them to the salon when they were ready.
“We didn’t want you to be alone, mate,” Ron finished.
So he stayed on. He’d been working at the Center for four years now, ever since the end of his trial. And he’d been trying, really trying, to be a better version of himself. The version of himself he might have been if he hadn’t been raised a Malfoy, if he hadn’t surrounded himself with the children of his father’s friends, if he hadn’t grown up with so singular a perspective. The kind of young man he might be if he’d talked to a muggleborn at any point in the eighteen years of life before his second one started.
It was Andromeda’s suggestion (and likely her influence) that brought Draco to the situation currently facing him: a room full of aurors in the great hall. His mother had politely appealed to the department for assistance, and with the persuasion and pockets of a Black, she had succeeded in securing their help. Monday morning, and a small team was gathered in the Manor, prepared to protect their house from spells and intrusions. Even the Malfoy name wasn’t enough to deter them, and it was quite obvious the department had sent over some of its best witches and wizards. And a trainee. One trainee. One
Draco smiled back and hoped he didn’t look as smitten. “Good morning.”
been so long since she’d a friend to charm. And Draco could certainly see the appeal from the aurors’ perspective – a night in luxury had to be preferable to a flight through the countryside back to London in the cold night wind, not to mention a return trip in the morning.
“Get me a shirt, will you?” Harry asked.
and there was a knock at his door.
Still, despite Draco's gradual acceptance back into the society he’d once tried to destroy, the Malfoys were subject to their fair share of vitriol. He and his mother haunted the Manor, a cold and empty place whose happiness came in fits and spurts, most often when Aunt Andromeda would visit with the grubby little Teddy. Even their presence, though, was not enough to keep the attacks at bay.
Why flying lizards? They belong to the Draco genus :)
His mother sighed from the door to the hallway that lead toward the kitchen. She had changed since Draco had last seen her; now she was wearing a simple silk sheath under a heavier green robe, delicately inlaid with gold stitching. Beautiful even still, his mother.
And then he remembered Harry Potter was in the same bed as him.
“You can hang that in the closet,” Draco instructed, flat, even. He was trying not to think about how bizarre this scenario was: his childhood rival in his childhood home. Himself, disgraced and at his mercy, Potter with the inarguable upper hand.
you git!” Draco snapped.
“I promise I didn’t invite anybody or order anything today,” Harry insisted.
He didn’t really care about the knock or who had made it. The fire was dancing across Draco’s flushed face and the alcohol was swimming through his veins and he was deliriously happy. When he leaned in Draco’s lips were warm under his, and then a tongue was slipping in his mouth and hands were threading through his hair and his own were pushing up Draco’s jumper and—
He heard something scuffle against the nightstand, and then Harry spoke. “It’s half past four.” He was still draped over Draco, the weight of him soothing and warm.
Somehow, it didn’t bring Draco any panic. Maybe it was something about the way Potter was acting. Casual, like their coupling wasn’t as sensationally stupid as Draco knew every single person in the wizarding world would see it. Serious though, like he wasn’t taking Draco lightly. Like maybe he was trying to savor the sensationalism.
“Er, let me grab an extra toothbrush,” Draco said. He closed the door softly behind him, walking through the darkened but so-familiar hallway that led to the large closet of linens and hygiene products. He grabbed the first one he found – Gryffindor red, he belatedly noticed – and headed back to his room.
“Who’s here?” Teddy asked, sticking his hands in Draco’s hair. Instinct brought his own hands up to swat the offending ones away, and he only caught himself just in time.
Harry smiled, big and easy. “Of course.”
“Good morning Mr. Potter,” Narcissa called from behind it.
He was so close, green eyes too bright behind those stupid round glasses, the one thing that hadn’t changed in Draco’s life as he grew from a pompous little brat to a less-pompous man.
“It wasn’t a nightmare?” Potter shook his head. His eyes were boring into Draco’s, and in them Draco saw every challenge over dueling wands. Every glare over opposing brooms. Every lingering stare over glasses of butterbeer and over the shoulders of laughing friends and at the side of the dancefloor when they were the last two not dancing.
“What are you gonna tell everyone? About how pretty your blonde hair looks in my fingers, your gray eyes when they’re looking up at me.”
Potter leaned down, lips heading for Draco’s, and at the last moment Draco turned away, Potter’s lips finding Draco’s jaw instead. If he thought anything of it he didn’t say, merely followed Draco’s lead as he grinded his hips down, thighs splayed indecently on either side of him.
My first HP fic :) I haven't read the books in... ten years, maybe? So forgive me if the characterization and speech patterns are fucked.
Still, he could see Harry’s grin. “Oh? Well look at you, Mr.
“Draco, darling?” his mother asked.
Last year he’d been fresh from his breakup with Ginny, and he’d eaten his bodyweight in chocolates.
opinion was the most important.
“You know, places like Hogwarts are so well-protected because they’ve had centuries of spells cast and recast. Scores of different wands throwing those spells, not just a small handful. Not just a lifetime of security established in a single day,” she explained, perceptive and answering the exact question Draco hadn’t been bold enough to ask.
Draco cleared his throat, already throwing open his wardrobe and searching for a pressed shirt. “Yes, mother,” he replied.
It was quick after that.
“C’mon, Golden Boy,” Draco whispered back. “Are you really as good as they say you are?”
trainee.
like…” He trailed off, not needing to finish the sentence.
Potter had changed, the shine of his pajamas reflecting the moonlight in rippling waves. He was standing by Draco’s desk, looking intently at the moving photographs. He picked one up, and Draco swallowed when he recognized the frame.
“Well,” his mother continued, stepping into the great hall. The gold in her robe shimmered under the candles in the chandelier. Draco had charmed them himself one summer – they burned rose gold instead of yellow. It cast the room in a perpetual summer twilight. “As long as you’re here tomorrow morning I am satisfied. But I thought I’d extend the offer. The Manor is, as you’re well-aware, quite large. And although family is staying with us we have more than enough room for the bunch of you. I have digestifs in the salon, and a warm fire in every spare bedroom. If you’d rather stay here for the night it would be no bother at all.”
“Don’t be,” Hermione replied. “God knows you could use some privacy.”
He walked over to his desk, where stacks of papers were reminding him of the work he should have been doing today. Could he blame himself, though, for his curiosity? It wasn’t every day a group of aurors dropped by the home of a Death Eater rotting away in Azkaban and tried to
His stomach ached with a twisting sickness, a raw pain that swallowed him.  His legs so suddenly weak that he had to hold onto the ledge for support.  His eyes burned, his throat dry.
'Tell him...'  Hermione swallowed a growing sob, her breath catching as she too followed McGonagall's sad stare.  'Tell them, that I'm sorry.'
'Be brave, Draco.'  She had whispered, her mask already turned from him, her head seeming to dip lower.  Surely she could not be sad for him, the very notion unthinkable. 'You cannot hope to survive what the Dark Lord commands of you.'  Her pronouncement stained with unspoken regret.
'Draco...  Don't.'
This one right here, dying under his choking hold.  The one who had brought all that pain, that suffering to the place where there had only been a harmless cupboard full of long forgotten brooms and rusting empty buckets.  Didn't he deserve to die as much as the rest?
'Don't.'  Draco whispered, his eyes filling for all to see.  'Please.'
We both know it was time for me to go.  I stayed too long, and for that I will forever be sorry for all the pain I have caused you.
Had McGonagall been paying closer attention, had her steps not been so labored and her eyes cast to the floor, she might have caught sight of a boy, alone now.  Huddled tightly against a wall, waiting for his chance.  A striped scarf wound around his neck, a fidget in his feet.
'At the moment, no.  Draco is trying to protect him.  It turns out that our folly in revealing Draco's return has had a detrimental effect in Harry's life away from Mr Malfoy.  I have been made aware that Potter has fallen out of friendship with Mr Longbottom.  His school work is deteriorating, his sleep is being affected.  It is only a matter of time before the boy breaks entirely.  Our duty lies with our students, Poppy.  I will not see a single one of them suffer needlessly.'
His hand felt cold where Harry had once held it.  His legs beginning to shake.
'Harry...'  He began, realising instantly that there were no words to say to ease the ache Harry must be feeling.  Nothing to be said that could possible help.
Draco.  Laughing.
Its pale skin had grown thin, its limbs weak, broken.  Patches of once blond hair spattering a bloody scalp, torn fingernails and a blooded back...
'It's not only Quidditch, Harry.'  Ron snapped, unaware of their attentive, silent audience.  'It's everything!'  He moved, began to pace the room.  'Everything has changed, everything is horrible.  I didn't even want to come back this year, not really.  But I followed you.  I thought, well, if you can do it, if you and Hermione can come back after everything, then maybe it won't be so bad.  I thought it would be the same, all right!  I though we could go back to being normal.  But...but it's not the same.'  His feet carrying him across the threadbare rugs and back again.  'You are my best friend, Harry.  My very best.  But it's like you are not even here anymore.  And when you are, you are distant.  Like, like you always want to be someplace else.  You didn't even bother to come home for Christmas.'
He was on his feet, shaking the hand of his headmistress aside.  His wand already finding its place in his hand..  'What...?'  He could hear his own heartbeat pounding away in his chest.  'What is that?'  Not again, not now.  The War was over, they had won.  But that screaming...  So very much like that last day.
The boy almost died that starless night.  Almost.
Even the most hardened amongst them could not fail to wince at the sound of the boy's pelvis cracking under that cruel, brutal body.
'Can I come with you?'  Harry whispered his question.
Theo didn't need to fear for Draco.  No one did.
'You are the saviour, Harry.'  Draco said softly.  'You cannot change that, and neither should you.'
So many people were so very near, all he had to do was call out, raise his voice and every pair of eyes in the classroom would turn to the store cupboard.  They would see the way his old friend had cornered him while his back had been turned.  While he had been stupid enough to believe himself safe as he collected the instructed potions ingredients.
'You are too kind by far.'  He dragged his hand over his face.  'I have not been a good person, Draco.  I have made mistakes and acted the coward.  Dumbledore...  He saw something in me that few ever have.  He gave me a chance to prove myself.  I am afraid I have not done so.  Especially with this.'
So much death.
'Oh, you going to Hex me again?'  Ron's face twisted, anger making him ugly.  'Go on then.  Fucking Hex me!'
'Ready for what?'  Hermione frowned, looking up at the stern headmistress.
'But he does.'  Draco told him gently, having to ignore Harry's tears and the way he held him.  'He knows exactly who I am, and what I have done.  He loves you, Harry.  He's scared and confused and hurt and full of grief.  Don't be angry with him, none of this is his fault.  He has already lost one brother, I won't allow him to lose you too.'
Ron had lost his brother, Hermione had almost lost her parents.  They had given away so much of themselves, they could never be the same again.
'I don't care.  That's no excuse for what he's put everyone through.  He's a Death Eater!'  Ron hissed.
'He is in a great deal of pain, Harry.'  Madam Pomfrey answered.  'It might be for the best if we let him be.'
I feel it is important to include a warning to this particular chapter.
Watching the blond boy struggle through his days were difficult enough, but having to stand aside as he was universally ignored by all was more then Harry could bare.
Potter didn’t bring up further plans to “work together” with Draco to find out how to break the curse and the bond, clearly not giving a rat’s ass about Draco potentially suffering more from it. Whatever, Draco thought, if Potter didn’t care, then he wouldn’t either. Draco doubted any spell Potter was capable of performing would really bring that much harm to him. After all, this was the most righteous, noble and
Suddenly, he saw Potter swerve and speed up and a golden blur made him realise the Snitch was right there. He sped up, dodging the other players until he was right next to Potter, looking at him coldly in the eye.
Watching the amber firewhiskey seep into the ground made him remember the soulbond. Oh Merlin, the soulbond. How was he going to stay near Draco now? He needed to apologise and fix his mistake.
Besides, staying away from Potter would be good for him. Draco certainly didn’t think their past day spent together was anything close to pleasant, and being seen with the Golden Boy himself would only bring him more attention. It would certainly ruin his plans of staying unnoticed in the background this school year.
When Potter ignored the comment and turned to walk into the stalls, Draco felt the sudden need to strike again. Did Potter think of himself too high and mighty to grace Draco with an acknowledgement? “Come to catch a break, Potter? All that glory and praise too much for you? Don’t think you’re worthy of that either, do you?”
No one responded to the potions professor, partly because his query seemed like a rhetorical question and partly because there was still that remnant of a fierce rivalry between the Slytherins and Gryffindors. Slughorn wasn’t about to stand around waiting fruitlessly, so he jumped straight into taking attendance for the class. No point hanging around and waiting for a response that would never come.
foy. So suck it up,” Harry whispered, ignoring the looks of sympathy his fellow Gryffindors were sending him for being stuck with the vilest of Slytherins in their eyes.
Malfoy hastily pushed himself off Harry’s chest as soon as Flitwick’s door unlocked itself with a click as if sensing the two boys standing outside. “Come in!” Flitwick chimed.
Without saying another word to the pair, Harry turned and continued to hurry towards the infirmary. Malfoy was in need of treatment immediately, and Harry didn’t have the time to continue listening to whatever bullshit accusations Ron and Hermione were going to make up about Malfoy. He’d deal with them later, he told himself.
He’d tried to defend their lack of concern from the last time in his head all weekend, and thought that they would have regretted it for sure by now, realising just how unsympathetic they had been. Ron’s statement today clearly proved that wrong.
“Fuck! Malfoy!” He yelled again, hoping that the boy would cast a spell to slow his fall or that someone would perform a Cushioning Charm. No one did. He looked up and the Snitch was right in front of him. He could either grab it, win the match and let Malfoy fall to his death or let it go and play saviour again.
If it did, Draco mused, he could just haunt Potter for the rest of eternity. The stupid, annoying git and his stupidly firm chest deserved that at least. Merlin, had that chest been comfortable…
Harry scanned the room looking for a seat. Unfortunately for Draco, the only available seat was the one next to him. As Harry plonked his belongings onto the desk, Draco shifted away, twisting his face in displeasure.
Again and again, Harry was forced to relive seeing his friends brutally slain by Death Eaters and Voldemort. The haunting scene of his godfather falling through the veil and Bellatrix’s cackles rang in his ears.
Malfoy clutched his arm, whimpering as gargled gasps escaped him. The look of helplessness in his eyes was enough to make Harry tear up. After a few more jerky jolts from Malfoy, his body went limp, blood oozing out of his mouth and landing on the ground with a muted pitter-patter. Was he dead? Harry’s eyes widened as he stared at the unmoving body of Malfoy.
She nodded and hurried away, clutching her books to her chest tightly. Harry snorted at Malfoy, “Why’d you have to scream?”
Malfoy rolled his eyes in reply and looked over to Flitwick expectantly. The professor looked deep in thought.
Draco felt comforted knowing that he and Harry weren’t at each other’s throats anymore. Their newly developed friendship was almost too good to be true, but Harry seemed to genuinely want to work together with Draco. With Harry’s help, it would be much easier to get to the bottom of the curse and their soul bond.
“I know, it’s not my soap. The man who lives next to us lent me his soap. What do you think of him?”
“Are you stalking me, you freak?” He demanded, eyebrows creasing in annoyance. It had been three days since they last spoke to each other. It was Saturday now and he was surprised to see that Malfoy hadn’t died yet.
He thought back to last night and grinned widely to himself. Blast Harry and his stupid charm. He didn’t want to be one of those who fell under the spell most people did but Harry was just too… charismatic. He bit into his croissant and broke a piece of it, tossing it to Onyx who mewled softly and sniffed the strange food. Draco stepped into his bathroom, turning on the tap and letting the tepid water fall onto his head and trickle down his body, hesitating when he reached out to grab his mint shampoo. He didn’t want to lose Harry’s scent but he didn’t want to be sleep-addled and sweaty either.
A house-elf Apparated into the room, sharing something with Madam Pomfrey and hiding behind her respectfully when she walked back to the boys. She smoothed her apron and looked up at them, “I’m sorry boys, but you’re going to have to leave. I’ve just gotten word from Professor Sprout that multiple students have had a bad reaction to a plant they were working with. I trust that you’ll be able to stay in your dorms and rest over the weekend?”
“Pott- Harry, what are you doing?”
Madam Pomfrey stared at them incredulously, waving her arms and head to stop him. “I’m sorry boys, I have no clue what you are trying to tell me! Please don’t tell me this is a joke, I have things to do and places to be!”
“Murphy Woolridge, he’s Arnold’s boyfriend,” Draco muttered back.
“He’s gone now, don’t be afraid.”
“You defended him back there too, Harry! Are you forgetting that he’s a Death Eater? He almost killed us back in the Room of Requirement last year, for God’s sake!” Hermione yelled, looking bewildered that Harry was still staring at the two of them furiously.
“Draco, who is that?” He murmured under his breath, leaning his head closer to Draco’s.
“Hero? You may be a hero in everyone else’s eyes but you aren’t a hero to me.”
He heaved, gasping for air as Harry stalked like a Hippogriff towards him, emerald eyes steely and cold.
“Draco!” He screamed, reaching out for his robes to yank him back. It slipped through his fingers and everything seemed to move in slow motion. The ball hit Malfoy’s head knocking him off his broom and when the slender boy fell, he fell like an angel from heaven.
? What was he going to do with the body? How was he going to explain this to the professors? Let alone explain it to himself!
“Did he get hit with a muting curse?” She turned to Harry and asked.
“He could’ve died, Ron! Are you going to ignore that fact?” Harry shouted without thinking. He felt rage boil inside him when Ron and Hermione remained completely unsympathetic towards Malfoy’s injury. Instead, he saw confusion bloom on their faces.
“Hello and welcome to the first Quidditch match of the year! We are eternally grateful to our Professors for letting us have a mini-match before starting their classes. Do note that points will be collected for their respective houses and may the best of the best win! Today we have, Gryffindor versus Slytherin!”
As Draco wandered about with a childlike expression of glee on his face, Harry stayed a few paces behind him, trying to hide his ever-growing grin as he watched Draco ease up and thoroughly enjoy himself. He couldn’t stifle his chuckle of happiness when Draco stole a small baby blue periwinkle from the flower shop and tucked it behind Harry’s ear. Its pale colour stood out against his unruly jet-black hair and Harry sighed contentedly.
“Looking for the blonde git, are you? I’m sure he’s off milking his little injuries for more time to slack off,” Ron sneered.
“I think we should start speaking to each other on a first-name basis. We know each other well enough and this rivalry between us is pointless. We need to work through this soulbond together.”
The house-elf nodded, bowing and apologising profusely as he exited. Draco was blushing and had started to rinse himself off at that point, climbing out of the tub and wrapping himself with a towel.
“Oh? Is that what you think of me, Harry? Pray tell, am I too forthcoming? Too friendly for you? Is this all too disgusting and unnatural for you? Tell me,
Everyone had attempted to communicate with him via letters but he had ignored every single one of them, stashing heaps of mail into one of the numerous drawers in the house. Harry distantly wonders if he should have felt more guilt after having shut his closest friends out for months. He was too lost in his thoughts to think about their feelings of the whole situation and it was when he saw Ron and Hermione’s shocked expressions through the window of a carriage he was walking by that he realized he had missed them.
“Yes,” Draco repeated. He rolled onto his back, pulling Potter on top, and lifted his legs to wrap around his torso. Potter’s eyes widened at Draco’s less-than-subtle invitation, and then he nodded furiously.
“Babe?” he called out, half-expecting the worst.
He reached behind him, fumbling around, until Harry realized what he was searching for and placed his hand in Draco’s. Draco yanked it up, bringing their hands to his pillow, holding on for dear life. Harry caught on to his desperation and snapped his hips faster, and then Draco was making a mess over his best childhood sheets. He let out a broken sob, and then Harry was following suit, burying his release inside Draco.
“Pull my hair,” he asked. Seconds later strong hands were weaving through his long locks, tugging back.
The aurors made their way back to work, shooting spells and murmuring incantations with such a frequency Draco stopped bothering to understand what they were doing. He merely languished in his armchair, feeling entirely useless and unneeded and considering how easily he could slip away to his room without his mother noticing.
Draco’s brain short-circuited, rotating too quickly between embarrassed and self-righteous and offended and also kind of aroused.
Draco was impressed with himself for lasting this long at all, but with every thrust his cock rubbed against the sheets below him. They were silk, sure, and didn’t create much friction, but everything was still just overwhelming enough that he was right on the edge.
in the equation.
Harry coughed beside him. “Unless you’d rather I pretend it didn’t. Which I’m hoping isn’t the case. Because yes, it did happen. And I quite enjoyed it.”
At first it sounded like choking, and then it sounded like groaning. He felt the body shift next to him, subtle but erratic. He was no stranger to night terrors himself. Joining the Death Eaters would do that to you. And he figured with the life Potter had lived, he also had his fair share.
At his touch, Potter’s moaning only grew, his body pressing deep into the mattress. Draco shook harder, squeezing his bicep.
“Merlin, no,” Draco rushed to say, reaching a hand out. It made contact with Harry’s warm forearm, and he blushed. Fancy that – blushing
“Can I—” Draco stopped, uncertain. Harry was certain enough for the both of them, his Gryffindor days blazing in full glory. But in one night he had already made Draco bolder than he’d ever felt, and he mustered up some of that courage he felt when this whole thing started. “Can I turn over?” he asked.
“I thought… I thought it was a nightmare?” Draco asked, his voice weak and uncertain. Everything about him was weak and uncertain. What was happening?
He ignored them, intrigued by how the attacks on the Manor were getting more localized but ultimately well-enough used to odd happenings that he tried to go back to sleep.
The day was turned into night, and still the aurors had not been able to fully protect the Manor. Every time they thought they had mastered each spell, fully blocked off portkeys and floos and apparitions, one of the older wizards would step outside and release a full round of tests only to find a hole in their defenses. It was agonizingly frustrating work.
“Oi, get up,” Draco commanded, marching over. He plucked Harry’s glasses from the nightstand and shoved them on his face.
Draco came in first, face beet-red and long skinny legs far too unclothed. Then he awkwardly moved aside to let Ron and Hermione into the room.
, per se. But they also weren’t actively trying to hurt each other, either. In fact, their delicate relationship was best aided by the fact that they hadn’t shared two words since the War. Not a
He let Draco settle on his stomach, before scooping a hand under his hips and rearranging his position. Now was not the time for jealousy to twist in Draco’s gut about Harry and his experience, so he told himself to be grateful instead. That was another unfamiliar emotion. There were many of them that night.
made him look at Narcissa with horror.
Potter was hard.
“Nonsense,” Draco scoffed, falling into his familiar superiority. “You’re not kicking me out, we’ll just—”
“Yeah, probably, around you,” Harry muttered.
“No,” he said. “I mean—Draco is my boyfriend.”
Drinking his favorite brands out of Draco’s favorite glassware, finding the most comfortable chair in the salon and curling up in it like Draco had done so many times. Wandering through the hallways and finding portraits of himself, growing up through the years, a haughty smile and a wink looking down at him always, a reminder of the boy he was trying to outgrow.
And then Draco zeroed in on that one detail. He had just shagged Harry Potter. What was he thinking? He wasn’t, clearly, mind overloaded with lust and not enough ration. What would his friends think? What did
Instead, he smiled something thin and unassuming, turning away to retrieve his own pajamas. “I haven’t sought a snitch since I was sixteen, Potter. It would hardly be a fair match.” When he turned back Potter was trying to stifle a yawn. His eyes betrayed him, glancing over at the bed, before they flashed to Draco’s and then to the floor, a blush arising on his face. Draco felt his own cheeks warm. There was no avoiding it, so he might as well get it over with now.
“It’s my job,” Potter replied. Teddy’s face fell just a bit, and Draco smirked at the foot Potter had just put in his mouth. “And because I want to,” he continued.
His hand slid down Draco’s body, from neck to chest to waist to hip. It hooked under his thigh, raising his leg just a little bit higher. Draco felt Harry’s cock nudge at his entrance, and his breath hitched in the space between their mouths.
Harry grinned. “I know you did.”
His mother leaned over. “You’re welcome,” she said with a signature Slytherin slyness.
Draco nodded and parted from the room.
Harry bit hard into his shoulder and Draco jerked up at the motion, pressing his arse closer to Harry’s hips. “Say that again, Malfoy,” Harry demanded. “Call me that again.”
Or when he kind of really wanted to take Draco to an expensive restaurant or Italian vineyard.
He opened the bathroom door as quietly as he could, expecting to find the man in question curled up in his bed. Instead, Potter was still standing there, looking delicate and awkward in Malfoy’s borrowed clothes. Draco hung his suit jacket back up.
Draco wasted no time, feeling fearless and desperate in the darkened light, feeling like night’s onyx cloak that draped over the sky was draped over him as well, bending the rules so things that weren’t allowed by the light of day were given the reins to their freedom now. He palmed his hand once, twice, then took it away. Potter made a fraught noise beneath him, until Draco shoved his hand under Potter’s waistband, skin on skin, and the noise turned into a moan.
quite large, and they
“You look like that all the time!” Draco said, voice raising in defensiveness.
Harry was still motionless on the bed.
But then Ron tugged hard, pulling Draco in for a hug. Surprised, he stumbled a bit, and started laughing.
Another voice simply said
Harry leaned back in to capture Draco’s mouth in another messy kiss, shifting the angle of their bodies. Both his hands were now wrapped around Draco’s thighs, keeping them up and around his waist. It was a good thing, too, because Draco didn’t trust his own muscles to work anymore, and they’d only been going at it for a minute.
Draco rolled his head until his eyes found green.
think of him now?
They were taking it so well, and while Harry still wanted to keep Draco secret, he wondered why he had ever kept him secret from
“Wait here,” he said, placing Teddy down on the table.
This year Harry had Draco.
Their lips crashed together, mouths open and panting and hot. It was messy, until Harry slowed his movements, and then it was gentle.
to see you around more. With everyone else, I mean. With my friends. With—not my friends, but—” Potter sighed, and Draco truly could not figure out why he was trying to say. “I’m glad you’re not as isolated as some of the others,” he finally finished. And then Draco knew what it meant. He knew the other exonerated Death Eaters and their children – sons of Yaxleys and Rookwoods and Goyles – didn’t try as hard to rehabilitate themselves in magical society. Would never dream of sharing butterbeers with Jordans and Abbotts and Creeveys.
Quickly, not heeding delicacy or grace, he tore open the buttons on Potter’s shirt, throwing the garment on the floor. His hips never lost their movement as his mouth moved farther down, sucking a spot at Potter’s collarbone. The other man let out a whine so loud Draco was suddenly afraid the whole Manor could hear their activities, but he didn’t have time to think about it when Potter rolled them over, crawling onto Draco’s lap.
welcomed.”
Draco shrugged and rolled onto his back. “You’re Harry Potter. I’m Draco Malfoy. This isn’t supposed to happen.”
think he was handsome, after all.
give power to those thoughts, the ones that arose when he met Potter’s eye from across one of Longbottom’s dinner parties, or through a window in Diagon Alley when Draco walked past the Leaky Cauldron after work hours.
Harry’s lips found his again, and his words mingled with his kisses. “Draco, yes, Draco,” he breathed. “What are you gonna tell them, then, huh?”
He sighed and faced the inevitable, tugging down his half of the quilt. He slipped into the bed that had always been so familiar and safe, and now felt charged with something dangerous. He had meant what he’d said though – there was an ocean of space between his body and Potter’s, and while an infinitesimally small part of him wanted that ocean to dry up and vanish, the larger part of him was overwhelmingly grateful.
His mother called out again. “Is my Draco awake?”
“Nosy, much?” he asked. Potter turned with a jump, and hid the frame behind his back like a child caught stealing. Draco raised an eyebrow and offered the toothbrush without comment.
“Shut up,” he whispered back, turning to Draco only for their noses to collide. This close, Harry could see his own green eyes reflected in Draco’s gray ones, and he steeled all the courage he’d always possessed to face his two best friends.
Draco stood, awkwardly, bumping into one of the arms of the chair on his way up. Potter looked back at him, this time with the thinnest trace of a smile, and Draco couldn’t help the flare of competition at the sight of Potter’s amusement on his behalf.
Draco’s lips crashed into Potter’s neck, kissing and licking and biting and loving every writhing squirm below him, every choked sound. His hand moved quicker, tighter, more insistent, until he could stand it no longer and threw his whole body on Potter’s, replacing his hand’s rhythm with that of his grinding hips.
“Together?” he asked, reaching down to stroke Draco.
to entertain guests with drink and conversation, and it
When he opened them, he was staring into green. Green like the ties that had choked him for seven years. Green like the jewels that glittered on bony fingers, blueish with the same blood that flowed through his veins. Green like the fields that rolled outside his window, and like the flashes of light he’d seen far too much of in far too little time.
larger, thank you very much,” he joked, finally moving over the bed. “Although not by much. I’d expect nothing less for a Malfoy, of course.”
he’d almost forgotten for twelve strange hours.
Green like none of that. So completely divorced from Malfoys and Slytherins and spells. Green like the quidditch pitch. Like his favorite potions. Like the sweater his coworkers bought him from a muggle department store.
Draco shrugged. “I’m not ready for it. Not yet.”
Thanks for reading! My next Drarry fic will be up before Valentine's Day <3
This time, it didn’t take the aurors the whole day to finish their work. By early afternoon Draco was being pushed outside by a burly witch with a manic gleam in her eyes. She had him throw every hex he knew at the Manor (and Malfoys knew quite a lot of hexes) while Narcissa and the team waited inside. Nothing could penetrate the shield around the house, and soon the job was deemed finished and successful.
“That’s nice,” Teddy repeated. He turned to Draco. “Harry’s nice.” Green eyes turned to him next. Draco swallowed.
“Looks like you’ll need more than a day,” he grumbled, but the auror let the comment go.
Their sweat was mingling, the heat between their bodies almost oppressive, but Draco had never felt better in his life. “They don’t—I just said—oh Merlin, Harry,” Draco panted.
, except not quite, because there was no reason for that.
“What do you think?” Harry asked between grunts.
Potter’s hand came up to grab Draco’s where it was still clutching his arm. And then, he dragged it down, never breaking eye contact, until it settled over his cock.
And he knew that, didn’t he? He had watched Draco these past four years working at a job that had been assigned to him. Going to parties he was invited to. Speaking to people who had spoken to him first. Hell, even in their school days Draco had been nothing more than a puppet. His Slytherin friends saw him as a leader, the Gryffindors saw him as a bratty kid who did whatever he wanted. But Harry had always seen his weakness. Had always known Draco was a slave to his last name.
“Hello,” Potter said. “How are you?”
Logically, it made sense. Potter was closer in age to Draco than any of the senior aurors. And certainly closer in spirit, too – he’d only been training in his position for a little over a year, whereas he’d known Draco since they were little boys. And Draco’s room was plenty large enough for two people. It was just like those nights he’d had Crabbe or Goyle or Zabini over at his place. Nothing different.
They were also drunk.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “You order a stripper or something?”
“You were dreaming,” Malfoy said, suddenly embarrassed. His hand was still clutching Potter’s bicep. He tried to pull it away, but it had been wanting for too long. The last time they’d touched it was violent and fierce, and his traitorous body was finding it preferred this persistent gentleness.
He turned to her, surprised. “What for?”
Draco, instead, cleared his throat. “What a lovely gesture,” he said. “Potter?”
The rest of the day passed in agonizingly-slow hours. Round after round of protective spells were cast out. Windows were magically sealed, fireplaces were guarded, alarms were set. And still, the aurors weren’t satisfied. And still the Manor was left vulnerable.
Those green eyes flicked back and forth so fast Draco couldn’t catch them. It was like Potter was scanning him, trying to take in every detail, as he moved up closer. Again, he tried to bring his lips to Draco’s, but a particularly good thrust of his finger had Draco turning his face to bite into his pillow. Potter kept hovering over him, though, so their breath mingled. Draco felt exposed, and strangely, it had more to due with their proximity than with Potter’s fingers inside him.
“What else do you want?” Harry purred. Draco whimpered.
“We’ll talk about it tonight. Enjoy your breakfast.”
From the way Potter was moaning above him, he might actually have been.
“This is Draco,” Harry said.
Potter took it. “Thanks,” he said. Then he turned the frame out to Draco, as if he would need to see the photo to know what image it held. “Second year?” he asked. There was another question in his voice, asking about more than the date of the scene. Because it was a photo of a very small Draco, decked out in green and silver, balancing on a broom with an arm outstretched. He was reaching for the snitch, Draco knew that, the memory of his first quidditch game still so clear in his memory. But from the angle the photographer had shot, it looked like Draco was reaching for Potter himself, equally small and just as focused on his own broom, red-gloved hands so close to winged gold.
“I’m well,” he replied. “And yourself?”
But this year. Well.
He sighed, resigning himself to his fate, and ambled over toward the door in nothing but his boxers.
“Are you…” Harry started. Draco hadn’t ever heard that tone from him before. He’d seen Potter quiet, he’d seen Potter reserved, but he’d never heard his voice so timid before. It was unbecoming, and it forced Draco’s head out of the bedding. Harry’s eyes were half-lidded with fatigue, but still so worried. “Did I just push you into doing something you didn’t want to?”
he’d said.
and even more so
“Yes, well. I can only say I’m glad I’ve been so welcomed,” Draco acknowledged. Then he raised an eyebrow, looking up to the high ceiling in the hall. “Although…”
“Sounds perfect.”
For the first time Harry noticed they were full, a basket clutched tightly in her grip. It was overflowing: with chocolates, with plush toys, with bubbling pink potions, and more treasures Harry couldn’t see.
Draco heard her heels click softly away, and the room went silent. He paused, then turned to Harry. “Is it just me, or did she say
“Correct,” Draco said. He ignored the second question in Potter’s voice, the one that asked
, he thought. Maybe then they would have developed more cuddly personalities. And perhaps also if they’d bothered to raise their kids themselves, without the help of house elves.
He snapped the book shut and sat up straight.
“Hmm?” Harry pressed, question seeping into Draco’s skin.
Harry looked up, sharp. “Wait, d’you mean…?”
The small group of aurors set up shop, opening toolkits that tripled in size after being unlocked. They waved their wands with curious expressions, conducting sweeps of the estate to determine what they were working with. One handed Potter a very thick and heavy-looking manual, pointing to something on one of the pages. Draco watched Potter nod along in concentration, looking between the page and the auror. Draco was surprised; he didn’t remember Potter being a particularly hard-working student. Then again, Draco knew how easy it was to skive off classes he found boring and only try at the ones he thought would be particularly useful. Potter clearly found this work more useful than their shared history classes.
Most of the world saw Harry’s fake smile, the one that was too tight and too even to be anything but practiced. The one that appeared on magazine covers and grinned at politicians. Some people, those who actually knew Harry, saw his worried mouth and troubled eyes. The expression he wore when he was just comfortable enough to let his guard down and remind people how much horror he had seen.
Not that he was planning on getting married any time soon. It was just nice to feel something in his life fall into place. It was nice to know he still had a purpose, even after finishing the fight he’d been fighting his whole life. It was nice feel needed, because Harry didn’t think he’d ever shake his saviour complex.
Handshakes and thanks and graceful acknowledgements were soon being exchanged, and Draco took the distraction of everybody packing up to pull Harry aside into a hallway.
Then he turned back and entered the hall.
“Mmm,” Potter moaned back.
“You were… making noises,” Draco insisted. Why wasn’t he moving away?
“Fuck me, please, Merlin, I want you to fuck me,” Draco babbled, his cock sliding between the heat of their bodies.
Potter’s grip tightened on his wrists. “
Harry slipped back inside him and it felt so easy and natural Draco wondered why they hadn’t done this earlier. He was slow to build his pace back up, though.
“Oh please, I’m not saying we should order takeaway and watch shitty romantic comedies. I’m just saying that the expensive dinners and vineyard tours in Italy are for couples who need to distract themselves from their failing relationships."
Potter glanced up at Draco, then looked back to his shoes. For a world-famous celebrity, survivor of dragons and dark wizards and dementors, training to be an auror and to jump right back into the line of fire, Potter still looked so young and boyish. Still couldn’t get his hair to lie flat, still wore schoolboy shoes and a worn-out watch.
Time stopped. The air crackled. His lungs collapsed. More accurately, Draco’s jaw fell open and his eyes went flat. Potter was looking at his shoes.
and Harry let out a groan because great, Hermione was here, too. He warred whether to get up and meet them at the door or let them come to him. The decision was made when he heard Draco murmur
“What do you want?” he repeated.
“Get up,” Draco growled, and Potter happily obliged. Then the last article of clothing between them was shed, and they were tumbling back to the bed, Potter’s head hitting the pillow with a soft sound.
“Please, feel free to take the bed,” he said, forcing his voice to sound as smooth and reassuring as he could make it. “You’ve had a long day.” Before he could stick his foot in his mouth he hurried to the bathroom.
“Thank you,” Potter replied. “And congrats on your promotion,” he countered. Draco frowned, unsure how Potter had heard, until he remembered he’d been talking about it in the Leaky Cauldron last month, where the two had run into each other. Potter hadn’t said anything about it at the time, but then again, he hadn’t said anything ever. “It’s been…
'I know.'  Madam Pomfrey paused in her terrible ministrations, her fingers dripping with the viscous liquid.  'It will help, I promise.  You are being so brave.'  She had started with the shallowest of the whip marks, but still it would cause untold pain for the blond boy.  If only he would allow her to put him to sleep.
Harry also turned a page, still reading after several hours of sitting beside the blond boy.  It was beyond late, more early morning now.  Sunday loomed large.  A day spent catching up with homework, spending the day with friends, laughing, joking, surviving.
'Are you going to be warm enough?'  Was his question, worry creasing his forehead, his eyes crinkled in concern.  'Perhaps we have been out here too long already?  I should take you back.  It's warm in your room, you cannot afford to catch a chill.  I should have brought your bottle, and a hot drink.'
But, the sight of that pale body lit by fleeting glimpses from the waxing moon.  All shivery and dying on that cold ground.  He couldn't do it.  Why bother to throttle him now?  The animals would discover the easy prey soon enough.  There would be nothing left of him to resemble a body, let alone the missing son of Lucius Malfoy.  He wouldn't need to dirty his hands, wouldn't need to murder.
'Did you love him?'  She spoke softly.  'Do you love him?'
The queries would grow, all the evasive answers would one day explode in his face, doing untold damage to years of friendship.  Lying was fast becoming a part of who he was now.  Trips to the Library were never that, staying behind after class to speak to the teacher never happened, visits to the House Elves were a fabrication.  All were stolen moments that were spent with Draco.
He would tell the clueless boy of Chocolate Frogs and magic jelly beans, and of Dumbledore, glinting up at him from within a cardboard frame.
The one who had put them all to shame.
Didn't he deserve to die?
'Yes, she did.'
He could turn his head, imagine green grass and starlit skies.  Cool air washing over his skin.  Not damp bricks, crawling with mold and smelling of rot.  He could close his eyes, they would allow him that, so caught up in the moment that they forgot this was torture for him.
'We will get you back as quickly as possible, Draco.'  McGonagall spoke, her voice tight, dry.  Someone had to be strong, someone had to take the responsibility.
The nondescript black jumper he wore scratched where it touched.  He could feel it rubbing against his scars.  Nothing about this felt familiar, nothing felt safe.
'Where would he go?  He has no surviving family that I know of.'
'I am afraid it was for the majority of the night, Harry.'  Pomfrey told him with a heavy heart.  'He was still for most of the time.  It wasn't until the early hours that Hagrid noticed something was wrong.' She stopped to stand beside him, her arm around his shaking shoulders.  'I am so sorry.  I never would have put him through that had I known.'
Argus knew to approach the boy with caution.
The dreams were getting worse.
'I thought you had gone.'  Draco's eyes flickered as Harry stepped near.  Opening.  'I though after all of that, you wouldn't come back.'  He sounded so soft, so afraid, that Harry felt the weight of guilty tears welling once more.
'Yes, it has.'  She nodded.  'Harder than it has any right to be.'  Notes of residual anger still coloured her tone.
The boy sat in a circle of light, the lamp by his elbow throwing his thin face into stark relief against the muted colours of the books that surrounded him.  His head lay on his arms, his eyes tightly shut against the light that enveloped him.
'You hated them, didn't you.'
Harry eyed the towering display in front of him.  A mountain of colour, shining boxes set before him.  Each one atop another, piled to the ceiling.
'The castle is big enough for you both to go unnoticed, you could talk to him anywhere, I don't know why you have to go back in there.'
Voldemort.
'No, sweetheart, it is I who am sorry.  Not many people have been kind to you, have they.'  She spoke softly, taking in his red eyes and sallow skin, looking for all the world like a child on the verge of collapse.  She sat herself opposite him, her hand on his shaking thigh.  'Do you think you would be able to tell me what has happened?'
Completly alone.
It would all come out in the end, Hermione knew, just as she knew she would always offer her unfailing support down whatever path his life lead him.
'Save your worries for someone else.  I don't need them.'  Harry sighed, getting to his feet, he couldn't bring himself to look at her.  'I'm tired, Hermione.  Tired of everything.  You have gotten what you want, you and Ron.  You can be happy now.  Draco has found someplace else to stay, he's not coming back.'
Voices, so many bloody voices in his head.  Hissing, swallowing him.  Words fighting for attention, each one as cold as the last, each one desperate to be heard.  He wanted to vomit, wanted to sob, curl up and be forgotten.
But this, this was the worst.
'Nothing to intrude on.'  Harry shrugged.  'He's gone.  Draco.  He's left.'
'No.'  Draco replied, swallowing hard, knowing that the lie was for the best.  'Nothing happened.  I...I was just tired.'  He locked away the words, the thoughts and the pain.
Harry stood in the doorway as McGonagall made her way over to Madam Pomfrey, her hand already delving into her voluminous pocket to retrieve the vial of potion.
And Harry knew.
'His arm was hurting him this morning.'  Harry told the desk in front of him, his voice dropping, the fight leaving his body.  'Just a little ache, he said.  But I knew it was worst than that.  He smiled at me, told me to go to breakfast.  It's the Dark Mark.  It's hurting him.  It's going to get worse, isn't it?  The nightmares, the pain in his arm.'
'What did you do?'  Harry dropped to his knees, almost touching him.  'Show me.'
He could not get the memories of Ginny from his restless head.  Seeing her return, glowing under the weight of that shining piece of silver banded around her finger had brought memories to the surface, memories that he had tried so hard to repress.
'Not your fault.'  Harry murmured.
'He has to be.'  Neville smiled sadly.  'What chance do any of us have if Harry falls?'
'What the fuck are you doing, Harry?'  Ron raged.  'Bloody leave him down there!'
Draco. Claimed. Owned. Subjugated.  But there it was in front of him, Dumbledore's scruffy handwriting, scrawled in the little book that lay open in his lap.
He was more than happy to leave the two witches to their grim task.
His routine had become a familiar necessity.
This private gift that made him smile, that made the whispers fade.  The one that had the power to turn Harry into nothing more than a memory.
There had been very little she and McGonagall could do about his back last night.  It would have killed the boy had they tried to tackle the infection when he was so very weak.  It was now safe to apply the potion that would enable his body to begin the healing process.
Fury.
'Yes.'  Neville's nod went unseen.
Someone was screaming.
'Want some help?'  Harry set aside Draco's question to answer later.  He put the little present he carried on his chair, almost hoping that it had gone unnoticed.  Draco nodded at Harry's question, annoyed at his inability to do this most basic of tasks without aid.  'Did you sleep?'  He couldn't stop his hand from running over Draco's growing hair.
Draco reeled back, Nott taking full advantage and pushing his face into Draco's, his coffee filled breath turning Draco's blood to ice.
From the corner of her eye she caught a flash of red hair.  So, Ron had stayed as well.
Loved him unconditionally and without surrender.
'Then that's good enough for me.'  His arm falling from Harry's shoulder, Neville stood.  'Get dressed, and if you like, perhaps we could head down to the kitchens and pester the House Elves for a late night snack.  Unless...unless you have to be somewhere?'
'The two have become very fond of each other.'  Her own lips twitching.  'And as such, it has made Draco more concerned for Harry's well-being than his own.'
'Couldn't care less.'  Harry shrugged, allowing himself a smile.  'It's got nothing to do with anyone.'  His fingers moving higher, hardly brushing the bruised skin circling Draco's wrists.
'You...you could read them to me.  If...if you wanted to.'
It was Nott and his snide comments as others looked on, smirking behind hands, laughing in the hallways as he walked past.
Harry would gladly throw down his wand, wrap his bare hands around that corrupt throat and squeeze the very life, the very breath from that sham of a wizard.
'I didn't save Fred.  Professor Lupin.  Colin.  Snape.  Hedwig.  They still died.'
'No, please.'  Draco begged, his stomach turning to liquid.  'Please.'  He could hear the collective sound of wands being drawn.
'Harry!'  Ron's violent cry ripped through the cowering students and parted the crowds.  'Let him go!'  He dragged the book to his chest, held the card in his sweating hand.
It wasn't supposed to happen this way.  Draco had always been prepared, with an ever present sense of dread, that this 'thing' with Harry would eventually find its end.  He and Harry were never going to have that happy ending, there would never be walking side by side to classes, there had never been any chance of a life outside of the curtains that had hidden them for so long.  Draco had always known that the end was coming, but it had been his fervent hope that out of it all, this sorry mess, Harry would not be the one to get hurt by it.
'No.  No indeed.'  The Lady shook her head.  'I shall see that is done.'  Her tone grave, falling into respectful as she listened to the words the headmistress spoke.
At least he had been.
Sleep was not going to visit Harry tonight.  He gave up on closing his eyes to only find them open and staring at the canopy above him, his mind active and refusing to rest.  The gentle snoring coming from the beds around the room irritated him, making him wish someone else was awake so he wouldn't feel quite so alone.  He briefly contemplated waking Ron, before thinking better of it.  Rest had not come easily to the red headed boy of late.  It would be cruel to deny him the sweet sleep of oblivion.
Nott's father, and his own special smile.  The once reserved for the Malfoy child.  No mask to hide his features.  Just a single finger pressed to his lips as he descended on Draco.
They were wrong.
His reaction to the tried and trusted potion was terrifying.  She had gotten it so very wrong.
The man who now owned the room was distant.  But it could hardly be a surprise.
'When you...  Left,'  She chose her words carefully, 'I had the House Elves remove it to storage for safe keeping, should you ever return.  Unfortunately it was misplaced, that is why I did not like to mention it to you.  But yesterday, after a lot of searching, they found it.'
'We never got back together.'  Harry sighed long and hard.  'It's not easy to explain, but it was never going to work between us.  She is with Dean Thomas now.  She is happy.'
'No.'  Harry shook his head.  'At least that's something to be thankful for.  He says Hogwarts is his home.  But...  That's only because he has no where else to go.  He's not no place else to live, Neville.  And no one to go to.  No one at all.  I've let him down.'  He added softly.
'Draco, you are a wizard.'
'And you know that for sure, do you, Harry?'  Neville asked, wanting a reason behind Harry's stupid behaviour.
'Poppy?'
'I didn't mean...'
'I can't go there...'
'It has been agreed, you shall be ignored by everyone.  Not one single person is going to speak to you, look at you, adknowledge your existence.'
That sound of the door again.  Someone was leaving.  But he wasn't left alone, not this time.  He felt a dip where he lay, there was someone sitting beside him.  Draco felt no fear.  This person was kind, gentle.  Green eyes flashed inexplicably through his head.
Only, only his wishes had all been in vain.  He had waited too long in the gentle push.  He stupidly allowed his desire for safety, for some kind of hope to take over.  Dragging Harry down into the dark place with him.  Taking his life and his friends, stealing Harry's own dreams.  Harry had saved him, and in return he had destroyed the only person who had ever really mattered.
'You shall let me pass, and you shall say no more.  The tale is no doubt flying throughout the castle, and I would like to have hope that the portraits will not join in this ridiculous, unpleasant pastime.'
But it wouldn't matter at all.
'I...I want to keep it.'  Draco's eyes dipped, colour bright in his cheeks.  'Please?'
Some would speak, some would murmur affection that made his skin crawl.  One would kiss up his neck, lips cold and thick with desire, his hand pressed up between his legs, gently touching.
'Don't.'  He warned, his voice rough, filled with angry tears.  'You won't ever know what it's like to have to sit in the back of every single classroom, just so I can't feel all those wands behind me.  Of spending all my time terrified of magic, even though I'm in a castle full of nothing but, knowing that I have nowhere else to go.'  He slammed his hands on the desk, inches from the box.  'I was good, I had a future, a life.  Now I'm nothing.  I'm meant to be a wizard!'
'I've always been successful at being an annoying little shit.  Even my own friends had trouble putting up with me.'  His laugh carried no humor.  'A foresight into my future perhaps.  It's little wonder that people didn't stick around.  I've not been a kind person.'
'I'm a mess.'  His face flushed scarlet.
Those half dozen paperback books, battered and bruised and beyond repair had brought Harry such comfort when he was that lost little boy living under a set of stairs.
The robe was once again tied at his throat.  Harry's warm fingers safe and gentle against his skin.  Just brushing the place where hands had once wrapped themselves around him, squeezing tightly.  But this, he could get used to a touch like this.
The stench had been so profound that Nott had nearly lost his dinner when he was first invited down into his own celler.  Decomposing bodies, human waste and pain creeping up the narrow dark stairs, leaching into the walls, infiltrating his nostrils.
He was the only one left now, and felt it was his duty to be rid of the final, horrific acts of the Death Eaters.  Nothing could be traced back to him, of that he was sure.  A decaying body of a student could not be found if it was dumped and left for the animals.
Draco was speaking to him, so softly that he hadn't a hope in catching the words.  Draco was touching him.  Stroking his face, his hair.  Brushing tear stained kisses to his lips.
Books and parchment, broken ink bottles, spilling their black contents into the cracks.  As deep and as dark as the blood of Draco's nightmares.
'Why are you always so nice to me?'  Incredulous, Draco could never begin to comprehend all that had passed between them.
'Draco?  Draco, can you hear me?'  There was that voice again, the one he knew so very well.  It was hope, friendship.  Home.
Harry had been the owner of the voice that brought him back, the owner of the green eyes from his beautiful dream.  He had dripped water onto his lips, he had made him feel beyond safe, cared for, protected him from the horrors of his nightmares.  The Hero, the Golden Boy, the Saviour of the Wizarding World, the Boy Who Lived.  It had been Harry who sat beside him all night, cried over him, touched him so carefully.
It had been hot, hard, almost desperate.  His hands had grasped onto clothing and held on tightly, pulled that body as close as could be, afraid what this revelation had meant.  A kiss that had terrified as much as it had excited.  This was who he was, who he had always been.
'You okay, Harry?'  Hermione, as observant as ever, watched as he continued to push the food around his plate.  'You look terrible.'
'You don't sleep.'  Harry could hear the lingering traces of fear in Draco's voice.  'You...you stay.'  Draco closed his eyes, robbing Harry of the sight, tears leaking down his cheeks.  'Don't.  Not...not anymore.'
'Fucking Malfoy?'  Theo hissed, 'Who the fuck says this is about Malfoy?'
She had taken the empty bowl from him, ignored his begging, and walked away from his reaching hands.
He had Harry.
Sugary sweets and paperbacked books.  Pranks and novelties.  The smell of the shops, the taste of Butterbeer on his tongue.
'Honeydukes first, okay?'  Ron spoke up in the companionable silence.  The sun shone down upon the quartet as they made their slow, meandering way into Hogsmeade, happy to follow in the dusty footsteps of the students ahead on the sun bleached path.
'I didn't think.'  Harry looked down at the treasured piece of wood in his hand, hating what it now meant for Draco.  He quickly shoved it back into his pocket.  They would have to do this the Muggle way.
'No.'  Professor McGonagall was quick to reassure him.  Harry's heart sank upon hearing the words.  Shame washing over him.  How had he forgotten Hagrid so completely?  He must have spent the night and day alone, thinking that he had found Draco in vain.
'No.  I...I can't see you like that again, Harry.  Please.'
It had been so easy.
Harry couldn't help but grin, dropping to the chair by Draco's side, already reaching over the tiny gap, ready for the hand that lay in wait.
'You...you looked so alone.'  Harry answered him honestly.  'I couldn't leave you.'
'Have they gone?'  Harry asked her weakly from his place on the floor.  His voice littered with all the things he could not say.  With all the words she knew he would never voice for himself.  Tired, hungry and scared and cold.  So very alone  'Everyone?'
They could have left.  Weeks and weeks ago he could have gotten Draco away from this accursed place and all the hateful people contained within the walls.  He shouldn't have listened so easily, he shouldn't have let Draco convince him with gentle whispers and that kiss.
Harry Potter had been his friend in the small hours when he had been left with none.
Pumpkins floated above the heads of the students, triangles for eyes, spiky teeth, candles glowing inside each one.  Tables groaning under the weight of too much food, enormous glass bowls overflowing with pumpkin juice, so far, so normal.
The room had been silent, almost dark.  The light of the crescent moon glinting through a chink in the curtains.
His eyes darkened at the hand touching his.  She didn't know his father at all, she surely hated him, as did most.  Why was she spilling all these lies?  He ripped his hand away roughly, watching her face as it took on a look of mild surprise.
'There isn't any stars.'  Draco remarked softly, the welcome night breeze stirring his hair.
The door to the outside stood before them.
'No.  Nothing's wrong.'  He shrugged.  'Just, don't be kind, not tonight.  I...I couldn't bear it.  Please, just go.'
'Ron...'  Harry stuttered, shocked.  Draco tight in his embrace.  He wasn't going to let the trembing boy go.  He could already feel Draco's tears against his skin.  'Look...I...'
He couldn't look as the Headmistress climbed those few steps to the lectern, as she surveyed them all with a flinty glare.  Silence rained down upon them all, and the weight of his own cruelty had him pull the book he still held tighter to his chest.
It really had been his lucky day.
'Take...take him to his bed.  Make him leave.'  Draco begged, unable to tear his eyes away from Harry's weary form.  'Please, you have to help him.'
'I am.'
'I would, you know that.  His friends mean the world to him, and without a doubt I would drive a wedge between them, even unintentionally.  He has already fallen out with one of them because of me.  I will not see it happen with anyone else.'
He knew she was coming, had been waiting for the knock, but the slight tap at the door still sent his heart racing, his palms clammy.  Why couldn't he just be left alone?  What harm would it do?
Another nightmare to add to the pile.
'Yeah, she does.'  Harry smiled, pulling his legs up onto the bed.  'It's nice.  Goodness knows that the family deserve some happiness.'
'Draco, that's enough.'  Quickly, painfully, Harry moved closer, his body pressing tightly against his.  He wrapped a securing arm firmly around Draco's quivering waist, their bodies flush.
'You feel so good.'
'Don't care.'
All he could picture were Hermione's eyes.
'And that was more than enough.'
'Are we going to have to indulge you in this charade, or are you going to spit it out and end the anticipation?'  Hermione spoke before anyone else jumped in, her eyes already rolling at the drama Seamus was insisting upon.
Curling spells of red fire lapping at his skin, curses that didn't even have to be spoken twisting in his gut, cracking his bones, forcing his body to open under each of them, forcing him to ask for things that even in his worst nightmares he would never do.
Those very first days in his little room were clogged full of memories that could never be erased.  Full of pain, uncertainty, and a fervent wish that everything could be cast aside.  So to hold this book in his hands, the very first one from those dark days, and be able to smile at the memory it conjured was a surprise to him.
'Come here.'  A whisper, so gentle, so full of understanding.  'You look so tired, Harry.  You have helped me to sleep, let me return the favour.'  He pulled back the covers, his hand reaching out, the space beside him small and inviting.  'Please.  I need you tonight.'
'Don't say that.'
'Harry has fainted.'  She rose from her cramped position.  'He is exhausted, hungry.  He needs to be in a bed.  After a full night's sleep and a solid meal inside of him, Harry will be as right as rain.'
An age passed before she spoke again.
'It's been ages.  I...I should be better now.'
He would never, ever, be able to stand in front of his friends and pretend that Draco wasn't his all.  That he wasn't the only thing he would ever want in his life, the only thing he could never willingly give up.  He wouldn't lie, not anymore.
'Harry?'
He had only seen the fur wrapped aftermath and the pain filled attempts at healing.
He had not been seen with his glittering prize.  His dark secret had not been discovered.
Harry didn't come.
Ron had never once believed that coming back for the eighth, and final year, would be easy.  And like Harry, he too had toyed with the idea of never returning to Hogwarts again.  Keeping silent, he had simply gone along with what his best friend had decided to do, and Hermione too, of course.  Had she wished to stay away, Ron knew he would also.
'You tormented and teased him, took the piss.  You bullied him, you bullied all of us.  You really think sorry will make all that disappear?'  Fucking Hell, Malfoy, you stamped on his face!  He could have died.  He could have choked on his own blood and you wouldn't have cared at all.  It was all a big joke to you, wasn't it?  All the lies and the games and thinking you were always better than everyone else.  You couldn't leave Harry alone, could you?  You had to have the last laugh.  You and your family deserve all they get, Malfoy.'
'Harry...'
''I'm fine.'  He answered quickly with a reassuring smile.  'Just tired, I guess.'
'Malfoy went last night.  Alone.'  Ron told her in whispers, the sight of a desperately sad Malfoy never far from his mind.  'He appeared after you went to bed.  We had words and he walked out, just left.'
'I...I...Neville...'  Harry squirmed under Neville's question.  'It's difficult.'
'To them I am.'  Draco didn't react, his thumb rubbing lightly across the back of Harry's hand.  'My father was, I also have the Dark Mark.  For all they know, I could be planning to murder them in their sleep.  Why should they understand it, Harry.'
'Do you mind?'
'I cannot.  No'  Slughorn hung his head, knowing defeat when he saw it, knowing that he had been a fool for even thinking about making Draco return to his House.
See those emerald eyes dim with shadowed sadness, see the laughter die in his features as they met once more.  Over and over and over.  Until the year was ended, until Harry finally left, until they said goodbye one last time.
'It's all so fucking horrible, so difficult, confusing.  I...I want to make you better, and I can't.  All I do is mess everything up.'
I've spoken to Madam Hooch.  She is going to start trials this weekend.  She said there are some students who are showing real promise this year.'  Harry continued on with a long, deep sigh, finally rid of the weight he had carried around with him all evening.  'I'm tired, Ron.  I've had enough of it.  It...It doesn't feel important anymore.'  He kept his eyes on his rapidly diminishing chess pieces, knowing he would see the anger hot in Ron's features  'I can't do it anymore.'
Standing before him, Ron could see, finally see, that there was something about the way Malfoy held himself, a heavy, gilded book clutched to his chest, almost like a shield.  There was something missing from his grey eyes, some spark of defiance that had always been there before.  The skin on his face looked paper thin, transparent.  He had been crying, that much was evident.
'It's going to be okay.'  The agonies of the boy too much to stand, Harry climbed up onto the bed.  Proprietary be damned.  He took hold of Draco's flailing hands.  'You are doing so well. Not much more.'
'He is not going anywhere.'  Harry's face set, his eyes regarding Professor Slughorn with a calm he didn't feel.
'I'd think of something.'  Harry smiled, turning to Draco, watching him as his gaze never left the slowly crawling stars.  He looked contented, and surprisingly enough, happy.  He would stay here, would do anything to keep that look on Draco's face.  'We could, you know.'  Harry added after a heartbeat.
Let them all stand and stare.  Let them laugh and throw scorn at him.  He didn't care.  All that mattered was the person beside him.  The Pure-blood boy from Slytherin who had captured his empty heart, and held his hand when there were no words left to say.
No.  Draco knew from the moment he had failed to raise his wand on the Astronomy Tower he had condemned them all to Hell.  It was his fault.  His parents had died because he was weak, because he had failed.
Why couldn't anyone see that?
'I'm clever.'  Hermione told him, not a note of conceit in her voice.  'But I have not been kind.  I have been blind, Draco.  I was so busy watching Harry that I forgot to see anyone else.  You don't have a wand, do you?'
'It's good to see you too!'  Harry laughed.  'I saw your light on and I thought...'  Harry was unable to finish his sentence before being forcibly pulled into the warm hut.
There was a voice.  So loud in the desolation.
'I know you do.'  Neville's voice softened, his arm going around Harry's slumped shoulders, pulling him close.  'Has he...  Has he left the castle?'
They didn't hear the slight creak of the door, didn't hear the soft sound of footsteps entering the room.  They thought they were safe, they thought they had all the time in the world.
'You're not, are you.'  He heard her whisper.  'You haven't been all right for a long time.  I can see it now.'  She took her hands off him.  Her warm, caring hands.  Draco wanted to reach out, wanted to feel someone again.  It had already been so long.
Draco leaned against him, putting his aching arm on Harry's outstretched legs as Harry slipped his arm around Draco's back and urged him just that little bit closer.
'We spoke about this last night, and you agreed with me, Hermione.  You said it yourself, Harry has been struggling, and we haven't been there for him.  It's our fault he was manipulated by Malfoy.  And we are the ones who can help him see that, we can be better friends.  He can forget about that git, that utter bastard.'
'Have they planned their mutiny yet?  Or am I to be thrown to the wolves?'  Draco said, only half joking.
'Someone did this.'  Potter spoke into the silence, his voice unsettling to all who listened.  'Who?'  He demanded, his blazing eyes raking over all who still stood before him.
'You...you shouldn't.'
Harry lay on his side, the back of his dark head visible to the three faces turning in his direction.  He was whispering.  So softly, so carefully that they couldn't begin to hear to what he was saying.
He had to protect Harry.  Malfoy had done something to him, Harry would never...  He just wouldn't.  Malfoy had brought all of this upon himself.  No words would ever be strong enough for all that he and his poisoned family had done to them all.
More movement.  So many footsteps, so many whispers and hushed voices.  They were talking about him, always talking about him.  He heard the door open, someone leaving.  But it wasn't Harry.  Harry who lay with him, holding his hand, talking to him, bringing him back.
'He w...was reading.  His voice...  It wasn't right.  He...he just stopped, passed out.'  Draco swallowed a sob.  'I...I couldn't do anything.  I tried to get out...  But I'm stuck, useless to him.'
'I am afraid I shall be needing Potter's assistance once again.'  She told the disappointed pair.  'I'm sure you can manage one day without his company, Miss Granger.'  Hermione's face flushed under the intense scrutiny.
'It feels like silk.'  Draco sat with the cloak pooled in his lap, fingers reverently stroking the precious fabric.  'I can feel the magic in it.  But it feels soft, like...'  He stopped himself, a blush staining his cheeks.
'I do...  So many times.'
He knew Harry would get up on the bed, just as he had before.  He would lie beside him and take his cold hand.  Stroke his fingers and whisper words of regret, of loss.  Speak of what they had, of what they could have been.
The holiday was over, the students set to return later that day.  All would return to the normality that was slowly killing Harry.
'Just...'  Greg stuttered, his stomach churning.  'Just don't, Theo.  Leave him alone.  Please?'
Draco shook, he could hear the caretaker coming closer to where he sat, to where Harry stood before him.  This was madness.  Soon the whole school would know that he was back, back and damaged and beaten.  However well meaning Harry had been in throwing his dressing gown over him, Filch was certainly no fool, he would see him.  And that's when Draco looked down at himself.
'I wouldn't be so sure.'  Her smile was kind, all knowing.  'Harry was with you because he cares, Draco.  Sending him away, leaving him, will not change that.  If anything, it will make him all the more determined.  You have known him for all of your school life.  Tell me something, Draco, has he ever struck you as the kind of person who is able to walk away?  As someone who is prepared to give up anything for an easy life?'
But he had known.  And so had Draco.  It had always been so much more than that.
'You were kind, you were the first person in so long who looked after me.'  It was no use, Draco could feel the start of yet more tears.  'Thank you.'  He sat where Hagrid directed, distracted himself with rubbing his hand over Fangs' friendy head.  'I owe you more than I can ever say.'
It just kept getting worse.
Draco shivered, cold under the weight of too many memories.
'No.'  Harry answered bluntly, reaching out to picking up the book they were reading, not wanting to have this conversation.
Those words, spilling from a face that twisted with cruelty.  Made to hurt, to stick in his stomach, his lungs.  Stealing his breath.  No.  It wasn't true.  It wasn't like that.  Nott had it all wrong.  He hadn't wanted to leave with them.  They had seized his hands, forced him.  He wasn't what Nott said.
Summoning was little remained of his courage, his strength, tears stinging his eyes, the dark haired boy swallowed down his guilt.  Pushing his leaden body away from the safety of the door, Harry turned to that broken sobbing.  Turned to the boy in the bed.
His stomach dropped as he looked at the dirt covered face that smiled up at him from the collectable card.  He felt as if he was tumbling towards the ground from his broom, the earth rushing up to meet him in a sickening blur that he was helpless against.
'Has Harry?'  Was her next question.
The sheets were cold beneath his touch where Draco usually lay.
She could speak of their families, of the ones who had been there, in that deep, dark dungeon.  Their Fathers, their Uncles.  Brothers and Cousins alike.  That they looked on, held him down, drew their wands.  Took their part.
'I want that too.'  Harry told him, a smile just for him.  'But I don't want you to go back to Slytherin.'
'I sometimes think that I'll never be able to keep a secret from you.'
'He just wanted some time.  Just a little time to get better, to face this fucking world again.'  Harry failed to realise that tears were streaming down his cheeks.
Draco could hear the subdued voices of the two witches in the next room as he pretended to sleep.  Their hushed words talking over his future, what was to be done with him.  He didn't have the energy left to care.
'I'm not sure I can.'  Harry sighed.  'I wish...I just wish they could see beyond the past.  It's seems stupid to be angry over something so small.  After everything else that has happened, why should it matter where you sleep?'
'Your scars do not make you less of a man, Draco, and neither does what happened to you.'  She helped him sit up, helped him into a clean top, finally, thankfully, covering his body.  'You have been touched by evil, and you have survived.'
Only this time Ron sat morosely by the Chess board alone, roughly moving the pieces back and forth, with no direction in mind.
'I don't.'  Harry shook his head.  'And I haven't for a long time.'  He sighed, threading his fingers through Draco's.  'This is how it is now.'
'Okay.'  He heard her sigh, caught the reluctance in her single word.  'Draco, I...'
It was never going to happen.
Millicent weeping eyes fixed upon her uncle.
Harry and his hand.  Warm, gentle and understanding.  It had hurt to pull away from all of that, to stand in the common room, surrounded, but so very alone.
'Mr. Malfoy is out of danger.  I don't expect him to wake any time soon.'  She spoke to the dark haired boy kindly.
'I'm sorry.'  Draco closed his eyes against Harry's broken heart.  Again.
'I'm pathetic.'  Tears that were always waiting behind his eyes began to fall quietly.
Her voice would be angry, her words bright and full of hate.  She knew that as her hand gripped the rail that led down and down.  It would be hard not to throw blame, to look for reasons, and to demand answers.  She wouldn't be able to stop.
'I...'  Nott wheezed, and Harry understood that the boy had stopped fighting him.  He had quietly accepted his fate.  'I...I'm s...sorry.'
His head dropped to Harry's shoulder, tear tracks damp across his cheeks.  Shutting his eyes, his hand fell to his lap where it was quickly gathered up by the dark haired boy, their fingers instinctively finding each other.
The shared bedroom was filled with the sounds of soft snoring.  Thankfully the other boys were still asleep.  Harry knew that he would not have been able to deal with any questions that would surely be thrown at him if they knew he had not been in his bed.
Madam Pince, ever aware of the time, looked around her Library, mindful of the students who had filed in and out of the room all evening.  It was hard to keep track of who had left.  But as she surveyed the room, she was grateful that it was now empty, save for one bright lamp that continued to burn long after the rest had been extinguished.  And the student who continued to reside at one of the tables.
'Don't say anything to him.  Please.'  Draco sipped slowly at the liquid, quelling the urge to gulp.  'He has already done so much for me, I...I don't want him to know.'
'You are.'
'Tell me,' beseeched the Fat Lady, immediately cutting off the chance for the headmistress to voice aloud the password.  'Oh, do tell me, Minerva.  Are the rumors true?'  She wrung her hands together, the dry scrape of paint against paper loud and scratchy in the silence of the hall.
Draco was standing before the open window.  His back to the room, hands on the stone ledge, the chilly winter air whipping around his thin pyjamas.  It was far to cold for this.  Harry wanted to lead him away from that window, wrap him in layers of covers.  Take him into his bed once more.
'Keep Potter away from him?  Minerva, no.'  Madam Pomfrey was aghast at the idea.  She had seen first hand that Harry was the only one who could properly care for Draco.  And the thought of Draco trying to get by without him was unthinkable.
'Draco...'
Draco had gone.
So Harry looked.
'Even so, it takes real bravery to come back, that much I do know.'  He pushed the plate of hard biscuits towards him.  'You should eat something, you look half starved.'
Leather cover, heavy and gilded.  Clearly expensive and must have been a treasure.  Ink crept towards it's precious pages, Ron bent just in time to save it from being ruined forever.  He turned it in his hands, brushing stone dust from the cover.
'We have to move.'  Harry told him, getting Draco to his feet.  'Filch will be back.  Come on, it's okay, I'll explain it to you.'
Crying would not solve anything.  But the sight of Draco in his bed, blankets wrapped around him, shielding him from the chill of the evening, the book that meant the world to him resting on his legs, pages open, his finger on the start of a chapter, was more than he could stand.
They'll find you.'  A whisper laced with panic.  'They will kill you.'
'Yeah, sure.'  Ron didn't attempt to hide his disappointment.
Harry didn't speak, he couldn't find the words.
More asked, more wanted their turn with the boy in the Cell.
'Yes, you did.'  His cracked lips managed a tiny smile.  'You are with...with me now.'
'I'll be down in a bit.'  Harry called out, hoping that it would be enough to send them all down to the great hall without him.  'Don't eat all the bacon.'
They lost.
'Theo!  You can't.'  Milly exclaimed.  'Not now, not after everyone saw what you did, and what Potter did to you.  McGonagall is going to be demanding the truth, and we can't lie to her.  There have already been too many lies.'
He figured that he would give it another ten minutes before heading back to his House.  The boy wearing the green crest of Slytherin, lounged against the cold wall, eyes casting around the deserted hall.  There was only so long that he could loiter outside the headmistress's office before he was seen, moved on, asked what on earth he was doing.
'It's okay, Draco.'  Harry whispered to him.  'You have no reason to be ashamed.  Don't even think it.'  Draco didn't hear him, too far gone in his memories.  'Don't do this to him.'  Harry looked to the two women.  'You are going to break him.'
He wanted to hunt down the man who had left him, the animal who had done this to Draco.  And tear out his disgusting throat.  With his bare hands. Harry knew he would take delight in killing the man, killing anyone who had hurt Draco.
'You should be resting.'  Harry answered, not turning around, afraid Draco would see his growing anger, his hopelessness.
Harry eased Draco's tired body into the chair ready for him.  Covering his legs with blankets, dropping one around his shoulders, leaning him back against the cushions.
This was a happy place, a place full of hope and ripe with expectation.
And Harry.  He stayed right where he was.  Sitting on the bed, watching Draco breathing, his hand never stopping in the steady stroke of Draco's dirty hair.
Hagrid had no love for the son of Lucius Malfoy, but even so, his heart twisted at the sight that befell him once he had reached Fang and the lump that had upset him so.
'Who are you, Harry?'  Ron spoke through the tears that clogged his throat.  His eyes were drawn to the wand that now lay dormant on the flagstones.  'I thought I knew you.  After all this time, I thought I had it all figured out.  But...but you keep secrets.  And I think you lie to me.'  He was quiet as he spoke.  The sadness in him overwhelming.  'We used to be such good friends, Harry.  When did it change?  Why did it have to change?'
'I...  It's the truth, Ron.  I'm bloody tired.'
His usually impeccable clothes were little more than tattered rags, hanging off a limp body.  This wasn't the Lucius Malfoy of old.  With his snaked topped cane and sleek hair, sly smile and air of superiority.
Why would Harry Potter, of all people, care about a Malfoy?  It was well known that there had never been any love lost between the constantly warring boys.  So much bad blood stood between them.  So many bruises and hexes and ferocious spells.  Fists and fights and arguments, detentions and bitter rivalry.
'Beg me, sweet prince.'
Standing her ground, her wand still upright and pointing at the empty ceiling, she watched coldly as her students scuttled away, watched as a group of Slytherins helped one of their own from the floor, watched as the youngest were encouraged from the destruction by older students, arms around shoulders and tissues pressed into little hands.
'No!'  Draco screamed, terrified.  'Don't...So...so dark...'
But what use was knowing it?  He couldn't cast it.
He walked away.
Harry opened the cover and began to read.
'Nothing is the matter, Harry.'  She gently guided him back inside the room with a careful hand on his arm.  She could feel him trembling beneath his robes.  'Draco is doing well, under the circumstances.'  Closing the door in case anyone should be passing, McGonagall urged Harry to sit at one of the desks.  'No, it is you I am concerned about.'
'Hagrid..?'  Harry shook, moving closer to the bed, terrified at what he would find.  'Who...Who did you find?'
'You can't excuse that.'
The Gryffindors kept to their word.
When had he last tasted water?
'And you?  Are you happy with it?'
He was being used.  For practice.  For pleasure.
'I have to be okay, Harry.  There is no other choice.'  There was that forced smile again.  'You were not in any classes today.'  Draco mumbled, drawing Harry's thoughts.
Harry was his home.
Hadn't his father had a distant cousin who had done the very same thing?  He could vaguely remember his parents talking about it in whispers over dinner one night.
'I...'  He was already stuttering, searching for an answer that Harry would believe.  'I wasn't expecting to see anyone out.  They...  They took me by surprise, that's all.'
'And ending to what?'
'Moving him should not cause any further harm, Minerva.'
'To the Great Hall.'  She demanded of her audience.  'Now!'
He shook the word away that wanted to escape.  He couldn't think like that.
'All this.  For dragging you into my mess.'  Harry could hear the break in Draco's voice, the promise of tears.  'You should go.  Go back to your friends.  Be...be happy.'
They lay facing each other, the charmed hot water bottle pressed between their bodies.  Harry's fear that Draco would indeed catch a chill had driven him from his knees, had helped Draco back into bed, and had seen him once again under the blankets of the little bed.
“We didn’t know you… had company,” she said. “We just…” she trailed off, and held up her hands instead.
He squeezed his eyes shut, his brain clear and bright after the few hours of sleep it had gotten. He didn’t want to be this conscious with
“Show me?” he asked. Potter sucked in a breath, his lips parting in surprise. But Draco forced himself not to panic. And if there was one thing Draco knew, it was self-control. For the first time in his life, he let himself want what he’d been wanting for years. He let himself want
Unlikely or not, Harry had never been happier. Draco was excellent in the kitchen, excellent in conversation, excellent in bed. He didn’t show genuine emotion often, but Harry could see Draco was just as committed as he was. Three months wasn’t a long time, but with Potters that was a lifetime. After all, his own parents had already been married at his age.
A knock sounded at the door.
Draco was now one of those people.
move in if Harry asked, except Harry couldn’t ask, not yet.
“I won’t, I’ll just bring him in instead,” he replied, referring to the other
, as he’d always been. A nose he found too sharp, lips he found too thin, eyes barely more than slits. He sighed, mussing up his hair to distract from the face he longed to trade in for one that looked less like his father’s. He pouted a bit, trying to find a handsome-enough angle, until he realized what he was doing and quickly stopped. There was no need to make
Potter looked up as well and frowned. “Yes. That.” He looked back down at Draco with the faintest trace of a smirk. “Perhaps not
It was a good arrangement. It kept Draco in check, in control, pretending. Unable to act on the things he refused to even think about.
Footsteps tentatively squeaked down the hallway and Harry scrambled to find a shirt. The living room was strewn with playing cards and candy wrappers and two chocolate frogs hopping over the sofa and a torn condom wrapper, but no shirts.
Immediately, Draco dropped Harry’s arm from where he’d been tugging it.
Harry was really, really excited about Valentine’s Day.
“Oh please, Draco, don’t bring him in there, it’s not safe,” his mother reprimanded. Draco didn’t even know why he was doing it, why he was bothering. To make the kid happy, he justified. Nothing at all to do with his desire to soften his image.
Finally, Harry said “What are you doing here?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Potter just laughed again, and turned down the heavy quilt on Draco’s bed. He took off his glasses and placed them on the nightstand, and Draco tried very hard not to be distracted by their proximity to his own belongings.
“Um, do you…” Potter started to ask, voice hesitant but hips no less persistent in their steady rhythm, sliding over his own so good. Draco knew vaguely there were spells for such occasions, but he’d yet an opportunity to learn them. And when he played with himself, he liked to take his time.
and it also meant
He also knew what kind of dream it was.
It was a little after eight, and after the two of them had finished their second round of sex, they found themselves on Harry’s living room carpet playing a game of Exploding Snap.
He wasn’t quite tired yet, so he took a book from the desk and dragged his armchair to the window. Losing track of time, immersing himself in the book, he didn’t look up until he heard his door open.
There was a long pause where nobody spoke and everybody avoided eye contact.
This was also a new version of Harry. He was getting so many of them lately. This one was rumpled, which was typical, and lazy, which was also typical, and happy, which was not.
“It would behoove you to use a silencing charm next time,” she said quietly, turning back to the table and smiling as if she didn’t just say the most mortifying words Draco had ever heard directed his way. “Luckily my room is above yours, and I believe my own wandwork is to thank for your discretion.” Everything in Draco was a fire of embarrassment. “Lucky, too, that I’m a light sleeper. Who knows who else would have woken up.”
Potter rolled over, turning to face him fully, looking up at Draco who was still leaning over him, still so close, on the other side of their ocean.
the noise was. As if it were in the same bed as him.
Potter swallowed hard, green eyes dipping, and Malfoy chided himself for thinking they were looking at his own lips.
, of all people.
He felt Harry get very still under his hand. “Isn’t you?” he asked quietly.
And whoever was at their door kept knocking.
Hermione glanced up at Ron, who was looking resolutely at the portrait of James and Lily in the back of the living room. She looked over at Draco, blushed, and then turned toward Harry.
Draco schooled his features into something polite and guarded, too.
Draco looked sharply up at his mother. Everything she had said was true, of course. The Manor
His mother stood in the doorway, and behind her, a very wide-eyed and stricken Harry Potter.
He thought them an unlikely pair, but when he’d said as much one evening a few weeks after they’d started dating, Draco had only scoffed.
“Good morning, Mrs. Malfoy,” Harry called back as Draco slipped from the bed. Suddenly feeling awkward, he tried to angle his body as modestly as he could, scraping up his pajama bottoms from the floor. “I’ll be ready in a minute.”
“I understand,” the head auror said, resting his hands on his hips. “Long flight or not, ma’am, that’s part of the job, but rest assured we’ll be back tomorrow morning.”
“I said no thinking.”
He was not great at this. In fact, with his ruined reputation Draco had not dared to touch another man since Hogwarts, and even back then it had only been simple fooling around when the girls weren’t putting out. A means to an end, where skill and technique didn’t matter as much as pure need. Still, a Malfoy was nothing if not very good at persuasion, and so Draco tried to make it seem like he was a quite proficient cocksucker.
Still tugging, Potter leaned down to bite at his neck, and then Draco couldn’t take it any longer. “Please,” he begged, weaving his own fingers through Potter’s messy curls. His other hand went down to cover Potter’s, stopping his movements. “Please,” he repeated.
Morning-after epilogue coming soon!
The fear didn’t dissipate, it only shifted. Because Harry knew that voice very, very well.
Most of the time it was great. No press, no judgement. No well-intentioned but horribly misplaced advice. Just Harry, able to make his own choices in private for once. And the delicious thrill of sneaking around.
“I enjoyed it, too,” he said, feeling itchy and hot.
Well. That was a first.
Potter’s breathing was labored, and Draco took pleasure in knowing he wasn’t the only one completely wrecked. But ever the Gryffindor, Potter found the power to gasp out full sentences whereas Draco was reduced to monosyllables.
Hermione stepped up next, offering a proper and amiable handshake.
He pushed Potter away with regret, and cursed his bed for being so large and his nightstand for being so far away. The mere moments it took for him to retrieve the elegant bottle were far too long.
Draco looked at him. His wild green eyes, his strong jaw. Features familiar and foreign. “This is weird,” he said, even through a smile.
But he didn’t. His hips were slow so as not to hurt Draco, but his fingers were pressing bruises into neck, his lips all but absent in the presence of his teeth instead. It wasn’t kind, but it was considerate, and that Draco could handle.
Lips ghosted over his ear as a whisper sang “
Draco cracked a wry smile. “You don’t want to know the scrutiny you’ll get dating Draco Malfoy.” Harry laughed, that bold bright laugh, the one reserved for his inner circle. “Now can you please get ready? You have a job to do, after all.”
But even two years after the War, Harry was popular as ever, and he wasn’t yet ready to break their bubble with photographers and journalists and angry letters sent to the editor.
The thought of all
“Mmmalfoy,” Potter gasped. All at once his body went rigid, and Draco felt him wake up beneath his fingers. Potter looked back at him, green eyes wide in the moonlight. “Malfoy?” he questioned, face flushed and lips parted. Draco felt that feeling back in his chest, the one he tried to ignore. The one that was clawing its way out right now.
Like they were now.
Potter tried to protest again. “I—”
Green like staring at the back of his head during Charms. Green like throwing hexes at him from across the hall. Green like memorizing his schedule. Like watching him fly past the common room window during his practices. Like shoving fist into shoulder, like throwing boot into nose.
Two years ago he’d been somewhere in the Scottish countryside chasing after a horcrux he couldn’t even name.
“Hopefully not weird enough where it won’t happen again,” Harry said, wrapping a hand around Draco’s wrist and pulling. Draco let himself be led into the warmth of Harry’s body, tucking his nose into Harry’s neck. He was too tired to care about the weirdness. “Now let me sleep. I’ve got your messes to clean up in the morning.”
Morning arrived with a flurry of sparks exploding from Draco’s nightstand.
The two of them looked at each other, and then Hermione said “Why not.”
“Yes, Weasel, I believe it is,” Draco answered.
“Fancy that. We’ve only been together three months and already I’ve entirely undone your posh upbringing. If it weren’t for that beautiful hair no one would believe you’re a Malfoy.”
“It’s okay. I didn’t work as hard as the others today,” he demurred. But he did take off his uniform robe, revealing well-fitted jeans and a crisp button-down. Perhaps not such a schoolboy after all.
“Get off of me!”
She held up a hand to stop him. “I’m sorry,” she conceded. “I didn’t mean to insult you. I was simply making an observation.” Her voice was so soft and yet so powerful. Even with a wrinkled face, tired and full of sorrow, Narcissa Malfoy could make a room bend to its knees. “I know it’s a long flight back to London, and if it’s all the same to you, I’d rather you didn’t apparate or use the floo network. After all, we’re trying to seal up the house, aren’t we?”
But she was smiling pleasantly at the group of aurors. Men and women she had fought against in the war, wizards and witches who had shown her mercy, people that she, too, was now trying to please in this new version of herself she was building.
But like Draco, she didn’t respond either. She only smiled that knowing smile, and insisted Harry open his basket of treats.
And Draco had watched Harry these past four years excel at a job he had been chasing. Watched him shove cameras and reporters out of his face. He had watched him all through school, snarking back at professors and refusing dates and insisting on breaking rules. And Draco knew Harry never did anything he didn’t want to. And Draco suddenly felt a lifetime of desire bubble up into the safe and willing hands of Harry Potter.
“Yes,” Draco breathed out. Yes to anything, anything Potter wanted.
wake up,” Draco hissed, digging his nails into the flesh under his palm.
“Bathroom’s this way,” he said, walking around his bed and gesturing to one of the closed and ornate doors. But Potter only held up a hand.
at the Muggle Center.”
Lunch arrived, and although his mother offered to make something for the team, only Draco followed her into the kitchen. Teddy and Andromeda were already waiting at the table, reminding Draco of his life outside the big dusty hall. Reminding him that he had taken off work this week to spend more time with his oddity of a cousin, reminding him that they had plans to go to the zoo tomorrow, reminding him that his life was carrying on even amidst the stress of the attacks that hit the Manor. The stress he had been refusing to acknowledge until today, until the possibility of enduring them forever in the failure of the aurors work became increasingly more likely.
Still, they had seen enough of each other. Potter was always a guest at Longbottom’s dinners. And Diagon Alley only had so many taverns. Every so often their paths would cross, and they’d greet each other with a nod or a forced smile.
“Blame it on the firewhiskey,” he said.
“I will not,” Draco said simply, because
It was easy after that, after the initial tension had been broken. True to his word, Draco went back to his armchair and picked up his book again, although he was quite tired himself. Still, far better to blearily attempt to read than to tuck himself under the covers alongside Potter. No, he’d wait until the other man was fully unconscious before he underwent the mortifying ordeal of sharing his bed.
“Would you—” Draco blurted. All eyes turned toward him. He ducked his chin, but continued. “If you’d like, you can stay for a drink or two. If you’d like.”
But soon enough he was lying on his back, in his childhood bedroom — surrounded by stories hand-painted in Latin over gold molding, and carved chests bearing his ancestors’ family crests, and an honest-to-goodness marble bust of some distant relative — with his knees pulled up to his chest, presenting himself to Harry fucking Potter.
When Harry leaned in, Draco met him halfway.
“Well this is certainly… unexpected,” she said.
The strangled noise that came in response didn’t help his wandering imagination, but then someone spoke. “Is that mum’s jumper?”
“I was,” Potter replied. His eyes were so green.
“I’m here to help,” Potter explained, using a voice Draco had never heard him use. “You know all those bumps in the night?” Teddy nodded, tugging himself closer to Potter’s chest. “Well I’m here to make them go away.”
One of the witches threw him a glance. Of all the aurors she seemed the most sympathetic, and it wasn’t until Draco had caught the little house crest tattooed inside her wrist that he realized she was a Slytherin, and well-familiar with stigma and exile. Now, she casually walked past Draco, careful not to seem too considerate, and spoke more to the window than to him.
“Mother—” Draco started, but she only held up a hand.
Harry’s chuckle exploded into a laugh, as genuine as his grin had been before. But he didn’t say anything else, just drove his body into Draco’s, drove Draco’s body into the mattress.
His father had gone ballistic after the match, threatening to revoke his generous donation of brooms if Slytherin lost to Gryffindor again. But his mother had cut the photograph from the newspaper and proudly framed it. And for some reason, although Draco had swapped pictures of Hogsmede for London, family portraits for friends, he had never changed that particular photo. It was yellowing and crinkled, but still just as vivacious as those two boys had been some ten years ago.
these days when his standard was verbal abuse and condescension) or if maybe it had something to do with his slipup in using Potter’s first name. But then his whole face relaxed into a smile and he chuckled a bit.
He tried making new friends. It wasn’t easy – he was still
—” Draco was palming him now – “I want – if you want, that is, I would want…”
“Faster,” he commanded. Harry obeyed.
were not words he usually used to describe Potter’s glances toward him. Normally they were
Later, in the darkness of the reptile room, hidden from the world, looking at the flying lizards, Harry touched the inside of his wrist, and Draco felt like that better version of himself was finally taking shape.
Because Harry and Draco were still keeping their relationship a secret.
Draco leaned in, and sucked.
Harry laughed and shifted closer to Draco. “Oh please,” he said. “As if you haven’t noticed me eyefucking you every time we crossed paths in Diagon Alley. Or, Merlin, how much I stared at you during Neville’s holiday party!” Draco just stared at him, and watched his face slowly fall. “Oh, Draco,” Harry whispered. “Did you not notice?”
Thankfully, they made it to Flitwick’s office without running into any students. Harry thanked his lucky stars none of his friends had come looking for him only to see his arm around Malfoy, almost dragging him forward with every step. He wasn’t sure how to explain to them that he had not only cursed Draco Malfoy to the point of possibly endangering his life, but also had no idea how to take it back and needed to seek a professor for help. Madam Pomfrey had instructed Harry to escort Malfoy back to the infirmary after meeting Flitwick to rest for the remainder of the school day, so Harry still had to stick around Malfoy for a little bit after Flitwick (hopefully) helps them resolve the curse.
Thanks for reading!
“That’s too bad, you look just like one!”
“Why?” He choked out, trying not to break eye contact with the boy who has the upper hand.
“Oh dear, what’s the matter with him?” Madam Pomfrey clucked as she helped Harry support Malfoy towards an empty bed upon seeing the two enter the ward.
“Oh yes? List them then! Let’s hear about all the wonderful things you’ve done,” He paused for a second, feigning listening carefully before resuming his taunt, “That’s right, nothing.”
“You didn’t die this time either, potions boy. Now shut up and let’s get you to Madam Pomfrey.”
“Soulbond?” Harry mused, wondering how the spell he’d found highlighted on a random scroll he picked up could have been this powerful.
As Draco leaned on him, his frigid skin meeting Harry’s warm one, he breathed a small sigh of content, closing his eyes and allowing himself to relax. Harry then realised that long scars ran up and down Draco’s back. They looked like they were whip marks. Most of them had faded away but a few were rather prominent and visible. Harry supposed Draco could feel his eyes on his back because he answered Harry’s unasked question.
be his fault, could it?
He wondered if he should have felt more upset that he’d potentially just ruined his friendship with the two people who he’d cared about the most. His own apathy towards the situation surprised him. They’ve had fights before, of course, but one of them usually sided with Harry. This was the first time he’d been left completely alone.
“Honky? You may clear my breakfast tray.”
Harry’s sheets were soaked with sweat, his blanket tangled up around his legs due to his incessant struggling. He was suffering from his nightmares again. Ephialtes that plagued his mind every night, terrorising him and depriving him of respite.
“Nope. I just need to take a shower. I smell of the hospital wing and funky potions.”
He didn’t know what to do now that the fate of the wizarding world wasn’t hanging on a quest Dumbledore had sent him on, and he figured that drowning himself in school life would at least help distract himself from his traumatic memories of the War and his inner demons, even if it was a temporary escape. Everyone he was close to had chosen to move on, and it seemed like he was the only one stuck in the past reliving the war. His ‘victory’ was nothing more than a nuisance to him, leaving him with no clue of the purpose of his life after he had already defeated a villain that had plagued his mind since he was eleven.
“I never wanted you to die, Malfoy! Hell, I’ve never even wished anything painful unto you, all that blood was probably just the spell’s fault.” Harry refuted.
The harsh coughing stopped after another minute. Ron must have managed to swallow his food, Harry realised. As Ron took a moment to recover, Harry reconsidered his friends’ words about Malfoy.
Harry was frozen after seeing Draco run out. His thoughts weren’t processing at first, but once he snapped back to reality, he darted after Malfoy, ignoring Slughorn’s exclamation of protests. It didn’t matter, Harry thought, he was Slughorn’s favourite student anyway and will be able to get away with this.
Harry stumbled along with the rest of the students to Hogwarts, the once flawless castle structure crumbling in certain places, still in the process of getting repaired. It did, however, look much better than it did the last time Harry had seen it. The castle’s familiar smells brought back a myriad of memories and Harry took a deep breath to steady himself before following the crowd into the school’s entrance.
Unsurprisingly, Malfoy let out a yell as well, thoroughly freaked out by the little girl. Harry put a finger to his lips and whispered, “It’s alright, I’m helping him. Now, run along and don’t tell anyone you saw us, alright?”
Slughorn waltzed off, rambling about the tonic and its properties. A light tap on Harry’s shoulder made him turn to his side. It was a Gryffindor he didn’t personally know. His name was probably Murphy or something like that if Harry remembered correctly.
“Hey, Harry?”
“Indigestion.
A loud ‘crack’ rattled both of them as Honkey Apparated into the room with two lavish dinner trays of steaming beef and other sumptuous delights. The two boys quickly moved apart, splashing water everywhere as the house-elf squeaked an apology.
That was Harry’s breaking point. The outright scornfulness in Hermione’s tone didn’t sit right with Harry. The trio had never had anything close to a friendship with Draco Malfoy before, but even Harry had never expressed this much hate for him unreasonably. Harry forced a smile and hastily stood up, storming off to the bathroom and replying with “Excuse me for just a moment” when his friends asked where he was going. He wasn’t in the mood to speak to anyone until he figured out why sudden anger was boiling inside him.
As he stood still among the bustling crowd, he watched as couples lovingly held each other’s hands, pecked each other on the forehead whilst giggling and sharing jokes. How painfully beautiful.
To prove the point, Malfoy immediately started spouting his story of headaches and blood in napkins to Flitwick who looked amazed at his inability to hear Malfoy’s words. “Oh, forgive my excitement, boys! It’s just that this may be the first time I’ve encountered anyone under this kind of soul bond.”
Draco scoffed and rolled his eyes, reading the instructions in their textbook again. Harry could be so doltish at times, he mused. He didn’t notice it but Harry’s eyes were on him throughout the entire lesson.
Harry grimaced, not knowing whether he should laugh or try to help his friend. Hermione reacted before Harry could make a decision, reaching over to thump Ron’s back with a look of concern on her face.
