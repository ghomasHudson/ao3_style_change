‘You’re a good player, from what I hear,’ Malfoy said, and Harry wondered where Malfoy had heard that. Had he been following Harry’s career?
‘Well,’ Harry pauses, before continuing, ‘I could pay for dinner, if you’d like?’
Ginny had told the Weasleys that first night—no one could ever keep a secret from Molly, especially if it was about something that was upsetting one of her children—so Harry was spared the agony of having to tell them that he was leaving their daughter, but he still felt like he needed to speak to them himself, so one day he Apparated over to the Burrow, sick to his stomach with nerves. Molly had cried throughout his visit, and Arthur had been colder than he usually was, but as Harry was leaving after making awkward conversation over his cup of tea and cake, Molly pulled him into a hug and made him promise not to stay away for too long. He’d been terrified that by leaving Ginny he might be losing the closest thing he had to family, but he left the Burrow with a warm kernel of hope lodged in his heart that one day, once the dust had settled, he might be able to come back.
Harry turned to Draco, his eyes wide. ‘It feels… it’s so much
? Interesting choice of mug,’ Draco said, one eyebrow raised as he waved the offending mug in Harry’s direction. It had a large, extremely unflattering photo of Harry on it to accompany the words from the Ministry’s famous poster.
And yet each week when Friday came, Harry headed to the pub, aware that he stood no chance of resisting Malfoy, and not caring anyway. Malfoy might not give any indication of his interest in Harry during the week, their interactions at work strictly professional, but once they were at the pub everything changed. Harry would make a point to sit far away from Malfoy and try and make conversation with the rest of his colleagues, pretending to be interested in the latest office gossip and Quidditch matches, all the while covertly glancing over at Malfoy, need growing with each look, each flash of lust in Malfoy’s eyes as their gaze met across the table.
‘Come with me,’ he blurted, turning to stride off the dancefloor before he could stop and talk himself out of what he was about to do.
‘What’s wrong?’ Draco said, moving closer so that he was stood within arm’s reach of Harry.
‘They’re beautiful,’ Harry said honestly.
‘Of course I want to see you,’ Harry said, shifting slightly in a wordless invitation for Malfoy to come in.
‘Can I kiss you, Draco?’ Harry says finally, and Draco can only nod.
‘Not really, you’re very boring. I expected more from Dickhead no 1,’ Draco teased, his heart skipping when Harry came up behind him and wrapped his arms around him, his chest warm and solid against Draco’s back.
‘You’re a League champion now, Harry. The celebrations are only just beginning.’
Harry picks up speed, his hips moving faster and harder, and soon they’re fucking properly. It’s nothing they haven’t done before, but it’s somehow different this time. Draco can’t look away from Harry’s face, and Harry doesn’t turn away either. Draco doesn’t know what his face is giving away, but Harry’s expression is tender, his eyes full of something that Draco hopes might be love. Draco’s never had sex with someone he loves before, and if this is what it’s like, he doesn’t think he can ever go back. It’s like magic, sparking around them and drawing them closer together, making every sensation
‘Fuck!’ Harry swore loudly as he used his arms to push himself off his hospital bed and onto his feet. His legs were wobbly from lack of use, and his hip protested as he put weight through it for the first time since his accident.
‘Shouldn’t you be off drinking, rather than napping?’ came an amused voice from the doorway to the locker room. The sound of the door closing gently was followed by quiet footsteps, and Harry opened his eyes to see Draco walking over to him.
Esther didn’t get a chance to do anything more than smile back at Harry as at that moment the door swung open again, Malfoy striding through it. Now that they’d been pointed out, the dark circles under his eyes stood out dramatically to Harry, although his attention was almost immediately drawn away to the frown that Malfoy was sporting.
Harry bit back a smile as Hermione shot a frustrated but fond look at Ron. Their bickering occasionally drove him mad, but at times like these, when he was stuck in a strange sterile hospital room, listening to them felt comforting, like a little bit of home. Harry was pulled out of his thoughts suddenly by Ron swearing loudly.
The sound of Millie shuffling in place brought them back to earth, Harry suddenly remembering where he was. His face flushing, he hurriedly pulled on his clothes, adjusting himself to hide the effect Draco had had on him, before turning to face Millie. He thanked her profusely for her help, and confirmed when he would come for his next fitting. He didn’t say anything to Draco. It was cowardly, and he knew it, but he felt raw, exposed, and like he might break if they had to acknowledge what had passed between them. Instead, he muttered some vague excuse about being late for dinner, and quickly left the shop, Apparating home as soon as he could.
It was the best sex of Harry’s life, and it took him several minutes to come back to earth, listening to Draco’s breathing slow as aftershocks racked his body. The faint sounds of the orchestra could be heard from below, reminding Harry of where they were, how easily someone could discover them in such a compromising position. He didn’t want to move, reluctant to move away from Draco, not wanting to stop touching him, but Draco was shifting underneath him now, so Harry sighed and stood up, spelling them both clean and praying that his robes weren’t ruined beyond repair. Once they were both less dishevelled, Harry turned to Draco, wanting to know where they stood now but worried about what Draco might say. Luckily for Harry, Draco broke the silence first.
‘Any spell in particular?’ Harry asked, pulling his wand out of his pocket.
‘Okay,’ Harry said slowly, thinking. At first, he’d talked about his nightmares, too. Ron and Hermione had sat with him through many nights, holding him as he shook and told them haltingly what he’d dreamed about. But then, as the nightmares had gradually reduced in frequency, he’d found ways to cope on his own. He’d pace, or listen to the wireless to try and distract himself, or simply get up, condemning himself to a day of yawning and weariness with the hope that at least he’d be too tired to have a nightmare the following night. He’d got used to coping that way, but maybe he could try talking again.
A silence fell, less contented than their previous periods of silence. The atmosphere around them positively crackled with tension as Harry looked at Draco, waiting for his response. Draco knew this was it, the moment where he could take a risk and potentially get everything he wanted.
‘You know what it is, you’re the one who did it!’ Potter thrusts the parchment towards Draco.
involved in the trial might detract attention from the case and potentially affect their chances of securing a conviction, but I thought I should probably let you know.’
Draco is still melting over Harry’s words when Harry begins to press into him, the stretch delicious as his body adjusts to the feeling of Harry inside him. He fights the urge to let his eyes close—he wants to watch Harry’s face. Harry’s eyelids flutter as he enters Draco, his mouth falling open on a silent moan, and all Draco can think is how beautiful he is. Harry reaches for Draco’s hands, moving them above Draco’s head before interlocking their fingers. It’s the perfect combination of tenderness and control.
Once all the customers had been plied with hot drinks and freshly baked biscuits and muffins, their faces much happier than when they had rushed into the cafe, rain dripping from coats and noses, Draco was free to contemplate the mystery that was Harry Potter. He was currently ensconced in one of the big squishy armchairs that Draco had placed near the fireplace, a book propped open on his knee as he slowly sipped at his drink. Draco couldn’t believe he hadn’t finished it yet -  he’d expected Harry to down it and escape the cafe as soon as possible, but Harry didn’t look like he would be moving any time soon. He’d removed his coat, the merrily crackling fire presumably chasing away the chill from outside, and once again the sight of him in a t-shirt was doing funny things to Draco’s insides.
‘I—’ Malfoy started, then paused. ‘Tonight was good, Potter,’ he said eventually, to Harry’s great surprise. They never talked like this.
Still, it was with relief that Draco Apparated them all back to Andromeda’s once Teddy and Harry had had their fill of the valley. Harry hurriedly brushed off all of Andromeda’s exhortations to stay for dinner, flashing a secret smile at Draco as he said he had somewhere to be. They didn’t even discuss it, they both knew what they wanted to happen. Harry took Draco’s hand and Apparated, Andromeda’s cottage vanishing, replaced by Harry’s street.
‘I was, uh—I was thinking, maybe I’ll come back?’ Potter says, to Draco’s great surprise. He looks nervous, fiddling with his fingers, a line forming between his eyebrows as he frowns.
Things between Harry and Draco lightened after that conversation, as though sharing something personal about themselves that they happened to have in common had finally thawed the little ice that had remained between them. Harry continued to accompany Draco and Teddy on their trips, and soon it was just assumed that the three of them would of course be going together. Draco began to bear Harry in mind when planning the next outing, trying to think of things Harry would enjoy or aspects of pure-blood culture he might be interested in learning about—it was partly his history too, after all.
‘Agnes was talking about her son at bridge this week, and he’s hired a tutor to teach his son, as his career doesn’t allow him time—he spends so much time abroad, you know, in his diplomatic role.’
Draco chatted away about the weather, the cold and the early sunsets as Harry walked in to the back room, letting Draco’s comments wash over him as he looked round, taking in the shop. The front room was lined with clothes rails, displaying a huge range of clothing, from formal robes and dresses to warm looking tailored coats and some tiny children’s outfits in the softest, brightest fabric. The backroom was a different story. Clearly this was where the bespoke pieces were created. Large mirrors lined three of the walls, with the fourth covered in shelves containing more fabric than Harry had ever seen in his life. There were so many colours, some shimmering with a faint glow of magic, and so many textures, Harry’s fingers itching to run across them to see if they felt as wonderful as they looked. But before he could go over and explore, a voice broke him out of his contemplation of the shelves.
‘So, are you going to tell me what colour yours are then?’ Draco said, exasperated.
‘I didn’t know if you’d come.’
With a gasp, Harry forced himself to stop kissing Malfoy, their foreheads coming to rest against each other’s as they fought to catch their breath. Need was wound up in Harry, overtaking all rational parts of his brain that might tell him to stop, and Merlin, he wanted this, consequences be damned, but he had to know that Malfoy did too.
‘Yes.’ Potter’s tone brooks no disagreement, and Draco is powerless to resist.
It hadn’t bothered Draco—he’s used to not having much information about his clients—but now that he’s here, waiting for them to arrive, there’s a flutter of nervous anticipation in his stomach as he wonders who will walk through the door into his suite. His clients are a real range, no common thread linking them other than a desire for companionship for the night. The hotel he works for is good at vetting them, so he’s never worried for his safety, and he knows they’re good for the money. The anticipation comes instead from not knowing what they’ll want from him, what role he’ll have to play. He loves it all, has done ever since the post-war hostility made him turn to this career.
‘So, Harry,’ Millie said, gesturing for him to stand in the centre of the room. ‘I hear you’ve offered to take Draco to the ball?’
Hands still interlinked, Draco began to walk down the hill, heading towards the valley, Teddy skipping along beside them, his eyes wide as he tried to look at everything at once. Draco hadn’t told Harry or Teddy why they were here, or what they would find, and as they walked, he kept looking over to them, waiting for the moment when they would feel it for the first time.
‘How come he recovered so fast?’ Harry prompted. ‘What did you do?’
‘Anyway,’ Pansy continues, disrupting his thoughts. ‘It doesn’t really matter—I’ve spoken to Manon.’
‘Well, I’m glad you did become a Healer,’ Harry said eventually. ‘Even if that’s just me being selfish because you’re going to get me flying sooner,’ he added with a grin.
Skipping the pub on Fridays was the hardest part. Harry knew he couldn’t go—he’d be powerless to resist the temptation to meet Malfoy in their alleyway—but sitting at home, imagining what they could be doing if they hadn’t been discovered was harder than Harry expected. Every Friday he waved goodbye to his colleagues, ignoring their pleas to join them at the pub and studiously not looking at Malfoy, then headed home, where he proceeded to down several beers while lying on the sofa, wondering whether Malfoy was thinking about him too.
‘I take it you still see them a lot, then?’
The worst time was at night, though. Each evening Harry fell into bed exhausted and desperate for sleep, but instead ended up lying in bed for hours, staring at his dark ceiling, consumed by thoughts of Malfoy. Their kiss played on repeat over and over in Harry’s mind until he practically burned with desire, every cell in his body vibrating with need. Even when he finally fell asleep it was no better. Malfoy featured in every dream, his body hot under Harry’s as they lost hours exploring one another. In Harry’s dreams, Malfoy was unbelievably responsive, his moans low in Harry’s ear as they moved together, pushing each other to higher and higher peaks of pleasure. Without fail, Harry awoke hard and aching, desperate to have Malfoy’s hands on him.
and immediately ended up with pages and pages of Google results. He scrolled through them all, making a note of places that seemed interesting enough to capture Teddy’s imagination. He’d soon filled a page of his notebook with ideas, and resolved to take Teddy to one of them the following weekend.
Harry had never seen Malfoy look so unsure of himself, and the unexpected vulnerability made it easy for Harry to be honest for once.
‘It will be for a few days, but the exercises should help. If you keep doing them for the next few days you should start to feel an improvement.’
‘Now, surely you of all people know him well enough to know he wouldn’t do that. And besides,’ Esther continued, looking intently at Harry, a twinkle in her eye, ‘he might be tired, but he’s happier than I’ve ever seen him.’
‘Draco?’ Harry interrupted Draco’s thoughts, and he sighed, deciding that he wouldn’t lie, he couldn’t lie to Harry. Something about him made Draco want to be honest for once.
Brief respite came in the form of dinner being delivered. Harry set to eating his fish pie with gusto, so grateful for something to break up the monotony of staring at the plain walls that he didn’t even care that the sauce was so thin it was essentially water and that the fish was chewy enough to make his jaw ache. As soon as the food was gone though, the boredom came roaring back with a vengeance, a pit of dread forming in Harry’s stomach at the prospect of the long, silent night that stretched ahead of him.
Harry waved his wand as they entered the room, the lamps on the bedside tables flaring into life, and then dropped it, not caring where it rolled away to, when he felt Malfoy’s hands at his flies. Malfoy’s practiced fingers soon had Harry’s jeans pushed down to his thighs, and Harry rushed to help, stripping them and his boxers off, leaving him bare. At that, Malfoy paused, his eyes roaming over Harry’s bared skin, and Harry let him look for a moment, then reached out and undid Malfoy’s trousers, needing to see him too, to discover everything that the dark alley had hidden from him.
‘What do you think of these?’ She held the fabrics out to Harry, letting him touch them, feel the silky softness.
‘That’s all you needed to say,’ Draco crows, before they both lapse into silence. It’s a comfortable silence, not like after the last time they did this, and Draco starts to drift, not quite asleep but not quite awake either.
In true Pansy style, she doesn’t give Draco any warning of her visit, instead turning up on his doorstep one afternoon, matching luggage in hand.
too.’
‘No!’ Draco blurted out, blushing involuntarily at the force of his exclamation. ‘I mean, it’s fine, I can make you a quick drink.’
Harry’s cock throbbed almost painfully in his trousers at Draco’s words and the heated expression on his face. Even after nearly five months of dating, he couldn’t get enough of Draco. He wanted him all the time, wanted to be around him all the time. The discovery of Draco’s flirty, dirty side, had only made it harder to resist him, and Draco had quickly learnt that nothing got Harry hotter than when he teased him like that.
Malfoy paused, his eyes intent as he looked at Harry.
And then Potter is gone, the sound of the door shutting behind him echoing in the silence of the hotel room, and Draco just stands there, naked, come drying itchily on his skin, a strange sadness creeping into his soul.
‘It feels a lot better,’ Harry said, placing his wrist in Malfoy’s outstretched hand. Malfoy’s palm was cool against Harry’s skin, and Harry felt the hairs on his arm stand on end, his skin prickling with awareness. Malfoy hummed as he turned Harry’s hand over, his fingers gentle as they examined Harry’s newly healed bones. Harry couldn’t look away from Malfoy’s elegant hands on his arm.
Through a pleasure-filled haze, he feels Harry stiffen and come too, his body shaking above Draco. After a final few thrusts, Harry’s weight drops fully onto Draco and he releases Draco’s hands. Draco strokes up and down Harry’s back as they both sink into the afterglow, long moments passing where the only sound is their gradually slowing breathing. Harry’s almost crushing Draco, and he’s hot and sticky and sweaty, but Draco doesn’t care at all.
‘Save it, Harry,’ Ginny interrupted his apologies. ‘The curse I can get, just, although you should have told me. But you didn’t, and you kept going. You kept seeing him, fucking him, falling for him, and said nothing to me, expecting me to not notice anything, like I wouldn’t notice my husband avoiding me.’ Ginny’s voice got louder as she spoke until she was shouting again.
written large above a photo of them on their wedding day, smiling as they looked at each other. Everyone in the wizarding world would know by now. Harry tried not to think too much about who exactly that included, tried not to wonder what their reaction would be.
Malfoy gave as good as Harry was giving, pressing Harry back against the rough brick wall, his hand in Harry’s hair and his hips grinding against Harry’s, leaving Harry in no doubt that Malfoy was as into this as Harry was. All the sensible parts of Harry’s brain switched off as he gave himself over to feeling, letting himself be swept away with the movements of Malfoy’s mouth and hips. Too soon, Harry was moaning into every kiss and pressing into Malfoy’s body, the feel of Malfoy’s erection against his own bringing him to the brink even through their clothes.
and his unreasonable demands, Harry changed the subject.
His mind is racing at a million miles an hour as he tries to process the fact that Potter booked an appointment with a whore. He had no inkling of Potter’s preference for men—he’s apparently done a very good job of keeping that out of the press. But however confused and taken aback Draco might be by Potter’s sudden appearance, he can’t deny the small, flickering flame of interest that’s springing to life.
A glowing arctic fox burst out of the tip of his wand, immediately beginning to prowl, looping around them in a wide circle, eyes locked on the stag in apparent curiosity rather than fear. The three of them stood and watched, silent and awed, as the fox and the stag moved closer together, circling until they met, each sniffing the other warily. They seemed to decide that there was no threat, and then they were running, jumping, playing, together in the wide expanse of the valley, their silvery light bright against the dark green grass.
‘What is it?’ Harry asked.
‘I—.’ Draco doesn’t know what to say. He doesn’t know whether to tell her the truth, or where he would start if he did. But he can’t lie to Pansy, and part of him is desperate to talk about it, to share his turmoil with someone else. So he says it.
‘I’m not trying to be mysterious, you dick,’ Harry said, before sighing and messing up his hair even further with one hand. ‘Fine,’ Harry sighed. ‘I quit the Aurors, a few days before I first came here.’
‘I put some owl treats out for Aurora, but can pop back ‘round in a few days if you’re still here,’ Hermione said, and Harry felt a surge of love for her and Ron for taking such good care of him even after all these years. He didn’t know where he’d be without them.
He just can’t face seeing him again, not yet. Not when he knows he won’t be able to hide how he’s feeling, and when watching Potter leave will break him again.
‘He’s a bit excitable today, just to warn you.’ Andromeda chuckled. ‘Harry took him out this morning, and he had far too much sugar.’
Malfoy appeared not long after ten thirty, once again clad in his Healer’s robes. He set down another beaker of Skele-Gro, and then pulled a chair up to Harry’s bed, just as he had the night before.
‘Harry,’ Draco pants after long minutes of this. ‘
Harry nodded, tucking away the fact that Malfoy seemed to be aware of the details of his career to be examined later. Even though Malfoy hadn’t named names, Harry knew exactly who he was talking about. McFadden’s fall was legendary in the sport, both for how terrible it had been—he still held the record for highest ever fall, by quite some margin—and for how quickly he’d recovered. Harry hadn’t realised that Malfoy had been the Healer responsible for that impressive recovery.
He pulls back, Potter’s cock throbbing and twitching slightly as he lets go of it entirely.
‘Don’t say things like that, you know it’s not true,’ he retorted, more bluntly than he would normally dare to speak to his mother. ‘And I’m not doing it, I already told you I can’t.’
‘And why on Earth would that lead to us going together?’
The message had been as blunt and vague as always;
‘She clearly decided it was worth the risk, and for good reason,’ Malfoy said, twisting so that he could look at Harry. ‘You were right, it turns out.’
The uncharacteristic sound of Draco swearing made Harry look up. Draco hardly ever swore - Harry could count on his fingers the number of times he’d heard a swear word escape from Draco during the 10 years they’d been Auror partners - so something dramatic had obviously happened. And yet, when Harry looked over to Draco’s desk, his partner was just sat looking at what seemed to be an invitation. Surely that couldn’t have elicited such a reaction.
Ron didn’t look convinced at all, and he still looked like he was about to storm out to the mediwizard station and kick up a fuss until Harry was assigned a different Healer. Desperate to avoid a scene that would inevitably lead to headlines about the
‘Turn around,’ Draco murmured, pulling off Harry’s cock and dropping kisses on the sharp jut of Harry’s hipbone. Harry could hear the edge of lust in Draco’s voice, despite the sound of the water raining down on them. Powerless to resist, Harry did as Draco said, turning around and planting his hands on the cool wall. He groaned as Draco’s hands cupped his arse, then gasped as they pulled his cheeks apart and a tongue swept from his balls up his crease. The touch was gentle, teasing rather than forceful, but it still sent a powerful pang of need through Harry, and he shamelessly tilted his arse back in a wordless plea for more. He closed his eyes as Draco began to lick over and over Harry’s hole, his nerve endings alight with pleasure. It was all too much, the sensation of the water coursing over his skin and Draco’s wicked tongue combining to drive Harry higher and higher, and all too soon he was teetering on the edge.
Draco nodded. ‘It was an important, significant moment in my childhood, and shaped my understanding of magic—made me love it, even. How could you not after feeling it in every part of your being? And I wanted Teddy to have that, that deep down love of magic and the sense of wonder that feeling it like this will give him.’
‘Good morning, Mr—Mr Potter,’ she said, her voice shaking slightly. ‘I’m Grace Barnett, a Trainee Healer here at St Mungo’s. Healer Malfoy is in charge of my training. He’s asked me to help him with your case.’
‘No,’ Draco replied. ‘When we were forced to retreat into the shadows, the pure-blood families kept the knowledge of this location a secret. In those days there were fears that the magic could be stolen from the ground, or that if all the magical places were built over we might lose our abilities all together. So they kept it quiet, never publicising it, quietly bringing their children when they got old enough and swearing them to secrecy too.’
‘Well,’ he said, clearing his throat slightly. ‘I suppose I should go. Astoria will be waiting for me.’ Harry didn’t miss the way Malfoy didn’t meet his eyes as he mentioned his wife.
‘Yes, of course.’ Malfoy looked almost affronted at the idea that he might still be harbouring a fear of Muggles. ‘As I became more comfortable in the Muggle world I began to interact with them more and more, even made some friends. Everything my father had told me about Muggles was a lie, and I won’t pretend that wasn’t hard to come to terms with, even though deep down I’d known it for a while.’
They never discussed it, never made official plans, but by unspoken agreement, several hours into the evening, one of them would excuse themself from the group, heading for the alley, the other following soon after. Harry didn’t know which way round he preferred, waiting in the alley for Malfoy to join him, anticipation building in his gut, or going out to meet Malfoy, enduring those long minutes waiting in the pub to avoid suspicion by imagining what Malfoy might have in store for him.
Harry nodded determinedly and took another step forward, Malfoy’s arm still supporting him, his body warm where it pressed along Harry’s side. It took a lot longer than it usually would, and far more concentration than Harry was used to expending on walking a few steps, but eventually they made it to the armchairs, Malfoy leaving his arm around Harry the whole way. Harry sank into the armchair with a loud groan, partly at the twinge in his hip as he sat down, but partly at the blissful relief of being sat in a proper chair rather than lying in bed.
‘Rose?’
But Harry couldn’t dwell on that now, nor on the fact that the injury had been caused in a chase very similar to this. He had to beat Farrell and the Magpies, and he had to do it now. He dodged to the right to avoid one of the Magpies’ Chasers, the world turning upside down as he barrel-rolled, and then urged his broom forward as he righted himself. Farrell was still just behind him, and Harry knew he would take advantage of any moment of weakness or hesitation from Harry. Harry’s thighs ached from where he was gripping the broom so tightly, his whole body straining to go faster, but it was paying off, as he inched ever closer to the Snitch.
‘Ready to go and celebrate properly?’ Draco said once they were all dressed and ready to go.
Harry’s cock leapt at the sight of the arse he’d been dreaming about for so long, and his heart thumped wildly in his chest as the momentousness of what they were about to do made itself known. His mouth was dry with nerves as he stepped closer to Malfoy, running one hand over the exposed curve of Malfoy’s arse, hoping he wouldn’t be able to feel how much Harry was trembling. Malfoy’s skin was soft under Harry’s fingers, goosebumps appearing from the cool evening air, and he shivered slightly when Harry’s fingers brushed the edge of his crease. Noticing the reaction, Harry did it again, and again, his fingers dipping further in each time, until Malfoy was pressing back, chasing the sensation. When Harry tentatively reached out and petted Malfoy’s hole with the tip of one finger, Malfoy moaned, and the sound gave Harry the confidence he needed to cast a wandless lube charm and slowly slide his finger into Malfoy.
Harry pushes forwards, pressing Draco more firmly into the wall, shifting his hips until his cock finds Draco’s, hot and hard and brilliant against his. The feeling is intoxicating, even through layers of clothing, and all Harry can think is that he wants more. Draco’s hand slips beneath Harry’s outer robe, coming to rest on his bum, gripping and pulling Harry in closer, encouraging the movement of Harry’s hips. They begin an agonising grind, Harry chasing every twitch of Draco’s body, kissing all the while, unwilling to take even the shortest of breaks. Now he knows what it’s like to taste Draco’s lips, he doesn’t ever want it to stop.
‘Good.’ Draco could hear the smile in Harry’s voice, and he felt a similar one creep across his own face.
‘Good,’ Malfoy said, finally putting Harry’s chart down. ‘In that case, I’m officially discharging you, and you’re welcome to go home whenever you’re ready. I’ll leave you to pack.’
Pansy is quiet, a slight widening of her eyes her only reaction.
‘Not really,’ Harry said.
Pain was long forgotten as their mouths moved together, Malfoy’s spare hand tangling in Harry’s hair, Harry’s arm snaking around his waist to pull him in closer. The hard planes of Malfoy’s body felt so different to Ginny’s curves, his height such a contrast to Ginny’s petite frame, and the novelty only added to the need burning through Harry. A voice in the back of his mind whispered that he was asking for trouble, that this couldn’t end well, but he ignored it, intoxicated by Malfoy’s mouth against his and the friction of his trouser-clad erection against Harry’s.
‘I work here,’ Draco replied, feigning a tone of complete boredom. ‘What would you like?’
‘And when can we start the rest?’ Harry said once he’d taken the Skele-Gro. The taste never got better, and it still set his eyes watering.
‘Did you think I wouldn’t notice you acting strange? Avoiding me, avoiding kissing, touching me? Do you think I’m stupid, Harry?’
‘Yes, Potter, you
‘Merlin, you look awful,’ is how she greets him, but he can’t be cross about it—she’s right.
Speed was always the downfall of curse-breakers—it was delicate, slow work, and cutting corners nearly always spelled disaster—but that hadn’t stopped Harry from rushing, skipping the final diagnostic charm on a jewellery box, sure that he already knew what curse it contained.
‘Uh, yeah, I suppose,’ Harry said. ‘Bit hard to sleep, sometimes.’
‘To Muggle London. I rented a tiny flat—we didn’t have much left after the reparations, and I couldn’t leave Mother with nothing—and lived there for a year, after I finished studying for my N.E.W.T.s.’
‘Well, that was... amazing,’ Harry says eventually.
‘It’ll be fine, we’ll just change the subject if something comes up that we’re not sure about,’ Harry said. ‘Come on, let’s get it over with.’
Draco nearly came at just those words, the thought of Harry inside him too incredible to bear. He managed to hold himself back though, and instead hurried to remove his own trousers, resettling himself back on Harry’s thighs. He conjured a palmful of lube and spread some of it on Harry’s dick, before reaching back and quickly preparing himself, too desperate to feel Harry inside him to wait long. The feeling that rushed through him as he slowly sank onto Harry’s prick was indescribable, the stretch perfect and the look on Harry’s face making Draco’s heart pound. They began to move together, slowly at first and then quicker, Harry’s hips snapping up to meet Draco’s every movement. Draco couldn’t believe how good this was, how they seemed to instinctively know what the other wanted, how Harry knew that he liked a tight grip on his hips and a fast pace.
The movement seemed to shock Malfoy out of his trance, and his eyes shot back up to meet Harry’s gaze, before darting away again. His cheeks flushed a deep red, and he took an automatic step backwards, away from Harry.
‘Right then,’ Malfoy said, shifting even closer to Harry, his eyes and voice alight with what Harry thought was excitement. ‘Let’s try this first. Copy me.’
Draco didn’t know what to do, didn’t know how to get out of this without admitting that he wasn’t good enough to cast a Patronus, so he took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and raised his wand, praying to any god he could think of that this time it would work.
‘Right- yes- it is cold today,’ Draco managed to get out, before he hurriedly turned to make Harry’s drink, hoping Harry hadn’t seen the way his cheeks had flushed at his inarticulacy.
to worry about a failed Death Eater getting a few death threats, I suppose.’ The instinct to pick at Potter, to press his buttons, is too strong to resist, years of habit not yet broken.
Harry lost track of how long they sat there, talking about nothing and everything. Even once Malfoy moved his hand away the sense of closeness that had built between them remained. Malfoy talked to Harry about the book he was reading, about Pansy’s latest disastrous attempt at trying to fit in in the Muggle world, about his recent trip to Ecuador. Harry was once again pleasantly surprised by how
‘All right then, I’ll see you in the morning,’ Malfoy said, but he didn’t move away from Harry’s bedside, and Harry had the craziest thought that maybe Malfoy wanted to stay. But then Malfoy stepped back, and with a quick smile turned and walked out of the room, shutting the door behind him, leaving Harry alone.
‘Yes. And if we don’t, the pain will get worse and worse, and eventually kill you.’
Harry owled in sick the next day.
‘You all right, Potter?’ Evangeline said a few minutes later, interrupting Harry’s increasingly panicked internal monologue, and Harry looked up to see that everyone at the table, including Malfoy, was looking at him with concern on their faces.
‘What’s wrong, Potter?’ he said, his heaving chest and panted words giving away the haste with which he’d come to Harry’s room. ‘Does something hurt?’
Spaceships flew past on the screen, the cartoon colours bright and the music loud but it still wasn't enough to make Draco focus on the film. He could hear Teddy muttering excitedly to Harry each time something cool happened, the low tone of Harry's voice each time he responded sending shivers down Draco's spine. He thought he might lose his mind, sitting there touching Harry in such an innocent way which nonetheless had far from innocent thoughts flooding his brain. He'd been battling with his attraction to Harry for weeks now, just about keeping it in check, even through all the letters and trips, but the reality of Harry's skin against his was breaking down all the walls he'd carefully built around his inconvenient feelings.
‘Of course,’ Draco said, reaching out and taking Harry’s hand, leading him down the stairs and out into the garden, the two of them walking side by side down the candle-lined path before vanishing into thin air, still hand-in-hand.
To Draco’s great surprise, he got his answer from Harry. Draco arrived promptly at Andromeda’s as always for Teddy’s fifth lesson, but was taken aback when he walked into the living room to find Teddy and Harry involved in a rather intense looking wrestling match.
‘I-’ Harry started, running a hand through his hair as he appeared to search for words. ‘I’ve had a bit of a day, I suppose.’
Harry’s suggestion stayed with Draco though, especially when he noticed Teddy zoning out while he lectured again. That evening, Draco didn’t go straight home from Andromeda’s, heading instead to the library near his house where he could use the computer. He’d tried for ages to get the laptop he’d bought to work in his flat, but he just couldn’t get it to cooperate with all the magic around, even using the new Magic Suppressing Charms that had recently become all the rage. Instead he had become a regular patron of the local library, settling himself there whenever he needed to research something. He’d even ended up with quite a taste for Muggle literature, and now had a rather sizeable stack of borrowed books on his bedside table.
Nothing changed, at least at first. They both replied to their invitations, confirming that they would be attending the ball, and then slipped back into their usual work routine, all consumed by the case that was rapidly reaching its conclusion. They made a good team, their strengths and weaknesses combining to make them one of the most successful teams on the force. Draco was surprisingly on board with Harry’s tendency to bend the rules, and they were often on such a similar wavelength that it was as though they could read each other’s mind. To Harry’s great surprise, not only had they made good partners, they also became great friends, occasional lunches together at work blossoming into drinks in the pub after a hard day, and their friendship had only grown as their sons had become firm friends. They had supported each other through Astoria’s death and the breakdown of Harry’s marriage, the tough times bringing them closer together, and helping them get to a point where the troubles of their early years were forgotten.
The office was quiet, only the scratching of Draco’s quill on his parchment disturbing the silence. Harry was staring intently at a case file, forehead scrunched up as he tried to figure out what the evidence they had collected so far might mean. He’d been stuck on the case for days, and it was starting to drive him slightly mad - nothing added up, and he was no closer to solving it than he had been the day it landed on his desk.
Draco didn’t dare look around as he made Harry’s drink, topping the hot chocolate off with a swirl of whipped cream and sprinkles. He was immensely relieved to see that another customer was waiting in line when he turned back around, meaning he only had time to quickly pass Harry his drink, all opportunities for conversation and further embarrassment cut off, at least for the time being.
‘A bit stiff and achy, but not too bad,’ Harry replied.
Anticipation building pleasantly in his stomach, a swirl of excitement, nerves, and desire, Draco followed Harry into the house, both of them coming to a stop in the hallway. Harry turned to face Draco, and the look on his face, uncertainty mixed with undeniable need, robbed Draco of any ability to take this slow. He backed Harry up against the wall, delighting at the way Harry hurried to go along with it, and then he kissed him, deep and passionate, letting out all the longing that had been building in him all day, all week. Harry melted into the kiss, opening his mouth with a groan, and Draco was gone, all restraint vanishing as he pressed his body against Harry’s pushing his hips forwards so Harry could feel how badly he wanted this.
When Draco finally pulls back, sniffling slightly but a bit more composed than he had been, Pansy pushes his hair off his face, and then turns businesslike.
‘Uh, yeah. Baptiste is going to be there, so…’
‘I can’t discuss an individual’s treatments, but you’d be welcome to ask her if you want.’ Malfoy paused. ‘I’m aware that you may wish to get a second opinion before you take my advice.’
‘Yes, Millie, thank you,’ Draco burst in, cutting her off abruptly.
Harry awoke to the familiar, and welcome, sound of Ron and Hermione bickering, their voices low in an attempt not to disturb him. The bright lights had been turned down to a dim glow, and it no longer hurt his eyes to have them open. He looked around the room, taking in the sterile white walls and floor that he hated every time he came to St Mungo’s, the lone floral painting on the opposite wall that only served to highlight how bare the rest of the room was, and the two uncomfortable-looking armchairs that held his best friends.
But that wasn’t what they did, that
‘You’re welcome,’ Malfoy said, before adding, his tone slightly uncertain ‘I, ah, thought it would be best for both of us if no one looked too closely at what happened that day.’
‘Touch me,’ he gasps.
‘You’re a constant surprise,’ Harry muttered to himself under his breath, but the grin that flashed across Malfoy’s face suggested he hadn’t been quiet enough.
Potter starts to finger Draco properly, opening him up, and soon Draco is begging for more. He wants Potter inside him, wants to know what Potter’s cock feels like. Potter doesn’t give in to Draco’s pleas straight away though, continuing to torment him with his talented fingers.
‘He did look like he was beating you quite thoroughly,’ Draco replied.
As Harry began to explain how exactly the kettle worked, Draco found his attention drifting, distracted by Harry’s bare chest and the way his hands moved as he talked. He might have hated the idea of being in charge of Teddy’s
‘He was,’ Harry agreed. ‘He once told me to catch the Snitch or die trying, and he’s not really calmed down much since then.’
‘Oh.’ Draco had assumed Harry knew, and he didn’t much fancy trying to explain what he was doing. Harry was sure to jump to the worst conclusions and assume that Draco was trying to indoctrinate Teddy into hatred. ‘I have to teach him about pure-blood history. It’s a kind of rite of passage of growing up, but I’m trying to teach him differently to how I was taught.’
‘What now?’
‘Huh,’ Harry said, frustratingly giving Draco no indication of what he thought of Draco’s monologue. ‘If you want to make the lessons more interesting, maybe you should show him stuff rather than just tell him.’
‘Uh, it’s fine,’ Harry said, confused. He had no idea what he’d done to make Malfoy go so suddenly cold, after everything that had happened between them in recent days.
‘You should see the back room.’ Malfoy nodded towards a door leading out of the kitchen. ‘It was definitely some kind of potions room or similar, the detection spells were off the charts.’
‘Drinking my coffee, obviously,’ Harry replied, a mischievous smile appearing on his face.
Harry bloody Potter, of all people, is standing in front of Draco, in Paris, in the room where he fucks strange men for money. For a moment Draco wonders whether he’s hallucinating. There’s no way this is real.
‘I know,’ Draco chuckled ruefully. ‘But no, I couldn’t get married here.’
Draco’s hand moves to cup Harry’s neck as they kiss, his thumb resting in the hollow where Harry’s pulse flutters, and Harry is once again reminded of how good Draco’s hands feel, every touch a kiss on his sensitive skin.
And then Potter is gone, and Draco is reminded that this isn’t their sanctuary at all. It’s the room where people pay him to fuck them, and that’s all Potter wants from him, nothing more.
A small influx of customers kept Draco busy for the next twenty minutes or so, and he barely had time to process the fact that Harry Potter, his childhood enemy and not-so-former crush, was currently sat in his cafe, drinking a ridiculous hot chocolate confection, and seemingly deeply absorbed in an apparently Muggle novel. It was a scenario he had never even been able to contemplate before, it seemed so out of the realms of possibility, but it was apparently happening, and his brain did not know how to deal with that fact.
‘I’m sure he’ll get much less excited when I start telling him about the importance of arranged marriages and airtight wills.’ Draco laughed, following Andromeda into the dining room where they were going to have the lesson.
Harry hurriedly stripped off his clothes when he reached the bathroom, stepping into the shower and turning up the water temperature until it tipped over into too hot, the water like needles against his skin. He poured too much shower gel into his palm and scrubbed until every inch of his body was covered in soapy bubbles, then washed it off and did the same thing again. He repeated it again and again, until his skin was red and raw, but he still didn’t feel clean. How could he go downstairs and have dinner with Ginny, a dinner she’d lovingly prepared, when he could still feel the ghost of Malfoy’s hands on him? When the pleasure he’d felt at Malfoy’s touch was still so fresh in his mind? How was he supposed to even look at her without his face immediately giving away everything? Harry pressed his forehead against the cool tiles as guilt overpowered him, letting the water beat down on his back as he squeezed his eyes tightly shut against the tears that threatened to spill over.
‘True.’ Malfoy looked thoughtfully over at Harry, his fingers still twisting round and round each other, drawing Harry’s eye and reminding him of his dreams. ‘The others all banded together, after the war—the ones that escaped Azkaban, at least—talking about how unfair it was, how they would rise up again. They had no interest in changing, in reconsidering their views, even as society lined up to condemn them and spit at them in the streets.’
‘That’s actually quite clever of him.’ Draco chuckled, picturing Teddy trapped in his bed, grinning as he got out of going to school while Andromeda tried anything she could think of to unstick him.
‘Wood’s going to be furious that I fell off again,’ Harry said, mostly to himself. Oliver had been so determined to have a good start to the season, and he wouldn’t be impressed with them starting with a loss and their Seeker in hospital. Harry was already bracing himself for the bollocking he was sure to get next time he saw Oliver. He just hoped that Oliver wasn’t quite as upset as he’d been when Harry had fallen off his broom and missed the Snitch when the Dementors had come to their match at Hogwarts.
‘I showered when I came home. A customer decided to spill dragon blood on both of us just before I closed for the day.’
‘All right?’ Malfoy asked, his expression concerned.
Harry finally took Draco's hand, his fingers fitting perfectly between Draco's, his palm warm and slightly rough against Draco's. A rush of emotion overwhelmed Draco, leaving him reeling from the force; a feeling of rightness rushing over him as the butterflies in his stomach took flight in a riot of wings and joy. The smile on Harry's face had grown, and Draco's heart sang to see his own happiness reflected back at him in the dim light of the cinema. The film was long forgotten as Draco mentally catalogued every inch of Harry's hand, from the calluses on his palm to the feel of his thumb as it gently moved backwards and forwards over the back of Draco's hand, each stroke taking him apart even more.
‘Touch yourself, Harry,’ Draco urged, his voice tight with need. Harry opened his eyes and twisted slightly to see that Draco was stroking his own cock rapidly, even as he continued to lick Harry. The sight had Harry’s hand flying to his own cock, chasing the orgasm he could feel building. Knowing that Draco was so turned on by this that he was wanking himself only made Harry’s climax approach even faster.
They didn’t speak for a moment. Malfoy was still dressed in his work clothes, the dark blue of his robes reminding Harry of what had started this whole thing. He looked uncertain, his hands fidgety as he shuffled on the doorstep, as though he couldn’t decide whether to come closer or leave.
It’s particularly bad when he meets clients. He doesn’t even know if he likes Potter as a person—they’d not exactly talked much, after all—but every moment of their encounter is etched in his memory, and it floods back every time he goes to the hotel. He knows his work is suffering—he just can’t get into it the way he normally does—but he doesn’t know what to do about it. He’d hoped that fucking Potter would get him out of his system, but he just seems to have wormed his way even further under Draco’s skin.
‘Do it,’ Harry whispered, bucking his hips forward, making Malfoy’s hand brush his cock through his jeans.
And that makes Draco gasp, need hitting him like a sledgehammer. He’s always known about the power of words—he’s a dirty talk aficionado—but none have affected him quite so much as those words coming from Potter.
out of your mind?’
Of course, that’s when Draco stops, his hand stilling, leaving Harry dangling on the precipice.
Weirdly, seeing Malfoy angry made Harry feel slightly better. He felt more on solid ground with a Malfoy who clearly disliked him, rather than the blank professional act he’d been putting on. But still, Harry was wary.
Draco met Harry and Teddy outside the cinema in the small town nearest to Andromeda’s house. Teddy practically bounced as he walked down the street towards Draco, his excited voice clearly audible despite still being a few metres away. Draco was also looking forward to the cinema trip, and seeing Teddy’s enthusiasm had his own soaring even further. When Harry and Teddy caught up to Draco, they went straight inside, Teddy not wanting to miss a single minute of the experience. They decided that Draco would buy the tickets— he wanted to practice buying Muggle things—but Harry insisted on paying for his own ticket and half of Teddy’s, so he passed Draco a handful of coins. Draco couldn’t tell if he’d imagined it, but it seemed as though Harry lingered as he handed over the money, his fingertips grazing Draco’s palm and setting all his nerves alight. Shaken, Draco completely forgot what film they wanted to see, and Harry had to lean over and whisper it to him, which of course only served to make him feel even more flustered.
‘I don’t know,’ Draco mumbled, head still firmly in his hands. ‘I suppose I’ll have to - if I don’t everyone will know why, and I won’t have anyone thinking I’m too cowardly to face my ex.’
Draco could feel his temper rising—he might not spend much time with his cousin, but he knew for a fact that Andromeda had never for a moment felt like Teddy’s presence in her life was a burden, however naughty he might be. The fact that Narcissa was stooping so low as to say something like that in an attempt to manipulate him into teaching Teddy pure-blood customs made his blood boil.
‘You do make a good point, shockingly,’ he said slowly, Harry making an indignant noise at the casual insult. ‘He did always have a bit of an issue with our friendship, so he would definitely be annoyed if he thought we were dating.’
Wind whipped through Harry’s hair as he flew at top speed along the pitch, weaving through the other players as he pursued the Snitch. The wind was cool against his warm cheeks—the summer had turned out to be one of the hottest in years, and he’d been sweating as he floated above the pitch, roasting in the sun as he looked for the Snitch. Three and a half hours into the match, he’d finally spotted it, and now the hunt was on.
‘Fuck off, Malfoy.’
It was strange, feeling Harry’s eyes on him as worked. Draco was used to Harry taking himself off to his now customary armchair in the corner and immediately sticking his nose in a book, so it was new and unsettling to find himself as the main focus of Harry’s attention. Normally he could make coffee with his eyes closed, but this time he found himself fumbling, his hands shaking as he clanked the mug on the side and nearly spilled the milk. After much internal cursing, he finally managed to present Harry with a drink, only narrowly avoiding spilling it across his chest as he handed it over. Desperately needing to escape into the backroom for a moment so he could pull himself together, he hoped that Harry would go to his usual armchair and go back to ignoring Draco, but as was so often the case in his life, he was out of luck. Harry only moved as far as one of the high tables next to the counter, dragging one of the stools back over and sitting himself down, right there, in front of Draco.
Teddy continued talking, with Draco nodding distractedly and making vaguely interested noises, his eyes locked on Harry the whole time. He hadn’t realised until he set eyes on him exactly how much he’d missed the sight of that stupid hair, and those broad shoulders, and that smile that made Draco’s stomach flip when it was directed at him. But now Harry was sat in front of him, smiling at him in that way that made Draco’s heart ache, crunching his toast and eating baked beans, his gaze never leaving Draco’s, and all Draco wanted to do was reach out and touch him, kiss him, press him up against the wall or the door or any flat surface he could find and pick up where they had left off the week before.
Harry’s blood is pumping, his adrenaline spiking and his focus sharpening as he ducks curses and flings hexes back at the suspect. He lives for moments like these, when his world narrows to nothing but the chase and the thrill of bringing in someone he’s been hunting for months. He’s come close on occasions, but he’s never managed to quite replicate the feeling any other way.
‘I suppose you’re used to training all the time?’ Malfoy said, glancing over at Harry with a glimmer of curiosity in his eyes.
Potter’s fingers clench tighter in Draco’s hair as he starts to suck Potter’s cock in earnest, letting Potter’s moans and body language guide him to a pace that is just this side of not enough, teasing Potter with swipes of his tongue. Draco has years of practice doing this, but he’s never cared quite so much about making it good for someone.
Doing everything he can to hide the slight tremble in his hands, Draco begins to slowly undo the buttons of his shirt, watching the way that Potter’s intent gaze follows his fingers’ progress down his chest. When the final button is undone, Draco pauses for a moment, waiting until Potter’s eyes flick back up to his face, and then he shrugs the shirt off, revealing the pale expanse of his chest and stomach.
However hard he tried to tell himself that, Harry knew he was lying to himself. He knew it with every strained conversation he had with Ginny, every kiss he shrugged off, every daydream about Malfoy that he revelled in, but it wasn’t enough to break his infatuation.
‘And then you just ended up here and decided to become a permanent fixture in your school enemy’s cafe?’
‘He does every time,’ Harry sighed. ‘What are you doing here anyway?’
Harry dozed on and off for several hours, time losing meaning as he drifted in a semi-conscious haze. He was aware of people coming in and out of his room to check on him but was too tired to talk, even when Malfoy returned. There was somebody else with him, a young woman who looked as though she was recently out of Hogwarts. Malfoy talked quietly to her as he cast diagnostic spells on Harry, the sound of her quill as she wrote down whatever Malfoy said nearly louder than their voices. Most of the words Malfoy used didn’t make sense to Harry, either too technical or lost in Harry’s fogged brain, but even when his eyes slid shut again, powerless against the sleep that was trying to pull him under, Harry could hear the kindness in Malfoy’s tone as he explained Harry’s treatment to the woman. It was markedly different to the coldness that had been present in Malfoy’s voice when he spoke to Harry, and in his potion and sleep haze, Harry found himself curious about how a callous, cruel boy could turn into a man who spoke like that while willingly treating a man he was supposed to hate.
When that isn’t enough, Harry moves so that he can see Draco properly, one wet hand coming to cradle Draco’s face.
The door flew open just as he stood up and Malfoy rushed into the room, wand at the ready.
had run headlines screaming about his unsuitability for such a role, and at the time Harry had vehemently agreed—why in Merlin’s name would anyone think appointing an ex-Death Eater was a good idea? After a while, though, the headlines had died down and the wizarding world seemed to accept the idea of Malfoy as a Healer. They’d even accepted his sexuality, barely mentioning it beyond the odd throwaway line in articles that were far more concerned with his ex-Death Eater status. Harry had been very jealous of that at the time, when his own bisexuality was still being picked over by the press endlessly. One of Harry’s teammates had been treated by Malfoy not long after he had joined St Mungo’s and had sworn that Malfoy was responsible for getting her back on her broom so quickly. That didn’t mean Harry was happy to be treated by him though. He had a lot more history with Malfoy than most, after all.
‘Wow, Potter, truly a ringing endorsement of my attractiveness.’
‘And you’re okay with that?’ When Harry didn’t immediately respond, Ron turned to Hermione. ‘Hermione, can you believe they’re letting Malfoy look after Harry?’
‘I’m surprised Farrell sent you, I thought he’d sworn never to let us take the same job.’ Malfoy was leaning against the wall next to the open front door, his long legs crossed in front of him, his robes open to reveal a crisp shirt and smart trousers.
When it became clear that no one else was going to arrive in search of a drink to warm them up, Draco flipped the sign to closed and they relocated from the counter to one of the sofas near Harry’s old corner. It was warm by the fire, the atmosphere cosy and almost romantic, and Draco found himself wishing more fervently than ever that he and Harry were involved - it would have been perfect to sit here cuddled up together. They chatted a bit, discussing the progress of Harry’s Christmas shopping, Draco making suggestions of books Hermione might like and possibly might not have already read, but they also spent long moments in a contented silence, watching the fire dance in the grate.
The room was dark, Harry’s rapid breathing loud in the silence of the night. He could only have been asleep for a few hours, but he felt like he’d spent an eternity lost in his dreams of Malfoy’s hands. Arousal prickled under his skin, and even the pain in his hip from where he must have shifted while asleep faded to something more manageable thanks to the altogether more pleasant sensation running through him. It was a totally unexpected feeling to have in relation to Draco Malfoy and yet, in his half-asleep state, Harry couldn’t bring himself to be angry about it. Maybe a few days ago he would have had more of a problem with it, but after several days of talking to Malfoy, of seeing how carefully he took care of his patients, this latest development left Harry more intrigued than horrified.
‘Really? They weren’t heirlooms?’ Harry was intrigued despite himself, and he wanted to know what Malfoy had found out.
Potter opens his mouth, then snaps it shut again.
Despite his nerves at teaching a child for the first time and Teddy’s sugar rush, Draco thought their first lesson went relatively well. He began by explaining what pure-blood meant, and the way that historically pure-blood culture had kept to itself, distrusting anyone outside of a small group of families. Draco had found an old book in the Manor library that showed the initial grouping of pure-blood families, the basis of what became the Sacred Twenty-Eight, and he told Teddy about the descendants of these families, those who had been Draco’s friends and those who Teddy might meet when he started at Hogwarts. Teddy perked up at the mention of Hogwarts—clearly Draco had been right in thinking that he was desperate to start school—and Draco found himself going off on a tangent about how Hogwarts had been founded, and the debate that Salazar Slytherin had started.
But Potter’s control is back, even though his face is pink and his breathing is harsh, and he swiftly takes the lead. He pushes Draco’s t-shirt off, dropping it on the floor before bending to flick Draco’s nipple with his tongue. He doesn’t stop there though, licking his way down Draco’s stomach until he reaches the waistband of his joggers. Potter’s fingers slip just under the waistband, stroking the sensitive skin of Draco’s hips and stomach, and Draco doesn’t think he can take it.
‘I hope you don’t mind that we let ourselves into Grimmauld Place, Harry,’ Hermione said as she set a tin of biscuits on the side. ‘From Molly,’ she added at Harry’s confused look.
Besides, however excited he was to celebrate with his teammates, there was someone else he wanted to celebrate with first. Someone who was responsible for him being able to play in the match in the first place. Someone he couldn’t have won without.
‘Hermione and Ron’s daughter—she’s very energetic, never lets me sit down when I babysit.’
The lid of the jewellery box snapped shut, the scream cutting off abruptly. Harry’s ears continued to ring, the echo of the scream lingering in the silence, but the agonising pain receded, and Harry slid to the ground in relief.
‘You should try casting a spell,’ Draco suggested. ‘Then you’ll really feel it.’
‘You took your time,’ Harry said when Malfoy finally appeared through the door.
Harry’s arms wrapped around Malfoy and pulled him in closer as their lips met in a blistering kiss, need rushing through Harry with incredible speed. Malfoy crowded Harry back until he was pressed against the wall, the sensation familiar from all their alleyway trysts. All of Harry’s good intentions to talk to Malfoy, to explain how he was feeling, to find out whether Malfoy might feel the same, vanished as Malfoy ground their crotches together, drawing a moan out of Harry.

"Come on," Harry said, pulling Draco from his spiralling worries. "Let's go in." Harry took Draco's hand and squeezed.
"And you agreed that he'd go to the house and everything? Oh,
Draco took a seat and listened to his daughter fill his husband in on everything he'd missed. It was several minutes before he realised that he was unconsciously rocking Alex slowly back and forth, soothing both the boy and himself. The longer they sat there listening to the others talk, the more the child seemed to relax, even nodding or shaking his head in answer to Harry's occasional questions.
Dudley sighed. "Go ahead."
Pa, though, raised an eyebrow, and she knew she'd be getting a talking to later. She suppressed a groan.
"Harry!"
Draco propped his elbows onto his knees and dropped his head into his hands. "He wasn't supposed to be in danger anymore. That was the whole point of being off the active force."
"What? He said that?" she asked, confused. "Why would he think that?"
"Mine locked me in a cupboard under the stairs until I was eleven," Harry shot back, mirroring Draco's position. He'd already told Draco some of this in bits and pieces, so he didn't think that should really come as a surprise.
Draco's blush was almost invisible in the dim light. Almost. "Just because you haven't heard me doesn't mean I can't. It's not like I can sing the songs you've been listening to lately. I can't even tell what they're saying in some of those songs."
"It was okay. I went to Hogwarts. It doesn't matter."
Malfoy relaxed slightly and gestured to the room. "Well, it's as you see. Flowers are flowers, and the clientele in this neighbourhood is much more diverse and accepting than my other… options."
, not just the sex. Though he missed the sex too, because, Merlin's fuck, it was good sex. But when Harry was off on a project, photographing the jungles and forests that featured in his art shows, his absence became like a hole in Draco's life.
Potter's face pinkened and he shrugged. "I like to cook, so making a little extra seemed reasonable."
"It was perfectly called for. I fucked up. I know I did. If you think I haven't replayed our argument hundreds of times in the last three weeks, realising exactly how much of an arse I was and how ridiculous I sounded, then you're drastically underestimating my ability to self-flagellate."
Teddy nodded and shoved the wheels of his chair back towards the door. "Yeah. Yeah, there are, aren't there?"
"And if you say red and gold, I'm going to hex you," growled Draco.
"You idiot." Draco tilted his head back again and tugged slightly on Harry's neck pulling him closer, loving the scratch of Harry's regrown beard as it brushed along his jaw and neck. Slight nibbles near his ear drew a moan from his chest.
"Wow," Harry said, imagining the scene, Draco storming dramatically from the room as Lucius ordered him away from his childhood home. He replayed Draco's words in his head. "Wait, is there? Such a thing as a gay bonding spell?"
He could hear some quiet shuffling around, and then Harry opened the door.
Draco wasn't sure what else he could do, so he left the room in an attempt to respect Harry's wishes.
"No, seriously, answer it. I need to make sure you remember."
A cold wind blew through the garden, and Draco shivered.
"So what will they do with him?" Harry asked.
"What?" she asked, pushing her blonde hair behind her ears, a stupid curl immediately falling back out into her face. She hated her curls. Stupid Dad with his stupid crazy hair she inherited.
"So now what?" Draco asked.
Harry was exhausted, but he was feeling elated. He'd just spent three hours ordering an entirely new wardrobe. It was astounding finding clothing that he picked out, things that
Draco closed his eyes in exasperation, then opened them again, hoping to see it'd only been a hallucination. Okay, he loved Harry, he really did, but why the flying fuck did he have to buy so much boxed and tinned food that they would never fucking use? And why did Muggles insist on doing this to things they would put in their bodies? Tinned ham? Seriously? And what the fuck were dehydrated potatoes? Why would anyone dehydrate a potato?
"I want my mummy and daddy," he whimpered into Draco's ear.
Harry closed his eyes at the mention of Dudley's name. "I told him I'd be here. I'm the only family he has left. I mean, there's Marge, but Merlin, I can't imagine she'll be any comfort."
"She knows," Draco said quietly, hoping for the best.
There was silence in response. "I don't know," Ginny finally answered quietly. "Is he?"
Harry closed his eyes. "Isn't it too soon?"
"What is it, Harry? What do you want?"
Draco only watched him, staying quiet.
"Oh, Teddy," Draco said, reaching out to ruffle Teddy's hair as the man tried to pull away. "He'll be happy that you're happy. I promise."
"Mmm, don't have any."
Draco was right. I needed to start living again. Except, this time I couldn't just do it for Teddy. I had to do it for myself.
But he was also Harry Potter, and she never really, truly understood what that meant until this last month.
He took her hand and pulled her down next to him, leaning over and giving in to that kiss, laying one on her cheek. "You're a goddess."
She buried her hands in the soft grass, plucking a few strands and running them through her fingers. "The things they told us in class, in History of Magic… Dad, they were so matter-of-fact, and then we had to discuss different causes of the war, and there was a project on major contributing factors to the progress of the war. It went on for weeks, and almost all of it was around you and our family. And I couldn't react because people were watching, but so much of it, I was learning for the first time."
"You know what I mean. I know you all care for me. It goes both ways, I promise. I just…I don't have anyone to plan a future with. And Teddy's gone, and I'll only see him at holidays and summers, and he'll start planning his own future — as he should. Merlin, he's got such hopes; the boy is a miracle. But me? I've got nothing."
when it was your husband?
She stood up, taking that as her cue to go. "Yeah, to take to Hogwarts. I don't think a Knarl would suit him."
Draco gave her a little smile, the biggest one he could manage at the moment. "He is. But honey, Alex's mummy and daddy couldn't be saved, so he's really sad right now."
"Yeah, he will. And we can give him that."
Theo raised an eyebrow until Susan climbed onto his lap and locked her lips to his, eliciting a cheer from the group. Then she leant over and pulled Pansy closer before she kissed her the same. "You too."
"What's this?" It looked like a cupboard about four feet in height, but there were locks near the top of the door.
feel like it ought to?
"Oh," Alex said, and he stared at his plate before pushing it away. "I think I'm done. Can I go to my room too? I don't have a phone."
"All right, Samwise. Settle down," Harry said, laughing. "Idiot."
I really wasn't sure what I was getting into when I signed up for the Pod-Together fest. I just knew I'd be writing a story and getting a podfic out of it. What I actually got what so much better. I received a partner who helped brainstorm and vet the ideas of the story, who was a cheerleader every step of the way, and whose input, edits, and encouragement made this story something I am truly proud of.
Lyra. His daughter.
Alex smirked, then left the room.
"But—"
Harry turned back and there were tears in his eyes. "A family thing. Right. Because I don't understand those, having never had a family."
"Edward Remus Lupin," Draco bit out, relieved and amused and a little bewildered. "What do you think you're doing?"
"Look, I'm sorry. I'll stop," Harry said, standing up, ready to run and Obliviate himself of the entire discussion. "I'm happy you're happy." He reached for the door handle, but a quiet voice finally spoke.
"What happened, Lye?"
Hope that he didn't even realise was there began to swell inside him, but that feeling was something to consider at another time when he had the emotional energy to invest.
, which is simply perfect. And," she said, standing and gliding her finger along another tree branch, "you look a good deal like my uncle Alphard." She pointed to a darker-skinned man several branches higher than where Alex's family resided. "He was a very kind man, and he loved your Daddy's godfather, Sirius, most of all. So it's special to look like him, I think."
Draco's lips twitched into a hint of a smile. "
Draco stepped into the hallway, his ears straining.
He was afraid to pick it up, afraid to see what might be printed upon it. Hermione entered behind him and cleared her throat.
good. I think it helped."
"Merlin, Hermione, I don't know. He cried for ages until we both passed out." He ran his hand through his hair, and for the first time in his memory, he really didn't care that it was probably a mess.
, but in some new, intangible way — and when he looked up, meeting Harry's eyes and gesturing him over, Harry couldn't do anything but comply. He was like a fish on a Muggle fishing rod being reeled in, and Draco wasn't even doing anything to make it happen. He just
"Harry," Ginny finally said, "you don't really have a problem with them being happy, do you? I mean, you've been the one preaching all year that the past is the past and all that rubbish."
Draco turned on his side and tucked his knees behind Harry's, putting his arm over his waist and holding him close. "She'll adjust. Let's give her a few days before we stage an intervention."
Well, a glass of wine and a huge mess.
The blood in Draco's veins froze. Teddy was only in training. There was no way he'd be in the field alone…and Harry wasn't home.
Without looking at Draco, he pushed the remaining items back into the cupboard and spun, leaving the room and his untouched wineglass behind him.
Draco groaned. "Hermione—"
"But I'm buying. I don't cook, and it's my turn to feed you."
He slowly got out of bed and moved to the door, shushing Lyra as soon as he opened the door. "Alex is asleep in my room. He had nightmares," Draco explained, closing his eyes as the morning light from Lyra's room made his head pound.
"And I should have told you anyway, before you went to Hogwarts, for sure."
A small, cool hand suddenly rested on Harry's. He jerked his head up in surprise to find Luna's pale blue eyes meeting his. "Luna?"
Harry stared at a bird on the veranda, picking at something in the flower pots. Petunia and Vernon were dead.
"Yeah?"
"That's fine. Whatever's needed."
The smile started to feel more natural at Jimmy's clear affection for my kid. "Hufflepuff."
"At the Healer, remember? Anyway, come look." She was squatting near the floor several feet from where they'd seen their cousin Regulus. "There," she pointed, and she looked really excited, which made Alex's heart beat quickly.
Draco poured the shampoo into his hand and reached up, massaging Harry's head as he worked the soap into his hair. "I need this tonight." His voice was barely audible as he added, "I need
Hermione's eyes grew wide. "No, I really don't. He's still not home?"
He shrugged. "The basics. She knows we fought in it, and that I had a role in the final battle and it's why people know my name."
spicy curries. The eighth-years had been keeping the house-elves busy with various recipes, and the elves appeared to be enjoying the opportunity to try making new cuisines.
Draco grinned. Leave it to Luna. He went back to hanging his clothes in his new closet, casting unwrinkling charms as he went. He really could have asked Tindles to do it, but Harry had insisted: no house-elves today. Draco rolled his eyes.
"What makes you think I did anything?"
Dudley greeted people by name, accepting condolences and giving a few hugs, but Harry was ignored by almost every person who entered. Those who acknowledged him mostly sneered, though one older woman patted his hand with a quiet, "Harry, dear."
"I could, or you could just Floo from my office if you like. Then we can…catch up…while I put together the bouquet."
"Papa!" Lyra said when she noticed Teddy's attention had turned. "Teddy's going home today. He had an adventure with Daddy, but it wasn't a very nice one."
Draco thought about it. "At the Burrow before second year, right? No, I don't think you have. Harry has, though."
"Whatever, baby bro!" she laughed, grabbing at him. She heard Dad and Pa following behind her as they went through the barrier, escaping the watchful eyes of the wizarding public. Thank Merlin.
"Hi," Draco said after a deep breath, careful to keep his voice quiet and calm. "I'm sorry I woke you. You seem really tired."
"Don't you finish that sentence," Draco interrupted, trying to hide a smile. "Go on, now."
"You didn't tell me they threw you out of the house on Christmas! What the hell?"
Alex's cheeks turned pink, and he stepped closer to her, not saying anything as the doors opened and they emerged onto Harry's floor. His steps slowed, though, as they approached Harry's room, even as Lyra's went faster.
"Try that. The band is called Live, and track seven is my favourite. It's called 'All Over Me.' Trust me; it's classic."
"Does that mean we can actually do what our friends will imagine we're doing anyway?" Harry asked with a rough voice, slipping his hands around Draco's waist while capturing an earlobe between his teeth. "Because I can think of some things I'd like to do in our new flat."
"Draco, where do you want your books?"
Draco looked at the boy's small cheeks, rounded with baby fat, with large, plush lashes feathering from his closed eyes. His dark-chocolate curls fell in ringlets over the tips of his ears and along his forehead.
Draco snorted. "Of course, but you wouldn't find it in one of those fucking pure-blood books."
Unfortunately, the tide was often low with Lyra sitting quietly, watching the telly or reading books, sometimes colouring in the corner. Alex would sit in the window seat of Teddy's old room for hours if they let him, staring out at the bleak November landscape, Cat curled in his lap and Caius sitting nearby, as if on guard. Occasionally, somebody would entice Alex into some activity and he'd light up for a short time—quiet, but animated—but as soon as it was finished, he'd be back in that window, his eyes sadder than any child's had a right to be.
"That day in my kitchen, though, when Draco pulled back the curtains and told me to open my eyes, that day was the day
"No, it wasn't." He sat back down on the bed and watched her pace some more. "What else did they teach you about?"
"Butter Pecan," Harry said immediately.
And after their fight, Draco would have been surprised if he'd
Draco didn't doubt that, but… "I don't want you to make a big decision like this just because you got hurt. This is what you've always said you wanted."
"Just ask, Potter. Know what?"
"Yeah, it's disgusting. She won't stop talking about her. Like, seriously, we're only thirteen. Gross."
Harry rolled his eyes, but they landed on Alex and narrowed. "Whatever you need to do, yeah. He needs a place to feel safe while they locate his family." Harry held out his hand. "You're a good man, Draco Malfoy."
The sly grin on his friend's face was almost enough to make him apprehensive, but he shook it off. They were going to a Muggle pub, and Harry was going to do it as himself, not caring who knew.
Draco grinned. "I told them to fuck off."
“I’ll have the Mediwizard bring in your first doses so you have them on hand, but I recommend getting that order filled at the apothecary as soon as you can.” He needed to leave, needed to pull himself away from Potter’s green eyes and hard body.
Dudley's voice came from the phone, but Harry wasn't answering. "Harry?"
He nodded again, so Draco raised his wand slowly and spelled the lights brighter. The child never took his eyes from Draco's wand, his body stiff.
"It's going to keep happening, you know. You probably
"Oh, come on, you know I'm right," he bit out, furious with himself. "You were angry with me because I was a right bastard, so you decided to go out into the field instead of going to the pub with Ron or coming home early for a romantic evening as we'd originally planned." His throat clenched again at the memory. "I picked up Indian from our place and had it ready, and I waited." Harry simply stared, his mouth open and his eyes wide, so Draco swallowed the lump in his throat and finished. "I waited, and you didn't come because you were in the field, dying. I was just sitting here. Waiting."
And then??? And then she had the audacity to go and be all fan-fucking-tastic at her reading/acting. There are moments in this podfic that had me gasping at how well she captured Harry and Draco's emotions in her voice. As a writer, I feel like she's crawled into my head and painted my vision with her tones and inflections. If you're coming to read this story and have skipped over the podfic in the first chapter, I encourage you to stop and go back if you're able. Listen to the story as you read, or just listen by itself, and let PhenomenalAsterisk pull you into Harry and Draco's heads.
"He's getting married. He was inviting me to the wedding."
Draco reached for the latch, took a deep breath, and pulled.
"Oh, Alex, don't be a scaredy-cat," Lyra said with a huff, sounding just like Aunt Hermione as she pushed open the door.
Harry laughed. "That's what the lyric sheets are for."
Lyra sat up, tears in her eyes. "That can happen?" She sounded panicked. "Someone can murder your family and you have to go live somewhere else?" She started to cry in earnest. "Papa?"
Harry suppressed a snort. A vicar and church, as if his aunt and uncle had cared about anything like God or church during their lives. They put on appearances, but church clearly required too much introspection. Vernon wouldn't put up with that.
I'd been running behind, so the stadium was full. The Montrose Magpies were a popular team, and on a day like today, with the sun shining and the chill of the day still somewhat manageable, the stands were close to capacity. I smiled and nodded at the ticket booth, waving as I passed, hurrying through the members' queue.
"Really."
"Harry, you saved the world."
"For what? You're the one cooking for me. Thank
"Yeah, I think you're right. I can barely see straight," he agreed, standing up.
"There's more on there you'll like," Theo said with a laugh. "Keep it for a few days. And these, too. I expect you'll like some of them."
Scorpius and Albus hatch a plan.
"Molly," he greeted and collapsed onto the sofa.
"How's it feel to be official, little bug?" Papa asks. Papa often uses big words that sound fancy, but Alex knows what this one means. It means that it's real. That his family name is now really Malfoy-Potter, just like Daddy and Papa and Lyra. And now, when Papa calls him his little bug, he really is
She rested her head on Draco's shoulder, and he let the silent tears fall.
"Not yet," Harry said, pulling him towards the door. "Let's wait until we've both had some rest, yeah? I don't think either of us are in the right state of mind."
Andromeda led Draco into the dimly lit hospital room, the monitoring charms beeping quietly above the bed. Teddy lay more still than Draco thought he'd ever seen him, his usual blue hair a dull brown. Draco felt his knees weaken at the thought of how close he'd been to losing the young man.
"Thanks, everyone. I'm going to sing a song tonight that means a lot to me, and I hope it resonates with you too. I dedicate this song to my father." He met Harry's eyes and raised his eyebrows with a grin.
Harry started to choke, and both of their eyes swung back to him before they started laughing.
"Yeah," Harry said with a laugh. "And nothing that smells so strong that it overwhelms our little office, please."
Harry would sometimes fall into these dark moods and there didn't seem to be any obvious triggers. Draco was good at patterns, but he just didn't see any here. There wasn't any one thing that caused them from what he could tell.
The thought forced another sob to escape, this one louder than he expected, and Alex began to stir. He sat up groggily, his small face trying to take in the room around him despite the dim lighting.
"Well," Draco started, his stomach turning with nerves as he considered how to approach this. He and Harry had always tried to answer Lyra's questions in an age-appropriate way, and they never brushed her off. "Do you know how Daddy used to catch bad guys before he decided to teach people how to catch bad guys?"
"No! Of course not!"
"Probably not, but you can ask," Harry finally said. "So, you'd like to be our son?"
"Of course you do, darling. And you'll make a lovely Auror." Hermione patted her boyfriend on the hand sweetly.
"Yeah," Lyra said quietly. "It wasn't there at Christmas, but it was there last week."
They stood and followed the other mourners to the graveside. Dudley and several men he'd introduced earlier as his friends from work carried the caskets to the graveyard, but Harry and Draco trailed behind. "I don't want to be here," Harry said suddenly, stopping in his tracks. "I don't want to watch this part. Can we go?"
"I'm so sorry," he whispered, and it made her angry.
I let my head fall to the side, looking at my friend. His pale blond hair was shining in the warm sun, and he was watching me with his clear, all-seeing, grey eyes. Something tight inside my chest loosened at the sight of him.
Harry's loud footsteps announced his arrival before he spoke, his voice low and rough. "I'm sorry." Harry was standing in the hallway, his shoulders hunched, his hands in his pockets, and his eyes unbearably sad. "I shouldn't have lost my temper."
Harry closed his eyes and breathed in, trying to ignore the itch of annoyance that crept up his back between his shoulders. He hated when Draco left a mess, just assuming that Tindles would pop in to take care of it later. And no matter how many times Harry complained, Draco didn't seem to change.
"They told you about your pa and his family?"
— bars, back alleys, Pansy and Neville's bathroom — but they hadn't taken the time to hold one another, to really be together.
"So who's going to sing first?" Pansy yelled across the table.
Draco's voice was raspy when he spoke. "I didn't know."
"Whatever," she said, smiling. "Now, when are we getting Alex a kitten?"
would. He was so small, but he was fast and he made me so mad, always saying whatever it was that would rev me up fastest."
Draco found me like that, sitting on the chair in my back garden, staring out at the autumn leaves changing colour at the edge of the property.
"Not really. Hermione's got the revision schedule pretty full."
She nodded, and Draco was impressed when she kept her voice low. It was easy to forget that she knew how to do that, since her default volume was generally loud. "He won't talk to nobody, though. Just me. Grandma Molly says it's because he had something real bad happen and grownups probably scare him."
Tindles, Draco's house-elf, stepped from the cupboard in the hallway where she'd Apparated from the manor.
A few more hungry thrusts and Draco came on a shout, pouring himself over both of their hands. Harry jerked several more times and joined him, the heat of their combined release coating their joined fingers.
"It's just…I reckon I thought they'd be having a harder time, but here they are, back at Hogwarts, living their lives like they have some bloody second chance at things, like it's their right to just be happy!"
Alex tucked his face into Draco's neck and held on tight.
Well, Harry couldn't let Draco out-Gryffindor him, could he?
Teddy held up a finger, gesturing for Draco to wait while he finished his task. It did more for Draco's equilibrium than all of the previous words of comfort from their families had done. He suppressed a smile and tapped his foot impatiently.
"Something's happened." He could hear his heart pounding in his ears. "Did you find them?"
cushions. He took out his phone.
There was a bit of nervous laughter before everyone burst out into loud guffaws. "Merlin, no," Tracey laughed. "Do you think it's been going on for a while?"
Draco closed his eyes. Cleaning… It was another piece of the puzzle that burned his stomach. Then he had another thought and he had to know. "Did they…beat him?"
Harry's eyes flashed and his face hardened. "Gods, Draco, I love you, but you're so fucking egotistical sometimes." He plucked the wine glass out of Draco's hand and set it next to his own on the coffee table, then he moved closer to Draco, his eyes solemn. "I was in the field because I could see Teddy was questioning whether or not he wanted to be an Auror, and I wanted to give him a taste of the bureaucracy involved in a simple case of Accidental Magic. I thought it was an easy little case to show him the piles of paperwork he'd have. It had nothing to do with our fight."
"She was the one we avoided at the church?"
"Do you want to go back to sleep?"
Merlin, Harry couldn't understand it.
"That was well done, Harry," Malfoy said quietly.
potatoes — not dehydrated, thank you very fucking much — and began the work of peeling them. He might not cook often, or really ever, but that didn't mean he didn't know how. It had been a course they taught at Beauxbatons after the war, when he'd needed to get his N.E.W.T.s, but couldn't bring himself to return to Hogwarts.
"Draco!" His aunt approached and kissed his cheek lightly. "Where's Harry?"
"Your closet. If we're going to do this, we're going to do it right."
Helen sighed and stood, stepping back as Draco got to his feet. "This is why we generally take them to the foster home right away," she said, her eyes sad when she looked from Alex to Draco. "I'm sorry. It's hard for them to make yet another change amidst all the other turmoil going on in their lives. With the situation what it was and Alex being under the DMLE's care, I let it go on longer than I should have. I should just take him. The longer we draw this out, the worse it'll be."
He looked back down at his phone, at his and Draco's selfie that Draco had set as Harry's wallpaper. He loved Draco. He couldn't bear the thought of Draco not loving him in return. Not now, after everything Draco had become to him.
"And a sister. And a Teddy?"
So it was that the two of them sat quietly together that Monday evening, exactly two weeks after Harry had woken up in the hospital room. The children were both tucked into bed, and Harry and Draco finally had a moment alone where they were both feeling rested and calm.
, which follows 25 years of Christmases for our family.
expecting, really, but it wasn't this.
Harry closed his eyes, mustering his courage. "What if…what if I just don't like sex in general? Hermione said that's a thing, that there are people who just don't like it. What if I decide to tell people I'm bent and go through all the hassle of the
As if.
"I can't promise that, Harry. But I can promise I won't let it drive us apart."
Draco scowled. The lawsuits around that book were all dismissed, seeing as how none of it was incorrect or slanderous. It really was well done, but Harry deserved his privacy and had not authorised the damned thing. And now they were using it in the curriculum at Hogwarts?
"I just—" Dudley sounded as though he were having trouble getting whatever it was out. "Harry, Mum and Dad are dead," he said, his words so quick that Harry wasn't sure he'd heard them correctly.
*crack*
He sighed. “I’m off at seven tomorrow.”
"Grandmother! Look! The trapestry knew Alex got adopted and added him to it! Did you see?"
Nodding, Alex curled up in a ball, his little body shaking slightly. Draco walked over and covered him with a blanket, and when the boy didn't flinch away, ran his hand down his little arm like he sometimes did for Lyra when she was upset.
I don't generally post a story until I'm done writing, but I really wanted to get this one out there. I am about 2/3 of the way done with the first draft, and I'll be posting updates twice a week (Mondays and Fridays). I expect it'll probably be around 8 chapters in total, as I'm currently in the middle of chapter 5, but that may change as I approach the end. I hope you enjoy it!
She smiled and kissed his cheek, then she moved to a group of women and began to pour them tea and coffee from a sideboard.
"They're an approved foster family, Draco," Hermione chided, pushing her hair behind her ear. They take care of children until we can find them a permanent family. It'll be okay. They're trained for it."
Draco rushed across the room, pouring a cup of water from the small, hospital-style pitcher next to the bed. He held the cup up, slipping the straw between the parched lips.
Draco let out a little laugh before leaning in to nip at Harry's ear. "I think we both need to do better with it. Michelle says—"
"I want to check in on him on our way out."
He helped push away the darkness so I could see the promise of the light. He wasn't my source of hope; that was mine. But he helped me dare to open my eyes one more time and look for it.
Draco sipped his tea and then tried to take a small bite of his muffin. The tart cranberry burst on his tongue and it occurred to him it was the first thing he could remember tasting since this entire debacle began.
"Draco?"
Potter shook his head. "I can't eat cheese like that. Kreacher knows I'm lactose intolerant."
"I love you, you know," Draco muttered against his mouth before he pulled away. "Thank you for understanding."
Harry turned, a flirty smile already prepared for The Man with the Amazing Arse, and then he froze, stunned.
"I know, and I'm not saying anything against them, I'm only saying that he knows us. Why can't he stay with us until they find the Muggles."
"My mamá and papá are dead," Alex finally said in a very tiny voice. "And they're not coming back?"
Harry looked at the bowls of crisps between them, trying to see them from Draco's point of view. His friends had been selecting various foods over the previous weeks to find things Harry had never tried before. He'd learned that he loved most kinds of pasta, really didn't enjoy crab — much to Draco's annoyance — and absolutely
"What's wrong with him?" Draco demanded from Ron as Hermione joined them. "I need to know." He took a deep breath. "Please."
-Phe, I can't tell you how happy I am to have been paired with you. If you ever want to do this again, in or out of a fest, please don't hesitate to ask. I would definitely be eager to collaborate with you in the future.
"Well, you look good," Harry said, then felt his face heat when he replayed what had come out of his mouth. "I mean the shop. It looks like you're doing well."
Deal with
Alex reached out and traced the name and picture. "It's me."
The tears began to fall, and Teddy got up and pulled her to him, wrapping his arms around her.
He chuckled. "Well, I mean, I'm out here in the sun, weeding. You couldn't expect I'd smell good, could you?"
Lyra wiped the tears out of her eyes and could see her dad was breathing heavily, and his face was really serious.
He didn't.
Draco stopped before opening the door and turned, nearly knocking Harry over. "Harry, when was the last time you bought your own clothes, or chose your own food, or even decided on a haircut?"
carefully.
Draco leaned into the man; I felt the breath leave me, and I struggled to suck in a new one. I stood frozen, watching, my head swimming as I tried to make sense of what I was seeing.
He would know love and kindness. He would know family.
Everyone kept repeating those words, as if they made this all better, as though those few hours weren't still an eternity in Draco's life. Hours of watching Harry lie practically dead in a hospital room while Draco was separated from his daughter. Hours worrying about the small boy who Lyra decided to attach herself to, wondering what would happen to him, who would come to claim him. Hours of wondering if this so-called counter-curse would actually work.
"That's what Draco did for me. He showed me the bridge and held my hand when I crossed it. Sometimes I forget, and he's there, patiently waiting to show me again.
The rest of the noise came from where Alex sobbed loudly, cuddled in Molly's arms as she spoke to him quietly.
Draco was standing by the door, his back stiff, which was not like him. Shit. I'd really messed things up, and I needed to clear the air. I hated to see him so uncomfortable.
"Breathe out." She let out a long breath and Draco automatically matched it as well as he could. "And in," she said again, and he focused on the pale freckles on her nose. Strange, that. He'd never noticed she had freckles before. Maybe she caught them from her Weasley children.
Alex, in turn, sat with his eyes wide, barely eating and trying to breathe quietly. Draco attempted to convince him it was all right, but it didn't seem to improve the situation.
"What?"
"Probably should take Harry to sit down before she sees him and you have to call the Obliviators. Trust me."
"Always has been." Jimmy jerked his head to the field when a whistle blew. "Oh, wow, sorry about keeping you. Mr Malfoy's already up there. Enjoy the game!"
Dudley looked around the room that overlooked the living room and his shoulders fell. Susanne stepped up close, wrapping an arm around his. "Tell him, Dudley."
Harry was talking to Susanne, but Dudley caught Draco's eye and nodded, seeming to agree with the old woman's suggestion.
"She's fine. Molly hasn't told any of the children what's going on, just that they're having an extended sleepover. Lyra is happy and well and playing with Rose and Hugo."
Draco's heart broke. "No, little bug. They can't."
I'd weave adventures about Amil sailing the world, meeting new people who always seemed to have some difficult problem that needed solving. Sometimes the problems were small, and Amil would help them figure it out themselves, and sometimes they were large, and he'd find a way to lend a hand.
"But Harry wouldn't feel obligated, would he?" she asked quietly.
Draco watched as Harry stepped to the podium, the spotlight falling over him in the darkened hall. The audience quieted, and Draco's stomach turned with nerves and anticipation.
I was not mourning. I knew Teddy wasn't dead. I was happy for my godson, and from the letters he sent every couple of days, I knew he was having a blast at school. He'd made new friends and was getting up to the appropriate levels of mischief.
She nodded, satisfied, then let it out. "How old were you when Dad told you about the war?"
Harry leant forwards and caught Draco's lips. "You're such a Slytherin."
He realised everyone was waiting on him to answer and replayed the question in his mind. Right. Lyra. "Yes, quite sure. Both Alex and Lyra have asked for her to stay."
"I know."
Teddy had long outgrown his pirate phase by the time he'd left for Hogwarts, but I still had deadlines for promised stories, even if my muse was gone and he was now much older than the boy pirate that brought hope to the wider world. Despite his age, Teddy still brought hope to me.
"Are you sure the girl should be here? It seems very strange," the specialist said, addressing Draco. The man's bald head reflected the sun streaming through the windows, but Draco did his best not to be distracted from the matter at hand.
"I do."
is magical and automatically knows when a new person has joined our family." She didn't smile very often with her mouth, but Papa was teaching Alex how to watch her eyes, and they were smiling.
She shrugged and thought of Teddy. "It's my job."
Teddy looked interested and sat back, thinking. "Well, I mean, we talked about it from as early as I can remember. I had questions about my parents, and he was always careful not to lie about anything, even if he didn't tell me more than I was ready to hear."
I rolled my eyes at his use of my surname. He generally reverted to that when I annoyed him.
Teddy looked thoughtful. "They said the little boy helped."
He was having a
A short scream cut through Draco's chest, followed by low sobs. Alex.
, right? That's what mattered."
The little boy muttered something in Hermione's ear, and she nodded before setting him down. He walked over to Harry's bed, the side opposite where Draco was sitting, and took Harry's finger. He just stood there, staring at Harry, and held on.
"Can't," he managed to get out, mumbling into the bed. "I can't."

Draco stepped up next to him and slipped his hand into Harry's. "What can I do?"
Her mouth grew firm. "There are signs of a struggle at the residence and three dead bodies. Two were Spanish citizens living here for work: a wizard named Alexander Torres and his Muggle wife, Sophia. They were both killed with magic; it's too soon to say what spells were used. The third was a British citizen, Alexander's cousin. He was found separately from the others and was buried under a wall that caved in. Aurors on the scene believe the force of the wall-collapse killed him." She paused and took a deep breath. "And there's a child who appears to be unaccounted for, and Harry wasn't there."
"Parkinson," Harry said, interrupting the girls' discussion about Runes. "Where's Malfoy?"
There was something about this door. It was only a cupboard. Petunia had probably packed up Harry's things and kept them here for storage or something. Nothing more.
Like that shop up the block with its formal, black canvas that covered the entrance. It was softened by the flower displays spilling out onto the pavement, practically begging the passing shopper to stop and admire the blooms.
,' Dean had said. But it was so bloody hard, and what if Draco laughed at him or taunted him with it? Except, Draco had just laid himself out with Harry, had just asked his own confusing questions, and Harry could have used those against
"Well, if you found your own—"
"Well, see? Then you'll be home to help."
He closed his eyes. "I'm not. God, I'm so weak, Gin. I don't know what I'm doing."
Harry chuckled. "Yeah, it is." He sighed. "This really sucks, though. She won't even look me in the eye, and she bit my head off anytime I tried to talk to her tonight. I wish I knew what was going on."
Unfortunately, he never got that far. He was returning from a meeting, just about ready to suggest his plans to Harry, when he heard shouting coming from their shared office.
She began pacing again. "I'm so mad at him, and I can't tell if it's because he did that or because he didn't tell me."
"Completely. Too much cheese early in the day doesn't sit well with me. Makes me sweat. Come on."
Susan rolled her eyes from her spot on Harry's bed. "You're just going to put your wand to the image and your clothes will take on a temporary Transfiguration to the item in the catalogue. It'll also mark down the size to fit you properly. That way, if you order, it'll all be taken care of."
"Kreacher will make sure he gets it," the elf said, suspicion in his voice.
"Yeah, baby. Definitely."
"No. Say it properly, please. We aren't peasants."
Her eyes met Dad's green ones and she froze, nervous to be around him for the first time ever. He was just her dad, the same guy who sang her to sleep when she was little; who read her stories about elephants and The Three Brothers when she was smaller; who geeked out over Lord of the Rings with her when they read it together the previous summer.
Neville rolled his eyes. "They've only been together for two years now. It's time to get used to it."
Hermione shook her head. "They've been through his house and packed up everything they think he'll need."
"Draco, I'm here. Talk to me."
Harry leaned into Draco's shoulders as they left the church and gave a little snort. "Should be fun."
But he was back, Draco was in his arms, and I couldn't do a thing about it. And why did I feel like I needed to do something about it, anyway? I felt so confused, both by what was going on in front of me and by what I was feeling. Was that…
"Oh, hey, Mr Malfoy," Charlotte said, pulling away from Teddy and standing up straight, her normally pale face turning pink under her dark-blonde curls. "I, uh, was just checking on Teddy."
No wonder she didn't want to look him in the eyes.
Draco Malfoy was his friend. Not just a friendly-type person Harry sometimes did homework with, but someone Harry now sought out to talk to when something was on his mind. Or when he wanted to share a snack, like now.
When Pilot had introduced himself first, Harry had taken it as a joke, but his parents seemed to hold such a love for aircrafts they couldn’t see their child with a more reasonable name than Pilot.
Said nemesis had grown up just as he had, and he was single since breaking up with his rebound from Ginny. Three years they had been together after the War before admitting to each other there were too many platonic feelings between them. And Harry had discovered his bisexuality, so many things in his school years clicked into place and he explored before being in a rebound relationship with a wizard he had met at work. That only held for seven months but both of them had too much to solve on their own.
And thus after sharing a plate of waffles as dessert and downing the last of their coffee, he asked: “Are you up to come to my place?” Harry hesitated a moment, then shrugged. “Sure, I’d love to. I actually have a little present for you still-”
To his joy, he also discovered Harry was not good in flirting, and he quickly picked up on how adorably the man blushed when Draco effortlessly flirted with him, always scrambling to a reply.
None of this had felt like he felt right now. The atmosphere burned like fire in his blood, his breath laboured just from being this close to Draco goddamn Malfoy. Who slowly leaned down to him, giving him time to turn away, to refuse. Instead, Harry surged forwards, meeting his lips.
-And to my readers, I hope you love this story as much as I do. I have a lot of stories, but this is one of my favorites. 💛
Draco groaned and put down his phone. This is what he got for being friends with a Weasley. He'd thought he could handle Harry's friends, what with Weasley and Granger fucking off to Australia and staying there after the war. Harry still talked to them regularly, but they weren't a part of his everyday life. Ginny and Luna
"I like Alex, Papa."
“Well, now, what seems to be the problem?”
"Fuck. Message. Hermione," Draco said, looking at her. She'd sat up straight at his change of tone. "If I had an item with a Protean Charm placed on it and Harry had the other, could you use it to trace him?"
Ginny, love, be nice.
"Lucky for her," Draco growled.
want you to be happy."
The living room, such as it was, was not that large of a space. It was more of a sitting area that ran into the dining area that ran into the kitchen. Harry said the Muggles called it an open floor plan, but they'd both decided it was adequate, given the large veranda that overlooked the docks right off the Thames. Two large verandas, actually: one large enough to be its own sitting area, and another off the master bedroom that would be ideal for sitting with a morning cup of tea in nice weather.
"I did."
"Draco," Harry cut him off, his voice sharp, "I'm sure Michelle is brilliant, but I'm hungry and I'd rather not talk about it. Can we just eat?"
Neville came to the rescue. "They'd probably just start pairing him off with every other girl they can think of.
"Fine. I'll make sure he gets it when he comes back."
Shrugging, Draco smiled gently. "It's a small common room."
His eyes grew big. "A kitten?"
Hermione smiled and gave Draco a knowing look, then proceeded to the lifts. Lyra proceeded to chat to Alex the entire way. "When Aunt Hermione had a baby last year, I got to come here and see him. His name is Hugo."
His throat clenched.
"And if he made them mad, they'd lock him in here with nothing to eat. He was in here for almost three days, once."

"Alex," Draco said quietly, "I'm going to put up a magic spell that will make it so you can't hear what Harry and I say, okay? It's grown-up talk."
Susanne held out her hand to Harry. "Hello, Harry."
"My Mum and Dad died when I was a baby, and I didn't have them anymore."
"Are you proposing?" Ginny asked, her eyes wide. "Over sandwiches? In Harry and Draco's new flat?"
Draco wanted to rage, wanted to pull out his wand and burn this little cupboard, burn this entire fucking house. He wanted to curse this man who'd just admitted to hurting the man Draco loved when he was only a small child.
The small group had dissipated by the time Draco reached the threshold of Harry's hospital room, and they could hear Lyra's chatter from inside mixed with Harry's low tones. Alex relaxed slightly, allowing Draco to hold him a little closer.
Draco felt the panic rise up in his throat. "Harry," he heard the plea in his voice. "This isn't about
"Do you ask her to put food on your plate?" Draco asked, raising a single eyebrow in that infuriating way Harry found a little disconcerting.
Harry stared. "Wow," he finally said, and then he considered everything and sighed. "So now what are you going to do?"
"No, it's good. I mean, it was good," Harry fumbled, then laughed. "Like,
Draco looked at his watch and sighed. "This is what I get for deciding to stay in the common room on a Saturday instead of finding some quiet, hidden room somewhere. Come on." He stood up and held his hand out for Harry. Harry took it, and Draco pulled him to his feet.
“A present? Now I am curious.”, Draco eyed Harry. “Let’s pay, then we’ll apparate to my place and you can show me.” Harry got up and teased: “Someone is impatient, huh?”
“Merlin, that will be a change but yes. I will feel like an impostor calling you Harry.”, Draco agreed. His heart beat fast, and he suddenly feared uncomfortable silence between them. Perhaps Friday night had only been an illusion, induced by whiskey and continued by adrenaline?
He demonstrated how to drink it and watched intently as Harry repeated the order. A satisfied victory smile lit up on his face upon the Gryffindor dropping his jaw and looking at him with wide eyes. “It does! How in Merlin’s name did you find out?”
The barn owl took his answer and gracefully flew out of the window, disappearing into the southwest of London. Not long after, maybe half an hour, it returned with a small letter, containing an address and a time. Tomorrow, at 3pm, in a café in the south of Magic London. Harry tried to ignore the nervous butterflies awaking in him. He quickly got another sheet of paper and started a letter to Hermione, then crumpled the paper and decide to keep this strange turn of events to himself at first. Draco Malfoy stayed on his mind all day, from his breakfast to his dinner.
But the moment had passed, and suddenly Harry cursed himself for losing control over himself. Malfoy looked positively panicked, his face even paler than before and his eyes afraid. And before Harry could say anything, he stormed inside and vanished in the still large crowd.
When he came back to the sinks, Malfoy stood there washing his hands. He looked up into the mirror and caught Harry’s eyes. “Following me?”, he teased but stilled as the Slytherin rose. They were even closer than at the bar, and suddenly the air felt thick. Keeping the eye contact, Malfoy extended his right arm and Harry tried to breathe normally. Would he grab him? Had his lips always looked this inviting? Wasn’t he more sober by now, why did he feel more drunk instead?
A man slid into the stool next to him. “I’d like a whiskey as well, please.”, he said with a small gesture at Harry, who looked at him with vague attention. He was blond, lean and pale, with an aristocratic nose and a familiar feeling to him. His face called out to his mind, like-
Hello Potter.
Malfoy shrugged and murmured: “Time does that. I’ve grown up and learnt a lot-” He looked to the crowd in the room. “And left a lot behind. I like to think I’m different from who I used to be, so thank you.” He ordered another whiskey from Pilot and turned fully to Harry. “You changed a lot as well, Potter.”
They melted into each other in an instant, Malfoy pressed Harry flush against him with his arms around his waist, and wasted no time kissing him like they were drowning. His lips were soft, plush and hot against Harry’s mouth. He gasped when Malfoy pushed one leg between his thighs, the friction feeling like fireworks setting him on fire. One arm on his shoulder, the other hand cupping the taller one’s chin and deepening the kiss, he wondered how he never felt this amazing before.
On their way back, shoving through the crowd of drunk muggles together, Harry tried to stop the thousands of questions storming through his head, but each time his hand brushed against Malfoy’s, another question was added. The coincidental grip on his hip while moving aside fast for two yelling women sent electric jolts through his body, and the touch of Malfoys hand between his shoulder blades to steer him drove him insane.
The bottle of actual whiskey was left completely forgotten on the sofa table, reflecting the sunset and painting golden freckles of light to the ceiling, illuminating the room in a surreal lighting.
Again, a loud call broke the half-conscious daydream thoughts Harry had given himself to, this time from a young woman: “Next round on me, for everyone in here!”, followed by audible appreciation. Taking the opportunity, he downed the rest of his whiskey and nodded to the bartender, a man with crowsfeet and the most ridiculous name Harry had ever heard – and he knew enough pureblood wizards and witches for that to be an impressing achievement.
“Malfoy?”, Harry exclaimed with visible confusion. The fact that it had taken him so long to recognize his childhood nemesis had most likely been a mix of the alcohol fuzzing up his head a bit and the time that had passed between them. Six years did a lot to a person, apparently.
“What in Merlin’s name are you doing here?”, he asked. Malfoy replied in an amused tone: “Drinking, as you do in a bar, commonly. Are you accustomed with the traditions generally practiced at such a place?” He teased Harry in a way he never had before. No malicious hatred seethed through in his voice, only friendly sarcasm. “You know what I mean. I didn’t expect you here so suddenly.”, Harry answered after a moment of silence where he collected himself from the weird surprise and decided to approach Malfoy as friendly as the Slytherin had done (unexpectedly).
Suddenly, he felt Malfoy move behind him and saying down into his ear: “Should we go outside instead?” Goosebumps spread over Harry as he felt Malfoy’s breath against his face, and he – not trusting his voice – nodded and went towards the back entrance. Less smokers than out front, and more peace and privacy.
Three steps down the street a small Apparation Point lead them to Draco’s apartment, with Harry enjoying the close proximity between them as they apparated. The apartment opening up in front of him was unexpectedly warm lit, high windows letting in the orange sunlight of a setting sun. A narrow hallway lead to the living room, mostly dominated by a dark grey couch and a fireplace. Draco gestured to the couch and went towards a carved cupboard with glass doors, containing several expensive-looking bottles of wine and other liquor.
“Stubborn snake.”, Harry murmured jokingly annoyed. “Serpent, if you must.”, Draco smiled. “A true Slytherin is a serpent, not a common snake.”
Malfoy smelled forbidden good, and the almost inaudible moan he made as Harry pulled his hair turned him on so much more. He wanted more, this should never end, thoughts surfaced and vanished so fast into the sensations he was feeling, overwhelming him completely.
With a flick of his wand, the coffee started to brew and a second flick turned on the radio. He switched to the channel Mrs. Weasley always listened to because it gave him a sense of comfort and home that he really needed right now, and started making breakfast with Celestine Warbeck together. Her voice singing from the radio mixed into a pleasantly familiar background noise together with the cars outside, the ticking of the big clock hanging in the kitchen and the sizzling of the pan.
“Your hair drives me insane. I just want to bury my hand in it and do – this.” Draco raised himself on his knees, bracing Harry’s thighs, grabbing his hair and pulling his head back, baring his throat. A gasp escaped him, and as soon as Draco dived down and pressed open mouthed kisses to his throat, Harry was lost. “Oh, god. Draco, you – fuck, Draco.” His skin tasted like whiskey, amber, warm and hot.
He came here every now and then, usually once a week, just to sit down and watch the people contentedly. There was a certain pleasure in a room full of strangers, surrounded by blurred faces and yet alone. Simply spending time witnessing everything pass by. Harry found his peace here.
Harry read it three times, then practically ran down the small corridor to his office room, got a sheet of paper, strode back and started scribbling his answer.
“I quite liked the loneliness. Actually, I come here because of it.”, Harry said, not sure if he was more grumpy about losing his peaceful, undisturbed anonymity or more curious about Malfoy.
With loud creaking, the door of the bar opened and Malfoy and Harry broke apart, Malfoy stumbling two steps back with a shocked expression and Harry felt his heart beat so fast he was convinced he could faint right now. A man with a beard stood in the frame, a beer pint in his left, and surprise written all over his face. He vaguely gestured with his free hand. “Uh, sorry. Continue.”, and went inside again.
Last night had ripped open old wounds, old fears of emotionless kisses and empty love he felt for years, scared that he lost his ability to love after all the issues he suffered through. But the wish to explore how strangely amazing Harry Potter had made him feel was stronger than his instinct to run and push the new feeling away. So he carefully folded his jacket over the back of the seat at the window table and sat down, trying to hide his nervousness. Casually looking around, he inspected the café he chose for this date very consciously. He knew the menu here well and felt comfortable here. Purely by habit he was ten minutes early, preparing for Harry’s arrival. Waving his wand, he summoned one of the charmed menu paper sparrows over to the table and placed it on the other side.
One more glass, and Harry would have said ‘Let me prove the statement wrong, I can show you.’ But thankfully, he was sober enough to bite that back. He tried to choke down the terror upon noticing how easily he had begun flirting with Malfoy. Draco Malfoy! Get a grip, Harry!
The next morning woke Harry with golden streaks sneaking through his blinds and painting sunlit stripes onto his bed. The clock told him it was Saturday, 11th August and just past 11 o’clock. After Malfoys sudden departure the night before, Harry had gone home and fallen asleep with a buzzing head. From the rest alcohol or the countless questions regarding a certain someone, he didn’t remember.
The moment passed, and Malfoy grabbed the paper towels right next to Harry’s torso. Mentally cursing himself and trying to not let it show how shellshocked he was from the situation, he moved aside. What was up with him? Men were hot, sure, but Malfoy? Feeling so attracted to another man, not necessarily surprising for Harry, but goddamn Malfoy?
Draco pouted slightly, but he had to admit he hated to wonder about presents, once someone started hinting about them. Christmas was a challenge to him every year. So he was understandably quick to take the bill, refusing to split with the argument that he invited Harry so he was the one to pay. “It has been my pleasure, so let me pay.”
“Malfoy!”, he yelled and chased after him, but there were so many people and by the time he made it to the front door and stepped outside into the cool air again, he was gone. Only the night and four confused smokers surrounded Harry standing there alone, staring into the dark.
Our encounter was not unwelcome, but a bit unexpected.
Falling as easy into conversation as last time they met, the afternoon passed by too fast. It was great to talk with Harry, Draco discovered. He was witty and matched Draco’s enthusiasm for his passions easily, not bothering about the looks the neighbour table threw at them when they laughed too loud or argued about House superiority in such a childish way Draco was sure his face would hurt from grinning so much later.
Harry blushed again, almost unnoticeably flustered, and closed his eyes, pulling Draco closer to him. “Tell me more”, he murmured into Draco’s skin, his fingers slipping under his shirt and tracing a slow path up his back.
“I did not expect to find you of all people here either, Potter. Yet here we are.” Malfoy quickly emptied his glass and gestured for a new one. “But after I saw you here at the bar, so alone and unaccompanied, I thought I would just join you on your whiskey quest.”
Harry
Thankfully he had the weekend off, so he let his head fall back on the pillow and stared to the ceiling. “What the hell?”, he said loudly and listened to the words meeting the ceiling, without an answer. Then he got up.
Harry laughed quietly at his reaction, proud of his obvious success in the effort of looking good, and picked up the menu while saying: “It seems super weird, but I suppose we address each other by first names now?”
After his last school year, Draco went into a ministry program to qualify for his studies to become a healer despite his past, and succeeded. So now, after six years, he had overcome every obstacle, processed his childhood under Lucius’ violent, radical upbringing as well as the trauma of the War and could proudly look in the mirror. Until last night, at least.
Harry didn’t hear the knocking the first time, and only when the owl screeched impatiently, he looked to the window and saw it. A pretty barn owl with smoky eyes and a small envelope, which it quickly dropped on the table before landing on the cupboard eyeing him crookedly, after he let it in. “Hey, who are you? Hold on, I have treats.”, Harry greeted her and opened the letter, reading it while throwing a few treats up the cupboard. The owls thankful chirping went unnoticed as the letter’s content registered in his head.
The rational part of Harry’s brain was screaming, because here he was, twenty-four years old, outside a muggle bar, about to make out with his childhood nemesis, the kid he had hated almost more than Dudley, almost. But what exactly should stop him?
When the door shut behind them and the muffled singing and talking in the bar joined the noises of London after midnight, a car driving by, in the background, Harry heard Malfoy take a deep breath. Then he actually grabbed him, and before Harry could do or say anything, he was trapped between the wall behind him and Malfoy’s body. “If you don’t want me to kiss you, say it now.” Malfoys voice was dark, deep, and filled with the same want coursing through Harry’s veins in this moment. Only his eyes showed the nervousness in him and the way he reached out to Harry reflected how his own desire surprised him.
“Hey, look who is here!”, a voice filled with drunken happiness called out from somewhere behind him and for a second Harry froze in fear of losing the peaceful silence he had wrapped around him. He absolutely didn’t want to be recognized and dragged into a conversation about his heroic history. But thankfully, the greeting seemed to be meant for another stranger and Harry hid his relieved smile behind another sip from his whiskey as he listened to the cheering behind him.
The brilliant green eyes widened as Draco sat down closely and pulled Harry into a kiss. Not as sloppy and passionate as last time, but deliberately deep. “I had to keep myself from kissing you all afternoon.”, he whispered against the other mans lips. “You look too hot to not be kissed.”
No traces of that ghost were left, instead Harry faced a man visibly healed from The Second War, humming to the song playing from the speakers, looking like the muggle world was his home. It puzzled Harry, but he was glad Malfoy seemed to be doing good. The final departure from Lucius probably did a lot for him. “You seem very different.”, Harry said quietly, breaking the silence between them.
If you are interested, I would like to meet up again. Sunday?
Malfoy looked different. He had lost every trace of a baby face, and sitting next to him was now an undoubtedly attractive man, with angular features, a jawline to die for and beautiful lips now dragging themselves up into a crooked smirk, instantly turning the hot stranger into a very familiar Draco Malfoy. “Good evening, Potter.”
Harry hadn’t intended to stay this long, but he didn’t mind either. He had lost track of time after the second whiskey - and it was not like anybody was waiting for him at home, he thought bitterly.
This was the whiskeys speaking, Harry thought and felt his face heat up but Malfoy threw his head back and laughed loudly. “Oh, watch yourself! The bigger the ego, the smaller are other compartments the muggles say.”, he joked and winked.
Harry was excited, to say the least. As Sunday, 2pm came around, he had thought very thoroughly of the possibility of Draco Malfoy to be interested in him as much as Harry was interested in Malfoy. The attraction had sparked unexpectedly between them, but after last night it felt right to go out on a date - it was a date, wasn't it? - with him. And it was an understatement to say Harry was curious to unravel the mystery this new and changed Draco Malfoy presented.
He waved dismissively. “No, stay. It’s not my bar.”
But after ten minutes, Malfoy ordered two shots of an unfamiliar liquor, to prove his argument in the heated discussion that broke out between the two old rivals. “And I am telling you, when you drink this first, then take a sip of the soda, it does taste like bacon! Here, try- thank you.”, Malfoy took the two shot glasses and shoved one to Harry. “Try it yourself. Let me show you.”
I apologize for disappearing so abruptly after yesterday’s events.
“Another one on the woman there then, please.”, Harry said, leaning onto the bar while nodding in her direction, closing his eyes and relishing the feeling of amber alcohol burning down his throat. He was sober enough to remember that this should be his last one, but intoxicated enough to enjoy the slight swinging of the room around him.
Before he could question himself further, Harry interrupted his thoughts. “Do you know the café here? Why did you pick it?”
After his father had been sentenced to a lifetime of Azkaban, Draco had taken the chance of turning his life around. He had burned bridges with all of the beliefs his father had instilled in him and freed himself of Lucius just like his mother. Narcissa had taken on her maiden name again and had started completely renovating the Malfoy Manor, turning it into the Black Estate. They both decided to never let themselves become the people they left behind.
Lyra's voice finally pulled Alex's attention back to the fire. "Down, please," Alex whispered, and Draco set the boy down, marvelling as Lyra took the child's hand, pale fingers wrapping around small, golden ones.
He found her in Teddy's room. She was chattering away a mile a minute while Teddy listened intently, his hair back to its trademark blue. He was dressed in a pair of jeans and a dark-blue jumper, clearly ready to leave this place. He met Draco's eye and grinned.
"Mrs Figg," Harry answered, and he leant forward to give her a hug.
"Susie," he said, and it came out like a whine.
When I went off to Hogwarts, I'd begun to hope for something more, something different. And while it was indeed different, the darkness of my teenage years was haunting in a way that even my younger self could never have imagined. Later, I'd found my hope for the future in Teddy, and I'd wrapped myself in that entirely so when he'd gone off to school, his absence was filled by the darkness I'd always had chomping at the edges.
Draco nodded, feeling guilty at not having worried about his daughter in all of this. He'd thought of her, but not concerned himself with her well-being. He looked at Harry again.
"I know. Me too." Harry closed the distance between their lips and kissed Draco softly.
"Did you find it?"
"I don't know. I'm happy for them. I really am."
Hermione's hand on Draco's shoulder startled him slightly. "Do you want me to stay with him so you can go with Lyra?"
Harry grabbed Draco's wand from where it lay on the cushion and cast a lubrication spell, coating his hand liberally before grasping both of them together and moving.
"Gross," Ginny groaned, but Luna gave a little hum.
— Harry knew. He knew too well what Draco fought against and still came out the other side. And Harry wanted it too.
Harry sighed and this time, his yawn was long and drawn out, and his head fell to the side. "I'm so tired. I think I need to sleep some more. Will you lie with me?"
"Seriously?" Harry looked at the little magazine in awe, then her words sunk in. "Wait, what do you mean, 'try it on?'"
I threw the meat into the skillet, determined to finish making dinner even if I didn't plan on eating it. I took out my frustration by mashing the meat mercilessly. Fuck.
"Whatever I want. At the moment, I mostly want to piss him off, but I'm sure I'll come up with something better later. And I want to be myself. I don't want to hold myself back anymore, to worry about people's blood status or political clout before I decide to be their friend. I want to just
"Thanks, Draco. You too."
But, you should start as you mean to go on, his mother always said, so Draco straightened his shoulders and set to work.
, and I hope you might check it out.
Harry turned his head slightly, finally making eye contact. He looked so lost. "They're dead. I—"
"Early mornings give me headaches," Harry said, grimacing.
After their delightful lunch in the park, during which time Harry called him Draco four times—four!—Draco began to make plans to return the favour. He didn't cook, but perhaps he could take Po— er, Harry, out to lunch at that new pub on the corner.
And today, Draco would see. Draco would know. And Harry couldn't do anything about it, because there was literally no chance he could get through today without Draco at his side.
Ginny grinned. "That's more like it. And Draco, they didn't have your fancy avocado spread, so you'll have to make do."
Harry laughed. "Fuck you," he said and captured Draco's soft lips with his. It was even better than the first time because now Harry knew it was what he wanted and that Draco seemed to want it too. A cheer finally caught his attention from the direction of the table where his friends sat, closely followed by much of the pub. Harry didn't hurry the kiss, though, and indulged himself in Draco's tongue caressing his own.
"Ah," Draco said, and the subsequent silence filled the room.
"I brought us lunch again," he said as Draco sat down.
"I practically killed her father."
And that was that. He's been there next to me ever since.
"Yeah?" Harry's eyes were wide and excited.
Draco's eyes met Ron's; Draco filed away the sorrow and pity he saw in the blue eyes to be considered later. For now, he needed to not think about any of it. He needed to concentrate on facts.
"Leave him alone," Ron finally managed. "You'll break him. Oi, Harry, your essay?"
She sat quietly for nearly a minute, then started speaking in a thoughtful tone. "Did I ever tell you about the second time I ever met Harry?"
“Malfoy,” a rough voice said in surprise, followed by a strained, “Ohhhh, fuck.”
That was what duelling with Malfoy was like. I felt graceful and powerful, and the beauty of the dance between us was something I was aware of from the very first spell. Each spell I cast, I knew he'd be there to parry. When it came to an end, we were both panting and the room smelled of ozone and sweat. The rest of the students were stunned, but the instructor simply grunted, offered us a nod of approval, then told the rest of the class to do what we did.
He opened his mouth to interrupt because of course, he knew all this, but she held up a hand to stop him, so he let her continue.
He shuffled the glass of wine to the side and pushed up his sleeves in aggravation, picking up the sponge by the sink and starting to clean. His rant continued in his head as he went, irritably scrubbing at the drops of wine that had fallen onto the granite countertops as Draco cooked. Rosemary needles and thyme leaves were littered everywhere, even the floor, onion peels were in the sink, potatoes skins on a plate next to the cooktop.
