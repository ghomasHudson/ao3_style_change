"Will someone please tell me what is going on and why is young Mister Snape's familiar angry?" he looked at everyone in the room with his trademark glare.
The jeweller smiled and went to get it for him and brought it back, "sir this one here can have any birthstone placed in it, would you like that or would you perfer to keep it like it is?" Harry looked over to Severus and he smiled back.
The group split up to do their own thing or just to meet other friends, this left Harry and Draco alone to have a little date of their own..
Stepping out of the classroom and into the hallway after he had cleaned up the room he notice Harry walking towards the Headmasters office, as this was Severus' free period he called out to his son.
Also as you all heard at breakfast I am his father now and I would like each and everyone to look out for him as you can all tell he is very skittish and will hide when he is scared which normally is within my robes of all things.
"Off you go Padfoot you shouldn't be so scared you have your motor cycle" said Remus chuckling at his best/ boy friend.
"Hadrian you don't have to leave if you don't want to but remember that you are now a Slytherin, I won't let you go back to what horrid you have been through.
Tom got up from his seat and introduced himself to everyone, he welcomed them to the new school year even though it was coming to the end of November but in his book it didn't count as it was the start of his new career, his new place at work he count wait.
His godparents are Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy but I would be quite happy to have you as his godparents as well but I'm worried that might not be able to work as of yet.
Otiz woke up not knowing where he was and so he panicked and started crying, completely forgetting that he could very easily sense Harry as well as sniff him out.
Harry took the letter and slowly opened it after he had finally managed to transform his animal into the required water goblet. Whoop whoop!
"Dad...... that was so scary..... now I'm going to be picked on yet again!" cried Harry into his chest, tears and snot going everywhere. Yuck!
"Not going to take it from you Theodore honest I don't like tea, plain black coffee is lovely" and he smiled at him.
Lucius looked at he time and when he saw that it was now ten at night thought it would be best for the Snake family to leave as tomorrow was the start of the new school year.
Albus the boy, my son was beating to an inch of his life for Merlin's sake, it took everything I had to keep him alive. My potions were near depleted because of it".
"The great Lucius Malfoy being called Lu-Lu is way to much to handle. I think I will call you that from now on" said Tom as he got up and left, heading up to the Headmasters office changing the password to 'seven emeralds' and so when he entered the office he went to work right away.
"You want me to forgive you! You put that girls need to learn over the emotional turmoil she put my son through, my Hadrian has been bullied by them, money stolen, paid to be his friends.
"Thank you for that, its been really helpful" and she turned to leave but was stopped by the second year saying "it needs to stop, it isnt fair for everyone else who does the work like we are meant to. She's been getting away with it for far too long!"
"Mum don't please" begged her two eldest and she slowly sat down only to be nudged by Otiz and then licked on her hand, the same with the rest of the Weasely's.
Tom at that point decided to come in holding Harry's trunk that was finally packed after the "help" of Otiz and smiled when he saw that the child was taking a nap.
"Otiz what in blue blazes was that all about" said Harry once he was finally put down onto the ground, but Otiz just growled his eyes flashing from their normal emerald green to a blood red, he was pissed to say the least of it all.
"Oh can it Granger!" said a Slytherin to her tutting that she would argue with a teacher and Flitwick at that, one of the nicest professors around!
"Fawkes don't do that you don't know where he has been" said Tom gently rubbing his feathers, turning to Albus he introduced himself again as the last time he saw him they were in the court session regarding Harry.
Harry looked up and saw silver eyes and blond hair next to him, Draco was there for him, if it wasn't his father it would always be Draco and his friends.
His room had nothing but a thin rag of a blanket, no pillow and a mattress that should of been thrown out years ago, there were bars on his window and seven! Yes you heard me seven locks on his door and a freakin cat flap that was also locked so then he couldn't even get out to wash and use the bathroom!
"Ah yes I forgot to tell you that she was allowed to go to Hogsmeade today, how did it go? Her assignments have been improving and no cheating was involved so I thought a reward would be a good idea" smiled Tom only to be met by a shocked face of Minerva and a glare from Severus.
Remember Gringotts and the Ministry all know that you are my son and that you are now in Slytherin so you may go back to your dorm and wait for me" Harry nodded to his father and left the room, the air tense with two formidable wizards in the room.
Little did anyone know it was going to be one of the children's favourite rides out of the whole park, the adults waited down at the bottom while all ten children and a familiar went on the coaster, all you could hear as they came down were screeches of joy, or in Blaise, Draco and Percy a cry in fear and they just hoped that they wouldn't be ill afterwards.
They landed in Severus' private room within the castle walls which was a surprise as they didn't know where she was going to send them.
The next few days where exicting for Harry, he loved every minute of it, he just couldn't sit still for a moment!! He was like a kid on Christmas morning.
"Blasted old pictures I should of snuffed them all out and leave mine there instead" muttered Albus to himself, Fawkes just looked at him and trilled and left as well. He was starting to not like this Headmaster anymore.
He wanted to have his friends back but due to now being in Slytherin and that Severus is now his father it was hard, he knew he should count his lucky stars to be finally out of the Dursley's, he finally had someone who truly loved him all he wanted was his friends back.
"Mr. and Mrs. Weasely I'm sorry if I have upset anyone, I've just had enough of him having a go at me for me gaining something I never had" said Harry but everyone knew that there was something more to it.
As you know if Otiz if isn't familiar with you, he will take a while to warm up to you and if he does he will lick your hand and once he deems you a friend. He bit Hadrian and so they are the familiars to each other, well the rest of us he had licked our hands, he has deemed us as friends and so he will protect us with everything he's got morso Hadrian".
There was a bucket in the corner of his room that he was using!! I had to get him out of that environment to save his life!!" said Severus shouting at the end to make his point clear.**
He looked towards Harry asking if it was ok when he was told who it was, Harry to be honest loved the women she was nice but strict, just like Severus really mind you.
"Our Haddy-kins is growing up so fast" the finished together, only to be tackled to the floor by Otiz in fox form.
"I've slept with every boy in my year in my house and I'm seeing at least half of the other houses!"
Within half an hour most of the class had it, sadly not Hermione which she wasn't happy about, Otiz just smiled and pointed his wand at her without any movement of it the spell was fired and she started laughing.
Once paid for both were handed back to him making him smile, the staff member wanted to ask more but decided to leave it as it wasn't his place to say.
"Severus my boy the child must go back to his relatives, he is safe in the blood wards and his family" Albus snapped back.
Who cares that the spoilt brat was now adopted by his stupid depressing dungeon dweller of Hogwarts, it meant nothing to him! He would get the brat back sooner or later. It was only a matter of time!
Hermione got up and walked out of the Hospital Wing in a huff going back to the common room, everyone ignored her and so she headed up to her room slamming the door.
The teachers didn't care that I was behind in my school work to be honest I think they are scared of my cousin and his parents to care for my welfare but they did try to give me some extra food at lunch when my cousin wasn't looking as well as his gang.
Albus flew at the second year only to have Percy, Fred and George get to him in time and pulled the poor boy out of the way.
Otiz curled round the chair making sure they both were safe and nothing could harm them, while everyone said a quick hello to each other.
Olivia Freya Clarks neé Wilson, 60 years old, brown hair and eyes. Hallie's mother an a stay at home mother, loves to bake. AKA Liv
Now onto planning how the twins will get their own back on their siblings.......... So many to chose from
"Welcome Harry, once again to a new year" smiled Albus with his grandfather like expression with that blasted twinkle in his eyes yet again.
If anything happens to him I would like one or a small group of you to bring him to me and no before any of you say I don't mind if I'm teaching when you bring him to me" said Severus to the students and then slowly coaxed Harry out of his robes so then he could introduce himself.
You will help me with the house work as well as the garden, me and your brothers as well as your father will not speak to you and if we do we only want a yes form you. Your room will be stripped of evrything besides your clothes and bed.
Over an hour later and the prank finally wore off and they had finally started eating there meal but still no sign of Harry or Otiz for that matter.
Once he had drunk it all he placed the goblet down onto the table, signed his name and then crawled back into his father's lap and right there he started to slightly doze off again making everyone chuckle.
Yes we have the health scan which was done by the Goblins but it would also be helpful if we had the memories to match with them.
"Oh stop Severus we both know you have a concussion, I want you to take this pain potion and rest for the remainder of the day in your quarters, so then it's quiet. I will explain everything to Minerva" and she handed over the potion to him.
"Well our little Ronnikins and baby girl are going to have some secrets told that they don't want people to know about sadly" said George.
When they entered the room he noticed that it held two people that he knew quite well as well as what looked like to be the new Headmaster.
"You can't do that Otiz, you promised me and dad" this in turn made Otiz change back "he smell wike me!!" and he nuzzled into Harry's neck, while Harry sat back down.
So yet again being gentle as he could he brought Harry to Severus quarters and asked to portrait to get him for them, the portrait left only to reappear right away only to have the door open to a misheaving Severus at the door clad in dark green pyjama bottoms and a white top.
"I'm suck I haven't gotten a clue what to do, I miss my Sev" said Tom to no one in particular, he was walking the halls of Hogwarts lost as what to do.
The following day had the twins holding the Marauder's map searching for the Stooges as they had taken the liberty to called their younger siblings, Hermione and the Headmaster... but they were looking for someone pacific....
Draco caught some words which were 'no friends' 'dad' 'monsters' 'help' Draco knew he had to bring Harry to Severus right away he was breaking down.
Next they headed over to the building sets where Otiz picked out building blocks, a train set and a castle stating and I quote:
We can't have this going to court just yet until everything has come in but I have a feeling that it will be heading that way".
"Well I think Otiz should have some new clothes, I don't think we will be able to keep getting the blood out of Dudley's old clothes, thank Merlin I kept some" smiled Harry as he began to take of the item in question off the small boy.
Tom went to comfort him which he let him. Which surprised Tom more, he knew he did wrong and what he didn't know was how much it must of hurt his lover and his son.
I WANT YOU BOTH TO THINK ABOUT WHAT COULD OF HAPPENED IF WE HAD FOUND THIS OUT SOONER RATHER THAN OVER CHRISTMAS OF ALL THINGS! CHRISTMAS YOU HEAR ME!!
Severus was led into the room where he noticed that his son was in a light doze and went to sit down at the end of the bed, once sat Harry opened his eyes and smiled slightly.
Again he clamped his hands over his mouth!! He didn't want everyone to learn of this at all!! He was going to be in so much trouble!!
Albus couldn't and wouldn't care for the boy, thank Merlin that the Dursley's weren't there at that moment on time as he was trying to his who he was and if he killed them now they would know who he truly was.
Severus came up to his son and hugged him tightly and whispered assurances into his ear to help him calm down.
Harry was dressed in a deep green shirt which matched his eyes and black trousers and again highly polished shoes, his hair was tameable thanks to the adoption many months ago, it wasn't a bird's nest, thank Merlin for that. His robes was an almost black but it was in fact a very deep forest green.
"Hadrian son it's up to you? I can contact Lucius and Narcissa as well as Molly and Arthur and any other Weasely you want there" said Severus trying to make his son feel better.
Molly gave her two youngest a look at would even kill Voldemort himself ten times over and left to go back home on having done a good job of installing fear, she hummed as she walked to the floo.
Theo had been slimed more than enough times as he ignored Harry's questions about the park while Draco was out right ignored by Harry which didn't please the blond at all, Otiz had found it fun to stay in his child form and run amok braking anything and everything due to being frustrated with everyone holding back everything from the pair.
I just wanted to get out of there but when I got back at the end of the school year everything got a whole at lot worse, the punishments increased and what ever I did it was wrong in their books.
Otiz had fallen asleep waiting while they talked and so Harry took his wand out and performed the spell on the Porcupine still on his desk hiss-tree-fors and standing on his desk was a intricate pin cushion complete with pins what had lightening bolts, bats and foxes all over them.
Tom just sighed at her not going to get much out of her, he was trying to think of ways to get back in Severus' good books, he ended up swearing in parseltongue making Nagini laugh.
Amelia look towards Albus who was starting to sweat he did not want this he, wanted the brat to go back to the Dursley's that's all that matters to him and so he looked to his attorney who was now sweating and starting to hyperventilate he knew he wouldn't win this case he knew new he would lose his twins due to watch Albus done.
"Ok then" he yawns and starts to eat when the food appeared is favourite of shepherds pie with a green salad and for pudding treacle tart and pumpkin juice, he ate the whole lot even asking for seconds on the shepherds pie, he soon settled back into sleep.
"Otiz what in Merlin's name have you done to my father now" asked Harry only to have Severus reply with "destroyed the Skele-gro I was making for Poppy, the little imp thought it would be funny to change the Chinese Chomping Cabbage for normal cabbage" and he glared at him.
Speaking of adoring fans, a voice not belonging to Ginny yelled down the train carriage, “I found them! Down here!”
Malfoy was transported directly into a memory, unlike Harry, who had been transported into that dark, empty space.
It was wishful thinking. It actually hurt more than it healed and yet Harry couldn't help himself but to dream of it. If he only had one more chance to see them, to thank them, to tell them how much he missed them.
Harry felt Malfoy’s own stomach drop and he stilled before turning around and throwing a silent spell at Harry.
Ron and Padma's costumes had everyone rolling in laughter. Both had electric blue leotards on. Ron's was coupled with bright green booty shorts, neon yellow leg warmers and armbands, and dazzlingly white trainers. Padma's had neon pink tights under the leotard, paired with bright green leg and arm warmers with matching shoes to Ron. Both had their hair teased to gravity defying heights.
“This sounds like loads of fun. I’m sure everyone will want to go.” Harry said and the pair in front of him smiled warmly.
Harry just rolled his eyes at that. They grabbed their brooms and greeted the Ravenclaw captain and tryouts before leaving them to do their own evaluations.
Harry tried to control his breathing so his current state wasn't noticeable. If the look on Malfoy's face was any indication, he wasn't selling it.
“Neville said he was by the back of the train.” Hermione reminded the group as they carried their bags further down.
Although he would never say it outloud, Draco thought as he sipped his tea, he knew how Harry took his too.
Harry watched him for a moment, Malfoy letting his hand travel to just below his heart before he felt Harry’s eyes on him. When he did, he dropped his hand immediately and looked away.
"...most drinks won't be more than a fiver, so if you hand them this," Michael held up a five pound note, "they'll hand you back the change."
Little sidenote, I know some of the costumes they're wearing don't actually exist yet when Harry Potter is set in but they were too fun to pass up! This chapter is one of my favorites of the whole story, it has so many awesome moments!! There should be around 4 chapters left! I'm finishing up the final edits and rewrites, can't wait to let you all read it!
Blaise laid back as he watched the interaction between Draco and Harry, smiling in what he hoped was a seductive or at least comforting way when Draco glanced over at him. Whatever his smile looked like, it appeared to work, because Draco pushed himself up out of the armchair, adjusted himself in his trousers and ran a hand through his hair. As Draco approached the bed, Blaise twisted his body upright and joined the other two men.
Blaise rolled his eyes at their antics but still grabbed Harry’s arse to prevent him from tumbling to the floor when he leaned his head back to lick into Draco’s mouth for another dirty kiss. “Draco can get whatever he wants,” he commented. “As he likes it.”
“Yeah, me too,” Harry breathed, and Draco could tell he was almost there. If he managed to stave off his orgasm until Blaise came, it would be his come shooting against his walls that pushed him over the edge. “It’s okay,” he added.
“Hi,” he finally replied, allowing Blaise to wrap their arms around his chest as he tilted his head back.
"You should fuck Blaise," he said then, right when Harry's movements stilled and his jaw dropped as his climax surged through him.
Harry started moving up and down on his knees, his arse rubbing against Blaise’s erection as he did so. Draco could see the leaking precome glistening on Blaise’s cock and swallowed, knowing that this was only the beginning.
“Fine, sorry.” Draco rolled his eyes and then turned to face Harry, hand moving to play with his unruly hair. “I’ve told you about that fantasy of mine, haven’t I? Where I watch you having sex with someone else.”
Moving his head further down, he sat on his legs and let his tongue trail along the seams of Blaise’s black boxer shorts. The thin fabric didn’t leave much to the imagination and Harry’s mouth watered at the idea of getting to taste him. He wrapped his arms around Blaise’s knees and mouthed at the bulge, wetting the stretchy cotton where it concealed the head.
“Sweet Merlin, look at you,” Blaise whispered, moaning when Harry took him back into his mouth, deeper this time, until the head bumped against the back of his throat. He sucked hard when he pulled off, his tongue pressing against the underside, and didn’t pause before taking him back in. He bobbed his head a couple of times, alternating between licking, sucking and humming until Blaise squeezed his shoulder.
Lifting the charm, he inhaled the scent of Blaise’s Italian ragout. His mouth watered at the thought of getting to eat it soon while he hummed as he put away the groceries he’d bought on his way home.
Harry twisted his neck and clacked his tongue when he caught sight of Blaise’s hand moving languidly over his own cock. “None of that, big boy,” he drawled, turning around and stalking towards the bed. He swung his leg up and sat himself down on Blaise’s lap. “Draco wants his turn.”
“I would,” Harry croaked, hands drifting to Draco’s arse. “But I can’t exactly offer him a pint at the pub next week and ask, can I?”
“You’re still free tomorrow night, right?” Draco asked offhandedly on Sunday morning. He was looking over the Prophet while Harry prepared brunch.
Harry’s cock was pressed between their stomachs now and Draco could see the precome smearing across their skin. He wanted to taste it, suck Harry off while he was fucked into oblivion by Blaise, but he’d promised… promised to just sit here and watch, so he did just that.
Harry snorted. “No, he didn’t actually. Hermione was a month early. Pregnancy brain, she claims.” He turned off the heat under the bacon and turned around, leaning against the furnace as he watched Draco. “Why? Did you have plans?”
It took them a while to get their wits together, and Draco needed that time to mentally talk himself down from coming in his pants like a third year with a roommate who apparently hates clothes.
and even throwing around I love you’s? Finally, he unlocked his screen again and typed out a final message.
“Should I prep you?” Draco heard Blaise ask but Harry shook his head and murmured a wandless preparation and lubrication spell, shivering when they took effect. Usually Harry liked being fingered open, slowly and thoroughly, but tonight he was obviously too impatient to take that road. Draco could relate.
Millicent spoke first, “If we were going to try and hurt you, do you really think we would be here right now?”
Harry tensed automatically and found himself unconsciously backing away from the case. He felt the heat of the Fiendfyre on his back again, as if it were still right behind him. Of all the horrors he faced during the war, that was one of the worst. He had nightmares of not surviving the fire almost weekly. Or of Ron and Hermione not escaping.
Hermione shook her head, “No ‘Blossom’ is from a cartoon. Her and her sisters Buttercup and Bubbles have special powers to fight crime.”
“Save it, Potter. And get off the ground, you'll cause a scene.” Draco said, trying to sound unbothered but his voice was even shakier than before.
Malfoy was slipping on his shirt as Harry walked into the bathroom. For a split second, Harry caught a glimpse of Malfoy’s chest, and a ripple like white line just below his left shoulder.
“Pansy’s actually the one who suggested it. Well, we both thought of it at the same time but that’s really neither here nor there at the moment. We realized it had to be someone who would have wanted a relationship out of the public eye,” Draco could hear the tension in his voice at the word relationship, shifting his gaze from Harry, ”someone who would make sense, who I’ve been seen with before this week,”
“When performing legilimency, it is extremely important to know your basic rules. Most importantly, however, you must have your partner's consent…”
"This Friday, all classes will be canceled. Instead, we will be hosting a school wide House Unity Quidditch match!"
Two days later Nolan’s wedding was still on Draco’s mind. Unfortunately Potter still seemed to be his best option.
Harry made his way to the Quidditch Pitch in the silence of the early morning. It was a nice reprieve to walk along the grounds at this hour. As he made his way closer, he could see Ginny setting up the various equipment for the tryouts.
“Over here!” Neville called as they got closer. They all sped up, excited to see their friend after so long.
Harry looked up to see half the group staring at him. He tried his best to keep his face neutral, not wanting to cause a problem the first night back.
Harry had shut his eyes tightly when Malfoy got up, not wanting to chance Malfoy realizing he was awake.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off down the road, no real intention to where they were going. They popped in to see George and he brought them to the back to show off a new type of popping ears candy. They spent the rest of the afternoon doing some miscellaneous shopping, going to the bookstore for more parchment and poking around in
is where you go to get the best tea. I’ve been saying it for years! Daph and I go every time, no place better.” Theo said excitedly, Daphne smiling softly and nodding in agreement. She reached over and raked her hands through the slight curls on the back of his head.
Harry nodded and grabbed his belongings once more and walked into the bathroom before Draco. He quickly turned on the shower and got in, stripping down inside the closed curtain.
She raised a third finger and waggled them in Draco's face, "And number three, the two of you are actually friends now. Whether you want to believe it or not."
That Saturday Harry woke up (to his dismay) bright and early. His poor attitude lasted only until he began to get dressed. As he pulled on his Quidditch trousers and jersey, a giddy feeling started to rise in his stomach. While he laced up his boots he was positively drumming with energy. Last thing he did was grab his broom and quietly leave the dormitory, his roommates both sound asleep.
Malfoy walked out of the bathroom then, also in uniform. Harry watched him as he walked by, the neatly stitched “Malfoy” in green letters catching his eye. For no apparent reason, seeing his last name written out like that made Harry’s stomach do the slightest flutter.
“Alright then, don’t just stand there, pull up a seat.” Blaise said, already standing from the circular table and dragging a chair in between himself and Draco, gesturing for Harry to sit.
Harry's own costume hadn't needed much to perfect. He had slipped the tunic over his head and applied the various gold accessories. He laced up his wrap around sandals, his strong calves accentuated by the straps. His arms were framed rather nicely by the squared neckline of his toga. The finishing touch was the golden laurel wreath placed upon his head.
“It’s so...different than I was expecting.” Harry said and Draco could hear the honesty in his voice.
With that the whole group let out a cheer. A few of the more money knowledgeable headed to the bar to buy. They came back with strange looking drinks, smoke rising from the top and vivid colors in the glasses.
“Very. Fishnets, short shorts, crop top, the works.” Justin explained. Wolf whistles left the crowd and Blaise basked in the attention.
Malfoy was coming in from the other side, both almost equal distanced from the Snitch. A perfectly shot Bludger came zooming towards Malfoy, causing him to pull back to avoid it.
“Ms. Parkinson and Ms. Padma Patil here.” McGonagall called as she pointed to the next desk. Thankfully, that left Harry with Dean. He leant down to pick up his bag and move to his seat.
Blaise shook his head, “They want everything to be a surprise. But knowing them, they’ll probably play some that we used to play back in the Slytherin dorms.”
Blaise went to the bathroom next, and then Harry followed when he left. Obviously he could have gone in while Blaise was in there, but he figured everyone could use a little privacy on their first day back.
Harry’s throat felt tight and he took the flowers wordlessly. He walked the last few steps alone, Malfoy hanging back. Harry felt tears forming and he wiped his eyes slowly. He placed the bouquet down carefully and sank to his knees in front of his parents' grave.
Millicent and Blaise recounted the hunt they had gone on to find a specific shade of green cloth that had somehow taken them throughout Hogsmeade.
The Ghostbusters were running around the Common Room with their handmade equipment screaming about ghosts being in the room. It was hectic and it was loud but no one cared because it was so fun.
“I think to keep this seeming as real as possible, we shouldn’t tell anyone about it being fake.” Harry said.
Harry walked over and sat quickly. Both of his morning classes he was stuck with Malfoy, he thought to himself. It was going to be a
As he quickly walked from the table he heard Ron quietly ask "Do you think he slept at all last night?"
An idea sprung in Harry's mind. "Should we dance to this? Since neither of us know how we can't be wrong."
Just as people were finishing up in the Common Room the two boys downstairs strolled in. Blaise was first and when he came fully into view all the Eighth Years went wild. He had on the smallest pair of shorts known to man that just barely covered his ass. His shirt was cropped, revealing his stomach and the trace of his happy trail. The fishnets showed off his legs and the drawn on tattoos Draco had done.
Harry laughed loudly, already knowing what it was. A long, low cut, figure hugging black dress with billowing sleeves. Ron looked about ready to combust on the spot just thinking about it, Harry wasn’t sure how he was going to survive actually seeing her in it.
It took Draco by surprise and before he could stop himself he was responding, “I don’t know about you, Potter, but this isn’t my first kiss. I think I can manage.”
Malfoy frowned. “Since when did you care about being on time to class? Every Potions class we had together you walked in late. Not to mention all the classes you missed due to
Draco started to pull back and for just a moment it seemed as if Harry followed him. He opened his eyes to Harry's face only inches from his own. Harry's eyes were dazed, his lips parted and red. Draco was sure he looked the same.
Thank you so so much to everyone who has commented and left kudos so far! It truly means so much to me to hear your guys' thoughts!
“Good to see you again mate.” Dean said as they settled in. Seamus clapped his hand against Ron’s shoulder, laughing happily as Ron did the same.
All the Slytherins at the table burst into sharp laughter. Harry smiled softly but he couldn't stop himself from glancing at Hermione. She was wearing a similar expression. Harry watched as Ron's hand moved to wrap around hers.
Draco gave him an irritated look. "I can do simple maths. Now that I know what a bloody quid is." he grumbled as he walked up to the bar, dress trailing slightly behind him.
Malfoy must have made up his mind, because he looked around the aisle quickly to make sure they were alone before saying softly,“I never got the chance to-”
“Come on Granger, let's check out our new room.” Pansy said with a grin as she and Millicent locked arms with Hermione. She let out a small yelp before going slightly pink.
A staircase across from the front door led upstairs to his bedroom, the bathroom and a small guest room. The house was small, much smaller than the Manor, and yet Draco wouldn’t have it any other way.
Malfoy must have sensed Harry’s stare, because he turned toward him and gave a quizzical look. Harry shrugged but looked away quickly.
If someone had told Harry he would have spent half his afternoon with Pansy Parkisnon and Millicent Bulstrode and actually
When they pulled up at the station, Harry told Neville, Ginny, and Luna to go without them, as he, Ron, and Hermione wanted to see Hagrid first.
Harry looked surprised, was the first thing Draco noted. The second was that Harry hadn’t kicked him out yet.
As his mind drifted back to his parents, Harry felt a hand gently press against his shoulder. He looked up to see Draco placing two glasses of water in front of him. Draco sat down wordlessly across from him and took one of the glasses for himself. They sat without speaking until both glasses were empty.
Harry thought with quiet pride at Malfoy’s success. Harry stood up and took a breath. Suddenly, the ground beneath him shifted and Harry staggered down and started sliding to the left. He tried to grab onto something,
McGonagall waited for the laughter to quiet down again before saying, “To our Eighth Years, it is our pleasure to have you back. You will all, I'm sure, be studying just as hard as you would have last year for your NEWTS.”
As he said that, Pansy Parkinson, Millicent Bulstrode, Theodore Nott, Daphne Greengrass, and Draco Malfoy piled into their carriage.
“No, I just...I don't know. It's odd, is all. And besides, the Slytherins said they wanted to be friends.”
Harry had gone to Gringotts for them and exchanged some money for Muggle money. That way everyone would be able to buy drinks at the bar. This led to an impromptu lesson on Muggle money. One Galleon was about five pounds though this led to grumbling about how improbable paper money was.
Shaking his head, Draco poured some water into the potion, staring into it like it held an answer he had been longing for.
Malfoy didn't respond at first, adjusting the sleeve of his blazer. He picked up a bottle of broom cleaner and said, “Same as you I suppose. I'm sure McGonagall won't allow me to join the team this year, but it felt strange not stopping in anyway.”
Malfoy shifted, bringing Harry back to the present. He seemed to be struggling internally about what to do next. He opened and closed his mouth before simply staring at the broom cleaner.
“Daffodils symbolize eternal life, Gladiolus’ symbolize remembrance, Lisianthus’ represent gratitude, and Carnations, love.” he explained in a small rush, gently handing Harry the bouquet.
Other nights he imagined finding the Mirror of Erised and seeing them stand behind him once more. The phantom weight of a hand on his shoulder and his parents smiled down on him.
Just want to say a quick thank you to everyone who has commented and left kudos! It's so lovely to see people enjoying this story as much as I enjoyed writing it.
Draco groaned, “Of course I thought it out. And he made the most sense. Besides, I already asked him and we’ve already planned it all out.”
Even without his glasses, Harry could see Malfoy’s arm, right above his heart. It struck Harry as odd that Malfoy was always rubbing at that spot. Then realization hit.
Harry did in fact. Hermione getting her hair done by the same girls who ridiculed her for it almost daily, all while planning a party with them. It was all so absurd the three broke into a fit of laughter as they walked.
“Ah well that must have been fun. For the two of you. I bet.” He forced a smile onto the end of his sentence which only caused Draco to raise an eyebrow.
They waved at Ginny and Luna before sitting at their table. A few younger years stared at them in awe and whispered to one another.
“I'll go get Luna.” Ginny said after they had settled in. “She's been owling me like crazy about the new issue of the Quibbler. Did you know a new species of Wrackspurt was just discovered?” Ginny raised her eyebrows and let out a small laugh before leaving.
Of course, always wanting to make an entrance, Blaise had chosen to get ready in their room. He forbade anyone except Draco from entering and so the two of them were still downstairs.
“Not that I’m not grateful for the help. I just wouldn’t want to force you to do something you probably would rather not.” Draco clarified.
Their interaction put even more energy in the group. As they walked Harry felt himself drifting closer to Malfoy until they were walking shoulder to shoulder. Malfoy made no mention of it and neither did he.
The trio walked over, stopping at the bar to say hello to the bartender Dolan, and order their butterbeers. When they made it to the group of Slytherins’ Pansy wrapped Hermione into a hug, mumbling “it’s been so long” and “haven’t seen you all day”.
Harry gave her a small smile, “Thank you, and I know. But I want to. I’m sure it’ll be fun. And Mum and Dad would want me to enjoy myself I’m sure. It’ll be my first Halloween without the Dursley’s leaving me home or the threat of being killed hanging over my head.” He tried to joke.
That Saturday was the first Hogsmeade trip, and the Eighth Years all traveled down together before splitting up in groups to do their own shopping.
“Nott’s actually not so bad. He doesn't say much, so me and Neville just went to bed early.” Ron mused and he wrapped an arm around Hermione’s waist. They both turned to Harry, waiting for his answer.
He ran all the way back to the Common Room, yelling the password and catching his breath as the door slowly sunk down.
“After the Feast, I ask you all to wait back as I briefly explain some new rules. Most importantly however,” McGonagall continued with what seemed to be tears brimming, “
“For our first lesson, I thought we would make Gregory's Unctuous Unction! Not a terribly difficult potion to brew, and a very fun one at that! Now, who can tell me what it does?”
And with that he stood up with a smile to the group and excused himself, disappearing to the bathroom.
“That’s where my issue comes in.” another deep breath, and he carried on. “I’m man enough to admit that I don’t want to show up to my ex-boyfriend’s wedding alone. I’m also not dumb enough to ask any random bloke off the street.”
“What’s in this?” Draco asked as he eyed it curiously. His drink was bright blue while Harry’s was bright green.
McGonagall carried on, “I know I need not remind you what our past year has looked like. Which is why, every first Friday of the month will be known as “Inter House Unity” day.”
“Oh, well, you know.” Luna said, with such an air of simplicity that no one pressed the subject further.
This time Harry nodded. “Yeah, you’re right. I don’t mind a bit of cuddling up. And,” he scratched the back of his head, “if the situation calls for it, a kiss or two wouldn’t be crazy.”
“Sorry.” Harry mumbled and let go. They walked over to the only available desk and sat down together. Harry placed his bag onto the ground and dug around it before sighing.
Harry looked up to see Hermione’s cheeks had gone slightly pink but Ron reached over and placed his hand over hers.
First, there was Theodore Nott and Daphne Greengrass who Harry honestly had no problems with. They kept to themselves and their friends and never outwardly did anything to Harry and his.
His entire face was flush and his cheeks were ablaze. His lips were the same bright red and his hair was tousled. He held the edge of his sink and could feel the tangle of Harry's hair between his fingers.
Draco quickly cleaned the mess and continued working, but now he had a scowl on his face and was turning red.
As always, let me know your thoughts on this chapter, and instead of what you think might happen next, what parts have been your favorite!!
"Right then, see you around." Draco said to the man with a smile as he gathered up their drinks. Harry gave him a quick nod before turning away. He placed a hand on Draco's lower back and ushered him to the table.
"Yeah." Draco answered. He paused for only a moment before continuing, "Actually Nott and I used to...help each other out when we were younger. Before he was with Daphne obviously."
“Because of this, there are new room assignments with new roommates.” A scroll appeared in McGonagall's hand and she tapped it with her wand. Copies of the list floated to each student.
Harry met up with Ron and Hermione in the Common Room. When they saw him their faces turned into an expression Harry knew all too well. It was their
The three of them made their way out to the Common Room and then all together they went to the Great Hall. Those who were not participating in the game had swapped colors again but since there were no classes, they were wearing each other's sweaters, scarves, or hats. Hermione was wearing someone's blue and silver striped sweater paired with someone else’s yellow and black hat.
Malfoy didn’t answer, just gave a curt nod before grabbing his own toothbrush and walking to the bathroom.
“It's odd isn't it?” Hermione said with a slight frown. “All these years Malfoy’s been nothing but horrible to you, but then he had such a visceral reaction to your...death.”
“Doesn't matter. They would have found out eventually, they're Slytherins after all.” Harry said causing Ron to snort out a laugh and Hermione to return to her normal color.
Mrs Weasley looked at Harry, probably expecting a look of dismay on his face. She knew how he felt about being in Diagon Alley while it was crowded. Instead, Harry smiled and asked, “Five minutes?”
Harry gave him an easy smile. “Why not? It’ll be fun getting one over on all those stuffy Purebloods. And, you seem like you need the help.”
Another pang in his chest. Sirius. He Harry did remember and he too Harry missed dearly. Harry flipped back to the wedding photo. Lily, James, Sirius, Remus, and Peter laughed happily at the photographer. They were fresh faced, no idea of what their lives would become.
After the teams cleaned up and showered they all walked back out. The other Eighth Years were on the Pitch waiting for them. If Harry and his team gloated just a little too much that night, no one paid them any mind. And if Harry continued to drift over to Malfoy during their celebration, no one paid that any mind either.
“From Star Wars! He’s badass Pans, perfect for you.” Hermione said. The frown was still on Pansy’s face.
The crackling fire, his favorite armchair, the various rugs and tapestries hung about.  It was a rush of familiarity that had Harry smiling softly in an instant.
Ron interrupted Harry again, “Malfoy’s afraid of changing in front of people? He probably has a small dick.”
invite you all to the start of the year bash thrown by the beautiful and lovely, Pansy Parkinson and Millicent Bulstrode!” Blaise began applauding and the rest followed suit.
As the match progressed Harry began actively searching for the Snitch. His team was behind but if he caught the Snitch now they would win. From across the field he saw Malfoy dive. He took off, flying as fast as his broom could carry him. The ground was pulling in close and Harry still didn’t see the Snitch. He saw Malfoy still and as Harry drew closer he could see him laughing.
And then later, as they all fought, the barely there struggle Draco gave in keeping the wands from Harry. And the split second look they shared, too many things written across both their faces, before Harry and the others had escaped.
“Next time you see the girls you’ll have to give your compliments.” Draco said as he led them to the kitchen.
The Slytherins seemed to have no problem settling in, but the Gryffindors had still yet to say anything. They sat gaping at the Slytherins with questions zooming through their minds. Blaise looked around the cart grinning at everyone, Theo seemed as indifferent as ever, though he did glance at Daphne as she sat, and Malfoy was staring firmly out the window, one hand massaging his left shoulder.
Everyone nodded and so she dumped the names into the hat and Justin shook it up before holding it out for the first person to take.
“I’m not the one who looks like they need a break, Potter.” He sneered. “Aunt Bella made sure to revisit
A few nights after Halloween, Harry and Draco found themselves back in their dormitory without Blaise. They were sitting on Draco’s bed, Draco at the head fiddling with a pillow and Harry leaning against one of the posts, hands running over part of the sheer curtain of the canopy.
"The club is just around this way," Justin started as he walked, "we didn't want to be too close obviously."
The overall strangeness of the situation hadn't disappeared but Draco was at least able to kiss back this time. He let himself respond to the shift of pressure on his lips and the movement of a hand on his back. He let his own hand stroke the side of Harry's jaw softly. He was suddenly extremely aware of the smell of Harry's hair, his clothes, his skin. Draco couldn't ignore the fact that he was
The next day passed rather slowly. The morning was filled with Blaise’s laughter as Draco explained his situation with Harry, followed by him floo’ing in Pansy just so she could join in and gloat. The afternoon found him in the same boat, with Millie coming in after being owled earlier. She too found the entire thing hilarious, causing Blaise to double over in laughter again and leaving their patrons in confusion as Draco blushed madly at the register.
The entire house itself was an open floor, no doors closing off any rooms on the first floor, an invitation to himself as well as any guests to feel at home. Only an archway separated the kitchen from the living room but even that had a large opening.
He made sure they were never alone together for longer than three minutes, whether that was at a restaurant, bar, or otherwise. He rarely spoke to Potter without a buffer, only when work forced him too. Of course, he was always subtle about it. He didn’t want anyone to know he was carefully calculating his interactions with the other man. The only reason he was even so careful about it was to ensure their friend group didn’t implode from the inside because of old grudges and what not. Sure, they had all spoken at length about their past, but Draco could never be too careful.
It really was rather beautiful. He tended to the garden daily, making sure it always looked immaculate. Something he inherited from his mother. The house itself was rather cute, the wooden paneling blending in with the natural surrounding.
Blaise laughed at that, “Come on Potter, we might be Pureblood but we’re not daft. Millie’s Halfblood though, so she grew up watching movies and stuff.”
To their surprise, the person who opened their door was not a First or Second Year. It was Blaise Zabini.
Harry grabbed his bag and gave Malfoy a nod before joining up with Ron and Hermione. They gave him expectant looks but he shook his head. He'd tell them later, when fewer people were around.
If Harry hadn’t been staring at Malfoy, he wouldn’t have noticed the slight tensing of his shoulders.
Raising her arms in defense, Pansy calmly stated, “Hey, I still think it is a great idea. You and Potter are going to make a great couple.”
“Oh, I uh…” Harry mumbled. He didn't actually know, he just didn't want to stand next to Malfoy waiting for his water to boil. How awkward…
Their first class of the day was History of Magic, and Harry silently thanked Professor Binns for never assigning seats. It’s not that he had a problem sitting next to Malfoy, he’d just rather give Malfoy some space before they inevitably wanted to tear each other’s throats out.
if one did not attend a wedding. Of course, I don’t actually give a shit about tradition and all that but my parents both do. If I didn’t attend, the Malfoy name would be raked through the mud.”
Harry didn't know how to react so he just kept walking. Blaise let out an exaggerated moan as Harry pulled open the door.
It was quick, just a brush of his lips against Draco's own. Over almost quicker than it had happened.
“Care to let a few fellow classmates join you for a bit? You know, us Eighth Years have to stick together.”
Of course. Honestly, Harry didn’t know why he was expecting anything different. Louder wolf whistles left the crowd this time. Everyone started making comments at once “can’t break tradition!”, “how
"Do you, er I mean, did you fancy him?" Harry asked, trying to school his features. All of a sudden he felt clammy.
It's not even that he wanted to make him jealous. Far from it actually. The year he and Nolan were together was...intense.
“Alright, I’ve waited long enough.” Pansy said and ran up. She reached her hand in and frowned as she read her name. “Luke?”
Harry looked over at the blurry figure across from him. Malfoy seemed to be sleeping fine tonight, aside from the occasional movement.
“Terry, Anthony, Michael and I are going to Muggle London to celebrate Halloween this year, and we thought it would be great if we invited the rest of the Eighth Years to come too!” The two looked at Harry with matching grins.
Once he spilled into his own hand Harry frustratingly washed his body again, as if it would erase what had just happened. He felt completely off. He had never wanked to a boy before and certainly never to the thought of Malfoy.
"Ok we have exactly two minutes before the portkey is set to go. Make sure you have a hold on it." Justin said. Everyone moved around to grab onto a piece of the, quite fitting for the occasion, fake pumpkin.
. Without looking, he shoved Harry with his elbow, causing the other man to stumble into the wall beside them.
Halloween night the Eighth Year dormitory was a flurry of people getting dressed. Stations were set up to do makeup and costume alterations. All done without magic to keep with the spirit of the night.
Neither of them said anything as they stared at one another, Harry still planted in the trunk. It was another minute before Harry struggled up.
They spent the next few hours coming up with a detailed background to their relationship, going as far as to come up with reasonable weekly date nights (Thursdays, when Draco and Harry were the last ones in their respective shops.)
A few minutes after Ginny and Blaise left Draco picked up the crate from earlier. The delivery to The Copper Kettle in hand, Draco opened the door and started walking. Entering the shop Draco called out,
But there was no fighting. Harry took a moment to take in the scene before him. He saw himself, lying still in Hagrid's arms, surrounded by giddy Death Eaters. On the other side of the courtyard stood all his friends, his
“Excellent! Now whoever brews the best potion gets to keep it. Open your books to page one hundred thirteen everyone.” Slughorn looked around the room excitedly before instructing the students to get to work.
“I don't know how I'll cope, I'll miss you too much.” Harry said, making a kissy face at Ron, who shoved him away with a laugh. He would talk to Hermione and Ron about their room assignments later, away from listening ears.
“Thank you.” he whispered and Draco gave him a soft smile. He wanted to say more, wanted to let Malfoy know how much it truly meant to him to have someone there tonight, to have someone know he
“Purebloods are sneaky, they want to know the in’s and out’s of all new gossip they can find, and they will be looking for any slip up.”
Harry shrugged but felt his face start to heat up. “I don't know, he looked right at you, I just assumed-”
Well, maybe sexy wasn't the perfect word, but she definitely didn't look unattractive. The tan pants and white tunic looked expertly styled on her. Pavarti was sat a few steps away getting her hair in the classic Leia buns by Hermione.
Again, it happened, only this time a small cry came out with it. Harry was immediately struck with the reality of what he was hearing.
Upon hearing her voice, Malfoy froze. Something seemed to dawn on him and he scowled before placing the broom cleaner back on the shelf and turning around.
Blaise winked at him in  response. Blaise was also dressed in his uniform. It had the same multicolored border but instead of being white it was black. He turned around for Harry, pointing at the jewel green “Zabini” stitched into the back. The number eighteen just below it.
Having already agreed, and having another free period, the boys nodded and began their walk to Hogsmeade.
Before Harry could take in more of the room, Blaise climbed onto a table and cleared his throat loudly.
Hermione nodded but Harry dug through his bag for his schedule anyway. With everything that had happened yesterday he hadn't even remembered to check it. Sure enough, Charms was first. Harry jumped up from the table.
Blaise stood up with visible discomfort, obviously wanting to take the reins away from Nott, who was never one for words.
Harry was brought out of his thoughts when Draco jostled him in his haste to lean forward, his hands flat against the table and hanging off his seat.
An uncomfortable silence fell over the Hall. Harry watched as dozens of heads drifted to the Slytherin table, and he himself looked too. The whole table looked uneasy, as if they were being put in direct spotlight.
"Fuck the contest." Draco answered with a wave of his hand. "Do you want to get out of here?" he asked again.
All throughout breakfast the Eighth Years playfully taunted one another. Everyone who wasn’t playing was taking bets on the winning team while those who were playing were teasing the others' team skill level.
Harry couldn't fight the grin as he pulled a five out of Draco's hand and placed it in the other man's outstretched one.
“Ok that works out perfectly for me. Ginny and I broke up a year after the war ended. Just around when you and Nolan got together actually, I think. Then I had that...
"Have you ever been with a boy?" Harry asked before overthinking it. He honestly expected Draco to not answer but he wanted an answer.
Harry smiled back and made his way towards him. He jumped around with the three of them to the loud bass of the new track. Without really thinking, Harry snatched the golden crown off the top of Draco's head and placed it on his own with a laugh. Grinning, Draco reached for it a few times but eventually compiled as Harry evaded him.
From then on they did all the correct Pureblood things. Relationship Announcement dinner, Meeting the Parents dinner, and so forth. But Draco couldn't stand the formalities. Nolan knew this. They were constantly butting heads over it and it drove them both mad.
Harry flew down to the ground just in time to be crashed into by his team. They all began hugging and cheering, the cheering from the stands deafening.
Harry looked at who else had returned, seeing both the Patil twins and Sue Li, Hannah Abbott and Susan Bones, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Michael Corner and his friends Terry Boot and Anthony Goldstein.
Harry was about to share his thoughts with Ron but McGonagall stood and began walking towards the podium. The lively chatter of the Great Hall quieted down and McGonagall smiled.
"Reckon we definitely have a shot at winning." Draco said in response. The compliment to Harry was hidden in between his words.
“So, shall we get started?” Harry asked as their other classmates began practicing the newly learned spells.
McGonagall waited for a moment and then continued, “On these days, House tables in the Great Hall are encouraged to be split. No assigned seating. Furthermore, wearing the colors of another House is also encouraged. However, don’t think we won’t take away points from the correct House for any misbehavior.”
“Just yell if you need me, ok?” he whispered. Harry nodded. He understood Ron’s concern, but it wasn't needed. Hopefully.
Transfiguration was their second class of the day and Harry was anxious to meet their new Professor face to face. Surprisingly, when they walked into the Transfiguration classroom, McGonagall was standing there.
Malfoy found his name, glanced at Harry, and sat down with a huff. Harry stared forward intensely. As long as he didn't look at Malfoy, it would be like he wasn't there. Right?
“I just want to grab this.” He said, not really sure why, and he grabbed the broom cleaner Malfoy had just been holding.
Later on that evening, Draco watched as Harry began locking up The Copper Kettle. He called out to Blaise, saying his goodbyes for the night, and gathered his things.
Harry wasn't sure what to say either. He and Malfoy had never had an actual conversation. Or at least not one where they weren't ridiculing one another.
Soon, everyone was fully dressed and ready to leave. They took turns leaving the castle in small groups under the Cloak. Harry had given up keeping it a secret from the Eighth Years once Pansy and Millicent found out about it. Thankfully they all knew better than to speak about it to anyone outside their class. The last to leave was Harry, Blaise, and Draco.
Harry turned from his stove holding an empty mug and grinned, “Not to mention my house isn’t the least bit welcoming.”
Harry did as the book said. He grabbed his ladle and began stirring. His potion spilled over the side slightly but Harry wiped it with his robe and kept stirring.
Blaise let out a small chuckle, “And we are trying to work past that Hermione. We don't want to keep being enemies.” And with a twinkle in his eye, Blaise continued in a rush, “And you must not be so bad if Draco was able to fa-
Their last class of the day was Defense, and despite the new teacher, Harry was excited. As he, Ron, and Hermione walked in, Professor Dreada walked up to them.
After a few more moments of the boys standing frozen Pansy huffed out a breath. “Are you going to help us or not?”
Harry was already at his bed gathering his things. “Yeah, we’ve got that History of Magic test first thing too.” He dropped his toothbrush onto the ground and then his hairbrush fell out of his grasp.
identify him. The disbelief he felt when Draco said he couldn't be sure if Ron and Hermione stood in front of him.
Outside his door, Harry heard voices coming from inside. They must have been whispering since Harry couldn't make out any words. He didn't want to be accused of eavesdropping on his roommates so he opened the door.
This time as he danced, Harry couldn't ignore the nugget of thought that had been on his mind all day. His parents were at the forefront of his mind now. He knew they would want him to be having fun but he couldn't help but think he was letting them down. His first year he could actually visit them on their anniversary without fear and he wasn't.
The Fat Lady seemed surprised to see him at first but gave him a wide smile. She began to sing her most impressive aria as a way to welcome him home.
“No.” a full truth. Draco had no desire to be with Nolan, no desire to play the perfect Pureblood husband. And frankly, no desire to have Nolan in his life.
"You won't be able to do that Sirius, Harry is now Hadrian Severus Jameson Snape, he's been adopted by him both through the ministry as well as blood adoption he is no longer Harry James Potter" said Tom
Both of them walked in to the sound of a bell jingling above their heads, this made Harry smile to it, he was always told to wait outside with the Dursley's they didn't want to be seen with him but they would always make him carry everything that they bought, this time though it was different.
"Otiz" said Harry and when the cat heard the name he woke up and quickly bit Harry's finger drawing blood which was licked up right away, then nuzzled into his neck mewing.
"I have to admit that that's some impressive accidental magic, bring a stuffed animal to life" and he hugged his son tightly only to have the snake go up his arm and make his home around Severus' neck.
After what I have learnt about the two youngest I don't think that would be the right environment for him but on the other hand having five older brothers on hand might make it much better.
"I mustn't be doing the spell right, don't worry Luna I'll get them now in no time, sit back and watch Harry" she waved her wand again but they still didn't move.
"Molly, Arthur welcome I see you brought everyone else but please introduce everyone if you don't mind" said Severus trying to get Otiz off the twins.
"Harry come on, let's go back to our house now, everything will be forgiven" and she touched his shoulder making him scream out!
"It's a young Occamy a rare colouring if I say so myself normally they are turquoise not a blue" said Tom getting up to have a look at it more.
"....as I was saying he needs to be at his relatives he will be well protected against Voldermort, he saved the Wizarding world when he was just a baby and I know he will be able to do it once again.
Harry was in his room resting after visiting the Malfoy's which he had to admit it wasn't as bad as he thought it would be, even though he needed a Calming Daught and then fell asleep, the only thing that still had him worried was Draco. Were they still enemies or were they now friends considering that he was now Severus' son and that Severus was Draco's god father?! Who knew what was going to happen next..... Until there was a knock on his bed room door.
"Padfoot we can't take Harry away from what I've seen he's much better, I've read the reports for what his 'family' did to him and I have to say if Severus hadn't helped him that year he would of died, his former best friends tried to hurt him so many times, it was sad to watch really".
Remus ignored him and carried on explaining "...as I was saying Severus adopted Hadrian and what you thought Sirius of being godfather was stripped from you when the adoption and blood adoption took place his name changed to Hadrian Severus Jameson Snape as of August last year from what I was told by Severus and Tomas".
First it was memory from the age of three, his uncle burning his arm on the stove and then thrown out of the house in the dead of winter.
"Weally?" asked Otiz looking into matching green eyes and then into Onyx eyes of what he would call his grandad.
The rest of the group just looked at the two as they had no idea what hey we're saying and so had to wait until they had finished.
"What the hell happened to my beloved Ron?? You know he will be mine" and all three walked off, them not knowing that over half of the Great Hall had heard everything.
It had been two weeks since the Easter holidays had finally finished and everyone was getting ready for the end of year tests.... Merlin forbid Severus wanted to kill a few students for blowing up his cauldrons once again, he could understand the First and Second years but the older years no way in Hell would he forgive them!
They apparated right outside Gringotts bank and Harry doubled over in pain clutching his stomach in pain making Severus look at him as now he was white as a sheet of paper, as if he was about to throw up any second, right away Severus started to rub his back slowly making him feel better.
Harry was sitting in Transfiguration class listening on how to transform an animal into a crystal clear water goblets, Harry hated it as he only managed to half of it right and so was practicing with all his might, making sure the pronunciation was correct.
Both parents sighed but the girls just laughed harder making their father look at them saying "Jessica, Rebecca be nice ok your little brother just needs to see his psychiatrist again, that's all".
She nodded and sat down in the only other seat available, the other one was already occupied by Severus and his fire whiskey he was nursing.
"Nah it's more fun to take it from you when you don't expect it, plus in this form I am older than you lot" he sat down drinking the coffee and eating the biscuits.
He could finally see Severus he was a mess, his desk was a mess it was never like that, he liked order and everything in its place, it was one reason he was so annoyed if someone messed up in class, it meant a mess he had to clean, plus it was his favourite subject, his master's degree...
Severus had told him many times that he shouldn't have to cook all the time, only sometimes if not at all, it was his job as a father to look after his son, which truth be told they both smiled at that.
"You young man will come to my office after lunch where I can find out who you are" and with that said he headed back to the staff table.
"As you know Minster, Harry Potter has been adopted by me over the summer of last and then yesterday he was finally blood adopted but as you can see from that there was many blocks and potions within his system.
"I think we would just stick with the cotton type of robes but they need to be completely stain proof as his diet is nothing but blood mainly.
Once he was done everyone looked at him, shocked how could something like that happen to Harry and then his own friends turn against him due to him being saved by him!
"Bancroft Kenelm Harrington" and he too sat down, he so didn't want to be there as his client had threatened him and his family that if he didn't help he would loose his family, his twins!
"I can't believe how nice it is to go to class and get our work done without being out questioned by Granger of all things" said Pansy.
The two left and headed back home, thank Merlin for magic and once they landed Harry just burst out into tears!
This made Draco blush, noticing the time he suggested that they would get something to eat for lunch, both thanking that they had more money on them than needed.
"..so you see he isn't good, Dumbledore is better at governing the school unlike that imposter that calls himself the Headmaster now" she said making everyone sigh this had been going on now for three hours and she was just not shutting up about it.
Albus threw himself at Lucius in angry and tried to assault him with all his might but being much younger than the old man Lucius moved out of the way making Albus fall helplessly on to the floor.
"...that?" the twins asked only to have Harry come up to them with Severus and Draco behind them, after the whole panic attack was over, he was still shaking but otherwise fine if he had is father with him.
"Hadrian it will be fine and I don't think Snape will mind at all after all he is your father right" said Blaise to him taking a bite of his beef afterwards.
"Harry Potter is sitting right there! Next to the bat!" shouted Ginny making everyone look at her, she was what twelve what was a student doing here?
Fred and George came into the hall sporting bright green Slytherin hair and Fred had green rabbit ears while George had green cat ears.
Harry had been in his room for the passed three hours his tears now had completely dried up, he was still clutching his stuffed animals but as his magic had calmed down some what, he noticed something moving... it was them.
He is always seen with Harry and will do anything for him, he has made great friends with Draco and Blaise. He sees Severus as his father and Remus as his uncle who he calls Wolfie *laugh*
The group met the other two from their group and headed into Honeydukes and right away Otiz was picking up a load of blood lollies making the group sigh at what he was doing.
"You know his parents are dead Professor you know that right, he saved the Wizarding world when he was a baby and then treated well by the way of his family and then came here" said Yasmin to him only to shrink back when he looked at her.
She took him by the hand and brought him to a quiet classroom where they worked on his school work as well as some breathing exercises and talked about how he had been feeling as well ect..
He glared at his boyfriend who wasn't happy that he wasn't getting up but he then walked out of the room with a comment of 'jerk' and then slamming of his bedroom door.
Harry was pressed up against Severus for dear life, he didn't want to be there at all but he knew that this is what his father wanted and that nothing would harm him while he was there to protect him.
"Hadrian is it ok to get some memories from your time with the Dursley's?" asked Lucius as he had gone over to wake the poor boy up.
"Dragon please try not to pick on the poor boy, you both have history together and I have to admit some bad history but I want you to help him the best that you can do, I do hear that he loves to play Quidditch as a part of the Gryffindor team" finished his father but said no more as the Floo went.
"Young Heir Prince if I could ask you to discard your robes in that room over there and change into the robes waiting there, once done come out and then follow me up to the table" said Griphook only to have Harry nod to him and headed off to the little room.
The room goes quiet and Harry swears he sees kindness in Malfoy’s eyes from his hiding spot. It must be his cloak playing tricks on him.
So had Millie and Theo, and to be fair Pansy would have laughed too, so at least he had Fleur’s sympathetic smile to hold him until he managed to make it back to his room. And because Blaise is also weirdly sweet sometimes, he lit Draco’s favorite candle before going to bed so the room smelt like green apples and cinnamon.
It hurts, similar to the Cruciatus, but after everything Draco’s been through, he merely flinches. Something must be wrong with his nerves. Moody, technically Crouch Jr., mentioned something in fourth year about repeated exposure damaging nerve endings. Too bad Draco’s school notes were confiscated as ‘evidence’ and still haven’t returned.
Green eyes stare into his, searching, looking for something. Draco merely hardens his scowl which scares the other boy into looking away. Blaise whistles.
“Tomorrow, love, I’m stealing you away all to myself. Your father’s had you all summer, I think it’s high time we get to be together!”
Draco snorts, bringing him close for a kiss on the nose. He leaves Harry to shower, but doesn't go far. No, he sits outside on Harry’s bed with LuLu until Harry reemerges in a big sweater and shorts that
Draco was most definitely going insane. No other way to put it. He was so used to lying a little bit about everything that he suddenly seemed to take hours to answer any question Pansy and Blaise asked him, which pissed them off because they knew it was vague when they heard it. His father had sent him a letter about Buckbeak more than likely dying soon, which he was trying to research into so he could at least
“Harry? I can write, you know. For Godric’s sake I’m not going to make you fill out a legal change of address.”
Snape leaves out the ‘no one got taken when Dumbledore was here’ unspoken, but Draco sure as hell thinks it. Fawkes is waiting for them, pacing around the floor and squeaking as soon as the two enter the room. He flies into the sorting hat, trying to get it, much to the hat’s dismay.
“He’s fine, darlings. Recovering like death was never even an option in the first place, cocky bastard.”
Then Draco feels a different guilt, one for probably sticking Harry Potter in a very unpleasant spot, one he was understanding more and more as the days drug on. Constantly reminding himself that he's only doing this to save Harry Potter’s life, he counts down the days until he can start packing for Hogwarts. It's more of a home than the Manor is lately.
Surely not in a flying car. Surely he's more sensible than that. Even so they rush out and press against the nearest window to see a flash of black and orange in the front seat of a
A shiver tears through Draco’s spine, his father wasn’t supposed to be here. He needs the Snitch and he needs it now.
Theo’s never had a parental figure. Not really. His mum died when he was five, and his dad never cared about him. Not until he tried to force Theo to take the Mark and Draco stood in his way. Theo’s never had someone to look out for him until Draco got nosey and demanded the boy tell him why, exactly, he was all bandaged up at the beginning of fourth year. Draco was probably the first person to care about Theo, the first to offer him friends and freedom and something to live for.
“You’re really quite stunning up close,” he whispers, “although for a moment you really did scare me. You would never hurt Potter though, would you? I agree that he’s tempting to hex but Merlin having him hurt is a headache for everyone.”
Harry laughs, Hermione shakes her head and then Sirius clears his throat. He doesn’t have to say anything for Draco to pull the muggle-born away and engage her in conversation so they wouldn’t have a chance to eavesdrop.
“Show yourself.” He keeps his voice level and calm, if there is an attacker, he’s right by two classrooms. Should something bad happen, he could bunker down in one of those and get help. “I know someone’s there. Stop hiding like a coward and face me.”
Draco scoffs, “Hagrid? That giant oaf has some creatures, sure, but he isn’t a murderer! The man can hardly keep himself from crying when pudding spills!” He keeps comments of the man’s intelligence to himself, no need to anger an already sad man.
Harry would continue to argue with them, but he would like to know this sooner than later, so he turns Draco, who’s still a little speechless, so he can kiss him again. Softer, and much more caring than before, Draco’s blinks happily until he realizes that Harry is running towards the main house.
Ah, that sentence had definitely been a mistake. At least this time he can see his father moving quickly across the room and pinning him into the wall. Potter gasps beside him, Dumbledore frowns.
“Did it ever occur to you that perhaps Potter would love to know this information?” Draco can’t explain where the anger comes from, but it fuels some weird righteousness inside him. He’d seen, up close and personal, how everything that
Merlin couldn’t save him from throttling the moron in his sleep tonight. See if he doesn’t sneak into the Gryffindor dorm rooms tonight and beat Potter with his own pillow. Watch him physically tie the imbecile down and-his mouth is running without his brain again.
Hi! Sorry this was a day late, I GOT  CAT!!!!! I am, probably overly, excited and I named her KiKi and I adore her with everything in my even though she's being difficult with her litter box and shat on my bed.
Draco wants to beg to differ, wants to rant and rage and let Kingsley have a piece of his fucking mind, but he says nothing.
also, completely off topic but i'm trying to move out of an unsafe home environment, so if any of you all know a way to make easy money let me fucking know.
This time Draco does roll his eyes. Less at his father, and more because he feels someone hiding and watching. Probably waiting for one of them to slip. For Lucius to snap or for Draco to give up his little act. He huffs, crossing his arms. Whatever asshole is trying to ruin his reputation will have to wait until another day. He has the look of a selfish bastard to uphold, thank you very much.
No inter-house cup? No Quidditch? So that the six and seventh years can compete in a death competition?”
Harry squirms in Hermione’s hold, which only makes the witch angrier, and quickly rushes out the story.
He knows that to Cedric it must sound like Draco’s bragging, but Harry knows it’s code for ‘I’m safe’ so he sends his own code back.
He doesn’t say a word when Draco collapses from relief, from the sweet release of the wards leaving him, that feeling of dirt on his soul is nothing in comparison to the fear of breaking his probation.
He watches them, sees deep crimson form lines and curves, and for a moment he thinks about how much funnier it would be for him
Draco has a vivid flashback of writing that down on paper and running off with Snape this time last year. A smile graces his lips, and since Harry’s already kept one promise, what’s the harm in another? “You two go.
“Look at you,” Blaise whispers, “You’re shaking like you’ve just woken up from a nightmare...we can’t sit by and watch anymore. We’re your friends and we won’t let you lie to us.”
happy given that Skeeter was now bluntly calling Cedric a piece of trash, Krum a Dark Lord, Fleur a fucking monsterus slut, and Harry the only thing worse than the Dark Arts themselves. He still wants to burn her eyebrows off for those last two statements, but Pansy had told him that he couldn’t go to jail until
Dumbledore doesn’t comment on his rudeness for once, merely waits for both boys to join him. Then he takes his wand and extracts the memories Draco has no recollection of and eases them into the water. The three of them join hands, take a gulp of air, and sink their heads into the unknown.
Blaise makes a snide comment in response that Draco ignores so he can slam his book down and glare at Potter.
for Draco to figure out the subtle differences. There’s a slight tremor in his left hand, but his right one is still. His shoulders tenses roughly a centimeter, and he won’t look anyone in the eye. Instead he stares either at the nose or the side of someone’s face, but never directly in the eyes. Draco’s thankful for it, he doesn’t know what he would do if he saw fear in Blaise’s expression and he never wants to find out.
The second Flint is gone he all but jumps out of bed. He hasn’t been this excited since his first train ride, last year, before all this mess. He gets to play. He gets something he’s dreamed about since he was a kid, a real life dream come true. And if he wasn’t good, he would train, every day, for as long as he could, anything to keep the sudden rush of
Howie starts taking him to the decorations, and Draco puts his foot down because he can’t decorate a space that hasn’t even been created yet, to which Howie nods and tips him off that the muggle stores are cheaper and a lot better when it comes to décor. He adds two books called
He spends the rest of Tuesday doing homework with Fleur popping in and out every now and then. Pansy’s somehow found time to start on her end of the year art portfolio, which means he’s had to listen to her worry about getting paint on her dress robe projects for one day and he’s already fed up with it. He kinda regrets getting her new paint supplies for her birthday.
“We’re not.”  Draco sets his coffee, and his copy of Emily Dickinson’s poetry, down, turning to face his friend. “And that’s something we need to talk about.”
Weasley shrinks away from her but Snape looks mildly impressed. Lupin runs a hand through his hair. “Right...well, it’s vital information to the story. My….issue...almost kept me from coming to Hogwarts. I was bitten as a boy and everyone knows how dangerous wolves can be. When you transform...you don’t have control, you wouldn’t be able to tell your best friend from your meal, so I was denied school for the longest time until Dumbledore became headmaster. He built this place for me, a little home to hide out my transformations in.”
Lucius moves in front of them, they follow him and Memory Draco down the hallways of Malfoy Manor and to the dungeons, where Draco shivers. Dumbledore tightens his grip on his hand, it’s grounding, he would have to thank the man for not making him do this alone later.
The story goes that Carla showed up at June’s shop during one of Draco’s teaching sessions, slammed a piece of parchment in front of his face, and then confiscated his wand until it was filled out. She didn’t tell him what it was for, what she was going to do with it, but all of it was about the art of potion making, how long he’s been brewing, and small, obvious details about him. In all honesty, he thought nothing of it. Thought it was some sort of weird qualification to give to the people who are still a little skeptical of him.
hey guys! just a heads up the next chapter might not be posted on our usual sun/wed schedule becuase i'm going to be out of town. i'll hopefully still be writing so we can get back on track but just a warning! love you all, stay safe, and i'll see you in the next chapter!
Arguably, training on his day off while he’s pissed to the point of lacking emotional control doesn’t logically seem like a good idea. But his friends are enjoying it. Theo even came down to watch the show, wedged in between Pansy and Blaise just in case he got
They quietly look at each other, as if daring the other to say something. After a few minutes Dumbledore gives, “We should make our way to the Great Hall. The victims will be joining us tonight, we’ll finally have the school back in one piece.”
Draco stays perched on the back porch, watching the water and only moving when someone- probably Sisily- forces him to sit down. A blanket is thrown over his shoulders. An elf starts a fire nearby. Draco ignores them. LuLu stays by his side, on a little chair of her own. Sometimes he feels her weight on his lap, but eventually he can ignore that too.
At times it can be overwhelming, all those people all at once, all laughing and joking with him can make him feel too full. It gets painful sometimes, and the giant sleepover at Malfoy Manor where he saw all the people he cared about in one day….
“Seriously, Draco, the money is one thing, but the face Harry Potter will make when we win the match will be so much better. Let’s get in the sky boys!”
“Then go get one! Grishom’s is just as good as Olivander’s! There is nothing stopping you but your damn self!”
full on sobbing into his chest, and he’s only seen her cry while reading bad romance books. He gently rubs a hand down her back.
Draco shakes his head, “Isn’t that a bit much even for him? I think heavy influence is the most likely, after all he would need a solid form to possess someone, right? I’ve heard it’s almost impossible to refuse him once he’s in front of you.”
Once she’s made sure all children are accounted for, she pulls them all towards her. “Listen to me. All of you need to go home immediately, lock your doors, and do not open them until it’s time for you to return to Hogwarts, do you understand?”
to leave his side, and Blaise is glaring back with a large t-shirt in his hands. Draco appears to be shirtless.
Maybe Hufflepuffs aren’t bad afterall...Draco watches him walk away before realizing he’s acting like a first year with a crush, turning on his heel and marching to the lunch room so Pansy and Blaise can give him shit for missing Transfiguration. Again.
“So there I was, the only Slytherin in our year at breakfast,” Pansy makes a point of glaring. Draco’s too out of it to notice, Blaise just doesn’t care. “And who came to rid me of my lonesome? Why Fleur, off course. And apparently, she’s finally gotten a date, and I asked if she knew what she wanted her dress to look like yet, and she said ‘no’, so I threw around a couple of suggestions, and
doesn't want his ice cream to melt. Then he moves onto stocking the coffee and tea cabinet, putting out paper towels, the knife set he bought that he sharpens with a few cutting spells; shoving wooden cutting boards, his new copper kettle, various cooking necessities that were shoved on him from a sales assistant, and lastly the bakeware into their respective cabinets.
“Does he just not sleep?” Draco eventually snaps. In truth he’s just a little cranky because it’s a little rude to sleep when you’re supposed to be helping.
Things were looking up Wednesday after dinner when the Six Morons, as Pansy likes to call them, met up in the Gang’s Room for some studying and light reading. Well, he and Hermione called it ‘light reading’. Winky called it ‘an excuse to stay up late’, Blaise called it ‘an unhealthy coping mechanism’, and Ron called it ‘disgusting, but in an intellectual way’.
Harry screams. Ron’s face matches his hair but it’s nothing compared to Hermione’s. The three of them glare at the others, but the three redheads are too busy laughing so hard they almost puke.
Pansy turns to her, bowing slightly and smiling all the same. “Thank you, Mrs. Malfoy, we’ve been missing him.”
And a ‘bit of fun’ is exactly what they spent their last day together doing. Pansy makes sure to force them into a longer breakfast, complete with lemon tarts and mint tea, promptly dragging them back to the dungeons for a games before it got too crowded. She left the two boys with the rest of their friends so she could spend time with her other friends, the rest of the Slytherin girls in their year. A wink and a few laughs later and they were making their way to the pitch, using snowballs as Bludgers and seeing who could stand the cold the longest; Draco won every round. By night Crabbe and Goyle were each to speak to their parents before staying, leaving Blaise and Draco alone in the dorm, piled under blankets and watching a book they had spelled to come to life. A story from a famous wizard writer- with real integrity unlike one of their professors- about a vampire and his noble deeds to save the world despite those who thought he was evil.
He is eventually saved from her antics by one of the Beauxbatons Boys, who are probably the prettiest men Draco’s ever seen. Thank Merlin he has class to distract him from all the other shit. And it’s Ancient Runes with his best friends and Hermione. He must be doing something right because Pansy only complains twice, which is a fucking miracle.
“It’s not my fault.” he hisses, but he can’t very well tell his father the truth about why his grades had slipped the previous year, so he settles for a quick jab at someone who
“Well, I wasn’t always the nice person you know me to be. Life changes people, Draco, and when I first came to Hogwarts, I’m afraid I was a bit of a bully, my whole group of friends were, and Professor Snape seemed to take the brunt of all our jokes. We did some very mean things to him, things that can’t simply be forgotten, I actually don’t blame him for hating me as much as he does, I think it’s pretty understandable. Between the two of us, there are things I wish I could take back, perhaps if we had been kinder to Snape, something good would have come out of it. You never know what benefits a new friendship can bring.”
Harry mimics the icy look Draco had given not even ten minutes ago. “Don’t forget to thank me when you face the Dementors.”
And then Snape is near enough for Potter to close his eyes and pretend to be sleeping, Draco doesn’t miss the way he tenses up once he leaves the room. He curses himself and promises to talk to Dumbledore the second he wakes up tomorrow. Hopefully he didn’t just make an irreversible mistake, worse comes to worst, they could always Obliviate Potter...but something about that doesn’t sit right with him. LuLu cuddles extra close to him that night.
A moment of shuffling later and Draco finds himself recounting all of Harry Potter’s stories through out the years and agreeing rather aggressively with every ‘what the fuck’ that comes out of his cousin’s mouth.
Eyes linger over every scar, every cut, every bullshit thing he had endured the past few years. Draco rolls his eyes, “Did your mother take you to France after the blow up?”
"Good morning everyone, I hope this weekend was restful for us all and we're ready to get back to work. Now, I have the pleasure to announce our special Unity event this Friday."
“We’ve already started a list of potential costumes. All muggle culture obviously, we want everyone to do something different. It’ll all be group based though so no one feels uncomfortable.” Hermione showed Harry the list and he smiled at the first few he read.
“From the Addams Family. Really suave character, completely devoted to his wife.” Hermione explained and Theo looked at Daphne with love.
Draco hated the lack of spontaneity, Nolan hated the "wrong" ambition Draco showed. Pursuing a meaningless shopkeeper career was embarrassing, Nolan said, when Draco had all the talent and potential to work in the Ministry.
They left the bathroom together, and Blaise wolf whistled when they came back into the room. Malfoy flipped him off, and Blaise blew him a kiss before going to the bathroom himself.
However, Draco felt as if he were on fire. His entire body was burning and the places where Harry's hands touched him were an inferno.
“Oh dear, I could have sworn I…” she muttered to herself, flipping her parchment around to see the names.
Preparations for Halloween were well underway. Hermione had made multiple trips with Harry, Justin, Anthony, and Millicent to costume shops. They refused to let anyone who hadn't been outside the Wizarding World before to come as they wanted Halloween to be their first experience.
“How about you call it a night mate? Try and get some sleep.” Ron suggested and Hermione voiced her agreement. Obviously they could tell he hadn't slept last night. Harry had also told them about his nightmares, Hermione asking him multiple times to see a therapist, but Harry had declined. It was nothing he couldn't handle, but more importantly, he didn't want to burden anyone else with his tales of the war, so he’d keep it to himself.
McGonagall began teaching, and Harry made himself focus solely on the lesson for the rest of the class.
As McGonagall went to retrieve something for the lesson, Harry leaned closer to Malfoy and whispered, “What class do you have next?”
Mrs. Weasley's lips tightened but she agreed. “Five minutes. But I expect you to be at Madam Malkin's to get fitted for new robes right after, Ginny.”
was written neatly on a card on the first desk. Harry sat and glanced at the card next to him and...oh.
Draco stuck his tongue out at her retreating form and then walked over to his couch. He groaned silently to himself once again, knowing exactly what she meant. Pureblood weddings were a four day affair. The first night was a dinner party, celebrating the couple. The next day was an all day event where guests came together, usually in some extravagant and expensive place, to be waited upon and tended to by the staff. The third day was the rehearsal dinner and final guest arrivals. And finally the last day was the ceremony and following wedding party.
Other people chimed in, causing Ron to raise his hands in defense and bite a piece of toast to prove he wasn't talking.
Harry sighed to himself. He wouldn't be rooming with Ron his final year, but at least Ron had Neville. Harry started feeling a little worried as he got towards the end. There weren't many people left, and he had a sinking feeling he knew who his roommates were.
“Yeah, it was so weird. I never knew Malfoy had feelings.” Harry tried to joke, but Hermione didn't laugh. Ron snorted loudly but tried to cover it with a cough.
Draco tried to hide his smirk as best he could. “Not yet. He had a delivery at Madame June’s, you know how she is.”
This was my first time ever writing smut so sorry if it sounds odd or rushed! I was a little nervous posting this chapter but I think it came out alright over all.
"Well if we cock up one of you will help us, right?" Theo asked. Nods of affirmation left the group trying to teach them.
Now, a year and a half later, Draco and Harry had become working partners that got weekly drinks with their friends. Their respective friend groups. Which had molded into one big group by now. Basically, he and Harry were pretty much friends.
“She has a point.” Hermione said as she spread jam onto her toast. She lowered her voice slightly so just her friends could hear, “I mean, already it seems the Slytherins are trying to show who they truly are.”
Long after he crawled into bed that night, Harry’s mind was still racing as he thought about what had happened.
Harry scanned the rest of the directions before adding his water and turning on his burner. He adjusted the flame before going over to the ingredient table. He took the necessary supplies and then walked over to Ron’s table.
Harry squeezed back into his spot next to Draco. Due to how many people were sitting at the booth, they were sat pressed close.
In an instant Harry felt the familiar discomfort of portkey travel. His eyes watered as he felt a pull behind his nose. A moment later all twenty one Eighth Years stood in a dimly lit park. A pond was to the left of them and no people seemed to be around.
Harry thought for a moment. Three people had tried out specifically for Seeker. Two Fifth Year boys, Shamar Ownes and Noah Blanche. They had done well but had also done well when Ginny set them up as Chasers. The other was a Third Year girl, Evangeline Miller. She was a small thing, her broom almost seemed taller than her. Her wildly curly hair was pulled back in a tight bun but had managed to come loose by the end. Her skills however were intense. She flew around the Pitch with such agility yet never seemed unaware of the game below her. She had sharp eyes and managed to catch the snitch each time she was Seeker.
The four Eighth Years sat down to get comfortable for the journey. It felt like First Year all over again. For the first time in what seemed like his entire life, Harry was free of the looming threat of his death hanging over his head. But he still felt the odd rush of nerves that accompanied him all those years ago on his first trip to Hogwarts.
“No.” Draco answered, a half truth. Of course he was nervous. This could all blow up in both their faces, how would they return from that?
The same reasons, that only months prior at Malfoy’s trial, Harry had said didn't define him. That Malfoy had only been doing what any person would do when the death of their loved ones loomed overhead. Actions that even he, Harry Potter, would have taken, if their roles had been reversed.
Blaise was quite civil to Harry as well, aside from sarcastic comments thrown his way. Though to be fair, no one was safe from Blaise's cheek.
“No, you didn’t.” He said calmly. “I guess I could have timed that a bit better, but I honestly am knackered all of sudden.”
“Alright alright,” Harry said with another small laugh, “that’s what we’re doing now anyway. Yours or mine?”
Blaise looked like a kid on Christmas. “How fun will it be for you to play pretend with Potter? Do you think you’ll get to kiss him? Maybe even talk about your own dream wedding?”
Blaise fell to his knees with a yelp, eyes tightly shut in pain. Seeing as his friend was now incapacitated, Theo stepped forward.
rivalry between all the Houses, but we will also be hosting more activities to promote unity. I will explain more in the days to come. But today is a time to celebrate another Sorting Ceremony and Opening Feast.”
The killing curse hadn't hurt, Crucio had been horribly painful, but this? This felt like someone had poured molten lava onto Harry’s shoulder, and they were letting it seep down and into his chest.
He walked up the path, beckoning Harry to follow. Although it was only the start of fall, there was already a chill in the air. Inside the home followed the same aesthetic as outside.
Harry’s brain hung onto that comment for too long for him to not notice. What use was it to yell at himself each time this happened? It was becoming more and more of a problem.
And with that Draco complied. He took Harry's outstretched hand to rise from the booth and the two walked to their friends on the dancefloor.
"Well then it will have to be someone who would have to have logically agreed to a low profile relationship with you." Pansy said.
It had started off as a work relationship. Draco and Blaise opened a now quite lucrative potion shop, Clover, Cissus, and Rose, a few years after leaving Hogwarts. It had taken some time for the general public to come to trust them but slowly they came to be a well respected establishment in Diagon Alley.
“I understand House loyalty is a big part of your Hogwarts experience. I am not telling you to not think of yourselves as Ravenclaws and Gryffindors, rather I'm asking you to remember our House Unity.”
Neither of them were as affected this time, but Malfoy was staring at Harry with an unreadable expression. Harry looked down at his hands silently. After a moment Draco said, “Who's spying on who now?”
Malfoy looked up sharply when Nott was called and looked as if he was going to say something but stopped himself.
“Shove over, Granger. If we're going to become best friends, you need to learn to share.” Pansy said as she sat herself between Ron and Hermione. Their interlocked hands were almost crushed before they moved them, Hermione seeming more confused than embarrassed. Had Harry not been just as confused, he would have laughed at Ron’s soured expression. He looked at Hermione forlornly over Pansy’s petite frame before looking away. Millicent sat down beside Neville, while Daphne squeezed herself on the other side of him. The three boys remained standing.
Harry couldn't stand any longer and he collapsed onto the ground in pain. He heard Snape walk in but the pain kept him from opening his eyes.
Harry looked confused for a moment before nodding. He didn't have any time to wonder what the lesson might be because his friends decided to cause a scene. Ron was trying and failing to hold in a laugh as Hermione hit him on the arm with her own laugh trying to escape.
Harry helped her set up the final crate as the various players began to gather. He recognized a lot of them but that wasn’t surprising as the last team had been made up of people years younger than him.There were a few new faces as well which was exciting. Almost no one paid him any mind after the first few minutes of subtle nudges to friends from those he didn’t know already.
He stared at them for a moment but didn't question it. He accepted the money and waved them further into the club.
“Well you’ll be hard pressed finding better Beaters than Coote and Peakes, and Robins was as good as ever.”
He snuck a glance at Malfoy, who was staring straight ahead. Blaise leaned over the tables to whisper something in Malfoy’s ear, causing him to clench his jaw and his cheeks to redden. Blaise snickered and sat back into his chair.
Neville had just finished getting his makeup done. The messy yet unmistakable face of the Joker expertly applied by Michael. The purple suit was expertly rumpled by Pansy. His hair had been sprayed with a green dye to finish off.
“Draco, mate, you’ve really outdone yourself this time.” Blaise choked out through more laughs once the store was empty.
Harry picked up one of the samples, looking the vial over. He placed it to the side before taking out the rest of the ready to sell products. Draco stood there awkwardly watching him as he did so. The silence surrounding them now made Draco want to crawl out of his skin.
“I-what?” Harry said, stopping mid way to his seat. He stared at Draco who stared right back. Harry seemed confused now, as if he hadn’t even realized it.
They only had a little over an hour to shop, seeing as they had spent half the period getting there. They had lunch next, so they could spend a few extra minutes shopping but they all wanted to get back in time to eat. Especially Harry. Apparently eating a single roll for breakfast hadn't been his smartest idea. The candy that surrounded them was looking incredibly appetizing right now.
“I know this sounds crazy. I mean, I wasn’t even going to ask you until I got here a minute ago so in all honesty you can actually just forget-”
“I’m sure everyone wants to keep their old desks, which is exactly why I've given everyone new ones!” Slughorn boomed, a loud chuckle following.
Once the air returned to normal they started discussing simple facts about themselves. It was odd though. They already knew a lot about each other, more than either one was expecting.
"I can't just show up with some random bloke off the street. It has to at least seem like I'm in a relationship." Draco said to Pansy.
he still fancied him. But he didn’t! Of course, he wasn’t going to deny Potter was attractive, he was extremely attractive.
Kissing anyone would do that, it just made sense. No reason that Harry would automatically read into Draco blushing.
More people drew names, Susan Bones got Bubbles and Sue Li got Buttercup, while Hannah Abbott joined Seamus by drawing Tinkerbell.
Harry leant down and grabbed his own pyjamas and stripped out of his clothes. Blaise let out a low whistle and Harry’s face burned with embarrassment.
The three boys all said their goodnights and crawled into bed. Harry listened to the sounds of his roommates breathing as he tried to fall asleep. For some reason unknown to Harry, and a part of him wasn’t sure he wanted to know, his mind kept drifting back to the idea of Draco doing a strip tease.
Malfoy looked shocked for a split second before replacing it with a scowl. “Not everyone would want to follow you around and spy on you, Potter. And for you to think that I would ever waste my time-”
“Nothing is as good as Mum’s food,” Ron said, face stuffed with potatoes and chicken,”but this comes damn close.”
“You're kidding right?” Millicent said, rolling her eyes. “We know you know all these secret passages to get around the school. And we know you have the Cloak.”
Harry didn't have time to think of why, as he was mentally guessing who he'd spend the next year paired with. Obviously not Ron, he thought glumly. Either Padma, Dean, or maybe Pansy. The thought made him scrunch up his nose. Hopefully it wouldn't be her.
Refusing to think anymore -except of Nott and Malfoy -Harry took his dick back in his grasp and finished what he had already begun.
They were still pressed against each other from a moment ago. Draco shifted his hand from Harry's shoulder to his neck, letting his thumb curl up to cup his jaw.
“Harry’s got a year on Malfoy, but that’s neither here nor there.” Ron said from beside him with a grin.
Harry weighed the pros and cons of telling them before quickly saying, “Nope!” and entering the Great Hall.
The trio walked into the Great Hall, stopping to say hello to Ginny and Luna who were sitting at the Ravenclaw table together.
"It was more like we were both curious and horny so why not? It was mostly Fourth Year and the beginning of Fifth but nothing serious."
Harry looked down at his own photo. It seemed simple enough. A short white toga with a golden headband around the forehead. Sandals that wrapped around his calves and a golden belt around his waist.
Harry nodded and placed his hand on Draco’s now extended arm. Draco looked at him for a moment until he nodded again. The heavy pull of apparating entered his body.
More applause rang out and someone who sounded suspiciously like Seamus yelled gleefully, “Bring out the fucking pudding!”
Blaise looked at Draco for confirmation, who nodded in response. “I’m ready. Fucking starving. See you in an hour, mate.” Blaise called out.
Harry nodded. Draco led them out of the club, a hand gently guiding Harry by the small of his back. They stood in front of the entrance adjusting to the quiet outside.
Despite having been in bed for over an hour and feeling so tired, Harry was still awake. It happened nightly, but Harry had hoped it would stop once he was back in Hogwarts. Now he wasn’t sure if it was helping or hindering him.
“Well, good night boys. See you in the morning.” Blaise said once Harry came back, crawling under the covers.
Harry got on his broom and flew a few laps as Ginny divided the teams. He didn’t fly too high but he wanted to get a feel for the air before they began. He landed once Ginny began laying out the ground rules for tryouts and waited for her to officially start.
It took a few moments for the Hall to fill up with noise again as everyone processed what she had said.
Harry thought for a moment before saying, “Well I figure I would have made the first move. Unless…?”
Ron leaned over and whispered, “Who knew? McGonagall has jokes.” which led to more laughter from his side of the table.
Harry realized suddenly that people were beginning to leave the Great Hall. Had he been thinking of Malfoy the entire time? Before he could pay that thought any more mind, he registered what Hermione had asked.
“First years, I welcome you wholeheartedly to our family. This year, you will be the first generation of Hogwarts students to start our Inter House Unity project.”
“It’s been a while since I’ve played against you you know.” Malfoy said as they sailed above the match.
“Shut it.” Harry mumbled. He shoved them both in the direction of an empty table and then made his way over to Malfoy.
He wrapped a hand around himself without thinking and pumped once, twice, three times, then stopped. What was he doing? Was he really about to jerk off to this?
“Regardless, please sit at the table next to Mr. Zabini. It's not exactly alphabetical, but it'll do.”
Malfoy must have thought they were both already asleep. He would never let someone see him this vulnerable, let alone
Harry stood a little ways away as Draco waited for the bartender. A man quite a bit taller than Draco walked up next to him. He was wearing an unbuttoned red flannel shirt, a white sleeveless shirt, blue jeans, and work boots. He had dark brown hair that was styled to one side and a thick beard. Harry assumed he was supposed to be some sort of lumberjack.
Harry finished showering and wrapped the towel around his waist before stepping out. Of course, Malfoy was standing there, fixing his hair in the mirror. He glanced at Harry through the mirror but looked away quickly. Harry was suddenly very aware of how naked he was. The only other sink was right next to Malfoy though, so Harry went over and began brushing his teeth. He wished he would have done it in the shower, but he hadn't thought of it then.
Blaise had this excited energy about him again, and he said, “You know, all our games of truth or dare,
And, as always, let me know what you thought of this chapter! Little fun fact about this fic, the next chapter wasn't even going to be in it I was going to end it here. But I couldn't possibly stop writing when they just got together! So the last chapter is like a little bonus for you guys <3
"What if I drop it and it blows away in the wind?" Draco asked with a huff. Harry laughed out loud at that, which made Draco bite down his own grin.
Harry recalled Dudley watching that once before Vernon quickly turned it off exclaiming “that's not for boys!”.
As the anniversary grew closer, some nights when Harry layed in bed he thought about going into the Forbidden Forest. He thought about finding the resurrection stone and bringing his parents back, just for a moment, to see them again. To hear their voices.
A deal was made that benefited both shops. Draco and Blaise would make these potions and balms by demand and Luna would pay and advertise Clover in her own store.
But that was inconsequential. Draco could say he was attractive the same way he could say Blaise was attractive.
Draco was impressed. That sounded logical, though they would have to be much more detailed than that. But it was a good start.
Draco and Harry flew above them all, stopping next to one another high above them all. They turned to look at one another with excited grins.
“Potter, you do realize the potion is supposed to stay in the pot, right? If you stir it with any less caution you'll end up spilling the rest.” Malfoy muttered.
Harry had looked at each photo so many times he had them memorized. James lifting Lily up in a twirl and spinning her around. The two standing outside their house on Godric's Hollow with their hands placed gently on Lily's pregnant belly. His parents on their wedding day, standing with Sirius, Remus, and Peter. Harry had wanted to rip him out one day in Fourth Year but forced himself not too.
He heard the bathroom door open as he began shampooing his hair. His heart rate picked up just the slightest bit and he cursed under his breath.
As Malfoy drew closer, Harry started to panic. What if Malfoy thought he was doing this on purpose? Malfoy might think Harry was trying to keep him in check, and had
“Sorry for what, Potter? Showing up to class on time? Or remembering your book?” Malfoy said without looking up from his parchment.
“Alright, fine. But to everyone else, we’re incredibly attracted to each other and madly in love.” Draco added.
Draco had been here before, only twice. Unlike Draco, whose house was secluded from any neighbors, Harry lived on a fairly busy street. He still had his own yard but his neighbors were only a stone's throw away.
,” McGonagall gave a pointed look at Dean and Seamus and then to Harry and Ron before continuing, “so I have taken it upon myself to seat you alphabetically.”
“So, I was thinking what else we needed to go over. And I think we need to really think about this deeper than we realize. Like, which side of the bed do you sleep on? Whose house do we spend more time at?” Harry said as he moved around his kitchen.
Potter was always running straight to danger. All those Quidditch injuries could have easily been avoided by an actual competent Seeker. Not that you're any better on the ground.”
“Bloody hell Potter, you look like shit.” Blaise said once Harry stood up. Harry gave him a thumbs up and grabbed his toothbrush and a towel and walked over to the bathroom. When he opened the door, one of the showers was already running. Maybe if he took a long enough shower, he wouldn't see Malfoy when he got out.
“We all just wanted to stop in and say hello! We won't be long, so don't worry about entertaining Pansy, she'll be fine as soon as she gets something in her mouth.” Blaise said with a snicker, causing Pansy to punch him straight in the crotch.
As the date for their Muggle outing grew closer, Harry's apprehension grew stronger. Whenever he had the chance to be alone in his room he would take out the old scrapbook Hagrid had given him all those years ago and stare at the pictures inside. The scrapbook itself was now worn down, the corners losing their leather as it aged. The photos inside however were still in perfect condition.
“Not tonight, I’m afraid.” Harry said with a smile. He looked at Draco and then added, “We wanted a more private dinner tonight.”
Harry turned around again once the kettle began to hiss. Before Draco had a chance to explain to Harry how he liked his tea, he watched as Harry put one scoop of sugar into one of the mugs and then squeezed a slice of lemon he had cut before dropping the entire slice into the mug. The other mug all he added was a splash of milk.
Then the man reached out and grabbed at the cape aspect of Draco's costume and held it out. Draco laughed again. Harry moved against his own accord and was next to Malfoy a moment later.
Harry and his friends all looked at each other in disdain. They were hoping this wouldn't happen, at least not yet.
By the end, everyone was in stitches laughing at one another. It was a bit odd, having Malfoy joke around in front of everyone. Perhaps Gregory’s Unctuous Unction had left Malfoy feeling more open. Regardless of what it was, Harry wasn’t complaining.
“We do.” Harry said firmly. He looked at Malfoy, who was staring at him like the others, but there was something else behind it. Before Harry could try to decipher it, Luna’s voice called out,
Harry sighed and tuned out Professor Dreada. Snape had explained all of this to Harry in his sixth year, albeit less gently. He knew all of the necessary precautions, and all though he didn't exactly
Harry sat down on his bed and looked through his bag, making sure he had everything ready for class tomorrow, not wanting a repeat of today. Malfoy was sitting on his bed, across from Harry, subconsciously rubbing his left shoulder.
Finally, McGonagall allowed the teams to head to the Pitch, with the rest of the school following behind a few minutes later. Hermione gave Ron a good luck kiss before they left, prompting Seamus to give an over the top kiss to Dean, and Daphne giving a chaste one to Theo.
Draco felt a swell of pride at the compliment. He had worked hard to get this place to feel like home.
Walking down Diagon Alley was always exciting, but this time Harry felt more anxious than usual. He heard the usual whispers as he and the Weasleys walked towards the shops, but this time the whispers weren’t of disgust, but of awe.
Draco got himself ready for bed on autopilot. His mind was completely focused on what had just transpired.
Harry took a deep breath before sitting. He did the steps Snape had taught him to try and block out Malfoy but, like always, it didn't work.
Malfoy turned around to face both of them and countered, “That same night Theodore Nott gave Blaise a lap dance so erotic Blaise came in his pants.”
He looked over at Malfoy’s and swallowed roughly. The costume had the same sandals as Harry’s, though that was where the similarities stopped. Harry’s portrayed a strong, hard god, where Malfoy’s looked beautiful and elegant. The draping over the shoulders was held together by a thin gold chain, and a thin golden headband and belt. It was so...delicate. Harry couldn’t help but picture Malfoy wearing the costume right then, his sharp features contrasting with the softness of the gown. The overall airy and floaty quality of the costume juxtaposing the very essence of who Malfoy is.
Again, Draco’s lip curled up slightly. “The great Harry Potter not succeeding at something? I'm shocked.”
“Where do you think you’re going Potter? Can’t break tradition, three class running.” Blaise said as he pulled Harry to the table already occupied by Malfoy.
“Alright, it’s usually easiest if we stand in a triangle shape.” Harry explained. Draco stood in the front and Blaise and Harry in the back. Harry threw the Cloak around them. They moved at a slower pace than usual but continued on. Just as they were about to reach the exit, a figure appeared at the end of the hall.
“I have no idea.” Harry said, the other two just shrugged and they walked to the Common Room to wait for dinner.
Harry watched Draco's face scrunch into confusion. He stared at the coins and notes in his hand before turning to Harry subtly.
The uniform was white with the hems and seams sewed with the colors of each House. The not quite rainbow created a beautiful border around the entire top and bottom. “Potter” was printed on the back of the jersey in large maroon letters, a number seven stitched just below that in the same colorful thread.
As September came to a close, Harry's thoughts began to drift more and more to his parents. The anniversary of their death was less than a month away and Harry finally had the time (and freedom) to visit them.
Ginny let out a low laugh. “As if you haven’t heard. I told them if they even consider selling to Simon Winston I’m off the team. Fucking sleazebag.”
The red bounced off the yellow graciously while the green took in the blue and enhanced it. McGonagall watched the students walk in before turning around and leaving them on their own.
“I know. Let’s go.” Draco said and Harry felt his stomach tighten with the way Draco was looking at him.
Speaking of Hermione, her costume was undoubtedly sexy. Her dress hugged every curve and the dark velvet material made the costume that much more attractive. Her thick curly hair cascaded around her shoulders, the ringlets falling beautifully down her back. Theo too looked incredibly suave in his Gomez costume. His usual wavy hair had been gelled back and he was sporting a fake mustache to complete the look.
But still. That did not mean he was asking him to be his fake boyfriend. Especially not for four days straight.
Malfoy stared at him for a moment and then nodded. He glanced down Harry's hand, still wrapped tightly around his wrist. Harry dropped it quickly and Malfoy walked away just as Ginny walked over.
“Mark your calendars for this Friday night, nine pm, in this! Very! Common Room!’ Blaise yelled, and began beating his fists against his chest as the crowd continued cheering.
“Of course Potter would get a god.” Blaise said from where he stood. Harry shrugged and smiled bigger as the group laughed.
The song they listened to at Harry's was Songbird by Fleetwood Mac BUT I always listen to the Glee version for Santana and Brittany.
Despite once again wanting to fall asleep quickly, Harry couldn't. He listened to Blaise’s peaceful snores but kept an ear out for Malfoy. What was Harry supposed to do if he started crying again?
"Oi! No conspiring teams yet, Weasley! We need a fair discussion with everyone present. Including impartial non players." Terry Boot said from across the table.
Harry looked at him with confusion, “If you want people to think we’re dating, don’t you think we should make
“Well,” Malfoy said, startling Harry out of his thoughts. “At least we know we’re going to look good.”
They pulled apart for real this time, letting go of each other completely. If he wasn't red before, Draco most definitely was now. He let out a shaky breath just as Harry did the same. They locked eyes and smiled, then both began laughing softly.
Everyone at the table was caught up in the new topic and were just as loud as before. Except for Draco. He seemed to have sensed Harry withdrawing into his thoughts and was staring at him curiously.
Potter hated press, Draco knew he was single, he fancied men as well as women, and the two were actually friends. Strangely.
Draco was sure if he touched anything near him he would set it ablaze. He could feel the heat radiating off of himself and he could do nothing at this point to act natural. But then again, it's not as if Harry looked completely collected.
He had basically spent a half hour making out with Harry Potter. And Harry was the one who suggested it.
“Noted. Now does anyone have any objections to Draco and Harry being the two team captains? They’ve had the longest Quidditch run out of all of us here.”
The way Ron’s eyes widened and his mouth flew open would have been almost comical, if Harry didn't have the same exact reaction.
Further down the table sat Millicent Bulstrode, Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson, Theodore Nott, Daphne Greengrass, and Draco Malfoy.
Harry wanted to ask what his type was- to keep the conversation going- but the words would not come out. Instead he just nodded in response and took a big sip of his drink.
at the odd fashion they were displaying. Hermione had tried on a dress so colorful, so frilly, and so large it had left the three of them doubled over in laughter.
Without warning, Harry was thrown backwards, and he felt himself being transported back to the classroom. He couldn't hear anything over the loud drumming in his ears and his ragged breaths. He cautiously opened his eyes and saw Malfoy sitting slouched in the chair, sweating, but otherwise handling it much better than Harry.
Excited murmurs, even from people Harry knew were never good at Transfigurations, rang through the class.
He had a point. If they kissed in front of someone and it looked awkward, their whole lie would unravel.
They were in a bathroom, and a sinking feeling in Harry’s stomach told him he knew what was about to happen. And Harry hoped on everything he had that he was wrong.
"Never got that far. Neither of us wanted to. Like I said it was more of a way to get off. Strictly handies and blowjobs. He's a good looking bloke but not really my type."
“Alright, great work today everybody. The final team list will be up by Monday, thanks again for coming today.” Ginny said and everyone gave their own goodbyes and thank yous.
Harry heard Ginny’s scream of anguish for the second time, but he felt Malfoy’s despair for the first.
The rest of the train ride had no interruptions, and it was one of the most fun times Harry had had on the Hogwarts Express. But through it all Harry couldn't shake the look on Malfoy’s face from his mind.
Harry’s next class was Herbology, and based on track record, Harry assumed Malfoy wouldn’t be joining them. Besides, he knew Hermione had Ancient Ruins this class and Malfoy had taken it since Third Year.
"Signing up for the costume contest?" asked the man sitting at the table. He was wearing green face paint and bolts glued to his neck. Harry recognized him as Frankenstein's monster, though he wondered what Draco thought he was.
"Muggles generally use wallets to hold the paper money and put the rest straight in their pocket or purse." Justin explained. This seemed to cause more confusion.
Parvarti went next, drawing Leia. “Don’t worry, I won’t steal your girl.” she said to Padma with a wink.
The rest of the week went by both fast and slow. The two teams had practices whenever they could fit it in-which was really only two times- with short drills in the Common Room every night. By Thursday night, they were teeming with anticipation.
“She is well aware. It’s not like they were even together at the point. But anyway, this is not what this conversation is about Potter. Can we get back on track?”
different. His school boy crush didn’t matter, he was over it and this whole thing was solely to help him not appear so embarrassingly single. It was fine.
Once they sat down Harry unpacked the food he had been carrying. He placed a container in front of Draco. With a wave of his hand, the containers all opened.
Harry eagerly got dressed and checked himself out in the mirror. The uniform was perfectly fitted to his body. Not too tight but not too big either. As he was looking at his reflection, Blaise walked out of the bathroom and wolf-whistled.
The title of this chapter is from the song Animal by Troye Sivan! I desperately wanted to use a line from this song for the title of the entire fic but they didn't fit the vibe . But it is the perfect title for our epilogue here!
“You lot are sitting up there now.” she said and motioned to a new table placed in front of the Professors table. Sitting there already were the other Eighth Years, all chatting together happily.
They were staring firmly at their plates. They were all tense, obviously unsure of what to do. The only one not staring at their plate was Draco.
Harry didn't answer and instead grabbed his toothbrush to go wash up. He stopped short, however, when Blaise called out, “So
Harry just continued to laugh beside him as he scanned the club for a table. It was filling up with people now but luckily he spotted a large corner booth that was vacant. He signaled to his friends on line where they were going and then he and Malfoy made their way over.
She began reading from her list, Hannah and Susan Bones sitting first, followed by Terry and Millicent. Michael sat next to Justin happily, and Seamus gave a dramatic hug to Dean before sitting next to Anthony, making even McGonagall crack a smile.
Draco kept grinning."I'm taking the piss, Harry. He was chatting me up yeah and I'm assuming he was headed there but he hadn't outright said it."
Theo and Millicent were both already working on homework with Michael and Anthony across the room in one of the large couches.
At the counter, Harry was placing an odd looking orb made of glass into a box for an older man in front of him.
“I think I’m just going to take a quick shower before bed, it’s already late.” Harry said as he stood up.
Much to his further surprise, Harry did not seem more flustered. He actually laughed a little. “Yes, Malfoy. That’s the reason we’re even having this conversation.”
Harry just kept running, his hand slipping from Malfoy’s wrist and into his hand. The pair ran through the mostly empty halls and finally reached the Charms classroom.
Madame Hooch was waiting for them in the center of the Pitch. Malfoy and Harry walked towards her, their teams lining up behind them.
Their end of the table all looked down to the Slytherin side, and Harry was surprised to see them all looking already. He locked eyes with Malfoy right away and smiled, Malfoy looking down quickly. Harry stayed staring however as Blaise whispered something to Malfoy causing him to turn pink. Blaise shared whatever he said to Pansy who’s face lit up before the two of them turned to find Harry already looking.
They had just gotten back from dinner and were sitting in a corner of the Common Room, away from the others.
Harry wasn’t sure what had just happened, but he did know he was even more clueless about what that meant for Friday’s party.
He and his team made their way to the right locker room while Malfoy and his went to the left. Here they gathered the rest of their equipment, helmets, brooms for those who need them, and mallets for the beaters. They went over their game plan once more as the noise of the crowd began to grow. Soon it was time for them to get out onto the Pitch.
Blaise frowned and looked at Draco. The two seemed to have an entire conversation through a rapid exchange of looks, because Blaise stood up and sighed.
Of course they knew the obvious things. Parents names, where they grew up, birthdays, previous relationships. Things got a little more specific, but still not terribly unusual to know: favorite class at Hogwarts, favorite type of music, preferred drink at a bar, how they take their tea. Then things got weird. Harry knew Draco always wore long sleeves when he was working the front of the shop so he could hide his dark mark, just as Draco knew Harry walked around Muggle London to feel normal. Draco knew Harry was having a bad day if he left the Kettle before closing, much like Harry knew Draco was upset if he kept quiet on their nights out. They both knew the other avoided large open flames, and they both knew why.
As a matter of fact, he’s been purposefully lying in his letters to his mother, he hadn’t written one to his father since the beginning of last year. Draco glares before he can stop himself. “Have you
rises, where do you think he and his Death Eaters will come? Just like last time they’ll want to be at the Manor and I cannot allow that to happen. I’ve already found the protective and repellent wards we can use, but I’ll need a minimum of ten hours to do it by myself, five if I have help from you two. I also can’t do it with Lucius in the house because he’ll know what I’m up to and try to stop me, but if Draco takes him to the World Cup, I can work freely. Plus, you act like I don’t put my son over everything. Do you know how many witnesses are there? How much security? Lucius has seats reserved in the Minister’s box for every home game, they’ll be sitting next to dozens of Aurors on top of security guards and powerful wizards, I assure you I wouldn’t propose this if I hadn’t thought it through. I’ve already had a portkey made, enchanted Draco’s robes for protection, and broached the topic with Lucius.”
The entire back wall is gone, potions ingredients have spoiled and spilled all over the floor, broken bottles that liter shelves with dried substances. The only intact thing seems to be the collection of cauldrons that reminds Draco too much of Severus for him to handle.
Care for Magical Creatures was being taught by that awful giant Hagrid this year and why Draco agreed to take the class he still didn’t know, something about it being required. Idly he wonders if he can get Snape to get him out of it, after all, no one seemed to be able to open their book.
Draco has other opinions. “Hermione is right. You need to be more cafe, Harry, we can’t have you dying on us.”
Two faces come into view. One dark and flawless, hair short yet still curling, eyes narrowed, lips in a thin frown. Draco doesn’t care for the frown on the boy, it makes him feel
A full moon? Soon? So soon to Lupin being sick? And hadn’t he looked ghastly on the train, right after a full moon? What was….  Draco hangs behind after class, watching Weasley get detention only a plus for the question he’s about to ask. As soon as the door is shut and it’s just him and Snape, he speaks.
for something that was against her will. I just...I can’t leave her. It’s not fair for me to be saved and not at least try to help her.”
“I’ve read that Kneazles are one of the most loyal creatures to exist, some say they can peer into other’s souls and judge if they’ll be good for their master.”
No one in a million years would ever peg a Malfoy to be friends with a Weasley, much less casually appear in public holding Harry Potter’s hand. But he’s sure stranger things have happened and it’s no excuse for the blatant stares they’re getting.
He’s a pureblood, all purebloods have their ancestors memorized by the age of ten. He knows the Malfoy line started an extremely long time ago, he knows that a Roman famous person is involved at some point, and recently he knows that his father and his grandfather had trouble connecting to the family magic.
Draco tunes back in to Pansy explaining his relatives in other countries and sits up so fast he almost smacks Blaise in the face. “Fleur!”
“Pansy!” Harry opens his eyes to see Pansy clinging to her mother’s frame. There’s a shield around the two of them, made of webbing that would send Ron running from the hills. Katheriene glares at him viciously enough to rival Draco. “What the hell did you do to my daughter?!”
Maybe the bruises he still has from Azkaban? The whip marks that coil around his back and onto his sides?
“I’m sorry,” Draco slurs, “You’ve caught me at a rather bad time, what were we talking about again?”
“My father did it. Mother got us matching ebony knives, only his is bigger and scarier looking, mine is merely for show. One day during our torture sessions he decided curses weren’t enough so he cut me while I was under the Cruciatus.”
“You know I’m getting told that more and more these days. I think it’s the scar, it’s gotta be the scar, right?”
Life has stupid things, like tea time with Snape. Apologizes to Dumbledore. Even more spectacular things like cosying up with his friends, and the promise of seeing his mother.
And that feeling fills him up. Makes him powerful, makes him dangerous. It leaves him burning brighter than Draco’s fire, more dangerous than Sirius in the dark, and certainly more capable than Tom Riddle.
Draco sits down mostly grateful for Pansy and Blaise’s support, and yet some part of him still feels ashamed. He ignores it in favor of explaining Dementors to his friends, trying his best to make it sound like it wasn’t all that bad.
She shrugs, “Anyone with eyes can see that, plus Luna and I are friends, that girl notices everything. Like
Despite the annoyance still clouding his every atom, Draco can’t fight the smile at seeing Snap’s face. Equally irritated, equally dead inside, and Draco’s favorite person in the entire school, perhaps even the world. Snape greets him with an inclined head, an eyebrow raising at being approached before he'd had a chance to have dinner.
way, I’d merely like to extend my hand to the elf in question.” He completely ignores the outraged look on Crouch’s face, at least that one looks a little more natural.
“I have to actually work today.” Theo says, disrupting his quiet time and plopping on the short side of the L-shaped couch. “You should come with me.”
During the night it seems black, but it’s really a dark navy. Giant fish jump out and try to reach the moon. It’s full….he wonders if Lupin is doing okay. The sea winks at him like some type of dark abyss. He doesn’t notice the chill until another blanket is added.
Luckily his brain had stepped up and threw the letter under his pillow before he sent the rest of them off.
Draco flinches at the tone, harsh and cold, just like- a hand caresses his cheek and pulls him away from his nightmares.
Lunch called them down to the Great Hall as they all forgot about breakfast, but the sound of running water made them stop.
Harry has never been more thankful that he and Draco haven’t had sex. It's bad enough that pictures of him and Draco kissing are smeared across the day's papers. But at least those are just
To the left of the foyer is a hallway and the door arch to the kitchen that they’re probably going to have to completely redo, Misty says she’d rather just vanish everything but the one cabinet they’re using, so Draco adds it to the list of things he’ll probably be dragged into. Past the kitchen is a broken down office and a sunroom filled with dead plants and a broken window that’s left glass all over the floor. Misty looks extremely sad in this room, so Draco summons the two plants he got today, vanishes the old ones, waits for the purple smoke to clear, sets the wood and places the plants down.
And then Weasley strikes. “Your bloody arm isn’t even injured is it? I bet you're just milking it to get Hagrid in trouble.”
There’s at least fifty Monsteras in the window alone, and Misty told him during his first week that it was her favorite.
some of y'all are about to want to hit me so i'll explain after the chapter, but trust me, if you look back you'll see it coming
To both his shock and horror, Mrs. Wealsey is looking at him with her hand over his mouth, tears streaming down her cheeks. She gathers Harry into her arms, nearly crushing him, all the while her children are giggling. He feels her look over his head at the twins.
Severus had complained about them being distracting in class, partly because he had trouble looking not laughing at them, but he hadn’t taken any of them yet. Even the other schools were wanting one, Fleur in particular.
Things like destroying Aunt Bella, and taking her away from Narcissa. Him hurting Narcissa is enough to get him on Draco’s list, but then he’d cursed Lucius, like the torture wasn’t bad enough for his dad the frist time around. He killed Harry’s parents, he was the reason Hermione was bullied first year. He got Sirius stuck in Azkaban for nearly twelve years, he hadn’t just come after the wizarding world. He’s the reason Harry’s life is constantly in danger.
The two glare at each other and then Draco sighs. “In Greek Mythology...Basilisks are more like Dragons than Snakes…”
“Like…” Fuck, how did he word this? “Like my mother. Her and I laughing and dancing on Christmas mornings. Or my friends, Pansy and Blaise, and the small moments we share that just
had to go through an interrogation with his friends, Draco gives his nastiest smirk. He’s opening up his mouth to retaliate when Potter beats him to it.
It was decided that the Weasleys, all of them, were staying for the entirety of break. Charlie and Bill didn’t feel comfortable leaving their father, much less their siblings and mother, alone. Molly hasn’t stopped fretting over Arthur, and while he’s looking much better, he still isn’t in top shape.
“Your father,” she begins in an angry voice that has Draco’s eyes widening, “could stand to be a little less of a blithering bastard sometimes. Now take your pet and go pack, we’ll have to leave early to avoid the Dementors.”
a part of your store. It’s not dabbling in your stocks, it’s having a direct hand in how things are run.”
Stifling his laughter behind clearing his throat, Draco prepares to see a face that will have him smirking in class for weeks. “I believe you’re quite right, sir. My second question is more of a personal one, you see, I was hoping you’d tell me how you felt about flying cars?”
“I never knew what he looked like, but he was my punishment. I healed too many people they wanted dead, and he was the roughest…..”
Not the worst thing, the tea, but it’s no mint. Certainly no chamomile. Even so, the three drink and make small talk until Lupin tells them both that it’s getting late and that they could probably use a good night’s sleep. Draco can’t agree more, but damn him if Potter doesn't follow him so he can’t go to the Astronomy tower and meet his friends immediately, they make it halfway to the dungeons before he snaps.
you lying to him? We’re already at too many disadvantages here, need I remind you that the ‘Savior of the Wizarding World’ is
“So,” Their tea has long grown cold, his friends wear matching shocked expressions, but they haven’t run away screaming yet. “That’s the truth. As much of it as you’ll get out of me, anyways. I am currently spying on my father and anything else suspicious so I can keep Potter alive, and since I’m protecting him it kinda made sense to befriend him, and yes I’m also working with Dumbledore and Snape, and now I’ve admitted to you two that I am a blood traitor, a worthless excuse for a pureblood, and probably gone mental. But neither of you can talk about it, so now you get to go mad with me.”
As much as he hates to admit it, the creature isn’t that bad. Crabbe and Goyle keep a good distance away, enough that he can speak freely.
When Mister Draco was coming to the Prynne House, it was all broken down and on the verge of collapsing! If he hadn’t given the house a reason to be going on, it would’ve gotten
“Are they supposed to feel like this? It feels like the one I had about Barty Jr. and that old man.”
Food is before him, he doesn’t feel hungry but three sets of eyes stare at him so he picks up his fork.
Lupin leaves them at his desk while he goes upstairs to look for tea. He really could have just called a house elf, but Draco gets the feeling the man just wanted to give the two some time to talk.
to put a pin in. He doesn't understand why they can’t just...wait to do it. Kingsley will be happy that he got dressed, and getting a new wand
“Because, you simpleton, the twenty-third through the twenty-seventh is prime Christmas time, we’ll be too busy celebrating that to celebrate us. The twenty-eighth is going to be a day of recovery from all the visiting, and the thirtieth is pre-new years, the thirty-first being new years
Harry smiles, “Yea. I know, but he’s right about you taking too many classes. You need a break Herm, you’re gonna wear yourself out.”
Draco’s never been close with the Greengrasses, mostly because of their father’s drama. Lucius snubbed Sir Greengrass
Blaise rolls his eyes, “Come now, Pansy, you shouldn’t feel bad for a ghost. I bet she flooded the place for attention since no one visits her.”
He gets a half committal noise back as Remus makes his way to brush back curly black hair and plant a kiss on his forehead.
The reminder comes in the form of said Scar Face glaring at him from three tables away, beady green eyes ruining his search for a fault in his father’s reasoning. Once he does remember, he’s out the door before Harry can think to corner him. How the boy manages to catch up to him in Dumbledore’s stairway, he has no fucking clue.
When he shows her the additions he’s made to the plants in the sunroom, Misty hugs him so hard he worries about his legs breaking, and when he shows her the dress, he has to watch in horror as her little eyes fill with tears.
“Why’d you drag me up here?” Harry asks when they calm, “I thought we weren’t supposed to be friends.”
Blaise pats his shoulder, but he can’t refuse in public, or even put up much of a fight, so Draco rises, making his way to the middle. All eyes lock on the two boys, they walk their ten paces, bow, and then raise their wands.
Theo returns her grin, Draco has an urge to vomit. “I’m flattered, dearest, but you should know that I-”
It’s all anyone could talk about before break...apparently,” his eyes search their faces for the next part, “the last time it was opened, a Mudblood
A couple of red flags stand out against that. Draco locks eyes with his father who’s finally starting to sit up. The man taught Draco almost all he knows that books couldn’t. For starters, when elves picked up wands after their master forbade it, their hands would burn instantly. Instant punishment, because it was such a Big Deal in the wizarding world. He pays close attention to her face and can’t help but notice how similar she looks to his Torture Pixie after the Imperio curse wore off. Both
She speaks evenly and coolly, like a viper waiting to strike, but he’s met a basilisk, and Geia is supposed to be the scariest one out there. Harry squares his shoulders. That’s right, he’s friends with a fucking basilisk. He kissed the hand of Narcissa Malfoy and escaped from Tom Riddle. Some petite suburban mum isn’t going to scare him!
Connections form as his mother takes his hand, waiting for all the other children to vanish before they do the same. Dementors at his house...he should’ve known they weren’t there as a personal favor to his father. Something was
Narcissa takes a step forward. “We’ll deal with three categories; dueling, sneaking, and heritage. Don’t give me that look Draco, we both know how powerful Pureblood lines are. It would be foolish of us not to utilize our ancestor’s gifts.”
Dumbledore should really stop pissing people off. Really, he already has Narcissa, probably Belle, definitely Sirius and Remus pissed at him, but he’s about to have the whole Weasley clan after his head and Harry
“Well.” Draco blinks. “I read a lot, help Misty with the plants, take care of Salem, meet up for brunch, and have suddenly found myself swamped by paperwork.”
Sirius sighs, but pats his head anyways so he’s totally off the hook. “You don’t have to apologize, but at least
When he looks out, his brain quiets. The noise that silence brings fades away into a soothing push and pull.
Draco looks up from his mac and cheese, thankful once again for the seats between him and the others.
They all laugh at that, except for Harry who’s weirdly quiet. Draco wants to ask him about it, but a room full of people might not be the best time.
and Draco almost ran from him every time he had a chance. After their Dementor lessons he would dash out the door without a second look, when he saw the boy in the halls he would turn and walk the other way, at one point Harry started to wonder if Draco was going to skip class to avoid him. Alas, class just seemed to be a good time for the blonde prick to pick on him.
The one I invited you into when your parents had their...accident...I’ve been so kind to you...and this is how you repay me? With filth and squalor?”
Harry blinks himself into focus. Sure enough, Ron and Blaise are still at it, and he can hear Pansy and Hemione giggling from their own shared couch. “It’s just...it’s very warm here, isn’t it? In your chest, I mean. It’s...it’s happy. And good.”
They finish the buttons with their own, Harry makes sure his is the biggest, and then lets the Slytherins and Hermione charm clothing that he brought with him. Hermione is the only one allowed to touch his underwear, and yes, he does make her hide in the corner so no one else can see it.
Sure enough, by Tuesday afternoon Draco’s been approached by several people from different houses for one of the buttons. Gryffindors think it’s funny, Hufflepuffs wanna support Cedric, and the Ravenclaws think the buttons are simply brilliant.
None of them know what to do, but the common room does. A door appears right between the two main fireplaces. Draco takes one look at it, shrugs, and then leads his friends into a surprisingly well kept room, green couches and three cups of tea waiting. He gently sinks into one of the couches, leaning all the way back so he can finally rest his head, and waving a blanket on top of him and the Kneazle curled up on his left collarbone.
“Elf magic is being better, sir.” Misty rolls her eyes, “But Misty is not bound to any magic, the ocean would accept Misty, but only with Mistress’s spell, and Misty cannot be reading wizard’s books, so Mister Draco must be getting a wand and helping Misty. It’s the least he can be doing if he’s planning on
a bad thing. A day inside with his friends doesn’t seem that bad, and really they’re not missing much. Care of Magical Creatures had been put on hold, and although he doesn’t know why, he does have a rather bad feeling about it.
“It is?!” Draco jumps up, dragging Harry with him. “Why didn’t you start with that?! We have to go!”
“Draco! We need to leave! Someone could think this is a part of the Slytherin pranks, we all need to be accounted for before that happens.”
“Great. Second thing is, well it’s a big one. Remus and I talked a lot about it last year, and if you’d like, we can adopt you.”
Howie and June are near tears by the time he stops ranting. Thankfully, Carla just seems fondly exasperated.
“It won’t affect anything if you say no. You’ll still live here, nothing Remus said would change, we just. Well, do you remember your Christmas letter? Your family was ripped from you, and I know you have a new family now, but I thought it’d be nice to have a legal one. If you want it, of course, I mean if you-”
Ginny covers her mouth, “I know now is an awful time to laugh, but I really need to know if you addressed her Pretty.”
I planned out Luna’s dress to match your tux. It’s fine. I can do a few modifications. I’ll bully Daph into telling me Astoria’s measurements, and Harry, don’t worry. I’ll make sure you and Luna look just as lovely as the others.”
Their plan is stupid, it’s so fucking idiotic and Blaise and Pansy remind him of this for the full twenty-six hours between him telling them about it and their arrival at the old Alchemy classroom door.
They end up slurping down fruits out of cans since all the utensils have gone missing, and then Misty insists that Draco take a nap so he’s ready for tonight.
And the only logical fucking answer he can think of is Tom fucking, bitch-faced, homicidal maniac Riddle and his merry gang of violent neanderthals.
Draco sits up and throws open his eyes only to see a lot of weird blurs and fall back within three seconds. A few blinks later and Pansy’s furious face comes into view. The hand playing with his hair is gone. Just like his friend’s patience.
Well, everything he saw, which makes Sirius so pissed the lights start doing weird things and ends with the elf shooing them out of the kitchen because Sirius accidentally busted a few light bulbs and completely ruined the bananas.
Misty follows him over to the table, wide eyes taking in the sights, and then she glances at the soup and frowns.
“Yes sir.” Harry takes a few gulps, though he should probably only be taking sips. “I-it felt like it was happening again and I don’t-”
“Enemies of the Heir, beware!” he calls out, hoping he sounds condescending and not scared out of his mind, “You’ll be next, Mudbloods!”
“No big deal, I guess...but I thought you had more pride than to quit so quickly after one mess up. The Lupin I know would’ve offered himself some chocolate and gotten back on his feet.”
A lot of arguing went on from there, an elf having a wand? Isn’t that silly? Once an elf was in service to someone they simply said ‘no wands’ and the elf could not pick up a wand. They would burn their hands immediately, before the wand was fully in their grasp. Every pureblood wizard knew that, and someone like Crouch should too…
“Yes. You’ve caught me, found out some of Draco Malfoy’s dirty little secrets, surely you realize none of those things can be known. They’ve been hidden for a reason, and I’d like to keep it that way so I’m asking what you want. Money? Homework? A winning streak in Quidditch? What will it take to keep that big mouth of yours shut?”
Sirius had tried it, he’d run full force at a door that was sure to open, putting his entire body weight into it because he’d just gotten home from a full moon trip and was
Draco spits out the name, fully intending for it to sound like an insult, but naturally the idiot smiles at him. “Maybe you should use yours,
“Draco?” Voices echo around him, and then two other arms are around him, one he recognizes as Harry’s, so the other one must be Ron. He pulls away from them, making a quick headcount.
Draco halfway wants to throttle her for being so reckless, but to be that upset would require him to acknowledge his emotions, and if he acknowledges one of them the rest will come out and he isn’t quite ready for that so he holds his breath, and his tongue, waits for the smoke to leave, and then sets the floor so Misty won’t accidentally kill herself.
“She’s stunning!” Pansy coos, getting a white head to purr against her hand. The two hit it off rather nicely, LuLu even tolerated Crabbe and Goyle, and while Draco was still clearly her favorite, Pansy and Blaise seemed to come to a close second.
Footsteps rush up the stairs, Harry barely has enough time to throw the invisibility cloak over himself before Dumbledore is in the room, frowning at the sight of Malfoy. “This is not how I hoped to find you upon my return,” The headmaster looks so sad, stricken with something Harry thinks he feels too.
Draco swallows, fully expecting to see Olivander, to remember his face when the Dark Lord- it’s a kid.
Draco does overhear her mumbling about classes he knows are at the same time and briefly wonders how she does it, but given her current state he’s a little too cowardly to ask.
Hermione laughs a bit, standing and looking around at them. “I can’t go alone, Ron can’t walk, and Draco is too injured to do much…”
“Have you not wreaked enough havoc?” Fleur asks. “I have no idea where you got my personal information, but I assure you, you will regret exposing it.”
What is a home though? Will Hedwig have to stay caged? Will he still cook and clean? What about sleep? What if his cot isn’t as warm?
“You’re taking that thing with you, I hope?” She snorts, but Harry’s more surprised that she’s actually talking about him with someone else. “It won’t do to have a freak in my home, Vernon would faint if he saw what the garbage brought with it this time. Nevermind that Lily could never make the right choices, what with settling us with that-that
Like at least all of London could fit into it, stands completely packed, cheering fans on either side, and he’s following an attractive man to their seats? This
“Ronald Weasley!” Granger snaps, “Get your head out of your ass! Need I remind you that Harry and I could have left you in the dorm tonight, and don’t think I won’t send your sorry attitude right back up there if you can’t show a little respect! Malfoy might have been a wanker in the past, but he has been on our side from the
“Seriously? You two don’t know about her?” At their blank faces she lets out a sigh, “You would be hopeless without me, do you know that? Everyone in the whole school knows to stay out of there. Moaning Myrtle owns the place, and is really rather nasty. As soon as you go in she’s crying and screaming until you leave. Legend says she died fifty years ago in one of the stalls, she had been crying because she was bullied, and stays in there to cry for the rest of eternity. It’s sad if you think about it.”
Now he’s back. Hermione thinks I might be able to see into his head, but Ron thinks I just have incredibly insightful nightmares.”
“Don’t listen to him. He’s right of course, but he’s being a brat because I didn’t let him bring LuLu.”
Striking green eyes peer into his soul, as if telling him they will accept nothing but the truth. Draco can’t lie to those eyes, and he can’t fathom why, so he looks away.
“He’s told me the usual, hate Potter, please the Dark Lord. Apparently, at some point You-Know-Who was merely a student called ‘Tom Riddle’, father’s been particularly obsessed with getting a diary of his. Say’s it holds some of his power, although I’m not sure how much or if it even exists. He got some ratty old book, but there was nothing written in it. I went looking for it but apparently he sold it to Mr. Borgin as a part of our family cleanse. Although, he did mention the Chamber of Secrets….”
“Harry James Potter.” Narcissa snarls from the kitchen. Her head pokes out, followed by her body, Molly, Sirius, and Remus, all wearing matching frowns. “Did you just
Ignoring the fact that he was very blatantly being kicked out, Draco strode out of the office still very confused, but a lot less angry. He was so deep in his thoughts about life without friends, Snape’s bullying, and Potter’s safety that he didn’t even see the boy he was walking right into.
“-And you and Harry will be studying at the same time. I rather hope you can help each other, although Draco you might have to face the boggart.”
“Misty is being sorry, sir. The house is empty now, and Misty could only find one cup, and the water doesn’t work anymore so Misty be having to go to the well.”
Failure found him. Just like in first and second year when he tried to protect Harry. Or when he tried to hide his growing issues from his friends. Would he always fail when it was important? Days would come where failure would not be an option, and he had thought this was one of them…..Draco had been wrong.
I’ve got more money than I know what to do with, and I never would’ve finished the house without you. Call it a ‘thank you’ present, or an investment if you want to, but I really don’t mind.”
Doubtful, but who is Draco to argue with his upperclassmen? On the Sunday before Exams? When he has a study session with Hermione in ten minutes? He’s no one.
Somehow, in the short time he had been gone, the manor had gotten bigger and scary. Once he would giggle and hide in the many rooms, playing outside and sneaking between walls. The manor was his home, there was always music playing and his mother and father were always there to catch him when he climbed too high in the trees out back.
No one bothers to sleep after that, settling in groups around the common room and waiting for more news. Hermione and Ron set aside their feud for the night, joining Harry, Ginny, Neville, Fred and George, Seamus, and Dean by the fire.
He doesn’t listen to his father’s comeback in an effort to reclaim himself, particularly because he heard a noise that shouldn’t be in a shop like this. Something that sounds suspiciously familiar. Making his way around, trying to follow where the sound had come from. Whoever was spying on him would regret it if it was the last thing he did. He can't believe he let himself forget about their little sow watcher, all for a stupid fucking trinket-
He comes to the conclusion that he and Hermione both deserve a long holiday at some beach resort where the idiocy of one Harry Potter wouldn’t be able to hurt them so much. Not that they could stay long, they’d maybe last all of two days before worry got the best of them and they ended up rushing back and demanding a detailed report of what stupidity their friend had gotten up to.
It’s then that Nagini decides to rise from her spot over by the couch, head lifting up as she blinks at Harry.
Blaise drags them into town during the evenings, sometimes shopping, other times to make fun of the weird things in muggle shops, sometimes to libraries that Pansy and Draco get bored of within five seconds.
He screams, really hoping his friends did something dramatic like pass out the second he bowed to her so they can’t yell at him later,
Sirius seems to notice the look, sighing again but this time more fondly. “You wanna go show your boyfriend your shiny new ancestry?”
He doesn’t even complain when she tells him that, in order to deal with the mess upstairs, they have to put in the new staircase today.
Harry extends a hand because he doesn’t know what else to do. Kreecher makes a token attempt to hide his amusement, bowing instead of shaking Harry’s hand.
Mister Draco to save him from the bad ol’ hurt, even if Misty did make Mister Draco do the things he didn’t wanna do.”
Draco studies her for a second before he sighs, “Stop for a second, Granger. It’s past midnight and if we’re going to make any headway tonight we’ll need coffee.”
Life went on at Hogwarts, Pansy did eventually forgive him for his outburst at lunch, and he had even cornered Snape and Dumbledore to talk about Black and why they should be Worried and Very Alarmed, which they both were but hadn’t thought to tell him in light of his adventures the first day back. Hogwarts was, and remains, impenetrable. A small favor really. Defense Against the Dark Arts quickly became one of his favorite classes, never boring and with a teacher who, despite his awful robes, was kind and unusual. Maybe during Christmas break Lupin would find himself with a new wardrobe, but who’s to say.
LuLu makes a few noble attempts to get him to stay, complete with blocking the door, or trying to block the door and too adorably small to do it.
Harry grabs him by the arm and hauls him into an empty classroom, casting locking and silencing spells before Draco can even think to be angry.
He reminds himself that this is nothing. Draco’s faced worse. It’s not being chained to a dungeon and beaten by his own father. Worse things have happened.
Sirius is there, in a fucking suit, Remus by his side, and that’s not nearly strange enough because the Daily Prophet decided to add a picture of Harry from the Tournament.
things he needs before the year began, which is how Draco finds himself entering some shop that holds all his father’s dirty little wishes. They can't bring anything home, not with the Ministry's inspections, but now that he thinks about it, that's probably the whole reason they're here. Too much darkness in one home or something like that.
“Well, you have to understand. That arrogant little prick hadn’t ever met anyone who refused to shake his hand.”
If someone had told him last year that he’d be looking forward to seeing his father he would’ve hexed them blind.
They choir back ‘yes ma’ams’ to her because they value their lives, and once she’s hung up Draco takes to summoning apples to explode.
of the truth, and I found out some pretty interesting things…...so tell me...how long have you been working with Harry Potter?”
Monday begins at 9:45 sharp for his Astronomy exam, followed by Charms and a brief lunch break that quickly turns into a study break for the end of the day DADA Exam. By time Dinner rolls around, Draco’s dead to everything but his notes. Blaise and Pansy steer him to the Gang’s Room, where he becomes aware of Hermione’s notes and some voices around them.
Her smile doesn’t budge an inch, if anything it widens. “I think you’re right. Do you agree Katherine?”
“Why?” Blaise raises an eyebrow at him. “If you and Narcissa are plotting something I demand to be included.”
Apparently, Aunt Petunia is having a dinner party tomorrow, and her friends all like Harry’s cooking, so he’ll be doing the work. All of it. The cooking, the cleaning, scrubbing the dishes, making sure the house is presentable. Guests will arrive at five tomorrow evening, and it’s eleven o’clock. Aunt Petunia hands him a list with a frown like something displeases her.
Christmas day dawned and the loneliness got under his skin. This was, after all, the first time he hadn’t woken up to house elves singing Christmas carols and the smell of breakfast that would be waiting after presents. No hugs and kisses from mother, no loving looks from his parents, not even a cup of tea to wake to. Draco sat in his bed for a long time thinking about the past. Now, instead of hugging him and bestowing a gentleness no one would ever guess Lucius possessed, he was more likely to get a threat and a painful grip on his shoulder. Now, instead of his mother swooping down and squeezing the life out of him before ushering him to his place beside the fire, she would be more likely to owl him from Paris, if he should be so lucky. The surge of emotions hits him like a Bludger to the head and leaves him dizzy.
“It’s okay!” He tells her, brushing a hand across her back, “It’s okay LuLu, stay here. I’ll be back, love.”
Intrigued, the class does as they are told, following the professor out of the class and down the hallway, Draco watches in amazement with the way Lupin deals with Peeves and smiles to himself. Snape be damned, he liked this teacher. They migrate to a secluded classroom with nothing but a wobbly wardrobe inside, Draco is sure to keep an eye on it. Lupin explains the bogart inside, such nasty creatures, but he hadn’t known they were allergic to laughter of all things, who did they think they were? Snape?
something else he doesn’t know. Is Harry having nightmares? Is he sleeping? Surely Kreecher is feeding him, but that doesn’t mean Harry takes the food.
After a brutal Transfiguration Exam that leaves him a little confident and a little dazed, Draco marches on to the Care Of Magical Creatures Exam, which he knows he passed, but he’s at best hoping for an E. He really has no idea what’s happening in Hagrid’s mind, but it doesn’t matter because the after lunch exam is Ancient Studies, and then he and Hermione have to meet up and study for Thursday.
“Don’t worry, love,” Black’s breathless laugh turns some weird type of chord in him, “I don’t think our friends will disagree with you.”
It doesn’t make sense to buy plants, they can barely step in the front door without the little cottage falling apart, but Draco buys a wiggentree and a lavender bush anyways.
The professor lets him in and stares, and really, Draco gets it. His hair is a mess, eyes wide and probably a little crazed, robes all in disarray, and LuLu beside him eyeing him like he might just break down crying right here and now.
On a scale of awful to hellish, the smile he’s looking at is probably the second worst thing he’s seen today, right under realizing a pure creature was going to die because of him. It honestly activates his flight or fight response more than his father does, and that’s saying something.
