“Mandrakes!” Neville bellowed at them over his shoulder as he ran. “Going to lob them over the walls – they won’t like this!”
The last day of the holidays arrived. Thankfully, Mrs Weasley had gotten everyone organised the day before and the morning departure was much less hurried than the summer’s one. The Knight Bus dropped them off at Hogwarts’ gates, barely giving them time to wave goodbye to Remus and Tonks before it disappeared in a flash of purple light.
“I dunno…I mean…bit of it sort of fit together,” said Ron awkwardly. “But when you look at the whole thing…” He took a deep breath. “I think we’re supposed to get rid of Horcruxes, Harry. That’s what Dumbledore told us to do. Maybe…maybe we should forget about this Hallows business.”
“Take me to your common room,” she said suddenly, causing the other boy’s head to shoot up and look at her in surprise.
“You can’t see them?” he said. He was staring directly at the front of the coaches. “They’re pulling the coaches.”
They looked at each other for a moment longer before bursting into uncontrollable laughter. Struggling for breath, they held each other up as Harry and Fred approached them.
Harry’s face fell and he looked hopelessly confused. He glanced at Sarah in question and she quickly stepped forward, rushing up onto the stage to grab his sleeve. She barely registered Snape vanishing the snake as she dragged Harry away.
He moved on silent feet to the back rooms, bypassing the examination rooms. Flicking the light switch on, he smiled at the scene that greeted him.
Harry had been nervous about the first Christmas after the war. Everything was still too recent – every loss and heartbreak and nightmare. But somehow, they had managed to find a shred of happiness and make it grow until the sorrow was pushed away. Yes, there had still been some tears hastily brushed away when people thought no one was looking, but overall, everyone was healing.
“You’re working with me,” Pansy announced, still pulling Sarah bodily across the classroom. Snape looked at them curiously but chose not the comment. Sarah saw Draco gaping at them before Harry got his attention, leading him away to another corner.
“Pansy, enough!” He shouted, successfully extracting himself from the other girl. He patted his hair back into place before beginning to fill his plate.
“ – we’ve tried being polite; it’s time to play dirty, like him. He wouldn’t like the Minister of Magic knowing what he did – “
“You should come in sometime when you’re not working,” Teddy said. “I can show you my favourite books.”
to cause some havoc.” A few scattered laughs sounded. “That’s why I actually brought something with me.” She reached into her pocket and smiled reassuringly at the slightly wary guests. “Don’t worry, it’s not anything dangerous. It’s a Pygmy Puff.” She withdrew it from her pocket and displayed it so everyone could see. It was a horrendous bright green with a lopsided red mark on its chin. Two tufts of fur on its head made it look like it had horns. “Hideous little thing, isn’t he? George made him for me not long after Fred and I started officially dating. I never told anyone about him, because it was George's and my secret. He said that he wanted to give me something that reflected who I really was.” She smirked wryly at the ugly ball of fluff. “I wasn’t sure if I was meant to be offended or not until he explained further. He said that, no matter what happened in life, I could look at LS and remember that I may be soft and fluffy on the inside, but on the outside, I’ll always be a horrid little snake.” Laughter burst from the crowd as Fred stared at her incredulously. “I obviously hexed George tremendously at that, he couldn’t walk straight for a week” – more laughter, now mingled with renewed sobs – “The point is that no matter how dark or scary life gets, you always have the ability to make yourself or someone else smile, but only if you let yourself. Regardless of how offensive it may be. George would want us all to live our lives to fullest and to not get stuck on the bad times. Remember George and smile. And then make someone else smile.”
“We’ll never get out, it’s too big!” Hermione screamed, but the dragon opened its mouth and belched flame again, blasting the tunnel, whose floors and ceiling cracked and crumbled. By sheer force, the dragon clawed and fought its way through. Sarah’s eyes were shut tight against the heat and dust: deafened by the crashing of rock and the dragon’s roars, she could only cling to its back, expecting to be shaken off at any moment; then she heard Draco yelling, “
“Blimey, I hope they escaped,” said Ron, leaning back on his pillows. The tea seemed to be going him good; a little of his colour had returned. Sarah made a mental note to give him another potion in a few hours. “If any of them end up in Azkaban because of us…”
Sarah ignored the pounding in her head and moved to sit up. She gasped as pain shot through her left arm and side. She turned her head to see a large bandage wrapped around her, her left arm tightly secured in a sling.
“Oh for Merlin’s sake,” scoffed Lyra, “You can bring them with you if you must. We just need to talk,
Harry had confessed two days ago that he had told Cedric about the dragons – Karkaroff and Madame Maxime had seen them and Cedric was the only one left in the dark.
“Well…” Draco said, looking at Harry with a raised eyebrow. His husband merely shrugged in response. “That would mean getting married, Rosie, darling.”
” and hurried away; and Professor Babbling refrained from giving them homework for the rest of the week.
And then Karkaroff froze. He turned his head back to Harry and stared at him as though he couldn’t believe his eyes. Behind their headmaster, the other students of Durmstrang came to a halt too, staring curiously at Harry. Sarah saw Viktor, Mila and Aleksander roll their eyes and whisper to each other.
“I just didn’t sleep too well last night,” she admitted, glancing at Harry and smiling sadly. “It was a bit difficult getting out of bed.”
“Don’t be a stranger, Viktor,” Sarah said, waving to the trio as they left to go meet with the other Durmstrang students.
“You’re all crazy,” Ron announced. He turned to Harry with pleading eyes. “Harry, please tell me you’re not mad like them!”
“Someone’s going to come looking for us,” countered Sarah. “Do you really want your mother walking in here? Or Sirius?”
“We couldn’t get a Portkey from Prague until this afternoon,” Daphne replied primly. “The Headmistress was kind enough to let us arrive this evening.”
“Not if we all work together,” Remus suggested. “At least to start with. When more people arrive, we can split up more – it’s just not safe doing it separate rooms alone.”
And then Sarah heard a thin, piteous human scream from amidst the terrible commotion, the thunder of devouring flame.
Sarah and Draco had elected to help Harry prepare for the third task. Remus and Sirius had sent them a list of useful spells and hexes that Harry should learn, so every lunch period, the three of them practiced in the Transfiguration classroom, occasionally joined by Hermione and Ron.
She drew back and watched as her world started again, as Remus took a shuddering breath, his heartbeat getting stronger and stronger. Sarah let out a horrendous sob and latched onto Sirius, who was watching his husband breath as though it was the most glorious thing in the universe.
Sarah rolled her eyes at him. “Not all of us are eternally optimistic Gryffindors. Some of us are realists.”
Lucius froze, his index finger hovering over his own Mark. Bellatrix strode over the Snatcher with Gryffindor’s sword, dragging Sarah along with her.
“That will do, Severus,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Think about what you are saying. This door has been locked since I left the ward ten minutes ago. Madam Pomfrey, have these students left their beds?”
echoed through the Hall on his every other step. He reached the end of the top table, turned right, and limped heavily toward Dumbledore. Another flash of lightning crossed the ceiling. Pansy gasped.
The floating people were suddenly illuminated as they passed over a burning tent and Sarah recognised one as the muggle who had directed them toward their campsite that morning. The other three looked as though they might be his wife and children. One of the marchers below flipped the woman upside down with his wand; her nightdress fell down to reveal drawers and she struggled to cover herself up as the crowd below her screeched and hooted with glee.
“She had a bit of a go at them last night,” Lee Jordan chimed in. “T’was quite amusing to see them cowed by the threat of their mother.”
“Welcome! I have a few things to say to you all before you become befuddled by our excellent feast…”
“Fred wrote some beautiful words,” she announced to the sombre guests. “I would like to read them to you.”
“Sometimes you really annoy me,” Sarah grouched as they finally found the compartment containing Harry, Ron and Hermione’s distinct hair.
Lyra clapped and squealed excitedly. Harry was extremely happy to see her slowly returning to her normal self, the horrors of the Dementors being left behind her.
Draco was fighting so viciously against his bonds that Crabbe had to wrap his arms around Draco’s chest, keeping him still.
It took Harry a moment to understand what Draco was referring to but when he did, he quickly put down the book he was holding.
“It’s quite straightforward, really,” said Neville modestly. “I’d been in here about a day and a half, and getting really hungry, and wishing I could get something to eat, and that’s when the passage to the Hog’s Head opened up. I went through it and met Aberforth. He’s been providing us with food, because for some reason, that’s the one thing the Room doesn’t really do.”
Sarah beamed at them as the rest of the house trooped out of the Hall. A few older students remained seated and steadfastly ignored the looks some of the more prejudiced Slytherins gave them.
“Ronald, the truth is, I don’t see much communication in your relationship,” Sarah said bluntly. “Fred and I talk most nights and it’s usually just about what’s been happening in our lives. Sometimes we only send a ‘goodnight’ or ‘good morning’ and nothing else. But for us, it shows that we love each other so much that we think about the other at the start and end of our days.”
The rest of the night passed quite quickly and soon people began to trickle home. Sarah was quite amused to see Blaise leaving with Parvati Patil, a smug grin on his face. The Weasleys all offered warm goodbyes with promises of seeing them the coming Sunday, and then Sirius and Remus left with Andromeda and Teddy, leaving only Narcissa, Harry, Draco, Ron, Hermione, Fred and Sarah. Narcissa soon disappeared back into the house, leaving the young adults alone to recline on beanbags near the low fireplace.
Hagrid had introduced Blast-Ended Skrewts at the start of term and had happily told them that their assignment would be to raise them and see what they could do. Sarah was sure that they were an illegal mix between two other creatures but she cared too much about Hagrid to raise the issue, so every other day, she and Draco would trudge reluctantly down to Hagrid’s cabin to observe the Skrewts. More often then not, they returned to the castle covered in burns or stings, luckily avoiding the blood-sucking parts of some of the creatures.
“I don’t know why – I didn’t even experience half of what Harry did and he’s holding up better than me, I think at least…” she muttered.
“Well, you’ve done so,” replied Sarah. “Unfortunately, we seem to be in a bit of situation at the moment…”
Harry nodded and Sarah left quickly, hurrying down the corridor in the direction Hermione and Draco went. She peered into the compartments until she found the distinctive flash of blond hair and mane of bushy brown locks. Pulling the door open, she entered and dropped into the seat beside Draco.
A roaring, billowing noise behind her gave her a moment’s warning. She turned and saw both Ron and Crabbe running as hard as they could up the aisle towards them.
Harry muttered an apology and sat down in a free armchair. Sarah and Draco had claimed the table closest to the fire to do homework but had been constantly distracted by Harry’s pacing for the past half hour.
“One of their fake wands again!” she shouted. “How many times have I told them not to leave them lying around?”
They had Potions that afternoon, which Draco came out of beaming. Then came Astronomy at midnight, up on the tallest tower; History of Magic on Wednesday morning, in which Sarah scribbled everything Florean Fortescue had ever told her and Harry about medieval witch-hunts. Wednesday afternoon meant Herbology, in the greenhouses under the baking hot sun; then back to the common room once more, with sunburnt necks, thinking longingly of this time next day, when it would all be over.
“I’m sure we can find a night that suits everyone,” said Hermione slightly impatiently, “but you know, this is rather important, we’re talking about learning to defend ourselves against V-Voldemort’s Death Eaters – “
“The poisoner didn’t know Slughorn very well, then,” said Hermione, speaking for the first time in hours and sounding as though she had a bad head cold. “Anyone who knew Slughorn would have known there was a good chance he’d keep something that tasty for himself.”
Conversation about school, Quidditch and other random topics flowed around them as Harry continued to work on Draco’s hair. Sarah had undone her previous braids to give Harry more hair to work with.
“It’s nothing,” the raven-haired boy said. “We’d better get going, Hagrid, it’s Transfiguration next and we’ve got to pick up our books.”
They marched in silence around a corner and she stopped before a large and extremely ugly stone gargoyle.
Sarah’s head shot up at Draco’s shout. Harry had appeared from nowhere and was racing after a group of fleeing Death Eaters.
The high, cold voice echoed across the empty courtyard as the Death Eaters stopped before them. Hagrid’s ginormous figure was led through the crowd but the relief Sarah felt at seeing him alive was quickly distinguished by the small shape lying dead in his arms.
“If you don’t stop moving, I’ll Body-Bind you,” Sarah said to Harry in a warning tone after he shuffled again, dislodging her head from his stomach.
“How’s Fluffy today?” Draco asked once they were situated in the examination room. “Any other symptoms?”
The goblin ate only grudgingly with the rest of them. Even after his legs had mended, he continued to request trays of food in his room, like the still frail Ollivander, until Bill (following an angry outburst from Fleur) went upstairs to tell him that the arrangement could not continue. Thereafter, Griphook joined them at the overcrowded table, although he refused to eat the same food, insisting, instead, on lumps of raw meat, roots and various fungi.
She stared at him, still trying to recover his surprise appearance. “And how do you know this?” she asked incredulously.
by Wilbert Slinkhard’, shined in bright letters on the front. “See, if you turn to the introduction, Mr Slinkhard explains that this book should be used alongside the Magical Theory one, as it provides the groundwork for the spells – “
“You know my father would look there first,” sighed Sarah. “It’s safer for you if I’m not there. But you can visit me!”
“If that’s the case, Miss Deaumont,” Snape snarled, “Then why don’t you explain the difference between – “
“Hey, love, I’m glad you’re okay,” he whispered into her ear. He kissed her softly and then pulled back, looking carefully into her eyes. “I heard about your dad…”
Sarah cocked her head at him. “I really doubt that Voldemort would try to curse Harry through a necklace, Ronald.”
“Have a butterbeer.” Ron pressed a bottle onto Harry. “I’ll go get you one, Sarah, hang on. I can’t believe it – where’s Hermione and Draco gone?”
Angelina’s whistle sounded and Sarah looked up; Katie was now chalk-white and covered in blood. Harry, Alicia, Fred and George were all flying fast toward her.
There was a great roar and a surge towards the foot of the stairs. Harry, Draco and Luna disappeared from view as most of the occupants of the room ran past them, their wands drawn, heading up to into the main castle.
is the unfortunate lady who’s dating our little brother,” Charlie’s voice came from above her and she pulled herself free of his grasp.
“All I saw,” said Ernie stubbornly, though he was trembling as he spoke, “was you speaking Parseltongue and chasing the snake toward Justin.”
“Well, you’re the one who’s supposed to be researching magical methods of bugging!” said Harry. “You tell me how she did it!”
Snape gave her an ironic bow and Sarah panicked. She shouted out the first thing she could think of.
Draco scowled slightly at Pansy’s question. “Yes,” he muttered bitterly, “Potter thinks it’s a good idea – safe, he said.”
One hundred thousand wizards gasped as the two Seekers, Krum and Lynch, plummeted through the centre of the Chasers, so fast that it looked as though they had just jumped from the top of a tower without wings.
“I’m not putting them on,” said old Archie in indignation. “I like a healthy breeze ‘round my privates, thanks.”
Professor Snape was staring at Lupin with an expression of intense loathing, one that Sarah had only seen him wear when he dealt with Harry.
After the darkness of the first room, the lamps hanging low on golden chains from this ceiling gave the impression that this long rectangular room was much brighter, though there were no glittering, shimmering lights. The room was quite empty except for a few desks and, in the very middle of the room, an enormous glass tank of deep-green water, big enough for all of them to swim in, which contained a number of pearly white objects that were drifting around lazily in the liquid.
“I just can’t believe he’s actually gone,” he whispered, reaching down to grip Lyra’s hand tightly. “Part of me doesn’t want to accept it.”
“Ah,” she said softly, moving around her desk to examine her hand and then Harry’s, whose was in a similar state. “Good. That ought to serve as a remainder to you, oughtn’t it? You may leave for tonight.”
Sirius placed a hand on his heart. “I would never,” he declared dramatically. When Remus turned away to say hello to Hermione, Sirius winked at Sarah. “Moony’s a good snog.”
“What are you doing?” she hissed. “This is the worst thing you could possibly do. Do you want me to die – Oh, hi Harry, how are you?”
Sarah turned around to see Fleur Delacour hurrying up the stone steps into the castle. Beyond her, far across the grounds, Sarah could see Hagrid helping Madame Maxime to back two of the giant horses into their harnesses. The Beauxbatons carriage was about to take off.
“There will be no more Sorting at Hogwarts School,” said Voldemort. “There will be no more houses. The emblem, shield and colours of my noble ancestor, Salazar Slytherin, will suffice for everyone, won’t they, Neville Longbottom?”
“Fear not, Potter,” Draco said, waving a hand through the air as he marched past the other man, holding the door open. “It seems that old habits die hard.”
“Then Madam Pomfrey will fix him up,” Flint shrugged, turning away as their timeout ended. “Concentrate on the game, Deaumont!”
“He speaks very highly of you,” said the same witch. Sarah couldn’t for the life of her remember the witch’s name. Thankfully, the witch turned towards Draco next. “And Mr Malfoy, I believe you were partly responsible for the legislation that just passed regarding werewolf rights?”
“It’s all conspiracies and hearsay, though,” Draco stated. “It’s just a story. Where did Harry go? Harry? Harry – oh.”
“Because I was feeling ill from the cold of the party,” Sarah interrupted, her voice strong and even. “I’ve been feeling unwell for the past few days and the presence of hundreds of ghosts caused me to react badly. We were heading up to the Gryffindor common room to warm up and complete our homework.”
“Nonsense,” Harry said. He pulled Draco on the bed with him. “We’re staying here. We’re not leaving you alone tonight.”
“Oh, don’t thank me,” she laughed. “I can only deal with so much of Draco’s whining. This is entirely for selfish reasons.”
“Of course he told you that,” said Harry, “but he was Dumbledore’s spy from the moment you threatened her, and he’s been working against you ever since! Dumbledore was already dying when Snape finished him!”
“It’s really, really rare,” said Neville, beaming. “I don’t know if there’s one in the greenhouse at Hogwarts, even. I can’t wait to show it to Professor Sprout. My great-uncle Algie got it for me in Assyria. I’m going to see if I can breed from it.”
“All these trials are a nuisance,” scowled Yaxley as the lift shuddered downward. “The amount of Mudbloods daring to claim respectable blood is disgusting. It’s a good thing you and Dolores have reinstated compulsory registration – otherwise our society would be destroyed by filth.”
“But it likely was,” Draco choked out. “If I hadn’t spent more time near magic, this might not have happened.”
“Let’s leave them to it,” Ron muttered to them as Mrs Weasley swelled like a bullfrog. “Come on, we’ll go to my bedroom.”
“That’s why you should have hired those extras I told you to,” Lyra chided. “Anyway, isn’t Ron going to be working at the store. I’m sure he wouldn’t mind covering for a week or so every so often.”
“She just needs to stand there and hang onto your arm,” Sarah said. “It’s a good thing you look so much like your father.”
“Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies and Care of Magical Creatures. I also want to try the Ancient Studies extra-curricular but I need to make sure that Quidditch won’t clash with it,” said Sarah, reading off her list.
Sarah straightened her shoulders and said, “I’m – I’m sorry everyone,” she added a tremor to her voice to make it seem like she was about to break down, “But – but I can’t – can’t go through that pain again.”
“It’s a bummer, all right,” George was saying gloomily to Fred. “But if he won’t talk to us in person, we’ll have to send him the letter after all. Or we’ll stuff it into his hand. He can’t avoid us forever.”
“Wormtail,” said Voldemort, with no change in his quiet, thoughtful tone, and without removing his eyes from the revolving body above, “have I not spoken to you about keeping our prisoner quiet?”
“To hell with the Ministry,” growled Greyback. “They’ll take the credit, and we won’t get a look in. I say we take him straight to You-Know-Who.”
“Is it safe to come back inside?” he called out. “Granger’s getting angry because she left her notes in here.”
“But I thought they were being kept in the Ministry!” Harry continued. “No one said anything about Azkaban.”
“Hurry!” Sarah called after him. She turned to Leanne, who was shaking with fear and sobs. “Leanne, I need you to help me!” The girl didn’t move. “
Harry placed the elf in the grave, arranged his tiny limbs so that he might have been resting, then climbed out and gazed for the last time upon the little body. Sarah watched him sadly, wrapping her arm around Draco’s waist.
“Of course not!” snapped Draco. “What we’re doing will benefit everyone in the end, it’s all about trying to get rid of You-Know-Who – “
“Horrid,” he confessed quietly. “Madam Pomfrey just gave me Skele-Gro and I think Polyjuice is going to taste better.”
“Many of our oldest family trees become a little diseased over time,” he said as Bellatrix gazed at him, breathless and imploring. “You must prune yours, must you not, to keep it healthy? Cut away those parts that threaten the health of the rest.”
“They got to me, too,” Sarah said, raising an eyebrow. “It doesn’t make you any less of a good Quidditch player.”
Hagrid presided over the easiest Care of Magical Creatures exam ever. He had provided a large tub of fresh flobberworms and told them that to pass the test, their flobberworms had to still be alive by the end of the hour. It gave Sarah and the others the ability to talk to Hagrid about Buckbeak as they left their flobberworms to their own devices.
Sarah peered at Draco’s timetable and compared it to her own. He had Muggle Studies and Arithmancy first at nine o’clock while she only had Muggle Studies. Then they both had double Transfiguration and a single period of Charms before lunch. After lunch they had double Care of Magical Creatures, then Ancient Runes. This also meant that Sarah had Ancient Studies at the same time.
“Excuse me,” said Xenophilius, and he strode over to the machine, seized a grubby tablecloth from beneath an immense number of books and papers, which all tumbled onto the floor, and threw it over the press, somewhat muffling the loud bangs and clatters. He then faced Harry.
“He is,” Harry agrees. “Whenever we’re in a group he always insists on saying the password. It’ll be a shame when it changes.”
“Curfew’s been broken, you heard the noise,” one of his companions told the barman. “Someone was out in the street against regulations – “
“You picked the losing side, Deaumont! I warned you!” Crabbe sneered. “Too late now. Muggle-lovers like your Weasleys, and you too, Malfoy – your family will be disgraced when you choose
“Anyway,” said Hermione, continuing the conversation as though a lump of wood had not just attacked them, “Slughorn’s going to have a Christmas party and there’s no way you two will be able to wriggle out of this one because he actually asked me to check your free evenings, so he could be sure to have it on a night you can come.”
“Well, for one thing, they both ought to have been fatal and weren’t, although that was pure luck. And for another, neither the poison nor the necklace seems to have reached the person who was supposed to be killed. Of course,” she added broodingly, “that makes the person behind this even more dangerous in a way, because they don’t seem to care how many people they finish off before they actually reach their victim.”
“Shall we have a nightcap, then?” asked Mr Weasley loudly, leaping to his feet as Mrs Weasley scowled at Fleur. “Who wants eggnog?”
“Lyra, my comfort zone has been so completely demolished in the last few years that I don’t even know what my comfort zone is,” Draco sighed.
“Then she’ll be somewhere they can constantly watch her,” finished Sarah. “Whether she survives now…” She scowled at the grass in front of her.
“It’s a quiet little place,” Potter said with a smile. “But I love it. It gives people a place to delve into whatever stories interest them. Ron said I was going through a mid-life crisis.”
Sarah looked at him in concern as he sat low in his chair. Others in the class kept sending him furtive glances. Professor McGonagall was telling them about Animagi (wizards who could transform at will into animals), but Harry didn’t even react when she suddenly transformed herself in front of their eyes into a tabby cat with spectacle markings around her eyes.
Luna played with a strand of her hair and smiled. “It will be nice to see Ginny again. Does Muriel have flowers? I’d like to see smell them. Sometimes I could in the cellar when the wind blew through the small window. They smelt lovely.”
Sarah smiled sadly alongside Draco as Harry cut into his giant Snitch cake that Mrs Weasley had baked for him. Judging from the expressions on Hermione and Ron’s faces, Sarah guessed they too were feeling something similar to her at the moment.
“I would love zat, Sarah,” gushed Fleur. “I regret not talking to you more during ze year. I ‘ad been ‘oping to speak with you once I ‘ad ‘eard you speak Français.”
“But – Remus, that’s so dangerous,” Sarah said worriedly. Fred tightened his arm around her as she said, “What if you get hurt? How will we know?”
“I think we should go see if Harry has anything else to tell us,” she said, her voice strong despite its slight waver.
Draco rolled his eyes but began styling Sarah’s hair. She had changed it back to her usual auburn colour but had lightened it, making it shine in the light reminiscent of her mother’s. Draco meticulously pulled the longer strands into a crown braid on top of her head, weaving in some small blood-red flowers. Smaller strands framed her face in soft curls.
An arm slipped around his waist as the music started and Harry turned to see Draco smiling at him, his silver eyes bright and slightly red from crying.
“I dare you to flirt with Longbottom tomorrow at breakfast,” said Blaise, his teeth gleaming brightly in the dimly lit room. Only a few candles flickered around the large space, casting moving shadows on the walls and roof.
Sarah scoffed. “He went on and on about my grades but the minute I mentioned that you achieved the same, Draco, he clammed up and ignored me the rest of the time.
The worst part about the detentions was Angelina’s reaction. She cornered him just as he and Sarah arrived at the Gryffindor table for breakfast Tuesday morning and shouted so loudly that Professor McGonagall came sweeping down upon the trio from the staff table.
Sarah, Draco, Harry, Hermione and Neville were all knocked backwards off their feet. Neville was thrown over the desk and disappeared from view, Hermione and Draco smashed into a bookcase and was promptly deluged in a cascade of heavy books; the back of Harry’s head slammed into the stone wall behind him and Sarah crashed into his body, hitting her left arm painfully against the corner of the desk.
“April?” Sarah asked, setting down her drink. “So you’ve decided you’re not going to take your N.E.W.Ts?”
“You tried to do the right thing, Harry,” Draco said softly squeezing Harry’s hand. “They have to sort it out between them.”
Draco was sitting up, one hand rubbing at his face. He looked around the room groggily and Lyra was pleased to note that he didn’t seem to be visibly shaking – unlike her when she first woke up.
“But you would not have taken her classes,” said Voldemort. “For those of you who do not know, we are joined here tonight by Charity Burbage who, until recently, taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.”
“Get Potter!” shrieked Bellatrix, and she ran at him. He dodged her and sprinted back up the room to stand in front of Draco’s prone body.
“You realise that I am on my way downstairs to interrogate your wife, Cattermole? In fact, I’m quite surprised you’re not down there holding her hand while she waits. Already given her up as a bad job, have you? Probably wise. Be sure and marry a pureblood next time.”
One thing that was quickly becoming a favoured tradition for Sarah was regular tea with Professor Lupin.
“By the way,” she was shouting as Sarah shot a Stunning Spell at another Death Eater, “did I tell you I‘m gay?”
Harry looked down in interest as she began another braid. “Can you teach me how to do that?” he asked.
“Who else is there?” he asked, turning his head from side to side. “Your tone displeases me! The girl and her friends were foolhardy in the extreme. Thieving from the headmaster!”
Bagman did the smallest of double takes when he heard Harry’s name, and his eyes performed the familiar flick upward to the scar on Harry’s forehead. He didn’t comment, however, and instead turned towards Draco and Sarah with a big smile.
The harsh words failed to penetrate the fog in Harry’s mind as he continued to turn over what he had learned.
A flick of Sarah’s wand had the others alerted that they needed to meet the pair in the library. Within minutes, Hermione, Draco and Ron walked through the doorway and took available seats around the large room.
The blond looked down at her in surprise, a soft smile growing on his face. “I love you too, Sarah.”
The walls were lined with wooden bookcases, and instead of chairs there were large silk cushions on the floor. A set of shelves at the far end of the room carried a range of instruments such as Sneakoscopes, Secrecy Sensors, and a large, cracked Foe-Glass.
“Harry! Look at me!” Sarah told him, gripping his chin in her hand. “No, don’t go back to sleep. HARRY!”
“It was someone being tortured!” said Neville, who had gone very white and spilt sausage rolls all over the floor. “You’re going to have to fight the Cruciatus Curse!”
“Probably,” Draco said. He pointed up further. “There’s a Weasley up there but I bet the others weren’t included because of Sirius’ mother.”
A nearby mother looked at her indignantly and took her child’s hand, leading them away from the counter.
“Oh, yes,” she said, extricating herself from beside him and pulling her handbag toward her. She rummaged around until she felt the tell-tale gold chain and withdrew it with a frown.
“Hardly,” chortled Dirk. “Griphook here told me, he heard about it from Bill Weasley who works for the bank. One of the kids who tried to take the sword was Bill’s younger sister.”
“I doubt you’ll last five minutes,” Draco said. “Although, it might be less considering you’ll also have to dodge my mother and Molly Weasley.”
A door slammed in the distance and it was immediately followed by a sing-song voice calling his name.
“How is your mother, Draco?” Mrs Zabini asked during a break in the conversation. “I have yet to introduce her to my darling, Stephen.”
“Have you ever thought about going into Healing?” Madam Pomfrey asked Sarah suddenly as she cleaned up.
Sarah finally breathed a sigh of relief. They didn’t have to worry until June the twenty-fourth…plenty of time to prepare Harry for whatever awaited him in the last task…
They looked over their shoulders to find Ron standing well back, seeming to be fighting the impulse to run.
Several people screamed – Sarah felt something white-hot graze the side of her face – she plunged her hand into her robes for her wand but before she’d even touched it, he heard a second loud BANG and a roar that echoed through the entrance hall.
“No, Malfoy Manor,” she said sarcastically, rolling her eyes. “Yes, my Manor. It’s basically just been sitting there ever since Greg and Theo moved out.”
“I was just wondering how much the girls are talking about that we’ll never know!” Blaise complained.
“You’d think he’d have learnt his lesson by now,” Fred muttered darkly. After Sarah had told him about the incident in eighth year, Fred had marched right up to Smith during graduation and clocked him in the face, causing the weedy man to fall into a groaning heap on the floor. Sarah had never loved Fred more.
Sarah could think of multiple things she’d rather do than de-gnome the garden but Harry looked so excited by the concept that she nodded along in agreement, elbowing Draco who groaned but also agreed.
“After you got hit, Hermione and I distracted the snake and managed to grab you and my idiotic boyfriend and Disapparate,” Draco explained.
“I would never leave you, Ly,” he promised. “It’s you and me, always. Even if we have no one else, we’ll always have each other.”
Draco took the letter in hands that thankfully only trembled slightly. Slitting it open, he withdrew the expensive parchment and scanned the information quickly, jaw tightening at his father’s concise words.
“Draco, take the boys to the dungeons,” Bellatrix told him. She turned back to Granger and scowled. “I think we need to have a little chat –
“That was a nightmare,” muttered Madam Pomfrey, her light hair dishevelled into a wiry halo around her tired face. “Remind me to give Professor Slughorn an earful at dinner.”
Sarah groaned and dropped her head into her hands as everyone burst into laughter around the table. Fred’s hand was rubbing her back in a commiserating manner. She knew she’d never hear the end of this. By the end of the day, all the kids would know the new phrase and then probably spend the night crying after been disciplined by their parents.
“That’s not a cat! It’s a bloody monster!” Ron snapped, crossing his arms over his chest. “I have no idea why she bought that
Draco let out a growl and leapt forward, swinging his foot at Black. Sarah joined in and threw herself at Black, shoving him away as Draco pulled Harry to his feet. From the corner of her eye, she saw Harry grab his wand and point it at Black but before she could move, Black grabbed her arms and held them at her side, restraining her. Harry faltered, his wand lowering slightly.
“Sarah, you can’t bullshit me,” Harry said. “I don’t know if you realise it, but your eyes change colour sometimes based on your emotions. And if you’re especially tired, they go a dark grey.”
them!” he said, straightening from the wall to meet her halfway across the hallway. “What did you say to them?” he asked, slightly more calmly.
“Ah, you’ve finally gotten to that stage,” Remus said with a smile. “Good for you guys.” He looked over his shoulder at where Sirius and Fred were hunched close together in a slightly concerning way and seemed to choose to ignore the potential problem. “You should have a house-warming party when you're settled.”
“Why Snape?” Professor McGonagall asked. “Albus always said he had an ironclad reason for why he trusted Snape.”
Draco hugged her instead of replying. He knew that she meant well but there was no way he would ever be able to tell her what happened. It would include revealing that he was a wizard and effectively breaking the Statute of Secrecy.
“You’re right, Harry,” Sarah said softly. “But don’t let the fear of it ending overwhelm you enjoying the moment.”
“Ooookay,” said Sarah. She jumped over the back of the couch and curled herself up against Hermione. Fred and George waved goodbye to them and disappeared off to their room.
“Of course,” Sarah said after it became obvious that Draco had been struck silent by the fact the Viktor Krum remembered his name. She grabbed Draco’s arm and began to lead the Durmstrang students to the free spaces that had appeared along the Slytherin table.
“Yes,” she whispered. “Yes, of course! Yes!” she said louder, throwing her arms around Fred’s neck and rocking them back slightly. She pressed a shaky kiss to his lips, allowing Fred to pull her left hand towards him when they separated, the ring sliding to fit perfectly on her finger.
He recounted a story of Grindelwald carving that sign on the walls of Durmstrang, resulting in it being associated with Dark Magic. Sarah looked at him in astonishment.
“Merlin, what’s got you in such a slump?” Sarah exclaimed as she hauled open the compartment door to find Harry sitting against the window, scowling.
“Yes,” confirmed Lupin. “Evelyn was a Lynx and Peter was a rat, which meant they could press the knot on the Whomping Willow to allow Sirius and James into the tunnel. They would join me – a werewolf will only attack humans but other animals are safe.”
“Are you just going to keep staring at that or are you going to pack?” Harry asked him, coming up behind him and wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist. Draco relaxed back against his chest and turned his head so that Harry could press a kiss to his throat.
The gate creaked as they opened it. The zigzagging path leading to the front door was overgrown with a variety of odd plants, including a bush covered in the orange radish-like fruit Luna sometimes wore as earrings. Sarah thought she recognised a Snargaluff and gave the wizened stump a wide berth. Two aged crab apple trees, bent with the wind, stripped of leaves but still heavy with berry-sized red fruits and bushy crowns of white-beaded mistletoe, stood sentinel on either side of the front door. A little owl with a slightly flattened, hawklike head peered down at them from one of the branches.
“I don’t understand why they keep asking me?” Harry whined one afternoon in the Slytherin common room. “I mean – it’s not like I’m not being obvious about the fact that I’m dating Draco!”
“Think, Miss Deaumont,” she said sharply. “Getting on the wrong side of Dolores Umbridge will not only have negative consequences here but also outside Hogwarts. Think of what she could do to someone like Remus if she found out you were his goddaughter.” Professor McGonagall turned to Harry. “Or Arthur Weasley, who
“I allowed to give my opinion, Warrington,” she said coolly. “Keep treating me like this and my Quaffles might start missing.”
“Do you think I have an ounce of courage within me, Harry?” Draco asked him incredulously. “Every time I tried to get the nerve to confess, I would always talk myself out of it with some half-arsed excuse. Lyra nearly started pulling
“ – I meant to, and that’s what did it. I’ve done what my mother did. They’re protected from you. Haven’t you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding? You can’t torture them. You can’t touch them. You don’t learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?”
“Did Draco seriously make this?” He said excitedly, holding up his own personalised book. His cover was of a mountain range at dusk, the shadows moving slowly across the ground.
“We’ve got to get out of here,” Draco said. “Sarah, you and I will take the front and rear while the others go in the middle.”
!” she exclaimed. She rushed forward to undo her spells but stopped suddenly. “Wait – how I do I know you’re actually him?” she demanded.
The jet of red light flew over the Death Eater’s shoulder hit a glass-fronted cabinet on the wall. The Death Eater snatched up his wand, which lay on the floor beside the glittering bell jar. Draco ducked down behind another desk as the man turned – his mask had slipped so that he could not see, he ripped it off with his free hand and shouted, “
No sooner than he had he spoken, Professor Dumbledore called out that the Beauxbatons delegation was arriving.
“Now,” she said in a sickeningly sweet voice, “you’re going to tell us what we want to know or I’m going to call the dementors to suck out your soul, kay?”
Footsteps and shouts echoed from behind the door they had just sealed. Sarah put her ear close to the door to listen and heard Lucius Malfoy roar: “Leave Nott,
“What’s this?” said Mrs Longbottom sharply. “Haven’t you told your friends about your parents, Neville?”
“Okay,” he said, “Well, feel free to drop by whenever you want. I’ve altered the wards to let you both in.”
“I’ve not bin meself lately,” said Hagrid, stroking Fang with one hand and mopping his face with the other. “Worried abou’ Buckbeak, an’ no one likin’ me classes – “
“Not necessarily,” Sarah said slowly. “I think that the lies being spread about you in the press and through people’s opinions would irritate anyone. You just feel it more intensely than others may.”
In one swift, fluid motion Neville broke free of the Body-Bind Curse upon him; the flaming Hat fell off him and he drew from its depth something silver, with a glittering, rubied handle –
But he seemed to have no control over what he had done. Flames of abnormal size were pursuing them, licking up the sides of the junk bulwarks, which were crumbling to soot at their touch.
“Excellently put, Royal, and you’ve got my vote for Minister of Magic if we ever get out of this mess,” said Lee. “And now, over to Romulus for our popular feature: Pals of Potter.”
They spent the day playing in the snow with the Weasley twins, Ginny, Pansy and Blaise, before they all trooped inside, exhausted, for the Christmas dinner.
“Dittany…dittany…” Sarah muttered under her breath, searching through her bag with shaking hands. “Where’s the fucking dittany!”
“Dumbledore’s found one!” he exclaimed. He had his Invisibility Cloak in one hand and a small bottle in the other. “We’re going to get it.”
Sarah hesitated and looked toward Harry. The other boy also looked uneasy but told Ron what had happened in their detentions. Ron looked more ill with every word and once Harry had finished, he grabbed Sarah’s hand and looked at the matching lines on her skin.
“Yea’…” agreed Hagrid. He peered at them closely under thick, snow-flecked eyebrows. “Yeh sure yeh’re all righ’? Yeh look all hot an’ bothered – “
“What’re they all lookin’ at?” said Hagrid, as they approached, Fang following behind them. “Wha’s tha’, lyin’ on the grass?” Hagrid added sharply. “See it, Sarah? Righ’ at the foot o’ the tower? Under the Mark…Blimey…yeh don’ think someone got thrown – ?”
Even as she said it, Sarah felt the unnatural cold begin to steal over the street. Light was sucked from the environment right up to the stars, which vanished. In the pitch blackness, she felt Hermione take hold of her arm and together, they turned on the spot.
“Oh, bugger off,” Ron said in embarrassment, pushing Harry gently as they arrived at the common room.
“Maybe you’re doing it wrong?” suggested Draco. “He told you to take a bath with it – why don’t you try putting it in the water?”
The noise died quickly when the spectators noticed their small group standing near the message and the hanging cat.
Harry flew directly toward Sarah and stumbled off his broom as she dragged him into the medical tent. She ripped open his shirt sleeve as Madam Pomfrey hurried over with burn salve, potions and her wand and began to mend the nasty cut on Harry’s bicep.
“If I’d sprouted whiskers, I’d take a break from work,” said Ron, tipping a stack of books onto Hermione’s bedside table one evening.
“Okay,” Harry said aggressively to Hermione, “Okay, if you can think of a way of doing this quickly, I’m with you, otherwise I’m going to the Department of Mysteries right now – “
Sirius continued in a joyful voice, “In there is everything you’ll need to know about ins-and-outs of sex. If you’ve got any questions, just owl me. Although, I think I managed to cover everything.”
“Merlin, I can’t believe third year was the last time we flew for fun,” Sarah said, shaking her head slightly. “Very well, I’m sure I can give you some of my valuable time.”
Xenophilius did not answer. He kept swallowing, his eyes darting between the five of them. Sarah had the impression that he was undergoing some painful internal struggle.
Sarah inhaled sharply and continued to stare at Harry in silence. He grabbed her hand and held on tightly.
“My father wasn’t around much, so it was usually just my mother and me at home. When she died, a part of me died with her. If it weren’t for Draco and Narcissa – I don’t know what would have happened,” Sarah took a calming breath. “I haven’t been back home since her funeral – I couldn’t stand to walk through the hallways that echoed her voice or stand in the rooms she used to love.”
“He beat you!” yelled Ron, and the charm broke, and the defenders of Hogwarts were shouting and screaming again until a second, more powerful bang extinguished their voices once more.
“Just because my fiancé was a self-centred arsehat does not I’m not over it,” Pansy said roughly. “Merlin, Draco, it was nearly two years ago. I’ve moved on.”
Narcissa smiled warmly at Sarah. “It is for the best,” she said. “I have already told Andy and she and Ziara have offered to help me settle in. I’m sure you remember the estate in Marseille? Kingsley has kindly offered me the use of a long-distance Portkey.”
“I’m going to be the first to say it,” Sarah said as they made their way back up to the castle without Hagrid, “he’s crazy.”
“It’s because you love me and couldn’t imagine your life without me,” Lyra stated, smiling. “Look at all the entertainment I provide for you. Example A,” she added, gesturing toward Harry.
Ron snatched up the struggling rat, whose hair had fallen out in large patches, leaving large bald spots.
does that mean?” Pansy high-pitched shriek caused Draco to close his eyes and take another sip of fortifying tea.
!” The bone cracked into place and Neville winced. “Sorry about that but it’ll make it easier for you to cast.”
“I am sorry for your loss, Lyra,” she said sincerely. “I’m sorry you didn’t get to have a normal childhood and I’m sorry that your father let you get hurt.”
? He thought. Oh, Merlin. It wasn’t like he hadn’t thought about it before. His disastrous interactions with Cho and Ginny were a really big warning sign, as well as the unfortunate fact that Harry had never really been interested in girl talk.
She had barely finished her sentence when she heard loud footsteps running towards their group. They all looked up in shock as a tall, thin body appeared before them, lips grinning ear to ear.
“You always have low expectations,” Blaise commented. “It’s part of your endearing pessimistic nature.”
It wasn’t until he reached his room that he realised Lyra had followed him. He collapsed on top of his bed and let out a low groan as she stood snickering at him from the doorway.
“That’s what I told Ginny,” said Percy fiercely, “but she still seems to think you’re going to get expelled, I’ve never seen her so upset, crying her eyes out, you might think of
“S’all my fault. Got all tongue-tied. They were all sittin’ there in black robes an’ I kep’ droppin’ me notes and forgettin’ all them dates yeh looked up fer me. An’ then Lucius Malfoy stood up an’ said his bit, and the Committee jus’ did exac’ly what he told ‘em…”
Weasley’s face scrunched up in disgust. “No way, it’s too weird. I’ll accept that you want to change and need help but you’re still a cold-hearted bitch and your brother is a bigoted bastard.”
“Apparently, he found it odd that George was seen around Hogsmeade,” Hermione explained to a dumbstruck Lyra. “But then he said that George was probably there to see you. That was as far as he got, truthfully, I figured out the rest.”
The bell rang for the end of the lesson. Overhead and all around came the elephantine sounds of hundreds of students on the move. Sarah suddenly felt quite ill.
“Oh, I know that you’ll do whatever you want,” Fred assured. “This is purely my own self-preservation kicking in.”
She and Harry had lots of fun examining everything she learnt in Muggle Studies without Hermione’s critical explanations.
Sarah refused to talk about her nightmare which sent her running from Fred’s room four days ago. No matter how much Harry tried, he couldn’t get her to talk. He knew that Draco had been getting increasingly more and more worried about his friend – but she kept pretending she was fine. Fred had come up to Harry and asked if he knew anything. He didn’t. As a last resort, Harry had written a letter to Remus and Sirius, explaining the situation and asking for their help and advice.
She smiled into it and pulled away. “Nope!” she said brightly. “Slytherins only. We’ll see you guys tomorrow. Bonne nuit!”
“You don’t know anything!” he snapped. “I’m dating Draco because I fucking want to! It’s going to last a very long time if I have anything to say about it. I have no idea why you thought I’d want to be with you. I’ve wanted to date Draco for years! We literally made it as obvious as possible we were dating – and very happy!”
A few minutes later, a shark head burst out of the water. It shook itself and slowly morphed into Viktor’s head. He was holding Hermione above the water, her curly hair plastered to her face.
“Don’t be silly, Ron,” Sarah said with a smirk. “She’ll definitely kill you and the twins but Harry, Draco and I perfectly safe. A pureblood would never kill a guest in their own home.”
“You’ve been asking him every day,” Draco reminded her. “I’m sure he’ll come to us if he finds out anything.”
The moment her eyes fell upon Ron, all other concerns fled Sarah’s mind, for blood drenched the whole of Ron’s left side and his face stood out, greyish-white, against the leaf strewn earth. The Polyjuice Potion had fully worn off now and his freckled face was draining of what little colour it had left.
“Oh, I’ve just escaped – I mean, I’ve just left Cormac,” she said. “under the mistletoe,” she added in explanation, as Sarah continued to look questioningly at her.
“Nasty children making Kreacher be messenger…filthy half-breeds…Mistress would be so disappointed in her horrid spawn…” Kreacher muttered.
“There’s nowhere he could have gone,” Sirius argued. The others had settled around the table and were happily talking amongst themselves. “He’s tied to the family.”
Sarah pushed into Draco and Harry’s shared room to find Ron, Ginny and Draco sitting on the bed, the latter with his arms crossed and his eyes narrowed.
The weather could not have been more different on the journey back to King’s Cross than it had been on their way to Hogwarts the previous September. There wasn’t a single cloud in the sky. Draco said quietly beside Sarah in the compartment that he, Sarah, Harry, Ron and Hermione had gotten for themselves. Sarah knew he was thinking about the letter he had sent his mother, explaining that he would not be returning home to her this summer. Sarah squeezed his hand and he turned to her, sending her a thin-lipped smile before turning back to the window. Harry was on Sarah’s other side and she had refused to let go of him so far, hoping that if she didn’t, he would be forced to go to the Dursleys.
Sarah zoned out slightly as the twins began questioning Mr Weasley about what he was doing when he was attacked. She looked over again at the man who had been bitten by a werewolf and absentmindedly rubbed the left side of her neck, where the top of the scar she had gotten in her third year sat. Sometimes, she forgot she had it but every so often near the full moon, some of her senses would seem to improve. Nothing drastic, but occasionally she found that her hearing or sense of smell was more enhanced. She was just fortunate that Remus hadn’t accidently bitten her and merely swiped her with his claws. She knew he still felt guilty about the incident, it was evident whenever he caught sight of the scar as it peeked above her collar.
The scream was more terrible because she had never expected or dreamed that Professor McGonagall could make such a sound. She heard another woman laughing nearby, and knew that Bellatrix glorified in McGonagall’s despair.
“Have you spoken with him?” Sarah asked Harry after Draco left her for the library when Harry walked up to them after lunch.
“Draco’s welcome whenever he wants,” Harry told them, holding eye contact with Draco. “I’d like to see him more as well.”
“Upstairs, keep the Cloak on, keep quiet!” muttered a tall figure, passing them on his way into the street and slamming the door behind him.
“Do you think Crabbe is actually dumb enough to think it’s really Goyle and Theo?” Sarah asked, flopping comfortably onto Draco’s bed.
Draco immediately grabbed an ominous-looking tool and Sarah and Harry stepped away from the table as Draco and Hermione closed ranks on the pod. Harry looked incredibly deep in thought so Sarah elbowed him slightly, cocking her head at him in question. He shook his head and mouthed,
“The books on this level aren’t for sale,” Potter explained. They were in the middle of a cosy seating area on the second level. “People are allowed to read and browse but not buy. If they want a copy of something, I provide more recent editions. These are just too valuable to sell off.”
She had finally connected the dots on what Harry had been talking about. He thought that there may be a Horcrux in Bellatrix’s vault – that was why she had gotten so sacred at the Manor.
As she named each drink, she gave her short wand a wave and a cup or glass of it appeared upon her desk.
“No idea, we haven’t been allowed any visitors yet,” said Hermione. “Apparently, after our attacks, they closed off the hospital wing – didn’t want to take any chances.”
It was clear, as the three of them stepped back into the corridor upstairs, that in the minutes that they had spent in the Room of Requirement the situation within the castle had deteriorated severely: the walls and ceiling were shaking worse than ever; dust filled the air and through the nearest window Sarah saw bursts of green and red light so close to the foot of the castle that she knew the Death Eaters must be very near to entering the place. Looking down, Sarah saw Grawp the giant meandering past, swinging what looked like a stone gargoyle torn from the roof and roaring his displeasure.
“Er – right, anyway,” Harry said, eyeing the pair out of the corner of his eyes. “If no one has any problem with Draco, Sarah and I being in charge…? No? Excellent. And –
peeved off. Not snapping at everyone and pushing away your closest friends. I mean, have you even sat down a talked to Draco in the last few days? He’s been moping around the common room claiming that you barely give him the time of day.”
They had reached the hospital wing. Pushing open the doors, Sarah saw Neville lying, apparently asleep, in a bed near the door. Ron, Hermione, Luna, Ginny, George, Remus and Tonks were gathered around another bed near the far end of the ward. At the sound of the doors opening, they all looked up. Hermione ran to Sarah and hugged her; Remus moved forward too, looking anxious.
Sarah also made the effort to see Draco as much as she could. She had him over at Remus’ more often than not, but whenever his father was away, Narcissa would hole Sarah up in the Manor and discuss all the gossip she was missing. This allowed Sarah to see Blaise, Pansy, Theo and Millicent as well.
Fred looked extremely relieved when Sarah appeared beside them. He wrapped an arm around her waist and she leaned slightly into him.
Harry ran a hand through his thick curls. “I don’t want to just go run up to Draco and tell him I love him now.”
“Sorry to burst your bubble, Minister but I think I would recognise my father – particularly when he’s putting a curse on me,” Sarah interjected angrily.
“Sarah, that’s disgusting!” Harry shouted, covering her mouth with his hand. “I never want to hear you say something like that again.”
“Not until you talk to Remus and me,” Sirius said determinedly. “I saw you contemplating avoiding us.”
Lee passed Harry the egg, and Harry dug his fingernails into the groove that ran all the way around it and prised it open.
“I’m sorry, what did you say?” He tried to ignore the way Rosie’s eyes gleamed triumphantly as she repeated her question.
“That’s a horrible nickname,” Sarah stated. She noticed a group of first years gaping at them, one of their hands raised. “It’s rude to point,” she snapped at them. The boy who had his hand flushed a bright scarlet and scuttled away, bumping into multiple students as he went.
“Sleep well, Draco,” Harry said breathlessly. The other man’s lips were red and swollen and his hair was a mess. Harry thought he had never been more attractive.
“What is it?” Sarah said curiously, leaning forward to get a better look at the potion. Lupin, however, tipped the rest back before she could glimpse it, his face contorting in a grimace.
A low groan from beside Sarah indicated that Ron had just woken up. Harry and Hermione joined Draco on Sarah’s side of the ward and settled comfortably into chairs next to the two beds.
“Arthur’s done a bit o’ tinkerin’,” said Hagrid, seemingly oblivious to Harry’s discomfort as the boy squeezed himself into the small sidecar, Hedwig in her cage between his knees. Sarah rested an arm against Draco’s thestral as she listened to the conversation. “It’s got a few tricks up its handlebars now. Tha’ one was my idea.”
“What’s wrong, Harry?” Sarah asked after a few minutes of silence. “Something else is obviously eating at you.”
“Not really,” admitted Sarah. “I’d much rather eat ice-cream until I’m sick and then relax with you all in the lounge until we pass out.”
“Fancy a flutter on the match, Arthur?” Bagman said eagerly, turning away from them and back toward Mr Weasley.
“Here.” He shoved the small bottle into Sarah’s hands. It was his bottle of Felix Felicis. “All of you have a sip. I feel like you’ll need it tonight. I heard Crabbe celebrating in the Room of Requirement before I went to Dumbledore.”
“Be my Valentine,” Sarah trilled at Draco, holding a confetti heart and fluttering her eyelashes exaggeratedly.
But an hour later, Susan’s Splinching was still the most interesting thing that had happened. Twycross did not seem discouraged. Fastening his cloak at his neck, he merely said, “Until next Saturday, everybody, and do not forget:
“Mr Potter,” she said, her voice still slightly rough. “I believe it is to you whom I should express my gratitude.”
“Yeah, his school! It was his first real home, the place that meant he was special; it meant everything to him, and even after he left – “
“Snape went to school with us and hated us – much like you five and Mr Crabbe. One day, however, Sirius played a trick on him which nearly killed him…”
“I don’t know what would have happened if it hadn’t been for you, Harry,” she said in a muffled voice. “They might not have found Arthur for hours, and then it would have been too late, but thanks to you he’s alive and Dumbledore’s been able to think up a good cover story for Arthur being where he was, you’ve no idea the trouble he would have been in otherwise, look at poor Sturgis…”
Ron’s pained voice woke Harry up the next morning. He blinked away the grogginess and slowly tried to sit up. A disgruntled noise made him pause and look down.
“Us,” said Fred. “We take it in turns. George did the Fainting Fancies – we both tried the Nosebleed Nougat – “
“Draco, I hate to spoil the mood,” Sarah mumbled with a voice made croaky by pain. The blond turned to her in confusion. “But I’m going to pass out.”
Nearly all the females and even some males nodded in agreement and Lyra sat down with a smug smile. It faltered when a loud voice called from the Head Table:
Sarah looked toward the dozen boys and girls who had emerged from the carriage and were now standing behind Madame Maxime. Many of them had scarves covering their faces and heads as they shivered in their thin uniforms.
“I hate to say it, but I think she’s standing in her worst nightmare,” Lyra added in an emotionless voice.
“Why of course, good sir,” she replied, letting herself be led toward the dance floor. She shot a look over her shoulder to find Ginny and Fleur beaming at her and giving her the thumbs up.
“I believe they have been betting on us,” Draco observed, glaring at his sister again and receiving an unrepentant smirk in return.
“Well, if you’re going to have any chance of dating him then you’re going to have to put in some effort!” Rosie said hotly. “You may be walking eye candy but that doesn’t mean you’ll just get everyone you want.”
Potter thankfully took the bait and said, “It’s a book club I hold every week. I usually drop Teddy off at the Burrow but if Molly can’t take him, then I bring him here. The members love him,” he added with a large smile.
Sarah’s shout had attracted Draco’s attention. The blond boy appeared beside Fred with a concerned expression on his face.
“Sarah! Did you know that your mum locked my dad and Sirius in the Quidditch locker rooms and stole their robes?” Harry shouted over the heads of the other guests. “They had to run back up to Gryffindor Tower in just towels!”
“Thank you, Malfoy,” he said. “I – er – also wanted to apologise about yesterday again. I really didn’t mean to offend you. I was just curious.”
“I also got you the promised sweets,” he continued, lifting another bag and tipping it over, allowing a selection of sweets to fall to tumble out.
The flapping of enormous wings echoed across the black water: the dragon had drunk its fill and risen into the air. They paused in their preparations to watch it climb higher and higher, no black against the rapidly darkening sky, until it vanished over a nearby mountain. Hermione and Ron walked forward and took their places next to the other three. Harry pulled the Cloak down as far as it could go, and together, they turned on the spot into the crushing darkness.
“Probably not,” grinned Harry. He didn’t get time to say anything else before Mrs Weasley was ushering them out the front door was an exasperated look at Sirius.
“Where have you been?” he asked as soon as she had taken the seat beside him. “You missed all your lessons!”
Draco still hadn’t forgiven her for simply regrowing her hair a moment later, causing the twins to abandon Draco and officially hire her as their pranking assistant. Harry and Ron were still reeling from Sarah revealing she was a metamorphmagus but it was worth it.
Lyra barely paid them any attention, her focus instead on her brother, whose face had gained back some colour after Snape’s spell. His breathing was ragged and he was drifting in and out of unconsciousness.
Sarah didn’t wait a second longer; she reached up and grabbed Ron by the ear and began dragging him out of the Hall.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” said a slightly singsong voice, and with a slight shock, Sarah realised that the celebrant was the same small, tufty-haired wizard who had presided over Dumbledore’s funeral. “We are gathered here today to celebrate the union of two faithful souls…”
Losing his head, Harry tried to make a run for it, but the dwarf seized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor.
Sarah didn’t think that his instructions were enough to try to Apparate immediately. Judging from the nervous faces around her, she wasn’t the only one who thought so.
Pansy scowled. It was truly terrifying. “Well, Blaise and Theo paired up together, the wankers, and that leaves me with no one suitable who I can actually tolerate. I knew that you and Draco would be perfectly fine without partnering together because he’ll just go with his boyfriend and the other Gryffindors will schmoozy with each other.”
“Thanks Lyra,” Harry said happily. He pulled her into a quick hug and then bounced to his feet, disappearing from the Great Hall.
Neville spoke suddenly in a quiet voice, “Gran, stop.” His grandmother looked to him in surprise. “Draco had nothing to do with that. He’s my friend and so is Sarah. Please don’t be rude to them.”
“I heard a rumour that Harry beat your best at twelve,” Lyra said cheekily. “Anyone, we all know I would win. I’m the best Chaser here, maybe aside from Ginevra.”
It was an incredible sight. The dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly-white, translucent people, mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor, waltzing to the dreadful, quavering sound of thirty social saws, played by an orchestra on a raised, black-draped platform. A chandelier overhead blazed midnight-blue with a thousand more black candles. Their breath rose in a mist before them; it was like stepping into a freezer.
Sarah smirked broadly at Lee as she passed the busy counter and winked at Verity’s grin before exiting the store and Disapparating in a whirl of snow.
“Hello, Minister!” bellowed Percy, sending a neat jinx straight at Thicknesse, who dropped his wand and clawed at the front of his robes, apparently in awful discomfort. “Did I mention I’m resigning?”
Everyone listened to him and were soon disappearing into the upper levels of the Ministry. Mrs Cattermole, however, was refusing to leave Ron’s side.
“You might as well call me Hermione, if you’re calling Harry by his first name,” Granger stated, staring evenly at Lyra, who blinked in surprise.
Hermione squealed and hurried to break open the graffitied door beside them. Meanwhile, Draco turned to Sarah.
And fanart! I love visuals. If anyone knows someone who likes drawing fanart, please, please let me know!
Michael frowned slightly and went to grab his wrist. “Any chance I can get your number? Maybe we can do this again.”
“Darling, I have been with you nearly every second of your life, you cannot lie to me,” Lyra said flatly. “Now, the sooner you accept that your obsession – “ Draco glared fiercely at her and she sighed, “All right
“As long as I can get out of these clothes soon,” Sarah huffed as she gripped the other end of can. “Harry’s wardrobe really needs an update.”
“Then I’m going to the fucking back,” Sarah grumbled, crossing her arms over her chest. “Come on, Lee. I’ve got to babysit Teddy this afternoon and I’d at least like to let Fred know that I’m here.”
Sooooo this was just meant to be a cute little thing and I know it might feel slightly rushed in places but I really wanted to finish it before I lost all inspiration.
Despite Sarah’s conversation with Harry, he still hadn’t spoken to Hermione. Draco was getting more and more pissed off at the Gryffindor and had now begun to make his disapproval blatantly obvious.
George and Fred burst in laughter that echoed down the hallways. George pushed open the portrait hole after giving the password and led the way into the common room.
Malfoy turned and raised his wand, but Tonks had already sent a Stunning Spell right at him. Sarah did not wait to see whether it had made contact, but dived off the dais out of the way, dragging Harry with her. The Death Eaters were completed distracted by the appearance of the members of the Order, who were now raining spells down upon them as they jumped from step to step toward the sunken floor: through the darting bodies, the flashes of light, Sarah could see Neville crawling along. She dodged another jet of red light and flung herself flat on the ground to reach Neville, harry right behind her.
“I think Harry’s right,” Sarah confessed. “There’s no point in waiting much longer. I say we go and get that locket and then carry on with our jolly plan to kill the Dark wanker.”
Draco kissed Harry briefly before moving to the Slytherin table, sitting across from Sarah and Blaise.
Draco let a smile spread across his face as he watched Lyra gleefully tear down another strip of the hideous wallpaper covering one of the bedrooms at Grimmauld Place. The two months they had spent here had done them both good. They were no longer skeletal thin and pale, healthy colour had returned to their faces and they were able to stomach nearly three full meals. They had also been sleeping better, even since their mother had suggested seeing a Mind Healer to help deal with the lasting impacts of the Dementors. It had taken the combined efforts of Pansy, Blaise, his mother and Lyra to drag Draco to the appointment.
“Voldemort’s on his way, they’re barricading the school – Snape’s run for it – what are you doing here? How did you know?”
“Sarah, vat is going on? Vhy is Harry here?” Viktor asked, coming to stand beside them with a worried expression on his face.
Gryffindor had scored again causing them to pull ahead of Slytherin. But then Flint got the Quaffle and put it past Wood, evening the score again. Lee Jordan swore so badly that Professor McGonagall tried to tug the magical megaphone away from him.
“I have to ask though,” the older woman said, suddenly serious, “What did your father do that prompted you to run away?”
They had arrived at the edge of the maze. The stands were rising above them, shapes of people moving in them.
When they reached the top of the Astronomy Tower at eleven o’clock they found a perfect night for stargazing, cloudless and still. The grounds were bathed in silvery moonlight, and there was a slight chill in the air. Each of them set up his or her telescope and, when Professor Marchbanks gave the word, proceeded to fill in the blank star chart he or she had been given.
But she broke off as yells and shouts and the unmistakable noises of duelling filled the corridor. Sarah looked around and her heart seemed to fail: Death Eaters had penetrated Hogwarts. Fred, George and Percy had just backed into view, the three of them duelling masked and hooded men.
“That’s not true,” he said, rubbing the back of his neck. “You’re just saying that to make me feel better.”
“I can’t stand this,” Sarah announced suddenly. They had been sitting around the fire chatting for nearly an hour and still had heard nothing about Harry and Ron. “I’m going to Gryffindor.”
To her utter delight, a jet of light shot out of her wand and hit Pansy, who squealed and swore loudly, attracting the attention of Snape and the other students.
, that her father was expecting a lovely long article on recent sightings of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks. “And, of course, that’ll be a very important story, so yours might have to wait for the following issue,” said Luna. Sarah just shook her head at Fred when he went to ask.
“Apparently Mr Weasley ate some chocolates drugged with love potion, so Mr Potter took him to Professor Slughorn,” Madam Pomfrey explained.
She smiled widely at him and leant in closer to declare in a loud whisper, “It’s time to start our plan!”
,” Sarah said hastily, poking the pieces with her wand and the bowl sprang back together again. The crash, however, appeared to have awoken Ron and Hermione to the others’ presence. Hermione looked flustered and immediately started fussing about for her copy of
“That’s amazing!” squealed Sarah. “What was Fudge threatened with? Forced abdication? Abdominal disembowelment? Bowler hat banishment?”
Before Draco could reply, the tent flaps opened and Harry and Hermione walked in, smiling softly at each other. Draco squeezed Sarah’s arm once and then stood up from the bed, making his way across the room to draw Harry into a hug.
“Harry,” Sarah said seriously, looking directly into his green eyes. “You’ve been more worried about Draco’s feelings than you have mine or Hermione’s and Draco wasn’t even the person you wronged. I’m not an idiot, I can see you care about him.”
“There are still a large number of Death Eaters watching the house,” he told the others, “more than usual. It’s like they’re hoping we’ll march out carrying our school trunks and head off for the Hogwarts Express.”
“We’ll leave once Draco arrives at mine,” replied Remus, waving his wand and sending a butterbeer floating to Sarah and Fred. “Narcissa mentioned they would be over at two.”
“We saw a bunch of them in the common room last night…” Millicent said hesitantly. She heaved a sigh at Draco’s expectant look. “They’ve written a song,” she muttered. “It’s quite offensive actually.”
“Your mother is stubborn,” Pansy pointed out. “She’ll need a solid reason for why you shouldn’t marry and produce an heir. Perhaps like that fact that you’re as queer as they come…?”
“Harry, you prat,” said Draco, “you didn’t take that song thing seriously, did you? Dumbledore wouldn’t have let any of us drown!”
“No, Mr Weasley just said something about it being a favour…” Harry broke off as they were joined by Draco, Hermione, Ron, and Ginny.
“But what about the dementors?” Millicent countered. “They’re guarding every entrance to the grounds.”
They nearly fell over Ron; they skidded to a stop right in front of him. He was sprawled on the ground, but Scabbers was back in his pocket; he had both hands held tight over the quivering lump.
“Do you think they will?” Sarah asked tentatively. “A lot of them are going to be fighting their families.”
“You did it first,” he said cheekily, mouthing under her jaw. “And no one is really going to care about a golden retriever suddenly popping up at random places. People love dogs.”
boyfriend, on the other hand, was nowhere to be found. A frown formed as she scanned the crowd again, probably missing him in the excessive redheads.
Sarah went back to the Slytherin common room that night, having ignored Harry throughout dinner. Draco had joined them not long after, claiming, “I’m not attached to Harry’s hip. I can survive without him for a night.”
After the dementors had attacked him and his cousin Dudley the day before, Harry had been a constant state of horrified shock. He had no idea how two dementors had been in Little Whinging. All he knew was that, because he had used the Patronus Charm in front of a muggle, he was sentenced to a hearing in August to determine if he would be expelled from Hogwarts or not.
Pansy elbowed her suddenly and Lyra opened her eyes, not realising that she had closed them in the first place.
An hour later, Sarah tumbled out of the fireplace into The Burrow’s living room with the grace of a newborn giraffe. Ron’s laughing face greeted her as he helped her off the floor.
“I’m starving,” said Ron, stowing Pigwidgeon – the owl Sirius had given him – next to Hedwig and grabbing a Chocolate Frog.
you – !” Sarah said, preparing the stride forward, but Harry grabbed her arm and held her back. “They are
Harry looked confused for a moment before saying, “Er – because there are so many of us, it won’t know what shape it should be?”
“Besmirching – very nice,” she said as the old woman kept shrieking, “Can I recommend vitiate or putrefy?”
Sarah groaned pitifully. “At least I’ll have Draco beside me,” she said, fluttering her eyelashes at him.
“But he cannot now give testimony, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore. He was staring hard at Fudge, as though seeing him plainly for the first time. “He cannot give evidence about why he killed those people.”
She saw a flash of red light and knew that Umbridge had attempted to Stun one of them – then she screamed very loudly. Lifting her head a few inches, Sarah saw that Umbridge had been seized from behind by Bane and lifted high into the air, wriggling and yelling with fright. Her wand fell from her hand to the ground and Harry stretched out a hand toward it – but a centaur’s hoof descended upon the wand and it broke cleanly in half.
“Ah, but I’ve got special permission from Professor Snape to train our new Seeker and Chaser,” Flint said smugly.
Harry seemed to deflate slightly in front of him, some of the previous confidence and determination seeping out of him.
Sarah groaned and pushed herself out of the chair. As she walked slowly toward doors, Madam Pomfrey called out from behind her.
“Well,” said Professor Binns slowly, “yes, one could argue that, I suppose.” He peered at Sarah as though he had never seen a student properly before. “However, the legend of which you speak is such a very
“I honestly don’t know if he does,” Sarah said. “I think Blaise just emits so much sex appeal that you find yourself in bed with him without thinking too much about it.”
Dumbledore now took out his wand and tapped three times upon the top of the casket. The lib creaked slowly open. Dumbledore reached inside it and pulled out a large, roughly hewn wooden cup. It could have been entirely unremarkable had it not been full to the brim with dancing blue-white flames.
“I think that’s the record for the youngest kid to swear,” Charlie commented casually from the other end of the table. “Not surprising it’s Fred’s kid, really.”
.” She had been practising this spell for weeks and could finally do it when she was concentrating fully. It was meant to be done with eye contact but she wanted to see if she could do it when Harry was on the verge of sleep.
” was now permanently etched on the back of his hand, the letters stark white against his pale skin.
Ron looked ready to pass out as he mounted his Cleansweep Eleven. “Good luck!” cried a voice from the stands. Sarah looked around, half expecting to see Hermione, but it was Lavender Brown. Sarah winced as turned back to Ron, who looked extremely confident.
Sarah studied the man closely. “I don’t know why…” she muttered. “But he looks sort of familiar for some reason.”
Sarah prodded her neck and said calmly, “I do believe that’s a hickey.” She smirked at him. “You should be well acquainted with them, considering you have a fading one on your collarbone.”
“None at all, dearest,” Mrs Weasley gushed. “Why don’t you all go and wait in the living room? Dinner will be ready soon and we can all eat in the kitchen.”
Sarah nodded and walked to the door. Opening it, she found Harry, Draco, Hermione, Ginny, Fred and George waiting outside.
“Possibly,” Sarah agreed. “But I think it’s something else. Why would they need to change a schedule for something because it was starting to attract attention or suspicion?”
“As I was saying,” continued Voldemort, looking again at the tense faces of his followers, “I understand better now. I shall need, for instance, to borrow a wand from one of you before I go to kill Potter.”
“I do that every time. Oh, here she is,” Ron added, craning around in his seat to watch Hermione reentering the library. “And what in the name of Merlin’s most saggy Y fronts was that about?”
Draco, Ron and Hermione did not turn up for nearly an hour, by which the food trolley had already gone by. Sarah was busy trying to throw Bertie Botts Every Flavour Beans in Ginny’s mouth when the compartment door slid open and Draco stepped through.
Sarah didn’t think their group would be able to recover from the breakup. Already, Millicent had stopped spending time with them individually, believing that they all would support Pansy and not give her the time of day. She was wrong, Theo and Sarah still tried to talk to her but, admittedly, Blaise and Draco were less than fond of her at the moment.
The five of them spoke at the same time; Hermione, Draco and Sarah said, “the Cloak,” Ron said, “the wand,” and Harry said, “the stone.”
“Well, I stayed on that hill all day,” said Ron. “I kept hoping you’d appear. But when it started to get dark I knew I must have missed you, so I clicked the Deluminator again, the blue light came out and went inside me, and I Disapparated and arrived here in these woods. I still couldn’t see you, so I just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the end – and Harry did. Well, I saw the doe first, obviously.”
“Really?” said Snape, showing his first, faint sign of interest as he looked around at Harry. “Well, it doesn’t surprise me. Potter has never shown much inclination to follow school rules.”
Fred looked around at the assembled students, and at the silent, watchful crowd. His warm gaze held Sarah’s as he called out in a loud voice, “If anyone fancies buying a Portable Swamp, as demonstrated upstairs, come to number ninety-three, Diagon Alley – Weasley’s Wizards Wheezes. Our new premises!”
Fred was right. Mrs Weasley was on a warpath. She burst into the kitchen in a cloud of red hair and anxiety and ushered them all into motion. Despite the fact that Draco had already made Harry pack
“Merry Christmas!” said Dumbledore once they had sat down. “Crackers!” He enthusiastically offered the end of a large silver noisemaker to Snape, who took it reluctantly and tugged. With a bang like a gunshot, the cracker flew apart to reveal a large, pointed witch’s hat topped with a stuffed vulture.
Draco laughed and waved his hand, dismissively, “It’s okay, Hermione,” he said. “Severus and I just had a disagreement last year. I said that until he starts acting like an adult, I want nothing to do with me.” Harry gripped his hand tightly and smiled slightly at Draco. “So far I have yet to see any evidence of him trying,” Draco went on, smirking.
Draco’s face paled but he didn’t look surprised, we both had known that our father’s still believed in Voldemort’s rule. Sarah turned to face Sirius.
“Yes!” said Sarah, and the three of them joined the crowd spilling out of the stadium. Sarah couldn’t help but notice that Harry hadn’t let go of Draco’s hand yet, not that the blond seemed to be complaining about that.
Mrs Weasley had everyone up at dawn but somehow there was still a great deal to do. Ron and Harry still hadn’t finished packing despite Mrs Weasley and Sarah hounding after them the day before.
“I can always rely on you to make me feel valued,” Sarah smirked. “Also, look, Harry’s been drawn into conversation with Trelawny. I wonder how he managed that?”
“Well, you’ve got a funny way of showing it!” said Mrs Longbottom. “My son and his wife,” she said, turning haughtily to Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny, “were tortured into insanity by You-Know-Who’s followers.”
After they had assured Mrs Weasley that yes, they would indeed be completing the extra year at school, Sarah hugged Ron and Hermione goodbye before going back through the Floo and emerging into complete chaos.
“He desired her, that was all,” sneered Voldemort, “but when he had gone, he agreed that there were other women, and of purer blood, worthier of him – “
“I think I’ve heard enough,” he declared, getting to his feet. “I’m going to go home where I don’t have to listen to anyone tell me completely ludicrous allegations!”
Sarah struggled to control herself enough to sit against a large tree and not fall into the lake by accident. She wrapped her arms and cloak tighter around her as she stared unseeing into the water.
Sarah sighed in response and rested her head on Hermione’s shoulder. This morning had already been too much to handle with the limited sleep she had gotten and she soon fell into fitful bouts of sleep.
After the first dinner at The Burrow – which Draco was still adamant to believe was a complete disaster – Harry had successfully taken his partner over for a few more dinners, none of which had ended abruptly because of a work crisis.
“Ah,” Sarah nodded. “Well, Ronald, it’s your own fault for being a misogynistic wanker and demanding that Hermione comes to the Ball with you after wrongly believing that there was no possible way she could have gotten a date.”
Pansy’s shriek interrupted Sarah’s response and she felt herself suddenly being wrapped in a tight hug.
“Lyra, I really shouldn’t have said that about your parents,” Potter said quickly, raising one hand to drag it through his riotous hair. “It was unfair and rude – “
“I was talking more about Bellatrix,” Sarah said hesitantly. She wasn’t even surprised that Luna somehow guessed what had happened.
“Yep, even I’m going to call it there,” Sarah said, getting to her feet. “Enjoy shouting at each other about Blaise’s arse.”
Her grip on Pettigrew slackened and he dove, grabbing Snape’s wand and pointing it at Ron. There was a loud bang and Ron collapsed to the ground, taking Draco and Harry with him. Then Pettigrew began to shrink rapidly and soon the rat was disappearing into the night.
“But it must have been a Patronus!” Draco said. “Couldn’t you see who was casting it? Didn’t you see anyone? And it led you to the sword! I can’t believe this. How could you be so
Sarah knew what she meant. Most nights her dreams were filled with broken glass, rubble and a hole blown into the corridor wall, glassy brown eyes staring back at her as George lay unmoving –
Three weeks passed before anything remotely interesting happened. Sarah had spent her days chatting with Amanda, reading novels, finishing her homework and idly watching the pub’s patrons go about their day. She had received a frantic message from Draco saying that her father had been looking for her in a fury-driven hailstorm, and that it would be safer for her if she didn’t tell Draco where she was, as long as she was safe. Tibby had gnawed nervously on her bottom lip as she delivered Draco’s message but promised to relay to the blond that Sarah was safe and taken care of. Millicent, Pansy and Hermione had been in contact with her, offering their homes if she wanted but she had declined, not wanting to put her friends at risk of her father’s wrath. Sarah had managed to do all her school shopping when her Hogwarts letter arrived and was now increasingly looking forward to going back to school.
“Remus!” Pettigrew squeaked, turning to Lupin, writhing imploringly in front of him. “You don’t believe this…Wouldn’t Sirius have told you they’d changed the plan?”
“LIES!” screamed Bellatrix, shooting the curse again. Tremors were still coursing through Sarah’s limbs as Bellatrix cut her again.
They landed hard on a road in a silent neighbourhood. Identical houses sat in neat rows up and down the street, the blanket of night muffling inner activities.
“Ah, Potter,” she said crisply, as if she had been waiting for Harry. “You can tell us what’s going on.”
Remus glanced back just before he exited the door. “Try to get some sleep if you can,” he recommended. “If you aren’t, that’s okay. You can sleep on the train.”
Voldemort was in the centre of the battle, and he was striking and smiting all within reach. Sarah could see Draco’s unmistakable blond hair fighting toward him, his face set in terrible snarl.
Percy said, “As a school prefect – “ but Harry lost his temper. He pulled out his wand and shouted, “
It was another few minutes before Harry and the others appeared downstairs again. He merely caught Sarah’s eye and inclined his head toward the back door before disappearing with Draco, Ron and Hermione on his heels.
of what we could do but obviously I was wrong. Looks like all you’re good for is landing brothers in the Hospital Wing with slashed up chests!”
He was snapped out of his thoughts by Lyra sitting down heavily on his lap, causing him to groan slightly in discomfort.
Snape was looking murderous. Possibly Lockhart had noticed, because he said, “Enough demonstrating! I’m going to come amongst you now and put you all into pairs. Professor Snape, if you’d like to help me – “
“Thanks Pans,” Lyra said with a smile. “And if no one hires us, you can just sue them with all your legal expertise.”
She passed over the Hogwarts letter and sipped her tea as Harry scanned it, his bright emerald eyes widening slightly.
“I would usually threaten that if Fred doesn’t treat you right we’d kill him,” he said with a smile. “But I don’t think we’re going to need to worry about that.”
Sandwiches were being handed out when Mr Weasley pulled Harry off to the side, whispering urgently to him. Sarah looked to Hermione in confusion and she shrugged her shoulders, not knowing what it was about later.
“And what would you say, Royal, to those listeners who reply that in these dangerous times, it should be ‘wizard’s first’?” asked Lee.
“Have you made any progress on the mission Dumbledore gave you?” Remus asked. “I know you can’t tell me any details but are you sure you don’t want me to come along with you for protection?”
There was a great scrambling and jostling as people separated, banged into each other, and ordered others out of their space. The Heads of Houses moved among the students, marshalling them into position and breaking up arguments.
“Don’t give me that bullshit, Draco,” snapped Lyra. “I know you care less about the blood status business than you promote. And besides, what have our traditions actually given us? Matching tattoos that will haunt us for the rest of our lives?”
Immediately, her head cleared and she gasped in a great lungful of air, lurching forward into Madam Pomfrey’s waiting arms.
She took a step back and blinked back tears. It was not a Horcrux. Someone named R.A.B had stolen the real one. Harry crumpled the parchment in his hand as Fang began to howl behind them all.
“Well, I am a bit peeved about Hogsmeade but personally, I think this was better,” he replied with a smile. It dropped when he saw the confused look on Sarah’s face. “What?”
, all over the radio, they’re looking for you everywhere, all these rumours and mental stories, I knew I’d hear straight off if you were dead, you don’t know what it’s been like –
“I daresay that is his – er- eventual plan,” said Fudge evasively. “But we hope to catch Black long before that.”
Harry sighed deeply and stared miserably at the window from his uncomfortable seat in the library. He shifted for the hundredth time and fiddled aimlessly with his quill; the ink long dry from the tip. Glancing hopelessly at the pile of parchment in front of him, he sighed again.
They fell quiet as the teams walked onto the pitch to loud cheers and shouts. The Captains shook hands and then on Madam Hooch’s whistle, the teams rose into the air.
“Harry Potter – I – love – you – “ Draco said, separating each word with a sweet kiss on Harry’s face. “Even though you’re a sentimental Gryffindor fool” – Harry glared at him half-heartedly – “you have my heart and always will.”
“Yes, but you want to make sure he’s okay, too,” Sarah said, a small smirk making its way onto her face.
“Harry…no…don’t…” Sarah tried to whisper but her voice refused to work. She slumped back to the ground and tried to pull her way towards Cedric. She made it a few inches before Voldemort’s words halted her in her path.
“What do you think you’re playing at?” Justin shouted, looking terrified. Before Harry could reply, Justin had turned and stormed out of the hall.
A jet of red light hit the nearest Death Eater; he fell backwards into a grandfather clock and knocked it over. The second Death Eater, however, had leapt aside to avoid Harry’s spell and now pointed his own wand at Sarah, who had crawled out from under the desk to get a better aim.
“It’s because I don’t want to see you lonely this year!” Lyra said dramatically. “You need a good shag and cuddle and I think Harry can give you that.”
“Never underestimate my little brother’s support of the Cannons,” he said wisely. “George and I never understood how he did it. They’re absolutely atrocious.”
After a few hours, Madam Pomfrey told her to sit down while she gathered some potions for Draco. Sarah collapsed into the seat beside his bed and fought back tears. She had never seen him so pale – he had nearly died. She had no idea how Harry had done this.
And then a deep, booming gong sounded somewhere beyond the woods, and at once, green and red lanterns blazed into life in the trees, lighting a path to the field.
“And Dumbledore believed that?” said Sirius incredulously. “Dumbledore believed Snape was sorry James was dead? Snape
“Oh yes…” Lucius turned toward his son and sneered. “My own son chooses to associate with these…” He turned toward the Granger’s behind them. “…
It was shrinking very fast, growing balder and balder, the black hair and stubble retracting into his skull, his cheeks smooth, his skull round and covered with a peachlike fuzz…
Suddenly, a spell hit the man holding her and she fell from his grasp. She looked up to see Draco leaning heavily against the doorway into the room, his arm falling limply to his side, wand clasped tight. Sarah straightened and sent a Stunner at the Death Eater, who collapsed to the ground. She looked around and saw that Harry and Neville were still struggling against Neville’s dancing legs.
“I’m not leaving him,” she said, staring at Fred, who was still kneeling above his brother’s body, face slack with grief.
She didn’t reply and pulled him until they were on the grounds by the castle steps. It was only then that she released him.
Severus growled and pushed them through the entrance to the tower, a strange barrier tickling their skin.
A cloud shifted. There were suddenly dim shadows on the ground. Their party was bathed in moonlight.
“Potter, Weasley! There you are,” she said sternly. “You will both do your detentions this evening.”
“But then, Potter, Dumbledore as good as gave me the wand!” Voldemort’s voice shook with malicious pleasure. “I stole the wand from its last master’s tomb!”
Another figure was emerging from the wand, and Sarah already knew who it was going to be before she saw them. Long, dark red hair spilt out before a slim body followed. The figure straightened and smiled at her son, green eyes sparkling in the golden light. Sarah looked at Harry’s face, a picture of devastation and longing. His mother stood to one side of him, her mouth moving quickly as she explained something to him. Harry’s father began blossoming from the end of the wand: tall and untidy-haired just like Harry. He walked close to Harry and reached his smoky hand out as if to touch his shoulder.
“Listen to him,” said the Healer, taking Lockhart’s arm and beaming fondly at him as though he were a precious two-year-old. “He was rather well known a few years ago; we very much hope that this liking for giving autographs is a sign that his memory might be coming back a little bit. Will you step this way? He’s in a closed ward, you know, he must have slipped out while I was bringing in the Christmas presents, the door’s usually kept locked…not that he’s dangerous! But,” she lowered her voice to a whisper, “bit of a danger to himself, bless him…Doesn’t know who he is, you see, wanders off and can’t remember how to get back…It
Unsurprisingly, a timeout was soon called. Sarah turned to see that Draco had disappeared from her and instead, the shock of distinctive platinum hair was down on the field near the Gryffindor team. When the players went back to the air, Draco sidled beside her, shivering because he hadn’t cast the Umbrella charm on himself.
“Hermione and Ginny, you’re in this one,” he said, opening the first door. “Fred and George, you’re the next room and Ron, you’re the one opposite them.”
“Right,” she said, twisting her hands together and pacing up and down between the desks. “Right…well…One of us has to go and find Umbridge and – and send her off in the wrong direction, keep her away from her office. They could tell her – I don’t know – that Peeves is up to something awful as usual…”
She clamped her jaw shut and tried to push down the smug smile that was tugging at the corner of her lips.
Sarah and Goyle both jumped as a voice issued close to them. Goyle pushed Sarah gently back the way she came.
“Same to you,” said the Fat Lady with a roguish grin. “Do you two ever stay in your own common room?” she asked Sarah and Draco.
“Mistress Sarah is being back!” squeaked Daisy delightedly. “And she had friends. How can Daisy be helping?”
“Harry, how lovely to see you again,” Luna said, smiling softly at them. “Hello again, Draco. Where’s Lyra?”
“Our plan for you to seduce Harry, remember?” Lyra said, frowning slightly. “Step one: sit together.”
“That was very Slytherin of you, Potter,” Draco drawled, dropping down to sit on Harry’s lap, his legs straddling the other boy’s hips. Harry’s arms came up to wrap around Draco’s waist, holding his securely.
Sarah was still struggling to get the image of Theo and Blaise using their teeth to remove each other’s ties until Theo finally managed it, causing Blaise to fall backwards off the bed.
“I can’t find Draco,” she blurted out. “I was with him in the Hall but then we got separated and I can’t find him!”
“Second addition, Miss Deaumont?” she said. “I believe you are mistaken. Mr Slinkhard has written only one book on Defensive Magical Theory.”
“And what if they suddenly decide we’re not worth it anymore?” Draco asked. “What then, Lyra? Blaise and Pansy and Theo and Millie are all counting on us to help protect them. What happens if we can’t?”
Sarah awoke to bright sunlight slanting across the bed and the comforting sounds of customers and workers bustling away downstairs. She sat up and stretched, eyeing the clock on the wall to see that it was just past midday. Her stomach grumbled loudly, so she got up, threw on some clothes and idly wandered down to the main level of the pub.
Sarah nodded along to his words, getting excited at the challenge. “That’s what I’ve been trying to figure out. I think it might be using the pipes to travel – that’s the only explanation as to how Harry heard it in the walls – unless Hogwarts’ walls are actually hollow….?”
Lupin’s office door was open. He had already packed most of his things. The grindylow’s empty tank stood next to his battered old suitcase, which was open and nearly full. Lupin was bending over something on his desk and looked up only when Sarah knocked on the door.
Hermione slid off the desk. The little flock of golden birds continued to twitter in circles around her head so that she looked like a strange, feathery model of the solar system.
But when Draco moved, Bathilda shook her head with surprising vigour, once more pointing first at Harry, then to herself.
They were soon caught up in the crowds now flooding out of the stadium. Raucous singing was borne toward them on the night-air as they retraced their steps back to the tents. Once they arrived, they all crowded into the boy’s tent, grabbing cups of hot chocolate and recounting various aspects of the game.
Ron’s euphoria at helping Gryffindor scrap the Quidditch Cup was such that he could not settle to anything the next day. All he wanted to do was talk about the match and Sarah could see Harry and Hermione slowly crumbling under the guilt of having not seen it. It was only when the five of them were sitting under the beech tree on the edge of the lake that Sarah was finally able to broach the topic.
Black’s eyes were fixed on Harry, whose face had lost all its colour. Draco’s fists were clasped tightly by his side and his silver eyes were wide. He was barely breathing.
“Something is definitely wrong,” she said in a furious whisper. “Why won’t she speak? If she knows it’s us and Dumbledore
A shout echoed down the vast hallway and Sarah ducked as another jet of light flashed past her, smashing into the wall and leaving a charred hole behind. She swore under her breath and veered right into a large study; complete with wall to ceiling bookcases, plush wingback armchairs, and dark wood tables strategically placed around the sprawling carpet. Her destination was the domineering, marble-mantled fireplace which took up most of the far wall. She sprinted toward it as she heard her pursuer stumble into the outside wall, the tight turn too difficult for their less agile body.
“Lee, stop being a dickhead and let her up,” Verity said sternly, “or I’ll cut your lunch break short.”
Ron slammed the door behind him and demanded, “What happened in there, mate? You just suddenly collapsed.”
“Well, all our champions are ready for the second task, which will start on my whistle. They have precisely an hour to recover what has been taken from them. On the count of three, then. One…two…
When she finished, she slumped back against Fred’s chest, shivering slightly. Her face was wet with tears and a cold sheen of sweat covered her body.
Hermione smiled brightly and then turned to the Slytherins. She hesitated for a moment before hugging Lyra tightly.
“They’re all about Voldemort,” she said. “Regulus seems to have been a fan for a few years before he joined the Death Eaters…”
By half past five it was growing dark, and the trio decided it was time to get back up to the castle for the Halloween feast – and, more important, the announcement of the school champions.
Mrs Weasley burst into tears. She ran forwards, pushed Fred aside and pulled Percy into a strangling hug, while he patted her on the back, his eyes on his father.
“The horses – they’re pulling the carriages – “ he said, sounding slightly frantic. “Can’t – can’t you see them?”
“All right,” Sarah stated. “Split into groups. I want Keepers over there, Beaters here, Chasers go there. Now, you’re going to be running some drills. I’ve called in some help to see what you’re made of.” She smirked as Ginny, Harry, Katie Bell, Draco, and Ron stepped up behind her. “Don’t let their appearance fool you, they’re quite nasty when they want to be.”
She tugged on their arms until they eventually gave in and sank into seats beside Ginny. Sarah perched on the arm of Fred’s chair and held one of his hands in hers. Her other one softly brushed through his hair.
“That was so cool, Sarah,” whispered Draco. He couldn’t say anymore because, at that moment, Harry slid into the seat on his other side, uttering a strained greeting to the pair.
Draco and Lyra didn’t hesitate and immediately arose from the couch, standing close together as they followed their father in silence to the drawing room. Lyra drew in a sharp breath as they saw the scene before them.
Sarah jolted awake to the sound of Fred’s voice. She raised her head from where it had been resting on Draco’s shoulder and saw that they were gradually getting closer to the ground.
But no one else cared that Professor Lupin’s robes were patched and frayed. His next lessons were just as interesting as the first. After boggarts, they studied Red Caps, nasty little goblinlike creatures that lurked wherever there had been bloodshed; in the dungeons of castles and the potholes of deserted battlefields, waiting to bludgeon those who had gotten lost. From Red Caps they moved on to kappas, creepy water-dwellers that looked like scaly monkeys, with webbed hands itching to strangle unwitting waders in their ponds.
Another reason was that Draco and she could do whatever they wanted. Sure, they were granted freedom at the Manor but they still had to act like proper purebloods. Here, they were able to run around widely or wrestle in the mud without anyone looking twice. The first time Sarah had seen Draco covered head-to-toe in mud after a particularly competitive tussle between Harry, Ron and the twins, she had collapsed into uncontrollable fits of laughter, barely able to draw enough breath to take a photo using Mrs Weasley’s camera.
“Careful not to walk through anyone,” said Draco nervously. They set off around the edge of the dance floor. They passed a group of gloomy nuns, a ragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, the cheerful Hufflepuff ghost, who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead. Sarah wasn’t surprised to see the Bloody Baron, a gaunt, staring Slytherin ghost covered in silver bloodstains. He sometimes appeared in the common room in an attempt to scare the students.
“This is nothing,” Neville dismissed his injuries with a shake of his head and tried to dodge Sarah’s wand. “Seamus is worse. You’ll see. Sarah – stop – ah! Shall we get going, then? Oh,” he turned to Aberforth, “Ab, there might be a couple more people on the way.”
“You see the numerals around the edge of the coins?” Hermione said, holding up one for examination at the end of their D.A meeting that night. “On real Galleons that’s just a serial number referring to the goblin who cast the coin. On these fake coins, though, the numbers will change to reflect the time and date of the next meeting.”
“Broomstick and Christmas, darling,” Sarah corrected, smoothing back Teddy’s hair, which had changed to match the dirty-blond curls that Sarah was sporting today.
Sarah’s stomach turned as the spider leapt from Moody’s hand on a fine thread of silk and began to swing backwards and forward as though on a trapeze. It stretched its leg out rigidly, then did a backflip, breaking the thread and landing on the desk, where it began to cartwheel in circles. Moody raised his wand and the spider rose onto two of its hind legs and went into what was unmistakeably a tap dance.
“They’re not children, Molly!” Sirius practically growled. “They’re nearly adults. They should be treated as such.”
Harry’s scores were released and Sarah was elated to see that he tied in first place with Viktor. Charlie Weasley made his way over to them and clapped Harry firmly on the shoulder.
There was one memorable occasion in at the end of July where a young woman with bubble-gum pink hair had tripped over the troll foot umbrella stand next to the door and crashed straight into Draco, taking them both tumbling to the floor.
Sarah couldn’t bring herself to repeat what Ernie and the Hufflepuffs had said, and neither could Harry it seemed.
“Because I thought – and Professor McGonagall agrees with me – that that broom was probably sent to Harry by Sirius Black!”
Sarah didn’t know how long they stayed like that. Madam Pomfrey came over at one point to take Remus away to put monitoring charms on him but still Sarah and Sirius did not move.
Sarah, Draco and Hermione’s last exam was Muggle Studies. They waved goodbye to the Gryffindor boys before heading to the first floor. The exam went quickly – Sarah was thinking too much about Buckbeak to really focus on what she was writing. When it finally ended, the three of them raced up to Gryffindor Tower. Ron and Harry hadn’t yet returned from their exam so they sat in a corner, talking in harsh whispers. They were interrupted by pecking at the window. A school owl was standing proudly on the windowsill. Draco let the owl in and accepted the letter tied to its leg. He scanned through it quickly before dropping it to the table.
Sarah glanced around. “Where’s Pans and Mill?” she asked. Blaise stiffened slightly and glanced at Theo, who had raised his head from where it had been bent over a piece of parchment.
“It’s a long story – involves a house-elf – Can you tell Hogwarts that the Dursleys have locked me up and won’t let me back? Obviously, I can’t magic myself out, because the Ministry’ll think that’s the second spell I’ve done in three days, so – “
Ron was blinking in surprise behind them all and awkwardly cleared his throat once Harry and Draco had separated.
“Is it, already?” said Luna vaguely. “Oh, look! The Gryffindor Keeper’s got hold of one of the Beater’s bats.”
George shrugged unapologetically. “True. But I won’t always be able to get away from work to meet you wherever you end up.”
Sarah looked up at the stars still glimmering palely in the dark sky and wished that they were doing anything else rather than what they had planned. Harry, Draco and Ron were waiting next to Dobby’s grave with Griphook. They all cringed slightly when they saw Sarah and Hermione.
“That’s Potter-Malfoy, love,” Draco commented from beside Harry, completely unconcerned for his husband’s future.
Teddy nodded and hummed in agreement. “Yup! Harry bought some books off her and said that she was Grandma’s sister. Then when we met you, I asked Grandma why no one told me I had such a cool cousin and she said that Harry wasn’t very friendly with you. I think she was wrong because Harry really likes you. He always gets this happy face on whenever he sees you.”
“You called the locket ‘Master Regulus’s’,” said Harry. “Why? Where did it come from? What did Regulus have to do with it? Kreacher, sit up and tell me everything you know about the locket, and everything Regulus had to do with it!”
“No thank you, dear,” Mrs Weasley said warmly. “You just sit down with the others now. Dinner is nearly ready.”
“Yep,” George said, grinning at her. He put on a high-pitched squeak and imitated a house-elf. “Anything we can get you, sir, anything at all!’ They’re dead helpful…get me a roast ox if I said I was peckish.”
“Where?” Lyra said as they left a dumbfounded Blaise and Pansy in the common room. The dungeons were quiet around them but Lyra thought she heard the distant sound of shouting. “Severus, what about Harry – Dumbledore?”
what you have a problem with?” Callisto scoffed, flicking the long blond hair she had inherited from her mother and uncle over her shoulder. She turned to her twin, “Ori, thank Merlin we got the smarts of the family.”
Fred didn’t hesitate. He grabbed Sarah’s arm and tugged her down the corridor, As they turned the corner and entered one of the passages behind a tapestry, Sarah heard a voice call, “Greg! Did you find anyone?”
“There,” she said, handing it to him. “Drink it before it gets cold, won’t you? Well, now, Mr Potter…I thought we ought to have a little chat, after the distressing events of last night.”
“I have been crystal gazing, Headmaster,” said Professor Trelawny in a misty, faraway voice. Sarah hadn’t even noticed her enter. “And to my astonishment, I saw myself abandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join you. Who am I to refuse the promptings of fate. I at once hastened from my tower, and I do beg you forgive my lateness…”
“As you will all be aware after their search of the Hogwarts Express, our school is presently playing host to some of the dementors of Azkaban, who are here on Ministry of Magic business.”
A jet of red light had shot from the end of Bellatrix Lestrange’s wand, but Malfoy had deflected it. His spell caused hers to hit the shelf a foot to the left of Sarah and several of the glass orbs there shattered.
She nodded and hugged them both distractedly. Tonks clapped them both on the shoulders and winked. Sirius jumped up licked them both on the faces, causing both boys to grimace and swat him away.
Ron’s prediction came true within hours. Shortly before lunch, Mrs Weasley detached Harry from the others and the pair disappeared into the house.
“You’re a horrid nuisance!” Draco laughed and successfully grabbed Lyra’s hands, securing them against their bodies. “I’m sorry you said you could pass as a boy.”
Dumbledore looked as if he wanted to counter her but a quick look around the room showed he was outnumbered.
Lyra tightened her grip on Draco’s hand and exchanged a worried glance with Blaise as they all came to a halt on the steps leading to the entrance hall. A large group of Death Eaters stood before them, black robes standing in stark contrast to the morning sunlight creeping over the forest. Lyra caught sight of the blond heads of her parents but refused to catch their eye. Instead, she looked toward the front of the group and felt herself gasp.
“Follow me,” Sarah said after they had left the office. “I have something that will help with the pain.”
After a few more hours, Fred appeared and convinced them all to stop studying and to come join him, George, Lee and Ron in a snowball fight outside.
By the lights of the few fires that were still burning, Sarah could see people running away into the woods, fleeing something that was moving across the field toward them, something that was emitting odd flashes of light and noises like gunfire. Loud jeering, roars of laughter, and drunken yells were drifting toward them; then came a burst of strong green light, which illuminated the scene.
“These have been great,” said Neville, beaming at Hermione and Draco. “The Carrows never rumbled how we were communicating, it drove them mad. We used out at night and put graffiti on the walls:
, will get hurt and neither of us want that.” Lyra said all of this quite quickly and shut her mouth with a snap before she said too much and embarrassed herself.
,” he murmured. “And I was planning to make a big deal of telling you and you go ahead and do this.”
“I think we need to try to clean the house more,” Sirius commented as they munched on Thai. “It’s horrible to look at and it seems more people are going to be popping in over the summer.”
Draco looked completely unfazed by the deluge of questions hurtled at him. He sat down his fork and wiped his mouth on the napkin beside his plate.
Madam Pomfrey nodded. “You’re already much further ahead than I thought you’d be, even with all the disruptions of last year. You deserve a break.”
“I’m not wearing these,” Draco said in disgust, vanishing the badges. “Do any of you know what they’re planning?” he asked the others.
It took Harry a few days to convince Draco it was a good idea to go to Godric’s Hollow. Sarah had explained it to Hermione the same day when she took over watch, and Hermione had been eager to go, some light finally returning to her dark eyes.
Teddy’s bright head appeared from the backyard and flung itself at Draco. Belatedly, he pressed an arm to the boy’s back, returning the hug.
“With any luck, they’ll have got away,” said Sarah, clutching her hot mug for comfort and burrowing deeper into Harry’s side. “As long as they got to their families okay, they should be fleeing the country now.”
In the depts of Sarah’s grief-filled brain, she realised that that must have been what the ghostly figure of Cedric had said to Harry when he appeared from the wand.
Hermione worried her lip. “I mean, we’re not learning anything in class. We’ll never pass our O.W.L.s at this rate. We need to teach ourselves another way.”
“Anyway, we’re off,” Fred announced, dropping a kiss to Sarah’s head. “Good luck for tomorrow, Harry.”
“Similar reasons,” said the higher-voiced goblin. “Gringotts is no longer under the sole control of my race. I recognise no Wizarding master.”
Homework had increased as the holidays slowly grew closer, but so had Quidditch practice, as the first match was rearing its head, taunting the teams.
“I don’t want anyone else to try to help,” Harry said loudly as Sarah, Draco and Narcissa pushed their way to the front of the crowd. In the total silence, his voice carried like a trumpet call. “It’s got to be like this. It’s got to be me.”
“Yeah, it is weird,” said Harry. “And you’d think Scrimgeour would have recognised it. He was Minister, he ought to have been an expert on Dark stuff.”
“That’s not the point!” Draco said shrilly. “My family has hated theirs for generations. Oh merlin, this was a bad idea. I can’t do it now – “
“I think you’re overthinking it,” she commented. “Where did all that Gryffindor courage disappear to?”
She rushed forward and slung herself through the gap in the roots. She slid down an earthy slope and found herself in a very low tunnel. Seconds later she was joined by Draco, then Harry, and finally Hermione.
“ – And Stevens didn’t even see the Snitch even though it nearly flew up his nose. It wasn’t a surprise that Rogers caught it before him. Honestly, it was so bad that even Ron couldn’t put a positive spin on it. They lost by nearly six hundred points; apparently it’s a new record…”
“We might as well get it done while we wait,” he pointed out, promptly throwing Sarah’s Transfiguration textbook at her head.
“I think Hermione will have the most difficulty,” Draco commented lightly, causing Sarah to stop glaring at Ron. “Pretending to be my mother is no easy thing.”
“Of course not.” It was her turn to scoff now. “Dumbledore was a secretive old man and I’ve always thought you put too much faith in him. But maybe I was biased,” she admitted. “I will readily admit that he used you, Harry. He gave you the support you needed at eleven and he exploited it. He made you feel special, important – and you
And with a movement like a serve, she heaved another enormous crystal sphere from her bag, waved her wand through the air, and caused the ball to speed across the hall and smash through a window. At the same time, the heavy wooden front doors burst open, and more of the gigantic spiders forced their way into the entrance hall.
“Just put them on, Archie, there’s a good chap. You can’t walk around like that, the muggle at the gate’s already getting suspicious – “
“Mum’s right, Ginny,” said Bill gently. “You can’t do this. Everyone under-age will have to leave, it’s only right.”
Harry leaned over him and said to Teddy, “Of course Draco is coming back with us. He hasn’t finished reading you that book yet.”
“I need you to hold her down as I do some diagnostics!” The wind was getting louder so Sarah raised her voice even more. Despite that, Leanne nodded and gripped Katie’s arms, sitting on her legs to keep her still.
She turned a dark glare on Ron and said very softly, “I think it would be smart to leave now, Ron. And don’t talk to
she added, pointing her wand at the misshapen canvas, which in one fluid motion, rose into the air and settled, fully constructed onto the ground before Harry, out of whose startled hands a tent peg soared, to land with a final thud at the end of a rope.
She had to turn her attention back to the front of the Hall when the first years entered but throughout the sorting and following feast, her mind was whirling, thinking of all the possibilities as to why her friends had not arrived.
Sarah opened her eyes. For a moment, she was blinded by bright lights and soon realised they were surrounded by people.
“I’ve got food,” said Aberforth, and he sloped out of the room, reappearing moments later with a large loaf of bread, some cheese and a pewter jug of mead, which he set upon the small table in front of the fire. Ravenous, they ate and drank, and for a while there was silence but for the crackle of the fire, the clink of goblets and the sound of chewing.
“How on earth can you write that much?” he exclaimed quietly, eyes darting around for the hawkish librarian, Madam Pinch.
“Mrs Weasley…” Sarah said hesitantly, glancing at the door and wondering if it was worth making a run for it. “I think you need to look at it from another perspective…”
“Nevermind that now,” snapped Bellatrix. “Look what they’ve got for us.” She crept closer to Dumbledore and cackled as he slid slightly lower against the railing, his face losing more colour. “Look at the old man – they’ve already managed to take his wand.”
“A bit over the top, but it’ll do,” Sarah muttered as door after door flew open along the corridor and people flooded out. Harry was practically hyperventilating beside her so she grabbed his hand and gripped it tightly. She spotted Professor McGonagall’s hat in the crowd and shouted over the noise, “PROFESSOR! PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL!”
?” Sarah gasped, staring at the Minister in shock. “Why was I there? I was there because my good-for-nothing father came and kidnapped me off school grounds and apparated us directly to the bloody graveyard,” fumed Sarah. “
“The Ministry has managed to stop them,” she said, a slight note of relief evident in her tone. “We need to get you back the Weasley’s tent before Lucius gets back.”
They entered the hall and there were Death Eaters everywhere Sarah looked: Yaxley, close to the front doors, in combat with Flitwick, a masked Death Eater duelling Kingsley right beside them. Students ran in every direction, some carrying or dragging injured friends. Sarah directed a Stunning Spell towards the masked Death Eater, it missed but nearly hit Neville, who had emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls of Venomous Tentacula, which looped itself happily around the nearest Death Eater and began reeling him in.
Too soon, it was time for the journey home on the Hogwarts Express. Sarah and Draco had chosen a compartment with Blaise, Pansy, Theo and Millicent, giving the Slytherins a chance to catch up.
Sarah rounded on the other girl. “Would you call getting poisoned interesting?” she said sharply. “I’ve got to go,” she added before Lavender could respond.
“We’ve got it,” Draco whispered, his blond head close to Harry’s. He held out his hand. In it was a pile of fake golden Galleons.
“Why can’t Hermione and Ron help run it though?” Sarah added. “It was Hermione’s idea in the first place.”
cloak of invisibility, Mr Malfoy! I mean to say, it is not a travelling cloak imbued with a Disillusionment Charm, or carrying a Bedazzling Hex, or else woven from Demiguise hair, which will hide one initially but fade with the years until it turns opaque. We are talking about a cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it. How many cloaks you have ever seen like
“Well, if all five of us go, we’ll have to Disapparate separately,” Ron was saying. “We can’t all fit under the Cloak anymore.”
“I’m starting to rethink my opinion of Moody,” Fred said sourly, “after the way he treated you and Draco.”
“It’s an old illness from childhood,” Lupin explained. “Sometimes it causes issues and this is the only thing that vaguely helps.”
“SARAH! HARRY!” Draco’s terrified voice cut through the daze in Sarah’s brain and she registered him forcing his way through the crowd, Ron, Hermione and Remus following quickly on his heels. Sarah’s heart shattered when she looked at him, the ghostly face of her mother reappearing in her mind.
“I’ll be with Dumbledore, I’ll be fine,” Harry panted, rummaging through his trunk and pulling out the Marauder’s Map. “Keep an eye on the Map.”
It was chilly and the moon was still out. Only a dull, greenish tinge along the horizon to their right showed that daybreak was drawing closer. Sarah was walking beside Fred, whispering to him soothingly and holding his hand tight. When she began to shiver more intensely, he reached into his rucksack and pulled out an overlarge sweater for her.
“Harry…Where’s Harry?” Sarah muttered weakly, trying to see over Draco’s shoulder at where Harry had disappeared.
She smiled prettily up at him. “Please, Draco. Call me Hermione. And anyway, it’s Granger-Weasley now, which is a bit of a mouthful.”
“Don’t be stupid, it wasn’t your fault! It anything, it was mine…” Harry said. He put his hand in his pocket and drew out Mad-Eye’s eye. They all recoiled, looking horrified.
“Detention, Potter – every Saturday until the end of the year. And fifty points from Gryffindor,” Professor Snape barked. “I’ll be talking to Professor McGonagall about a more severe punishment.”
Lyra nodded in agreement and focused on getting down without falling, but her foot slipped and she fell off her branch. Before she could do more than suck in a startled breath, hands wrapped around her and pulled her tight against a solid chest.
Harry watched in delighted awe as Sarah walked toward the end of the aisle, her arm linked tightly through Remus’s, a lovely melodic tune swirling around the open space. Her long auburn hair was loose down her back, delicate white flowers interwoven in a complicated pattern Harry was sure Luna was responsible for. Her dress hugged her figure and fell to the floor in a simple, soft waterfall of ivory fabric, silk detailing glimmering slightly in the sparkling lights shining above them all.
establishment. I feel as if I stepped back through time and emerged in a viscount’s library where all that awaited me was freshly pressed pages and ravishing sex.”
“Do you have anything you want to add, Draco?” she asked the blond beside her, who had remained silent for the entire conversation.
“I know,” Sarah said miserably. “But we can’t change that. We have to move on and prove that we’re better than our families.”
, 1998. The trial for Draco Lucius Malfoy and Lyra Evangeline Malfoy is about to commence,” Kingsley’s deep voice boomed. “They are accused of being Marked Death Eaters, active participants in the murder of Albus Dumbledore, and charged with various other accounts of terrorism, torture and murder.”
“You didn’t miss much,” Blaise said. “Mainly Slughorn rambled on about familial connections and talents. It was extremely disconcerting.”
He was sitting comfortably behind Harry, hands wrapped tightly around the other boy’s waist. Draco’s eyes were tightly closed and his head was pressed against Harry’s back.
The rest of the final term passed in a haze of blinding sunshine. Hogwarts was back to normal with only a few, small differences. Defense Against the Dark Arts classes was cancelled (“but we’ve had plenty of practice at that anyway,” Ron told a disgruntled Hermione) and Lucius Malfoy had been sacked as a school governor. Draco was happy about this but was also slightly nervous about his father’s reaction when he got home (“You’ll be fine love,” Sarah assured him. “Narcissa will kick his arse before he touches one hair on your perfect head”). Crabbe was walking around moodily, glaring at Hermione and Sarah particularly venomously, disappointed that the Basilisk hadn’t managed to off them when it had the chance. On the other hand, Ginny Weasley was perfectly happy again.
In the end, Ginny, Fred and George snapped first and ended up throwing mashed parsnip at Percy, splattering his glasses and causing him to storm from the house, ignoring Mrs Weasley’s desperate cries.
“I have younger cousins?” Teddy said in excitement. “I thought I only had Victoire! Are you having babies, Sarah?”
As Sarah spun away with Blaise and Draco with Pansy, she noticed that Harry was now sitting with Ron at his table, trying to talk to the sour-looking boy. Padma was sitting beside them looking miserable.
Eventually, Justin was carried up to the hospital wing by Professor Flitwick and Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department, but nobody seemed to know what to do for Nearly Headless Nick. In the end, Professor McGonagall conjured a large fan out of thin air, which she gave to a student with instructions to waft Nearly Headless Nick up the stairs. This left Harry, Sarah, and Professor McGonagall alone together.
She took a deep breath and concentrated on repeating the incantation for the Stinging Hex in her head.
“Why don’t you come inside for some tea?” Professor Lupin suggested, walking smoothly past Sarah and opening the door wide in invitation.
“I’d rather not go back to Azkaban for murder, Blaise,” Draco said, rolling his eyes. “It was probably better that Granger stopped me.”
was her favourite,” he said, and as he said it, a grubby schoolboy seemed to look out through Aberforth’s wrinkles and tangles beard. “Not Albus, he was always up in his bedroom when he was home, reading his books and counting his prizes, keeping up with his correspondence with ‘the most notable magical names of the day’,” Aberforth sneered, “
“But then…” Lupin muttered, staring at Black so intently it seemed he was trying to read his mind. “…Why hasn’t he shown himself before now? Unless” – Lupin’s eyes suddenly widened, as though he was seeing something beyond Black, something none of the rest could see – “unless
Sarah nodded. “Maybe try to cut back on the arguments for a while, okay?” she suggested. “Or, if you really have to, do it somewhere where Harry doesn’t get dragged into it.”
“Hagrid, we’ll do everything we can,” Draco said. “There’s still the appeal. I’m not going to let my father take Buckbeak away from you.”
“I wish I could have saved him, too,” she whispered, her voice broken and guilt-ridden. “I should have – “
“Dear, what happened to cause that?” Madam Pomfrey asked. She directed Sarah to a bed while she bustled around to get some bruise paste.
“Well, who wouldn’t want a nice little holiday after all the hard work he’s been putting in?” asked Fred. “Point is, people, don’t get lulled into a false sense of security, thinking he’s out of the country. Maybe he is, maybe he isn’t, but the fact remains he can move faster than Severus Snape confronted with shampoo when he wants to, so don’t count on him being a long way away if you’re planning on taking any risks. I never thought I’d hear myself say it, and if my girlfriend were here she’d probably test me to make sure I’m not ill, but safety first!”
One of them was small, dark and beady. The other was large, round as a coin, and a vivid, electric blue. The blue eye was moving ceaselessly, without blinking, and was rolling up, down, and from side to side, quite independently of the normal eye – and then it rolled right over, pointing into the back of the man’s head so that all they could see was whiteness.
However, they sank after enduring a Transfiguration lesson with the pair the next day. Harry recounted to Sarah and Draco at lunch how Hermione had laughed at Ron’s disastrous first attempt at changing the colour of his eyebrows, somehow managing to give himself a handlebar moustache; Ron had retaliated by doing a cruel impression of Hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time Professor McGonagall asked a question, which Lavender and Parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced Hermione to the verge of tears again.
A jet of sparks shot from the end of Professor Lupin’s wand and hit the doorknob. The wardrobe burst open. Hook-nosed and menacing, Professor Snape stepped out, his eyes flashing at Neville.
She drew her wand in an X movement and a fiery figure appeared on the door. No sooner had the door clicked shut behind them the room began spinning again. When all became still again, the fiery cross still burned, showing the door they had already tried.
“For heaven’s sake, Potter!” said Professor McGonagall, straightening her glasses angrily (she had winced horribly when Harry had sued Voldemort’s name). “Do you really think this is about truth or lies? It’s about keeping your head down and your temper under control!”
“But what does it matter?” Voldemort said softly. “Even if you are right, Potter, it makes no difference to you and me. You no longer have the phoenix wand: we duel on skill alone … and after I have killed you, I can attend to Draco Malfoy…”
Harry blinked in surprise and made his way towards where Sarah, Hermione and Draco sat huddled at a table near the fire.
Lyra looked up to see that Hermione had joined her and was currently rummaging through her book bag with a piece of toast in her hand.
“Where did you find this sword?” she repeated, brandishing it in his face. “Snape sent it to my vault in Gringotts!”
“Oh dear Merlin!” the nurse exclaimed when she spotted the bruises Sarah could feel forming on her neck.
“My dear woman!” roared Fudged, who likewise looked angrier than Sarah had ever seen him, “as Minister of Magic, it is my decision whether I wish to bring protection with me when interviewing a possibly dangerous – “
“Love you too, darling,” Draco said, shaking his head. He didn’t shrug her off though and she rested comfortably on him like a koala cub.
Dread curled up in her stomach as her father pulled her through the gates and passed the anti-apparition wards. It quickly turned to nausea as he spun on the spot and they disapparated with a crack. Sarah hated Apparation. It felt as if they were squeezing through a small tube in a dizzying whirlwind. Now, Apparation was bad enough when it was voluntarily done – but when one party didn’t want to comply, it becomes ten times worse, like a blender set on high with Peeves shouting in your ears.
“Cedric Diggory, who also used the Bubble-Head Charm, was first to return with his hostage, though he returned one minute outside the time limit of an hour.” Enormous cheers from the Hufflepuffs in the crowd; Sarah saw Cho Chang give Cedric a glowing look. “We therefore aware him forty-seven points.”
“But you haven’t really got to know Mrs Norris,” Ron told her bracingly. “Honestly, we’re much better off without her.” Ginny’s lips trembled. “Stuff like this doesn’t often happen at Hogwarts,” Ron assured her. “They’ll catch the maniac who did it and have him out of here in no time. I just hope he’s got time to Petrify Filch before he’s expelled. I’m only joking – “ Ron added hastily as Ginny blanched.
Snape was silent for so long that Draco huffed and said harshly, “Until you decide to try to be a decent person, I don’t want anything to do with you. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to go read up on Occlumency and Legilimency to ensure that my boyfriend doesn’t become the victim of a vicious mental attack.”
Neville took a deep breath, looked up at the ceiling and shook his head. Sarah could not remember feeling sorrier for anyone, but she couldn’t do anything but stand there, tears pricking the back of her eyes.
All-day long, the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver valentines, to the annoyance of the teachers. Sarah, Draco, Ron, Harry and Hermione were walking upstairs for Charms after their Herbology class – where a dwarf had arrived and performed a valentine for Sarah, to her eternal embarrassment and to Ron and Draco’s great delight – when one of the dwarfs caught up with Harry.
“No!” Teddy exclaimed worriedly. “If you lived at the clinic then we wouldn’t be able to visit you whenever we want because it could harm the animals!”
“You’re never going to believe who I just bumped into,” Rosie said as she breezed into Draco’s private office. Technically, they shared it but Rosie was nearly never in it so she had deemed it Draco’s space for when he needed to escape from overbearing humans.
“Sounds fun,” drawled Sarah. She popped a strawberry in her mouth. “Why do they have fruit at dinner? Do you think the house-elves are trying to make a point?”
“Very badly,” said Percy peevishly, and he slammed the window shut. Chuckling, Bill and Charlie directed the tables safely onto the grass, end to end, and then, with a flick of his wand, Bill reattached the table leg and conjured tablecloths from nowhere.
“Yes,” Sarah said, answering his question. She had used a Sticking Charm to keep the leaf attached to the top of her mouth. Fred had found the idea to be extremely amusing. “Are you sure I’ll be able to do all this during school?”
“Minister?” Draco said, stepping forward and slipping into his ‘polite pureblood’ mask. “If I may? Are you here for the hippogriff’s appeal?”
Draco let out a soft snort and then looked horrified he had made such a noise. That cause Pansy and Sarah to burst into laughter and soon the heavy atmosphere had lifted. After a while, Sarah and Draco bid goodbye to the Slytherins and moved down the corridor in search of their other friends.
“Yeah, I get it, you don’t care! And what about the rest of my family, ‘the Weasley’s don’t need another kid injured’, did you hear that?”
“Oh dear!” she exclaimed. “Dinner started ten minutes ago! Go on, Sarah! Your friends will be wondering where you are.”
“Draco, you’re an excellent Seeker – you got on the team because of your skill, not your father,” Sarah said gently.
“Please,” Sarah said breathlessly, “we only brought her in here because I hoped we’d lose her. She was going to torture us. I couldn’t think of anything else!”
Madam Pomfrey smiled slightly and stepped back. “Put this on each night before bed,” she said, handing Sarah the tub of paste. “Use it if your neck hurts badly anytime during the day,” she advised.
“How do you know these?” Mila asked after she had tried a serving of Escargot and Bouillabaisse. “Hogwarts vould know offer these usually, right?”
“I suspected as much,” Mr Weasley said grimly. “We can’t, however, prove anything without having caught them.”
Sarah froze in horror as the newest voice washed over her. She looked at the man that had just stepped up next to Lucius Malfoy.
“Understandable,” Draco said. “I remember the one and only time I visited. If it’s the same as I remember, I don’t blame you for moving.”
Sarah smiled at him crookedly. “Harry, darling, not even you are dramatic enough to make up a story about your wand taking control and firing an unknown spell at Voldemort. Of course, I believe you.”
“Harry overheard something and now thinks he’s bloody possessed,” Sarah growled, shaking off Ron’s hand when he tried to stop her from walking to the stairs. She peered over the bannister at Sirius and added, “He’s probably sitting somewhere thinking he’s a danger to everyone. I’m going to go smack some sense into him. If we’re not down by dinner, meet us in Draco’s room.”
“Like that’s ever stopped Sarah before,” Draco groaned, rolling over on Neville’s bed and pulling the covers over his head.
“Ancient Studies,” she replied. She snagged Blaise’s and checked to see they were still in the same class. “I’m not looking forward to double Defense with Umbitch,” she frowned.
“Get out of the way, Potter,” spat Snape. “I will not have you acting like your father – too arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in Black or Lupin – now get out of the way, or I will
Fred leaned down and kissed her deeply, intensely. She gripped the sides of his face and drew him closer, pushing him to his side so she could press kisses down his body.
She punched him gently on the arm. “No harm done, one time, Harry pushed me off my broom and I fell ten feet.”
“That bad, huh?” Draco said in amusement, calmly picking up her shoulders so that she could no longer reach the wooden surface.
“You didn’t have any problem with it when you wanted his autograph,” Sarah said coldly, her posture rigid.
“What?” Draco exclaimed in horror. He stood up and grabbed the letter, reading it through quickly before furiously scrunching it into a ball and throwing it into the lake. “ARGH! No!”
“Harry, you practically vanished after Draco said your hair looked less like a mess today than usual,” she pointed out. “He thinks he insulted you or something. If I hadn’t found the map first, I bet it would be him sitting here now instead of me.”
She reached into her pocket and withdrew two chocolate frogs, handing them to Sarah and Harry. Sarah groaned and handed hers to Harry.
“I’d have looked after her, I told him so, I didn’t care about school, I’d have stayed home and done it. He told me I had to finish my education and
“I don’t know, babe,” Fred replied, pressing a kiss to her head. “But Draco’s a tough boy, he’ll be bouncing back in no time.”
Nobody answered. Sarah looked over Hermione’s shoulder and saw an unrecognisable face lying on Bill’s pillow, even worse now that it had been cleaned of blood. Madam Pomfrey was dabbing at his wounds with some harsh-smelling green ointment.
Draco and Sarah sat silently and didn’t offer an explanation. They knew the basics of what Snape had done when he was younger but it wasn’t something they were ready to share.
“I should’ve recognised him, he was there the night Dumbledore died,” he said. He turned over the darker Death Eater with his foot; the man’s eyes moved rapidly between the five of them.
Now, Harry smiled around the living room of The Burrow, unable to contain the happiness he felt at seeing all his family interact with one another. Draco, Teddy, Victoire and baby rose were all huddled at the base of the Christmas tree, Teddy sitting in Draco’s lap as he helped hand presents around the room. The children had grown very attached to the blond quite quickly and now it was nearly impossible for him to walk through the house without at least one child with him. Harry hid a smile in his mug of eggnog as he noticed that at some point, a bright red ribbon had been braided messily through Draco’s hair. The look that Draco sent Harry clearly said that if Harry commented on it, he would be
“Harry, you know that I consider you one of my closest friends now,” Lyra said in a serious tone, “but Draco is my brother. I will always,
“But the fake sword isn’t the only thing in that vault, is it?” asked Sarah. “Perhaps you’ve seen the other things in there?”
He was cut off by Harry’s lips covering his own. Distantly, he was aware of Harry grabbing their cups and moving them away, but Draco was more focused on the feeling of Harry’s lips moving against his.
Harry trooped miserably over to the couch, where Draco had passed out on before Hermione’s shout. Sarah joined them and handed Harry a potion to soothe his headache.
“And your mum, don’t forget that,” Lyra added weakly. She leant back against George as she caught her breath. “That was scarier than I thought it would be.”
“Not yet,” Draco said, tapping the small embroidered picture under his name. “But I’m sure if Great-aunt Walburga was still alive she would have taken great joy in destroying my picture.”
“Erm – “ Pansy started with another glance at Millicent. “Well, the thing is…Your parents didn’t host a Christmas party this year, Draco.”
“I definitely would,” Harry said in a whisper to Sarah and Fred, leaning forward slightly. “The bastard raked me out of nearly fifty galleons last week at the pub.”
There was silence in the Hall now, the kind of silence that presses against the eardrums, that seems too huge to be contained by walls.
They all separated to shower and head to lunch. Sarah offered to deal with the doxy eggs and when Mrs Weasley wasn’t looking, she poured them into a vial she conjured before slipping it into her pocket.
They spent the next few hours until breakfast finishing the pile of homework they had been given over the week.
A gigantic dragon was tethered to the ground in front of them, barring access to four or five of the deepest vaults in the place. Sarah recognised the entrances to her vault and the Malfoys’. The beast’s scales had turned pale and flaky during its long incarceration under the ground; its eyes were milky punk, both rear legs bore heavy cuffs from which chains led to enormous pegs driven deep into the rocky floor. Its great, spiked wings, folded close to its body, would have filled the chamber if it spread them, and when it turned its ugly head towards them, it roared with a noise that made the rock tremble, opened its mouth and spat a jet of fire that sent them running back up the passageway.
Sarah nodded silently and leant her head against the rock behind her. She felt Harry grab her hand and squeeze softly. She squeezed his in return.
“Do you think he really believes them?” Harry whispered as they moved slowly between the other couples.
Order members popped in occasionally to say hello but no meetings were held. One memorable occasion included Tonks staying for dinner and changing her appearance to re-enact various scenes from her time at Hogwarts, when she would get caught for impersonating professors and students.
“Dumbledore and the Order are making plans,” Remus said, cringing slightly. “Unfortunately, that’s all I can say right now.”
“What d’you think?” he asked anxiously. “We’re supposed to go incognito – do I look like a Muggle, Hermione?”
As the little man in black droned on, there was movement among the trees. The centaurs had come to pay their respects too. They did not move into the open but Sarah saw them standing quite still, half hidden in the shadow, watching the wizards, their bows hanging at their sides. And Sarah remembered her first nightmarish trip into the forest, the first time she and Harry had ever encountered Voldemort.
“For goodness sake, Harry! Stop sighing and actually do some study!” Hermione snapped at him, not even looking up from her own work.
Lyra was sitting in front of the fire, playing a nonsensical game with Teddy and Draco as the older women sat chatting in the kitchen when the backdoor suddenly opened and George walked through.
creature. I did not press charges, and as I am the person who was injured, I believe that my opinion on this matter should have been taken into consideration. I plead that you think about what I have said, Minister, for your actions today may have future consequences none of us are even aware of.”
*Translation: Safe and sound in your eternal sleep, my dear, because the world will no longer hurt you*
“I asked him for help,” repeated Lyra. “And he agreed to provide it. We’re civil now,” she added, a slight sneer curling her lips at the ridiculousness of the idea.
Harry disabled the Privacy Charm and walked into the alcove. Sarah didn’t look his way as he replaced the Charm and joined her on the ledge.
“Narcissa!” Sarah exclaimed in delight, jumping up to hug the thin woman. “I’m so sorry about all the trouble I’ve undoubtedly caused you.”
“Come on, then,” he said, pulling her to her feet. He reached out to smooth down her hair slightly. “Might as well go find the others before someone sends a search party.”
At once, the statue’s hump opened wide enough to admit a fairly thin person. They quickly glanced up and down the corridor, then Harry tucked the map away again, ducked out from under the cloak, hoisted himself into the hole headfirst, and pushed himself forward.
.” She took a deep breath and said in a gentler tone. “We have every right to be there, Draco, just like everyone else.”
“Kreacher drank, and he drank, he saw terrible things…Kreacher’s insides burned…Kreacher cried for Master Regulus to save him, he cried for his Mistress Black, but the Dark Lord only laughed…He made Kreacher drink all the potion…He dropped a locket into the empty basin…He filled it with more potion. And then the Dark Lord sailed away, leaving Kreacher on the island…”
“We’re staying here tonight,” Draco announced, standing from the couch and pulling Harry to his feet. “No way we’re leaving you alone.”
“Shush,” Rosie said, flipping the report closed and ignoring Draco’s glower. “I haven’t even told you the best part!”
Griphook nodded. “The Lestranges added their own protection on top of the standard ones Gringotts provides.”
“Of course, Mistress, no one is knowing,” said Daisy. “Shall I have tea sent up for Mistress and friends?”
Their trunks arrived from Hogwarts while they were eating lunch, so that they could dress as Muggles for their trip to St Mungo’s. Everyone except Harry was riotously happy and talkative as they changed out of their robes into jeans and sweatshirts, and they greeted Tonks and Mad-Eye, who had turned up to escort them across London.
“In here,” said Bill, opening the door to his and Fleur’s room. It, too, had a view of the sea, now flecked with gold in the sunrise. Harry moved to the window, turned his back on the spectacular view and waited, his arms folded, Draco standing beside him. Hermione took the chair beside the dressing table, Ron sat on the arm, and Sarah collapsed on the edge of the bed.
It was a very tight fit. The fact that the three boys had grown taller throughout the year didn’t help. Sarah and Hermione had to awkwardly hunch in front of their bodies and lead them to ensure that everyone’s feet were covered.
“I’m thinking that I’ve been a fool to blindly trust a man who went to so much effort to keep things from me,” he confessed. “What?” he added after her extended silence, “you’re not going to disagree with me?”
” Eight curses flew in eight different directions and the shelves opposite them exploded as they hit. The towering structure swayed as a hundred glass spheres burst apart, pearly-white figures unfurling into the air and muttering sinister whispers.
She cut off as there was another noise behind them and she turned. Her heart seemed to fail: Fred was now climbing through the hole in the wall, closely followed by Lee Jordan, George and Ginny. Fred gave her a lopsided smile and Sarah nearly lost all her composure right then and there.
“I’ve been carrying these around for days to help with the pain and possible infection,” she explained. “We wouldn’t just let her win.”
Draco sighed. “Remind me to reduce her paycheck,” he muttered to Simon, who simply stretched his paws out and purred.
“Why is that the first thing you think about?” Harry asked, momentarily distracted from his original train of thought.
Ron was standing behind him, eyes wide. Hermione elbowed him before offering her own hand to shake. He blinked and shook his head, holding his hand out after a moment.
The team members drifted outwards until they formed a rough circle around the pitch. Angeline raised the Quaffle with one hand and threw it hard to Fred, who passed to George, who passed to Harry, who passed to Ron, who dropped it.
!” said Sarah. “Look, I’ve been practising that with Sirius all holidays. Sure, there were a few times where it didn’t go so well but that’s not the point!” she cried as Draco’s eyes flashed again. “The point is, I’ll be more careful in the future and I’ll warn you so I don’t give you a premature heart attack.”
They had just finished a lovely picnic that the elves had packed when an owl appeared on the horizon, soaring over the glittering lake and landing in front of Sarah.
“At least you managed to get that ghoul to look like you,” Draco snorted. “Spattergroit, ridiculous.”
“I’m telling you, it’s much better to find frog spawn in your bed than doxy droppings,” Fred was saying.
“I think we’re nearly there,” George commented, looking down at the map in his lap. He had taken his Mum’s wand and charmed the map to trap their progress. If Sarah wasn’t feeling so sick, she would have been extremely impressed by his skill.
“I promised not to blow up anything for a week,” Seamus piped up from further down the table. “She didn’t seem to believe me for some reason but I proved her wrong and she said we could do it.”
“Sarah!” Draco said, quickly scrambling off the ground and pulling her into a hug. “I’m glad you’re all right. I was going to come to you but I thought you could use Fred in that moment.”
“Six weeks…seven…I forget,” said the tired man. “Met up with Griphook in the first couple of days and joined forces with Gornuk not long after. Nice to have a bit of company.” There was a pause, while knives scraped plates and tin mugs were picked up and replaced on the ground. “What made you leave, Ted?” continued the man.
She watched as the four of them disappeared and then she dropped to her knees beside Fred. She touched his hand tentatively and he raised his head to look at her with pain-filled eyes.
When the trolley witch arrived, Ron asked if they should wake up the Professor. Despite Hermione trying, he slept on, dead to the world.
Draco put his own attention back to the front and couldn’t help the giddy feeling that rose up within his chest. He looked over to his sister again and found her smiling widely at him.
“So, what if we use an external factor?” Sarah suggested, thinking fast. “We need something that will play to Harry’s strengths but will also be in the rules.”
“I’m sure you’ll dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical skills,” yawned Fred, nuzzling the back of Sarah’s neck.
Professor McGonagall’s lips thinned and her face was uncharacteristically soft as she peered at the four students. Professor Snape’s expression was as unreadable as ever.
Harry knew that distracting her was the best way to help bring her out of the nightmare so he began to prattle nonsensically about the most recent Quidditch match between the Chudley Cannons and Puddlemere United.
Lockhart and Snape turned to face each other and bowed; at least, Lockhart did, with much twirling of his hands, whereas Snape jerked his head irritable. Then they raised their wands like swords in front of them.
Sarah stood in front of the large, scarlet steam engine and watched with a smile on her face as Lyra helped Orion lug his trunk onto the train. James stood behind them in the corridor and disappeared as soon as the trunk was safely on board.
Sarah frowned with a slight smile as she opened it. Inside lay a small golden necklace with the Cassiopeia constellation made of tiny white gemstones.
“Regardless of whether Pansy is a bitch or not – which she undoubtedly is – “ Lyra said sternly, “It does not mean she should be left to be roped into something she does not believe it.”
Dragons comprised entirely of green-and-gold sparks were soaring up and down the corridors, emitting loud fiery blasts and bangs as they went. Shocking pink Catherin wheels five feet in diameter were whizzing lethally through the air like so many flying saucers. Rockets with long tails of brilliant silver stars were ricocheting off the walls. Sparklers were writing swearwords in midair of their own accord. Firecrackers were exploding like mines everywhere Harry looked, and instead of burning themselves out, fading from sight, or fizzling to a halt, these pyrotechnical miracles seemed to be gaining in energy and momentum the longer he watched.
Sarah’s breathing became shallow as a familiar screaming began to fill her ears. She felt hands on her shoulders, holding her tight as she pitched forward.
They all crowded around Hagrid’s giant form and tried to calm him down while he failed to make tea. Hermione took over and Hagrid told them that Dumbledore was going to come down as well. He was interrupted by a loud screech.
“Er – thanks, Loon – er – Luna,” Neville said, flushing slightly. “I was just about to show them the defensive mechanisms. Here, Harry, hold Trevor.”
Sarah had rewritten her essay three times to include all the new information she had learnt. She also made a copy of the notes for Hermione and Draco, knowing that they would have been quite upset about missing out.
Lockhart waved an arm for silence and called, “Gather round, gather round! Can everyone see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent!”
of your students that aren’t Slytherins. You’re biased, rude, vicious and overall, not that great of a person. But, for some
“Would anyone be able to stop me?” she retorted, raising her eyebrow at him. Harry conceded her point with a nod.
And then the thing beneath the hood, whatever it was, drew a long, slow, rattling breath, as though it were trying to suck something more than air from its surroundings. An intense cold swept over them all and Sarah felt her breath catch in her chest. She began to shiver violently, teeth clacking together. The cold went deeper than her skin. It was inside her chest, it was inside her very heart…
“What could be more powerful than the Killing Curse?” Ron said. “Something to cause immense pain before death?”
“Not really,” Draco said. “I think it’s better that Voldemort won’t be able to get his hands on whatever was in it. It certainly can’t have been anything good.”
“My dad thinks it’s an awful paper,” said Luna, chipping into the conversation unexpectedly. Sucking on her cocktail onion, she gazed at Rita with her enormous, protuberant, slightly mad eyes. “He publishes important stories that he thinks the public needs to know. He doesn’t care about making money.”
“I think it’s interesting how you switch between French and English when you’re mad,” Harry observed.
Harry raised his head from where it had been resting against the wall and awkwardly turned to watch the small grey owl bobbing in and out of sight. Draco grumbled from where he had been dozing against Harry’s chest as the other boy leant forward and let the small bundle of feathers inside the compartment.
The four of them placed final charms on their projects before meeting again in the kitchen. Remus grasped Sarah’s arm while Sirius held Fred’s. The crack of apparation echoed through Sarah’s skull even once they had appeared in Remus’ cosy living room.
“You just don’t want to accept it, darling,” Pansy simpered. “I’m sure you’ll figure it out sooner than later.”
Sarah felt a pleasant warmth blossom in her chest at the words and she pulled Narcissa into another tight hug.
Sarah then noticed that Harry’s hair and clothes were plastered to his body and he was shivering with a mixture of excitement and cold. Hermione dropped down beside Sarah.
“Your father,” Professor Snape repeated, his tone dry as if he were speaking to a simpleton. “He has contacted me requesting to speak with you tomorrow -”
“Our job,” a rough voice said behind Lyra. She went still as she realised that she and Draco were being held by a broad man in the dark red Auror robes. “We need to take these two into custody.”
The dormitory doors flew open, making them all jump: Hagrid came striding toward them, his hair rain-flecked, his bearskin coat flapping behind him, a crossbow in his hand, leaving a trail of muddy dolphin-sized footprints all over the floor.
“Oh, I know, but how about we leave before you start shouting at us?” Sarah suggested, grabbing the girl’s arm and pulling her out of the shop.
Sarah and Draco raced across the pitch the minute Harry touched down, throwing their arms around him. A second later, another impact made it known that Hermione had joined their group hug.
Draco let a small chuckle loose and turned his head to face Michael. “Hence the morose night,” he agreed.
The school finally made its way back into the Great Hall, settling into their House tables. As Sarah and Draco passed the Durmstrang students to take their seats at the Slytherin table, a deep voice called out their names.
“The hardest bloody thing was waiting for that electrical storm,” she had complained to him. “I have no clue how you did that.”
don’t know…I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death, and it fell right through the top of my head,” said Myrtle, glaring at them. “It’s over there, it got washed out…”
, who seemingly lived in Newcastle, not London. Who had a sick old cat and looked after his godson, Edward Lupin. Draco’s mother had kept him updated on the boy through his aunt Andromeda but he hadn’t known that Potter seemed to have primary custody. Yet again, Andromeda’s age had been catching up to her recently and she did spend more time with his mother than anyone else.
The scream was the more terrible because she had never expected or dreamed that Professor McGonagall could make such a sound. Lyra heard another woman laughing nearby, and knew that Bellatrix gloried in McGonagall’s despair. Around her, more voices rose into the air, each sounding as broken as each other.
“Oh Merlin, are you all right?” Draco said worriedly, getting to his feet and reaching for his boyfriend.
Shaking her head in disbelief, Sarah half-carried, half-dragged Ron through the entrance of the tent. The interior was exactly as Sarah remembered it: a small flat, complete with a bathroom and a tiny kitchen. She shoved aside an old armchair and lowered Ron carefully onto the lower berth of a bunk bed. Even this very short journey had turned Ron whiter still, and once they had settled him on the mattress, he closed his eyes and did not speak for a while.
?” Pansy huffed, sliding in next to Millicent. The other girl offered her girlfriend a quick kiss on the cheek before turning back to her conversation with Theo.
Harry shook his head quickly, his eyes wide. “I would never!” he exclaimed. “Sarah, the last thing I would do is give up on Draco. I love him!”
Surprisingly, nearly everyone’s heads turned toward Harry but nobody spoke. Funnily enough, it was only those who had been in Divination the period before, which apparently was nearly everybody excluding Blaise, Theo, Draco, Sarah, and Millicent. Hermione raised her hand.
Sarah shivered as realised she was just wearing a thin shirt of Draco’s that she had stashed in Hermione’s room months ago. Fred noticed her shiver and took off his dressing-gown, handing it to her silently.
Sarah watched as Voldemort waved his wand. Seconds later, out of one of the castle’s shattered windows, something that looked like a misshaped bird flew through the half-light and landed in Voldemort’s hand. He shook the mildewed object by its pointed end and it dangled, empty and ragged: the Sorting Hat.
“Hi, Harry!” said Romilda Vane, the moment they had climbed through the portrait hole. “Fancy a gillywater?”
Luna’s voice echoed in the dark cell and suddenly it filled with light. Draco saw Weasley put something silver in his pocket as Potter turned to the cell’s occupants.
“The moment their acne clears up, they’ll be ready for repotting again,” Sarah heard her telling Filch kindly one afternoon. “And after that, it won’t be too long until we’re cutting them up and stewing them. You’ll have Mrs Norris back in no time.”
“If you kill them, you’ll end up in Azkaban and that means you won’t be able to spend time with me,” she said calmly. “So, unless you want me to kill
Sirius had had enough. He wrenched the curtain nearly closed before hissing, “I didn’t just befriend the half-breed,
Harry nodded. He had his determined look on his face and Sarah knew that now they had hit a breakthrough, he would stop at nothing to succeed.
“This is Mila and Aleksander,” Sarah said, sorting out the towels. “They’re friends of Viktor. They wanted to help.”
“Is there where you disappeared to last night?” he asked Sarah, ignoring Blaise making crude gestures from across the table.
“I bet it’s useful for independent study,” Sarah muttered, grimacing at the horrific illustration in the book she was perusing. “What we really need is something about obscure magical creatures.”
Sarah scowled at him as  Sirius, Draco and Remus burst into laughter – the traitors. Sarah turned to Teddy and looked the little boy seriously in his amber eyes.
“That lake is near-freezing,” Madam Pomfrey said, throwing a disapproving glance toward the judge’s table. “The champions will need Pepper-Ups and towels as soon as they exit.”
“Fine,” Mrs Weasley said. “But Ron – Ginny – Hermione – Fred – George – I want you all out of the kitchen, now.”
Lyra pulled out the second letter that had arrived at lunch and handed it to Draco. She knew that her mother had arranged for them to use the Headmistress’s Floo to travel to the Manor after classes tomorrow, giving them the weekend to deal with the funeral and everything that came after that.
Lyra frowned at him. “But you’ve been doing that for weeks,” she said in confusion. “That was the first part of the plan.”
“You’re a god,” Draco muttered in thanks, swiftly taking a sip and sighing in delight as the hot liquid seemed to jumpstart his body.
When the night got late, instead of going straight home, they decided to stroll around the city, pointing out favourite places they liked to visit.
The voices became louder but no more intelligible as the group of men reached the bank. Sarah estimated that their owners were fewer than twenty feet away, but the cascading river made it impossible to tell for sure. Hemione snatched up the beaded bag and started to rummage; after a moment she drew out five Extendable Ears and threw one to each of them, all hastily inserting the ends of the flesh-coloured strings into their ears and fed the other ends out of the tent entrance.
Tom tutted. “You need ter be careful with yer pa, he’s a right ‘andful,” he said. “Come on, I’ll show yer ter room.” He turned around and began walking up the rickety staircase.
Sarah, Draco and Ron waited apprehensively for something to happen, relaxing only slightly when nothing untoward occurred.
Sarah made a mental note to by Mr and Mrs Weasley some muggle clothes next time she went shopping in London. She had never been more thankful for dragging Ron, Harry and Draco with her and Hermione on one of their outings; they now had a nice selection of muggle appropriate clothing.
“Pathetic, Weasley,” said Snape, after a while. Ron and Harry were working together while Draco had partnered with Hermione. So far, Ron hadn’t managed anything other than a high-pitched whistling noise as he tried his hardest not to mutter the incantation. “Here – let me show you – “
“We ought to have more fun, just the two of us,” Lyra said. She was lying with her arms and legs spread out wide like a starfish and her hair was streaming loose underneath her knit hat. She looked an absolute mess of pink skin and wet clothing and Draco knew he looked the exact same.
“I think it’s time,” Sarah said in a slightly melancholic tone. “We’ve grown past the age where we need Hogwarts. We need to test our luck in the world now.”
“Well – no,” said Hermione, stretching out a placatory hand toward him. “But Ron, we didn’t want to leave – we had to!”
