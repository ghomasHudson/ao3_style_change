was helping
"I did" Draco stopped playing with the sheets and laid down on his back, staring at the ceiling they both knew so well "You
She gave him an icy look, stopping dead in front of Gryffindor's door "My brother is dead because of.. Of..."
"I know"
"Morning" Draco muttered without any feeling in his voice, the last few nights had left him drained. The nightmares were still there, but they were different. Voldemort and Nagini weren't the main attraction now, but Harry leaving him. Or dying. Or telling him how he could never love someone like Draco.
Harry tried to push past that, to focus on the task at hand. That had always worked for him.
" no. No.
They kept kissing, and he kept moving his fingers helping Draco relax. One of Draco's legs had come to rest on his waist, pulling him even closer and making his head spin. When he felt like it was enough -right about the moment when he heard one of Draco's moans again- he pulled his fingers out, and grabbed his wand. Using the same spell as before, he used the lube on his erection being careful not to move away from Draco.
His chest was full of scars, and that was no news to Draco. Some were thin and others were not, but they were all awful. Despite that, he had never cared much about those, he had deserved them at the time. He remembered that night, the feeling of the cold water on his back, mixing with the warmth of his blood. He was going to die, alone, inside a bathroom.
"She's fine. She's... fine" Harry said, convincing no one. The girl was at the infirmary and that was all they knew about her, really, but it would have to be enough.
Harry arched an eyebrow trying to understand what he was doing "You?"
He followed suit, taking off his shoes but throwing them around.
A hand moved on its own to his left arm, touching the place where his bandage was - and under it the Mark.
"So, Malfoy" Draco looked at the young Weasley girl. Ugh. "What are you going to do after the school year's over?"
to smile. “What? What's so funny?”
He was mocking, harsh, trying to turn sour something that felt beautiful. Draco gave him a hard stare, cold despite the exhaustion. He had lived in Slytherin for too long, he knew how to handle the mocking tone of one of his peers, he knew what to do with it even if it hurt.
"I'm not going back inside"
"My turn" Draco said, grabbing at his shoulders and making him roll just enough to have his back against the mattress. Looking up and seeing Draco's face was almost too much for his heart, it was like staring at the sun: you want to see it but it's too bright, warm, intense.
Of course, lingering inside that room with the vials wasn't an option, and so they had decided Draco would hide them someplace safe. Elliot had voiced how much he disliked leaving that task to him. In his eyes he was untrustworthy and would probably betray them. Draco couldn't blame him, really.
there was doubt there, Harry could see it
Harry moved closer to the bed as well, but he could feel how tense he was. "Old? How old?"
"Yeah, he was pale like a ghost"
"Cool. Oh, hey Herm"
“What's going on?” Bell groaned, looking at the runes he had perfectly drawn and his red stained hands. “This isn't working...”
Harry read his words, a small frown on his gorgeous face. His hair was a mess, but Draco had been the one to cause it - running his hands through it. He discovered he loved it, just like that.
"Him and his friends. I don't really know which one did it. One of them was Lupin, you know? Sirius and..." Bile rose up from his stomach to his throat at the thought of the one that betrayed them. The one that condemned him for the rest of his life.
"I-... Pure bloods don't get divorced"
The woman herself was sitting behind her desk, looking to a side of the room where three Aurors were standing. It was clear they had been talking for a while now.
"We saw something odd on the map... Well, Draco thought it was weird that someone was talking to Myrtle"
"It's not pity, Draco" Harry intertwined his fingers with Draco's "Look, we're in this... Mess together. Yeah?" he tried smiling a bit, maybe that would relax the slytherin.
"That's a mistake"
"I don't really eat that much. We were on the road for a while and there wasn't much to eat, really"
"It's not that... Look, forget it"
Harry felt like someone was pulling the ground from under him. How could she know about this? They had been careful and no prefect had found them. No ghost had seen them. Their friends wouldn't go and tell on them either.
, feel... The same then?"
"Sorry" Harry pulled back, looking at him and trying to calm down his breathing. Slowly but surely his thoughts came back, and his mind realized what he had been doing just moments ago. Had it been too much? He blushed softly, and ran a hand through his own hair.
"Sure, whatever" His best friend didn't even look at him. Harry didn't want this for them, but he wasn't going to start shunning Draco simply because Ron was being a prat. His friend was better than this.
"Okay" Draco chuckled and let go of his waist, grabbing Harry's free hand and placing it on
Draco swallowed, looking lost and unable to speak. He finally nodded."Thank you"
"And, Noah?"
Without thinking, Elliot pushed a random door open and pulled Draco behind him. They both pressed their backs to the door, feeling the creature hit it -still growling and biting at the wood-, trying to get in. Draco closed his eyes, pain shooting through his back and legs as they pushed back to keep the
"We are playing, not chatting, Potter. Come on, say your truth and your lie"
"Didn't seem like it. Seemed like you wanted to hurt a kid just because he insulted you"
"We wanted to talk to you"
"What Hermione said" Harry knew he didn't have to clarify anything and, actually, he shouldn't but he wanted to "I am doing this for you... but not only for you"
He looked over to where Malfoy was sitting, knees to his chest, arms hugging his legs. Harry reminded himself that they hated each other and he should be incredibly offended that Malfoy had the audacity to show his face around there. But, again, he really didn't have a choice.
Draco nodded "Yes. Not publicly but yes. When I understood that crying in front of my father was... not the best thing to do, I started doing it in private. Of course mother would come soothe me if she-" Draco stopped, looking down at Harry for a moment not quite sure if he should be sharing something like this. Harry wanted him to. He had no mother to remember, he wouldn't feel sad. Perhaps a bit envious. Still, he was glad Draco had a mother that loved him. "if she heard me. She would say that crying allows the pain to flow away from our bodies and minds. That if one wishes to be... strong, one needs to get rid of the unnecessary hurt"
"Great"
Shit. Shit. What to say? What to do? Draco stayed very still, not knowing if this was another test.
Ginny chuckled and looked extremely amused, moving her glass on the floor from one point to another without spilling a single drop.
"Alright, what are we doing then?"
him the bedroom. He had taken the room that wasn't tied to any horrible memories and it was actually
"Let's go, this is the best time for sneaking around"
"She doesn't understand, not really"
What did that have to do with anything? Harry tried to focus on the conversation and not in the strong urge to disappear to the bathroom for a little while.
"I'm trying..."
"We have to... It could help clear your name and put an end to this"
Hermione was giving both of them weird looks "What's happening?"
"He's threatening me!" he said, moving away but shaking his hands towards him "this death eater, he just threatened me!"
"Who's there?" The girl said, worried, shaking as she tried to sit upright. This was clearly different, all the other victims had been passed out, completely gone.
"Please"
“But you trust Harry, right?”
Oh. Harry nodded and quickly dipped his quill inside the inkwell and proceeded to write. Merlin, his writing looked like a 5 year olds next to Draco's. Well, it's not like anyone actually cared to teach him how to do it.
Harry gritted his teeth. He knew she wasn't trustworthy from the moment he met her and now it was being proven, right? Because what else could this mean except she was in on whatever was going on?
What?
Draco nodded and started folding his parchment, as well as picking up his books. Neither said a word.
Harry groaned, dreading the thought. Christmas with them? Oh, Merlin, they had an extremely rocky road ahead. Ron and Hermione had once gotten into a huge fight about where to go for the holidays and-...
" Harry said and disappeared inside, leaving him even more confused and in the cold. Great.
. True fear struck him as the third one there, a boy that had remained quiet and didn't seem to be completely on board with the situation started to unbutton Draco's left sleeve.
"You don't fancy Cho anymore" Draco chuckled "You are not making this hard"
"No, that can't be true"
"I don't care. Never did. I just... My aunt raised me" He was frowning "at least for a while, and your Father..." Rage filled his voice and Draco didn't feel scared.
"Careful" Draco chuckled against the kiss, biting down on his lip.
"And I... We are
His eyes watered again, and this time he had no one to hold him.
Perhaps he should just close his eyes and doze off... No, that would be a terrible idea, falling asleep with him would mean that Malfoy would hear his screams and probably get a good idea of what his nightmares were all about and he could not allow that to happen.
Draco kissed his neck, pressing a hand to the bed to keep himself steady. He was so glad they had gotten rid of most of their clothing by now. His teeth pulled at the skin, and his whole body reacted, sound escaping from his lips. There was no guide for this, and yet their bodies seemed to know exactly what they needed.
Draco chuckled against his lips before giving in, and he felt the laugh light something inside of his body. It was freeing, in spite of the world.
“No, I mean... Harry's friends kind of know. Granger and Weasley. But we didn't tell them”
She held her dress slightly up while she went upstairs, the letter clutched on her left hand. Lucius would be inside his study. She worried about him, he wasn't strong as she was. Something like public disgrace, or losing power did not go well with Lucius. And now the house arrest? She had to be strong for him, to make him remember who he was. Who they were.
"I'm tired, mother. It's been a long day" He moved away from his hand, but held it for a brief moment. Gathering all the courage he could, he looked up to his father and nodded once "Father"
Bravery. What a stupid trait. One he wished he had, at least for a day. For that day.
"It's never too late"
Harry looked around the room "Why not above the fireplace?"
"I am serious about this"
Ah, fuck.
, it is. So get lost"
"Alright, that was unexpected" Draco chuckled pressing himself closer to Harry "Do muggles do that?"
He started walking with him down the corridor, accepting his defeat. But this didn't mean he wouldn't talk to him all the way to the dungeons.
"I don't know"
Hermione was startled for a second, before opening her eyes wide. He opened his mouth and then closed it a couple of times, because his enthusiastic 'no' had been a clear 'yes' and now he was caught with no good explanation and no plan and Malfoy was going to be so angry when he found out they knew...
but she wouldn't let him go. He was a small crying thing, perfect and he was safe with her.
The coldness that had run through his veins at the thought of taking off his shirt was replaced by his kisses, one by one it filled him with warmth. Harry pressed his forehead to his chest, his hair tickling him a bit.
"Let's make this civil?" Harry almost begged, pushing some desks to form a semi circle. Draco sat down next to him almost immediately, having moved
How was he going to keep Harry interested for a whole year without seeing each other? Draco had thought about it extensively, he would write and Harry would respond until he wouldn't anymore. And then Draco would know, he would know Harry was interested in someone else. Hell, maybe he would go back to the Weasley girl. And Draco couldn't even blame him. Harry deserved better, someone who could give him... More. Just
Harry nodded, but not very sure about that.
“I know we should be ready but... we are not making any progress, are we? Whoever is doing this only has two more nights with the right moon phase or they'd have to wait one more month”
Harry sighed and walked towards the blonde boy; he had managed to send him a letter informing that his two friends knew and that they'd meet at night. He hoped the whole meeting wouldn't blow up in pieces.
"Yeah... me too"
"Yeah. Wait! What are we going to do about...?"
“Ron and I have to go” Hermione said, grabbing at his arm and pulling him. She moved closer to his ear and said something. Ron's face went from relaxed to slightly scared and he moved away from them.
"How come Elliot hates you?"
"Do you?"
Harry wanted him to come back almost immediately.
"If you need more help with herbology we can-"
A soft squeeze on his arm, Draco's hand. He knew it was his as well as he could feel his presence next to his body. The attacker wasn't Draco. It wasn't and now he had proof. They had just been together, he had been
"I'm sorry, Harry. They were bad people"
He was right, and Harry knew it. They started walking slowly through the first row of bookcases, trying to find their way through the maze. Draco was pulling books from strategic places. Leaving marks in case they got lost? Smart.
"Yeah, yeah, stop whining" Harry smiled, hurrying towards the path.
"If there's anything you need... you can always call me"
"You...?"
Draco's arms hugged his waist so he rested his hands behind his neck, unable to move away from him. He wanted to do this out in the open, but he didn't want Draco to lose his family. Even if his family was horrible.
Harry half expected Draco to protest, but he only slumped even more in one of the chairs.
"Yeah. Uhm, we could... check it if you have it"
Elliot didn't seem pleased “You are not putting any spells on me, I don't trust you”
Elliot made a face "No, he has a thing for rule breaking and getting in trouble"
and he was sure Draco wasn't going to take that well.
Harry cleared his throat, a hand suddenly resting on Draco's lower back like a burning iron. Hm. Interesting.
"The heat will ruin the painting, Potter" Draco shook his head but... compromise was part of living together "...but I'm sure we can put a special spell on it?"
"I know you will be able to do this, you just need to...connect with your emotions. Alright?"
“Hm?”
The expression on his father's face almost made him laugh. The whole situation was ridiculous. He was talking to his father about his love life without hiding who he loved. And oh, he was dating Potter, of all people. He would've laughed if he didn't feel so shitty.
"I think we should go to the Infirmary and read about my attack. I mean I'm sure they wrote down how I was and... maybe there is a clue in there"
Draco nodded without opening his eyes, a small smile on his lips. It was true they didn't have much time to be together like this, but he felt so good he almost didn't have room to feel bad about anything else.
. The war is over now"
Draco knew he could still be
What the hell? The books stopped falling after a few minutes of having the magic shield up. Thank Merlin.
"It will be our home, Draco. You know that, right? I mean, it's... It's not just
made his head spin. He leaned into Draco, kissing him and pulling him closer, so close that their chests were touching again. "Promise you'll say goodbye before you leave?"
"Hm?"
the wealth, but he didn't want to have
He didn't answer, pulling the bed sheets over his head.
Harry spoke next, moving away from the Tower's entrance "People surprise us sometimes. Were you friends? Have they questioned Noah?"
That was Harry, awfully tidy. Sometimes, they would be laying on the bed, both lazy after having breakfast, and Harry would glance towards the night stand and the mugs there. It wasn't like he was going to say anything to him, or complain for
future, but not much about what Draco was going to do after school was done. Of course he couldn't just go and start on a job or further is education, at least not for a whole year. So that gave him some time to think about it.
He could feel Draco's eyes on him, so he kept looking down to the wand while trying to aim it right. This spell was knew to him, Hermione had explained how to do it but still...
At that, she turned with anger in her eyes "Oh, you are one to talk... Or are you not going to marry at all? I don't see you going against your family's wishes"
Draco laughed, and it was a beautiful one. "Sure, whatever you say... If you don't know what you are then... Are you going to get back with the Weasley girl?"
Draco groaned at his own thoughts, wishing the shame to go away, to leave him alone. It didn't seem to want to leave. Would it ever?
"You know the answer to that, son. Good morning" His mother spoke from behind him, reaching the table without any sort of hurry. How much had she heard? Draco was really good at sensing when someone was behind him or spying, had he let down his guard that much already? She sat down on the empty seat next to her husband, and took her cup, placing it next to Draco's. "Why do you ask?"
"I guess what I'm... I just..." Draco being insecure and nervous did not help at all. It only made him feel more shitty about being angry.
he wished for the most. At first, he hadn't expected to end up with him, obviously. He hadn't even expected to be alive after the war, or Harry to be alive. But they were. And somehow the universe had conspired for them to find each other.
"There's not much to tell,
"Lucius"
"There" He sounded so damn pleased with himself and he was so out of words.
The boy tensed and his grey eyes focused on him, it was hard to have this conversation but some things couldn't be avoided. Truth was they hadn't gone up there just to check on his owl and spend some time together. Something had been going on lately and they hadn't had an opportunity to talk about it. The last words they had shared had been a bit harsh and Harry could see they were both quite sorry.
"Feels like old times" Ron said with a smile, allowing Harry to cover both of them with the cloak as they made their way around the Castle trying to find a way in.
"So, did you learn anything?"
"Whatever it is, it's okay"
"How are you?"
Sadly, he was sure Harry would prefer to go through his nightmares and breakdowns alone.
"Let's go talk to Elliot, Potter. And then we can go our own ways"
"Did you see anything?" Noah asked a bit more confident now.
Draco pressed his lips together, and crossed his arms. "They won't-... Let's not talk about that"
"Ah, yes" Harry smirked "I used to... do what I'm doing right now and see where you were"
Bell placed a hand on Draco's shoulder "How about you take some, hm? Be a good boy for me"
Harry felt like punching him.
His day had been a disaster. He had disappointed Harry by not getting Myrtle's information, and then his classes had been terribly boring. Usually he was a good student, but his mind was somewhere else... and deep down he kept asking himself what was all for? It almost felt as if it didn't matter.
Harry searched around the room, finding the blonde head almost immediately at the back. He was quiet and Harry could see he was trying to hide all of his feelings and reactions. Everything was calculated here.
Malfoy snorted while taking off his shoes and throwing himself onto the 'bed'. Harry still wasn't sure if it was a bed, a big couch, or a huge mattress. It was all probably done with magic so it
(See the end of the chapter for
"When he gave me the serum. I faked it"
Harry was frowning. Why did he want him to know that? It changed nothing. They both made their choices. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Talking about the war only made him more confused
Harry Potter's friends shared a look and then stared at him. It was a bit creepy how they understood each other. Noah wondered if he and Elliot looked like that sometimes.
"Harry! Come say hello!" Charlie screamed at him from a side of the room and so he did. Smiling, he approached and hugged him. The Weasleys had always been a second family to him.
And that was when Draco finally moved away, leaving a cold shadow where he had been. "Of course I did, Potter. That a surprise?"
“So? "
The other boy closed his book and placed it inside his bag incredibly slowly, giving him distrustful looks before getting up and tugging softly at the cloak's fabric.
it, it was clear enough!"
"Didn't think you would come" Malfoy spoke without opening his eyes
"About almost dying? Well,
"Really? Because it looked like you did!"
Alright, Harry wasn't exactly sure what his sexuality was but he was sure he was more than attracted to Draco. Something inside his head told him he wouldn't feel this again, not with anyone else. This time he didn't shush the voice, he allowed himself a moment of peace, of daydreaming. When his eyes closed, his mind kept coming up with scenarios where he was happy and loved. Scenarios where they stayed together.
The Great Hall was packed as it always was during dinner time but Draco hadn't stared around the room as much as he used to. He didn't want to see the faces of the other slytherins. It was true that a lot of students sat with other houses to have dinner, but a Slytherin among Gryffindors? A Malfoy?
the blonde found a fucking way to... Invade his thoughts.
"It was madness. I guess everything was so... Dark and death was everywhere, I just needed to do something right. One thing. At least
"I guess I am" Draco did feel his heart jump a bit at the mention of Harry
"I-... I can't" Harry sighed, running a hand through his already messy hair.
like Lucius. "The other theory is that the Room is telling us to trust them, or work with them"
"Yeah, my mind just wandered..."
Dinner was not tasty, or it was but he couldn't enjoy it because his mind was too caught up in everything that had happened. And how he had been turned down by a certain someone. It was just dinner, would it have been so bad to share a meal together? Yeah, people were going to look and his friends were going to fill him with questions but so what? It was just dinner and they could both say it was to ensure peace among themselves and the other students, to start something new after the war.
"Lucius, I think he loves him"
"I don't care, Potter"
"What?"
"Potter, I'm truly sorry" McGonagall spoke, and he blinked twice not understanding what was going on. Was everyone being vague and weird to confuse him? "This sort of... Occurrences shouldn't keep happening to you inside the school"
"Let us go" Harry moved his hand, feeling the magical restraints keeping him in place. He couldn't see them, but it felt as if heavy iron chains were hugging all of his limbs. He suspected Draco felt the same way.
"You missed dinner"
"I just think it was... a bit rude to say what she said"
"Perhaps" She stopped and turned to him "I think he fears you"
Draco crossed his arms while they left, leaving only four of them in the room. Elliot had kept himself quiet and he had to thank him for that.
"I guess"  Harry imitated him, laying on almost the same position "I don't care about money. I know it's important to live, but I have lived without it most of my life"
Deep down he knew his friends were right, but he just didn't think they were right as to how to fix it. Right now Harry needed to fix things with Draco. He didn't need to go talk to a therapist and he didn't need to fly around the castle. What he needed was to find Draco, and grab him by the shoulders and say sorry. Not only that, but say he is willing to listen to whatever Draco wishes to share. And maybe if they are honest, they can move forward.
"Yeah, I am just... Why are you looking for me?"
"Well,
Draco said nothing else, and Harry felt like he deserved that treatment. They had all agreed to meet after class but before dinner. Hermione was studying in the library, Ron was outside flying with Ginny and Noah and Elliot were at the infirmary for reasons unknown. Harry wasn't sure if he wanted them to arrive or if he wanted more time alone with Draco.
The common room was warm and quite deserted. Hm. Well, it was their second day back from the holidays so surely everyone was catching up and studying or something.
something inside of his brain snapped and made him a complete mess. It just felt so unbelievably
should stay in his father's good graces. And to stay there he should give up an important part of himself. A side he
"What? Potter, no-"
"I don't wish to fight" Harry said softly "you know how I feel about your father, and maybe he won't change, ever. But I do know your mom loves you. Didn't she use to send you sweets all the time?" Draco smiled, but very briefly and very sadly. "Draco, when she knew you were okay.. That's what she asked, you know? When Voldemort had me. She asked if you were alive... When she knew, she didn't care anymore. She bought me time, and if
"I won't hurt you" Harry whispered, pressing a kiss on his shoulder, squeezing him a bit tighter. "You don't have to protect yourself from me"
"Shut up, Potter, I'm not leaving you"
They had gone through the whole set up several times, but he would always zone out. It was so incredibly
"Professor, would you give us a moment?" Harry heard Draco but he didn't quite register it. He even heard McGonagall whisper a resigned 'five minutes'. In any other circumstance he would be shocked but his mind was somewhere far away.
"No, not really" Draco closed his eyes for a moment "Not right now. Do you want to talk about...?"
Draco was looking at him with his piercing grey eyes, not really moving and not really saying anything. It was unnerving, it made something warm creep up Harry's neck and ears.
Harry swallowed as they neared the main entrance of the castle. Would there be guards there?
"Where's the headmistress? We are supposed to see her" Narcissa looked around, hands clutched tightly in front of her dress. Was she trying not to hug Draco? Was she nervous? Or was she enraged and trying not to lash out at them? Harry couldn't tell, and something told him Draco couldn't either.
Draco wanted to curse, but it wasn't such a big deal. It only showed what a mess he was. And there wasn't anyone else to see it.
Harry moved slowly back from him, sitting on the bed and waiting for Draco to do the same. When he did, they both stared at each other, hungry and desperate to jump at each other again.
"Sure"
"Professor"
Potter's motivations as to why he remained close to him were still unclear. The damned Gryffindor probably thought he was planning something. Draco frowned, focusing on the cover details of the book in front of him, Harry didn't seem to be suspicious of him - not all the time, at least. Maybe he truly had an interest...
"Yes... Yes"
Draco arched an eyebrow "You do know who I am, right?" He heard him laugh, and smiled back "I'm not traditional about
Great. Now he was fucking moody. Harry pursed his lips and decided to leave, he didn't know how to deal with Malfoy and honestly he didn't want to. What was the real reason they were playing that game or even going up there? He couldn't trust Malfoy, he couldn't.
"But we are not done talking to him" Narcissa said, placing a hand on his shoulder.
“Everything's fine” He said “We have class with Ravenclaw now, I'll keep an eye on Elliot”
Harry chuckled, this was classic Draco. "Alright, how do you feel?"
Draco swallowed but turned, hating the way the butterflies flapped inside his chest.
Draco almost wanted to smirk, but he didn't like aurors in general, one nice one wasn't going to change that at all.
"Your friend was attacked" Pomfrey hurried towards the bed, wand in hand "Apparently
"Just..?"
How come Slytherins knew about this and not him? A little voice on his head told him
Draco was about two or three strides ahead of him. No. Oh, no. Harry wasn't as arrogant as people assumed Gryffindors were, but he was extremely competitive. There was an enormous satisfaction in winning, but it wasn't just that. It was the thrill of the chase, the exhilaration... And his competitive side was only truly pleased when he was on against Malfoy. There was no doubt in his mind about that.
"Headmistress" Harry tried, but Minerva dismissed him with the rest of the kids. He had to walk away, realizing the kid needed to be taken to the infirmary and they were only making things worse.
Still holding onto the mattress, he used his free hand to help himself. His heart was pounding when he finally pushed his cock inside of Draco. He didn't mean to moan, but he just did, his head pressing against Draco's shoulder. The slytherin, instead, was breathing as slowly as he could, one of his hands digging into Harry's shoulder. Harry couldn't think, his mind felt dazzy for a couple of seconds.
"The aurors, they were having an argument" Harry frowned, trying to remember the most important details "Some of them believe there is no threat, that it was a student. They said they are here to gather evidence and that's that. There's another auror, uhm, can't remember her name. She believes something's off. And she mentioned the seventh floor"
"Sure, Elliot"
"So, we are alone?" Harry said, looking around the room while Draco took off his shoes and got up in his bed.
She stopped and faced him, finding a position where the wind worked with her and moved her hair out of her face.
Draco clenched his teeth, looking at Harry's eyes. Softly but surely he nodded, his whole body tense and ready to run at the first opportunity. Harry didn't expect him to be brave, but he wanted someone to cover his back if anything went wrong.
If that was the Ministry's plan they had succeeded.
missing class, Ron" She kept looking at Harry "Did you go alone?"
but what about what he
"Was he...?"
"We weren't... Doing anything" Harry said, tense. "That guy was being a-... Difficult"
"Hey, Bea. Got a minute?"
"It's just..." He started but trailed off, having no idea how to explain all of this to Malfoy of all people.
Alright, that gave them little time to figure out what had happened but it might be just enough to come up with a plan. Draco was looking at him with an expression that made Harry want to fight against whatever this was. It was weird, feeling like he had a purpose again thanks to Malfoy of all people.
"I-... Good" she whispered, part of her wanting to say it was okay and that he was forgiven but... It was too soon. Just thinking about everything she had lost brought tears to her eyes. She forced a small smile and shifted on the bed, trying to look relaxed.
He knew there was no point to fixate on it, he had the parents he had and he would have to learn to live with that. They had to discuss what had happened, but Draco didn't find the strength inside to do so. He could see the way they were staring, as if they didn't recognize their own son. He was sure his parents didn't know what this meant. He was sure they were wondering if he would marry Astoria, if he would just play along, if this was a simple whim.
"Yes" Draco stared at him, the tip of his quill frozen a couple millimeters over the paper "You?"
On its other end it had a sting, long and sharp enough to kill anyone.
Hermione smiled but her face showed exactly how little she thought that was going to happen "Sure, Harry"
Draco sighed "Because... just don't, please?"
"You, uhm, you too"
She felt as if someone had slapped her. "Of course I care about what he.... What? Are you saying
"Why? Or is it just because?"
"It's not good, mate. Why don't you come over? Mom would love to see you"
lie" That made no sense and Harry was about to say something before he shushed him with a look "I couldn't just lie about everything, and look calm or he would've known I was successfully resisting. I had to tell the truth about everything
Oh. And
Harry grabbed his face between both his hands, smiling and trying to calm himself. The adrenaline was still running through his veins, pumping blood all over his body and making his head not think straight.
Draco smirked for a moment and pressed his face against the fabric of Harry's shirt. "It will be, one day"
Harry wanted to say he wasn't so sure about that, but only nodded. He remembered all the times other people had told him he wasn't actually okay and yeah, it sucked.
"Do you want to call it a night? I'm... not hungry right now"
"Yeah, I-... Acted on impulse?"
"This is not... Up for debate with them"
Draco swallowed but held his gaze, unmoving. So that was what he had meant to ask. Merlin's beard.
"What? What look?"
Harry had promised to go to the movies once he was free, which shouldn't have excited him as much as it did. There was a shining in Harry's eyes when he spoke about muggle London, an excitement that was contagious.
Shit. Harry wasn't sure what to do or to say or how to act in those types of scenarios. No one had taught him.
Their lips moved together, hungry, desperate, while Draco's hands moved up to his head. Harry had never had his hair tugged in that way, but it woke something inside of him. Their lips meeting, clashing, melting into one another and the feeling of Draco's tongue was enough but having his hair tugged like that? His body pressed against his? Harry touched his back, feeling his muscles and rumpling his shirt. It was impossible not to get caught in the moment. Harry pushed him towards the wardrobe, without breaking the kiss because it was giving him everything he needed.
Silence quickly fell between them and neither moved nor made a sound, just letting the minutes go by. It was peaceful, in a way.
"Uh?"
Trying not to pay attention to the knot on his belly -and knowing he had already been seen- he walked towards the table, taking one of the two empty seats. His father closed the newspaper, placing it on the table, before turning towards him.
His thoughts drifted to Ginny whom he had been avoiding for a long time now. It's not that he didn't want to see her, but it was so... awkward and he had no clue how to talk to her anymore and she probably wanted more than he could give. If his friends left he would be all alone with her and no one to buffer between them.
"Those two are having fun, huh?"
"No, he doesn't"
"You okay?" Harry asked, using his wand to create a small amount of lubricant over his hand.
Malfoy seemed to think about it, frowning with his eyes closed but he shook his head "Maybe. I have been in a lot of houses"
the room for him or anything, but that blonde almost white-ish hair was impossible to ignore. And after all those letters the least thing he could do was go say hi. Especially before they reached the castle.
"Besides, it's not that bad"
They had been left alone after Harry and Malfoy decided they should all meet after breakfast to try and find the symbols Noah drew. Of course Elliot noticed how Harry was going to spend the night in the Slytherin's bedroom but didn't comment. What they did or didn't do wasn't something he worried about.
Harry wanted to stay, more than anything, and they both knew it, so he didn't say anything. Instead, he hugged Draco as tightly as he was capable of, knowing he would have to remember the feel of his arms and the warmth of his skin while they were apart. And he wasn't sure how long that would be. If the aurors approved Draco's application, they would be reunited incredibly fast, but if it was declined... Harry didn't want to think about it.
"Well?
I promise my future works (if any!) will be better
"Thank you"
"Oh no. I was sure we were going to die when he realized the blood was fake..."
"Why do you care about our love life? It's not that interesting you know?"
"Did... Did you always...? All this time?"
"I can't do this" Draco frowned, wand in hand. Given that it was exam week, and what they had done, the teachers had allowed Draco to keep it after class. Which meant Harry could finally try and teach him how to make a Patronus.
The paper in front of him was only that: paper, but Harry kept looking at it as if it had all the answers of the Universe. He wondered how long it had took to write and how long it had traveled to find him.
"Oh, no answer? Am I right then?"
"Ballroom dancing. It's... a high society thing. Want to learn?"
"Have you done this sort of thing before?"
It's not that Elliot hadn't tried to hear what they were saying, but his mind was completely focused on Noah and how... bad he was. He had tried to say something, but his eyes had been wild and he spoke complete nonsense...
"She's just a victim"
"Do it" Harry said, and pushed past her with Draco in tow. It felt good.
"I am starving" He said, and sat down next to his friends with a smile. Both Hermione and Ron were extremely pleased with how he was behaving lately and... He was as well. Nothing had changed, not really, but perhaps all he needed was time. Time to heal.
She frowned and crossed her arms, slightly offended. "Fine"
Draco laughed, those had been easier times. They had been so young and he had tried to convince himself that perhaps he would love her someday.
"You are really good, Harry" She moved a bit closer and placed a kiss on his cheek "You don't deserve to be alone right now..." She smiled and grabbed his arm again "Let's sit by the lake?"
Draco nodded and frowned for a moment, the name... "What does it mean?"
When they rolled up his sleeve and his white bandage came to view, still hiding away his biggest regret, he started to truly panic.
"What the fuck do you think you are doing?" Malfoy's cold bored voice pierced through the air and the chatter was subdued to slow whispers, everyone paying attention to them now. Fuck. Why did he have to go and make a big deal about it?
"Hermione and I... We have been talking about it. About you" Ugh. Harry tried not to be mad, but he was stressed and confused and talking of himself wasn't exactly something he enjoyed.
"Are you sure? I've had a lot of bad ideas"
There was something in the way he said it that started the same
"Of course... hidden in plain sight, inside the one classroom with an aloof professor. Smart of you" He paused for a brief moment, looking past them “Go get it. Now” Harry could hear Bea's steps getting further and further away from them. He almost wanted to ask her to stay, but he didn't.
make a copy, right?"
"Have
"And why on Earth would he do that?"
"Last time Cedric died" Harry was thankful he didn't have to say it himself.
he had tried to avoid for months. Living with Harry terrified him because it was the
"Do you know Andromeda?"
first. Besides, he knew the aurors were supposed to come in any moment.
The Aurors kept staring at them, and barely nodded when their names were called out. Harry didn't feel exactly safe at the moment, but at least they wouldn't have to see them all the time. Right?
At least his essay was done -not perfect as he wanted it, but kissing Harry had seemed much more interesting than getting that extra grade.
"Yes. And because... You don't deserve to be locked away. What good would it do?"
"Then we need to find the one who truly did this... Or an iron-clad alibi"
"So, your
Harry seemed baffled by his words, opening and closing his mouth for a few moments without a word coming out of it.
"No, there isn't... Look, I appreciate what you are doing" Draco sighed and sat up, pulling at his tie to undo it "But some things won't change simply because we want them to. You friend can feel the way that he feels and he is right"
"But weren't you two friends?"
Draco smiled and nodded "Boring birds, really"
the blinds, just in case.
Harry nodded, walking with him back to the train compartment where his friends were sitting. Weirder things had happened before right? Malfoy sitting with them for the rest of the way wasn't completely mental... Or so he hoped.
Draco breathed in once, and then pulled away just enough to start uncovering his arm. Sometimes he forgot how many bandages he used. Was he really that ashamed? The realization made him duck his head a bit more, hurrying the process.
"Sometimes"
a lie?"
Draco wanted to say something, to tease him, but Harry was almost immediately on top of him again, the blanket tangled between their bodies. He yanked it to cover them again, pulling at Draco's pants, leaning back to take them off. Draco had half imagined he was going to take his own pants but Harry pulling at them was more arousing than he imagined. He kicked to help him, pulling at him from the back of his neck so they could kiss again. Their bodies were touching and there was so much skin and not enough at the same time.
"I think our bedroom should be upstairs"
Harry seemed to perk up at that, looking at him like he did when he was about to kiss him. Oh, Draco's heart skipped a beat when he saw him staring like that.
Did this mean they were boyfriends? Oh, fuck. Harry wasn't sure he was ready for that. His hands started to sweat as they walked towards Gryffindor Tower, his mind on his friends and everyone that knew them and... Maybe kissing him had been an impulse reaction.
"C'mon, stop feeling pity for yourself and go see him. I'm sure it's simple?"
"Do you know how many reporters are in here? " He tried to sound as if he didn't care, but his voice trembled and he took a sip from his champagne.
"Draco!" Harry screamed, throwing his wand to the other side and Draco caught it in the air. Thank God they were both seekers.
“You are late”
They both walked backwards towards the door, pressing themselves against the wall to avoid the falling debris and the dust.
"Mr. Potter, I would advise you to keep better company"
"Elliot" Noah said, placing a hand on his friends' arm "I think these are all very good points. We can't just trust them. But we can't accuse them. Actually, they weren't even here when you were attacked... but they could've been working from the outside"
He had gone up there to face his own demons, he had gone up there because his own bedroom felt small and crowded and even though he had never minded small and crowded places, right now he needed to be alone. Maybe the war had changed him beyond repair.
"About?"
They both had ditched class, but only Draco was the guilty one? No surprise Draco was so uncomfortable around aurors all the time.
“Harry, you will have the honor to assist me” He said, as if speaking to a crowd. There was a reason why he was picking him and not Malfoy, and it had nothing to do with their abilities. He wanted to hurt Draco, he wanted to break him.
And now Draco was truly in pain, sweating and staring around the room as if trying to find a way to fight it. Harry knew he was good at occlumency, they had talked about it but perhaps the pull of the serum was too much on his mind. Still, betraying his family was something Draco would never do. Not willingly.
"Tomorrow morning?"
"Comments? What kind?"
“Ginny? What are you doing here?” Ron wasn't going to like this.
interesting was eavesdropping on the conversations happening around them. Someone had whispered:
The auror laughed at him "Young love, truly adorable" He got up, walking across the room and opening some strange books. "Don't worry, even if he manages to resist... I'll still get my way. I have done so this far, have I not?" He chuckled "Did you know I was stationed in Bea's house after the war? A lovely family, they really trusted me with their daughter"
"Did you know him? You look very... Worried"
"I faked it"
Had Draco seen all that? Did he know how it felt? To any extent? He closed his eyes, a hand on Draco's back, pulling him close to his body.
"Draco... If you have to stay with them I'll visit. Alright? Don't say no" Harry pressed their foreheads together, closing his eyes "We will find a way. If anyone can find a way, it's us"
"Hey, Potter. Need anything?"
Harry blinked and looked over at Ron who was frowning and clearly worried. Why did he have to be so worried about him?
"Aw, not even a couple walls?"
wanted that.
"You are sick... You are disgusting" Harry felt a heat on his cheek and then a sharp pain when Bell slapped him. It wasn't the most painful thing he had endured but it shut him up... What if he decided to hurt Draco instead? He couldn't have that.
"He was... Worried"
"So that Room did something impossible. And?"
"What?"
Draco chuckled, and it was such a sweet laugh that Harry looked up from his position, smiling back. The things he was feeling... Perhaps they were just ideas his mind had. Boys experiment all the time, right? Especially in boarding schools, right? He could be normal. Just like all the other boys. What had happened didn't have to mean anything. It could have been just a game, a slip, a mistake.
Going back to the Castle he couldn't risk taking his hand, simply couldn't and Harry looked so troubled anyway. Had something gone horribly wrong? Draco feared the only reason Harry hadn't push him away was pity.
Lucius frowned thinking that no, he hadn't known but perhaps his wife was right -as she usually was. Narcissa could see he was too stressed and tired to keep talking, so she pressed herself next to him, resting her head on his shoulder.
? "Some things have happened. The attacks and... all of that, and it's just... it's better this way" Yeah, there wasn't really a good explanation as to why he wanted to sleep next to Draco. Well, there
The part that scared him the most was not wanting to pull Harry away from his friends and family, he wanted him to have all that. But he was sure they wouldn't accept him. How could they? After everything that had happened.
Harry felt his world turn for a brief second. "What do you mean?"
"Darling-"
"You are worrying me, Harry"
"What about Hogsmeade? Wouldn't this be a second date?" Harry widened his eyes for a brief moment, so that
"And Mr. Potter... I took the liberty of informing Mrs Weasley of your well being"
Draco woke with all of his muscles hard as rocks, the giant snake still fresh on his mind. His nightmares were always different, and the theme this week was that stupid fucking snake. His lips were dry and his sheets wet from his sweat but he had not screamed, he hadn't even tousled his blankets. He had learned the hard way it wasn't good to show weakness.
"He's just mad about... He will be fine"
" The boy sneered at him, just a few steps away from him.
"No" Draco simply said "I think not"
of them"
Harry knew he should be thankful she was still the same.
"And why's that?" Draco arched an eyebrow, trying to decode what was going on in her head. "Are we that popular?"
So instead of going to their meeting place -Harry had slipped him a note during Potions- he walked to the second floor bathroom. It was risky going there again,
"No" Narcissa opened her eyes and stared at him "No, son. There's too much in between-..."
Ever since the moment they got there, Bell had seemed in complete control of the situation. Right then things seemed to change. Harry knew the moment he needed was approaching, so he readied his body to jump, to run towards his wand.
"You need not worry about him. We are well"
The auror seemed confused "We have all the papers if you wish to join our forces, Mr. Potter. It would be the Ministry's-"
"Use a water resistant spell on our socks, Potter. Trust me on this"
"I-... Thank you"
"Oh, that's where you are wrong. I'll do it all and I'll have fun doing so" He pulled a chair, the loud and abrupt noise startling Draco who, Harry suspected, would be shivering or incredibly tense if he weren't restricted by magic. The auror turned the chair around and sat, crossing his arms over the back of the chair, staring at both of them like an innocent child. Harry tried not to feel scared, he had gone through worse, right?
The only reason why Noah wasn't in the Infirmary, according to Pomfrey, was because the aurors had the whole wing closed up and were both interrogating and keeping watch over Bea. Apparently they all thought it had been an attempted suicide and she couldn't be left alone.
"It's okay, we are trying to find out"
Draco knew that. But he didn't like being vulnerable.
"Want to share?"
about that "It's fine, unless she gives me
"Obviously"
"Mother loves her sisters"
The morning was breaking all around them. The sun turning the leaves golden, birds singing and flying above. There even was a bit of dampness in the air from the night's dew. After everything that had happened, the days flew by. Harry had no idea how exam week had come so fast, which meant that they only had a week and a couple days to be together. Once all the tests were done, they would get their grades and be done with school. It felt strange
"No, not like walking" Draco stopped him and made him move one feet first "Alright, a bit like walking. It's a 1, 2, 3"
She seemed surprised at the question and shrugged, starting to walk with him towards their common room. "No clue" her hand touched his and... It surely was an accident? Harry felt uncomfortable so he hid his hands in his pockets. Much better.
"Yeah, but you study everything about it" He looked at her, she was brilliant, absolutely brilliant. Merlin, if Ron ever treated her wrongly he would kill him "And I have been meaning to ask..."
"You know why"
"Not for you"
Harry was about to have lunch when he found out. The whole morning had gone without any type of trouble. He had followed his friends, kept some tabs con Beatrice -who seemed to have an extremely boring life- and waited for the time to meet Draco to go explore the castle. They had decided to look for abandoned rooms, Draco suspected that if the attacker planned to do this sort of magic ritual, he would have a place set up for it.
She nodded and after giving Draco a small glance, she focused on the clouds and the night sky above Hogwarts. They should be helping Harry and Ron, they both should be outside and yet, here they were. Inside. Useless.
Harry left the office knowing there was only one person that could help him make sense of all of that.
"Care to explain?" Harry blurted out, standing up and letting the blanket they had placed on his shoulders fall to the floor. He didn't mean to be dramatic, but he didn't understand what had happened and it felt as if everyone was lying and hiding stuff.
It had been truly terrible, sitting there with all of those wizards giving him disapproving looks even after he had saved them all. He remembered showing up at Narcissa and Draco's trials because... well, because it wasn't fair for them to be judged like everyone else. He hadn't slept that day and his mind was foggy from the battle but people didn't care, didn't know. The only one that looked as jagged as he was had been Draco, sitting there and looking way too thin.
"Funny" Harry frowned, extremely annoyed. "I remember someone telling me that years ago, and you know what? He was quite wrong. So if you excuse us..."  Harry grabbed at Draco's arm with the whole intention of just leaving, but she didn't move.
Harry laughed, giving him a squeeze. "Fine, fine... I'll tone it down for your sensibility"
Draco had insisted on going up there with him, and he had been staring at his owl for a while without saying a word.
"I followed you all of sixth ye-"
"Yes. Can we talk?" There was a small sigh, and she pointed at the empty space on the sofa. He gladly took it. "I'm sorry for what I said"
"I know you have been inside the room of Requirement. Not only that, but you and Malfoy went to Hogsmeade without permission, something the School's wards shouldn't allow. I know there are students waltzing into other Houses without any trouble, or girls getting inside the boys' dormitories" Harry coughed, thinking if Hermione would be in trouble for this. Somehow he doubted it, McGonagall seemed to have a soft spot for his friend "The school was built with ancient magic, Harry, there are still echoes of it all around and still... We have been researching, with the ministry, ever since the War but haven't found anything concrete. The school magic is failing"
"I know it's hard being here"
"Let's keep going. I'm sure we'll be out of here and... we will make it back to the Tower"
"Yeah?"
"All of your friends are fucking snitches" Draco said, but his tone was defeated.
"It is... Especially in front of you"
"I just want to be left alone..."
"You did? But I am wearing..."
"... Why?"
Defeated, they made their way back to the Tower. It was getting late and nothing was going to come of it. The aurors were still running up and down the castle, blocking important places they could go. And Harry was still unsettled by the chat they had had with the new 'victim'.
"Yeah?"
"Fuck
It made him laugh.
“My little sister? Harry, listen-”
"I had to talk to her, Potter"
"Oh, I have my ways"
"Yes"
"Oh, it's Celtic. Related to a goddess of War or something" He shrugged "Mothers, right?"
"Sure thing"
"Mh?" Harry felt his eyes heavy and he almost wanted to take a nap right there on the floor, with his head still resting on Draco's chest.
"How did it go?"
"We didn't lose him"
Lucius nodded, hands behind his back, eyes on some undefined spot in the garden.
Harry hated Bell for this. There was no way in which Draco wouldn't blame himself. If he spoke, he would hate himself for betraying his family's secrets, and if he didn't he would probably hate himself for whatever pain Bell inflicted on Harry.
Harry moved his head to the side, finding Draco's shape away from both of them. Bell was too distracted to pay attention to them, and Draco seemed to know it because he was talking to Bea. He could see his tone was desperate and his gaze intense. She was giving him worried looks.
"Nice?" They both chuckled, and took a sip from their cups. The kitchen was the most used space, so it was the cleanest but it wasn't anywhere near done. There were too many rooms in that house, too much dust and memories.
Hufflepuff's common room was quite different than his own, and it was clear the house valued human interaction and team work since every piece of furniture seemed to be made to fit several people. At times he felt out of place, but Noah felt the same. So it was fine.
"I just..." Harry mumbled and then sighed "We've talked a bit, that's all." Well, that wasn't completely true but it was close enough. Hermione didn't have to know everything. "And what happened... Look, I know it sounds crazy and I didn't want to talk to you or Ron about it because you were going to think I was going mental"
There was silence, everyone reading and passing papers when Harry noticed something strange in the report.
"I'm sorry... I... Will support you in any way that I can, if anything bad happens"
Draco walked to the garden, knowing he would find at least one of his parents there. He had hoped to find his mother. He wasn't so lucky.
Harry didn't know if he had hit his head or if Draco was speaking a different language but he wasn't being clear. Not at all "You... Faked...?"
"Yes. They do" Draco frowned "My actions during sixth year? I hurt... A student, I lied, I got Death Eaters inside Hogwarts. I plotted to murder your
"Do you really think t-they m-miss me?" She asked, looking at him like a little child.
Bell seemed a bit surprised at his words "My family was pure blood just like yours, it can be hard"
to happen
He thought about going back to his bedroom, still trying to understand everything that had happened that day
"Jesus Christ, Bea, I know"  Elliot gave her a hard stare "But there is only one path out to the main doors!"
He laughed again, and he didn't feel tense at all. Harry wondered if he was handling all of this better than expected. After all, he hadn't been inside the room after Draco's parents saw them. Maybe they had been harsh but not horrible? Draco said they didn't talk about it, and Harry was pretty sure both Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy were extremely relieved to see their son. He hoped some of that relief allowed them to be sweet to Draco, instead of cold. Somehow he doubted it, but of course, he had no clue about rich families or pure blood wizards. Perhaps a pat on the back was enough for them. Somehow, feeling Draco's grip on him, he doubted it.
They would be spending Christmas with the Weasleys, and Harry had somehow managed to get Molly to agree to let them spend Christmas' eve's night there. Draco wasn't sure how or why he was included in the invitation but if this meant a normal Christmas for Harry then he would do it.
"Why?"
"You and I... I don't know how long this will last... And I'm not used to being so open with someone... I wanted to regain some control over this"
The bookcases were so tall they couldn't see where the hallways lead, they had no way of knowing if there was a way out or if they were going the right way.
Harry was suddenly very aware of everyone in the room. Draco was glaring at him. McGonagall was smiling. Jane was waiting for an answer. He wanted to disappear into himself.
"Here you go" Harry finally appeared, at the worst possible time. "Hello, Narcissa. Lucius"
"Your boyfriend does not deserve to be... Kept in the shadows"
He was about to let his mind wander off when the conversation shifted.
"Pick a topic?"
"Good... My roommates won't be in my room tonight, so we don't have to worry too much"
"Father placed a charm to make the pond not freeze during winter"
"Sucks" Draco whispered, closing his eyes and staying very still. "Have you tried sleeping potions?"
There was a small smile on Draco's lips that said
Draco moved his fingers over Harry's but said nothing else. Had he heard his nightmare? Did he care? Harry closed his eyes and hugged him tighter, not really wanting to hold back. He... Had needed to touch someone. To be hugged. And his mind was foggy with sleep.
"No, he doesn't. He hasn't seen what the public will think of this, or his friends, or 'our' friends. And if we support this... This
in passing. It almost felt as if his private life was out there in the open for people to speculate again. He hated it. Of course it was all gossip, and until that day they had handled it without any problems. Even Draco had seemed relaxed about it, telling him that people would always gossip and it would die down.
and he had done some changes in his wardrobe but... some choices were bigger than others.
"Grimmauld needs a lot of work. We could work on it together... You would have something to do" Draco seemed conflicted, and as nervous as he felt. "Look, don't answer right now... Promise you will think about it?"
kiss a Weasley"
"Draco"
At times he wondered how Voldemort had been unable to murder such a stupid child, but then again Voldemort hadn't been enough. It didn't matter. At least he had done something: the Ministry was pure chaos, Hogwarts was unprotected and his plan was coming along perfectly.
Draco smirked, and moved a bit closer, cuddling against him. Harry was sure he was just reaching for his body heat.
"Potter, it was b-"
Harry wanted to keep reading and reading the letter, trying to find all those little details... But he also wanted to answer, quickly. They only had a few more long days - and New Years- before coming back...
"Oh, I am livid"
"This doesn't look like necromancy but it could be. Anything could be with this type of thing"
. Shit. The
"Shh" Draco shushed with a smile, understanding what he meant. "Here" He pulled Harry's pants down, allowing the Gryffindor to do the rest on his own. A soft laugh escaped him when Harry almost had to sit back to do it, frowning as if frustrated with the fabric.
or just the
Harry still had trouble picking things for himself, most of the time delegating those responsibilities to Draco which, in turn, caused some friction between them. Nothing that a cup of tea and a long night in front of the fireplace couldn't fix.
"Probably"
"It's just... I don't know" Harry sighed "I guess I... have a lot on my mind?"
Malfoy chuckled and threw himself on the bed, half sitting. "Sure, Potter. Merlin, can you relax? It's not so bad. At least she didn't mention Elliot. Clearly she has no idea what we are doing" He looked down to his hands, playing softly with the crumpled sheets.
"Did you think about... Becoming an auror?"
"Kind of"  Harry felt a bitter taste inside his mouth, and wondered how much to tell Draco. Maybe being honest about that part of his life would make it better. Or maybe it would make it worse. Harry closed his eyes. " My aunt and uncle had money, they just hated me"
Harry tried to deflect that subject, still unsure as to how he would take seeing the mark on his body. Everything was too raw.
Harry felt like that was a lie.
"Yes. Since the rain... I wanted to touch you right there" Harry pulled off his shirt, lowering his kissed all through his chest. There were scars there, that made him insecure but Harry just kissed them and made it all better. It was strange, feeling so vulnerable and insecure and
future for my family, so don't talk about my future as if you
"See you later?"
Harry took two deep breaths and started walking through the hallway, it was strange being surrounded by a room that felt so alive. The path ahead opened up to the sides and Harry decided for the both of them: they would go left.
"Let's find the way out, please"
"Thank you for joining us"
Draco arched an eyebrow.
"No, I guess you don't." He sighed "Mother was worried for my well-being. Apparently Father is not taking the house arrest very well and-"
"Of course I'll teach you"
"Well, it's almost time for lunch and... why not?"
"Draco...?"
After finishing up with the plants and whatever the subject was, Harry dragged himself to the Great Hall to get something to eat, to his bedroom to change into something more comfortable for their free hours, and then back to the Great Hall to see if he could catch Draco there.
She nodded "Still, your methods were commendable. With training you would be excellent. I will put a good word for you. I am aware the department would be delighted to have you... But if you wish to train with someone who won't cuddle you, I can give you some recommendations"
"So, you had a lot of practice?"
"I know"
"The next weekend is the last trip to Hogsmeade, maybe you two can do something then?"
Hermione didn't seem upset about it, yeah, probably because she was going to be safe inside the girl's room while he was going to be right next to Malfoy. Merlin. Was Harry going to
"Nothing, I-..." He shook his head and looked around. Harry wasn't pushing -which was nice- but he wanted... Draco enjoyed talking to him. Being honest in a way he had been to no one else.
"Sorry"
Picking a place to meet had been hard, but they had finally agreed that the Potions' classroom was the ideal location. It was secluded, people didn't linger there long and if they were caught, well, Slughorn wouldn't really make a fuss. Still, being in there knowing Snape was dead was hard. Harry wasn't sure what to think about him. He... didn't hate him as much, but he hadn't had time to process anything yet.
"You guess?"
"We have a pond at the Manor"
"Why, yes, you are" She smiled back, "at least in some circles"
He reached for the letter and the owl gave it without much of a fuss. It was an elegant little thing, it reminded him of her.
A pang of guilt struck him, Malfoy wasn't that bad to think of him that way.
His eyes moved to his arm, no one could say he was Marked when he wore clothes, but it was there, right under his sleeve and the bandage he had so carefully placed. He knew that if Harry ever caught as much as a glimpse of it, their truce would go to hell and he'd be back in Potter's blacklist. Well, it was only fair, wasn't it?
that was bothering him as much as everything else.
Harry looked at his friends, both of them with determined looks. It was talking without words, in a way. He didn't want Draco to feel left out, but some things would never change and Harry didn't want them to.
"You are free to do whatever you wish to, Harry, I don't-"
again. He wanted to be the boy that saved the world and liked Ginny and would become an Auror. That was supposed to be his story, right?
There was something inside his mind that told him both Molly Weasley and Draco were right, he wasn't right in the head and he should ask for help. But there was something else, a strange fear -no, a terror- that told him not to do something foolish like that. So instead, he remained on this strange limbo where things felt like too much or nothing at all.
He had no clue if that was a good thing to say, but it got him a small sad chuckle from the blonde so it was worth it.
why you wanted a son?"
There was another silence, -because everything between them seemed to happen in between silences- until a low familiar voice spoke.
They made the rest of the way in silence, a nice one, being there for each other without having to say or do anything. It felt good, it felt as if he wasn't alone anymore. Or at least not like before.
then I
"The one thing? Oh Harry, you aren't all that smart are you? And what are you going to do without your dear friend? I'm sure she was the smart one" He stared at Draco and ran a hand through his hair, the touch made Harry's blood boil "Or maybe this one could help you. You know? I would enjoy breaking his mind"
Draco looked back at him, almost at a loss. It was hard seeing him like this, disconnected from his emotions. Harry was sure he had more than one good, happy memory, but somehow Draco seemed unable to find them.
"Merlin, it wasn't a real question. Ah, well, I guess it's the serum. Fantastic little thing, isn't it? Honesty is so important. Especially in a relationship. Bea tells me everything. She's such a good girl"
Neville frowned at his weirdness and Harry hoped he wouldn't mention it.
"Oh. Uh, uhm. I guess. But I meant... you know, sex
"Alright, care to tell him what you told me?"
"Nah, it's alright. I don't know if I'm any good at it" Oh, but he was. Harry leaned forward and planted a kiss on his cheek, making Draco lean back and turn slightly so they could kiss.
Draco rubbed a hand over one of his eyes and pulled the covers away, getting up as fast as he could, trying not to hurt all over. He only needed to do one thing at a time: get up, walk downstairs, get a drink, get back to the bed. It was late anyways, he should be sleeping.
The scene was as gruesome as before, and the smell of fresh blood intoxicated the whole air around it. Harry tried not to remember the war and the piles of bodies...
"I don't think... That's possible, Harry. I mean..." he swallowed and tried to speak but Harry kissed him once, and then again. Short dry kisses, almost pleading kisses. He was asking.
And yes, bad days had come, and he had isolated himself inside their bed. Harry had been a great sport though, kissing his head and letting him sleep all morning until he was ready to come down or take a shower. He gave him space, and Draco accepted it gladly. Surprisingly, in the end, he found himself wanting to be near Harry. It was a bad day, but being near him made it not so bad.
The one thing that
"I... I don't really know how to"
Finding a way to be together and still be who they were had been tricky, but they had agreed on having at least one meal alone together per week, and the rest of the days they would take turns dining on the Gryffindor or Slytherin table. The nights were equally complicated, with Draco wanting to abide by the rules and have them sleeping on their separate beds. Some nights were different though, and they found their way into each others' arms. Those were Harry's favorites.
"You will be burnt from the family tree, son"
"Alone"
handle the weather?"
"Hey"
"I believe you" Harry said, looking at him still not casting the spell.
He turned once he left the great hall and found himself face to face with Neville. Harry wanted to cry from frustration.
Neville seemed pleased with his answers so he went back to his work. They stayed there for a couple of hours, until both of them were exhausted and Draco's arm ached from copying down the notes. They shared a small "thanks" and got up from the table. Draco was probably going to keep reading once he got to his bed -sleeping wasn't easy anyways.
What was going on? Harry felt something squeezing at his chest and his brain trying to figure out exactly what he felt. The answers were terrifying, so much so he was unable to see it.
"School. Hogwarts. Do you think...?"
"I'm sorry, Elliot. He has hurt a lot of people. I wish I could fix it"
work"
"No, I'll stay" Draco mumbled, focusing on the book he had in front of himself, Harry could see his eyelids closing for more than a few seconds at a time.
It was a simple question, demanding a simple answer but he didn't have one. So he shrugged.
"Okay" Draco dragged a chair and sat in front of him "It doesn't have to be right now, but... one day?"
Harry frowned.
"Potter...? There is something I haven't told you"
Ouch. Draco tried not to seem too worried about it, so he shrugged with one shoulder. "Thank you"
Draco chuckled and tilted his head back to stare at him "How was your morning?"
"Recovering quickly, his parents are coming tonight. Please, everyone should act as if nothing had happened"
"We should go" Draco's voice was hoarse, and... it also
"No" Harry could
Draco barely moved his head saying 'no'.
"Yes"
"Almost"
"Y-yeah, saw him leaving McGonagall's office. I don't know if someone used his wand or something but Elliot had humiliated him a couple days before and then..."
Malfoy jumped back, almost as if he had been hurt or burnt and Harry felt an immense wave of shame and regret. Had this changed things? Of course it had. Harry wasn't stupid. Or maybe he was. Fuck.
"And with magic"
His eyes opened, and he smiled "I'll try"
"Yeah, you think?" Harry looked around. The room had never hurt anyone. Why was it doing it now? "Let's find the door again"
Malfoy looked over at him, shifting slightly on the bed "Aha"
"You could lose a lot, Astoria. I can't ask this of you..."
Draco smiled, he couldn't help himself, and felt Harry's hand on his hip.
"And that's enough?"
"Ideas? About?"
Narcissa Malfoy carefully folded the letter with the Hogwarts crest on it, and got up from her desk to go find her husband. The house they were living in had all the appropriate commodities and it was situated in a beautiful wizard town in France. It was everything anyone could have asked of a vacation. Of course, this was house arrest and trying to find something to keep her mind occupied was proving harder and harder.
There was another kiss, intimate, a kiss that they would never do in public. A kiss that was for them alone.
Harry grumbled, maybe he would have. Maybe being punched would make him feel something, anything. And yet...the thought of punching Malfoy and leaving marks on his body did not sit well with him.
Hermione got up, dragging Ron behind "We'll leave you two alone" They didn't even bothered waiting for an answer. With the passing of the days, his friends had grown used to their new dynamic, to the way he interacted with Draco... And they had grown used to Malfoy as well.
"I guess I don't"
With a glance towards Draco he knew it would be bad. He didn't quite care if they spoke shit about him, but they would speak ill about
" Draco said, feeling something take over, his heart pounding but not drowning out his thoughts. Adrenaline pumping through his whole body "So you want to talk about our blood and family... Let's" He ignored the way his father was about to speak, probably to stop him. Oh, it was too late "Let's talk about it, mother. How about Andromeda, the sister you don't see anymore because she married the wrong man? True, you kept in touch for longer than anyone would believe, but not long enough. Her child is dead and you still won't-...!" He breathed in, finding all the things he had inside and hadn't known how to say. All the questions, the doubts, the anger "And let's talk, mother, about my cousin. Your niece, murdered by your other sister. The crazy one? Oh, but her blood was pure, of course" He got up, unable to just sit there. He was tired of pretending that everything was alright "Or maybe we should talk about Regulus Black? I know what he truly did, I
Everything had to be fine.
"Nothing, we were leaving"
"I think every single move I make ahead of time" Malfoy crossed his legs under his body "I fancy Pansy" He smirked at his own rhyme "Being here is not so bad"
There was a long pause while they both ate, not really looking at each other.
"See you, Potter"
Harry thought,
Draco shook his head, clearly terrified "Maybe it will stop on its own!"
Once upon a time he had been more than capable of maintaining a conversation with his father, but not right now. He didn't feel strong enough, or as controlled as he had once been.
Draco chuckled "This is fine. It's just that your friend is sleeping right there?"
He left the living room, knowing they would be sitting down for diner in a little while and decided to search the house for Draco.
"Yeah, I guess. Do you think she knows about us and Elliot?"
Her expression softened for a few seconds and nodded, looking down to her papers again.
"Myrtle, I just want to help..."
He had been 14 years old. He never thought that Cedric would...
"You are spontaneous, I like it"
She shrugged "I wasn't going to leave you here alone, not with what's going on"
"Extremely old. Like... pre-wand era"
They kept quiet the rest of the class, Ron being the only one taking notes at all. Which really showed how bad Harry was doing, or feeling, or both. The teachers didn't care. Or maybe they did but thought they should go
"I just... It's not so simple" Draco crossed his arms, resting against one of the stone pillars. "I don't want to influence you"
"It's not that, you stupid snake!"
Pomfrey glared at him "
They both stared at each other. Harry wanted to be angry, but he felt sad and guilty for screaming the other night instead of saying how sad and weird he felt. "Alright... I will"
She wailed, flying across the room and disappearing behind a stall. Draco felt extremely confused and frustrated. How could he fail such a simple task?
"Yeah, I guess so" his tone was sad.
"Thank you, my love" She said, thinking of how to write all of that to Draco. The aurors would read her letter, and she had to be careful.
The house seemed to be eerily quiet as the day before. No aurors in the house that morning, that was good. They came and went, Draco knew some were stationed outside, or making sure the wards kept them inside but he couldn't care less about them. As long as they kept their distance, he would do everything he could to tune their presence out.
Bell smiled and shook his head "Don't worry about it, Draco. It's Aeron"
Draco didn't stop, clearly having found his rhythm. Instead, he moaned and Harry felt the vibrations all over his skin, all around him. Suddenly it was too much, and he was too weak to keep holding back. Too weak.
"Thank you... For doing all of this" Draco finally spoke, moving a bit closer to the other boy. It was easy to forget they wouldn't be able to have this level of intimacy in the following days.
Harry felt calm.
"What did you just say,
Everyone's eyes were on Draco and it clearly made him a bit self conscious but he didn't allow that to stop him.
And so the days passed and no owl came. Back at school he would always have someone around, or hear voices in the hallways or in the common room. But in his own place? There was no one there other than himself, no one to talk to, no one to bother him. After the war, he thought that was exactly what he would want, but he wasn't so sure anymore. What was the point of getting up if there is nothing there?
"No, it's not. But thank you, Hermione"
They laughed again in the darkness of the room, where no one could see or disturb them.
Harry turned, his wand barely illuminating a couple of meters ahead of himself. He could see two shapes, and his heart almost stopped. Feeling powerless wasn't something he enjoyed, and seeing someone he loved in a situation like this was... one of his worst nightmares.
There was some movement and the rustle of the sheets and he realized Draco was touching himself. It hit him harder than he expected, his whole body shivering.
"Yes" Draco seemed annoyed and yet he was being honest. Did he feel like he owed that to her? He probably did, and she wasn't going to waste the opportunity.
Draco had tried not to be bored but he wasn't being included in the conversation, not exactly. He had decided to follow Harry around, partly because he
"What?"
"Yeah, sure..." The boy stared at the two of them but shrugged, walking to the great hall.
"And I know my brother is giving you a hard time... but don't be angry. It's been hard, for all of us" She looked down, hiding her hands on her pockets "Ron needs his best friend as much as you might need him. And you are pushing everyone away. I'm not trying to be mean, and it's fine if you need your space... just... think about that next time, yeah?"
Well, his lips weren't getting blue-ish.
"No. I went with Draco"
Draco crossed his arms, looking away from him. They didn't have much more garden to walk around in, so he simply stopped. There were a couple benches outside, but he wasn't going to sit there to have a heart to heart with his father
"I'll shut up when you give me a good reason as to why you are avoiding me. You breaking us up?"
"I need time to... sort myself out"
"Sure"
know what you are talking about"
Draco hadn't forgotten about his horrible day, but talking to her made him cheer up. He couldn't change the things he had done, the people he had supported or the beliefs he had had, but he could start making amends.
Lightning rippled through the sky and a loud thunder sounded off in the distance a few moments later. Students started to scatter off, running back to the Castle. Maybe they should do the same.
"Good"
"What do you mean?" Draco raised his eyebrows in confusion, staring at him until something clicked. Harry tugged at the fabric of his trousers, trying to stay calm. "You are talking about what he asked me... About us?"
the castle. So if he was inside the castle but he wasn't in the map...
"I think... I think..."
"He is" She paused "the heir of house Black and house Malfoy" A little smile crept up on her face as she slipped back into the bed "He's everything we hoped for, Lucius..."
Would they ever understand it wasn't a choice?
"Sorry"
"He's around, don't worry about it" She placed a hand on his arm, standing next to him and looking around the room. It was filled with good looking people, some he knew, most of them complete strangers. On the other side, Harry looked nervous as he waited for two drinks to be made for him. Draco wanted to walk to him, place a hand on his back and let him know that everything was alright. That they were alright.
Guilt squeezed the air out of his lungs and he had to press himself against one of the hallway's walls, trying to recover his breath and not have a complete meltdown. He owed Draco to be... to save him. Right?
"Astoria, what...?"
be. It had opened his eyes, and he knew how much it hurt Noah when someone used the wrong name. The one Elliot had almost forgotten by now.
"Of course I do!" she hastily picked up her pile of books, hurrying to a table nearby "What are you reading?"
Draco's expression softened "Yes"
Harry rolled his eyes, pressing his back to the wall and pulling part of the blankets Malfoy had monopolized. The slytherin gave him a look that said 'no' but Harry didn't give in, pulling the blankets until at least their legs were covered.
"Later? I want to..." And he moved closer, burying his face in Harry's neck, his hands going up to his hair, fingers lost in it.
"It's not entirely true"
Harry looked at him, and realization hit him. When he first met Draco's parents, he had immediately thought of Draco as a small Lucius. But right now? He could see the truth. Draco was more like his mother than his father. He was cunning, ambitious, misguided -but not evil-, and warm. Harry wondered if Draco realized this. If he realized how much he had in common with Narcissa. Had Lucius noticed it as well? Was that why he was so hard on Draco?
He got to do that at Hogwarts though. Quidditch, and practice and just... having his friends around. Merlin, he was so alone now. He was so old. He wasn't, but he felt like he was. So incredibly old.
"Bea, listen this is important" Elliot didn't want to be harsh. Or maybe he did. "Did you see
There was a small laugh from the other bed "Yeah, pretty much." Noah had taught him a whole lot about the muggle world, and about gender and sexuality. He had no idea that muggles had words for everything or how... Fluid everything
Apparently, housing a Ministry's prisoner wasn't as simple as he thought. The aurors had checked the whole house, taking everything magical with them. Cauldrons, wands, even some old artifacts Harry had no idea what they were for. He had had to fill out a form that said he
There was something soothing about a small space like that room, it made him feel safe and in control. Something he didn't feel in a crowd, or out in the open. Right there he couldn't be harmed, no one was going to jump at him. He was safe. But not alone. At least not this time.
"She... Wait, she thought I was going to hurt you?"
even- then he should work towards, at the very least, accepting himself.
Malfoy stared at him, but he didn't look truly angry at him. That was nice, at least.
"Is Elliot alright?"
"Do you want to talk about it? Your secret"
"Well" Noah blushed and looked away "A guy with a penis, probably"
Draco wasn't looking at her anymore, he wasn't looking at Harry either, his gaze was focused on his feet.
outside.
"Yeah?" He panted, eyes closed and head to the side, allowing as much skin to be reachable to his lips and teeth. Every single bite made him pull a bit more at the sheets.
"Ah" Draco barely moved, but his thumb caressed Harry's hand in a gentle stroke. It almost said 'sorry', or at least that was what Harry thought "I guess it's different for muggle borns"
Lucius and Narcissa shared a look, but they didn't answer and that silence broke something inside Draco's chest. He had, somehow despite all his logic and pessimism, hoped for his parents to show him some sort of unconditional love. Ha. He had been foolish.
The Auror nodded, clearly pleased. Had he given her a mature answer? He didn't know and he didn't care, too many questions still lingering in the back of his mind.
Malfoy smiled a fake smile, he looked like a snake. "Of course not, Granger" He pressed his hands to the floor and then rose "I guess we said what we had to say. If it's okay I would very much enjoy going to bed"
outside Hogwarts with him. Harry stopped in front of one of the doors and opened it, pulling them inside.
Harry was more alarmed by the minute, did it also mean Pansy knew about their nights?
Harry bit his lip "Just... Keep it between us?"
" Draco spoke calmly when the creature was ready to pounce at him, pointing at his belly that lacked any sort of shell. It was one of the smartest moves he had ever seen, and done with incredible calmness.
"I... Guess?"
He was sure Noah was worried about that girl even in his unconsciousness.
"Can you? It is unbelievable how
"Tired, Draco? Tsk, and here I thought we were having a good time" Bell ran a hand through Draco's hair again and Harry was, without a shadow of doubt, going to harm him.
"How about we try a little serum? Hm?" He chuckled, shaking a small vial filled with a transparent liquid. They both knew what it was, but Harry didn't understand why he needed it. He didn't understand the need for any of it.
Everything would be fine if at least Draco answered his letters.
And he got her wand. One down, two to go.
"That's new"
Harry placed his free hand on the mattress next to Draco's head, trying to steady himself. He didn't want to hurt Draco, so he used a finger first, easing it inside of him, extremely carefully.
"Hey!" She said, turning around and trying to fight him, but she wasn't quick enough. Not really.
last. That's the thing about having a future, the possibilities are endless.
His skin was the fairest he had ever seen, sometimes it felt as if just pressing on it too hard would make it red. And Harry wanted to see that. He kissed on a patch of skin, hearing Draco's breathing stop for a brief moment, his fingers digging on the back of his neck. He was doing something right, so he kept going. He used his tongue and then his teeth, pulling at his skin... Draco moaned and it completely ruined his train of thought, if he had one. It was the most arousing thing he had heard in his life, and
"One of those offers-you-can't refuse, from the Ministry. It was the talk around Slytherin."
Narcissa reached out, touching one of his arms and squeezing softly. He didn't know if she was trying to comfort him, but he wanted to lean in and convince her that their idea was insane.
Draco frowned, uncomfortable from everyone's eyes on him. He was a Slytherin in lion territory, after all.
"Why not?" Harry knew he was pushing.
Moving in such a small bed wasn't easy, and Harry quickly realized that, as their legs clashed when Draco tried to lay down on the bed underneath him. It didn't detract Harry from kissing him even harder, the soft brushes of tongue sending electricity through his body, waking pieces of skin he had never felt before. Harry could feel Draco's flat chest pressed against his own, hell, he could feel all of Draco pressed against him and it was driving him insane.
"And I sit in front of you"
There was silence from the other boy for a while, until his hand reached for the one Harry had over his belly and held it.
Harry smiled, stealing a couple more kisses before looking back at him "Yeah, it's kinda silly to thank each other. Sorry about that. I just... Don't know how to... This is all new and-..."
It was different too. When they got mad at his grades or his manners he could work and change, improve. But he couldn't change this.
count"
"Opened a window"
"We don't know that" Harry said, siding with Hermione, surprising no one.
How come everything had turned sour so fast? A couple hours ago he was kissing Harry. Kissing The Boy who Lived. No. That wasn't true. He was kissing Harry,
"Yes, and no"
"I can't believe you have to
“Hey”
"I-..." he shook his head, taking classes with the true seventh year students made all of them feel slightly stupid, but it wasn't as if they had repeated the year on purpose.
There would be days like this, when going places would bring back old memories, and meeting people from their past would put them in the spot. Harry was convinced they could work through it. If life had allowed him to live, it had to be for a reason. It couldn't be just because.
Harry looked at the familiar room, knowing full well he wouldn't see it again. He almost wanted to cry. Nothing was permanent in his life, was it? He would always have to leave whatever place that gave him comfort. Not to mention people...
Harry touched her white feathers, letting her eat some treats from his open palm. He felt guilty thinking she was unable to fly anymore because of him. How would that feel? Being a creature able to fly high and suddenly unable to do so because your stupid owner got in the middle of a fight he couldn't win.
So he said the password and pulled him inside. This time people stared, aware of both of them.
"And we are doing this because someone, kind of, targeted Malfoy" She was trying hard not to smirk and Harry wanted the earth to swallow him whole. "But now you are kind of thinking that had nothing to do with anything"
"Draco, you are allowed to leave the room if you want to" There was something in the way she said it that made him think that perhaps she didn't hate him.
The castle was already in view, but neither seemed to want to rush in even if the silence became tense and weird.
"Hm, whatever you say, love"
"I know those games. I'm just surprised. We are not exactly friends"
Harry didn't move, but something ran through his chest when he felt a kiss on the top of his head. "I didn't know you were like this"
"And why would I do that? You see, Harry" The young man grinned and his face transformed horribly, he was no longer the helpful auror, he was a monster. His wand pressed against Draco's neck "The Dark Lord knew the use of marking cowards" Draco didn't flinch, his eyes fixed on Harry "but he also knew the value of loyal unmarked followers. He knew the reach
Harry moved the cloak to cover both of them and oh, yeah, they were really close. Shit.
Harry frowned, re-reading the same paragraph for the fifth time. Potions was the worst subject and he could see no use for it, period. He thought about that time he saved Ron's life by remembering something from potions. Alright: it had
"Thank you, Noel"
"I think you have said that before"
Harry groaned, pressing his face to the space in between his neck and shoulder. Zippers were fine, but buttons and belt buckles? They were impossible to undo with one hand!
Malfoy finally breathed, but kept his arms crossed.
Harry found himself hugging Draco as tightly as he could, digging his fingers into the fabric of his vest, his eyes closed as if to not let a single tear drop. The Slytherin didn't waver, he held him tightly with his arms behind his neck, one hand on his head. Harry realized how much he liked Draco being taller than him, but he didn't say it.
Harry hated that.
He avoided the sinks, rushing towards one of the walls. He closed his eyes when his back touched the cold stone. Breathing was hard, and Harry's words were still on his mind. Slowly but surely his knees gave up, so he sat on the floor, pressing them against his chest and trying not to cry.
"No" Malfoy looked at him as if he was a child "Merlin, Potter, there are certain things I still believe in... But I do not think killing is the answer, or torture or..." he shivered and Harry had the sudden need to give him his cloak. "I
He had to look away, or he would come right then and there and he didn't want it to end. Not yet.
"...Harry? Are you listening to me?"
"I won't let anything happen to you"
Draco pressed his lips into a thin pale line, looking around, a couple thunders exploding in the distance. The air was damp, and the temperature had dropped, it would rain any moment now. Harry kept his focus on Draco.
"Ah" Silence "No. Mother spoke about her but... that was all. Father wasn't too keen on me knowing about my mothers' sisters"
Harry woke in the middle of the night, startled by a nightmare. In it he had crawled on the floor with a hand to his side, feeling blood coming out of his stomach while someone screamed for him. His mother? His friends? He couldn't tell, but there was someone trying to murder him - again. He hated having nightmares. He was powerless in them, and when he woke up his head was all scrambled.
"I know, I know. But we don't know him like you do now. I mean... we haven't spent time together, have we? But I am on your side, Harry" She moved away and kissed his cheek "Even if your taste is really, really bad"
"Who else knows?"
"It can be more than a decent job" Granger said, because of course she had something to add. As if he didn't know the world he
"You need to be careful, you know?" The auror shrugged "This school is all weird"
And now Draco looked as if he had been betrayed. "What?"
"Harry?" Ron was giving him a look "Are you listening to us?"
There were times when Harry felt like the magical world was his home and everything he had, and there were other times when he couldn't understand half the things that happened in said world. This was one of the latter. Taking magic from a place? Putting said magic inside someone's body?
He truly was infuriating, wasn't he? Harry decided to let it be, and stayed  there laying on his back staring at the ceiling. By all means it was a normal room, and Harry felt like a normal guy with a... friend? Foe? What were they, again?
Draco pressed his knees closer to his chest, trying to disappear into himself. One of his hands held one of Harry's, tightly, as if holding onto reality.
"I know what you are trying to do, but fine, race you to the lake"
He covered his face with his arms and tried to become a little ball and disappear. So many nights and days he had pretended not to exist with the Durlseys, he could do it again, right? He could just disappear and be a ghost and perhaps everyone would be better off. Draco would certainly be better off.
"Thank you"
, the
The Tower windows were not supposed to allow students to "jump" or fly down, but surely Hermione had done something to them as well. Or perhaps they had been damaged during the war and changed. Harry didn't know and didn't care. Whatever helped them to get done with this was good enough for him. They dropped on the grass outside the school and Harry managed to shrink his broom so it wouldn't be bothering them.
"Don't you like surprises? I just..." Harry gave him a brief look "Let's hurry, I can see you are about to freeze"
"No, it's not"
attacked Bea and he didn't know what to do. Pomfrey had come to his bedroom and given Noah a sleeping draught, to help him calm down. They had moved all of Elliot's roommates to another bedroom to make sure Noah would get enough rest.
Harry chuckled, what would they say if they knew Malfoy was only sleeping in a different place with him? Woah, when had he decided to spend the night there?
"This is lovely" It was hard to think no one knew they were there. Well, maybe a couple people.
"Harry, are you okay, mate?"
"So there
Narcissa made a sound with her tongue and slightly turned to him "There's still the matter of the heir to discuss"
His head felt heavy and noisy, so he got up again, and started pacing back and forth. He had no clue what love was, was love this? was it what they had done last night?
"Harry?"
Harry sighed and looked at Ron "You have your wand, right?"
She nodded thoughtfully "I feared as much"
"I have no tolerance for violence in my establishment"
I am sorry if this is short or something, I truly tried. Once May is done I will have more time so it will be back to normal!
"Of course it matters! I... I..." Draco bit down on his lip,  and Harry wondered if he was trying not to say something bad. "They should've done something"
"I'm fine, thank you. You can go back inside" His voice was strained but he had to say it. He didn't need his father's pity, he didn't need anyone. He had to learn to fend for himself. Lucius and Narcissa weren't going to be there to support his decisions and he couldn't count on Harry, could he? One day that would end as well and he would be left alone and broken and he wouldn't know what to do anymore.
"I won't bother you"
"I just-" How to say it? How to explain it? "I panicked"
Draco frowned “What?”
And that could not be a good thing.
"That was unfair, you know?"
Draco pressed a hand to his mouth and nose, keeping as quiet as he could. The door opened, of course, but there was nothing there.
Harry placed a hand on his leg, trying to soothe him. It seemed like a nice memory but... "You look sad talking about it"
Harry pressed his lips together feeling curiosity creep up on him. It was impossible not to feel like that. Since sixth year he had wondered why he had such an interest in Malfoy. Yes, that time he had followed him around with a good cause and he had been completely justified but even he knew now how
And him... well, let's just say that the first time he went in public and had a panic attack it ended up on every single newspaper. At least back here, even if he didn't feel protected and had nightmares every night, people would leave him be. And he had his friends. He wouldn't be alone.
"Tell me!"
"Yes. Think about it... I'm sure disliking
Elliot gave him a look "How do you know what girls want?"
There was a possibility that she had actually tried to kill herself, which wouldn't make her a target at all, but they couldn't take any chances. Sometimes, Draco wondered why they didn't go to McGonagall. He knew Harry was used to doing things on his own, but that was before, when Voldemort was around. This was different.
Before Ron could chime in to defend his girlfriend, the last two of the unlikely group appeared. They were carrying no books, but they had dark bags under their eyes. Exam season was approaching and it clearly exhausted everyone.
"I hope you are
Draco looked into his eyes and nodded "Correct"
"Ah, hm. I figured" Harry looked around and realized he hadn't set the silencing spell so he proceeded to do so. "Do you think you could talk to Myrtle?"
"What do you want?" Harry pleaded again, but the girl had taken his wand from his own hand and was pushing him towards Draco. Was this the small window of opportunity they both needed?
"You are my son, it is my business" Lucius crossed his arms as well, staring down at him with a frown on his face "What's going on?"
And simply like that the chains fell to the ground and both of them pushed the doors open, running outside of the room without looking back one. Nothing made sense to Harry. Why had the Room done that? They definitely didn't need nor want a fight with a magical creature, and locking them in? The worst part of all was... how come a simple counter spell was enough to disarm a magical ancient room?
Slowly, incredibly slowly, it passed. He couldn't pin point the exact moment when he started feeling the air inside his lungs, but when he did, the panic left immediately. His heartbeat was still running but it would go down, it always did. Why was he so scared? He wasn't in danger anymore, he was alright. He was in his house, no one could harm him in there. Right?
"Just checking"
"Well it's getting dark, isn't it?"
Finding something to do was proving more difficult by the hour. Draco knew he had to be thankful for being under house arrest, the alternative was too harrowing to think about, but it didn't make it any easier. He didn't have his wand, or his broom, or his cauldron. He had
"There is"
Not everything had been bad those last few months, Harry having a job meant he was smiling more, talking about his colleagues and sharing fun stories. At first he hadn't told them who he was seeing, only that he was in a relationship. As time went on, he told them about the relationship without asking him first. Draco was a bit glad, he wasn't sure he would've been brave enough to say yes, and his workmates were fine with it. Apparently not everyone cared who they were.
There was an urge to cover the mirror, to not look at himself but he didn't give in. A lot had happened and, perhaps, if someone found him attractive -
Noah closed his book and sat a bit straighter, lowering his feet "What does this have to do with us?"
"Just wondering why you are so damn pale"
"Alright... Maybe we can talk about this... You know, later?"
"I know you won't"
Slowly but surely the kiss started to pick up, it became faster, messier, hungrier. Harry tried to contain himself, but he wasn't the only one feeling that way; Draco's hands left his face to pull at him from his shirt. Moving away or stopping didn't even cross his mind, as he allowed himself to be pulled closer and closer. Due to the position they were in, every time Draco tugged at his shirt, Harry ended up more and more on top of him.
Draco smirked and shook his head "No, of course not. And she's leaving after the winter break"
"Oh, shut up" Draco smirked, moving his chair to sit next to him, and pointing at a group of stars. Harry had never had the time to sit around and look up at the stars, but he could imagine old wizards having nothing else to do. He tried to follow Draco's finger and see the shape, but to him it looked like a weird rhomboid figure and then more stars down like... a tail?
Also: what? Harry could not understand what made Draco so insecure. And with that, he realized a simple truth: Draco was jealous. Simple as that. Harry smiled at the realization.
"What? Exaggerating? I know my family, Potter. I know what happens... The scene is always the same. Every little transgression is met with the same treatment" He sounded in pain, in some horrible secret pain.
, sure. They are only staring"
"Potter"
Draco looked up, a bit surprised and startled and it truly made Harry's morning. The boy was impeccable from head to toes, dressed all in black as usual, his green and silver tie the only strong detail. Well, not the only one.
"I am willing to listen" Lucius said, pulling the desk chair and sitting right in front of him. He was tense, probably forced to be there by Narcissa.
"It's three minutes" Harry smiled at him while the microwave made popping sounds. Those machines were incredible and Draco almost wanted to know
"I was just going to-..." He tried, not looking at her and not really knowing how to explain whatever had happened. Hermione gave him no time to think an answer, she hugged him tightly until he relaxed and hugged back. It was weird, having friends that knew how to handle him in almost every situation. Perhaps that's what happens after risking your life time after time for each other.
"We need to talk" No answer, Malfoy was too busy cleaning dust off his hands. Harry would've laughed if he weren't so nervous. "I'm sorry I hurt you" He finally looked up, two grey eyes throwing daggers at him. Harry was a bit surprised that he... Liked that. He didn't like Draco hating him, of course, but he liked how the other boy wouldn't sugar-coat things or make it easy for him. He would always call him out on his bullshit. Not everyone was like that. Not when you are the
Harry moved his wand casting a drying spell without even thinking about it twice.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You aren't ruining anything..." Harry decided that this wouldn't be fixed with words, so he simply pulled the blond in for a hug. The boy quickly hugged his waist, hiding his face against his shoulder, slumping a bit. It was good to be like this, and even better to realize they weren't exactly worried about someone coming up the stairs and finding them like that. It was liberating, somehow.
The "head" of the skrewt turned around trying to follow the sound -did it have ears? Harry didn't want to know- and its razor like legs moved quickly over the wooden floor. It was definitely trying to kill them.
"I-..." He held her hand a bit tighter and frowned "He could love someone else"
of you, or just forget, Draco. I was worried out of my mind... kept thinking someone kept the letters from you"
Hermione must have used a silencing charm because he couldn't hear anything after that.
"Rest, Draco" Harry whispered.
Harry seemed conflicted, as if he wanted to object but probably saw the truth in his words. Hogwarts' new protections made snow not get inside the Tower but it was still freezing.
"Was dad good?" He turned to her.
"Lumos" now that there was some light, Draco started walking towards one of the bookshelves, his slender fingers touching the back of one of the books. Harry couldn't see if it said something on the cover, since it was all black. Hell, all of them were black. This felt wrong. Terribly wrong.
the man he
"Hermione, she helped me... And McGonagall knows I'm here"
"They heard a rumor about us and they are
"Wh-... What?" Harry blinked looking startled, his hands trying to fix his glasses.
"I'll be there with you, don't worry so much"
"Can we not talk about it?" Harry felt a bit embarrassed, not only from everything that had happened but by the fact that he had very clearly been crying. "It was just a stupid fight, alright?"
Alright, the last one was true, but he had it under control.
"I've been better"
"And when it's not enough?"
Bell seemed pleased with himself, nodding and moving away from his table so he could get up and leave. Draco was definitely going to avoid dinner at the Great Hall. Which probably meant he was going to miss his chance to sneak with Harry to Gryffindor Tower, which meant he was going to sleep alone. After what had happened, he so wanted to be held. Even if it was wrong, even if he shouldn't want that. Men should want to hold others, right? Preferably women. They shouldn't want to be held, right? Well, Draco had never felt quite like the others anyway.
and make more" He groaned, following Harry into the kitchen as he picked up a bag of popcorn and placed it inside the microwave. With magic, it would have been a simple flick of the wrist and they wouldn't have had to abandon the cozy spot on the couch. Draco couldn't wait to get his wand again. The days had become shorter with Harry around, always finding something to do. The house was nowhere near done, but they had painted most of the walls and bought enough furniture to have a nice view inside every room.
Elliot frowned. Ugh.
There was a small
"Why? You are really... I don't know. Didn't expect you to be so traditional"
"That's incredible" Hermione was saying, looking at some book Noah was carrying. How could she always be so interested in studying? Even after everything that had happened.
He saw the blond shake his head, shoulders slumped "No, I'm not running away"
"So no one saw you leave Slytherin then? Oh, that's good"
Elliot kept his arms crossed.
"Good?"
Normal. What was that even? Harry nodded, even if he had no idea what to do or how to explain to his friend that things would never be normal again. He had no means of bringing back the dead, the world was changed forever and he could do nothing about it. Yeah, maybe he had stopped Voldemort for doing even worse damage, but it hadn't been enough. It would never be enough.
"That girl was mad" Ron whispered, hurrying up the stairs towards the second floor bathroom. Harry nodded, but his eyes were glued to his map, making sure no one would catch them.
Besides, if he discovered something was amiss he could go to them for help.
Draco chuckled, but suddenly felt like crying "Yeah?"
"You are
supporting him? What is he doing bringing him to our... place?"
“It's the moon's phase when...” Hermione stopped and blushed “You weren't asking, sorry.”
"I enjoy chocolate ice cream, I fancy Cho" Harry frowned trying to think of another truth that wasn't too revealing but... maybe this was something he needed and his mouth spoke before his brain could stop him "I have nightmares almost every night"
Harry fisted his hands, breathing quicker. They had physically fought before and it had never ended well. He didn't want to turn Draco's skin black and blue but he was so mad... and he knew Malfoy was as mad as he was.
His scarf smelled like him, and it was weird because he had never been close enough to know how he smelled like. The only chance had been during
close and maybe he could actually move around on the ice and discover if he liked it or now.
"Yes, of course. What do you need?" She said, getting up and ready to leave.
"You are all alive, isn't that enough?"
Terrified, he looked down, expecting to see a slithering shape hurrying towards his body or something equally monstrous. He saw nothing. Draco was about to get up and run, when a head appeared, and then shoulders, and then there was a whole Harry Potter in front of him.
It's not that he didn't want to have sex with Harry, he did, but the school wasn't the place for it. It was a place that didn't make him feel safe at all, and it was filled with bittersweet memories. He didn't want their first time to... be bittersweet. Perhaps he was just scared of dooming their relationship if they started something like that inside those walls. He knew it made no logical sense, but he wanted this completely separated from the one place that had been filled with blood and death not so long ago. Draco wanted to look back and not think about it
Draco knew he would have been able to live with Harry hating him once, but now? Now that he knew what it was like to kiss him?
Harry stretched himself a bit and then used his wand to clean both of them from... The least pleasant parts of having sex.
“They need something from the victims, or well, sacrifices. You are not missing a tooth or anything like that, right?”
Harry nodded, his hair brushing against Draco's forehead.
When Narcissa broke the small hug, only cold air replaced it and Draco felt alone again.
"Harry, something happened"
Maybe having a father even as bad as Malfoy's would have been good.
to mine"
"Don't remind me. I had no idea what to do, well, we had those lessons..."
"They would have tortured you, or worse"
"Yeah"
"I was leaving" He grabbed his shoes, eyes almost always on the floor as he put them on "Enjoy your nightmares" That was the last thing he said before leaving the room. Harry threw himself on the bed, looking up and feeling pathetic, angry and upset. Why did he do that? He said things he didn't mean, things he didn't think anymore. He wanted that fight. Why? To prove what?
"What do you want? It's about my aunt, Malfoy" Elliot didn't know, how could he know?
"That's why you always wore those hand-me-downs?"
With not much to do, and a grumbling stomach, he walked to the Great Hall for breakfast. Draco was surely back in the library or down in the dungeons trying to brew some potions or whatever he did to prepare for that horrible class.
and something deep inside wondered if the times he got
"Menacing, huh?"
Draco's room was empty when they got in, which apparently wasn't strange since only two other boys slept there. The slytherin explained very briefly that his roommates came in late, but didn't bothered him. They were still energized from the discovery and the thought of finally getting over with whatever was going on. Truth was Draco hadn't been eager to investigate and get drawn into something dangerous, so Harry could understand why he was so pleased now.
"I don't think it was a prank at all. Someone tried to murder him"
"Crying"
The silence that followed was tense, and even Ginny moved the cup to her lips, taking two long sips.
"No, don't... don't" Draco closed his eyes for a moment, looking clearly affected. Harry wasn't stupid, he knew what was on the seventh floor. He knew what had happened there.
"Any ideas?"
“We think it's your blood anyways” Harry sighed “And it has to be done during a waxing crescent, whatever that means”
"Hm, poison
"Aha" Harry said in a teasing tone, following him inside. The room was small, clearly an old classroom or storage room that had been abandoned a long time ago. The posters on the walls were definitely Pansy's since he was pretty sure Draco had no interest in wizard rock bands or anything of the like. There was something like a bed filled with cushions taking over one of the corners and almost half of the space.
Harry didn't know if he had said something wrong, or misinterpreted her relationship to the boys. Somehow, she reminded him of Draco. Not the Draco he knew now, but a sad and lonely Draco that had been crying his heart out on a certain bathroom.
"That's good" Elliot bit down his lip, hard. He wanted to say so many things to him, but didn't know if he should. Noah had no feelings for him, and that... That was okay as long as they were friends. Risking their friendship was something Elliot wasn't ready to do.
Malfoy seemed confused for a moment, and then he groaned "Can we not talk about that? I'm perfectly fine"
, I-"
"Good"
Harry leaned in, kissing him very softly. The other boy kissed back, and for a couple moments nothing else mattered in the whole world. Harry could understand why Draco didn't want to be vulnerable, he felt the same way sometimes.
was probably the worst part of her two best friends dating. "And... What happened to that kid left me a bit worried, alright? It's just that"
"And you sit in front of me"
He reached for his wand, feeling Draco's kisses all over one of his collarbones. Merlin, it felt so good.
Having Draco Malfoy saying 'please' and playing nice was extremely weird, and Harry had a couple of seconds of complete amazement before nodding in agreement. He was terrible at keeping secrets from his friends, but he was willing to try just to... to... Harry pursed his lips, confused at where his thoughts were going.
"It's alright, profe-"
"I just... I don't trust her"
"We have to live, not only survive. Sometimes I think Father would have preferred to... Die. Other times I am sure he is happy, but it's hard to know with him"
"What do you mean, not good?" Harry said in the same worried tone, looking at him and then the paper over and over again.
"Whatever" She grabbed her bag, furious and got up looking at them as if they were the plague "And don't come bothering me again, Elliot, okay?"
"What are you thinking about?" Draco whispered, without pulling away from their hug.
Slytherin you need a
He swallowed when the steps stopped right outside the door. Draco started counting to three inside his head, one, two, three...
Harry laughed, covering his face with a hand for a brief moment "Sorry, I just... I used to think that. Every. Time. And every time I was wrong" It hurt, thinking about it. It hurt so bad. Harry smiled briefly, looking over at him "I just don't want what happened to you and that other boy to happen ever again"
sound, his eyes slowly accommodating to the lack of light. "Are muggle hospitals that bad?"
Bell turned away from them, opening a small bag and placing its contents over a simple wooden table. Harry didn't need to be a genius to know those were probably torture tools. It was strange, seeing something like that from a wizard, they usually stuck to the Cruciatus curse.
"Well... I also taught you how to be mischievous" She winked and they shared a playful smirk "Your father is a good man"
"Don't be annoying, Elliot" Noah whispered and opened his eyes, moving a hand around the bed until he found something "Here... This is what I remember"
"Do we... get detention?"
Harry nodded, kissing him softly. "We'll still go to Molly's afterwards, right?"
"Beatrice"
Jokingly, Draco had complained of his sore back and how holding Harry all night didn't help. The Gryffindor hadn't been mad at all, instead he offered to give him a massage. Draco almost wanted to complain, but it was so easy to simply relax around Harry, so he didn't. Harry's hands were touching his shoulders and near his neck, kneading the skin and his sore muscles. It hurt a bit, but Draco didn't mind because it was Harry's hands over him. The same way he didn't mind how much his heart ached when they kissed, because it was Harry who he was kissing.
When? How? Was Draco truly avoiding him? Harry felt something twist in his stomach and the idea of talking to the other boy made him anxious.
tell me,
"So..."
He came back.
for them. His mother's words implied an unwavering love for Bellatrix, for Andromeda, for... Sirius. He had so many questions, and he was sure he would never get the answers he hoped.
He was Marked, for God's sake, that clearly should be enough for all those pure bloods to still consider him of
when they saw Draco sitting with them, and someone had replied
Noah had seen everything happen from his own table at the Library. And he had done nothing. He had wanted to, but ever since third year he had tried to keep to himself and don't be noticed too much. He was proud of finally looking like he felt since forever but
By school rules they were encouraged to be in the Great Hall for meals, but they never quite cared about breakfast that much. Noah was sitting with an open book on his lap while Elliot picked at some fruit.
Harry nodded, his eyes roaming the room, body tense. He wished he could take all of his nervousness away. To carry it all on his own back. Their hands separated when Harry walked away towards a table filled with drinks, Draco had noticed how some of the guests had been throwing glances at them. It was something to be expected, people knew about their relationship but they hadn't seen them together. He just hoped no one would say anything. Words can hurt way too much, and they've hurt too much already.
He heard a small 'hm' and her mother moved, accommodating herself right next to him, their shoulders bumping very slightly. They stayed in silence for a while, enjoying each other's company. Or perhaps they didn't know what else to say. Perhaps there was nothing else to say. Draco felt exhausted, and this was only the beginning.
They walked with her back to the kitchen, where she stood with her hands on her hips, giving them a look. Harry realized he had no idea if she had children or a husband or, well, a wife.
"And if I do decide to become and auror, what? You'll break up with me?"
As long as he could remember the law of the world was that Potter hated him and he hated Potter. Now it turned out that wasn't true. Draco had figured out a long time ago he didn't
Draco jumped, startled and turned around trying to find the voice. He wasn't supposed to be there. Not only it was a girl's bathroom, but it was one that
"What is that thing?!"
Alright, it was nice to see someone working at the ministry that had a family 'just like him'. In his social circles those were cues for 'they also worked for
She hugged him, very tightly, burying her head on his chest. Her long blonde hair fell all around her and his hands quickly caressed it. There was much love in the way he held her. Narcissa had always felt safe in between his arms.
She knew he was lying.
"It's not that" Elliot chewed on his lower lip and then sighed "I don't want her manipulating Noah or something"
"If we say things to you it's because we want you to be careful, we are trying to help. To protect you"
Draco gave him a look, but turn on his side to allow him to change. That was nice. No one had seen him naked -Moaning Myrtle did
"Yes"
"'m not" he took a long sip of his drink
"Yeah, I... Yeah"
"Oh but you are?"
Harry didn't like thinking about the trials, or the newspapers after the trials but sometimes he couldn't help it and his mind went back to Draco. He had been surprised to see him there.
"Of course you won't" She moved forward, kissing his cheek. It felt warm, but nothing more. "What do you need?"
"You did?" Harry smiled "You are so brilliant, you know?"
There was a look on Draco's face that he couldn't quite figure out, but it was nice. Really nice.
Before Draco could finish his sentence, the books started to fall. But they weren't just falling from the shelves, they were being thrown at them with such force it would leave bruises on their skins. Harry tried to cover himself with his hands at first, before creating a magic shield around them. The books tried to break it but failed.
"Hey! How are you?" The boy asked, standing up to greet him "We heard what happened. I-"
"We haven't talked in a long time, Draco"
"A lot of people hate me" Draco didn't look up from his paper.
He didn't find the words, or the explanation he so sorely needed but it didn't seem to matter. Before he could look up, Harry was right there, arms around his body. It was surprising, being comforted like this even if he was being an absolute jerk.
Harry's heart started beating, no, not beating: pounding inside his chest and he was sure his hands were sweaty now. Why was Draco still holding one of his hands? How had all of this happened? How could anyone, in their right mind, love him...?
They took a turn as to not run directly into a rock, the lake looming in the distance. Harry had managed to get in arms reach of Malfoy, when the clouds were unable to hold on any longer and water started pouring down. It was cold, fat drops getting into his hair, making his uniform stick to his skin. Harry had never felt more alive.
"You are not how I thought you would be... And you won't like what I have to say but... You are
Malfoy moved his arm away from his eyes and stared at the ceiling. Harry had never wished so much to know what someone else was thinking until that moment.
Oh, right, she didn't know. Harry blushed at how much he knew about the situation -and about Malfoy- but tried to disguise it as a consequence of the cold.
And, well, they were having fun. They had gone to Hufflepuff's after dinner and after a while of studying together and joking around, they had gone to the bedroom. Noah was face up staring at the ceiling with a thoughtful look on his face, and Elliot was half-sitting on the bed.
"Stay the fuck away from me" He spat, throwing daggers out of his grey eyes. Why were they so grey? How? Maybe he truly was part veela or whatever.
They had placed the normal wards on the curtains around the bed, just in case Draco's roommates decided to come back before dawn.
A warm fluttering feeling moved through Harry's chest. Was it having someone else in the world to talk to? Was it not feeling completely alone and forgotten? Or was it because it was Malfoy? He had no clue, but he felt good.
There was a brief pause, their fingers still intertwined "Father will be angry, furious even. He will try not to scream but fail. He will let me know I am a disgrace, that no one in the family has ever been...
"Hey, I don't think I can keep going" There was a softness in his tone that made something move inside of him. Draco caressed his cheek and his face turned towards the palm of his hand, following his touch.
The longer answer was something along the lines of:
"Did you bring any alcohol?"
"Draco" He whispered, his hands on his arms, going up and down but keeping him near. "let me..."
Harry chuckled, but still felt uneasy. He turned to his other friend, hoping to find some good advice.
"Potter-... Harry, I won't be able to go anywhere, I will get moody and angry and snap at you and I will be bored out of my mind and-"
"Of course we are, dear. We are the Malfoy family, aren't we?"
"I want to use my mouth on you" Draco whispered next to his ear. He groaned, head pressed against the pillow. "Will you let me?"
Narcissa frowned "Is that all he is to you? An heir?
But of course, they had no luck. The stupid thing decided to go after Malfoy.
Maybe.
"Alright, I won't judge
[ink splatters, unreadable]
"He's here"
my eyes"
Deep down, he knew he would never be, so he had to just force himself to keep moving, to face whatever came his way. To be brave.
Oh. Of course. Harry wanted to slap himself for being so stupid. Draco wasn't talking about pure blood relations, he was just hurt at his dig at his Mother's family.
had, but it was... too much, too hard. Sometimes cleaning brought him back memories or Privet Drive, of a time were cleaning was the only thing he was allowed without being punished for existing.
"I-... Thank you" Draco wasn't sure he wanted to work there at all, but it was better than nothing "I still don't know what I wish to do. Freedom is... An odd concept, don't you think?"
"A creature attacked us. I couldn't get a good look at it but... It's controlled, anyway." Draco didn't want to go into details, he already felt like he had failed Harry in such a simple task. "Hey, save some for me"
He pushed all of that down, and looked up. After all he
"Yeah, my only plan was to dive after my wand and improvise"
Harry managed to slip out of him without having to move much. He soon realized he was crushing Draco with his body, so he moved to lay next to him.
"Sorry"
"Do you really believe that?"
"Today's the day?"
So Harry had gone to see Elliot, who seemed incredibly pissed at the world. Their talk had been short, Harry asked where Draco was and Elliot said he had no idea, and something a bit rude about him. Which prompted Harry to lose some of his patience and ask where he had seen him last.
Harry smirked and shrugged, hands going up to cup his face "I'm not sad, I got something in my eye"
"Ginny, we-..."
"The kitchen is over there... and it's cleaner, I use that a lot. And, uh, the bathroom is over there but ours is upstairs, next to the bedroom"
"She's not bad... She has helped me and... Yeah" Draco sighed, looking around the bathroom and wishing not to be there anymore "Sorry, can I leave?"
"It's not... that simple, professor"
"I wouldn't be trapped in here
Lucius got up very slowly, giving him a thoughtful look before walking towards the door. He stopped when his hand touched the wood "I did not enjoy it"
Draco clenched his fists, feeling hurt and ashamed and misunderstood and he... He wanted to hurt Neville. Oh, Merlin, he wanted to hurt him so bad so he would feel as ashamed as he felt. Draco felt his fingernails digging at the palm of his hands.
Draco squeezed him a bit tighter "Why not? I cry
Harry chuckled "Well, it wasn't
"I-... Well, I-"
What had gone wrong?
"You got your pumpkin pie"
Draco wanted to roll his eyes "We don't know if he's still asleep, he could be awake. Besides..." He stared into Harry's eyes, trying to make him understand. Even if Noah was still knocked out, Elliot was all alone.
Suddenly the air decided not to go inside his lungs. He was inside a maze again. A dark maze. He was in a maze with another boy. Two of them, again.
"I do. And you should hate his dad"
Draco frowned, raising his head from his hands for a moment. What was he on about? He wasn't in the mood for fighting anymore, couldn't he see that?
Harry sighed "It's not that we don't trust them..."
"Was it
"I have been thinking about what you proposed to me, Harry but... it's still a
"You should stay out of my way" Draco kept his tone calm, almost boring, but he knew who he was imitating. He felt sick.
"Rosmerta told me to be careful, apparently there are some dementors around" Harry frowned "Don't even know why they brought them here, honestly"
"Do you want to go to Hogsmeade before we all have to go home? I thought it could be nice. We could have dinner and spend the night?"
"Potter, I-... Just hurry!" Draco said, pushing him through the bedroom's door.
"I am aware, but we both know an engagement is what our parents have in mind" She was right, of course she was.
"What are you doing, Malfoy?"
It was all extremely confusing, but his head was somewhere else. Actually, he was completely focused on Draco. And Draco was only focused on him.
Harry finally pulled away, sitting on a chair a few feet away from him. It's not that he wanted to be away from Draco, but talking about stuff like that -about his mind and his feelings- made him uncomfortable. He couldn't handle it.
Most students were walking to their Common Rooms, chatting gleefully without paying attention to anyone in particular. Of course that didn't apply when Harry Potter was passing by. Eyes would find him and people would whisper.
"I should have done more to protect you during your formative years, Potter. I am truly sorry" She placed a hand on his shoulder "And I understand that... It is difficult for everyone to relax after a war. I should have known you were involved in solving this... But I'm afraid it was already solved, and you just endangered yourself. Both of you did" Draco seemed to slump next to him, his brow furrowed. Was he thinking about the ministry or about his sentence? Harry wouldn't allow him to be expelled, even if he had to be expelled himself.
"Do you think she's really going to take this room away from us?"
Hermione nodded after a small deliberation with herself and started to explain everything that had happened after the first attack. Harry chimed in to add what he had learned from McGonagall and other things they had been discussing.
"She really thinks crying is fine?"
He would have to wait until the night to go ask him what the hell that was.
Harry had no clue what he had to talk about, nothing had happened. They almost died, big deal, that was his life.
"Yeah, I'm fine. Noah is... He's wrecked. He was so bad last night. Said things that made no sense..."
"I don't know. Maybe he doesn't want to see me"
"I don't know what he wants, Draco" She finally said "Do you?"
They hadn't fallen asleep, but they didn't continue their activities either. From time to time they would kiss, their hands still softly touching skin, discovering each other. There were a million things unsaid, things they didn't even know
his hand. Harry had to swallow and look at him to know this was okay. By all means, it seemed to be okay. Draco was relaxed, almost about to break a small smile, and his hand was
Harry smiled, oh, he missed his friends. Perhaps they could all get along together. The four of them.
"That's terrible" Harry moved a bit closer, not knowing what to do or say. What Draco had described was... Well, exactly how he imagined Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy. "But... Are you sure you are not...?"
stare then. Draco had never touched her, but it wouldn't hurt if people thought he was doing
"Oh, of course. I'm stupid" Malfoy muttered "
Ugh. The worst part of it all was he was right. Draco knew the only reason he had avoided his letters was pure fear. He had been afraid of his own feelings, the extent of them, afraid of how much of himself was on the line, afraid of what could happen if their relationship ended. Draco was someone that went all the way in with the things he cared about, and unsurprisingly, he cared about Harry a lot.
She smiled again and made a small 'tsk' sound with her tongue, looking around. Noise came from the front of the pub, but everything seemed to be in order. Rosmerta made them a small 'wait' sign, before talking to one of her employees. When she came back to them, she seemed pleased.
Hermione blinked "Oh"
After the night he had had with Harry, there were a lot of things to contemplate. If he truly wanted to be with him, to give their... relationship a chance, then he had to be extremely careful.
Harry arched an eyebrow.
"At the count of three. One..." Harry smiled a bit wider, placing one foot ahead "Two... Three!"
, Draco"
But it did stop. It stopped for about one minute, before it turned into something much, much worse.
The word
Fuck it.
Someone laughed. Harry was getting more and more alarmed by the minute.
"Pansy uses it too, then?"
"Bed?"
"I thought you came here to comfort me, not interrogate me"
"Don't know, I'm no expert really... But don't tell the office I said that"
"That's a lie"
Draco made a small "aha" sound and stretched out, grabbing his bag and pulling it towards himself.
changed?"
"Did you see his face?"
"Yeah, I get the idea, Ron" Harry tried not to smirk "I don't think his Patronus is a doe. Wait, is everyone betting on this?"
Draco closed his eyes, clearly tired and with no intention of getting up. He wanted to do the same, but a strong feeling of dread set on his stomach at the thought of his friends realizing he had not only slept outside of his room but missed breakfast, just like Draco. Harry was sure Ron wasn't going to realize anything, but now that Hermione knew they both spend nights together, she would put two and two together and... And what? They were doing nothing wrong. Talking was no crime. Right?
and that's all. Is that too much to ask in exchange for keeping our family alive?"
That made sense, and Harry felt the need to go back inside and scream to those kids. But he didn't. Somehow, spending time with Draco was better. He had to admit he enjoyed the peace and quiet of being alone, even if it was unfair.
He felt how Draco dragged his fingernails against one of his shoulder blades and groaned. Merlin.
"Hm, it might actually help you"
She frowned, her brain clearly thinking new strategies. People would never know how smart and strategic she was. Draco both admired and feared those qualities "Promise"
"Slow down for one second" He moved a bit closer, holding onto his arm. Draco wasn't the only one rushing, the rest of the students seemed in a frenzy. Exam week was no joke and everyone was on edge. Well, Harry felt more calm than he had been the whole year so... yeah.
"I don't approve, yes, but you were quite clear about how this wouldn't go away"
"It's what you taught me"
"Better" She tapped his shoulder and then turned to the other two "Now will you tell me what's going on?"
Harry realized he had told nothing about his talk to the girl -Draco hadn't asked, and kissing had seemed such a needed distraction. He wondered if he should say it now but... it was late, they were tired, and Draco was clutching him to tightly it didn't feel right to just go back to something that stressed them.
What would happen then? What would happen to all of them once they were out of School?
"Auror Bell" McGonagall sounded annoyed at best, furious at worst "I'm afraid the only thing we have accomplish bringing you here is stress my students. I can handle this school on my own. I think it's time I have a chat with the Head of Aurors, Mr. Bell. Now please, I would like all of you to stop terrorizing the students"
"Are you two friends?"
Harry pressed his lips together and looked down to his feet. "Thanks, Ron"
Harry bit his lip and covered himself with the cloak, he was going to stay until they were done and then he was going to talk to Malfoy again. If things were like he thought they were, Draco could be in trouble. Not for harming someone, but because someone might be wanting to frame him or harm him.
"Just for a moment, alright? Or are you sitting with anyone else?" There was a small pause, tense. Harry felt like he had said something he shouldn't have. Was Draco truly sitting alone? Did he not have
"What did you say to her? About this?"
A little voice in the back of his head told him to go back to his room and leave it be, but he ignored it.
He chuckled "No, but are you trying to make me believe
"Yeah it IS hard!" Draco turned around on his heels, forcing Harry to stop dead in his tracks. "It's bloody hard, Potter, and I don't like it. I almost hate you for making me come here"
of me. Because I exist" His voice was broken by the end  of it, and Harry had no clue how to stop himself from feeling what he felt "Everyone's dead because of me"
"Ron, Hermione, not now. We have to go!"
"Let him go" It wasn't a question and he wasn't pleading, it was an order. Harry knew he had to push through the feeling of powerlessness, or they were both doomed.
was that boy in my house?"
"I never said that" He was controlled again, distant. "I only wished to explain to you... One of the reasons I... changed"
being one. Hm.
Draco uncrossed his arms and got up slowly, picking up his bag, not looking at him directly. His movements were calculated, almost as if he didn't want to leave. Harry wanted him to stay, but he had realized that Draco asking him not to talk to him that night had to be respected. He wasn't well, and Harry had no right to push any further.
Did he? "Maybe"
"We need to find that out. Harry, Slughorn loves you" Draco snickered, Ron rolled his eyes "You could talk to him and check the wand"
"Do you wish to go back to the Tower?"
to do.
"Draco, are we going to talk about...?"
happening, and he didn't even know if Draco would be okay with him saying this to his friends.
"Look, Potter, I will say this very slowly so you understand..." And there he was again, trying to be a bloody snake. Harry gritted his teeth and gave a step forward, they were both tense and ready to jump at the first chance they got. It was dangerous. Really dangerous. "
" He could hear the amusement -or curiosity?- in his voice and wanted to scream at him "Is something wrong?"
curious as to why Draco wanted to talk about it at all.
"Uhm, yes... Curious creature. Will have to ask Hagrid about it... he's a nice fellow, surely he will have an idea"
Last time he had tried this he had failed. Of course, he tried not to think much about that, it would do him no good. His work to cover it all up had been incredible, of course.
you are giving me a headache"
"Potter, the password?" Harry blinked, looking at the Lady's portrait. Right. The Tower. Friends.
"Excellent" She looked over at Malfoy for a moment and then back at him "Just you and me, okay?" And then she kissed his cheek. Harry could
difficult. Even if he complained about it, he ended up helping and almost seemed amazed at the final product.
Harry laughed, smiling so wide his cheeks hurt a bit. "I know you don't like those. Shut up, Malfoy"
"So was I"
Elliot frowned and then nodded "Yes,
"Wait..." Draco was staring down at the paper in his hands "we have the upper hand right now, you and me"
Bell only laughed "So loyal. Would you really trade your safety for his? Ha!"
"Yeah, I do guess it's
Draco closed his eyes and sighed, resting his head on his shoulder "Why do you think? I didn't want to give him any reason to 'understand' who I was"
sheets to welcome me, Potter?"
"But it is, Harry" Draco closed his eyes, not moving away from their embrace "It just is"
"What do you mean?"
"Hm?" The blonde boy arched an eyebrow and quickly looked away, focusing on something else.
If he were anyone else, he might have screamed or punched a wall or done something irrational. Instead, he got up and looked at his wand. He was an auror, he had special training and no one was going to take what was his without him knowing.
Draco smiled and kissed him, it still sent butterflies fluttering all over his body to be able to kiss him so casually. "Use magic," He took out his wand and flicked it, Harry's tie done in an instant. "no one taught me either"
Draco's eyes widened so much Harry almost worried. Was that too much, too soon? Was he overstepping? Merlin, Draco probably didn't even want to live with him. After all, he was a mess. The nightmares were still there, and the panic attacks, and the subtle yet persistent desire to disappear. They were all there inside his head. But he... He wanted to get better. And he didn't mind Draco's nightmares, or his baggage. Perhaps Draco didn't mind his?
Less than a minute -or ten minutes? Seconds? Draco couldn't tell- he was also coming with shuddered breaths. Harry collapsed on top of him, incapable of holding himself with his hands, tired and pleased.
Draco held the glass of magical champagne in his hand and took a long sip, trying to ignore the tension between them. His father looked as if he had swallowed something particularly disgusting. His mother, on the other hand, didn't show a thing on her face.
"No, you would be a kind one" She murmured "I could be with... And you could..."
"Come on, Potter, can't you catch me?"
Every time Harry Potter broke the rules, a wave of satisfaction ran through him. It wasn't hard to follow the kid without being seen, and it wasn't hard to know he was investigating.
Harry tried not to shudder at the thought "Andromeda says those symbols mean blood or bones or pieces from the...
, his father would say... but he wasn't there to make him feel bad about it.
And to top it all off a first year student had tugged at his robe to ask him something, probably directions. He even sounded scared and nervous but when he turned to answer... the kid bolted. As if he had seen the devil. What things were being said about him? Draco knew he hadn't been paying much attention, and he hadn't been tending to his reputation as much as he should have been.
He played softly with one of Harry's nipples, not quite sure if it was going to cause a reaction but it did. He was sure he hadn't heard Harry moan in his life, even though it was a low and quiet sound, almost as if he didn't want anyone but Draco to hear him. It drove him insane.
or maybe crying or something. Harry wanted to turn back, but he didn't.

Elliot rolled his eyes "That's overrated" That got a smile from Noah. "Just because Bea doesn't feel the same way doesn't mean there aren't other girls checking you out"
"What happened?" Hermione was looking at him in an unnerving way "Is Elliot alright? do you know anything about the attacks?"
Hermione sat on the floor and opened her book, it wasn't anything he recognized and he had no idea as to why she would want a book for this... But trusting her was part of the process.
