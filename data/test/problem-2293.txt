“Now then, Mr. Malfoy, I do believe we’ve stalled quite enough. You came here to tell me something, did you not?” Dumbledore’s voice shifted Draco’s attention to the man across from him. With Draco’s eyes on him once more, Dumbledore gestured at him invitingly. This was it. Draco had to come clean.
The Dark Lord’s former self was tricky, and Draco didn't want to know how much worse his present self would be. Yet, he responded attentively- as his mother had taught him. “I want to help you so I can bring honour to my family, and so I can fulfill my debt to my father. I expect protection for me and my family by serving you. No, I don’t trust you. But I’ll do what you ask because I’m not a fool- you could kill me anytime you wish.”
“Oh, and why do I owe her a favor?” Draco smirked.
“Good.” Lucius seemed to relax at that, but only slightly. He then hesitated, but said, “Have a good time at school then.”
When he woke he hadn’t felt rested. He felt just as tired as he was the night before. And his body shook with faint tremors, indicating a nightmare filled slumber. He body also felt slick with sweat, and he grimaced. He hated feeling so grimy.
‘Tom Riddle, I apologize for my absence.’
With that, Riddle stepped towards Draco once more, and muttered something under his breath. Draco couldn’t process what he was saying, but the next thing he knew he had blacked out once more. This time though, his subconscious wasn’t around to comfort him or process his surroundings.
‘The diary absorbs my strength, doesn’t it?’
It was time to go to Hogwarts. It was time to get rid of the diary, and then he could spend the rest of the year enjoying his spot on the Quidditch team, and work on beating Hermione Granger in their academics. It wouldn’t be too difficult surely, he had always been better in the practical portion of their academics anyways. Now he just had to concentrate a bit more on the theoretical work.
Draco clambered up the small hill leading back up to the manor, intending to wash up before lunch. But, it seemed that just as soon as he reached one of the entrances into his home fate had another idea for him. Because at that moment his eagle owl, Acelin, swooped down towards him and caused Draco to lose his balance, resulting in him flailing around in surprise and ungracefully landing on his knees. With a hiss of pain Draco directed his vision to the bird now swirling around him playfully. Acelin let out a small hoot and landed on Draco’s shoulder, nipping at his ear.
But who else was there? It had to be someone close to Potter- more than acquaintances, but not necessarily friends. Someone who had information on Potter no doubt. And yet, it had to be someone who wouldn’t turn the diary in as well.
Narcissa had had a difficult life. She loved family dearly, and always wanted to attend family events. Unfortunately, most of her family had been taken from her during the first war- as had Lucius’s family. With her sister and cousin imprisoned, her other sister and her family ostracized from Pureblood society, and her final cousin dead, it was rather hard to plan family events.
Shaking off the weak feeling, Draco pressed against the wall and let out a shuddered breath. He just needed to compose himself.
Lucius looked pleasantly unhappy with the scene before him, his son’s uncontrollable impulse was getting to be quite meddlesome really. And if he didn't shape up soon everybody would mistake him for being a bloody Gryffindor. He scowled, and swiftly marched over to his son. “I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer, Borgin.” With this he sent a cold glare to both the greasy retailer and his son. At least Borgin looked rightfully abashed, his son just looked defiant. Well, he’d just have to fix that.
His breathing grew panicky, and he instantly recalled trying to run from Daphne. Had he fainted? No, that wouldn’t explain the essay, or why he was in the common room instead of the infirmary. Those thoughts only made him panic further.
Dumbledore laughed. It was a sharp, amused laugh, but a laugh all the same. His eyes now twinkled in amusement, and Draco felt irritation rise in him. He’d have been better off going to the Aurors himself.
Reverse the events that have yet to unfold, tell the story that was never told.
Draco couldn’t breath for a second, and he was tempted to slow down. He couldn’t though, not after Daphne’s confession. He had to make sure the diary was safe, and that he hid it properly next time.
The words made Draco nod quickly. He knew this task was important, and he didn't aim to disappoint. “Yes father. I've got it all planned out.”
‘Tom riddle. What do you ask of me?’
Turns out it was an unnecessary precaution. The presence left as soon as it came, and Draco was sure he’d just imagined it. The uneasy feeling and magic left too. Draco was exhausted, and though he wanted to investigate this strange occurrence, he was exhausted.
The classroom door was open when they arrived, and so the Slytherin’s took their seats and got ready for class. Draco was sitting with Blaise today, and Pansy was in front of them. As the desks had been transfigured to accommodate two people rather than three, Draco presumed they would be doing partner work today.
“Yes. I put my notes in there.”
“That true Ginny?” Fred asked. The younger girl frowned, then she looked at McLaggen with disgust.
“Draco, come,” his father barked with an air of finality. With this, Lucius turned around and headed for the exit, and Mr. Borgin slouched to the door behind his counter. With one quick motion, Draco grabbed the ring and stuffed it in his pocket. As he turned to follow his father he remembered Lucius’s previous comment about him amounting to no more than a thief. And so, with a determined gleam in his eyes, Draco turned back around to where the ring used to lay and pulled 7 galleons out of pocket, placing them in the empty space on the shelf. “We’ll see how much of a thief I amount to,” Draco whispered snidely. And, before his father could call out to him again, Draco rushed out the exit of the small shop- toying with the ring now in his pocket and sliding it on his index finger. A smug smile graced his lips.
Blaise smiled sweetly, “You’re deflecting Draco. We-“ he motioned to himself and Astoria- “were discussing Ginevra Weasley's fiery personality, and how she so graciously defended Astoria here. Why would you try deflecting in a conversation like that? It’s perfectly innocent if you ask me.”
____________________________________________________________________
At that, Potter resumed his embarrassed expression and sat up to get the dried nettle from the storage closet. Draco shook his head and finally calmed down. ‘I swear, that Gryffindor will kill us all one day. And he’s supposed to be the bloody saviour of the wizarding world.’
Lucius smirked. “To apologize for embarrassing another wizard, especially a family member, and for defying them...one must owe the wronged a favor. Anything the wronged wizard desires.”
“Bugger off Malfoy,” Weasley growled. Draco smirked, this was going to be too easy. Weasley was always so easily annoyed, it would be nothing for Draco to get under the boy’s skin.
“So, Flourish and Blotts then?” With Draco's affirmative nod the pair headed in the direction of the bookstore. Though, as they neared the colorful shop they were both taken by surprise as the usually sparsely inhabited place seemed to swell with customers- particularly excited looking witches. Could this have something to do with the number of Gilderoy Lockhart books on his school supplies list?  “Go on in then Draco, get your school books while I wait out here. Merlin knows this place is already crowded enough without both of us going in.”
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
He cleared his head and willed his body to stop shaking. Once it did he went to the bathroom and showered. Afterwards, when he finally felt marginally better, he summoned Dobby and ordered him to bring him some muscle relaxing and headache easing potions. The headache potion was just to help ease the dull throbbing he felt in his head after the night's events. It wouldn’t do to let that turn into a full on headache.
“-And young Master Malfoy, too- charmed. How may I be of assistance?” As Mr. Borgin settled into a conversation with his father Draco continued to look around the shop. He had to admit, the jewels and books did intrigue him, especially the artifacts with the cryptic markings on them. Oh how he’d love to study them further; if only he could just get closer to them to examine the runes. As his attention shifted to another shelf, however, his previous thoughts faded. There was a withered hand on the dusty shelf, looking scarily like a dementor's hand, but intriguing nonetheless.
Thank you so much for all the continued support, and wonderful comments! I appreciate it so much. I wish I'd been able to get this chapter out sooner, but classes have been busy lately. I apolologize for the wait, but thank you for your patience. As always, constructive critism is appreciated~ have a wonderful week!
As Draco looked up at his father he realized he didn’t seem to be affected by the place. He had his familiar business like stance held firmly in place, eyes set on the path ahead. Looking around, Draco also observed the way the passerby watched them- they seemed to be wary of his father, clearly straying out of his path. Finally, they came to, what Draco assumed, was their destination.
Draco smiled at that. He appreciated that Flint would think that of him, because he knew that once word got out that he was Slytherin’s new Seeker...everybody would just think his father had bribed the team to let him in. ‘Which he still did,’ Draco internally sighed. Nevermind that, he was going to prove to the accusers that he was a good Seeker regardless.
‘More of that? Draco, I aim to build a bond with you. I can’t let you help me until we both mutually trust each other.’
“That’s a lie. I haven’t seen you check out a single book on anything non-school related. And I know you haven’t received anything in the post either.” With a slight pause, she continued, “The others don’t want me to bring this up because it concerns you and your family; and it’s not my business”- she said this in a mocking tone that mimicked Theodore’s- “but I’m bringing it up because I’m worried. You’re my friend Draco, and I know you hate talking about emotional stuff...but I can’t ignore this any longer.”
‘Now now, Draco. Don’t be so hasty. I believe the best way to strengthen this bond is by getting to know each other better, don’t you think?’
“Ginevra said she really didn’t know how it got in her trunk, and she looked very relieved when I brought the subject up. She told me she was trying to find the owner, but didn’t even know where to begin,” Astoria said calmly. “And, really, when she got the book for me there was no mistaking that it was yours. It has a really fancy cover, and a strong aura.”
Lucius spun his son around and shoved him forwards so he was no longer at his side. Draco fumbled before gathering himself in a hunched up position, his face aimed at the ground.
Draco returned his attention to her. “That came out of nowhere.”
Draco could feel his pulse rising as he read the words. Nevertheless, he simply twirled the quill through his fingers and started writing again.
“Actually, she has a point. Look,” Blaise said, pointing in the direction of Vincent. Sure enough, the boy was sitting by himself as Gregory appeared to be sitting with Tracy.
“Now then, if you’ll allow me to recount recent events: Daphne Greengrass was found petrified precisely an hour and 23 minutes ago. She was found in the second-floor corridor by Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, and Hermione Granger. The three had been at Sir Nicholas’s Deathday party before deciding they were tired; at which point, they all began to head towards Gryffindor Tower. When they, unfortunately, stumbled across Miss Greengrass, there was a message in blood on the wall directly behind her.”
“Now now dear, it’ll all be fine. Draco will be perfectly unharmed so long as he stays by my side. Is that clear then Draco?” Lucius asked, turning the conversation back to him.
Draco heaved.
‘I want to meet you.’
“Easy. First off, why are you so eager to help me? Secondly, what do you expect from this? And finally, do you trust me? I’ll know if you’re lying, and don’t break eye contact either.”
With that thought, Draco was pulled under the sea again. A wave had come and swept him under, and Draco didn’t try to fight it. The lingering hope in his eyes slowly diminished, until nothing was left, and all Draco could give to the bird next to him was a forced smile, and a soft “Thank you.”
The young Malfoy had been so excited he hadn’t even realized that Dobby had indeed already transported Luicius’s dinner to the dining table with a loud “Pop!”
Draco felt a liquid run down his left palm, the one gripping the wall. It gave him a momentary second of reality, but that was crushed as soon as he inspected his hand.
Draco honestly couldn’t tell how long it took to recover. He still felt lingering exhaustion for a good while, but at least he was able to fully function by the fourth day. His friends hadn’t brought it up. And that...surprised him?
Brother of three, with fates all aligned, unlock the future, change the time.
And, of course, in the near distance, there was the gleaming red of the Hogwarts Express. It was blowing billowy puffs of gray smoke out, and you could see children and teenagers gathering onto the train in small groups. First years were heaving their trunks up to the train, while seventh years were taking in the scene with clear amusement before finally helping the 11 year olds.
It seemed simple enough to Draco. He hadn’t been expecting any of the Dark Lord’s tasks to be anywhere near pleasant anyways. “Alright. Do what you need to,” Draco said determinedly.
I apologize that this chapter took longer to complete, but I hope you enjoyed it all the same. In actuality, I really like the story’s timing in correlation to our real world timing because I plan to release the next chapter (that involves the Halloween feast) on/near Halloween. Thank you so much for reading this, and I am so grateful for all the support! Constructive criticism is appreciated- have a lovely week.
Draco sat on the settee in the library, a stack of books on ancient pureblood rituals, sayings, customs, and history beside him. He flipped through a book involving reconciliation rituals, hoping to find one that would work for his situation. He knew he’d impress his father greatly if he performed the correct one for him- it would be more meaningful than any simple “I’m sorry.”
Turns out, he wasn’t that stupid. Fred Weasley snarled before casting a non-verbal spell at the Malfoy heir. Draco felt a numbness in his right cheek and then, a second later, he felt nothing. The twin had healed him.
Draco breathed in and gripped his trunk’s handle, willing the feeling of unease to dampen. Once it did, he made his way down the stairs to the front entrance of the Manor, where his parents were waiting for him.
So, there he was. Alone in Dumbledore’s office, with a fiery bird still resting on his shoulder. Draco curled his hand into a fist restlessly but winced when one of his nails pressed into one of the cuts. He’d almost forgotten that he’d been injured. Or, rather, he didn’t care.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“How do you know that?!” Draco snapped.
Draco cursed himself. He should’ve known Snape would interpret his use of his formal title as a defensive strategy. ‘Well, he wasn’t exactly wrong…’
‘How will you ever trust me then?’
‘Granger’ he scowled. Of course she would get the top marks, that bloody know it all was simply infuriating. And of course she had to be friends with Potter. He was even more annoying than her, and that in itself was honestly impressive. But, although Granger's continuous babbling about what she'd read on just about anything was enough to make Draco greatly annoyed, nobody got his blood boiling quite like Potter did.
Draco had sat in front of the fireplace for some time; just watching the flames flicker and rise, then start to die out before resurgeing again. ‘House elf magic, no doubt.’  He’d also opened the ink bottle and dipped the quill in, and just watched the ink slowly drip from it and dry out. He couldn’t bring himself to put the quill to the diary’s parchment.
A small part of Draco’s mind congratulated him on the fact that he was able to mix a smidge of the truth into this. It made him sound believable. At the same time, he hated how it made him inadvertently confront his emotions towards the diary, and the task in general. It made him wonder about what Riddle had done to him- and he really didn’t want his thoughts to go there.
“There’s nowhere to sit, professor,” Potter grit out. Anger flared in Snape’s eyes as he stared at Potter with cold fury. Draco simply chuckled lightly. Maybe this morning wasn’t all bad.
Brushing that aside, Draco returned back to the present. “He wouldn’t want that,” Draco agreed. “But I know this research means a lot to him, and it’s imperative I learn it before the summer holiday. At the end of the semester there’s always so much work, and then exams to worry about. I can’t procrastinate on this. Besides, I want to do this for him.”
But even as he protested, he knew deep down that the tremors were caused by fear. The chattering of his friend’s voices had drifted away hours ago- as they all broke off one by one and headed to bed. Draco had been the last to leave the common room, and as he made his way to his dorm he couldn’t help but grow more and more nervous.
It lasted for seconds, but Draco was so dazed that it felt like hours. Finally, Draco felt as though he’d landed. It wasn't a hard landing like he’d vaguely been expecting, and instead he felt like he’d landed softly in a pool of water.
The feeling of unease returned later that night. He was abruptly woken from a nightmare; though he didn’t know what he’d had a nightmare about, he just knew that he’d had one. He was shaky and his chest felt constricted- which wasnt what worried him. He always had those symptoms after he’d had a nightmare.
“Hmm? Oh! Just the textbooks assigned this year father, that’s all.” Lucius looked at his son with curiosity, then met his son’s sheepish gaze as Draco muttered a small apology. Dismissing the issue as childish absentmindedness, Lucius carried on.
‘Don’t worry about that Draco. I have control over this diary, you know. I won’t let it take all of your strength. In fact, I can give you strength should I need to.’
________________________________________________________________________________________________
Draco was about to interrupt again, but Dumbledore continued, “Firstly, you didn’t even know of Miss Greengrass’s physical state- if you are the culprit, surely you would’ve known the difference between her being dead and petrified. Expanding upon that first point, you were quick to try and think up a petrification spell that could’ve been used on Miss Greengrass "after" learning of her condition. Furthermore, you couldn’t even provide me with a plausible spell Mr. Malfoy! And, quite frankly, your behavior here today indicates towards the fact that you are not responsible for this.”
Yet...the right thing was usually the hardest, wasn’t it?
Fred seemed to come back to his senses then. He gave Draco one last furious glare before he let go of him. He took a step back and raised his wand towards Draco. ‘He’d really be stupid enough to hex me? After what Granger said?’
“Now, Narcissa, the boy has agreed to stay by my side the entire time. No one would dare hurt him if he’s in my presence. Not to mention he’s already 12, a perfectly acceptable age to be making trips into Knockturn Alley so long as he is accompanied by an adult. Stop fussing over the matter,” Lucius clearly wanted to make the point known. Plus, he’d already been making comments since Draco was 11 that Narcissa had to stop worrying over him so much someday; that he was getting much too old for all the coddling.
“Have a fun time at school darling,” Narcissa said. Draco nodded in thanks.
“Right, then let’s not dither here any longer,” Lucius smiled. He took his wife’s arm in his and then placed a hand on his son's shoulder, drawing him into his side. When they were ready, he focused his magic in, and then imagined the apparating space on Platform 9 ¾. His magic flowed out and around his family, then swept them all to the space he’d imagined.
“No. It was not Mrs. Greengrass’s blood.”
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The cool water rushing down his throat soothed the ache, and eventually, his cough subsided. The water felt heavenly, but it disgusted him. The once cold, refreshing drink, slowly became warm. It grew to have a coppery taste, and Draco couldn’t stomach any more of it.
He convulsed.
“Still might not get expelled but..Potter’s certainly going to regret flying that car to Hogwarts,” Daphne cringed. She wasn’t a fan of Potter, but she did know how harsh Snape could be; and it wasn’t a secret that he hated Harry Potter with a fierce passion.
‘You’re a clever one. Quite different from your father. But yes, your assumption is correct.’
Before he could explain anything further- tell Dumbledore about the blanks in his memory- the other wizard cut him off once more, eager to put things into place.
Draco didn’t blame her. Every Slytherin got picked on and harassed, but it was always worse for the younger years. Honestly, Draco was surprised no older students hadn’t attacked them yet. ‘A group of Slytherin second years “skulking” about the Great hall’s entrance- the perfect targets.’
His thoughts overwhelmed him. There were so many ways this could’ve played out, and half of those scenarios didn’t make any sense. If he didn’t do it why would he have made Daphne frightened? He supposed he could’ve been imperioed or obliviated- which were likelier- but who would’ve done something like that to him? Especially at Hogwarts...
Draco’s first day back was exhausting. He woke to whispers of Potter, ate lunch with the company of those same whispers, and ate dinner with the same whispers. Not to mention Gilderoy Lockheart was a joke of a teacher.
The other Slytherin’s remained relatively normal around him; as did Snape. He made sure to spend more time with them, hoping to quell their suspicion further. He didn’t want a repeat of the events that happened with Daphne, and he knew indefinitely that that would be the case should the others get suspicious and question him.
“That’s fine, I’ll be there. Practice times are in the common room, correct? Draco said, waving Flint’s apology away. Flint just nodded before walking off. He was a very antisocial person, but he could get quite aggressive when quidditch was involved.
In unison everyone turned to look at the staff table, and Draco was pleased to find Snape missing. He figured it would have to be his godfather- as he was the only one to openly show his hatred towards Potter. Not to mention Snape didn’t bow down to Albus Dumbledore. And for that, the Malfoy family respected him even more.
Draco was jostled from his focus, and when he looked towards the noise he was pleased to realize that the sound was only a very asleep Blaise mumbling some nonsense. Draco felt his body relax after that, but the aftershock of almost being caught made him realize he’d been too careless.
______________________________________________________________
“Surprised to see you here Weasley. I suppose your family will go hungry for a month to pay for all those,” Draco jeered, pointing to the brand new books piled up in the Weasley girl’s cauldron.
____________________________________________________________________________
Draco should’ve known that he couldn’t be at peace for long. One moment he was listening to Pansy chattering on about the Ravenclaws, and the next he felt nauseous. He figured he’d eaten too much, but the feeling kept growing. Soon after, his vision started to dim, and his movements felt sluggish. No one really noticed, but Daphne did.
“I did. It didn’t work out, did it? No matter, you are a much better candidate for the task than some first year Gryffindor anyway.”
“In a moment. I've met you, but I’ve also met your father. And though you seem nothing like him, I must be sure.” Tom Riddle said this in a cool voice, one that had Draco slightly nervous.
At this point, Draco stopped him,”The blood...was it…?”
Abruptly she slammed her book down- earning a murderous look from Madam Pince. She winced, and gave the librarian an apologetic look. Afterwards, she turned to Draco and signaled for him to place his book down.
Yes, Dumbledore was old, and that was easy to see but...not like this. The twinkle in his eyes was gone, and he looked weary. It made Draco nervous. Still, he remained strong- thinking of Daphne, and how she would do the same in his position, made him stay. ‘Daphne wouldn’t get herself in this position though, she’s too good for that.’
Pansy was about to retort when Blaise cut in, “Well...seeing as you obsessed over Potter all year long last year, it makes sense you wouldn’t notice Smith.” Draco flushed with embarrassment. Pansy just smirked and promptly thanked Blaise for his intervention.
Draco knew this plan would work. It was simple, but it didn’t need to be complicated for it to work. He’d tried casting the spell on the diary in advance, and it worked- though it did make him feel awful afterwards. So there wasn’t a problem with that part of his plan. Not to mention he could easily cast the spell needed- even wordless, but not wandless.
Draco thought about his options, and dismissed each one. An idea struck him. He wasn’t Potter’s friend...but he did know a lot about the annoying Gryffindor. He was his enemy, so naturally, he kept a close eye on Potter. And now, he was grateful for that.
Severus hummed, “Yes, I suppose you would be busy then. Still, it doesn’t explain why you couldn't stay back after class to say hello. Additionally, you seem more worn out. Surely you have time to complete your father's request at a later date? He wouldn’t want you to exhaust yourself to death.”
He gulped. He didn’t want to back down. But, logicly, Draco knew he wouldn’t be able to beat the twin physically, nor could he defeat him magically. This was a fourth year, and Draco was only a second year. His magic was strong, but it wasn’t as strong as a fourth year’s would be.
Potter’s gaze narrowed, and he replied with, “I wasn’t paying attention Malfoy. Now, shove off.”
“Sorry Severus. As I’ve said, I have a lot going on right now.”
Pansy seemed to sense his dread, so she gave Draco a light pat on the shoulder. He smiled at her sullenly.
He felt like one would after getting over a severe cold, and having to now deal with the aftereffects of it. Wiping at his eyes Draco muttered curses under his breath. ‘What did that bloody bastard do to me?’
Draco hadn’t heard from Daphne since the library fiasco. She hesitated around him, and avoided him more often than not. But while she remained frightened, she also conveyed determination in her looks. She was still watching him- more than ever. And she seemed like she was on a mission. ‘What’s she looking for?’ Draco pondered, more than once.
“Wait, hold on. So, Potter and Weasley couldn’t get past the platform’s barrier? What does that mean?” Theodore questioned.
______________________________________________________________
“But mother-“ Draco started. Draco had a pleading look on his face, his eyes wide with desperation. He’d wanted to prove he was old and brave enough to go into Knockturn Alley with his father, and now his mother might forbid him from going.
Tracy was talking with Millicent opposite Draco, and Daphne was sitting further down the table with Astoria and her friends. Eventually, Draco started up a conversation with Tracy on magic theory, but soon enough the conversation grew to include all the nearby Slytherins. Once that topic died down, smaller conversations arose.
Taking a deep breath, Draco gulped as he fixed his posture and met his father’s eyes. He summoned every ounce of remorse and regret he could and let it openly shine in his eyes; it was time to apologize to his father, and take accountability for causing that scene in Flourish and Blotts. “I apologize for my unbecoming behavior today father. I should have controlled myself better, as you have instructed me to do countless times. I let my emotions get the better of me, and I shall work on ceasing this unruly habit at once.”
He did that earlier when Snape first put the instructions on the board, and Draco could recall him doing it on many other occasions too. During Quidditch matches, in other classes, even during their confrontations. He’d thought it was a habit of some sort, but perhaps...no.
The task itself was simple. Draco knew this. ‘Come on, all I have to do is sneak this bloody diary into the girls bag on the Hogwarts Express. I can have Vincent and Gregory distract the rest of Potter's little gang while I slip it into her trunk, or bag, or something.’
Despite that, Draco knew he should be marginally worried; any other person would be. Most wizards- even pure blooded ones- didn't enjoy an object having power over them, even if it was to serve an almighty force. Yet, Draco had expected something like this. He wasn’t stupid. He knew writing in the diary would have effects on him because it had had effects on him when he “wasn’t” writing in it.
The older Gryffindor regained his composure then, picking up his wand and aiming it at Daphne. He was about to speak when Draco was roughly pushed out of the way by a hasty figure. Draco’s back hit the wall of the corridor and he looked up to see Fred Weasley scowling at the Gryffindor boy. “What’s going on here McLaggen?” Fred Weasley fumed.
Collapsed against the wall, Draco gripped at his hair with one hand and the wall with the other. The rough stone against his palm and the silkiness of his hair was staggering, but not enough to return him to sanity. Sanity....what a fragile thing.
His eyes widened. He hadn’t thought of it like that. ‘The last time my memory blanked I was near Daphne. The culprit must have wanted to attack her for some time now...but that doesn’t make sense. Why would she avoid me after that incident? And there was blood on my hand before I’d cut it too.’
‘No need to apologize, Draco. May I ask why you were absent?’
Draco drank the potion absentmindedly, and pointedly ignored the growing concern in his godfather’s eyes. The two then made their way to the Slytherin common room, where Draco was escorted up to the second year boy’s dorm. Snape let him go with a murmured, “Goodnight.”
He’d, quite possibly, killed Daphne Greengrass. And yet...he didn’t remember any of it. It was only moments ago that he’d been enjoying himself in the Great Hall with his friends- one of them Daphne- and now...he was here. He was in a desolate corridor, facing the fact that he’d hurt someone important to him.
Draco scowled slightly at that thought. The other houses were just as “evil” as Slytherin. Suddenly, Daphne yelped and spun around. “Astoria is down that corridor!” Daphne exclaimed, pointing towards an adjacent corridor to the left of them.
Tracy had helped Pansy clean herself up when she stopped crying, and afterwards Goyle and Crabbe had attempted to tell jokes to try and get Pansy to laugh. They’d been successful, but only because the jokes were so terrible that Pansy couldn’t help but laugh. So, even his “friends” had done this with each other; he just realized they’d never done this stuff with "him".
“You're not very proper, are you?” Draco laughed quietly. He’d gotten Acelin two years ago, as a present from Pansy. She’d apparently been drawn to the owl and decided to give him to Draco because “It’s angry expression reminds me of yours.” Either way, his mother had laughed at the small bundle of feathers, causing Draco to scowl- which only proved Pansy correct and caused his mother to laugh even more. His father though, why, he’d been horrified. Acelin was nothing like the refined, disciplined owl he owned- no, quite the opposite. Acelin was always causing mischief, causing mayhem with every delivery.
Though, that seemed impossible. His stomach roiled, and his breathing was shallow, slowly decreasing as if it were going down a steep slope. It was asynchronous with his heart, which was beating wildly under his thin, white, button-up shirt. Oh Merlin, his shirt. It stuck to him obscenely; like it was coiling itself to him, tighter and tighter...like a snake. Like the snake that was on Daphne’s uniform...like the one on his own.
Draco smiled. That smile dissipated when he realized what he’d have to talk to his mom about. He forced himself to continue looking at her, and he started to speak.
Surprisingly, when Draco caught his first glimpse of Dumbledore’s office, he was broken out of his stupor. The place was...not as he’d expected it to be. It was magical- the sheer presence of magic this great overwhelmed him- and unlike any traditional wizard’s office he’d ever seen. Instead of hard-backed wooden chairs, quills and stacks of parchment, and a clean fireplace, Draco was greeted with cushioned seats, trinkets of all kinds, a bowl of assorted candies, and a roaring fireplace where a bright phoenix seemed to reside.
When she seemed to settle on her response, she returned her attention back to him. “Why should I be another gloomy, angst ridden Slytherin when our house already has enough of those? I mean, I’d like to have a bit of a personality, thank you.”
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Draco always regarded his friends as people whom he didn’t mind conversing and joking with, and people who he hoped to know forever. They sparked something lighthearted and free in him; something he didn’t feel at home, or in classes. He had grown up with these people, and he knew so much about them. And in turn...they knew so much more about Draco than anyone else.
Next thing he knew, he was slumped up against a wall. Draco blinked around blearily, and he pinched the bridge of his nose. He felt a dull headache, but nothing too bad. He felt the same as he had a couple weeks ago- confused, and like he’d just woken up from a bad nap. This time, it was easier to quell the rising panic because he knew he’d feel it. Also, this time his situation was easier to explain. He had gotten sick in the Great Hall, and had been on his way to the infirmary. He must’ve lost consciousness on his way there.
(See the end of the chapter for
Then, that miraculous event happened. But it wasn’t McGonagall, or Snape, or even Flitwick that appeared. It was Dumbledore himself. And he looked...old.
Before he could say anything, the Weaslette chimed in, “I don’t think you're all that tough Malfoy. You certainly didn’t seem it when your father dragged you out of Flourish and Blotts.” She smirked, and for a second Draco wondered if there would be a Weasley in Slytherin. He quickly dismissed the idea when he thought of the girl's older brothers. If that prefect, and the twins weren’t Slytherins, then there was no way she’d be one.
But Draco wished he could do more to aid his father and the...Dark Lord. He didn’t want to give such an artifact to someone who could easily throw it away without a second thought. But Draco knew this was absurd- for multiple reasons!
Dumbledore had left his office; trotting over to his fireplace to floo to Snape’s quarters. Students were forbidden to walk alone in the halls now, even if it wasn’t after curfew- Draco was no exception.
“That diary thing?” Daphne’s question made Draco tense. He really hated it when the diary was brought up in conversation.
“Those aren’t due till next week Draco,” Goyle pointed out. Draco sighed internally, because of course he knew they weren't due till next week. But he needed a good cover story, so he had to sacrifice his competence slightly.
The shore consisted of black gravel-like rocks, and as Riddle led him up the shoreline they came to a small hut. The place was abnormal, in fact, this entire realm was eerie. And when Draco really pondered it, he supposed it made sense. This was a realm that wasn’t supposed to exist- and was made up of very dark magic.
Draco’s subconscious reminded him that it wasn’t only the trio who did this. Almost everyone seemed to be open with their friends, and the Slytherin’s weren’t completely different. They just did this stuff in private. Come to think of it, Draco "had" noticed Pansy, Blaise, and Theodore do this stuff before.
At the end of the “herd” was the famous Golden trio. Granger went to sit at their usual table, and upon noticing the desk transfiguration Weasley and Potter started to quietly whisper amongst themselves. At the end of their discussion Weasley dejectedly sat next to Granger, and Potter scanned the room for an empty seat.
“Dracoo, Blaaaise- will one of you please come sit next to me?” Pansy whined, drawing out the two boy’s names. Blaise gave her a look that signaled for her to explain herself, and Pansy sighed. “Since we’re doing partner work today I need to work with someone reliable since I got such a bad mark on that last assignment. And if one of you doesn’t sit with me I’ll have to work with Vincent, which means I-“
Draco was unable to speak. Of all the things he’d expected...it wasn’t that. Curses, jinxes, shouting, and accusations yes- defense? No. It seemed his other yearmates were in the same position, as Daphne and Theodore just looked in awe at the disappearing forms of the two lions, their mouths agape.
‘Of course. What do you want to know?’
“Oi! Is somebody gonna wake the Slytherin prince up? We can’t be late to breakfast.” A Slytherin shouted. From the sounds of it, Theodore was the one who had said that.
Lucius placed the black diary down gently on the edge of Draco's bed. He then strode out of the room, but paused before he turned to close the door.  “Draco. Narcissa does not need to know about this. She’d only fuss, and you’re old enough to accept tasks of your own free will, aren’t you?”
Draco looked at Blaise with a bored expression. “Not deflecting Blaise, just stating the facts. We must not forget that Potter decided he was too good for the train yesterday, after all.” Blaise only sent an unimpressed look back at him.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________
Draco hummed in response. So Tracy must be helping Gregory then. Looking around the room he realized Daphne was working with Millicent. Theodore happened to be Pansy’s saving grace, “Blaise, sit with Pansy so she’ll stop complaining. I’ll sit with Vincent. Draco, you’ll probably have to work with a Gryffindor, but you have the most patience for them when it comes to potions anyways.”
This time, Dumbledore’s brows rose in shock. “Mr. Malfoy…” he let out slowly, “you mean to tell me that you cast an advanced, unidentified, petrification spell on Miss Greengrass?”
Draco stilled momentarily, but quickly wiped every trace of his shock away. Out of all things, he hadn’t expected the diary to come up in conversation. How had Goyle even seen it? ‘Doesn’t matter. What matters is that they don’t figure things out. Father would kill me if he found out I let other people know about the diary- and how it could resurrect the Dark Lord.’
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
“Yes father.”
‘I’ve never trusted those I haven't seen before. Words are a powerful thing, but they can’t reveal as much emotion as one’s eyes can.’
As he pressed his body closer to the broom to double his speed he felt the most content he’d felt all break. Yes, he’d already been flying quite a lot, but this was different. The other times he’d been all wound up over his father's mysterious disappearance as of late. It was like Draco hardly saw him this summer. And, aside from being at Hogwarts, he’d never gone without seeing his father quite so much. Even worse was that his mother had seemed to be taking this just as hard. It seemed father hadn’t told her anything because she simply didn’t seem to have the slightest clue as to what Lucius had been so preoccupied with- that much was revealed a few nights ago at dinner, when Draco had finally worked up the courage to ask about Lucius’s consistent absences. All he’d received in return from his mother was a slight frown and a quick dismissal of the topic, but through her façade he could clearly tell the matter was just as troubling to her as it had been to Draco.
Pansy looked around at the others, ensuring all eyes were on her. “I just heard those Ravenclaws who passed us talking about Potter. Apparently he wasn’t on the Hogwarts Express today.”
“Thank you mother!” Draco exclaimed, eyes shining with excitement.
Acelin sent a pointed look back at Draco, returning his expression, before giving him a slight nudge and flying ‘round the building. Picking up on the hint, Draco begrudgingly followed his owl, knowing that if he didn’t Acelin would only nip at him until he gave in. ‘honestly, being bossed around by an owl. Better not be a dead rat he’s leading me to….again.’
Granger was on her feet in a minute, and trying to settle the chaos as Draco thought she would. ‘Well, this isn’t what I had in mind...but it’ll do.’
It really had been a lovely summer so far. Draco Lucius Malfoy had been enjoying the warmth that the summer season brought, and had taken to flying around outside the manor most of the summer. His father hadn’t been around much, and with Blaize gone to Italy for most of the summer, Draco didn’t actually get much quidditch practice in- just flying. He supposed he had improved his seeker skills, what with all the “seeker games” he’d participated in (or, rather, him just absentmindedly releasing the snitch only to catch it again minutes later, repeating the action till he grew tired of it and resorted to flying around the grounds. Testing out his broom’s speed.)
Draco had been in the zone- intensely reading a passage about mandrakes- when Daphne interrupted him. With an internal sigh, he placed the book down. It would take some time to regain his focus anyways.
Sighing, he raised his palm up to get a proper look at the wounds. They weren’t that deep, just red and inflamed. Though, of course, that was to be expected. He felt a shift on his shoulder and turned his head to peer up at the bird curiously. He didn’t understand why it insisted on using him as a perch. Animals never liked him much- except for Acelin- so this bird was curious, indeed.
He couldn’t wait too long, or else he might miss the opportunity altogether- and Merlin knows he doesn’t want to keep that diary for any longer than necessary. But if he had neglected patience for this plan he would’ve come off as suspicious. Even Ginevra Weasley would’ve caught on to him.
As expected, he felt a slight pull in his magic- like a resistance. It was the diary’s doing, he knew that. But, even though he did manage to get past that barrier, he still felt sick to his stomach after the ordeal was over.
Pansy snickered from in front of them, and Potter scowled. “Why not get them yourself, Malfoy?”
“Yes. It’s made up of ink actually. And things work differently here. Since I’m not alive like you are I needn’t worry about starvation, disease, dehydration, or anything else really,” Tom Riddle said this with an air of nonchalance.
Still, he knew Draco wouldn’t cave at this point. That didn’t mean the battle was over. On the contrary, it had just begun. Unfortunately for Draco, Severus was stubborn when he wanted to be. And now? He wanted to be. Despite his initial reasons for accepting Draco as his godson, he did care for the boy. He’d grown on him. And he had hope he could become more than just his father’s clone.
Draco shook the thoughts off. It wasn’t his problem. He wasn’t going to think about that anymore- he was still feeling tired, and he wasn’t about to waste more energy on Potter.
Draco stealthily crept out of bed and grabbed the diary from his school bag. He then grabbed a quill and a bottle of ink from his nightstand before making his way to the sofas in the far right of the dorm room. Every dorm room had a small sitting area and fireplace to make up for the chill that usually accompanied the dungeons.
Daphne scrutinized him, “You still didn’t object to my claims. You aren’t doing research for your father, are you?”
He sidestepped the other twin, and the weasley girl, and made his way out of the compartment. Turning back once, he realized that Granger was actually watching him. She had her eyes narrowed in suspicion. Before he could contemplate it Draco turned back around and made his way to his compartment.
The Weasley girl looked back at Draco with apprehension before jumping to Potter’s defense, “Leave him alone, he didn’t want all that and you know it.”
Eager to impress his father, Draco instantly nodded. Making it abundantly clear he was fully intending to stick with his father if that meant he could go to Knockturn. He knew his father would be impressed with his maturity, and his mother as well after she got over her initial worry, if his trip to Knockturn Alley went off without a hitch. Plus, it would earn him some serious bragging rights when he went back to school- he just knew that Theodore Nott had been begging his father to take him into Knockturn Alley since he was little. Much like he had been doing he’d supposed. Either way, It’d  be an overall beneficial trip for him in the long run.
Draco could tell the fear and shock shone in his eyes brightly, and he didn’t dare to hide his emotions. The Dark Lord wanted honesty, and so, Draco would provide it. He gulped, “How can I prove that?”
As Draco read the dust covered gold plaque beneath the hand he became ever more curious. Before he could stop himself he’d blurted out, “Can I have that?” He winced as he realized he’d just interrupted his father's conversation. But, while his father looked irritated, Mr. Borgin appeared delighted, eyes lighting up in glee.
Begrudgingly, he said, “Very well. Do try and manage your time more adequately so you don’t fall asleep in my class again. Next time you do, you’ll find the results aren’t going to be pleasant. I’m not above a week’s worth of theory work.”
Granger and Weasley looked affronted. And Draco almost thought Granger would toss an actual stinging hex at him. But before he could find out if she would, he heard a scuffling behind him.
“Dispose of this Dobby. And don’t tell my father about this interaction unless he specifically asks,” Draco said as he dropped the ring into Dobby’s open hands. He was vaguely glad that jewelry didn’t count as clothing, or else he would have had to get rid of the ring himself. Magic was finicky like that sometimes; hence why he had to command Dobby to only bring up the situation to his father if his father asked about this particular scene specifically. He knew that Lucius was the head of the Malfoy household, and as such all the elves would listen to his father's commands over his. To combat that, one had to find loopholes.
Draco pondered on this. It was strange that they couldn’t cross the barrier. And it couldn’t be a prank either, seeing as the barrier’s magic was much stronger than any Hogwarts student’s magic would’ve been. Even a 7th year wouldn’t be able to tamper with it, surely.
Narcissa pursed her lips together and met Lucius’s steely gaze. She really did try to be sensible when it came to Lucius’s say on how Draco should be brought up. The pureblood customs, for example, where indefinitely things she agreed with and wished for Draco to be exposed to. The same with some basic dark magic knowledge- afterall, most dark curses really weren’t evil or anything. In fact, they only got a bad reputation because of muggleborn ideals; often ones from the medieval age no less. She scoffed, ‘and they call pureblood traditions ancient.’ However, when it came to things that could put her son in danger, or things severely outdated, she wouldn’t hesitate to protest against Lucius’s aspirations for their son.
“Alright.I retract that statement,” Greengrass said. Pansy only gave her a sympathetic smile.
She stepped closer to Draco, her heels making the soft clicking sounds on the wooden floor, and sat down next to her son. When Draco looked at her he saw the picture of pureblood elegance- as he always did. She had her silvery blond hair draped down her back, and her dress robes were a deep blue; they were striking against her pale complexion.
“Whatever. I’m going to get changed.” Draco stood up and swiftly collected his belongings, making sure to have an extra grip on his robes- and, more importantly, the diary. He wouldn’t put it past him for one of the other Slytherins to trip him on his way to the changing compartments.
“No!” Draco shouted. “I was responsible!” He was adamant. Making a last minute decision, Draco let the incriminating words flow out of his mouth. “Nobody else could’ve done this! I have literal blood on my hands!” He thrust his hands forwards to enunciate his point.
At the sound of his voice everyone in the room turned to look at him. They all wore an expression of amusement, and a slight bit of worry. “...mate, what happened to you? You look dreadful,” Blaise remarked.
At least he’d been able to write to his father and tell him that the task was completed. Surely, his father would be pleased with his timing. And Snape had mentioned something about bringing up the Potter- Car issue to the school board when Draco had seen him in the dungeons after classes ended too. So, all in all, it wasn’t a total waste of a day.
Draco was sure there was nothing but fear on his face as he looked at his father. How could he explain what had happened; had his father even seen the ring? If not, perhaps Draco could throw the damned thing away as quickly (and discreetly) as possible- it had gotten him into this mess after all. Besides, if his father didn’t know about the ring, and he brought it up now, that would only fuel his ire.
His mother had seen her son and husband off that afternoon with a false smile, clearly still unhappy with the whole trip. Lucius had simply kissed her cheek and given her a reassuring nod before taking his son by the shoulder and apparating away to Diagon Alley. Draco had left feeling elated as ever, but now… ‘No, I was excited for this moment before, I should be excited now. I’m just thinking about this too much, my father would never put me in harm's way,” thought Draco. With that thought of finality, he settled his features into- what he hoped- was a determined expression, and marched onwards with his father.
Draco opened his mouth to say something, but Lucius cut him off. “You have acted most unbecoming of a pureblood heir. Not to mention, you openly defied and embarrassed me in public- and in front of blood traitors, no less.”
They continued towards the corridor anyways, finally breaking through the crowd and into the empty hallway. There, not too far from them, was Astoria Greengrass. And she was being held at wandpoint by a Gryffindor. Behind the older Gryfindor was a small figure with red hair.
But going to Madam Pomfrey was no use. She would want to know why he had come to her twice in such a short time span. Draco wasn’t naive enough to think she would buy his cover story this time. And if she did, well, she would probably talk with his teachers about the fatigue. Which would only lead to Snape being suspicious of him, and the other teachers believing he couldn’t handle a second year’s workload. Which would make him look worse than Granger- again.
“Really? What do I have to do then?” Draco leaned forward expectantly, dropping his book off to the side.
After Draco’s conversation with Snape he did, admittedly, feel better. His friends seemed to brighten at his lighter mood, and he was even able to joke with them more freely than he’d done in weeks.
“Lucius, is that really a good idea? You know as well as I do that Knockturn is no place for a child,” Narcissa had input, sending her husband a questioning look. Obviously the matter hadn’t been talked over with his mother yet.
That wasn’t a problem. It would seem natural that he had his wand out to defend himself should Potter and Weasley direct their ire at him. And since he could cast the spell non-verbally, well, that just meant no one would suspect anything.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The rest of the day went by quickly, and before Draco knew it, dinner was over and he was heading to the Slytherin common room. Once there he brushed his friends off and went straight to the dorm room. He placed his bag down and didn't bother to get changed into nightclothes- he just wanted to sleep. And so, he laid down on his bed and did just that.
In fact, less time spent concentrating on the diary proved to be a good thing. For starters, he was able to focus on his school assignments with more effort. And he had more time to spend with his friends, and himself. He got to write a letter to his parents for the first time in a while. He smiled as he sent the letter off with Acelin; his mother would smile upon getting a letter from her only son, and Draco liked it when his mother smiled.
Standing up was a tremendous task, but he made it. He lifted himself up, and, clutching onto the wall, started to look about the corridor. Peering around the corner, Draco expected to see Daphne’s body, but all that he saw was that glaring red message. Inspecting the area further, Draco saw that the water was still there too, but still...no Daphne. And no golden trio.
Draco's face scrunched up. Why would a Weasley be needed to revive the Dark Lord? “Father...why her?”
It took a while for the Weasleys to arrive, and by the time they did Draco was already joined by Blaise, Pansy, and Vincent. But, just as he heard Gregory enter the compartment, he saw a flash of red in the lessening crowd. One by one, he saw a group of redheads rush through the barrier. And at the head of the frantic group he saw his target.
But it turns out that receiving sympathy from another peer was worse. Daphne looked at him with that same soft, worrying look that his mum did. And that made him uncomfortable. She didn’t appear to be timid; just cautious. Draco felt his throat constrict. “The others were right. It’s none of your concern Daphne. And I don’t like emotional talk, so let’s move on.”
Draco returned to his room after the altercation with his father, and though his mother had tried to catch his attention, he’d paid her no mind. He would only start to cry if he’d stopped to talk with her. He only ever felt this guilty when he knew he’d disappointed his parents. Perhaps that was slightly concerning; that he couldn’t bring himself to feel guilt when other people outside his family were involved. ‘But that’s just how it is, and it comes with being a pureblood- and a Slytherin.’
‘How can I make you trust me?’
The small group pushed past the Hufflepuff and Gryffindor students, heading down the corridor after the small figure with blond hair. Daphne tried calling after her, but the crowd was too noisy. And too thick, because the next thing they knew Astoria was gone again.
He’d figured the sheer power in the thing had left him overwhelmed. His magic was still developing, and this thing contained twice his amount of magic. It made sense it would react with him in that way.
Thank you for the comments and kudos, I really appreciate it! I love that you guys are enjoying the story so far, and I can’t wait to continue writing it. The format is being sorta tricky, so I’m working on figuring that out still, but hopefully that’ll be settled soon lol. As always, if you have any suggestions or constructive criticism, please tell me in the comments!
And since the other Slytherins knew this they didn’t discuss emotional topics with him often, nor did they go to him when they were upset and crying. So no, his friends had been involved in these kinds of situations before (ones with concern and tears), but Draco hadn’t. The closest he’d experienced to getting involved with emotional discussions were when his mother showed him concern- and even then, he couldn’t stand it. But he did put up with it, only because she was his mother.
Afterwards, he rushed out of the train and back to his parents. They stood there watching him softy. Draco hugged his mother as she placed a soft kiss on his head. He may be 12, but he still loved his family more than anything, and he could accept small gestures of affection- even in public. When his mother let him go, his father stepped up and pulled him in for a small side hug. His father wasn’t particularly affectionate, but his son was the exception.
As he neared his owl once more he noticed another owl perched on the tree besides Acelin. The owl looked poised and, if owls could even look annoyed, well… it certainly didn’t appear to be happy with Acelin’s presence. Draco figured it was his father's owl at first, until he looked closer and realized it was one of the school owls. And the owl appeared to be carrying an envelope.
‘How?’
Daphne hummed beside Draco, “Congratulations on your position on the team Draco. You’ll be brilliant, I’m sure.” Draco just gave her a nod in thanks. She smiled at him, and the two continued on their way to the library. “O.W.L.S must be tough, huh?”
Turns out, Draco didn’t finish a moment too late. One of the twins had finally decided to just hex Crabbe, and he shoved past Granger. He grabbed Draco’s robes from behind and shoved Draco to his front so Draco could clearly see the fury in the Weasley’s eyes.
There, sitting side by side, were Hermione Granger and Ginevra Weasley. Nobody else was there. No Potter. No Ronald Weasley. He hadn’t predicted this.
“Stop looking as if I’m leading you to your death,” Lucius whispered under his breath, sending a displeased glare at his son. He then opened the door to the shop and firmly pushed his son through the entryway, the soft chime of a bell announcing their presence. Draco could’ve sworn he heard a soft scuffling as soon as they’d entered the shop, but as his father didn’t seem to be concerned Draco decided to not think about it too much. Instead, he took in his surroundings, marveling at the artifacts strewn around the little shop.
Lucius would have protested against his son’s actions right at this moment, as would have Narcissa- for different reasons, of course. Narcissa because he was her son, and she wouldn’t want him to spend his life in Azkaban with his deranged cousin and aunt. And Lucius...because Malfoy’s aren’t supposed to be caught. They aren’t supposed to turn themselves in.
But of course, Draco couldn’t even have a normal experience at a bloody bookstore of all places. Because there, submerged in the line filling up the entire first story, was Potter. And he wasn’t alone either as it seemed like Granger, as well as the entire Weasley family, had accompanied him. ‘This is just brilliant,’ Draco thought bitterly. Draco was suddenly overcome with a feeling of exhaustion as the day’s events- particularly his experience at Borgin and Burkes- finally caught up to him. ‘Perhaps I can just blend in with the crowd and avoid Potter and the other menaces.’
Draco flushed in embarrassment, he hadn’t meant to be told off like that. He was simply curious. A feeling of fury ignited within him-  imagine anyone in his year finding out he had to be told off like a toddler in an antique store. And besides, he wasn’t an idiot- he knew better than to touch potentially cursed items. He also knew he had to shake off this rage somehow, so he settled on venting to his father about the one topic that never failed to make him so riled up he would be practically exhausted by the end of his tirade.
Blaise nodded, as did Millicent, Daphne, and Pansy. Vincent went back to doodling on a scrap price of parchment, and Draco thought the conversation had ended. But then, Goyle spoke up. “Draco, where’s that fancy looking book you had yesterday?”
Fred nodded and stepped to the side of the compartment. Granger seemed relieved at the concession. Crabbe and Goyle had stopped to look at Draco, waiting for his next command. “Let’s go,” Draco said, signaling that the two goons should lead the way.
“Correct. It’s where I’ve resided since my creation.”
There was a long pause. Draco had thought Daphne had finally given up, but unfortunately for him this wasn’t the case. “There’s nothing in the diary Draco. No notes, no diagrams, no spelled in pages- nothing.”
His father looked shocked for only a moment, before he composed himself and instead stared at his son lividly. Draco winced, knowing it was perfectly visible (he didn’t try hiding it- didn’t have the strength). This was surely a moment to look scared anyways; he’d just broken many family rules and had acted severely unbecoming of a pureblood heir. The others were still composing themselves, but it seemed they still had time to witness his father marching over to him in a fury. As his father grabbed him by the front of his shirt another figure entered the store and took in the scene- the half-giant hybrid himself, Hagrid. He looked on in worry, and started helping the scrambled Weasleys gather their things.
Before he left, Draco “suggested” that Crabbe and Goyle get changed too. He only hoped the two idiots would get the message.
He brought his feet to a complete stop when he reached the gargoyle statue that, supposedly, led to Dumbledore’s office. Of course, Draco had never been to the Headmaster’s office before. He’d never needed to.
Narcissa smiled warmly at her son before clearing her expression entirely and reassuming that neutral expression she always wore. She was glad she’d been able to make her son so happy. After the boring summer he’d had so far he needed it. Though, in the back of her mind, even with her husband's sure demeanor and her sons smile still alight in his eyes, she felt worried. She knew, theoretically, that as long as Lucius truly did stick to just Borgin and Burkes and then go straight into Diagon, things would be fine. However, as she would much later come to realize, her intuition had indeed been right.
This was the one class that he knew he’d always beat Granger in, and it wasn’t because of nepotism or Slytherin bias either. Draco was just extraordinarily skilled at potions, and the concepts came easy to him. Yes, it had helped to grow up with a Potions master as his godfather, but Draco could proudly say that he caught on fast enough even without Snape’s instruction.
