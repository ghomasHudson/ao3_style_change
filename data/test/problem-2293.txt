He hadn’t really planned on saying what he had, it’d just kind of...slipped out. Harry had been apprehensive for a second- please don’t run away, don’t get panicked about this, he’d been thinking wildly- but for once his random blurting had turned out to be a good thing. And furthermore, Draco had said he loved Harry. It was blowing Harry’s mind.
“Oh, we forgot to practice today.” Harry exclaimed quickly, rushing to change the subject. “Patronuses,” he added at Draco’s quizzical glance. Draco shrugged.
“Reading. I know it’s a foreign concept to you Gryffindors- oops, sorry, was that too complicated a word-”
The one exception to that had been the Dursley’s. Uncle Vernon had seemed glad to be rid of him and Harry had returned the same sentiments, if a bit less strongly. He wondered where they were now. The new house they were in was probably similar to the old one. Overly neat, and the same as all those around of it. As normal as they come, exactly the way the Dursley’s liked things. Which, of course, was why they’d never liked him.
“Peeves,” said Harry by way of explanation, sitting down and serving himself a slice of steak and kidney pie.
“Brilliant,” said Harry, who was weary of all the talking and scheming and his boyfriend falling from his broomstick in a murder attempt. What he needed was a good long sleep. Maybe that would help him figure out how to talk to Draco about his self-punishment-people-have-a-right-to-try-and-kill-me-thing. “Well, I’m off to bed, then. G’night.”
“What did you do?” asked Harry curiously, before Draco stuck his whole arm inside of the bag. “Oh, Undetectable Extension Charm?”
Fuck, Potter. Draco groaned and covered his face with his hands as the events of yesterday came rushing back in. Why, oh why had he poured out his soul to Potter, Weasley, and Granger? He had been preparing to give some simple answer like “I didn’t want you to die” but then he’d lifted his head, heavy with the weight of all of the things in his past, and seen Potter’s piercing green eyes, and he had just started talking. Talking honestly. He had said way too fucking much. It was like he’d drunk Veritaserum.
Camille asked Draco something in French with a mischievous grin, and Draco smirked before replying, also in French. Amelie snickered, and they all glanced at Harry. Talking in French again, looking at him, it wasn’t hard to guess what they were talking about.
Harry’s eyes widened and he lunged in front of Draco as a stream of black light shot from the boy’s wand. As he collided with Draco, pushing him aside, the jet of light hit his chest and a feeling like ice spread quickly through Harry’s body. His legs gave out and suddenly his body was hitting the stone floor.
“...so Luna- you know Luna Lovegood-” he said. “She’s a girl from our school,” Harry added to the Beauxbatons students. “She did it for me. She did one for Draco, too.”
“Come on, Draco.” declared Harry, and, grabbing him by the arm, steered him out of the ballroom. Draco sputtered.
“True. Harry Potter, the middle-aged man.” He snickered and Harry rolled his eyes with a smile. They were nearly at the spot where most of their fellow eighth years were fighting in the snow. It reminded him of that day at Beauxbatons, when they’d had a snowball fight, and Draco had fallen on him. He glanced over at Draco, who met his gaze with a rakish smile, his grey eyes bright and clear. He could tell Draco was remembering that day too.
“Yeah, no shit, you prat.” Harry replied, jokingly shoving him. Draco shoved back. “I just meant, like, versus a full face of makeup.”
And now… now Draco’s seated next to Potter in Potions, and he didn’t really know how to act. From the looks of it, neither does Potter. They’re both treading lightly around each other, and Draco wanted nothing more than to leave this horrible situation.
Draco blinked open his eyes to see the Great Hall, looking just as it always did. The four (now five) student tables, the stone gargoyles adorning the walls, the enchanted ceiling, currently reflecting a calm blue sky. Draco looked around, aware of Harry next to him, their hands still clasped tightly together. He saw the fireplace, flaring green as a student came through. The Headmistress was standing adjacent to the fireplace, welcoming each student back as they came through the Floo.
“I never thought I’d see the day when Harry Potter was teaching small children about the world,” teased Draco, his eyes gleaming mischievously. Harry rolled his eyes, copying Draco’s position as they faced one another, his head propped up on one arm.
“Yes.” Harry set down his trunk and ran his fingers through his hair. “This summer it’s been happening a lot.”
“That’s the thing I could see myself doing, yeah.” he replied. Amelie was pretty nice. “I taught a sort of club in my fifth year, instructed a bunch of other students in Defense Against the Dark Arts spells, because our teacher in that year was absolute rubbish.” She laughed.
“Merlin, yes. I’ve been waiting for this day to come for so long. I can’t wait to start the Healer’s program with you,” she said with a grin. “Also French boys.”
The painting swung open and he stepped inside, eyeing the common room to make sure Finnegan’s not there. Thankfully he’s not. Just Corner, Macmillan, and Bones. Draco jogged up the stairs and entered his dorm room for the first time, which was empty. Good thing that cretin Finnegan wasn’t sharing this room with him, Draco thought. That git would end up strangled in the bedsheets by weeks end.
“Sorry, sorry.” he said, meeting Harry’s eyes and smiling slightly. Harry’s eyes were wide and bright behind his glasses, and he grinned back before they set off.
“I told you it was a bad idea.” Harry answered wryly, getting up and fetching a wet towel. He handed it to Draco.
“You said Lovegood did it?” Draco inquired, and Harry smiled. One, at the memory of Luna, and getting the tattoo, and two, because Harry had an idea of why Draco was so fascinated by the tattoo.
His body was wracked by sobs, and he covered his face with his hands. No, he shouldn’t be here. He didn’t deserve this new chance, to be back at school, to travel, to have friends. He should be locked up, gone, dead.
He wasn’t the only one who had nightmares, wasn’t the only one who wandered the castle at night or stayed awake. Who looked in the mirror and saw a ghost looking back at them. Occasionally he’d hear Neville, or Ron, or Dean jerk awake at night, their breathing fast and shallow before gradually returning to normal. But he never talks about it with them, and they don’t say anything when they saw his bed empty at night or his vigil before the window.
“I believe Ms. Granger could be correct, I think you would be fit for the career of a professor. I saw you signed up for the trip, I recommend you take the teacher’s program at Beauxbatons, Potter.”
“Yeah, every week if you want, ‘Mione. But let's save the good-byes until we know I actually have a spot on this trip, yeah?” Hermione laughed.
“He sent me a note at lunch today, but all it said was to take notes for him and not to make a fuss. Harry dug in his schoolbag for the note and hands it to her. She scanned it before giving it back.
Draco sighed, clutching the edge of his blanket between his fingers. He’d been going back and forth like this for the past week and a half, and it was starting to wear on him. He so desperately wanted it to mean what he thought it might, but he knew it probably wasn’t. He was just getting his hopes up and acting like a dumb character in one of those romance novels Pansy read.
The three ascend the staircase and with a sigh, Harry entered the Great Hall. The stone room is brightly lit, the floating candles clustering together overhead of the seated students. It’s just as he remembered.
“Bit tetchy, Draco?” he teased, his green eyes sparkling. Draco narrowed his eyes, crossing his arms with a huff and blowing a strand of blond hair out of his eyes.
“Oh-yeah.” Harry joined him and they said goodbye to Hermione and Ron before walking out of the Great Hall and into the relatively empty hallways.
“What did you smell?” asked Harry, and Draco had to almost drag his eyes away from Harry’s green ones.
Potter had left him to the wolves and gone to bed, and Draco had explained very vaguely that he had been outside but broken his ankle and Potter had helped him back up, which was not a good enough excuse for the three girls, but he’d refused to say any more.
Draco took Harry’s face between his hands, tilting it up gently so they were eye to eye. He’s so beautiful.
“Oh- nothing. I’ve just remembered an essay that’s due next week that I need to start on,” she answered with a smile, which Harry returned. But his thoughts were racing. She was keeping something from him, so was Draco. But what was it, and why?
“Get up, you two! Help me beat these three!” shouted Daphne, her hands cupped around her mouth, eyes sparkling. Draco looked beyond her to see the three Beauxbatons students behind one of the snow covered hedges, throwing snowballs at a zigzagging Daphne.
“Now,” McGonagall continued. “To be eligible for this trip you must have no detentions-” everyone looked at Seamus, who scowled, “-and I strongly recommend this trip for those who wish to become Healers or teachers. Beauxbatons has excellent programs for both of these.”
“I need coffee. And I should be asking you that question.” Harry snickered again, and Draco smiled to himself, secretly glad he’d made Harry laugh.
“Yes, for the annual Crystal Ball. It’s wonderful,” sighed Amelie. “Ice sculptures everywhere, like huge diamonds. It’s a winter wonderland.” Harry raised his eyebrows.
“Not really, no. Although I’m not about to go trumpeting that, all the Prophet readers would mug me. I wish they’d remember I’m a person, not an idol.”
But after examining him, and bringing in professionals from St. Mungo’s, they’d determined that the Johnson boy hadn’t had enough power to cast the curse in full, so it wasn’t and hadn’t been burning Harry up from the inside out. It was just crippling, burning pain, almost enough to shut down Harry’s heart. Thankfully, it hadn’t, thanks to Draco’s stasis charm and sheer luck. And Harry had remained at Hogwarts, since his condition was deemed too risky to move him or Apparate with him.
Draco blinked, startled. It hadn’t occurred to him that people would wonder where he was, and the thought was disconcerting. But in a good way.
“While I wouldn’t put it the way Ronald did,” said Hermione dryly, “I feel the same way. Yes, he apologized, and yes, it seemed like he actually meant it, but he’s still Malfoy. Unless he does something more I’ll treat him the same as ever. Now-” she clapped her hands- “You two need to do your work still. Let’s start.”
After classes, Draco sat in his dorm, working on a particularly tricky Charms essay that was due in a few day’s time. His desk was by the window, which was nice, as it allowed a lot of light to stream in over where he was working. Harry was still out, and it was mid afternoon. The room was slightly stuffy, so Draco had the window cracked to air it out, even though it was so chilly outside now, it being early January.
He still needed to ask Draco about the contents of that book they were supposed to read. Hopefully nothing too complicated.
The window was open, and Harry could hear the faint sounds of a baby gurgling. The brisk wind rustled through the yellow grasses behind the house. Harry glanced over at Draco.
“Seamus started mouthing off at Malfoy and Malfoy was trying to leave, I think, but then Seamus...well, you saw the rest of it.” Dean told Harry.
It wasn’t just the looks that drew Harry in, though, although he admitted to himself that was a part of it. Malfoy was- intriguing. He was drastically different from the Malfoy Harry thought he had known, with the snark and the prejudice and attention seeking.
So Harry, with an inner prayer, channeled his inner Luna, who’s the friendliest person he knows. “Do you want to talk about it?” he asked, and Malfoy glanced at him again.
“Of course. You can just levitate yourself, or use a Disillusionment Charm. Don’t tell me Gryffindors never sneak out.” Draco said with amusement.
“My dad.” answered Potter. “And Sirius, Remus, and Peter Pettigrew. While they were at school they made it, and Fred and George found it in Filch’s office. They gave it to me third year, but I didn’t know who’d made it at the time.” Draco unfolded the map, perusing the footprints and names floating on the paper as he took in this information.
“Unfortunately,” he muttered. Draco chuckled and leaned into him briefly. Truth be told he didn’t mind so much. Harry was with him, that made everything better. Not that he’d ever tell Harry that. Gryffindor egos were sadly prone to overinflating, and his boyfriend, while better than most, was no exception. Draco chuckled again. Then again, Draco couldn’t belittle him for that, not when Draco was who he was.
“I can’t settle on any one memory. I’ve tried a few. Stargazing with my mother when I was little, the first time I rode a broom. Things like that.” explained Draco, twirling his wand between his fingers. Harry smiled reminiscently. “What?”
“Don’t get sick again, Potter.” he ordered, pointing his spoonful of chocolate mousse at Harry, who grinned back before snatching the spoon and eating the mousse. Draco’s mouth dropped open.
“Thank you. For listening.” whispered Draco finally, and Harry nodded, a lump building in his throat because that broken look, the haunted shadow behind Draco’s eyes, it was fading. The knowledge that Harry had helped him like that...Harry was glad that he could. Did.
“What do you remember from your childhood?” he asked curiously, and Draco’s face took on a pensive look.
He was pretty used to this focused, demanding Draco in Potions class, especially during test day’s when they brewed. Harry had learned just to go with it, and everything would turn out usually almost perfect.
Inside, the temperature was much warmer, and Harry shed his coat. Soon, though, his eyes were drawn to the pale woman sitting in an armchair, a turquoise-haired baby on her lap. Narcissa Malfoy.
“Not really. My brain’s just frazzled from this book we had to read for Potions.” Draco said wryly, tapping the cover with a finger.
“Why didn’t you just go grab him some from the infirmary?” asked Daphne curiously, staring at Draco. Harry watched him too; if he was honest he’d forgotten that was an option, but it was technically the more rational one.
“Oh,” he said awkwardly, glancing at Harry, who remembered too late that Draco’s tattoo was a little more, well, personal than his. For one thing, it was on his burn scar, which was still partly visible, and Harry knew he didn’t like to go around with that on show. And second, as far as Harry knew, he’d never shown it to anyone but Harry. “Maybe later.” he said, and Daphne seemed to catch his tone and merely nodded, turning her head to chat with Camille.
“If I fall in, my mother will be furious with you,” he muttered sullenly, to Harry’s laughter, before plunking down next to him and putting on the skates. The ground was very cold, probably frozen, thought Draco as he pulled on the strings of the skates. He really wasn’t sure about this, but Harry didn’t seem too worried. Although perhaps that wasn’t the best indicator. Draco gave another heavy sigh before standing up cautiously, wobbling dangerously.
“Oui, you are good at that. She did mine,” she added to Draco, who nodded. A few minutes later Camille took a break and joined the other three in the bathroom, where she exclaimed in delight at Harry. Daphne took her place in front of Draco.
“I figured if anyone would, it was you.” Draco let out a quiet, shaky laugh, and Harry, struck by a sudden impulse, curved his arm gingerly around the Slytherin’s shoulders, trying to comfort him, like he would Hermione. Draco stiffened a little, but made no move away, and for that Harry was glad, that he could offer some comfort or support.
“You’re welcome,” declared Daphne smugly. “So- so-” Her eyes darted between them, and the two French girls hurried up behind her.
“Where the hell were you all day?” she exclaimed, hugging him tightly. “We thought you’d died or something!”
He had been pondering getting his own place, since he would be graduating soon enough, but then he had gotten a second invitation- from the grandmother of his godson, Teddy Lupin.
“He was making out with this boy named Theodore Nott in the Slytherin common room when all of Slytherin house walked in on them after dinner.” continued Daphne, raising her eyebrows. Draco leaned over the table and cuffed the back of her head, to everyone’s sniggers.
Something in his past thoughts kept circling back to Harry, and suddenly he realized- he could check the Marauder’s Map. He couldn’t have left the school, so Harry could easily find him on there. Part of him was reluctant to invade Malfoy’s privacy, for Harry knew he probably had a good reason for leaving to go to places unknown. But Daphne’s worried face came back into his mind, and with a muffled curse Harry put his school things away and went to go check the Map.
“Malfoy and I have an essay to finish, so we’ll stay up here.” announced Potter, staring pointedly at Draco, who huffed and sat down.
And somewhere during all of these weeks, Draco had realized that he’d been, was, slowly falling in love.
“It was my dad’s, a sort of family heirloom, I guess. But he lent it to Dumbledore before they died, and in first year Dumbledore gave it to me for Christmas, anonymously.” explained Harry. He stood up and drew the Cloak over himself, and Draco made a slightly awed noise.
“I never said it was, Daphne.” She looked at him, obviously expecting him to say more, and with a huff he did. “I guess- I don’t know. I know obviously they don’t like me because of how I treated them in the past, but it’s not like I want them in my life. I might not hate them, but that doesn’t mean all of a sudden I have to go to the opposite side of the spectrum and become best mates with them.”
“Guess we’re the last. We’d better hurry up.” Hermione dropped her trunk with the other luggage and tugged on Ron’s hand. Harry followed them inside, glancing longingly at the quiet forest, knowing he’d be swarmed when they entered the Great Hall. Being famous was cool or whatever, but most of the time Harry wished he was just another kid.
Harry looks over at Malfoy in surprise. The other boy was leaning against the corner of the fountain, only a few feet from him. The shadows play over his face, enunciating the hollow of his throat, his cheekbones. Harry swallows and tries to keep his voice steady when he responds.
“You’re a pathetic liar, Potter.” Harry raised his eyebrows as their eyes met yet again, and Draco smirked back, even as his heartbeat quickened at the sight of Harry.
“I love you too,” Draco replied softly. Harry grabbed Draco’s hand, and Draco let him, with a roll of his eyes. And they walked back to the castle, hands linked. Together.
“Alright...Hermione.” he responded after a slight pause, and is rewarded with a grin from Hermione as they sat down. “I’m still calling you Potter, Potter.”
Three hours later Draco had bought an ornate bracelet for Pansy, who loved anything and everything flashy, and a billowy blue scarf for his mother, as well as a box of chocolate caramels from a place she was particularly fond of. He then had found a twisty abstract, green and gold-tinged piece of glasswork for Blaise, who had a collection of glasswork, and at a Quidditch supply shop he bought Weasley some good Keeper’s gloves, as Weasley’s were a bit frayed and worn. For Daphne he purchased a little silver charm necklace and some new quills, Camille a cashmere sweater she’d been mooning over, and Simon a pot of broom wax and a book of poems, because Draco had spent one memorable afternoon with him where he’d discovered the French boy’s fondness for poetry.
“Potter, are you smelling me?” Draco raised his eyebrows, but Harry saw a hint of a smile of his face.
“Didn’t you write to us about a ball, or something?” asked Ron, his words somewhat muffled by the food in front of his mouth. Hermione shot him an exasperated look and Harry snickered. It was like nothing had changed-not that he'd expected it to. At least, with Hermione and Ron.
“Go back to your bed, or when you wake up you’ll complain about the lack of space, you did that last time.” Harry pointed out, but Draco’s arms were woven snugly around him and Draco ignored what Harry was saying, his head over Harry’s heart. Harry curved his own arm over Draco’s back, wondering again that this was real. Him. Draco. Together, and not fighting every second of every day.
“Draco, darling, this is my sister. Andromeda.” She led him back over to Andromeda, and Harry took the opportunity to go pick up Teddy, who exclaimed when he saw Harry and
“Shut the fuck up,” Draco hissed, his eyes darting around. “Do you want everyone to know? It’s none of your business. Any of you.” Daphne opened her mouth to talk, then closed it and looked at Pansy. Blaise appeared confused, and Draco remembered he didn’t know.
“I almost was.” came Harry’s voice. “But I didn’t want to, because you’d just been sorted into Slytherin.”
He said a polite goodbye to Professor Suri after scheduling another meeting to begin working on his project, sending a fervent prayer up to the sky that it would work, and that he would be done in time for Christmas.
“You have nothing to be sorry for,” replied Draco, his arms twined around Harry’s neck as he looked up at him. “I probably should have told you straight up.”
“It’s kind of true,” said Draco matter-of-factly, walking forward and turning into the corridor that would take them to the common room, not the Headmistress’s office. He heard Harry’s footsteps behind him.
“So I take it the stargazing went well?” said Daphne, standing in front of them. Harry could see Camille and Amelie hot on her trail, getting closer to them. Draco’s mouth opened slightly.
“Of course there’s dancing, but it’s more traditional. And you don’t have to, necessarily.” she explained. “It’s like that Yule Ball they held at the Triwizard Tournament, from what I’ve heard about that.”
“I don’t want an apology that you don’t really mean,” Hermione said, her voice like steel. Malfoy fiddled with his sleeves, and Harry with a pang of amusement realized this is the first time he’s seen Malfoy feel awkward and not his usual aloof self.
Draco was a little tempted to sit with Harry, Weasley, and Hermione, but he did want to enjoy one last night with his Slytherin friends, who he admitted he’d been neglecting a little lately. So he ate dinner with the three of them and managed to stop himself from glancing down the table at Potter too often.
“So were you thinking of getting a tattoo?” asked Harry, and a look of relief flashed briefly across Draco’s face at the change of topic.
“What class did you have, Ron?” Harry asked as he swung his legs over the bench and grabbed a handful of chips. Some younger Gryffindors near the eighth year table eye him and whisper excitedly to one another.
The past week had been decent, in Draco’s opinion. After a rather, well, emotional Christmas, Harry had been treating Draco very delicately, like if he said anything remotely insulting he thought Draco would go back to the horrible mental state he had been in a few months ago, which Draco found slightly insulting, although he knew Harry didn’t mean it like that. So a few days ago Draco had confronted him about it
“I don’t really care what they think of me, Daphne. And I haven’t changed that much. Even if I did turn into a Hufflepuff and wanted for some weird reason to befriend them, there’s too much bad blood in the past.” And with that final comment Draco entered the classroom, Daphne following behind him. He had a feeling she’ll bring this up again later.
“Luna likes to visit the thestrals, there’s a clearing where they congregate. She feeds them and pets them and stuff.” explained Harry. “I went with her once in fifth year.”
No one in Slytherin had cared, and no one outside of Slytherin had known. And Theo had understood him like no one else had. He hadn’t judged him for any of it, which was something Draco had needed and had clung to.
“I’ll go get you some Pepper-Up. Drink the tea, it’ll help.” ordered Draco, and Harry blinked at him before smiling bemusedly.
“...spent the summer in Croatia.” Neville said. “They had a good summer Herbology program, and I got an invitation for an apprenticeship there for next year.”
“Thank you, Headmistress.” he replied politely, and she moved along the table to pass out everyone else’s schedules.
“Brilliant. I’ll send it off today, with our presents for them.” Harry replied, accepting Draco’s change of subject, and setting the letter on his bedside table. Draco made a mental note to get his presents for Hermione and Weasley separate from the others he had wrapped and needed to send off. They’d spent a rather enjoyable hour or two yesterday wrapping and comparing presents for their mutual friends, although Draco’d had a job wrapping Harry’s presents with him nosing in and trying to see what they were.
“Are you alright? You look like you’ve just seen a ghost.” Draco continued, amusement woven through his voice. Harry shoved down all of his nervous feelings. Act normal.
Once they’d gotten to the hospital wing he’d been given something for shock, and once it had been poured down his throat he’d been able to tell them what had happened.
“Simon said he might ask Daphne to the ball,” said Amelie with a mischievous smile, and Harry looked over at her.
“Can’t you tell what I want?” challenged Theo. Draco rolled his eyes, but before he could say anything Theo was kissing him, pressing him against the wall, his tongue tracing the seam of Draco’s lips. Fucking hell. Draco shoved at him, even as part of him wanted to lean into the kiss, it was so familiar. But no. Draco finally broke away and walked out of Theo’s reach.
“So, dancing.” said Harry. “I really can’t dance.” Harry smiled crookedly at Draco, who felt a wave of fondness for him.
“Yes, well.” said Daphne hastily, as Pansy had opened her mouth, most likely to aim some insult at Hermione. “Sorry we couldn’t be of more help. You aren’t leaving him alone, are you?” she added. “You’re staying with him around school?”
And today… today he had to tell Potter where he’d been going, and why, mostly because they’d made an agreement but also because Draco wanted to ease the debt that he felt to Potter from last night. If not for his unexpected arrival, it would have taken far longer and been much more difficult to return to the castle after his damn ankle had busted when he’d fallen in the dark. Draco sighed at the memory. He was loath to admit it, but being carried by Potter hadn’t been...horrible. He’d felt safe. Draco cringed and faceplanted in his pillow. This was just getting sad.
“Thank you for telling me,” Harry murmured back softly, and Draco’s fingers laced through his in a silent reply. They sat like that, each taking comfort in the other, until the sky darkened to black and the stars began to glow.
“Yeah, I see your point.” replied Harry amicably as they turned a hallway, entering one of the spiral staircases that descended into the bowels of the school, and came out near their Potions classroom. It got distinctly colder as they went down the steps, and the air became more dank and musty. “It’s so cold down here,” complained Harry, and Draco smirked at him.
“I’m going to teach you how to braid Draco’s hair,” she announced and Draco twisted around again to glare at her.
“You may sit wherever you like, we have no Houses here.” Madam Maxime waved a giant hand at the tables behind her. All of the students already in the hall were standing, all dressed in the blue uniform of Beauxbatons. A large crest adorned the wall behind the staff table, showing the crossed wands emblem that represented the school. As soon as
“Draco!” said Pansy in delight as he sat down next to her that evening in the common room, Blaise next to her. “You’re back!”
Draco strolled down to the student Potion’s room, which was one thing at Beauxbatons he liked that was not at Hogwarts. It was a large room, completely stocked with ingredients and textbooks, specifically for students to practice brewing. No one else was there at the moment, as it was a Friday morning on a day with no classes and everyone else was probably in bed or eating breakfast. Draco began collecting ingredients for a Pepper-Up potion, something he knew by heart as it was so simple, and was quick and easy to brew.
“Now,” continued McGonagall, with a sharp look at Seamus. “While sharing dormitories and a common room I expect each and every one of you to behave yourselves. As the eldest students in Hogwarts, you will be setting the example for other students. One of those examples will be inter-house unity. You will all be sharing dorms with students from various houses.”
He boarded the train at the very end and sat in the last compartment, locking the door and, for good measure, spelling the glass to be opaque. Draco’s resigned to a horrible term, but that didn’t mean he wanted to be bothered before he even got there.
Draco blinked. It was embarrassing to think that this had slipped his mind. “Yes,” he said. “That’s true. I suppose.”
“Normally Muggle technology doesn’t work around magic, but sometimes it will. There we go.” She extended the phone to Draco, who held it gingerly. It’s smooth like metal, or plastic, and on the screen is a moving scene of a man in a bulky white suit taking big, leaping strides across some ground of white-ish grey rock. “That’s Neil Armstrong. He’s on the moon. That’s why he can jump like that, gravity is lessened there.”
“You’re not mad at me, are you?” whispered Harry to Draco sitting beside him. Draco raised an eyebrow.
“Merlin Harry, your penmanship is horrific,” complained Draco, squinting at the messy scrawls. Harry chuckles.
Harry nodded and stood his trunk on its side. He paused for a second as his eye caught on a photo that Andromeda kept by the sofa, a shot of Tonks and Remus at their wedding. As they smile cheerfully in the photo, Harry looked away. It's painful to see them, alive and whole, in the photo, and to realize that they, like Fred, were gone. And he, Harry, was left.
“Colovaria,” he said, flourishing his wand, and the sheets deepen to an emerald green. He then transfigured them into silk, and admired his handiwork for a moment before leaving the room and heading down the stairs to the Great Hall.
“Yeah. At first I felt like I shouldn’t be ok with it, but we’re past each other. Just friends now. And Dean’s a great guy.” replied Harry honestly. Then, grinning, he gestured at their clasped hands. “Is it official now?”
“Your past doesn’t define you. You are more than your mistakes,” Harry said fiercely. “You are a good person, I know you are. You don’t deserve to be punished.” He was searching Draco’s face, looking for some shred of information.
“Sometimes I need to get away. From everyone. It’s like-it’s like a floodgate bursts inside my head, and everything comes… comes back…” his voice trailed off and he turned his head away again. Harry feels a surge of empathy for Draco, because he knew the exact feelings that the blond was trying to describe.
“Yes, though we sit our exams after six years of study. And from what I can tell we have a lot of the same core classes, like Charms and Transfiguration. Hogwarts doesn’t have programs for the sixth and seventh years like we do here, oui?”
gotten drunk, and then Theo had showed up, and Draco had snapped at Harry, which he felt like shit about.
He finally managed to skate over to Harry and with a yelp fell on him, clutching a surprised Harry by the shoulders. Draco’s relieved when Harry helped him up and kept his hands around Draco’s hips, a steadying presence. Draco’s breathing was a little heavy, like he’d been running.
“There she is.” Harry peeked over his shoulder and pointed at the edge of the map. Draco blushed at the other boy’s closeness, glad Harry didn’t have a view of his face, then Draco frowned.
Maybe this year wouldn’t be so horrible, thought Draco as he sipped his tea, but he discreetly rapped his knuckles ten times under the table. Not taking any chances.
“We’ll see,” he replied, and Harry shook his head, falling back onto his bed, lying down and punching his pillow into shape. It had been a good start to the trip, he mused. Harry just had to remember to write to Hermione and Ron by the end of the week. Hopefully they had an Owlery here, or an owl-post service in one of those towns Simon had talked about.
“Blame my father for my hair.” Draco said dryly. “It’s a Malfoy standard. I know for a fact my grandfather made my cousin bleach his hair because it was too dark and not on par with his expectations.” Harry chuckled before unwrapping his arms from around Draco and going to lug his trunk out from under his bed.
Draco was surprised when Potter burst out laughing, the bright sound filling up the room. And even more surprised that he felt
“Well,” said Blaise. “As long as I don’t have to walk in on you two like we did with you and Theo, whatever floats your boat.” Draco snorted and Blaise went up to his dorm, patting Draco on the head, chuckling when Draco smacked his hand away with a growl.
It was Draco’s turn to laugh. “That’s karma, Potter. Slytherin-style karma.” He kneeled down and scooped up snow, forming it into a ball between his freezing fingers. He could see Camille, Simon, Daphne, and Amelie throwing snow at one another and screaming in delight just behind Harry, who was watching them with his back to Draco. Draco smiled to himself, and walked casually up behind him, before yanking the back of Harry’s jacket collar open and dropping the snow down, smashing the remnants into the Gryffindor’s dark hair.
It had been… weird, thought Harry. They’d been pressed up against one another, and his face had been right in front of Malfoy’s, close enough to have counted the individual blond eyelashes that framed Malfoy’s grey eyes. For a long moment they’d just looked at each other, both too stunned to think straight, but then the other boy’s eyes had widened and he’d shoved Harry off of him. Harry didn’t know why he was seeing that as a bad thing-it’s not like he wanted to be laying on Malfoy. But some obscure part of his brain had complained when Malfoy had unceremoniously pushed Harry away. Probably just because landing on the floor was more painful than landing on someone else, Harry thought, adjusting his glasses.
“Last time she had words with someone they came out of it with two black eyes and a cracked rib.” Draco said conversationally.
“Just be careful,” she replied darkly. “If people go after you because you’re with him, and you get hurt, I will have words with him. Make sure he knows that.”
“And then I set Filch on you? Yeah. I remember being mad that you somehow evaded being caught. You did that a lot, evading blame.” replied Draco. Harry glanced over at him
“Damn, they talk a lot.” he said, but his tone was fond. Harry found a window seat overlooking the gardens and sat in it, and Draco huffed.
“Oh, here we are.” commented Draco, and the carriage slowed to a stop in front of Beauxbatons. They stepped out and began the walk to their dormitories, but Harry noticed Draco was still glancing at him every now and then, so he hastened to distract him.
“It was lovely to have you, dearie.” Harry waved, then he and Hermione began threading their way through the throng towards the Hogwarts Express. A knot of anxiety began twisting in his stomach as people start to notice him.
“That’s one too many, if you ask me.” And as the sky darkened and the train sped steadily towards Hogwarts, Harry felt truly happy for the first time in a while.
“It’s a little dark for a Seeker’s game,” said Harry when he reaches the others on the Quidditch Pitch.
“I’m not laughing at you, it’s just I always forget that wizards don’t know anything about Muggles. A video’s like a sort of moving portrait, but it’s a scene from the past that’s recorded on Muggle technology. Let me see if I can get a signal in here.” Granger fished in her bag and took out a small, very slim black box. She pressed a button, and one side of the box lit up.
It took a while for the other students to clear out of the Great Hall, though Harry’s spirits were lifted somewhat when he saw Luna waving merrily at him as she left, radish earrings swaying.
“Thanks,” said Harry. “I could’ve gotten this myself, though.” Draco decided to ignore that last bit.
An hour later the four of them left the Great Hall, and Harry walked behind Hermione and Ron with Draco.
Draco let the tear slip down his face, restraining the urge to rub at it and be angry with himself for crying. He’s tried that already. So he let himself sob quietly, bathed in the soft morning light.
Draco smiled at the other boy in the mirror. “You see? It’s not bad.” he said casually, like butterflies weren’t battering his ribcage.
For one thing, he was always scribbling away in a little notebook in the library, but it didn’t appear to be for school. Harry had watched from nearby once as he’d steadily filled up a page with his neat cursive before leaving the library with it, and Harry had itched with curiosity.
Soon the steady, slow rhythm of Draco’s breathing lulled Harry into sleep, and he dreamed of Patronuses, a silvery stag and a translucent Abraxan frolicking around each other, racing through the trees.
“Splendid. Now let’s go look at the dorm lists.” And without further ado, she grabbed his arm and dragged him through the common room over to the gathering around the dorm lists. Enough people had already looked and left that they were able to see properly.
“Alright,” Harry slid the cutting board over to his side of the desk and took the knife, continuing Malfoy’s chopping.
“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.” he said, squirreled away in his dorm, and watched the ink appear onto the worn parchment, swirling into names and footprints. Harry perused the small letters, searching for the familiar name. After a few terse minutes, he saw Malfoy’s name floating out by the forest, and Harry frowned. What was he doing out
Harry chuckled at the memory. Draco’s Pepper-Up was making him feel loads better, thankfully. He’d be fine in a few minutes.
Draco laid his head against the cool glass of the window and pulled up his sleeve. No longer was there a Dark Mark upon his arm. Instead there was a large, ugly burn scar. He shook his head and covered it up again, resuming his gaze out the window and avoiding his reflection.
thought Draco for the thousandth time, lying on his back on his bed. It was nighttime, and Draco could hear the pitter-patter of raindrops outside, a steady thrumming that usually calmed him. But right now he was a jittery mess. Draco rolled over, facing the wall.
Harry was walking down to dinner when he saw Draco and Luna walking in together, and hurried up to join them.
“...Alright.” he agreed. Soft whooshing sounds came from in front of them as one by one, students stepped into the fireplace and Floo’d.
When lunch is over, Harry shouldered his bag and quickly made his way down to the dungeons for Potions. As he entered the classroom, he’s pleasantly surprised to see it’s vastly different from when Snape occupied it. The room is brighter, and smelled less musty. The shelves that lined the walls held cauldrons, books, and ingredients, not the jars of preserved things that inhabited the shelves when Snape was professor.
“This looks bloody weird.” muttered the blond, and Harry smirked. It’s not so odd for him; he knew this is kind of what you see if you use Muggle night vision goggles. Both boys then cast a standard Quidditch spell that protected their eyes from the wind.
Draco’s head snapped up. Had he heard that right? He’d let his brain wander during McGonagall’s announcements.
“All I remember is seeing you, Weasley, and the Patil twins sitting on the sidelines the whole damn time.” commented Draco airily. “Didn’t some Durmstrang boy steal your date eventually?”
Considering all of the students in the hall, there’s a great deal of interest as to why the Savior of the Wizarding World is walking around with an ex- Death Eater. People whisper and stare, but Harry’s used to it, even though some people look a little hostile at the sight of Malfoy. Harry turned into the library, and Malfoy’s right behind him.
“It went alright, actually. Except for this twat dropping in,” Draco said, glaring half-heartedly at Harry. It was hard to be mad at the person who you were cozied up with.
“He’s in a bad mood. I think he’s drunk, too.” Harry commented. “I’ll keep an eye out for him, alright? I’m just going to go outside for a little bit to clear my head.” He waved and went outside. It was so much better, the air was fresh and cold, clearing his head. Harry spent a few minutes outside, before heading back inside.
“Nah.” Draco smirked. “You’ve carried me, I think you can handle some sandwiches.” Harry rolled his eyes and they kept walking in comfortable silence. Draco was sorely tempted to start a conversation, if only to distract himself from panicking over… his situation.
Draco seemed to be thinking along the same lines, because when he’d tossed his book onto his bed he sauntered back to Harry, who was leaning against the closed dorm door. He wound his fingers through Harry’s hair and pulled him forward into another kiss. Harry could feel him smiling. They broke apart, but Draco stayed where he was.
“Alright.” Harry said with an easy smile before speaking the password to get into the common room, and frowning when the portrait stayed closed.
“A French boy, then. Find one for me too while you’re at it.” Draco smiled, and the small bit of stress Draco had felt melted away. They walk down the corridor, and Daphne slipped her hand into Draco’s.
“Now, as you all know, there are no dormitories for eighth years. Therefore all of you will have your own common room and dormitories. On the east third-floor hallway, in front of the portrait of the red dragon. I will take you all there in a moment.”
“I’m sure he’s fine. He’s Malfoy, he knows what he’s doing.” Harry replied, trying to comfort her. “If I find anything out, I’ll let you know.” She nodded, and they went their separate ways. Harry walked up to the common room, mind still on Malfoy. What could he be doing, and why? Where was he?
“Ginny got Quidditch Captain, right?” asked Hermione, and Ron nodded. Harry tilted his head thoughtfully. Ginny would definitely make a good Quidditch captain.
Harry flinched a little at Draco’s voice, before meeting the other boy’s grey eyes, which were curiously inspecting him.
Draco sighed, letting his eyes flutter shut. Tonight would be a much-needed distraction, then. A knock came on the door and Draco sat up, hearing the muffled voices of the girls. Harry jumped up and let them in, and Camille, Amelie, and Daphne streamed in, giggling at some joke. Simon strolled in after them, his arms full of makeup bags, and Draco quirked an eyebrow at him.
Harry copied down an intricate diagram on how to Transfigure someone’s ears into leaves. “How was it with Malfoy?”
“Are you sure?” asked a Healer, her face etched with concern. “This is permanent, and the spell may have effects that we don’t know of, it’s such an unknown spell.” Draco exhaled, catching Hermione’s eye, then Ron’s. They both looked worried, apprehensive.
“They can fly! In metal birds!” he exclaimed to Daphne later, as they walk back to the common room. She smiled.
He felt bad for bringing it up, for dragging those memories back through Draco’s head. But Draco gave a small sigh, settling back into Harry’s embrace.
“And you didn’t tell me?” she hissed, smacking him, and Blaise snorted. Draco raised his arms to fend her off.
“Will you two just trust me?” pleaded Daphne, and Draco’s anger subsided the smallest bit. Granger sighed in exasperation and walked back to the group on the sofa. Draco felt like sighing too. He could try to leave, but he and Daphne would make such a scene that soon everyone would be nosing into his business.
worried about this still. Not just because I want to be with him, but because I want him to be happy. The way he deserves to be.
“Then I guess whatever makes you happy. I’m glad for you guys.” Ron finished firmly, and Harry felt a rush of relief. That was the best he could hope for, really. He exchanged a grin with Ron, feeling the comfortable familiarity of being around his best mate again.
“Didn’t you hear me, Malfoy? You should go throw yourself off the Astronomy Tower. Do us all a favor.” Draco clenched his jaw but didn’t face Finnegan, though he can hear the other boys trying to calm Finnegan down.
Harry grabbed his bag and trekked down to the library. The corridors are relatively empty; he supposed everyone’s already in the library or their respective common rooms. Harry entered the decorative arch that’s the entrance to the library and began searching for a book on dragon claw. He paced up and down the quiet aisles, occasionally pulling a book out and checking the title. After ten minutes of fruitless searching, he jogged over to Madam Pince and asked her where he might find a book to help him.
“Yeah, he did. We shook hands and everything.” Harry said. “I don’t really know why I did it. I guess mainly I just wanted to not have Potions be awkward, neither of us really knew how to talk to each other after he apologized. So I figured, you know, he made an effort, however small. I could try to as well.” He leaned back on his bookbag and his hands brush the grass. He, Ron, and Hermione are outside after class, high up on the hill that sloped down to the lake, enjoying the last of the summer warmth.
“Oh- damn. I forgot about her. She’ll murder me.” Malfoy groaned and flopped backwards so he was laying down. “Can we talk about this later, Potter? Help me walk back up to the school, because no offense but I don’t trust you to heal my ankle, and I can’t do it myself.”
Harry scribbled down his homework before joining the flood of people leaving Charms class and spilling out into the hallway. Now he could go to lunch, and then he had Potions.
“Will you look at that, my lips are getting cold too,” Draco said casually, and Harry chuckled, leaning forward to kiss him.
Spending the day like this with all of his friends made him glad for his newfound friendship with the three people he’d abhorred for so long, as well as those he’d known for a longer time. He’d had found himself enjoying his time with the other three, as weird as it was for all of them at times.
“Okay, yes, you fixed the Vanishing Cabinet. That maybe wasn’t a great idea. But if you hadn’t, you and your family would have died. You were scared. I get that. But it all comes back to Voldemort. You wouldn’t have done any bad things just by yourself, if he hadn’t existed, right? You aren’t an evil person. Just a normal person, pushed into bad situations and bad decisions.”
Hermione had done that a lot in the past few weeks. He knew Ron and Hermione were concerned for him. And they were right-he wasn’t alright. But his sleep schedule, was, he thought, something not worth being concerned about.
“Dragon claw? Let me see. You’ll be wanting NEWT Level Animal Potions Ingredients. That book has the best collection of creature potions knowledge, although there are other books with tidbits of information here and there. Ah, but someone’s got it. That young man over there.” She pointed at a far table, and Harry saw the back of Malfoy’s blond head. He sighed.
“Bye, Draco.” Draco was still looking at Harry as he said it. His eyes were mesmerizing, captivating, and it took a great deal of effort to turn and walk away to Daphne’s side.
“Yeah, Potter’s a decent flyer,” replied Draco nonchalantly. He tossed the Snitch back over to Potter, who snatched it before it can fly away again.
“Excuse me,” he said, but no one listened, and the crowd pushed in at him from all directions, and he had to shut his eyes for a second.
“Yes, but I haven’t settled on anything. I figured not everywhere will take me.” he responded, his voice getting quieter at the end. He shifted in his chair. It’s ironic that Draco’s
The second thing that was on Draco’s mind was Beauxbatons, and the rapidly approaching trip. They left in two days, and Draco was excited, not that he would ever show excitement. Didn’t fit with the aloof image. But Draco was- he was looking forward to a new school, new people who wouldn’t judge him as much, treated him normally. Even the
Harry dropped the thin chain over his head and it disappeared under his shirt. Draco smiled at him. It was ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous. It was like he couldn’t stop grinning at Harry, couldn’t stop watching him.
He thumbed through a nearby book, a small pang of satisfaction sweeping through him when he found what he needed and finished the sentence he was writing, tossing the quill upon the desk with a sigh. Just the conclusion, now, and then he could get started on the spell practice for Defense.
An hour later, Harry’s head was pounding with a headache from the Firewhisky and the noise and he left to step outside, for the cold air.
“Yeah, alright.” agreed Draco, reaching for a roll. “Pass the butter?” Harry did, and tuned in to Daphne and Camille’s conversation on the other side of him when Simon started talking in French to Draco and Amelie.
“You didn’t write about that! Blimey, who?” Ron replied in surprise, and Draco smirked, before sitting down next to Harry and pressing his lips to Harry’s. It was hard to concentrate on anything but the feel of Draco’s lips on his and the smell of mint; but Harry heard, as if from far away, Ron’s shocked sputters, and it took a great deal of willpower
“That’ll be interesting to see. You should be careful, your fans might try to steal some and give it to you.” Draco smirked. “If only they knew that their idol was horrible at Potions, had bad handwriting..”
“I’m sorry I got so mad at you. I think you were right. Yesterday Potter and I declared a truce, and I just had a rather enjoyable conversation with Granger… and I’m sorry that I yelled at you,” he said, all in one breath, and Daphne smiled and mussed his hair.
Harry’s hand was pressed to his chest, feeling his heartbeat. And Draco’s. It was so odd. But comforting at the same time. And that Draco had done this for him, agreed to this forever connection, made Harry feel honored, touched.
“He does that,” said Pansy. At least she looked a little more interested now. “I’ve never broached that subject with him. Usually if he needs to talk about it, he will. If he doesn’t, I leave him be.” Harry frowned.
Once Draco and Harry left the common room, Draco let Harry lead the way to the kitchens, as he had never been there before. Draco was in a bit of a daze. What he’d shared… what Harry had shared as well, it had impacted Draco greatly. He felt as if there was a huge weight that had lifted from his chest, a weight that had slowly been crushing him. He’d confided in Harry, and been comforted by him as well. Within the embrace of the other boy Draco had felt calm, safe.
“Camille, you can come finish.” Daphne called, and Draco sat on the bed, feeling very much like the bedazzled outside of him didn’t fit the lonely soul he felt like right now.
I mean, at least they’d accepted his sad attempts at an apology, mused Draco, pushing away his embarrassment. Not that he really knew what that entailed. Bloody hell, classes were going to be awkward as fuck. Every time he thought of Potter or Granger an image of himself talking about his bloody feelings came into his head and he cringed. What had come over him? He’d stopped looking at Potter when he answered Granger, but even when he’d stared at the ground he’d still seen those gorgeous eyes in front of him. He’d been speaking to Potter, really. Not that anyone would ever know that.
“Is there some sort of spell that lets you speak seamless foreign language?” asked Pansy. “I feel like I’ve heard of something like that.”
Dinner was delicious, as the house-elves always outdid themselves at feasts. Harry was about to help himself to a piece of treacle tart, before spotting Draco down the table, gesticulating wildly with an éclair in hand. Harry smiled and took instead a piece of dark chocolate, remembering Draco’s tirade about the horrors of too much sugar, but pulled a face at the bitter chocolate. Harry set it aside and took a slice of chocolate cake instead.
The two women took turns questioning the two boys about school, and their exchange trip. They answered patiently, exchanging glances every now and then. Harry itched to go sit next to Draco, but he refrained. At least until they told Narcissa and Andromeda.
“You are crazy, Potter.” teased Draco. “I mean, you-” Harry shut him up with another kiss. I’ll never get tired of this, he thought dazedly. But soon enough he wasn’t thinking at all, he was just lost in kissing Draco.
“That’s not a bad idea,” she replied lightly. “Harry,” she begins, eyes looking at him inquisitively, and he knows she’s noted what happened. “Do you get panic attacks?”
Harry stared after Draco as he strolled over to Daphne. The two Slytherins walked off, and Harry caught one last glimpse of Draco’s smile before they disappeared around a corner.
“Hey- hey. Harry. Look at me.” Draco’s voice sounded far off, like he was rooms away. Harry was inhaling quick, shallow, scared breaths, and he suddenly realized his hand was pressed to his scar, not because it hurt but as a reflex from the past. “It’s alright. Breathe. You’re safe; you’re alive. It’s alright.” The other boy’s voice was steady, calm, and Harry latched onto it like a lifeline and let it pull him out of his head.
“Expecto Patronum,” he said, flourishing his wand. The silver vapor that emerged was faint, and with a sound of annoyance Draco cut it off. “Expecto Patronum. Expecto Patronum!” he said fiercely, and suddenly Harry knew. It was going to work this time.
“Whatever you say.” Harry answered, his fingers now grazing the back of Draco’s neck. Draco shivered, and Harry grinned. Draco glared at him in the mirror that he was still holding up.
Draco closed his eyes and muttered a curse under his breath before walking to his desk and sitting down next to Potter. The other boy glanced at him, a mite too long.
“I can tell, though.” Harry replied, waving at Dean and Neville, who were talking about some class over on Neville’s bed. They smiled back; they were two of the people who hadn’t been really opposed to Harry and Draco dating. Dean had never really had a problem with Draco, plus he was a very peaceful person. And Draco had apologized to Neville one night in the dorm, so although they weren’t friends, or even friendly, Neville didn’t hate Draco.
“Okay, maybe you don’t snore.” admitted Harry, searching for and putting on his glasses, the world losing its blur. Draco smirked.
Hermione tapped his shoulder. “Look at the staff table, new teachers.” Harry nodded, then turned his head to the doors of the Great Hall as the first-years filed in, led by Professor Sprout.
“Especially,” she had pointed out, “since his father is no longer influencing him. If you think about it, he grew up only hearing that Muggles were scum. So of course when he gets to Hogwarts, he’s going to think that. But now that he has the chance to see different perspectives, different influences, maybe he’s decided that he disagrees with his parents. I’m not condoning what he’s done over the years, but there is a reason behind why he was the way he was.” Harry had thought on her words before he’d gone to sleep, and decided she was right. How had he not thought of this before?
“Well, why didn’t you use your wand?” he snapped. “Only a naïve git would willingly make contact with an unknown curse.” Harry shrugged.
“They can, Malfoy. Astronauts- that’s what the people that go up in space are called- go up in huge rockets. People have walked on the moon. There’s an American flag on the moon now. And Muggles have also sent out spacecraft that they control from Earth to explore things farther away, like Jupiter.”
“Not the poems?” he replies with a small smile. The sight of a real smile on Malfoy’s face is surprising to Harry, but he likes it.
It was December 24, Sunday, two days since the Crystal Ball, although that’s not what Draco remembered that day for. He remembered it because that was the day Harry had brought him up to that hill to stargaze, and they’d kissed. Started dating.
Under interrogation they discovered that he’d used a little known curse that none of them except McGonagall had ever heard of. According to her it had been used during the first war, and it was a spell that would burn you up, slowly, with immense pain, from the inside out. Draco had thrown up when he’d heard her say that.
“You think it’ll be like the Yule ball we had?” he asked, stepping around Draco, who’s eyes caught on Harry’s before sweeping away. A slight smell of vanilla was seeping from Harry, as well as the bathroom, and Draco cursed it silently, cursed how the warm, vanilla scented steam was wrapping around him like a blanket. Cursed the fact that he rather enjoyed the sensation.
The next morning, Draco awoke to Harry’s prodding his shoulder and he smiled sleepily. They went down to the breakfast l, where an owl landed gracefully in front of them, a letter clutched in its beak.
“It’s really nice.” Harry replies, filled with the sudden urge to intertwine Malfoy’s fingers with his own. Hold them tight and never let go.
“Can I sit here?” he asks. Malfoy’s eyes are unreadable. There’s an awkward pause before Malfoy nodded, the movement small and quick. Harry releases a quiet breath and drew out the chair before beginning to work on his essay, pretending like he wasn’t distracted by Malfoy opposite him.
Draco and the Aurors appeared with a crack just outside of Kings Cross Station, in a small copse of trees where the Muggles wouldn’t see. He irritably jerked free of the two wizards, and ignoring them, began walking toward the station, letting no hint of his dislike seep through his façade. That was a feat in itself, he thought, for he disliked everything right now. His two silent guards, who trailed after him, the fact that in a minute or so he would be surrounded by people who hated him, that he was going back to Hogwarts.
“Hurry up, Potter, we still have like ten people each to get shit for.” reprimanded Draco, his foot tapping on the smooth wooden floors. Harry rolled his eyes.
As the portrait hole closed behind him, he stared at a round room, vastly different from the Slytherin Common Room. For one thing, it was a ghastly shade of orange. And the couches, arranged around a merrily dancing fireplace, were purple.
Harry sighed. They hadn’t really thought of that, had they? Another reason he was eternally glad to have Hermione as a friend. She always helped him see things he couldn’t before.
“Yeah, yeah.” Draco flapped a hand. “I’ve been playing this game every Christmas since I was about eight. You won’t get it out of me.” Camille wrinkled her nose, before conceding defeat and changing the subject.
“You’ll get it, Draco. It takes time.” Harry said, obviously knowing what Draco was frustrated at. Draco huffed but didn’t say anything. He was angry with himself for having such a hard time with the Patronus Charm, especially since their mid-year exams were in a week and he knew for a fact that Patronuses were on there.
So Parvati Patil, who’d happened upon the scene, had ran to get the nearest professor, and they’d brought Harry up to the hospital wing. He’d gone unconscious at some point before then when Parvati had ran for help, his eyes fluttering shut, and Draco had pressed his hand to Harry’s neck, searching desperately for a pulse. After what had felt like an eternity, he’d found it, and an immense wave of relief had swept through him.
Transfiguration went relatively quickly; they practiced advanced human transfiguration, turning your arms into brooms, for one. Harry didn’t quite manage but all together he wasn’t that bothered (who needed brooms as arms anyway?) and had a cheerful lunch with Ron, Hermione, Neville, and Dean, who struck up a conversation about muggle soccer with Harry, while Ron and Neville looked on bemusedly.
The first impression he got was white-blond hair, glowing softly in the moonlight streaming in from a window. He was sitting with his back to Harry, seemingly looking at the wall, his hands braced on either side of the desk. Then Harry’s foot scuffs against the stone, and Draco Malfoy turned around.
“So tell me.” Daphne glanced at him. “What were the highlights of the little rivalry you two had? I never knew the full story, but it seemed like something was always happening with you two.” Harry smirked.
“Yeah. I can’t wait to see Weasley’s expression when he sees me-” Draco sauntered up to Harry and kissed him, long and slow and sweet, like they had all the time in the world. “-do that,” he finished, pulling back and smirking at Harry’s flushed cheeks. Harry shook his head, chuckling.
“Nothing to forgive,” she replied warmly. Her words hit Draco directly in the heart. Nothing to forgive. But he’s done so many horrible things, and even though he knows that she wasn’t talking about the things he’s done in the past, some part of him still wonders why. Why people still want to be his friend.
Harry appreciated this brief moment in which he and Malfoy shared this one thing, knowing that in the morning the other boy will probably act like this never happened.
His nights with Theo had been one of the only bright spots in sixth year. They’d liked each other and since neither of their fathers would allow them to date boys - they were both first-born sons, and were expected to produce heirs sooner than later - they had compensated by meeting up every now and then. Pretending for a while.
Especially since this was Draco, Harry knew how much it took for him to say something like that. Or to trust Harry, and follow his lead on how to deal with the people at Hogwarts.
“That sounds cool.” she said. “This program is pretty lax, really. We take turns instructing the class, with the professor looking on, and every week we go and spend the class at a nearby local magic school for younger kids, and act as teacher’s assistants and things like that. It’s not hard, but it’s good practice.”
With a pop, Harry and Draco materialized in front of Andromeda’s house. Harry had guided them this time, since Draco had never been to Andromeda’s house, let alone met her.
Potter. Draco turned away from the window and rested his head on the seat. He had enough on his mind already without the darling of the Wizarding World intruding on his thoughts.
Draco huffed as he remembers the conversation he and Daphne had shared before Potions class earlier in the week. “Daphne, we’ve already talked about this. I don’t want her in
Horror was prickling his skin, not because of it, but because Draco had felt so bad that he’d- he’d tried to do that. Harry hated the idea of Draco being so miserable. He also hated the idea of a world without him. Could not imagine it, nor wanted to.
“Sure, Harry. At least I can get my hair to cooperate. Yours looks like it’s been through a blender.” he replied somewhat scathingly, but nudged Harry’s foot under the table. Harry trapped Draco’s foot in between both of his own, and Draco scowled, looking up at Harry’s rakish grin as he tried unsuccessfully to get his foot back. “Hey! Let go!”
“What are you always writing in that notebook of yours?” he asks, hoping he’s not overstepping. Malfoy opens his mouth slightly before closing it again. His expression reminds Harry of when they’d first encountered one another at night. Surprised, maybe a little scared. But as soon as he notices this, it melts away and Malfoy looks calmer.
“Furthermore, our Caretaker, Mr. Filch has posted a list of all items banned from the school, which I believe includes a great deal of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes products.” McGonagall continued. “Those of you wishing to try out for your House Quidditch team will submit their names to their Head of House, and Quidditch Captains will organize tryouts. Likewise for Quidditch Commentators. Now, off to your dormitories everyone, and schedules will be handed out in the morning. Eighth Years, please stay behind.”
The blond raised his head and locked eyes with Harry. Draco seemed to search Harry’s eyes, looking for something, and Harry let him, patiently looking into Draco’s wide grey eyes.
Another thing Draco’s come to love is the Healer program. The first time they interned at the nearby magical hospital, he was a hesitant mess of nerves. But now with three trips down, he’s looking forward to the next one, and enjoyed all of his classes. Enjoyed learning new spells, brewing new potions, even studying past cases and remedies. It warmed him up from the inside that learning all of this could help people, could save lives. Make a difference in the best way.
“I love you too,” he murmured, and Harry’s eyes softened. The words were easier to say than he’d expected, but he’d been meaning to say them for a while now.
“Cute,” Draco said, smirking. He snagged a little pastry from behind him and popped it in his mouth, humming appreciatively as the flavors hit his tongue. Harry snorted as he watched Draco.
“Thanks,” Harry said, letting out a breath. “It- the fire- it reminded me of...” he trailed off, slightly embarrassed.
Draco thought that January had gone by entirely too quickly; it was the dawn of their last day at Beauxbatons, and he could barely wrap his mind around that. Lying in his bed, with the chilly morning breeze from the window streaming into the room, it seemed like any other day that they’d had, no different.
Suddenly Harry put a hand under Draco’s chin and brought his lips to Draco’s for a chaste, slow kiss. They parted, and Draco stared at him indignantly.
He entered the library, smiled when he saw Daphne, then stopped abruptly. He had forgotten about Daphne’s bloody study group, with Granger in it. Now it all made sense. He closed his eyes in exasperation. She was a good friend, she was, but she didn’t know when to stop.
“I’m fine being alone.” he muttered, fidgeting with his wand, fingers moving over the well-worn wood. It was true. He’d shut himself up in his bedroom most of the summer, or wandered the grounds by himself, which had worried his mother.
Harry snorted. “It is, pretty much. But it’s nice. Are students here in school for seven years also?”
So it had been Harry that Draco had heard in the hallway. Fucking wonderful. Now I’ve ruined everything, thought Draco woozily.
“What happened, Seamus?” Harry asked again. The other boy won’t meet Harry’s eyes but stared at his shoes. Harry let out a breath and turned his attention to Dean.
Hermione had told him and Ron about her time with Malfoy and Daphne in the library, about how she had explained astronauts and airplanes to him. She’d had to backtrack and actually explain them to Ron, who demanded to know, before he muttered that Malfoy was turning into his dad. Harry had chuckled, knowing Arthur Weasley would’ve been just as enthusiastic as Hermione had described Malfoy to be, although Ron’s dad already knew about airplanes and probably astronauts as well.
“Here we are.” Draco was shaken out of his thoughts by the familiar voice, and looked up to see Harry standing in front of a painting of a fruit bowl. Harry grinned. “Tickle the pear.”
Malfoy regarded him with an appraising stare. The blank look Harry had noticed earlier is gone from his eyes, which fills him with an odd sense of relief.
Weasley let out an impressively lengthy sigh. “Fine, ‘Mione.” With that final word the three tramp back over to where Draco lounged on the couch, Weasley looking disgruntled.
“I’m so glad for the both of you,” she went on. “The both of you needed something, well, happier in your life!” Harry snorted.
“Er. Malfoy?” said Harry tentatively. There’s a flash of grey eyes as Malfoy looked at Harry, then back down. Malfoy dropped the Shrivelfig in the cauldron and reached for the next thing. “I didn’t make you mad, did I?” prodded Harry carefully.
Draco’s lips were ever so soft as they moved against Harry’s, and their tongues were touching, and dancing around each other, and Harry’s head was filled with a pleasant dizziness, and his skin tingled where Draco’s hands touched him, pulled him closer, wandering over his shoulders and his neck and through his hair. It was intoxicating, like a drug, and Harry wondered woozily why they hadn’t done this sooner, and sparks were flying like the stars had been earlier behind Harry’s closed eyes-
“Ooh, me too.” exclaimed Daphne. “I wonder how these new professors will measure up.” A few minutes later the two of them left the Great Hall and head up the stairs to Transfiguration.
“Not really, no.” he admitted. Obviously when he’d been lost in his head they’d gone around and shared or something. Draco caught his eye and tipped his head toward the entrance, mouthing
He finally looked around at Harry, who was still asleep, seeing as it was the weekend and they didn’t have classes. Draco smiled fondly at Harry, seeing as Harry was asleep and couldn’t see Draco’s obvious show of affection. His hair lay messily on his forehead, and his lips were parted slightly, drawing in deep, slow breaths as he slept. He looked different with his glasses off- a little younger.
Malfoy doesn’t say anything, just continues to watch Harry skittishly, his eyes darting around the room. Harry has the feeling that if there had been more than one way into the classroom, Malfoy would already have bolted away, but Harry was standing in front of the only door.
But the blond took a deep breath and stepped over the threshold, and they walked down to the common room in companionable silence.
Draco was motionless for a second, and Harry could see panic building in the other boy’s eyes, and felt like a dunce for bringing it up. But before he could apologize again, Draco pulled up his sleeve all the way and lay his arm on his knee, staring at the scar.
The staircase they were on began to move, and they paused halfway up, waiting for it to settle. Once it did, the stone sliding into place with a small scrape, Harry and Draco jogged up the staircase and entered another hall. Their footsteps were in time, noticed Harry. He glanced over at Draco as they stopped in front of the dragon.
“Well, shall we be off, then? Since we’re Apparating together?” said Draco, a sparkle of anticipation in his eyes. Harry smiled.
Harry followed Amelie to a spacious classroom. It must be at the top of the school, he thought, because there were skylights on the ceilings, making the room bright and airy.
Draco explored his memories, speeding past all the negative ones, examining each good memory with a critical eye. What he’d been choosing before obviously hadn’t been strong enough. Draco thought he could tell why; the happy feeling he’d had had always been interlaced with some stress or worry- even when he’d been stargazing with his mother when he was younger, he’d been worried that his father would get mad at him for ruining his clothes.
“You sure you didn’t miss me?” said Harry again when they drew apart, smirking, and Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco let go of his hand and headed upstairs with a quiet “Good night, Harry.” Harry watched him ascend the staircase, feeling frustrated that Draco seemed determined to punish himself for things he couldn’t control and weren’t his fault. He blew out a breath and went to sit across from Hermione.
He turned his attention back to Draco, and a strange, warm feeling coursed through him when he realized Draco had fallen asleep. His breathing was deep and slow, and every now and then he let a small, snuffling sigh. It was adorable.
When the sun sinks beyond the horizon Draco reluctantly left the clearing and hiked back up the path to the school for dinner, preparing himself to interact with other people again.
“What was the school like? The teachers? The courses? How were your programs?” Hermione asked eagerly. Harry decided to imitate Ron and let Draco do the talking, at least for now. So Draco told them about the school, and everything else while Harry sat back and listened.
He’d been slipping up more and more this past week, what with the French that Harry kept overhearing, being caught staring at Harry, and the whole Pepper-Up mess. It was getting harder to keep his feelings from showing, especially since Draco was almost one hundred percent sure that Daphne, at least, had noticed.
Harry looked...beautiful. They’d done something to make his green eyes pop, and the overall effect was mesmerizing. The lack of glasses helped, too.
He’d never liked another boy before, but now that he thought about it...Harry liked Draco. He liked his sarcastic, witty remarks, his fancy way of talking. His random french phrases, how they sounded like song. How dramatic he was, how fun he was to talk to. How smart he was, how passionate he was about school subjects he loved, that he was as good a Seeker as Harry was. That he had never been someone to care that Harry was famous, but who saw him only as Harry. He challenged him and kept him on his toes. He was beautiful.
But everything from those lessons was out the window now. Rule after rule that Draco had always lived by, well, it’s safe to say he’d sped through them. And now he didn’t know at all where to begin.
“Got yourself a girlfriend, Malfoy? Surprised you found a girl to take a Death Eater.” Finnegan stood up from a knot of Gryffindor and Hufflepuff boys on the sofa, though Draco didn’t see Potter or Weasley. Thomas grabbed Finnegan’s sleeve.
“No, because we have students from other places like Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium, and more, so we offer a French language class but we all speak English in classes, since that’s what most people know.” replied Simon with a smile.
“Are you ready for the trip?” Harry turned at Draco’s voice and found him laying on his side, propping up his head with an arm.
Because this feeling, this anger, possessiveness… this was what he had felt when he’d seen Dean kissing Ginny, two years ago. Except this time...this time it was stronger.
“Probably not. The Yule Ball went on for ages.” said Harry with a grimace, and Draco laughed. Harry was still struck with a little sensation of awe every time Draco laughed, because it was so surreal that Harry had caused him to do that. Make him happy.
Harry sighed. “Sure, ‘Mione.” he said, and resigned himself to a study session with Hermione, which he and Ron had actively avoided for the better part of three years. Hermione had a tendency to be very nit-picky when studying, and would insist on them quizzing her but keep snatching the book back, among other things.
Harry saw Zabini mutter something to Pansy and Daphne, who were standing close together; they smirked. Harry glanced at Malfoy. He still sat apart from everyone, and his face was expressionless.
“Now, I’m only telling you this because I think it’s time you two stop dancing around one other and figure out what you are to each other.” Daphne said firmly, and as she went on Harry could see a hint of Slytherin steel in her eyes. “But if you mess with him, if you hurt him, you can trust one hundred percent that I will hurt you, because Draco deserves to be loved unconditionally.”
“Merlin,” muttered Draco once the door was closed behind them. “I thought they’d never stop asking all those damn questions.” Harry snorted.
“Yeah, then I can beat Potter’s ass.” Draco announced, fixing the Gryffindor with a challenging stare, which he returned in full.
Draco pushed himself more upright with the hand on Harry’s chest so he could see Harry’s face. He looked quite shocked.
Harry found himself imitating Malfoy, tapping his fingers on the table. He stops hastily when the other boy’s eyes flick to his hand.
“Come look in the mirror, Draco,” exclaimed Camille, taking his hand and drawing him up off of the bed. He let her, feeling the knot in his stomach tighten. Harry was in there. Could Draco even trust himself next to him, not to fuck anything up? He swallowed, but let himself be led into the cramped bathroom, looked up into the mirror.
They’d spent yesterday mostly in their room, snogging and talking in equal amounts. It was still very new, this thing between them, and Draco was being as careful as he could to not fuck up. But not doing that had been easier than he’d expected. It was almost exactly how they used to behave around each other, which Draco supposed made sense since they’d both liked one another for a little while. But they still bickered and hung out. Just now there was a lot of snogging involved, which had made it difficult to concentrate on mundane things like homework.
“I don’t think so.” replied Hermione. “And speaking of my study sessions, I think you two should join us tomorrow. You still have to do that diagram for Herbology and the Astronomy chart.”
“I don’t, I just- don’t want you to have to deal with shit because of me.” muttered Draco, looking away, at the portraits adorning the walls, fixing his gaze on a portrait of three warlocks in large ruffled collars, sitting at a desk and writing with elaborate quills.
“Draco, tell us the interesting stuff,” Pansy insisted, buffing her nails. Draco rolled his eyes and prepared to drop his bomb on them. “The other interesting stuff,” Pansy amended, obviously having forgotten and then remembered about Theo.
He set his jaw. Draco never should’ve told any of them. Father was right, nothing good ever came of divulging things like this, it just made you vulnerable and it’ll come back and hurt you later. He made the mistake of confiding in Pansy, and now she had blabbed and Daphne had tried to use the information to convince him to ‘be a better person’. Merlin, he wished he’d just stormed out of the library. Talking to Granger and Potter was not something he needed badly enough that he would willingly put up with this shit.
He recognized many of the faces out on the platform. For the most part they’re happy, smiling. A different breed than himself. As the smoke from the train drifted along the platform, he saw someone. Draco bolted upright. Was that-
On Saturday morning, Draco slept fitfully, unable to get comfortable. Eventually he got up quietly, his light footsteps masked by the soft snoring coming from the other beds. He threw on a sweater and walked out of the school to the Owlery. It’s chilly, and the sky is still dark, in the time just before dawn. Draco could hear crickets chirping softly among the damp grass. The path up to the Owlery was rocky and steep, but Draco’s been up here so many times it didn’t bother him anymore.
“Potter, I am not going ice skating with you, you pretentious prat!” exclaimed Draco, casting an apprehensive look at the pair of white skates dangling from Harry’s fingers.
“Shall we?” said Harry, and Draco huffed out a breath, watching it steam in the cold air. His hand was warm and familiar in Harry’s.
“You aren’t dicing it properly, Potter.” protested Malfoy, sounding more like his old self. “You’re making it too big.”
“Don’t sound so disappointed, Harry. It’ll be wonderful. Amelie and Camille know what they’re doing, make-up wise.” Harry shook his head in disbelief.
“Invisibility Cloak, remember? It’s very useful.” Harry sat up and faced Draco, who grinned at his comment. Harry smiled back, and they looked at each other for a moment, before Draco swept his gaze away from Harry’s, off to the side. Harry cleared his throat, dismissing the slightly lost feeling, and rummaged in his trunk for his Cloak. He drew the silvery fabric out, and Draco watched.
“We have a magical hat called the Sorting Hat, and every year each first year puts on the hat, and it kind of magically digs around in your brain- not literally- but it senses your dominant traits and puts you in the House that matches. I’m in Gryffindor, it’s known for bravery, courage, chivalry, things like that.”
“Because I hate to see you hating yourself.” said Harry softly, feeling Draco’s heartbeat increase. Though from anger, or annoyance, or something else, Harry couldn’t tell. Their bodies might have been magically linked, but their minds and emotions were not.
All in all it had been a good Christmas morning, thought Harry. He’d been apprehensive about spending his holidays away from Hogwarts or the Weasley’s, since he always spent Christmas at one or the other, but he was pleasantly surprised and glad that he was enjoying today quite as much as he had enjoyed Christmas’s of the past.
Draco moved smoothly through the air, his eyes scanning over the dusky Quidditch Pitch as he looped wide, lazy circles around the pitch. Harry was doing the same thing opposite him, the both of them retracing the same paths over and over. It was nice to be up in the air again, feeling the wind on his face, and being away from all the people.
“So- are you together?” burst out Daphne, and Camille and Amelie’s mouths dropped, their eyes lighting with excitement. Harry smirked, before turning to Draco and tipping his
“Y-your hands are cold,” stuttered Draco breathlessly. Harry’s body pressed him down into the ground, and Harry grinned at him lazily.
Draco liked when they bantered like this, honestly. It helped him take his mind off of how he liked Harry, and how that was currently going no damn where. It was a good distraction, a semblance of normalcy.
“We’ll be back just in time for lunch,” commented Amelie. “Thankfully. I need to talk to Draco about something.” Harry blinked, all the thoughts of the Slytherin swarming back into his head, and he cursed silently. They would be back at Beauxbatons soon, he needed to be normal.
“Morning.” replied Draco, a returning smile tugging at the edges of his mouth. Harry yawned, throwing off his blankets and setting his feet on the floor.
“No, mine is from my dad. It’s a long story, but it’s been around forever and it’s always worked.” explained Harry, thinking of the Deathly Hallows. His cloak was the only one left, really, and the only one that he wanted.
“Now that wasn’t that horrible,” he said quietly to Harry. “I think you’ll still have less attention here than at Hogwarts.” Harry smiled slightly.
“Yeah. Want to hold him?” offered Harry, knowing full well Draco didn’t. But under his mother’s eyes, Draco nodded unenthusiastically. Harry chuckled and passed him over, enjoying Draco’s wide eyes and slight panic as he held Teddy. Soon Harry took pity on him and took the baby from him, passing him over to Andromeda. They all sat down, Andromeda with Teddy, Draco with Narcissa, and Harry in an armchair.
Harry said good night and trudged up the stairs to his dorm. It’s blessedly empty, and Harry snorted when he saw that Malfoy’s bed is green.
“Promise me you’ll be careful,” she whispered, under the cover of the two boys arguing loudly behind her. “With other students. I don’t want to see you or Draco get hurt by
“Brilliant,” Harry said, and left the dorm room. Draco sighed into the empty space, shaking his head before changing out of his pajamas and into robes and brushing his teeth.
They stayed like that for a long while, sitting in a comfortable silence as Harry looked out the window, Draco’s comforting presence in front of him. The gardens were quiet, starlit, and it looked as though the meteor shower had finally stopped. The moon was a glowing crescent in the sky, it’s soft white light washing over the grounds. Harry smiled at the memory of the shooting stars. It had been beautiful.
“How did I forget about that?” exclaimed Harry. “We have more fucking tests. Always the tests. The OWL testing was bad enough.”
“Oh! I do remember one time. It was during summer vacation three years ago, and my parents and Astoria and I were in Switzerland. There was this handsome bloke working at a shop there a year older than me-”
“Your quills are always so fancy,” he said, meeting Draco’s eyes with that wonderful smile, and before he could comprehend what he was doing Draco leaned forward and kissed him. Threaded his fingers through that beautiful, messy dark hair and pulled him closer. Reveled in the taste of vanilla that swept through his mouth. He hadn’t realized how much he’d missed kissing Harry. Snogging him properly, being able to take their time. It was like a spark, and Harry was the wind that coaxed him into a wildfire.
Draco didn’t know exactly why this feeling was coming on so strongly at the moment. He supposed it was being back at Hogwarts, remembering everything and seeing the hatred toward him that he’d forgotten in his time at Beauxbatons. It really had been like a dream there. The sort of life he could’ve had if he’d been a better person.
“Oh,” said Ron, looking rather as though he’d been struck over the head with a broomstick. Hermione was still beaming at the pair of them next to Ron.
And when he’d left the library, he’d been so furious with himself for divulging so much. Daphne had run up to him and Draco had snapped at her, although he hadn’t hexed her like he’d promised. When she’d asked what was wrong, he’d burst out that he’d acted like a dewy-eyed girl and talked about feelings and she’d laughed at him. Then his anger had blown it’s top and he’d stormed off, calling her a fucking liar over his shoulder.
“Wonderful! So this weekend.” Amelie said. “Now, Draco, what’s this Daphne told me today, about a certain kiss in sixth year?” Harry looked at him curiously, as did the others.
He stayed there for the rest of the morning. When the heat became too much, he retreated into the border of the Forbidden Forest and entered a clearing not too deep inside. It’s
“We’ll definitely write you,” added Simon, exchanging a sad, fond look with Daphne. Harry felt a pang of sympathy for them; assuming they were staying together, it would be difficult to have a relationship over that distance.
“Blimey,” whispered Ron, “I’ve never seen anyone debate with Hermione like this.” Harry nodded agreement, and Blaise overheard them.
“It sounds really interesting! It would be wonderful to visit another wizarding school.” Hermione’s eyes shine. Harry nodded agreement.
The next morning, Harry packed his things, except for his school items. He could hear his heart beating quickly from anticipation of the trip, and he smiled to himself as he closed the lid of his trunk and latched it shut.
“Different.” finished Draco, finally reaching her side. She nodded and pulled out a strip of meat to feed the thestral, which ate it greedily and nosed Luna’s hand for more. “I came to apologize. I’m so sorry that you were locked up, and had to go through all of that. And I’m terribly sorry I couldn’t help you more during that time.” Draco said seriously, and Luna smiled at him again.
“I see the way you look at him,” she said knowingly, and Harry was strongly reminded of Hermione, confronting him about Ginny. The words were the same. “And,” Daphne went on slowly, “the way he looks at you.”
Harry glanced at Draco in curiosity. Nott was his ex, so Harry wondered what Draco thought of him being here. Apparently not much, because Draco was draining his glass of Firewhisky with a blank expression on his face.
After Draco’s trial over the summer, he had never thanked Potter for speaking for him and his mother. He supposed he should, since it was likely because he spoke that his mother only got off with a year of house arrest and Draco had gotten a summer of probation, not counting his time at Hogwarts.
“Also, it reminds me of Colin Creevey. He died at the battle, but he was always asking me for an autograph or a photo.” he continued, more somberly. Draco looks a little surprised, but nodded. “I think the potion’s ready-” Draco leaned over the cauldron, his shoulder brushing Harry’s.
“I liked yours too.” replied Draco softly, after a pause. They watched each other for a second, and Draco was the first to look away. “Goodnight, Harry.”
“Oh, here comes McGonagall with the schedules.” said Daphne as the Headmistress strode up to the eighth year table.
Draco smirked. “Alright.” he said, opening the door and stepping inside. “Potter, you left the window open all day?” he continued indignantly.
He shoved his way through the throngs of Muggles, letting his anger at all of this be his shield, and stepped through the barrier with no hesitation.
“If you shut up,” Draco murmured, returning to his notes, and Harry sat back in his seat, relieved. Now he just had to look like he was taking notes. Much easier.
At first Malfoy was a little withdrawn and snappish; Harry figured it’s the fact that so many people are around them and subtly (or not) watching them, all curious as to why the Golden Trio is eating dinner with the Prince of Slytherin, ex Death Eater. But Hermione and Harry, by silent agreement, engage him in a constant stream of chatter, and soon Malfoy opened back up again.
So at the end of dinner, when Draco usually showered, Harry took all of his hair products and hid them under his bed, under a handy loose floorboard he’d discovered. It reminded him a lot of his fourth year, when he’d hidden snacks and cakes under a loose floorboard in his bedroom when Dudley, and the whole family, had gone on the diet of what Uncle Vernon had called “rabbit food”. Harry smirked as he remembered all of the tantrums that had shaken the house.
“I’m in the Alchemy program, it’s my second year.” replied Camille. “Draco, are you drinking your coffee black?” Draco nodded as he sipped it. “Why? It’s gross like that.”
As the other eight Hogwarts students queued up in front of the fireplace (which Harry was not looking at, just to stay calm) Draco leaned closer to Harry.
“Hey- Harry!” Hermione appeared out of the haze on the platform and wrapped Harry in a tight hug, which he returned.
Harry kissed him again, trying to express how he felt at that. It was just- it made Harry feel like he was flying, soaring. The memory of him had gotten Draco his Patronus. Draco was happy with him. And being around him made Harry feel like the most special person in the world.
Harry snickered. “Yes, well, we knocked them out with a Sleeping Draught in two sweets and then put them in said closet.” Draco snorted, shaking his head.
Harry wasn’t worried for Malfoy, he knew the other boy was capable of looking after himself. Harry was just a little confused, and curious as to where he disappeared to and why.
“You passed out.” Draco flushed from embarrassment, but Harry kept talking. “I think you were too tired to provide all the energy the spell needed. But you were really close, your Patronus almost formed, I saw it coming together.” he finished.
He knew how Draco felt about this subject, that part of him still loathed himself for the past. And Harry understood, he saw Draco’s reasons for this. But he also saw the boy he’d gone ice skating with, who tried on his glasses and helped him with panic attacks. Just a boy, like everyone else. Draco saw himself as fully responsible for every bad thing from
But Hermione and Ron had been going, and over the course of the summer they’d convinced him to come back. And Harry had liked the idea of being in the familiar places- the common room, the dorms, having his last memories at Hogwarts being mundane, normal things, not the war. Also not being alone so much. Now he shares a dorm with the eighth year Hufflepuff and Gryffindor boys. Ron, Neville, Seamus, Dean. Ernie, Micheal, Justin. The rest hadn’t come back for an eighth year. Or couldn’t. For many reasons. One of them being mortality.
But what he didn’t expect was for Harry to grab his arm and take Draco down with him. Draco fell on top of Harry, their legs tangling together, faces centimeters away. Draco’s hands were braced on Harry’s chest, and they blinked at each other.
“Well, you still should have told me earlier. Don’t lie, we both know you know how to make a letter tamper-proof.” she chided. Draco sighed.
Daphne snorted, tying her long hair back with a green ribbon. “Last night was glorious. When Potter and I got back to the common room, the Headmistress was ripping Finnegan a new one. He got detention three times a week for the rest of the year, and no Hogsmeade trips.”
So all that was left was Harry’s present, and Draco still didn’t know what to do for that. He’d considered everything Quidditch-related, but Harry was as much of a Quidditch fanatic as Draco was and therefore had everything he needed already. He probably wouldn’t want anything academic, plus Hermione would definitely be getting everyone something in that category. No, he wanted his present to be meaningful, but Draco had no bloody clue how to do that. He’d even considered getting Harry a freaking pet, but that wasn’t right either.
“Your trunks are here,” announced Camille, pointing to a stack of trunks and a few owl cages neatly arranged at the side of the hallway. “And dorms are these five doors. Two to a room, I assume you all already know that, though. In the morning we’ll come get you and tell you more from there. Good night.” Camille waved, then she and Simon began walking back the other way. The ten students started talking excitedly as they grabbed trunks and opened doors, and Harry chose a room at random before entering.
“He didn’t have a clue for Hermione either. He just told me about the stargazing thing you two did and suggested I do an ‘experience’ instead of buying her something.” Weasley
“Yeah,” he said unenthusiastically, writing it down. Harry was tracing lines on Draco’s back as he wrote the letter, but he paused.
Harry couldn’t stop thinking about him, couldn’t stop going over every memory. It was intoxicating and intense and crazy, and Harry didn’t mind at all.
“Then help me to,” replied Harry, pouring all of his jumbled emotions into his voice. “Tell me what’s wrong.” He wanted to understand, wanted to know why Draco was retreating. Why he said this couldn’t work.
Days were irrelevant now, and everything he remembered that was washed in sunlight melded together into a blur. It was the nights that he held close, the nights spent with Draco- for he
Harry doesn’t know what to say, but Daphne’s words resonate. They’re true. “You’re right,” he said to her. “But I think we need to get him to the hospital wing.”
Half an hour later Draco was back in the carriage with everyone except Harry, who’s absence was one Draco felt greatly. It had started to rain, and Draco thought listlessly that the weather was reflecting his mood.
“...Hope you had a good Thanksgiving, Draco and Harry.” Draco set down the letter that he’d been penning to Hermione and Ron, on Harry’s insistence that Draco’s handwriting was better than his. Harry nodded slowly.
“Draco, I need my glasses. Give them back,” Harry said, reaching for Draco, but the blond twisted out of his loose grip with a grin.
“Yes, brilliant job. You got some stuff from the cupboard. Do you want a medal, or will you go get the rest of them since we both know I’m the one that will be brewing this potion?” he retorted, having given up on being civil. Potter rolled his eyes but grabbed his book and went back to get everything else.
“Oh, you know what else I’m looking forward to now?” said Draco with an evil grin. Harry raised his eyebrows.
to stop kissing Draco and turn to his two friends again. Draco had a satisfied smile on his face next to him, chuckling.
“They were really good. Second, behind the Harpies. I love the Falcons but Jones is a brilliant player,” enthused Draco. Finally he’s found something like common ground with Weasley.
“Stop thinking about it,” said Draco sharply, and Harry looked back at him. “I’m fine. They aren’t that bad. You already apologized.” Harry sighed.
He looked at Potter out of the corner of his eye. He didn’t look any different. Draco didn’t know why he’d expected him too after last night. Same messy black hair, ugly glasses, green eyes.
“Close your other eye, I have to start that one. And yes. Answer the question.” she ordered in a soft voice. Draco closed his eyes again and felt her start on the other eye.
Harry had known he was bi for a while now. He’d figured it out after he and Ginny had gone their separate ways, and he’d realized that he found boys as attractive as girls.
“The Conjunctio Cordis spell- or the heart linking spell- creates a magical link between the hearts and health of two people. It has been used to save someone dying from a wound or curse by linking the wounded’s heart and health with that of a healthy person. This will cause the wounded person to heal much faster and remove any curses from their person. However, it is extremely difficult to cast and can result in the death of both the healthy and wounded person if done incorrectly. If done correctly, the wounded person should begin to heal, wake, or be free from any curses. Note, however, that after the first initial use, where the healthy person helps to heal the wounded person while remaining healthy, whatever wound, pain, curse, or disease that impacts one person will also equally impact the other, and if one of them dies, so will the other. This spell is irremovable.”
“If you make any loud noise when I tell you I will throw you off the Astronomy Tower.” Draco warned, and she nodded impatiently, waiting eagerly. Blaise also had a look of thinly veiled curiosity on his face and he leaned forward to catch Draco’s next words.
His head was still spinning, he needed water, something to clear his head. Draco smirked wryly. Why had he ever been looking forward to this? It was one shitshow after another.
His broom jerked again, more violently, and with a brittle sound like ice cracking it snapped. He hung in the air for a split-second that felt like an eternity, his breath caught in his chest. And then suddenly he was falling.
“We should probably head back up now, before Filch locks the doors.” Harry said, somewhat regretfully. It was nice out here, lying under the stars.
Harry’s notes, writing on his bedside table and leaning precariously off of the bed. Draco shook his sleeve back when it almost dipped in his ink, and Harry watched him with amusement before sucking in a quiet breath.
“Yeah, I think I will.” whispered Harry. “You?” Amelie smiled at him, brushing her dark hair out of her eyes.
Daphne left and he resumed his silent vigil, his silent prayers, his eyes on Harry. He looked almost as if he was sleeping peacefully. If only.
“Finnegan accuses us of being Death Eaters and killers, but he’s the one who fucking attacked someone when their back was turned.” she hissed, turning her head and glaring at Seamus.
“We’ll be back,” he said with a quick smile, before he and Draco turned round and walked out of the ballroom. Draco visibly deflated once they were in a quiet hallway.
“Daphne?” Granger stood behind them. “Why is he here?” Draco saw Potter and Weasley sitting next to Sue Li and Padma Patil behind the bushy-haired girl. This keeps getting bloody worse, thought Draco in disgust.
Draco walked down to the dining hall, mulling over the other things he’d decided to get Harry, after much deliberation. A sweater like the ones Draco loved, because Harry was always stealing his, and a box of those fancy chocolates, because why not. All in all Draco was quite pleased with himself for finally settling on what he thought were good Christmas presents.
“So why’d you try to cover it up?” asked Harry, and Draco thought he could see anxiety building in Harry’s eyes, and exhaled.
“Hi.” said Harry, grinning. “Missed me?” Draco huffed but kissed him again. Harry pulled him closer, his head getting wonderfully light and dizzy, his focus solely on the boy in front of him. Draco pulled away after what seemed like an eternity. A perfect way to spend an eternity, thought Harry dizzily, his head spinning from exhilaration.
There’s another silence, and Draco peeked at Potter out of the corner of his eye. The other boy is watching him curiously, and Draco flushed and stared at his desk.
“So do you have any idea of where you want to go after school?” asked McGonagall. She slid a plate of biscuits across the table. “Have a biscuit, Potter.” Harry smiled and took a
“Alright, Malfoy.” Harry flicked up his eyebrows. “If you want a chance, you have one. But remember that Gryffindors always beat Slytherins.” Draco scoffed, and everyone else laughed.
Harry woke up with the taste of mint on his tongue. It was still nighttime, and Draco was still asleep, judging from the quiet, even breathing coming from his side of the room. Harry tentatively touched his lips with his finger, the dream still vivid in his mind.
“Hey.” said Harry, and sneezed again. “I think I have a cold from last night. Sorry.” He was a slightly pitiful sight to behold, miserably huddled in his blanket, his nose reddish.
Next to him, Ron patted his stomach fondly. “That was as good as I remember.” Hermione cast him an amused look.
“You are not a horrible person.” said Harry fiercely. “And you deserve to be happy just as much as I do!” He leaned forward, cupping Draco’s face gently within his hands. “I want to be with you.”
Andromeda had welcomed him, not just because he was Harry Potter, but because he was godfather to Teddy and therefore she considered him family. The very first time he had seen her, when he had crash-landed in her garden with Hagrid, he had thought her to be Bellatrix and only a few seconds later he had seen that it was not her. Now he knew that Andromeda Tonks and her sister were very much different, and she had become something like an aunt to him in the three months he had stayed with her and the baby Teddy.
“Er, yeah, but he did fall like two hundred feet from his broom. Someone cursed it and it broke while we were playing Quidditch,” explained Harry, somewhat nervously. He hadn’t forgotten Pansy’s promise to have ‘words’ with him if Draco got hurt. “And I’d like your help trying to find out who it is. If you think it’s possible. Also Draco has this absurd idea that he has to atone for every single bad thing that’s a product of the war and he doesn’t even blame the person who tried to kill him and he won’t talk about it.”
“...two feet of parchment on the history of the Bubble-Head Charm, and on the charm itself. Practice before next class. Dismissed!”
“So tell me, Harry,” declared Camille, swinging her legs back and forth. “Is Draco as clingy as we figured?” Draco’s mouth dropped in outrage and he heard Harry chuckled above him.
“Well,” said Draco, biting into his roll. “I got Blaise another glass sculpture, you know he has that collection.” Daphne nodded, her eyes wide and expectant, and Draco exchanged an amused glance with Harry. “And I got Camille that sweater she was going on about, Simon some broom wax and one of those poem books he likes, I got Pansy a fancy bracelet. A scarf and a box of chocolates for my mother, a pair of Keeper’s gloves for Weasley, a book on Arithmancy and a distiller for Hermione.” Draco went on, finishing his bread. He left out Daphne’s and Harry’s, obviously.
The train blew its whistle, making him jump, and Draco collected his things and began the walk to the carriages. Maybe if he’s lucky, he’ll get one all to himself since everyone else was already on the way to the school.
“Also French boys.” agreed Draco as they reached the common room. “Mother was delighted that I’ll get to practice my French, she made me take lessons as a child but I stopped a long time ago. Bit rusty.”
“Hey Harry, Malfoy.” said Dean, and Harry was a little surprised at his cordial tone when greeting Draco until he remembered Dean had never really had a problem with anyone; it was Seamus that always had some drama going on. Neville waved at Harry and nodded at Draco, who nodded back.
“Putrid,” said Daphne Greengrass next to him, wrinkling her nose. “I mean, I guess they didn’t want to use House colors. But this is just horrid.”
“I should have known.” he remarked. Daphne sat on one of the purple sofas, but bounded up and goes over to him.
He’d finished what he called a Healing Pendant, a small golden chain with a tiny stag pendant that he’d imbued with a Calming Spell, commonly used for patients with panic attacks or trauma. The spell simply helped them breath slower, and kept them, well, calm. He’d put it in a small white box, and wrapped that as well as the jumper and chocolates he’d bought. They might not measure up to what Harry had done for a Christmas present, but Draco thought he’d done a decent job.
"Changed your mind, have you?" Draco replied wryly. Potter looked confused until Draco adopted a lofty tone and said, "I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks."
“So how did you two become friends?” asked Narcissa politely, her curious grey eyes so like Draco’s. Harry looked pointedly at Draco, who coughed and started to talk. They’d agreed it was probably better for him to explain it to his mother.
As Harry ate he pondered. Pondered Draco, mostly. He was acting as though nothing had ever happened, as though someone hadn’t tried to kill him just a few days ago. Harry hadn’t tried to bring up Draco’s I-deserve-to-be-punished-for-the-past thing, figuring it was better to figure out what he wanted to say than to just charge in and blurt out whatever came to mind. It was definitely a sensitive topic. Honestly he didn’t even know what to call it. Every time he thought about it he called it something different.
“Alright, fine,” Draco relented, peering over the end of his bed to see his own pile of presents and grabbing the top few.
“Because I knew you would act like this,” said Draco placatingly, approaching Harry, who huffed derisively.
“Let’s go dance,” she said, pulling Theo and Camille up. A distraction, for everyone else. Simon and Amelie followed her readily, but Harry stayed behind with Draco, who didn’t seem to notice he was there.
Draco gazed out of the window. Catching sight of his reflection, he sighed. In many ways he still looked the same brash, bold boy- blond hair, though he had foregone the gel- pale and aloof. But he knew he’s changed from those days. The most obvious change lay on his arm. His Dark Mark. Or what remained of it.
“Malfoy, you are not going to make it up that hill on one foot, even with my help.” Harry said firmly. He could see that the other boy was already tired, and wouldn’t make it up the hill or the various staircases to the hospital wing.
“Potter, you did not just eat my dessert.” Harry gave him another rakish grin, one that made his toes curl, but then Harry snatched Draco’s cup and kept eating it. “You thieving commoner bastard!” exclaimed Draco, punctuating each word with a smack on Harry’s arm with Amelie’s book. Amelie sighed from next to Harry and shook her head at them.
“Follow me.” said Draco, and in a moment of inspiration, led Harry to his forest clearing. He wasn’t hoping for anything, he knew better than that. It had just been a long day of truth after truth, and this was the place where Draco was most comfortable when outside the castle. A look of apprehension dawned on Harry’s face as they entered the trees, but he didn’t say anything.
“No, the knocked over chess piece look. It’s very creative,” said Harry airily, then yelped when Amelie’s snowball hit his glasses. “Hey!”
Harry was lying on top of Draco, the breath knocked from his body. He could feel Draco’s steady heartbeat under his chest, and hear his soft, shallow breaths. Harry pushed himself upright, his arms on either side of Draco, and they locked eyes. There was still something joyous and free in Draco’s grey eyes, and his blond hair was windswept and irresistibly messy. His lips were parted, and they were looking at each other, and before Harry knew what was happening he had leaned forward and kissed him.
When Harry arrived to Potions, he saw Daphne and Draco talking at his desk and went over to join them.
“Falmouth Falcons. But the Cannons are-” Draco tried unsuccessfully to think of a word that isn’t so insulting- “bottom of the league!” he finished. “Rook to F5,” he added.
Draco turned around and faced Finnegan. Trading insults was something he knew how to do. Even if he knew it wasn’t the smartest thing. “Don’t be jealous, Finnegan. It’s not a good look on you. Nothing is, if I’m being honest.” He saw the anger on the other boy’s face, and felt his own anger rising to match it.
Draco and Daphne walk the familiar path through the corridors to the Potions classroom after eating lunch with Blaise and Pansy.
“Thank you for saving me. In the Room of Hidden Things, last year.” Harry turned and looked at him, and he could feel a tiny smile curve his lips.
“Well, in first year Hagrid had this dragon egg he won in a pub, it hatched and me, Ron, and Hermione were with him, and we look over and Draco’s just peering in the window, then he runs away, right. Well long story short, we tried to help Hagrid get rid of the dragon by sending it to Ron’s brother who works with dragons in Romania, but we got caught coming down from the Astronomy Tower because Draco’d tattled on us. Then we lost about a hundred and fifty points and all of us got handed detention in the Forbidden Forest, where I had to pair up with Draco after he scared Neville and then we saw Voldemort hunched over a dead unicorn.”
Draco eyed the two of them. “Is this because I got my head bashed in last night?” He tried to sound aloof, but didn’t pull it off like normal, because he’s not really mad at them for staying away. How could he be mad, when he would have done the same thing if their positions were reversed?
“At your...home,” broached Hermione, her tone a bit softer now. “Why did you try to protect Harry? You knew it was him.” Malfoy let out a brittle sigh and when he lifted his head again, his eyes are haunted. Harry fought the urge to look away and relive the memories flooding his own head at the mention of that day when Hermione was tortured, and Dobby died.
“I’d rather be civilized than fun, Harry.” Draco said primly, sitting up and facing the Gryffindor, then frowning suddenly. “You did this on purpose, didn’t you? Talking to me when I was trying to go back to sleep?” Harry smiled devilishly, and Draco rolled his eyes.
“But you did help,” Harry whispered gently. “You helped Luna, you gave her food and things. And you helped me when I got captured.” Draco shook his head.
