Whose was it? Was it put there on purpose? Was Tom Riddle planning his revenge on him? Not likely. But then he remembers Hermione telling him about a diary she had and that she would give it to him so he and Draco can write to each other using it. If it wasn't put in the room by himself, then it must have been Ron.
Draco traced a finger over the Latin words. He knew a few of the words and what they meant. "I know 'mentiri' means to lie, as in here lies Helga Hufflepuff, for example. 'Conditor' and 'exitus' means founders and bedroom. I think it's saying, 'Here lie the founder's bedrooms'?"
Cedric shook his head, a sad smile appeared on his face. "No, sorry to burst your love bubble," he said a little regrettably, knowing Harry really likes Draco. "Although, he really seemed worried about you."
"Don't say splat," said Draco as he looked down at the worm in front of Harry. Now he was worried about the worm's life and he cannot believe he would even think that of a worm. It has a worthless life anyway. What is its purpose? Is it to eat dirt all its life?
"Having fun with my dick there, Harry?" Draco asked, kissing Harry down his jawbones.
Draco, Ivy and Pansy were sitting around a table at the Yule Ball, waiting for the contestants to arrive. Draco was wearing silver and white dress robes with black shoes and a silver bow tie. Pansy was wearing a red long dress with short sleeves, long red hoop earrings and red thick high heeled pump heels. Ivy was wearing a black and red Victorian style dress that looked like something a vampire queen would wear with little black bats for earrings and her silver chain necklace was just showing from on her neck. Nobody but Draco knew what the pendant, that was underneath the dress on her chest, was used for.
Draco watched as the maze sealed himself in so he decided to begin walking. He doesn't know when he would be able to see Harry again, but he knows he will. Whatever happens, they will see each other in the end. When walking further into the maze, it began twisting and turning. Turning left, right, left, left again and right. It just kept on twisting and turning until he got to this park looking room.
Draco gives a slow nod and a smile at Harry, relieved that he didn't have to ask him a certain question in front of Pansy. "I'll see you later, Harry," he said nonchalantly and watched Harry giving him a nod back and turning around to walk over to Granger.
He opened the next present to reveal another Weasley sweater with some fudge. It was a lovely present, and he hasn't had fudge in so long. He then picked up another present from Ron which he looked up and gave Ron a small fake smile, which Ron returned but with a real smile, and opened the present. Dungbombs. "Thank you, Ron, and say thanks to your mother for me."
"Anyway," Ivy said with a sigh, wanting to forget that right now. She glanced at her cousin with a smirk on her lips. "Draco, Truth or Dare."
Harry didn't even flinch from the door which slammed pretty loudly in front of him. He begins the slow journey back to his room, feeling his tears form in his eyes as he unscrews the lid from the bottle just to be ready. Goodbye world. The world only judged him anyway so why bother living? He angles the bottle to the side so two pills fall out onto his hand and he shoves it in his mouth without water for him to help the process of swallowing. Goodbye Ron and Hermione. He tips the bottle upside down until ten pills fall out onto his hands and he sighed. He could already feel the effects of the first two pills making him sleepy but that's not what he wants. He just wants this to end. Someone else can save the Wizarding World.
Harry turned around as he was at the doors. He mouthed that he wants to be alone to her, but it seemed she didn't get what he meant. He sighed and went straight to the bathroom to vomit up his food. He always hated this; it was why he never ate. He was fine a few days ago when eating vegetables. Maybe it's the veggies and fruits he should be eating. As soon as he finished emptying his stomach, he repeated the same process of gurgling water, spitting it out and taking a sip of water to wash it all down. He cleansed his mouth with a spell, walked over to the cupboard and opened it. He grabbed his tin, tipped it upside down and let the blade fall out of the tin onto his hand. He rolled up his sleeve and let himself release the overwhelming feelings on his arm. He didn't realize how deep he was going; he even came to the conclusion that he didn't care what happened. He then cleaned himself up from his blood and headed out of the bathroom and out of the common room into a corridor. He just wanted to go and sit down for a while.
Hermione sighed and shook her head, not knowing how Harry has so much luck even in the most difficult of times. She half-smiled at her best friend, got out her wand, pointed it at his face and cast the skin-softening spell. "So, know what you're going to do in the task today?"
"Oh," said Draco and he understands what Harry wants. A dance. He is still craving a dance with his Harry since they last discussed a dance together. "I would love that, Harry. Lead the way, please. I'm wanting to dance with you until my legs are jelly and body is limp."
*****
"It will be fine," Ivy said before promptly sliding her fangs down Lavender's neck without further ado.
"Hey, are you okay?" a deep but soft voice asked.
Draco shook his head and left with a blush to his cheeks, he felt as if he was butting in on something too personal. Even if he was really curious, he wanted to give them some privacy when it comes to one of their own suffering terribly.
"Cedric!" Harry said quietly and a little shyly while glancing around him for anyone walking by. He didn't want anybody to hear their conversation. Merlin, save him if Draco was listening to them. Oh, that would be embarrassing if Draco heard everything that he was telling Cedric.
Uncle Dursley was hitting and belting him on his back while Aunt Petunia snickered as she watched Harry's past self get beaten. Harry was five, sitting in the middle of Dudley's train track, playing with Thomas the Tank Engine while the tv was playing the Beatles song 'Hey Jude' and Dudley skipped into the room and kicked everything around then shouted for his mother and father to help. He had blamed Harry for messing up his train set, and Uncle Vernon had come in with his belt and belted Harry over the back.
Harry winked at Draco, even though Draco was the one who winks the most, but he loved seeing the reaction he got. Draco's cheeks turned to a rosy colour, which Harry thought and knew was downright beautiful.
"Of course," Harry said automatically as he really does hate having to vomit out anything he eats, as well as the thought of food made him sick. He just wants to eat a normal meal like a normal person would. "Sorry for interrupting you, and I'd be happy to test it out."
Harry bites his lip as he then wondered if Draco and Ivy liked the presents that he got them. "It's okay, and he's coming," he said even though he didn't know when Ron would come over to them. Maybe he chickened out and went to talk to someone else. "Just promise me you'll not start fighting, especially since it's Christmas."
Harry wrapped a hand around the base of Draco's cock, feeling the size and weight of it and he leaned down and began licking clean the skin that had semen covering it from Draco's orgasm. Harry savoured the salty-sweetness of Draco's semen and lapped all of it up, not wanting to miss any of it as it's like his dessert for the night. When Draco's groin and around the base of his cock was clean, Harry leaned back up and gave Draco a wink.
Harry gave Draco's hand a little squeeze and moved them forwards into a waltz, not looking away from mesmerizing silver eyes as they waltzed around the garden. This was the part of the day he was most excited for. Dancing with Draco.
"Ah, son," said Narcissa. And Harry turned around at the mention of 'son'. It couldn't be... Nope, it was definitely Draco Malfoy in the same room as him and Teddy.
"I love you, Harry," Draco told him to what felt like the thousandth time today but that didn't matter at all. He wanted to tell Harry how much he loves him on their wedding day by marrying him and either staying a Malfoy or becoming a Potter.
Draco raised his pinkie finger just to irritate Harry a little bit, and smirked. "Do you-"
Draco nodded and placed a reassuring hand on Harry's shoulder. He and so many people felt sad that Harry doesn't have his parents to watch him grow up and have friends over. "I'm sure your father was an amazing man, Harry," he says with honesty. "Same goes with your mother. I bet she was sweet just like you."
Harry had no idea why he just did that, but he could tell Draco was scared as he could feel the Slytherin shaking. And why does he feel a soft sensation toughing his lips? He suddenly felt hands wrap around his waist, and he felt like he was at home. Not Hogwarts home. It was just a feeling, a really nice feeling. He just realized his lips were touching Draco’s, and they were kissing. He thought that kissing Draco, his lips would be slimy and unpleasant. Oh, how wrong he was. Draco’s lips were so warm, soft, and a little moist. They were perfect lips, and they synchronised with his own like they were meant to be kissed by each other.
Draco watched as Cedric left the tent. When the Hufflepuff was completely out of his sight he turned his head back to the raven-haired Gryffindor sitting on the hospital bed. His face softened and he furrowed his eyes worriedly, "So, how are you feeling? I saw what the Dragon did to you, is it bad?"
What would Ron think of me if I come out to him? Harry was thinking as he looked over at the sinks which were the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets. Will he still want to be my best mate? Besides, love is love, right? What I heard earlier couldn't be true... right? Someone so handsome and perfect like Draco can't like someone like me. Nobody should like me because I'm a freak. Nobody likes freaks. Freaks deserve nothing.
"Good luck, Harry Potter," Draco said with a small smile.
"Go on," Harry says, a little curious about these 'two somethings' Draco wants to ask. But then again, anything Draco says is interesting even if its about Potions. It's just his voice which is so calming and soft and something he really likes hearing every day.
***********************************************************
Harry let go of Draco's hand and wrapped his arms around Draco's neck, he kept staring into Draco's beautiful silver eyes that stared right back at him. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's waist, loving the moment he was having with Harry. Merlin, he couldn't help himself. He leaned forward and gave Harry a quick peck on the lips but then Harry parted his lips and kissed him. Draco melted in the embrace and really couldn't care less if people were watching. He tilted his head to the side and deepened the kiss, his hand came up and rested underneath Harry's chin while his other hand stayed around Harry's waist but gripped him more firmly.
"Harry! We were loo-" Hermione hesitated and stared at the boy's intertwined hands. How did she not see this coming?
Draco smiled, feeling the kiss still lingering on his cheek. "Yes, I do know you exceptionally well," he says with a nod and places an arm around Harry as they began to walk up to the castle. "Probably even more than your little Gryffindor friends."
"Whoa, Whoa, Whoa." Joslyn had to pause there to take in what Draco had said. "You guys fly on Dragons?" She asked in astonishment, but then looked at Draco sweetly. She nudged him again in the arm, "Does someone have the crushies on a certain Gryffindor?"
Harry felt something funny happening to his head and reached up to his hair to feel what's happening. He felt his own antlers on his head, and he looked over at Draco who was smiling and... blushing? "Hey! Uncalled for!"
"Oh, okay," was all Harry could say as he was still stunned from the kiss the Slytherin gave his cheek. He could still feel Draco's kiss lingering on his cheek. He recalled what Fred has said to him back at the dancing practice, 'I am never washing my cheeks again'. Harry laughed eternally on the inside and thought the same thing. "Goodbye, Draco". He gave a little wave to the Slytherin.
Harry gave him a fake smile and wandered back over to his bed. he started to open a small present. Inside the wrapping paper were mismatched socks, one red with little broomsticks and the other green with Snitches. He read the little card, "Merry Christmas, Harry Potter! From Dobby'. Merry Christmas to you too, Dobby! he thought. He placed them back on his bed and grabbed the next present.
Goyle mimicked Hermione in a girly voice, "Yes, Hagrid." Crabbe and Nott snickered at their friend, finding it funny even if the rest of the class didn't.
They were now directly in front of each other, with both of their faces only inches away. Harry looked across the crowd again, which was now watching with an aura of slight confusion as to where this confrontation was going.
Draco raised an eyebrow, almost like it's in question. "Pardon?"
Harry just listened to their conversation and didn't talk at all. Not unless he was asked a question which he responded with short-answered questions like 'Mhm', 'No', or 'Yes' and he gave them smiles just to make sure they don't start questioning about if he's okay. It's his most hated question. The 'Are you okay' question.
"I'll be there, Mr Potter," promised Severus with a little nod. Though he despises Harry, he must be a little nice to him as per Draco's request. "Where's your additional costume for the evening festivities?"
"Thank you, little Elfey," Ivy said with a satisfied smile at the small elf and she reached over and patted him on the head just like Harry did earlier. "You're a nice little one and I hope to god that you get paid enough for working here."
Pansy nodded her head and sighed a little sadly. The state Ivy is in really makes her understand that this world can really be cruel. "Yeah, I've hidden them in the most secretive of places. Nobody will ever find them, not even Dumbledore could."
"So good for me," Harry mumbled with a whole dick in his mouth. He kept pumping the base of Draco's dick and up halfway, wanting more than anything to swallow everything in Draco that would come out soon. It was exciting as he waited until Draco couldn't hold it in anymore.
Harry gave a fake smile at her while Ron turned to Hermione and said, "So Hermione, what's your opinion on homosexuality?" He gave a glance towards Harry, feeling as he knew what Hermione was about to say.
"Draco, can't you see what this means!" Pansy whispered with a wide grin and she just wanted to dance around the common room and sing what's in her head. Her best friends so much in love! Oh, and Harry Potter too! This excited her so much.
Draco took his eyes off Harry for just a minute which was extremely hard to do, to look at his friend below him on the floor of the Courtyard. "I just do," he said in a flat voice, just waiting for Harry to notice him already. "Let's just say... it's a part of our rivalry. Oh, and because it's his name which I and everyone else really should be using instead of last names."
"Don't you ever say you don't deserve someone, and don't you dare say you're a freak!" Draco nearly spat but kept his tone down. He didn't want to upset Harry by being loud. He couldn't believe what he was hearing. He turned off the music player and wrapped his arms around Harry before he could runoff. He kissed Harry on the forehead and tightened his grip on his boyfriend. "You are not a freak! Don't call yourself such a bad word. You are loved by so many people. By me, Weasel, Granger, and by so many people. Every teacher in this school cares about you, Harry. Don't you ever think nobody cares about you because it's not true. So many people care for you, Harry. Your own mother gave her life for you, you should feel grateful. I love you Harry James Potter and I will always do."
"At Harry's place," Pansy said, still distracted by her hair. "And Hermione, after graduation, let me come over for a night and she introduced me to the television. It's a strange thing. Rectangular...looking box."
They then headed out of the bedroom, out of the Transfiguration Courtyard and down to the Great Hall together. As soon as they got close enough to the Great Hall, they dropped their hands from each other's grasp and walked over to their required tables with a sigh. They both didn't want to but knew they should spend a little bit of time apart, just so people won't suspect anything, but they didn't care if word got out.
Draco stepped forward, gave his mother a hug too, and she kissed his forehead. "Be safe, mother.” He smiles when looking up at her, he leans away from the hug and intertwines hands with Harry. "I believe it's time to go." He looked at his mother seriously, “Try not to let that snake into my room please."
"And, I think you have very good friends too," Viktor said with a smile at Harry. He crossed his arms over his chest, but it wasn't to block out the cold.
Harry looked back over to where the two silhouettes were, but they were now gone. Had they apparated? he had not an idea. He just adored when Draco uses his first name. It felt so normal, even if it's not. "It's just... they're very cute together."
Hermione gave him a knowing smile and pointed over to a table where Ron and Blaise were seated. Blaise had his head tilted to his side like he was studying Ron, and his hand came up to brush some of Ron's ginger hair out of his eyes. "Blaise Zabini is flirting with him. I don't think Ron knows he's being flirted with though."
The door swung open and the short figure of Sprout filled the doorway. She looked sharply between Harry and Draco. "You have forty minutes left of class to re-pot the saplings, may I suggest you get started?" Professor Sprout then stalked away, leaving the door open.
"No problem, you can continue... Uh, snogging," Harry said and looked back at the letter, opened it, and read the letter from Sirius.
The Professor looked over to his distressed student and said, "No need to worry, Miss Granger. It doesn't hurt the rat, only confuses it. It is harmless." Hermione opened her mouth to protest but closed it as she had nothing to say. She still didn't like the way the professor uses charms on animals to make them do stuff unwillingly.
Of course, he would have thrown them at Potter with such force and anger. And inside the basket of flowers would be a note, saying how much he likes him, how he wants him to be his. Oh, he's bragging now. He should just stop. It's time to do some good old Potter insulting while he's here. Even if he hates insulting him. He's still not over that bloody rejected handshake thing. If only he could have been nicer when they first met in Malkin's Robe shop or even asked him some questions instead of sounding like the brat he always was. Well, the brat he chose to act as.
"As exciting as this conversation is getting, I really must get back to my godson," said Pansy, sighing as she really didn't want to leave. Her best friend was getting married!
"As I said before-," Hermione whispered to Harry but was cut off. She groaned silently to herself and hoped there would be time after class to chat with Harry.
"Yeah," Draco sighed in relief, liking his renovated home so much. Mother and father have done a good job with it all. "It was a bit depressing when it was all black, and it reminded us too much of... him."
"Are people really thinking that?" Harry asked her and didn't seem to mind it if people were thinking that he and Draco have been snogging somewhere. He didn't mind at all, and the students were right. He and Draco were somewhere and kissed a few times. "Actually, don't answer that. It's true anyways. He and I were... in the Slytherin dorms. I slept in his bed."
"I'm fine," Harry told them and forced a smile. Merlin, lying is getting easier now. Technically, this kind of lying was easy to get away with anyway. "Just going for a walk before the big night. How about you two?"
Harry told her everything that happened between him and Draco on their first date under the Willow tree and their most recent date which was a week ago. He didn't tell her about Ivy's suicide attempt because he didn't want to worry Hermione and apply more pressure on Ivy. He told her about a muggle garden, but not the one in Hogwarts because that will stay between Draco, him, and Ivy. He told Hermione what happened in the garden and obviously, he told her what actually happened with the kisses, the birds bringing the food, the pond and the gazebo.
"In an hour," said Harry simply.
"Wait," Draco said, as he quickly grabbed a stick from the side of the path and pointed it towards the muggles who were chasing them. "Petrificus Totalus!" He yelled, firing a spell at a muggle, and freezing them in the air.
“Of course, Mr Potter. The pleasure is all mine,” Lucius responded back with a smile, holding out his hand for the younger boy. He is quite proud of his son, for befriending the boy with a title that will help the Malfoy family if in any trouble. He could use this boy for many things but he won’t as he doesn’t want to lose any trust with Mr Potter or his son. “Not to be curious but why are you in KnockTurn Alley, Mr Potter?”
Harry sat with Ron in Potions, as always. He glanced up at the Slytherin table a few times and met eyes with a certain silver-eyed blonde Slytherin. He faked a smile at the Slytherin and turned back to making his potion, but he could still feel the blonde's eyes on him. This always gave him butterflies in his stomach.
Harry climbed the stairs out of the kitchen with Hermione and Ron. He couldn't believe that Dobby and Winky were working in the Hogwarts kitchens. Hermione was excitedly talking about S.P.E.W. and how if Dobby could be paid it would open the doors to house-elf rights. Harry was paying no attention to her, his mind was focused on his depression, Draco, and the next task even if it was a fair while away.
"Harry!" Hermione spat but couldn't help the laughter though the closer she got to Pansy the more nervous she became. "I swear, I'll- I'll- I'll," she stopped, forcing Harry to let go, and she took a deep breath as she looked at him. "I will come after you if this doesn't go as planned."
"Now?" Harry asked in disbelief, not wanting to go at all but he'll make it seem to Hermione that he was going. He doesn't want to disappoint her at all, so he made a mental note in his head to do it soon.
Harry felt something hard hit him, he collapsed onto the ground and heard someone shout. But he couldn't quite catch what they were saying because he was a bit dizzy. He looked up to the person above him and saw that it was none other than Dudley. He tried his best to slowly back away, but someone grabbed a hold of him and yanked him up off the ground to his feet.
They went left and followed the hallway down until they came across two stone tunnels which lead vertically away from each other. The tunnel to the left had a stone snake with purple eyes and it curled around the top of the tunnel entrance, and the tunnel to the left had a snake with blue eyes. Harry had a feeling which was the boy's entrance, and which was the girls.
Harry smiled at Draco, and he flinched when something cold and wet hit his neck. He rubbed the back of his hand and noticed it was water. It was starting to rain but he really didn't care. "So..." he said as he poked the wine bottle. It wasn't empty, but something in him wishes it was. "What was Draco Malfoy like before he came to Hogwarts?"
Neville grabbed hold of Ron and kissed him because he knew that Ron liked Blaise. He decided to make the Slytherin jealous. He heard a couple of gasps around him but really did not care, to be honest, he was actually liking kissing another bloke for some reason. He then pulled out of the kiss, looked over to see Blaise staring at him and Ron, who then looked down and stared at the floor in jealousy. He smiled and winked at Blaise.
Draco the ferret squeaked at this proposal. Yes, he would like to kiss his boyfriend but not like this, as a ferret. He wanted his human body back. He did not want to stay as this fluffy ferret for any longer even if he enjoyed the attention Harry gave him.
Draco smiled from the hug and leaned in, ending the space between him and Harry and giving him a long lingering lovable kiss and didn't care if he could taste himself from Harry's mouth. He wanted to give Harry as much love as he could. He wanted Harry to feel loved, to know what love really feels like because he deserves it from what Harry is suffering from. Everyone deserves to feel loved, he hoped so much that Harry did not doubt that. He leaned back an inch out of the kiss, pressed their foreheads together and held Harry's hand. "Let's head down for breakfast, I'm guessing it's nearly halfway through."
Pansy just smiled at him, seeing the need in Draco's eyes to see Potter again. Honestly, she and Ivy really need to do something to get the two together quicker. "You never let Ivy, Blaise, me, or anyone else for that matter touch your hair," she says, then poked at his arm with a grin on her face. "So, when will you ask him out?"
McGonagall walked back into the middle of the room where the gramophone was, a smile on her face as she turned it off. "Alright everyone, dance time is over," she said loudly so her students can hear her. "You may head to your dormitories for the rest of the morning. All I can say is well done; we have all learnt some new dances today."
Harry chuckles and thinks the same. He could eat two whole cows if it were humanely possible. "Let's go fill our bellies then," he said and quickly removed himself from Draco's lap. "I want more Turkey, and I'm sure Ron, Blaise, and Ivy are wondering where we've gone to. We need to make up an excuse instead of saying we've been snogging in a secret place for five whole hours."
"What did you have to wake me up at six in the morning for?" Hermione asked with a scowl, the pillow in her hand loosely gripped by her arms.
"Well, your breath doesn't smell like bunnies or chocolate either," Harry mumbled sleepily and rubbed his hands over his face to get rid of the sleepiness. He looked up at his boyfriend who was sitting on his waist with a look of confusion over his face.
Ivy nodded, agreeing with Pansy on that. "In fact, Pansy will go and ask Hermione to dance without fighting for her so you're not the only one who has to ask for a dance with the one you want," she said as she grabbed Pansy and Draco and ushered them to the dance floor. She needed to do this anyway.
"Hermione and I are just friends," Harry said, and he suddenly smiled at Viktor's curiosity. He's either too blind to see it or It seems Viktor's got a thing for Hermione. Maybe he's just bluffing? "I'm being honest."
Sooner than later, breakfast was finished and people either went back up to their dorms or stayed behind. It was a chilly month, so the students mainly went up to their common rooms to spend their day there. Harry, Draco, Ron, Blaise, and Ivy were the only ones left in the Great Hall.
"Oh, how marvellous!" beamed Narcissa. "Tell us. Do you cook with or without magic?"
Blaise and Neville immediately exited the loungeroom. With them, everybody else in the room except Samara. She returned to her tv with a grin on her face.
"That was incredible!"
"Yeah, way too nervous," said Hermione with a shake of her head, disbelieving that Malfoy would be this nervous when around Harry. He seems like he can control his emotions so it should be easy for him. "By the way, why were you here?"
The trio made their way down to the Gryffindor table, finding a place to sit. Everyone was excited to meet the schools that would be attending for the Tournament. Everyone watched outside to see if they saw anything strange, and of course, Colin saw the Beauxbaton carriage dive down to the Hogwarts grounds from the sky and land gracefully.
Mr Weasley laughed with joy like he knew something she didn't. "Oh, no. I asked him that and he said he doesn't want anything from us in return, but he thanked me for the invitation."
"It isss okay, Harry," Serpentine said sadly, his little tongue popping out of his mouth for a few seconds. "It isss jussst a life and death sssituation. It happensss at sssome point in our life."
*****
Draco gasped from the new feeling and the finger wriggling in his entrance. This wasn't un unpleasant feeling, but it wasn't a great one either. It was... neutral. "Have you ever done this before?" He could still taste Harry's come in his mouth.
Ron came out of nowhere and sat down on the Slytherin table in between Harry and Blaise. He extended his arm over the table when he sees the girl he's never seen before. Was she new to Hogwarts or has he not paid attention to anyone except for the Gryffindor's? "Hello, I'm Ron."
Harry nods, looking up at the Slytherin but doesn't believe him. How could he get better? How could he just forget everything the Dursley's have done to him and move on, get better? He decided to distract himself by moving down, and he could feel Draco's eyes on him. He went to the floor below Draco, squatting down between his spread knees. Running the flats of his palms up Draco's thighs, he made his way to Draco's cock. He could smell Draco's thick, heavy scent, the kind that made you want to bury your face between a man's legs and bite down on something, steal the taste from the surface of his skin. He lowered his face and rubbed his lips up and down his erection, running his tongue around his lips coquettishly to lick the taste away.
"Wait..." Harry said and hesitates for a minute. He blinks repeatedly at her and asked himself if she was speaking with honesty. But it just couldn't be true. "Do you mean...?"
Lavender smiled at Ivy before finishing off the rest of her pizza. She didn't eat the rest of her garlic bread due to her knowledge of a certain aspect that belongs to Ivy. "I haven't asked how your day was, Ivy."
"Hello," said a little soft voice and a giggle.
But he still went around the castle searching for Harry and still had no luck. He searched the ground floor of the castle, the second, third, fourth and all the way up to the seventh floor of the castle. There was still no sight of Harry Potter anywhere. He even checked the secret place in the Library that he showed Harry. He wasn't there either, or at the Willow tree. Merlin's Beard where was he? Deciding that this was just tiring, he headed down to the dungeons for his little prank on Pansy.
Harry smiled at Draco. He asked Ron not to and he trusts Ron to keep his promise. He just hopes both boys will keep their promises. "Oh, he won't," he told him with an honest tone, and a little sigh as Draco gave him a charming smile.
"Hey, 'Mione," Harry said with a small smile and his face felt a little warm at the mention of Draco's name. He wished he could see Draco again and talk to him. It wouldn't be fair if only Hermione and Ron knew of the Dragons and he didn't. "Yes, we went flying."
"I've finished my description; can you please check my paper?" Harry asked her and slowly lowered his raised hand, and he looked over at Hermione who also had finished her description of the plant. It must've taken her a few seconds to write a paragraph that was... half a damn page long. How the hell can she do that? "I also want to do something more, so I'm not bored."
I see my future in your eyes
Harry sat up in bed and wiped the sleep from his eyes, feeling the stinging sensation in his arm. He looked around the dormitory with blurred vision and grabbed his glasses from on the bedside table and slid them onto his nose. He cast a silent "Tempest!" telling him it was around 5 in the morning on Saturday. He sighed sadly and looked over at his sleeping roommate Ron Weasley who was in the land of dreams. He wished he could have dreams instead of scary nightmares that kept him up all night.
Draco slowly walked towards her, and he had his hands up in front of him as he neared her like she was a wild animal ready for attack or to run away. He was not going to let her get away with this at all. "Pansy, I swear if you do anything to my hair products..."
"POTTER! You seem to have it the wrong way around. It'll be you at Slytherin's celebration party tonight".
The twins had started Ginny from her deep thinking about her best friend. "Hello George," she said a little irritably as she didn't want to be disturbed at all right now. Her arm reached over the table to a cheese and ham toasty which she grabbed and started eating.
"Draco!" Lucius yelled from in the dark candle-lit hallway outside of his son's bedroom.
"I like this greeting very much," Draco said while looking back down at his nose. Harry's kisses were still lingering on his nose and it just gave him tingles and shivers all over. Is it possible to be so much in love with someone but you've ignored the feelings for so long?
"Oh, how can we ever thank you, Lucius?" Molly asked warmly from across the dinner table.
"Okay," Draco said blankly, thinking about Harry and nodded subconsciously. He pondered what Harry was doing right now. Was he still in class, biting his lip in concentration? It is a pretty attractive thing to do, especially how Harry does it. It always somehow makes his heart skip a beat.
Draco didn't need Harry to tell him what to do. He'd happily give his all to Harry any day. After closing the drapes around each other, they rid themselves of their clothes one by one until they were butt naked and kissing passionately in the slight darkness of Harry's bed.
Based in the second year at Hogwarts.
Draco felt soft lips kiss him back slowly, which made his heart skip a beat and a fluttery sensation intensify inside him, and he clung to those lips. Potter's lips were so perfect, they connected with his own lips flawlessly. All his senses were tingling, and he just didn't want this to stop. He kissed harder, craving more but knew he should stop soon but he didn't. He licked across Potter's bottom lip quickly, asking for entrance and when Potter opened his mouth, he slid his tongue in and twined their tongues together. Oh, Merlin, he was loving this. Potter tastes amazing, so sweet and sour at the same time. He can just smell the outdoors in Potter, the pine trees and wintery air. It was an incredible smell but of course, Potter always smells like the outdoors. Not that he knows what he smells like... because that would just be weird.
Harry bit his lip as he still felt Draco's lips still sliding over his own and he was looking into those beautiful silvery eyes he fell in love with. "We should head to class," he then said as he doesn't want to be late to class with Draco. Though detention with Draco seems fun. "We don't want to be hexed by Mad eye."
Draco turned his head to the side and whispered to Harry's scar, "He's right, you know?" He placed a kiss to Harry's scar, hearing Harry sigh and press into the embrace. "But even if it isn't right, I would still be dating you. After all, I fell in love with you."
Dumbledore sighed merrily and smiled. "It seems we have some muggle-raised children here, don't we?" he asked the two young girls in front of him but besides Harry, and they nodded at him. "I see." He waved his wand above his head in a circle and in a blinding flash, his outfit changed. Instead of his midnight blue robes he had been wearing, he was now in a white robe and a white pointy hat which only Harry, Chelsea, and Savannah knew the costume of the character Dumbledore dressed as.
"It's no problem, Harry," Hermione said, shaking her head to gesture he didn't need to show gratitude to her. She smiles and dumps her bookbag by her feet again. "If you finished that one, I have the second and third book in the series."
"Guys..." Everyone could tell it was Ron who said that by how shaky his voice was. Nobody knew what to do. it was just so dark. He felt cool breath on his arm, and he shuddered.
"What the s-s-sodding hell is going on tonight?!" Draco asked loudly as the corridor was filled with too many screams for Blaise and Pansy to hear if he whispered.
"So, you like this garden better than me, huh?" Draco asked curtly but with a smirk, trying to hide his sudden sadness at the thought of Harry saying 'yes. Merlin, it would hurt like hell. But he knows how much Harry loves him by the way Harry stares his way, or kisses and hugs him, or the way he moans his name during sex.
Draco watched Harry go to the flower meadow and smiled lovingly. He watched as Harry searched the meadow for the perfect flower. Draco then zoned out and thought about Ivy being in the Hospital Wing. She would love this, he thought with a frown. I hope that sometime I can show her this astonishing place. He knew this place would brighten her day up as she loves nature and its animals.
Harry, startled, looked down at the little boy with black hair and dropped down from the pull up bar. He crouched down to eye-level with the boy and smiled. "Hello to you too. Who might you be and where are your parents?"
Draco watched his father walk over to the red-headed family. He sighed and rested his head on his mother's shoulder. "Think he'll do it?"
"Certainly am," Harry replied, starting to pump Draco slowly.
Harry looked at her, seeing as she was in a lot of pain. Then suddenly he saw the most familiar sight and it was her wrists. They seemed to have blood dripping down from what looked like slits on her wrist. She's been cutting. He remembered seeing a news report on TV when Aunt Petunia was watching the news, a young teenage muggle girl was self-harming because her mother was a drunk addict, her father left her mother for some rich lady and the mother would beat the girl up whenever she was drunk.
Cedric nodded and smiled at Harry, seeing the same look in Harry's eyes that he felt back when he was thinking about his own sexuality. "Draco is quite good looking, to be honest, I've got to admit." Cedric elbowed Harry playfully. "Even though he can be really mean sometimes, but everyone has a soft side of them. Nobody can just be good or bad, they have both. Ying and Yang. There is no good without evil, and there is no evil without good. And it's what we act on that make us who we are."
Ivy watched her cousin walk up to his crush, feeling so proud of him. She hoped they will have a good night together. She then turned to Pansy, who just stood their mindlessly. "Well?" she asked her a little impatiently.
But as he thought that, light rain started pouring down and started covering themselves in tiny droplets. Harry just stared at Draco in a loving kind of way, he couldn't help it at all. The raindrops looked like tiny diamonds on Draco's hair, it made him look stunningly attractive! Well, to Harry, Draco Malfoy is so attractive anyway.
"Can I," Draco kissed him. "Stay," A kiss. "In Gryffindor," Another kiss. "With you tonight?" One final kiss.
Malfoy stared into those intense beautiful green eyes of Harry Potter. Here comes the explaining, but he had to make up a few bits and pieces. "I was thinking..." He smiled at Potter's impatient look. "Over the holidays I have come to realize that this weird little rivalry between us is just so childish. So, as I said before, I'd like to make a truce with you."
"Merry Christmas to you too!" Ron told him in a subdued voice all because of the early morning important day. But Harry just didn't know what use Dungbombs were for him. He'll figure it out someday. "Thanks for the gifts, Harry!"
"You get no food for a week, boy!" Uncle Vernon roared at Harry, hit him with the belt again then left the room.
Harry was shocked to see Hermione's whole arm disappear inside of the book bag; the bag surely wasn't that big. But then again, this was a magical school that teaches magic, so anything is possible. Even flying is real. Well, flying brooms and cars. Oh, and flying horses, keys, and pixies.
George and Fred shook their heads at him, knowing Harry would have never done it in the first place. "Harry, we know you'd never do something that silly." They admit that at first, they thought Harry would have done something but it took them a day to realize that Harry wasn't stupid enough to do something like that.
Draco's body was gorgeous. Harry loved every detail he could remember about it, and he planned to spend hours and hours exploring every square inch with his eyes, his hands, his mouth. But for all Draco's desirability, Harry's immediate hunger was for those ten glorious inches of hard cock, half of which seemed to be poking out above the waistband of his trousers, screaming Look at me. Taste me. Ride me. Harry's hole clenched tightly in anticipation and he let his need for sex shape his face as he stared up at Draco's heavy-lidded eyes.
"You should go and talk with her, I've heard that she's a Lesbian," Harry said and wiggled his eyebrows at her. He could see Hermione starting to blush, so he shoved her towards where Pansy was. "Come on, Hermione. Go to her!"
"Pansy, keep your voice down," Draco then said, a little uneasily as he looks down from where he stared at and at them. He swore he heard a gasp come from above them. "I don't want people finding out." He then furrowed his eyebrows, knowing Harry has an invisibility cloak. A quick glance over at the Gryffindor table he noticed Harry wasn't there, but Weasley and Granger were. Finnegan and Thomas weren't there though. He just hoped what he thought wasn't true. He leaned a little closer to them from over the table and said, "You know what my father will do if he finds out, don't you?"
"I just want to talk to you about a few things I've found...worrisome," Harry said, taking his eyes off George's scarred arm to look into his brown eyes.
"You know about muggle music?" Dean asked with a disbelieving voice, but then he gave her a tentative smile when he realized she did know about the muggle world. He was surprised a Pureblood knew about muggle things.
Draco was holding Potter tightly; he didn't want to fall but he also didn't want to let go. He still felt the fiery flame's heat on his face. Potter was guiding the broom around the flaming room, looking for Gregory on the floor but he wasn't anywhere. "Forget about him, Potter," Draco said sadly while holding back the tears of the loss of a good friend. "He's gone, he's not coming back." Potter nodded and soared out of the blazing room but as they flew to the door, a sudden blast knocked them off the broom.
Draco was still puzzled at how Harry's scar is causing him problems. "But what does it have to do with-?"
Draco blushed and tried to glare at Harry but couldn't. He just raised his eyebrow and rolled his eyes, shaking his head slightly. Harry giggled and gave Draco a kiss on the cheek, making the Slytherin blush while not noticing that Hermione, Pansy, Neville, Dean and Seamus were all smiling, giggling, and chuckling at them, making kissy faces, and shaping their hands to look like hearts.
Harry hesitates and felt his face go warm, and a blush forming on his cheeks at what Draco said. It was him who brought Draco the moon globe and the glass ball with the solar system in it. So, if he told Draco what he brought him, Draco would most likely kiss him in front of the whole school. The thought was both enthralling and anxious. He stared at Draco's smile, it always made him look much more attractive.
Harry leaned his head on Draco's shoulder, and he sighed at the breakdancing wizards. "Can we go somewhere alone?" he asked his boyfriend beside him in a quiet voice and rubbed his face a little on Draco's shoulder. His black hair tickled the Slytherin's neck a little and made the Slytherin laugh softly.
"Oh," Harry moaned, feeling the tension running through him and Draco continued pleasuring Harry, rubbing Harry's nipple over and over. "Mmm." He slid his body down the trunk of the tree until he was seated. Draco sat down beside Harry and leaned his head on Harry's shoulder. He sighed sadly and rest his hand over Harry's stomach.
"Only I know of it," Draco said, and his hand subconsciously moved closer to Harry. When he noticed it, he didn't move it back towards him or anything. He just left it there. "There's also a hidden place in the library, a bookshelf has this one book that stands out. It has a little icon of a white rose; the other books have no icons on them. There are so many places I know of in Hogwarts, thanks to my mother."
"Is it Crabbe and Goyle?" Draco asked, even though he knew it would be his cousin. He just loved messing with his father, it was just one of those father and son things. The only time his father would put on his 'Malfoy' mask was in public, at work, in a mood (which he normally is.) Malfoy's need to keep to our standards, even though Draco hates it so much.
Hermione raised her hand up in the air quickly.
Harry sighed. He didn't want to get up at all. Who wouldn't if the person you love so much is lying next to you? "Alright."
Ron was staring at himself in the mirror with what looked like a girl's dress in his arms. "Oh, nothing..." he said with a bitter smile. "It's just that mum brought me some weird dress robe for the Yule Ball. It literally looks like a dress, no kidding." He turned away from the mirror to face Harry.
Harry faked a smile at his friend as he stroked his own Niffler. It was a cute little thing but not as cute as Draco, if he was being honest with himself. He wonders if the Malfoy's ever had Niffler problems in their vaults, and how they would stop the infestation. What he believes would be just adorable and heart-melting is putting a Niffler on Draco's shoulder and seeing what it would do. If only there were white Nifflers, then that would be something.
Before Ron could say anything, Hermione came out of nowhere with her 'S.P.E. W.' badge formally presented on her robe. "What are you two on about now?" she asked her friends who seemed to be bickering.
Draco held his hand over his heart, wanting to just open the compartment door, storm in and jump on Harry to smuggle him with kisses. This was just beautiful. Hearing those words come from Harry's mouth is beautiful and oh so sweet. His darling. His Harry. His one and only.
"I mean, I really like helping people," added Harry with a slight frown. "But I don't want to continuously save them. The other Aurors can do that, they're the professionals." He sighed and looked into his cup of tea. "Maybe I want to live a slightly normal life and become a Hogwarts professor? It hasn't been one of my dreams, but it sounds nice. Hogwarts needs a Defence teacher anyway."
He was about to turn around and leave but Draco stopped him with a "Wait!" He looked into Draco's silver eyes, waiting for words to come out of that perfect mouth but nothing did. Instead, Draco surprised him by kissing his upper left cheek, leaving him speechless and blushing.
"Good morning, Potter."
Draco's eyes widen a little at the memory, and he looks to his side at Harry. "I did say that, yes," he said with a nod and licked his lips when staring down at Harry's lips. "You decide Harry. Want to be kissed now or when everyone gets back to Hogwarts which is in three days?"
Seamus looked over at Draco, who seems to be staring down at the spot Harry once was at. He just smiled and knew the Slytherin must be thinking of Harry since he's just staring at the place Harry has been seated at up until Ivy scooted over. "So, Malfoy. Do you want to tell us about ye crush on Harry? Or should Ivy? Oh, and would you rather we call you Malfoy still or Draco?"
"Hey Harry, when did you want to go on that date?" Draco asks, closing his eyes as the scent of pine flows through his nostrils and he feels immensely calm and relaxed. "Right now, I don't think I want to show our relationship status to the outside world. Not yet at least."
Harry rolled up his sleeve and stared at his bare arm. His arm had a few little scratch marks from weeks and months ago when he used his nails for harming himself when he didn't have his scissors with him. He crouched down and looked through the bathroom cupboard and grabbed some scissors from the back of the shelf, looking at the sharpness of the metal. He sat down and before he knew it, he zoned out, still staring blankly at the scissors. He started slicing at his wrist, watching his skin form marks and then a small line of blood. It was so beautiful, like raindrops falling down a window in a storm. The overwhelming wave of numbness hit him. He wanted to see more and feel number. He sliced, again and again, the last cut the hardest, most painful and the deepest. I deserve this pain. I'm just a freak who shouldn't even be living, he thought as he sliced one more time to make five cuts in total.
Neville chuckled at how romantic but also how odd that sounds to have an older man tell you to kiss under a bridge. "How utterly romantic."
Granger turned around and glared at him, not knowing what he wanted but it mustn't be good. "Malfoy?" What was he doing near the Gryffindor entrance? Did he know the portrait of the Fat Lady was the entrance into the Gryffindor common room? Good Lord, she hoped he didn't know.
Harry could have laughed, and the gentle touch from Justin suddenly calmed him down but it wasn't enough to make his pain go away. "Thank you, Justin." He tried to smile at the boy, but he could only muster a fake smile. It's all he really did now. Fake a smile. He even pondered if his friends are fake and are only friends with him because of his fame. What friends they would be... It's not like he needs them when all he needs is the sharpness of his scissor' blade. And they wouldn't care that he cries himself to sleep every night. It's something he has done for a while now. He has contemplated suicide too. There are sleeping pills in the medicine cabinet in the kitchen above the fridge... If only he could steal it and take it to his room... That will be the end of it. Just like that.
"He trusts you, but he will come out to you when he is ready," Ivy said just to assure him as she believes Harry will tell Draco anything. She can tell those two are soulmates just by the aura they give off. She is a median after all, but she hasn't told anyone about it. Apart from Draco and Pansy, of course. When she first told them, they had no idea what a median was to her amusement. It's all to do with the paranormal.
Ivy blushed, knowing not a what but a who she ate and damn, it was a meal of a lifetime. It's her favourite meal. "Lavender..." she said slowly, her voice rising until it spoke and she bit her lip in guilt. Darn it! Why didn't she think of brushing her teeth first after she got up?
Draco smirked. "ER is Ebony Rod, Harry," he said boldly and caressed a hand through his hair. It seemed Harry was watching him with a sparkle in his eye that Draco adored. "And which rod is the Ebony Rob?" He was quite enjoying this, it seemed Harry doesn't even know what a rod is. Oblivious Harry is a damned cute Harry.
"But what if this is a trap?" Harry points out and pointed his wand at the door as a precaution. "We saw the Ravenclaw and Gryffindor doors behind the green door, so what could be behind these doors?"
Harry let out a moan; he felt powerless and having Draco take control and press himself up against him made him hard. He could feel how hard Draco was. He was nearly as hard as a metal pole. Draco's hot wet tongue exploring his mouth felt so bloody amazing and he knew that deep inside, he wanted more. He wanted to skip Herbology so he and Draco had the rest of the evening to themselves to do whatever they want.
"I must be on my way too," Hermione said as she got up, taking her toast with her, and left without a goodbye. She wanted to get to class on time before Pansy does. It's like their friendship goal. Get to class before the other does.
Draco blinked as Harry had just cast the spell on him silently. "Very sneaky, Harry," he says, and he smiles at this cheeky Harry he never knew existed. He likes this sneaky Harry and getting to know him more. Perhaps being in classes will make them closer together. "Very Slytherin of you."
Fred and George looked at each other in disgust and shock. "No way, I'm not kissing him!" they chorused, pointing to each other.
The Nun pulled Cecelia towards her, and Cecelia screamed for someone to help her, but nobody did. When the Nun had Cecelia in her arms, she flared her teeth at everyone in the room and dug her teeth into Cecelia's shoulder blades.
Harry sighed in relief. He didn't want to be eating anything slimy or squishy. "Good!" he said, and that's when he notices the smirk on Draco's face. Uh oh. What's he up to now? "What is it, Draco? What are you thinking of?"
Harry was about to shake his head but remembered something did happen. Draco. It's the only good thing that has happened since coming back to Hogwarts. "Yes, actually," he said with a halfhearted nod of his head. "Back in Care of Magical Creatures class, Draco made a truce with me."
Pansy just sighed and went over to Hermione and Viktor. Her nerves were already increasing the closer she got to the dancing duo. Ivy sighed in relief. "Well, I hope they get what they both want," she said sadly and made her way to the music player where the muggle-borns and George were.
He paced back and forth a few feet away from the Slytherin entrance and waited for some Slytherin's to appear. He didn't see any. After all, it would be close to eight in the morning but he's sure people start getting up at around eight or try to.
Harry and Draco made their way to Flourish and Blotts with Lucius and the Weasley family were a few meters behind them. Flourish and Blots wasn’t a very far walk, and they noticed a large line of witches and wizards with their children were outside.
The boys sat down at the furthest desk and pulled out their textbooks. Draco searched through his textbook for something to try. With a spell in his mind, he closed his textbook and pushed it down three desks beside him. He pointed his wand at the textbook and said, "Accio 4th year Charms book!" The book flew towards him and landed in front of him on the desk. He smiled and cast the counter-spell. "Depulso!" The book flew back to where it was on the third desk beside him.
"Did not!" Draco snapped quietly at his friend from across the table. God, he hated her at times.
Ivy then realized that she was standing alone in the corridors. She cast a quick "Tempus" and it told her she had half an hour until her next lesson. May as well go to the library then, since she wants to get her nose in a good book.
Draco's heart fluttered in his chest as full green eyes looked into his own silver eyes and they sparkled with an inner light. He grabbed Harry's glasses from him and cleaned them properly just by breathing on them and wiping them with the material of his robe. "Anyway," he said distractedly as he handed Harry back his glasses with a smile. "I could really use some of that potion we made earlier. I feel like I could sleep for days."
Harry swallowed a groan and gave Draco a smile and a nod, excited for tonight's fun time. He was about to turn around and head towards the Gryffindor tower until Cedric came up to him.
“You’ve got mushed brains to think that I would do something so eccentric,” Lucius sneered, a little annoyed that someone touched his cane and tried to accuse him of something he didn’t do.
Harry was too hungry to think about when Ron and Hermione would be here, so he quickly grabbed a Ham/cheese/Lettuce & tomato sandwich and started eating. He only ate half of the sandwich but even so knew he really shouldn't have eaten it as he felt himself become sick.
Harry didn't want to tell the truth, nor did he want to get into trouble. But either way, both options get him into trouble. There was no escaping this. It's either tell Mrs Figg the truth and get punished later or lie to Mrs Figg but still get into trouble for even making this entire conversation exist. "I-, umm..." He looked at his Uncle who was glaring daggers at him, and then to Dudley who cocked an eyebrow at him, but he could see he was hoping Harry would lie. In the window beside Dudley was Aunt Petunia with her head poking out the window. "It's not true, Mrs Figg," he then said, looking back at Mrs Figg. "Dudley and I share chores." The relieved face of Dudley made Harry frown a little.
"It's a teleporter," said Ron, huffing and puffing as he tried to walk faster towards his family. It was a struggle to walk so far from home to some other place he didn't know how to get to.
"Hey yourself," Draco said and turned around to face Harry with a smile, his bookbag placed on shoulder and hanging quite loosely. Maybe it's best to quit worrying about Ivy and spend some time with Harry. "Ready for potion practice?"
The walls and floors were the same stone as the stone walls and floors in the common room but there was a large Slytherin green mat to keep the cold at bay. Inside the dorm on the right he found Draco just lying on the bed in the middle which was Draco’s bed. His fellow Slytherin was looking up at the ceiling of the bed with a smile. “Someone seems happy today.” He decided to make his presence known.
Draco playfully pushed Harry and chuckled. "No! No chamber of secrets, and these places aren't known," he said. He honestly wouldn't mind Harry showing these places as long as he doesn't show his Gryffindor friends. "I have a few trees I like to sit under, there's a broom cupboard that has a secret entrance that leads into some little room-"
She looked at the two boys, not knowing if they know this already. "Did you know Miss Ivy Black wears contact lenses?" she asked them, and then looked up at the three professors. "Her blue eyes are fake. Does anyone know of her real eye colour?"
Something then caught Harry's eye. It was a someone. Ron. "Is that Ron and Blaise heading out into the Grand Hall?" He asked and pointed towards the two boys who were exiting out of the Great Hall. It was intriguing to watch. Where were they going instead of lunch?
Neville continued from where he left off just as Ginny got Luna’s attention once again by kissing her cheek. "How were your holidays, Harry?" he asked when gingerly patting his cactus on its skin where no spikes were.
"Oh, sorry," said Luna and walked up to her. She didn't show any horror at all, besides the twinkle in her eyes. Typical Luna Lovegood. "Here's your Dolly."
*****
Harry and Draco both only realized that they were still in the same position, but they didn't seem to mind at all or realize that they were being stared at by older students: one Ravenclaw and one Hufflepuff.
"I love you, Draco Lucius Malfoy," Harry said, his actual voice echoing through the room. He walked to the left, out of sight before Draco could reply back. It was time for another costume change.
"It was great meeting and talking with ye, Ivy," Seamus then said while getting up from the table, his hand still intertwined with Dean's. With a wave goodbye, much like Neville's, he then left the Grand Hall with his Boyfriend.
They hurriedly walked to where they think she could be next, trying not to get caught by Filch but all they knew was that he was at the Yule ball dancing with his cat. Pansy checked the other girl's bathroom but found nothing, and Draco checked Myrtle's bathroom. Nothing beside Myrtle moaning in one of the toilet stalls. He felt like giving up on finding her. It's like she doesn't exist anymore! But then he remembered her favourite place. The Clock Tower. He then began the long walk up to the Clock Tower where he found nothing again. He hated this and the anxiety he felt was eating him from the inside.
Draco watched as Harry flew away, still feeling the warmness of holding onto him. He really liked the hour he spent with Harry but wished for more time with the Gryffindor. He was fun, gentle, kind... He started to trail off into his train of thoughts with Harry on his mind as he began to head down for lunch in the Great Hall.
Blaise stalked into the Slytherin common room, past some giggling girls who he decides to just ignore and headed for the fourth year boy’s dormitory. He likes to admire the dorm room every time he walks in. It was nice and large, and it had the tall arched glass windows looking out into the Black Lake and over time you would be able to see a Merfolk swim by or the Giant Squid. The windows had their own dark green curtains hanging down and just touching the floor.
"Farewell, Harry," Draco said with a wave goodbye. He turned to leave for the exit with a bright smile planted on his face. He heard Bagman's voice echoing throughout the arena, announcing Harry's scores. There was a moment of silence as the crowd did the math and a roar of excitement as they realized that Harry had tied Krum for first place. Unbelievable, Draco thought with a groan. How does he do that?
"I actually came to see Draco," Harry states. He didn't think this Blaise guy would even believe him when he says he needs to see Draco, but Blaise just nods at him like he's known all along. He couldn't have, right? "We were in the library. He forgot his rose."
"Brilliant!"
"Hey, everyone! Guess what?" Mr Weasley asked with beaming excitement at his children, Harry, and Hermione. Everyone looked over to Mr Weasley with wide eyes, wanting to hear what he had to say.
Draco seemed to know what Harry was thinking and chuckled, "Who cares if they think that, that rumour will probably come true in the future." He winked at Harry, grabbed his boyfriend's hand, and started kissing it. "We have sucked each other off once. I'll be glad to do it again whenever you want."
"Should have told me, or even everyone here when you first showed up inside our house that you were gay," said Ginny. She shook her head. "Would have made everything easier."
Harry looked into Draco's warm silver eyes, feeling his heart pound in his chest for his Slytherin boyfriend. "Just in case you need remembering, you're honestly so beautiful."
Mrs Weasley was the first to notice him, greeting him with a kiss and a hug.
"Yeah...," Ron said with a nervous tone, sliding under his chair just to not be seen. It was just an accident.
"Oh, I don't know," said Fred and shrugged a little. He learnt the Macarena, Nut Bush, and Gangnam style from the fifth-year Muggle-borns. Their names are Elton who's a Gryffindor, Rosemary's a Ravenclaw, Nikola's a Gryffindor, and Corbyn's a Hufflepuff. Elton and Rosemary are actually from America, and Corbyn and Nikola are from Australia. They came to the United Kingdom when they were young and grew up here. "The macarena, Gangnam Style and Nut Bush? Oh, and by the way, what were you laughing at when we entered the Great Hall?"
"How do I contact him then, Professor?" Harry asked him, feeling just a little impatient right now. If he could just Floo to Professor Snape's office and from Grimmauld Place, his dark Potions professor can take him to Draco from Hogwarts.
Pansy began to panic, and she shuffled back a little, but it only made the barrel they were in start to spin and they all lost their balance.
Grinning under his mask, Anthony went towards Draco. This was just too easy. he could do this over and over again.
Draco's Malfoy mask fell over his face, blocking out his true emotions. "I'm sorry, Harry," he said, and as he looked into those pretty green eyes, his mask was removed and replaced with sympathy. "I shouldn't have mentioned it."
"She said my hair will grow back and that it won't leave a mark," Cedric said with a laugh and gave Draco a knowing smile before walking towards another tent with Draco by his side. "So, what's with you caring for Harry now? I mean, I know you two are friends now and all..."
Harry grabbed the blade and laid his arm over the sink. He rolled his sleeve up over his elbow and scanned his arms, remembering every cut that lay on his arm that he did over the holidays and at Hogwarts. He placed the blade on his arm, shivering at the coldness of the blade. The coldness of the blade was nice on his arm though. He then sliced the blade across his wrist and watched as a line of blood formed where the blade crossed and watched as droplets of blood fell down on the sink like rain droplets. He again sliced the blade around his forearm, watching another line of blood form. He slid the blade across his arm again and again until he had five cuts in total. He started feeling a bit light on his feet like he could just float through a wall like Myrtle.
Cheeky Bugga's, Harry thought as he snorted at the two twins who winked back at him as he stared at them. It made a familiar heating feeling spread from his neck and up to his face.
"Hello, Harry," he says as they walked together to the Great Hall. "Sorry about earlier. How was your night? Did you get enough sleep?" The questions just seemed to pop out of his mouth every three seconds.
"I don't know if I'm allowed to though," Draco says, shaking his head and he gives Harry's hand a little squeeze. If he were allowed then he would bring Blaise, Pansy, and Ivy with him, so he wasn't the only Slytherin at the table. "I'm not exactly your date, remember? We just... came together."
“What horse, Harry?” Draco asks, confused with what Harry’s talking about when looking around at their surroundings. He takes a step up onto the carriage and turns around to help Harry up by the hand. They seated themselves on the comfy black seats in the carriage and places their arms around each other.
Harry sighs miserably and looks around him for something to do. He sees a rock and decides to try and skip it. It didn't work unfortunately as Harry has never had anyone to teach him how to skip rocks. He was a lonely child when he grew up. No friends, a hated life, punished in the worst way possible. It was all the more reason why he shouldn't be living. The only thing that changed and made his life worth living is finding out he was a wizard when he was eleven and going to Hogwarts. The odd part was realizing he was famous just because he survived the killing curse as a baby. The killing curse that should have killed him, instead it gave him a shitty life. A life in which he doesn't want to live. It's all just one big lie. He lies to everyone, telling them he's fine when he knows he's not.
He looked back at the Sleeping Draco Malfoy but knew Hermione was still watching him with that annoying knowing smile on her face. Really, he just couldn't help to not look at this beautiful bloke beside him. He didn't even recall moving his hand up to even touch the blonde's hair but as he felt how soft and silky his hair was, he drew his hand back as Draco fluttered his silver eyes open.
"You mean Gryffindork," Draco retaliates back after containing his laughter and crosses his arms over his chest. Even though he's Harry's friend, he likes riling him up because it's just cute watching him get all annoyed or angry because of him. It just always has been the Potter-Malfoy thing in their relationship.
Draco nodded, "And in which bottle is it?" Good Merlin he hoped Harry knew what Lavender looked like.
Blaise walked forward and crashed into a mirror, which he thought was a pathway. He was wrong. Pansy actually began to laugh at him but as she turned and went left, she crashed into a mirror too. This maze of mirrors was just so confusing. Blaise then laughed back at her, earning him a glare from Pansy but he didn't care.
Pansy quickly shook her head, her lip trembling when staring into yellow eyes. Such disgusting eyes. She whimpered and leaned away from the clown thing. Pennywise frowned. He let the balloon go, and it floated up to the ceiling.
Cedric smiled as Harry walked up to them. "Hello, Harry. I'd like you to meet my boyfriend, Joshua. Joshua this is Harry."
"Why don't we wait until your shoulder is better," Draco suggested and ran a hand through his hair and like always, Harry just watched Draco's hair bounce back into place like it was the most fascinating thing to see. It was to him anyway. "Go flying afterwards?"
He rushed over to his cousin so he wouldn't fall splat on the floor, and from behind, he tried to make his cousin vomit the pills up by pushing into his stomach with his hands. He could feel Harry slowly slipping away, and this ooze was coming from the inside of his cousin's mouth which was just disgusting and smelt like chemicals. "Come on, you prat!" He continued pumping Harry's stomach until he heard a gagging and vomiting sound, so he sighed with relief but kept pumping his cousin's stomach.
Dudley turned back around swiftly and shouted, "No! We had our playtime. Let's see if we can find someone else!" Harry thought that he saw... guilt in his cousins' eyes but he knew he was mistaken. It must have been the sunlight reflecting off his glasses.
Nawww!
"I..." He didn't want to answer that question, so he got back to playing the chords on the piano. He didn't know why, but he felt relaxed and calm when Harry was with him. {If I could do it all over, maybe I'd do it different.}
Eventually, Harry withdrew, leaving Draco sopping wet with saliva and aching with desire to be taken. The bed shifted around him, and he awaited Harry's next move with bated breath.
Harry, surprised that it even would speak to him gave the snake a small nod. "Yesss, I can. I'm not a normal human though."
"Yes," said Emilie with a nod, her Annabelle costume looking as scary and real as it ever could be. It frightened nearly everyone in the room, because of how realistic it was. But that was good. The more real everything and everyone looked, the better the prank will be. "Fake blood is just so cheap! I could stock up on it if we were to make a movie."
A loud banging, and it could only have been from a fist, was heard from the bathroom door. "Boy! Are you in there!"
Ivy nodded and began biting at the sausage roll, it actually tasted a bit better now that she was eating the meat part. She looked over at the Ravenclaw table to the Beauxbatons girls in their blue uniforms and extremely short skirts. It's honestly so mouthwatering.
Fred lifted his Cleansweep 5 up just in time so he couldn't fall off. "Heyyy," He yelled annoyingly with a prolonged 'y' as he trailed behind Harry. "Watch where you are going! Don't want to fall off, now do you?"
Well, you done, done, me and you bet I felt it
"As long as it's not cold enough to freeze us to ice, then we'd be okay," Harry told them, looking out the window at the grassy field where little dandelions that look like the sun grew. "Besides, we can cast warming charms on us if we need to."
“And who might you be if you have the right to hold my son’s hand?” he asked the young boy standing next to his son with, as his son has described perfectly well, green eyes that are brighter than the son, and hair as dark as the night sky on a stormy night.
We were victims of the night
Harry shook his head. "I will stop at the kitchens on my way there," he told them and that indeed was another lie that he told. He then turned and made his way back to Gryffindor Tower.
Harry smiles and looks down at the Malfoy ring on his finger which kind of makes him feel connected to Draco in some way. "Um, thank you." He just didn't know about keeping this ring. What if he loses it? He admired the Malfoy emblem on the ring, with the two black horses with wings, the large 'M', and the vining outline of it. "I guess I'll see you then, Draco Malfoy."
Harry paused as he heard the doorbell ring. He spat out the toothpaste, gathered some water in his mouth and spat it out. He cleaned his toothbrush and rushed out of the bathroom, down the stairs and towards the front door. He checked himself out in the mirror just a few meters away from the door, looked at his teeth and nodded in approval.
The professor nodded at him and went back to her desk to pile her work up into a stack. "Alright, class," she announced in a lurid voice and made the rest of the cages beside her desk float over to the rest of her students. "Practice the spell."
"Please..." Dean said and intertwined Seamus' hand with his. "We all pretty much know about you two and when we saw you enter the Great Hall together it was kind of obvious when we never saw Harry enter the dormitory last night."
Draco glared at Pansy but nodded his head, very much feeling jealous over Harry. It should be him on the dance floor with Harry, not Weasel number two. He squeezed the chair he sat on in anger, frustration, and jealousy. "Everte Statum his ass I'll surely do," he muttered so only Pansy and Ivy could hear.
Next came a punch to the face, and then a kick to Harry's stomach, and Harry wheezed in oxygen from his lungs while spitting out blood from his mouth. It wasn't a good mixture. Finally, the belt hit Harry hard against his neck, causing a red bruise to form where the belt hit, and Harry hissed in pain but took it all in. He was waiting for more but more didn't come. He just wanted to shout at his Uncle to keep going, to make him suffer even more but he didn't have the ability to say it.
Joshua kissed Cedric on the cheek for the compliment and looked back to Harry. "Why, that's splendid!" He smiled at the younger boy. "I'll be looking forwards to seeing you ready for the test after your graduation."
"Um...sir," said Draco, biting his lip. "You kno-"
"Say, Harry," Seamus said in a curious voice, nudged him with his elbow and winked at him. He's a little curious himself about Harry's love life since his fellow Gryffindor likes to isolate himself for some unknown reason. "Have ye got yer sights on a certain girl?"
Draco took his chance as the killer stopped and made a run for it. He just had to get away, had to escape this place.
They stripped each other slowly, and carefully, making sure to leave kisses on every part of skin that they could both reach and savour for themselves. Draco waved his wand around while muttering a non-verbal spell and all the drapes around him and Harry shut closed. Smirking, he pushed Harry down on his back on the white sheets, and he smiled at the hardening member below him. He wanted it. He wanted it in his mouth and up his arse. Sensing Draco's need, Harry spread his legs as far as they could go for him.
"My night was fine, yes, and I got a decent amount of sleep," said Harry and he jammed his hands into his pockets, wanting to pull his hoodie over his head to block out the rest of the world but Draco was there. It wasn't a bad thing that Draco was here, of course, but the Slytherin would always tell him to not hide from the world and Harry would try for him.
Before Harry and the contestants walked into the Great Hall
"What?" Harry says with a shrug and looked up at Draco, silver eyes meeting green. He smiled and caught up to him. Beds back then should be comfy, right? Maybe they are made from a different material. "If that was Helga's room, I'd like to see how comfy beds were back in her days."
Harry let the butterflies within him flutter and his heart hammer against his chest like it wanted to come out and escape. "Draco," he said and reached his hand up to wipe away the tear that decided to fall down the Slytherin's cheek. It hurt to see Draco crying even if he wasn't in pain. The tears reminded him of stunning diamonds glimmering in the sunlight. "I love you too, and I know others love me. Why I know this is because you keep telling me. Thank you-" He spots Blaise Zabini walk out of the Great Hall. "I-I um, I need to go. Goodbye, Draco!"
"The dreamless sleeping potion, why?" Draco asked her and rested his elbow on the desk and leaned his chin on his hand. He sighed as he noticed a patch of black on Pansy's book and smiled at it. It wasn't as dark as Harry's hair, but it definitely made it harder to not get the thought of him out of his head.
He was drenched in sweat as well as his own bed. He rubbed the sleep out of his eyes, grabbed his glasses off the bedside table, grabbed his wand and cast a quick cleaning charm on the bed and in a second, the bed was sweat-free.
"Well I'm sorry, but it's true," Ron replied solemnly with a slight smile, making Hermione sigh, roll her eyes and continue reading her book.
Harry smiled at the two boys so much in love and sighed at them. This was nice to hear and see. Real teenage lovers. "Your secret is safe with me," he assured them. "By the way, you guys are cute together," he said honestly with a smile. Well, he hoped the smile was enough to fool them.
The second finger followed it quickly, but Harry had the wrong angle for Draco to do anything more than stretch the tight ring of muscles, so that's all he did. His mouth formed an 'o' shape but he reached behind him to his robe but not far enough for the finger to slide out of him and reached into the pocket, grabbing out the lube he hasn't shown Draco yet.
Draco snorted quietly and kissed him. "C'mon, let's get up and head down to breakfast," he said as he pulled away from the kiss and got off the bed.
Draco froze as he felt something touch his outer left leg, and he looked to the side at the space beside him. He felt like his mind was playing tricks on him because nobody was there but there was a slight dip on the seat beside him and he smelt... pine. Yes, his mind was definitely playing tricks on him and thinking that Harry was beside him. The pine scent though... He couldn't help but close his eyes and take a deep breath in through his nose.
"Are you hungry?" Joslyn asked the owl. The owl nodded, so she grabbed a box of 'Jatz' biscuits and handed one to the white snowy owl. She didn't know what owls eat, besides mouses but there was no way she would catch one for the owl.
