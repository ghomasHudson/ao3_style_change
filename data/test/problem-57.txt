Draco stopped, and stared at Henry. Blush when he realised he was feeling much better than before - less tense, less anxious. Not that he is going to give Henry the satisfaction.
“They seem familiar, don't you think?” Ginny tilted her head, calculating with her eyes. “As if we've seen them before.”
"You found him?!" cried both Ron and Hermione at the same time and just then Harry realised that he hadn't told them about it. He quickly gave them a sheepish smile, adjusting his glasses.
He marched purposely towards a small crowd of Slytherin, eyes locked to the particular white-blond head and growled when he got closer but yelped when he was suddenly yanked aside and met with a betrayed face of Seamus. He immediately yielded.
It was said with a finality, as if Malfoy had no right to decline the request. Pressing his lips into a thin line, Harry sent an exasperated glare towards Hermione who had her chin upwards as she gave Malfoy a challenging look, but the Slytherin male only raised his brows in amusement.
They simultaneously sat back on their father's lap, and gave him their best smile hoping that they didn't push him too far. Their father hitched a breath with widened eyes, perhaps surprised by their movement.
They stood still when they heard aunt Hermione’s voice, and quickly tugged the Cloak off them as Scorpius moved to put the Cloak back in the trunk and Albus worked to deactivate the Map. They simultaneously jumped in their dad's bed, scrambling themselves under the blanket and feigned a sleep just in time as the door was opened.
“Just a possibility.” said Henry softly, carefully reaching out to place a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “That was the reason why I want to check your body. Properly, thoroughly, if I may.”
Harry, on the other hand, let his eyes rested on his fidgeting little husband, soaking the view of how beautiful his little husband looked as flushes of pink decorated his face. He was aware that Draco was feeling self conscious, awkward and embarrassed at the same time. He knew that Draco doesn't know what to do around him, and he knew that above everything, Draco was still overwhelmed by the information of his life in the future; having a husband, twins and an unfortunate case of an old curse.
Draco raised his brows at the black haired boy, nonplussed by the way his mind was thinking. It was a sly plan indeed, to use the Cloak to enter the Restricted Section. But first, there was one thing Draco needed to know. He turned a speculative gaze to Scorpius. "How did you know about the Invisibility Cloak?"
He knew he wouldn't be that kind of parent who proclaimed a study room as a forbidden room for their child because that was what his Father did and he doesn't want to raise his children with the same environment. Therefore, he needed to be smart.
It took a moment of embarrassment for Harry when Malfoy finally reacted. “You're... worried about me?”
Immediately, Harry's heart felt heavy. He turned to Draco and took a hold on his hand. "Find the last Horcrux, and destroy it. Come back to me as soon as possible."
Henry bit his lips as he regarded Draco, and shrugged easily. “Well, I need to check your body actually.”
"Right." said Harry as he stood up, looking out the window to see the dark sky was about to change its colour. He gathered his things, bundled them up together and turned to Malfoy, unsure what to say.
But Draco doesn't stop, he can't stop because he can't bear the thought of Potter rejecting him right on his face.
He feels a great amount of emptiness once Potter has his son back in his arms, so he covers it up by stiffly straightening his clothes, felt it was a bit damp from where he had held James earlier.
"Well, I'm trying!" said Harry, throwing his hands in the air. "But he kept avoiding me, and just looked at those Slytherins hanging around him."
“It's time to go home, Malfoy.” smiled Potter sweetly, creating those ridiculous somersaults in Draco’s stomach but he sighed instead, “I guess I am.”
“Dean and I arrived when the Slytherins were in the middle of handing out these chocolates around the table.” Seamus grinned, bumping his shoulder to Dean who nodded. “Asked one of them but they were too secretive about it apparently. Just told me to enjoy the chocolate, one for each student.”
Before Draco can answer, a hand snaked possessively around his waist, pulling him to collide with a sturdy chest. “That would be my job, thanks.”
“Well then, do you think we can continue?” Malfoy tilted his head in a questioning manner, and Henry nodded his head in an instant. "Of course! I'm sorry for earlier."
Draco felt a hot rush to his face, spreading to his cheek. He stared at Weasley, flustered, as he tried to calm himself down. He can't let them see how much it bothers him now that they know his status.
"Right." Harry nodded, and bore his eyes somewhere on Malfoy's shoulder, content on resting eyes there.
He swallowed the bitter taste in his mouth as the man reached them and drew a good natured smile on his face. The man's gaze fell on each one of them, and Harry can't help but notice there's a twinkle in those - dear Merlin, his eyes were green. They stopped on Harry, there was something in those eyes that made him unconsciously gulp. He can literally feel the man's magic, so powerful that he was sure the others can feel them too.
All of them turned to see Headmistress McGonagall has reached their small group with a stern look on her face.
Draco was impressed, as he understood now how these two boys managed to come this far. Scorpius was the one who searched for information; in other word, the brain in this plan of theirs, and Draco was sure that Albus was the type who dive head first the moment they knew they had come up with a solution. He must be the one who anchored Scorpius into action.
“I think we can manage that but you might not like it, papa.” said Scorpius sneakily while Albus lets out a small smirk, lifting up his head in a confident manner. Draco arched an eyebrow suspiciously. “Care to elaborate?”
Robards was looking at him closely, with the distinct focus of someone trying to determine whether there was food in the teeth of whoever they were looking at. As if he could see directly into Harry’s thoughts and seem them spiralling away from him. He didn’t seem convinced.
, Harry echoed, unable to focus his eyes on anything other than Malfoy’s eyes, or Malfoy’s long fingers gently holding onto his wrist.
Upon seeing Draco, however, the wide grin stilted and shrank, his eyes lost their sparkle, and there was no way Draco could lie to himself and pretend anymore that it didn’t hurt.
‘Last minute rota change,’ Malfoy brushed it off with a wave of his hand. How could he be so nonchalant when Harry was seconds away from hyperventilating over here? ‘I had to cover Ivy but it’s no big deal.’
Apparently over his initial wariness, Potter rolled his eyes. ‘This isn’t some special out of office visit if you have to come to
Sam’s eyes flicked to the floor in a mock submission, Harry didn’t believe the show for a single second. ‘I know, and I’m sorry.’
Luckily, having known him and his temper so long, Hermione seemed to realise this and changed tack. ‘Alright, alright. I just think you need to be careful now. You don’t know what happened to him,’ she lowered her voice to a whisper, ‘
Four months into their “relationship” and Harry, personally, couldn’t have been happier. Even Draco didn’t have many complaints, despite his initial refusal to go along with the scheme.
He most certainly does not need to be having a crisis about the hotness of his former childhood rival who sat in his office as if he owned it every Friday afternoon.
… yes, that would be lovely. Harry.’ Sam cast his eyes downwards to his coffee and Harry caught the tiny half-smile in the corner of his mouth again.
In fact he spent the following two weeks in a daze, numbly making his way through his paperwork, file after file, without really reading anything written on them. If he had been a muggle, you could’ve told him all about wizards and Voldemort and magic and he wouldn’t have heard a word. The only reason he managed to eat was Hermione’s insistence on popping into his office every lunchtime, dragging him to the canteen, and forcing him to buy enough for lunch and leftovers for dinner each day. Weekends were a tough spot, but she tag-teamed it with Ron and Ginny - as awkward as
As if Harry had struck him with a stinging hex, Draco leapt up from his seat. He shot Harry another look of pure hatred which Harry valiantly tried (and failed) not to visibly cower under, spun around on his heels and marched out of the room.
not me finally updating after not being able to find the will/motivation/right words for what feels like months? but has probably only been two weeks? to make up for it I think this is my longest chapter yet? they seem to just be getting longer and longer I have no self control
Not even half a second after almost falling flat on his face after a decidedly ungraceful exit from the floo gate, Harry was being heckled by a rowdy table towards the back of the pub. Looking over, he spotted his friends taking up the entire back row of the newly refurbished Three Broomsticks, a sight that was becoming somewhat of a familiar sight for their regular Friday night pub nights.
Ron, as impeccably timed as ever, distracted him completely by handing him another beer, and promptly swapping the topic of Harry’s train of thought from one Malfoy to another.
But the jealousy that had spiraled through him at the sight of Patch, as the sight of the ease Malfoy had with him, refused to remove itself from his system. The jealousy Harry felt over something as petty as the thought that Malfoy could be comfortable with this man and not with him, tore him up and he couldn’t get over it.
‘ENOUGH,’ Potter roared, before taking a deep breath and seemingly collecting himself. Stepping away from the fight, reminding himself that he was actually Draco’s parole officer and not a fourteen-year-old fighting in the middle of a Hogwarts courtyard, it was all very disappointing. ‘Now, if you could stop being such a git, I’d like to get on with these bloody questions.’
He didn’t understand: how could he not even fear Voldemort? The man who killed his parents and all but decimated the wizarding world? Then he was faced with hundreds of dementors and nearly had his soul sucked out (along with his godfathers), and he understood. Listening to the last moments of his parents’ lives, and then their deaths, was enough to realise he wasn’t
Harry froze. His heart stopped beating, his eyes were as wide as they could be, and the palms of his hands became horribly clammy.
Harry willed himself to move, to look up at Draco. Drawn, as always, to those gorgeous grey eyes, Harry couldn’t help but notice the hints of worry he saw there, and the nervous way that Draco now held himself.
If this was Potter’s idea of  “enjoying each other’s company”, then someone needed to have a strict word with him about how to actually
It was only as Potter turned to head to the door that Draco realised they had both completely forgotten he was there. He cleared his throat and Potter jumped a mile, almost jostling Edward back onto the floor.
‘Nothing to get excited about?’ Ron was in disbelief. He turned to George, ‘Nothing to get excited about he says! Like he’s not had a date in over a year and a half, like we’ve not been trying to set him up with every witch, wizard, and muggle we can!’
But Draco was already storming to the fireplace, ignoring all attempts to get his attention. He took a large handful of floo powder, shouted “
Hermione said nothing, just nodded approvingly. A picture of calm in the midst of Harry’s world flipping on its head.
In a desperate, last-ditch attempt at wooing the boy he’d been in love with for a year now, Harry had invited Draco round to his dorm for pizza and another movie. He had also received multiple winks and nudges from all of their friends who, upon seeing Harry with his arm around Draco and Draco asleep on Harry’s shoulder on their last attempt, had realised they’d been date-crashing and had solemnly sworn to stay clear of the dorm for the entire evening.
‘Noooo!’ Came the response. Draco chuckled, he should have expected his baby cousin to be just as difficult a child as the rest with Black blood flowing through their veins; it was practically a family trait.
Of course, Harry’s new worst enemy couldn’t see it that way. All they could see was the Dark Mark on Malfoy’s arm, and the history of blood purism behind his name. All Harry could see was a child soldier that had been bullied into joining the wrong side, and another eighteen year old who’d had little more of a childhood than he’d had.
Hermione finished her mini rant with a flourish and plopped back down into her seat, unaware that her impassioned speech had caused her to stand. Ron and Harry just sat there in silence, staring at her. They knew well enough that Mione on a mission was certainly not one to go up against, but since she became a firm fixture in the office of the Minister of Magic she’d become even more formidable.
There was a brief break in the clouded haze for the parole meeting Draco Malfoy, even though the whole event had been filled with Malfoy’s obnoxious flirting (Merlin only knows
‘Of course not, spending time with young cousin Edward is always a joyous occasion.’ Leaning down to pick up his sweet baby cousin, Draco deftly chose not to disclose that he happened to know
Stealing a glance at the blond beside him, Harry smirked at the uneasiness coming off Malfoy in waves. For as much as Malfoy was more open to Muggles and the Muggle world, it was obvious that he had yet to explore much further than the streets around his mother’s house, and the Leaky Cauldron.
‘Just Draco. Right.’ Harry frowned down at his glass of punch. He’d never thought of it that way before.
Draco blinked. Potter had managed to say all that in about five seconds flat. ‘Well. that sure was a lot of information to take in that quickly. My condolences, although he sounds like a twat. But why a new coffee shop?’
, no thanks to him) year ever. Hell, he’d even take a quick midnight duel with Malfoy at this point, just to remember what it was like to be eleven and having midnight duels in the Trophy room. But that wasn’t possible. Because Malfoy had been sent to Azkaban. Because he was a Death Eater. Because Voldemort marked him.
But having him sit there, chattering on about whatever it was Harry had asked him (he’d already forgotten,
, Harry could hear Malfoy’s condescending tones loud and clear in his mind. Great, even his own head was against him.
When he’d explained the reasoning behind it being his left arm to Hermione, she’d cried. And then he’d cried. And when Ron had come in and asked what was wrong, he cried too. It was an old muggle belief that the wedding band goes on the fourth finger of the left hand as it’s the only finger that was connected directly to the heart. Having permanent representations of his parents, Remus, and Sirius dancing along his forearm, along the same veins and nerves as the ring finger, felt like they’d be tapping in to the same beliefs.
Only Draco's face quickly flicked between expressions, almost too quickly for Harry to catch; from shock to confusion to understanding to outrage to pure, unadulterated hatred. It had been a while since that particular expression had been directed at Harry, and he certainly did not miss it. It was as if Harry had personally insulted his firstborn child.
’ for each line rather than the full lyrics and jumping as he did so; not for the first time was Harry struck quite vividly with the similarities between Abu the monkey and his very own Ted-monkey.
‘I… um… yes I did. It was me who suggested assigning you and Malfoy to Kingsley in the first place.’ She finally managed to look Harry in the eye, and the level of guilt he saw was almost enough for him to feel sorry for her. Almost. Ron on the other hand…
He knew Potter was just using his first name to wind him up, and Draco’ll be damned if he lets it slip that it was working.
is hardly the only establishment for a wizard to get a cup of coffee in Britain, nor is it by far the best. The Java Snitch is a much higher class of cafe. Plus it’s quidditch themed, so. It’s a win-win.
his life - even if you didn’t know the whole truth about him - was better than you rejecting him and refusing to be in his life. He’s ignored how he’s felt this whole time, all these years, because being your friend was worth more to him than jeopardising it over what could be. Not to mention, he’s had no idea for the last seven years whether there was any hope of you liking him back or not! Honestly, that boy is more oblivious than you, sometimes.’
‘Maybe because you can’t look me in the eye properly without grimacing? You bloody well know that you can’t lie to me Harry Potter.’
‘What, Harry? No way, we’ve been friends forever. I think I’d know if he fancied anyone, let alone me.’
Right under his nose? Maybe someone who went through the war with him? Although that ruled out almost the whole of his year and the year below, except for Malfoy of course since he’d been in Azkaban, as everyone had paired off pretty soon after the end of the war and rushed into marriage with their childhood sweethearts. It was a huge relief that he hadn’t done the same with Ginny, they would have truly made each other miserable before they reached their first anniversary, let alone for the rest of their lives.
starting to get through to them all! The older years were easier as most of them fought in the battle, or their parents or siblings did, but the younger ones are finally starting to follow in their footsteps! And if keeping Draco Malfoy out of Azkaban by assigning him to Harry for his parole will help in any way, then so be it!’
The corner of Draco’s mouth twitched before he schooled it back into a blank mask. ‘Did it ever occur to you why I might think it was such a terrible idea? Besides being yours, I mean?’
worry if he was late home. She hated him going out without her these days, especially since he’d told her the reasoning behind his parole meetings being moved to outside of the Ministry. Any wand-happy death-eater-hater could chance upon him and that would be that.
?’ If Draco hadn’t heard Potter’s own stilted coming out himself, he would be back on the belief that Potter was just a massive homophobe and was disgusted by the thought of being gay. But knowing that Potter himself actually had relations with other men too? It was obvious. It was
at that - was a step too far for even a reformed death eater? But the amount of muggle things Malfoy had been getting right on board with lately had been shocking to say the least; something had changed within the blond in the three years he’d been in Azkaban, and Harry didn’t feel afraid to find out what anymore.
before he’d had a chance to interrogate Robards about the shitshow of his parole assignment. Poor Janice, couldn’t even get a word out before Harry was past her.
Draco pursed his lips at him, as if he was contemplating the secrets of the universe, rather than the very easy proposal of being Harry’s fake boyfriend.
‘Don’t be obtuse, dear. It’s an invitation, of course!’ Narcissa smirked at him. As much as Draco had spent his entire life (until he was sixteen, that is) looking up to and copying his father, it was his mother that he imitated most; it was a fact that P
‘Y’know, it sort of makes sense.’ He was tapping his chin and frowning slightly. ‘All those years of fighting. It’s like the muggles say, right, love? You only fight with people you fancy?’
‘You were so happy and at home, and I wanted that. I wanted it for you and I wanted to be a part of it. It wasn’t until I realised that, that I realised I’d been in love with you for months. I’d always known I was gay, and I know I never told you, but it was safer for me - for my heart - to never tell you, and never have to give you up.’
Hell, the most action he had got in the past year and a half was a horrific excuse for a “relationship” with Sam from the coffee shop (which had resulted in Harry having to find a new favourite coffee shop) and that kiss from Malfoy last night (which had resulted in a lot of confusion, frustration, nausea, and Malfoy running out of his flat).
‘WHAT! When else has this happened? And who?’ Potter interrupted. He had been pacing around the office but had whipped his head around to face Draco at that ol’ bombshell.
‘Right. Well. Good.’ Harry looks down to read the papers he has in front of him in an effort to not seem entirely like the idiot he knows he sounds like, but he doesn’t miss the slight twitch in the corners of Draco’s mouth.
And, for the first time since it had happened, Draco wasn’t alone and in prison when the anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts came around.
‘You could say that again.’ Tentative hands reached up to hold onto Harry’s arms. Looking up, he saw hurt and confusion and openness and… hope? in Draco’s eyes.
‘Alright. Thanks for not being a total prick.’ He cleared his throat. ‘Has your employment changed?’
In fact, Harry was in the middle of deciding between a green shirt (that just so happened to match his eyes) to put over a plain black t-shirt in an attempt at smart/casual, and just going for his classic oversized band t-shirt and his godfather’s old leather jacket, when his phone rang.
So they continued their easy intimacy, their fake relationship, on their weekly shops. Harry would pick out the veg with one hand, and keep a firm hold of Draco’s hand with the other.
Harry huffed at them both. ‘Right, well if you’re both just going to make fun then I won’t tell you all about
Draco could have murdered Patch. At least, he would have, if he hadn’t already been on parole for being a Death Eater and his parole officer hadn’t been standing right next to him.
said rival. No, it seemed that come tomorrow afternoon, the great Harry Potter would be making his way to Black Lotus Tattoos for his very own ink.
But Draco would know if Harry, one of his best friends since they’d met when they were eleven, fancied anyone, let alone him. Right?
was the git Harry knew and loved! Not the uneasy, wary, confused, and guarded parole charge he had been assigned, that flirted atrociously with him as a form of defence and self-preservation. Harry wasn’t quite sure how to deal with
Draco’s small smile widened into a grin that stretched across his entire face. It was a very unique grin, one that most people never saw, and Harry was immensely grateful for the knowledge that it was one he saw almost every time he saw Draco.
Was it too much for Harry to ask to find someone like that for himself? Sure, maybe he couldn’t fall in love with his best friend, they were both
‘Alright, alright,’ Harry raises his hands in submission, cheeks flaming, ‘But I did nothing that wasn’t encouraged thank you very much!’ But Harry was properly laughing with them both now. Yes, his love life had been a complete joke (and by that: non-existent) for the past three years. Yes, he hadn’t had a girlfriend - or boyfriend - since Ginny -
‘-BUT, I can kind of see where she’s coming from in a roundabout way, Ron. I hate the guy but he didn’t seem as much of an arse when he came in for the initial meeting, and I know out of everyone in the office I’ll be the one who’s least likely to put him on the next boat back to Azkaban-’
‘I look after him every Thursday evening so his grandmother can go to her book club. It’s no trouble really, he’s only three and I can put a film on and he goes straight to sleep.’ Harry was babbling now, but he couldn’t seem to stop. Maybe someone had slipped some Babbling Beverage into his tea? That must be the only explanation, ‘unless it’s
Draco had spotted the bookshop and, like Harry had predictably known he would, dragged Harry inside to look at each and every single book currently in stock. At least that’s what it felt like as Harry followed along behind him, not that he was going to complain.
enough marks from ol’ Voldy thank you very much, Harry felt like his body was covered in the scars of his war against him. It was high time he marked himself for a change.
But anyway, it wasn’t like Draco had any friends left to invite in the first place: they’d all made themselves scarce before the Wizengamot had even finished reading out his sentence.

‘Har har,’ Harry deadpanned, louder this time. ‘Bit difficult to do that when I have absolutely no interest in women whatsoever.’
shade of red, that it was almost worth the slew of butterflies that seem to have taken up a permanent residence in his stomach.
True, it had been somewhat strained in the weeks following his split with Ginny, and the family struggling to come to terms with a family unit without Fred after the war, but the Burrow would always be a home for him.
So really it was just Teddy and Andi keeping him going really, with their weekly Wednesday coffee meet ups. That and the weekly parole meetings he was having with Mal-
‘Draco, hey! Draco!’ Harry pushed through the crowds of people, doing his best not to spill what was left of his pint or anyone else’s drinks as he arrived by Draco’s side. ‘You made it.’
‘Not at all, I trust you’re experienced enough to do me properly?’ It was Malfoy’s turn to gulp this time, his eyes widened before schooling themselves back to a neutral.
If Malfoy hadn’t refused to identify him, Harry would be dead. He owed his own worst enemy a life debt now.
He’d had strong words with Kingsley and Robards about what had happened with Cormac McLaggan and Moira Thorpe last week, which thankfully they’d been just as outraged by, but it had still taken a full week to convince them to let Harry have his parole meetings outside of the ministry. Harry’s not saying he pulled the “Saviour of the Wizarding World” card for the first time in his career, but he also didn’t
‘Potter! Darling. Can’t say I didn’t miss you this week, cried myself to sleep when you didn’t call on Valentine’s.’ Draco marched into Potter’s office for the start of their meeting.
‘Oh, no. If I have to be named after one of them, I might as well have my own personal constellation to bring me luck and rain misery down onto my enemies.’
Harry sighed. So here he was: queueing up for coffee he didn’t want, in a shop he really didn’t want to be in, just to spend some time with his godson and Andi. What he
“Oh yes,” giggled Scorpius, “Dad always got himself submitted to St Mungo’s because of his work but nothing serious really.” He said, giving Harry a mysterious smile.
The green eyes sparkled brightly at him, apparently pleased that Harry understand the meaning behind his name. "Yes!"
“Hello.” He cautiously greeted back, glancing around to see delighted faces looking at him. Even Pansy and Blaise were there. He raised an eyebrow at them. The two usually locked up in their own dungeon, hence why Draco always hangs out with Potter's gang.
Henry's voice called and they turned to him simultaneously. The older man has already leant against the wall, assessing both of them with a bored look.
Albus sighed seeing his brother's expression, he can't help but softened, “I know, but we have to do this. Together.”
“Draco Malfoy,” said Potter softly, as he gave Draco a fond smile. “It's hard not to fall for you when you keep pursuing me like that! It's been hell for me not seeing you for almost a month, and it was all because of my stupid action!”
With that, the two small boys fell into a fit of laughter while the young adults were looking at them, horrified.
“Al, come here!” Scorpius whispered sharply and Albus scrambled to his leg in an instant, walking towards his brother with a quick pace.
Harry laughed, heart filled with fondness of this sweet creature who was currently sending daggers at his direction. Merlin, he couldn't believe this was the same person who wouldn't stop tormenting Harry every chance he got with his art of seduction, driving Harry into madness and leaving them both a huge mess by the time they were sated and exhausted. It was like learning a whole new personality of his husband, as the Draco he knew by the time they met again, was a confident Draco who did not bat an eye over any sexual innuendos. It was like falling in love all over again.
Draco sharply stared at the two boys. If earlier he felt as if the air sucked out of his lungs, right now he can't seem to breathe. As if it was an impossible thing to do.
By the time Harry and his friends arrived at the Great Hall, presents were already placed on the table of each house, bright and thoughtful and they were wrapped in their house's colour. The Slytherins were already there at their table, having their breakfast and Harry caught Draco’s eyes and was sent a wink as he walked to the Gryffindor's table.
It has been going on for weeks now. Most of the days he'd catch him on his usual tree, some was when he fell asleep in an empty class but always, always when he was alone. Even so, Harry's favourite would be those days when his culprit was being sneaky like the snake he is, where he'd catch him while he was around his friends.
Unable to see how to postpone the inevitable any longer, Harry began making his way down the corridor to his office. In a last ditch effort to not actually
The lower neckline of his t-shirt also meant that Malfoy’s prisoner identification number was on full view, but Harry tried very hard to look absolutely everywhere else instead. Neither of them needed (or wanted) to be reminded of that.
, had Liam and Draco been out before? Had Liam orchestrated this to win Draco back somehow? How could Harry compete with that?
, first and foremost, and if ever there was a rule Harry wouldn’t break, that was it. Highly unprofessional. And if he wanted to make Head Auror by the time he was thirty five like Robards and Kingsley and the whole of wizarding Britain expected him to, he needed to keep his head down, his nose clean, and nowhere near the temptations of Draco Malfoy.
Schooling his features back into his dissociated Malfoy Mask, Draco cleared his throat and put his still half full glass of fire whiskey back onto the coffee table. It was only once Malfoy rose to his feet and began striding across the room to the fireplace that Potter stopped laughing.
Sitting down into the chair, Harry stretched his left arm out onto the rest next to him, wrist up. Malfoy also sat, on his stool, gathering the equipment he needed before fixing Harry with his steely eyes.
‘Harry.’ Hermione put her hand over his in an attempt to calm down his increasingly erratic behaviour. ‘First of all, it’s not exactly a secret that you can be a little bit oblivious sometimes. Second, he was scared to lose your friendship. Having you
‘You can go in now Mister Potter,’ Janice smirked at him over her nail file. It took everything Harry had not to succumb to his childish impulses and stick his tongue out at her. He was an Auror now. An adult.
brought them to an all new level of crazy that most definitely did not come from the Malfoy side of the family (after all, crazy Aunt Bella didn’t get
He remembered him from the robe shop on his eleventh birthday. Malfoy hadn’t been too bad then - if a little stuck-up - but Harry had been treated like dirt enough to know it was the right thing to stick up for others being treated like dirt.
‘I’m just worried about the heart attack this fried food may give me. It wouldn’t look too good if the Chosen One can’t keep his death eater alive and well before he officially finishes training, would it?’
‘Okay. No meeting today - sorry - but I’ve got something I need to do. I’m going to sort this out, Malfoy, I promise you!’ Potter was almost skipping as he left his office, bouncing along the halls of the ministry with enough energy to kill ten Dark Lords. Draco didn’t know where he stored it all.
of her crazy from Azkaban). That being said, the more Narcissa paced the tiny kitchen and rambled to herself about how much of an opportunity this was, the more Draco felt inclined to agree with her. After his treatment in Azkaban, it was no surprise to him that the rest of the Aurors would still see him as nothing more than a filthy Death Eater, just like his father, and loyal servant to the Dark Lord. Potter was the only one who would give him the benefit of the doubt, and try to get him through his probation period with as little disruption as possible. He had even been the one in the meeting to request that
“Right,” He clasped his hands together and and forced a smile, “Looks like we have no choice but to ask Harry Potter for help.”
"Ah, yes." agreed Seamus, annoyingly draped himself around Harry. "Saw it myself, it was pretty wicked."
Since when he has developed this kind of feeling towards Malfoy, he doesn't know. He didn't dare to put any assumptions of what kind of feeling he was having. He took the comfort that perhaps, this time around, Malfoy and him can build a better relationship; like friends, maybe.
Both Albus and Scorpius promptly turn their gaze at their father. He looked rather shocked, speechless, and seemed to be unable to utter any words apart from having his wild gaze on them.
“Of course,” said a small haughty voice all of a sudden, “Merlin forbids Harry Potter to keep secrets from his friends.”
"Good morning to you too." replied Malfoy, bringing both of his hands to rest it on his lap, and Harry immediately felt warm spreading through his cheek knowing that Malfoy probably has woken up to their intertwined hands, and making no fuss about it.
Harry gaped, skin tingling from where the soft lips has touched and he stupidly watched as Malfoy smirked at him, grey eyes twinkling teasingly before he straightened up for the second time and turned around to walk straight to the door as he called, "Contact me anytime you want, till then, don't bother me."
Both of them sat next to each other at the park a couple of blocks away from his apartment. It was a beautiful day for a Sunday morning when Potter unexpectedly showed up in front of his door, ready with a basket of foods and a blinding smile. “I hope you like an outdoor breakfast!” He had said.
‘Sorry, mate. I won’t be coming here any more. I’ll see you around if you ever venture up to George’s shop.’
.’ Harry smirked, if Malfoy was going to play it that way, Harry wasn’t above sinking to the same level.
But when said snooty gaze is coming from the eyes of the man who kissed you last week, a fact which Harry had successfully managed to ignore up until this silence, it suddenly became a whole lot more awkward.
’d Potter whilst they both sat there. Draco would get the blame for that no doubt. But why was Potter telling him about his godson?
the days Harry would be too busy to remember lunch, but brought some for him anyway and forced him to eat it with a small kiss to the top of his head.
‘Alright… it was those arseholes McLaggan and Thorpe down the hall. I don’t suppose you know the counter jinx, do you? Only I’d quite like to sit down.’
‘How many dirty things do you reckon they all think I’ve whispered to you already, then?’ Harry forced himself not to jump at the sensation of Draco’s breath on his ear lobe.
‘Look, why don’t we go into the cafe. Sit down, maybe have a hot drink before you tell me all your darkest secrets? If you even want to, you don’t, really.’
It also had a great deal of music (if one could even call those heinous sounds “music”) which baby Edward had absolutely
Ron, who had taken an unfortunately timed sip of his drink, promptly spat it straight back out again over the table and Harry.
Harry snuck another glance at Malfoy, but he couldn’t quite decide how he felt at seeing the blond so genuinely happy at his cousin dancing along to muggle songs in a muggle film.
Harry looked over at Charlie in the dusk. He could see his eyes shining too; everything was feeling soft and nostalgic in the early evening, helped along by the numerous butterbeers and fire whiskeys everyone had been supplied with all afternoon. Harry opened his mouth to speak, but the sudden, harsh yellow light of the open back door interrupted him.
‘Well are you going to tell me how the meeting went, or am I supposed to start guessing for myself?’
Draco could feel Potter staring at him, Merlin knows he’d got enough practise at Hogwarts to know when he was being stared at. Turning back around to smirk at the other man, his suspicions were confirmed by the small frown on his face, but it was a look that wasn’t entirely displeased, and wasn’t
!’ that he didn’t think Harry had heard. It was odd, Harry had said that he was free the whole day and wanted to spend some time with Draco, where had this mystery “thing” come from? Was he just trying to get away from him?
Wincing slightly at the sudden cold fingers at his wrist, Harry drew in a sharp breath and tore his attention back to where the blond head, previously bowed in deep concentration, had snapped up at the sound of Harry’s pain.
‘Potter, for the love of Merlin, why are you telling me?’ Draco finally managed to get a word in edgeways to Potter’s babbling. Maybe they’d both been drinking Babbling Beverage?
Grumbling as he made his way to the Auror department, Harry scolded himself for not remembering to leave enough time to grab a to-go cup of coffee from his favorite coffee shop before work. Mondays were shit enough, but Mondays
yet - his first magical tattoo. Two weeks since Draco had acknowledged he found Potter attractive, since he’d realised he was maybe slightly attracted to Potter. Two weeks of his most impressive flirting techniques as a way to try and ignore that his feelings were maybe a little bit more sincere than he wanted to admit. Getting a rise out of Potter was familiar territory, he felt comfortable in it. It was, arguably, the source of the better memories of his time at Hogwarts.
‘Yeah, well, it’s not like it’s the first time, and they’re not the only ones. I’m a death eater, Potter, I’m sure they’re well within their-’
‘Hey, Draco!’ Harry pulled him in for a hug. When he pulled back, Draco looked a little confused but both men shook it off.
‘You’re in love with Draco! Have been for a few years now, just like he has. Only we’ve been waiting for you to realise you like men. Draco had the advantage there, he came out to all of us at some point in eighth year.’ She winced at that, and at Harry’s astonished reaction. ‘Told us not to tell you.’
‘Harry, hey!’ Draco turned and grinned at him, and Harry was struck, as always, at just how beautiful Draco was.
‘Right! So, our Harry here, and the blond ferrety git known as Draco Malfoy,’ he gave a dramatic shudder, ‘have been using fights all these years to cover up the attraction. Correct?’
Potter, however, was not amused. ‘Come on, Teddy. It’s late and Grandma Andi will be mad at both of us if I let you stay up any longer.’
Draco was frowning, why was he babbling like this? Did someone slip some Babbling Beverage into his tea? And what did he care if the Chosen One was on a date?
‘Perfectly, Potter. What about darling young Edward here?’ Draco lent down to poke a couple of tickles into Edward’s side and was rewarded with peels of laughter from his baby cousin.
‘It’s like I said Head Auror Robards: if you want me to be an Auror then you have to put me through the same training as every other person applying for the same job. I won’t be treated any differently just because of a scar on my forehead and a lucky shot with a disarming spell.’ Harry replied, just as calmly as the first (and second, and third, and fifteenth) time he had explained his decision over the past couple of weeks.
‘Just go to sleep, Draco. You’d better hope Mister Potter doesn’t hold anything against you.’ Narcissa pinched the bridge of her nose, no doubt to get rid of the headache Draco had given her. To be fair to her, he’d be doing the same if he had to deal with himself right now. ‘Although I supposed we’ll see on Sunday.’
Eyes that now seemed doomed to pop up and follow him around for the rest of his life, no matter where he went.
Instead, he went for the much safer (although much less satisfying) approach of thinking through a selection of rather colourful expletives to describe his supposed “best friend”. His “best friend” that could apparently read him like a book no matter how many shields or layers of masks that he put up.
, had he really been that oblivious the whole time? ‘Do you remember the first Christmas I was invited to spend it with you all at the Burrow?’
? What kind of question was that, Draco wondered. Did Potter mean today specifically? In the past week? Since their kiss? During Azkaban? During the war? He was going to have to narrow it down a bit. But still, proper pureblood protocol was still deeply embedded into his reactions to social interactions, and he replied with an equally cordial - if not, slightly strained - ‘I’ve been perfectly well, thank you, Potter.’
Obviously seeing his confusion, Draco continued. ‘I thought they might ask you out, idiot! They winked at you? Were you not looking?’
‘Right. Well, thanks anyway. And I don’t know what else P said to you but I guess you know who he is now?’ Potter nodded. ‘Right, so yeah. I’d appreciate it if you didn’t try and get to the bottom of all my trauma yourself. That’s what I don’t pay P for. And, not to be rude,’ he waggled a finger between them, gesturing to them both, ‘but you and I? We’re not friends.’
All too soon - or not soon enough - the film was over and Teddy had fallen asleep on the sofa between them.
Some potential personal discomfort and occasional nightmare triggers were to be expected, right? Completely normal… Right?
He gave a short, sharp bark of laughter and took another large sip of his drink. Ron just looked at him over the booth table, one hand still holding onto his own seemingly forgotten pint, and gave a small sigh.
best friends. You’re both going to be the best parents and this baby will be so loved. I’m so happy for you both. Cheers!’
It seemed to be that Potter was uncomfortable being here in Draco’s company. Draco wasn’t enjoying it, yes, but he wasn’t uncomfortable to say the least, merely bored. Perhaps there was some fun to be had here?
‘Bold of you to assume you’re my favourite, Harry, but I’m actually on my fifteen. So it was lucky timing from you arriving when you did really.’
Harry and Draco were walking down the hill from the bus stop towards the high street. They were finally alone, finally not stuck revising for chemistry, finally not stuck singing karaoke badly. Finally, Harry hoped, heading towards this being an actual date.
, but seeing as you did not see fit to listen the first time, I suppose I must; I am the newest artist at Black Lotus Tattoos.’
M- Draco’s eyes widened ever so slightly at that, before snapping over to Patch and fixing him with a glare. ‘I told you that little pet name in private, P.’
hello! pls enjoy my first explorations into creative writing and leave nice encouraging comments so I don't worry about how terrible a writer I am all the time loool
‘That’s what the toys are for, silly! What sort of grandmother do you take me for? I came prepared!’
‘I don’t want to lose you, either. I think I’m going to go to my room now, if you can help me into bed.’ Draco’s voice was very quiet now. So quiet it was almost scary.
‘Saturday night? Do you have nothing better to do with your Saviour social life?’ Malfoy was smirking at him again. It was starting to really piss Harry off.
The words were out before Harry even realised what he said, or how they could be misconstrued, but it was too late.
Walking up the back path now, Draco could see how his mother had fallen in love with the quaintness of the place; the tiny rooms, the soft corners and gentle furnishings, the huge windows at the back of the house, letting in more light than could have ever been seen in the manor. It was Narcissa Black to a tee.
Potter lost some of his air at that, letting out a breath of what seemed like an entire lung. ‘You’re not worthless, or evil, or a piece of dirt. And you might have the mark but you were never a death eater, Malfoy.’ He was speaking in a tiny voice now. ‘I had no idea this had been happening.’
‘Harry!’ Hermione scolded him How can you have let this happen! You had a level of responsibility as Draco’s parole officer to make sure he feels safe in your office and you don’t abuse that trust.’
And Harry truly was happy for her. He knew how it felt to be stuck with no family (or, no family worth mentioning, anyway), and as much as the Malfoy name wasn’t worth a knut anymore, Narcissa and Draco were Blacks by blood, and had just as much claim to the name as Andi did as a Tonks.
Harry watched in disbelief as Hermione’s hand moved down to cup her stomach. Both Hermione’s and Ron’s eyes were shining.
‘Err, I mean, well I have.. Training you know? Not that I’m not - er - capable, this is weird, what was the question?’
‘Alright, Mione, you win,’ Harry conceded eventually, ‘but that doesn’t mean I’ll be nice to the git!’
Draco turned to look at him, a vaguely amused smile on his face. ‘Your treat? My, my, Potter, who knew you had all this chivalry in you? I’ll have to get the next round then.’
He was the Saviour, the Boy Who Lived to Kill the Dark Lord, it was programmed into his existence via said famous scar to be a dark wizard catcher.
The left forearm was also the place Voldemort had chosen for his Dark Mark, so Harry tattooing himself with images of the ones he loved seemed like one last “
And the more they drank, the closer they got; fire whiskey removing all forms of inhibitions and social barriers. Potter was flailing his arms around telling some story about Edward changing his hair colour in the middle of Potter doing a food shop, and the subsequent emergency obliviating he’s had to do.
The biggest change, though, had been Draco. Because he was Draco even among muggles now, never to be Malfoy again.
And then, of course, there were their usual weekly flatmate chores of food shops and household errands. Trips to Tesco for food and M&S for Percy Pigs that Draco loved more than any Pureblood, ex-blood purist, ex-death eater ever should. And the way that Draco always,
Andromeda Tonks smiled fondly at Harry, as a grandmother would smile at her grandchildren, or a certain stern Scottish professor would smile at her unruly, rulebreaking house members. When he looked up, Harry broke into the widest smile he’d managed in two weeks.
coffee shop was one of Harry’s favourites. It had huge windows that let in all the light, beautiful natural wood table tops, and the best coffee this side of Beauxbatons. The coffee bar itself boasted a white granite top and a black and white checkered tile wall. The shelves were made from the same natural wood as the table tops and were stuffed full of bags of coffee, various loose leaf teas, and an abundance of cups and saucers (none of which matched). There were two espresso coffee machines, pour overs, filters, hot water boilers, all in a wonderful uniform of copper that sparkled out at you, as freshly polished as the day they all arrived. And this is all without mentioning the plants that seemed to cover every single available surface in the whole joint.
‘Attack in Diagon Alley, mate. Robards wants us to go.’ Ron poked his head around Harry’s office door.
In this chapter we find out more of what happened to Draco in Azkaban, and the horrors that he was subjected to. I, thankfully, have no personal experience with this myself other than a few instances of minor catcalling/harassment/above the clothes groping before I was old enough to realise the true extent of how horrific this behaviour is, so in the whole of this story I WILL NOT go into masses of detail.
‘Good.’ Draco affirmed. He reached over to his side table for a cloth and wiped away the excess ink coming from Potter’s wrist.
It had taken Harry by surprise at first, seeing Draco look so natural and normal in a muggle setting, way back when they’d first got a flat together. Ron had joined them back then, taking up what would become Draco’s personal library. Because the git
Teddy ran up to join hands with Harry again, and his heart swelled at the pure joy that was on his godson’s face.
The County Arms, Ron and Hermione’s local, was a quaint looking muggle pub tucked away in the depths of their burrow in Notting Hill. In fact, it was so tucked away that Harry was sure most of Notting Hill didn’t even know that it was there. It was small and cosy, and had twinkling lights strung up around the ceiling year-round which gave it a decidedly christmassy feel even in the highest heats of summer, and it wasn’t known to anyone else in the wizarding world other than the three people currently sat in one of the squishy corner booths.
‘I’m not saying it’ll be easy, and you wouldn’t have believed me anyway if I’d tried to. I just don’t want you to lose hope that there
‘Come on, Malfoy. Teddy wants you to stay, I want you to stay. So stay.’ Potter’s green eyes flickered up at him, filled with caution, longing, hope.
With a click, Malfoy hung up the phone and turned around. Shock filled his eyes as he caught sight of Harry, quickly displaced by wariness. But
‘Right. Here you go.’ He handed over the coins. ‘Thanks… Eddie, was it? See you Friday Malfoy.’ Potter gave a small smile at Draco before turning to leave.
There was no kissing allowed unless initiated by Draco, and only then was it to be on the cheek or the top of the head - it was one of the many rules Draco had set to feel even moderately comfortable with it all. Harry hadn’t minded, but seeing Draco all loose-limbed and glowing under the pub lights was doing strange things to Harry’s inhibitions, and he knew if they’d been alone on the dancefloor, anything could’ve happened. Draco was his
Of course, it didn’t take long until Harry could feel Draco’s breathing get slower, and hear tiny little snores coming up from him. The beautiful blond git had fallen asleep.
Let it be known that Narcissa Malfoy was not one to be rendered speechless by just anything, her upbringing and good breeding had seen to it that there was always the perfect response, perfect retort, brewing away in her mind. It’s what made her such a skilled conversationalist at dinner parties for all those years.
Draco and Harry, who had both just taken sips of their drinks to avoid looking at each other, simultaneously began to choke on them. Patch let out a bark of laughter as he walked away from them.
Signing, Draco sat down on the stool. He’d been working at the Black Lotus ever since his release from Azkaban months ago, at the suggestion from his first parole officer from, unsurprisingly, the same pamphlet Potter had handed over in
‘It would be a bit counter-productive of me to be homophobic don’t you think? I wouldn't want to muddy your memories of me from school too much but I’m not the complete idiot you loved to believe I am.’
, Harry chuckled - he pointed at the bar and mimed to show he was going to get a drink before making his way over.
for Merlin’s sake. Had done for the past seven years! It would’ve been weird if they hadn’t had some sort of casual, platonic intimacy by now. Harry knew exactly how Draco liked his tea to be made; what his hair looked like in the morning; how he would stay up all night and drive himself slightly crazy when he came up with new ideas for potion experiments. How he would let Harry hold him as he cried if the experiments didn’t work.
‘What, really?’ Draco’s eyes flew up to Harry’s face, but something in his expression must have set off some sort of alarm. ‘Absolutely not, whatever it is. I know that face. The answer is no.’
Harry couldn’t stop his mind from racing through it all. From stealing glances at Draco when he wasn’t looking - and when he was, which made Harry want to crawl into a hole and never be seen again.
It was following yet another of these games that Harry found himself back at the Burrow for a celebration afterwards, cradling a butterbeer and surrounded by a sea of redheads and freckles and raucous laughter.
Harry cast an eye around Robards’ office, taking in the books, the wall full of meticulously organised cases files, the few scattered instruments that Harry recognised as the same types of dark wizard detectors as Mad-Eye Moody had stuffed his office with during Harry’s fourth year.
‘Do tell me you actually know what you’re doing here Potter? My liberated life is quite literally on the line here and I hate to think that your hands aren’t capable of the job.’
‘… and so, of course, mother and I decided that it was high time to change our names legally. Put the whole Malfoy line and its reputation behind us and start fresh.’ Well if
‘I was, erm, babysitting. If you must know. My godson.’ Potter said, looking a little confused. If Draco didn’t know any better he’d think someone had snuck in and
Excusing himself, Harry made for the back kitchen door, to sit on the step and cool his ruddied cheeks on the early summer breeze. He managed to enjoy it for all of five minutes before his peace was, inevitably in the Burrow, interrupted.
-convict he was now responsible for was sitting just feet away. He felt sick. He could hear Hermione in his head, an odd combination of chastising him and spurring him on;
‘Do you treat all your paying customers like this? I can take my business elsewhere,’ Harry glared back and made to leave. Fortunately for them both, the man who was obviously the owner or manager or whoever had the misfortune of being in charge of Malfoy burst into the room to stop Harry from leaving.
Harry thought about how nice it had been the last few months, taking Draco lunch from his favourite places and seeing him smile as he surprised him at work. Seeing Draco in a good mood on the days Harry sent him flowers, and the deep satisfaction that Harry was the one that caused it. Being spoilt by Draco in return, with boxes of his favourite sweets and chocolate getting delivered to his office. The way that Draco just
It was also two weeks since he’d got his little Prongslet, his little stag tattoo on his wrist, which had taken to cantering up and down his arm at all hours of the day. Harry couldn’t even get annoyed at his constant awareness of it moving around thanks to the tickling sensation that occurred whenever it moved, as it obviously meant that the stag was happy making a nuisance of itself on his arm.
The night went on. The conversation flowed on and Harry nursed his butterbeers and his fire whiskeys, trying to concentrate on the names and details of people in the stories that Dean and Seamus spun around and around in circles around his head. He had a vague awareness of Ron, sat awkwardly, reminding Harry of how he’d looked every time Oliver Wood had tried to give a pep talk before a quidditch game. He turned to give him his attention, certain that he could see something bubbling away just below the surface, something that needed the slightest
to be Earl Grey! And none of that “own brand” shite. It always tastes like dishwater. Pick me up a box of that Twining's.’)
‘Are you sure? You’re not looking for Weasley’s place? You didn’t get lost on your way? Malfoy sneered, and Harry tried very hard not to visibly relax; a Malfoy sneer was familiar territory, something he knew he could deal with.
Draco hummed in response and (thankfully) leant backwards into his own seat a bit more. ‘I’ll count my lucky constellation that I get to see it now then.’
‘It’s not sex, it’s a date’ Ron states, leaning back onto his heels matter-of-fact in his assessment. After so many years joined at the hip, Ron and Harry had developed a pretty accurate way of reading each other so completely without a single word. It pissed Hermione off to no end, but it was the closest Harry had ever felt to being a true Legilimens without ever actually attempting any proper training after the farce that had been lessons with Snape in his fifth year. Harry respected the man, after what he had seen of his memories during the Battle of Hogwarts, but Severus Snape should never have pretended to be an Occlumency teacher (Ron even favoured the theory that Snape had been
Tossing a few galleons onto the table to cover the drink, Harry stood and left the coffeehouse, and resolutely decided that he simply could not go any further with his day without informing Tweedle Dum of his brand new, shiny date.
, and Draco was currently piling them, along with a tonne of flashcards, onto the table around their drinks.
‘It’s fine, Draco, honestly. I couldn’t decide which shirt to wear anyway,’ Harry gave a small, self-deprecating laugh. Draco joined in, but it sounded much more genuine than Harry’s ego could take at that moment.
‘Don’t act so innocent, Potter. This has always happened. Ever since the trials. Every time I set foot in the ministry, someone comes up, wand blazing, and let’s me know exactly how much of a worthless, evil piece of dirt death eater I am. It's why I'm always late.’
‘Sorry, I came as quickly as I could. You know what it’s like trying to leave the office for lunch.’ Hermione sat down in the chair opposite Harry and took a sip of the coffee he’d ordered her. She must have sensed Harry’s panicked stare, because her calm, contented, coffee-sipping look became one of worry as she looked up at him.
‘Actually, Harry, there’s something we wanted to ask you.’ Hermione put down her lemonade and looked from a nodding Ron to a confused Harry. ‘We wanted to ask you if you’d be our baby’s godfather.'
‘Well, I have an obligation on Saturday evenings - a family thing - if that’s the only day you can do we can work around it.’
it when I’m a git to you.’ Ma-Draco smirked at him, his voice all low and sultry. Harry rolled his eyes in response, angling his head down so that the heat on his face wouldn’t be visible.
‘I accept your apology, but you’re not forgiven.’ Sam went to interrupt, his face the perfect picture of the jilted ex-boyfriend, not that they’d even reached that stage, but Harry carried on over him. ‘You hurt me, Sam. I trusted you and you threw that away. I thought you might have been able to see past the lies the
Draco blinked. That was a new one, and it succeeded in distracting him completely from all internal Potter musings. Was the Ministry having issues with some of the old crowd? Were they not all locked up nice and tight in Az-
‘Eloquent as always, Potter. Though I must say, I thought you’d have learnt how to string a sentence together by now,’ Malfoy smirked.
away or else he might start having flashbacks and panic attacks and he wasn’t about to go ruining the hardened criminal reputation he’d been trying to build up around Potter for the past four months.
Double checking for karaoke nights at every pub in the city, Harry managed to find an evening where none of them had
‘Harry? Please say something. This is why I never wanted to go along with your stupid fake “relationship” plan. But, instead, I was selfish, wanting to pretend like it was as real for you as it was for me. I never should’ve given in so easily.’ Tears were falling down Draco’s face. ‘I understand if you want nothing more to do with me. If you want me to move out.’
"You found out about the curse years after he gave birth, and his magic collapsed then. What about when you said it finally took a toll on him?"
Harry watches as Ron and Parkinson carefully help Malfoy up to his feet, and Harry quickly hold up a hand. “Ron, you and Parkinson need to follow Hermione as witnesses. Malfoy, you come with me.”
Potter shook his head vigorously, panic written in his eyes. “Not like that! I just, I just like having you around.” He said lamely.
Together, they gathered the possessions in a center, making sure everything was in place before they stood facing each other in between the piles. “Wands ready?”
Henry rolled his eyes in annoyance, “Merlin, I didn't know I was such a- ah, anyway, I don't know what got you so worked up. It's not like it was you that I was touching.”
Harry's heart jumped at that, mind hastily working as he tried to recall anything that was informed to him. "I- I think Hermione did mention it, but it's really hard for me to pay attention."
Draco found himself walking into a dark alley, eyes dropped onto the pair in an instant just in time to see them leaning to each other intimately with desire painted on both of their faces. Draco smirked, extending his left hand to his front and silently summoned his golden bow, right hand already holding an arrow.
“Actually,” said Scorpius, giving Draco a sheepish smile, rubbing his nose discreetly. “We found the book in your study room.”
He doubled his speed when he saw the door of the Great Hall, mind was set on the other side of the door that he almost broke his nose when it was abruptly opened right in his face. He stumbled forward, hands desperately searched for something just to prevent him from kissing the floor with his face and for a moment he was glad when his hand caught something that was apparently shouted in surprise when Harry pulled it towards him.
“I'm pretty sure you won't be here if you were not Harry Potter's sons.” McGonagall pointed out, and Albus broke into a fit of giggles that got a smile from Scorpius.
“Let me finish first!” stated Malfoy, throwing his gaze to the blank faces around him, Harry included.
Scorpius immediately adjusted himself to Harry, again as if he's been doing it for a long time already. He put his head on Harry's chest as he commented, “It's going to take a while, isn't it?”
"I'm sorry." Henry took a desperate breath, wiping away the tears formed around his eyes. "Oh dear, I understand why Draco used to hate you so much. Godric! It was so bad to hear it from someone else, now I have to see it myself!"
Harry, who was currently rummaging through his own rucksack, nodded in acknowledgement, though he mentally relieved that he did not put any suspicious items - that could have risked revealing his identity - in the rucksack. "Thank you for doing that. I really forgot about it altogether, what's with seeing you and dealing with everything."
She braced herself and took a deep breath and closed her eyes when things around the room started to rattles and felt the sudden energy of a powerful magic burst throughout the space, just enough to make her grip on her table tightly.
Draco sighed heavily. Looks like he can throw away his plan to avoid Potter out to Hogwarts’ window. He was definitely not going to ruin his sons’ plan and if he had to speak to Potter, he won't think twice about it.
“If you think the Slytherins were up to something, you were right.” Dean jumped in, holding up a hand when Seamus tried to protest. “I think they were up to mending back the houses together, Merlin knows how much the war has broken us.”
Draco Malfoy was not the typical man when he developed a crush on someone. He was not the type to admire them from afar, or just probably sighed in content when their crush walked by or simply existed. He was not the type of person who would get shy when their crush simply looked at them or sat next to them. No, he was not that type of person.
“-which of course meant something.” Parkinson continued, wiggling her brows. “Don't you think so, Potter?” She looked at him with an expectant look, followed by the others.
It has been a year and a half since that crushing has been going on. One would say it was already way beyond a crush. Pansy stated that according to psychologists, a crush can only last for four months, but when the feelings persist beyond that, one was considered to be “in love”. Draco had snorted when he heard that. He was not in love with Harry Potter. Love was such a strong feeling, and for Draco to be in love with someone, that was just simply ridiculous.
The four Gryffindors and the two Slytherins have been on their separated way after they left papa's room, and naturally, they have followed their dad to the Gryffindor tower, claiming they were tired when they arrived at the common room, aware that the attention was instantly on them the moment they stepped inside the portrait hole. Their dad agreed, and led them to his shared room whilst his three friends waited in the common room to have more discussion as aunt Hermione had said. Albus repressed a grin when he saw uncle Ron's mortified face, poor him.
Harry smiled, he remembered the proud feeling burst out in his chest when Ginny and Dean uttered the words bravely. He carefully reached out and took the pale hand into his, there's a few tiny scratches decorating the skin and Harry has to restrained himself from tracing his finger against the wounded skin.
Draco waste no time as he quickly approaches the scene when one of the witches turns and cries out in relief when she sees him. “Mr. Malfoy!”
“It's because I had enough that I did all of this.” Malfoy says in gritted teeth, face still facing the window. “You don't know what happened out there ever since that son of dick came.” He balls his hand into a tight fist as he gives Harry a nasty sneer. “You sit in this bloody office all the time!”
A silly smile bloomed upon his face once the thought dawned on him. His culprit, the person who has been spending his free time kissing him mysteriously in his own cunning way turned out to be the person he harboured feelings with.
They were basically the same person, identical from the bottom to the top; a sole person. So it wouldn't make sense for Harry to harbour a crush on Draco when he was right there in front of Harry, always been. Why can't he look at him the same way he looked at Draco?
“Perhaps it was because you were the only one in this room who's actually a virgin?” She Weasley piped up, uncertain.
Before he could even defend himself, a mist of black suddenly appeared inside the camp, halting their banter, and they watched as the mist turned into Ron, who quickly found Harry's eyes and nodded.
He immediately brought his eyes back to Harry and shook like a leaf when he saw Harry smirked wickedly. A flash of red appeared in his green eyes for a moment, easily breaching through Draco’s magic as he revoked his Invisible Charm. Draco hitched a breath when he saw his body turned visible, fingers apparently clutching onto Harry's shirt.
His voice sound as if he was in pain, and longing at the same time that somehow it hurts Draco when Henry bowed down to hide his face. Draco bit his lips, bending down to carefully cradled the older man's face and tilted his head up to face him.
Draco shrugged, nonchalant. “Nothing, just wondering if you somehow consider me as your love interest now.”
They nodded at that, and Harry can't help but stole a glance at Malfoy. The way he concentrated on his task, exchanging words with Hermione. He really did work hard for his twins and promptly reminded that Malfoy was the type of person who would do anything for his family.
Malfoy cleared his throat, smoothing down his robe in the most awkward way, as if he doesn't know what to do with his hands. “I need to speak with Potter. It's urgent.”
“We have a theory that there might be a possibility that the curse might've been casted on you since after the war.” explained Henry, as he turned serious. “The healer said that the curse has been slowly poisoning your blood for a long time but we haven't got the real timeline of when the curse was casted. However, there was a huge possibility that someone may have casted them on you around this timeline."
He watched in glee as the arrow made its way straight towards oblivious Harry who had his eyes on Ginevra, giddy to see it landed on the young man.
Somehow, they managed to fall into a civil conversation, asking the twins questions about their family and the future while the twins answered then in the most mischief way they could be without revealing anything.
"I will," promised Draco. "The front gate of the Palace will open on its own once the last Horcrux is destroyed. I will see you there."
"Exactly, mate." said Ron, stepping forward to slap Harry's shoulder but hit Seamus' arms instead as they were draped around Harry's shoulder. He ignored the cries from the Irishman as he gave him a determined look. "Go and get him."
He saw curious eyes watch his movement, and he ignored them, as he took a purpose stride straight towards oblivious Malfoy, heartbeat increasing as he got closer and gave Malfoy's friends a thankful smile as they kept talking to him as if nothing was happening, and saw as Pansy urged him to drink, taking his food away in the process. Despite the mild protest, Malfoy did as told, unaware of Harry who had stood right behind Malfoy, and the whispers that erupted around them. Pansy gave a nod when Malfoy put down his cup, and with a sudden force of bravery, Harry tapped Malfoy's shoulder twice.
Draco scoffed, managing to cross his arms even as he was laying down the bed. "Well, I don't feel like I want to know something, so you can take your arm away."
“Do you know why I was sitting in this ‘bloody’ office all day?” Harry asks, looking up as Draco shakes his head. “I had to work on Dixon previous disciplinary files from his previous school, so that I can have a concrete evidence to expel him from Hogwarts. Today's incident can be a strong point to expel him.”
Seeing as he was alone now, he decided to wait for his friends on his bed. He pulled out the Marauder's Map that was slipped under his pillow, and spread it open. "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good." He quickly recited and tapped his wand on it, eyes immediately sought Malfoy's name and smiled once he found it. Seemed like Madam Promfey was doing her morning check up on her only patient. His eyes suddenly caught the movement of two dots getting closer towards Malfoy and quickly reminded himself to ask them about the white-blond haired man later on.
"I almost lost my mind when I found out about it. If it wasn't for Hermione, I might not even be here." shared Harry, stripping off his clothes and quickly changed into his joggers and t-shirt.
Automatically, Draco sought a hand to caress their heads gently by turn. “Yes, I don't want to leave them alone.”
Draco couldn't help but smirked approvingly. He has been keeping his eyes on her from the moment she stepped into the place; her personal information has already imprinted behind his eyelids as he has finished reading her profile just before he entered the place half an hour before her and just by watching her, Draco had the feeling that this would be an interesting assignment.
Thinking back, everything he did will always strayed towards Malfoy by the end of the day. Merlin, he defeated Voldermort with Malfoy's wand, and let's be honest; despite everything that has happened, he'll take Malfoy in anytime if they were given a chance.
They both promptly look at Potter, who watched them in confusion. Draco blinked as he gave the man a brief smile, “Yes?”
“I need a moment.” said Draco, holding up a finger as he continued to look up at Potter's agitated face.
Potter suddenly huffed, and reached out a hand to pull Draco towards him, and place a kiss to his cheek instead.
“Well, where are you boys staying? I'm tired, these travelling things wore me out.” said Henry, yawning widely.
He shared an amused smile with Pansy, and reached out to swipe the white-blond hair away from covering his green eyes. “May I know what for?”
“Okay, come on now! We're late!” Granger suddenly came and rescued Draco from his stupefaction, gaping stupidly at the grinning Potter who waved them happily as Granger led them away.
"He is," nodded Scorpius, before giving his brother a disapproval look. "But that doesn't mean it gave you an excuse to be rude to him."
Potter ignored his comments, but gave him a slight glare before he rubbed his face down. “Will you still hang out with us?”
A breeze of whispers suddenly touched Harry's lips sending tingles to his entire body, and he had to repress a gasp that was about to form.
The twins may be denying it all they want, but with those sly looks, and knowing smirks, going to Harry for comfort when Malfoy got mad, and making themselves at home around Harry- he looked down in time to see Scorpius slipping his hand around Harry's arm and Albus somehow managed to gravitate his way and find a spot next to Harry now, getting himself comfortable.
“Dad took this for us!” said Albus, and Scorpius nodded, “Dad loves to take our picture, there's so many of them at home!”
They went to class like usual after that, and Harry unconsciously sought for the empty seat of Malfoy in every class they shared, feeling like something was lacking with the absence of the other male.
It was a very sweet gesture, melting down Draco’s heart if it's not already for this beautiful man. Potter has been really kind to him lately, and he needed to know his agenda.
“And by sheer dumb luck, trust and faith, the both of you decided to travel back in time without thinking of the danger and the consequences of your action.”
“Henry.” Malfoy warned, making the older man to huffed in irritation and Harry throw a smug face. “Potter, you too.”
Draco squinted his eyes at the twins, not quite believing but his heart at ease when he heard it. “Are you sure?”
He was woken up by kisses earlier that morning with a fresh looking Draco who already had his uniform on, ready to start the day. He let Draco dragged him back to the Gryffindor tower, left Harry in front of the portrait with a kiss and promised that they'll see each other on breakfast.
“Let's go home, Draco!” She slurred, clearly drunk her arse. Draco sighed, as he rubbed his temple. Another heavy weight suddenly falls on his back, choking him into nothing.
Malfoy sighed at the both of them, pinching the bridge of his nose before he straightened up and regards Harry. “Now, Potter. May I know why you are here?”
‘Wha.. oh, erm, yeah. Fine.’ Harry cleared his throat and tried to not make his heavy breathing so obvious. ‘What’s up, are you running late?’
. He’d had enough of that from Patch and his mother, he didn’t need it from Harry fucking Potter, too.
And if they didn’t strictly need to hold hands in the muggle world, well, Harry told himself that it was all good practise.
He just hoped he could finger out where to look for these mystery people, before everyone available got married or died of old age waiting for him.
Malfoy fixed him with a cool stare across the desk, his grey eyes giving nothing away. Not for the first time during his training did Harry wish that he’d been better at keeping up with his occlumency after the trainwreck of fifth year, maybe then he’d be able to read what was going on behind that Malfoy Mask™. Sticking with what he
‘Have a look at today’s headline.’ Harry gestured widely at the discarded paper, before getting up to pour himself coffee number three of the morning.
Potter regarded him with a careful stare before nodding. ‘You’re not a death eater anymore, and you never were in my eyes, Draco. And you’re the furthest thing from scum I’ve ever seen. Far too poncey.’ He laughed, and Draco managed to turn up a corner of his mouth. They were kind words, but Draco didn’t appreciate Potter lying like that, especially for someone like him.
Malfoy gave a bitter laugh. ‘Sure, Potter. Instead of leaving half an hour early, I’ll make it a full hour. How’s that for you? Would that work?’
Patch chuckled. ‘Sorry mate, didn’t mean to shock you there. I work as a guard there. I met Draco whilst he was serving his sentence.’
Although, thinking back to his mother's sly comment, the inability to speak properly was a Gryffindor trait that he didn’t mind rubbing off on him so much anymore.
Patch let out a bark of laughter at that. ‘You and I also know that she’s threatened to have your bollocks if you don’t attend your own party.’
Draco looked down at the thick, creamy envelope that was now in his hands; his mother had been sending them out for a few weeks now, insisting that his first birthday without the threat of any dark lords or controlling fathers (or prison) was one to celebrate. Draco couldn’t even begin to think who she might have thought it suitable to invite. Or who would even care enough about a
Because in the end, Harry’s only worst enemy was his own oblivious to all the brilliance he’d had right in front of him all along. Thank the gods he’d had Draco to help him realise it all.
exactly he felt the need to, but it was an excuse to make Potter feel uncomfortable and flirt with him a bit more so he was going to continue. That is, until he spotted the stag pawing at the… ground? Skin? … Skin, and charge right at where his fingers were brushing against Potter’s wrist. Nearly jumping a mile (
Harry drew in a sharp breath. With Ron’s countless anecdotes of George and the shop, he’d almost managed to forget about what had him so riled up before he came out, almost forgot the horrors of Draco Malfoy
And if Harry shivered at the contact between them, and the easy and casual way Draco was intimate with him, well, that went in Harry’s mind-box too. Along with the kisses that Draco had forced Harry to never give to him.
, when he needed it most and there was no one else around. And if it made Draco’s heart speed up and skip the occasional beat and the butterflies in his stomach to beat incessantly against his ribcage, then that was just something Draco would have to push down and ignore until it went away.
He’d never touched Harry, apart from the odd grabbing-him-by-the-scruff-of-his-neck situation, but one can only live in a cupboard, starve, and be verbally abused for so long before it starts to have an effect. That, and Uncle Vernon enthusiastically encouraged Dudley and his friends in their “Harry hunting”, only to enthusiastically berate him if he managed to get away.
Charlie was giving him that smug little smile again, but Harry had no idea who he could be talking about. Other than himself, of course, and they both knew that the romantic side to their relationship had started and ended on that night two years previously. Despite the love they felt for each other, there were no deep feelings. Besides, Charlie lived in Romania for ten months out of the year and there was no way Harry was going to relocate.
It took a moment for Potter’s words to sink in, we’ll blame the firewhiskey for that, but once they did…
Potter eyed him carefully, his own eyes narrowed in an expression Draco knew only too well; one that implied he thought Draco might be
Judging by the look on Potter’s face though, he hadn’t expected to be accused of any such thing, and the thought of flirting with Draco had obviously disgusted him a little bit. And wasn’t
‘Leave it, we’ve got you plenty over here!’ Ron’s bellows came again, slicing through the entire establishment. It was a miracle that Madame Rosmerta still allowed the group of them through the door, what with Ron, Dean and Seamus’ foghorn voices attempting to break the sound barrier every time they met up for drinks.
rather than dark and set to curse you if you entered. The walls were a pale duck egg blue and the flooring looked like it was reclaimed original floorboards, nothing at all like the greys and blacks and snake detailing that had canvassed the entire house before.
‘I’ve got a charmed playpen full of toys from Andi set up in the kitchen so he’ll be joining us if that’s alright with you? Merlin knows I’ve had enough lectures from Andi, Molly, and most recently Mione about childcare that I’m smart enough to not just leave him alone.’ Potter chuckled, as if receiving said lectures had been an amusing affair. Draco shuddered, he couldn’t imagine anything worse.
.’ Harry cut him off. ‘First of all, you and Mione have only been away three months, how often does she expect me to visit? Second, you’re rambling and I’ve had too many beers to focus that much on it, so spit it out.’
! Weren’t friends supposed to be happy that he was getting out of bed, showering, and going to a paying job every day? Rather than him stay sat at home (if number 12 Grimmauld Place could ever feel like home) and wallowing in what felt like every emotion but joy, with his only company being Kreacher and his newly adopted cat and promptly ignoring the worried owls and Floo calls from everyone under the sun. (The fact that this was
people - when they needed it most. And for free. As I became friends with Draco, I began to help him unpack his trauma and deal with it in a healthy way. Although, as I said, we’ve only managed to have proper breakthroughs after his release. After he got out of that hell hole.’
for first thing on a Monday morning in the Ministry, and he tapped his wand to one of the coffee pots in the Auror tea room.
his dirt-coffee, he settled for an attempt at absorbing the caffeine via inhalation, as though he could somehow receive the energy required for a Ministry Monday Morning through osmosis.
‘Near Gringotts. Opposite end to Draco’s shop, mate.’ Of course Ron, brilliant best mate that he was, knew by now that Harry had no capabilities of processing anything other than Draco on a good day. Sixth year had been rough on everyone involved. Harry could’ve kissed him for pre-empting the Draco-worry. He didn’t, though, because, well, Draco.
Draco reached one hand up to cup Harry’s cheek, and Harry drew in a sharp breath at the sudden intimacy. The two boys moved together, holding each other in their arms, before closing the remaining gap between their lips.
pregnant (pregnant!), but he’d tried with Ginny who was near enough a best friend, right? And Harry loved her, he really did, but after the end of it all he just couldn’t shake that it felt more like having sex with a sister rather than a girlfriend, and he was glad they’d stopped
But the excitement and passion that Malfoy felt for the process, the fire Harry could see behind his grey eyes, he couldn’t help but feel almost
Apparently this seemed to soothe Sam a little, as he visibly relaxed into his seat and took another sip of his drink. Deciding he looked entirely too comfortable like that, Harry thought it was high time he summoned up some of that famous Gryffindor bravery.
‘Hi Janice, bye Janice.’ Harry marched past the witch and threw Robards’ office door open. He’d had to wait
Taking a deep breath, Harry opened the door, still not quite believing that his brain was allowing him to go through with this at last. The tinkling of the bell snapped him out of his reverie, bringing his green eyes up and locking straight on to a pair of steely grey.
Whatever he was saying seemed to have an effect on Malfoy to say the least. He was suddenly very tense and uneasy, no longer looking Harry in the eye, squirming around in his seat. The confident, puffed-up prick was gone, and in his place was a very timid, insecure man; Draco Malfoy was unrecognisable in seconds. In fact, it was only the platinum hair that convinced Harry that this wasn’t someone else using Polyjuice potion that had that instance worn off.
‘... but I’m really sorry, Harry. I was really looking forward to getting a drink,’ Draco was still talking to him, and Harry couldn’t deny that he did sound ill,
, Harry landed his apparition in a small alleyway in the middle of Notting Hill. Emerging, he took stock of his surroundings. A few streets back from the famous Portobello Road sat the neatly hidden wizarding community that surrounded it’s own high street. Although charmed to appear as any old collection of houses (although with a very strong anti-muggle repellant), Harry felt himself be welcomed by the wards as he strolled along the road with his hands in his pockets, taking stock of all the establishments around him. He kept a keen eye in particular on the Troll’s Foot pub, one of his and Ron’s personal favourites, wondering if he’d have time to pop in for a quick pint later on.
‘Together? Gods no,’ Patch chuckled. ‘Draco and I are firm friends and that’s all. I love him, but in the way you might love a brother. Besides, I don’t think Draco’s ready for that in his life just yet.’
, over just about everyone in the wizarding world, would be miserable around the anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts? Harry Potter who had lost more people than Draco could count? Who had been hit, not once but
Harry felt stunned, had Draco really just responded civilly to him? Had they had an interaction that didn’t involve insults or shouting or raised wands? Was he in some kind of alternate universe?
‘Not quite… I’ve managed to convince Robards to let me work for the hour of our meeting, even though I’m on leave to spend some time with Teddy, but if you’re up for it Robards has said it’s fine if we meet in my, erm, flat?’
Not trusting himself to speak, he’d been teased once too many times about his ineloquence by Draco to risk it, Harry took one step, two steps, three, until he was right in front of Draco. Sharing the same breath, eyes almost at the same height, green on grey.
‘Right. Has your employment changed?’ Like he really needed to ask, he’d been in there only yesterday and Eddie had made sure Draco was none the wiser, no need to repeat
It’d been four years since Draco had last seen him. Four years since he’d allowed himself to think of that mop of black hair and those particularly piercing green eyes, the tall, lean frame of his body and the sharp cut of his jaw.
‘Right,’ Draco’s voice boomed in the silence and Potter jumped a mile, ‘you’re all done with the ink. Shall I get started on the movement charm?’
‘Malfoy, you’re late. Again. You do realise I’m a lot more lenient than most parole officers would be? Merlin knows why, you’re the biggest git I’ve ever met.’ Potter turned around at that, and the look on his face when he saw Dracos was almost so priceless, Draco wished he had a camera to preserve it forever.
Potter cleared his throat and Draco nearly jumped out of his skin. He’d been so far inside his own head, spiralling at the thought of
Usually, his boss would be shouting from the rooftops of Diagon at Boy Wonder coming into the parlour for an appointment, so how come Draco hadn’t heard about it before now?
He just didn’t have anyone else that would understand exactly what was going on in his head, or what his nightmares were about, or why he still had nightmares all these years later.
been aiming more for a playful, flirty tease while he had his internal panic about how much he actually really wanted Malfoy to kiss him but he couldn’t because he was his parole officer and there were all sorts of inappropriate power imbalances there and it really wasn’t great.
The voice of his godson broke him out of his train of thought. Harry smiled down at Teddy, before focusing back on the film to see which song they were up to now. It was “One Jump Ahead”, Aladdin was jumping through the streets to escape the guards; Teddy’s
Not that Draco particularly minded, it had been a fairly long week. He’d been picking up more and more customers at the parlour, been forced to take his mother and Patch out for lunch several days, and had had a particularly gruelling session with his mind healer two days previously.
Instantly, the bar was filled with noise and screams and laughter of students looking for a drink on a Friday night. Harry was jostled away from his position at the bar, but he didn’t mind as he wanted to get to Draco anyway, and ask him what the hell was going on?
did he hope that Potter wouldn’t come. He hoped that Potter would use what little brain he had, for once, and not show his face, but Draco knew that even that might be too much to ask of Boy Wonder.
The rest of the film passed without much more of an incident, bar Teddy forcing Harry to duet “A Whole New World” with him, to the obvious amusement of Malfoy. Harry had glared at him and warned him that ‘
The two men walked back into the main reception. Eddie was behind the counter and looked up at them both when they came in, as if shocked that they’d both survived the appointment without one of them killing the other. Great support from his boss there.
‘What’s happened? You’re home much later than I had expected. I thought your meeting was only supposed to last an hour?’ The concern in Narcissa’s eyes weren’t veiled at all; Draco winced,
with Potter (which he was, but that was none of P’s business) before swanning off to find his mother and tell her of his supposed (definite) flirting. Brilliant.
And with that, Malfoy stood and tried his very best to not run from the room. Harry couldn’t blame him at all, if
Only as he spoke, houses number eleven and thirteen seemed to shake and stretch, the muggles inside them remaining utterly oblivious. When the buildings eventually stopped shaking, Draco blinked and shook his head. There, right in front of where he was standing, where previously there had been nothing, was now another house with a neat, golden
Who was this “Liam”? And why was he interrupting Harry’s date with Draco? Who did he think he was, waltzing in here, all tall, dark and handsome, and hugging Draco like
Draco cleared his throat. ‘Potter, I’m not trying to be insensitive, but if you just hand over your paperwork I can fill it in myself. You don’t even need to look at it. Or me. I understand that looking at a death eater will likely make this mood of yours worse, but I’ll be the one in trouble if you don’t write up what you’re supposed to.’
Harry couldn’t help but laugh out loud at that. Even at the ripe old age of twenty one, with a house, a wife, and a baby on the way, Ronald Bilius Weasley still operated on a payment service of sweets and chocolate. Harry understood though, as much as they had all warmed up to Malfoy over the past few months, he was still a massive git.
‘I wouldn’t come any closer if I were you, Charlie. You remember what happened last time you snuck up behind me like that.’
They stayed in silence as Draco finished the antlers, only the buzzing of the tattoo gun filling the space between them. He had to admit, this was the most comfortable he’d felt in the presence of anyone -
‘ENOUGH,’ Harry roared. He took a deep breath and tried desperately to collect himself; Hermione was always laying into him for not getting his temper under control, she’d given him exercises for it and everything. So he tried to step away from the fight, and remind himself that him and Draco were adults now, twenty one years old with a whole lifetime’s worth of life experience already under their belts. They weren’t fourteen-year-olds fighting in the middle of a Hogwarts courtyard anymore. ‘Now, if you could stop being such a git, I’d like to get on with these bloody questions.’
But then Potter walked back into the room and Draco’s eyes fell to the hips he could see jutting out of those joggers, the ridiculous amount of muscles he could see through the thin material of his shirt, that bird’s nest of a hair-do, and those eyes. Those eyes that had been the sole reason he’d never skipped a meal at school and the only colour that broke through the greys of Azkaban.
‘Whatever, Potter. I appreciate the help you’re offering for my name change but I’m not discussing the trials, or Azkaban with you, so just leave it.’ And with that, Malfoy made his way over to Teddy and set about playing with him most enthusiastically, determinately ignoring every attempt Harry made at getting his attention.
‘Yeah… wait, what do you mean patient confidentiality? I thought you were a guard?’ Harry was confused.
It was Draco’s turn to have his eyes widened into dinner plates again, showing Harry plenty of iris to notice them darken considerably, and Harry knew his own eyes must have done the same.
Harry shook his head in disbelief. He’d been trying to help, but if Malfoy was just going to throw it back in his face like that then what was the point.
‘Listen, Potter… before I leave… mother is insisting on having a small get together at our house in Kensington this weekend and she seems to think that you being my parole officer is a good reason to invite you.’
to remind them both of at every available opportunity. He’d be loath to find out he’d missed one here.
. Draco’s insides twisted. He should’ve known that this would come out eventually, there was no way it could have stayed buried deep inside him forever. It was a miracle it had stayed hidden for as long as it had, but Potter just stayed silently watching him. ‘
They raced to the Apparition point, along with a few other partners of Aurors, and twisted away to Diagon. The scene that greeted them upon arrival appeared to be one of pure pandemonium at first glance, but Harry saw that it was just several frantic shoppers all talking to their own Auror pair in the immediate vicinity.
Of course, Harry wasn’t blind. As soon as he’d figured out he was bi, he’d realised that the reason behind what had felt like pure hatred towards the boy whilst they’d been in school had really been rather thinly veiled attraction on his part.
date, and Harry thanked every deity he could think of that the room was dark and the near-constant blush of his cheeks wasn’t visible.
‘Cheers. You’ll fit in here alright if you keep that up. Still can’t believe you don’t smoke.’ Eddie clapped him on the shoulder and made his way out back, already pulling his pack of cigarettes and a lighter out of his pocket.
The second the drinks were ready, Harry handed over a handful of galleons that was definitely more than required, took the drinks from the counter, and resolutely did not look at Sam again as he made his way to the table Andi had chosen.
‘I’m sorry I have to have Teddy here today but Andi had an emergency to tend to and you’re related to him anyway so I figured you’d have nothing to complain about.’
With his wrist wrapped up, Draco pressed the healing cream into Potter’s hand. ‘You’ll need to wash it with gentle soap and apply that twice a day for about two weeks, and make sure you
had an inkling, based entirely on the inferno that seemed to take over his face each time Draco shifted next to him or hooked a leg over Harry’s or leant over and whispered in his ear. Of course Harry had noticed he was blushing. The only thing he couldn’t figure out was why he was blushing over
‘You’re not in any pain are you? I’m not hurting you?’ There was definitely something behind Potter’s eyes, but Draco couldn’t quite tell what. The last thing he needed was a complaint from Wonder Boy that he’d been neglecting his pain-numbing charms. Eddie would put him right the way back down the list of artists, that is, if he didn’t fire him straight away.
"They are," agreed aunt Hermione, and Albus felt the bed dipped by her weight when she sat herself. "Let them be, they must be really tired."
Honestly, he'd never imagine the turn of the event would lead to something like this. Before he knows it, a smile blooms upon his face and he quickly searches for his parchment to write a quick reply, rolls them neatly and ties them on the small owl’s leg before the bird gracefully flies away.
He waited for a few good minutes before he secretly took off his Cloak, not forgetting to check his surroundings as he duck down in between Ron and Hermione, felt her hand gathering the Cloak in her lap. He took a camouflage and dived down under the table when he saw Malfoy turned around all of a sudden, hitting his head in the process resulting a snort from Ron, and climbed out when Ron gave him a green light. With a whisper of good luck from his friends, Harry carefully made his way towards the Slytherin table.
Harry shook his head as he appraised the black haired boy. Honestly, that kid was such a baby when it came to his father but like an angry little cat when dealing with other people. Scorpius was much more behaved, polite but Harry knew he would not hesitate to do anything for his family, judging from the way he acted around Albus and Malfoy. Hell, he even found a way to cure his father!
Draco huffs an annoyed breath. “I didn't go to Dixon because you asked me not to, but he went overboard today. He fucking slap a first year right in front of me, Harry. I can't just let that go.”
Malfoy heaved a deep sigh move to stand in between the two of them. He propped his hands on his waist, sending both Henry and Harry a warning look. "Rule number one: if one picked a fight, the other must not fight back."
Leo was a reserved person; collective, calm, compassionate, kind hearted, and a great friend that sometimes Harry questioned the universe how a wonderful person like Leo had Malfoy for a twin brother, because Malfoy-
"Thank you." said Harry, pulling a chair and sorting himself before he squirmed around, uncomfortable. He looked up when he heard a chuckle from McGonagall.
However, as far as he knew, the Demon Regime was currently ruled by a new Demon King who overthrew its previous King; Voldermort. He was not one for gossip, but the war of the underworld five years ago was quite a huge scandal that even managed to reach his ear. He didn't know much about this new Demon King, but one thing that he was sure of; the Demon King possessed a lightning bolt scar on his forehead. A fact that even the Upper Officials knew. Knowing his luck, this seemingly high rank demon might be the Demon King himself.
He smiled, what an adorable sight. They had been the highlight of his day, everyday without fail. Even if Albus can be a nuisance sometimes it gave Draco headache or when Scorpius- wait Scorpius managed to behave himself. Must be coming from his side. He bit his lips to hold back a grin, wondering what kind of traits must his future husband possess for Albus to copy those behaviors of his.
He abruptly stands up - sending his chair toppled to the floor - and round up his desk as he walks purposely straight out of his office.
Draco took a glance at Potter's kissable lips; they look tempting but Draco knows his place. “You're a cruel man, Harry Potter.”
"I adore you." Draco had whispered lovingly, and it was that moment when Harry decided he wouldn't mind spending his forever with the white-blond haired man.
He chuckled when Ron and Hermione dropped their jaw in unison which soon followed by Hermione when Ron twisted his face in comical confusion.
“Headmistress, are you saying that they're from,” He paused, and inhaled carefully as he breathed. “The future?”
Harry felt like he was watching a private moment when they started to stare at each other. He turned to look for Ron's eyes but his friend had his eyes on Henry with a little frown. He nudged Ron, and raised an eyebrow when his friend turned to him.
"Besides," Ron piped in, face was teasing. "You were back to obsessing Malfoy these past few days, mate. Your eyes practically glued to him every time you saw him."
He ran his fingers through his hair, “My sons, from the future.” He let out a shaky breath, and felt blank somehow. As if the valves that were connecting his brain short circuited by the sudden information, and they just simply stopped working.
Before Potter could even reply, Pansy dropped her bum heavily on Draco’s lap, making the man groan at the sudden weight. “Pansy!”
"Al, you're not helping!" exclaimed Scorpius, and scolded more but Harry didn't pay them any attention anymore. His mind was already full with the possibilities about what Henry would do with Malfoy's body.
That was the first words Ginevra Weasley has said to him as soon as he joined the group back after three weeks since the incident with Potter.
Harry abruptly stopped and snapped his head to Ron so quickly he almost got whiplash. “You noticed?”
"Blimey!" cursed Seamus, before he turned to Harry again. "Well, fix it because Pansy won't talk to me otherwise!"
"What, what?" Harry immediately woke up from his sleep, straightened up by surprise and instantly regretted it once his back muscles screamed in protest. "Ah!"
Draco pulled out the second arrow and positioned his aim on Harry. As soon as he releases the arrow, the bond will take place and his job is done. Enhanced Magic for the entire year for his department. He grinned at that, enthusiastically pulling his bow string and launched.
He observed his next target; a mid twenties young man with a rather obnoxious black hair that seemingly can't be tamed. He was wearing a simple black jeans, white t-shirt and a jean jacket and Draco involuntarily hummed in appreciation when the man turned to give the place a once-over, allowing Draco to see his face. The man was quite a devastatingly handsome young man.
“Thank you, Granger.” said Malfoy, nodding with appreciation. “But I really do need to speak with you, Potter," he gestured to somewhere behind his shoulder. "Regarding my sons.”
"A whole lot of problems!" said Draco, and he got down from the bed, marching angrily at him. "He won't stop apologising!"
Draco automatically held a breath, before he released them shakily. “Since when did you become such a beast?”
Harry hears the sound of cheers and shouts before he sees the commotion. There was a large crowd right in front of the Great Hall, as chants of names were thrown but Harry can hear who's name dominates the chanting.
He sighed in relief when he saw both Harry and Ginevra were just turning around a corner the moment he stepped outside, and he immediately trailed behind them as he put on an invisible charm on himself, not risking getting caught in the act.
Draco swallowed, “I don't think that's a good idea?” He took a glance at Ginevra who was watching their interaction with interest.
It has been two days after their incident in front of the Great Hall and Harry was desperate. It doesn't help that it was a few more days until Christmas holiday, and his plan was nowhere forward. Plus, he knew Malfoy had been avoiding him, using the Slytherins as his shield, turning the other way every time his eyes landed on Harry.
“Well?” Parkinson probed, handing out a napkin to the small boy and he received it with a small thank you. “Your papa was the kind of person who needed proof if you wanted him to believe in something. So, do you have any?”
Harry followed him in an instant, gathering his Cloak into his arms as he frowned at the white-blond Slytherin. "Why not?"
“Explain before I get angry!” Draco frowned angrily at the man in front of him, crossing his arms together to show his displeasure.
Ron and Hermione were right, Draco did learn to master Disillusionment Charm the moment Voldermort entered the Manor, said that the charm had saved his neck most of the time from getting killed.
"You'll see him tomorrow, mate. Don't worry, eh?" Seamus clasped a hand to his shoulder gleefully and Harry nodded, thanking both of them before he runs to find Ron and Hermione. It was more of running away from doing himself further destruction, really.
He sent his Patronus when he was meters away from the gargoyle; to inform McGonagall of his arrival, and proceeded to enter the Headmistress' office when it was already open for him.
They turned to the source's voice to see Ginny watching them with both fondness and annoyance from the camp's entrance, red hair waving when a breeze of wind blew her hair.
Because if he was, then the universe played him a big joke. Harry Potter was the last person Draco wanted to associate with, even if the Saviour of the Wizarding World managed to save his life twice. He was doing his very best to avoid the Saviour’s cronies since the term has started, let alone Potter himself. He watched anxiously as his sons shared a long look when Albus suddenly pfft-ed while waving his hand in a dismissive manner.
As if it was his purpose to prove Ron wrong, Harry was yanked backwards out of nowhere, strong but not to the point that it was hurting him. Hands firmly taking a grip on each side of his face before he was pulled into a fierce open mouth kiss that got Harry struggling for breath through his nose.
“As far as I know, Blood Curse can only be reversed by using the cursed one-” Hermione stopped midway and raised an eyebrow at Malfoy who's cheeks suddenly dusted with pink that made Harry wonder what Scorpius meant by special.
McGonagall said nothing, but put her attention on her cup as she delicately brought it up to her and took a small sip. Harry patiently watched as the Headmistress placed down her cup gently, brows slightly frowning as she seemingly in a deep thought. Harry unconsciously held a breath when McGonagall brought her gaze to him, frown ceased from her face but she still appeared serious.
Draco glanced at the man, taken aback when Potter already had his eyes on him, watching him closely. He averted his eyes away, not used to having those piercing green eyes landed on him with that look on his face. They were too overwhelming.
“They were too busy being intelligent and searching for complex solutions!” cried Albus, and Scorpius facepalm, giving up of his brother's manner. “Papa is getting weaker by the day and it's only a matter of time for his body to shut down!”
He heard a scoff making him snapped out of his daze and turned to face his boyfriend. He amusedly smiled, “Are you jealous, Love?”
Harry rubs his face and stands up, moving around his table to kneel in between Draco parted leg. He takes Draco’s hand into his gently, warily watch as Draco had his face facing the window again.
"You can't just kiss me and think it will solve the problem, Potter." said Malfoy, lips thinned despite his flushed face.
Seamus laughed, followed by Hermione which soon copied by Ron and Harry stood there watching his friends losing their mind over something important. Well, important to him that is.
He couldn't help but recall the letter he received a few months after the war just ended. It was a few weeks after Malfoy's trial, and whilst his father was found guilty and was sent to Azkaban, Malfoy and his mother were pardoned for their act of assisting Harry and the Light side to win the war - courtesy of Harry's testimony - and were given probation of house arrest for two years, and attending Hogwarts for Malfoy. The white-blond haired man has written him his apologies for his action towards him as well as expressing his appreciation for Harry's act of kindness. Harry knew he had written for everyone who had suffered from his wrongdoing throughout the war too, especially those who had been taken to the Manor as prisoners.
Of course Harry would do exactly the opposite, especially when Seamus approached him when they were about to go to bed, whispering; "Madam Promfey made him stay over the Hospital Wing until he's well enough, and he was alone."
"He is, professor." agreed Harry, smiling a little when he recalled the golden sparks dancing across Draco’s pale skin. Golden means purity, barely touched by others, blood pure as a virgin maiden. "It was a good thing that he was still a virgin, but-"
Malfoy bit his lips, wide eyes locking with his friends looking hesitant to even say anything. He looked like a walking tree, too stiff to be in Henry's arm.
“Stop being stupid, Draco or you'll be late!” Blaise hollered, making him scoffed and moved to Potter.
The twins sagged in relief as they quickly reached out and gave their father a peck each on his cheeks, drawing a smile from Draco.
He dragged his unfocused eyes to Henry, and the brain slowly interpreted Henry's instruction. “Undress?”
Naturally, his eyes moved across the table to sought for a particular white-blond head sitting by the end of the table with his friends, sharing looks with one another while mysterious smiles decorating their faces. He hadn't seen the other male since the last time he saw him, and it was good to see he actually doing well and looked healthy. Harry noted that Malfoy has styled his hair similar to sixth year, where he has let his hair free from those slick hair gel. Harry decided he liked the look on him.
Malfoy’s nose flares when Harry’s magic touch his skin, as he gives Harry deathful glares. “Don't you fucking think you can put me on a leash just because I'm dating you.”
“What, that you've been snogging some bloke which you've never known about for weeks, and find that you actually liked it means you were gay?” Ron raised a brow.
They parted away eventually, collecting their breaths as they leaned into each other's foreheads. Harry couldn't help the smile that grew upon his face when he heard the sound of a small chuckle come from his lover. Now that he can think more clearly, he realised that he had acted pathetically earlier.
“And when I'm not?” asked Potter then, eyes turn calculating that made Draco sweat under his clothes.
He dragged his eyes towards Malfoy's broken arm that was resting on his stomach, temporary cast was put on. He was changed into a matching pyjamas that makes him look soft, and Harry chuckled when he saw the small army of the Golden Snitch decorating the clothes. Harry looked further down Malfoy's legs, relieved to see there was no serious injury. Perhaps there were bruises that can't be seen, hidden beneath the pyjamas, but Malfoy will survive.
"Bye, Potter." sneered Malfoy, though without that much malice and walked away immediately with his head stubbornly facing forward, leaving his friends behind.
Draco turned to him, scoffing as he regarded Harry. "Do I need to remind you that we haven't even taken our NEWTs yet?"
Harry looked over his shoulder to see the grey coloured eyes already pinned to him. He mentally swallowed. "Perhaps your choice of a husband was wrong."
“Must be a powerful witch then, to cast a strong charm like that.” said Hermione in amazement and Harry just had to smirked at his friends.
Parkinson and Ginny shared an excited grin and they quickly ran towards the older man, and Hermione cleared her throat. “I need to speak with Henry, for research purposes.” She said, hurriedly following the two girls’ steps.
Potter stood on his knee immediately, facing Draco as he took a deep breath and looked at Draco dead in his eyes. He opened his mouth, but no words came out.
When the air around the room went back to normal, she slowly exhaled before she opened her eyes to see a warm smile, the faded shape of the famous lightning bolt scar and the familiar green eyes.
There was a moment of silence after that as everybody practically dropped their jaw, including Zabini and Parkinson.
Harry made a face, though he didn't deny his friends' accusation because it was the truth. He straightened up when something occurred to him. "Wait, wait. You said Ginny saw him using the charm and the chocolates when she went to see Malfoy. That was ages ago!"
Draco laughed, taking a sight on a very irritated but adorable Potter. Oh, what a cruel world he's living in.
Harry nodded, memories of Draco who was glowing and looking much healthier during his pregnancy playing through his mind. Draco did not encounter any complexity during those months he was carrying their sons. He was having a healthy pregnancy.
"Yes, Chosen One." declared Draco and Ginny in unison, falling into a fit of laugh when Harry groaned in exasperation.
Harry gasped happily as he promptly pulled him into a tight hug, laughing delightfully. He gave Draco a final squeeze before he pulled away, face dripping with happiness that tugged Draco's heartstrings since he never saw this expression on his face. He felt special.
Henry softly laughed, but Harry can see that the man felt overwhelmed to be standing in front of Malfoy. It promptly reminded him that Malfoy had fallen ill in the future and probably, it has been a long time for Henry to even see the light in those grey eyes.
It almost gave him a heart attack when it happened to him the first time. He was only a few steps behind Ron and Hermione, content on watching his friends lovingly teasing one another when a hand grabbed his robes and stalled him from walking. He was yanked around, and felt hands on each of his cheeks before he was pulled into a kiss, enough to make him light headed and dizzy. But just like the way he appeared, his culprit vanished in a blink of an eye after stealing Harry's ability to function, leaving him with a heart shaped chocolate tucked nicely in his curled fist.
Henry scoffed, picking up himself from the floor and patting the dirt off his clothes. “I didn't harass him, it was an accident.”
“Indeed he is.” Potter says, caressing the small boy's head as he regards Draco once again. “I should probably head back now.”
Harry caught Draco’s questioning face and he shrugged as an answer. They both turned when the sight of the small group near the Slytherin table had stopped, placing the boxes on the floor as they raised their wands towards it. When they casted a spell, the content in the boxes jumped out, flew over the Slytherin students and wrapped itself around every student of the Slytherin. Harry watched with fascination to Draco when the white-blond haired male gape as he lifted the sudden present; a knitted scarf. He turned to Harry and blinked, resulting in a laugh from Harry. More so when the other houses suddenly yelled in a rather practiced tempo of; "Happy Christmas!"
He looked around for his brother only to see him standing in front of an old lady with a stern face, who was looking at him with a pair of wise eyes.
Henry looked up as Draco stopped on his underpants. “Do I need to take this off too?” He asked, trying to tame down the flush of red that was slowly creeping up his face. Merlin, but he has never been fully naked in front of anyone before.
But who he was kidding. If anything, he was the one who has set his mind on Malfoy since the first time the incident happened.
“Merlin, you're such a vulgar. I can't believe I'm going to marry you!” Draco blurted out, slapping his mouth when he realised his chosen words. Henry, bless his heart, only gives Draco a coy smile.
“But I do,” said Potter, as he moved closer to Draco and cupped his cheeks gently, “I do, and I'm sorry for being ignorant all this time but I need to be sure of my feelings too. You've been really wonderful to me, Draco, and I'm sorry for driving you away but it made me realise that I can't take you for granted. I can lose you anytime, and might not get you back if I continue being ignorant. I can't lose you.”
Draco blinked at him in confusion, but answered. “Granger and I are supposed to see Madam Promfey tomorrow morning to extract my blood. Enough to make a potion that could counter the Curse with several trials. We'll write notes, so Future Granger will know what to do.”
By the time they arrived at the Great Hall, Ginny and Hermione were almost done with their breakfast. Ginny looked much better than last night, face pink as she announced that she was going to visit Malfoy and thank him in person. It took a willpower for Harry not to jump out and volunteered to accompany her to see Malfoy, but he managed to hold himself back. He was not going to look so eager in front of the Slytherin male, that would be embarrassing.
Harry bit his lips, a bit guilty for mentioning his father. “I probably shouldn't have mentioned your father, but this action of yours are getting out of hand, Malfoy.” He says in a soft but firm voice, knitting his fingers together as he put them on his table. “You have been in a good behavior, but ever since Dixon arrived, you stupidly go back into your old behavior, picking up fights, set up pranks. Don't you think it's enough already? You only get yourself hurt in the end!”
He jumped when they simultaneously turned to him all of a sudden, and he was not quite sure of what to do except to stupidly stare at their expectant faces, brows raised in an identical manner as they leaned forward, invading Harry's personal space. It went like that for a while, just Harry darting his eyes to his friends back and forth when the pressure was too much for him to handle making him groaned aloud.
He suppressed a content sigh, and waited until a kiss was dropped on his forehead, so light that he would miss it if not for the hot breath that followed after. He felt more movement around him, careful as if afraid that he would jolt up at any moment. The movement then stalled, followed by silence long enough to lure him to open his eyes. He almost did so, if not for the sudden sigh.
Augustine Dixon was a bad news. He was a transfer student from Dumstrang, and since he arrived, he has brought terror to the students, as if it was his vow to make the Hogwarts students suffers - much to Harry's chagrin.
Malfoy, who was sitting next to the twins, patted the small boy’s head softly, “It was a very pleasant surprise, Albus.”
“Good. I want you to relax.” said Henry, cupping Draco’s face so they can look at each other's eyes. “Remember, I won't do anything that will displease you. Do you trust me?”
Harry looked up to see Malfoy already in a sitting position, looking down on him with lips curling as if he was trying to repress a forming smile. He gave an unsure smile of his own, scratching his head as he greeted the white-blond haired man.
Malfoy doesn't know who his future husband was but Harry knew he got his own suspicion. It can't be that hard, right?
“Where do you think it's coming from?” asked Harry, leaning forward to take a closer look of the chocolate when Hermione held it in between them.
He dropped his head on the bed, just next to his and Malfoy's intertwined hands and closed his eyes.
Draco sniffed heavily by the time Potter finished his confession, as fat tears were already running down his cheeks. He wiped them away with his sleeve. Oh, dear, was this really happening? His heart felt like they were about to burst out.
“That would be my fault.” said Granger sheepishly. “I was just explaining to them about the cure of the Blood Curse that we've been working on.”
In the first month, he only made sure that Potter knew he existed by giving the man a smile or saying ‘Hi' on the hallway. By halfway through the third month, Draco started showing his interest. He gave him compliments, giving him a hint of his interest and sent Potter his favourite treacle tart which became an everyday thing as Potter seemed to prefer the one that he gave- he actually baked it himself but Potter doesn't need to know that. On the fifth month, Potter acknowledged his interest towards him which made Draco attracted towards the man even more because instead of freaking out, Potter simply gave him an impressive smile; “That's cool.” he had said. On the sixth month and onwards, Draco doesn't need to hold back his flirtation. He even became good friends with Potter and his clique that made things much easier. Despite all that however, Draco made sure that he won't go overboard just in case Potter got uncomfortable. He needed his crush subject to be attracted to him, after all.
"Thank Merlin you have two wonderful boys to bring you back on track," said McGonagall, proud smile on display. "I believe you need to stop thinking of the difficulties, and think more like a Gryffindor."
“Almost forgot!” exclaimed Draco, ran towards the man and quickly bent down to paste a kiss on his cheek, “Stay safe, Love!”
“Wait, wait!” Draco halted his step when he remembered something, and turned around to Potter in an instant, who was also facing him by now, raising his eyebrows playfully at him.
“You don't have to figure it now, don't want to hurt that pretty head of yours.” Henry grinned, patting the white-blond head.
Draco cluck his tongue, ignoring the painful feelings in his heart. “What a cruel man, you expect me to hang out with you after you broke my heart?”
“Potter,” greeted Malfoy, “Granger and Weasleys.” He nodded at them and they warily nodded back. Harry looked down behind Malfoy to see the twins were laughing at whatever Zabini said, and he can't help but felt left out.
"Yes, Malfoy." said Hermione, confident and clear. "I know we're not always on the same page, but we really need your help on this one."
Of course when he'd actually set his mind on something, it wouldn't go as he planned. He had tried, so hard to get Malfoy's attention but apparently he had to compete with other Slytherins.
Scorpius, on his part, immediately moved and continued his mission, trying hard to make sure he found it before their dad now that he was looking for it too, just like what their older dad had predicted. If he found it first, and looked into the Map, their older dad's identity will be revealed and it causes more problems than necessary.
“Well, it was not that hard to notice when one moment you were talking and the next it looked like you were making out with the air.”
They unconsciously straightened up in unison as the man stride confidently towards them with the twins by his side, faces beaming with happiness and relief.
“Come on!” Draco groaned, laughing when Harry growled again, bending down to bite his ears. “Don't make me do things you don't want to in public, Draco Malfoy.”
Harry kept his eyes on Malfoy, fixed on holding his gaze when the pair of grey eyes landed on him. Bracing himself of an incoming sneer, Malfoy gave him a great surprise when he sent Harry a small polite smile which he mindlessly returned with a smile of his own. Malfoy’s eyes widened at that, before averting his eyes elsewhere in an instant. Even with the distance, Harry thought he could catch the change of colour in Malfoy’s face.
"Alright, let's stop," said Harry, deciding to put a stop on his teasing seeing the pouting that was set on his little husband's face which he was sure the younger man did not even realise. "Go change into your pyjamas, it's late already. We need to rest."
He spent his time looking at the Marauder's Map for a few minutes, just until Parkinson and Zabini left the Hospital Wing, and until he was satisfied with what he saw. He put down the map under his pillow just in time as his friends were back, waiting as they dressed up while exchanging jokes and small talk.
Harry couldn't help the smile that was growing upon his face. He made a drastic decision and extended an arm towards Draco. "Let's cuddle."
“No, no! No!” protested Harry, pulling Draco closer when he tried to escape. “You're mine, you can't go to anyone else!”
He went and took a shower when the first spek of sunlight showed itself. By the time he was dressed in his uniform, his friends just woke up.
“Eat properly, Albus. The food won't disappear if you eat slowly.” said Draco, as he wiped Albus’ face with a napkin. The boy gave him a sheepish grin, taking the napkin in his hand as he slowed down his munching. Scorpius sat next to his other side, having his breakfast in silence. Draco smiled at the adorable sight of his twins.
He didn't mind the isolation from other students as he already expected for it the moment he touched Hogwarts’ ground but he went through his days everyday asking if it was worth it for him to continue his life.
“He is a fan of Harry Potter, papa.” said Albus without a beat and smiled, far too innocent for Draco’s taste.
"Don't leave me, please!" begged Harry desperately, using his leftover strength to pull Draco into his lap, and wrapped his arms around his lover, bringing their face together. "I can't do this without you."
"You too, sweetheart." reminded Draco, lifting Harry's hand that was holding him and gave a chaste kiss on his knuckles. He let go and Harry watched with a heavy heart as Draco walked towards Ginny, taking the equipment that was handed to him from the General. With a parting glance, Draco and Ginny disappeared into black mist.
Draco lets out a huge smile at that, but quickly wince when his split lips burns. Harry stands up in an instant, bending down to inspect the injury closer. “Now I hate him more for making this beautiful lips hurt.”
Harry felt warmth spreading through his cheek by the sudden appearance of the soft smile. He blinked rapidly, pushing up his glasses to cover up his embarrassment. "It's- It's fine. I would do that to everyone."
There's a deep sigh followed, and Harry intently listened to the steady rhythm of inhaled and exhaled that followed.
The information suddenly made Draco light headed. All this time pursuing Potter, telling the man that he will stop once he has fallen in love. It was a bad joke on his side, wasn't it?
Heart skyrocketing, he barely aware of the wide smile carved upon his face as he breathlessly greeted the the white-blond haired Slytherin.
The man drew a fond smile when his gaze fell on Malfoy, making the white-blond haired flushed attractively. Harry bit the inside of his cheek.
"Salazar, fine!" The voice on his side hissed back at the door before he turned back to Harry. "I guess it's a good bye now. I'll… see you around. Don't miss me too much, though I doubt you will. Have a good sleep."
"They were everywhere, Potter," said Draco with a pinched look. "and I am nowhere safe in my own house."
Harry had asked him about the chocolates, asked about who has been the mastermind behind the plan which got one of a hell smug look from Draco as he said; "Yours truly, of course. Father was in Azkaban now, so I can do whatever I want with the money, though the rest have pitched in too."
"It's suicide," said Harry, voice cracked at the mere thought of losing this person. "You know it's a suicide mission and I can't let you do that!"
"Precisely, Harry." agreed McGonagall. "I am certain that you can recall Draco’s health during his pregnancy?"
They held their gaze on each other for a moment, and it was Draco who averted his eyes first, dragging them to James who continued to sleep soundly in his father's arm. He can't help but give soft chuckles. “He's a beautiful child.”
It was the tone that their dad had always used when he was about to go on a dangerous mission. He would always talk to them before he left, explaining that he had to be away for several days. Usually when their dad was in this mode, they know better than to ask many questions. There was this expression on his face; where there was a crease on his forehead and a stern look on his face when something was occupying his mind. Though it looked intimidating for other people, Albus can't help but think it was admirable, because he knew that their dad would always give his best on everything he did.
Granger took a deep breath before she said, “Ginny is Harry's ex-girlfriend. They were going on and off their relationship, they broke up months before you came into the picture. But now that Ginny’s here…” Granger trailed off, turning her gaze away from his face to look down at the floor. “I don't know what to predict, Draco. Ginny has always been Harry's one and only.”
Harry's insides decided to make a twist at the sight and he slightly frowned at the foreign feeling that poked his heart.
“Nonsense!” Henry laughed, swinging a hand over Malfoy’s shoulder and dragging him towards them. “He's my husband - well, not yet but there's no harm flirting with your own husband. You boys are just jealous.”
Henry's brow furrowed, his eyes full of intensity that it caught Draco off guard when he was suddenly pulled into a kiss.
It has been a bizarre day, but at least he wasn't the only one who thought that the exchange was rather eccentric when he saw the same astounded look carved on Malfoy’s face.
"Well, I had my ways of course." said Seamus smugly, wiggling his brows in a suggestive way and Harry did not need to know about that. He grimaced.
“Perhaps, but we don't really mind about dad.” said Albus, “We’ve traveled back in time in order to save our papa.”
Yes, Harry Potter was one magnificent creature. At first, Draco was attracted to his handsome face and his bloody fit body. But then, over the time, Draco was attracted to his personality and charms. Never once Draco has met a perfect man like Harry Potter.
It has been a week since Weasley's little sister transferred from her last university. And since then, Potter seemed to be hooked by her existence.
"Excuse me?" exclaimed Scorpius, giving his brother a disbelief look. "You were the one who had insisted on looking after dad, while I went and took the Map and you blame me? You were the one who lost him!"
Draco can't help but laugh at his son’s words, covering up his mouth with a hand when heads turned to them again, perhaps traumatised to see a Death Eater freely laughed. Another warning look from Madam Pince got him to swallow his laugh. He bit his lips as he turned to his sons with mirth. “I did?”
His attention slowly diverts back to the sound of the baby, still whining and bawling their little heart out, their small high pitch voice resonates throughout the space.
"You don't have to worry," said Albus, tugging his hand and smiled when Harry looked down to him as they walked behind the others. "You can trust our dad, he won't do anything unpleasant to papa."
"Says the person who's sneaking in the Gryffindor tower to send his love interest a fucking chocolate."
Malfoy frowned in annoyance, though there was some pink dust appearing on his cheeks. “I'll tell you once I meet him later in the future.”
Three small packages suddenly tossed to each of them and Harry smiled as he received his regular heart shaped chocolate and immediately sunk his teeth in it once he unwrapped it, humming in content as the delicious taste burst in his mouth.
“Yes, Draco.” said Henry, before he took a deep breath - with the familiarity that Draco can't put a finger to - and locked his earnest green eyes with Draco. “Do you trust me?”
Panicked and scared, he shut his eyes tightly and couldn't help the words that stumbled out of his mouth, "Please don't kill me, please don't kill me!"
He startled when Harry suddenly laughed, tensed when the man dropped his head on his shoulder, burying his face into his neck. He squeaked embarrassingly when he felt hot lips brushing his skin before his eyes met with a pair of green eyes full with mirth.
Not wanting to waste any more time, Draco excused himself without waiting for the man's reaction, not forgetting to send a quick waved of a finger to erase the man's memories of Draco. Just in case.
"What, it's still a night time?" asked Harry in surprise, dragging his eyes to look at their surroundings.
“I suppose so.” Harry imitated his action, nodding as he eyed his friends. “Are you okay with me kissing a bloke?”
"Good evening, professor." greeted Harry once he saw McGonagall peacefully sat behind her table, seeping her tea gracefully. She smiled at him when she looked up, putting her cup gently.
“Oh, I see it alright.” said Granger, leading them both to their table. “You know he's just playing along, right?” she frowned at him, the moment they took their seats.
He halted his steps and leaned his body against the wall, raising a hand to pinch the bridge of his nose as he forced himself to stay focused. This was not the time to be pathetic. His family needed him, his sons needed him, and Draco needed him. He heaved a determined breath at that, pushing his body away from the wall and continued his journey towards McGonagall's office.
If only Harry moved faster, if only Harry knew where to find Draco, if only he was not distracted by his own battle, if only he was there with Draco, he would have arrived much earlier, he would have manage to prevent it, he would have protected him, he would not have to witness the sight of the Elder Sword of Voldemort sunk right into the chest of his lover where his heart was placed, he would not have to witness the way the light in those grey eyes dimmed, he would not have to witness the way his precious body was tossed aside as if he was nothing.
He repressed a smile the second Draco rolled his eyes in annoyance, and decided to slowly step away from the two younger adults who were not aware of his existence at the moment. He shook his head when they continued to bicker; Draco hissing angrily whilst his younger self seemingly tried to find reasons between their arguments.
Specifically, they were filled with the thoughts of the owner of the name that Harry currently engrossed with on the Marauder's Map, who was probably sleeping soundly seeing that his name has been static ever since Harry has laid his eyes on it for the past few minutes.
"You wouldn't." teased Harry. "You know why? because- ah! You hexed me!" Harry gaped at the other male in disbelief.
It had been a rather peculiar day for Draco as he had never been sent two assignments in a week. In fact, it was not even a full two hours of his last assignment when he received another one. Draco, however, was not one to withdraw from a mere challenge and thus, here he was, currently working on his latest assignment.
Malfoy looked like he was desperate to say something, opening and closing his mouth and giving Harry a hopeless look. He inhaled suddenly, and exhaled before he babbled, "I took advantage of you without your consent, I am a Death Eater and you're the Saviour and I am bad, and I am sorry for doing bad things to you and everyone else and I shouldn't have done that and I am a bad person and you shouldn't have kissed me or even look at me, I am a bad person!"
Draco put his hands on the man's sturdy chest, looking up at him. Searching for his eyes. “I can't believe you.” He whispered.
"I want to sleep with you tonight." said Harry, not even raised his head and wrapped his hands around Draco.
“You don't have to.” Henry smiled, approaching slowly. “You're safe with me.” He said kindly, but Draco remained stiff in front of him.
Hermione huffed in irritation, “Well, which house do you think has been giving chocolates for the past two weeks?”
“Alright.” Potter agreed, “We'll be back soon.” He said and stood up, moving to the door. Before he walked out, he looked over his shoulder to give Draco a reassuring smile. “Don't worry, we can handle this.”
Malfoy’s shirt was dirty, signs that he's been down on the floor quite much, his buttoned shirt was open up to his chest showing those pale skin, and his hair was wild - long gone the perfect style hair. The look on his face was quite dangerous, Harry never saw it before, not even when it was them that was in a fight.
Draco felt his heart swelling in happiness, and he pressed his lips to control the big smile that threatened to escape. “Let me think first.”
“How come the both of you got two then?” Ron, who already took a bite on his own chocolate frowned in, eyeing Seamus and Dean's extra packages in their hands.
The sudden sound of a cleared throat made them jump and quickly pulled away from their sudden close proximity.
He sent Ron a confused look when the first years of Slytherin practically beamed at him when they caught his eyes, only to see that his friend was already by the table, waving crazily at him. Hastily, Harry marched towards him, blinking when Ron gestured at their table where hundreds of small packaged chocolates were literally lined up on the Gryffindor's table. He frowned, dragging his eyes around the Great Hall to see a similar situation seemed to take place.
Scorpius, on the other hand, was an eager child. He was practically vibrating with excitement the moment they stepped into the library; bouncing on the ball of his feet while dragging his wide eager eyes throughout the large space of the library. It was clear to Draco that Scorpius loved to read, loved to search for information and learn new things looking at his sparkled eyes when Draco brought the books. He knows where to start once he grabbed a book, and immediately fell into his reading.
Draco turned pale. “Y-You’re meant to say that there's a possibility that- that right now, I'm cursed?” His voice hitched at the end, chill spreading through his body.
“Can't we?” asked Albus, peering to Harry with wide innocent eyes, which instantly copied by Scorpius.
McGonagall slowly nodded, giving Harry a calculating look. "I thought it was a good thing, because it meant that his blood was pure?"
"Ah, yes." grinned Hermione. "Ginny had mentioned a certain heart shaped chocolates brought by Parkinson when she went to visit Malfoy, said his parcel has arrived. Malfoy got flustered, and that was when she hit Parkinson with Disillusionment Charm. It doesn't take a second for us to connect the dots."
He repressed a smirk, forcing his body to stay flaccid and continue to listen to the hushed conversation that was getting closer and stop in front of his bed.
The finger stopped their movement on his scar, and a hand landed on his cheek, just resting. "I… I know, I'm a coward for doing it this way. It's wrong, and- and really, I just- what am I doing?"
"Well, what do you expect, Harry?" McGonagall raised an eyebrow, amused. "They're your sons, after all."
“Are you okay?” asked Draco, because the scene in front of him looked out of place in his eyes. Like there was something they were hiding from him.
“I am sorry for my action, Mr. Potter and friends.” said Albus, managing to sound genuine. His brother, who stood next to him smiled politely, “We are very sorry, Albus did not mean to hurt your feelings.”
Ginny laughed, carefree and loud as she dropped both of her hands on his shoulders, and gazed down on him in a knowing look; bright and wide.
“My…" Draco began, "My sons?” his voice may have cracked a little but Salazar, what kind of joke was Merlin playing at?
“What?” Ron gasped, “Oh no, that can't happen! Come on, Harry.” He marched, just behind the two Slytherins and Harry sighed, running his fingers through his hair.
Harry grinned, heart palpitating weirdly and he quickly waved back. "You're welcome. Take care, Malfoy."
He gives himself a few moments to collect himself before he walks back towards his office, blinking in confusion when his table was full of stack of papers. He reaches for one of them, raising his brows to see it was an article from the Prophet, an article of Potter to be exact. He turns his gaze on the rest of the papers, skimming them briefly to see it was all about Potter.
“If you're worried that I might taint your blood, you don't have to worry.” Henry grinned, before he wiggled his eyebrows. “Even though it tempts me so much.”
“Headmistress, my name is Scorpius Hyperion Potter and this is my twin brother, Albus Severus Potter.” said Scorpius with determination. When McGonagall’s eyes widened with surprise, Scorpius immediately continued, “We are Harry Potter's sons.”
“Dad, stop flirting with papa.” called Albus, rolling his eyes. Scorpius turned to give Harry a pointed look, “See what we have to suffer everyday?”
Despite the confusion, Harry had to suppress a smile when he heard a faint sound of a skin being slapped.
McGonagall regarded the two boys, both eyes shining with hopes and she sighed internally, “May I ask what house of Hogwarts do you both prefer?”
Harry had laughed, amused by the situation and was gladly let Draco shut him by giving him the best snog in his life.
“I was just about to explain to the Headmistress about our situation when you arrived.” said Scorpius, silently asking Albus with his eyes. When Albus nodded, Scorpius turned his attention towards Headmistress McGonagall and smiled confidently.
Never had Harry desperately wished for the ground to swallow him whole. He was pretty much sure that his face could rival ripe tomatoes now.
"I've warned you." said Malfoy, "And I'll do worse if you didn't move your hands right on this instant."
"Figured so." said Draco, rolling his eyes in mild annoyance before he gave Harry a rather dramatic sigh. "Well then, since you were practically begging."
Scorpius couldn't help but laugh. "What made you think it didn't give me a headache, I had to choose where to go when they stood in the same room."
Harry was brought back to his senses by Draco's voice, and he blinked to see that Draco was still pretending to be interested in his inspection towards his robe, so Harry decided to be a bit cheeky. He shifted to put his weight on his right foot, and he gave Draco a look as he crossed his arms together. "You stand there half naked, and I couldn't do anything about it. Can you really blame me, though?"
Draco swallowed, willing himself to calm down when the sudden words made him feel agitated. “I'm ready.”
He was satisfied when Draco flushed even more, his face went alarmingly red. His little husband's eyes were wide as saucers, as he looked at Harry with stupefaction, clearly surprised by Harry's words. "You're- you're shameless!"
"My, my, Potter." said Draco, tone was teasing. "We haven't had our first date yet and you want to sleep with me already."
When the two boys shared a look, McGonagall can't help the strange instincts that she knows the identity of their other father.
. ‘Right. Well I guess I’ll just go then? I’ve shown my face, helped you out with your mum, been dropped a load of ominous hints about some obvious trauma you’ve got that I can’t ask abou-’
Draco strode towards a (very tall, very broad, very handsome) man at the other end of the aisle they were currently in, and tackled him into a hug. Both of them were grinning wildly, Harry was not.
‘Andi! What on earth are you doing here? Don’t tell me I double booked? I’ve got a meeting in five minutes.’
‘Bu- but can you not request a change? A- a- or go to Kingsley?’ Ron was gobsmacked it seemed, unable to process the news of Harry’s misfortune and unable to make his way through a sentence without stumbling over the words.
Harry, we were fifteen when we decided that! Surely you got enough dark wizard action with old Voldy to last you a lifetime? I know I have!’ He took a big gulp of his butterbeer. ‘Or I supposed it’s two lifetimes in your case, what with the whole he killed you and you came back to life to kill him thing?’
with him and Teddy. If only Malfoy hadn’t said yes! They should have just kept it simple: git shows up, git comes in, git hands over invitation, git has parole meeting, git leaves. Simple, no kisses, no one feels sick.
A secret stag? Draco racked his memory, trying to come up with some kind of reasoning behind it, hadn’t there been something about a stag with one of Potter’s most infamous spells?
They’d decided not to tell their other friends the truth, to keep the secret as close as possible. Harry didn’t look too closely into that, either.
‘When, er, when will it start to move?’ Trying to distract himself more effectively, Harry thought it might be best for him to find out what exactly the process of getting a magical was.
Harry had been pacing and stewing for just under twenty-four hours now. Twenty-two hours and thirty seven minutes to be precise. Twenty-two hours and thirty seven minutes since Malfoy had kissed him and stormed almost immediately out of his flat.
I did have a lil flashback in here of Harry and Charlie's lil ~get together~ but it made the chapter way longer than I wanted it to be so I've decided to post it as a oneshot/aside kind of thing that you can read if you want but it's not really vital to anything else, just a bit of self-indulgent HP/CW because I love them (but just a lil snog and then a tactful ending because I've never written sexy stuff and I'm scared) so I'll post that at some point in the future if you wanna check that out when I do!
‘If my employment is so obviously snooze-worthy, how am I to know you won’t doze off yet again?’ He snapped at Harry.
that Malfoy stay and watch the film? And then stay even longer for a drink? It was ridiculous! All that flirting and teasing Malfoy subjected him to was clearly getting to him and Harry had allowed the git to
, the invitation! How could Harry have forgotten he was supposed to go to Malfoy’s stupid birthday party tomorrow? And who still had “birthday parties” at the ripe old age of twenty one?
That didn’t stop Teddy from dancing like a loon in front of Malfoy though, and he completed a thoroughly spectacular jump onto the sofa between Harry and Malfoy at the end of the song, giggling the entire time.
comments/kudos appreciated as always and I will work very hard to not wait such a long time before updating again xoxo
Looking around the room, Draco saw generations and generations of his family history told on the walls, each and every member of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Black woven into the seemingly never-ending tapestry. But he couldn’t help but notice the markings that seemed to decorate the bottom.
‘No you shouldn’t,’ he said, finally, unsurprisingly feeling relieved at Draco’s reaction. ‘It would violate your parole. You
. It seemed like every inch of Malfoy’s arms were covered in them, and Harry was suddenly very grateful that Malfoy hadn’t decided on a long sleeved top when he got dressed this morning. Harry could even see the tips of a couple of tattoos curling around Malfoy’s neck, and all of a sudden he wanted nothing more in the world than to see exactly where they led to.
‘Oh! No, honestly it’s fine. It seems to be a flat thing as Blaise was ill all last week and Theo went down a few days before I did, so we can all look after each other. Besides, I’m highly contagious, right?’
‘Hold still, Potter.’ Draco took out his wand. The charm was, arguably, the easiest part about magical tattoos; it was straightforward and easy to learn, and took very little energy or concentration compared to other spells, as long as you pointed your wand in the right direction.
Draco is thankful that his traitorous mouth doesn’t release the snort he so desperately wants to make, but he is disappointed in himself for allowing the corners of his mouth to twitch upwards ever so slightly. He has appearances to uphold, after all.
looking over to where Draco was sat), so it was a great relief to finally be out from under that pale, unnerving, grey gaze. Draco was very much like his aunt in that respect, Harry thought; it must be the Black blood in them, all aristocratic and well-bred and snooty.
But it turns out, Draco opening up, even just a little, was enough for all of Harry’s common sense and willpower to disappear.
‘No can do, mate, I already went to Robards and he said it was signed off by Kingsley too. Saw him come out of a meeting with Robards just before I went in actually.’ Harry turned to look at Hermione at this: she still looked guilty at this, and wasn’t meeting Harry’s eye.
Making his way back into the room, he could see Potter still fixed onto his wrist. As Draco took it back into his own hands, he heard Potter’s sharp intake of breath and felt rather than saw his eyes snap up to lock onto the top of Draco’s head.
idea to move their weekly meetings from Potter’s office at the ministry to any place around London that took Potter’s fancy. It’d been Potter that had insisted McLaggan and Thorpe be reprimanded for those stinging hexes, and Draco was glad he hadn’t seen them since for fear of what they would retaliate with. He felt like he was hiding behind Potter’s auror skirts and he didn’t like it one bit.
‘Because, Auror Potter, I said so. Any further grievances you have with the way I have assigned paroles can be taken up with the office of the Minister for Magic.’
Draco blinked, completely shocked at the surprise turn of conversation. Recovering quickly, Draco switched back on the teasing smirk.
in his cell. His hair had been long and dirty, his face a sallow yellow colour, and gaunt, with the skin sagging over his once proud and prominent cheekbones. It had reminded Harry of the pictures the
‘Yes it is, I’m telling you that it is. It was just something I made Draco agree to, to get the press off my back. I thought it’d be a bit of a laugh.’
‘No, I… of course I did. I just- I mean- I didn’t think you were working today?’ Harry managed to squeak out. Malfoy’s casual flippance with French did nothing to help out Harry’s ability to think clearly.
Draco couldn’t help but smile. ‘Right well I’ll leave you to it for a few minutes for the charms to settle in with the ink and your own magic, and I’ll get the protective film to wrap it up and a cream for you to use whilst it heals.’
‘There’s only so much skele-gro and chocolate frogs can mend. The kind of scars I got in Azkaban? You can’t see them, but I feel them. Every second of every day.’
‘This is amazing, Andi, honestly. You’ve been talking about wanting to get back in touch for years now. I’m so happy you’re reconnecting.’
‘Honestly Potter, I don’t know why you’re insisting on forcing yourself through the training, you’ve got the most experience in the wizarding world.’ Robards frowned at him over the Auror training request forms Harry had thrust upon his desk. ‘Not to mention your honorary N.E.W.T.s from Headmistress McGonnagall, and your - frankly - glowing letter of recommendation from the Minister of Magic.’
As if he had been hit with a stinging hex, Draco leapt up from his seat. Shooting Potter the most aggrieved glare he could possibly muster, Draco spun around on his heels and marched out of the room, not caring a second for Potter’s feeble calls to stay for the remaining few minutes of their meeting. As fucking if.
“Watching”, as it turned out, didn’t mean a play in the theatre, and was in reference to a muggle “film” that Potter programmed into the box he had called a “teevee”. It was all very odd and muggle and Draco had no idea what most of the words meant, but the film itself was most enjoyable; there were genies, sorcery, and an evil man who reminded him a lot of the Dark Lord.
‘Fine, P. Just queasy. Don’t wanna be here.’ Draco tried to smile back at him as he took a sip of his drink, but he didn’t have to look into a mirror to know it was more of a grimace.
‘And are you drunk? I thought you were having a parole meeting not emptying a bar, Draco!’ Draco caught the eye of his mother and immediately regretted it; the storm behind her eyes was not one to be trifled with.
‘Look mate, it’s getting late anyway and I’ve obviously had more than enough. I’ll probably see you for lunch at the Burrow on Sunday or some other time, but I need to go. I’ve got a load of shit to sort out before I get back to training on Monday morning. Damn weekend breaks are never long enough.’
dragon-taming Weasley brother. Then, Harry supposed, there was the upcoming date with Sam to contend with.
wisp of a sentence he caught, cheeks burning slightly at the distinct knowledge that he’d been staring.
He sighed again, and stood to wash up his tea cup in the sink. He didn’t see P nearly as often as he’d like, not anymore, but their weekly phone conversations were just enough to get him through one visit to the next. He dried the tea cup and placed it back into the cupboard.
‘Because I have tiny hands, papa,’ Edward whispered back at him. Draco won’t pretend that his baby cousin calling Potter “papa” didn’t make his heart swell.
Potter gasped as the bright white tendrils of Draco’s magic snaked their way around his wrist, stroking their way along the edges of the stag before thrusting themselves into the very ink, which seemed to throb and pulse with the new energy from within it. The stag began by stomping its front hooves and shaking out its antlers, before taking a few tentative steps along Potter’s wrist bone, the movements making Potter hiss at the new sensations. Draco was no virgin when it came to tattoos, and he had a few magical ones himself; he had to admit, you never quite forgot the tingling thrill of a magical tattoo moving for the first time.
before the twist of apparition took ahold of him. They landed solidly in the living room of their flat, with only a slight stumble from Harry which he was taking no responsibility for. Instead, he looked over at Draco, still holding his hand, to continue the giggles that had followed them out of the pub with their friends.
In the four years Malfoy had been imprisoned, Harry had only made the trip out to the North Sea once. And even then, it was only as part of an Auror-training field trip; Harry had absolutely no desire to see the faces of all those Voldemort supporters - marked and unmarked - that he’d helped put away in those couple of months after the war. He especially hadn’t intended to catch a glimpse of Malfoy through the bars of his cell as he walked past.  It was only thanks to Kingsley's influence that he had been permitted to use Polyjuice potion as a disguise as he walked around, so as to not rile up the Death Eaters and whatnot, that Malfoy hadn’t glimpsed him back.
‘No, Draco. If anything, I took advantage of you; I basically forced you into this. I might not have known about your feelings, but it was wrong of me, and I’m sorry. I wish you’d told me you were gay, though, you know I’d never had a problem with it - or with you. You’re my best friend in the whole world, D; I don’t want to lose you.’
He sighed. ‘Look, Potter. Thanks for coming and helping me save face with my mother. Especially after… what happened.’ Potter pulled a face at that, as if he couldn’t quite believe that Draco had remembered it - that it was real - let alone that Draco had actually, consciously brought it up.
And with that, Harry choked a laugh, downed the rest of his butterbeer and tried not to let Ron see the tears threatening to fall. Harry left the pub, waving a goodbye to Rosmerta and the rest of the eighth years, and apparated away the second he reached a dark enough alleyway, completely missing the resigned, worried look Ron gave him, watching him the whole way.
Draco made his way into the drawing room to wave goodbye before heading out of the door, but was stopped before he could leave.
? Harry shook his head. He didn’t care, and he refused to look up from his desk to properly check. Malfoy probably thought it made him look eccentric or some hippogriff shit.
. Malfoy had obviously been out of Azkaban long enough to recover from the starvation diet and malnutrition, the pointed angles had softened, but still looked like they could cut if you brushed along them. The luminous silver of his hair was blonder,
‘Black, of course. It’s mother’s maiden name anyway so all she has to do is request new documents in  her maiden name. I’ll have to appeal through the ministry to change my own name, though I’m sure I’ll meet a splendid amount of resistance to that.
And with that, Draco walked away, not caring if Potter followed or stayed in that corner or left the house. Draco just knew he had to walk far
The sleeve on his left arm was what made Harry stare the most though. There was, of course, the Dark Mark pride of place in the centre of his forearm, but instead of the pulsating black it had been when Harry had glimpsed it on top of the astronomy tower back in sixth year, it was grey and faded and almost blurry around the edges. Malfoy had decorated and partially covered it by surrounding it with flowers. Narcissus, pansies, roses, forget-me-nots and even a singular lily right at the bottom (which made Harry feel something quite indiscernible to think about why he would possibly have chosen that), all in such bright vibrant colours that the grey of the Dark Mark faded into almost nothing. Along the rest of Malfoy’s arm were seemingly random pieces of ink, all overlapping but not covering each other; a snitch was flying around some Quidditch goalposts on him inner bicep, a great mass of fire in the shape of a snake curling its way down from his shoulder periodically, and a series of moon cycles and stars set out in various constellations scattered along the top of his forearm.
‘I don’t think you’re gay. We think you’re more like bisexual- maybe pan? It doesn’t really matter. But you should see the way you look at him, Harry. It’s the same way I look at Ron, or Dean looks at Seamus. Mrs Weasley looks at Mr Weasley! Surely you must’ve noticed the way that you’re constantly aware of him when he’s in the room. The way that you gravitate towards him. The way that you seek his approval with everything that you say. For Godric’s sake, the way you reacted when you heard about the Diagon attack - just because the shop he works in is on Diagon Alley! Like a man possessed, Ron said.’
‘That’s what I was worried about.’ But Ron’s voice was already fading as he made his way back inside, the back door and it’s yellow light closing behind him.
, Draco would have to give him a proper lesson in owning clothing of appropriate lengths to fit his body. A nicely tailored shirt would suit Potter much better than the muggle garments he usually wears, anyway, not to mention it would be much more office appropriate. Draco always could appreciate a handsome man in a well-tailored suit.
And with that, Draco stood as quickly as he could (whilst still remaining polite, of course) and tried his very best to not run from the room, but he was certain that he couldn’t have got out of that room faster if he’d apparated. His childhood rival had almost just
He walked the mugs back over to the sofa where Draco was sitting, and got only a small ‘Thanks,’ as he handed over the perfect tea, before sitting down in the chair opposite. They sat drinking their tea in silence; Draco wincing every time his side moved too quickly, and Harry watching on in silent desperation to help. A whole six minutes passed before Draco spoke again. ‘You know, one day you’re going to get me killed… remind me why we’re friends again?’
Setting his teacup down onto the kitchen table, he thought back to the mornings he had spent outside, sat at the small bistro table his mother had set up on the terrace, drinking countless cups of tea with his mother and Patch - if he got a day off - and eating the various pastries he brought over to sate his sweet tooth.
Harry started in on his paperwork, stretching the truth yet again and signing off that Malfoy had stayed for the entire duration of their meeting. It was probably all Harry’s fault that he didn’t anyway, it usually was when someone stormed out upset, he just couldn’t seem to figure out what it was this time that had upset Draco so thoroughly when really, Harry had just been doing them both a favour.
had ripped him away from parents who might have loved him, who might have given him a loving home. This evil wizard was the reason Harry had grown up in Privet Drive, and raised by Uncle Vernon.
‘Oooh, Friday the 13th, Potter! Better watch out, a big bad death eater might come and bring you three pieces of bad luck!’ Draco strolled into the tiny restaurant Potter had chosen for this week's meeting, completely ignoring the host at the stand in favour of his chosen one and earnt himself glares from all involved.
‘Don’t sit down, Malfoy. Our meeting won’t be in the ministry today.’ Harry was already marching out of the office door before Malfoy had even finished walking through it.
It had been two weeks since Draco had given Potter - yes, still Potter, despite the flirting, he hadn’t earned that privilege
‘So don’t believe me, Potter. See if I give a shit about it. Send me back to Azkaban for it if you really want.’ Harry looked up at that, something about Malfoy’s tone seemed dejected.
Malfoy still eyed him with mistrust, but let the subject go. Or, he would have let it go, if Harry wasn’t one to act upon every single, tiny, little, annoying Gryffindor impulse.
But then Malfoy had gone off on one about Malfoy honour and Harry embarrassing him and maybe teasing hadn’t been the right way to go?
‘But Char, no one sees past the scar. It’s been four years since the end of the war and I still can’t walk down the street without getting my photo taken. Even if I
Luckily for Harry, Luke was a true friend and just nodded understandingly at him before narrowing his eyes at the back of Sam’s unsuspecting head. Harry had to stifle a smirk whilst still in full view of Sam, but he had a feeling that Sam was in for a nasty bit of discipline from his boss there, if not being fired with immediate effect for losing the cafe’s most famous patron.
‘I’m sure others will agree that it was a little more than a “lucky shot with a disarming spell”, Potter, but I suppose I have to respect your wishes here. If you’re absolutely insisting, then there’s no point in my reasoning with you.’ He stamped the parchment in front of him and passed it over to Harry.
, Harry nodded. The explanation made sense, without the charms the tattoos would just be plain old muggle tattoos. He’ll admit, the whole thought of having his little zoo trotting around his arm was mostly the main reasoning behind his wanting the tattoos in the first place. Having tiny representations of his dad, Sirius, and Remus running around a bed of lilies and keeping him company, and matching to his moods? Harry couldn’t wait.
If he was being honest with himself, he’d wanted Malfoy to kiss him ever since he’d sat down in that tattoo chair. Or when he’d seen Malfoy sitting in his office. Or at some point in sixth year when he’d been stalking Malfoy around the castle just for a glimpse of him. Who could say which it was, really.
to look at. Then the tendrils thrust themselves into the ink itself and Harry hissed at the shock of it. Still pulsing as the magic took effect, the stag began to stomp its front hooves and shake out its antlers, before taking a few tentative steps along his wrist bone. He was sure he’d never forget the sight of this, the feeling of the new ink on his wrist being imbued with magic, for the rest of his days.
And it was there, watching Harry sodding Potter walk away from the parlour, left wrist wrapped up in protective film, right hand clasping the healing cream, that Draco allowed himself to acknowledge for the first time just how attractive he really was.
He stood abruptly, almost knocking his chair to the floor behind him. His eyes were wild, his hair even wilder. Harry stumbled out of the café, not unlike a new-born fawn trialling out its legs for the first time.
He knew he was excited, this was his first actual proper date in a year and a half! And it’s not like Sam wasn’t easy on the eyes, with his bright blue eyes, and his soft, floppy blond hair.
‘Does that mean you were never one of my “quivering fans”, then?’ Draco scoffed at him. ‘Ah, right. You were just swayed by my dashing good looks, then?’
Harry’s mind was reeling, trying to take in everything Hermione was saying. He could more-or-less understand why Draco had never told him about being gay, now; Harry would do anything to keep Draco in his life, too. But then there was the-
‘Now we know why you had to move out, Ron. Those two have obviously been pining after each other all these years.’
Harry knew that any other parole officer would have reprimanded Malfoy long before now, and he probably would have been back in Azkaban already. But he remembered the reasoning Hermione had had behind assigning Malfoy to him, took a deep breath, and set about writing up the paperwork for the meeting already, keeping a watchful eye on his charge and his godson. Only half an hour to go before he could legally tell Malfoy to piss right off.
the tattoo? The stretch Potter had made to reach a new jar of ink hadn’t been enough to reveal the entire thing to Draco, but he certainly wasn’t about to stoop so low as to
. And besides, Liam was an old family friend, no need for Harry to get jealous over nothing. Not that Draco was exactly sure of a reason Harry could have been jealous to begin with.
He’d followed Malfoy into the bathroom - just like he’d followed him everywhere all year - and almost killed him after finding him in tears. Malfoy had been
Sighing to himself, Harry gave a small smile. ‘No, chemistry is great. Good thing you brought all your stuff, I’ll need to share.’
But as happy as Harry was, he couldn’t quite shake the feeling of jealousy when he looked at his two best friends wrapped back up in each other and their baby bubble. How lucky they had been to fall in love with their best friend, to fit together so well, to understand what the other was thinking and dreaming before they even did themselves.
Patch had arrived a few minutes ago, but it had done little to sooth his nerves; Draco was still flooded with the feelings of nausea and terror that threatened to take over, that only increased in intensity as the clock ticked closer and closer to the arrival of his guests. And
All he could hear was Potter’s breathing getting heavier, all he could smell was the fire whiskey on Potter’s breath, all he could see was Potter’s lips parting slightly as they got closer.
‘No no! Mister Potter, no need to do that. Draco here was just having a little practical joke, weren’t you, Draco?’ The man laughed and gave Malfoy such a pointed look that Harry was sure he’d have been scared of if he’d been on the receiving end, auror training or not.
‘Hm, I’ll make sure to let Luke know next time I see him.’ Harry sat back in his seat, letting the warmth of the mocha seep into his fingers.
‘Can you do that or not? It’s either you have your meeting in my flat, or have it with another auror like McLaggan or Thorpe and we both know you wouldn’t want that now, would you?’
‘So.’ Ron slid the bottle of butterbeer over to him, as well as a shot of firewhiskey, which Harry promptly downed. ‘You will not believe who Minnie’s got teaching Defence this year,
‘You alright? I’m not hurting you am I?’ His eyes were filled with an emotion indiscernible for Harry.
It really was hippogriff shit. It wasn’t even like anything was ever going to happen between them; Harry was Malfoy’s
? Honestly, what was Potter thinking? Draco raised one singular eyebrow in what he knew would show as a highly unamused expression.
If you do not wish to read this chapter, or you think it may be triggering for you, PLEASE DON’T. I think the warning, the knowledge that it happens in Azkaban, and the knowledge of how people treated Death Eaters after the war, will give enough of an indication of the plot, that you do not need to read the section I’ve written on this for this chapter. There will be other mentions of Draco's trauma in following chapters but I will put chapter warnings at the beginning (just like this one) for those who do not wish to read them.
‘Not quite. This is an hour long meeting for a reason, Malfoy. Why don’t you talk me through your week?’
‘Malfoy, come in and sit down.’ Potter was stood up and facing away from Draco as he came into the room, putting some book back onto his shelving, giving Draco the most
‘Ugh, don’t make me think about it!’ Ron and Seamus had been poking fun at them all evening, but now that everyone was collecting coats to leave the pub, the comments had taken on a decidedly more
When Harry was eighteen years and one month old, his worst enemy was the wizarding world that he’d given his life to save.
‘It is not up to you to demand “why” of me, Potter, but it is for you to obey the orders you’re given. Unless, that is, you no longer wish to become a fully qualified auror?’
‘Alright, fine!’ He raised his hands up in surrender, ‘it’s all been going fine, honestly! But we had our meeting yesterday and - you know I put in a request with Kinsley and Robards to have the outside of the ministry? -’
Patch just grinned at him, knowing full well the thoughts going on in Draco’s head. ‘C’mon birthday boy, let’s go greet your guests.’
‘If I could possibly get a word in, Potter? How can I respond when you seem to talk a mile a minute?’
‘Go take a seat, I’ll bring it over to you,’ Sam winked at him and was turned back around to make the coffee before Harry could even register it.
Being as gentle as he could be, Draco took the wrapping and encased Potter’s wrist completely. Whilst the stag had been charmed, it wouldn’t be able to make it’s way beyond the wrist before being fully healed, but it could still circle the wrist if it so desired.
Potter looked just as stunned as Draco had felt in giving a reply without snark or biting comment. Draco wasn’t entirely sure what had come over him; he couldn’t recall ever speaking to Potter with anything other than malice, or complete disinterest in his parole meetings.
‘Gods, I have to go to him! I have to- I need to tell him.’ He tugged his hands through his hair. ‘I need to tell him.’
He walked back to stand between numbers eleven and thirteen. ‘How the hell am I supposed to find number twelve, Potter you unbelievable imbecile?’
Hermione winced at that, ‘I know it wasn’t the best move, Harry, but it all moved so quickly once I’d had the initial idea and mentioned it to Kingsley. It all happened in no time at all and before I knew it Draco was out of Azkaban and on his way to your office!’ she turned to her husband, ‘and I
He cringed inwardly and tried not to let it show on his face, but Sam’s expression faded from anxious into one of confusion. Taking a deep breath, Harry tried again at half the speed.
‘Alright, love. Let’s get you off home to bed.’ Ron smiled at his wife, a smile so soft and fond and private that Harry almost felt like he was intruding, and had to look away for a second.
‘Oh. That makes more sense I guess.’ Harry’s voice trailed off towards the end, and he looked down at his feet. Every mention of Malfoy being in Azkaban brought waves of guilt with it; he hadn’t done enough, should’ve worked harder to keep him out, should’ve thrown his name around to get the sentence reduced to house arrest instead.
