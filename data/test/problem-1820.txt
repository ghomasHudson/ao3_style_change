Draco nodded and felt his smile start to fade. “Speaking of which, how are we going to spend Christmas? I know you want to go over to the Weasley’s.” He was still stuck on his fantasy of waking up Christmas morning and spending it with Harry since he couldn't see his mother or his friends until the afternoon.
Luna smiled, “Draco’s right. You two were meant for each other. It’s rare to see something like that.”
They would try to encourage Dean and Seamus to get together, trying to make their relationship begin as organically as possible. If that didn’t work, they would expose their feelings to each other. They knew that something as rash and blatant as that would be hard to ignore or write off. But if Dean and Seamus still beat around the bush, they would try locking them in a room together. The truth serum was their final solution.
“The Ministry throws a Yule ball every year. Maybe Harry will take you.” Pansy suggested with a hopeful tone.
Draco smirked down at Harry and began grinding down on him. He moved his hips back and forth, side to side, and swirled them around to try and find his favorite spots. “You’re, oh. B-Bit bigger than I expected.”
Harry found himself at a loss. He was throbbing and he could feel precum leaking out of himself. “Need any help?” He offered, wanting to speed things along. He was only seconds away from moving to touch himself.
to make a withdrawal to afford the present, but he figured he might as well since he planned on spending a lot on Draco.
He finally understood. “Sounds like you have a hard time bottoming. I could hold you down if it would make you feel better.” He offered playfully and with a wink.
“Then don’t ask questions like that. Use your imagination and I’m certain you could figure it out. Now come on, I want eggs and toast for breakfast.” He insisted, ready to start the day.
He looked up to see Draco had entered the sitting room, crouched slightly to see Harry sitting in the Floo.
He was happy, but he was also so angry. How did one fifth of Wizengamot think it was acceptable to keep discrimination legal? He couldn't understand.
Harry willed his away and Draco eventually got up to fix his in the shower. He had to spent his first day of break in the hospital wing. He and a few of his coworkers decided to meet up on the first day of break and brew a bunch of medicines so they would have a good stock for the end of year antics that always occur. Pranks, fights, even sleep deprived accidents. It’s unavoidable.
"Astoria? Love, you're in the hospital." He said as he gave a quick check of her vitals. "My name is Kai, I'm just checking up on you."
“Dad?” He questioned. Harry rarely ever used the word. He never had anyone to call dad before, so it felt weird using it even though he was talking to his father.
Pureblood marriages were about blood and inheritance. Everyone knew that if they were to keep their place in society and in the family, their options were limited. Most pureblood couples were best friends or sweetheart from Hogwarts. Their only options were to try to fall in love, languish in a loveless marriage, or give up their old lives to marry someone of a lower status.
It made Draco feel better about how he was doing as a boyfriend. But he didn’t want Harry selling himself short either. “You say that as if you haven’t done most of that for me as well.”
The blonde took the noodle and felt a bit silly. Nevertheless, he flicked it at the wall, and it stuck. “It’s done!” He seemed quite surprised and proud of himself.
“Right! I don’t know who he expects to do all the housework. It certainly won’t be me!” Draco ranted as he packed the last of his things. Besides the furniture, he’s fit all his belongings into two suitcases.
Andromeda smiled at Teddy and looked at him with loving eyes as she spoke, “Yes, it’s been lovely. Give it a few months and he’ll be cursing like a sailor.” She then turned back to Harry and Draco. “But, thank you. Both of you.”
It all came to a head one afternoon when he heard his mother shouting, “No! I’ll never agree to this! He’s our son!”
Harry sent it off to his friend and somehow they felt better now that it was gone. It was out of their hands. That made it easier in a way that neither of them quite understood. Though they felt better, the house became uncharacteristically silent and still. It was as if they just didn’t know what to do with themselves. They both had things in mind that they could do, but neither really wanted to move. They were stuck at the table, soaking in what they had just done. The relief turned to terror. Everyone would know. It was no longer their little secret in their private little bubble. It could change things and they didn’t want their lives to change again. It changed once and they handled it beautifully. They didn’t know if they’d get so lucky again.
Harry returned to the couch and they drank their hot cocoa in silence, both soaking in the moment. It was warm, a soft holiday song in the background, snowing, the room cozy, their bodies hit with heat at each sip. Everything was perfect, and their minds wandered.
The blonde pulled away and smirked down at his lover. “You aren’t a virgin, I can tell. You’re just gentle. You’ve always had loving sex, yea?”
He looked down at the man under him. Muscled, tanned, and scarred. He was the definition of an indulgence and Draco couldn’t believe he had the man inside of him. He rolled his hips around, using him like a toy to rub his favorite places.
She let out a chuckle and let her eyes wander over to the door, as if she could still see Harry's figure standing there. "He looks much better without the robes he had to wear at Hogwarts and in Wizengamot. Finally has something that fits him proper."
Now Harry’s face was glowing red. “Draco! Shut up!” He sounded scandalized. “You’re in the hospital. Don’t say things like that in public.“
Teddy had been sorted into Hufflepuff all those years ago. The map had been activated and in Harry’s pocket that day, Remus was there for the ceremony and he was so proud to say his son was a Hufflepuff, just like his wife. He couldn’t have been happier.
Demgass' copy was passed to Draco, along with a quill. ‘Draco Potter-Malfoy’ was written in a big beautiful cursive, but the 'Potter' was a bit awkward, as he wasn't used to writing the word. He wordlessly pushed the document and quill to Harry. ‘Harry Potter-Malfoy’ was written in a small and timid cursive. His letters were close and tight.
Harry had a meeting with the finance team the next day and was told that the department was doable within the annual allowance given to all the departments by the Ministry. He was incredibly thankful and the news felt like a breath of fresh air compared to what happened the day before. However, it would need a bit of money to kickstart the beginning. It was a four thousand Galleon kickstart and Harry didn’t even blink twice.
Harry did this in every debate. He built his arguments, remained calm and reasonable, had a will to compromise, and pushed Wizengamot to get things done faster. Because of him, news came out of many laws being created and altered.
The magic of those grey eyes were absolutely captivating. All the flares of light and depths of something darker and deeper. They pulled him in and he didn’t even realize he had leaned closer. Harry felt as if he could fall into those eyes.
“I wasn’t trying to figure it out!” There was a tension between them that had never been there before. Even their first day wasn’t like this. On that first day, they were both scared, but right now, they were angry. “Seamus just recognized it and went on about how he liked the book.” Every suppressed frustration Harry's had about the situation was starting to resurface bubble over.
Harry held him through it. He stopped stroking but still thrusted into him, letting him ride out his pleasure. He moaned and whimpered of Draco’s beauty, telling him that he was perfect. “I’ve got you, I’ve got you love. Oh, you’re so lovely.” A blush spread across his face as he realized he was getting incredibly close. “J-Just, ah! C-Can I, mm. A bit longer.” He was slowly growing more and more unintelligible.
They could have laid there for hours, but they soon had to get ready for their afternoon apart. While Draco went to get dressed, Harry snuck into the kitchen and pulled out a nearly-complete Christmas pudding. He put it in a saucepan of simmering water and left it there as it would take quite a few hours to finish. Just enough time for him to spend the afternoon with the Weasleys.
"If you don't mind, I could go ahead and get the lights for the tree." Harry offered, wanting an excuse to give Draco and Pansy a bit of time alone.
Draco blinked a few times, trying to get past the unsettling statement, but he couldn't. “How much food do you usually eat now?”
“You came home for Christmas and amidst your complaining, you talked about Harry Potter’s eyes for a solid eight minutes.”
"Yea, she would talk about you all the time." He bit his lip. "She knew you were innocent, she always did. I think everyone knew you were, but she was the only one who said it out loud. Even my mum would scoff whenever she saw articles about how you had escaped and were a dangerous criminal. I only had Andromeda's stories to go off of, but I never thought you really could have done it."
“I forgot tomorrow is Valentine’s Day.” She sounded stressed and looked concerned. Harry was immediately ready to help.
The hand on his chest flew away and rested on his hip instead. It was a shallow victory, but a victory nonetheless. “Good boy.” He wanted to rub it in.
“I’ve been good. You?” Draco’s response was in a casual tone, but he felt so extremely awkward. He used to bully Seamus, and now they were having a friendly conversation. He almost couldn't believe it.
Harry rolled his eyes but relented. He sat on the edge on his bed. “There. I’m relaxed. Can I leave now?”
He climbed up onto his bed and he opened the journal. He smiled when he was the first page was written in crayon,
Harry and Draco didn’t get much sleep that night. They didn’t really talk, they didn’t laugh, they didn’t cry, and they weren’t tired in the slightest. They were just silent and let their emotions sit inside of themselves. All the regrets and sadness that they had already shared. They let it be.
They both celebrated at the idea that their daydream of being coworkers at Hogwarts was coming true. It was as if luck was on their side.
Draco wrote while Harry watched, and together, they figured their story out. They weren’t very proud of where it began but it ended with something nice. They did love each other. It took months for them to get to where they are now and they’re proud of it. They worked until there was nothing left to be said.
comes down to politics. Politics are what start and stop it all. We can't leave any room for another Voldemort to come along. If your bill doesn't go through, it'll take an average of twenty years for someone else to pick it up and try again. A lot can happen in twenty years. Voldemort happened in less. I know it doesn't seem that serious, but it is. Some of these older members are as radical as they come. All they need is the smallest chance and they'll try to pass something extreme."
He eyed Draco suspiciously for the rest of class, standing closer to Seamus than normal, even wrapping his arm around the boy’s shoulders.
Draco also made sure to tell Neville that Hannah did fancy him, Neville thanked him and turned pink. He was grinning the rest of the night.
It was actually quite a dark and troubling set of arguments that Harry put up, but in the end, it was enough to make everyone see that Draco had never really been a bad guy. At least, not of his own will. The charges were dropped and Draco was set free. Draco was under the blissful impression that he and his mother might be the last of the Malfoy line. That they would rebuild their name, that Draco would have an heir, and they would start anew.
He pulled out the next as Harry finished cutting up the fruit. “This one is about two friends in the Ministry who uncover a scandal about the Minister for Magic, and they have to very carefully foil all her plots without giving away that it’s them and that they know she’s evil. It’s so cute, I think it’s suppose to be like a comedy. It’s called A Scandal in Bavaria, which is where the story takes place.”
“I really like him. I’ve never liked anyone this much before and I don’t want to get together only for everything to get messed up and we both end up hurt.”
Harry’s features were taken over by a nervous smile. “Well, I do extensively study the dark arts. And the restricted section has some very interesting forms of magic. Including things that a human shouldn’t be able to do, but can if they know a few little tricks.”
Harry stumbled into his sitting room with an apology already on his tongue. He saw Draco was sitting on the sofa, reading a book, hardly even noticing him. “I’m so sorry I’m late. Shacklebolt put me and Hermione on a new project, we’ve spent all day trying to figure this out, and we have no clue what we’re doing.” His voice was dripping with stress, but he still felt guilty.
“It's fine. He's the head of house, you couldn't've stopped him.” Typically, the title of the head of a House wasn't used to commit abuse or atrocities, it was usually quite meaningless, but Lucius was invoking all its rights and powers.
Before Harry ever grew a backbone and made his speeches, Wizengamot went through a period of arguing all the time, and feeding off of each other's nonsense. That seemed to be the tactic favored by Luther's followers. He sat back and smiled as a group of maybe six or seven wizards went around with the theory that Harry was trying to introduce a restrictive new form of government that would watch everything that everyone did in order to monitor whether or not someone was being abusive, and it would lead to generations of sensitive pansies, and that he's being a baby, and anyone supporting him was letting wizard society being run into the ground.
Draco scoffed and looked bewildered at the idea. “Why would he take me? We may be married, but it’s only a social arrangement.”
Draco's spent enough time around the elite fakes to know when someone is too busy inside of their own head to pay attention to the real world. "What are you thinking about?"
“Nope, tomorrow is Sunday, no classes anyways." Draco gave a sly grin, "Let’s talk more about the library. I know you two didn’t spend all that time looking for books on finances. If you were, you would of done it in the day.”
“Tell him that I’m going to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts. Tell him about all the witches and wizards who have been thrown in Azkaban for their crimes. Tell him that the number of Dementors in the world has gone down. Tell him they don’t survive that long outside of Azkaban. When he died, I-“ He looked away, thankful that Draco was gone because he wasn’t proud of what happened. “When he died, I tried to kill Bellatrix. Tell him that I didn’t let her win!” He let out a few soft cries as he tried to regain control of himself.
"Uh, yea. He helped reform the Ministry shortly after Voldemort’s defeat. He's done great things.” Harry was a bit thrown off, but he went with it.
After working to settle the lawsuit, Harry found himself outside for a short stroll. He was hounded by paparazzi and reporters who all wanted to know about his current life, his work in the Ministry, The Cupboard Project, if Ron and Hermione were going to finally wed, and about the lawsuit he just helped settle. For a majority of his time in the public eye, he hated paparazzi. But now, he couldn’t have been happier to see them.
Draco only grinned. “Too bad. It’s really his fault.” He would never thank his father for what happened, or credit him for any happiness. His father didn’t deserve any credit for the good things that came from the marriage.
So he took a deep breath, unwilling to turn his back on Teddy. Even if he was turned away, he would find a way to Teddy, he would always find a way.
“And I forgive you. For all of it. I forgive it all. We were both children, both manipulated, helpless to what had been decided for us, and we were stupid. I know you probably don’t want or need my forgiveness, but here it is. Everything you did, it’s alright. I know my friends haven’t really said it, but they never really hated you either. And I know they forgive you too. Everything that happened before this year, it’s forgotten. It’s done.”
Harry’s whole body quivered when he was fully inside his lover. His back was arched and he shifted his hips a bit. Without the leverage of his feet on the bed, Harry couldn’t move his hips much. He definitely couldn’t thrust, but he could roll his hips just enough to give them both a nice buzz. He held used the pads of his thumbs to caress the front of the other’s hips.
Draco smirked and his free hand went to finish decorating his gingerbread house. “Of course I am. A pesky Slytherin besting a Gryffindor.”
"I uhm, I suppose it's the same, expect I guess I don't like being bitten." He added in a small voice. His embarrassment was obvious, but he still took the conversation as seriously as Draco. He simply wasn't used to this.
Luna looked him in his eyes and said, “I should hope so. If I had to trust someone with children of my own, it would be you.”
Harry looked down, it was hard to think that Hogwarts had gotten so corrupt while he was away. “Through the stories of pain and terror, a common theme appeared. Draco Malfoy and his friends would be sent to curse students, and after cornering them, Draco would tell his friends that he wanted the student all to himself. Once they were alone, he would tell the student to start screaming so it sounded like Draco was doing his job. But he never hurt anyone, not if he didn’t have to. He knowingly protected muggleborn and halfblood students, even though he was taught to hate them. He actively resisted Voldemort’s ideas and protected Voldemort’s enemies. If he were truly a Death Eater, he never would've done something like that. Hell, Death Eater or not, no student in their right mind would have done that. He risked his life for them. There are two more accounts I would like to mention. For a period of time, two students were kept hostage in Malfoy Manor. Luna Lovegood and Dean Thomas. Draco protected them. He gave them extra food and water when he could, and brought them blankets at night. He also had house elves doing extra to take care of them behind the backs of his family, and right under the nose of Voldemort himself.”
“Ah, desperate for any inch of skin.” She teased. “Draco loves it when you wear his jumpers. Loves it so much he said he wants to shag you one day while you wear it.”
“This was the best birthday I’ve ever had.” Draco said with a smile. “For your birthday, I’ll bugger your arse.”
James really didn’t care if Harry dated a boy, a girl, or anyone in-between. But if some brat wanted to date his son, he had standards. He immediately began ranting to Lily about how some Slytherin was giving Harry his jumpers.
Draco uncovered his face and looked up to reveal he was tearing up. He nodded, “I’m fine. I suppose I’m just shocked because I never expected this would really happen. I want to be a Healer, but part of me doubted it would ever come to fruition.”
Harry loved the child at first sight, James Potter immediately referred to him as his grandson, and Teddy asked if Scorpius was his brother. Upon seeing the child, his eyes went blue and a shock of bleach blonde hair appeared for a moment.
Harry felt a bit cozier than usual. He had the urge to curl up right there and call it a night, but part of him thought that was ridiculous because Draco's presence blocked half the sofa. Naturally, his first thought to remedy that issue was to curl up
“Do you think he was treated like a house elf?” Draco asked as he toddled down the stairs with his large suitcase.
He sauntered up to her with a smirk. “Hello Abbott. Rumor has it you’ve fallen for Longbottom.” He figured if he claimed there was a rumor then she would either confirm or deny it.
Harry gave a warm grin. "I couldn't pull it off." He commented as he pulled the wreath out of the bag and went to hang it on the door. Just as he reentered the house, Pansy appeared in the Floo, making Draco jump and let out a yelp in surprise.
Draco spoke with him about students and classes while everyone watched in a mix of amazement and fear. They couldn’t believe someone would hurt Harry like that. Students mumbling about their disgust were heard around James, who had never seen his father so afraid before. Everyone was furious that someone would do this to such a kind professor, and war hero.
“I don’t know. Maybe just a small bit of scene about how they’re doing years later. Just something to let the readers know that they’re alright.” He gave a small shrug, not really knowing what he was talking about.
“Not for me it isn’t!” Harry shouted right back, not letting a second pass between Draco’s words and his. “It might be over for you, but it isn’t for me! I’m trapped Draco! I’m stuck in it! I’m still in it! I want it to be over but it isn’t! Fuck!” He finally snapped. He threw his wand across the room and walked away. He couldn’t deal with it but he found himself walking right back to Draco. “I have nightmares.” His voice was much softer and broken now. His entire mood shifted.
He finally caught his breath and Draco was still in shock. Harry was so beautiful, loud, and helpless when he was wrapped in an overwhelming pleasure like that. Draco would do anything to see it again. “You humped my leg.”
Their sex drives were still as high as the day they’d met, Harry blames Draco’s good looks. He also struggled just as greatly to stay quiet in bed, and they were extremely thankful for silencing charms.
He heard the loud pang of the poppers and was suddenly surrounded by bright flashes. He heard the gasps and yelps of children in response to the sudden noise, then heard his own voice rise, letting out a choked shout before he was suddenly on the ground. He hit the floor but didn’t feel any pain. He looked around with wide eyes, feeling like he couldn’t breathe. He took in deep breaths but it wasn’t enough, he sped up until he was taking in large gasps of air, unable to fill his lungs. His chest ached and one hand went to scratch at his throat, trying to make the invisible hold on it release. His other hand scrambled for his wand and that’s when he realized how bad he was shaking. He couldn’t keep a grip on it and it clattered to the ground. His body curled into a shaking ball and his legs pushed him against the wall, trying to brace himself against something.
When they finished reading, Lucius spoke up. “If it is agreeable, I would like to add an infidelity clause.”
“Never mind.” Dean shook his head, knowing their friends would get a good laugh when they heard about what happened.
“We could always up your debt to four kisses and call it even.” The blonde said with a teasing smile. He radiated smugness but Harry was just eating it up.
Draco could only stare down at the man. Part of him suspected it might have something to do with the war. He supposed it gets easy to commit crimes and make hard decisions if you don’t care, or at the very least, have no regard for consequences. Maybe that’s what happened. Perhaps it’s what
Draco bit his lip and he looked down at the man under him. He took in every inch of tanned skin, scars, each tremble, every curve and valley. He saw those green eyes, blown wide, still full of magic. There was something so wholesome about it. As if his innocence knew no bounds. His eyes traveled between the angel eyes and seductive body, to those pale pink lips that carried the most melodic sounds.
Part of Harry was floored by how they were casually shopping for a Christmas tree together and no one had noticed. He was also shocked by how natural it felt to do something so domestic with Draco. The overwhelmed employee who sold them the tree didn’t even seem to notice who she was selling it to and mindlessly wished them a lovely day before moving on to the next customer.
He pulled his shirt down to cover it up. He went into the bathroom and used the charm. He stripped, turned the shower on, grabbing his shower supplies and getting in.
Now Draco couldn’t stop the few tears that fell from his eyes. He wasn’t crying, but he was overflowing with emotion. “I believe you. I do. If you say you’ll be alright, then I trust that. But that won’t stop me from wanting something better for you.” He knew there wasn’t much he could do. His mother didn’t want any more drama or scandals. He knew she wanted a simple life from now on. She wanted to live quietly and die in peace. He wouldn’t do anything to sabotage that for her. But he would still do what he could. “Andromeda still lives in her old house. You should write her a letter sometime. I know she’d like to hear from you. She cares about you. She asks about you. She wants you to be happy too.” He paused a moment and wiped his eyes. “You both have lost so much. I think talking to each other would make you both a lot happier. You both deserve that much, at least.”
A brief second of eye contact and she saw how much this meant to Draco. She saw how he cared so much about her and her happiness, more than anyone else ever did. “Okay.” She owed him this much for showing her how to be free.
Harry sat up and looked everyone in the eye again. “Then I come here, where I find out I’m famous for something I don’t remember and didn’t do on purpose. I’m bullied, but it isn’t nearly as bad as before. For the first time I have friends, clothes that fit, and food. Then I discover people who want to kill me. I have a family, a godfather, I have people who want to love me but the world hates them. For a moment I thought of Sirius as a father, but I was stupid to believe something good would last. Then I try to tell people about this genocidal maniac who’s trying to kill me and nobody believes me. So I start teaching my friends to defend themselves because the adults wouldn’t help. Then everyone who cares for me starts dying one by one. Then I discover that my purpose in life was always to die, so I just ..... calmly walked into the forest, and I accepted it. For a bit, I really did want to die. For a bit I wished he killed me. But no. I survived, and even more people died.”
He tilted his head and thought a moment before answering, “Well, it isn’t completely bothersome. I’ll be perfectly honest with you, mate, I enjoy the attention. But I don’t want to lead him on, and I don’t exactly know how to reject him.”
Now it was Harry that was stunned into silence, but for very different reasons. He actually almost seemed afraid of what she might be referring to.
“I suppose we should be.” He said before turning to put away the parchment he had been looking over. He was about to stand up, but he stopped himself and turned to Draco, “Have you ever cooked salmon?” The scent of the Manor had him dying to cook.
Anguis M. P. had to be the worst pseudonym Harry had ever heard. Given that “Draco” was Latin for dragon, he thought it would be funny to make his pseudonym Latin for snake. He then proceeded to switch the order of his surname, Potter-Malfoy, and abbreviate. All their friends found the pseudonym to be incredibly amusing and wondered when someone would figure it out. If anyone ever would, they didn't know, but fifteen years into his writing career and no one else knew.
Harry gave a nod. “Indeed. First, I’d like to say congratulations on your promotion! I’m very happy for you. You deserve it.”
It was a fair enough assessment in Harry's opinion and somehow the least shocking. Perhaps it was because Harry knew she meant nothing by it.
“I’m the creep for telling my comatose husband that I love him, but you’re the one throwing me down and pinning me on the sofa.” He threw back without a trace of a blush. Though the memory made him want to squirm and touch himself, he stood his ground.
Rather than considering the gravity of the situation, Harry decided that once it was over, he would finish moving into his house and take some time to relax. After all he’d been through, he figured he deserved as much.
Harry silently raised an eyebrow at Draco’s choice of seating, but digressed. “Fine. I’ve found all my friends to be attractive, the Weasley boys, I considered a relationship with Ginny but she’s a lesbian, I thought Pansy was cute, you, Blaise, of course there was Cedric and Cho, there were these two Hufflepuff boys who graduated a few years ago that I thought were really cute, and there was this Ravenclaw girl second year that I liked, and that’s it.”
“Draco Malfoy. No list of desirable bachelors would been complete without mentioning Draco Malfoy. After this summer’s court trial, Malfoy has been revered as a hero who put himself on the line to save half-blood and Muggle-born students, directly betraying Voldemort to help his peers. This s-“ Neville cut himself off by howling in laughter. A delightfully surprised expression took over his face and he began to shake his head. “I can’t say that! Merlin, I can’t say it!”
That’s when he remembered all the spots in Wizengamot he owned. Perhaps that would be a good place to start, especially now that the Death Eater trials were over and Minister Shacklebolt was beginning his plans to reform the Ministry. Given that Wizengamot acts as a judicial and legislative branch, Harry knew Shacklebolt could use all the support he could get there.
He turned his head, refusing to look at Draco. “You’re lucky it’s your birthday, or else I’d hex you.”
“Quite.” Draco agreed. “Seems like everyone had something to say to you. Eager to touch you too. That’s not even mentioning the way the entire room has look you up and down, twice.” Draco was not jealous. He never got jealous. He is not a jealous person. But this was different. He saw Harry as his and Draco Malfoy did not share. Ever. The insecurity came from the fact that Harry wasn’t really his, and he was helpless to the attentions Harry got. He couldn’t interrupt the people who ogled Harry by snogging him in the middle of the room. There was a stinging in his chest and he could do nothing to remedy it. “Are you hungry, Pansy?” He asked as he turned to her.
Draco was a bit uncomfortable discussing it because it wasn’t as simple as him being willing to do chores. He was used to doing them. He was forced to. He was treated like a slave.
Harry had a lot on his mind between the books and his future plots in Wizengamot. In fact, he made plans to see Daniel Greenwood tomorrow.
“I’m used to lots of balls, being drunk nearly every night in December, and lots of food. But I don’t expect any of that this year. I’m used to a big Christmas tree with lots of decorations and a nice skirt, poinsettias, mistletoe, garland, holiday lights, playing Christmas music all day, gingerbread houses, Christmas biscuits, opening a single present on Christmas Eve, hot chocolate in the morning, and Christmas crackers.”
"I don't care if people talk." Harry said with a shrug, having already made his decision. He was going to dance with Draco, even though it had been a while since he last danced. He figured he would eventually find his rhythm.
“What?” Draco sat up and looked over at Harry in shock. He couldn’t believe Harry would say such a thing.
“I’m alright, Harry. I like being in control. Just relax for a moment.” Draco assured him as he sank down a bit more.
Draco beamed, “Thank you so much!” He hadn’t expected it to go so well. He expected to be sent away with some explanation as to why he can’t learn the trade.
Draco’s mood shifted as well, he went right back to being concerned. He didn’t speak, wanting Harry to continue.
Draco decided that if Harry was going to be honest, then he could be too. “I always admired your eyes. I’d seen green eyes before, but they’re always either mixed with blue or very dull. Yours are bright, pure green. You were a looker.”
Draco raised an eyebrow, a bit surprised, “Oh, so you’re into blokes?” He thought Harry was only interested in girls. His comment about Harry bottoming was meant to only be a joke, but perhaps it was a bit more serious than he thought it was.
He whimpered a few more moments before he regained control of his body. He lazily washed his torso and then turned off the water.
Draco wasn’t exactly sure how he ended up looking at a house thirty kilometers from Hogwarts with Harry, but there he was.
As expected, Draco took a full hour to get ready. He was dressed nicely in his light and expensive fabrics.
In their old late night discussions, they touched on the war and what they lost many times. Draco didn’t want to have that conversation again. He wanted to put it behind him and move on.
But James wasn’t very interested in history. He had an interest in Transfigurations. He hounded McGonagall with questions, theories, all sorts of things. He spent his first few months practically attached to her hip. McGonagall didn’t mind at all, she thought his interest was adorable and loved the idea of a Potter boy who was more interested in academics than mischief.
Harry nodded. "Yea, I named them after the stars, for Sirius. I choose Lupus for Remus. So, after being rejected, they ran back to me. We've always had theories about hatchlings. Did you know that the closest relative to dragons are actually birds and not reptiles? Many species of birds imprint on their mother when they hatch, so we suspect they imprinted on me since I was the only one there."
He couldn’t help the soft smile that spread across his face as he took in Harry’s body, wet and gorgeous. Draco even ogled the man when he decided to lead them on the walk home, shirtless. He spent the walk staring at Harry’s back and looking at the muscles there. He’d never found a back to be attractive before, but here he was.
He closed his eyes and decided that being capable, wanting to, and making the choice were three different things. Anyone can kill, plenty can want to kill, but it’s a choice that you make. As long as Harry continued to choose not to be a killer, it didn’t matter what he wanted or could do. He didn’t want to. He couldn’t want to.
on a scrap of parchment. The ink disappeared and reappeared on a scroll that the Head Warlock held. He unraveled it after the vote and came to realize that an overwhelming majority voted in favor of the creation of the department.
It was exactly what Draco needed. He really wasn’t too sure about how he did on his charms exam. He felt like he probably did okay, but by the same token, he also thought he could have done better and that he should have studied harder. But next was his potions exam, and he was nothing if not confident in that.
Of all possible responses, Harry actually let out a gasp and quickly moved his feet to keep up with Draco's more experienced movements. It only took a few turns for Draco to see how thrown-off Harry was, and he slowed the dance. "Better?"
Draco was shaking. He couldn’t look away from Harry, those sweet eyes were holding him hostage. Each suck and lick drove him wild because he knew it was the first time Harry had ever done this. He was absolutely useless in hoping to guide Harry. He couldn’t get out a sentence to save his life.
Harry spent the day in a frenzy. After breakfast, he rushed to the florist to put together the perfect bouquet for Draco’s birthday. He was out a few hours, but he finished just in time to run to the kitchen and bribe a few elves to let him sneak out some food in the morning for Draco. His birthday was on a Saturday so they didn’t really plan on going to eat in the dining hall. Draco actually planned to sleep in, and Harry planned to make Draco a nice breakfast in bed while he was asleep.
He spent a lot of time writing since he had nothing better to do. He wrote and sent out letters to Pansy, Blaise, and Seamus, explaining his situation, they all wished him the best and promised to visit.
She looked out the window and saw that the snow had stopped. Even so, they were dressed for the winter weather. "Want to go look around, then? You might fine something."
Harry stayed in the hospital wing for the rest of the day. Neither Harry nor Draco made an appearance at lunch. Neville looked sadly and knowingly at Harry’s seat. He knew exactly how Harry felt.
He thought a moment as McGonagall began class. He thought about his feelings for Draco, how strong and sure they had become. Then he spoke on a soft voice, “Hermione, I need to talk to you after class.”
The blonde was filled with pride as he slid down the rest of the way. He sat there a moment, getting used to it. Without being told, Harry began touching him again. “Thank you.” He mumbled. He appreciated how much his pleasure mattered to Harry. Part of him was still a bit unused to being with someone so selfless. His hips rocked as he got used to it all. Though he was eager to cum, he wanted to take this slow.
It was over. It was finally over and the burnout of all his months of fighting for this one thing had finally settled in. People cheered, patted his back, shook his hand, spoke a few words, and Harry went into autopilot while his mind took a step back. He was tired, but not in a way that made him want to fall asleep. It was a tiredness that made him want to stare at nothing in particular until the feeling passed. A feeling that he hadn't felt in weeks, but was suddenly back and knocking at his door. But he didn't have anything to comfort himself. He couldn't cook, eat chocolate, or go outside. For his own mind to try to make him zone out in public like this was something he was both worried and ashamed for. He found himself digging his nails into his thumb in some attempt to keep himself focused and aware of the world around him.
“I can’t blame him. If I wasn’t in love with Seamus I would have made a mess upon your innocence by now, Potter.”
In truth, Harry understood. He knew Draco didn’t mean what he said and was only frustrated. But that didn’t change the fact that it hurt and it wasn’t okay. He understood, he was willing to forgive, but he refused to belittle the situation or blame himself. He deserved better and he knew this.
“Water Nymph by Otto Theodor Gustav Lingner.” Draco was entranced, speaking before he realized the words that fell from his lips. “It was my father’s most prized painting. He said it was the pinnacle of beauty. That he’d forever love the nymph in the painting. It was terrible, I never understood it. But now I do. You are the single most beautiful thing that I have ever seen and I would do anything to touch you. I’ll spend the rest of my days pining for your attention. You enchant me as though you aren’t human. You own me, Harry. You always will. We simply must have your likeness made immortal in a painting.”
“On the other hand, I guess you were right. You win Harry. So, whenever you want, I’ll ride your virginity away.” He winked.
Harry forgot about the map in his pocket. He forgot that the Marauders could hear everything that was happening. He didn’t know how proud James was of him or how happy Sirius was for his cousins Andromeda, Narcissa, and Draco. He also didn’t know how overjoyed Remus was. He didn’t know how Remus was telling Nymphadora about everything that was happening. He didn’t know that Remus nearly broke down crying upon hearing his son say his name for the first time.
It took very little convincing for McGonagall to let Ginny return to her home one Saturday afternoon to be with her family.
"Wait, Draco. I forgot to get a drink could y-" He cut himself off as Draco had already walked away. He didn't want to get up again and risk being stopped by another slew of people. People were tiring. Even though he knew he hadn't really done anything wrong, he couldn't help but to feel as if he did. Maybe he shouldn't have worn this outfit, or perhaps he should have been a bit more aggressive in getting out of conversations. His mood soured a bit but he very quickly understood that it wasn't his fault.
Footsteps rushed to the door and it swung open. "Harry?!" There Draco was, in the same clothes he wore two days ago, staring at him in utter disbelief. His shock changed to guilt and sadness when he looked Harry over. "What happened to you?" There was a leaf in his hair and a scratch on his cheek.
“Yea, I suppose I would. I’d rather ask you about The Cupboard Project, or about Ron and Hermione’s relationship.”
Draco was a bit surprised, but at the same time, he was honored. “Oh, I wasn’t sure how you’d feel about it.”
“That is a blatant lie!” Harry was completely exasperated. “Your family hasn’t worked in generations. My family invented, made businesses, and played the game well to make our money. Now, I melt and sell metal and I own stock in my family’s sold off businesses. I work!”
Draco continued his gentle assault. Soon making Harry lay back as he shifted to kiss and suck at the sensitive skin. Surprised gasps and moans left his lover as the body under his writhed. Though he loved making his partner feel good, there was also a bit of entertainment that came from teasing Harry. Part of it was just fun to watch and listen to. He'd do this all day if he could.
Harry shook his head and sighed, devoting his attentions to his breakfast while Draco spent the rest of the morning throwing out little complements until Harry was pushed to the point of hiding his face behind his hands. "Merlin, I never thought I'd get tired of you saying nice things to me."
Harry thought a moment, and for a second, his mind drifted to a Queen song. Of course, he knew there was no point in bringing up a band Draco wouldn't recognize, but it reminded him of a song he liked, Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy. Since the first time he heard the song, he insisted on calling every significant other his "lover". Even back when all he could do was ogle Krum or flirt with Diggory, he would speak of one day making them his "lover". He'd even had the same terrible thoughts of Bill Weasley, and for a brief moment of his life, Sirius Black. But then again, no one could deny they were lookers. So against better judgement, he make his suggestion. "What about lover?"
Draco’s face lit up like a Christmas tree. “Oh that’s precious. Don’t be embarrassed. When was the last time you wanked then?”
Eventually, Harry remembered he was a Gryffindor, and decided to be brave. “For the record, I’m glad they sent you. I’d rather it be you than some stranger.”
“Oh, don’t be. I never once thought to blame you. It was my mother’s choice and my father’s pride. Nothing to do with you, really. My father was a blind follower of Voldemort and he apparently put that above his own self-preservation and family. Good thing the Malfoy line has come down to me.”
Draco ignored his words and shoved him into their dorm, closing and using a silent spell to lock the door.
Only moments later, they were at Andromeda‘s door. Harry knocked and she opened it, expecting they would be there. “Teddy’s in the sitting room.”
He didn’t know what happened, but for some reason, he had stopped talking. He actually did want to tell the story. Setting the record straight and giving information to help find the man who hurt Draco was the only thing he wanted to do, because at least it was something. It was something productive that would help catch the man who hurt Draco. But no words came out. The scene flashed through his mind and his face twisted into something sour.
Petunia wasn’t exactly close to Lily, so his only real connections to his parents were Sirius and Remus. One taken by Bellatrix Lestrange, the other by the war.
Draco laughed at his surprise. “Yes, Harry. In fact, most of my books contain inappropriate scenes. Anyways, my fifth book is about a dragonologist and a healer who work at the same sanctuary. Yes, I’m into the dragonologist, and it’s mostly comprised of naughty scenes. Try not to act too scandalized. It’s called Dark Scales and Slitted Eyes.”
“He also likes sitting in people’s lap or having someone sit in his lap. He loves the intimacy of it.”
“It’s beautiful.” Harry commented as he stepped forward to occupy the space next to Draco. He had a million questions and suggestions, but he knew what Draco had come here for. He didn’t come here for Harry to ask where a room, he didn’t come here to sit about, he didn’t come here to worry about whether or not someone would come along and catch them, he didn’t come here to think. He came here to be whisked away, so that’s what Harry intended on doing. “Do you want to go sledding?”
Greenwood was almost glad it was only a bit of research because he was confident he could get it all done in a day or two, which was important given that he only had a week before he had to be in Wizengamot to help Pawk present the legal aspects of the bill for its final vote. It was risky to give him so little time and he momentarily wondered if Harry was doing alright. He typically wouldn't do something as uncertain as this. He usually exhibited a lot more authority and forethought in moments like these but this was almost random, spur-of-the-moment, which was entirely unlike Harry. Rather than asking, he chalked it up to the fact that Harry was about to retire and only needed to last another week.
With that, both boys ended up in the kitchen. As strange as it was to admit it, Draco felt as if this could be his home. He also felt like the shorter, raven-haired boy just might be his friend.
Harry shifted a bit and used his duvet to cover his bottom half, embarrassed. “Does, does that usually excite you?”
The two took a few steps in the direction of Greenwood's office before Harry explained his issue. "I wanted to let you know I plan on retiring from Wizengamot to head The Cupboard Project full-time. I think helping orphans and victims of abuse is more my preferred line of work. I've started talking with the Aurors on how they'll be dispatched and we plan on partnering with them to train out won agents to investigate cases of abuse, it's all really exciting."
They were both still sleepy, but thankfully they still had some time before they needed to get up. They slowly separated and mumbled a “goodnight” to each other, though the sun was slowly rising.
“I wonder how they’ll feel about you taking care of them every time they do something stupid and get hurt.”
“A grave! The boy's meant to be dead, Draco, you know this. He refused to lay down and die. The world could've been so much better if everything had gone according to plan, if some kid hadn't gotten loud and rebellious, if my family weren't so deceitful! So yes, I've ruined your lives. I took everything you had ever hoped for, and I derailed it. But only because you did it to me first.”
Harry sat up and smiled, when he looked down he saw a wet spot where he was coated in baby drool. He didn’t care, it was strangely adorable.
He turned around and looked back at his arse. He had never been insecure about it until now. It wasn’t particularly big or small. It was mostly muscle from Quidditch. There were a few freckles that Draco spoke fondly of, and there were a few dark hairs that didn’t make him self-conscious in the slightest. It looked perfectly fine to him. Average, really.
Harry handed the document and quill to Demgass, who signed as the document’s legal witness and stamped the corner with an official Gringotts seal.
The original man who pulled Harry aside only made an awkward face. “What happened with Crow was a retaliation to a vastly overdramatic and biased analysis of her unreleased bill, and it was far too experienced of a move. Pawk couldn’t have been responsible.”
“Harry! I thought we agreed you weren’t going to overwork yourself and you were going to relax during the break. There’s still four days left.” Draco sighed, “I already threatened you with magic, but you didn’t listen.” He reached for his wand. He hoped it would be enough to compel Harry into stopping because he didn't actually have a plan. He was hoping intimidation would be enough.
When he came back into the kitchen, there was a plate with a sandwich and fruit waiting for him. He sat down with Harry and they each cracked open a book, reading and eating in silence. They were both a bit aware of how intimate the moment was. They were sitting in a comfortable silence, sharing something that Draco loved without any of the judgement or worries that he had to deal with before.
Draco returned and closed the curtains around the bed. “Harry, I want you to understand that I have to examine you. Completely.”
Harry gave a wiry smile and raised an eyebrow. “So which one are you in to?” He seriously doubted that Draco was reading it for the potions master, who he already assumed would be written as young and naïve. But an Auror seemed like the exact opposite of the pirate that Draco desired earlier.
The blonde was merciful enough to pull Harry’s boxers down so he could slip out, enjoying the way the other let out a soft whimper from the cool air. His eyes widened at the new flesh. It held only a few visible veins and the tip was the same soft pinkish-brown of his nipples, as opposed to Draco’s angry red. It was strangely pretty. “Honestly, Potter, must you be gorgeous everywhere?”
After finally returning to the task at hand, Draco came to realize there was no cocoa mix. Upon telling the other the bad news, Harry grew a curious expression and stepped into the kitchen, looking around. He started pulling things out of cabinets. Plain cocoa powder, brown sugar, and salt were whisked together in a small pot. He put the pot on the cooker and then went for the almond milk; giving a guilty expression when he added some cream as well.
He had hardly been aware of the shift, but everything felt so much better than before. Any discomfort was gone and he was overwhelmed by pleasure. He couldn’t stop himself from moving with Draco’s hips. He was greedy and needed more.
Harry didn’t dispute it any more. He heard Draco turning the water off in the shower and he was quick with saying goodbye. He put away the map and smiled when Draco came back out.
Harry felt similarly. He didn’t have to cook or clean for positive attention, he didn’t have to walk on eggshells or beg for love. He was just so openly and unconditionally loved for the first time in his life. He couldn’t find the words to describe how he felt, so he let go of Draco’s hand and wrapped both of his arms around the other’s neck. The blonde did the same in adding his newly freed arm with the other that was already resting around Harry’s waist. They held each other as they slowly swayed and turned circles to the music.
"Right, forgot about that." Draco began to move off of him, but something clicked in his head just a second too late and he looked up. "Did you just call me love?"
“He offered once and then he told me I could take them whenever I please.” He clarified, figuring their silence might have been over whether or not Harry had permission to take Draco's clothes.
After a tedious vote on undoing a few of Voldemort-era laws, Harry couldn't wait to go home and change out of the annoying robes he had to wear. He was almost out the door, until a voice called out behind him, "Potter, might I have a word with you?"
"Well, I always thought I'd never marry. I didn't think that was a possibility for me because my father would likely never approve of me marrying a man. But when I did picture myself marrying, I thought he'd be some stuck up man that I hardly knew, with whom my father would make the arrangement. I thought he'd pick out someone from our social class for me to court. Though it's unlikely he would have been from the UK, probably France or something. I thought he'd be unhappy to marry me or think me nothing more than a fuck. I had always resigned myself to the idea that I'd never be married to someone I truly love. But here I am."
Draco nodded and explained, “Imagine being pregnant for nine months and pushing out a baby that you aren’t even going to keep. It’s an incredible amount of work. But I’m going to need a surrogate to have an heir.”
Narcissa and Andromeda were both silently intrigued by his willingness to go do it. Once he left the room, they proceeded to discuss it.
The two boys sat together on the couch, each occupied in their own little worlds. They had never been in the same room for so long, yet they were entirely unbothered by the presence of the other. It was nothing short of a miracle.
“I can handle it. You can’t say anything, you’re the one who went and touched the Whomping Willow.” Draco decided then and there that he would give anything for Harry to get better.
Harry shrugged and looked over at his fiance with a smirk. "Oh, it did. I just didn't want to admit it."
Harry just raised an eyebrow, “Though there were moments where you really got on my nerves. I never considered you an enemy. An annoying bastard maybe, but a witty one at that. You made school interesting to say the least. You aren’t that bad Malfoy. The war is over. Just be yourself. And I’d better see you at Hogwarts next year. It wouldn’t be the same without you. And Lovegood’s been dying to talk to you since you helped her at your Manor.”
Pansy smiled, she knew she had Draco exactly where she wanted him. “I’m just saying, I really thought you could do better than that. I thought you were just warming up, you know. I was under the impression that you would eventually embarrass Harry and come out victorious. But I suppose if Harry is just a better flirt than yo-“
“I know.” He sighed, “I’ll try to. I just, I don’t want to just spring it on him. I want to build up to it. I want to wait for the right moment.”
He knew he needed to find allies everywhere to play this game, even in the press. He figured it wouldn’t be too hard to find a newer reporter, one who’s a bit more desperate to get out big stories. His face brightened as he remembered a few members of Wizengamot were needed for a lawsuit between two wizards. From what he could recall, they were both somewhat well-known for reasons he didn’t remember. Small news like that would be given to reporters who feel their talents aren’t being taken seriously.
“It’s wonderful, Harry! Just in time for the first day of December.” He began looking through the records Harry bought and saw they were all Christmas themed. He blinked in surprise and looked over at the other. “You did this for me?” He couldn’t help the bubbling excitement in his stomach. He was a sucker for gifts and acts of service like this. Draco was very well versed in the love languages and wasn’t surprised when he realized his own. He was used to being a bit spoiled and was an absolute fool when it came from a nice-looking man.
Draco grinned to himself and paused, noticing in the mirror that his own lips had turned a velvety red from the kisses. He touched them and they felt warm. He liked it more than he wanted to admit.
Harry gave a nod and left as Narcissa closed the door. He took a deep breath and rubbed his face, feeling absolutely stupid for having worried so much.
Harry elaborated, “Well, when I’m stressed and busy, my body doesn’t pull shit like that. So I can only take it as a sign that I need to get my stress levels up.”
“No.” Harry said back, finally finding his voice. “I don’t get pinned down, Malfoy.” He lurched forward, nearly knocking Draco down from surprise. It was accidental but he kept his expression indifferent. Now he was leaning over the blonde and his eyes were filled with a mischief that has run in his family for generations. “You of all people should know that I never go down without a fight, and I always find a way out. You can’t win, love.”
Draco cracked a smile and let out a chuckle. He’s come to notice that Harry has a very easy time making him laugh. That, along with the fact that Harry works and does the cooking and cleaning, has allowed Draco to adjust pretty comfortably. Then again, he’s started doing small things. He’ll wipe up the counters and clean up any dirt he sees. He doesn’t want to feel like a freeloader.
He found himself waiting over the food until an owl came to his window. He opened it up and took a thick envelope from it’s mouth. It was from Daniel Greenwood of all people. The envelope yielded to Harry’s digging fingers and he pulled out a small letter. It wished him a merry Christmas and said that as a gift, Greenwood had finished all the laws associated with The Cupboard Project, and a copy of them sat in the envelope.
“So it would seem." Lucius shrugged as if it didn't even matter, as if he'd thought of that too. "There's a certain clause in existing marriage laws that came about when more progressive wizards decided that homosexual marriage should be legal. At the time, it never would have come to pass. So they did the next best thing. They created an immutable clause which states that any changes made to marriage laws will not affect existing couples. This meant that if anyone tried to make a homosexual marriage illegal, it wouldn't nullify existing marriages. And now, it means that your marriage can’t be nullified.” He put on a gleaming smile as he basked in his victory.
He moved on to the back of the hospital wing where he was brewing more Skele-Gro, he and a nurse were working on it together. They talked a while and started working on a few other potions until the door to the hospital wing burst open.
Harry was escorted in by two Aurors and he made a brief eye contact with Pansy. She wasn’t in her Wizengamot robes. A lot of people weren’t. She didn’t seem like she had been crying recently so he had a bit of hope that things hadn’t gotten worse.
Molly gave a sad smile. “There you go, always worrying about someone else instead of yourself.” She pressed a kiss to the top of his head as she held him close. “Try to make the best of it, Harry. I know you want to befriend him, and I think a friend is what he could use right now.”
Truthfully, Harry wanted it. He wanted it so badly. There was a voice in the back of his head. It invaded his thoughts, seeped into his bones, gripped his heart, and touched his soul. It called out to him and begged to be heard. It raided his body until it seeped out of him with each exhale. The voice ruled him, and it told him that this was all so very wrong.
That got some soft giggles and muffled laughs from around their group. Something about sex turned them into dumb twelve year olds.
“Speaking of Wizengamot, I got a letter from Pansy today, just before I left Paris.” He set the journal down in his lap and turned to Harry. “She told me that you offered her a spot in Crow’s revival of the St. Mungo’s reform, in exchange for influencing younger members of Luther’s old party to vote for Pawk’s bill. Quite complicated, yea? I knew you supported Pawk and wanted to get her some votes, but I didn’t realize just how far you were willing to go to get those votes. You must also have some connection to Crow given that you were able to make such a promise.”
Seamus grinned. "That's perfect! Maybe they could meet up at a charity event and their shared interest is what get's them talking." He knew Draco would know a bit about that as charity events were just another type of social gathering for politicians and the rich.
“Love?” Draco questioned in a groggy voice as he slowly woke up. That was the part that stuck out to him. Though love wasn’t exactly a romantic nickname, it did convey at least a bit of affection. He was chuffed to say the least.
Harry shifted a bit, his robes being the only thing to cover his arousal, but he so badly wanted them off. He didn't want those stupid plum Wizengamot robes on during such an intimate moment. "Is it alright if I take my robes off?"
It had now been verbally and openly established that Draco and Harry were at the very least willing to sleep with each other. There was also a silent agreement that they would spend the rest of their lives together. So now that the Slytherin had remembered his charming ways, perhaps now it was time for the Gryffindor to remember his bravery.
Then everything got completely derailed, and now he suddenly had a future in medicine that he made all on his own. His father didn’t give it to him, he didn’t buy it, and his family name had nothing to do with it.
The blonde looked a bit coy before finally getting it out. “Look, I know you said you wanted to wait, and I’m still okay with that, I’ll always be okay with that. But, uhm. If there ever was a night where you didn’t want to go to bed alone, just let me know.” He seemed to realize the potential sexual nature of his comment and gave a surprised expression before quickly adjusting his language. “Not to say that I’m offering anything of a sexual nature, I’m not. We don’t even have to cuddle or anything. Uhm. Well, not to say I’m
"Andromeda told me once that you were far too clever for Azkaban. I think she always knew you'd escape. When you did, no one was surprised. I suppose I wasn't either because I was always taught that it would eventually happen."
The Ministry had been repairing itself since the war, and the last thing they needed was something strange going on. A human befriending dragons definitely fell into that category. Dragons were known to hardly tolerate the presence of humans. They are wild and cannot be tamed, and those dumb enough to try always end up dead. Not even the dragon that lived in Gringotts was tamed, but tortured into servitude. The only way to subdue a dragon was for half a dozen wizards to perform a stunning spell, and even that was temporary. Yet somehow, Harry had befriended three baby dragons.
The blonde turned and smiled at him. "News travels fast. The Daily Prophet sent out an extra print, only three pages long. The headline says The Cupboard Project passed with forty-eight votes."
A smirk washed over Draco’s face and he pushed Harry back onto the bed. “I’ve been waiting so long to get to see you cum again.” It was true. With every orgasm Harry’s given him, he’s thought about getting to give Harry another.
“Strange, it’s also my friend Remus’ birthday.” About halfway through that sentence, Harry’s smile disappeared but he kept his happy tone up. It wasn’t just that he was sad, but he was also suspicious.
Harry looked down and was greeted by satin underwear. It took a lot of self-control not to make a comment. He decided to start with what he knew how to do. He set his hand over Draco’s bulge and gently rubbed it.
“We haven’t. Not completely, at least. Eventually that would get incestuous. No, we aren’t completely pureblood. There are plenty of halfbloods on the Malfoy family tree. We’ve even married muggles.” He explained, ”The LeStrange family got a bit incestuous and ended up like all the others that do. There all a bit unhinged, crazy. It really isn't healthy. You would think the royals families of Europe would have been enough evidence to prevent behaviors such as that, but I suppose some lessons have to be learned the hard way.”
“It’s fine. I was just numb.” He lifted his arm and slowly moved it, cringing a bit at the pins-and-needles feeling that spread throughout it.
The earliest version of that chapter was mostly gossip and speculation. The moment Harry saw it, he set the record straight. He was truthful and didn’t go into too much detail, even though he probably still went into more detail than needed. He admitted to the abuses and trauma he went through in his childhood and beyond. He was open and vulnerable for the sake of preventing history from repeating itself. It was also a testimony to people like Sirius, who had to silently face abuse in their childhood. Harry wouldn’t stand for silence. Not any longer.
Molly and Lucius dominated the conversation. They discussed the terms of the marriage fiercely. Mostly by giving in to Lucius’ terms, with Molly arguing in a bit of leeway for the boys. Narcissa only spoke up to tell her husband to back down, and Arthur to defend his wife. Harry and Draco were silent through the process. Draco stared at his lap while Harry’s eyes darted between the squabbling adults. He was very invested in the conversation. He still had hope that Molly would be able to help them out, but Draco had given up.
Harry didn’t know what overcame him, but he felt his cheeks burn from the complement. “Oh? Uhm, thank you.” He looked as if he had no idea how to respond to a compliment.
Draco rolled his eyes, gave him a potion to numb the pain, then left Harry to rest. But of course, Harry wasn’t resting for long. Eventually, Hermione came to visit him and he convinced her to get some of his stuff so he could work from the infirmary. He was like that until dinner time. Food was brought to the hospital wing and Draco entered Harry’s curtain to give him his meal.
Draco continued to comfort her, but found himself a bit confused. They were never particularly close to the Greengrass family, and he only vaguely knew Astoria due to their old statuses as purebloods. It was sad that she was in such a state, but he didn’t understand why his mother was so emotionally distraught by this happening to someone she didn’t know very well. He also wasn’t sure why she felt the need to come and tell him about it.
The boys nodded and then sat down. Draco sat on a chair while Harry sat on the floor by Teddy. The two young men briefly looked at each other and seemed to have a moment of recognition. It was in that moment their different upbringings became apparent. Draco slowly moved onto the floor by Harry. Andromeda was quite amused by the two.
Harry only had to think for a second before he figured something out. “Libel. Libel in media is illegal in much of Muggle society, but not here. Libel is something plenty of politicians deal with, regardless of political belief. They’d be all for it and would all support you two.”
Harry assumed the circumstances were that no one actually believed he was guilty and no one wanted to waste their time. Veritaserum would make the trial much faster.
There was a sadness and a hate that had seeped from his mind. It went deep into his bones and it sank into the very core of him. Perhaps it had always been there and he just realized it, maybe it’s been hiding in him. It felt as old and familiar as breathing. As much as he disliked it, he knew it was nothing new.
Deep green eyes turned playful and sinister. The eye contact was killing Draco. Harry’s eyes were so pretty. Maybe the innocence of it, maybe it was the confidence, but something about it made Draco shiver.
He stared at the paper intensely, his eyes demanding a response. He never considered it a possibility that they might be with his mother. He had to assume other people were there, but he didn’t think his mother would be one of them. He would have thought they would have mentioned it if someone that close to him was there.
Draco was seating in the other side of the couch. The moment he saw how stressed Harry was, he looked down at his book and grew silent. He’d gotten to the point where he would greet Harry in some way after he came home, but he couldn’t today. He suspected it had something to do with the conversation he had only two days ago at Malfoy Manor. His father describing how terrible it would be if Harry used Draco to unwind from work, whether it be violence or something else. Now here Harry was, finishing up some work, looking stressed.
The last few days have made him strangely motivated for work. He knew he was falling for Draco, he knew Draco felt the same, and when they were together they’d be able to officially dispel any rumors of one using the other. In fact, it all made him momentarily forget that he and Draco were already legally married. It was a strange set of circumstance that he found himself in, but it made him want to do more. With the holiday season over, he felt ready to dive back in.
"I can't believe you made all these." Luna commented as she took yet another sweet. They'd eaten nearly a dozen.
Draco let out a soft chuckle and he sat up, looking down at Harry. “I could get used to seeing you under me.”
Whenever Harry thought back on the year, he found himself realizing that it had been the best of his life. He’d found real love, made new friends, didn’t have to worry about death. It was the first year where he got to be a normal kid. As unfamiliar as it was, it was wonderful.
Harry twiddled his thumbs and tried to think of something useful to say. He still felt bad for Draco. Though they were both victims, Draco was the one who had to give up his entire life. Harry thought the other had it worse.
Draco took a deep breath and gave a nod. "Very well, but that doesn't change that everyone now knows about our relationship." He pointed out before glancing back down at the paper. "We ought to clear things up ourselves. I don't want any more outlandish rumors about us."
When it was time for dinner, Harry was excited to meet up with Hermione again and discuss their plot for riches.
For some sick moment, he knew how Sirius might have felt. Though Sirius didn’t have the advantage of being dosed with Veritaserum.
His hips began to shift and his back softly arched. He whined and decided that the feeling rushing through his body was much more important to him than his pride. He let his hips sink down onto Draco, before pulling back. He moved in time to the thrusts and found himself taking Draco in even faster than before. He let out a loud moan and his jaw dropped. “More, I want more!”
Harry moved to sit by him. “I’m sorry. I never should have asked you to dance. I knew it wasn’t a good time but you just looked so handsome and I couldn’t resist an-”
Harry was in the restricted section, halfway into S and swapping out one book for another when Draco came storming through. He walked right in to the restricted section and grabbed Harry’s wrist when he set his book down.
Draco paused a moment and looked Harry up and down once more. This time his eyes were glazed over with suspicion. “Only fairies can use glamour.” It wasn’t a type of magic that humans could use. But faes were naturals at it, they invented it.
There was a moment of no response. Harry got a bit nervous at that. He didn’t like those moments where no one said anything. It made him feel like he had said the wrong thing or that he sounded stupid.
“He was in a vulnerable position. He had enough public support to have something to lose, but he still had something to prove. He was in too perfect of a position to make mistakes or take risks.”
He found himself only centimeters away from Draco’s face, which was strange since earlier they weren’t so close. He leaned in without even realizing it.
He bought presents for the Weasley clan and Hermione. He gave them to Hermione so she could bring them with her and Ron to the Weasley house for Christmas. He got Hermione some new journals and notebooks for all her planning to become the next Minister, and he got Ron a training dummy to practice wandless magic on.
He smirked and slipped his robes off, pulling off his tie, and undoing his top two buttons with one hand.
He looked away and nodded. “Of course I did. You always look handsome. It’s just ..... I don’t ever see you all dressed up. I don’t know. I liked it. Shut up.”
“The Daily Prophet got every word! You did phenomenal Harry, nearly made me cry for him.” Seamus said with a grin.
Harry seemed to curl up a bit as if protecting himself from the pleasure. In some invisible struggle, the hand on Draco’s shirt raised and exposed most of the man’s torso. He tossed his head back and let out a breathy grunt, losing to the lovely feelings that invaded his system. “Shut up! I’m not loud.”
They left the coffee shop and were about to part ways when they noticed a few reporters taking pictures of them. They both sighed and said very quick goodbyes before heading in opposite directions.
The blonde chuckled and looked quite satisfied with himself. “No. This isn’t about the teasing either. I won’t get you back until after we’re together. This is just me being an arse.”
Harry was a bit tanner than him, he always had been. Rough patches of skin like little deserts, a few freckles scattered and colored like soil, hair of dark little forests, the most enchanting oceans of green, small but defined muscles, there was a softness in those rolling hills. He had all the beauty of nature with the sweet reddish lips and wild curls of some Greek nature deity. Harry looked as if he belonged in a Renaissance painting that Draco would have bought to keep in his room, for his own pleasure. A picture of allure and charm that he could never touch. Something higher than him, greater than him, something to bring him to his knees to pine over for the rest of his days.
Normally the explosion would elicit a laugh from Harry. But this time, it was different. He flinched and thought of Fred.
Draco cracked a smile. “Oh, you’re shy?” He tilted his head. “How many times this week have you wanted to ask me to touch you, but didn’t because you were too shy?”
He hadn’t read it in about a month. He needed a break to process everything. But now, he was ready for more.
“Are you okay?” Harry spoke in a small voice. Slamming doors, anger, and balled fists. He didn’t want to be scared, but he was. Of course he was confident he could take Draco in a fight, it wasn’t about that. He hated how he felt, but he knew he couldn’t do much to stop it.
“I thought you had a hard time asking for things?” Draco commented with a smirk as he undid the button and slowly pulled down the zipper.
“Draco, we have five minutes.” Harry called out, trying to get Draco to understand how little time they had.
“So, now that I’ve gotten in on your plans for your future family, I’m wondering what you’ll do for a career.” She prompted.
He felt like a real adult. He was making big decisions and he felt like he was really making strides in his life. He was guaranteed his job at a Hogwarts, and he was actually already working on his application, he was looking at houses, and he got himself a boyfriend. Things were looking up for him and for the first time, he wasn’t worried about it. He wasn’t afraid that someone was going to come along and completely derail his life, or that he was going to die sometime soon, he had a sense of security and purpose. He didn’t feel like a fool for being hopeful, he let himself have high hopes for the future. He was excited for it.
It was silently understood that Pansy’s parents were part of the group that considered Draco to be a blood traitor.
Draco wasn’t lying when he said he’d learned self-control. He could go the entire session without responding or making a sound. But he didn’t want to. He wanted Harry to know how good he felt. He knew Harry needed it. So what if he lost the bet, losing just means he gets to ride away Harry’s virginity, it’s a win-win situation for him.
Harry gave a cheeky smile and watched Draco open the other presents. At the books on medicine he seemed quite excited, “Thank you, Harry.”
The blonde let out a soft laugh. “Oh, don’t tell me you’re so sensitive you can’t handle having your ear whispered in.” He wasn’t even trying to be sensual anymore. He only thought it hilarious.
Nevertheless, it was too late for Harry to change what was about to happen. He felt his release wash over him like a powerful wave and he panicked. He knew he was gonna be loud and in his moment of clarity, he made the decision to bite Draco’s shoulder to shut himself up. He managed silence for a few seconds before the throes of pleasure reached their full intensity and he was forced to cry into his lover’s shoulder. Though he made sure not to bite hard.
Still, standing before Wizengamot, he knew he should be focused. He knew he should pay complete attention to what went on before him. Yet somehow, he didn’t.
Harry let out a whine at the way his hips sank down into the bed with each bounce, as if he was the one being fucked. The sudden switch to bouncing hit him with a pleasure that was much stronger than before.
When they woke up the next morning, neither wanted to move. They used the excuse of being too tired to move, too coy to admit that they were just overjoyed to get to hold each other.
Draco thought a moment and remembered a small and cute fantasy of Harry’s. He once confessed he liked the idea of being ridden. After a bit of alcohol, he said he thought it’d be a beautiful sight and that he wanted his body to be used for pleasure. Of course, there was trauma that contributed to it and the conversation had turned into something vulnerable and serious. But the idea of his fantasy remained.
He was high off his accomplishment and adrenaline from lack of sleep. He felt like he was ready to get things done. He was wanted to dive in and do more work.
“Need any help?” His words were falling from his lips before he even realized what he was saying. All he knew was that he needed to speak.
Again, Harry found himself staring. He was distracted by Draco’s jaw. It was soft but still defined, just enough to catch Harry’s eye. His eyes trailed up slightly to Draco's cheek, his eyes outlined the shape of it, taking in each and every detail. Every curve, the little pink blotches, the couple freckles, and how his cheekbone stood out from his face. For some strange reason he wanted to kiss it.
Harry bit his lip and let out shaky moan from the shivers that rushed down his spine to meet the dense and growing pleasure that rested between his legs. “Oh, lover.” His voice dropped into something low and rough. The hand in Draco’s hair gave him a tug and forced him to raise up a bit as Harry turned to nearly growl his words right into the blonde’s ear. “Once the epitome of grace and snide. I love the way you fall apart.”
