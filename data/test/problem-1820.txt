There was a moment of heavy silence. Ron reached across and squeezed his shoulder.
After quick showers—even the bathroom had a spectacular view of the ocean—they headed down to the lodge where the Inn’s restaurant & bar served a delectable meal, accompanied by a wine list that sent Draco into transports. Stuffed and spoiled, slightly tipsy, they strolled back along the stone paths leading between the residences, watching the sun set over the ocean. When they crawled into bed, Harry’s last waking thought was of Draco’s face outside in the fiery glow of the dying light, turning to Harry, saying,
“Is that right?” Neville considered him for a moment.
“What now?”
Potter snorted into his drink and blushed quite fetchingly, so Draco couldn’t really regret his brazenness. And in fact, he found himself simply telling Potter all about his miserably lonely Christmas, and Potter’s face softened, and his eyes went all sympathetic and understanding, so Draco couldn’t regret that either. He somehow managed to restrain himself from asking why Potter was there alone, instead turning the conversation to Quidditch, and then the interminable frustrations of the Ministry bureaucracy, which they both had quite a bit to say about.
Ron guffawed, “Bet you’re right mate. I mean, what Harry, other than Oliver you’ve only had that mystery wizard, right?” He frowned, “Is that what happened? Was he all weird about you being Harry Potter?”
Everyone seemed to assume that partnering up with someone meant loving them a lot but also needing to be away from them approximately half the time. Frankly, it left Harry less than convinced that it was even worth it, trying to find love. Could it really be that good, if he would want to be around his partner less than he wanted to be around his best friend?
“You want me to fuck you?” Draco breathed, and Harry shuddered, hard, nodding, “
Draco was right, they had so much time, so Harry didn’t rush at all. He waited until he could slide three fingers in, slick and easy; waited until the sheets under Draco’s hips were soaked with lube and sticky with precome; waited until he heard the word
And then the music started, and Harry was caught up amid the sweaty press of bodies, alongside Malfoy. Draco Malfoy, who had tormented him and his best friends, espoused the worst sort of prejudices, sworn allegiance to a genocidal fascist. They had fought on opposite sides of a war, saved each other’s lives, and here they were, shoulders jostling together, arms in the air, shouting
The next morning, they took the drive Harry had heard about, north up a motorway called Highway 1, winding along the coastline, ocean on their left, sun on their skin. Harry had updated the bike’s stereo system a few years ago, and Draco insisted on playing
Harry, panting and a little dazed himself, grinned widely, “So I did good, huh?”
Slowly, carefully, he wordlessly summoned his wand, and then two vials of hangover potion from the medicine cabinet, trying his utmost not to disturb Potter. He’d just managed to uncork his vial and tip it back when Potter started to stir, groaning. Draco tightened his grip around Potter’s torso, dipping his head to nose at the back of Potter’s neck, trailing his lips along to softly murmur “good morning” in Potter’s ear, then gently nipping his earlobe. Potter made a pained noise, and Draco quickly brought the second vial of hangover potion around. Potter swallowed, heaved a couple of deep, deliberate breaths, sighed in relief, and then—went completely stiff in Draco’s arms.
Harry swallowed down that feeling too, and stretched his mouth as wide as he could, tried to look truly pleased, hoped his voice didn’t sound strained as he said,
In the morning, Harry found Draco in the kitchen fixing his usual tea, looking smug.
“Yes, well,” Draco stiffened in his seat, “Some of them wished that, in addition to shagging, Harry and I would also date, yes.” He flushed deeply. “But it hasn’t worked, has it!” He nodded triumphantly.
“Ok?” Harry zoned out a little as Ron explained the benefits of heavy hors d’oeuvres and light main courses, ranked his top five appetizers (bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with almonds and blue cheese, smoked salmon crostini, pesto bruschetta, deviled eggs, and crudité cups filled with lemon-rosemary hummus), and concluded that they should pick just one pasta and the fish as main course options. Harry made an indistinct affirmative noise in an attempt to signal his agreement.
Draco’s mouth quirked, “Excuse me?”
Draco flashed his teeth.
Draco couldn’t deny it. He sipped his coffee.
But he was also pretty sure that his feelings weren’t irremediable or unavoidable—not yet at least. He didn’t think that he
“Oh?” Harry sidled around him, picking up the kettle. “What are you going to do?”
Harry rolled his eyes, hitting Draco with extra-strength cleaning and freshening charms, making him yelp indignantly.
She raised one perfectly sculpted brow. “I may be old but I’m not blind yet.”
. And then he nodded stiffly and walked away.
“Have we, though?” Asked Greg, passing a joint over to Harry, “Have either of you gotten a head up the other’s arse yet?”
“You sure about that, eh? You’re going to
for all his help preparing for the Gala. Draco wasn’t one to say
“Do you forget who you’re talking to here, Harry? I'm the son of Molly Weasley. There's no limit to how many times I can attempt to convince you to
“You…” Hermione cocked her head to the side. She was making the face she reserved for when Harry (or Ron) did something particularly stupid—her brows frowning at him but her mouth working as she tried to suppress a smile. “I’m sorry Harry, I thought I just heard you say that you were going to a muggle music show with Draco Malfoy? Surely I misheard? I was quite absorbed in my work…” She trailed off, barely containing the mirth in her voice.
Harry turned the handle viciously and flung it open. He was met with a wall of sound, clearly muffled from the outside by heavy-duty silencing charms. He could barely think over it—a cacophony of banging drums, aggressive guitar, screeching vocals. It took him a moment to even register Malfoy’s presence, overwhelmed as he was by the sudden noise. But when he did… well.
Harry snorted, shaking his head. “You fucking would, you dog…”
“In any case,” Neville plucked the joint from Draco’s fingers, “What we all really wanted was the dating. The sex stuff was,” he waved a hand, smoke trailing through his fingers, “secondary.”
Draco knew that knock. He also knew that the person on the other side of it wasn’t going to wait for a response before—
Harry laughed, “I think that might be a little optimistic, but yeah best case, ok. That’d be nice.”
On Tuesday, Harry cooked—carbonara, one of Draco’s favorites, which also had the advantage of feeling indulgent while being incredibly easy to throw together at the end of a long workday. When they had banished the dishes to the sink and retired to lounge contentendly on a blanket in the back garden, he cleared his throat.
Harry made it through the rest of November in a haze. Draco had stopped avoiding him and was now simply acknowledging him coolly and formally, even more distant than he’d been before they slept together. Once, they’d been the last two left in a lift and Draco had resolutely ignored every attempt Harry made to talk about what had happened, answering each overture with a bland comment about the weather, or the expense reports he was working on, or the dire need to redesign the uniform robes in the Department of International Magical Cooperation. Harry wanted to stop the lift, trap them in there, make Draco talk to him; he wanted to scream, but then the bell dinged and Draco swept out, inclining his head politely and wishing Harry a lovely afternoon.
Harry inhaled sharply, fumbling with the laces of his kit, peeling off his layers, flushing under Draco’s gaze. And gods, he looked just as good as Draco knew he would, his compact frame thrumming with repressed energy, taut muscles shifting under his skin. Draco made no move to undress himself. He simply watched Harry, the roll of his shoulders, the flat planes of his stomach clenching as he moved.
Malfoy looked at him, fond and amused, and said
. And Draco had brushed his thumb over Harry’s knuckles gently and said, soft, without looking away,
Draco laughed, shrugging, “Well, no one’s going to remember that.” He darted a sly grin at Harry and plucked a couple of stuffed dates of the nearest tray, offering one and biting the other in half.
“Harry!” Hermione put her hand to her heart in mock offense, “Would we ever laugh at you?”
Harry gulped. The truth was that every time he had thought about the ceremony over the past couple of weeks, even as he was writing down the words he would say, when he considered actually
“Of course,” Hermione sobered up immediately, placing a prim bite in her mouth.
Harry loved checking in with them about it, and he loved helping whenever he could, too. He had, predictably, gone way overboard researching wedding bands, compiling a huge list and dragging Ron to live shows all over the greater London area. The two of them had gone to Neville’s greenhouses, passing a joint back and forth and wandering along the paths, staring at the flowers with wide eyes and pointing out ones they liked to Neville, who was taking care of the arrangements. Ron had stopped in front of a cluster of luminous gold blooms, twinkling gently like soft starlight. He had grabbed Harry’s arm and, swaying slightly, said,
“Um, sure ok, but does it have to be
Harry’s eyebrows shot up, “You want to go to the Weasley Christmas? I mean, don’t get me wrong, I’d love it, I just thought it might be a lot for you—”
“Good,” Harry rested his head back on Draco’s shoulder, as the first seconds of the new year settled warm in his bones. “That’s what I’m counting on.”

“Yeah, that’s us,” Harry kicked him under the table. “Or maybe… just hear me out on this one… maybe we’re just a couple of kids who didn’t have a lot of love, so it took us a bit of extra time to figure it out.”
Draco grinned, catlike. “We’re going out again next weekend.”
Harry looked up, catching Draco staring and throwing him a crooked grin. Draco stomped on the urge to cross the garden and ravish him where he stood.
Harry laughed, leaned over and plucked his now-empty glass from Pansy’s hand, turned his grin on Draco and said, “No, it’s your birthday, I’m buying
“So you’ll be my date for the wedding, now, eh?” he asked.
“Let’s do one, Draco.”
, he didn’t regret that either. It would cheapen their friendship, to regret it. Harry didn’t think they had lost or wasted any time—nothing that had happened between them before was wasted; it was all precious.
“Right. So, can I help you?”
“No!” Potter said quickly. “Of course not. I was just— I was wondering—” he broke off, running a hand through his hair and then turning away from Draco to press his forearms to the bar top, clenching his fists. “How did you know?”
“You bitch!” Pansy threw a lit sparkler directly at her face; Ginny snatched it out of the air and blew her a kiss. “You swore you wouldn’t tell!”
Harry thought about lemon bars for a moment and decided that he felt extremely positively about them.
“Yeah,” said Draco, “I know.”
“Well, I’d tell this friend of yours that I pretty much always knew—although it was confirmed beyond doubt when I attempted to snog Pansy at the Yule Ball in fourth year—” that earned him a chuckle, “but sometimes it takes people a bit longer to figure it out, and that’s perfectly alright too. You just have to trust yourself. And a little exploration goes a long way,” he added with a smirk.
Weasley what karaoke even was, had thus far refused to sing, getting steadily tipsier until Weasley serenaded her to the tune of
“Yeah,” he said, breaking away and grinning up at Draco, “I only forgot my lines once.”
Draco blinked. “It… does sound a bit stupid when you say it like that...”
A knock at the door.
“Well, I was shagged yesterday, so I still pity you—”
His smile went sharp, dangerous, “I’ll take care of you, you’ll like it, and I’ll have you all the time… I’m
Potter smiled a bit, “Right. And how’d you deal with that?”
“Can’t deny it, mate, sorry,” Ron responded cheerfully.

Harry fisted his hands in the hem of his shirt. “You know how— how we always say we’re not capable of really loving someone or being loved—” he didn’t dare look up, barreling on, “What if we are, and it’s—it’s us, it’s what we already have?” He took a deep breath and forced his gaze up. Draco was staring at him in a dazed sort of way, his mouth parted, the faint shock of a frown creasing his forehead.
“A toast!” He called out, “To Harry, on his thirty-first birthday!”
Or maybe Harry was just lonely. So lonely that he had finally gone off the deep end and succumbed to the wild ravings of his so-called friends. He huffed and rolled over, burying his face in his pillow.
“Happy Christmas, Draco.”
Draco squeezed his inner muscles one more time, wringing a low whimper from Harry.
Hermione shrieked and practically toppled out of her armchair. Ron, laughing, said “Good on you, mate. I’d never even have thought to ease into it at the muggle bars—brilliant, really.”
“What was that?” Draco asked sharply.
“Harry,” Harry responded, shaking his hand.
good, do you know that?” Harry punctuated this with a single hard thrust. “Fuck,” he groaned, burying his head in the curve of Draco’s neck, teeth grazing against the soft spot under Draco’s jaw. “It’s honestly unfair, Draco, it’s—”
Harry chewed on his lip. He knew what Draco meant, when he said normal. Easy, uncomplicated. Harry had tried to find that too, over the years. It never worked. “Fuck normal,” he said.
Harry glanced around the circle, at his best friends, at Draco.
“I want it,” Harry breathed, “I want you to fuck me.”
Draco awoke slowly, to a snuffling sensation along his neck. He opened his eyes slowly, cautiously. A wild nest of black hair was tickling his chin and attached to it was a mouth trailing down his neck—Harry’s mouth. Harry paused at Draco’s collarbone and nipped gently, and Draco inhaled sharply. The nest of hair tilted up and back, and bright green eyes looked down on him, twinkling mischievously.
“Well, I did say it was transcendent, didn’t I?” Malfoy’s lips quirked up and warmth exploded anew through Harry’s chest, and he laughed again, helpless.
On Friday they stopped by Jimmy Eat World and reminisced about when Draco had taken Harry to their show in London back when things were still fragile and unknown between them. Saturday was a blur of sweat and beer, hotboxing the tent in the afternoon and stumbling back through the sweat-streaked throngs, bumping into strangers whose eyes were even more glazed over than theirs. Draco was in his element at the outskirts of the crowd by the main stage when Panic! At the Disco played, camping it up as he swished his hips and twirled Harry through the dirt, pulling him close and cooing in his ear
But sleep was tugging at the edges of his mind, dragging him back down. Anyways, it felt obvious, understood in everything else they had said and done, in everything they already were to each other. He turned into Draco’s arms and let an untroubled slumber claim him.
, Potter said.”
At Harry’s prompting, Ron eagerly launched into a description of the multi-course menu he had planned at the caterer’s tasting the following week. Harry, who had volunteered himself as assistant taste-tester, listened raptly. As he ate his way through two more plates of ziti, Ron regaled him with a dramatic retelling of the latest incident with the guest list—a second cousin of Molly’s had asked to bring her kneazle (
Harry chuckled.
“But—”
“Hah!” Hermione crowed triumphantly; Ron pumped his fist in the air and shouted, “Yes! Finally!”
“Fuck,” he managed.
“Ah, well.” Harry nodded and took a sip of tea. “So you had a good time? You like him?”
detail, mind you—for Harry and me to indulge in exactly this sort of behavior, so I really don’t see what you’re complaining about, now you’ve gotten what you wanted?”
“I’m sorry, what?” José leaned in, frowning slightly, and Harry buried his face in his pint glass.
—that was too far. Potter had never dared proposition him so explicitly, so lewdly, and before Draco could think, he was out of his chair and had him against the wall, pinning him with a forearm to the chest. “I’m done,” he gritted out, “with this little game you’re playing—”
When he opened his eyes, Malfoy was waiting for him, lounging behind the glass display counter with a lazy smile.
Harry thought about Malfoy saying,
Harry shook his head wildly, wheezing.
Draco hummed. “Weren’t we in the middle of a conversation? I’m sorry, I’m only just realizing I interrupted you with my mouth,” he grinned, unrepentant, radiant.

Draco groaned, dropping his head back to the sofa. “

? Harry thought everyone should be able to celebrate the end of the war. And he was ticked off about having to play the role of Honorable Gracious Benevolent Savior, and he wanted to stick it to everyone, so he invited Draco as his date. Draco was a flurry of nerves for weeks beforehand, dragging them both to Savile Row nearly every night after work, experimenting with different ways of styling Harry’s hair, backing out in fits of panic and then wringing his hands, saying that actually yes, he did want to go.
Harry shook his head, chuckling, “Well, there
In mid-November, towards the end of Harry’s time training with Malfoy, Malfoy got them tickets to see Jimmy Eat World at Scala. It was the biggest show Harry had been to yet—Malfoy’s goodbye present to him, he said. They arrived early, waiting in line on the pavement before the doors opened to get a good spot in the pit, close to the stage. They were packed in shoulder to shoulder, passing the flask Malfoy had snuck in back and forth. Harry couldn’t remember the last time he’d been so grateful to be a wizard as when Malfoy waved a hand at him, discreetly casting a wandless bladder emptying charm. When the band came out, Harry threw back his head and howled.
“I cannot
,” he smirked.
Pansy rolled her eyes, “Well, I refuse to take responsibility for that. I’m an excellent kisser.”
Harry couldn’t let Draco out of his sight. It was taking all of his self-control to stop himself from pushing Draco up against every nearby surface and snogging him senseless, so instead he found himself hovering by Draco’s side, enthusiastically shaking his colleagues’ hands and standing a bit too close so their shoulders brushed. He even brought Draco around to hobnob with the high-level bureaucrats he normally detested talking to. Draco, of course, charmed them utterly (and Harry saw how they wrinkled their noses when he first walked up, the utter twats), easily following even the most boring discussions of Ministry political minutiae, and being generally brilliant. Harry couldn’t stand it for long though, and he placed his hand on the small of Draco’s back, leading him over to a group of Aurors in the corner by the bar. It took Harry a few moments to realize that he hadn’t dropped his hand once they’d started talking, and he was just standing there, touching Draco in a way that was so familiar, almost possessive, and he clenched his jaw against a sudden spike of arousal and his fingers tightened involuntarily. He felt Draco tense, and then, slowly, he relaxed into Harry’s touch, and leaned
“Usually they either want to give it rough to a Death Eater or it’s like a fetish for them.” He shrugged, “I’m not really into either of those scenarios.”
Luna turned to kiss her cheek. “It’s alright,” she said mildly. “Anyways, I suppose I’m not surprised Draco didn’t mention it, seeing as he and Harry were both rather poor sports about the whole thing…”
“Everyone’s going to be smug,” Draco continued, “Insufferable, the lot of them. I assure you they won’t let me recover from this breakup in peace; it’ll be right back to business as usual, trying to lock us in broom cupboards or set us up on blind dates with each other…” he shook his head, laughing, turning his head into Harry’s chest with a dramatic groan.
Dropping his forearms to the table, Harry took a few deep, guttery breaths.

humble—and wait a minute, who said it would be my head in your arse? Why doesn’t the universe want you to shove your head into my arse?”
Draco smiled softly. “Yeah, he’s—he’s nice. Smiles a lot, good table manners. Laughed at all my jokes.”
gathered at the base of Harry’s spine. His mind was slow like poured honey in this drowsy torpor, fogged over like a warm window on a cold morning, sedated and stripped to base instincts. The urge to arch back, to open his mouth, damp and hot, throbbed through him—a viscous need, an indistinct tugging at the edges of his consciousness, hovering just out of reach yet pooling all throughout his body, inexorable, like the ocean tide coming in, slow and sure and steadily vanquishing everything in its wake. He tried to focus, tried to wake up but his eyes kept slipping shut, powerless against the cradling heat of the bed, the dip of the mattress enveloping him like a nest, the slow rut of Draco’s hips. Harry couldn’t move, limbs weak and pinned down by sleep, tingling with heavy, somnolent arousal. He just wanted to
On Friday the twenty-second of June, Harry and Draco clocked a full day at Gringotts, dropped the cats off with Pansy, warded Grimmauld to the teeth, loaded their bags onto the motorbike and headed to the Ministry. The grueling transatlantic jump dropped them off in New York City, where all of a sudden it was lunchtime again, and Draco insisted they eat some bagels while they waited for their next portkey to activate. They had two shorter jumps after that, routing through Atlanta, which was a hotbed for muggle airline traffic in addition to being a convenient location for a portkey stopover. By the time they landed in California, Harry was exhausted and barely awake, but as they walked to their hotel the warm humid air felt soft on his skin and Draco was a buzzing, giddy presence at his side, clutching at Harry’s arm, words sticking and tumbling out of his mouth as he ran over their plans for the week.
“What if this is it?” Harry asked.
“Oi, love, is this a wish or a lecture?”
“Greg!” Draco hissed, “You can’t just ask someone that; it’s not polite—”
They landed just inside the doorway of Draco’s flat—he’d thought it might be a bit presumptuous to apparate them directly into the bedroom—and Potter stumbled slightly. Draco steadied him, hands around Potter's biceps.
discreetly on the side, you know. In those days I was rather in the habit of doing as my parents expected.” He grimaced. “Then, I spent the first year after the war re-evaluating everything I’d ever thought and every plan I’d ever made for myself.”
“Are you serious? We fuck in the loo at the Ministry Singles Happy Hour and I don’t hear a thing from you
, and Harry was struck with the absurd realization that he and Draco Malfoy were friends. He laughed out loud at the thought and, grinning wildly, shoved Malfoy square in the chest, and Malfoy shoved him right back, his mouth falling into a surprised smile. And when the show ended and they were drifting toward the exit, Harry turned to Malfoy and said, “I’m starving, want to grab a bite?”
He was flushing, and he looked a bit twitchy, nervous even, which Draco wasn’t used to, so, unable to think of anything else to do, Draco joined him as the chorus swelled, throwing his hands in the air and shouting the words, feeling the stress of the week leak out of his muscles as he summoned his wine and they danced around the kitchen.
On Saturday, after a week in LA, Harry and Draco packed up the bike and drove about two hours up the coast to Ventura, where Warped Tour was stopping. They’d booked a cheap hotel by the venue, the Seaside Park fairgrounds. It was right on the beach, hot and bright under the Southern California sun, stages set out on the cracked, baking concrete, merch tents forming borders, mazelike. Crowding in front of the dingy hotel mirror, Harry smudged black liner around his eyes while Draco magicked his hair to stick in the perfect swoop across his forehead. Harry was clad in the Paramore t-shirt he’d gotten when he and Draco saw them play at Slam Dunk Fest the week before Ron and Hermione’s wedding. They’d released a new album since then, which frankly, fucking rocked, so he and Draco were both stoked to see them play (plus, of course, Harry would never complain about seeing Hayley Williams perform). Draco had brought his old New Found Glory t-shirt from when he had seen them in LA all those years ago. That threadbare t-shirt was one of the first muggle things Draco had ever bought for himself, back when he was still angry all the time, halfway across the world and so very alone. Harry looked over at him when they were packed tight in front of the stage, worn t-shirt dark with sweat as he flung himself into the tangled mess of a mosh pit, losing himself in the fray, this time with Harry at his side.
Draco said, “Hello, muggle policeman?” and Harry said, “Yeah, and you’re David Bowie? You look… I mean… Wow.”
'Lying is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off' is the song Draco sings to Harry during the Panic! At the Disco set at Reading

Draco cackled, sitting back up to snatch Harry’s champagne out of his hand, downing half of it.
It wasn’t unbearable yet, the jealously, only a slow, creeping vine, winding around his insides and cutting off his sunlight, choking off his air ever so slowly. It whispered to him, when he saw them together,
(See the end of the chapter for
Blaise arrived first, of course, sweeping imperiously through the floo, trousers pressed, shirt crisp. When José showed up a few minutes later, they settled instantly into the easy camaraderie of wealthy, tall, good-looking people recognizing an equal at the top of the food chain. It was Draco’s inheritance, too, and he could hold his own with them if he cared to, but it had long been clear that he didn’t quite fit there anymore. Once he had covered himself in tattoos, and pierced up his face, and worn ratty muggle clothes and smeary eyeliner, and spent his weekends brawling with strangers on beer-soaked concrete under thudding speakers—well, he had pretty decisively rejected his inheritance. One of Harry’s favorite things was watching Draco schmooze with the upper echelons at posh events. The dissonance between what he had been bred for and what he had chosen was stark and apparent and sparked a little fire in Harry’s chest every time.
As they were walking out, Ron turned to Harry, “So, how was Draco’s date with the healer?”
“Oh,” Harry interrupted smoothly, “I won’t be done with you then, if that’s what you’re worried about. I’m going to make you come now, right here, in my mouth, and then I’m going to take you to bed, and rim you until you’re hard again, and then I’m going to fuck you into the mattress, and you’re going to come
Harry pouted, “Why the long face? I caught the snitch, you know, I’m sure you saw,” he smirked. Draco stared at him stonily.
He was gorgeous; there was no getting around it, no point even trying. Distinctive, with his pale coloring and facial piercings and tousled, sideswept hair, his tattoos and tight jeans. Not everyone’s cup of tea, to be sure. But he drew the eye. Men were always interested in Draco. Women too, although he was never interested back. And José wore his good looks with the sort of effortlessness that betrayed a very concerted effort, so Harry wasn't surprised that he would have a keen sense of aesthetic appreciation.
“Shut up,” Draco huffed, swatting him on the arm, tilting his hips up so that Harry slid in a little deeper. He whined again, clenching around Harry and bucking his hips up.
Draco buried his head in his hands as Harry and Neville dissolved into hysterics.
“And my hair—”
Ron had encouraged him with a saucy wink
“Oh no you don’t,” said Ron, “One moment to be smug? After waiting
Harry frowned.
“Oi!” Neville broke in, “It’s not just the shagging! It’s all the…” He waved a large hand vaguely at them, “Compatibility. I wish you would shag
“Anyways!” Hermione cut in, “We need to know!”
José took a hefty sip of wine. “It’s Friday,” he shrugged, “It’s my only day of this weekend. I hope I’m not intruding? Draco invited me…”
Harry let out a wet laugh, relief flooding warm through his limbs, making him lightheaded. “Yeah, because I slept here, you arsehole—” he gestured at the cot, blushing and busying himself pouring Draco a glass of water.
“Sixty-nine!” Seamus roared, sitting up out of nowhere; Harry had sworn he’d been snoring on the rug a moment ago. He pointed at Harry and Draco, fixing them with the wild, focused eyes of a prophet, and repeated solemnly, “Sixty-nine.” He nodded once and collapsed into Dean’s lap.
“I really love you too,” he said, suddenly solemn.
Harry smiled at her, “Yeah, I’m so happy for them.”
“Yeah,” Harry took a hit, relishing the burn in his throat, “You and me, alone together.”
“But, I want—”

Draco swayed in the doorway, blinking.
“Well that’s—” Potter inhaled deep and let it out in a huff, “That’s rather depressing. Fancy a shot?”
came thudding through the speakers. Draco struck a pose, a hand on his hip thrown jauntily to the side, a sultry gaze turned on the assembled drunkards bobbing their heads to the beat. He took a deep breath in, and then—the music changed. The bar erupted in whoops and cheers. Draco whipped his head around to see Potter clutching the microphone stand as he swayed, mouth gaping open with soundless mirth.
“Anyways! I’m always right, and you know it, so
“Oh God,” Draco groaned, dropping his head back with a thunk against the wall, Adam’s apple bobbing in his pale throat as he swallowed. “Not this again.”
Neville snorted. “Sure, Harry, for a weekend, to see a quidditch match, or whatever. Have you taken an international portkey across an ocean for two weeks of gallivanting up the California coast with Ron? No?” Harry spluttered. “See,” Neville nodded, sure and solemn, “That’s something boyfriends do.”
The interdepartmental memo flapped around Draco’s head, poking at his shoulder insistently. He tried waving it off—he had work to do for Merlin’s sake—but it refused to take no for an answer, jabbing at him with increasing belligerence until he snatched it out of the air in frustration, crumpling it into a ball before taking a deep breath and smoothing it out on his desk. Hermione looked up from across the room.
,” Malfoy muttered.
Harry had been practically crawling out of his skin all week leading up to Susan’s party. He had seen Draco once, in the atrium at the end of the day, and they had chatted for a few minutes before heading home. He’d managed to comport himself like a sane person, stringing together full sentences and only stammering a little, despite the buzzing in his ears and tightness in his throat.
, singlehandedly running the kids camp every summer, showing up to every charity ball without complaint, unfailingly kind to every staff member. It was probably just a harmless bit of fun to him. So Draco steadfastly ignored every infuriating jab. He remained perfectly restrained at all times, the very picture of composure in the face of Potter’s constant tormenting. It wasn’t easy, what with Potter always sauntering around in his leathers, looking unfairly delectable, winning matches left and right and grinning at Draco afterwards, sidling up to him at the afterparty and murmuring
Downstairs, the kitchen was a disaster, strewn with the detritus of a wild gathering. Harry swept a pile of dirty dishes out of the way, clearing just enough space on the counter to prep a fry-up. He needed something greasy in his stomach. Just as he was putting the finishing touches together—buttering the toast, lifting the eggs from the pan—he heard Draco shuffling into the kitchen, groaning out a greeting. He turned, wielding two full plates.
to pump himself up while he'd been getting ready to go out tonight. Only Pansy knew of his deep and abiding Rihanna obsession. He caught her eye across the table and smirked. Harry had no idea what he was in for.
“Even though I love you and everything now… you’re still my best friend.”
“I said yes, of course. What else could I have said? I couldn’t exactly tell Potter to go fuck off, could I?”
“No, really,” Draco leaned forward, elbows on his knees, “It’s not like that—”
He peeled his work gloves off and threw them on the bench with perhaps a little more force than was necessary, unstrapping his vision-magnifying headgear and smoothing his hands down the front of his robes.
“Nice one?” Draco yelped, “Good god, Greg, did you just ask the universe to manifest Potter’s head
'L.G.F.U.A.D.' by Motion City Soundtrack is the song Draco queues up in the sitting room on New Year’s Day
Harry laughed again, warmth bubbling up in his chest, “Leave off, Ron, it’s a holiday—can’t we get one night of peace from any of you?”
Draco smirked. “Harry,” he clasped their hands together, “My wish, on this New Year, is that you and I find love and settle down… with…” he winked, “whomever we’re meant to be with.”
“It’s the
“You can hang your robes here,” Malfoy indicated a coat stand by the door as he crossed the room to grab some clothes out of a wardrobe next to the bed, and retreated into the loo. Harry remained, blinking slowly at Malfoy’s flat. It was a small studio; the walls were painted a soft, silvery sage; Harry touched the pad of his finger to the wall next to him but to his disappointment it felt utterly like a wall, and not at all like a sage leaf. He turned sadly away from the wall, his gaze drawn to the bed tucked into the far corner, plush and heaped with pillows, draped in gauzy hangings embroidered with winking silver and gold constellations. The bone-deep exhaustion of Harry’s day thrummed through his veins and he wanted desperately to throw himself across the room and collapse onto that bed, draw the hangings around and burrow into the fluffy duvet. He actually took a step forward before he realized that might be considered less than polite, particularly since he had never even
tonight—”
“Draco,” Harry was in front of him, all of a sudden, reaching out a hand, fingers brushing tentatively across Draco’s shoulder. He swallowed. “I’m sorry too, I shouldn’t have— I think… we need to talk.”
“That was… that escalated quickly.”
one morning in bed—” Ron whooped enthusiastically. “But no, we just brushed it off! We just woke up at the same time, you know…” he raised a meaningful eyebrow and Hermione giggled into her water while Ron sniggered, “It was nothing, really.”
“Are you
He raised a skeptical brow, “You want to get up on stage and sing a song with me?”
Harry frowned, “What—"
“Just two weeks ago you were whinging about getting old!”
gonna give you up, Draco—"
“Don’t be silly, there haven’t been any shooting stars tonight,” Luna said, very seriously. Ginny kissed the side of her head.
“Yes, and I’m sure it’ll have three more envelopes inside,” Draco muttered as he tore it open. He paused, staring at the papers in his hand. “Harry… what is this?”
“Yeah,” Harry sighed, “Absolutely sure. We get that a lot, but we’re actually just best friends.”
He dropped to one knee.
Harry was not jealous of Draco and José. He wasn’t. He had assured Ron and Hermione of it after brunch that weekend. He had told Ginny and Luna— emphatically! —that he had no desire to be in José’s place, and he was nothing but overjoyed to see Draco with someone who cared about him. He told Neville and Goyle, winding their way through the greenhouse paths, that José was sweet, and generous, and took Draco out to expensive restaurants where Harry couldn’t pronounce half the things on the menu and therefore was clearly a better suited partner for Draco than Harry could ever be. So no, he wasn’t jealous at all.
“I actually wanted to ask you tonight— I was sort of wondering if, well, you might want to… date?”
“Excellent,” Harry beamed, tugging Draco in and kissing him soundly.
“I don’t know,” he waved a hand despairingly, “I just
Draco dropped his hands to Harry’s knees, ghosting his fingers up his muscled thighs, up over his torso and down his arms, back up and around his neck, tangling in his hair.
Draco smirked, “Am I?”
, he told himself—and now he was going on two years as a regular customer. The muted olive-painted walls were lined with wooden shelves sporting glass jars full of fresh herb and psychedelic mushrooms, but what really set Malfoy’s shop apart were the edible and apothecary products. Potions, lozenges, gummy sweets and chocolates, tinctures and lotions and body oils—Malfoy infused them all with marijuana and mushrooms and magic and over the past two years his humble shop had become Harry’s safe haven, his respite from work and fame and the brooding emptiness of Grimmauld Place.
“Well…” Harry faltered and frowned, thinking. Didn’t he ever go on holiday alone with someone he wasn’t romantically interested in? “I’ve gone on holiday with Ron,” he proclaimed, triumphant.
“Ok sure,” Harry huffed, “I don’t think I need to worry about it yet, anyways.”
“Yes, lemon bars. There’s a rather swanky muggle establishment a few blocks over—I had a truly transcendent lemon bar there a couple of months ago; it’s been haunting my dreams...”
“Watch it Ronald, or see if you get any
“That’s alright,” Harry smiled beatifically up at him. “I want you to.” He dipped his head back down, brushed his lips against the head of Draco’s cock, still gazing up at him over the rims of his glasses. Draco shook his head frantically, “But I want— I want you to—”
“Oh?”
Draco swept Harry to his chest in the bedroom doorway, kissing him once, twice, burying his nose in Harry’s hair.
“No,” he whispered, “You’re not.”
“No speech this year,” Draco said, squeezing Harry’s hand hard and digging deep to keep the tremor out of his voice, “Just this.”
An hour later found them squeezed into a small booth with Ron and Hermione. Draco’s thigh was pressed up against his, and Harry’s arm was slung round the back of the bench, his fingertips grazing Draco’s shoulder whenever one of them moved. He felt warm and content, remembering how Draco had leaned in and asked Harry back to his flat last year, and thinking about what he could say to Draco at the end of the night. Ron was asking Draco enthusiastically about gay wizarding clubs, kicking Harry’s shin repeatedly under the table and saying “eh?” in an increasingly suggestive manner.
Harry’s mouth fell open. “Did—did you just propose? We only just agreed we had feelings like five minutes ago! I’m literally still covered in come—yours and mine—”
as he seated himself fully on Draco’s cock.
Draco clenched his teeth, counting to ten in his head.
“Really? I honestly wasn’t sure it would go anywhere—when I talked to him at Mungo’s he seemed so… clean cut.” Ron laughed.
“Indeed.”
Harry’s eyes snapped to his just as he pressed back in, a little further. “I—
He brought the joint back up and sucked in hard, leaning back toward Draco, who was waiting with his mouth open in a soft
At his touch, Draco let out a strangled moan, arching back, and Potter was fucking into him, panting harshly into his ear and Draco was dizzy with it, his breath coming out in high-pitched whines. And then he was spilling over Potter’s fingers, wound together with his own, and his entire body tightened around Potter, and he heard Potter cry out hoarsely as his hips jerked and then slowed, and he collapsed forward onto Draco’s back, dropping them both down onto the bed.
Draco whipped his head around, eyes narrowed, “Harry?”
Anyways, he was healthy now, and he kept in good shape, and skinny boys seemed to be rather in on the music scene, so he didn’t have much time for being self-conscious nowadays either. Tonight, his jeans were tight and black and crowned with a blood red spike belt, and topped off with the Black Parade jacket, and Harry felt self-assured, armored. While Draco was the high fashion mastermind, Harry had come to enjoy having a bit of an aesthetic himself over the past few years. There was some power in all of it—clothes, makeup, tattoos, nail polish, piercings, the way he cut his hair. It all allowed him to say something to the world around him without actually saying anything, which was a relief, because most of the time the thing Harry wanted to say to the world around him was
Draco’s eyes fluttered open as he stretched his arms overhead, capturing Harry to pull him in and kiss him, sleepy and slow. In the midst of it, Harry felt the minty shock of a breath-freshening charm. He jerked instinctively, “A little warning might be nice?” He murmured against Draco’s lips.
“Can I touch you?” He breathed, and Draco nodded, whispered
“At my birthday party next weekend,” Susan cut in, throwing him a knowing look. Harry made a mental note to buy Susan an extremely nice vintage for her birthday.

, he heard Hermione’s voice in his head,
, while I’m inside you. That’s what you want, isn’t it?” Draco’s whole body tensed and then sagged against the wall, and he whimpered helplessly, and Harry just smiled up at him, and bent down, taking him into his mouth again.
, but every time Potter stuck his head through Draco’s office door, or tapped his shoulder in the cafeteria line, he felt keenly the certain futility of his attempts. He remembered what Potter’s hair felt like in his hands, or the taste of his mouth, and he couldn’t pretend.
Harry snorted. “In Polyjuice, maybe.”
“Fuck it,” he murmured against Draco’s lips, “I owe you fifty galleons.”
“Potter,” he inclined his head, “Long day?”
He laughed and bent to press a kiss to the space between Draco’s shoulder blades. “See that’s the thing. I was thinking you could call me Harry.”
And Draco said,
They took the bike to Wembley, relishing the envious looks when they dismounted. The queue already wound down the pavement and they made their way to the end, plopping down on the concrete to await the opening of the doors. They’d arrived early enough to get a good spot in the pit and they weren’t disappointed when they filed in, ducking between clusters of bodies to edge up closer to the stage until the crowd began to thicken, turned from a maze to a wall. The boundaries collapsed, though, as the lights dimmed and the masses moved as one, everyone surging forward, closer, closer, filling all the spaces between each other, a steady, rolling wave from the back towards the stage.
. Surely Potter wouldn’t actually try to be his
, which Harry agreed was the perfect album for singing up the California coast. Draco clung tight behind him, wind howling in their ears and swallowing their words as they let loose, shouting out,
“Oh, piss off,” Harry laughed. “I’m going for a shower. Will you be done in time for a quick bite before I go? I was just going to heat up leftovers.”
), short-sleeve, white button-down shirts with little badges on the pockets, and equally tight black trousers with shiny boots and a belt equipped with various accoutrements, including what the package had assured him were real, functioning handcuffs. A cute young bartender had been eyeing him flirtatiously and giving him extremely generous pours, so by the time Harry was two drinks in he was already feeling a bit warm and fuzzy. He was chatting with Seamus and Lee, both of whom worked in Magical Games and Sports, when a sudden movement from the floo in the corner caught his eye. A tall, lean figure was unfolding gracefully and turning to survey the room—Harry’s jaw dropped. It was Draco. His hair had been charmed a bright, shimmering red-orange, with bits of the natural platinum showing at the tips, and it was slicked back on the sides and teased into a pompadour on top. His eyelids were painted like a sunset, and Harry was certain he was wearing blue mascara. He had glitter on his cheekbones, for Merlin’s sake, and a bright scarlet lightning bolt painted diagonally across his face, edged in electric blue. But that wasn’t even the worst of it. His lithe frame was swathed in a clingy jumpsuit of some shimmering silver fabric, with electric blue and scarlet pinstripes to match his face paint. It was almost cruel—the neckline was cut like a suit jacket, with a crisp lapel, leaving a deep V of torso exposed and—Harry gulped—there was glitter along his collarbones too, and down his sternum. Seamus and Lee’s voices faded into a distant buzz as his feet started moving across the room of their own accord.
Harry beamed down at him and leant forward, brushing their noses together.
As they slipped out the door of the restaurant, trying not to draw any more attention to themselves, Harry’s shoulder knocked against Malfoy’s again, and he reached down and twined their fingers together. Malfoy made a small, pleased noise and looked away, still blushing, as he tugged Harry back towards his flat.
When they parted at the doorway, Harry wasn't sure what to say. He thanked Malfoy for inviting him, stuttering a bit. Malfoy just shrugged, stuffed his hands in his pockets, muttered
“Like this,” Harry breathed, spreading his thighs and drawing his knees up, exposing himself to Draco. Looking down at him, Draco swallowed thickly and nodded once, hard. Harry summoned a bottle of lube from a drawer in his nightstand and pressed it into Draco’s hand. Coating his fingers, he reached down, watching Harry’s eyes widen and his breath quicken. He worked Harry open slowly, kissing him, until Harry was panting and squirming beneath him, and he huffed out, “God, Draco, are you going to make me beg—” and Draco grinned wickedly down at him, “I want to hear you ask for it.”
Draco unwound his arm from Potter’s torso and closed his eyes. He’d been a fool.
Potter smiled a small, sleepy smile, “I’d like to stay—if you’re sure you don’t mind?”
“Or,” he continued, undeterred, “You could follow me to the loos in a minute…” He grinned, crooked and lewd, “I’ll give you a first-class blow job, I mean, you’re Harry Potter, obviously you’ll get my best effort…”
There was no shortage of men looking at Draco, and he danced and flirted, even snogged a few, but whenever Harry waggled his eyebrows at Draco in their precise way that meant

Harry looked up and Draco was standing over him, holding out a cup of ice water. Harry clutched at it gratefully as Draco sank into the chair next to him, smoothly turning and introducing himself to the ancient woman, whose name was Ethel, and who was apparently a distantly related Prewett, Harry didn’t quite catch it.

“I could listen to the noises you make all day, too,” he continued, “Maybe I’ll get you fired from the ministry,” he winked, “Keep you here and fuck you on my lunch breaks instead.”
He slid into his seat and took a long swallow, then slowly set his glass down. “It was Draco,” he said tonelessly. Hermione’s hands flew to her mouth.
Draco’s throat spasmed and his brows drew down.
“Yes,” Harry nodded defensively, “Draco understands, listen to him.”
“Oh, I’m definitely in,” Neville chuckled.
“Ok,” he breathed, “Ok. When you imagine what it could be like—you know... love, or whatever—what do you think about?”
His blood ran hot then cold, and he shivered hard. He wasn’t sick. No, he was out of his goddamn mind, that’s what he was. What had he been thinking, agreeing to officiate Ron and Hermione’s wedding? The most important day of their lives—
Back at his flat, Draco showered, brushed his teeth, dressed carefully (fitted grey trousers and a slate blue cashmere jumper that brought out his eyes), fixed his hair, brushed his teeth again, contemplated a quick whiskey—though it was only 11 am—but ultimately decided against it when he realized he would have to brush his teeth a third time. He walked into the sitting room. He looked at the fireplace. He took a deep breath, and, before he could think better of it, stepped into the flames. He emerged into a dim parlour. Before he could take in any of it, Harry was striding towards him—it appeared Draco had caught him pacing back and forth across the room. His hair was a wild mess, of course, and Draco noticed his socked feet, of all things—another strange new intimacy, this year, seeing Harry Potter in his home, in his socks, on Christmas Eve.
Malfoy snorted. “You don’t. I swear you wore that exact…” His gaze trailed over Harry’s body with a sneer, “
Malfoy blinked at him, and the panic in his chest spiked. Did he
Draco went very still.
“I’m so sorry,” Harry said, “for everything.” He was so close, and Draco could see him straining to keep his distance, his body swaying forward and jerking back infinitesimally.
, you know?” He raised an eyebrow meaningfully.
“I mean, yes,” Draco laughed, “I’d like that.”
Malfoy regarded him steadily for a few seconds. “You were just in the area?”
“Oh,” Draco said again, all his breath leaving in a rush.
“Four! Three!”
“No you didn’t, Harry, you tried and failed. Don’t get it twisted. I, on the other hand, successfully sabotaged the wish—while remaining respectful of the collective, I might add—” He inclined his head at Luna, “I wished that Harry and I would fall in love and settle down with whomever we’re meant to be with.” He paused uncomfortably, “No pressure, of course.”
“Why don’t you do that Rihanna song where she just says
Luna turned her protuberant eyes on him. “Well, you know about our wish for Draco and Harry, of course—"
Draco did buy the next round, and Wood was quite cordial to him after that. Of course, everyone else at the table was delighted that Potter had brought him along, particularly when he absolutely decimated the other teams in a round of questions on British League history. Wood appeared to be some sort of quidditch savant, spouting off statistics and rosters and all-time great plays with a truly insane gleam in his eyes. Or perhaps he was extremely sane and Draco was just biased. In any case, Draco was soon significantly more drunk than he usually got at trivia and expending a considerable amount of his mental energy avoiding looking at Potter and ensuring that their arms didn’t touch whenever either of them moved. In his distraction, he missed an obvious question on the prehistoric troll wars and, frustrated, got up to go to the bar again. To his even greater frustration, Potter joined him. He bumped their elbows together as they were waiting on their drinks, and Draco stiffened.
Draco groped dimly for the edge of the bed behind him, dropping unsteadily to a seat as he smoothed out the cover. A photo of Harry’s face was plastered across it, Draco watched on a loop as photo-Harry worried his lower lip self-consciously, and then, likely at the direction of the cameraperson, smoothed his brow and attempted a nervous smile. Emblazoned across the top was the headline
He certainly never would have expected it, but it was unavoidable now, that Draco was his best friend. Of course, Ron and Hermione were his best friends too, but the three of them were different from anyone else. They were more like family at this point. Besides, Ron and Hermione were their own unit now. Harry knew the two of them shared more with each other than they did with him—and not just sex (although obviously, they did
Draco had a slight panic. Was he that obviously smitten? Was Potter about to kindly remind him that he was very straight and very taken? “Yes…” he replied slowly, “do you have a problem with it?”
Every morning Harry woke up resolved. He would open his mouth when he walked into the kitchen to the sight of Draco busying himself over the teakettle, feelings clawing their way up his throat, and then Draco would turn around, yawning, holding out a mug, and the words would die in his mouth, and Harry would take the cup from his hands, mutely grateful. At any moment he feared a torrent might burst out of him, yet he was frozen.
“What. The Fuck.” he muttered again, and then, when no answer was forthcoming, “What the
Harry pushed him down on the bed.
“Ignore him.” Draco floated loftily into the room, settling himself at the table and shaking out the paper. “What do you have for us today?”
“I’ve thought about this every day,” Draco said quietly, and Harry’s eyes widened and his mouth opened soundlessly. “Every time you walk by in your leathers, every time you sit on my fucking
“I should go.” Potter said.
Ron pulled aside the curtain, stepping in and closing it behind them.
“Eurgh,” Pansy chucked a glitter-spackled noisemaker at him. “You all sicken me. If I ever use the phrase
“Fair enough,” Ron wrapped an arm around her, pulling her close to his side.
And then, the morning after, when José had left, Draco smiled shyly and said, quiet, a bit giddy,
“Well yeah, that’s a few months, innit?”
“Doesn’t it? Get to it, Draco.”  Harry made a clucking noise at him and José laughed.
Draco shuddered, clenching around Harry’s fingers, “
Harry shook his head once, quick.
. He snapped his attention back halfway through Malfoy asking why Harry hadn’t been at the pub quiz and found himself saying, “I was breaking up with Oliver.” Malfoy’s brows knitted together for the briefest moment before he smoothed his face into something resembling placid concern, offering his apologies and well wishes, to which Harry simply replied, “It’s alright. He talked about quidditch too much.”
“Well if that’s all then,” Draco said, draining his drink.
Harry grinned, “Well, as our dear friends have so kindly and recently reminded me, it’s been a while since I’ve had a good cuddle… so enjoy your last breaths on this earth, it’ll all be over for you soon...”
“Well,” Draco backtracked, “you can certainly leave, if you like. But it’s late, and you’re welcome to stay as well.” He arranged his expression into one that would not betray which of those options he preferred.
“What the fuck?” he muttered to himself, looking around. No one appeared to be approaching as the song—it was actually quite catchy—continued to blare in the background. Draco allowed himself to stew silently for approximately three more seconds, watching the mystery singer shimmy awkwardly on a stage, flanked by two generic blonde background dancers.
Harry stumbled back to the table in a haze. “Alright mate?” Ron looked up at him as he approached, “you look like you’ve just seen your boggart.”
“What,” Harry blanched, “You think he could give me fashion advice?”
A moment of silence, then Harry sat upright, sighing. “I know what I need to do.”
deep end, like, deeper than Harry had bargained for. He hadn’t even known Malfoy worked at Gringotts until someone mentioned him last week. It wasn’t a surprise; no one else would hire him, not with the Dark Mark and the memories so fresh. Gringotts didn’t particularly care, though, and fuck if that wasn’t what brought Harry there, too.
“Go on, then,” he said, quiet, unhurried. “Get undressed.”
! Oh my god, Harry, I can’t believe…” Draco let out a slightly hysterical shriek of laughter and took another swig. “He told me to see a fucking mind healer. He honest to Merlin was like
Harry’s smile widened. “Wicked.”
Draco always was rebelling a little bit against his upbringing and he got a kind of savage pleasure from making the upper classes squirm when he stalked into a room in a perfectly-tailored suit, crisp accent falling from his pierced lips, thoughtfully perusing the wine list with his lacquered nails.
, because I am not insane.”
“You’re… You’re leaving?” And then, wholly unexpectedly, Draco’s chest clenched as he imagined walking into a new team meeting, one where all the players arrived on time.
“Isn’t that rather the point?” Draco tried for a haughty tone, but it came out a bit breathless.
“Oh,” José brightened, “That sounds marvelous.”
In the early morning of the second Sunday in July they headed into the San Francisco International Portkey Station, the bike and their bags and everything they had bought shrunk down into their traveling cases. In the station, Harry's throat went tight as a wave of melancholy flooded his chest. He didn't want this time with Draco to end—it was silly, he knew, since it wasn't like he wouldn't spend time with Draco once they got home. But he didn't want to leave the bright sun of the beach, didn't want to go back to sleeping in his room alone. Before the Portkey activated, Harry drew Draco into a tight hug, as if he was seeing him off, as if they weren’t going together. Draco huffed and squeezed him back, and Harry murmured, gruff into his ear, “Happy birthday.”
Ginny cackled, “I caught them at it last week, I’ve been dying to let it slip.”
different. His clothes were different too—Harry could only recall Malfoy swanning about in his school robes, every inch the imperious pureblood, but now he was wearing muggle clothes—his feet on the desk were tucked into black high-top Converse sneakers, paired with skinny black trousers and a black

Instead, the presentation screen at the front of the room flickered to life and Draco was suddenly confronted with a scrawny ginger muggle snapping his fingers and crooning,
“Of course you were, love,” Pansy patted his hand.

“We’re friends, aren’t we?”
“What do you mean you never
,” she winked.
, Potter—”
“Passing out sounds about right,” Draco responded, tipping back the last sip of wine in his glass and stifling a yawn.
“All the rooms only had the one bed, so do try not to suffocate me in the night, I know what a frightful cuddler you are,” Draco said.
“Yeah,” Harry let out a short, hollow laugh. “I only just figured it out.” He took another long swallow. “I wanted to ask him for a pint around the holidays.” He was horrified to hear his voice cracking slightly. There was a moment of silence in which Harry replayed the moment Draco’s eyes had flashed with hurt before shuttering blank and closed. “Oh god,” he moaned, dropping his face into his hands, “I’m a fucking coward and I’ve ruined my chances and I deserve it, too.”
“Go on,” Draco said softly, low and smooth, like syrup.
Harry laughed thickly. “Yeah, I just—”
“It was last Christmas,” he began miserably. “I was just figuring things out and I ran into him at the Leaky. He was really understanding, and one thing led to another, you know—” he flushed and cleared his throat. “Anyways, we ended up going back to his and honestly? It was fantastic.” He took a deep breath. “But the next morning I woke up and I just freaked out. I mean it was
Potter’s eyes widened and he snaked a hand into Draco’s hair, kissing him fiercely for a moment before pulling back to reply, “Oh
“Malfoy…” Potter began uneasily, but Draco waved him off, swaying slightly and inclining his head towards their table. “Come on Potter, time to get back to the festivities.” Potter still looked a bit distressed, but he followed Draco off the bar, and thankfully didn’t try say anything else. Draco was relieved; he didn’t trust himself to open his mouth again.
“Right,” Harry laughed nervously, “Well I suppose I wasn’t being very subtle… I mean, you look pretty spectacular—the costume! The costume is spectacular.” God, he should never open his mouth again for the rest of his life.
Draco threw his head back; his laugh was bright. “Motion City Soundtrack? I should write them a thank you card. We’ll make it the first dance at our wedding.”
Harry laughed shakily, a bit too loud. He was still feeling a little wobbly about the knees but with every bite of hors d’oeuvre and every fortifying sip of whatever punch they were ladling out at the bar, he felt the stress leeching out of his skin. And then he looked up and Draco was striding over, sleek grey dress robes billowing, smiling with all his teeth. He swept Harry into a crushing hug and whispered in his ear,
Harry knocked their shoulders together.
“I guess. I would just feel a bit… nervous. Since I don’t know what I’m doing at all,” he went red and took a swig. “I’d want to know the other person would tell me if I weren’t doing it right, or something.”
Ron plunked a plate of cauliflower cheese in front of him, molten and bubbling inside, crisply browned on top. Harry sighed appreciatively as he dug in.
When Malfoy emerged, Harry stared at him mutely for a couple of seconds before realizing that his mouth was hanging open. Then he had a slight panic.
Hermione sniffed). When Harry was finally ready to leave, he was full of ziti and wine and love for his friends. As he stepped out of the floo at Grimmauld, Circe came skidding around the corner hissing before she realized it was him, at which point she launched herself at his trouser leg and demanded to be picked up. Harry obliged, carrying her upstairs, and he went to bed, feeling like he wasn’t so alone after all.
Harry’s eyes stung. It was too smoky in here. The silence felt thick, anticipatory. No one moved. Harry felt a faint buzzing sensation, a tickle on his skin that he couldn’t scratch, a sound too low to make out, a ripple wavering just outside the edge of his vision—he broke the moment.
Healer Andrade pulled himself together smoothly. “Well, Mr. Malfoy, you’ve just regrown half of your ribcage and quite a few organs below, so we’ll be keeping you here for a few more days to ensure that everything heals properly. You’re on a variety of potions and I’ll be performing some regenerative spellwork once daily. We’ll send you home with a topical for scarring.”
“Harry, wait, stop—” he gasped, tugging him off.
“Ah, then let me say I am honored to be a part of your grand debut,” he said with a mocking bow, straightening up to take his drink from the bartender and slap his money on the counter.
And Neville was clearly mouthing the word
“Hey!” Neville leaned forward, “I have very nice skin.” It was true; despite all the time he spent in the greenhouses, Neville’s skin was clear and smooth, and extremely soft.
—punishingly, endlessly up, and when they were well above the tree line and the sun broke through the fog Harry had to admit defeat, pausing at the dusty side of the trail to slosh water down his throat, letting it run out the sides of his mouth in trickling rivulets down his neck. Draco, scarlet and dripping in sweat, still managed to look smug. But when they finally reached the top and looked out over the ocean stretching before them and the valley behind, Harry bent over and rested his hands on his knees, blew out a breath—said,
happy I made it here before you closed,” he sighed.

“Yes, you and your ridiculous
Draco laughed wetly, and Pansy smiled softly at him. “I jest, but in all seriousness Draco, I don’t want to see him hurt you again. Best leave it alone.”
Draco grinned, rolling his eyes. “Of course not. There’ll be no peace for us until we’re at our own weddings. Even then, they probably won’t leave us alone if we’re not marrying each other.”
Then Wood caught his eye. “
Washing his hands after he had finished up at the urinal, Harry examined his reflection in the smudged mirror. The dim light flickered. What the hell was he doing here? Had he really thought this wouldn’t be awkward? It was excruciatingly awkward. But he couldn’t leave; that would be even worse. He just had to go back out there and sit quietly with Malfoy while they waited and then, what? Stand quietly with Malfoy while the band played? Oh god. At least he’d had the sense to wear a black shirt—he had already started sweating. He took a deep breath and squared his shoulders. There was nothing else for it. He pushed open the door and headed back to the bar.
Potter hummed and grinned again, “Whatever you’ll let me.”
pretty. “Yeah, I mean it,” he paused, cocking his head to the side and meeting Malfoy’s gaze head on. “Do you want to fuck me?”
“Shoulda done the bedside confession of love…" Ron shook his head at Harry, wearing an expression so reminiscent of Molly that Harry had to bury his face in his food, shoving a huge bite of ziti into his mouth to stifle his laughter.
“Oh god, I—” his voice cracked, and he drew himself up, smoothing over the lines of his suit. “Please allow me to apologize, Harry. I should never— I shouldn’t have lost my temper like that, that was absolutely inexcusable, no amount of provocation could— I’m really, I’m so sorry—"
“Oh,” he said softly, “That’s
“Let me just take one more—”
“Ah,” Harry said, tipping his glass back, “I’m just gonna go to the loo—”
“Are you sure?” Draco frowned, “You’re not—” he tilted his hips and Harry hissed out a breath, “Too sensitive? Sore?”
“Alright!” Ron broke in, “I’ll start… Harry, I wish you would shag Draco… Or Draco, you shag Harry? You can both shag each other?”
him— he wouldn’t—
Showered, starched and buttoned into their dress robes, Harry and Draco arrived at the Burrow, emerging from the floo directly into the center of the chaos, a maelstrom of whirling red hair and floating flower garlands. A cacophony of merry voices greeted them, hands clapping them on the back, someone asking would they mind setting up some anti-gnome wards in the back garden? Before he knew it, Harry was standing under the wrought-iron arch in the Weasley’s back garden and sweating profusely. After all his practice that morning his nerves had died down just enough that he was able to get through his work on the wards and stuff down a little lunch. But in the minutes before the ceremony his heartbeat had ratcheted back up and he had started feeling a bit dizzy, physically faint and shaky, stomach clenching. He looked over at Ron on one side and Hermione on the other, hands clasped, eyes shining. Fuck, he was definitely going to cry. He took a deep breath.
Draco was sitting alone at the edge of the bar. He had an expensive scotch in his hands; Harry watched as he brought it slowly up to his mouth and sipped, deliberate and controlled. His back was very straight. Harry sidled up next to him.
and Luna had regarded him steadily for a moment and then drawn him into a hug, and he had buried his face in her fresh-earth-after-the-rain-smelling hair and taken a few shuddery breaths. But what really got the waterworks going for him when he stopped to think about it was that they had asked him to officiate, because they couldn’t agree whose side he would stand on otherwise.
—they hopped on the bike and rode back to Grimmauld to stuff in a quick supper and get changed.
Draco let out a shout of laughter. “No, really, we’re just friends—”
“You ungrateful git! I made you dinner! You were tired!”
“Merlin, I fucking hate speeches,” Potter groaned, flopping over onto his back on the sofa and flinging an arm over his eyes. Draco flicked the cap of his beer bottle at him.
Harry started. Could he do that? Go to a concert with Draco Malfoy? He opened his mouth to reply and found himself saying, “Yeah, yeah I would. Where is it? And what time?”
“I just don’t know what I can do at this point. He doesn’t want me to write to him and I have to respect that. He wants to act like nothing ever happened when I do see him, which I suppose I also have to respect, since this is all my fault anyways…” he trailed off, groaning.
“Oh shove off,” Harry clambered off him, laughing. “Alright then, I’ll be there in, say, thirty minutes? What’s your address?”
share that with Harry, thank Merlin), but everything else that comes with a relationship, all the little minutiae of existence.
Potter frowned, “What do you mean?”
“Gorgeous,” Harry murmured again, sinking his fingers in, “you have no idea how much I’ve thought about this… getting you ready for my cock, fucking you,” Draco’s hips jerked back, and he moaned, “I’m ready, Harry, come on.”
Draco took a long hit, dropping his head back and exhaling toward the ceiling. “Nothing’s too bad when there’s curry chips involved,” he said, reaching his hand out, popping another hot morsel into his mouth and licking his fingers.
Harry crossed his arms. “Well, my cards are on the table,” he snorted, muttering under his breath, “
He handed it to an exasperated Glenlivet, poured himself another scotch—a double—swallowed it down, and crawled into bed. The next morning, he woke up that unfortunate combination of ravenous and nauseous. An owl he didn’t recognize swooped in with his morning post, dropped a scrap of parchment and swooped haughtily back out again. With a sinking feeling, Harry scrambled to unfold it. A single line of neat cursive stared at him:
