"Yeah, maybe, look here comes Blaise," Hermione said, pointing her head down the corridor. Blaise came sauntering towards them alone.
"I love you and always will, but here and now we both have to let go," he said and pulled his sobbing son close to him, not without including Harry in the embrace as well. He too was crying and Narcissa, equally distraught, stroked both boys' hair steadily.
"Yes, the only one I've had so far," Draco nodded and looked at his friend for a while, then leaned over and kissed him. Gently, he pressed the other into the pillows and lay down between his legs.
"Harry!" cried Draco, gasping, and immediately reached for the other's hand. The Gryffindor was unconscious and his eyelids fluttered.
"No, I'm sure he didn't but he was on the verge of a breakdown and that could have ended badly. You fell in love, didn't you, that's what you wanted to say?" Severus then asked.
"Oh, he's not that poor, because he lets me do the homework. But tell me, is Snape really your uncle?"
"Anyway, let's get this over with quickly," Snape said, unpacking the books. His hand itched and he scratched at it as he bristled.
"Ah, mon amis!" he said, beaming, and came towards father and son. Harry swallowed hard. The young Malfoy was handsome. He wore simple linen shorts and a white shirt.
"So how are you?", Severus now wanted to know. Draco looked at Harry, who nodded barely perceptibly.
"No, Blaise has no preferences. Boy or girl, it doesn't matter to him. Listen, that was nothing, we just wanted to teach each other. I don't want anything from him. He's my best friend, that's all."
"Yes, everything has changed since then," Snape said, thinking of the evening when he had first seen Harry with different eyes.
"Yes, I see..." said Remus, swallowing hard. Severus looked at him worriedly and put a hand on the werewolf's cheek.
"Yeah, me neither, but there were reasons for that ...", Draco said now and looked depressed. In short sentences he summarised what had happened, to the point that they could hardly separate without feeling pain. Blaise stared at him in silence for a while, then took a deep breath.
"A soul bond? B-But that's extremely rare and only ... so it doesn't need a potion," Horace stammered.
"Hey, is everything okay? We can stop. Don't worry, I didn't want to sleep with you here and now," Draco said and pulled his hand back, but Harry stopped him.
"But you love him, don't you?" the young woman then asked. Harry looked quickly at Draco and then nodded with a smile.
"Itâ€™s okay," Draco said and held a piece of meat into the crate. One of the Skrewt snatched at him and at the last moment Harry pulled the other's hand away.
"I don't know if I can," Draco said. Severus stood up, stepped next to Draco and gave him a kiss on the forehead, as he had always done when Draco had been little.
"Erm ... yes, then ... then Severus won't have to wait alone in the 'Three Broomsticks'," the werewolf said, visibly embarrassed. Draco and Harry grinned knowingly at each other, hidden under the cloak.
"Ah yes, there you are," Dumbledore said cheerfully, seeming to wink at the two invisible boys as well.
"Hey, I'm sorry and ... and you won't believe this, but I couldn't shock you at first either, not until .... not until I closed my eyes and imagined someone else," he said, letting go of Harry's hand as he heard footsteps. Filch was suddenly standing behind them.
"Oh, and Severus, I would ask you to attend class. I would hate to explain both your absences," Dumbledore said blithely. Now Severus turned pale in Harry's form.
"Let's not do this now," Hermione said, pointing her wand at Draco and casting the counterspell. The Malfoy looked up from his book and folded it shut.
"Good morning, I would need to speak to Messrs Potter and Malfoy in confidence if that is possible."
"Don't look at me when you do that, it's my husband's fault," Severus said, raising his arms defensively.
"Oh, Pansy, I'll do other things with him," Draco said and kissed his husband fleetingly. One might have expected the hall to become noisy, but the opposite was the case. It was so quiet you could have heard a hippogriff feather fall to the floor.
"What do you mean, not really? And yet the girls run after you," Harry said in surprise. Now Draco rubbed the back of his neck.
"Okay boys, all safe. Take the cloak off," he then said and Draco pulled the fabric off their heads.
"Yes, we are afraid of that. Therefore, from now on, you will both live with me. I still have a spare room and you will also have every meal there."
"If anything makes you uncomfortable, you need to say so, all right?" he murmured, reaching blindly beside him and suddenly having a jar in his hand. Harry gulped, but nodded as Draco wet a finger with oil and carefully ran it between his buttocks. Automatically, Harry spread his legs wider to give Draco more room. He gently circled Harry's entrance and at the same time distracted him with a passionate kiss.
"Sure, Dumbledore has briefed all the teachers. Why don't you come in, Severus?" he said, letting him go first.
"Mhm...sure. Apart from the fact that the brat can apparently barely see even with his glasses on, my body aches more than ever. Wonder what Potter does in his spare time," Severus said, stretching his back. Remus looked at him inquiringly.
"Sure, but we'll talk about that when the time comes. Harry, I want you to know that you can always come to me. A suicide attempt, that's not something you just move on from. I want you to check in with Poppy regularly and come to me, whenever, if you don't think it's possible anymore, all right?", Harry looked at the man for a while, then nodded.
"Well, the movement looks great," Remus said, arms folded. Draco and Harry felt very silly standing there and spinning in circles.
"Have a nice day, but stay in the flat. Like Severus, I won't be back until late afternoon. Love Remus," Draco read and grinned.
"Muffliato," he said. The Gryffindor nodded with a smile, reached for his book and began to read again.
"So, talk already, you've seen my body?!" he said without looking up. He felt someone pull up a chair next to him and knew that it was certainly not Snape.
"They are fine, but they are in the hospital wing. You can come to them, but only you and preferably now," Severus said urgently.
"No, not that I know of, it's not actually wanted. Soul bonds are very, very rare and soul mates don't want to break the bond at all."
Around midnight, Severus also returned to the rooms. He was tired and saw that Harry had already made the bed on the couch. It was tempting to just go back to sleep in the clothes, but had to wash. A teenager's body, he had to realise, needed a little more care then. Sighing, he went into the bathroom, much like Harry had done just a few hours before him. He couldn't get the memory thing out of his mind. He had tried it too and had actually seen memories of the boy. Mostly Black was in them and Snape tried to get back to the here and now quickly. Shaking his head, he pulled off his school uniform for the first time and faltered. The boy's torso was covered in scars, some older, others surely barely a few weeks old. His left shoulder still glimmered slightly blue. So that was where the pain came from. One thing the teacher knew, these were not injuries from Quidditch. He took off his trousers and there were deep scars and older injuries on his legs too. He stood in front of the mirror again. The boy was slight, even though muscles could be seen. Gently he ran his hand over a particularly deep scar on his chest as the memories overtook him. He, no Harry was lying on the floor and someone was hitting the maybe eight year old with a belt. The memories changed and showed similar incidents. Beating, hunger, not a kind word. Breathing heavily, Snape struggled back to reality. He propped himself up against the sink and looked up. A tear ran down his cheek, quickly he wiped it away and stood under the cold shower. What he had seen had shaken him to the core and now he also remembered the nightmare from last night. He had seen Sirius offering to stay with him forever and the next moment, Sirius had fallen trough the veil, dead. Shaking his head, Snape grabbed the pyjamas from Harry's trunk and got dressed. Before going into the living room, he swallowed a healing potion to make the pain go away faster. Then he lay down on the couch and stared at the ceiling. He didn't know what to do. He realised that Harry would certainly not talk to him about all this. The boy had been badly abused for years and no one had noticed, not wanted to notice, least of all himself. Sighing, the teacher reached for a Dreamless Potion and turned onto his side.
"So Malfoy was to blame?" wanted to know Ron. The Slytherin turned and glared angrily at the Weasley.
"WHAT? WHAT' DID YOU? I TRUSTED YOU!", Harry now shouted and ran off, ignoring the stabbing pain. Draco was on his feet in an instant and followed him. His chest was burning, every step hurt, but he had to keep up with Harry. The latter ran up the stairs, slumping again and again, but repeatedly managed to get to his feet. He rushed through a door onto the astronomy tower and bent over the parapet, breathing heavily. Cool wind blew through his hair but the pain was almost unbearable, but suddenly it subsided and Harry sighed. He knew that Draco was behind him.
"I'll be back soon. I'm bringing Harry and Draco back here, so ... not that I mind, but maybe you'll put some clothes on," he said with a grin.
"O-One moment, how is the bond sealed?" asked Narcissa, looking to her husband, who swallowed hard and ran his hand through his blond hair.
"I love you too!" he said and was immediately pulled into another kiss and for the first time since Voldemort's death, he felt truly free.
"The Order is here! There were first fights with Death Eaters in Hogsmeade, we were able to beat them back, but we must act now and secure the castle," the werewolf said. Dumbledore nodded.
"We should at least celebrate a little," Severus said, raising his wand and already music was playing and a small buffet appeared.
Severus ran through the corridors of the school, dodging astonished students who had never seen their teacher run like that before. The latter was glad that there was no one to be seen on the seventh floor as he closed his eyes and then tore open the door to the Room of Requirement.
After the lesson, Draco automatically grabbed the Gryffindor's arm and pulled him towards Herbology.
"Hello Grandpa Sev!" the child squeaked, hanging onto his hip. Rolling his eyes, Severus lifted the boy into his arms.
"Merry Christmas to you too, Sev," Draco said with a smile and kissed his father-in-law on the cheek. The one-year-old Lily stretched out her arms and her grandfather did not miss the opportunity to lift the little girl into his arms.
"What's that?" he said loudly. Remus stepped up to him and pulled Severus/Harry's hand towards him. His body suddenly tingled and he quickly withdrew his hand.
"Well Severus, can you say something about it?" the Headmaster wanted to know, addressing the Potions Master.
"Ah, I see Messrs Malfoy and Potter are separated again. Very well then, let us continue with potent potions today. Open your book to page 145 and ...", Horace Slughorn turned to the blackboard and Harry pulled out his book. Yes, they were apart, but strangely it almost hurt more than it had the days before, albeit differently.
"You would have just sacrificed yourself like that?" was the first thing Draco said again after they had both watched the teacher for a while. Harry shrugged and stared at his fingernails.
"Erm ... Hagrid offered me his couch, so I'll have to share it with Fang, but that's okay," Remus said and smiled.
"Oh no? Those are torture marks from a blood feather, something forbidden in the wizarding world for centuries," Severus said sternly. Harry held his gaze and said nothing.
"So that was it, that was the story of how your father and I got together," 32-year-old Harry James Malfoy, took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes. Before he looked back into the two pairs of shiny ones of his children.
"Mhm ... I don't know if you should be so proud of having killed someone," Draco said thoughtfully. Dumbledore looked at him, understanding.
"Yes and it's hard for me to say this as you are both still very young, but I see little possibility as far as separation is concerned. Draco I've been to see your parents, they know and they give you ... ...give you their blessing," Severus explained calmly.
"Don't be offended right away, I meant compared to the one the house elves, sell as such," Severus said and smiled.
"Yes, I thought so too, but I'm afraid I have to get up and pick up the boys," Severus said, reaching for fresh clothes.
"I know it sounds crazy, but it is. The potion, Potter must have done something wrong," he said, trying to remember what the potion had looked like.
"Good, I'll have some food and your things brought to you," Snape said, looking again at Madame Pomfrey, who nodded at him.
"Erm ... visiting you and ... eh ... Order stuff. Severus was kind enough to let me stay the night," he explained and Harry looked at the Potions Master in surprise.
"It's all right my boy, we all make mistakes," the medi-witch said, patting Draco's shoulder encouragingly before turning her attention to other work. Draco sighed and looked at Harry, whose chest was rising and falling evenly.
"I-I have to go to the bathroom and I'd like to change," he said hesitantly. Draco put his things aside and looked at the Gryffindor in irritation.
"Go on," he said and also put on the shirt he was still holding in his hands. Draco now knelt on the bed and took Harry's face in his hands, the skin contact immediately making the stabbing pain disappear again.
"No one can see us here," he said explanatorily, Remus nodded and squeezed the other's hand tighter.
"W-what...what happened?" he asked, briefly touching one of the deep scars on Harry/Severus' torso. Immediately it sent shivers down Severus' spine and he put some distance between himself and the others. He quickly buttoned up the shirt again.
"We are not talking about that now either. We will try everything to solve the connection otherwise, but until then it is important to deal with it responsibly. I have to go to class. You two are doing your schoolwork here today. Tonight, as soon as it's curfew, I'll come and pick you up," Snape said and stood up.
"All right. You know we need to talk about yesterday and I'm not the only one who wants to. I'm just here to take you to Dumbledore."
"What is it?", Draco wanted to know and stroked his cheek gently. Harry leaned against the caressing hand and sighed.
"I will take you to the Room of Requirement. There you will be undisturbed and should ... should anything happen, the room will alert someone," Severus said.
"Being brave doesn't mean you're not afraid, it means you do it anyway. Don't forget that!" said the headmaster, turning away and running back to the school, while Harry and Draco stayed behind near the edge of the forest.
"Yes, I did and I told you that as soon as I turned seventeen I was leaving there," Harry said angrily.
"Ah, Mr Potter and Mr Malfoy. Why don't you sit there on the bed," the medicine witch said with a smile. The young men did as they were told.
He needed fresh air and hurried outside. At that moment, the first students from Hogsmeade returned, Hermione and Ron among them. Severus stopped in front of the two Gryffindors and tried to make his voice sound firm.
"Yeah, but he's got the upper hand and anyway, you didn't usually care," Harry said belligerently. Draco snorted, but said nothing more. Yes, it was true, he hadn't cared until now, but something had changed. Not just since the failed potion, but even before. He felt sorry for Harry somehow and he couldn't exactly say why.
"Molly, I know that the boy belongs to your family, but I can't say anything now, because you would prevent it and ...", at that moment Dumbledore took the floor.
"Have you ... have you this more often?" asked Severus now, his voice unusually soft. Harry shook his head.
"Of course darling. We'll conjure the bed bigger, if that's all right with you?" said Narcissa, wiping the last tears from her eyes. Draco looked at Harry, but he nodded immediately.
"He ... he looked really good and younger and he asked me for something. I ... I'm supposed to tell you that he's happy for you both and that you should be happy, that's what he wants ...", Remus eyes filled with tears.
"Good, then I'll see you in the morning and Sev, stop thinking so much for once in your life," Lucius said still, patting his best friend on the shoulder and climbing back up to the first floor. Severus sighed and pulled his cloak back on.
"So, what's it like?", Ron wanted to know. Severus didn't know what to answer, so he shrugged his shoulders.
"Ah good evening. Please come in," he said and let the Malfoys enter. They nodded stiffly and followed the teacher. Severus raised his wand, locked the room and immediately cast a silencing spell over it.
"You know, in the world of magic there are many black spells that are so hideous, so terrible, that they are hardly mentioned, let alone taught. Horcruxes are objects in which a black magician stores part of his soul outside his body. One who commits murder splits his soul and can keep part of it and enclose the other in an object through a black magic spell. In this way, not his whole soul lives in his own body, but only a part of it. The other part of the soul is safely stored in a Horcrux. When a person is killed who has made a Horcrux of himself, his soul remains earthbound because part of it is preserved in an intact Horcrux body. The remaining torso soul from the now dead own body can implant itself in other people's bodies or create its own capable body again with other people's help...", Harry stared at the teacher and Remus in horror.
"See you in three days, children," Harry called out and in the next moment he and Draco had disappeared.
"I guess after all these years of putting ourselves in danger over and over again, it had to happen. Can't say I would have wished for it," he said. Harry nodded with a smile, stepped towards Ron and gave him a quick hug.
"That is, of course, extremely worrying. Will you and Horace get on?" Albus wanted to know, visibly worried.
"Well, refreshment spell or going to shower together, because I don't think we can take it pain-wise if we each shower alone," the Slytherin said thoughtfully.
"After all, Sirius' fathers were both Seekers. I'm surprised you didn't think of that," Remus tried to defend himself.
"Quite well, but I am to report regularly to Madame Pomfrey or to the headmaster," said Harry, panting briefly.
"Dad, come on. I know becoming an Auror has always been a thorn in your side, but it's really not as dangerous as you think. In the meantime, I sit more in the office anyway and at least I have a healer at home," he said and reached for Draco's hand.
"It's not stupid, it just means you care about others and you always have. Something that sets you apart from your relatives. I'm glad they saved you, that you're here now and ... and that you trust me. You do, don't you?" he wanted to know and reached for Harry's hands. Harry smiled wanly, nodded and bent down to kiss his friend's lips gently.
"Mh...I like them too, that's not it," Harry said. He felt strangely backed into a corner. Yes he liked the Malfoys, last summer he had spent a lot of time at Malfoy Manor. He had made up with Draco, especially after he had practically saved his life. He enjoyed his time with the Slytherin. They had a surprising amount in common and yet a holiday together with him made his stomach ache.
"Come on Malfoy, you too," Neville dragged Draco to his feet and grabbed his upper arm, always making sure they stayed close to the half-giant. In the castle, the students were hurrying to their last lesson and again and again, horrified screams could be heard when they saw Harry in Hagrid's arms. He looked more dead than alive by now. Draco was hardly able to think of anything. All he could feel was Neville's grip on his arm and the burning feeling still behind his chest. As Hagrid entered the infirmary, Madame Pomfrey and Severus Snape, who had brought a student here, turned around.
"Very well. Master and Lady Malfoy are in the drawing room," the house elf said and let Severus enter. He led the Potions Master through the house to the drawing room, where Narcissa and Lucius were sitting in front of the fireplace, reading. They looked up in surprise.
"Mr. Zabini, Mr. ... er ... Weasley, you help me with these two, the rest clean up and then leave," Slughorn instructed. Harry felt Ron's grip under his arm and let himself be pulled along. Ahead of them walked Draco and Blaise.
"No, that's not what I mean. I-I just couldn't shock you, but you ... you didn't seem to have a problem with it," Harry said, visibly embarrassed. Draco stopped and held Harry by the wrist.
"Yes, maybe but I don't blame you and now let's do the chores or we'll never finish by tonight," he then said and reached for a book. Draco looked at him for a long time. Something had changed since yesterday. The burning in his chest was no longer strong, but it was there, small and quiet and yet strange, as soon as he looked at Harry.
Outside the hospital wing, Severus took a deep breath. That was close, far too close. Now a much bigger problem had crossed his mind. Something they all hadn't considered and which could be more than dangerous for Harry and Draco too. He needed to talk to Narcissa and Lucius before he went to the Headmaster. With his cloak billowing, he turned and hurried out of the castle and towards Hogsmeade.
"No, and in the meantime we are of the opinion that there will be no separation. The two have confessed their love to each other in the meantime, which surely does not surprise you headmaster. We have come to the conclusion that the potion did not create a soul bond at all, but somehow activated it. It has always been there and that means, by implication, that the two of them, as it stands now, must bond. The pain is increasing and according to Poppy, a prolonged separation could be fatal, for both of them," Severus concluded. Albus shook his head and stood up. He paced restlessly and was silent for quite some time. The silence was oppressive, but Severus waited.
Harry rubbed his eyes tiredly. The night in Snape's bed was much more restful than the last night on the couch. Still, he couldn't claim to have slept really well. In his dreams, his and Snape's memories intermingled. No, the teacher had had a similarly terrible childhood as himself, with one difference. Snape had a mother who loved him idolatrously and even if she sank into her depression at some point, by then he had at least one person who loved him. Sighing, Harry went into the bathroom and got dressed. Snape had obviously already left, or he would surely have heard him. As he walked into the living room, Harry's gaze fell on his open trunk and the realisation hit him so hard that he momentarily lost his breath. Snape knew, he was sure of it. Of course, he had to know, if Harry saw his memories, Snape saw Harry's. He buried his face in his hands and was looking for a way out when there was a knock at the front door. Harry looked up. What was he supposed to do? Snape must have forgotten to lock the classroom.
"Are you all right?" he wanted to know, turning his head to Harry, who lay pale and also out of breath beside him.
"So really I'm Harry Potter, rule-breaker personified, of course I know the Room of Requirement," Harry said, playfully indignant, grabbing Draco's hand and dragging him behind him.
"Yes, they are confident that we will be separated soon," he said and felt bad. He didn't want to lie to his best friends and he would love to tell him everything, but what actually? That he and Draco might be tied together forever? No, he couldn't, because he didn't understand what that could mean yet.
"Should have guessed the old man couldn't keep that to himself," Severus growled, throwing his bag onto one of the tables and sitting down. Remus took a chair and sat down opposite him.
"Um ... well, we don't really know that either. At the moment Draco shows hardly any symptoms when he is separated, so it could be that he wouldn't die, but ..."
"I don't know, soft and ... and somehow comforting," he then said and looked at Draco, who nodded thoughtfully.
"Try to relax," he whispered and gently pushed in with one finger. Harry gasped, the feeling was strange at first but not really unpleasant, only when Draco added a second finger did it start to hurt a little.
"Cissa, if Draco sees how much you're suffering, it will make it all that much worse," Severus explained.
"Am I crazy or is there something going on between them?" blurted out Blaise when they were alone. Draco and Harry grinned at each other.
"Uncle Sev, everything a-all right?", Draco wanted to know, looking at the man worriedly as Harry straightened up a bit, already reaching for his shirt.
"Um... may I?", Severus looked up startled and raised his eyebrows in surprise. He hadn't expected the man who stood in front of him and shyly asked for a seat.
"Well you-know-who is one thing above all, arrogant and obsessed with power. He didn't lock his soul parts into something arbitrary. Each item was special in its own way, something unique," Harry looked up in surprise.
"You could, the question is, do you want to?" said Sirius gently. Harry turned his gaze back to his godfather.
"No, I'm fine," Harry said, reaching for his quill again. Snape was teaching Defence that year and still made no secret of his dislike for Harry. Only one thing had changed, Harry no longer got involved in any confrontation with the teacher. Since he was an excellent student in Defence, Snape had little room for attack.
"I don't know, and where are Harry and Dray?" Blaise murmured. But that was as far as they got, for the room left them speechless. It was almost as if they were standing in a sun-drenched forest. The ground was covered with grass and flowers. Small birch trees stood at the edges of the room and in the middle was an arch decorated with forget-me-nots and other flowers. White wooden chairs stood in front of it and butterflies flew through the air, while the ceiling was adorned with drifting clouds.
"It's the least I could do," Albus said, looking over at the two young men laughing boisterously with their friends.
"No matter what Draco, you must control yourself more!" said Snape sternly. Draco just nodded and involuntarily stroked the back of Harry's hand with his thumb.
"Not so sensitive Lupin, all right, yes I am worried, but how to explain it I don't know, because it affects you as much as me," Severus said sighing.
"I don't know. I always kind of liked you, even when we were at school, but it's only since Sirius died that I see you with these eyes. Before that, I had forbidden myself ... somehow and what about you?", Severus sighed and Gin moved on again. Remus stopped for a moment in surprise, then hurried after him until he was beside him.
"Good, let's continue with unsaid spells today. You can disarm the other in the meantime, we will practise shocking today. You will work in teams and only in the designated areas, otherwise there will be injuries. We'll keep the teams from last week, that means Malfoy and Potter will form one too and don't look like that, I'm not negotiating that!" said Snape, looking at Harry disparagingly. But the latter thought he detected a tiny smile. With a tingling stomach, he walked over to Draco, who was doing a good job of looking at him in disgust.
"Uncle Sev, quickly," Draco called, kneeling on the blanket next to a groaning Harry. Immediately he was with them and saw that the young man must be in pain. He called up a potion and put it to Harry's lips, who drank gratefully.
"Nothing, but if someone had told you a week ago that you would be lying in bed next to me one day and well .... would you have believed him?"
"Are you all right?" the werewolf wanted to know. The Potions Master nodded and with a motion of his head signified for Remus to follow him. They walked in silence until they had left the village behind them.
"Well, that won't be necessary. You will share your rooms. I will find an explanation," Dumbledore said in a tone that brooked no argument.
"But Uncle ... er ... Professor, how are we going to explain this?" asked Draco, looking anxiously at Harry, who was visibly pale by now.
"Don't look like that, I'm sure it won't be so bad and then we could .... well, maybe we could go to the Room of Requirement," Draco said, grinned and knocked on the door. Severus Snape opened it.
"Ah yes, Harry and Draco are coming, please sit down," Dumbledore said and pointed to the two chairs in front of his desk. Hesitantly, the two sat down and moved the chairs a little closer together.
"We're going now. Enjoy your time together and ...", that was all he could say. Narcissa stepped up to the boys again and gave them each a kiss on the forehead.
"Well, I think we'll go and get Narcissa and Lucius. They've hardly slept the last few nights, let's see if they're awake yet," he said and looked at Remus, who nodded in agreement.
"And help Ron and Hermione and Severus too. We'll be fine, I'm sure," Remus swallowed hard, nodded and gave Harry a kiss on the forehead.
"Hey, don't do that. They're just scars and they don't define who you are, okay?", Draco had stepped up to him and smiled.
"The boy is as good as blind, despite his glasses. No wonder he can't see anything at the blackboard. Possibly...", Severus thought aloud.
"Oh Lupin, find a hobby, or a wife! Anything at all. Your work at the Ministry doesn't fill you up, does it?" Severus looked questioningly at his friend. He and Remus had a bond, especially Harry. Lupin, like the boy, had needed comfort and support after Sirius had died. So in the meantime he spent a lot of time in Spinner's End when there were holidays. Now Remus made a throwing gesture with his hand.
"Yes, it is little consolation, but at least you have briefly experienced what true love means. It's been far too long for me," Dumbledore said, his eyes saddened.
"There are only two options. One is that Poppy pumps you full of pain potions and we keep looking for a way to separate you or ..."
"No..." came from Remus smugly, as he pulled Severus' shirt over his head and kissed his chest. The latter pushed him away a little.
"Dragon crap!" cursed Harry as he tried to tie the bow tie of his ceremonial cloak. His fingers were trembling. While he was getting ready in Severus' guest room. The latter was changing at Severus's. It was tacky, but they didn't want to see the other until just before. There was a knock and Remus came into the room.
"We don't know, but supposedly he's on his way here. You-know-who has nothing left to lose," Draco said.
In the corridor, they could no longer hold hands. They walked side by side in silence while Severus led the way. The stares of the other students followed them and Harry wished for nothing more than to simply have his cloak of invisibility with him. Besides, there was something else, because even though he was walking next to Draco and they weren't separated by 30 centimetres, his chest was burning and Draco seemed to be having trouble as well. He kept rubbing his stomach and chest.
"Yes, I told them everything. They wanted to be there too, but I didn't think it was a good idea. They're coming to Hogsmeade tomorrow and they want to see you both," Severus explained.
"So these are the last days you can spend a few hours before the stress starts again," he said and Harry looked at him in amazement. Severus was pretty good at reading between the lines.
"The last few weeks and months have not exactly been easy," he said, fighting down the tears that were welling up.
"I think that only Mr. Potter would die if Mr. Malfoy died. Not the other way around, though. Judging from the symptoms, Potter got the worst of it," Snape said coolly.
"Dray, we ... we can't really get married anyway, how can we? Being engaged to you is enough for me," Harry said.
"Listen Draco, we love you both and we couldn't ask for a better son-in-law than Harry, but we have to go. When I first held you, I was afraid, afraid of failing as a father, afraid of becoming the kind of father mine was, afraid of losing you ... losing you someday. But you know what? I am proud, proud of what you have become. You've managed to make your own way, and you've made the right choices. Letting you go tears me apart, but I know what and who you are doing it for, who you are both doing it for. You are doing it so others can be safe and live and as a father I couldn't be prouder," Lucius had tears running down his face. He placed a hand on Draco's cheek and smiled.
"You got it mum! Come on Harry, let's go..." said Draco, reaching for his bag of swimwear. Harry stood up and accepted sandwiches and apples from Narcissa.
Severus Snape was just entering the Entrance Hall when he spotted Hermione, Ron and Blaise from a distance in front of the Great Hall. It couldn't have gone any better. He looked around quickly, then drew his wand and muttered two quick spells that knocked first Ron and then Blaise off their feet.
"Of course I do! I promised Lily I'd look after him and even though it's been hard for me to treat him normally all these years, I care about him and always have and since I know how he must have suffered with his relatives, even more and you're telling me now that it was all for nothing, that we just raised him like a pig for slaughter?"
"Yeah, I guess, but it wouldn't have been uncomplicated before either. How ... so how long have you been?" asked Draco uncertainly.
"I know, still," Remus said sadly as the door opened and Severus came into the room. Irritated, he looked around. They had pushed the furniture aside for practice, a fact Remus remedied with the wave of his wand.
"Yes, it's hardly been a few months ...", Narcissa said, brushing a blonde strand out of her son's forehead.
"No, certainly not. What about their friends. Ron and Hermione are very close to Harry and Blaise Zabini is probably close to Draco," Severus sighed and shook his head.
"Yes, what is it? I have to get something quickly," said Severus, grabbing the bag and hurrying out of the Great Hall.
"Always," Harry said wanly and Draco wanted to take him in his arms immediately, but he could do nothing but sit there and try to give Harry strength through his closeness.
"This is your room. The bathroom is across the hall and we share it, so I hope you two don't take forever in the morning. Here in these rooms you have permission to call me by my first name, so I will do the same. As soon as we are in class or in the corridors, this does not apply, understand?"
"Everything is back to normal, just a little overstimulated nerves and just the slight burns," she said. Draco looked at Blaise with a shrug and wanted to go back to his bed, but no sooner had he moved away from Harry than the pain started again. Harry cried out and it was Blaise who immediately understood what was happening. He grabbed the completely frozen Draco by the shoulder and pushed him back to Harry's bed. Again, the pain subsided instantly and Harry lay in bed, breathing heavily.
"Harry," he said, and almost had to grin when he saw how the latter reacted to the mention of his first name.
"Just stay close to us and not another peep. You just follow me when we get to the 'three broomsticks', understand?" whispered Severus. He heard a collective clearing of his throat in confirmation. Once more Severus looked to Remus, who nodded promptly, then they walked in a direct path to the lit inn. Remus opened the door and held it open for Severus, who walked through with the hidden boys.
"It looked worse yesterday, but I took a healing potion," he said, putting the rest of his clothes back on as well.
"Poppy! It's Severus. I'm stuck in...apparently I'm stuck in Potter's body," he said, staring at the Gryffindor jumper he was wearing. The Healer looked at him doubtfully.
"You know what's stupid? I wasn't scared when I started, but when I blacked out, I ... I thought of Ron and Hermione and suddenly found myself selfish," Draco stood up and pulled his chair in front of Harry.
"Firstly, please tell Severus and secondly, I know that. I see it and yet even if you didn't want to hurt Draco, you would have jumped if the bond hadn't been there, if Draco hadn't been there, wouldn't you?", Harry looked at Draco squeezing the latter's hand tighter, then looked back at Severus and nodded.
"I don't know. I'll talk to Dumbledore and then we'll have to separate them from the Slytherins first of all. I think ... well, I'll take them both to my place. I have one free room. Draco and he need to pull themselves together and stay together at all times. No one must know how serious it really is and that it could kill Potter," Severus said and sighed.
"I don't know, because ... I don't know, it feels like cheating when...", Remus sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose.
"But how will it go on then? I have no new information, but I think the lord will come here. He no longer trusts me completely, but I have heard rumours," Lucius said.
"P-please Dray ... please go on, don't stop," Harry begged between kisses. Draco withdrew his fingers and looked at him.
"Sirius ... Sirius, he's always been there for me since we were eleven. He never really had it easy either. He hated his family's constraints and their views. When he and James found out what was wrong with me, they didn't show any fear or loathing, they wanted to do everything to help me, to stand by me. We discovered our feelings for each other when we were about fifteen. I think they were always there, but ... but we were both too shy. In the end, it was Sirius who just kissed me, just like that, in the library. From then on we were a couple, but we kept it a secret, only James and Lily knew. After school we stayed together, we even lived together more or less. But Sirius kept putting himself in danger and we fought a lot. Harry's birth somehow reconciled us. We wanted to be there for him, for James and Lily, but then ... I knew Sirius had never betrayed the three of them in his life, he would have died first. When he escaped from Azkaban, I suspected that he only wanted one thing, to protect Harry, but unfortunately I realised too late why he was in danger. When I saw him again, it all came crashing down on me. I thought I had lost him forever and then there he was. It took us a while, but then it was like it used to be," Remus faltered and absently turned his glass in his hand. Severus said nothing. He guessed that the other wasn't finished yet.
"Yes, but it takes some time. I'm afraid you'll both have to stay here for a while," Madame Pomfrey said sympathetically.
"Hey Malfoy, so ... so I think you're really okay," he then said to Draco and held out his hand. The young man reached for it and smiled.
"Darling, I'm back," Lucius said, entering the drawing room and handing his coat to one of the house elves. Narcissa looked up and put the book she had been reading on the page.
"Bullshit, by Salazar ... Yes, we've never been good friends, more like enemies, but I ... I don't want you dead. What I did today was stupid and reckless. I was only thinking of myself and I'm sorry, Harry ... I really am," Draco turned his head to the other. Harry turned to him and squeezed the hand that held his tighter for a moment.
"What in Salazar's name is this Draco? I thought you were separated again? Why are you holding hands with him?". Pansy put her hands on her hips and looked at Harry in disgust.
"If the ... the Horcrux is destroyed, how .... or who is to kill Voldemort?" asked Harry hesitantly.
"O-Okay, so I'll see you later," Blaise said uncertainly and looked at his best friend. The latter only nodded weakly.
"Okay stop, we haven't got that far yet. I know it wouldn't be in your best interest if your son had to commit himself to Potter..."
"Luc, please. Firstly, I don't know yet and secondly, none of your business. I should go," Severus then said and rose. Lucius nodded and stood up too.
"Firstly, yes you could do the spell, secondly, I don't care who started it, you're not eleven anymore and you don't just attack anyone, but that's not why you two are here today," he said seriously.
"You should be getting ready. Classes will start any moment and if I'm informed correctly, you have to go to herbology," he said and reached for some books.
"You need not be afraid, nothing will happen to you. You will be taken to the dungeons and from there to secret passages. Those of you who are of age are free to stay here and fight."
"Oh nonsense. You always have a choice. They are only sixteen, still half children. Even the wedding won't change that. Hasn't the boy suffered enough already?"
"All right then, come on Potter, and I certainly won't be sitting at the Gryffindor table," Draco said and trudged ahead, making sure that Harry followed him. Harry looked once more at the teachers before joining Draco.
"Excuse me?" the indignation in Snape's voice was almost palpable. Harry looked up with tears in his eyes and Severus froze, he never thought it would hit him like this to see himself crying.
"Yes, turn over," he said, and Harry stared at the door, unmoving, while the other got ready for bed.
"Dad, I'm of age, I can do it myself..." he didn't get any further. Lucius had already disappeared with him.
"Deny it and play it down. It's not fatal and they are as good as separated, but if everything goes wrong then ..."
"Don't cry. You are the smartest and best friend I could ask for and you have to stay strong. Ron, he needs you. You need each other, okay? Promise me you'll show all those purebloods what you are made of!" he said and softly and felt a nod on his shoulder. Then she broke away from him and hugged Draco too. Ron walked up to Harry and scratched his head in embarrassment. You could see how hard he was fighting back the tears that were welling up.
"I would like to know that from you, Harry. Mr Malfoy and Mr Zabini found you and Professor Snape in the potions classroom. They were unconscious, apparently a potion exploded,"
"Poppy, what's wrong?", Severus wanted to know, clearly seeing the concerned look on the medi-witch's face.
"My dad and him, they didn't have a very good relationship when they were at school. My father and Sirius really gave him a hard time."
"Good, it's safe now. Why don't you sit down?" he said, pointing to two of the classroom chairs while he himself remained standing.
"Sure, but ... but the boys, they told us their last wish," Narcissa said, trying to bring her trembling voice back under control.
"I don't know, but I think you, so we need to see Dumbledore. He's not going to ignore a ... a suicide attempt like that, I don't think he's going to ignore it."
"Okay, so I'll see you ... Well, at dinner," Harry said sheepishly after the lesson, while Draco stood by, visibly annoyed.
"Sucks...literally," Harry interrupted his father with a grin. He nodded and reached for his son's hand.
"Yes," was all he said. Harry sighed and, without letting go of his hand, let himself sink back onto his back. Draco turned out the light and lay back down as well.
"So, today we're going to the forest to see what our bowtruckle are doing," he said and led the way.
"My parents, or rather my father, he ... he spies for the Ministry. There is the Order and there is the Ministry. They all want the same thing, albeit by different means. My father does it for me and my mother, to keep us safe. He hates it, but he can't just back out," the Slytherin said and Harry saw that he was fighting tears. Without thinking about it, Harry reached for the other's hand.
"No ... but I don't want it to be over so soon," came breathlessly from Harry. Draco nodded and came back up, lowering his lips to the other's and stroking gently down his sides to his bottom.
"Go on Potter, not that you're late," Blaise said with a smile and stepped to the side. It wasn't a sneer and a snide smile, it was genuinely honest. Irritated, Harry nodded and continued walking, after a few moments he turned again and Draco's and his eyes met. It was only a tiny moment, but it triggered something in him. Without realising it, he was suddenly standing in front of the classroom. Sighing, he knocked and entered. His courage sank when he saw that a cauldron had been set up, complete with ingredients.
"Come to bed, your chattering teeth are unbearable," Draco murmured. Harry thought about it for a moment, but he was really cold and he would never find sleep like that. He got up, grabbed the blanket and pillow and lay down next to Draco. He just managed to suppress a sigh. The warmth emanating from the Slytherin was indescribable.
"Can we?" asked the potions master and the Malfoys nodded. It was not until they were in Lucius' study that they spoke again.
"Nice, but if you want, you're welcome to sleep here. The boys, they'll ... well they'll probably go back to their houses if everything worked out and if not, they go to the hospital wing, so I have a room available," Severus said, looking almost a little embarrassed. Remus looked at him irritated.
"As soon as possible. Maybe tomorrow evening. It's the weekend and ... and they'll at least want their friends there."
"I don't think so. I did some research today and ... and I'm afraid there's no way to break the soul bond," Lucius said wanly.
"Why I don't fight back? Draco, this is my home! Hogwarts is the only home I know and if I defend myself then I can't go back. You know I'm not allowed to do magic and certainly not in front of Muggles."
"We've known each other for so long. I had Draco in my arms when he was barely a few hours old, so this conversation is the hardest thing I've ever had to do," he began and the Malfoys looked at each other worriedly. Severus sighed, took a deep breath and began to narrate.
"Very nice Harry, you can stroke her. She likes you," said Hagrid. Harry reached out and ran his hand through the animal's soft fur. Draco was completely fascinated. Not only by the animal, but by the effect it had on Harry. The Gryffindor's eyes lit up and he seemed completely relaxed. Now the unicorn briefly rubbed its head against Draco's cheek as well before turning and disappearing back into the forest with the foal. The Slytherin froze, this brief touch seemed almost a silent invitation, but for what?
Remus lay next to Severus in his bed and stared into the darkness. He suspected that the man next to him was also unable to sleep. Blindly, he reached for the other's hand and felt the light pressure it exerted on his.
"Sev ... he's... he's our only child and Harry ... please," Narcissa shivered and Severus knelt down in front of the woman.
"Mr. Malfoy do you feel pain when you move away from Mr. Potter?" the medi-witch now wanted to know.
"At that time I thought I would never see you again and it tore me apart. At that moment there at the edge of the forest, I just couldn't bear never to see you again," he said and came closer. Draco was now so close that the tips of their noses were almost touching.
"Here, this is a dreamless potion. It should help for tonight at least," he said and handed Harry the vial, inside of which a purple potion could be seen. Hesitantly, the Gryffindor reached for it.
"Is that so? Okay, well we were never the best of friends, but I ... I've kind of grown to like you," Draco said and grinned, albeit sheepishly. Harry didn't really know what to say. He had liked Draco for a while, more than he should have, but telling him was something else.
"Fine, but anyway, let's go to Lucius' study," Severus said and left the drawing room. Confused, Narcissa and Lucius followed him. The Malfoy's study was covered with powerful protective spells, for as a spy for the Ministry, the man trusted no one since Voldemort's return.
"Yes, there is. Me or you or us, I don't know, we'll grab the boys and go away, far away, to America for all I care, let you-know-who find us there," Remus said, clenching his fists. Severus almost had to smile. The werewolf would actually run away with him and the two boys? But then he came to his senses, stood up, sat down next to Remus and put a hand on his shoulder. A simple gesture that took the other completely by surprise and silenced him.
"Harry, don't worry. Of course you won't have to go back and you will always find a home here. I'm very sorry I didn't know about this sooner. We would have found a solution. There's still a while to go, but of course you can stay here next summer until you turn seventeen and then.... well you own a house, don't you?"
"Well, I guess that's what I'm here for. But you would have done the same, I know that!" Draco said, thinking back to the Battle of Hogwarts, which was only a few weeks ago.
"I have never come across such a potion. The fact is, it is a kind of empathic potion, but it seems to have bonded the souls of Messrs Malfoy and Potter, however that happened. Similar to a soul bond," he said, seeming deeply concerned.
"Harry, who says I want this? I know we've only been together for a few days, but I already know that I can't or won't live without you. I love you and I'd rather die next to you than without you," Draco said, leaning forward and kissing Harry demanding. Tears ran down Harry's cheek again, tasting salty on both their lips.
"What happened?" Narcissa wanted to know immediately, seeing how worried Severus looked. In short sentences, the teacher summarised the last few days, up to Harry's suicide attempt and the fact that Harry and Draco were now a couple. The Malfoys exchanged worried glances.
"That's it, relax. I'm here," Draco whispered and Harry leaned his head on Draco's shoulder. Tears ran down his cheeks and mixed with the warm water. For the first time in weeks, he felt truly safe and secure, and even though their situation was anything but easy. When they eventually came out of the bathroom dressed together, Severus Snape was already sitting on a chair waiting for them.
"Mhm ...", Harry made. As they ran down the stairs, Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy came towards them. Briefly, their eyes lingered on Harry. He swallowed hard, but for a brief moment, the Malfoys dropped their arrogant and cool masks and smiled at him. It was only a moment, but it meant a lot to Harry.
"I can't tell you that. The best thing is to go home and join him when he comes here, but don't interfere, because that would also mean your death. We could also hide you here..."
"I know you feel bad, and I understand, but what do you think Sirius would want for you?" the teacher asked, his voice trembling, something that usually never happened. Remus looked the man in the eye, even though it was difficult to do so in the pale light. Almost in slow motion, he reached out and placed his hand behind Severus' neck, only to pull him towards him and connect their lips. Briefly they disengaged, but it was Severus who immediately took the initiative again and went in for another kiss. It took a while, but eventually they had to separate again to catch their breath. Remus smiled and shook his head.
"You really like it? It was the first thing that came to mind," Draco said sheepishly. Harry nodded and kissed Draco briefly.
"It's all right, you may," he murmured, guiding his hand to his erection. Harry swallowed hard, but it felt good, even more so when Draco gave a short groan. Harry smiled and continued stroking the other until Draco pulled away from him.
"Harry, normally even the darkest wizards make at most a single Horcrux of themselves. Tom Riddle must have been obsessed with the number seven. He developed the idea of dividing his soul into seven parts. Six parts were supposed to live outside his body. That's definitely Dumbledore's assumption."
"Incredible," the three students wheeled around and in front of them stood Harry and Draco, looking at the room with equal fascination.
"Talk, that's all. Harry tried to kill himself and that's not something you can just dismiss," Severus said, looking back at the Gryffindor.
He didn't have to look long for Blaise Zabini. The young man was already standing outside his office and seemed to have been waiting for the teacher.
"All right, I'll tell them. But I won't let them do it here," he said energetically and walked past the woman into Draco and Harry's hospital room. The two were not wearing shirts. Harry leaned back against Draco's bare chest and read from a book. When the Potions Master entered, they startled.
"Anyway, we have to go to Defence if we don't want detention," Blaise insisted and stood up. Now many students were striving towards class and it was getting crowded in the corridors. Harry was gripped by naked fear and he tried not to lose Draco. It was Blaise who noticed that Harry was panicking. He drew Draco's attention, who rolled his eyes in annoyance. He stopped and grabbed Harry by the upper arm.
"Can we explode something?" the four-year-old asked, grinning. Severus rolled his eyes, handed Lily to Remus and took Sirius by the hand.
"Sure! Have you never been to the sea?" Draco looked questioningly at the other. He shook his head sadly. His father put an arm around his shoulder.
"See you boys and take care of yourselves," said the Malfoy, hoping that Voldemort would not call for him that night of all nights.
"No, Cho that was just ... I liked her, but not the way you're supposed to like a girl when you're straight. I didn't know what I really wanted and I thought maybe the kiss would clear things up."
"My Lord, are you all right?", Bellatrix Lestrange helped Voldemort to stand up. The dark lord had collapsed shortly after his curse.
"Of course it's in your head, but that doesn't mean it isn't true," the man called back, turned with the children and was gone in a moment. Harry looked out to sea and suddenly knew how to get back to Draco. He went closer and immediately the water washed over his feet. Very slowly he went further and further into the water and dived down.
"Turn around!" he said and Harry, who was far too tired to give a big account, turned towards the door. At some point he heard the shower and then Malfoy brushing his teeth.
"All right, then, follow me," the teacher said and turned away. Draco nodded to Harry and they followed the man. They didn't speak a word, in fact they had hardly spoken all day. Everyone seemed to be preoccupied with their thoughts. Harry hardly noticed how at some point they stood in the dungeons and stepped through a door behind Snape. He didn't know himself what he had in mind, but the flat was really cosy, of course the Slytherin green predominated here, but otherwise Harry would have expected something colder. They stood in the living room, which had a seating area in front of the fireplace and an open kitchen with a table and chairs. Snape walked through the flat and opened a door.
"If we don't touch, then ... then we always have this burning in our chest and body now," he explained. Severus stood up and looked at the two boys seriously.
"W-What does that mean for us now?", Draco wanted to know after Severus had finished his narration. Harry sat rigidly next to the Slytherin and stared into space.
Harry still had the feeling of being under water. He tried to surface, but something kept pulling him into the depths. Desperately he fought against it, having only one thought - Draco. Above him he saw the sun breaking golden in the water and yet he couldn't manage to break the surface. Was all lost in the end? Then he heard a voice, Draco's voice, calling him. Over and over again, and it was like a rope he was holding on to in order to surface. He opened his eyes with difficulty. His vision was blurred and it was dark in the room where he lay. Only a small lamp provided some light. He lay in a bed and felt a hand holding his and a head resting on his chest. It was Draco's head, he recognised that even without his glasses. Carefully he pulled his hand out of his husband's and placed it on his head. Immediately Draco startled and stared at Harry, stunned.
"It's still very early, let's go to Severus before the others all get up," Draco said and reluctantly detached himself from the Gryffindor. He nodded and gathered his things as well.
"You do not move from the spot and you do not leave this flat. You will get food from the house elves. I'll be back here right after class! More comfortable clothes are in the wardrobe in the bedroom, but don't you dare snoop around," he said sternly and reached for the bag that belonged to Harry.
"You have nothing to be sorry for," the man said and briefly put a hand on his cheek. Harry nodded with a smile and then sat down with Draco on the large bed.
"You hate me anyway! It makes no difference to you whether I'm alive or not. It doesn't matter to you, so you don't have to pretend now out of a sense of duty..." said Harry in a quivering voice, lowering his gaze again. Remus said nothing, he knew that Harry had hit a spot in Severus, one that he probably didn't know about until now. He stared at Harry as if paralysed.
"Severus ... h-he let you fall asleep and calmed you down and then brought you here," Draco said, visibly embarrassed. Harry nodded again and now moved a little away from Draco.
"How is it supposed to go on? Just send them to their deaths, that ... I can't do that," he said and sank into one of the armchairs. Remus nodded.
"Yes, they can get aggressive if you get too close to the tree to get wood for wands. See the long fingers?", Draco nodded fondly.
"See you soon," he said a little louder and then left the dining room, ignoring Lucius at the stairs. He waited a moment, then walked towards the teacher's table.
"You'll see," he said and led Remus along the lake to the large birch trees that stood not far from the Forbidden Forest. Between them was a dead trunk that almost looked like a bench. Severus sat down and tapped the wood beside him. Remus took a seat and immediately Severus reached for Remus' hand.
"Yeah, sure," Harry said and changed things with a wave of his wand. Draco did the same and then sat down on the bed. They were only a tiny moment a little over two metres apart, but Harry immediately gasped. Draco, who now felt the burning very clearly, reacted immediately and quickly pulled him towards him by the arm. So quickly that Harry lost his balance and landed on top of the other. With a red head, he straightened up and sat down next to Draco.
"Dray, a gentleman never tells," Blaise said, raising his wand and casting the counterspell on Harry.
"Harry? Harry, open your eyes," Ron's voice trembled. With difficulty Harry opened his eyes. Ron, Hermione and Slughorn were kneeling in front of him. The Gryffindor looked beside him. Draco was conscious and sitting pale against the wall.
"Not much. I haven't come across anything like that yet. Horace just collected the remains of the potion and then we'll analyse it, but for the time being I suggest that Messrs Malfoy and Potter did not stay away from each other, we don't want anything to happen to our golden boy," he said smugly. Draco swallowed, he knew that his godfather more or less hated Potter, but this was really unnecessary. But Harry remained silent and stared at his fingernails.
"Peace children, everyone is right. Daddy is a hero and so is Pa," Draco Malfoy came into the living room and gave his husband a kiss on the cheek.
Severus turned wearily on his side and had to smile. The man next to him was still asleep and the Potions Master felt he had rarely seen anything more beautiful than Remus with tangled hair and asleep. He still wondered how it had all suddenly happened so quickly.
Sixteen years had passed and they loved each other just as much as they did then and knew that they owed it all to one simple thing, and so above the fireplace in their house in London hung a picture frame and in it a dried bouquet of hellebore.
"BUT I COULD! IF I HAD BEEN BETTER, IF I HAD MASTERED OCCLUMENCY, THEN HE COULD STILL BE ALIVE!", Harry shouted out all his pain of the last months. Then, without thinking about it, he turned and climbed the narrow wall that separated him and the deep.
"Not really, well not like that by any means, not like I'm happy. Until a few months ago, I thought I would marry some woman to keep our family's reputation," he said.
"Have you had that burning again?", Madame Pomfrey wanted to know and the Slytherin nodded silently.
"No, I don't think so. I'm here to ... to ask your permission, so to speak," Severus said sheepishly.
"N-no ... no that can't be. No, I won't let that happen," he stammered, tears coming to his eyes. Severus said nothing, guessing that after Sirius' death, Harry was the only thing, or the only person, that still somehow connected Remus to James and Lily. When it came down to it, the boy was the only piece of family he had left. Severus knew that the man had pleaded with Dumbledore to let him take Harry in, after last summer. The two had got on well from the start and now Severus also knew that Harry had needed more than just a fatherly friend, but much more a father.
"And this war will end and then I can go home, I firmly believe that," Draco said and kissed Harry again.
"Very well, we'll take you and Mr Malfoy to the hospital wing. You have some minor burns. Luckily the explosion only hit you both full on," Slughorn said, helping Harry to stand up. The latter stood shakily. He had a headache and his face was burning slightly. Draco was now getting to his feet too. He seemed to have taken less of a beating, but he also looked pretty battered.
"Yes, they were very exhausted," Narcissa said and rose to get ready for bed as well. Lucius, too, conjured up a pair of pyjamas and lay down on Harry's side, while Narcissa lay next to Draco.
"Ah yes, that's right, he mentioned something like that. Go ahead then. The two are back there in a separate room," the healer said, pointing behind her.
"NO!!!", Narcissa's scream lingered through the empty classroom and would surely have been heard all the way to the Great Hall if the spell had not prevented it. The woman screamed, crying, and Lucius held her, crying with her. Severus stood helplessly by and he too was fighting tears.
"Okay, Severus we were never friends, but I'm asking you to talk because you're really scaring me, I've never seen you like this," Remus pleaded. The other looked up but avoided the werewolf's gaze.
"They are bowtruckle. They only live in wandwoods and are very shy. This family has lived here for a long time and they trust Hagrid, otherwise we wouldn't see them. They sort of guard the tree," Harry explained quietly.
"If this war is ever to end, he must, and Voldemort himself must do it. It's not easy for me, even though you may think it is, but one life against hundreds of others, yes I'll take that!"
"Why don't you find a seat, I'll go somewhere quickly," the teacher said a little louder and Remus nodded. The parlour was well filled that evening. Severus quickly crossed the room and turned right to the toilets. Draco and Harry had to be careful not to bump into anyone by accident and just managed to avoid the waitress. Severus ran past the toilets and to the stairs leading upstairs.
"Well, instructions suits him," he said and handed Harry two vials. He took them and swallowed the medicine before they sat down and began to eat.
"That's true, but since Potter has no one else, it would also mean that he would become a part of this family, no matter how things turn out, and in terms of the Lord ..."
"Dray, please let me do this. My name has never brought me much luck and I love you, so please let me do this," Harry said. The other kissed him briefly and then nodded.
"We're getting married tomorrow night. Dumbledore is going to marry us and you have to be there somehow, please!" pleaded Draco, close to tears. The Malfoys looked at each other.
"So Weasley and Zabini please and lastly Malfoy and Potter," Harry startled when he heard his name called and then with Malfoy too. With Draco, of all people. The boy he was supposed to hate but had long since stopped caring about as much as he should.
"How far away were you?" she wanted to know urgently. Draco shook his head in confusion, as if he was only now aware of where they were.
"Don't worry about it. I am happy for you, so and now we have to go," the teacher said, stood up and went to the door.
"Ah Professor, good to see you. Come in," Lucius Malfoy said and let him enter. He closed the door a little later than one would. Severus put a finger to his lips, raised his wand and cast a few spells. Then he smiled at Narcissa.
"Don't worry Harry, I will take over Severus' lessons and we will tell the students that Professor Snape is ill and needs to recuperate. So I would ask you to spend this week in Professor Snape's rooms," Dumbledore said seriously.
"Remus, I love you and you belong to me and they are my best friends, so yes - we," the werewolf smiled and leaned over his friend. Gently he kissed him, first his lips and then down his neck. Severus clawed at Remus' hair and moaned.
"NO!" cried Molly desperately and Arthur held her tight. The scream went through Harry's spine, he was so full of despair and loss that he could not put it into words.
"After the holidays. Then Lily will have a place in the kindergarten at the ministry and I can go back to work. The year with her at home went by pretty quickly," he said and squeezed Harry's hand tighter. Severus watched the two of them closely.
"In you go," said the teacher. Draco pushed Harry into the room and sat down at a table at the very back. By necessity, Harry had to sit next to him, far away from Hermione and Ron. Many of the eyes in the room were now on them. The others were watching them as if waiting for one of them to explode.
"Well, they are very empathic creatures, they sense fear, sadness and despair and they want to help. Comfort and stuff...", he explained, clearing his throat sheepishly. Everyone looked at Harry, who would have liked to disappear.
" Tell ... tell me about the blow job, can you?" he asked, suppressing a groan as Draco sucked hard on the sensitive skin above his ribs. Draco looked up and grinned.
"Why not? Come on, let's start the list. We should use the time wisely," Draco said and fetched parchment and quill.
"I ... we promise," she said and looked at Lucius, who also nodded with red eyes. Then she knelt down as well and pulled the boys into her arms, cried with them and swore not to break her promise.
"What else have I missed, apart from your victory over the Dark Lord?", Harry now wanted to know with a grin.
"Yes, but one Harry destroyed ..." he said and the Gryffindor looked up in confusion, but then he understood.
"Okay Hermione, I promise I'll apologise to Peeves, but let's go now," Blaise said and they hurried upstairs.
"I know, I feel the same way. Sometimes I wake up at night and I'm afraid you might be gone, but then I feel your arm around me, Lily's hair tickling my face and I know all is well," he said. Harry nodded and pulled Draco close to him again.
"Far too long," Severus said simply. Remus looked at him from the side and, without thinking about it, reached for his hand. The teacher looked down in irritation for a moment, but then he enjoyed the warmth and familiarity of the gesture.
Severus disapparated as soon as he reached the village. As he stood in front of Malfoy Manor, the sun was just setting. He straightened his shoulders and hoped fervently that Narcissa and Lucius were alone. He knocked on the heavy oak door and a house elf opened it.
"Um ... sit down, please," he said, pointing to the couch. Hesitantly, the three followed while Harry sat down in one of the armchairs and Draco sat on the back of it and took Harry's hand in his. Immediately Hermione's gaze lingered on the hands.
"Have you ever tried it?", Draco didn't really want to ask that, but he sensed that Harry needed to talk in order to heal, and he also sensed that he was the only one Harry would trust with something like that at the moment. The Gryffindor was silent for a while, then he said quietly, "Yes, it wasn't long ago ..."
"Good, please let yourself go," she said and the boys followed. Again the wand wandered and the woman's gaze became more concerned.
"We really could have been friends," he said abruptly. Remus seemed surprised at first, then he laughed bitterly.
"Mum, it's important. We want to be buried together and ... and I know it's not ... not befitting our status, but we want to be buried next to Harry's parents, in Godric's Hollow," Draco said quivering. Narcissa could say nothing, tears streaming down her face. Lucius took a deep breath and then nodded.
"I suppose it will have to go like this," he said resignedly and made bedding appear with the wave of the wand. The wand apparently obeyed him.
"A-All of it ... it's tearing me apart," Harry moaned. The woman let her wand wander over Harry and turned pale.
"The pain was too much," Madame Pomfrey said, putting a hand under Harry's neck and pouring him a potion. It took a few moments, but then Harry regained consciousness.
They walked back to the dungeons together. When they entered the flat, Severus was sitting at the kitchen table and seemed to be correcting papers. When the boys entered, he put the quill aside.
"Harry and Draco live ... lived here for a few days," he said explanatorily, putting the cloaks aside.
"Do you want to say ... well, vows?" Lucius asked hesitantly. The Malfoys had a tradition of having their own vows, but he realised that the two of them would have a hard time finding the right words. Draco looked at Harry, who nodded barely perceptibly.
"What's wrong?" Remus wanted to know and looked worriedly at his friend. He was holding his left arm.
"Yes, you do that and I'll put on my blue dress, that should be fine. We'll meet Blaise at the grand staircase at just before eight. The main thing is that Filch doesn't catch us."
"What? No, Potter is not the problem. But I don't want my son to have to commit himself to someone at sixteen, and under duress. If he does, I want him to be able to decide for himself," Narcissa said seriously.
"Okay," he said and walked next to Draco in the direction of Hagrid's hut. He is teaching Care of Magical Creatures in years six and seven this year. Ron and Hermione had decided against this N.E.W.T. course. Ron felt that the course would be of no use to him and Hermione already had her hands full. Harry wasn't too keen on caring for magical creatures either, but did it for Hagrid's sake. So he trudged along beside Draco and noticed that the other was watching him.
"He's coming," Severus said and jumped out of bed. He reached for his trousers and shirt and pulled them on.
"Because I always had to and the only one I could rely on was me!" said Harry, looking back at Draco.
"I'm sure thatâ€˜s them, don't let on, I beg you," Severus murmured quickly and moved away from Remus. Remus looked up and wiped his eyes. The Potions Master straightened his shoulders and opened the door.
"Go in and come back to the dungeons afterwards. Good ... good luck," Severus said, then disappeared. Harry and Draco looked at each other, then climbed the stairs and knocked.
"Don't you dare use mine!" he said, then disappeared behind a door at the end of the corridor. Harry groaned. He took off his frock coat and then faltered. He really wasn't eager to see Snape's naked body. Especially as he didn't have pyjamas anyway. He was glad not to have to go to the toilet, that would come soon enough. Without further ado, he lay down on the couch in the clothes he was still wearing. It was far too small for his current height. It took him a while to find a position in which he could sleep. One thing struck him. He was not in pain. Otherwise his body usually ached, especially after the holidays, this got better and better throughout the year, but he was rarely without pain, but now he felt really good. He turned on his side and hoped fervently that he would not have any nightmares that night.
"I'll have to report this to the Headmaster, I'm sure you know that," Harry glanced at Draco, who still didn't dare look at him.
"Are they actually your in-laws now?" he asked quietly and Hermione, who had heard, rolled her eyes.
"You already do," he said. The Slytherin lowered his lips to the Gryffindor's again and ran his hand down his T-shirt. Gently he stroked Harry's chest. He enjoyed the touch, but as his thoughts wandered to the bond, he stiffened imperceptibly.
"Don't worry Sev. The bay is shallow and the water is calm. That's where I taught Draco to swim," Lucius interjected.
"I'll get the boys before panic sets in here. I don't think it will take the Lord long to get here. Go and round up the Order, we need to do everything we can to protect the school, Harry and Draco for as long as possible," Severus said, reaching for his cloak and wand. Remus nodded and took his jacket.
They walked in silence up to the castle and into Severus' flat. Remus was getting more and more worried, because he really had never seen Severus like this before. It was true, many years had passed since the time of the marauders and although Remus had never really taken part in Sirius' and James' pranks, he was part of it and he couldn't blame Severus for resenting him too. Over the years they had only ever seen each other sporadically and mostly at the Order meetings, the fact that the Potions Master now even took him with him only worried Remus immeasurably more.
When he landed in front of Malfoy Manor, he fervently hoped that no one but the house elf was present today either. The house elf led him into the drawing room, as he had done a few days ago.
"Yeah, see you then," the latter said and smiled at Hermione, who gave him a quick kiss on the hair.
It was getting late. Severus wanted to go to his romms, but then changed his mind. He turned and walked to the hospital wing. All was quiet. He entered the ward, which was empty except for the bed he had enlarged himself. Quietly he stepped closer. Potter was lying on his back, breathing calmly and evenly. Draco had lain down on his side and, to Severus' surprise, was clutching Harry's hand tightly. Severus looked back at Harry and sighed softly.
Narcissa and Lucius had reached the Defence classroom by now. It was supposed to be an official parent-teacher meeting and the teachers did that in their classrooms. They knocked and Severus immediately opened the door.
"O-Okay and what is it?" asked Draco, feeling his stomach tighten painfully and Harry's hand in his was also ice cold by now. Severus now sat down on the small coffee table so he could look at Harry, even if it took all his strength.
Lucius Malfoy knocked the dust off his shoes, took a deep breath and entered the Manor. He was exhausted as he was every time he came from a Death Eaters meeting. How he hated it, but they did it for Draco. He had joined the Death Eaters because it was expected of a Malfoy and so he did, offering his services to the Ministry as a spy. After the first Wizarding War, Lucius had hoped that he and his family could live peacefully, but he had been wrong. Since Voldemort's return, he has always lived in fear of discovery, for by now no one could be trusted in the Ministry either, and so Lucius works in the dark, trying to protect Muggle-borns and half-bloods through detours. The affair between Draco and Potter made everything much more complicated.
"I know, but right now we need to take care of the students first," Severus said, his voice quivering.
"No, it isn't. You fell in love with him and nothing more. It's perfectly normal. When did it happen?" he wanted to know, smiling. Harry turned his head to Remus and shook his head.
"I have to agree with him!" said Remus, still smiling, leaning against a table. Snape rolled his eyes.
"I knew you were stubborn, but this stubborn," Severus said now, smiling and pulling Harry into a short hug as well.
"Harry, I'm not alone - not anymore. I couldn't be prouder of you and I know James, Lily and Sirius are too and I know you'll see them and that comforts me," he said, hugging Harry tightly. He didn't want to cry, wanted to stay strong even though it was tearing him up inside. He had lost Lily and James, and later Sirius. Harry was all he had left, and now he too would go. Then he felt Severus' hand on his back and broke away from Harry. He looked at Draco and stroked his shoulder briefly.
"I can't really say. You fell over and I suddenly had the feeling I couldn't breathe, then everything went black. For a moment I felt like I was floating and I ... I smelled salt water and then I was lying on the forest floor. I thought, if I'm alive, maybe you are too. So I kept quiet. Mum was going to see if we were still alive. She managed to slip me my wand, I jumped up and then ... well, you know the rest."
"Thank you for everything you have done for me. I was the first real family I had and ... and I couldn't have asked for a better one," he said haltingly and stepped back up to Draco.
"Erm ... yes, come let's do some chores before Severus comes back tonight," Draco said quickly and reached for his book and the parchments again.
"Harry," he said and embraced the young man. Harry cried and pressed himself tightly against his godfather. The latter stroked his head and held him tightly.
"MUM! DAD!" cried Draco immediately, throwing himself into his parents' arms. It seemed as if everything he had been pushing away for the last few days suddenly came crashing down on the Slytherin. He cried and his mother hugged him tightly while his father kept stroking his head.
"Me too, but you know what. This, this feels right and we're going to enjoy it when the time comes, I promise you," the Slytherin said, stroking Harry's upper arms down to his hips and kissing him desiringly. Harry returned the kiss and knew that nothing more could happen to him with Draco by his side.
"I never had a real family like that. The closest thing was the Weasleys, and Sirius and Remus, but with you it's something else and .... And I hate that I'll never enjoy it because I can't. I hate that we'll never sit in your garden and drink tea, we'll never have children romping around the house with their grandparents, we'll never be able to stand on the beach together and let the water run over our feet, we won't be able to grow old together," Harry concluded, wiping away his tears. Draco leaned over him and stroked his cheek with a smile.
"Come on, we should go, otherwise Severus will get us in trouble," he said and led the way. Harry walked beside him and thought about how he should ask Draco something specific. He seemed to suspect that something was bothering his friend.
"Had you in my arms, you were hardly bigger than a mandrake," said the half giant, wiping the tears from his cheek.
"It's all right, you're here now," said Dumbledore. The headmaster walked up and down three times and immediately a door appeared out of nowhere on the bare wall.
"I'm glad to hear that, so something good came of it, didn't it? Well, go and have some supper, and Harry I beg you to remember our agreement," said Dumbledore, looking at the young man seriously over his half-moon glasses.
"So what was that about 'not really'?" the latter now wanted to know. Draco sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose.
"But that's not because of my technique, it's because the wolf doesn't like it," Remus defended himself.
"Oh ... Well, it was an empathic potion. With this one can feel another's emotions for a short time. But Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Potter added hellebore and what this potion does now, I can't say exactly," the teacher explained.
"D-Draco is right, what is that possibility?", Harry wanted to know quietly. Severus took a deep breath and looked at them both seriously.
"I love you," she whispered, then she joined her husband and they both left the Room of Requirement. It was at that moment that Draco sank to his knees crying and Harrys could do nothing but hold him in his arms.
"But ... but that's great, then you can kill him now, can't you?" Severus now looked at Remus, who was visibly struggling to keep his composure.
"Well, sometimes it pays to look behind the faÃ§ade," Harry said simply and smiled. Draco remained silent and looked back at Hagrid, who had obviously finished feeding him.
"Yes, that is why we are still here. For one thing, because of you and for another, our estate is besieged by reporters, because your wedding has also become known in the meantime, of course, and now everyone is waiting for an exclusive photo," Narcissa said with a sigh.
"Yes, I thought you would want to, and it would only be fair. I'll get them here in the morning and you can tell them then."
"Shhh ... it's over honey, he's alive and so are you. All is well. Come on, let's get him out of here," Narcissa said quivering and stroking her son's tangled hair. Gently she pulled him to his feet while Lucius bent down and lifted Harry in his arms.
"Well, that's not what worries me, it's something else entirely. When Harry came to the school, I fervently hoped that the curse that hit him would not affect him further, but already in his second year here, I had to realise that this was not the case. He could and can speak to snakes, an ability he surely acquired through the curse. It was only through Harry's blood that Voldemort could be resurrected and that Harry's mind had a connection to the Dark Lord became all too clear last year. This connection, Severus it is not just a remnant of the curse, it is much more..."
"Just promise me that we won't separate again, okay?" said Harry softly. His friend kissed him on the hair and said, "Never again!"
"Or the bond, yes we are aware of that," Draco said, looking to Harry whose hand was clenching around his.
"Hey, it's all good ... I love you Harry and I would marry you right now, right here," he said, gently brushing away the other's tears.
"I know ... please sit down," Severus said and pointed to the couch. The two did as they were told and looked at the men anxiously.
"DRACO!" she screamed desperately and dropped down on top of her son. As she did so, she unobtrusively reached for Draco's wand, which lay beside him, and slipped it to him.
"No, we've gone through all the possibilities, if we flee we'll plunge the Wizarding World into war and we don't want that," Harry said now.
They walked on and soon they heard voices that seemed to come from a nearby clearing. Harry looked at Draco, who swallowed hard, gripped his husband's hand tighter and then nodded. They stepped out of the shadows of the trees into the spacious clearing and Harry felt for a moment as if his forehead would explode. He gasped but managed to stay on his feet. A dozen Death Eaters stood there staring at them and in the middle - Voldemort. The dark lord looked stricken, but grinned derisively when he spotted the young Gryffindor.
"Tell me, Snape is really your uncle?", Harry wanted to know after they had extinguished the light and both had been silent for a while.
"Hello James, hello Lily and Siri, I think you are with them. I don't even know why I came here, but I think you should know. Harry doesn't have anyone left except well, me, if that counts. Although actually he has someone now, someone who really loves him, but they're going to lose each other and there's nothing I can do about it...", tears ran down the werewolf's cheeks. Energetically he wiped them away.
"Sure and since Hogsmeade is on the schedule today, do you want me to bring you something?", Blaise wanted to know and stood up.
"Good night, Severus," said Dumbledore and immediately the Potions Master had disappeared. The headmaster let himself sink back into his chair and looked at his phoenix, which eyed him with interest.
When Severus reached the Headmaster's office, he was not the first one there. Professor McGonagall was standing in the room and turned around in surprise when Severus hurried in.
"Miss Granger, Mr Weasley, you can visit Mr Potter. He is in the hospital wing, but just the two of you and please keep it to yourselves," he said.
"Yes, I understand you and well I think we're even, aren't we? After all, I almost took you with me to your death," he said, and it was meant to sound funny, but there was more truth in it than Harry had wanted. Draco glared at him. He saw how much Harry was suffering and he sensed that the latter had only ever done so in silence. Slowly, he raised his hand and placed it on Harry's cheek.
"Now then, I want to sleep," Draco said, turning out the light and turning onto his side. Blaise looked sympathetically at Harry once more before he too turned off his bedside lamp and plunged the room into almost complete darkness, with only the pale light from the magical windows still dimly visible. Harry turned on his side and pulled the blanket over his shoulders. It was cold on the floor, colder than he would have thought. He couldn't find any sleep, at some point the burning in his chest increased again and he knew that Draco had slipped further away from the edge in his sleep. True, the intense pain only came when the other was further than two metres away, but even at one metre he could already feel the burning. Harry now crawled as close as he could to the Slytherin's bed and it helped. The burning was subsiding. He tightened his legs and tried to fall asleep.
Herbology went off without any major incidents. Finally, Harry was able to exchange a few words with Ron and Hermione.
"NO HARRY, BY MERLIN I WAS JUST TRYING TO PROTECT YOU. I couldn't ... I couldn't bear to lose you and as soon as I saw the scars, the injuries, there was this fear, the fear that one day you wouldn't be there anymore. I know you might hate me now, and I was wrong to betray your trust, but I just couldn't help it," Draco finished quietly now, slumping slightly and staring at the sheet. Suddenly he felt Harry's hand on his arm and looked up.
"Itâ€™s right, isn't it? Didn't you have to hold hands too?" said Pansy with a grin. Almost simultaneously, Draco and Harry pointed their wands at the Slytherin, who immediately flew through the air and was just caught by Snape.
"Yes, I guess that's right. Well, then, you two should get some more sleep and I guess you'll be besieged here in the morning. So good night," said the witch.
"I know, but still. You already didn't eat yesterday. Do you want to fall down?" he asked Slytherin.
When Harry and Remus came into the living room together, the Gryffindor was momentarily speechless. Of course he had seen Draco in a dress robe before, but now it was something completely different. Draco's muscles, which Harry knew and loved, were clearly visible under the other's pristine white shirt. He had combed his hair loosely to one side and used very little gel. At the precinct he wore a small posy of forget-me-nots. Now he approached Harry with a smile and pinned a small bouquet on him as well.
"Good morning, I see you're an early riser too," Severus Snape said and sat down at the kitchen table. Remus Lupin looked up from his coffee and nodded.
"That means you're just playing a part, too?" he wanted to know. Draco, still staring at the hands holding each other, looked up.
"You know sometimes I think I'm still lying on the forest floor and I'm imagining it all," Harry said abruptly. Draco looked at his husband, whose gaze went into the distance. Gently he stroked the slight laugh lines on his eyes that had come in the last few years. Then he kissed him desiringly.
"What, embarrassed? Honey, no one will ever read this, it's just for us," Draco said, bending down and kissing Harry gently.
"Hey morning, good to see you without .... well, him," he said and lowered himself down next to Harry.
"We have to go to detention," Draco sneered back, grabbing Harry by the upper arm and pulling him along.
"No, I just wanted to tell you that I'm glad you're here," Severus said, lifting his head to pull Remus back into a deep kiss.
"Will you do that for me?", Harry nodded with a grin. Sirius stroked his hair briefly and then stood up.
"I'm about to 'eww' you guys. Off you go outside to play. In an hour Uncle Remus and Uncle Severus will be here with Eileen, then you can annoy them," Draco said sternly and his two children jumped up.
"Narcissa, be so kind as to see if he is really dead. I almost feel sorry for your son, but well we all make sacrifices, don't we?" sneered the lord, but his voice was strangely weak. Narcissa broke away from her husband, tears streaming down her face, and she walked slowly towards the bodies lying on the ground. First she came to Harry and knelt before him. He was cold and his lips pale. Carefully she bent down and stretched out her fingers. Was there something? A pulse? A breathing? Yes, it was there, faint but there. Narcissa's heart was racing, what should she do?
"Potter! Wake up! Now!" he said emphatically. With difficulty, Harry opened his eyes and did not understand what he was seeing. He saw himself, but it was certainly not a mirror. He startled and almost fell out of bed.
"Yes, you should. First you say goodbye to your certain death and then you live again. We had already divided up your things," Blaise said with a smile.
"I ... I'll get the headmaster and your houseteachers and we'll see. Mr. Weasley, Mr. Zabini, you go to dinner, please. You can't help here anyway," the witch said, addressing the other two boys.
"Are you all right?" Blaise wanted to know and pulled Harry back to his feet. He could only nod weakly.
"I don't hate you and I never have. I know you didn't mean for any of that to happen, but it just hurt, you know? Trusting someone is pretty hard for me and somehow it was different with you, that's why I was so hurt," Harry explained and hadn't even noticed how he was holding Draco's hand again.
"Thank you," Harry said quietly and without looking up. After a few hours of silent work, Harry became restless, he had to go to the toilet urgently and was dead tired anyway. He stretched and slammed the book shut.
"Thank you Headmaster," Lucius Malfoy said, standing at the other end of the room with his wife, the Headmaster, Severus and Remus.
"I don't know. I ... I was afraid that I might not be able to go back to Hogwarts if I told you and then ... I didn't know any different. It was normal, I felt it was normal at some point. What's going to happen now?" Harry looked up and tears glistened in his eyes.
"I don't think so really. Severus and McGonagall were probably right there and when Sev took you away, there were only a few in the corridors," Draco said and Harry nodded. Draco took Harry's hand in his and smiled.
"Nothing, nothing ... just that you're right," said his best friend, looking slightly embarrassed, which was not lost on Harry.
"Good, now both of you go to dinner. I'll have Harry's things taken to the Slytherin," Professor McGonagall said, looking pityingly at her student. Harry just nodded and Malfoy sighed in exasperation.
"And only when all the Horcruxes are destroyed, only then can he be killed?" asked Draco and Remus nodded.
"Oh that, yes it's quite nice, but...well let's not go there. So what's going on with Harry?" he wanted to know. Severus looked at the other in surprise.
"Well, we'll be going then. I don't think you'll be able to attend class until ... well you know," Hermione said, playing nervously with a strand of her hair. Draco shook his head.
"Yes, but we will do all this in another, better life, I firmly believe that," he said, pulling Harry back into his arms.
Draco woke up suddenly, as if he had overslept. He was breathing heavily and then he felt Harry in his arms and everything came back to him. He smiled and looked at the other in his arms. They had bonded and it was the most beautiful thing Draco had ever experienced. Slowly Harry stirred and looked up, straight into Draco's eyes.
"Because she tortured you, and believe me, if she were here, I'd shock her!" said Draco angrily, and Harry smiled.
"Do you know what I really did in ancient runes? I read everything I found about the soul bond. That potion it would never have worked if you and I had been completely indifferent to each other. We had feelings for each other before and you were aware of them, that's why you were in such terrible pain. I knew I liked you, but I didn't know how much or how deeply, but with every hour we spent together it became clearer, and then ... Harry, I can't let you jump because... by Merlin, can't you think it?", Harry's tears were falling without ceasing now, they were still standing on the wall in the dark and below them was the abyss. Draco tried to pull Harry down but he shook his head. Only seconds later a spell hit them both from behind and they were thrown back onto the safe platform. Draco didn't notice much, only that his uncle and McGonagall were suddenly there, that Severus knelt beside Harry and touched him on the forehead and then someone pulled him to his feet.
"Because you're right. It should be my job, because I sentence them to death," Albus said. Severus nodded weakly.
"Merry Christmas, Harry. Where are your husband and my princess?" he wanted to know and looked around searchingly. Harry grinned. Snape had really softened over the years and since he was a grandfather even more. Only in front of his students he still didn't show any shame.
"That means that if I'm not really dead, then Draco isn't either and .... but what are you doing here, are you also just a fantasy?", Sirius smiled again and looked briefly at the children who were still playing tag.
"No, but I didn't want it to end here and now," he said breathlessly, turning off the water and pulling Harry out of the shower. Quickly he dried them with a spell and kissed Harry again. Backwards, he pushed him back into the bedroom. At some point Harry felt the bed against the back of his knees and let himself fall. Draco lay over him and for the first time their naked bodies touched in full. They both groaned and had to break the passionate kiss briefly. Gently, Draco stroked Harry's cheek.
When Blaise entered the hospital wing, he could see neither Harry nor Draco. But he had no time to think about it any longer, because Madame Pomfrey was coming towards him.
"Harry?" Hermione's voice was strangely muffled by the stabbing headache that surrounded the sixteen-year-old. Harry Potter had hardly slept, eaten or drunk in the last few weeks. It wasn't just the treatment of his relatives, even if the beatings and humiliation had increased again. The death of Sirius, made everything seem somehow pointless and hopeless. Now he had been back at Hogwarts for a fortnight and rarely took part in the conversations of the other Gryffindors.
"Alright, so anyway. I'll take care of Draco and now I have to go," Severus said, throwing on his cloak.
"What's that?", Harry wheeled around. Dracos was standing in front of him with a towel around his hips. Immediately the Gryffindor pulled his shirt back on.
"Are you ready?" the latter now wanted to know and stepped into the room of the now seventeen-year-old.
"What about him?", Draco suddenly stood by the bed. At the same moment Harry relaxed. The pain subsided, leaving only a slight dull hum in his body.
"You'll see, Potter, tomorrow night you'll swim like a fish," Draco said, putting one arm around the other and despite the cool evening wind, Harry felt warm.
"Snape? No way, Harry probably has to scrub cauldrons with a toothbrush," Ron said and took another sausage.
"Yes, but ... alright. I won't say anything, but I'll show you," Draco hesitantly reached for Harry's sleeping shirt and carefully pulled it up a little. Now Severus could see the Gryffindor's back. Even in the rather dim light, he could make out the battered skin. Scars of all kinds covered the narrow back.
"I'll take you back to my flat. Remus will gather the Order and I'll inform the other teachers. We will protect the school and you."
"Our victory. When Dad carried you into the castle, everyone thought you were dead. I'll never forget Professor McGonagall's scream, nor Mrs. Weasley's. Blaise saw me first and then he knew you had to be alive. We brought you here to the hospital wing. Madame Pomfrey said your body and mind just needed to recover, but after two days everyone was terribly worried that you wouldn't wake up. The Aurors took Voldemort's dead body from the forest and Bellatrix's ..."
"The blood protection in my relatives' house protects me from you-know-who. It wouldn't change anything, I have to go back there every year, because it's still better than death," Harry said and stood up.
"Mhm ... the man he meant, but I only know one Gellert and ... no, that can't be, he has ...", Draco didn't get any further, because now Narcissa and Lucius came into the room and stared at Harry speechlessly.
"Okay, I can see that, but with who? Wait, you don't mean Lupin?" Draco looked at his friend in surprise.
"It won't rip my guts out if I move away from you, so ..." he said with a sneer. There was instant deep hurt in Harry's gaze and it hit Draco harder than he had thought.
"Well, there's often a fine line between hatred and, well, interesting. You know he has to pretend, and it's often hard for him."
"Mione, come on," Ron whispered, holding out his hand to the young woman. They crept towards the grand staircase, ever careful not to run into another trust student, or Filch. After stealing out of the common room, they had changed their clothes. Blaise wanted to wait for them so that they could claim detention if necessary. When they arrived at the stairs, however, there was no sign of the Slytherin.
"No, there is not enough room in the dormitory anyway. In Slytherin, only two students share a room at a time, so we will be able to accommodate Potter there, even if it may not be befitting his status," said Snape.
"No Harry, let's wait and see, we're not going to rush things now," Severus said energetically and picked up the cloak of invisibility. Draco pulled Harry to his feet.
"We now know what the accidental potion did to you ..." began Snape and it was not only Draco who heard the deep concern in the teacher's voice.
"Very good," the Gryffindor murmured and saw that Blaise was now giving them evil glances. Draco raised his arms again and Harry followed suit.
"Well, that's a bit difficult...I...it's about Potter," Draco said, blushing on the spot. Harry heart immediately slipped into his stomach and he hoped Draco wouldn't notice. He cleared his throat.
"Take care of yourself," he said in a brittle voice and then squeezed her in Lee's arm, pulling the crying girl with him.
"We are happy for you!" said Narcissa and again tears ran down the woman's face. Draco stood up and knelt in front of his mother.
"You too!" he whispered to Draco, who also reached out and although he hadn't expected it, the animal now came to him too. The fur was incredibly soft and warm and yet cool again. Draco felt as if warm syrup was running down his gullet. For a tiny moment, everything seemed simple. There was a crack somewhere and the unicorn raised its head, listening. Then it looked once more at the boys before trotting off.
"Yeah sure ... that sounds good," Harry said and together they entered the room. It was quite a small bathroom, but there was a shower and a bathtub next to a toilet and a sink. Everything was in dark marble and Harry whistled through his teeth.
"All right, I'll check on you tonight," he said then and was already at the door when he heard Harry's voice.
"I didn't know about that, my lord. Draco come here," Lucius said, the tremor in his voice hard to deny.
"I didn't say anything because that was between her and me! She just wanted me to go and have a good cry somewhere and I didn't want to give her that triumph and now if you'll excuse me sir, I've got homework," Harry said, reaching for his school bag, which Severus had carelessly thrown on the floor.
"Harry's right. You are a great teacher Professor," Draco said and smiled. Hagrid nodded gratefully and let them go.
"Let's go to sleep, okay?" asked Harry and Draco nodded. He turned out the light and then took Harry's hand again.
"Very good, most of them are destroyed. I think only two are missing. The snake and ... and something else we could identify," Dumbledore said, visibly hesitant. Severus knew he was getting nowhere here. So he stood up and straightened his shoulders.
"I understand you Minerva and I too ... I don't want to do this either, but in the end it's Harry and Draco's decision and they ... they want to sacrifice themselves, as awful as that sounds," Severus said wanly as there was another knock on the door and Remus came into the room. With him were Kingsley and Arthur Weasley.
Hermione and Ron stood outside the Great Hall waiting. Since Harry had gone to detention the day before yesterday, they had seen neither him nor Draco. McGonagall had told them that the two were back in the hospital wing, but she hadn't said why. They were not allowed to visit Harry either. Now they stood here waiting for Blaise Zabini, hoping that he knew more.
"Whatever you say," he said, corking his potion. It hit Harry harder than he had thought that Draco was obviously pissed. So they spent lunch in Snape's rooms in silence and walked to Defence in equal silence. Here Draco and Harry were left holding the bag. They were practising unsaid disarming spells. But that only worked if they stood further apart, further than two metres. And so Harry and Draco sat next to each other against the wall and watched the others practising.
"Yes, I think so too, but it could be us now, couldn't it?", Severus came closer and nodded barely noticeably.
"Of course we will grant you this wish," he said and pulled his son and also Harry into his arms. Only a moment later, there was a knock at the door.
"HARRY POTTER IS DEAD," he shouted and cheers broke out among the Death Eaters. Only Lucius and Narcissa stood there, hand in hand, staring at the boys' lifeless bodies.
"With your permission, I would explain the matter to them as quickly as possible. They need to know how to behave. Potter will have to stay in the hospital wing for another two days or so, Draco too, of course, but after that they should return to normal classes and understand the seriousness of their situation," he said.
Gently, he slipped off his T-shirt while Harry stripped himself of his sweatpants. Draco took off his clothes too and, still kissing, they got into the shower. The warm water fell down on them and neither of them seemed to want to break the kiss. Gently Draco ran his hands down Harry's sides to his hips and then stroked his friend's back. Harry also began to explore the Slytherin's body with his hands and stroked from his chest to his stomach, he didn't dare go any further, although he would have liked to touch Draco somewhere else. But Draco seemed to know what his friend wanted and reached for his hand.
"Yes, but surely the cut was not deep enough either, in any case they looked after me and left me more or less alone for a few days. But surely only out of fear of the neighbours' gossip if a dead youth were to be brought out of their house," he said bitterly.
"We thought ... Well, you were in a coma or something," Ron said sheepishly. Blaise looked at his best friend and clearly sensed his tension.
"What are we going to do?" she asked, the smile giving way to deep lines of worry. Severus looked back at the door and then at the medi-witch.
"T-There must be a solution, surely?" said Lucius, pushing his sobbing wife back onto one of the chairs.
"I don't think anyone will say anything and if they do, we're on our way to a meeting with Dumbledore and now come on, it's time," Severus said, looking to Remus who nodded in agreement. They let the boys go first, as far as they could tell, and then followed. The corridors were empty, so close to curfew, only a few of the trust students were still out and about and apart from a curt greeting, most, ignored Severus and Remus. They climbed to the seventh floor and outside the wall that hid the Room of Requirement, Dumbledore was already waiting with two Ravenclaw students - a boy and a girl. Severus had never seen them before, not consciously in any case. They appeared to be first years. Under the cloak of invisibility, Harry and Draco also looked at each other questioningly.
