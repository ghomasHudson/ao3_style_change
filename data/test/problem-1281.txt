Ron disliked St. Mungo’s for a number of reasons. The bad memories, firstly; followed by the way Harry always seemed to deflate when they had to visit it for a case. There were a handful of others as well, (the smell, the food, the wallpaper choice) but they were more easily dismissed.
“Please don’t,” she said quietly.
Ron had to fight off a grin. The Welcome Witch, now satisfied they were done, turned back to her desk.
“You hate Ethiopian food, every time you eat it you complain about how spicy it is.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Why isn’t there a spell to have paperwork do itself?” she asked.
They sat like that, side by side, in silence for what felt like years. Pansy kept glancing at Draco, clearly trying to say something without having to use words. Both of them were bad with emotions but they were both even worse when it came to putting emotions into words.
Harriet opened the door on her second round of frantic knocking. (Her messy hair and crooked glasses and a baggy t-shirt and lightning shaped scar and emerald eyes and

unsympathetic towards Draco’s endeavor.
It was all the things that didn't belong to people like her.
sleep.
(Even though Ron insisted he could handle the food this time, he spent a solid two minutes coughing after the first bite. Harry was unable to help during those two minutes, because she was laughing so hard her stomach hurt.)
“Let me guess, elderflower wine?” Her voice sounded venomous.
. Draco couldn't find it in herself to feel guilty for waking her up.) "Draco? What in the world are yo…" Harriet trailed off, her eyes widening as she took in Draco. When she asked what happened Draco couldn't find the strength to explain, to put it to words.
"Why is it so...choppy?"
Draco’s father gifted her honey blonde hair. She hated it. When she was a child it wasn't as obvious, she had always been active. So many hours spent outside washed out the darker shades, it wasn't until around her first year at Hogwarts it started darkening. She had asked her mother if Draco could dye her hair platinum like her. She had said yes without any trace of hesitation.
she promised,
“Do you want to join me for dinner?” Harry nearly jumped, she had certainly not been expecting that. Ron wasn’t really the type to just gloss over her angry outbursts and move on. If anything, he was prone to getting angry right along with her.
They had managed to apparate back to the ministry before four-thirty with three new cases to write up, four to close, and one to pass over to the improper use of magic office. Of all the days Harry could have used a slow day, the universe gave her one of the busiest in her career.
Evie was the most terrifying woman she had ever met. Short in both stature and temper, she held a fire in her eyes that could melt the arctic and enough ice in her veins to freeze over hell. She also just so happened to be the Head Healer in St. Mungos.
"Yes," she breathed turning back to the mirror, "it's perfect."
Harriet leaned forward into Draco’s face to tuck a loose strand of blonde hair behind her ear. "Yeah." She said quietly. Fondness surgered in Draco’s chest.
She eyed the large almost-empty wine glass in Draco’s hand.
He and Harry sat in one of the waiting rooms. Every time someone walked by Ron sat up straighter, trying to look more Auror-like, in case they were the staff member they were waiting on.
Ron rolled his eyes. "Honestly mate, there is no way that's comfortable." She flipped him off with a huff, but had no real heat behind it.
Recently however, her relationship with sleep (if you could even call it that) became more fickle. If she kept having sleepless nights she would have to find a potion master to brew up something for her, or at the very least Hermione.
“No.” Evie shoved a handful of Floo powder into her hand and walked away. Draco stared after her for a second and stepped into the fireplace. She couldn’t tell if the sensation of breathlessness was from the Floo.
Ron and Harry shared a glance before they both quickly stood up and followed after her. If Ron hadn't been hurrying after her, he would have smirked at Harry trying to disentangle herself from the chair.
She made a promise to herself to work on her sleep schedule when she and Ron parted ways after dinner the other night. She didn’t want to cause him, or Hermione, or anyone really, any more unnecessary worry. It was easier said than done, though.
"Of course."
Draco spent the next few hours in her bathroom, staring into the mirror. Her father stared back.
Sleep used to come easily to her. Harry could remember how many times she had gratefully sunk into a bed and fell asleep once her head hit the pillow. Even when she was forced to sleep on the hard ground, or in her cramped cupboard, she could close her eyes and drift off quickly.
"Can we talk about the case itself first?" Harry asked loudly, still a little ways behind both Ron and the healer. (Harry, he noted, had much better luck at dodging the workers.) Sharp stopped. She kept her back to them, but Ron could see her pinch the bridge of her nose. She looked exhausted and upset, tension hanging heavy on her shoulders.
I was going to make this chapter super long but I kept having to rework things and then would refuse to post it cause it wasn't long enough, but its been months and I have caved
"You like it?" Harriet asked from the doorway, leaning her hip against the frame. Draco turns to glance at her when she speaks and catches something...soft in her eyes.
“Nah, the paperwork will always have you trapped,” she said, trying to catch the paper as Ron threw it back at her. She missed.
To put in plainly Draco was doomed in every sense of the word. Pansy, while most definitely understanding as to why Draco was holed up in her flat, was equally if not
Day drinking wasn’t a habit of Draco's,
"Just...different."
“Finally...freedom!” He stretched his arms over his head and leaned back in his chair. Harry balled up an abandoned note card and chucked it at him. She ignored the “Oi!” from Ron as the paper hit him.
(Draco was still healing, still learning to heal. She couldn’t walk in a straight line yet, still managed to reverse progress and make herself have to start over. It was a long road, she knew.)
“...I meant for it to go there.” She didn’t sound convincing, even to herself.
“I took yesterday off.”
“I know.”
enjoy!
Sometimes Draco wished she could go back to the summer she turned eleven. She was still Altas then, and was starting to feel wildly uncomfortable in her own body, but despite that it was one of the most carefree and happy times in her life. The excitement of getting ready to go to Hogwarts, of being sorted into her house (which would most definitely be Slytherin thank-you-very-much) , of making new friends, and of course meeting the famous and elusive Harriet Potter.
"What do you want it to look like?"
She dyes her hair platinum even after her transition. Until she builds up the courage and doesn’t. Draco learns to regret it when she stops. She gets a reminder of why she did in the first place.
misgendering and deadnaming
really worried.” He leaned forward now, coming even closer and Harry was burning. Her nails were digging into her inner arm. The sharp pain was grounding.
"Yeah?" Draco didn't sound as close to crying as she had an hour ago, but it still creeped into her tone.
She couldn't focus, couldn't see his face, couldn't think of any of the healing spells she knows. He left, door swinging shut with a click.
Ron chuckled slightly. “We could ask ‘mione to invent one, she’d enjoy the challenge.” There was a pause. It was Harry who said what they were both thinking.
“Go home,” she said, her voice forceful. She took a sip from the flask and grimaced, muttering under her breath about cheap vodka. Draco’s hand darted out to reclaim her flask but was met with air as her boss jumped back.
lowkey detailed depiction of injury and violence
Draco hadn't thought about her father in a month. She was healing, she was getting better, she didn’t make impulsive and stupid decisions just to distance herself from him now. She wore her hair down without thought, stopped dying it. She could wear short sleeves again, see the ugly red mark of her skin and not flinch.
“How would you?” Draco said, shrugging. “It’s not like you would care about something like that.”
“Not that
“You’d know,” Harry said wryly, looking almost sad when he met Draco’s eyes.
“Maybe they’re all working together,” Hermione suggests. “So its harder to pin the blame on one of them?”
ill not miss me. I will miss yo
He half-hoped that the forest would bring him Harry again, but he didn’t know how to ask. He knew it brought out the bits of him he wanted to go dormant, that Harry brought out all of his nastiness and made him cruel. Even still, thinking about his attention made Draco’s skin prickle.
Harry digs a few coins out of his bag, setting them on the check, which wraps itself neatly into a star and floats back over to the kitchen. “Want me to Apparate you home?”
“Dara, blink once if you see toads, twice if you see frogs.”
“Of course,” Harry said, giving her a smile. “I don’t want to make you upset, I just say dumb shit.”
When he woke up the next morning, he could still smell it on himself, foreign and strange in his bed.
Draco shoved him into the nearest suit of armor, barely giving the other boy time to catch himself. “Oh fuck off.”
“You need practice,” Luna counters. “It’s scary when people sift around in your head. You remember things you’ve forgotten. You remember things you don’t want to remember and then you have to live with the fact that someone else knows them too. It’s not easy, it’s really difficult both magically and emotionally.”
The next morning, Harry emerged from his bed rested and cheerful, chucking a dirty sock at Ron, who had class in an hour but enjoyed staying in bed until the last possible second.
“Good lord,” Hermione says, taking a long drink from her cup. “I wish I was more surprised honestly. Can’t you leave the poor boy alone?”
Another Long Pause:
He’s not sure whether he’s hallucinating Draco or dreaming him in this muddy fever vision of an unforgiving boy. The dream is always the same. Draco is lying with him in bed, the gray sheets stretching on for ages, their hands too far apart to reach. His eyes are closed.
Harry slides the radio across the counter, feeling like something has solidified between them. He isn’t exactly sure what it is, but it feels comfortable and warm and Harry wants to keep it. “It’s only picking up static.”
The third meeting of the Ravenclaw knitting club was going largely according to plan, with a large group of Ravenclaws knitting something odd and red in the corner, Hermione working on a pair of mittens she was planning on giving Molly for Christmas, and Ron wrapping Ginny in an awful lot of sparkling black yarn.
It begins to rain, one droplet after another landing on his glasses. He casts a shield charm over both of them just as it picks up, rain tapping unevenly on the upper barrier of the magic.
“I didn’t ask,” Draco replied, hauling her back into the dance.
Harry shrugs, unsure what emotion he’s feeling, much less the one he’s trying to fake. “It wasn’t a surprise.”
Despite Blaise’s diagnosis, he and Greg still brought Draco up a muffin and cup of tea from the Great Hall instead of dragging him down to breakfast.
Connie’s eyes narrow, and Harry identifies the experience as similar to being glared at by a gossipy version of Professor McGonagall. “You’re finally investigating my toad complaints? After years of being ignored by the Aurors, now you’ve come to reign justice upon Rob and his illegal toads?”
Harry, who stood on the opposite bank and was still learning to trust the forest, tried to make out the shapes across the pond. He couldn’t discern much but for the obvious trees, a few scattered rocks, and logs toppled over into the lake.
Harry felt enough words to spoil it on his lips, requests for Draco to tell him it was real, asking him to say it was anything more than it was, just a body and a sideways reconciliation. He reached up towards the back of Draco’s neck instead of saying any of them, pulling him down for another kiss.
Sometimes Harry worries that it was less the love potion and more of an excuse to not feel ashamed, just once.
“So are you,” he replied, schooling his face into impassivity, like he could bluff his way out.
“Because you’re a catastrophe at potions?”
The feeling bubbling in Harry’s chest like old lava doesn’t have a name but it feels like bile in his throat and he wants to throttle Draco before he can say any more horrible words. He’s lying but he saw everything, knows everything, knows things Harry wanted to forget, and Harry knows nothing about him, is only guessing in the dark.
“I’m hoping for a blue one this year, although that purple snitch one from last year was truly fantastic,” Harry says, thinking fondly of the chunky, scratchy, purple creation. He has to wear a button up underneath it, but it’s the warmest thing in his wardrobe.
“Would you like to come in?”
“Can it be? Is my horrible and disorderly partner about to do the paperwork that has gone so neglected since he got a new boyfriend?” she asks, perching on the edge of his desk and immediately knocking over his quill holder. She begins the task of setting it back to rights, sending a pile of papers onto the floor in the process.
Draco closed her eyes, placing a hand gently on the windowsill. “I just want to get this dancing thing over with.”
Then there’s Harry stealing up him with nerves so loud they nearly drown out everything else, telling him about the first task in a voice so low Cedric has to lean in close to hear it. It’s intimate, a secret, and finds himself grinning into Cedric’s face, feeling vile in retrospect. The Yule Ball swirls by, Harry watching Cho and Cedric twirl on the dance floor like old lovers with a searing jealousy that he can’t figure out the source of. At the time he hadn’t questioned it and he feels like burying himself under the floorboards, like pulling the whole year in a pensieve and never looking at it again.
“Yeah,” Harry, sitting up straight and gathering all of his courage together. “Aren’t you?”
Draco had a vision of sleeping beauty, of leaning down and pressing his lips to Harry’s and the beat after he kissed him awake before the whole moment would shatter. He felt it intensely, was almost aware of the sensation of Harry’s lips on his, and clutched Harry’s hand tight in a moment of panic and unease because he wanted it.
The electric orange of the shock blanket covers most of the familiar lankiness of Draco’s body, only his head and shoulders and a delicate hand visible. He looks unearthly, pretty, like flowers at night, Harry thinks, and then subsequently wonders if he should just leave Draco under the shock blanket and bolt if he’s going to be thinking thoughts like that.
As he waded, the water came up to his waist, small brightly colored fish swishing around his feet. He’d nearly given up on finding anything in the maze of mangroves when he saw a periwinkle light glowing up ahead.
“Fair,” Parvati said. “I heard you asked Anthony?”
“Is it alive?” Draco asked, tentatively reaching out to touch it and then jumping back when it swung.
“So I see, very provocative,” Draco said, apparently playing along for once. She turned to Harry, leaving Ron to try and untangle Ginny from her yarn prison. “And what exactly are you working on?”
He touches down just as the streets are starting to fill with witches and wizards on their way to work. His hair is swept in all directions and his body is finally starting to ache after the sting, the scratches and burns on his skin growing irritated. He rings Draco’s apartment twice before the charm projects Draco’s clipped voice out into the street. “Who is calling at this hour?”
“Are you saying you don’t want to be my friend?” Harry asked, and then blundered on before Draco could answer. “Because last time I asked if you wanted me to leave you alone, you couldn’t answer me, and I want to be your friend. Fuck it, I said it. I want to be your stupid fucking friend. Because I think you’re funny sometimes and you are a good dancer and I don’t want to hate you anymore. It’s stupid. Our baggage is stupid.”
“This is so strange,” Draco said, giving Harry that little smile again.
“I know,” Harry said, letting his voice become muffled by the blankets. “Do you ever think I’m going to be normal again?” Everything worked in layers, he peeled the first one back.
“Kiss me back,” Draco hissed, tugging Harry closer, giving Harry just enough time to pull his glasses off during the next reprimand. “Surprised? And you were so sure you knew everything.”
Draco nodded, hiccuping quietly. “Means it’s really winter.”
57. Harry wants to ask Draco if he’s getting warmer or cooler. They could play twenty questions. Do you think you’re going to die? Do you think you’re going to die in a month? Do you think you’re going to die in a week? Do you think it’s worth it? Do you think I’m worth it? How much would you have to love me to give it up? Sorry, I know that’s not a yes or no question.
“That’s how it feels now,” Draco said, before dropping her hand and looking back out the window, only the flush on her cheeks and the strange feeling on Harry’s lips any indication that she’d moved at all.
“Yeah,” Harry says, all of his words catching and failing. Harry hasn’t seen Malfoy in the years since the trials and he doesn’t look all that different, maybe less emaciated, maybe a little older behind the eyes. He glances down at his arm, at the faded outline of the Mark and tries not to grimace, although he knows Malfoy notices the movement.
“Harry and I visited St. Mungo’s together a few weeks ago to talk to some of the children there,” Draco says, his accent as posh as it was back at school. Harry notices that he’s sitting up straight and tries to fix his own posture, feeling like an idiot even as he does. “He does a lot of good work.”
“Of course,” Draco says, lingering next to the fireplace. Harry realizes that Draco isn’t sure where he should sit, and is going to hover there until Harry properly invites him in. It’s somewhat of a relief, really, that Draco is just as much of an idiot as he is. This has been a surprise, but one of those that feels like he should have known it much sooner, really.
“She told me her favorite color,” Harry said, trying to shake off the fog of bemusement without success. “I think she is spectacularly drunk.”
“Something like that,” the snake said, bobbing its head. “Why don’t you try and wake him up?”
The Slytherin - Ravenclaw match, which ended with a quite impressive snitch catch by Draco Malfoy herself, resulted in a Slytherin Common Room party that somehow, in the fray, everyone was invited to.
Draco briefly considers pretending that he’s never kissed a boy and would like to do some personal research re: Harry Potter’s mouth, but Pansy knows far, far too much about his gay awakening for him to ever get away with it. It had been one rather exciting month around the time Durmstrang visited Hogwarts, where he, by hook or by crook, had managed to enchant three separate Ukrainian boys. They were good boys. They still send him very, very strong booze and invite him to go skiing sometimes.
“Where’d that come from?” Harry asked, still looking at him in that way that felt so important.
“I think that what you do is much more important than being a fucking auror,” Draco replies. “But whatever.”
“Are we eavesdropping or dancing?” Anthony asked mildly, as Harry had essentially pulled them to a stop so she could listen.
Draco nods stiffly, letting Harry grab him and keep him close, apparating to just outside the hospital. They stumble away from each other, their proximity making nerves crawl up Harry’s spine. Draco is warmth and soft cotton and he smells like mint and spice and he tries not to attach intimacy to the moment. He leads Draco inside, realizing belatedly that he doesn’t have any idea about whether or not he’s actually to be trusted.
Harry walks up behind him, whispering a quick hey before taking both of his hands and resting his head on Draco’s shoulder.
Draco stills beside him, quiet for a long moment before Harry feels a hand rest on top of his. Draco only lets it hover there for a few moments, snatching it back like he’s terrified.
She nods slowly, processing. He knows they never gave her credit for how smart she was, something in her lightness making everyone underestimate her. “Was he a Gryffindor?”
“I didn’t want her in mine either,” Draco says, recalcitrant. “It’s a good motivator isn’t it? Blind fear?”
“Holy shit.”
Harry blinked over at her, deciding that arguing was futile. “I was just seeing what he was up to,” he offered, hoping that was something close to an adequate excuse.
“I guess we both were,” Draco replies. “Which is pretty fucked up, considering.”
“I don’t think Anthony was doing the box thing,” Harry says uncertainly, nearly stumbling over her feet when she tried to talk.
"Fuck," she whispered, her words hung heavy in the air. Her bedroom did not respond. Glancing at the time again, she came to a decision. Mentally berating herself and apologizing to her loved ones, she swung the sheets off of her and moved to stand.
he grin won out and Ron turned his head to whisper back,"I think we're her problem."
She kept her eyes on him, waiting for him to turn back to face her and say something else. He didn’t, just packed up his things for the day and was clearly getting ready to leave. Harry couldn’t quite place why that hurt. She turned back to her report, ignoring the shame pooling in her chest. She didn’t look up as Ron began to walk past her.
“You’re late for work.” Pansy said. She sat up slightly and reached out to grab Draco’s hand in hers with a small squeeze. A way of saying

She can’t make up some other stupid excuse for how tired she was if Rodger confirmed she was here. She really needs to stop admitting things to him before she has coffee.
me? returning to project onto Draco Malfoy? more likely then you think
They were both sitting up straight now. Ron either didn’t hear or ignored her protests. Despite how joking and cheerful he had been seconds earlier, he looked as tired as she felt.
“I-...what?” He had stopped almost directly behind her chair and she had to twist all the way around to face him. Ron seemed to have anticipated her confusion because before she had even responded he said, “Hermione isn’t gonna be home till tomorrow, and if she finds out I let you get away with barley eating all day she’d kill me. I was thinkin’ that one Ethiopian place?”
If she was already crying by the time she landed in her living room, no one was there to know.
"Wait, Draco-!"
(See the end of the chapter for
"You’re a healer, aren't you
When she didn’t get a response, Draco continued, her voice getting more scratchy and shaky with each word. She couldn’t control herself.
things are going great, ignoring the multiple breakdowns happening concurrently
“Harriet Potter, the youngest Hogwarts seeker in a century everybody.” Ron looked like he was trying not to laugh as he spoke, louder than normal and in a poorly done American accent. She scoffed at him. Their desks, while side by side, were practically on top of each other, with only a half a foot between the ends of them at most. Picking up the paper, she aimed for his head and tossed it.
"Right so-" She turned suddenly and now he was desperately dodging staff. Sharp was either weaving easily through the crowded and narrow hall or they were moving out of her way. Ron was not given such treatment. He nearly knocked over a wizard carrying a tray with a fizzy looking potion on it.
Harry, with one leg thrown over the armrest, the other folded beneath her and half slumped over, looked appalled. "I could say the same to you!" She sat up slightly more as she spoke but made no move to change anything else.
Sure enough, mere seconds later, her fireplace burst into life. Pansy emerged from the flames with the same air of confidence as a hunter finally catching its prey. Despite her supposed-to-be-comforting mind-healer robes, she looked murderous. Pansy rolled up the sleeves of her robes before crossing to stand directly opposite where Draco was slouched on the couch with her arms crossed angrily.
(His footsteps sounded like Potter's. Draco was wearing her Slytherin uniform. Why hadn't Snape come to save her yet?)
As tempting as it was to wither under the stares of her coworkers, she held her head high as she made her way to her office. She was just as tempted to just pull out her flask right there and let the familiar warmth of vodka take away her discomfort, but she managed to force herself to wait until she was alone. Now that everyone knew of her “different” status, she didn’t need to give anyone another reason to try and get her fired.
"I used a dueling spell on it."
“It's the curse of being in a happy marriage, you slowly morph into one being. Pretty soon you’ll have one best friend with two bodies.” Harry snorted as the two of them headed towards where it was safe to apparate.
Harriet rushed forward and threw her arms around Draco, having to stand on her tiptoes to reach Draco’s shoulder.
She turned back to them then, a
When Draco was young, her mother would put her to bed with a reminder. It never changed from night to night, always a whispered bit of advice into her ear. It was a survival tactic, a habit, a coping mechanism. She would lose her mind if she had to spend another day throwing a pity party. She’d take any work she could get her hands on at this point, any source of normalcy she could steal. If she closed her eyes she could feel her mother’s cold breath against her ear,
"Yeah," she chuckles awkwardly, "yeah okay." Harriet raises an eyebrow at her, a smirk dancing across her face. "Okay, yeah." She says it like a taunt, it's supposed to be a taunt.
“Thanks.” she practically whispered to Ron. Thank Merlin that day was not today. He tilted his head in a form of acknowledgement as he waved his wand across his desk, sending his stack of papers to their respective files.
Her startled shout made Draco's ears ring, Narcissa's whole body flinched violently.
She was setting herself up for disappointment and she knew it. It's how it always goes. Still, until tomorrow night comes, she can keep pretending.
Harry chuckled at that, then immediately shaped her hands over her mouth to silence it. As she did she waved her wand towards the witch and said a spell under her breath, clearly fighting not to laugh while doing so.
She opted not to try and hide the flask. “My job, of course.” She replied. Evie scowled at her, her glare moving from Draco’s face to the flask and back again. There was a quiet thump as a new patient file magically landed on her desk and she gestured to it. A way of saying,
“I really don’t want to talk about it, Ron.” She was more awake then she’s been all day now. A flame was unfolding in her chest, and all she could do was sit and hope the embers would simmer and die.
"I thought you were your father." Her mother was nearly breathless, her surprise choking her words. She breathed deeply, hand pressed to her chest.The words clearly slipped out unintentionally, blurting out before she could think. It still made Draco’s stomach drop so fast it was sickening. Narcissa's face paled a few seconds after, catching up with herself.
Ron glanced at the paper on Harry’s desk before meeting her gaze. She knew what was coming. Ron had tried to bring up the “problem” all day but said nothing when Harry would quickly change topics. He had opted not to push, probably knowing it wouldn’t help matters. She figured it would come up sooner or later.
Harry had set herself up for failure by going to bed a handful of hours early the previous night, because now she couldn't sleep
Ron didn’t respond, just tossed the paper back at her. It managed to hit her right in the middle of her forehead.
("Your hair is so much less- it's texture is so different from mine. I've been cutting my hair since I was a kid, Aunt Petunia refused to take me to get one. The first spell I wanted to learn was one for haircuts once I got to Hogwarts.")
She had stopped casting spells over Draco’s head, simply running her fingers through it. Checking for something, Draco guessed. The length or layers or whatever. Draco only knew how to style her hair, she couldn't be expected to understand the specifics of what Harriet was doing.
evie sharp is also not paid enough for this shit
She couldn’t make sense of herself, but she was trying to explain it anyway. "...please." She finished weakly.
There had been a grand total of one person at St. Mungos who had known her story prior to yesterday, excluding herself and Pansy. The witch who was her boss, the reason she became a healer in the first place,  and who let her get away with a ridiculous amount of bullshit to keep her situation underwraps, Evie Sharp.
“Yes it was. Now go home. You’re taking the day off.”
Her shift at St. Mungo’s started in less than ten minutes, yet Draco was sitting on her couch reminiscing and regretting with a glass of firewhisky almost empty in her grasp. Pansy was bound to come hunt her down any second, she was a stickler for punctuality. Draco normally arrives at least an hour before she's actually supposed to be there, a fact that Pansy was
She grabbed her bag and haphazardly shoved her things into it. “You’re starting to sound like Hermione.” she said as she did so.
“You’ve been avoiding this all day Harry. I can’t just...not bring it up.” Ron wheeled his chair closer to her. There weren’t many other Aurors at their desks that were near them, but even so his voice was low and soft. He knew she hated things like this. Harry looked away from him and crossed her arms over her chest defensively.
Really I am.”
hung in the air between them.
"Next time you need a haircut, I'd prefer it if it wasn't in the middle of the night, but I'd be happy to do it again." Harriet murmurs sleepily into her steaming mug. She yawns with her whole body, stretching out like a cat. Draco almost had a heart attack as she tips her mug slightly in her hand.
"Just because yo-!" Harry started, but cut herself off when the Welcome Witch cleared her throat loudly and glared at them.
kicked in. I was starting to worry I made it wrong."
Ron let out a breathy laugh. Another healer walked by and he straightened up again, but they kept walking. He could feel Harry looking at him and knew she had judgmental laughter in her gaze. He turned back to look at her and was just about to comment 'How long could it possibly take to get one healer' when another staff member walked by. This time though, they headed straight for Ron and Harry.
The world seemed determined to force Harry through her sleep deprivation problem. Running on barely two hours of sleep wasn’t ideal for her, even less so when she and Ron have an active day of field work. Chasing after a perp felt more taxing when she had to fight to keep her eyes open seconds before. Despite the odds being stacked against her she managed to stay mostly awake for the entire day, excluding the nap she took during her lunch break instead of eating. Ron offered help by talking when it looked like she was nodding off.
She nodded.
“Come off it, I haven’t played a proper game in years. And seeking has nothing to do with this.” The paper landed on his desk.
It was a losing battle, Draco knew it was. “Shouldn’t you want me to be at work? Seeing as you’re my supervisor and all.” There was another thump as more files landed on her desk.

Harry sat in his bed, continuing to rest his back against the headboard for what seemed like hours. He absent-mindedly chewed on his nails until he reached the pink nubs of his fingertips. Hermione would kill him if she caught him doing this.

demand set within her clenched jaw.
“Busy day today?”
Harry had glared stubbornly back at the house elf, who once again was examining the mess. Harry waved his wand, muttering quick efficient cleaning charms that sent the clothes flying back into their original places. The clutter of noise as the drawers and wardrobe doors closed themselves once they were full again echoed within the spacious room. Once everything was returned to its space, Harry returned his wand once again to his back pocket and crossed his arms across his chest.
*************
Harry shook his head once more and stood up to his feet. “No, none of that today.”
“Either way” Ginny spoke over Harry. “Draco talked about you all the time. You know, squeezing it into conversation when Blaise met him for lunch or whatever. But this past week, Blaise says Draco has rarely left his ward. He’s quiet and irritable and doesn’t mention you at all.” Ginny laughed before suddenly turning to look at Harry with an exaggeratedly serious expression. “He stabbed the lettuce leaf of his salad eight times Harry during his lunch with Blaise on Tuesday…”
They had reached the fountain and Ginny sat down on the iron bench in front of it. She took a sip of her drink and temporarily looked lost in thought as she stared into the water. Harry clenched his jaw and sat next to her, taking another sip.
The time was 7:57pm and Harry was stood at the gates of Malfoy Manner. He began to walk up the path towards the looming house, which was painted a soft eggshell white these days; it was a lot more welcoming than it once was.
“Eliza if you keep fluffing that pillow, I’ll need to treat Potter for an enlarged ego as well, which is already at an obnoxious size. I don’t have all day.” Drawled a posh, sharp tone from the doorway of the room, commanding its attention. Harry’s eyes immediately snapped away from the medi-nurse, who was rolling her eyes playfully as he felt a heat prickle across the tips of his ears.
Harry felt his muscles relax under her touch and scoffed playfully turning to look at her. “If I was on fire and Malfoy had a glass of water, he would drink it.”
Hot tears threatened to cloud Harry’s vision as he gritted his teeth harder.
The clipped tone of Draco’s tone brought a soft smile to Harry’s lips. Harry pulled Draco in a little tighter towards him
Harry’s mind was racing so fast he couldn’t consciously keep up with his thoughts. “You’re an island. You’re an island with a lighthouse. And you make really nice chocolate. Don’t leave me again, I need this, I need you.”
He waited for nothing, and nothing arrived.
Because of this, Harry was sitting on the edge of a hospital bed on the 4
Here you guys are!! I'm so sorry for the delay between uploading, my first exam is in less than a week so it's been hard trying to balance my time - I made this chapter a little longer to make up for it though so hope you all forgive me <3333
“Oh yeah? Is your Healer nice?”
Harry was too aroused to think. His prick shifted against his thigh. Blood gushed to Harry’s groin with such force that the resulting erection bordered on painful.
Coming from the
Please feel free to leave comments, your feedback means a lot to me! I really want to know your opinion of the story so far
and couldn’t help but imagine that Sirius was skipping joyfully along with them in spirit.
This story is no where near done yet, I'm having wayyy to much fun ;)
Harry felt the material of the gown flop limply to his waist, exposing his chest. “Malfoy your clock is broken.”
? In hindsight, he should have questioned the young Healer about what injury this patient had, but he was just too fucking angry to even string two coherent thoughts together.
Harry could hear Eliza’s smile within her voice, but this only made his heart sink lower within his chest cavity. “Delightful.”
Much to Hermione’s adoration, Harry had chosen to bury decorative heads of the House Elves in the back corner of his garden. Harry was not a man of faith, but at the time of the burial it had felt appropriate to cast a purity charm on the ground that they were buried under; wishing to grant them respect and thanks for the servitude. A simple, white stone lay above their resting ground, and Harry wished more than anything sometimes that Dobby lay under it too.
“You should have seen the look of horror on his face Gin when he realised I was hard. He couldn’t leave the room fast enough.”
of the wizarding world himself. You are so full of shit Potter, the toilet is jealous. Do me a favour and jump from the roof.”
Harry shot up his eyebrows, letting out a single dry laugh. “Are you saying I need it? I look that bad do I?”
The quill snapped.
“How did you know that I had left?”
Harry groaned as he felt Malfoy’s teeth against his neck, biting on a tendon, just below where his hands were. Harry bucked his hips and felt Draco’s erection strain against his own. Draco hissed and moved his hands to tangle his fingers within Harry’s hair. Harry continued to rock his hips against Draco’s, loving the burning white pleasure that spread throughout his body. Draco whined and pushed back against Harry, frotting against him senselessly. Harry gripped Malfoy’s hips hard and moved Draco’s hips back and forth to control his rhythm. Harry was completely overwhelmed by pleasure. His mouth was agape slightly he felt soft lips move eagerly against his own, and he moaned into Malfoy’s mouth as he kissed back. “F-Fuck I’m close I’m gonna-“
Harry cleared his throat. “What is it?”
Ginny’s giggles began to die down as she looked at Harry again. She watched Harry laugh fondly, a gleam sitting within her eye. “Draco has lost the plot Hazza. You’ve scrambled his brain like a bowl of eggs.”
It had been ten minutes after Hermione left when his floo activated. Harry was led on the sofa, with the taste of liquorice still on his tongue from the pain relief tonic Hermione had made him drink, when the green flames roared.
Harry sighed and shook his head playfully. “He came with the house. Honestly, just consider him part of the furniture.” Harry turned his head to look over his shoulder and felt his stomach fizzle in shock. Malfoy had approached Harry and was now stood right behind him. The breath in Harry’s chest hitched violently as he took this moment to evaluate Malfoy up close. The Healer was slightly taller than himself, about an inch or so. Flecks of celeste blue were scattered amongst those light grey eyes, and there was not a single freckle or blemish to be found across his marble skin. The sides of his hair were cut fashionably short whilst remaining long on the top, allowing for soft blonde waves to roll onto his forehead. Malfoy’s once pointed features still looked sharp, but handsomely so.
Harry stared at the man, who acted like he had not even noticed that Harry had entered the room. “Where are your robes?”
12 Grimmauld Palace had become a place that Harry had made his own. Gone were the ghostly relics of the past that haunted the headquarters for the Order, and in its place stood an open and light living space. The familiar troll leg umbrella stand was the first thing that Harry had incinerated, along with the old dark wood furniture tainted with the scars of dark magic. In the Summer following the war, Harry had thrown a bonfire party with his closest family and friends. The late summer breeze rustled through the trees and intermingled with the sound of over layered conversations and laughter, as the wood of the bonfire crackled. Harry fondly remembered Ron throwing the screaming portrait of Walburga Black into the fire. As the portrait burned, Harry raised his beer bottle to the sky as a silent
Harry swallowed before opening his mouth and hesitantly sticking out his tongue. Malfoy came and knelt before Harry on the floor. Harry adjusted his position slightly, staying with his body weight resting on his elbows. Malfoy was so close to Harry that they must have been sharing the same breath. Harry felt a heat spread across his skin so intensely that he closed his eyes. A soft pant escaped his lips as the heat spread to his crotch. There was nothing that Harry wanted more than for the blonde to close the remaining painful distance between them and suck on his tongue with such force that his cheeks would hollow. Harry’s breath hitched at the dirty image in his mind.
Malfoy nodded, as if accepting Harry’s answer. Harry watched how Malfoy lifted his back from the wall and stepped closer towards Harry. Harry watched this man with caution, feeling a chill settle in beneath his bones from his excessive sweating. Malfoy slowly placed the back of his hand against Harry’s forehead. Harry felt the hard bumps of his knuckles against his skin. After a moment Malfoy lifted his hand from Harry’s forehead, and cupped Harry’s cheeks within his palms. The rays of sun from the window shone behind Malfoy and illuminated his frame. He looked ethereal.
“It sounds like he was flustered and lost control.”
Harry pushed him again. Hard. Malfoy audibly growled as he yanked Harry violently towards him. “
“Hm?”
Stay safe <3
Harry’s heart pounded hard in his chest.
Harry looked instinctively down at himself.
Eliza laughed and her blue eyes twinkled under the ceiling light. “Home treatment is considered quite a privilege. You get the undivided attention of Healers and Medi-Nurses in the comfort of your own home.
“I made it.”
Harry wasn’t expecting anything in particular, but he still felt surprised to know Malfoy wore fashionable muggle clothing beneath his robes. A cable knitted jumper and tailored grey trousers to be precise. The rich darkness of Malfoy’s green jumper made his grey irises look like lighthouse beacons against a stormy sea. In that moment Harry was grateful for the loose fit of his pyjama bottoms. “I was a real git to you earlier. I’m sorry about that.”
Blaise walked over and placed a soft kiss on Ginny’s temple which made her smile. He stood on the opposite side of the table to Harry and gripped the two edges of the table of the small table in front of him as he leant forward. “If you want him Potter, you need to
“Yes yes,
When Draco left Harry for what was now the second time, he convinced himself that he had officially shattered anything that could have happened between the two of them and that would be the end of that.
Every evening Harry sat on the sofa in front of the fireplace and waited. He waited for things to make sense again. He waited for the dull thud in his chest to stop. He waited for a tall blonde git to waltz back into the room and make everything feel normal again.
is your healer?! As if your luck wasn’t already rotten enough.” Ron shuddered on the chair beside Harry’s bed.
Harry’s grin fell onto the house elf that was staring up at him expectantly. “Prepare a tea tray for my guest and I please, peppermint and Earl Grey if we have it.”
A fire roared in Malfoy’s eyes that Harry hadn’t seen in many,
Eliza shook her head and smiled, clearly touched by the pair. “There are anti-apparation wards in here to stop patients disappearing in the night. There’s an apparition point at the end of this corridor. Before we go however, I need to numb Harry’s injuries so he can walk the distance required. Is it okay if I touch you Harry?”
I’ve never seen him like that before if I’m honest. Normally he’s so calm and collected. But when I saw him…” She laughed to herself once more. “He definitely looked rattled.”
Today was different, however. Eliza had left after amusing Harry with her insistence that Luna Lovegood was correct in her theory of the existence of Wrackspurts. But come early afternoon, Malfoy was no-where to be seen.
Draco stared down at Harry, panting hard. He looked like a vulnerable stray animal that would bolt if Harry moved too quickly. Harry rubbed his thumbs in soft circles against Malfoy’s hips.
He knew the smell of that aftershave.
The eyes that bore into his chest snapped up to meet his own. Malfoy’s brow was furrowed in light confusion. “Pardon?”
Malfoy’s voice was deep and clear as he spoke. Harry’s erection throbbed as he felt Malfoy’s lips brush against his ear. “Bellatrix was a monster. She was also my mother’s sister, but she was no family of mine.
I hope you guys enjoyed this chapter! My last 2 exams are this week so please forgive me if its takes over a week for the next update! (Guess you'll just need to bookmark this story ;) )
means Faith. Its only logical that when translated to English his surname is
“Don’t forget what I told you Potter.”
********
“Close your eyes please.”
Harry turned his back towards Malfoy again, staring at the same previous spot on the white-washed wall. Harry began to pull his gown up towards his chest. He winced in pain as he reached his stomach, unable to lift his arms any higher. Electricity ran though Harry’s fingers as he felt Malfoy's hands gently overlap his, taking the gown from Harry’s hands. Malfoy lowered his head to rest his chin above Harry’s shoulder as he tied up the gown at the back of Harry’s neck.
“Okay I went a little bit too far, but you get the gist.”
Truth be told, Harry couldn’t sit still all afternoon. He had practically raced up the stairs into his bedroom and immediately began raiding his closet. Harry had theatrically plucked shirts, t-shirts and trousers from their hangers and from their drawers, throwing them back over his shoulder if he deemed them unsuitable.
The more feedback you give, the faster I write the next chapter, deal? ;)
Malfoy’s lips curled slightly at the corners, amused by Hermione’s question. He cleared his throat as he made his way further into the room, his eyes scanning over his other patients, making a quick mental note of their vitals. “Very observant Granger. I imagine Potter downplayed the severity of his injuries to you in a typical Griffindor manner. If Potter arrived in my care a couple of hours later than he did, septicaemia would have kicked in. His fever was already dangerous, and heart rate erratic. Treatment and bone regrowth would have been extremely challenging. We would have been looking at permanent damage in a best- case scenario.”
The butterflies in Harry’s stomach caused his insides to churn violently. He had tried his best tonight to look perfect for Draco. His long, usually unruly hair was tied back into a (mostly) neat knot at the top of his head, with shorter, soft curls loose at the front to frame his face. Harry had partnered his gifted emerald shirt with black, tight fitting trousers and dark brown loafers. He wore a small, gold hoop earring in his right earlobe, subtly visible behind his curly black tendrils. The coat he wore was a long black winter coat, lined on the inside with black silk – a gift from Hermione when he completed his Auror course.
“Master has made too much mess. Too much mess indeed.”
Btw the song that Ginny was playing in her kitchen was 'We Could Be' by Hunna (I really love this song, so give it a listen if you want)
Harry felt guilt plunge through his stomach like a stone into deep water, though he refused to back down. He took a deep breath, steadying himself. “If you think-“
Ginny’s face began to change colour, transitioning into a crimson purple.
“I wear glasses dipshit of course my eyes are dysfunctional.”
To make Harry wait until 8pm felt like asking him to wait an eternity. But hell, if that’s what the handsome pointy git asked for, Harry would have done it.
Harry’s heart sank to his stomach.
.” A short laugh erupted sharply.
“Good enough.” Malfoy had produced his wand out of the inside pocket of his green robes.
Draco scoffed playfully and rolled his eyes. “Then what’s wrong with you?”
Harry awoke with a start, panting heavily. His skin was shining from sweat. The first flickers of sunlight were coming into the room from the window, colouring the room in soft golden tones. Harry jolted from shock as he noticed the tall figure that stood beside his bed with their back against the wall.
Some classes with the Ravenclaws later, during lunch, he had to listen to Harry go on and on about some plan he thought Malfoy had and blah blah blah, again!!
“Uh, Harry, don’t you think you’re doing it again. Being obsessed with Malfoy, I mean. I know, the last time you had a real reason, but now—“
“Okay, Harry, think... think!!!” He yelled at himself in the mirror of the empty boy’s bathroom. He was not used to be the one to actually think of a plan, that normally was Hermione. But right now he was standing alone. What was he supposed to do? Where was he supposed to get a perfume?
As the game went on, Harry kept looking around, trying to find the Golden Snitch.
also, hope everything is okay, with the corona and the important movement of BLM.
Bloody hell how were his eyes still stinging? He wasn’t even crying, nor was he even sad or anything.
It was one of the kissing cams that Muggles used. This was going to be an interesting year.
Then Pomfrey told him he could leave as soon as he wanted and that's exactly what he did.
Harry was in a room. He wasn’t sure where, at first, but then something triggered his memory.
“Are you afraid, Potter?”
“Wha— where am I?”
“Y—you are horrible!”
“What are you going to give Hermione for her birthday, Ron?” To which he just smiled and said it was a surprise.
Harry looked at the Ravenclaws and smirked, ‘finally’, he thought, ‘a real game’.
They grabbed their brooms and waited for Pomfrey to leave the Wing to go to the window beside Harry's bed and cast spells that made his glasses fly around the room so he couldn't catch them and started laughing at his "awesome seeker skills".
But—of course— the floor has to be wet and Harry had to slip and land in the other boy’s arms.
He’d been so happy about the fact that he was going to play Quidditch after another painfully boring day. But now, he couldn’t even hear what his sister was saying, with so much thoughts about whether books were a good gift or not flying around his head.
But the main reason why he was alone was the fact that Harry was still in the Hospital Wing.
He read a few more from the Gryffindors and a couple from the Ravenclaws thanking him for the game and saying they’d win next time.
He sat up and looked around, noticing he was alone in bed, but hearing his roommates’ snores around the room.
Ron nodded, trying his best not to smirk proudly. “Well, if that perfume you’re hiding from me doesn’t work, I’m sure I can borrow some from Hermione for you.”
Parkinson had gotten up, along with her boyfriend, and they made their was to their table.
Ron, of course, was confused as to what was happening and that was probably what kept HIM distracted all week. The boy could NOT multitask, that’s for sure. Unfortunately, she was more concerned about whether or not she’d have to explain to him how IT worked between two guys, in case Harry and Malfoy did start going out. Maybe she would have to explain it to Harry as well.
Harry had already prepared a pot of peppermint tea which sat brewing on his living room table with a spare mug sat next to the pot. He sat on the edge of his sofa and grabbed his own mug of earl grey tea. He blew against the rim of the cup before taking a short sip. The mixture of bitterness and citrus mixed on his tongue, washing away the remnants of liquorice.
Draco’s platinum hair was styled fashionably. The sides and underneath were short, and the perfectly tussled hair on the top that waved softly across his forehead. He wore a sky-blue silk button up shirt, with the top 2 buttons undone to expose the beautiful alabaster skin of his neck and collarbone. Harry drank in the sight of Draco wearing coal grey trousers, that were deliciously fitted to his slender frame before his eyes rested on his black, dragonhide loafers.
“Oh my god you’ve got a big gay crush on the man and you did something stupid.” She muttered softly.
How long had these feelings been living within Harry? He had been obsessed with his childhood rival throughout his entire stay at Hogwarts. He knew so much about the git. He knew that Malfoy had a sweet tooth from the frequent parcels full of sweets that were sent to him by his parents. He knew that Malfoy’s skin developed a grey tint when he was nervous. He knew that Malfoy never blushed, instead his entire face would flush pink if he was embarrassed.
“Take care of yourself Harry.”
Draco raised an eyebrow at Harry’s sudden change in demeanour. Harry deduced from the upturned corners of his mouth, that Draco must be pleased. Draco took Harry’s arm, wrapping his hand around it, following Harry’s lead down the steps. If Harry didn’t know any better, he would have thought Draco’s tight grip, and the subtle movements of his hand meant that Draco was trying to feel Harry’s muscles under his clothes. If Harry’s gaze wasn’t tunnelled on the steps before him, so determined not to trip in front of Malfoy, perhaps Harry would have noticed that Draco was staring at Harry from the corner of his eye. His gaze was fixated, making his slow way down Harry’s body- starting from the hair, to the earring, to his lips, to the shirt...
“You’d think our saviour’s luck would have run out by now. Defeating the Darkest Wizard of our time would normally drain anybody of their lucky streak. But not
It had been a few hours since his initial check up with Malfoy. In that time Medi-Nurse Mayford, the short blonde referred to previously as
Harry furrowed his brow lightly in amused confusion. He shook his head letting out a breathy laugh. “Explains what?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sitting down and having tea with Malfoy allowed for a pleasant exchange of conversation. Harry had found out that this was Malfoy’s first year at being the head of his department, and how surprised Malfoy had been to be named his superior’s successor. From the stories Malfoy had told him about his most memorable cases, it did not surprise Harry one bit why he was chosen for the role. It is in Malfoy’s nature to be calculating and analytical, though Harry no longer saw these traits in the malicious light that he did in school. It allowed Malfoy to think first before he acted, which was crucial when people’s lives were hanging in the balance of his decisions. Throughout their talk Harry was also discovering that this man was charming, witty had the flair for the dramatics within his storytelling. Malfoy gestured a lot with his hands, and his eyebrows moved emotively as he talked.
“How do you know about Shakespeare?”
Harry smacked his head against the table and groaned. “Be a good friend and set me on fire.”
Malfoy swallowed and wetted his lips. Harry glared at the man in a way that he hoped was threatening. Perhaps the intended look would have worked if Harry’s eyes weren’t so wet and if his lip wasn’t trembling.
“I’m not playing a game.”
“And out please Potter.”
“Have you got peppermint?” Harry interpreted this as Malfoy trying to nonchalantly accept his offer. He couldn’t stop the bright grin forming on his face.
Harry felt the familiar cold metal press again his chest and the phantom ice burn that followed. His breath hitched in his throat as he stared at the base of Malfoy’s neck. He imagined the dip that lived in the gap between his collarbones, existing beneath his robes. Harry closed his eyes, unable to drink in another moment. It was too much.
Harry was sat up now, stretching out his hand trying to reach Malfoy. “No no no no Malfoy wait I can explain just-“
“Do I have something on my face?”
wrote on your chart that your fever was reaching dangerous levels. I ran another test and it’s slightly feverish, which is expected when a patient is taking healing potions, but no where near the temperature recorded here…”
Harry chuckled and bowed his head momentarily. As he raised it again, he met Malfoy’s eyes and instinctively chewed on his bottom lip. “Okay I admit, I just really wanted to talk to you.”

“Earlier today, Potter.” Malfoy’s spoke through slightly gritted teeth. To the normal eye, Harry surmised that Malfoy was the picture of composure and professionalism. Though it appeared Harry had been given a looking glass that allowed him to see beyond the illusion. Malfoy was nervous. He could tell by the flush that rested on the back of Malfoy’s neck, almost completely hidden by his jumper. His eyes were focused on the clipboard, but they were not moving, he was just staring at it.
“What?”
The next few days came and went in a blur. Eliza continued with her regular check-ups, providing Harry with countless small remedies and potions to heal his remaining rib fractures. During their moments together, she continually tried to engage Harry in several conversation topics such as: whether Harry believed magic to be a faction of art or science, why the sky seemed more blue a few days before a thunderstorm, and even why Eliza believed handmade cookies tasted better than those made with magic.
“You’re right Gin. I’ve got to fight, and I know exactly how.”
“No, you’ve made it very clear, thank you. Oh, and call me Hermione. Mrs Granger-Weasley makes me sound old.”
“Call him a bastard again, I dare you, ungrateful idiot! I bet it’s your fault he came here, crying, upset, sobbing some gibberish about losing the most important thing in the world, and how it was unfair that-“
Many other compliments were heard as he walked around the school.
And it is painting them all
______________________________________
Then Blaise started saying, “kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss,...” and everyone started to understand what was happening and did the same.
“Ron.” Hermione called, trying to calm her boyfriend down, with a reassuring hug and kiss in the cheek. “I’ve already explained this to Ginny.”
“What’s wrong, Potter? Did my lips not taste Gryffindor-ish enough?” he asked, seductively licking the blood from his bottom lip, making Harry forget about his prior concerns immediately, reaching up and kissing him again, pressing his legs tighter around his waist and moaning when his hand made its way down his body again.
“Your sh— oh, my Merlin, Ronald! You WANTED Harry to get pissed! That’s — uh—Now, if you don’t want ME to get pissed, you’ll get your ass out of here and you’re gonna comfort him!”
His eyes scanned a shinny bracelet, there was something familiar about it, yet he was sure he’d never seen it.
“Yes, very well spotted, now .... uh... look, you know you are a total idiot, right? Like, a complete oblivious idiot and—“

First, he made Hermione take care of their best friend so he could steal the Marauder’s Map.
What if he was meant to be alone for the rest of his life?
That seemed to shock his mistletoe-parter since he didn’t even make a disapproving sound or anything, only his eyes reacted by almost popping out of his skull.
Harry gritted his teeth and closed his eyes, taking his glasses off and stepping into the shower, closing the door right behind him.
Every pair of eyes —including the teachers’— were following the boy who lived as he left the Great Hall.
a fake.”
“Healer Malfoy, there’s a patient who requires treatment in Room 3.”
“Ron doubted your talent as a Healer Malfoy. ‘Mione defended you. Please don’t talk to her like that again.”
“It’s slow.”
Harry had practically skipped home from the hospital earlier that day. He must have looked like an idiot to the bystanders, who watched a grown man grin ear to ear as he made his way through the bustling London streets towards Grimmauld Place.
This story is FAR from over, so don't you panic, take care my loves <3
Harry licked his lips as he felt a draft of cold air brush against his nipples.
I'm very excited for the next few chapters (prepare yourselves ;) )
“Kreacher, send a thank you note to Mr. Zabini, and a new bottle of that poncy aftershave he loves so much.”

Harry rolled his eyes and bit the inside of his cheek.
“I-I mean I can do the treatment, but they specifically asked for you.”
“Draco hasn’t talked to Blaise about you… But that’s kinda the point.”
“Your mind went dark, didn’t it?” The softness of Draco’s tone took Harry by surprise, and his eyes immediately darted towards the man. He watched as Draco fidgeted with his fingers and chewed on the inside of his cheek.
“I’ve had a really long,
That vulnerable side, that was Draco. The boy who cried helplessly as he pointed his wand at Dumbledore’s chest on top of the Astronomy tower. Draco was the ticking time bomb that stood waiting for Harry in his living room. Draco was the one that shook with fear after realising what he and Harry had done on the sofa. It was Draco that fled last night when Harry gave him a chance to.
The Jr. Healer recoiled at Draco’s snappish tone and nodded feverishly. “Understood completely Healer Malfoy.”
A few more chuckles escaped from the witch. “I’m done… Okay now I’m done…”
Malfoy hates him.
Tadaaa!! Finally a happy chapter ahaha
“Judging by your inventory I take it Granger already gave you a tonic?”

Harry let out a relieved breath that he wasn’t aware he was holding. “Wait ‘till Ron hears I’m back on the case with him, he’s gonna be so-“
Harry’s face broke into a playful grin, and felt his sexual tension disintegrate. “Well, the gene pool for purebloods is very shallow. Ron is basically your cousin. Would you spend Christmas at The Burrow with all your extended family Malfoy?.” The laughter erupted from Harry harder as Malfoy’s skin grew impossibly paler. It was when Malfoy’s mouth hung open to speak that Harry’s laughter began to die down, and his gaze lowered to the man’s dusty pink lips.
“Yeah.”
The headache behind Harry’s eyes grew as he stepped back into his living room. Everything was how he had left it. The soft smell of cinnamon filled his lungs as he took a deep breath to centre himself again.
Harry adjusted his position on the sofa slightly, turning his head every couple of seconds to the clock on his wall. It was approaching 2pm, and Harry’s ribs were beginning to feel tight. He winced lightly as he sat himself up and made his way towards the armchair next to the fireplace that his hospital bag was sat in. He opened the bag and took out a pain-relieving tonic, secretly loving the feeling of the cold glass against his clammy palm. Harry was sweating lightly as he felt the skelegrow piece together shards of bone like a complicated jigsaw.
“I’m okay ‘Mione.  I suffered worse injuries in school from Quidditch remember? It’s not really that bad.”
“You better have shut the fridge door.”
This was the first time Harry had seen Malfoy since he testified at his trial following the war. He remembered his sigh of relief as Draco was acquitted of all charges, and the clench of his stomach when Lucius Malfoy had not been so lucky.
Why did Malfoy of all people have this effect on him? It didn’t seem fair. Harry’s attraction to men was no secret, but he still felt betrayed by his own body’s reaction to the blonde git.
would rather snog Voldemort than give his only son a hug.”
“Stick out your tongue.”
“Potter wake up.”
“Don’t go.”
Harry coughed and spluttered. “Pardon?”
“You daydream a lot. You were just staring at the table, but your eyes were foggy.”
Harry thought again of the lonely island lost at sea. He thought of the lighthouse and found himself encased within its light.
“Sit down Gin and I’ll tell you everything. Just don’t drop your-“
I know I'm teasing you with this chapter, but the next chapter is already in the works so keep an eye out ;)
“He isn’t different, Eliza. Draco has always been this way.”
“Yes, I can smell that.”
Harry felt a heat rise into his cheeks.

Harry jerked back in his seat softly as his mind entered the present.
The rosy tint darkened across Draco’s high cheekbones and the bridge of his nose. Draco’s stormy gaze looked everywhere but Harry’s eyes as he mumbled his response. “It’s autumn. Autumn’s cold. Apparate already. Please.”
“If you keep staring at me like that I’ll leave.”
“Frequent fever spells during the night, however still substantially lower than during your stay in the hospital...”
Malfoy immediately recoiled and Harry watched as the shutters closed behind Malfoy’s eyes.

It had felt amazing to see life behind Draco’s eyes again. The last time Harry had seen that flame in his eyes was during Hogwarts, when Harry had raced Draco to grab the snitch. He would never forget the determined focus on Malfoy’s face as his fingers reached forward to grab the flying golden ball. The way his hair was thoroughly windswept, and the way the cold air tainted his cheekbones pink. Truth be told, during 6

Malfoy wetted his lips and cleared his throat. “Turn.”
“Family is complicated.”
“Harry… Do you want this? Do you want something with him?”
So Harry ran as fast as he could to the place where he knew Neville would be helping Sprout with herbology— and found him petting some weird looking purple plant.
_______________
“We’re here!” he shouted as soon as he saw the big painting of the fruit bowl.
“No- I-I, uh..”
Honestly, how bad does someone need to be for their two egotistical best friends to get worried?
When they were ready and outside, Ginny, the captain, called them for a little encouragement talk before they began.
When the tension thickened as none of them spoke another word, though the still bright red in Draco’s cheeks pleased Harry so much he smiled a little, receiving an odd look back.
He fixated on the hand the blond lifted to adjust a hair that had fallen out of place.
Malfoy’s face was stuck in a weird facial expression—as if he were in pain— and he was red from the top of his head to his neck—which made Harry wonder how fat the blush would go.
He was starting to feel pissed and he knew— from old experiences— that when he got pissed his magic always got out of control.
“Luna!” he yelled, and a few kids- probably third years who just found out there are dirty wizard magazines under the sink of Moaning Mirtle’s bathroom- ran upstairs looking bloody scared.
______________
Harry’s insides were screaming when he approached her — without his invisibility cloak — because he didn’t know how to explain that he needed the best perfume a person could have just to impress his enemy.
Ron sees in Harry’s eyes what he is thinking about:
The only thing she asked in exchange of this little favour was a dance with her boyfriend. She needed to tell him something very important.
“What is it?”
The book had more than A-BLOODY-THOUSAND words and had NO IMAGES!
The solution for a problem like this would be to think in a smart solution; the smartest person Harry knew had to be Hermione; so, in his place, What Would Hermione Do?
He now regretted almost killing the blond, they were at war, after all, no one really wins without scars.
“I know, right?” Said Ron, who was grinning from ear to ear.
Fucking Draco Malfoy, with his fucking, little, pale, pointy, perfect nose with which he sneers and with which he also smells people and then tells them they stink.
After Quidditch practice, which Harry missed too, Ron and Hermione were in the Gryffindor common room.
An hesitant nod as the answer was all Harry received.
Of course this bastard of a riddle had to appear and remind him that, besides being in a hurry, he was not Hermione bloody Granger!! Morgana, did he want to hide his head in a hole somewhere.
“Alright, then”, the blond evilly smirked—and, oh, how it turned him on even more, specially with the was his pupils dilated, leaving only pools of black looking straight at him— raising a perfectly shaped eyebrow.
They sat there a few feet apart for a long time.
Another person entering the room made him stop mid-sentence. Hermione approached them, sat beside Ron and grinned widely while holding two letters for them to read.
Another step closer.
He kept questioning himself whether or not he should do this.
“Where’s Zabini?” They turned the corner to go to their back up place.
“Do you remember our bet after your third year when—“
He reached for the pear and tickled it, opening the door. Not even glancing back at Draco, to check how surprised he was after discovering the location of the kitchen, he entered and asked for a tea.
He tried to convince himself that they were just going to torment some first years or something, but that kept walking until they were standing right behind Ron, both sneering in displeasure.
“Wait!” Hermione said “I read in Hogwarts: a History that muggle technology doesn’t work here.”
Of course he had to blush AT A MOMENT LIKE THIS! Control yourself, idiot! Now you must make a bloody damn move; you could’ve done more than kiss him at this point, dear Merlin.
“Oh, fuck it” Malfoy whispered against Harry’s lips—making a shiver go down his spine while his lips tingled with anticipation.
So this is what it felt like… he really didn’t understand what all the fuss was about, it was good, but he probably would have to wank after this to be able to cum.
They looked into each other’s eyes, and the awkward moment became a cheesy one. One of those moments when both of them realize they would rather stay here forever, memorizing each other’s faces, than letting go.
During the first week after the Headmistress’s announcement, everyone was too curious for their own good.
She sat down at the Gryffindor table, next to Ginny and in front of Harry and Ron, who was ignoring her for what happened in the train.
He was really going nuts, he knew he was, so he started hitting his own head against the wall.

“Then let’s do it,” he said as they arrived, “did you bring everything?”
Oh, how Ron would love to spend hours dancing with Hermione and everyone looking at him while he wore Percy’s old suit that he had worn at Bill’s wedding along with his first interview at the Ministry.
Malfoy held his nose high, looking down at Harry and shot back, “you stink, Potter”, before storming into an almost empty Great Hall.
“Bloody hell, bloody hell, bloody HELL!”
Ginny jumped and Ron looked up, both blushing; with that look Teddy makes when someone catches him stealing a cookie in their faces.
His knuckles knocked on the door at least five times with full strength until someone opened it. He passed them, without even looking to see who it was, when a hand grabbed his shoulder and pressed his back against a wall.
Ron looked at her with a raised eyebrow, but it was quickly changed to a pleased and exited expression.
Now he only had to wait patiently until dinner time.
“Off you go, now!”Ginny yelled after McGonagall had had a private word with her. “In five minutes the Ravenclaws will be here for their own practice! I’ll see you all tomorrow here by noon, since neither of you have classes in the evening. I’ll announce who stays and who goes in which position.” She clapped her hands and everyone parted their ways.
But Ron got that look across his face that meant he had had an idea, so Hermione stopped mid sentence to hear his plan and to try to find a solution to prevent their death or expulsion.
He was ready. He hoped.
“Yes, this is actually not the first time someone has ended up here for the same reasons. Usually only muggle-borns are affected, but half-bloods are affected as well.  That's pretty much the only advantages of being a pure blood,
He shook his head out of his thoughts and did as she asked. Mounting his broom and flying to the goalposts.
The Slytherin struggled against him, freeing himself from Harry’s grasp and sending him the deadliest of glares, before saying, “your insults stink, just like you, Potter!” And leaving the raven haired boy with his green eyes wide open.
As he walked past a group of Ravenclaws chatting with Gryffindors, probably third years or something, he ran his hands through his hair to make the smell fly around the corridor and tried his best to contain his laugh as he heard their comments.
He sat there, in a chair they pulled for him, shaking and leaning back and forth, looking at the big clock on the wall above his head, sipping the once again full cup of tea and biting his nails.
Oh, who was he kidding? He better just go to bed and rest his messed up head.
The Elves were kind enough to give him what he asked for, but it helped as much as a blanket would help a person in the summer.
I’m already working on the next chapter. Sorry for taking so damn long. I was grounded and now with school starting and all. I know my excuses are shitty and all but fuck if I like writing for you. And damn do I love reading your  comments! 💚🖤💚💚🖤
“POTTER!”
“A What?!” He asked, gripping his broom tightly with the same strength he would use to strangle them.
However, there was nothing he could do now. He was already in Hogsmead and he’d have to be quick.
It had to be something a lot more complicated.
At dinner that day, Harry was so focused on discovering what Malfoy wanted, or what he was plotting against the trio, that he didn’t eat a thing.
“But—wait—what?” The red headed asked with wide eyes.
All Harry could feel was the weight laying on top of him, his breathing hard and fast, and the butterflies on his stomach.
Even after all this, she was as innocent as ever...
He was so tired; he had a huge headache! All he wanted to do was to rip his hair out and grab his eyes and eat them! He was so hungry too!
Sorry for this!!!! I’ll try to update this week the next chapter!!!
He sat up and Hermione handed him his glasses.
‘Yes, Harry, I’m still here’ the red head thought with another exasperated sigh. “Yes! Calm down, would you? There are other more important concerns to have in mind.”
At her with disdain!
For Godric’s sake, even Anna Abott would be better!
He looked around and saw, through the shop’s window, two heads of silver blond hair passing.

His hands grabbed onto the edges of the table for dear life. He knew he had to control his magic, since the last time he had gotten this excited, at the Dursley’s house, he had made some stuff around him float involuntarily.
__________
“Yes, it is! I’m sure we’ll win, but everyone else is more excited about the kissing cam than the actual game. Honestly, after the last game, I-“
“E-excuse me?”
Ravenclaw,
Neville! That’s it! He must know how to get rid of the weird smell!
He sometimes wished Harry would come out just like the spider. He remembered Hermione explaining him some muggle expression like: had to come out of the wallet, or something weird like that.
Malfoy and Parkinson were now in the same bed and, even though he didn’t know why, he felt his stomach twist. Like he had ate something rotten at dinner when he hadn’t even eaten at all.
Ron knew Harry wanted to argue, but he kept talking before the raven haired boy could say anything.
He felt his face getting warmer and he knew he was blushing from anger.
Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini were heard talking about their concerns for their friend.
Ps: I need to know.... who’s top and who is the bottom?!?!?!?!
Draco Malfoy has just entered the Great Hall, right in front of Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini and Theodor something.
Harry shook his head and simply accio’d the parchment the blond had hidden behind his back.
Of course, in that moment, the snakes had to step in the locker room.
Mislead.
He could see the difference between the Hermione in front of him and the Hermione from a few years back, she had grown beautifully.
He stood there awkwardly for almost a full minute, before he heard them whispering to each other and giggling—GIGGLING! Ginny Weasley didn’t GIGGLE!

He found a little bottle with a yellowish liquid inside that had a texture similar to melted gold.
He could smell the mint and honey coming from the other boy’s breath, the salty water in his skin; he could feel the bed sheets shift as the blond leaned closer and hot breath tickling his neck and jawline; he could hear a fast breath and a racing heart- both his, obviously.
They left the two of them alone.
That’s right! Draco is a bastard! For many reasons...
When things started to get faster, he involuntarily circled Draco’s hips with his legs as a way of slowing him down and savoring the feeling. His hands rose from the back to the other boy’s hair and deepened the kiss, keeping their hips moving in synchrony until he accidentally bit Malfoy’s lip after his hand moved down Harry’s side, up his leg and down again, resting on his buttock dangerously close to a very personal area of his.
He entered the jewelry shop and grabbed it, bringing it as close to his eyes as possible.
Cold lips kissed his shoulder, then moved to his collar bone and his neck, moving up and up.
“—MrWeasley?” He looked up and saw Slughorn looking at him and pointing at the boiling cauldron in his desk, which was    releasing a smoke that smelled oddly good.
And, as he looked around, he noticed the stress on the others Gryffindors’ faces.
“Harry!” Neville said “why are you so sweaty? Have you been running lately?”
“No, Weasley, I’m useless.” She rolled her eyes.
Harry looked away, blushing and wondered when his best friend had gotten less oblivious to the world around him.
“He called me fat!” She yelled, glaring daggers at her pink headed brother.
The hand roaming under his shirt slid down and stroked him over his pants, peeling his face away from Harry’s shoulders and facing him. Their noses were touching and Harry was sure that—just like his eyes were focused on the pair of pink, thin, kissable lips in front of him—Malfoy wasn’t looking at his eyes either.
Sorry for taking so damn long for such a short chapter! I just wanted it to be good! Thanks for reading and give me your honest opinions please!!!
Harry looked at the Great Hall again and saw the person he was looking for. Malfoy was just leaving, with Pansy pug-faced Parkinson in his tail.
Harry’s hands, on the other hand, were both placed in the blond’s chest.

Some movement catches his attention as he prepares to stand up.
But— he told himself, as he and the rest of the team entered the pitch for the big game— if he ignored his exhaustion, he wouldn’t feel it, nor be affected by it.
