“Sorted! Now call Potter, immediately.”
“Two glasses of the Pinot grigio.” Harry says with a voice of authority. I purse my lips, exasperated.
“You’re welcome dear.”
“It’s okay Dray. You fainted again.” He breathing slows down and he takes my hand.
“Ermm...yeah.”
15.10   The Dominant shall not loan his Submissive to another Dominant.
“Yeah sure, why not?” Ron tells her and indicates with his hand to follow him. She waves to us and tiptoes out.
“Excuse me?”
“Don’t you dare touch me!” He turns back around and carries on towards the floo. People turn to look and start whispering.
“Thank you.”
he’s saying, and it’s hot, freaking hot. I flush just watching them.
“Of course, Blaise.” I slur at him. “We wouldn’t miss it for the world.” I smile and he pulls me into a hug.
“Were you going to tell me that at any point?”
“Don’t worry Harry, if he doesn’t come home tonight he’s going to be in big trouble.” She says determinedly. That our Hermione for you, stubborn and bossy. That’s why we love her.
For a moment Harry couldn’t speak. Draco left his work, went home to change into a shirt he’d sworn he’d never wear, and came over just because Harry looked sad. He glanced at the package Draco placed on the coffee table, suspiciously looking like a cake box.
“Malfoy, are you okay?”
At the corner of his eyes, he could see the slight pinkness starting to spread on Draco’s cheeks at his words, and knew that his plan, even though he got caught, was working.
He was vaguely aware of the witches and wizards who were staring at them. They probably thought they’d gone mad. Had the news of Lucius disowning him already spread around? Or did they just think they’d drunk a few too many shots of firewhiskey? It should’ve bothered him; but much to his astonishment, he didn’t care. He’d spent his entire life caring what other people thought of him. He was tired of it. As if Lucius telling him he wasn’t going to support anymore him set him free not only from his constant control, but from the rules that dictated his life.
Harry could tell that Draco was already straining to control himself, could already recognize the slight difference in tone, the hint of hoarseness.
But he was still Draco’s father, despite all of his flaws. Knowing he would throw away their relationship just because Draco chose to be in a different kind of relationship than what he deemed appropriate still hurt.
He wasn't sure if it had just developed since they began sleeping together, or if maybe it had been there before, because Harry had been open in admitting that he'd definitely had feelings for Draco before they had started sleeping together, even though they were both taking things
—and yet he still didn't know how to reply. "And you don't need to answer right now," Harry's big hand squeezed at Draco's hip. "You don't need to answer until right up until the day it's happening, and even then, you can change your mind."
He could hear music playing inside—not obnoxiously loud so that the neighbours would be bothered, but just loud enough that Draco could hear because he was paying attention, so it was probably a little loud inside the apartment and maybe Harry Potter was dancing around a bit and—
there, and while that excited Draco, he bent down to take off his shoes before moving down the short hall to the bedroom.
and that was when Draco Malfoy couldn't hold back the sob in his throat.
He wasn't
"And you promise you're going to be here in the morning when I wake up? You're not going to run away again?" Harry wasn't smiling, even though his tone was calm, and his eyes were serious.
"Yeah?" Harry encouraged as his fingers kept getting faster.
He had clearly been wrong.
, but he was still doing his best to reassure Draco, to comfort Draco, and...
If he was with anyone else, he would be embarrassed about the noises that he was making and the way his body was jerking and almost flopping bonelessly under Harry's grip, but he didn't have to worry about that.
Draco's breathing began to pick up again and his body suddenly felt a flash of heat before feeling sweat-sticky under his arms and at his lower back and he began pulling at his clothes as he kicked off his shoes, just wanting to get free from the restrictive bonds.
Draco Malfoy gritted his teeth and let out a breath that he hoped was obvious, and that the guy would get a hint, because it had been nearly five minutes, and honestly, he just wanted to wait for the bartender to finally come over and pay for his drinks and then get out of here and the tosser in a knockoff Gucci suit just would not leave.
Draco let out a shaky breath as he stepped into the apartment, eyes flicking from side to side as Harry closed the door behind him and then lead the way across the open lounge, over to the kitchen.
"That's it, sweetheart," Harry whispered, and Draco could hear the tension in his voice, even if Harry sounded faraway, and he could feel the way his movements were getting slightly more erratic, losing the pace as he got close to his orgasm, and then he was pressing kisses to Draco's cheeks and foreheads. "You're safe, baby, let go," his daddy continued, and his voice was
“Well?” Kreacher pressed. He looked pleased with himself.
"That'd be considered
Harry didn’t even need Draco’s suggestive pull as he placed their clasped hands on Harry’s behind to know what he meant. He wasn’t in the mood for that right now, but he knew that with Draco’s nurturing, and after enjoying the pie, he would probably feel differently.
“Harry,” Draco cut sweetly into her words before she could say a name. He had a feeling that his father might have had something sinister in store for him, especially after the way he looked at the two of them when Draco first introduced Potter to him as his date. He offered a sweet smile. “Yes, that’s correct.” To prove his point, Draco searched for Potter’s hand, grabbed it, then pulled him closer. He heard Potter gasp. He knew that this wasn’t exactly what they agreed on. But if his father was walking around claiming he was engaged, then Draco had to pretend it was true. Partially, anyway; he assumed that his father was claiming his fiancé was Astoria, rather than Potter. He’d been trying to convince Draco to let go of his
And this was Potter who had kissed him. He was supposed to be disgusted by it, not -
“I vote for Harry,” Ron announced. He placed his fork down, grimacing as he swallowed the last of his bite of Harry’s pasta.
going to have sex with you!“
The large room was filled with scents of delicious fresh tomatoes cooking with basil and various other ingredients. Harry wasn't the only one who felt dizzy from how good the tomato sauce Kreacher was making seemed; he could see all three judges constantly drifting to sniff it, looking curiously at Kreacher's work, while only when they remembered he existed did Harry see their eyes moving to him.
In fact, there were only three people, other than himself, who were given the key spells to go through his wards, and none of them were supposed to be here.
something about it.

touch of it." He looked instead at Draco, meeting his silver eyes, and kept working the handle. Harry offered a smirk and made a show of flexing his bicep with the movement.
“Yes, father. He makes me happy. I wish you would give us your blessing.”
“Happy birthday, Harry!”
Draco wasn’t sure how he felt when he watched his father disappearing between the sea of lavish dress robes and floating party trays. A mixture of fear from the significance of the step he’d just made, and the elevating feeling of freedom that he’d finally made that one step, finally freed himself from the chains that held him from doing what he wanted to do,
Smirking, Harry moved on to flattening his dough. He had a small machine for it – a manual one – and he made sure to let out a soft, deliberately sexual groan as he started moving the handle to flatten the dough.
Potter blinked at the term of endearment. Well, if Potter was allowed to, then Draco should be, too; and Potter should live with that in peace. He nodded. Why did his surprised face induce such warmth in Draco’s stomach?
So what if it was a Saturday, and people were supposed to be free.
“Real enough for you, Mr. Malfoy?”
Yes, it would be expected of him to already be awake and functioning by now.
Draco shrugged. “We each get dealt our cards. You didn’t even get to know your parents.”
for myself, it was
"Sit on my lap, baby," Harry whispered, and Draco stumbled forward the half step so that he could lift one of his knees and rest it on the bed beside Harry's hip, and Harry's hands gripped his hips firmly, holding him carefully, taking his weight and lifting him up until he was straddling Harry's lap and then sitting down and—
"You paid at the club!" Draco attempted to sound firm, but Harry was still just smirking as he wrapped an arm around Draco's waist and pulled him in close, kissing the side of his temple and husking in his ear,
"Yeah, my baby?" Harry was snapping his hips faster again, a bruising pace, and Draco's cock was being rubbed almost painfully into the bed covers, his teeth still painfully—
"Stop," Harry's voice was stern but not sharp, but it still made Draco's shoulders jerk, the change in tone making goosebumps break out across his skin. "Stop doubting yourself, okay? Wherever your head is going right now, let it go. There's no problems, there's no issues, there's nothing wrong. You're here with me, and I've got you, okay?"
Harry saw what was underneath at the same moment Draco's eyes opened.
—" was all Draco managed before Harry was pressing inside and Draco's eyes rolled back into his head, the garbled moan just turning into a gurgle in his throat as his mouth hung open.
He hated that he got so anxious and panicky and it was as though he could feel the walls closing in on him, flashing back to when he was just a kid and he had nowhere to escape to and no way to get away from his father other than when he was due back at boarding school, no support other than from Pansy Parkinson and the empathetic looks from his silent mother—
," Draco whispered, waiting for whatever Harry had ready for him next.
"Come here, baby," Harry's voice was soft from where he was moving to it down on the couch and as Draco began to fold his knees, Harry reached out one strong hand and wrapped it around Draco's arm to pause him while he moved one of the small pillows from the couch and to the ground by his feet. Draco could feel the way his heart swelled in his chest, as though he could actually feel it expanding, and his cheeks warmed as he stared down at the pillow before kneeling as Harry squeezed his arm and helped him as he kneeled. "There you go," Harry murmured as Draco settled with his legs folded under him and his head shoulders drooped forward. And then one of Harry's hands smoothed over his shoulders, his thumb pressing into the side of his neck and Draco let out a moan at the way that Harry seemed to know exactly where the aching spots were. "Does that feel better?" Draco managed to nod, moving his neck to the side for Harry's better access, but then Harry continued. "Down on your knees for daddy?" He prompted and Draco stiffened slightly as he cock twitched at the words, his eyelids flickering before there was a low chuckle from Harry that sounded amused.
against the mattress and covers, one hand braced just in front of Draco's face, and his eyes blearily tried to fix on the flex of Harry's fingers, thick and gorgeous, with dark ink spiraling around three of them and a thick tungsten finger his index.
, but then Harry wound his fingers through Draco's hair and tugged
He hadn't even felt his eyebrows beginning to come together in a frown as he thought about the fact that aunt probably had to deal with his angry father, which she didn't deserve, and then worrying Pansy, who had had her own plans today and then had to take time out to chase up after Harry, and now Harry—
His head turned to the side, and his stomach plummeted when he was greeted with an empty bed, very similar to how his morning had gone the other time he had woken up after a night with Draco, except it had been in Draco's bed last time.
It might have been his mother though, he had mentioned to her at their weekly lunch the other day that he was going to be having brunch with Bellatrix today.
at me? Like—I couldn't really understand—"
Harry didn't say anything else, just kept holding Draco's smaller, more delicate hands in his bigger ones, rubbing them together, keeping them warm, kneeling in front of him and making a soft humming noise at the back of his throat.
since he'd had felt this bad, and he knew that he was on the verge of a panic attack.
It was one of Harry, Hermione, Pansy and Draco, and it had been taken about four months ago when they had gone bowling, and they had all been in the ugly striped shoes, and Luna had taken the photo and insisted that the shoes be in the photos, so they had all been trying to balance against each other and stick their feet in the ear but Draco had been laughing so much he kept overbalancing, and Luna had snapped a couple of photos, one of them with Harry reaching out and gripping Draco's elbow to help him balance on one leg with both of their other in the air and their ugly shoes showing and Draco was full on
He stumbled into Harry's bedroom, and it smelt strongly like Harry, as usual, but it made Draco's aching chest feel slightly warmed by the fact that his Chanel perfume also tinged the air, and there was a pair of his socks on top of the cluttered desk, one of his shirts, a book that he was reading on and off and had just decided to leave at Harry's for when he was there.
," Draco nodded his head rapidly, and he could feel drool beginning to gather in the corners of his lips, mouth open and eyes lolled back.
"I thought...We could make waffles?" Draco chewed down on his bottom lip, eyes darting to the side, and Harry didn't hesitate to reassure him.
He dipped his head in a nod, and then a second one, because they'd talked about this before, quite in depth, enough for the basics, the limits and desires that they both had when it came to non-sexual dominance, and Draco already trusted Harry to catch him if he sunk too deep or floated too far.
Harry was back before Draco even really registered that he was gone and he was smiling and pushing Draco's hair back from his face and leaning down to kiss his forehead as there was a knock on the door.
his eyes, he couldn't close them now—he couldn't take them off Harry between his legs as he shuffled back a little to pull his pants off, glad for the heater in the hallway that was spilling heat into the bedroom as well as the hallway. "I think you're
It was only when he felt Harry's thumb pressing into the side of his neck gently and shift behind him that Draco swayed slightly, feeling the slight ache in his thighs, and then there was warm breath on his shoulder before there were lips against his ear.
His clothes were made of some of the best materials, and yet they just felt scratchy and oppressive against his skin as he carelessly dropped his Dolce & Gabbana jacket on the ground and didn't bother lining up his Chelsea boots like he was usually so careful with, and tears started flowing down his overheated cheeks as he pulled at his long sleeved shirt underneath it, yanking it over his head and then letting out an upset, impatient noise through his nose as he pulled harder.
, daddy, s-
There was a low chuckle from Harry before his hands were sweeping up Draco's neck and thumbs pressing into the base and Draco's head just fell forward, his chin falling against his chest as Harry's nimble, tattooed fingers began to massage his neck and across his knotted shoulders.
Harry's expression was
It was perfect.
, and Draco loved the way the weight of the world just seemed to slip off his shoulders as the familiar scents of incense, Harry's cologne and faint weed surrounded him, and he fumbled with the buttons of his jacket as he let out a deep breath he hadn't realized he had been holding.
"Draco," Harry was suddenly holding his hand, the one between their bodies. "Breathe."
was going right, and
he was getting onto the bed behind Draco. Draco shuffled his legs wider, knees further apart, trying to be as open for Harry as possible, but obviously he wasn't quite in the position that Harry wanted, because the shorter, stockier man took over, easily manhandling Draco further forward on the bed, his chest pressed down against the bed with his ass pushed up in the air. "That's better, baby," Harry sounded as though he was smiling as he ran a few fingers down the cleft of Draco's ass, through the lube, and further down over his perineum until he was able to fondle his sac lightly before finally wrapping a hand around his cock.
Harry pressed in another finger, and honestly, two of his thick fingers felt equivalent to
"No," Harry responded with a smirk over his shoulder as they reached the shop and Harry reached past him to open the door, holding it open for the blonde to pass by him, something that felt natural now.
His limbs felt like noodles, but Harry had him, completely taking his weight, easily shifting him into the position he wanted, and the way that he
"Just let daddy take care of it, yeah?"
!" Draco whined out as his body jerked forward, curling over his daddy's lap and panting as he came in his sweatpants, ears burning red and mind buzzing with Harry's words as Harry instantly surrounded him in his arms, holding him tight and safe against his body.
Conversation had to be shouted, but that was okay because they weren't really there to talk all that much.
Harry wanted to do this,
looking after him.
, he would with Harry. "How far do you wanna go tonight?" His fingers were playing with the hem of the jersey, pushing it up around Draco's waist, because Draco could feel the warmth from his fingers even closer to his skin, only separated by the thin material of the shirt he was wearing, rather than through the knitted material now. "We'll do as much or as little as you want, whatever you want, love," Harry pulled back, hands moving to rest back on his hips which...Draco appreciated because he knew that Harry had asked him an important question and he
His breath caught in his throat, and he wondered if Harry was going to call him out, ask to know why he was at his apartment for the first time by himself in
fond.
"You okay?" Harry asked with a tilt of his head as he reached out his thick, calloused fingers and ran them down the side of Draco's face until they were resting under his chin, and Draco's eyelids instantly became heavy, an automatic reaction to Harry's touch.
Harry wasn't mad that he had stood him up without messaging him, but—it felt really good.
"Come for me, sweet baby," Harry whispered and Draco's mind went blank as he finally came, streaking the covers beneath them and undoubtedly making a mess all over Harry's hand.
that you—you're almost
"So good, baby," Harry cooed, his voice a little shaky, and Draco blinked up at him through bleary eyes. "You did so good for me." Draco couldn't talk, even as Harry slid his cock out of his mouth with a slight hiss of sensitivity as Draco kept suckling at the head, and Harry pressed his baby's mouth shut with his finger. "Swallow, baby," he murmured and Draco did as he was told with big eyes trained on Harry. "Good boy," he murmured and Draco couldn't help his whimper, especially as Harry's expression shifted slightly and he moved his foot, lifting it and pressing his foot against Draco's groin, over where he was hard and leaking in his borrowed sweatpants and Draco let out a squeak as his body instinctively tried to curl forward. "You want to get off, baby?" Harry asked sweetly as he stroked Draco's hair, and Draco managed a shaky nod. "That's right, love, you've been so good for me," he applied more pressure against Draco's groin and Draco whined as he blinked up at Harry with watery eyes. "Go on, baby, get off against daddy's foot," Harry murmured and Draco's body
"Hi," Harry breathed.
There were more tears, beginning to spill out the corners of Draco's eyes, and Harry pressed a soft kiss to Draco's inner thigh before his fingers pressed inside Draco's tight heat, not pausing, just slowly working them inside and stretching Draco as he went, and Draco's chest fluttered and clenched.
," he managed to stammer out.
"Yeah?" It sounded as though there was a tint of amusement to Harry's voice, but Draco knew that it would have been in the best possible way, and so Draco didn't open his eyes, he just enjoyed the fuzzy mindset that was slowly washing over him. "You're going to let me take care of you?" Draco knew he must have been smiling
. I won't leave again. I won't—I—"
. My boss is away and I've been in charge for the past month, and it's
that Harry had gotten to see him. That
He let out a squeak and then a long sigh as a third finger was pressed inside, his body not offering much resistance as Harry's fingers sunk inside.
you guys so much and I never want to mess anything up and—"
"It's okay, baby," Harry seemed to know as Draco's eyes shifted behind his eyelids, his voice soothing and low. His hands were calloused but then they were sweeping further up underneath the fabric of Harry's shirt that Draco was wearing, fingertips brushing against his nipples and Draco felt something in his brain short circuit, breath catching in his throat. "That's it," Harry whispered, pushing the shirt up further, and Draco's bones felt heavier in his body as he let Harry manhandle him, lifting him up off the mattress, his arms and his head, taking off the shirt and tossing it away so that Draco was left in just his panties, and his eyes were still closed, so he didn't see Harry's expression, but he could
"I told you the next time we were doing this, it was going to be with the light on," Harry words were quiet as he moved to sit on the bed so that he could look up at Draco and purposefully take in a deep breath. Draco stared down at him with wide eyes, his heart thundering in his chest, and seeing Harry take in a few breaths and close his eyes for a moment, as though he needed to calm himself down, it made him feel better. It made everything
There was this donut shop just around the corner from Harry's apartment that was open twenty-four hours, and they made the most amazing donuts—it had become a bit of a habit of theirs to go there when they were high and Harry laughed when he noticed Draco's longing expression and started pulling on Draco's arm.
It was sweeter.
!" Draco wailed out, feeling his balls pull up painfully as his toes curled, trying to stop himself from coming, even though it felt his cock hadn't been touched in
"No, I—" Draco
Maybe there was some stupid, romantic notion that he had tied to it in his head, but Harry had looked almost feral when Draco had first hesitantly asked, and the way that he had seemed to make it his mission that night after piercing him to suck his life out through his cock, so something about it had obviously struck a chord with him as well.
for Harry, and how Harry would tell him that, he would tell him he was good, maybe that he was a good boy, and pat his hair, and maybe touch his shoulders since he wasn't wearing a shirt.

"Water is heating up," Harry said as he came back into the room. "And I've got us towels." Draco nodded, and even though Harry had seen him naked too many times to count now, in the light of day, and when they weren't explicitly getting naked for
He didn't even know how Lucius had known that he was going to be at Bellatrix LeStrange's, from his aunts surprised expression when the housekeeper had come in to announce him just moments before he had strode into the room, to her horrified, tight-lipped expression when he begun speaking, Draco knew that she wouldn't have intentionally had told him that Draco was going to be there.
And Harry
. Draco's breathing came out shakily and his hips jerked upwards before Harry's big, sure hands were pressing down firmly on both sides of his body, guiding him back down against the mattress. "Da-
Harry gently helped him under the covers and sheets before stripping off the top duvet and whispering to Draco he would be back in a moment and disappearing with the dirty blanket, returning within what felt like seconds later, just like he promised, with a bottle of water in one hand and another blanket thrown over his shoulder.
"Yes, daddy," he murmured and he felt the way Harry's fingers tightened at his first use of the word for the evening.
"No," Draco shook his head, not even really thinking about the fact that he kind of had, but it wasn't Harry's fault. Technically he was meant to be meeting Pansy, he'd said he would look out for her, and Harry had just said that he would see him there since he was going to be arriving with Hermione and Ron, who would usually come a bit later. "Not too long."
of Draco's slim fingers inside himself, and he shuddered, eyes rolling back as Harry began to move, sliding the fingers back and forth, in and out, twisting and scissoring them.
is what I've wanted for a really long time and I just...I didn't want to mess anything up," his cheeks were flaming as he laid everything out. "I was scared that if we talked in the morning it was going to be this one night stand for you and it was all going to be over and...I kind of just thought if I left before you woke up, I could pretend it was this perfect, untouched night..." he trailed off, because he knew that it sounded kind of stupid, and the
Continuously.
And as soon as he thought that, he was reminded of why he was here, and what had happened the last time he and Harry had been alone together, and his heart started thundering and his bottom lip quivered and he had to put down the smoothie glass, his hand feeling a little a shaky as he dropped it back to his lap, twisting the gold family heirloom ring around his middle finger.
"Good boy," Harry murmured and kissed the side of his head before pressing the back of Draco's head, so that his fingers slid further to the back of his mouth, towards his throat, and Draco instantly had to quickly swallow and adjust, but Harry's fingers didn't relent until they were fully inside Draco's mouth, so full they were stretching the corners of Draco's lips. "You look so pretty for me, baby." Harry's dark eyes were so intense as he looked down at Draco and it made his toes curls as he tried to respond to Harry, but the moment he managed to open wider, Harry pushed his fingers deeper in Draco's mouth, his fingers nudging gently at the back of Draco's throat and making his eyes water as they rolled back and any drool that he had been attempting to swallow back spilled down his chin. "So pretty," he repeated quietly, almost to himself, before he was ducking forward and licking at his chin, cleaning him up before pressing a gentle kiss to the corner of Draco's mouth. "You show me that you can take my fingers this deep, I'll fuck your face after, okay?" He whispered and Draco...Draco moaned, loud enough that it escaped from around Harry's digits and it made Harry smirk.
"Turn back around, baby," Harry smiled at him, nothing but adoration on his face as he gently touched Draco's chin to turn his head back around before he was leaning forward to pull over one of his sketching pads that laid around the apartment, and one of the pencils that was on table top before picking up the remote.
"Hi," Draco breathed, a little confronted by, well, Harry. "H-hi," he repeated, swallowing hard, and a knowing smile spread across Harry's face, but it was nothing like the smug-ass smirk that had been on Mr Fake Gucci's face.
Draco couldn't help the smile on his face, a little bit dopey as he let Harry shift him around, gently move him under the spray of the water to rinse off any last soapy suds before he turned off the shower and reached out for a towel.
"Did you wear these wanting some boy to see you in them, baby?" Harry asked, voice dark and low, and it made Draco shiver. "You wear these for the boy that kissed you?"
," Draco cringed and shook his head. "I shouldn't—I haven't gone to the gym much this week and I—" he cut off as soon as he realized his mistake and Harry arched an eyebrow.
"Sounding like a bitch as usual, Parkinson," he replied easily and Pansy's smile widened before she was reaching up to give him a quick kiss on the cheek and she turned back to Draco. "Do you remember Katie Bell?"
Usually Hermione was the one who did most of the piercings at the shop, Harry focused primarily on tattooing, but with Draco it was different, and Hermione had known that, given the pair of them hadn't kept their suddenly developing relationship a secret, and even if they had, they would never have been able to hide it from Hermione or Pansy, even if they had managed to keep it from other friends.
fingers into him.
And he really

"Yes, daddy," Draco murmured, mouth feeling better than it had before even if his head was still pleasantly heavy with clouds.
It was stupid—he
"Dray baby!" Came a shout and Draco could already hear the slight slur in her voice, which explained why his best friend was late, as he smiled and turned to the side to see Pansy approaching, with Hermione and Ron behind her. "I'm so sorry I was late! You'll never believe who I ran into!" She exclaimed as she reached them, looking at Harry briefly, scrunching her nose and giving him a quick once over. "Looking completely under dressed as usual, Potter," she said in a fond voice.
Harry had been the one to do it.
," Draco's body jerked at that, nerve in his jaw jumping and white noise filling his ears for a split second at the whispered words.
"Sound so sweet, pretty baby," Harry straightened up and there was a line of drool between his lips and Draco's cock, and it made his cock twitch against his stomach, jump and smear precome and Harry smile wide before wiping the back of his hand messily across his face. He reached up, and pressed a chaste kiss to Draco's slack mouth, that the blonde tried to follow but his head felt too heavy to properly lift off the pillow. Harry just smiled at him as he pulled back, and then he was reaching into the bedside table, where he had gotten the lube earlier, and he pulled out a condom. "I don't doubt either of us are clean, baby, but we'll get tested soon so that I can fill you up properly, okay?" Harry said softly and Draco's pupils blew even wider at that implication and he nodded, trying to follow all movements even if it was hard. "Do you want that, baby?" Harry asked as he tore the corner of the edge of the condom wrapper, but his eyes were still on Draco, eyes catching every single flicker of expression on his face. Draco nodded but Harry clicked his tongue and smiled a little. "Wanna hear you say it, Dray," he prompted gently and Draco groaned lowly.
"That's a...Big question," Draco huffed out a laugh as he blew out a cloud of smoke and Harry smiled with him, although his smile was less sarcastic, but didn't say anything, leaving it up to Draco to fill the space between them when he was ready. Draco took a steadying breath, fiddling with the joint and tapping off the ash from the end. "I'm sorry I ran out," Draco began, and his words came out a little more squeaky than he intended, and he plucked the lighter from where Harry had rested it on the step between them so that he could get another lungful of smoke, because he

, he still felt a bit shy. Harry smiled at the ground as he started stripping out of his own clothes, obviously noticing but not commenting on it as Draco hooked his fingers into the sides of his panties and shimmied them down, and then Harry reached out for his hand and pulled him in close, so their naked bodies pressed together and Draco barely suppressed a shiver. "You okay, baby?" He whispered softly, right into Draco's ear, and this time, Draco couldn't help the shiver.
Draco's eyes were rolling back and drool was gathering in the corners of his mouth, not even realizing the way his attention was
Draco had always loved giving blowjobs, he'd realized he had an oral fixation when he was a teenager which was something that Pansy had teased him about a lot, and wanting something rougher, having someone take over and just use his face and move him in the way that they wanted—the idea of it had always made him feel light headed.
"So..." Draco was here, he might as well get everything out. He had already said enough, he might as well just get everything out there, the things that had been hanging between them for the past two weeks, the worries that had literally been keeping him up at night. "We're just friends?" His voice sounded a little broken, and it definitely gave away how much he was hanging out for the answer.
Harry had started buying extra products for the shower in the time that they had been together, given the only things he'd had in there before had been coconut shampoo, a simple body wash and shaving cream and a razor—which Draco had found both endearing and terrifying the first time he had showered there.
"Yes, daddy," Draco's voice was breathy now, and not just from the position that he was propped up in that made it slightly harder to breathe, practically folded in two.
He didn't remember everything, it got a little hazy in some places, but he remembered Harry talking about how he had wanted to look after Draco, and how he'd wanted to touch him before, but had always just been waiting, but part of Draco had just let himself think of that as pillow talk, even when he got himself off to it in the nights that followed.
He was rambling and the thing was; he could kiss Harry.
—Need it, daddy, please!" Draco wasn't sure if it was the weed, since he hardly ever smoked, maybe the left over tequila shots, or just
didn't feel right, and he wished Harry was here, but Harry had work and Draco didn't want to be needy and drag him away from that and so he just had to be patient and
"Want...You to fill me up properly with y-your come," Draco said quietly, his cheeks burning red, his stomach twisting in a way that made his cock leak even more, his lubed hole clenching around
toward subspace, knowing that his daddy had him, that even though it felt so good, and he could feel him losing himself in grunts and sighs, his cock so deep inside Draco's ass that he could feel it in his throat, but that unlike Draco, he kept his head, looking after Draco, looking after his baby. "You can hold it until daddy's done, right?" Draco's bleary eyes attempted to widen, but he struggled just to open his sticky eyelids. "You can be a good boy for daddy, right?" He whispered directly in Draco's ear before pulling his fingers out of Draco's mouth so he could brace both hands on the mattress and begin driving into Draco.
"Still with me, baby?" Harry checked in and Draco let out a deep, easy, rushing breath.
There had been some times with Harry when he had felt himself beginning to float, but it had never felt quite like this before.
himself panting, it sounded almost thunderous in his ears, the only other sound reaching him was Harry's voice and the lewd, squelching sounds that came from how wet he was from the lube. "I'm going to fuck you in your pretty panties, okay, baby?"
He could have his eyes open if he wanted to, there was a reason why Harry had the TV on, but there was also a reason that Harry had it turned down so low, so that it wouldn't disturb Draco if he just wanted to let go.
Harry gently began to encourage Draco's head in back and forth motions before sliding a third finger into his mouth and Draco felt a whine instantly rise in his chest as he let his mouth be more lax, allowing Harry easily to stretch his lips and make room for his fingers.
"That's it, pretty baby," Harry praised him sweetly, and Draco's body just...It felt so light, feather light, as though if Harry wasn't there to anchor him with calming words and soft touches he would be floating right up and off the bed. His eyes closed again, breathing coming out a little hitched as he felt Harry run a hand down his side before he was moving, repositioning himself, and then the mattress was shifting and Draco's eyes slowly opened again, everything feeling lethargic as his lips stretched in a smile. "Baby?" Harry's voice was a lot closer, so close that Draco actually felt warm breath on his nose.
"You're going to feel amazing around me, I know it," Harry whispered, and then one of his hands was cupping Draco's jaw while his lips were pressing against his mouth, and he was pushing inside Draco.
It didn't work.
that you parade around with a
"That feel good, baby?" Harry whispered, and he leaned forward to press a soft kiss to the inside of Draco's thigh. "Your hole is so tight around my finger." Draco whimpered at that. "Don't know how my cock's supposed to fit in there, baby...Too tight, pretty baby," Harry kissed his thigh again, as his thick finger buried deep inside Draco, the single digit making him gasp. "Going to feel fucking perfect around me, just like I always knew you would."
times when they were all out clubbing. "I'm so glad I get you again, baby," Harry breathed against his mouth before he was grabbing Draco around the waist and twisting them around, manhandling him easily up the bed, and Draco gasped as he was tossed against the duvet covers, a breathy smile spreading as he let his eyes close and just lay back to take in the moment. "So glad you're going to let daddy take care of you."
Maybe as bad as Draco wanted him.
"Come on," Harry prompted him, and when Draco looked up, he saw that everything had been cleared away and the bench had been wiped down, and Harry was holding his own drink in his hand, the other arm outstretched toward Draco, indicating that he get up. So Draco did, on shaky legs, picking his glass back up and hoping that he didn't shake too much and drop it, and Harry ushered him into the lounge. "Did you want to watch something on TV?" Harry asked as they sat down on his couch, which was old and sunken in and so ridiculously comfortable, with a bunch of cushions that had different sayings sewn into them.
in Harry's face, and Harry was smiling at him and...Draco had been embarrassed about twenty seconds after this photo and pulled away from Harry, because he was still sweaty from playing and his breath probably smelt bad from the bowling alley nachos and he might have spat over Harry's face because he had been laughing
He felt as Harry was about to come, he knew the changes in his breathing and the way his thighs tensed up, and then Harry tightened the hand at the back of Draco's head, keeping him in place as he began to come, groaning as he pumped into Draco's mouth and his baby swallowed as much as he could, tears beginning to stream down his face as he choked slightly, feeling spit and come leaking out from the corners of his mouth.
"Uh-uh, baby, we've talked about this," Harry's voice sounded closer, hovering over him. "Daddy wants to hear all of your pretty sounds." They had, Harry had told him almost every time they had slept together, although it was hard to break automatic habits that had been enforced a
and then the greasy bag of donuts that one of those big hands was holding, before Harry looked back over his shoulder with an amused raise of his eyebrow. "Do you need some help finding the bedroom, baby?" He asked, and there was a slight
Harry went slow, but he didn't stop, his cock stretching Draco until he was fully seated inside his lover, and Draco wasn't sure when he started making a low, guttural noise at the back of his throat, but his brain just felt so foggy and Harry felt so good and he was still kissing Draco's mouth, even though Draco was barely able to respond to him.
, the first time that Harry stretched him open with his cock always received a full body response—a guttural moan and tremors running under his skin, his fingers grabbing at the covers and trying to steady himself.
"I wasn't that hungry, so I was just having a smoothie for dinner," Harry shrugged. "You want one?"
a blurt of precome at the words.
"Here you go," Harry murmured as he pushed one of the smoothie glasses across the bench toward Draco, and then started putting things away and cleaning up before he touched his own glass.
"Someone...Kissed me tonight—just before I came here," Draco blurted out, and Harry stilled for a moment, before his thumb started rubbing against the back of Draco's hand again and his fingertips on Draco's cheeks softly brushed his jaw.
it just made Draco's mind short, even in the hazy state he was in now, and his cock instantly began to fill more from the barely half-hard state that he had been in most of the evening.
But it was because it was different this time.
Draco licked at Harry's fingers with his tongue, hollowing out his cheeks, darting looks up at Harry who was looking back at the TV, with the hand that wasn't being sucked off by his baby cradling the back of his head, holding it quite firmly in a way that was making Draco shake, because it wasn't too obvious, it wasn't too over the top, but it was a definite, firm hold and Draco was trapped between Harry's hands and wouldn't be able to get out even if he wanted to.
Draco felt tears fall from the corners of his eyes once Harry was inside him, and thankfully Harry didn't comment, just pulled back from his lips enough that their noses were still brushing, and the thumb that was resting on his cheek moved to brush away one of his tears.
Of course Draco remembered Katie Bell.
Draco didn't really follow what he was doing, letting his eyes drift closed and his mind begin to float as Harry turned something on the TV, turning the volume down low and flipping open his sketching pad and then going quiet.
It was a mixture of the praise and the slight humiliation of the words that made Draco burn.
"Yeah...Uh—I've kinda—I've already had some shots," Draco face dropped slightly, but he found that when Harry was looking at him in the way he was, and the fact he was still holding his face and his hand and hadn't pulled back even though Draco had admitted that he had been kissed just before he had come over. "Um, I don't think I want anything more to drink, but yeah, let's have something to smoke."
, baby, you—you always feel amazing, baby," Harry babbled sometimes when he came, but he usually managed to pull himself together pretty quickly, especially if he was drawing out Draco's orgasm. "God, baby…" Harry drew in a sharp breath through his teeth before he was pulling back, settling back on his knees and pulling Draco's cheeks apart, exposing him completely and Draco could
And Draco was so appreciative of that, because right now, sex wasn't something that was at the forefront of his mind, even though a buzz of arousal was still generated almost automatically when around Harry, and especially when he looked at him like
Which he did.
"Yeah, baby," Harry breathed out, and the hand through Draco's hair, curved around the back of his head. "You can call me daddy." Draco whimpered and Harry's grip was almost bone-crushing on his hand. "But, baby...I don't share. Can't stand the thought of your pretty mouth on someone elses." Draco was already nodding his head rapidly before Harry had finished talking. "Yeah, baby?"
Draco's mind felt as though he was sinking deeper into subspace and they hadn't even
have a chance, and he'd blown it, and then he just decided to show up a month later and expected Harry to comfort him and let him call him daddy and take care of him?
The door opened, and then Harry was actually standing there, in grey sweatpants and a baggy blue shirt, glasses on rather than his contacts which probably meant he was watching TV, and his hair was all messy and shoved all out at weird angles.
"I'm sorry, I just..." Draco trailed off and swallowed hard, fingers tightening around his glass, pressing in through the condensation. "I just—" he cut off again, and then there was movement and Harry was a bit closer on the couch, reaching out to take the smoothie glass from him and rest both of them on the coffee table and then put his hand gently on Draco's lower back.
"Thank you, daddy," Draco said, surprised by how thick and slurred his voice was, and he blinked slowly, but Harry didn't seem taken aback, smiling warmly as he took his hands and helped him to his feet.
"Let it go, baby," Harry whispered and Draco's eyes drifted closed without a second thought. "Just let daddy look after you, yeah? I've got you."
Draco knew that Harry was at work, he had known that he wouldn't be here, and he purposefully hadn't text him to tell him that his father had shown up at his aunts place completely unannounced, and that he had triggered Draco's anxiety.
"He was still watching you when we walked away," Harry said and Draco's brain tried to grasp at the words, trying to remember who 'he' was because the only people who were important right now were him and Harry. "And I saw him watching you later, when you were dancing with Pansy, looking so fucking pretty I just wanted to come into the middle of the dance floor and fuck you right there."
Hearing the term of endearment made Draco's head swim.
Harry only had one ring on tonight, the silver one on his pinky with a greenish-blue stone, which was a change from the usual, since he always seemed to have enough silver on his hands to weigh down a small horse.
it. "Dray.
Draco was whimpering and twitching and Harry took his time before moving to gather his lover up into his arms, bringing him up onto the couch and kissing his face softly, running his hands gently over his skin as he whispered how good he was, how beautiful he was, how much his daddy appreciated him.
It was soft, and slow, and Draco's head almost immediately felt fuzzy and he felt his body melt forward as Harry's fingers spread out, across his cheeks, and then began to push gently through his blonde hair, moving around to cup the back of his head to tilt it to the side and Draco just let himself be moved carefully.
that, it was a dirty trick, but it worked.
, when he felt gentle pressure to his lower lip, which made him automatically part his lips as he hazily opened his eyes and tipped back his head to look at up at his daddy.
It looked like an incredibly indulgent dessert, and there was no way Draco could deny himself one if it was being offered.
," Draco whined, brave from the weed and the way Harry was looking at him.
did he come here?
He knew that his daddy came, he absently felt it and he could still feel his daddy kissing him and it was sweet and calming, and the fog in his mind made him feel as though he was floating, and the way that daddy was speaking to him—even though he didn't quite understand the words, he couldn't quite hear exactly what daddy was saying—but it was nice, it was all so nice.
the warm come beginning to trickle out before Harry shoved himself back inside with a wet squelch "Up on your knees, my baby," Harry whispered, pulling him back by his hips, Draco completely powerless to stop him, even if he wanted to.
"You ready?" Harry's voice was a little muffled on the other side of the door, jolting Draco forward, and he opened the door quickly. Harry was standing a little further down the hallway and Harry tipped his head to the side. "Come on," he gave Draco a smile and Draco almost tripped over his boots to quickly walk over to him. He was a bit confused as to why they were opening the bathroom door together, and then Harry was shoving up the large window inside. "I'm trying to stop smoking inside so much," Harry explained with a sheepish grin. "Is that okay?" He was already climbing out the window, hitching himself up to the waist-height windowsill.
Maybe he shouldn't have, because Harry's eyes were suddenly so dark that Draco was instantly hard in his pants.
," Draco's hands grabbed at Harry's shoulders, nails digging tiny crescents into the tanned skin. "So good."
Even though it had only been a few months, Draco had lost count of the many times that he had gone down on Harry.
Harry pursed his lips together and for a split second, Draco thought that he was going to say no, but then he was stepping aside and jerking his head backwards.
"Daddy?" The word was a little slurred and Harry huffed out a small laugh before he was dropping a kiss to Draco's nose.
Draco's mind just felt so fuzzy he could barely see as he swallowed around his daddy's cock, just trying to get him to look down at him again or scratch at his hair in the reassuring way, and every time Harry did, Draco just felt everything inside him tip further into that cloudy, floating abyss.
us to be more?" Harry asked after a moment. Draco blinked as he turned his head to look at Harry, but the brunette wasn't looking at him, he was looking ahead and his eyebrows were furrowed. "Because...I mean, what happened that night between us...What we shared—you said you were scared. What were you scared of?" There was something there that Harry had cut himself off saying and Draco wanted to know but Harry wasn't looking back at him, so he knew that it was his turn to speak again.
It was more intense.
"Um..." Draco chewed down on his bottom lip, eyes lowered, eyelashes fluttering as he stared down at Harry's shiny mouth, just wanting to get all of this over with so that they could fall into bed together. "Can I—can I call you d-daddy?" He stammered a little, but he was proud of himself for getting the question out, and he lifted his eyes to meet Harry's.
"Would you—would you want to be my boyfriend?" It sounded like such a dumb question but…
Draco managed to struggle out of his skinny jeans, leaving him only in pale yellow panties with a tiny bow at the back, sliding between the sheets of Harry's bed and tugging the pillows closer around him, smothering him in their combined scents and comfort immediately calming him down, even though his tears were still steadily spilling down his cheeks and now wetting the pillow beneath him.
"It's nearly four o'clock," Harry said with a smile as he went to his drawers, taking out two sets of sweatpants and pulling his pair on first, not bothering with briefs, and then kneeling again in front of Draco and holding open the sweatpants, as though helping him dress was second nature, something that they did commonly and not just when Harry was helping him when he was cold or too fucked out to manage to coordinate his limbs. "I got home a while ago, but you were clearly tired, I wanted you to sleep, baby."
!" Draco cried out, back snapping into an arch and his eyes opened wide even though his vision was completely whited out. "
"God, I love it," Harry rasped out before he was doubling forward and licking over Draco's nipple, the piercing cleanly healed for over a month now. He'd changed it from the plain, solid silver barbell that they had originally used for his piercing. It was a sparkling pink piercing now, a close favourite after green of Draco's, but he liked the softer way the pink contrasted with his pale skin. "You're just so fucking pretty, baby," Harry growled out, and then he bit at the barbell and at Draco's nipple and Draco jerked and twitched to the side and the sharp teeth digging into the sensitive skin, feeling his cock twitch in his pants, already almost completely hard.
It forced him to slow down, to take things in that he never would have before, to appreciate the smaller things in life, and his hand tightened around Harry's hand as his heart swelled as these thoughts made their way through his alcohol-addled brain.
an order right now. "Good boy, Dray," Harry said as he came back over to the couch and saw that Draco had twisted off the lids of their water bottles. "Thank you."
Quiet settled between them for a few moments, the only reason there wasn't any silence was because there was still music playing, which was coming from the TV, some music channel on, and Draco sipped at his smoothie, even though he was so nervous that he couldn't taste the smoothie anymore.
Because maybe Harry wasn't his boyfriend, but he was his
And he never wanted to lose him.
, but he was meant to meet Harry at his and Hermione Grangers parlor after he left Bellatrix's, because Harry was only working until one. But...He had come here, because brunch obviously hadn't gone in the way he had expected. Instead of asking any questions that might suddenly put Draco on the spot, Harry tilted his head to the side and brushed his fingers over Draco's forehead. "How was your sleep, hm?"
The words were all quiet and hushed, like secrets just between them, and Draco
How many times Harry had fucked his face, though, and since they'd properly discussed boundaries?
"Can I—" Draco swallowed hard, looking to the side and rubbing a hand over the arm of his silk blouse, noticing the music was a lot quieter now. "Can I come in?" He asked softly.
"Can you open the drinks for me while I get our food?" Harry said and Draco nodded without a verbal response, happy to just stay quiet and do what would make his daddy happy. Harry went to the door and unlocked it, opening it and speaking quietly with the person on the other side, paying for their food and exchanging pleasantries with whoever was delivering the food and Draco felt his skin buzzing happily at the soft murmur of his daddy's voice. There was no way that he would have been able to hold a conversation right now, even though he was actually desperately hungry—his stomach was beginning to gurgle, he didn't even know if he would have been able to
Now he had somewhere to go, somewhere he felt safe, where he felt loved, and instead of listening to his father and whatever he had to say after storming in and beginning with, 'Your mother has informed me that you're planning on bringing this
It was strange the way as soon as he opened the front door and greedily sucked in a breath of air from inside Harry Potter's apartment that he immediately felt himself calm down, just a little.

"Do you
, in a way that made his heart ache in his chest, starting by shuffling all the way down the bed to where Draco's feet were still in his boots, and pausing at the fluffy pink and blue socks that were hidden underneath—he paused and smiled fondly before leaning down and kissing the tips of Draco's toes over the fluffy socks and Draco couldn't help but giggle and wiggle his toes a little in response, eyes opening just a little to make out the fuzzy shape of Harry crouched between his legs before they fell shut again—and then Harry started to undo the button and zipper of his jeans and Draco's eyes snapped open as he remembered what was underneath.
"Be good for me, pretty boy, and settle back," Harry said softly and Draco's eyelids fluttered before he took in a deep breath and just relaxed, letting Harry take back over completely.
. "How far do you want to go, hm?" Harry asked softly, and both his hands moved, running up and down Draco's hands outside the faux-leather pants which made Draco's skin break out in goosebumps underneath the material. "What do you need from me, baby?"
Draco sipped from the glass delicately, and then had to contain his moan of approval.
The first press of Harry's finger inside him had Draco's eyes jolting open and moaning loudly at the stretch.
"I know what you mean, Dray," Harry assured him softly and Draco nodded curtly before lighting the joint and taking in a deep breath, handing it back to Harry so he could relight his own.
Draco never felt as good as he felt when he was with Harry, and it was after days like today, that Harry just kept proving to him
Draco's clutched Harry tightly as he came, harder than he had in a long time, and that was saying something given the way Harry had made him come just a few weeks ago when they had fooled around for the first time.
Draco's eyes widened and his breath caught in his throat.
It didn't take long, with how fuzzy Draco's head was, and how hard he had been for so long, and Harry pressed his toes against Draco's cock and rotated his foot slightly and Draco whimpered and shuddered and Harry patted his hair.
Or the way tears sprung back to his eyes from hours earlier.
"Dray? I need to tell you something first," Harry whispered, and he pulled back, which made Draco's stomach drop at first, but he didn't pull away very far as well, the tip of his nose still bumping against Draco's. "I've liked you for a

Letting them take him apart so often, and believing that they would put back the pieces, even when it was times like this, something rather rushed and into the early hours of the morning.
Sometimes, even though he was with Harry, he still didn't totally feel himself relax until they were safely tucked away from the world.
inside the shower.
"You got dinner the other week," Harry replied, conveniently forgetting that there had been two lots of pizza ordered since then that Harry had covered, plus the snacks, food and weed that he constantly supplied Draco with and refused to take any money for no matter how much Draco tried. But Draco knew better than to argue, and he felt this warm feeling bloom inside him whenever Harry insisted on taking care of things like this for him. "Great, thanks, mate," Harry nodded at the bartender as he handed over his card, and then smiled as he looked back at Draco, very pointedly ignoring Mr Fake Gucci. "You been waiting long?"
," Draco whined out, and the way that Harry was so easily manhandling him, Draco's body almost completely fallen to the bed now, his thighs so weak from the way that Harry was fucking him that they had slid out from underneath him. His elbows completely slid out from underneath him and he turned his face before he completely face-planted the covers, his cock getting trapped between his body and the bed covers. "D-
, Draco, you have
pretty baby'.
"Did you want some weed? Or a shot? Maybe that'll be better than a smoothie," he gave Draco his crooked smile and the horrible knots in Draco's stomach relaxed just a little.

"Yes,
him, collapsing over him, mouth crushing down against his, nose smushed against his, and Draco cried out at the pressure almost directly against his cock, only kept apart now by the flimsy, silky material of his panties.
He felt Harry's tongue touch to his bottom lip and his own lips parted but Harry didn't push inside straight away, he took his time, tasting the corners of Draco's mouth and the blonde could feel himself beginning to shake, his toes curling in his boots and his heart beginning to thud.
Draco cut himself off.
"Yeah, darling?" Harry sounded just as breathless. "Does that feel good?" It didn't sound as though he required a reply, which was good, because his fingers started moving faster and Draco's eyes rolled back, unable to stop the way his hips began to roll down to meet Harry's fingers. "Oh, baby..." Harry made a disapproving clucking noise at the back of his throat and Draco's eyes opened hazily to meet Harry's. "I didn't say you could move yet, did I?"
Harry slung an arm around Draco's waist as he nuzzled in a little closer, although not as close as they woke up, because they always woke up intwined together even though there was this sliver of space between them whenever they actually went to sleep, but even though Harry's breathing started to deepened and even out, and it was the early hours of the morning after a long week, there was something buzzing at the back of Draco's mind that was stopping him from being able to go to sleep.
"Come on, then," Harry pushed himself off the ground and held out a hand to Draco. Draco hesitated, but then reached out and took Harry's hand, delicate fingers being gripped firmly in Harry's strong hand. They left their barely touched smoothie's on the table as Harry lead Draco around the back of the couch and toward the back of his apartment, where Draco had only been a couple of times when he needed to use the bathroom. "Did you want to borrow a shirt?" Harry asked as he looked over his shoulders and his eyes glanced down over the navy blue silk shirt with little blue polka dots, the pussy bow not hanging quite as prettily as it had been before. "Not that I have any issue with what you're wearing now," there was a small curve to the left corner of Harry's mouth that made Draco's body flush under his clothes. "But another shirt might be more comfortable."
"Gonna let me take care of you?" Harry whispered in his ear and Draco shivered again, almost violently and he heard a low laugh from Harry, the light puffs of air against the curve of his neck, more goosebumps breaking out. "Gonna be good for me, baby?"
he was that safe place.
He also remembered Harry telling him that he was pretty, even then, even before Draco had needed to verbalize what he wanted.
"Okay...Okay," Harry said softly, as he breathed out his last mouthful of smoke and snubbed out his own joint before turning to Draco, and Draco forced himself to look at Harry, at least partially, holding his breath as he waited for whatever it was that the other man had to say. "So...You're saying you want something more? Yeah?"
to do anything, baby," Harry murmured easily, and he moved forward easily so that they were closer together again, easily still rubbing Draco's shoulders. "I'm doing this because I want to."
"H-Harry?" Draco's voice sounded dry and he instantly heard Harry's breathing change and his grip tighten around his hip.
For a long time, it had just been Draco and Pansy, stuck together in a rich, cold world by themselves, and they both counted themselves lucky to find Harry, Hermione, Ron and their friends, and sometimes he still couldn't believe that they'd gotten so lucky.
At first, it had been okay, but it had been almost five minute now, and Draco hated being crowded as it was, and he knew he should have just waited outside the club for Pansy Parkinson or Harry Potter before coming in.
, I guess."
Harry's face was proud as he stared down at Draco, still cupping Draco's face as he finished in his mouth before brushing his thumbs over the apples of Draco's cheeks before swiping down through the mess that was dripping down his chin.
"You don't have to do this," Draco began to mumble, trying to force his shoulders and tug away from Harry's touch, but Harry just easily followed after him with his sturdy hands and kept massaging him. "I'm—I'm sorry that I—that I didn't come and meet you like—like we planned—" guilt was beginning to clog up his throat and he could feel panic coming back, his body tensing and his eyes blurring over with tears. "You don't have to do this," he repeated, because really, if anyone was looking after anyone here, it should be him looking after Harry, since he was the one who had been working today.
"What's your colour, love?" He asked, cupping Draco's face with damp fingers, neither of them caring about the spit that was amusing across Draco's cheek.
Draco did.
"Y-yes," Draco mumbled.
He'd had a chance with Harry, he'd been lucky enough to
There was no rush when it came to eating, and Harry made that very clear given the way he kept feeding Draco over feeding himself, reaching over to wipe Draco's chin whenever he spilt any sauce or food, and he kept whispering in Draco's ear and brushing his tattooed fingers through blonde hair.
He wanted
Every now and then, Harry's hand would gently rub over his back, down his spine and splay out against Draco's bare, pale skin, which would draw the occasional shiver.
a complimenting conditioner, multiple body washes, a loofah and
He stepped forward, holding out his hand toward Draco, and Draco's eyes widened slightly before taking Harry's hand, letting the other man help him to his feet.
"Draco, I'm never going to turn you away," Harry said softly, but firmly. "You're always welcome here, I hope you know that after all this time." Draco's eyes darted to the side, and Harry had fully turned so that he was looking at Draco, and Draco's eyes quickly looking forward again. "We've..." Harry hesitated and Draco's body stilled, his fingers tightening around the filter of the joint. "We're friends, you know?" Harry's voice was a lower, and Draco didn't miss the wince on Harry's face, but the words still sunk in.
!" He gasped as Harry's fingers pressed down firmly over where Draco's cock was hard and pressing against his zipper, which was prominent and straining again the confines of his pants.
He felt safe, and warm, and ground...And loved, but that wasn't something he was quite ready to explore just yet.
The idea of Harry getting angry at someone in public made Draco's cock twitch again and he let out a shaky breath, long, thin fingers stretching out over the duvet covers and trying to calm himself down.

the size of his, but Draco would take showering here every day of the week over at his own place.
It shoved the breath from his chest and made his eyes roll back.
Harry nuzzled at his stomach, pushing up the hem of the borrowed shirt and exposing his pale stomach, dipping his tongue into his belly button and making Draco huff out a giggle before mouthing at the bone of his hip.
There was a black knitted jersey with a few holes in it, artfully so, and an oversized black shirt with pink lettering on the front reading
"Sure thing," the bartender moved away to get their order and Draco turned his head toward Harry, completely ignoring the man who had been there before.
He loved letting himself just fall like this, something he'd never been able to do and had only dreamed about doing before he had finally fallen into bed with Harry.
"So perfect for daddy, hm?" Harry couldn't help how low his voice came out, and his wrist snapped without even really thinking about it, slapping down hard against Draco's ass, making the blonde yelp and surge forward, nearly face planting the pillows again before he caught himself, palms shoving into the mattress. Harry did it again, twice more, and then once on the other ass cheek and he loved the way that the red was already rising against the skin. "So pretty," he hummed out, leaning forward and kissing the warm skin, Draco making a choked sound, his arms wobbling as they tried to hold him steady, elbows feeling as though they were going to give out.
," he breathed.
Draco could only gurgle in response, twitching and trying not to jerk his hips upward even though he was throbbing and leaking as Harry gave him a slight reprieve to take in an adjusting breath, petting his hair.
"Hey," he said with an awkward smile, his cheeks red, his blonde hair adorably fluffy from sleep, and his body swamped in one of Harry's sweatshirts.
pretty baby, right?" Harry licked at his collarbone before his teeth were pressing against the bone.

made him feel immature and a bit small, and not in the best way, so he just fell quiet. "Yeah."
"So," Harry said, and his voice wasn't heavy, and Draco didn't feel trapped even though he knew what was coming. "Are you okay, Draco?" He didn't like that so much, he preferred when Harry had been calling him baby, or sweetheart, but he knew Harry had just been calming him down before. He knew that wasn't something he just...Had a right to. "What's going on?"
"This...morning?" Draco frowned towards the window, but the weather had been murky all week, and the clouds were all grey and heavy outside, he wasn't sure what time it was.
Harry's thrusts were almost brutal with how hard he began to thrust and Draco's more petite body instantly began to jerk forward on the bed, completely at Harry's mercy as the brunette gripped his hips and pulled him back to meet his thrusts.
"You're perfect," Harry whispered, nose softly bumping his, and Draco opened his watery eyes, meeting Harry's, and there was such adoration showing there that more tears began falling. Harry's expression was so soft, and he just smiled gently, giving Draco another close mouthed kiss before he began to move with more earnest. Draco's eyes widened in surprise and Harry's smile turned to something just a little darker. "That good, baby?"
"G-green, daddy," Draco managed with a hoarse voice and Harry smiled and kissed his cheek before pressing his fingers back in, smoothly filling Draco's mouth right until his knuckles were pressing up against his teeth, and he could see ink lines of the lilies and crabs tattooed over his daddy's hand when he looked down his nose.
"Yeah...Thanks," he mumbled and Harry nodded, tugging Draco's hand to the side, to a door that was generally partially shut when Draco had been there and he'd never actually looked inside, and then he let go of Draco's hand and pushed open the door, flipping on the light.
Harry still held his hand, even as he looked for the words, fingers gripping his own.
"He w-was?" Draco managed to ask.
"Yes," Draco sounded almost breathless as he rolled over on the bed and struggled to push himself up on his elbows and knees despite how shaky he felt. "I did!" He tried to get one hand underneath him to struggle with the buttons of his tight jeans, but he was barely able to hold himself up as it was, and he almost lurched forward and face planted the pillows and covers.
"Same as last time, okay, baby?" Harry murmured, nosing just under his ear. "You tell me if there's anything you don't like?" Draco stuttered out an affirmative sound. "We're going to need a safe word later on, but you don't need to think about that right now." Draco's eyes nearly rolled back into his head at the idea of

"When you left, baby," Harry huffed against his lips as he nipped at his bottom lip. "
Smoking helped, it was why he had started smoking in the first place and why he still picked up the habit when he was particularly stressed, because it forced him to breathe deep, hold, and then exhale slowly, even though he wasn't really thinking about it.
And that was enough.
Almost as soon as they got in the shower, Harry's hands were turning Draco around, making him face the warm spray and step underneath it, reaching down to pick up one of the body washes and poured some of the lotion his hand before straightening up and his hands were suddenly sliding up Draco's back and a moan was sliding from the blondes lips before he could even think about, his cheeks heating up straight away.
It sounded selfish.
He could feel himself sinking, only really focused on the slight strain of his knees, where they were bent and resting on the pillow, and on Harry's hand when it went to his hair, stroking absently every now and then before gripping the back of Draco's neck in a way that made Draco's stomach squeeze every time, resting it there.
And stupid.

. And...It was perfect, you know?" He looked out of the corner of his eye at Harry and he saw Harry duck his head and smile at his knees. The weight on his chest felt just a little lighter in that moment. "Everything that happened between us was perfect, and I've never—I've never felt as good as I did a-and having that with

—" Draco's words were slurred and muffled and he could see the proud smile on Harry's face as he sent Draco closer to the edge.
"Are you hungry?" Harry asked as he pulled on a shirt and then moved to stand in front of Draco. Draco shook his head and then paused as he felt a rumble in his stomach. Harry just smiled. "Alright, how about I order us something to eat—we will get an early dinner, and while we wait, you kneel for me?"
He fell asleep almost immediately.
"Donuts," Harry decided.

how turned on Harry was
"I've been thinking about you all week, baby. Been missing you," Harry murmured before slick fingers were suddenly pressed at his hole, prodding gently to test how stretched he was before pressing inside together, and Draco couldn't stop his guttural moan. "Sound so, so pretty, baby…" Harry rubbed one hand up and down Draco's spine in a soothing motion as his fingers began to move faster inside Draco, steadily pushing inside him. "And you open for me so easily."
"Let's shower, yeah?" Harry murmured against his hair and Draco just nodded, glad that Harry wasn't pushing it, wasn't expecting him to open up, something that Pansy frequently did, even after all these years of friendship. He knew that was just her love language and the way she operated and it was something that he was used to after all this time, but it was nice to have someone who adapted to what
"Daddy," he corrected himself, his own voice quiet, waiting for Harry's acknowledgment, and when Harry's smile spread back across his face, eyes sparkling from the light in the lamp, and his whole body just relaxed back into the duvet cover and pillows underneath him. He realized that the tension that had tightened in his shoulders wasn't anything like what was usually there, it wasn't the panicked anxiety that he got so often when he was at work, or at a big event with his parents, or just facing off against his father across the dinner table that he used to have to sit at growing up. It hadn't been completely overwhelming, just a slight jolt, and Harry's smile and the clear happiness and arousal on his face instantly soothed it away. "Daddy," he repeated again softly, more to himself, but when he focused his eyes back on Harry, crouched between his legs, he felt even softer, fuzzier, floatier, because
, daddy, daddy—" he began wiggling underneath Harry, trying to arch his back and push his ass up further and there was a chuckle, a little dark, that reached his ears and made him whine even louder.
His mind started to fuzz over a little in the corners, the way he loved it happening but had rarely ever allowed before Harry, and he just let it happen, knowing that Harry would take care of him.
"When you were taking your expensive town car across the city to the club, sitting in the back seat with your prim and proper driver, could you feel it inside you?" Harry asked, and Draco's eyes widened as he stared unseeingly ahead at Harry's words. "When that prick was trying to talk to you at the bar...He could barely take his eyes off you, baby." Draco
It was his fault.

they had known each other—but Harry seemed to decide against it and started filling the smoothie machine.
Draco felt as though he was floating on air by the time Harry straightened up and shuffled him slightly out from under the water so that he could finally step under it himself—it hadn't even processed in Draco's mind that through the whole washing process Harry hadn't been under the warm spray at all, simply getting anything that splashed off his lover.
hearing Harry refer to himself as that, it made his entire brain just short circuit for one blissful second.
Just those words simply enough were nearly enough to have him melting through the floor.
His heart was squeezing in his chest, his stomach felt as though it was going to fall to his feet and he was barely able to keep back the tears that were hot behind his eyes.
Harry paused, and Draco's cheeks
Harry pushed his cock right to the back of Draco's throat again, knowing that Draco could take it, especially since he had just been taking his fingers, and he smiled as the blonde gagged slightly and his eyes teared up, stroking his forehead and his hair before looking back up at the TV, as though his attention was easily drifting away.
His face was soft and gentle as Draco's hazy eyes landed on him, and Harry put down the bottle of water before throwing the blanket over them, and then he slid into bed next to Draco.
"Thank you, daddy," Draco mumbled, his words still sounding thick and his tongue dry in his mouth.
," Harry told him, before he was moving away again.
But then Harry was shoving back inside him, filling him up, and pleasure was fraying at every nerve ending in Draco's body and he let out a strangled cry, his body jerking and back arching, weakly trying to push back against Harry in search of more friction, but Harry just made a cooing noise behind him before he was kissing Draco's shoulder and then a big hand was circling around Draco's cock, nearly making him pass out at the white-hot pleasure that came with finally being touched.
"You ready?" He whispered, and Draco's thighs quivered, he felt the muscles clenching and releasing as the lace of his panties was tugged against his sensitive skin and the the head of Harry's cock bumped against his hole, before sliding down between his cheeks.
"Sure thing," he said quietly.
you were looking at me but you would go all red when I looked back at you and would pretend that you were looking somewhere else, but—I get that now, right?" Draco swallowed so hard his throat clicked as Harry lifted his chin with a gentle finger underneath. "I get you?"

The clean up afterwards was usually a bit hazy, and that wasn't anything different tonight.
"You've done so well for me, Draco...The food is almost here, baby," Harry murmured, the words all settling over Draco nicely. "You want to sit on the couch or the floor as you eat?" Draco made a humming noise as he considered, not quite ready to open his eyes just yet, but he could feel that his knees and thighs were beginning to ache slightly, and he wasn't sure what Harry would have planned for later, so he didn't want to be too sore. "Up on the couch?" Harry asked and Draco nodded and Harry kissed his jaw before leaning back and then getting up off the couch before moving to stand in front of Draco. "Let me help you, baby," he said and Draco opened his eyes slowly, to Harry holding out his hands.
"That's right, sweetheart," Harry's fingers suddenly slid out of Draco and the blonde whined and wiggled his hips from side to side subconsciously, trying to lift his head and look over his shoulder, but it felt too heavy and he gave up and just let it hang down, between his shoulders. "It's okay, baby, let daddy take care of you," Harry whispered, and he was pulling Draco's cheeks further apart with lube-sticky fingers, his body shifting on the bed behind him, the mattress dipping and his thighs being shoved further apart almost carelessly, even though Draco knew that Harry would never let him faceplant into the mattress when he was feeling this shaky. "You ready for me, baby?"
, Draco,

When Harry started moving, slowly thrusting inside Draco, not pulling out fully, but grinding his hips in rotating circles when he was pushed all the way back in, Draco's noises turned to whines, and his thighs clenched on either side of Harry's torso, trying to arch off the mattress, fingers scrabbling at Harry's back, probably leaving possessive, red marks but that wasn't something he was thinking about right now.
Draco loved being marked.
He knew that the word impacted Harry a lot, just like it did with him, even if maybe it didn't mean exactly to him what it did to Draco.
Draco jolted as he remembered who Harry was talking about, and the possessive tone in Harry's voice was still right there, present at the surface.

"Did you want them to kiss you?" Harry asked gently.
He trusted Harry.
"I wanted it for a long time, what happened that night," it was hard to get the words out, but Harry's fingers got tighter around his. "I wanted it
Despite the fact that Pansy had literally been swept up in memories of Katie just a few minutes ago, once they got to the table that Harry, Hermione and Ron had found for them, a tall blonde was making eyes at Pansy and she looked as though she wasn't going to be with them for much longer.
Draco felt tears flood to his eyes, and he sniffed in a way that was incredibly unattractive, but Harry didn't pull back.
"You're doing so good for me, baby, you're such a good boy," Harry whispered, his voice husky as he pulled off Draco's cock, Draco clenching and whining at the words of praise. "Do you think you're ready for me now?"
Harry had been the only one to tattoo Draco, and Draco wanted him to be the only one to pierce him as well.
, but he was babbling and he couldn't stop and he felt as though he was going to ascend to some higher plane as Harry cooed and pressed a wet kiss to the tip of his cock. Calling Harry '
Draco nodded and tried not to think about how unfair it was that Harry had such a close relationship with his ex-girlfriend, even though Ginny Weasley was great and treated his cousin like a goddess on earth.
"And I'm yours, baby, okay? Just me and you," Harry whispered, and Draco liked that, liked that Harry was just as genuine, was promising him that same exclusivity. "Let's go inside—come on."
number, and she thought that you would be coming to see me," there was a tinge of pride in Harry's voice, and Draco's heart beat faster at that, one of his eyes cracking open.
, but he was too shy to ask just yet.
Draco turned on the lamp as he sat down on the edge of Harry's bed, curling his toes into his socks and further into the carpet below him as he waited.
"Good boy," Harry whispered, kissing the side of Draco's head as he sat him down on the couch, resting against the cushions and the soft throw over the back. "I'm just going to get us some drinks, okay? I will be right back."
"I—uh," Draco swallowed. "...
For Draco.
He said so.
, right from the roots, so that Draco's head was pulled off the bed, his face exposed to the cooler, less stifled air of the room, and he was cut off as he heaved in a deep breath.
," Draco's voice shook slightly. "Well, yes—I just—" he broke off, breathing out and dropping his eyes before groaning and pulling one of his hands away from Harry's so that he could rub his fist at his teary eye. "
Draco's stomach swooped and clenched as Harry's tongue came out and flicked over his tattoo, the ink that Harry had stained there himself, and he tried to relax, to settle, just like Harry had said, but it was fucking

"What happened tonight, sweetheart?" Harry asked softly, fingertips sliding down gently his cheek before cupping his jaw. "What's going on in your head?"
, and then Harry was
Harry caught him, and pulled him backwards easily, so that he was back on his knees, and he couldn't help but giggle at the easy help, head feeling light and fingers feeling almost disconnected from the rest of his body.
Harry lit the end of Draco's joint first, then his own, and then pulled a water bottle out of his hoodie pocket that it had been half shoved in, resting it between them, before they sat in quiet to smoke.
," Harry growled, and Draco bit his lower lip so hard with his teeth that he could taste blood, toes and fingers clenched as he tried to stave of his orgasm, as he felt Harry continue to fuck him through his orgasm, the sound of come joining together with the lube becoming sloppy. "
it came out slurred and muffled around Harry's fingers, and just around Draco's thick tongue in general, words beginning to escape him. "I wan—
The pair of them didn't stay as late as Pansy wanted to, although they stayed later than Hermione and Ron, because Ron had work the next day, but neither Draco or Harry wanted to leave her to dance and drink by herself and convinced her to let them pour her into a town car and send her toward her apartment before they started walking back to Harry's place, hand-in-hand.
"She's working at this office that's only about a block down from that coffee shop I like, actually, so…I might just have to go by there even more often," Pansy wiggled her eyebrows before looking up happily at the drinks that were being pushed across the counter. "Okay, you guys have a head start. Get us a table and me and Dray will be there soon!"
as he was pushed further up the bed. Harry moved himself smoothly, pushing up a little further on his knees so that there was some space between them, and then his fingers were skating lightly down Draco's chest, and more tears began to fall as his thumb pressed into the wet, weeping head of his cock, forefinger circling around. "You've been so good for me, baby. So good for daddy, pretty baby, in your pretty panties," Harry whispered and Draco's chest

blanketing Draco's body, pinning him to the bed, his hips shoved down
"Want you to take care of me, daddy," Draco's breathing hitched as one of Harry's fingers began to stroked up the inside seam of his pants, getting closer and closer to the lap of his pants. "Want—
It felt as though the only parts of him that he could focus on were where his body was connected with Harry's, and his neglected cock, and even then, his head felt as though it had been wrapped in cotton wool that was slowly enveloping him body.
Harry didn't leave him waiting long, he never did, he knew how Draco's mind sometimes started overworking if he was left too long, and when he came in, Draco's eyes instantly snapped to him, hyper-aware of every movement as he moved to stand in front of him.
"Aw, baby," Harry's movements didn't stop, his hips snapping forward even as he somehow managed to adjust himself over Draco's body, with one knee pressed deep into the bed beside Draco's hip to give himself better leverage. "You already sound so pretty for me…" his voice rasped, his voice already sounding so much deeper than it had just a few moments ago. "You already sound so needy, baby."
They got up to the counter, and it was a grumpy teenager working, who had obviously pulled the graveyard, weekend shift, and Harry ordered a dozen donuts for them to take home, flipped his wallet out of his back pocket and slid out his card with just one hand, the other arm still tightly around Draco's waist, and he was smiling easily at the grumpy teenager who was
now, it was just...Wrapped up in Harry's arm felt like he was being tethered to the earth in a way that he had never really experienced before he had been with Harry.
He felt Harry move a few times, stop drawing and do something else with the hand that wasn't on Draco's neck, but he wasn't focusing on it, just letting himself sink further into his head, into a space that was safe and warm, where he really didn't have any other thoughts.
, and that wasn't something...That wasn't something he'd been able to experience before.
"Here," Harry handed him over a few things. "Get changed in here, I'll roll us some joints, okay?"
Whenever Harry addressed himself as
"Draco?" Harry's voice was a little confused, but it was still kind and even and that made Draco's eyes sting. "Are you okay?"
It was almost half an hour later, when Draco's eyelids were heavy and his mind was completely wrapped up in
"Are you thirsty?" He asked quietly, and Draco nodded ever so slightly, his head still feeling so heavy, and almost detached from his neck. Harry smiled as he picked up the water bottle, and he held it to Draco's lips, helping him drink while sliding a hand behind his head and cupping it to make sure his throat was open and he didn't choke. "Feel okay?" He asked and Draco managed another small nod as Harry took away the bottle and put it on the bedside table, turning off the light and sliding down so he was laying next to Draco.

"Go to the bedroom, hm?" Harry prompted him with a pat on his ass before the brunette was walking toward the kitchen with the bag of donuts in hand. Draco watched him go, eyes flicking between looking at Harry's
. He didn't sound mad, and Draco opened his eyes that he hadn't realized he had closed. "It's okay. Whatever you're feeling, it's okay. Just take a breath, and talk when you're ready, yeah?" Draco blinked at him because there was something in his voice and his eyes that managed to make his mind slow down again. "Did you want something to smoke?" Harry asked suddenly.
"Yeah, I—" Draco cut off, swallowing down and hoping that his words weren't going to ruin the happy buzz that they were sharing. "You're my daddy, right?" He asked quietly and Harry was silent for a moment before he was pulling away, and Draco's stomach dropped for a second and his entire body clenched until Harry was leaning over him, getting in close so that their noses were touching and Draco could make out his glittering eyes in the pale light that was coming through the thin curtains.

As he

"Are you okay?" He asked, worry lacing his words.
he was to his father, and his boss, and his extended family with their scrutinizing eyes.
He'd been the one to fuck things up to begin with.
, alright?" Draco swallowed hard, and he felt tears stinging at his eyes. "I was at this party tonight, Pansy said that I needed to stop wallowing," he wrinkled his nose, even though he knew that his best friend had only meant to make him feel better. "And there was this guy, and I was dancing, and—" Draco's eyes squeezed shut for a moment and then cut away quickly, looking down at his boots, his bottom lip pouting out a little at the smudge of dirt on one of his Chelsea boots. His voice was low and brittle, the bitterness turned inward. "I was just feeling
Harry didn't bother turning off the lights in the lounge and the kitchen, he didn't go back out to clean up after the smoothies, he just pulled Draco into his room and closed the door behind them and flicked on the lamp beside his bed.
!" Draco blurted out in a high pitched whine that drew another dark chuckle from Harry and made Draco's shoulders feel as though they were going to give out. Harry's fingers suddenly started pushing into him harder and faster, twisting inside him and the pads of his fingers pressing upward, stroking against his inner walls with firm and knowing digits. Draco had lost count of how many times they'd slept together now, and the knowing way that Harry touched him proved how familiar they had gotten with one another. "J-just you, daddy!"
So much he couldn't have before.
Draco's body shuddered at the contact, the first time his cock had been touched by someone else in a week, since he and Harry had both been busy, and his teeth sunk down hard into his bottom lip as he turned his head to the side, cheek pressing into the duvet cover.
He was still wearing the tight leather pants that Pansy Parkinson had chosen out for him that night, but wearing the sleeping shirt and jersey made him feel instantly more comfortable, especially...Especially since it smelt like the cologne that Harry wore and faintly like the apple shampoo that he used and just a bit like weed.
"Not Harry," Harry's voice was low, and it made heat twist in the pit of Draco's stomach.
, and Draco's stomach tightened because he wondered if Harry had brought it at the Leeds concert that they'd all gone to last year.
"Oh, fuck!" Draco's hands came up, grabbing at Harry's leather jacket, manicured nails digging into the material, trying to find purchase.
"Did it feel good, sweetheart?" Harry asked as he pulled the jeans and panties the rest of the way down Draco's smooth legs and then straightened up, standing over Draco's naked and stretched out body, still dressed other than his shoes, despite Draco being naked in front of him. A shiver ran visibly down Draco's spine and it made Harry smile as he took off his jacket and threw it to the side. "Have you been feeling it stretch you through the night?"
, and he nodded silently. "So perfect, baby," Harry murmured, and suddenly Draco felt warm breath over his cheeks before he nuzzled his nose against Draco's, and Draco's eyelids tried to open, tried to lift so he could see how close Harry was to his face, but then Harry was pressing gentle, chaste kisses against Draco's mouth, his chin, his jaw, and his head just felt s
—yes,
"Good," Harry sounded pleased as he scratched Draco's scalp gently before putting down the water bottle.
"Have you eaten since this morning?" Harry asked as he lead the way back to his bedroom across the hall.
"Hi," Draco said for a third time, and Harry's smile just got wider before he gave Draco's hip a squeeze and let his arm fall to take his wallet out of his back pocket. "Oh, no, I've got it—"
"Aw, sweetheart," Harry crooned, and then there were fingers being shoved into his mouth, not hard enough that he was choking, but enough that his eyes fully rolled back and his body jerked under Harry, attempted to arch even harder, his cock undoubtedly creating a large, wide-spread wet patch on the covers underneath from the way that he was wiggling. "You just can't seem to keep still, can you?" Harry's thrusts were deeper—slower, but deeper, and Draco couldn't help the way his hips urgently were jerking under Harry while his lips and tongue were trying to desperately work over the fingers that Harry was shoving into his mouth, keeping him full and stimulated at both ends. "If only that bastard could see you know," Harry's voice was suddenly darker and hissed and it made Draco's eyes jerk open as he whimpered. "He'd be so jealous of my pretty baby, wouldn't he?"
"Shower," he answered, licking his dry lips and Harry nodded, getting off the bed and straightening up.

, were the last place where I felt...
Harry didn't try and take off his panties, he left them on, but Draco felt them being pulled to the side and fingers slipping underneath them, brushing between his cheeks, and heat was just curling so tightly around his stomach that it felt as though he was only seconds away from an orgasm, like an inexperienced teenager.
in regards to being nervous about his weight or appearance, Harry made a point to assure him that he adored Draco's body just the way it was, and how
He kept himself in shape and he had good stamina, and Draco was lucky enough to reap the benefits of that.
Because it wasn't just Harry he was with.
"I-I'm sorry that I fucked things up w-with us," Draco stammered out. "I-I'm sorry I just d-disappeared." Harry's body stilled next to him and Draco felt even
idea," he sounded strained and Draco tried to help, he tried to lifted himself up onto his elbows so that Harry could take off his jersey easier, but his whole body just wasn't working, everything felt as though it was both lighter and heavier at the same time and signals that his brain was trying to send to his limbs were being interrupted by the cotton wool that was filling his veins. "You're just...So
"Um...No," he shook his head, and then let out another shuddery breath that he hoped was quiet, but when his eyes lifted, his gaze met Harry's.
"Come, baby," Harry murmured, applying more pressure and Draco's hips began to snap forward faster, even though his movements still felt sluggish and absently he knew that really, he wasn't moving that quickly at all. "Come for your daddy, love."
"Yes, daddy," Draco promised, loving the way Harry kept checking in with him, speaking so gently.
And Harry was insisting, and Harry didn't do things he didn't want to, and Harry

But Pansy had literally been listening to Draco drone on about Harry since he had come into their lives years ago, and...They both also knew that his time with her tonight was going to be limited.

about the little boy because he'd seen the interaction between him and Harry, and he'd seen pictures of them together, and he'd heard Harry gush adoringly about him, and it honestly just made Draco's heart melt,
and the horrible morning that he'd had was almost completely gone now.
It had felt that way within
There was no way Draco was going to be able to verbalize anything now.
—I always want to look at you. Always want to kiss you," Harry threw Draco's pants on the ground, and then finally took off his socks, stroking his fingers under the arch of Draco's feet, pressing his thumbs in briefly and making Draco moan and twitch. "Always want to touch you. Always—god, you
!" Draco gasped, and Harry hummed in response, the noise content and the sensation
Harry undressed Draco slowly,
it had been, which just made him feel worse and he ducked down so fast he felt dizzy, to snatch up the keys from the ground and quickly straighten back up, shaking his head to try and clear his eyes as he finally grasped the right key and shoved it into the lock.
Shampoo was massaged into his scalp, and then soap made his skin all slippery and easy for Harry's fingers to slide over his skin, under his arms, around to swoop over his stomach, gently but efficiently over his groin in a way that made Draco twitch but not open his eyes, and his body swayed as he felt Harry shift to a kneeling position behind him and give his legs a wash before tapping one ankle at a time, indicating he lift his foot and lean his weight against the wall.
He fell down,
, Draco had to wait behind at the bar, still within breathing distance of Mr Fake Gucci, to hear all about the two minute conversation that Pansy had had with Katie, which really could have waited until later.
"That's good," Harry whispered and he leaned forward and gave him a kiss on the forehead. "I'm going to have a quick shower. Did you want to have one with me, or you want to stay in bed?"
Harry just
"I promise," Draco murmured, and it was his turn to squeeze Harry's hand. "I
"I'll just shut it most the way so that the heat doesn't escape...But we don't get locked out," Harry explained as he slid the window down until it was only cracked open, and then they sat down on the wooden fire escape stairs, five storeys above the ground. "Here you go," Harry said, holding out one joint to Draco, gripping another one between two fingers before propping it between his lips, and then he pulled out a lighter from his pocket, a neon pink one that had a black and white sticker that read
time ago. "Let me hear everything you've got for me, yeah?"
Winking and pink between Draco's pretty, pale cheeks, was the glittery plug that Draco had worked into himself in one of the private bathrooms before he had left to go to the bar that evening.
He sort of lost track of time, Harry holding his head and moving it, his fingers pressed down his throat and heavy against his tongue, and he knew that he was drooling down his chin and around Harry's fingers but he really didn't care, his whole mind and body felt simultaneously heavy and light at the same time and it was incredible.
"That's right, baby," Harry's messy brown hair was tickling Draco's neck and his ear as he nuzzled his face into the curve of Draco's neck. "Mine."
Draco was in the kitchen, ingredients out of the cupboard and a sheepish expression on his face from where he was kneeling, having accidentally tugged out about four plastic bowls and they'd tumbled out onto the ground.
"Thank you," Draco said softly as he followed Harry into the kitchen area, his toes curling into the bottom of his Chelsea boots, trying to ground himself as he pressed his fingernails into the palms of his hands.
With his eyes shut, it made his other senses flare, hyper aware of the scritching sound of Harry's pencil on his paper as he sketched tattoo ideas, and the heat of Harry's hand on the back of his neck, although not so much the background noise of the TV.
Draco didn't even feel it as the new tear welled, it was only when it escaped from the corner of his eye and fell that he realized it was there.
," Harry's voice was suddenly smooth and soothing like a salve, and his hand was moving up and down Draco's back, warm through the Balenciaga blazer and the silk shirt that he was wearing underneath. "Take a few breaths—it's okay, it's okay," Harry whispered and his voice was just so deep and nice and it made Draco feel even
"Open up for me, yeah, sweetheart?" Harry murmured, lifting an eyebrow expectantly and Draco felt heat instantly gather in his lower stomach, drool pooling in his mouth as he opened up properly, so that Harry could slide two fingers inside. "That's good," he whispered. "Get them nice and wet for daddy, yeah?"
He liked the smile that Harry gave him in response.
"Waffles sound fucking perfect, baby."
glowering at them as she passed over their donuts once the transaction cleared.
He'd been the one to let Harry slip through his fingers when he finally had a chance.
. I've...
The smoothie machine was loud, and Draco flinched when it started even though he had been expecting it, but once he was done, Harry still softly apologized, even though it wasn't
There was a chuckle behind him and then one of the hands on his ass moved briefly, before Draco heard the familiar sound of the lube cap being snapped open, and his body buzzed in excitement.
Harry was looking up at him from where he was crouched by his feet, and there were wrinkles at the corners of his eyes from the way he was smiling up at Draco and Draco chewed down on his bottom lip, feeling a little flustered at Harry's expression.
"You're
"What?" Draco's nose wrinkled.
It has only been twice, and one of those times Draco knew full well Harry had been holding back.
It was his daddy…
Harry didn't have to tell Draco that, reassure him that he wasn't going to be far and that he was going to return quickly, but he knew that those reassurances—just those few words from him—they helped him keep floating, knowing that his daddy wasn't going to be far.
"Yeah," he managed to say through a clogged throat.
He knew that.
," Harry hissed out before he was lunging forward and they were kissing, Harry's hands burning over Draco's body. They felt as though they were never moving, squeezing his hips, groping his ass, pulling his hair, scratching his thighs, and his
He still remembered things that Harry had said to him from their first time together.
pretty—
"What are you doing here, Dray?" Harry asked softly and Draco's whole body tensed up, and he instantly felt pressure behind his eyes, staring resolutely down at the pink concoction in his smoothie glass so that Harry wouldn't see that his eyes were already starting to blur a little from tears as he felt the sting of rejection that he knew was going to come.
"Yeah, baby, you feel so good," Harry murmured, thrusts getting harder, cock warm and hard and unrelenting as he got harder although not much faster, and Draco's eyes rolled back, all words gone, only able to whimper out '
, and the tears spilled over, down his cheek, and he was absently glad that Pansy Parkinson had always insisted that he wore waterproof eyeliner and mascara or else he was going to have hideous tracks down his cheeks. "No, no," Harry sounded upset and then he was moving again, kneeling in front of Draco and Draco blinked, pulling back, hands coming up to try and cover his face but Harry was stopping him. "No, baby, stop that," he said, taking Draco's hands in his own, rubbing them in his calloused palms, and circling his thumb against the back of Draco's hand.
," Draco whined out, looking back and trying to narrow his eyes, but he probably just looked pouty.
, and we
He had no idea what he had done to deserve Harry but for some reason, Harry kept insisting, over and over again, that he didn't want to be anywhere else, except at Draco's side.
Over the past few months, getting to know each other and letting himself open up a lot more, and actually
..." Harry's voice sounded breathy and it made Draco's cheeks heat. He could feel Harry moving slightly, the mattress dipping on either side of him but he didn't want to open his eyes, leaving everything up to Harry, and then he felt Harry's cup his cheek, a finger touching his bottom lip and then warm breath blowing gently over his chin. "You are
"No, daddy," he mumbled.
Draco's body stiffened, pissed off although not entirely surprised that the guy had decided to actually move in and touch him, and was prickling up to tell him that there was no way in hell he would go home with a man like him, when a deeper voice spoke.
He just felt overwhelmed in the best way, his cheeks hot and tears behind his eyelids and his fingers were curling and unfurling into the duvet cover underneath him, and he let out a gasp as the third finger was slipped inside, the pinch making his spine twinge slightly, but then Harry leaned forward and his mouth was enveloping the head of Draco's cock.
He smiles a wicked smile at me.
“But I’m worried you’ll hurt me.”
“That was nice of you Ron.” I tell him as we are heading for the next room.
“You know, when you fell into my office to interview me, you were all ‘yes sir’, ‘no sir’. I thought you were a natural-born submissive. But quite frankly, Draco, I’m not sure you have a submissive bone in your delectable body.” He moves slowly towards me as he speaks, his voice tense.
“Thanks Hermione. Don’t tell anyone though, apart from Ron.”  She agrees and leaves us to it.
I get up and quickly put a feather light spell on Draco so I can carry him fast. I pick him up and go quickly to the door. By the time I get to the front room, Katie is already there with her wand in hand.
“Yes alright Hermione, I’m sorry I’m ‘skittish’ but if you don’t remember i went through a war not knowing whether i would live or die or what was around the next corner. So please excuse my jumpy-ness. Now what do you want?”
“Why are you sorry. I basically caused you to have a, what was it, a panic attack.” He says slowly, trying the name out for the first time.
Sorry it's late, I was on holiday. I've done my best to edit any mistakes. Hope you like it. Thank you for all the kudos and lovely comments. X
“Good. I’m gonna have to wake him now though to check him over, alright?”
“I will, don’t worry.” I lean down to kiss his again and can see his erection has deflated a bit. While I’m snogging his mouth I put my hand between us and try to get him excited once more. He gets back into it rather quickly then.
“Oh - I don't know…..it seems to have a very beneficial effect on you.”
“Hermione was right you know.” I said to Draco.
“Okay babe?” I ask him when he leans back against me. I put my arms under his armpits and take his hand over his chest. He squeezes them and nods.
“Not with all this noise.” I say to Leo and blow raspberries on his belly. He screams with laughter and throws his head back. Draco laughs at us and we head back around the front.
“I promise love.” We head downstairs and go through the floo to the hospital.
“Draco…...I……” He doesn’t carry on and the anguish in his voice makes me look up. He runs a hand through his hair and he looks frustrated. All his careful control has disappeared.
“What happened?” Hermione asks while Ron says at the same time. “Is Draco and the baby okay?” I tell them what happened at the scan. I didn’t know how much I needed to talk to them until they were here.
My eyes reluctantly open. She’s not just up - she’s been for a run. I grab my wand and cast a tempus. It’s eight in the morning. Holy shit, I’ve slept for a solid nine hours.
“Yes and Merlin knows when the next time he’ll sleep that much.” Molly says. We chuckle and drink our tea.
I must make a noise then because he cuts off all of a sudden and turns around to face me. His face is covered in tears and he looks shocked to find someone else here. I stand up straight immediately and look confused at him. He turns around to wipe his face discreetly.

The Dominant may flog, spank, whip, or corporally punish the Submissive as he sees fit, for purposes of discipline, for his own personal enjoyment, or for any other reason, which he is not obliged to provide.
He still has my hand in his and I turn back to look at the school again. I try to see it in his eyes. He used to live here too and probably considered it home much like I do at the moment, but this is one of the last times I’ll see it like this and I’m sure he hardly gets to see it either.
“You spoke to my mother behind my back!” He cuts me off and pulls his hand away. I reel back slightly confused.
“Bye grandma!” He hugs her now too and then she’s gone.
“How many people?” I blurt out the questions, but I couldn’t help it, I was curious.
Then all of a sudden I’m being pushed out of the way and tumble down the hill with something on top of me.
This time when we land Draco is sick. We knock on the door and Lottie answers.
“Nothing. I’m fine, I just got a bit of dust in my eye... I saw this piano in here and just wanted to see if it works.” He stood up and closed the piano and then attempted to move past me. I scuttled in front of him before he could get out the door.
Pansy and I concentrate on packing, sharing a bottle of cheap red wine as we do. When I finally go to bed, having almost finished packing my room, I feel calmer. The physical activity of boxing everything up has been a welcome distraction, and I’m tired. I want a good night’s rest. I snuggle into my bed, try to wandlessly turn off the lights but it doesn't work - I will keep trying to do at least one wandless spell, and shock Harry - and am soon asleep.
As we are heading upstairs, I ask Draco something I’ve been wanting to for a couple of weeks.
“Oh Andromeda, you must hold him!” Narcissa says and comes over to place the baby in her sister's arms.
“Tell me.” He commands.
“There you are. What do you think of this for Nia’s bedroom?” He only has a T-shirt and joggers on today and his T-shirt is riding up a bit to show his belly. I wonder if he knows Neville is here.
“I want to be alone.” He continues crying.
“I will be back in a moment. You two...enjoy yourselves.”
I groan again. He pulls out and moves slowly back into me, circling his hips once more against my prostate.
Harry Potter
“Where are you Draco?”
“Shhh, go back to sleep. I’m sorry I woke you.” Draco whispered back. So maybe it’s not a dream then. I need to explain about the house and tell him I’m sorry. I sit up a tiny bit so I can see his face properly.
“Morning dragon.” I purr to him. He’s the one blushing now and gives a little groan.
I scowl at her but can’t keep a straight face. We both burst into a fit of giggles.
“Blaise, the photographer?” Harry’s eyes narrow, his face frosting.
“Not having….sex?” I can’t believe I actually just said that. I blush.
“CAN WE GO TO THE PARK AND FEED THE DUCKIES!” He shouts while jumping up and down excitedly. I laugh and pick him up for a hug.
“You’d prefer cold cod to me?”
“Well I…” He goes a bit shy then and looks down at his shoes. “I had a really good time today, thank you everyone. My presents were lovely and the party was brilliant.” He looks up again now, getting a bit of confidence back. “But it wouldn’t have been possible without my uncle Harry and my uncle Draco. They are some of the greatest people I know and whoever disagrees shouldn’t come to my house anymore…. and well, they are going to be great dads!” He finishes his speech then. I was smiling all the way through until that last sentence. Merlin Teddy, he really didn’t get things sometimes.
He cups my chin again and starts to kiss my throat as before. Oh….he’s so frustrating. His hands run down my body and over my nipples as he reaches the dip at the base of my neck with his lips. He swirls the tip of his nose around it then begins a very leisurely cruise with his mouth, heading south, following the path of his hands, down my sternum to my nipples. Each one is kissed and nipped gently and sucked. Holy crap. My hips start thrusting into the air, moving of their own accord, grinding to the rhythm of his mouth on me, and I’m desperately trying to remember to keep my hands above my head.
“Hey, it’s okay. You are safe.” He says these words slowly and strokes my knuckles with one of his hands. “Come on, open your eyes. The view is amazing.” For some reason I do as he asks and with his touch I feel slightly calmer. I look down and around once more and my eyes go wide with wonder. Scotland, from this height, is beautiful. Harry turns around briefly to look at me and smiles, then turns back around and I feel rather than hear him chuckle.
“Harry! What the hell happened in here?” Draco asked, a bit hysterical. I kept my head on the floo and just pointed to the cat. “Why is crookshanks here? And why has he destroyed your living room?”
“That sounds perfect love.”
“Ow Draco what the…” I turn round to frown at him but instead I see his frightened face from before. “Hey, it's okay. I’m here.” I take his hand off my arm and keep it in my hand.
Now, however, as we both stand there in a total state of shock, I’m distantly playing the screaming match I’m going to have with Hermione in my head. She is so dead. I slowly look over at Draco to try and gauge his reaction. I know what he’s seeing because I’m seeing it for the first time and it does not look good. While I’m planning hermiones murder, Draco is definelty planning mine, and this time I’m not sure I don’t blame him. This is like a completely different house to what I saw in the pictures and what I was imagining. The first thing was the door which is hanging loosely off the hinges and has cracks all through just the back of it which was quite convenient for the photos they showed me at the estate agency. We’re probably going to need a new door. The next thing was the floors, well the lack of floor would be more accurate. Whoever had lived here before had decided to take up all the wood flooring with them and leave us to deal with the rest. Next was the fact that where the rest of the doors should have been were just empty passages. Note to self - find out how much doors for a whole house costs (probably not cheap). As I stood there and thought that was all for now, I looked around to Draco but stopped half way and looked at the stairs. What was there was mostly okay actually but every couple of steps one was missing and just had a hole instead. The steps that were left I wouldn’t trust not to fall right through, they were definitely not safe. This was a nightmare and this was only the hall!
"Yeah," Harry nodded as he picked up the remote from the chipped coffee table that had some tidily stacked piles of magazines and papers and some pens and pencils balanced on top, and Draco wanted to go through the papers because it kind of looked like they were sketches, but he forced himself not to snoop. "Most of my cushions are, Gin is always bringing them over."
His whole body just melted into Harry's side, and Harry moved him so easily, as though he weighed nothing, onto his lap with his hand pressed against Draco's head, so that he laid it down against Harry's shoulder.
It was actually working, calming him down, until he remembered that while he had been at his aunts for brunch, and then at his boyfriends sleeping...Harry had been working, and then probably looking for him and worrying when he couldn't find him, and now he was looking after him first, before even showering off the work grime, and Draco could feel the tension all beginning to return to his shoulders.
"Baby…" there were soft fingers stroking through Draco's hair and he was completely disorientated in the best way as he woke up slowly, a smile already pulling up his lips at the familiar voice. But as he turned over, there were wrinkles of concern on Harry's face as he stretched over him, and Draco suddenly remembered that he wasn't really supposed to be here. Not like Harry had ever said he couldn't be in his
, and I-I just feel
"What can I get you?" The bartender finally reached Draco, and he opened his mouth to place his order when a hand was suddenly falling on his hip.
," Draco squeaked out, hips jutting up against Harry's, desperately seeking friction. "
"He was," Harry responded instantly, hands still moving, groping at Draco's sides, squeezing the back of his neck and making Draco's cock jerk upward and begin to leak. "He couldn't take his eyes off you," Harry's hands both trailed down to Draco's hips, gripping him there firmly for a moment before his thumbs were gripping at his ass. "I don't blame him," he continued quietly, tanned fingers pressing into the pale skin as he pulled Draco's cheeks apart so that he had an unobstructed view of the pink gem at the end of the plug and the slightly shiny skin around it. "The only times I
She wouldn't have done it with any kind of malicious intent, but even after all of these years, and everything that they had been through, she just didn't seem to see that
But now there was jasmine and cherry shampoo along with his coconut one,
It was something else, giving over control to someone that he trusted completely, and he'd only properly experienced it one other time, and that had been with Harry as well.
It felt as though cold water had been dumped over Draco's head and was sinking through the warmth of the jersey and the shirt and his pants and his shoes and his socks and his skin was cold and—
He sounded almost
There was a double bed to one side of the room, and there were dark curtains, but they weren't black, maybe a navy colour if the main lights were turned on, a painting hanging on the wall that was a mix of black and grey and then bright purple mediums, two sets of drawers, and a desk in the corner of the room with lots of papers and both reading and writing books, with pens and pencils spilling all over the place, probably the most untidy spot in the room, but there was still obviously some order to it, and there was a little weed plant in the corner in a ceramic pot that was painted garish shades of yellow and blue and purple.
"I d-didn't—" Draco wasn't even sure he was hearing everything properly. Every word coming from Harry was making him feel as though he was ascending further and further into the clouds. "I didn't know t-that...You felt the same way."
It looked like it.
Draco
His fingers were fumbling with his keys, and then he
Harry's fingers pulled out of him and Draco whined, forcing his eyes open again, and he saw Harry picking up the lube again—the lube that Draco hadn't even realized that Harry had grabbed—and poured it over his fingers, and then the tips of his fingers were pressing back at Draco's hole, gentle but persistent, and it was more than two, and his toes curled as he realized that Harry was beginning to work
Draco followed after him, trailing after him like a puppy on a lead with wide eyes and slumped shoulders, already feeling himself let go even more than he had before, everything in his mind falling away and just focusing on Harry, zeroing in on how he was going to be
"Good boy," Harry's words were clipped and then
"Just wanna be yours, daddy," Draco mumbled, the words coming out so easily it was like breathing and Harry made a noise in this throat that had Draco's cock twitching.
Harry didn't let go of Draco's hand as he jerked the window back up and then almost fell inside, tugging Draco in after them, and when Draco was on his feet, before he had even pulled the window properly back down, Harry shoved his Draco against the wall and was kissing him again, crowding him up beside the sink and mirror, and Draco's breath felt as though it had been completely shoved out of his lungs, in
"I wanna—" Draco almost got the words out, but Harry spread his fingers apart over Draco's tongue, forcing his mouth open wider and spit to spread down his chin. "Da-
Harry didn't say much to him; he changed what was on the TV although left the volume low, and only stroked his fingers through Draco's hair, occasionally giving him a kiss and saying he was a 'good boy', which just made Draco's heart
"T-thank you," Draco managed to get out, his cheeks so red that it felt as though his face was on fire. Harry traced one of his fingers along the front of the silk, eyebrows furrowed, breathing hard and Draco couldn't help but close his eyes again. "
Staying in Harry's bed where it was nice and cozy sounded amazing, but he had overheated and sweated a bit when he had been panicking earlier, and even though he had barely moved while sleeping, he could feel that he was slightly sticky.
And Harry didn't lie.
"You can give my number to your Aunt Bella, that sounds great," Harry continued and he sort of hustled Draco up against the bathroom cabinet with his ass resting on the counter, as he began to dry himself. "Pansy told me that your dad came over and started yelling about the Christmas event that you invited me to," Harry continued, getting back to what he was saying before, and Draco's toes curled a little but he didn't feel anywhere near as anxious as he expected. "She didn't get any other details from your aunt, but I can guess the general core of it," Harry sighed as he slung the towel around his neck and leaned in close, damp locks of hair hanging down over his forehead as he touched his to Draco's. "I want whatever you want here. I'll do whatever you need, okay? And I'm not going to be upset either way." Another tear fell, clumping together a few delicate eyelashes. "If you just want to smooth things over and just do what they want to make it as easy as possible, then I can be with you while you get ready, and then be there when you're done with the event. If you want me to come with you, even if you know it might stir up some trouble, I will be right there with you." Draco took in a shaky breath, unsure how to respond even though Harry was saying all the right words—
And then Harry was leaving, shutting the door behind him, so that Draco had privacy to change, and he swallowed hard as he looked down at what he had been handed.
“Your father? Scary?” Harry cut into Draco’s words. For a second Draco stared at him. He could see the change of lines in his face, could tell he was holding back; but it was only for a short moment, because then he burst out laughing.
It was almost ready when he had another idea. “Oh, it’s so hot in here…” he said, his voice
“Yes, I think I am,” Draco replied. Potter’s hands left him, and he took half a step back, creating a little bit of distance between them. Draco’s waist felt cold where Potter’s hands used to be.
For a second Harry just stared at him, making Draco think he was going to hex him, or, at the very least, hit him; but then he smiled softly, and shrugged. “Yes, I suppose you’re right. We should probably, uh…”
me, as well?”
It gave Draco time to process, and he realized that Harry was still there next to him, and they’d just both made complete fools of themselves. After having kissed.
He suddenly understood how stupid and naive he’d been to think that pretending to date Potter would get Lucius to back off. That maybe Lucius would even understand him and accept him for who he was. That was never going to happen.
