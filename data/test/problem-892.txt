“In the matter of Draco Malfoy versus the Magical Community, we rule that under the guidance of a Ministry approved sponsor, Malfoy may once again use magic at his own discretion.
Malfoy sat still while the rest of his classmates started toward the new quarters, a renovated portion of the seventh floor.
"I shouldn't have reacted like I did," Harry said. "I know I'm not good at telling you things, and when you didn't tell me something, I acted like you'd slighted me personally."
Ron shrugged. “Alright, Mione, but I’ve already been offered jobs and you have too, so I’m going to visit Hagrid and tell him you’re too busy to see him.”
As the boy made his way through the crowd, Harry shook his head. "These kids are going to be the death of me. That or Luna. I can't believe she's got them all looking for wrackspurts."
Potter rubbed the back of his neck. "Are you sure about that? Isn't it a bit much to put me up there with Santa?"
"Stop. I'm not--what do you mean I never asked? You got all touchy any time I brought up next year."
Malfoy stood on the stairs, clearly scanning the crowd for Harry, but his face was shuttered and emotionless. Maybe he’d gotten tired of toying with Harry. But his cool expression had no effect on Harry, who approached him with a grin and took Malfoy’s hand. Harry launched into a description of what had happened during Charms, completely oblivious to the whispers and stares of everyone else in the hallway. Before the two of them turned away, Hermione saw Malfoy’s expression soften and lift into a smile.
This was happening so fast. Ten minutes ago he’d been trying to resign himself to a life of never speaking to Harry again, and now things were going Harry-speed. Draco lifted his wand and pointed it at the ceiling. He opened the books he’d closed on fantasies of having Harry in his own arms. “Expecto Patronum,” he whispered, and a doe made of light and fury sprung from the wand.
"No, of course not," said Hermione. "I simply thought you would like to obtain some goods while on the mainland."
Malfoy chortled and pulled out, leaving Harry wet and sore and feeling oddly empty. He winced and stood up straight. Malfoy swept a refreshing charm over himself, not bothering to perform the small courtesy for Harry.
Draco opened for him willingly, stretching to reach the bottle of lubricant on the side table. He pressed it into Harry's hand and nonchalantly folded his own hands behind his head.
Ineville launched into a sob story.  "He is married, with four children, and his wife cannot manage-"
Hermione reached the last page, sighed in pleasure, and closed the book. She returned it to Draco almost reluctantly. "It's a magnificent gift, Draco," she said.
Hermione nodded. "Muggles, as they're called, use a second name, their family name, as a means of identifying themselves. Minerva and Dumbledore can help you sort that out. What you need to concern yourself with is, what do you plan to take to barter?"
When Harry woke up, he was strapped to a wooden plank, while being tended by a ginger.  "Am I to be held here until I die?" he asked.
Harry was happy to oblige and equally happy to let Draco set the pace. Anything for sex. Draco moved to straddle him, but his sexy smile turned to a grimace. He scrambled off Harry and bolted for the en suite. Harry was left aching and confused. He sat up in time to hear Draco being sick. Lust fled in favor of concern. Harry clambered out of bed, stepped into a pair of pyjama bottoms, and grabbed Draco's robe. He had it ready when Draco plodded out of the loo.
Once again, Lucius seemed to grow and solidify. "Never," he hissed. "It is my mission to haunt Potter until he dies screaming."
Harry was jolted out of a sound sleep when Draco abruptly left the bed and scrambled for the en suite. Early morning light suffused the bedroom, and Harry fumbled for his glasses. He set them on the bridge of his nose just as the first, miserable sounds began emanating from the bathroom. Harry frowned and got up to shuffle to Draco's aid, wincing at the lingering ache that his boyfriend had pounded into him last night. By the time Harry opened the door, Draco was brushing his teeth. Harry leaned against the door jamb and looked on with concern.
Draco's temper was reaching dangerous levels. The lamp on the table next to him began to wobble as he snapped, "Prove it!"
"The odds of it happening without potions are infinitesimal!" Draco exclaimed. "Even you aren't so all-powerful as to impregnate me without the use of potions."
A framed photo on the wall behind Potter caught his eye. Draco leaned forward for a better look. "Is that-"
"It's iocane," said the masked man.  "Odorless and tasteless, it is nevertheless highly poisonous. Pour the wine that is conveniently placed there with those two goblets."
Draco turned to see Harry reclining on the bed.  "Harry!" he cried, flinging himself into his beloved's arms.
Bereft and bewildered, Draco allowed King Albus and Queen Minerva to escort him to the honeymoon suite.  He squeezed their hands and thanked them for the kindness they had shown him during his stay at the castle.
Back in the honeymoon suite, Draco calmly seated himself at a vanity table and withdrew an ornamental dagger from a wooden box.  He drew in a deep breath, grasped the dagger with both hands, and aimed it at his chest.
"Thanks," said Harry, hurrying away to consult with Hermione. He wanted to share Draco's diagnostic results with her for a second opinion.
"What's wrong, loves?" she taunted. "Couldn't open the door?" The woman threw her head back and cackled out a laugh. She planted her hands on her hips and sneered. "What a fine pair of Aurors you are."
"It wasn't supposed to happen this way," Draco continued. "You were supposed to propose to me in some ridiculously romantic way, then we would get married in a ceremony for the ages, followed by a honeymoon in the tropics where we never left our hotel room and lived only on champagne, strawberries, and sex. Then, maybe five or ten years later, we would think about having a child." Draco finally looked up at Harry, his eyes filled with hurt and accusation. "Now it's all backwards, and it's all your fault!"
Malfoy's eyebrows disappeared beneath the edge of his hat--a fedora-shaped creation that appeared both warm and elegant. He opened his mouth, but Harry wasn't about to wait around to hear what emerged from Malfoy's rude gob. He gripped his grabber, turned his back on Malfoy, and stepped onto the road.
"The first time I visited the mainland, I used the name of my father's dragon," said Harry. "He and mum were already known to the Muggles, especially mum for her textiles. When I introduced myself as Harry Potter, people associated me with my parents. Your father has visited Mugland many times. He's well known and respected there."
She turned away and reached up onto a shelf, emerging with an old camera in her hands. The witch pointed it at them, and the bulb flashed as she took a picture. "I ought to send this to the Daily Prophet. I reckon they'd pay a dear price for this." The photo emerged from the camera, and the witch set both items on the table.
While Draco beamed in delight, the waitress caught Harry's eye with a Death Glare of her own and mouthed, 'You're paying for it.'
There was nothing humorous about the situation, but Harry couldn't resist a gentle tease. "Did you at least catch the Snitch?"
Draco pondered for a moment.  "I will reconsider," he agreed.  "But, I know that Harry will come for me."
Zabini took advantage of the masked man's distraction to switch the goblets.  When the man turned back, Zabini shrugged.  "My mistake," he said.  "Now then, let us drink.  I from the goblet in front of me, and you from your own goblet."  So saying, Zabini picked up the goblet before him and raised it in a silent toast.
Draco closed the distance between them and brushed his knuckles across Harry's open fly. "What can I say? I'm a size queen. I love a man with a large... vault."
Harry's temper flared, and it was a struggle to control the angry magic stirring in him. He clenched his fists and stormed over to the sofa. As Harry was reaching for his belt buckle, he pinned Malfoy with a glare. "This goes no farther than this room."
"I am," Draco confirmed as he followed Harry into the kitchen. "Did you dispose of those nasty bangers?"
said Draco. He was afraid to state the situation appeared hopeless. Draco hopped back to Potter's side and sank down, tucking his paws beneath him.
"You know nothing," snarled Draco, taking a step closer to the man.  "You can die, for all I care!" he cried, giving the pirate a shove.
"I have a better idea," said Draco. "Let's both go up to bed, and we can clean up this disaster in the morning."
While telling his tale, Harry had been alert for danger.  He didn't want to frighten Draco, which is why he neglected to tell his beloved about the creatures he saw stalking them.
Harry grimaced. "I hadn't even thought of them. But, since we're working with an abbreviated time frame here, none of them will be able to get too far out of control."
Outside, the guards were frightened when a voice boomed at them.  "I am the Dread Pirate Riddle! I have come to steal your soooouls!"
From the corner of his eye, Draco saw Potter open his gob, no doubt to refute Lucius' statement. Draco knew there was no use arguing with spirits, but it seemed Potter had yet to learn that. He held up his hand in Potter's direction, pleased when Potter shut his mouth. Draco appreciated a bloke who could take orders.
Harry couldn't help but laugh. "You're a right git," he said. "Let's shag first, so I can die with a smile on my face at least."
to get married because of this," he said. "However, I would prefer to be married before the baby is born."
"You have my word," promised the Half-Blood Prince.  "We will return him to his ship, and he shall be free to go."  As Draco nodded in relief, Snaperdinck leaned close to Count Rodolphus.  "Take him to the Shrieking Shack," he muttered.
"I found your six-fingered man," Hagrid told him with a wide grin.  "He is at the castle."  Indeed, Hagrid had spotted Count Rodolphus while he was training with the Troll Squad.
Draco was exceptionally amorous that evening. After several minutes of enjoyable kissing, he nudged Harry's shoulder. "I want to top," he murmured.
"Ah, I do recall that, now that you mention it," mused Harry. "Something about wanting access to my vaults," he added as he lowered his zip.
He greeted the owl with solemn formality. "Hello, Emmett. What brings you here today? Have you tired of Potter so soon?"
"Excellent! Why don't you bring the wine?" Potter pushed his chair back and stood up. "I need to speak to Hermione. She has some intel on our next case." He gathered his notes and swept out of the office.
As Snaperdinck and Rodolphus plotted Draco's demise and the war with Durmstrang, Draco himself swept into Snaperdinck's study.
"Oh, um, in that case, let me do the honors," Harry babbled, snatching the wand from Draco's hand and performing the spell on himself. He grinned up at Draco like a nutter. "There, all ready now!"
Hagrid made a grab for him, but the masked man ducked beneath the giant's legs and leaped onto his back and wrapped his arms around Hagrid's throat.  Hagrid was unable to reach his assailant.  He tried to knock him off by slamming his back against one of the boulders, but the masked man doggedly held on.  Eventually, lack of oxygen proved Hagrid's downfall.  He collapsed into a heap on the ground.
"Right shoulder," Draco replied with a tired huff. "I was reaching for the Snitch when a bloody Bludger clipped me."
He nodded and offered her a grim smile of gratitude. At least Svalbarði wasn't the most expensive water in the world.
Harry doubled over with laughter. Ah, it was good to see his nemesis sprawled on the ground. Harry's cock jerked, as if eager to get a look at Malfoy, too. Harry sobered quickly and cleared his throat. "Okay there, Malfoy?"
Zabini joined them at the boat's stern, and they all watched another small craft in the distance.  "It is a coincidence," said Zabini.  "Nothing more."
Draco held his ground. He'd faced down the Bloody Baron many a time, and he wasn't about to be cowed by the specter of his own father, no matter how angry Lucius was.
"I'm fine," Draco said as he stood up. "I've just been tired lately. I'm doing an audit on a difficult account, and it's been quite taxing."
"Since it appears this brawl was two against one, I'm going to speculate the cat and the hare are Harry and Malfoy, and the dog is one Mildred Canino."
Harry nodded in understanding and relief. "Come on, let's have dinner, and you can go to bed early."
"Now you're talking!" Max cackled.  He quickly brewed a potion, which coalesced into a large chocolate-covered miracle pill.
Malfoy responded with a smug grin. His conceit abated somewhat as he was forced to crawl back to the grass again. Harry followed suit, and they were soon upright and facing one another.
Draco's heart pounded in fear. Beside him, he felt Potter's fur bristle, and a low, angry growl emanated from the cat. When the dog lunged at them, Potter sprang at her face. A yowl erupted from him and he latched onto the dog, digging all of his claws into her and going for her eyes. Potter clamped his teeth onto her ear and bit down hard.
Being a poor farm boy, Harry wished to make his fortune before he and Draco married.  Draco was reluctant to bid him farewell.  "I fear I shall never see you again," he confessed.  "What if something should happen to you?"
Harry glanced down quickly, only to realize he'd been had. "Prat," he groused. The bubbles came up to his chest; it would have been impressive, had his cock actually been visible above the frothy foam.
Harry aimed a glare at Draco Malfoy, only to see him glaring right back. For some reason, that only irked Harry more. "This is
Draco pounced on him, startling another bark of laughter out of Harry. "You want to play rough, do you?" he mock growled, rolling Draco beneath him.
Draco smothered a laugh, while Granger shot them both a quelling glare. "We'll meet you back at the Ministry," she said. "I can't wait to hear the full report on this one." With that, she pivoted and followed her partner out of the cottage.
Malfoy had no such qualms. His right hand snaked beneath Harry, and he closed his fingers around Harry's aching length.
"Simple," said the man.  "I put poison in both goblets.  I swallowed a bezoar, and it rendered me immune to the poison."  He pulled Draco to his feet and began leading him away.
"I began using Weasley's name, too, when I first visited the mainland," Ron added. "Family ties are important to Muggles, and it identified me as the son of Arthur."
Ineville and Hagrid charged into the tunnel, Ineville's sword leading the way.  They reached the interior of the Shrieking Shack, only to find the man in black dead.  Hagrid hung his head in sorrow, while Ineville scrubbed a tired hand over his face.  "We need a miracle," he sighed.
Harry squirmed a little. Now that he'd gotten his jollies, he wanted to be done with this entire episode. Malfoy gripped him tighter, his right hand slippery with Harry's ejaculate. It was disgusting and not sexy at all, or so Harry told himself.
Harry couldn't possibly have heard Malfoy correctly. He carefully sat upright and fumbled about for his glasses. Finding them, Harry settled the specs on the bridge of his nose and peered closely at Malfoy. "What did you say?"
Draco stepped up to him and pushed Harry's hand aside. He wrapped his long, elegant fingers around Harry's erection and gave him a gentle tug in the direction of the bed. Harry went obediently enough, only muttering, "Don't break it," as a mild protest.
Emboldened by Potter's fearless attack, Draco leapt forward and bit the dog's hock. She yelped again, staggering around now on three feet while kicking out with the other as she attempted to shake Draco off. The dog stumbled and fell, compelling Draco to jump out of the way. Once she was down, he reentered the fray, biting her tail this time. He was only dimly aware of the door banging open once more.
"I suspected it, yes," Harry admitted, "but I haven't spoken to Liddell about your case since you first came in."
"Oh," said Harry before chuckling a little himself. "No, neither of us has been taking potions or anything."
"We shouldn't be meeting like this," Harry responded tightly. He approached the bed, wand at the ready. "Where are you injured?" he asked, taking note of how Draco was cradling his right arm across his chest.
"Draco, I've always intended to marry you," Harry told him. "It just seemed that we had all the time in the world, and...well, to be honest, I was afraid of what a spectacle your mum and Molly would want to turn our wedding into."
"You are an absolute nightmare," groused Harry. He gave up on the tea and leaned back against the side of the tub opposite Draco. "Ah, this is quite nice indeed."
At first, Harry's vocalizations were small and restrained, but his tiny whimpers rapidly escalated to loud, lusty moans and grunts. Malfoy was groaning behind him, his voice combining with Harry's to create a passionate duet. It was embarrassing and wrong and completely tremendous.
"It's not that simple," Harry told him. "You may need surgery to fix this, depending on the severity."
She yelped and flailed, shaking her head and stumbling backward as she tried to dislodge the furious cat.
Draco shivered and burrowed closer. A rough tongue began to wash his head and ears. It was oddly comforting. Draco's eyes grew heavy and he yawned. He dropped onto his stomach and laid his chin on his paws, planning to just rest for a moment.
With Ineville following, Hagrid carried Harry's body to the home of Miracle Maxophilius.  Ineville knocked on the door, only to be berated by Miracle Max.
"Let's just get on with it then, shall we?" Malfoy said as he stood up from the sofa. He crossed the room and used one of the hotel's pens to jot something on a notepad. He folded it in half and approached.
Harry sought to reassure him. "You don't need to make any life-changing decisions right now," he said. "I'll stabilize your shoulder and then call in one of the Medi-Surgeons."
Harry was skeptical, but he knew better than to argue. "I'll bin them," he said. "Do you have time for something else?"
Harry bit back an angry retort. "It's just that I'd like you to have something more than tea and toast for breakfast." He was becoming alarmed at how little Draco ate in the mornings. Harry could only hope his boyfriend was having a more robust lunch during his work day.
"It's Snaperdinck!" hissed Draco.  He wanted to run, but it was too late.  The Half-Blood Prince and his men rode rapidly forward, surrounding Draco and Harry.
Harry was mollified, although he wished Draco would have something other than tea for breakfast. "Don't forget we're having dinner with Padma and Theo this evening."
Harry slid off of his dragon and entered the cavern, dressed in his flight gear. He picked up his bag and gave it a shake.
After having sex and breakfast with Harry the following morning, Draco bade his partner goodbye and took his precious new book to show it to Hermione. She treated it as reverently as Draco did, turning the pages carefully and exclaiming in delight over each new illustration that was revealed.
Malfoy snickered from where he was still kneeling on the icy road. "Practicing for the Ice Capades, Potter?"
"A coward, am I?" snarled Snaperdinck.  He decided it was time to get rid of Draco's beloved, once and for all.  Snaperdinck rushed from his study to the ancient willow tree on the grounds.  He opened the secret entrance in the tree's trunk, revealing a dark tunnel.  Snaperdinck made his way quickly through the tunnel to the Shrieking Shack, where Rodolphus was supervising Harry's torture.
Blinking in surprise, Harry tried to adjust to Draco's mercurial mood change. Draco had always been quick to anger but not so easy to appease. Harry resolved to stock up on blueberries. He prepared another bowl of oatmeal for himself and ate it plain. There was no sense in prodding Draco's temper by eating any of his beloved blueberries. Besides, Harry could always snack on some later, after Draco went to work.
"I am going to dump the iocane into one of these glasses," said the masked man.  "Your challenge is to guess which one."  He took both goblets and turned his back so that Zabini couldn't see what he was doing.  The man turned back and set one goblet in front of each of them.  "Tell me, which goblet contains the poison?"
"I'll be right there!" Harry called out, already rushing to Ward Four. When he arrived, a junior Healer waved to get his attention and directed Harry into a curtained-off examination room. He slowed his momentum and entered the area at a sane, professional pace.
"All's fair in love and shagging," countered Harry. He braced himself on his forearms and grinned down at his new husband. Harry's heart clenched to see Draco smiling back up at him.
On the weekend, Harry suggested having Blaise and Daphne Zabini over for dinner. He didn't particularly care for Draco's friends, but they had children, and he hoped that seeing the youngsters would trigger something in Draco.
His skin and nerves seemed hyperaware and Harry felt, more than heard, Malfoy approach. He twitched when the hem of his official Auror robe was flung up over his back. Harry was now bare before his nemesis. His face flooded with heat, while his cock filled with blood.
"We can still have a big, social event if you like," he said quickly. "I just want you to be happy."
Potter was in his own little bubble of protection, standing guard over an ancient phonograph. Rather than flinch each time Lucius' spirit bounced off of his strongly-cast Protego, Potter's expression grew ever more fierce. It sent a thrill of desire skittering down Draco's spine. He shook himself and focused on the task at hand, which was banishing his father from Grimmauld Place.
"You started it!" Harry hollered, belatedly realizing how childish that made him sound. He didn't care. This truly was Malfoy's fault.
Draco smacked Harry's arse and rolled out of bed. "Get moving," he ordered. "We're going to have sex in that tub, and it's my turn to top."
Harry began to tick items off on his fingers, even though Hermione couldn't see him. "He gets sick two or three mornings a week, some foods turn him right off, he's moody...well, more so than usual, and his...ahem...his nipples are sensitive."
Draco was left staring after him in bemused silence. It seemed he'd been maneuvered into having dinner with his partner. Draco was surprised to find himself looking forward to it. He only hoped Potter--
"That was the sound of true love dying," whispered Ineville.  He looked at Hagrid, and together they blurted, "The man in black!"
The witch was still sprawled on the floor, blood trickling down her head and face from the wounds Potter had inflicted. "My eye," she whimpered. "You've blinded me, you arsehole!"
Harry's hands shook as he unfastened his belt and dragged his zip down. His cock was inexplicably hard, however. He didn't know if he hated Malfoy or himself more at this moment. Harry had wanked often enough to thoughts of Malfoy, but this particular scenario had never figured into his fantasies. He pushed his trousers down, where they bunched at his knees. Harry hooked his thumbs in his pants and shoved them down, too. He turned, back to Malfoy, and bent over, placing his hands flat on a sofa cushion.
Draco's eyes widened in horror.  "Oh, my sweet Harry!" he gasped.  "What have I done?!"  He threw himself down the hill after his love.
"Are you barmy? I'd like nothing better," Harry enthused. "You know how much I've always loved Hogwarts. It was my first real home. Besides, I could always return to St Mungo's during the summer months."
The boys quailed and scampered over by their father, where Blaise berated them some more. He stood up and said, "Draco, Potter, it was good of you to invite us over. It's been an enjoyable evening, but I think it's time these two little hooligans went to bed."
To Potter's credit, he didn't shrink away. Rather, he squared up, as if preparing for battle. Once again, Draco put a hand up to prevent Potter from doing or saying anything to escalate the situation.
Draco broke the snog and stepped back, batting at his partner's hand. "We don't have time for that," he chided. "I'm not done packing yet."
"It's known as Mugland, and it's very different," Hermione replied. "Their society is more structured than ours, with emphasis placed on social standing and bonding ceremonies and surnames."
Over time, Draco came to realize that when Harry said, 'As you wish,' what he really meant was, 'I love you.'  It was around the same time that Draco realized he loved Harry just as much.
"Liar!" shouted a young woman, charging into the room from the back.  "He said 'for love', not luck," she insisted, poking Maxophilius in the chest.
"Hermione, how are you?" asked Harry. They made small talk for five minutes until Harry plucked up the courage to get to the point.
By the following morning, Harry and Draco were far away from Hogwarts.  They pulled their horses to a halt in a sunlit meadow.  Harry drew Draco into his arms and kissed him.  It was the purest, most passionate kiss in the history of kisses.
Harry gave in easily enough, returning to Hedwig's side to strap the pack to the dragon's flight harness. "Seamus and Dean are getting their boat ready," said Harry. "The water looks calm, so your trip to the mainland should be smooth. I'll see you later. This is going to be brilliant," he added. "I can't wait to have sex on the mainland."
"I reckon we both need to be more careful," Harry remarked. His hip still ached, and he didn't fancy falling down again. He took a cautious step and then another while Malfoy was only just regaining his feet. There was a scrap of parchment beside the road, and Harry stabbed it with his grabber. Pleased with his victory, he brought the piece of rubbish to his bag, which he pivoted to reach. The movement caused Harry to lose his footing again. He yelped, flapped about, dropped his grabber and latched onto Malfoy for support.
Harry pressed one finger inside, and his cock gave an eager throb when Draco clamped down on his digit. Harry worked his finger in and out before adding a second. Draco's hands moved, gripping the pillow on each side of his head. Harry kept up the slow torment, grinning when Draco bore down on his fingers.
Zabini threw his hands in the air.  "You're a giant!  Bash him over the head with a rock!"  He then grabbed Draco's arm and hustled him away, leaving Hagrid to deal with the masked man.
Twenty minutes later, Harry levitated several dishes of food to the table in the dining room, along with plates, cutlery, and glasses. After setting the table, he went into the lounge. Harry was astonished to find that Draco was sound asleep on the sofa. He never took naps. Harry frowned and woke Draco with a gentle squeeze to his shoulder.
"I will always come for you," Harry promised.  "You are my one true love."  With that vow, Harry left to seek his fortune on the sea.
Harry helped Draco up on the window ledge.  Draco jumped down, and Hagrid caught him and settled him atop one of the horses.
The waitress returned a few moments later, set Harry's soda in front of him, and a bottle of water along with a glass in front of Draco. "I'm sorry, sir," she said. "We were out of cabernet, but here's a bottle of Svalbarði, on the house."
"I only work for Zabini to pay the bills," Ineville said.  "You're a fine swordsman yourself," he added.  "Who are you?"
"That's not true, Draco," Hermione said, chuckling a little. "You can take some of your healing draughts and soaps. I recommend you take as much of your lumos blossom soap as possible. Lumos doesn't grow in Mugland, and the scent is coveted by the wealthy women there. Your soaps will be highly sought after."
Seeing him again was like a punch to Harry's gut. Malfoy was still as arrogant and attractive as Harry remembered.
Harry responded with a pleased grin. "Minerva informed me that Madam Pomfrey is also keen on retiring."
Harry was still being held in the Shrieking Shack, where the Count had used his Dementor to siphon off a year of Harry's life.  In the meantime, Draco had come to the realization that Snaperdinck had not upheld his promise.  He confronted the Half-Blood Prince in his study.
Snaperdinck rolled the eyes in question.  "Yes, yes, and then you'll cut off my ears," he sighed, gesturing with his sword.  "I get it."
“Fuck!” He muttered not only was the child reluctant to trust therapy but had large list of mental health that needed to be addressed before it started to cause life changing issues for the child. He ran his left hand along the nape of his neck. He quickly looked over the parchment on potions given and saw that they had given the potion to block the pain receptors so that he could rest comfortably until he could be sedated and healed.
Kieran figured now was as good a time as any to bring up Harry’s malnutrition and the suggestion of nutrient potions to help with the deficits.
Grant knocked politely on the doorframe not to disturb anything he saw Bellatrix wiping the child off with a flannel. “Hey Harry, I’m Grant! Kieran was just telling me how much you enjoyed the protein shake I made you; so, I figured I’d surprise you with something even better. I used to work in an ice cream shop. I present to you the popular hot fudge sundae.” He sat the sundae onto the table seeing green eyes following his every move.
“If you decide you want to meet with me, I’ll have Professor Snape send me a copy of your schedule and I’ll write you a letter within the first few days of you being at Hogwarts to set up a time to meet. You won’t be the first to need sessions at Hogwarts, and I doubt you’ll be the last.”
“Patient unresponsive.” He muttered tossing on a pair of black marled joggers and a bottle green tee shirt. He quickly toed on a pair of sneakers.  Regulus hoped his gut was wrong and the child just collapsed and that the aneurysm hadn’t ruptured. He ran down the stairs two at a time before grabbing a handful of floo. The last thing he saw was his husband’s kind eyes full of concern.
Regulus was dressed simply in a medium blue Oxford with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows and a pair of grey chino pants that clung nicely to his athletic legs and a pair of brown loafers.
“Harry James Potter what did you do to yourself this time.” Molly screeched hating that both of her children were Auror’s. It’s like they were trying to send her into an early grave, it might have been seven years but she would still wake up at night and look at the clock wishing that Percy were still on it. Instead where Percy had once been Harry’s spoon replaced it, Harry was like another son to her and it seemed only fitting that he too have a spoon on her clock. “I know your hand pointed on the hospital yesterday, you will tell me what you did.” She shook her finger at the Auror, her boys and Ginny might have all grown up and were slowly starting families, but they would always be her babies.
Bellatrix ran her fingers through Harry’s hair and looked at her husband. “I have a cousin who is a Mind Healer he is also married to a man. I think that you’d like Regulus if you give him a shot. Healers and Mediwitch’s are sworn to keep whatever you tell us a secret. Trust me when I say that Kieran and I are the only two permitted to read what your chart now says. We aren’t going to tell or discuss your care with anyone you don’t give us permission.”
“I thought I was the only one who enjoyed taking a nap in that class, I usually studied in the library, besides historically the Blacks were named after Astrology, my mother is the exception.” Draco dipped another bite of pretzel into the cheese watching it down with his cognac drink. “Yes, Ilvormorny had their own houses, the Headmistress made me get sorted into one of their houses. Unlike Hogwarts it’s not based on traits but rather the soul of the wizard or witch.” He remarked finishing his first drink and ordering another.
“You just don’t want to hear me scream in pain, admit it there is a small part of you that is deriving some sort of thrill at having the power over me.” Harry said making a face at the nasty aftertaste of the potion. “Can you not like flavour them to make them not taste so disgusting.”
Bellatrix felt silent tears start to dot her eyes at that announcement that Harry had never received medical care before. She grabbed the child and pulled him close to her and ran her fingers softly through his back in a comforting manner something she would do for any of her own children. “Your glasses?” She questioned figuring he had to see some type of ophthalmologist or optometrist before to have his vision evaluated.
“We really ought to do something on our day off, how about I see if Fred and George would like to brew a height potion and we can kidnap Victorie and Teddy and all go to Alton Towers. It’ll be fun.” Ron suggested pulling out his cell ready to text both Fred and George.
Kieran sighed softly at the mention of Dumbledore needing any sort of medical treatment. He was glad he had his hands full with Harry and all his needs along with meetings with Regulus and Andromeda. “Harry, I’m going to explain the potions you’ll be taking with lunch. The first is the appetite boosting potion which you will take with all your meals. It will help to stimulate your appetite and make you feel hungrier than you typically feel. You will take this specific potion three times a day with breakfast, lunch, and dinner.” He said watching Bellatrix hand him the clear potion.
“Not as interesting as yours. Oh, Dumbledore was quite irate when I told him he’d be waiting around a little longer.” Grant said grabbing the phial of potion he just poured and leaving the room.
Regulus wanted to hug the child but knew that most abuse victims tended to shy away from physical touch from another person. “Before I go can I get your permission that Kieran can tell me about your case? It is entirely up to you if you allow that information to be shared. I personally just like to know about my patient’s physical health along with mind things.” He teased gently trying to ease the mood a little.
“It is good, you’ll like it.” Bellatrix said grabbing the fork and cutting the pie into smaller bites trying to make things easy for Harry’s wrists besides it felt instinctual as a mother to cut food into manageable bites.
The first thing they noticed was the unresponsive child laying in the middle of the floor with no Medistaff in sight. Regulus grabbed three pairs of gloves from the glove rack and tossed Bellatrix and Kieran a pair.
Harry gently held out his wrist to let the Healer examine it. It was strange he had never been in a hospital before or even so much as seen a doctor before.
Harry was a bit taken aback at Draco using his first name instead of Potter, or even worse Potty. “Hey Draco.” He figured they were on a first name basis at this point in their life.
“With who?” Hermione questioned noticing that a couple other Ministry employees turned their heads to glare at the suddenly loudness in her voice.
Harry laughed softly wanting to ask if Draco even had a heart, but didn’t since after yesterday it was obvious that Draco did have a heart. “Two houses, what is the sorting like there?”
Kieran was never the biggest fan of Dumbledore due to the fact the Headmaster had a house bias that just ended up hurting the student’s education in the long run. There was nothing wrong with any of the four houses; but Dumbledore went out of his way to worship Gryffindor and look down upon all the other houses. He would also make up reasons for Gryffindor when it came to the House Cup. Most of the Head of Houses had to intercept his end of the year Gryffindor tangents.
Regulus was just leaving his office when he felt the paper airplane note hit him in the chest. He grabbed the note and saw that Bellatrix had moved Harry to the fifth floor since the Headmaster was in the mood to be his usual mad self. He rolled his eyes at the idea of ever seeing Dumbledore as a patient.
“I found the dragon in the trash and Umbridge refuses to answer my questions about what happened before we got back here.” Regulus explained gently lifting Harry’s arm and placing the cleaned plush toy back in his arms.
Kieran gently held Harry’s wrist in his hand and ran his wand over the wrist seeing that the parchment with the automatic diagnostic quill going nuts at the previous damage to Harry’s left wrist. He raised an eyebrow towards Bellatrix at the quills quick scribbling against the parchment. He gently lifted the parchment from the table. “Your wrist is definitely broken.”
“Let me help, you’ll only injure yourself further, and I’d rather that not happen.” He sassed undoing the clasp around Potter’s neck and helping him gently out of the robes. “I’d also rather not explain to my boss that you injured yourself further trying to seduce your healer.” He teased lightly, his teasing lacked the usual Malfoy bite; besides Harry was right he did have nice abs. Merlin, he needed to stop thinking this way about Potter. Focus Draco you are a healer, do your job and stop getting distracted by the handsome man in the man.
So I don't know if I said this in the first chapter but the year is 2005, which ironically would have been the year I would have gotten my Hogwarts letter. Oh wait Ilvermorny I'm American :(
I’ll meet you in the OR.” Adrien said handing the blue phial over to Regulus before leaving the room in search of a cup of strong coffee and a pair of green scrubs. He was not about to fix a ruptured aneurysm in a pair of silk pajamas.
“Hello Mediwitch Umbridge, I’m Healer Reid. I don’t believe we’ve met.” He said politely offering her his left hand to shake. “You have my patient Harry tonight.”
Regulus smiled and entered the room. “Hello Harry! I’m Healer Regulus Black-Snape. Do you mind if I have a seat?” He could feel brilliant green eyes watching his every move. He knew most children didn’t like the idea of talking to anyone about their problems.
‘Thank you!’ Bellatrix mouthed to the Medi Intern watching the child viciously attack the sundae it was honestly nice to watch the child eat after years of being starved.
“Thanks.” Harry said greedily snatching the spoon from the table and digging into the sundae dripping hot fudge everywhere it was clear that Grant did not go easy on the hot fudge. He let the vanilla ice cream and hot fudge melt into his mouth the flavors dancing happily over his tastebuds. He had heard of the hot fudge sundae, but he had never been able to eat one. It was something Petunia would get Dudley on special occasions; but as usual he was left to starve.
Draco pulled out in cell and looked at his calendar. “I work until seven, so is 8:30 too late for dinner?” He suggested.
“Kieran, Harry doesn’t seem the best mentally. We mostly spoke of dragons, but it was the body language and how he reacted to finding out about his parents that mostly has me worried. He started to talk about Petunia and Vernon and then quickly clamed his hand over his mouth to keep himself from saying more.” Regulus had levitated his own parchment over to his chair and was scribbling his own initial notes regarding the child while telling Kieran and Bellatrix his thoughts.
He laughed softly at his old nickname the Slytherin’s loved to call him. He knew tomorrow would be fun, Theseus would probably put all three of them on desk duty until next month for punishment for screwing up a raid.
Harry laughed softly at Draco. “Please you were so obvious at Hogwarts, hell Ron even commented that you enjoyed staring at my arse, and you and I both know that man is obvious to everything but food. I had a great time with you tonight, and it’s obvious that you grew up in seven years and I do enjoy this version of you.” He finished the rest of his drink suddenly feeling rather awkward. “I’m sorry I’m drunk.”
“So, what house were you sorted into?” Harry asked taking a sip of his drink he wasn’t chugging them like he usually did since he did have to get up early tomorrow.
Kieran came back into the room at that moment and she quickly threw up a privacy spell so Harry couldn’t overhear what they were saying.
Andromeda was equally as terrifying when it came to child abuse. When the two paired up on a case, well it never ended well for the abuser of the child. When she received Bellatrix’s missive regarding the abuse case of Harry J. Potter, she figured Vivienne would love to accompany her with the case; not to mention when you put their two minds together, they were terrifying. Then again two Slytherin’s that felt the same way regarding child abuse were a forced to be reckoned with.
“Good, I’ll come see you tomorrow morning and we can figure it out then. Right now, I’m busy.” Adrien said disappearing behind the swinging glass door. Glad that he had chosen Neuro. He never understood how the other Healers could get wrapped in patients’ lives.
Bellatrix crouched down and her left knee made a sound. “Well, I guess I’m not getting younger.” She teased to herself. “Harry sweetie if you can hear us, we want you to fight. I’m not letting you go back to those muggles, hell I’ll kidnap you myself if that happens and teach you magic myself.
“No, he will not be coming with you for anything.” Vernon shouted grabbing Harry’s broken wrist and shoving him roughly against the cabin wall.
“I’d love some.” Minerva couldn’t resist showing Dumbledore her wand again. She’d love to hex him; but figured that’d be a great way to get fired and she had students to protect and care about.
“Hello darling.” She greeted handing him the glass of wine and gave him a tight hug. Their relationship was exponentially better now that Lucius was dead, was it sick that she was grateful that he decided to hang himself in Azkaban, did she care, not in the slightest. She and Draco were so much better off without him. “Long day, you look tired.” She kissed his cheek softly.
“Harry Potter, I’m 10 but I turn 11 in a few days.” Harry said softly staring at the healer in the hunter green scrubs with a symbol of a cross made with a bone and what looked like a small stick with the letter M in the middle of both the bone and stick on the right side and on the left side above the pocket was Healer Kieran Reid, MBBS.
Draco frowned at the mention of Percy, sometimes he felt as if it would have been better had it been him who had died in the battle. “Do you miss my insults, Potter?” He sneered. “Do try and stay out of trouble. So, what time would be best for you tomorrow?” He asked glad that there was still a chance with Harry Potter.
“Take a hangover potion after, you’ll be fine.” Ron said texting Fred and George to see if the wanted to tag along.
Vivienne Campbell-Riddle was not a woman to be messed with when it came to child abuse cases. When her husband became Minister of Magic, she suggested that given his history of growing up in the orphanage and the scary fact the Muggleborns were more likely to be abused due to fear of magic that he should create a Department for Child Abuse. She never dreamed he would ask her to run it. She despised child abuse more than anything. Her heels clicked angrily against the linoleum of St. Mungo’s as she and Andromeda walked up the Welcome Witch.
Thank you all for reading and still liking my stories regardless of their update history. It really means the world to me.
Bellatrix sighed and placed her wand back into her pocket once she saw Healer Burke exit the elevator. “Hello Healer Burke, let me show you to the room.”
Harry heard a voice in the distance he didn’t feel exhausted for the first time in years and most of his pain was gone. He strangely wondered if he were dead. That Vernon must have finally killed him. He reached out a hand and felt a person. He grumbled and rolled over in the comfortable bed and opened a blurry eye. The room was bright and there was a person wearing green. Everything came quickly rushing back to him. The man in green was Dr. Reid and the woman in navy was Nurse Bellatrix. He was a wizard; they were wizards, and they were helping him.
Harry laughed and that was a sound Draco wanted to hear permeantly. “No, Ginny was just a school fling.” He hadn’t told anybody but she made him realize that he was gay. He hadn’t told anyone that he was gay, he wasn’t ready to come out of his broom closet quite yet.
Ron groaned hoping those two didn’t make that suggestion to Padma. “What’s her name, probably something exotic.”
“Chocolate?” Harry questioned figuring most children his age liked chocolate and it was probably a more common request for a shake.
“Did you just say Padma is pregnant?” Hermione squealed at the idea of Ron having children. “Congratulations, I’m sure Padma is excited.”
Draco yawned as he finished his paperwork for the night, it was only an hour later than he was supposed to be off so he considered it to be a win. He stumbled his way to the line of fireplaces so he could join his mother for a glass of wine and then floo his arse to his penthouse to promptly pass out from the long exhausting day. He stumbled out of Andromeda’s fireplace and into the sun room where Narcissa greeted him with a glass of French wine.
Dumbledore stood up and followed the two former students somewhere privately. “I’m Harry’s Magical Guardian and as such I deserve to know what is going on. Hagrid isn’t telling me much of anything because you can’t tell him anything. Now get to talking Mister Reid.”
Kieran gently took Harry’s right arm and placed the IV and IV line into the arms. Harry’s skin was practically translucent which made putting an IV into a vein super easy.
“Hello Mr. Potter.” He said giving the shaking Auror a kind smile. “I’m Healer Malfoy, and I have been tasked with healing you today.”
He held out his arms and felt the child being transferred into his arms. “I’ll have Grant come to talk to you about what you saw and anything you might know about the child. Right now, his injury takes top priority.” He smiled polity at the giant he never had a problem with Hagrid during his time at Hogwarts.
“Do you feel like you could eat a little bit of food? I can get you a protein shake in just about any flavor you can ever imagine. I figured a protein shake loaded with protein and all the nutrition a typical lunch has would be easier on your stomach then trying to eat food. We can try that for dinner.” + She asked noticing the child relaxing back into the mattress of the bed.
Harry sat up with a start, sweat dripping from his forehead. He looked around rapidly trying to figure out where he was. The bed he was in was far to comfortable to be the crib mattress in the cupboard and it certainly was more comfortable than the stone floor of the cabin. He saw a man and a woman wearing scrubs and talking; probably about him.
Unbeknownst to Dumbledore Harry Potter was in his new room on the fifth floor, far away from Accident and Emergency and Dumbledore’s prying.
“Harry, I want you to know that there is absolutely zero shame in wanting to see me or talk to me. Even if you don’t want to see me regularly that is fine assuming you wish to see me at all. It isn’t going to hurt my feelings. Nobody is going to think of you as odd or crazy or any other terrible term associated with those that need help. I want you to know that I am a safe place and a good person to talk to. Even if we just talk about dragons.” Regulus stated politely. He hated the stigma associated with mental health and abused children. It was the worst thing about being a Mind Healer was the fact so many were reluctant to his help.
"And I always have to pester you into doing things with me. And you give in, most of the time, but it's not equal, Harry. I knew from the start that I liked you more. I thought it wouldn't matter because I was so happy that you were giving me a chance. But it matters, because I feel so stupid all the time waiting and hoping that you're ever going to catch up to me."
“I don’t see any reasons to switch rooms.” It was hard to tell if his wide smile was meant to be comforting or mocking. “Unless you’re scared, Malfoy.”
Granger and Pansy’s eyes both narrowed, but Granger was now looking at him in suspicion  while Pansy was looking on with rage on his behalf.
"Of course you did," she said. She sounded quite pleased, even though her teeth were chattering. Draco started up the steep bank. "But only because I knew that if I fell in the water, you would jump in to save me instead of hurting yourself."
Harry stared. He knew that there was something he should say or do now, but he couldn't think of what it was.
Well. Draco didn’t intend to be dramatic about this, but--he stuck a finger in his ear and pretended to check for blockage. “I must be hallucinating. I thought you said you wanted to teach eleven-year-olds Occlumency.”
"Ghosts aren't people like they were when they were alive. They're just the imprint a soul leaves behind. They can't sleep and can't eat, and all they can do is live in their own history. Ghosts choose to stay like a shadow instead of going on. Instead of dying properly like they're supposed to." He spread his hands in front of himself, waiting for her to see it the way he did. If he wasn't a ghost, he might as well be.
"Er, yes. Draco and I have been using it to sneak around and...." he trailed off awkwardly, but Dr. Goodnight was already laughing.
"No," Harry said, and he took Draco's hand, gripping his wand so tightly that Harry thought something might snap. Either the bones or the wand itself, and either would be a pity. "Not you." He pried the wand from Draco's fingers and let it fall, taking hold of Draco's hand and trying to ease it out of a fist.
"It's great." Harry felt a little breathless. Draco still hadn't said anything to him. He wasn't even really looking at Harry. Harry slid into the seat next to Draco and gave his hand a quick squeeze. "Happy birthday." He wanted to say something that would make up for the fact that this wasn't the first thing he'd said to Draco this morning. Now he was trying to be extra cheery. He was smiling the way Hermione had when she spotted him, and he knew it looked odd and forced.
"Claire? Claire?" She hadn’t followed him this time; she was gone. Maybe she'd run out of time, or someone in charge had finally realized that he wasn't the kind of person who deserved angels.
“Of course it is, Hermione. Everything you do always works out so perfectly. Even when you’re casting dangerous and illegal spells that should have messed everything up, everyone turns out better for it because it’s you. Everyone except for me.”
“Any complaints regarding their use of magic should be reported to their sponsor. Regarding the issue that arose during this trial of Professor Rubeus Hagrid’s restrictions on magic, the Wizengamot is in agreement that a new case should be opened in light of recent information to revisit and revise these restrictions. If Miss Hermione Granger and Mr. Ronald Weasley would like to serve as his legal representation, we will see them in two weeks time.”
Which is how Draco found himself on the train in the same compartment with the golden trio and a weight in his chest like he’d packed his trunk there. Luckily, Pansy was jammed on the seat next to him. She was going home to her mother, but when she’d heard that Draco was going to the Burrow for the Holidays she’d spent about five minutes having a physical conniption.
Harry's hands were so twitchy. He had to do something with them so they'd stop reacting like this, drawing Draco's distrustful looks.
"Fred and George said you were coming after going to the bank, and you never showed up. Andromeda and Teddy said you never came home. And then the Aurors showed up looking for you."
The other three were already trying to convince the first year students to step back so Lacey could breathe, but Draco was afraid that wasn’t enough. If Lacey transformed entirely, there’d be no holding her back, and there was no way of knowing who she’d hurt. He made eye contact with Ron. “Farther away. We need to clear out this area.”
I am not avoiding you. Well, I am avoiding you some. But it's not because I don't want to be around you. It's hard to be around people, even the people I like best, when I'm so tired of being with myself. And you're right--I've made you be the brave one over and over again because I'm afraid I'll do something wrong. You think I like you less because of it, and I hate that.
So he walked, first away from Diagon Alley and out into muggle London. If he was going to avoid the Aurors, even for a while, it would have to be out here. And the less magic he used, the better. Not that he could evade them for long. He was just playing for minutes now, hoping that the rest of them would at least be able to enjoy their Christmas Eves before they found out the hell he'd created for them all.
“I know I already said you were cracking up, but now you’ve gone round the bend. Little kids can’t learn Occlumency. Most adults can’t learn Occlumency. That’s why it’s not on the bleeding curriculum. You’re the most powerful wizard of our age, and you’re pants at it after studying with an actual teacher who was the best Occlumens alive. You’re trying to drive yourself mad, is that it? You’re determined that the Defense post is going to keep being cursed by driving you absolutely bat-shit insane?”
Draco starved a thought. He could dislike Ginny Weasley because she was pushy and had beaten him at Quidditch, but he wasn’t allowed to feel jealous of her. So, no wishing that Potter’s face lit up like that when he walked into a room. No hating her name for sounding sweet in his mouth. None of that.
Harry walked across the room to stand next to his body, and the students scrambled to answer the question.
"Uh," Draco mumbled. "Sorry to interrupt, but Claire--this girl with me thinks she's an angel, and she says she's got no family to find. But she was able to get into Diagon Alley without a wand."
Draco expected Neville to work with him for a few minutes to prove a point and then leave off to the party, but they both worked steadily for some time before Neville flopped over on his bed and complained, “I can’t think of a single other harmless hex at this point, and the library’s sure to be closed.
Draco seated himself as far away from the others as he could at the eighth year table, but Granger took her usual seat across from him. “Harry says you want us to stay the hell away from you."
He smiled often enough when he was around Fred and George, trying to prove that he did have a sense of humor. The kids, whether it was Teddy or Zoe or Jamie, always made him laugh. And Potter, of course. He smiled for Potter.
Before Harry could worry any farther about whose bones were in the top drawer, Draco went on. "I never even imagined a future in which you and I ended up dating. I knew I liked you for a while."
Ron reached over the table and snatched up a roll, then began to butter it with precise, cool movements. “What about saying that I’m the wrong sort?”
Where was Harry Potter when you needed him? Draco was not built for jumping into freezing water to save foolish muggles, but he couldn’t just stand here and watch someone drown.
Draco heard Weasley’s complaints emanating from one room. Not his then. Longbottom’s head popped out of another doorway, and he nodded at Potter. “Beginning to think you were lost.”
Draco set the cup of tea on the corner of the desk. “If you like, I could stick around and cast deadly hexes at you. I find it an effective distraction.”
There was a lot of fuss over everyone’s piles of presents in the morning. Draco had received a small package of sweets from his mother and opened it slowly while the Weasleys dug through their home-knitted sweaters. Mrs. Weasley opened the chocolates from Draco. He hadn’t had anything for anyone else, and was relieved when they didn’t have gifts for him either. He owed Hermione for taking on his case, but that wasn’t something he could cover with a Christmas gift.
His feet caught a slick patch, and he was on his knees again. It only took seconds for the wetness to start seeping through the knees of his pants.
Draco took his time to navigate the crowds to join the two. Jameson had adopted a position of contrition and Harry was tugging at his curls. "I specifically asked you not to climb anything in the store! And you said I could trust you. Jameson, I don't even know if I can bring you to sing for the Christmas Eve event tomorrow. I've got to know that all of you are going to be on your best behavior even when I'm busy."
This is really so stupid. I can see why you didn't send me all the thinking that you did to get to the point before, but you still had the courage to send me that bit that mattered most: I like you. I like being with you. I wish that you were here or I was there. Come find me.
Draco slid away and took a step back. “What? Potter, when I said that this teaching situation is making you balmy, I wasn’t looking for an invitation to come along for the ride.”
There were so many bad things that had been spinning through his mind all this year, but there had been the good things, like anchors. The things he could come back to. Ron and Hermione. Draco. And now one of those things, one of his favorite things, was falling all to shit because he didn't know how to do this properly.
"I didn't know if you'd like it," Harry rushed. "It's kind of--I don't know. Maybe it's corny or maybe it's too much or something. But Luna had something like this painted on her ceiling when we went to her house, and I spent a bunch of time thinking about what I should get for someone like you, who's always had the best of everything, and I couldn't think of anything I could pick out that you'd like better than getting it yourself, but I really wanted to get a gift that would mean something, so--there's this."
It was snowing even harder than the night before, but without the wind, the enormous flakes drifted down gracefully, catching the light of the nearby shops and filling the air. Draco took in the scene, shifted the bags of gold in his hands, and felt the corners of his lips pulling back into a smile.
Harry did not now, nor did he ever, want to hear any part of this conversation between Ginny and Draco.
"Oh this?" the girl looked down at her white dress. "This is just what I was buried in. I didn't have time to pick out anything more appropriate for the occasion."
Hermione was too immersed to answer, so Pansy piped up. “Draco and I both have our magic usage restricted by the Ministry, and Hermione’s more worked up about it than either of us.”
“We’re not going to beat Potter, anyway,” Charlie laughed. “I’m all for pickup Quidditch, but let everyone enjoy their hols, Gin!”
He paused at the doorway. It wouldn’t look like the door to the Room of Requirement, probably because they’d required it not to. And it wouldn’t look like the room of hidden things inside. It wouldn’t be charred and blackened, a hollowed out shell, a vanishing cabinet or a dead bird. It would be a dormitory.
Potter made eye contact with Draco, and Draco gave a quick nod. Potter leaned close to the girl and whispered. She nodded. There was a stream of blood running from one of her nostrils, and she wiped a hand across it, smearing the stain across her face. Potter took her by the other hand and led her from the room.
Merlin. Draco stopped breathing. So much for having fans. Draco was going to kill them all. He flipped another page roughly even though he’d registered nothing from the one previous.
Hermione waved away his concerns. “He has a soft spot for misunderstood creatures. You’ll do fine, as long as you don’t make any comments. Drink this."
"Weasley," the goblin at the fore of the group interrupted. "You can save your gab. The two of you are months behind on payments for the shop."
Draco and Harry followed her into the office, and Harry realized that the color had gone from Draco's face.
'I'm thinking too," Draco snapped, "But I'm actually letting you be part of it. I don't have answers, Harry, but all of this that I can, I'm trying to do with you. I can't keep trying to guess the password every time I want to get into your thoughts. Can't you just sit down and talk to me?"
The memory of earlier that day, when Lockhart had spoken like he did in front of the kids from the home, filled Draco's mind. It was one thing to write about him in the paper. It was one thing to scare away their customers. But those kids--Draco knew he couldn’t stop them from ever hearing about who he really was, but he didn’t want them thinking about him that way.
Desperately, he dug into his bag, dropped a random handful of coins on the counter, and started striding toward the door. He tried to keep his chin up, but his head was tipped forward by some cruel trick of gravity.
Draco’s irritation fizzled and faded, and Harry took a few steps toward the chair where he was sitting. “You asked about Lacey?”
There seemed to be some kind of gravity holding him in the room, but Draco fought it. He gathered his robes and walked back to the eighth year dorm, his mind cycling from Harry’s startled smile to the hunch of his shoulders and back again.
“What did I say?” Potter’s voice was quiet now, pitched for Neville to hear. Draco leaned back onto his pillow and tried not to try to hear everything they said.
Draco gave one last squeeze, then let Teddy squirm out of his arms. The rest of the kids from the home gathered around, all talking at once. Draco made a quick swipe at his eyes and catalogued them all. Holly, Alana, and Maya. Jamie and Zoe. All of them alive and well and here, right where they belonged.
There was laughter and shouting, a Christmas train that kept circling them and showering down bubbles. Teddy was deep in conversation with some of Harry's kids, and Andromeda was embracing Molly.
Harry laughed, shining with all the good feelings of the game, and said. "No, I told McGonagall that I'm not going to do anything next year."
“I don’t know.” Malfoy knew he should know. He should go to the ministry and look it up and read it. Or owl the lawyer. Or something. He should be aware of the rules that he might break, but the moment was too blurry in his memory to pull out the exact wording of his probation, and he’d simply been extra careful about it ever since. That caution combined with the lethargic loaner wand meant he wasn’t doing much outside of the classroom.
Even though it is undeniable that the wolfsbane potion has changed in appearance and efficiency, there are rumours that Draco Malfoy's long term partner Harry Potter influenced the decision of awarding the title. In reaction to the accusation Malfoy stated: “I was accepted to study under Master Twining before my relationship was common knowledge and even after I told her about it, she expected the same work and performance of me. I have worked hard for this Mastery and Harry had nothing to do with me receiving it.”
has gone on an editing spree (she literally did the rough check on 6 chapters and the final edit on 4 more in the last 2 days) so I'm SUPER happy to upload another chapter!
None of them looked up when Draco reached the table. From right next to them he could hear Granger and Pansy argue about their potions assignment due on Thursday. From the little snippets he heard, they were both wrong. He cleared his throat.
“Don’t worry. You must have had that for over a year now and at this point I can’t really say I miss it,” Blaise said, managing to quell Draco’s unsaid worries. Looking Draco up and down one more time he continued, “Keep it. It looks good on you.”
silky hair, pulling them closer together. Draco shifted and the slight hint of friction led Harry to involuntarily buck his hips up against him. Chuckling, Draco pushed Harry back into the armchair, tutted and got up. He went back to the sofa, sat down and stretched his arms out over the backrest, raising an expectant eyebrow.
It was Hermione who saved him. “Draco came back from his meeting last week with multiple bruises on his torso.” she said, cutting straight to the chase.
Time melted away as he kneaded and mixed and baked. When the dough for the buns was set aside to rise it was time for his favourite part of the day: The cookies. He turned the radio up and reached for his cutters, all of them handcrafted by his design and one of the biggest selling points for his little shop. He had a common welsh green, a peruvian vipertooth, a wyvern and many more breeds of dragons; it only seemed fitting given his and the shop’s name.
In the end, he decided that his mother was far more important than the opinion of some students and he donned the suit. Flicking his wand over the mess of clothes he had produced, he spelled them to neatly fold themselves before he quickly levitated them all into his trunk. With a last glance into the mirror he flicked his wand once again (a familiar motion he hadn’t done in weeks), and cast a hair straightening charm and a low-level glamour for his undereye area, in quick succession.
“Hi!” Harry was a bit out of breath but was recovering quickly. He walked over to where Draco was sitting and let himself unceremoniously fall next to Draco.
“Granger, I am well aware that I should have done this some time ago, but please know that I am deeply sorry for the way I treated you in the past. You didn’t deserve my hatred, jealousy or cruelty, that’s all on me. I would also like to formally apologize for both the loss and pain you suffered at the hands of me, my family or any associate I may have had during the war. “
She caught his eyes and he silently screamed at her to return to her own assignment or to Pansy or anyone if it would only lead to her leaving them alone. He wanted to scream that ‘Harry isn’t ready you idiot!’ but he couldn’t, so he settled for a glare.
Malfoy entered the classroom back to his normal self, gone was the shy subdued man, instead he was once again haughty and arrogant, “I won’t let you in my head” he exclaimed as a form of greeting and sat upon the chair Harry had cleaned for him.
First of all, we have to come clean: The staff of the prophet has kept a secret from you for a few weeks now. In the picture on the left you can see Draco Malfoy entering a jeweller with war heroine Hermione Granger. This photo was taken almost 3 weeks ago. The editorial staff agreed to keep it from publishing until this moment so as to not ruin the surprise.
The sheets were still tangled from their cuddling the night before, but he didn’t care about that. Once in the room Draco clutched at the hem of Harry’s shirt and pulled it up, as Harry raised his arms over his head.
Entering with 2 sandwiches in one hand and chocolate muffin in the other, Pansy was greeted with another smile. Draco marked his page and eagerly put his book away, shuffling to sit cross legged at one end of the bed. Without a conscious thought Pansy sat down on the other end and shoved the food at Draco.
“A- a pig” answered the dark-haired boy, his face glowing red. Both Blaise and Pansy looked at him in surprise, asking him to clarify. “Listen! It was tiny! A tiny pig, like the size of my hand, tiny. And it wore a tiny yellow raincoat and tiny rubber boots.” Potter flushed even further and then simply turned to Hermione. “Truth or Dare, ‘Mione?”
In the end, Draco had managed 7 NEWTs, 6 of them Outstanding and only one Exceeds Expectations. He was proud of himself and he even had an interview for a potential mastery lined up. Soon he would be at the manor, seeing his mother and shortly after he would pack what little belongings he still had at the manor and move in with Harry. After he had secured that he could floo his mother whenever he wanted, he had had few qualms in accepting Harry’s offer.
In general the room resembled a common room, aside from the lack of house paraphernalia. There were multiple comfortable looking couches and armchairs arranged into little seating groups, inviting the students to sit down and talk. The ever present fireplace was sitting on one wall, and on the wall opposite stood a buffet of snacks and drinks looking somewhat improvised on the mismatched tables. In between the couches, in the middle of the room, was a larger area cleared for what Draco assumed would be dancing, although he didn’t hear any music yet.
“No, and you won’t tell him either, understood? I can handle it. I’ll find the counter and Harry won’t ever need to know about this!” Draco was adamant. Pansy had urged him to simply tell Potter about the bond from the moment they had discovered what it was. They had had quite the row about it.
Another Tempus showed that he’d have to choose quickly, he only had 5 minutes left. Deciding that the dress robes were far too formal for a simple study meeting while the training gear was way too informal and unfitting, the latter also defeated the purpose of not screaming Slytherin with his clothing choice. “Muggle attire it is.” he thought to himself. He quickly grabbed the grey jeans and the slighty oversized dark blue jumper and put them on. A quick glance into the mirror told him that he was indeed presentable. He briefly considered pulling his hair back (it had reached his chin) but not only would that leave him with a nasty hair tie wave for the next day it would also defeat the purpose of the shower. Plus he could hide behind his hair when he got too uncomfortable.
Draco smiled at him encouragingly. “Congratulations on figuring it out, but that doesn’t mean you have to immediately come out, you know? Take it at your own pace.”
Naturally, not thinking of Malfoy had worked for about 5 seconds before Harry became rapidly obsessed with him again. He watched Malfoy constantly - at meals, in class, on the map - thinking about the way he had held his wrist and read his palm. Harry couldn’t figure out if Malfoy was up to something or if he had actually changed into a tolerable person.
No matter the exact proceedings of their engagement, the Prophet wishes both a long and loving life together.
Draco thought about lying, thought about saying no, but Potter deserved the truth. So he reluctantly nodded and immediately wished he didn’t. The regret in those green eyes was almost unbearable.
Two paragraphs into the essay Malfoy cleared his throat. “While I understand how my shields may hinder the process I am not entirely sure how one achieves ‘making a memory present’.” Sensing a longer explanation incoming, Harry capped his inkwell and sat down in front of Malfoy.
So with the pull making itself apparent, so soon after his last run-in with Potter, Draco was worried.
“Be glad you missed dinner. Blaise made a right arse of himself.” She started her daily update of all the rumours she heard. Draco raised an eyebrow, too busy chewing his dinner.
“Oh good! You’re ready. Hermione is waiting in the common room for us and Blaise said he’ll try to join us later, you know how he is in the mornings.” Draco did know. He had shared a dorm with him for six years after all, even his bed on some occasions.
Harry continued to come into Draco’s shop,  visiting at least once per week, and slowly ‘Potter’ changed to ‘Harry’ and ‘Malfoy’ changed to ‘Draco’.
He only needed to last 9 months now and it would be all over. Taking a few deep breaths he forced himself to concentrate on his book.
From the moment he stepped on the platform he could feel people staring. Aiming to simply board the train as fast as possible, Draco kept his head down and headed straight for the closest door. He made it almost ⅔ of the way, before the whispers set in.
It was getting dark when Harry’s head shot up from his book — his auror reflexes setting in — as he heard the unmistakable sound of snow crunching beneath  shoes. Harry checked the windows methodically and found nothing out in the backyard. Shaking his head, he stoked the fire and settled back into the armchair. It had probably only been the fire crackling.
While Pansy had swiftly slipped away, Blaise proposed one of the favourite games of Slytherin house.
That seemed to take the wind out of Pansy’s sails and no one spoke for a few seconds until Blaise breached the uncomfortable silence.
“You don’t have to come obviously! I mean… I would be happy if you did, I had just assumed you would because you have gotten better with being around us Eighth years…” Hermione looked lost for a moment, completely misinterpreting his gloomy expression.
For a short moment Harry considered knocking, before just opening the door. He instantly regretted his choice when he was greeted with, “Ever heard of knocking Potter? Or are you trying to catch me naked? Pervert.”
“A dream you say?” Malfoy asked thoughtfully and Harry watched him concentrate once again, his eyes watching Harry intently. Minutes passed and just as Harry began to feel uncomfortable at being stared at, while not really being registered Malfoy whispered, “Expecto Patronum” and silver sparkles illuminated the space between them. It wasn’t a corporeal Patronus, it wasn’t even strong enough to be considered an incorporeal one yet but it was undoubtedly progress.
She had been right, when she had said that tattoos hurt to get, while piercings hurt during the healing time. Not that the pain was something a numbing spell couldn’t fix, but she didn’t know about that. Besides, nothing would ever compare to the pain Draco had to endure while receiving his initial mark, and the pain and noise of the needles were well worth the beautiful artwork he was now sporting on his arm.
“Don’t ask, you know I only went out of courtesy.” Potter mumbled. A bit clearer he added, “What are you all doing?” Blaise took it upon himself to get Potter up to speed.
“It’s nearly dinner time,” she stated. Draco looked at her, panicked. “No I won’t force you to go and I won’t go either, we both know you aren’t anywhere near ‘fine’ right now.”
Draco reread the paragraph thrice. If the bond recognised the intimacy behind the contact it would explain why he had gotten so bad in such a short time. An intimacy bond couldn’t be fueled with run-ins and shoving, it needed meaningful contact. And the moment it got what it wanted - voluntary contact and one partner caring for the other - it had calmed down.
And since she had been alone to drink, Hermione explained about the brief hook-up she had had with Charlie Weasley during her research trip to cure her parents' memory. In Draco’s opinion it seemed all pretty tame although emotionally charged. Hermione had just broken up with Ron, the war had only been over for a few weeks and she was fearing for her parents. Who could blame her for seeking comfort in Charlie, when he was one of the first people she knew during the whole trip.
“Me following you? Who is on whose fucking property Potter? You do realise that the manor is only behind the hills right? You are technically in my home. So go on, ask me again if I am following you.”
To his surprise though, Potter didn’t comment on Draco’s presence and simply let himself fall into the couch next to Hermione.
“Mr. Malfoy, if you would please stay behind for a moment?” The heavy Scottish accent of  Professor McGonagall rang loudly through the silent classroom and then there was the rustling of students getting ready to leave. Eighth year transfiguration had just finished and Draco hoped that whatever it was wouldn’t take long, he had muggle studies starting in a few minutes.
Draco paused a second. Then, his face burning, he rushed to add, “I mean, they’re accompanying me so that I don’t… freak out again.”  Innerly wincing at the admission to his panic attacks, Draco turned an even darker shade of red.
The four of them wandered off to the library after lunch and half an hour later Potter waved them goodbye with a laugh, as Pansy, Hermione, and Draco left for Ancient Runes.
He tasted of caramel and fruit and his lips caused Draco’s to tingle; an electric sensation starting where he was connected to Harry and slowly reaching into every fibre of his being. Despite the energy racing through his system, he felt frozen in place, unable to move. The butterflies in his stomach were fluttering up a storm and Draco dreaded the moment he would wake from this dream.
After they left their classmates behind and entered the rarely used stairway leading to the seventh floor, Draco let his hand brush against Harry’s. Harry cast a nervous glance around before taking the offered hand. They ascended the stairs slowly, neither feeling any need to rush.
and he had apologized to most of the students. He sent dozens of letters while he was wasting the days in the manor away. He was
Even hours after their impromptu snog, Draco’s head was still dizzy. He and Harry had spent another hour in the Room of Requirement, kissing and holding each other. At one point, Draco had sprung up in a haste, fearful of missing curfew; Harry had to remind him twice that curfew didn’t apply to them anymore. Nonetheless they did leave for their common room a little while later, their hands brushing against each other as they walked.
After multiple reported sightings of Harry Potter in the company of Draco Malfoy it is finally official! Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy are in a committed relationship with each other.
His mind healer had taught him different meditation techniques to calm him, to let him focus or to help him fall asleep. Harry slipped into the familiar breathing pattern with ease and sleep soon found him while still sitting against the headboard.
“As long as you aren’t actually pulling hard enough to pull my hair out I am fine with it. I actually kinda like it, if the pull is relatively light. Your limits?”
Blaise just shrugged it off. “I’m not even sure he was my father, don’t even know if mother is certain about that fact.” Seeing the shock on his boyfriend's face he continued, “It’s fine love. I don’t miss him and I have no need to know. It’s your turn by the way.”
“No. I meant the piercings.” he clarified, motioning towards the bar going across her upper ear. Lucius would have hated them.
It was a rather peculiar problem to say the least. With Hogwarts being badly damaged during the final battle — just months before the new school year started, and consequently, Harry’s eighth year — there had been constant reconstructing by a team of witches and wizards who worked on fixing damaged hallways, classrooms and most importantly: the wards.
Draco was about to counter that “it is in the book?!” before he remembered that their Potions textbook never actually explained it. The textbook they had been working with since first year was basically a collection of recipes and nothing more. And since Snape most definitely hadn’t explained it in class, he had to admit that Potter had a point. He could have read up on it in a different Potions book, but Draco doubted that Potter had cared about the distinction enough to go to that effort.
“I think I should tell you something.” he started, about to open up about the one secret he had kept from her for years. The breakfast table looked bleary through the tears gathering in his eyes. He felt his hands jittering in his lap, hidden from view by the thick tablecloth.
With a low growl, Draco pulls Harry close again, placing a few open mouthed kisses against his neck and instantly the mood changes from controlled to feral.
By the time he reached the couch, the common room had erupted into hushed arguments as to what the saviour was doing in their common room and how he had even gotten in. All of the conversations stopped once more, when Harry unceremoniously plonked himself onto Draco’s lap, burying his face in Draco’s chest. Almost out of instinct, Draco put his arms around his boyfriend. He had recognised the haunted expression behind those green eyes and was guessing that Harry probably had dreamed something horrid and now needed reassurance.
In the end he had given the stylist almost complete freedom with his cut and Draco didn’t regret it. His sides were buzzed short, both because there was little to salvage from the massacre he had caused the night before as well as a way to keep his hair from getting caught on his new piercings. The top of his head was still covered in longer strands, as the light blond colouring would have made him look bald if it were cut too short all over. Plus the hairdresser seemed obsessed with Draco’s natural waves.
Draco remained silent and a few moments later they arrived at an inconspicuous painting of a fruit bowl. The soft order to reach out and tickle the pear seemed strange, but Draco did and moments later he stood amidst a flood of house elves.
“Merlin and Morgana. That was fucking fantastic.” Harry admits some time later, turning to look at Draco. The Slytherin agrees and pulls Harry closer to kiss him. They kiss languidly for some time before pulling apart and Draco’s gaze drops onto Harry’s neck again, eliciting a slight chuckle. At Harry’s questioning look he says “I did warn you that I like marks, right? and conjures a mirror.
“Minerva tells me you’re looking for a mind healer. Do you have any previous experience with mind healing or therapy?” Gemma asked in a friendly tone. Her expression didn’t change one bit when Draco shook his head.
They sat together in silence, Potter reading the potions book and taking notes, and Draco sorting his head. Memories still haunted the back of his mind and Draco didn’t doubt that he would have nightmares tonight, but above those haunting memories all he could hear was ‘
They were silent for a moment, before Harry timidly spoke up again. “I told her about you,” he admitted.
Through all his sobbing and stuttering he heard Pansy sigh sympathetically and somewhat forlornly. There were two
Draco could only stare at him in shock for a few moments, “Potter?” he spluttered, “Wha- Why-.. What?” Realising they were still holding hands, he tried to let go but Harry only held him tighter.
“Draco. What questions do I need to ask that I can’t answer myself? It’s clear why, you’ve been crushing on him for years and-”
But since starting back at Hogwarts, Draco was allowed to travel within Britain as long as he reported back for his parole meetings. Unfortunately, Narcissa was still on house arrest for the next year and a half, which made her suggestion of taking Draco somewhere impossible.
In hindsight I realise that I used my standard description of separating a person and their brain. I use this technique quite a lot, when trying to explain mental illnesses such as anxiety or depression to people who don’t experience them. I as a person might rationally know that I have people who care about me, while my brain tells me that everyone secretly hates me/is laughing about me behind my back.
They had stopped walking. Draco was looking at the ground, foot kicking a stray rock, trying to do anything but look at Harry’s face.
Draco was anxious. Harry hadn’t been at breakfast and although Granger and Weasel didn’t look too concerned, he was worried as to why. Even though it was a Saturday, Harry was usually in the Great Hall by the time Draco would go up for breakfast, but not that day. Only listening to Pansy with half an ear, he sat on one of the leather couches in the common room and mused over reasons for Harry to miss it. He hadn’t mentioned anything on Thursday so it must have been something spontaneous, but he couldn’t ask. Weekends were always difficult in regards to random meetings and they had agreed to not meet this one in specific, in order to ease the suspicions of Pansy and Blaise.
“Pain play, impact play.” Another surprised eyebrow-raise at his answer. Harry’s questioning look is met with another question. “Hair-pulling?”
He was still coming down from his high, cock still inside Harry, when the raven haired man leaned close again. Breathless and chuckling, he murmured, “Never have I ever ridden two dragons.”
The first thing Draco noticed when he woke was that he wasn’t freezing, he was actually quite comfortable. The next thing Draco noticed was the general absence of pain and then he noticed a lot of things all at once. The sheets on top of him weren’t silk but rather cotton and a woollen blanket on top of that, like lemon, lavender and rubbing alcohol, but most noticable, there was a hand clasping his and something warm and heavy resting on his arm.
They met in the Room of Requirement again, since there was enough time for theory tutoring on Thursday. Most of their professors had begun the new year with a small review so there weren’t any big assignments due in the next week. Deciding to use the chance, Draco had asked Harry over breakfast if he was okay with another practical lesson that evening.
A complete overview of the achievements and milestones in both Professor’s lives can be read on page 5.
As for possibly triggering topics: Mentions of alcohol, kissing due to truth or dare and a somewhat forced/accidental coming out (self-outing due to veritaserum)
Potter had settled into his new seat next to Draco, chicken scratch handwriting covering the parchment in front of him. With a sharp ‘You’re going to regret this’ stare at Pansy, Draco prepared for the inevitable, but Pansy didn’t even notice. She was whispering with Hermione, leaning close enough that Draco was sure she had to be nearly sitting in the other girl's lap. Her face partially hidden by Hermione’s hair.
When she reentered the room a few moments later, she found the men laying on the bed. Blaise lay on his back and Draco had curled himself into his side, his head on the other’s chest. Both were silent but Blaise had taken to running his fingers through the blond hair. Pansy silently joined them, spooning Draco.
During their initial consultation, Toby had warned him that the watercolour style tattoo would not completely cover the dark colour of the mark and Draco hadn’t cared, too enthralled with the beautiful flower design. Now he was glad that it didn’t. He wasn’t trying to hide his past mistakes, he wanted to make up for them. To maybe get the chance to embellish his surroundings instead of destroying them.
There is only the epilogue left to go and I will hopefully get to that in the next few days. As always: Tell me your thoughts, I love to hear them.
“Meals were the worst. I could hide in my room or on the grounds most days and would be left fairly alone, but I had to come to meals. And everyone else was there too.” Another pause while they descended a flight of stairs.
almost an hour later he had not only one new piercing, but three. The bar going across his ear (an industrial Leah had called it) was joined by simple rings dangling from each earlobe. On top of that he had an appointment for a tattoo shortly after Christmas.
“I-its all my-……-all my f-fault.” Draco choked out. The tears flowing freely, turning the dark green covers even darker.
Harry shrugs his shoulders, he isn’t ashamed for who he is. When Draco is still silently staring at him a few seconds later, Harry nudges him, “I am more on the submissive side of things by the way.”
“So, I thought we could begin with potion bases and maybe even start on the effects of temperature and stirring while brewing today? We can focus on the assignments on Thursday’s in case any of the others want to discuss that as well, and then we can do some more revision on Friday’s. Maybe after the Christmas holidays we can even start on some practical brewing.” Despite his mask, his explanation was rushed and Draco had to remind himself that he needed to breathe. His heart was pounding in his chest, even though he theoretically knew that there was no reason to be nervous.
was reverberating in his head and it took all his concentration to not freak out. He wasn’t sure if he should control his rising hopes that Harry might reciprocate his feelings, or if he should start reigning in his crush so as not feed his jealousy.
Slowly, the Great Hall began to fill. The population of Hogwarts rising to meet the day. Despite there being more students, Draco made no move to abandon his discussion with Hermione. Instead, he opted for another serving of yoghurt with berries and remained seated.
Hermione didn’t know for certain what had occured that afternoon but from what she had gathered, this was neither a new, nor an unexpected occurrence. Pansy had been on edge all afternoon, and both she and Blaise had rushed to their friend once they knew he was back in the common room. From experience she knew that Draco avoided the corridors like the plague, and that he rarely spent any time outside their common room except for— She sat up straight.
The moment he entered, everyone fell silent in shock. Hermione, Neville and Hannah looked at him gobsmacked, while Blaise repeatedly ran his eyes up and down his body, stopping at the sight of his hair and pierced ears. Pansy managed to recover first, a bright smile on her face as she jumped up to hug him in greeting.
The professor was silent for a moment, giving Draco time to process her revelations. Changing her tone from stern and honest to a more cheerful one, she spoke up yet again.
“Look, I know this is weird, but… I am just so tired of all this fighting and all this… hate. I don’t hate you Malfoy and I certainly don’t wanna fight with you. All I want is a single quiet year at Hogwarts and to pass my bloody classes. If that means spending time with you so that I can finally understand Potions then so be it.” The shrug of the shoulders was surely meant to look indifferent but Draco saw the nervousness behind it.
I also need to thank you… for saving me from the fire and for speaking at my trial.”  His hands were clammy inside his pockets and he nervously gnawed on his bottom lip.
Tentatively, Harry placed his free hand on Draco's lower back and traced his tongue against his lower lip, asking permission. Draco responded instantaneously, his hands came up and pulled Harry in closer so their chests were mere centimeters apart. He parted his lips and deepened the kiss.
To his surprise Malfoy interrupted him only five minutes in. “I think I understand now what you mean with the memory being present, but I… I can’t think of a good memory to use.” Malofy took a deep breath and then rushed out, “I can’t use my childhood memories, they have become too entangled in the war. No matter where I start I end up with father in Azkaban, with Mother slowly losing her mind in the Manor and I… I just can’t.”
A slight smile appeared on Draco’s still blotched face as he was once again reminded why he and Blaise were best friends, the man understood how to lighten any situation. A talent Hermione apparently didn’t understand as she began to justify and explain the situation, growing redder in the face.
“Do the thing you mentioned wanting to do on Thursday,” he challenged, confusing most of the others. To Pansy’s credit, she didn’t even reach for her shot glass. Instead, she turned to Hermione, sitting next to her on the couch.
Draco’s hand unconsciously went to his chest, tracing one of the deeper scars from that day in the bathroom. When he registered the wide eyes, staring at his hand in pain, he dropped his hand quickly.
Immediately he felt his cheeks heat against the cold winter air and he looked at his feet. His mind raced to find a way to take it back, find something to say to make it seem like he was joking, but before he could think of anything useful it got interrupted by a slightly shaky, “Then do it.”
“Times have changed my little dragon. I may not understand what you like about those ‘jeans’ of yours but I don’t have to. You make your own decisions and it was high time I accepted that. I know I didn’t always, and look where it led you.”
“Oh, uhm… I… kind of noticed that you weren’t at dinner, which isn’t that unusual but then you weren’t in the dorm either so I figured you must be in the kitchens. I stopped by the kitchens to come get you but Winky said you hadn’t been there all day and then I just… thought you still needed to eat and that we could have a little picnic.”
And it was Draco’s turn to chuckle. The way Blaise had said it made it clear that he neither thought the death tragic nor an accident and he couldn’t blame him. Zaira Zabini had gone through many husbands and none of them had been a father figure to Blaise. All of them, however, had been rich and had ended up dying of some ‘accident’ or other over time.
When Draco had finally pulled his jumper over his head, Blaise had joined him at the sinks, to face the mirrors. The darker man had pushed his sleeves up to his elbows to wash his face and Draco couldn’t help but notice the faint bruises on his wrists.
That was an easy choice. He didn’t take History of Magic anymore and he had done the Ancient Runes translation already, so he took out his Transfiguration book and began looking for the spell McGonagall had referenced in their last lesson. He didn’t need to know about it, strictly speaking, but it couldn’t hurt either.
He runs his hand through his still damp hair and strides over to the fireplace, kneeling in front of it and calls out,
Draco picked his book back up but couldn’t concentrate. Truth was, there was no counter. The bond would dissolve itself after roughly a year and that would be it. The whole reason it existed was to help people who either didn’t know or didn’t like each other to learn to get along, so of course there was no easy way out.
When he adds a second finger, Draco breaks the kiss again, “Do you want me to choke you now or when I am inside of you?” he asks and Harry can barely answer as Draco presses his fingers deep into him, brushing his prostate.
4. Questions about the war and questions with the intent to hurt or distress someone are forbidden and the compulsory charm includes a variation to actually hinder you from asking. Should anyone beat the compulsion and still ask such a question, they will be thrown out and banned from all future parties.
They continued studying like this for the next few days, mostly sitting in silence, only the scratching of quills on parchment filling the air. Every now and then they made tea and just talked. The first time they did that, it was still awkward but Harry pressed on. They ended up talking for an hour, tea and homework long forgotten. And though they had started on the topic of quidditch they somehow ended on a heated but friendly discussion about the benefits of wizarding vs muggle fashion. They only really stopped when they were interrupted by Neville asking them to clear the table for dinner.
Blaise laughed. “Relax. I know it’s not what it looks like.” He walked up to his still hugging friends and pulled both of them in his arms, gently steering them to Draco’s bed. Before the three of them could fall onto the mattress though, Hermione seemed to have reached her limit of awkwardness.
“I´m sensing there´s a but coming?”, Harry asked, raising himself onto is elbows to look him in the eyes.
Draco could see the honesty radiating from Harry’s eyes and it made Draco dizzy. After all the years of thinking he could have done more, a weight finally lifted from his chest. Harry thought his actions to be enough, and maybe Draco could start thinking that too. Tears welled in his eye and all he could do was nod his head with a murmured “Thank you.” Harry pulled him into a hug, and just held him.
Willing his eyes to remain dry, Draco nodded and when that didn’t seem enough added, “I don’t think I ever really mourned him before… Vince… he was my friend. And I killed him.”
Her small hand covered his shaking one gently and Draco found himself actually finding comfort in it. And before he could think too deeply about it, Draco nodded. “I… I can try. No promises though.” Both Pansy and Hermione reassured him and shortly after they went back to their respective assignments.
I just terminated my appartement, got accepted into the masters degree I was hoping for and got a confirmation on a job I've applied to. So in order to share my excitement, have this chapter, which just happens to be a GOOD one.  I promise.
Even aside from their opposing sides of the war, there is quite the history between our Saviour and his boyfriend. Multiple classmates described the pair of them as ‘bitter enemies’ (previous to their last year at Hogwarts), with an animosity that led to several physical alterations between the two of them, and even rumours of near deadly battles. It is shocking to see the two holding hands in Diagon Alley.
To his surprise the door opened to neither their own little common room nor the potions lab. Instead he found a cozy looking living room, with a fireplace along one wall. In the middle of the room lay a thick, fluffy rug with pillows and blankets strewn on top of it. On one of those pillows sat Harry, idly rotating his wand around his fingers, and on one of the blankets was a basket and something that looked suspiciously like a muggle thermos.
“I’m so sorry for not coming in earlier, I had planned to, honestly but Andromeda fell sick and between work and taking care of Teddy, I just didn’t have a moment of time,” the darker man's breathing began to become normal again. “I would have called but I don’t have your number.”
Thank him for saving the world from the maniac, and more specifically him from the flames and the Wizengamot?
No one really acknowledged him except for Pansy, who nudged him with her foot when he sat down in the armchair next to her. A few moments later, Hermione addressed Hannah, “So, truth or dare?”
Draco’s hand stilled and he looked up and found Harry leaning against the table he was working on. “Oh?” he replied, “How did she take it?”
They both cried freely for what felt like hours, and neither of them made to move once their tears had dried, simply taking comfort in the warmth of each other. Slowly Draco felt the heaviness in his stomach being replaced with a fluttering airiness he couldn’t quite place.
He turned in his seat to face Potter, “I… What?” His originally intended question refused to form on his lips the first time and he tried again, “Why would I be happy if you died?”
Explaining potions theory to Granger had been surprisingly nice. Her questions were intelligent and it was evident that she understood what she was talking about. The only reason she had problems with the assignment while Draco hadn’t, was because Draco had had extensive tutoring in the past. It was a shame that they had Slughorn as Potions Master now, Snape would have never run them into such a misery, not without pointing out where to look up their missing knowledge.
He became somewhat aware of the circumstances again, when Pansy said, “Your minute is over.” and he pulled away, still sitting in Blaise’s lap.
Thursday marked the first day since their kiss on Monday that Harry made any kind of acknowledgement to the fact that they had been kissing. The two of them were seated at the smaller separate table that Draco and Harry had grown accustomed to using during the study group sessions, and Harry had cast a muffliato almost immediately after sitting down.
Once again Harry had only Malfoy on his mind. The way the other had smiled while casting his sparkles, the way his eyes shimmered as he sat there, the way he was nicer nowadays, the vulnerability. Harry didn’t exactly know when it happened, but at some point Draco had become something close to a friend to him, someone he was excited to meet up with.
“For now, yes. It might be crucial to extract some memories later on, should the removal of Morris not go according to my current plan, but as of right now it should suffice. Might you stay behind, Miss Parkinson?”
“Use literally any out of use classroom. You might have to use a few Scourgify beforehand, but that shouldn’t be a problem.” Draco suggested.
“Would you like to charm my hair turquoise for me, then?” he offered to lighten the still emotionally loaded mood.
And that was all it took — an unspoken challenge, issued via eyebrow and Harry found himself saying, “Never have I ever made out with a guy” as if to prove something. Nevermind that not even Ron and Hermione knew that about him. He refilled his shot and drank, his eyes never leaving Draco’s face, closely watching the blond swallow more liquor.
“You know, you could always come to lunch? Far easier, really.” Pansy mused, watching him expectantly.
“Fine with me,” Potter said and pulled out his quill and parchment, “Ready when you are Professor Malfoy.” Potter joked and Draco rolled his eyes.
“Have a seat then.” Leah motioned towards the two couches in one corner. “The purple folders are Toby’s work.”
“About that favour...” Pansy said, while shoving two sandwiches into Draco's hands. He had known she would collect that favour, but so soon? It was only Monday evening.
Harry nodded solemnly, “I know. I thought so too.” They stood in front of Dragon Cakes and Coffee for a moment, their silence becoming awkward.
‘Be reasonable’ he thought. ‘Pansy and Blaise were there, no one was bothered. Not everyone wants to beat the living shit out of you’. He took a deep breath, forcing his anxiety to calm down. They were only people, students like him, he could handle the other eighth years. Or well, some of them.
The ringing was still there when Draco stumbled out of the headmistress’ floo an hour later, only seemingly composed. Fortunately, the office was empty. With a racing heart and hectic breaths he left, each of Morris’ insults still reverberating in his head.
“Kiss Blaise for a solid minute.” Pansy ordered and the group whipped their heads around to look at him.
Ancient Runes with Hermione was rather fun and before they knew it, they had their whole text translated and simply settled into an easy chatter.
With a nod,  they were kissing. Soft lips shyly pecking his, a tingling in his fingertips and electricity running from his lips through his entire body. Harry pulled away and without much thought, both of them rushed forward again to meet each other in a more heated kiss. Hands were cupping cheeks, burying into hair and caressing skin; lips parted to allow their tongues to explore each other's taste.
Draco had done over the past few weeks, he had forgotten about how soon this visit to his parole officer was due. Yet here he was, nervously fidgeting with the hems of his sleeves while obediently climbing the stairs to the Headmistresses office.
“I´m sorry! Kingsley kept me longer than I wanted and I only escaped by literally running off. And then it was running late or showing up in my uniform”
A few minutes later, Draco speeds his thrusts up again and not after long, he slams into Harry hard and fast. Harry’s hands are back at grabbing Draco’s back, clutching to his shoulders, anchoring his fingernails into him.
Hermione had pulled Harry aside after the lesson and chastised him so thoroughly that Harry actually kept away from Malfoy after that, even keeping the stalking to a minimum. Which is why Harry was actually surprised when Malfoy came to him two days later.
Before David could turn away, Draco added, “Put it on my tab. I’ll come by next week anyways, I still owe you some of my cherry pie.” The last part was a lie, but he knew David would want details.
Pansy’s voice interrupted his thoughts, “Darling, nobody here is really innocent. They all have their demons to fight, and they all had to go through this war. You are not responsible for everything that happened, you aren’t even responsible for half the things you blame on yourself. Please, let me help you Draco.”
“It— It’s okay. Sorry for.. crying all over you,” sniffled Malfoy in response. He pulled his sleeves over his hands and dabbed away the last traces of tears on his face. Harry waved it off and got up; he was nearly at the door when Malfoy spoke up again.
No one batted an eye when they entered and so they strode towards the eighth year table. Pansy and Hermione scooted over to let the two of them join them at the table and when Draco looked into the proud eyes of his best friend, he knew he had made the right choice.
Hi! Random update time! It's one of the longer chapters and I just wanted to share this right now. Please let me know what you think of it.
This fic was originally supposed to be a 6 chapter, lighthearted drinking game fic. Safe to say I failed at that (although there will be drinking games) but I do hope you like it nonetheless.
Which is how Harry found himself in the current predicament; standing in a doorway with Malfoy of all people, looking at a small room with only one bed.
“Yes, Draco.” McGonagall spoke softly, Draco had almost forgotten she was there. “I asked Gemma here because I trust her and because I think that conversation based therapy is something you could greatly profit from. However, if you feel like either Gemma or the style of therapy are not a good fit for you, that is perfectly fine and we will look for a different option.”
She had a point. At their core they were still Slytherin, and they protected one another. Still, he could just spend that time in the relative safety of his dorm and just not face anyone.
Breakfast in the Great Hall was starting to feel almost normal again. Draco still went down when no one else was awake yet, but he didn’t need Hermione or Pansy to come with him. Instead he sat at the table alone, reading one of his Muggle YA books; he had discovered his love for the muggle fiction during his time ensconced in the manor, with only his parole ordered muggle studies tutor for company every now and then.
The hands were still loosely holding onto his wrists when the sobs and shaking subsided. Potter sat on the doorstep with him, facing Draco and cradling his hands. There was no pity, no disgust or anything else Draco expected in his features. Just an understanding sadness and compassion.
Realising he was staring, he averted his eyes just in time for Pansy to put down her quill and push her parchment away.
And suddenly Draco was almost bursting with the need to talk to her. “What you said about my parents last week… I- It-.. I couldn’t stop thinking about it.” He admitted.
“As much as it pains me to say, I do agree with you.” drawled Malfoy and elegantly placed his hand on the table, palm facing upwards. Harry wondered for a short moment how the git was able to make this simple gesture seem haughty and as though Harry should be thankful to be allowed to read his palm. With a sigh he reached into his bag and pulled his divination textbook out. He looked from his textbook to Malfoy’s hand and back again.
“How can I hate him and love him at the same time?” Draco asked, hoping the older woman could help him make sense of his emotions.
A few rounds later Draco found himself heading to his dorm. He was rather drunk and his social energy was drained. Dropping his uniform to the ground, he slid into bed in his boxers. His mind replayed his latest kiss with Blaise, and in his drunken state he realised how he missed being that close to someone.
They stood there in the empty classroom, Malfoy’s panting the only sound to be heard. Harry couldn’t move, couldn’t tear his eyes away from the anger-reddened face in front of him. After a few moments, Harry watched as Malfoy closed his eyes, pinched the bridge of his nose with his right hand and suddenly the whole room was completely silent as Malfoy held his breath.
Harry took a deep breath before looking him straight into the face, “Would you like to go on a date with me?”
That was if it were cast correctly, but Potter was unaffected by the bond and didn't even know it existed, so Draco was left to struggle with the pull of an unfulfilled bond, alone. It had started off slow. At first, he had been able to go multiple days before he needed to touch Potter, but slowly the time between grew shorter and shorter.
“In some ways yes and in some ways no.” Draco inhaled sharply at her admission, having hoped for a clear no. “Will you become successful and influential in your chosen field? I have no doubt of that. You will excel at whatever you chose to apply yourself, you won’t accept anything less from yourself, Draco. But will you become hateful, close-minded and cruel? I don’t think so.”
Without any warning, Draco vanishes Harry’s clothes into a neatly folded pile in the corner and the sudden onslaught of cold air forces another moan out of the Gryffindor. Instead of vanishing his own clothes too, Draco guides Harry to his bed, never breaking the kiss. He pushes the slightly smaller man onto his covers unceremoniously and maneuvers him swiftly into the middle of his bed, straddling him with jean-clad legs.
“Yes!” moaned Draco in reply.  Draco stopped his teasing of Harry’s one nipple and moved his left hand down to Harry’s belt, hooking his fingers through a loop. Draco pushed himself off the door and pulled Harry to his bedroom.
Aside from the practical experience, Mister Potter is also in possession of a Muggle degree in education, which he will be using to reform the Hogwarts curriculum in collaboration with the Headmistress herself.
When his breathing had finally returned to somewhere close to normal, he pulled himself together and forced himself to look into the mirror above the sink. Dark suit, light skin, sharp jaw and cheekbones, and white blond hair falling onto his chest.
“Wand!” Morris barked under the pretense of checking the spell history for any magic Draco wasn’t allowed to cast while on parole. But Draco knew better than that by now. Morris would take the wand, check it, and find absolutely nothing illegal. Then he would keep the wand for the rest of their meeting, leaving Draco even more defenseless.
“Listen here you slimy snakes. I am Harry’s Magical Guardian, and I will not leave until I get information about Harry.” Dumbledore roared rolling his eyes with Bellatrix’s polite lesson. The woman was a Black she wouldn’t know politeness if it bit her on the arse. While Kieran was sorted into Ravenclaw the moment he married Bellatrix Black and started giving the Black line more children, that made him a Slytherin in his mind.
“Kieran helps me into it, and you go out into the hall.” Harry told the witch he knew it was stupid that Bellatrix would be present for the scan and would see all of it anyway, but he felt more comfortable with the idea of Kieran.
“Dragons are very much real.” Regulus said nodding his head at Bellatrix and Kieran as they left. He figured they’d be going to his office to give him and the child a bit of privacy. He could feel the child watching his every move it was a feeling he was used to when working with children, teenagers, and the occasional adult.
Draco sighed and looked away from his paperwork to his watch and saw he still had five hours left until his shift at St. Mungo’s was over. He hated the days he filled in for their A&E department. It seemed like every time he tried treating a patient he was promptly kicked from the room. They claimed that even though Harry Potter had saved his arse from Azkaban he was still Death Eater scum and they refused to be treated by him. This was why after his trial he left for America to escape his name and all the weird looks. He had only been back for about three months, and he already regretted leaving America. After returning to England he much preferred the muggle world over the magical world. He only filled in on occasion at St. Mungo’s, he was employed full time at London Grace Children’s Hospital as a pediatric emergency room physician. He had changed after the war, and it was a change he was proud of. He felt a gentle tap on his shoulder and turned around to see a blonde Mediwitch in lavender robes handing him a file.
Kieran scribbled a note in the margin of the parchment about the abuse. He picked up his wand and moved his scan down to the neck and torso. The quill scribbling all the previous injuries just as rapidly as it did with the head. He grabbed the parchment once the quill dropped to the table and saw several other previous injuries. Harry had several prior neck sprains, broken his collarbone a few times, had a mangled Rotator Cuff. Several broken ribs: it looked like he had broken every single rib at least once in his small life. The child also had lung insufficiency due to respiratory infections like the Flu, Pneumonia, RSV, and Bronchitis. His internal organs also showed several bruises or contusions. What alarmed him the most was the fact was that Harry’s liver was severally damaged. He handed the two pieces of parchment over to Bellatrix to place into Harry’s file.
Kieran grabbed the chart from the table in front of him and waved his wand so that Regulus was keyed to the file. He didn’t particularly feel like discussing any of the words written on the parchment. He figured he’d let Regulus read the notes and ask questions when they arose. Right now, he just wanted quiet and to hear his wife’s breathing as the rage inside her settled.
“I figured Andromeda would bring Vivienne.” Kieran remarked taking a sip of the tea the elf had brought him earlier.
Harry cried at the idea of his liver failing. “I had no idea! I’ve never seen a doctor before you. I just read what the label said.
Harry dipped another bite of pretzel into the cheese he laughed softly of course Draco would choose the school with ties running back to his house. “Doesn’t Ilvormorny have their own houses like ours, what were you sorted into? I never liked Astronomy either, I was always falling asleep on the floor. Hermione was always nice enough to transfigure my notebook into a pillow. I just hated how late and boring that class was.” He muttered.
“Why don’t we go somewhere a little more quiet to speak.” Kieran suggested turning his attention to the sad half giant. “Hagrid, I just wanted to thank you for bringing him to us. You did the right thing for Harry.” He patted the Groundskeeper on the shoulder. He ignored the hateful look Dumbledore was sending him.
“Let’s announce it to the world, and a certain Healer who took care of me after Yaxley did a bloody number to my insides, and before you ask Ron, yes she is really pretty.” He lied well Draco was very handsome, but he was not telling them that he was getting drinks with a Slytherin prat.
“Here at St. Mungo’s, you are a guest and have no title. Also, according to the most recent info in the Daily Prophet you are no longer Chief Warlock. I believe that title went to Lucius Malfoy.” Kieran said watching one of the security guards fighting with Dumbledore.
Dudley saw Harry inspecting the mail and snatched it out of Harry’s hand and pushed Harry into a nearby wall. “Dad, the freak has a letter.” Dudley screamed handing the letter to his father the rest of the mail stack forgotten on a nearby shelf, after all it was just the bills and Vernon’s check from Grunnings.
“Pukwudgie, it favors the heart of the wizard.” Draco said breaking the last bit of pretzel in half and dipping his end into the cheese. “I actually had the option of Horned Serpent or Pukwudgie. I chose Pukwudgie, simply because I wanted to get away from snakes for a while.” Draco took a sip of his drink finding Harry easy to talk too.
Bellatrix came back the moment that Kieran was pulling up the sleeve of the sweater. “Grant went to talk to Hagrid about any information he could give us about the child.” She told her husband before going to crouch next to the child. “If you’d like to hold my hand while Kieran checks out your wrist you can. Also, you have some of the prettiest eyes I’ve ever seen.” She muttered sitting down on the stretcher and offering Harry one of her hands with black nail polish on her nails.
Draco smiled softly and handed Harry a copy of the discharge papers. “It’s my job, but I never did get an opportunity to thank you for saving mother and I from Azkaban, why don’t you and I get drinks tomorrow night assuming you are free. It’s the least I can do for what you did.” He said hoping that the Auror would accept.
“You mentioned I was being moved?” Harry questioned eyeing the shake sitting on the counter that looked to have some sort of white topping on it.
Bellatrix was feeling rage and lots of it at everything the child had suffered. Nobody should ever do that to a child. The Black Family rage was threating to make an appearance. She watched Kieran’s grab a soothing potion for burns and gently coat the burn. Luckily, Harry’s spine had no damage.
“Well how about bubblegum?” Bellatrix suggested knowing that if Kieran were right with his abuse assumption that Harry would need some help both physically and emotionally; and Kieran was usually spot on when it came to his gut assumptions on patients.
Harry took a sip of the Avocolada which tasted tropical. “That is good, and what about Pansy, Theo, Marcus, and Blaise?” He asked.
Bellatrix waved her wand in search of the file expecting it to land gracefully in her outstretched hand; but the only file that came was of Lily Potter, obviously the mention of Harry’s birth. “Well, he isn’t in the system. I was able to find the notes of his birth.” She said holding up the small folder not that the chart notes of his birth almost eleven years ago were helpful. “I’ll go have Grant talk to Hagrid about what he might know, might as well figure out what we can before Dumbledore shows up and tries to hinder everything. You know how he can be.”
“Severus is well, I’ll have to send him the information that Nymphadora the holy terror misses him. I can’t say he’ll feel the same way.” Regulus said grateful for Andromeda’s light family teasing before getting into the hard part of discussing Harry’s case and what the plan was. He would love to see the case go before a trial of the Wizengamot and see the Muggles get the punishment they deserved.
Harry walked down the block to an empty location between two shops and apparated back into his apartment stripping out of his clothes and into an old Gryffindor tee shirt and a pair of lounge shorts. He grabbed his clothes from the floor and tossed them into the laundry room. “Hey Kreacher.” Harry greeted the elf who was reading a newspaper at the table.
Harry hissed in pain as he felt the bone mend itself in his arm. It didn’t feel pleasant, but it seemed a lot better than Skele-Gro. “Yeah, you are a surprisingly good Healer.” Harry teased wiggling his wrist making sure it felt the same way before it was broken.
Kieran looked at his wife feeling confused. He had personally seen Draco Lucius Malfoy on Harry’s inner wrist and here Dumbledore was going on about how Harry was supposedly Ginevra’s soulmate.
Second of all I'm sorry. I know I am the worst when it comes to updating my stories. 2021 has been a really rough year for me personally and I have to be in the right frame of mind to write these stories and I just haven't. I'd like to say I'll get better at updating but I can't. So what I will say is I hope you enjoyed this chapter. Sorry about Umbridge she kind of snuck into this story and I let her stay.
Regulus could see the brain hamsters turning in their wheels in Harry’s mind. “What are you thinking about?” He asked curiously figuring he might be able to offer the child a suggestion or some adult guidance. “I promise everything you tell me is safe.”
Harry took the quill and looked over the discharge papers and smiled at the blonde healer. “Thank you for taking care of me.” He signed the paper in his signature messy handwriting that Hermione was always on him about. He didn’t really care about his handwriting it was at legible at least.
“Glad you are in less pain.” Kieran said gently lifting the jumper sleeve again and seeing the deep purple bruises along the wrist. “Alright kiddo what I’m going to do is run my wand over your wrist and it will tell me where it was broken and then I’ll fix it with magic.” He grabbed his wand from the wand pocket on his scrub pants and showed Harry the wand.
“Thank you both.” Regulus remarked hoping it would be easy for Harry after a few days after all his injuries were properly healed and Regulus was able to have a few sessions with Harry to talk about Andromeda and Vivienne. “If you do find things out from Mrs. Gray and if a prior investigation was conducted, could you please forward them to me?” He asked politely wanting to know exactly what Mrs. Gray might have seen.
He smiled watching Harry curl up with the dragon. He dimmed the lights in the room so that Harry could rest some more. He doubted the child was getting the proper amount of sleep needed for a child his age and knew that Hogwarts coursework could be quite impressive; better to let the child catch up on his sleep. He shut the door gently and cast an alert spell in case Harry started to panic or his physical health deteriorated. He could feel Kieran’s magic along the doorframe as well with a similar spell.
“Wait my parents weren’t drunks who died because they were driving drunk after a night trying to forget their mistake.”
Harry opened the bedroom and popped a few Paracetamol’s and downed a Dreamless Sleep potion. He had difficulty sleeping since the battle. It seemed like every time he closed his eyes he dreamed of all of those that had died. He went to the door a cast ‘Muffliato’ so that Teddy couldn’t hear his screams of terror. He removed his contacts and placed them in their container before stumbling his way to his bed. He felt the potion take effect and pull him into a blissful sleep only to be awoken three hours later to the sound of his tortured screams. Harry bolted upright in bed and held a pillow close to his chest letting his mind get the better of him. Sometimes he wished he would have died during the battle; for that would have to be a better alternative than his dreams.
Neville and Ron nodded silently they had seen enough as an Auror to know exactly where Harry was coming from at the moment. “Our world has changed for the better since the war.” Ron said honestly looking at the watch on his arm. “Damnit our lunch break is over, time to go back to paperwork.” He was deeply annoyed at the thought. He grabbed his bottle of juice and followed Harry and Neville to the elevator. He leaned against the wall of the elevator wishing he would have just called in sick and spent his day with his pregnant wife who was worshiping the toilet like it was Merlin.
“Yes, Mr. Potter what were you expecting the Minister of Magic?” Draco questioned he couldn’t just not tease Potter who was about the only one who could dish out some excellent insults and could keep up with his sharp tongue. He noticed that Harry was shaking uncontrollably one of the aftereffects of the Cruciatus Curse. “So, what happened?” He asked seeing a small laceration above Potter’s eyebrow.
“Harry, we have to go have a conversation with the Headmaster of Hogwarts, but before we’ll do, we will give you something to help with any prior pain you might be feeling, and it will make you a little drowsy. After we finish talking with him, we will be back to discuss the next steps when it comes to meeting with Healer Regulus and Andy and what to do when it comes to healing your prior injuries and breaks.” He said gesturing to the large stack of parchment outlining every single injury the child had been through since he was born until the present.
“Hello kiddo.” Kieran said softly in his thick Irish accent seeing bright emerald eyes staring at him.
“So, the great Harry Potter is gay?” Draco questioned finishing his drink trying to ease his nerves. “You might be gay, but what makes you think I am gay?”
Harry stepped out of the shower his back feeling slightly better, but he was still rather sore so he popped two Paracetamol into his mouth swallowed them. He would almost rather be heading to detention with Snape than getting ready for work, since he knew today would be a day full of questions and paperwork. He shoved his contacts into his eyes, he had always hated his glasses and unlike with his glasses he didn’t worry about breaking his contacts. He sighed walking over to his closet pulling out his black Auror robes and a navy blue dress shirt, brown boots, and pair of well-fitting grey trousers. He placed his wand in the dedicated wand pocket and bend down to tie his boots.
Harry sat down on the crib mattress and pulled up his shirt sleeve seeing the obvious break in the bone and the name that had made his life a living hell since they first noticed it. He gently ran a finger over the name wondering why it was there and why he was the only one in the family that had such a marking. He was also curious about the letter with the snake, lion, badger, and eagle wax seal; nobody had ever written to him before. Most people in the subdivision avoided him because Petunia had called him a problem child.
Bellatrix looked at her sister. “Harry’s letter was addressed to the Cupboard Under the Stairs and Surry. When Kieran and I asked about his home life and if we could do the full health scan, he mentioned Mrs. Gray calling social services and what a fat lot of good that did. I assume they tried and either the investigation didn’t go far, or someone from our world meddled.” She remarked sadly.
Bellatrix raised an eyebrow at her husband wondering what Dumbledore was getting at. She had seen Harry’s soulmate name and she was certain that her nephew wasn’t a Weasley. “Who is Harry’s soulmate?” She asked dumbly deciding to go along.
“They did what?” Bellatrix roared the books on the bookshelf shaking loudly again. “They told a child, a child the same as Elara that his parents died in a tragic car accident because they were booze hounds that hated him. I’m going to be fucking sick.” What she wanted was to apparate out of St. Mungo’s and into the sitting room of two very unsuspecting muggles and Cruciatus Curse them to the point where they were begging her to stop. It would probably be uncomfortable but nowhere near to what poor Harry had gone through.
“You just want to see my abs.” Harry snarked sticking his tongue at the healer as he slowly pulled off his shirt just to torment Draco only to wince in pain.
Harry looked down at his watch and sighed it was almost midnight. “I really hate to do this but I have to get up relatively early tomorrow.” He sighed not knowing how say the next part. “I really did have a great time tonight, and I was wondering if perhaps you’d like to go on a date?” He questioned if Draco wasn’t gay he’d just use the excuse of being super drunk.
Draco hadn’t heard the name Yaxley in years, just hearing that name struck fear all the way into his loafers and left him with a slightly nauseous feeling. “I did become a Healer, I see you became an Auror.” He teased lightly wondering what made Harry become an Auror, he knew the Gryffindor had always loved Quidditch, and he would have thought after the war, Harry would have want to do something happy. “Are you alright with me being your healer?” He questioned figuring he’d ask before doing anything to Harry.
She smiled and let out a worried breath she had been holding. “Thank Merlin. I’m glad that he is willing to give you a proper chance. I’m worried about him Reg. He’s so small but I can tell that deep down he is and will be an excellent child. Wait you told him about knowing James and Lily! How’d he take that?”
Kieran grabbed the tray from the table next to his side of the bed. “Bon Appétit.” He teased in a ridiculous French accent. He was sure Bellatrix’s Mother, Druella, would have taken serious offence to his pronunciation but he was trying to entertain the child He sat the tray down in front of Harry. “What would you like to drink with it? I can get you orange juice, apple juice, pumpkin juice, tea, butterbeer, water, or if there is a soda you can remember.” He usually didn’t condone soda but figured one glass of soda wasn’t going harm him.
“Merlin’s Saggy Testicles. Regulus, please send a Patronus to Healer Burke. The Aneurysm has ruptured, and he has a massive brain bleed along with recent seizure activity.” Kieran said gently as he lifted the almost weightless child back into the bed.
"You must admit, we look adorable," Potter replied. He finally raised his eyes to meet Draco's, and he was grinning like he'd gone around the twist. "We can look back at it and consider it our first date."
Ineville watched the others go, then moved to the edge of the cliff.  "Hello, down there!" he called in cheerful greeting.
Harry's semi-interested cock twitched and lengthened into full-on interest. "I'd, erm, love to join you, but we're somewhat stuck here. No wands, remember?"
"I was wondering the same thing," said Harry. He took a step back and tugged at his tie, sighing in relief when the knot loosened. Harry toed off his shoes, unbuckled his belt, and pulled the tails of his shirt free.
"It's just that...er...I was hoping we could ride the London Eye, and you probably don't want to do that after drinking even one glass of wine."
After a long moment spent on the cold ground, Harry sat up and rubbed his sore shoulder. "This is absurd," he muttered. "How are we to clean up the roadside if we can't even stand, let alone walk?"
"No, if I wanted to kill you, I would have hit you," Hagrid chuckled.  "I have very good aim."  He rose to his full height.  "I wanted to give you a fair chance.  Come, we will fight."
Draco shivered, right on cue. "I feel frozen," he muttered. "It's bloody cold out there, but I needed to harvest the winter-blooming witch hazel at its peak." As he spoke, he removed his gloves and toed off his boots.
"We can and we will," growled Zabini.  "Need I remind you two of everything I've done for you?  Ineville, you were a drunken lout," he said, addressing the dark-haired swordsman.  "Hagrid, you were in a traveling freak show until I rescued you and gave you a job."
Ineville seemed disappointed.  "When I was a boy," he said, "my father was killed by a man with six fingers.  The man commissioned a sword from my father, but when he came to get it, he wanted to pay much less than they had agreed upon.  My father refused, and the bastard ran him through.  I took up the sword to avenge my father, but the six-fingered man simply laughed and slashed my cheeks before riding away."
Draco crossed his arms and raised his chin in the manner he'd learned from the master. "Very well, Father. You leave me no choice. Potter, do you have a phonograph, like old Filch did at school?"
Dumbfounded, Harry could only gape at the slip of paper in his hand until the enormity of Malfoy's duplicity sank in.
Draco chuckled at Harry's petulant expression. "Since you've been a good sport about the bath, the tea, and the foot rub, I reckon I can reward you with a shag," he said. "I believe I'm sufficiently warmed up now."
Malfoy muttered unkind things and cautiously put one foot on the cobbles. He attempted to push off from it and stand, but his foot skidded. He cried out and flailed, snagging Harry's coat as he fell and dragging Harry down with him.
Harry's eyes opened.  "Where am I?" he asked. "What happened?"  His speech was slurred, and he was incapable of movement.
The hair at Draco's nape rose at the sound of that familiar voice. He slowly turned and found himself face to face with his father's spirit. Draco's emotions ran the gamut from disturbed to perturbed. "Never mind what I'm doing here, Father. What are
Harry felt his back teeth grind together and had to consciously relax his jaw. "You expect me to whore myself out for information?" Inwardly, he was seething, but his ruddy cock was reacting with a surge of interest.
"Never mind," Draco sighed, brightening as he found the album he wanted. "Oh, this one is my favorite!"
"Yes, sir," said Harry. He pushed himself away from the vanity sink, paused to admire Draco in bubbles, then left to fetch his husband the promised cup of tea.
She narrowed her eyes on her hapless victims. "Now then, who's hungry? I'm a mite peckish myself, and you two look like a tasty pair of morsels." Her body blurred and transformed into a large, shaggy dog. She was an Animagus!
Harry wanted to rail against Malfoy's smug assertions, but he didn't dare open his mouth. It was far too likely that moans of pleasure would tumble forth, adding to his humiliation. Fortunately, Malfoy ceased his taunts as he seemed to concentrate on wanking and fucking in tandem. When Malfoy finally hit his stride, the first whimper fell from Harry's lips. He couldn't help himself. Malfoy's thick cock was filling him perfectly and rubbing all the right spots, while his hand knew just what to do on Harry's straining erection. That little squeeze at the base and twist at the tip drove Harry mad with lust. He arched his back and matched his movements to Malfoy's.
Salzaria drew back and cocked her head at him. Her attention turned to the opening of the cavern when Hedwig landed on the ledge with a scrape of talons.
Draco grabbed his wand back and eyed Harry with suspicion. "I don't think I'm in the mood any longer."
"Don't blame me," said Harry. "My husband was out harvesting witch hazel, and I was bored and randy."
Harry found it difficult to let go. "We're blokes," he stated. "They could have scattered something more manly across the bed."
Malfoy chuckled as he drew back and slid in again smoothly. His cool hands gripped Harry's waist, holding him steady as he fucked Harry with slow, measured strokes. Harry wished he would just bang away and get it over with. He widened his stance as much as he was able to with his trousers and pants around his knees, bracing himself against the force of Malfoy's thrusts. Malfoy's thighs bracketed Harry's hips, and the friction of his trousers against Harry's bare skin created additional stimulation. He wanted desperately to touch himself, jerk his prick until he blew his load, just for the relief of release. Harry resisted the temptation.
Their swords clashed again and again, striking sparks while the combatants dueled.  Ineville was stunned when the masked man disarmed him.  He sank to his knees on the sand.  "Kill me quickly," he requested with quiet resignation.
Draco was relieved when Potter's attention immediately returned to the dossier on his desk. He was definitely not disappointed. Draco reached for his own copy of the dossier, intent on leaning about their next assignment.
"I hope our guests were having too much fun to realize we skived off," Harry replied with a grin. "We paid the hotel dearly to keep the champagne flowing, the nibbles coming, and the music playing."
Harry sifted his fingers through Draco's short blond hair, and his heart melted when Draco turned to smile at him. Harry hated to start this row, but it had to be done.
Draco's brows climbed. That sounded dire. "Potter? Once you dredge up your phonograph, you'd best collect the salt and sage, too."
Draco turned to see Potter approaching him. Even with his hair standing up more than usual and a worried frown on his face, he was still quite the dish.
Draco's mood was much improved when he came home that evening. They had a nice dinner and spent the rest of the evening relaxing in the lounge. Harry watched a film on the telly, while Draco sat at the opposite end of the sofa, reading a book. Their legs were tangled together, and Harry took the opportunity to engage in some flirtatious footsie. Draco was sending him heated looks, and Harry's entire body was thrumming with desire by the time they went up to bed.
Draco rolled his head to the side to smile at Harry. "Sounds delightful," he replied. "You're far too kind. Is there something you need to tell me?"
"It's meant to be romantic," said Draco. He drew his wand and Vanished the petals with a quick wave. "There, that's better."
In the meantime, Snaperdinck was also on the trail of his betrothed.  He and his men came across the area where the sword fight had taken place.  The Half-Blood Prince traced the footprints in the sand, determining which way the winner had gone.  He mounted his horse and led his soldiers in that direction.
"Draco, maybe you should see a Healer," Harry suggested gently. "Your appetite is waning, and this isn't the first time you've been ill."
Draco took two short hops away, already missing the warmth of Potter's body. He closed his eyes and concentrated, hoping to effect a reverse transformation. Nothing happened. Draco opened his eyes and saw Potter, still in cat form, where he'd left him.
Hagrid laid Harry on the table, and Max bent over and placed an ear to Harry's chest.  "He's mostly dead," he pronounced.  "However, that's better than being all the way dead."  Max looked at his guests.  "For a miracle to work, there has to be a good reason for it to happen."
Zabini only glared at him.  "When he reaches the top, kill him," he ordered.  Zabini grabbed the rope that bound Draco's hands and began tugging him away.
Harry took the rest of the day off to stay with his husband while Draco was undergoing magical surgery. Harry was there to observe, while Healer Liddell performed the intricate spells that would repair Draco's shoulder. She seemed satisfied with the results, and Draco was taken to recovery.
Draco's brows lifted in surprise. "The logistics may be problematic," he said. "What I was going to suggest is a foot rub."
Harry teetered between amusement and affront. He settled on affront. "Shame on you," he chided. "Spouses are meant to share."
"Sure enough that I've already spoken to the head of my Ward," said Harry. He squeezed Draco's hand. "Are we going to do this?"
Harry frowned. "No mention was made of paying for your information," he said. "However, I am certain Robards would approve the request, as the information you have is vital to our case."
"Okay, I'm moving," grumbled Harry. He drew back slowly, smirking when Draco twitched and hissed as Harry's cock dragged over his prostate. He thrust in again and repeated the process until he'd established a smooth rhythm. Draco signaled his approval by hooking his ankles behind Harry's back and clutching at his shoulders with strong fingers. Harry suspected he'd have bruises in the morning, but this was completely worth it.
On one such day, Draco encountered three strangers by the trail.  The bloke in the lead hailed Draco and asked if there was a village nearby.
"But, that's just it," Harry interrupted. "If you injure that shoulder once more, you may never have full use of your arm afterward."
Ineville drew his sword and gazed at it.  "This is the sword my father created.  I will meet the six-fingered man again, and when I do, I will say to him, 'Hello. My name is Ineville Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die"
"I'm not a witch, I'm your daughter," said the young woman.  She beamed at Ineville and Hagrid. "My name is Luna.  Please forgive my father, he's lost his confidence ever since the Half-Blood Prince sacked him."
"Yeah," Harry replied with a nod. Eating them counted as disposal, right? He hadn't suffered any ill effects.
Lucius cackled like a madman. "You have no power over me," he sneered. "And neither does that mewling brat," he added, pointing at Potter.
A vaguely familiar room came into view, but Draco's attention was drawn to Potter, who was pacing back and forth. "Potter?"
This time, it was Harry who caught his breath. He exhaled on a groan when Draco delved deeper and squeezed his aching cock. "Draco... I'm not going to last..."
Draco tilted his head, and they indulged in a lingering kiss, which was much more satisfying than the brief snogs they'd shared during their wedding after-party.
Draco felt the stiffness seep from his shoulders and spine. "That's what I'll do then," he decided. "Thank you, Harry."
"You were taking too long," said Harry. He unbuttoned his fly but paused when he realized Draco was simply standing there and watching him. "Are you going to participate or spectate?"
"Father, I must insist you leave here at once," he said. "If you are not yet ready to continue your journey, then you will need to haunt somewhere else."
Harry set the lube aside and moved to straddle his husband. He reached back to position Draco and said, "I'll be gentle."
Once Draco gathered his scattered wits, he convinced himself that he was glad Potter had drawn back. No doubt the passion between them resulted from their recent brush with disaster. Draco licked his lips, adjusted the front of his trousers, and followed his partner to the Ministry.
Harry shrugged from where he sat on the cold cobbles. "Fix them later," he said. He turned onto his uninjured hip and climbed slowly to his feet. Harry's right foot slipped and he pitched forward, catching himself on his hands. It was painful, and he swore under his breath.
"I simply want a second opinion, love," said Harry. "Try to relax, and I'll be back in a moment. Do you need anything for pain relief?"
"What? No!" Draco hissed back. When he realized that Harry was laughing at him, he gave his partner a shove.
"Before I decided it's not to my liking," Draco replied, voice prim and expression daring Harry to pursue the subject.
"We're no longer boys, Harry," chided Draco. "No more furtive frotting or hurried hand jobs. We're married now, and we have all night."
Ineville batted it away with his own sword.  "My name is Ineville Montoya," he repeated.  "You killed my father. Prepare to die."  Ineville parried another attack by Rodolphus.  "My name is Ineville Montoya," he said again, voice growing stronger.  "You killed my father. Prepare to die!"
Harry was coming to regret his decision when the two boys tore through the house and jumped on the furniture. They would halt their shenanigans when Blaise reprimanded them, only to turn around and get into more mischief. Daphne was occupied with the baby, and Harry noted with a sinking heart that Draco seemed to have little interest in the youngest Zabini.
