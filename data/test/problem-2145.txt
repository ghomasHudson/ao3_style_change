He looked in the mirror one last time, shaking the dust off of his hand.

The faint blush on Luna's cheeks made Harry;s jaw drop. "No! You like him?!" He sounded momentarily shocked before leaning forward in his chair. "Tell me everything."
“No.” Draco cut him off. “I don’t and I never will regret our dance. I’d do it a million more times in front of the entire world. This isn’t your fault. It isn’t even my fault. This is just the press, desperate for a story.” He looked at the paper once more before something seemed to click on his head. “You thought I looked handsome?” He looked back up at Harry with a grin.
Their hearts were filled with admiration and attraction towards the other. They each liked the other more than they cared to admit. But neither of them said anything.
"Yea, but you're a cute furnace."
When a letter from Gringotts arrived the next day he was ecstatic, but upon arriving at the bank, it was an entirely different story. The last time he was there, he and his friends impersonated Bellatrix Lestrange, broke into her vault, and stole a dragon. Sure, it may have been a necessary evil, but that didn’t stop him from being incredibly tense and overly-polite from the moment he stepped inside.
Maybe this year, they shouldn’t.
Remus had a huge smile of his face as tears were rolling down it. He knew he made the right decision by leaving Harry as Teddy’s godfather. He was making Teddy’s first Christmas as special as he could and he already wanted to give Teddy the world. He let out a laugh as he wiped his eyes, telling Nymphadora about how wonderful their son’s first Christmas was going to be.
“How do you feel now?” Draco asked.
Hermione raised an eyebrow, seeming a mix of shocked and amused. “Well, that could be worse.” She remarked, “Would you say that you’re friends now?”
Harry thought a moment, and for a second, his mind drifted to a Queen song. Of course, he knew there was no point in bringing up a band Draco wouldn't recognize, but it reminded him of a song he liked, Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy. Since the first time he heard the song, he insisted on calling every significant other his "lover". Even back when all he could do was ogle Krum or flirt with Diggory, he would speak of one day making them his "lover". He'd even had the same terrible thoughts of Bill Weasley, and for a brief moment of his life, Sirius Black. But then again, no one could deny they were lookers. So against better judgement, he make his suggestion. "What about lover?"
Until Harry got another blow.
Neville was furthering his studies in Herbology. He’s started helping Professor Sprout take care of her plants, and he’s started working with Draco to understand the plants. Being a Healer, Draco had a mutual interest with Neville in plants that can be used in potions or on their own to heal people. He’s learned to care for the different plants in the Herbology department and often comes in on weekends and cares for the plants on his own.
He returned with nothing but pajama pants and his glasses on. He laid down beside Draco with a grin on his face. “It’s almost your birthday.”
Draco has been waiting his entire life to finally have a group of people who talked shit about Harry like he did. Now that he finally had it, he was having the time of his life.
“At least I have a job.”
Draco had his Transfiguration and Herbology exams the next day. He was especially worried about Herbology as that was the one most related to his future career in medicine.
“I think these letters need to stop because they only seem to stroke your ego.”
It took all of Harry’s willpower not to snort since he was the only one who knew what NASA was.
Draco’s breath was stolen and he gave in to the demand without thought, mindless and obedient to the divine display before him. He let himself move harder and faster inside the boy, the slap of skin getting louder as his gasps were overcome by groans and whines. He could already feel the tingling anticipation of the edge. If not for his mind being clouded by desire, he might have felt embarrassed by how quickly Harry got him there.
He nodded. "And you're a Hufflepuff."
Part of him was impressed that she used the financial department as a scapegoat, but it was also her greatest mistake. Never offend the wrong person, or they'll root for your downfall. Given how eager they were to gossip about her, Harry was almost positive that this bit of news wasn't such a secret within the Ministry, but if it ever got out, that would certainly be a shame for Crow.
Draco let out a chuckle and he moved to sit on Harry’s thighs, leaning into his chest. He felt those strong arms wrap around him and an excitement spread through him. “You’re still wearing your necklace.” He commented.
"I don't much like thinking about that. Technically, I did, but I don't want to be a hero. I just want to be Harry."
Harry stumbled into his sitting room with an apology already on his tongue. He saw Draco was sitting on the sofa, reading a book, hardly even noticing him. “I’m so sorry I’m late. Shacklebolt put me and Hermione on a new project, we’ve spent all day trying to figure this out, and we have no clue what we’re doing.” His voice was dripping with stress, but he still felt guilty.
Draco saw his opportunity and took it. “My arse.”
“Wonderful. We’ve got a flat together and we’re working in the Department of Magical Sports and Games. We’re trying to revamp all the merch, and Dean wants to be an official referee for the Quidditch World Cup.” Seamus explained with a grin, sounding proud of Dean.
Even Draco was a bit surprised, but he saw how proud Harry was, and brushed it off.
Harry smiled, “Perhaps it isn’t, but it’s preferable to have you lot talk to me casually.” The whole situation was strange enough, but the formal language was just the final nail in the coffin. With a more casual tone, he felt that their conversations would be a bit easier for him to have.
Harry nodded. “Of course, and I love them very much.”
“I'm helping you out because I want to see this department made. Go with him and it'll take years to work out all the loopholes that'll end up in the laws associated with the new department. You need to go with Greenwood.” She said as she pulled a cigarette out of her robes and lit it up.
Draco’s glare intensified and he quickly shot up from his seat, slamming his hands on the table. “You’d better shut up, Potter!” He wasn't just embarrassed by his choice of literature, but in some ways, he was ashamed, and he hated that. He wanted to embrace the thing that gave him joy, he wanted to be proud of it, but it was difficult.
“Don’t worry about it.” Draco interrupted, not wanting to talk about what his ex-friend almost did.
That night, when Seamus was telling everyone how his undertaking in potions went, Ron agreed that Draco does gaze into Harry’s eyes often.
“And you took the time to learn these spells, why?”
Charlie's smile dropped when the director left and he stepped forward. "Listen, Malfoy. I want to like you, I do, I want us to get along. More importantly, I want you and Harry to get along.” He was only a meter from Draco and still stepping closer. “Harry has been through more horrors and trauma than you could imagine, and he's trying so hard to get better. That man is far too kind for his own good. He'll try to trust you, he'll try to be friends, so don't hurt him. But don't do it because I told you not to, do it because he has three dragons at his side who are now old enough to spit flames."
Thankfully, their clothes were casual enough to pass in Muggle or wizarding society. They quickly took to the streets of London and went to a public library. Harry was a bit surprised to see Hermione pulling out an old library card to get access to the computers, but by the same token, it was strangely endearing. He’d missed regular libraries and the internet.
"Electricity." Pansy mumbled the word, realizing it sounded familiar. "I remember Granger wrote a paper on electricity in muggle studies, I'll have to ask her about that."
Their eyes widened and they looked at each other as if they should have known. Unfortunately, it spurred a half-hour conversation on the schematics of it. Harry did his best to hide his impatience and eventually got the conversation back on track. They nearly dismissed his revival of the topic of Pawk’s bill but agreed that they were voting in favor of it. His sigh of relief was nearly audible. When they offered more drinks, he politely declined and said he had to get going to meet a friend, but thanked them for conversation and paid for their drinks thus far.
“Touch and words of affirmation.”
The first line gave him a strange sense of ease. This was the best reaction he could have hoped for.
Harry started walking out, when he felt a light tap on his shoulder, he turned around and saw Draco standing there. “Hey, Potter. I uh. I just wanted to thank you, for what you did. I know it must be hard to defend an enemy.”
“You make it sound like we can’t control ourselves.”
She took a very direct approach as she wasn’t one to beat around the bush. She brewed Amortentia and carried it with her to study potions with Dean and Seamus.
They talked about how Harry was doing in school and about what he wanted to do for a career. The conversation went over to Draco when Harry mentioned that they’re roommates.
Harry wasn’t the only one crying.
Draco’s concern melted to a shocked disbelief, “Did you?”
Draco gave a slow nod and finished his tea. “He’s asleep right now.”
Though he spared the food a few glances, he was much more focused on the man before him. It was at first out of excitement. He was happy that his work was finished and there was a sense of accomplishment that glowed inside of him. But as he stared, he got another reason to watch his lover. Harry was wearing his rugged muggle clothes. His outfit was casual and ordinary by any muggle standards, but to Draco, Harry might as well live in a log cabin. Draco was in his lounge clothes; cuffed joggers, a shirt, and slippers; all the same shade of light brown. It looked expensive. Draco always looked expensive. Being from a world of modesty, expensive fabrics, and fashionable robes; this was almost exotic. Though he would never wear it himself, Draco found an appreciation for muggle clothes.
Harry looked up and put the journal down, Draco was about to say something else until he saw Harry’s face. His cheeks were blotchy and his eyes were overflowing with tears.
Beyond staring at Draco and worrying, he didn't have much to do. He ended up talking to Astoria and Daphne for a while. He made sure they were alright and asked about how Astoria was feeling. She said she was fine, but he could tell that she was saddened by something.
Harry was practically floored because he had never realized how big of a connection Draco was to Teddy. Up until then, he never would have guessed that Draco could be related to so many prominent people in his life.
“That last one might be a problem. Draco has an extensive sex life and it quite interested in me.”
“I love rain.”
“Well, after the first year we can do it annually. But I was hoping we could start off celebrating month to month.”
He’s also been talking to the Marauders more. Usually once a week, they ask about all kinds of stuff. His friends, their ambitions, his ambitions, Teddy, Draco, the arrests and prosecutions of dark witches or wizards, they wanted to know about everything. Prongs had also become very open with Harry, offering advice and telling about his own experiences. Harry was glad that he wasn’t the only one revealing information about himself. It was a bit awkward to tell your life story to a bunch of strangers, but it was a bit less so when one of those strangers was being just as open as you.
Regardless, he didn’t want to go outside.
Seamus grinned and laughed while Dean buried his face in Seamus’ shoulder, the both of them suddenly aware of what Draco was implying.
“Good.”
Harry, Hermione, and Ron take their last train ride to Hogwarts. Along the way they see old friends, and upon arrival, they see how Hogwarts has changed.
He nodded, not trusting his own voice. He was nearly shaking.
“I know, in a cupboard, a room with five guys, your best friend’s room, in a house where you had to be quiet, and now you’re with me. But seriously, how many times?”
Harry was making dinner for the fifteenth night in a row and Draco felt a strange sense of guilt. Harry had done his laundry, kept the house clean, worked, and cooked two meals a day. But Draco has done nothing besides sit around. It was a sharp contrast to what he feared going into the marriage. He was afraid of being starved, beaten, treated like a slave. He feared the anger of the situation, the frustration, but also he understood why those things weren’t present. They were both tired of fighting and being angry. They were worn down. Yet here Harry was, taking on responsibility while Draco wasn’t expected to lift a finger. Draco was being taken care of. He didn’t deserve it, and he felt like he should be doing more.
“Sure, what is it?” Draco didn’t even look up from his book on potions, completely unaffected by Harry’s words. He’s gotten to the point where he’s used to all of Harry’s quirks and doesn’t even blink twice anymore.
Teddy was also doing great. He could sit up, he knows his name, and he could speak a few words. His favorites included “nanny”, “no”, “bad”, “go”, “arry”, and “dayco”
Harry was chided by the sight of Draco crawling onto the bed and muttering a spell that made one of his hands slippery and wet with some mysterious clear liquid. It took him only a second to realize it was some kind of lubricant.
With the media rumors of love potions and curses being used, this escalation in their relationship only called for further questioning. After all, someone might be in danger of abuse or under the influence of serious magic. As far as they were concerned, a crime very well may have been committed. Especially when one considers that only eight months ago, Draco stood by Voldemort's side and Harry was thought to be dead. Yet they were suddenly married now. From the outside it made no sense. It wasn't a far leap to assume foul play or magic was involved.
It was no secret he was a bit of an attention whore.
Music played and people danced for hours. Draco and Harry most of all. Both were eager to show-off the muggle music that they had taken a liking to together, mainly ABBA. But they were sure to play plenty of music by wizard artists as to not make the majority of their guests feel alienated.
He wouldn’t see his friends everyday again, he wouldn’t be a student with a simple school life. Perhaps he had grown too attached to his last year at Hogwarts. He almost felt like he had lost something big. The castle that protected him in the war, the peers and teachers that stood by him, the laughs, the smiles, the tears, the way that had all grown together for nearly a decade, everything was all just a memory now.
Teddy babbled a little bit.
Harry walked up to the door and hesitated, wondering if maybe he should turn back. His nerves about being turned away were lighting up inside his brain.
Checkmate.
Draco gulped as he realized that he likes Harry as much more than a friend.
Draco nodded and grinned at the other’s eagerness. He watched the man begin pulling his own pants off, soon laying naked on his back in the middle of their bed.
“Good thing it’s my left arm.”
Harry only ever looked away from Draco to glance at Daphne Greengrass, Astoria’s sister, and apparently, the only one to ever visit her. He felt a bit bad for Astoria. Ever since the war, she had drastically changed. She wanted nothing to do with the old ways and Harry was proud of her. But that left her alone and isolated. He decided that if she ever woke up, he would try to talk to her more. Since her old friends and most of her family didn’t really care for her, she ought to have new friends. She deserves as much.
“Don’t worry about it, Malfoy.”
“Do you really want to work at Hogwarts when you graduate? Why not St. Mungo’s?” He decided to try a bit of small talk. He had also been pondering he question for a while now.
“I don’t know. He’s one of the most famous artists in the world.”
Some powerful emotion overcame Harry and he sat up, looking down at his lover with teary eyes. He wasn’t even sure why he was so emotional, but there he was, nearly falling apart over it.
Harry was quick to respond. “Of course I do! I love it.” His cheeks went pink. “I do like giving. I like seeing and hearing you. I suppose I just have a hard time asking for things like that. It’s embarrassing. It’s embarrassing to ask, to moan, squirm, everything.”
Draco woke up in Harry’s bed and saw his friend with another stack of books. Suspicion washed over him as he immediately suspected Harry hadn't slept that night and stayed up reading instead. But he dismissed the thought from his mind and decided that Harry couldn't possibly be that invested in reading. “When did you wake up?”
Draco raised an eyebrow, “Well it’s quite simple. Because you’re sweet as honey and you know it. Alas, I’m still waiting for the day I get to see for myself.”
Harry looked back down.
Although he didn't consider himself a celebrity, he was very aware of the power his name had, especially written on a bill. There was a weight to it that he used to despise, but now, he was finally seeing how to use it to his advantage. "So, how exactly to you plan to take on the wizard elite?" It wasn't that he doubted her ability, but he needed to know what to expect. All his wars and battles had been physical, he had never been in a legal battle like this.
“Yes, why?”
"This is hilarious." He said as he read it over. It was all about how Harry is a hero, is gorgeous, and has a bit of money. It goes on to wonder how he could possibly be single. Next is Draco, referred to as a man with a good heart who eventually came around to do good. It praised his genius in Hogwarts and his sense of fashion before questioning how he didn't have someone on his arm at all times.
He decided to Floo home for lunch since there wasn't much he could do without dirt on Luther. Draco was sitting on the sofa, frantically writing in a writer's book. The difference between this and a regular journal is that the parchment was enchanted. One could erase the ink on it or move words around. Harry figured it was as good as a computer. Though he was oddly proud to see Draco was using a pen rather than a quill and ink.
Harry looked into Draco’s grey eyes. “Happy New Year, Draco. And thank you.” His cheeks went a bit red as he confessed, “I might have to take you up on that, later.”
“Alright. I like it when he dresses up really nice. Like in his blazer and dark pants. Or even when he wears a long coat and a scarf. Something about it is just really attractive.”
He climbed on top of Harry and shook him.
Harry was a bit surprised at Draco’s analysis. He was mostly surprised at how Draco knew so much about flowers.
Draco nodded in agreement.
Draco immediately remembered that story and bit his lip. “Unimportant.”
He didn’t.
In the week before going to Wizengamot for the vote on Pawk's anti-discriminatory bill, Harry received three pieces of good news.
He got louder, moans and soft cries escaping between pants. His hand went faster and faster as his hips started to buck wildly and tremble. The rough pad of his thumb continued to tease his tip and his thighs began to shake.
He checked the time and found it was six in the morning. Roughly five days ago, he was woke up by Draco because he was sleeping on his arm.
With that, they got up and headed out, venturing into the cold and heading towards the shops. They glanced through the windows to see if there was anything they were interested in, giving each other suggestions on gifts.
“I didn’t realize everyone was related.”
Harry nodded, “I think we’re exactly the same. When I was born, I was born to die. It wasn’t my choice. Those around me decided my fate, put me on a path, and pushed me towards it. The same thing happened to Draco. Being a Death Eater and being on the side of Voldemort was his future, completely undetermined by him, and forced upon him by those around him. I was raised as a pig for slaughter and Malfoy was raised to believe in blood. We are exactly the same, but we were born on different sides of the war.”
“I’ll do it then.” He winked and began to leave the bedroom to start his day.
The hand on his chest flew away and rested on his hip instead. It was a shallow victory, but a victory nonetheless. “Good boy.” He wanted to rub it in.
Now Harry was the one who was surprised. He genuinely didn't expect the conversation to be so serious and formal. He expected some teasing and maybe a bit of messing around, but the fact that Draco took it seriously was strangely flattering. "Oh, well. Uhm. I haven't really done much so, I-I don't know. Uh. Could you go first?"
When Draco came out he wrapped Harry in a hug, “Merry Christmas.” Maybe it was how close they’d become, maybe it was Harry’s slip-up, maybe it was the holiday spirit, but he was feeling a bit affectionate.
“Meeting starts in a few minutes in the common room.”
“Oh, no. You aren’t allowed near my neck again. Not with that mouth. That thing isn’t allowed below my face.”
With a deep breath, he closed the door behind him. He was doing this to ensure Pawk's success, yes, but it was all to leave Wizengamot and focus on Draco. In the end it all came down to Draco.
Harry finally took his seat by Draco twenty minutes after he had originally gotten up to get food. He gave a sheepish smile and said, “That took a bit longer than expected.”
He felt like he was on top of the world. Like he had finally achieved everything he had fought for and that nothing could stop him now. Of course, he still occasionally had the looming doubt that maybe things weren’t really as good as they seemed. As if some day he would wake up and his scar would be red and irritated again, as if one day someone would try to kill him again. In his mind, a million things could still go wrong. But this time, he also had hope that everything would be alright.
Lucius was under the impression she was currently out with the Parkinsons, of which Mrs. Parkinson had lied for Narcissa.
Armed with his newfound intelligence on some members of Wizengamot and the important of getting Pawk's bill passed, Harry's face turned quite serious when he entered Wizengamot. He started making conversation with people he hardly knew in order to work his way around the room, slowly making his way to the few that piqued his interest. Of the seven members of Wizengamot that Harry was unsure about, five expressed that they were definitely voting in favor of the bill. That relaxed him just enough that he decided not to go through with his threats. In face, he was thankful for it. Making threats when he was about to retire seemed exhausting.
Harry sat down with Seamus, Neville, Dean, Ron, and Hermione. Luna went to her seat at the Ravenclaw table.
“My what?” Draco had never heard the term before, but he had a few harrowing ideas as to what it meant.
Harry stood up and his dragons followed him out. "It's a ten minute walk from here." He said as he took Draco outside. "We call them shacks but they aren't actually that bad. It's a sitting room and kitchen, the bathroom's behind the kitchen, and there's a bedroom on either side. I know it isn't much, but there's a Floo if you'd rather be at home." As Harry spoke, one of the dragons began chasing a hare. It slowly followed their prey before burning it alive, feasting on the cooked flesh. Harry looked upon the slaughter with a fond expression, proud of the little one’s kill. “You know certain dragon species, like the Romanian Longhorn, are some of the only animals besides humans that prefer cooked meat.” Harry mentioned as he watched the dragon eat their kill. He praised the dragon in Parseltongue and it wiggled in glee.
on a scrap of parchment. The ink disappeared and reappeared on a scroll that the Head Warlock held. He unraveled it after the vote and came to realize that an overwhelming majority voted in favor of the creation of the department.
He threw himself so completely into his writing. He edited, added and deleted scenes, reworked entire chapters. He did everything he could. But the ending was his favorite part. He decided that there was no real need for some proper ending. There was no ending conflict needed to be surpassed to end it. He certainly didn’t want to end it right when his characters got together. That was only boring. Exploring relationships can be so fun. It’s amazing to see how two people interact once they’re actually together. How they treat each other, interact, talk, how different they become when domesticated. So many things can change and so many different traits can become known. Like how Harry spent far too much time checking himself in the mirror, or Draco’s ability to take the world’s longest baths.
But now that Harry was finally getting over his physical ailments, Draco thought it was the perfect time to get back on his plan to make Harry his. He had to briefly abandon it when Harry got injured. But now that he was healed, he was ready to turn up the charm once more.
"That would be lovely. Oh, and get some wine too, we forgot. Just grab a Zinfandel." As far as pasta went, one couldn't go wrong with a Zinfandel. So with that, Harry was off.
“Too late, I’ve already decided. Tomorrow I’m going to tell McGonagall to add me to the list of students that are staying over break.”
“I can’t help I enjoy pretty things. So why don’t you come a little closer and let me enjoy you?” He winked.
The body atop his froze.
Somehow, even the short blonde hair was just as pale and soft as the hair up top. Draco was absolutely angelic. Pallid with a pinkish-brown tip, everything about Draco was so dulcet and gentle. Even like this, wound up and eager, he was still somehow so pastel and sweet.
“Is Sirius there? He must be. Him and my parents and Remus should never be separated.”
Somehow, this was worse that if some anonymous source had leaked the full truth. This left much to be speculated and he didn't like the public being able to come to their own determinations. That's what lead people to think that he or Harry might have the other under some spell or curse.
Draco raised an eyebrow and let out a scoff. "If I wasn't holding Calypso I'd drag you back inside and prove you wrong in a heartbeat."
Draco does whatever he has to to make sure Harry is okay.
Draco pressed two fingers to Harry’s opening. “Glorious.” He slipped them in and began to seek.
“I understand. A lot of your letters are thrown away if I don’t get to them first. You don’t need to be sorry, I am. I’m afraid Lucius doesn’t want much to do with you anymore. Merlin, I tried reasoning with him. I’ve tried over and over again but he won’t hear it! Your rebelling is what kept you alive and free, and that’s so much more important to me than you recognizing your status above mudbloods.”
Harry couldn’t say no.
He furrowed his eyebrows, moving his hand a bit faster and keening into the pleasure. His head tilted back but he didn’t dare to make a sound. Even though he was a few rooms down, Draco was a bit worried about being caught. But that only made things worse as he was thrust into a guilty fantasy about Harry hearing him, walking in, and taking care of Draco’s issue himself.
Harry silently nodded.
It was then that Draco realized how old his mother was. Of course, he never thought her old. But the tired lines on her face, the grey streaks that Draco used to see as an aesthetic benefit, and her thinning frame made Draco realized how worn down she really was. Before the war she was as radiant as a young woman. But now, she was brittle and exhausted with age, the weight of the war speeding up the aging process. And now, this.
Harry let out a soft laugh, not wanting to wake up Draco. He glanced over at the sleeping blonde and smiled. “He is.” He agreed.
“No!”
They wanted Harry to testify at Draco’s next court hearing.
Harry, however, had quite a busy day. He spent it running around, trying to make everything perfect for Draco’s birthday. He spent his morning in the library, researching flowers to try to come up with the perfect bouquet. He found himself going off of appearance, until he realized that many flowers have particular meanings associated with them. Then he found himself with an obscure list of pretty flowers with romantic meanings, before he realized that Draco probably doesn’t know or care anything about the flowers’ meanings. Now he had two feet of parchment and three hours down the drain.
” Severus explained, waving a hand slowly towards one of the bruises quickly fading on Harry’s cheek. Narcissa had given him a quick look over before leaving them just to make sure he wasn’t hiding any terrible injuries and had cast a few small healing spells to hurry his bruises along, but she was no mediwitch and could only do so much outside of an official setting without the ministry finding out. “
"Hmm? Oh nothing, you're just..." Aziraphale smiled and shook his head. "You are very good with him is all. Very good with us."
"He's going to be the best quidditch player in the world, just you watch, angel," Crowley grinned proudly.
Harry stared at him for a while, then down at his hands before looking up at Severus who translated quickly what he said, a look of amusement twitching at his lips. Harry pointed to Draco’s hands and frowned
After dinner the boys were led upstairs, Draco practically dragging Harry by the hand until they reached a long hallway of doors where they all stopped. Draco pointed towards one door with a little snake engraved on its face and carefully spelling out, “
"That's so cool, but man I'm glad my mum doesn't teach at Hogwarts, I'd never hear the end of it!"
but he’d taken to wandering the small living room and glaring at various photographs on the floo and the walls.
"Mag-ick rules," Harry grinned.
Sirius never left Harry's side and became extremely protective of the boy. Much to Crowley's delight. He'd agreed that his size was a comfortable one, easier to get around with, and allowed Harry to keep him as such. He became a bit of a support animal for the boy, curling up on his chest when the nightmares grew bad and resting heavy on his shoulders when his emotions or anxiety weighed too much on the young boy.
In the end, Harry only managed to find one cart that wasn't already filled to the brim with excited students, this one held one boy and what looked like a pet rat on his lap. The boy looked a bit scruffy, with messy red hair and some dirt on his nose. Freckles looked like they'd exploded all over his face and his smile was a bit crooked when he turned towards Harry.
Ron paused, his head ticking to the side and his face scrunching  up in confusion for a moment. "Harry?" A few moments later, his eyes widened and his mouth dropped open. "Bloody hell! You're Harry Potter, aren't you? I recognize the scar now! Wow, it's nice to meet you, you're a legend man!"
"Have you met him?" Harry wondered. The boy had been a bit standoffish to him, sure, but he hadn't been mean. Harry wondered what had happened between the Malfoy's and the Weasley's to make Ron hate the boy on sight.
I do hope you're doing well,
,” Severus translated, tapping Harry’s shoulder for a moment before repeating the strange sowilo gesture in question. Harry signed back and the man nodded before turning back to the others. “This is his sign name
Draco Lucius Malfoy liked to consider himself the perfect example of what a pureblooded heir should look and act like. He was poised, polite, and pretty, just like his mother. But he was also incredibly quick and well learned like his father. Even Uncle Severus often told him he was particularly exceptional in potions crafting for a boy his age. No doubt he’d be top of his classes once he got to Hogwarts.
And it was true, Severus had no idea how to be a father. And Petunia was going to be furious. (As well as, no doubt, Albus, considering he placed the boy there for a reason.)
"Quiet, they'll hear you."
"Did you tell Harry about these moving stairs?"
," he said, pointing towards Vernon
“He’s asked Severus to come grocery shopping with him,” the blonde continued, eyebrows scrunched together in confusion and anger. “It appears his relatives have gone on a trip for a fortnight and have left him nothing to eat.”
Harry let out another whoop before launching towards his parents, pulling them both into a hug. "This is going to be awesome! When can we go shopping? Do I get my wand first? Are we going to ride the train? What about Sirius, can I bring him too?"
Narcissa chuckled, placing a hand on Draco’s shoulder to keep him from literally bouncing in his spot. “I heard, darling. I think it suits you well. It’s a pleasure to have you in our home Harry,” she greeted the boy, waiting until Severus finished translating to bow her head and show her hands. “I am Narcissa Malfoy, mistress of this home and mother of Draco. I hope you will feel at home here with us.”
it. Which meant he wasn’t going to take it back. (Not that Harry would argue if he did. He was grateful for even being allowed to keep it for a little bit, so if Draco wanted it back, Harry would easily hand it back over.) And the other boy was eager to learn signing, demanding Harry teach him all kinds of words throughout dinner and dutifully ignoring his father anytime he was scolded for speaking too much at the table. Or Harry assumed that’s what Mr. Malfoy was saying, because his dad wasn’t able to translate everything and Harry could only sometimes catch words from lip reading. He did catch Draco saying “but father I have to
The boy- Harry Potter- wasn’t exactly what Draco had been expecting. Everyone had seen the pictures of him, but of course they were years and years old, from before the attack. Still, he looked a lot more like Uncle Severus than Draco imagined he would. Except for his eyes, those of course were a vibrant, beautiful green. Not really like a forest green, but more like a slytherin green. Like the colour of his silk sheets or his father’s old tie. And then there was the scar. In all the picture books about ‘The-Boy-Who-Lived’ his scar was tiny on his forehead, like a little sowilo rune, but the actual scar was like real lightning, arcing across the boy’s face in reaching branches.
“Sealed?” Lucius frowned, leaning forward slightly in his seat. “They were never read? How is that possible?”
"I have a car already. My friends are waiting," he started to walk away before pausing, glancing back at Harry with a conflicted look on his expression. "Be careful, Potter. Pay  more attention, okay?" He didn't wait for an answer before continuing down the small hall to the next car.
And then Sirius had summoned him.
"Yes," Aziraphale nodded, placing his hands primly on his lap in an heir of calm that Crowley knew was just a front. "And it's come to our attention that a mistake has been made. Mr. Potter deserves to be raised in a home with someone who understands him. Loves him. He will not find that here with you."
"You will. I know you will," Sirius smiled, patting the demon's hand gently. "I will not say it, for I know you hate to hear it, but I know you will take care of the boy. Teach him to be better, better than us, better than you. Promise me this, Anthony."
The playful tone turned sharp almost instantly and Aziraphale turned to follow the demon's gaze, only to find Harry had climbed up on top of one of Aziraphale's living area bookshelves. He giggled down at them, his broom proudly in hand as Crowley leapt to his feet, heart in his throat.
Lucius’ voice cut through the silence of the street, but Severus was grateful for his soft tone and the gentle hand his friend placed on his shoulder. The potions master hadn’t noticed that they’d been standing at the door for a few moments without moving, and he might have been surprised that Lucius didn’t grow impatient if he didn’t know the man so well.
“Yes,” Narcissa hummed, glancing towards Harry with a curious look. “Well need to hide that while we’re out tomorrow, I’m sure. Probably best that no one see him out and about with us so close to Dumbledore’s nose. The goblins are trustworthy enough, but the random wizard on the street of the Alley is not. If anyone asks I’ll tell them he’s a cousin’s son and we are caring for him until further notice.”
Harry shrugged. "You can pet him if you want. But it's always good to ask."
The brunette couldn't help but glance back towards Malfoy, their eyes meeting for just a moment in curiosity. Harry gave him a friendly smile, but Malfoy didn't return it. He glanced towards his friends, then back at Harry before giving the smallest of nods.
She was silent for a moment before deflating. "I simply don't want more trouble finding us because we let you leave with him."
"That you could take care of him," the demon finished, shoulders slumping at the explanation. Damn, caught in his own words. Something in him twisted at his son's explanation, at the thought of him doing it because of Crowley, because he just wanted to help.
"Fairness is an angel's work, mischief. And I am a demon," Crowley responded. But he smirked and waved a hand towards Aziraphale. "Go on then, before our son dies of excitement."
The other boy glared up at him for a while, then at his hand, as if he was trying to decide if it was a joke or not. He must have decided because he carefully grabbed Harry's hand and used it to help himself up. Harry grinned proudly and the boy glanced away, his cheeks dusting pink slightly as he adjusted his robes.
“That’s your sign name,” his godfather explained with a smile, waving towards Harry who repeated it. “It means silver dragon.”
There was a long silence then, the Dursley's sharing a confused yet hopeful look that set Crowley's teeth on edge. He was glad he let Aziraphale take the lead here, or he'd have just snuck in and stolen the child away. Maybe left some nasty treats for the Dursley's to find the next morning.
"Mum sad," Harry asked, flipping over so he could reach a hand out to the demon. "No more broom?"
He did not wait for a reply before turning to usher Crowley and the child out the door, ignoring any shouting and sputtering Vernon followed him with. If Crowley shut the door on the man's face, sending him reeling back, then Aziraphale didn't bat an eye.
Mr. A. Z. Fell
Harry had noticed them by now, eyes wide as he tried to hide behind his father’s leg, peeking out at Draco like he was afraid he’d hurt him.
Crowley could feel the angel's pout from across the table. "Yes but from what I've read, most children are able to say very basic sounds and words before they're a year old. Harry is nearly two already."
Harry would also like me to express his gratitude towards his gifts you sent. He is absolutely enamored with the practice broom you sent, and I know I speak for both myself and Crowley when I say we appreciate the height limit it's been charmed with. I do hope it doesn't effect the charm at all that he's somehow managed to carve his initials into the side of it. How he managed to do so, I have no idea, but he was quite so proud of his work that I didn't have the heart to fix it.
HOGWARTS SCHOOL
"Well you did promise, didn't you? Besides, I think it'd be lovely to have a little one running around again. I did so love Warlock, and this time we won't have any other objectives in mind when raising him." Aziraphale sat up straight, tugging proudly at his vest before smiling. "And I think we would do a much better job this time around. Especially when we won't have to hide anything from the boy, though..." He hummed, finger tapping on his chin in thought. "We probably should find somewhere else to live. A bookshop isn't quite the place to raise a child I don't think. Nonetheless, that can be done rather quickly I think. I'll set it up for tomorrow. Perhaps Tadfield? It will give us the chance to visit with Adam as well. I'm sure he'd love that. Then we can fetch the boy, yes?"
"Yes, well I suppose that's as good as any," Crowley chuckled, letting Harry smack at his lips as he had Aziraphale. He looked up at the feel of eyes on him and held back a flinch at the soft look the angel gave him. He was still trying to get used to those, get used to knowing he was allowed those kinds of soft, loving looks. "What issss it angel?"
"I've met his father once, when I was little. He was a follower of- of you know who," Ron said, dropping into a whisper and pointing towards the scar on Harry's head. He didn't know the stories like Ron did, but he knew enough to connect the dots and he frowned. "They're dark wizards, they are. Slytherin too, everyone of them."
After a many more thanks from Harry to the Malfoy’s, he was left alone in his room with his own father, wearing a pair of Draco’s pajamas that had to be rolled up at the bottom so he didn’t trip. He was sat on his bed, Mr. Prince- his
I do hope you are doing well my dear. I wanted to thank you ever so much for lending me the books I asked for. I never was able to convince Albus to let me into your restricted section of the library, then again, I wasn't strictly a teacher either, was I? The books you provided on raising magical children also helped exponentially and I could not thank you enough for them. As you are aware, Crowley and I's 'magic' is very different than your own, so trying to teach him how to control his own powers has proven... rather interesting. It is very different than young Adam, you see.
Frowning at the memory, Harry tugged at his ears. “
Minerva
” he sniffled, eyebrows scrunched together like he was worried that’d be a deal breaker.
"They don't," Crowley sighed, leading Aziraphale towards the couch where he carefully sat the angel down. "It was an old friend of mine, in desperate need of our help."
“Unfortunately I… was not in a good place when Harry was born,” Severus hedged carefully, resisting the urge to scratch at his arm where his sleeve hid his faded mark. “I did not turn to Dumbledore’s side until after Lily was killed and I certainly was not in the right mindset to take care of a child. It’s possible Dumbledore knew and decided I was unsuitable at the time, or it’s possible he was unaware completely. Right now we’re simply unsure.”
” The boy asked, glancing curiously at Lucius before turning back to Severus with almost pleading eyes. “
"Hm?" Gold eyes slid over to the angel on the other side of the table from him and he raised an eyebrow. "I'm perfect, Angel. Why?"
It was an attempt at privacy that the dark haired man appreciated when he knelt down before his son and tried to give him his gentlest smile.
“He’s with his aunt,” Severus croaked, fists clenching in his lap. “He’s with that wretched woman and her horrid husband.”
"I'm Mr. Fell and this is my partner Mr. Crowley. Please sit, Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, we have much to discuss," Aziraphale said, a forced politeness to his tone.
But Harry was perfect and he would do anything for the boy.
Harry had never had a friend before. Dudley hated him and his friends always chased him around for Harry Hunting, and since he couldn’t hear no one at school wanted to talk to him. The closest he’d gotten to a friend was Miss Harendale at the library. She always gave him snacks when he hid there after school and she was the one to tell him about the sign language classes twice a month. She’d even signed the permission slip for him to join because she somehow knew Aunt Petunia wouldn’t.
“Merlin, you really are gay.” Harry chuckled.
This got her attention. “Yea, Alex. What about it?”
There are five love languages and everyone experiences them in their own way.
Harry gave an impish grin and said, “I like everyone, Draco. No need to limit myself to one gender.”
“I didn’t even say a spell, I just screamed. I heard it in the air before I even realized it was coming from me. My wand ..... I don’t even know where my wand was. I just screamed and reached out towards him, and a spell came out. It was only locomotor mortis, which bonded his legs and kept him from running away. Unfortunately, he had a counter-curse to undo the jinx and escape.”
Draco didn't even have to ask why they wouldn't like him; they considered him a blood traitor. During his trail, it was revealed that Draco was very unwilling to do many of the things Voldemort wanted him to. It was also revealed that he intentionally screwed up when he didn't want to go through with the plans. Death Eaters labeled him a saboteur and a blood traitor, which he was fine with. He considered that the reason why his mark faded while no one else's did.
Harry shrugged, “Maybe you sleepwalked.” He suggested before finally coming clean, “I carried you to bed.”
Draco was staggered. His cheeks went pink and his lips parted in shock. He found himself motionless and mute a moment before he found his voice again. “You. You think I’m beautiful?” Somehow the idea of Harry finding him to be beautiful was surprising, even after the letter.
By morning, they couldn't find the resolve to regret their openness, and instead, silently embraced that they were a bit closer than before. That night, they had a very similar conversation, but no wine was necessary.
Just after lunch, Hermione surprised Ron with the down payment for their house. Ron didn’t even question how she got the money, he just celebrated with her and they even shed a few tears. They deserved to build a home together and everyone was ecstatic for them.
It gave him a way inside his mother’s head. Her thoughts, her feelings, how she dealt with problems, what she liked and disliked, it was almost overwhelming. But it also hurt. She wrote about James, Sirius, Remus, and Peter. Before they were either dead or traitors. She wrote about their pranks and how they occasionally bothered Snape. She also wrote about all the terrible things Snape had done. That, combined with Harry’s own experience, made him realize Snape was a racist with an unhealthy obsession for his mum.
Harry was a bit surprised Draco knew that about him, but agreed. “Well, do you have anywhere to go?”
Harry nodded, “Yes. Please, Draco.”
The blonde let out a soft laugh. “Oh, don’t tell me you’re so sensitive you can’t handle having your ear whispered in.” He wasn’t even trying to be sensual anymore. He only thought it hilarious.
Draco was honestly a bit surprised at the invitation. He didn’t realize their nights together mattered so much to Harry. “How about I bring a chair in here and sleep there?”
Harry honestly didn’t know much about story endings. Only one other kind of ending came to mind and he wasn’t sure if it was quite good enough. Still, he gave it a shot. “What about an epilogue?”
“Bastard.” Harry said as he started to drink the bowl of soup. He was very aware that Draco was taller than him, but he didn't realize he was so much taller.
“Harry, cumming!” The blonde warned his lover as quickly as he could but found himself releasing only seconds later. His body curled around Harry’s head and he shook as he finally came. “Fuck. Fuck. Oh fuck, Harry.” He panted out the words as he finished.
They said nothing more on the subject.
They stayed together for the rest of the afternoon.
Draco was somewhat amused by how Harry took the information, but made no comment, returning to his book.
Since most of the richest wizard families had been pureblood and supporters of Voldemort, his defeat shook the finances of the rich and well-off.
Harry had no idea that Draco really thought all this about his eyes.
The door opened to reveal a woman with brown hair, spotted with greys. Brown and wise eyes.
Harry tried again.
He blushed and crossed his arms. “Shut up.”
Harry had also begun looking at houses. Hermione’s landlady was half-blood but grew up in Muggle society before going to Hogwarts. Now her clients were both Muggle and wizard. She had a website with the properties she owned on it, and a special secondary website for wizard clientele. Really it was for half-blood or muggle-born clients as they would be the only ones to know what the internet is.
Teddy had been sorted into Hufflepuff all those years ago. The map had been activated and in Harry’s pocket that day, Remus was there for the ceremony and he was so proud to say his son was a Hufflepuff, just like his wife. He couldn’t have been happier.
Draco huffed. “You’re so dense, Potter. It’s sexy because you’re making yourself so accessible. Your pants are so lose, it would be so easy to slip inside. You’ve no idea how tempting you are. It drives me crazy!”
- - - - -
James nodded.
They pulled away and grinned like the idiots they were.
But even still, the stress was evident amongst them all.
James didn’t like that at all and Harry knew it. That’s why he said it. But little did Harry know, James had one last trick up his sleeve.
They cried together, talked, and there was no judgement or hate, only openness and forgiveness. They all wanted to heal and they did it together.
Hermione looked a bit sad and said, “It’s the anniversary of his parent’s death.”
“Bollocks! All those evils trying to rob us of our freedom! Just like a cheesy young adult novel. Aren’t I right, Potter?” He seemed to be implying that Harry, as a young person, should understand and agree. In some strange way, Harry was amused by how desperate everyone was. He knew he was still a prominent figure due to the war and his takeover of Wizengamot, but he didn't think he was really that important. The longer he turned the idea over in his mind, the more he understood. He didn't know any of these people. In wizard society, they were nameless and faceless. But Harry, everyone knew him. They were desperate to impress to gain any ounce of friendship, support, and notoriety. It was kind of sad. Part of him didn't understand what they saw in him, but when he looked at things from their perspective, he understood that no matter what he did, they would always idolize him because of his part in the war. Voldemort had the government and the media. If not for Harry, he would have won.
Once the feast was over, the seventh year students had their graduation ceremony. It was more painful than any of them had expected. All the plans they made with lost friends, everyone who should have been there with them, everyone who should have been worried about studies rather than survival. They were isolated together and it made them realize how small their class had become. Less than half remained. Not all were deaths and some had simply transferred to finish their studies elsewhere. But most were dead.
Harry looked at Draco in surprise from where he stood in the Floo. He gave a sheepish grin and felt a bit bad about scaring the other. "Apologies." He said as he shrugged off his Wizengamot robes. He hated wearing them. He thought the plum color looked absolutely ridiculous, not to mention the fabric didn't feel too great. "How was your talk with Seamus?"
Crowley didn't actually look upset when he peeked over the couch at Aziraphale, more exhilarated, like it was only a game they were playing. Which was probably true.
so Severus didn’t bother even knocking, instead pressing the button beneath the sign. Instead of the
It was fat and long, with a beautiful black leather on its cover and the Hogwarts emblem blazed across the front. Previously it’d been in the library, and technically he’d never asked his parents if he could give it to Harry, but at the same time, considering the situation, he truly hoped they wouldn’t mind. Judging by the soft looks on their faces, they didn’t.
"Well my dear, it would seem that you are glowing."
Aziraphale watched with amusement from the kitchen doorway, warmth flooding his heart at the sight.
The Dursleys sputtered in the silence, Petunia looking absolutely petrified, and Vernon fuming with anger. "How. Dare. You," he bellowed, fingers clutching tight at the edges of the couch. "First you freaks come to
And that was true.
It took an embarrassing amount of time for Narcissa to connect the dots. She’d been hearing the famed name of the Boy-Who-Lived for so long that it was hard to imagine the boy
And finally, as you'll find out in this chapter, Harry is going to be considered disabled in this story, due to the injury he sustained when Voldemort attacked him. I'll go further into it later in the story as it comes up, but just a warning there.
“Not quite,” Lucius answered with a frown. “He would technically hold the accounts by proxy, but would not be able to access anything other than the trust vault. However, if a true guardian came in such as a birth parent or a named godparent, then Dumbledore wouldn’t have access to
"I don't know, maybe he's nice," Harry shrugged, turning back to his friends as a tall woman stepped up to the top of the stairs. Harry followed the dark green robes and the pointed hat before a bright smile covered his face. "Professor McGonagal!"
Fascinated, Draco watched and repeated the gesture so he wouldn’t forget, then he turned to Harry, his eyes wide. “What’s my sign name?”
Something sad and angry passed over the potion master’s face before it carefully went blank and he nodded. “
Crowley snorted, snatching the letter from his partner's hand so he can look at the shopping list. "That would be your first question. You can, but I don't think they let first years on the team. Sorry kid."
Something soft flittered around in the demon's chest and he smirked, nodding. "Yeah angel, I heard."
Mr. Fell,
"At the time I was teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts, angel. The kids had to know how to expect the unexpected, so they say." His grin told the angel otherwise however, but he didn't bring it up. "Besides, it's a fun surprise for the first years, and as they get older they'll get used to the patterns. Most of the Ravenclaws figure it out within their first week. Stop fretting so much."
"Well it hardly seems to be doing you any good," Aziraphale scoffed before stepping past the woman and into the home. Crowley just smirked at her incredulous look before following the angel in. "Honestly, to think you've been given such a gift and still so much hatred settles in your heart. Many would die to have what you've been given."
Now, granted most of the students around him were staring or mumbling about him. It made him a bit self conscious at all of the attention. But Ron and Hermione stood tall next to him, assuring him that it'd pass once they got their fill of the boy who lived.
Pansy jumped at the chance to make her friend feel better as she knew exactly what he was thinking about. “Better late than never, you can start now.”
Harry’s jaw dropped and his face was red. He looked up at Draco who was smirking away and biting his lip.
His mother came rushing over to him and wrapped her arms around him. “Oh, my precious boy!” She said as she held him close. “I've been worried sick!”
Harry gathered his stuff and went back to his dorm, and he sat down on his bed with a grin, deciding he was done reading for the rest of the day, he’d spent many of his brain cells forming his brilliant idea.
“Well orgasms c-“
Harry’s widened as he took in the sight of blue eyes kneeling beside him. He leaned towards them and his hands gripped Draco’s robes.
Harry laid down and looked up at Draco, a bit nervous.
Anguis M. P. had to be the worst pseudonym Harry had ever heard. Given that “Draco” was Latin for dragon, he thought it would be funny to make his pseudonym Latin for snake. He then proceeded to switch the order of his surname, Potter-Malfoy, and abbreviate. All their friends found the pseudonym to be incredibly amusing and wondered when someone would figure it out. If anyone ever would, they didn't know, but fifteen years into his writing career and no one else knew.
Alex’s jaw dropped. “Why?!” Part of them hated the idea and wanted Harry to stay to keep stirring things up, but they were also a bit interested in the potential story they could get from this.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “I’m impressed. I didn’t think he cared enough to form an entire strategy.”
Draco falls to his knees, worships the flesh, and is blessed by Harry.
They had never been so broken and free, until the sun set and their conversations began.
He found himself smiling as he read all about his mother, father, godfather, and good friend. Peter was there too, bastard.
Harry gave an disappointed expression. "I should hope not. I told them that if given the chance, I wouldn't divorce Draco. Though I would be very willing to change our contract. I don't like it."
Draco cracked a smile and let out a chuckle. He’s come to notice that Harry has a very easy time making him laugh. That, along with the fact that Harry works and does the cooking and cleaning, has allowed Draco to adjust pretty comfortably. Then again, he’s started doing small things. He’ll wipe up the counters and clean up any dirt he sees. He doesn’t want to feel like a freeloader.
Draco nodded in agreement. But the moment Harry pulled his hand away, Draco blurted out, “Harry’s still a virgin.”
The blonde was merciful enough to pull Harry’s boxers down so he could slip out, enjoying the way the other let out a soft whimper from the cool air. His eyes widened at the new flesh. It held only a few visible veins and the tip was the same soft pinkish-brown of his nipples, as opposed to Draco’s angry red. It was strangely pretty. “Honestly, Potter, must you be gorgeous everywhere?”
There came a pause as Harry realized he was the driving force of The Cupboard Project, Pawk's bill, and Crow and Pansy's St. Mungo's reform. Harry had all the cards and he was forcing everyone to play his game. By tossing around favors, he got the Searcy siblings’ support, Crow and Pansy’s influence, and Greenwood’s unwavering subordination. Through charm he got Alexis Wright’s vote. With subtle manipulation he got Crow on their side, not to mention how he built up and knocked down Luther’s career and political party at will, for the premeditated purpose of eating up the opposition, one by one. He had everything at his disposal. He made the game, he gave everyone their cards, and still, he told them what moves to make. He orchestrated a dance that everyone followed flawlessly. At no point was he not in control. For reasons that he wasn’t proud of, he actually enjoyed his work. It was strangely fun. But he could never confess that.
“Well now you’re just sucking the fun out of it.”
Harry was writing letters back and forth with his friends. A lot had happened in the last week. Hermione was offered an internship under Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt, Professor Sprout offered Neville a position as her assistant in the Herbology Department, his girlfriend Hannah got herself an interview for a minor position in the Ministry, Ron was accepted into the training program to be an Auror, Pansy was offered a position to train for her dream job in the Improper Uses Of Magic Office, and Dean and Seamus’ applications for the Department Of Magical Sports and Games were approved.
“At the very least it’ll confuse the shit out of some first years.”
“I’m richer than you, by millions.”
They laid in silence for a while, just holding each other in Harry’s bed. It felt so relaxing with just a hint of excitement. They enjoyed each other for another half hour before Harry had to pee. Draco let him up and they agreed to meet in the sitting room to finally have their Christmas morning. Draco made even more hot chocolate and entered to see Harry was starting a fire. He sat by the tree with his own cup while setting Harry’s on the floor before him. “Come on, time to open presents.” He tried to hurry Harry along, who only let out a soft and breathy laugh.
"Though the circumstances are troubling, I'm glad that of all people, Draco ended up with you." She reached down to stroke her son's hair. "You're good for him."
Harry didn’t like surprise, especially involving his work, therefore, he didn’t want to surprise anyone in their job. He fired off a quick letter to Pawk, telling her about what he had done with Greenwood so she would be prepared in case Harry did end up threatening or intimidating anyone into voting for her bill. Though he doubted he would need to, he wanted her to know that it was a possibility so she could plan accordingly. Surprises in politics were never a good thing, even when one has the best of intentions.
It was Dean.
“You should see Harry. He’s the most coy little bastard I’ve met in my life. Watch this.” Draco said before turning to Harry. “I love you.”
It’s the anniversary of the death of Harry’s parents, the day the Marauders’ lives fell apart, and the day that Harry’s life was stolen from him.
“You never had to kill. Even when you wanted to, you never took a life until that day. You’re upset that you killed someone.”
“Funny, I was never allowed to.” Harry silently finished pulling out the supplies. “I bought a kit to make one yourself because I don’t have the patience to bake the gingerbread.”
"Uhm, you needed to see me?" He addressed the goblin.
Of course, he couldn't sleep with any Slytherin boys as they would likely tell his father. He couldn't mess with Gryffindor boys either as he didn't trust them. He mostly spent his time around Hufflepuff boys. He made a few friends, found the ones also interested in men, and made careful offers of spending the night together with no strings attached. But these hot nights only lasted so long, because the very next year, in a sad attempt to please his father, he took the Dark Mark.
She raised an eyebrow, but decided not to comment on it. Then she changed her mind and did comment on it, "One day you two might be living together. How are you suppose to live with him while he dresses up nice every day?
Draco wasn't sure what to expect when he stepped into the Romanian dragon sanctuary. He correctly assumed that the director would be happy to see him and that Harry would be late. He was set up in an unused office that he would use as an interrogation room of sorts.
"Good. Then do it."
Hermione grinned at this. She decided to accompany him for as long as he wanted to stay at the library. She had nothing better to do until dinner, and it was only a little past lunch.
he loved Draco. He was absolutely and unquestionably in love. "I'm in love with him." The words came out as a mumble, speaking most to himself. He wanted to cry. Now he knew, he was definitely in love with Draco but that might mean nothing because there was no guarantee that Draco would survive, much less that he would ever wake up.
“I already know what flower I’m going to get you next. I have a couple things up my sleeve, Draco.”
Draco wasn’t sure what to make of what he just heard. Harry was offering to cook him two meals a day and do his laundry. He blinked a few times as this wasn’t at all what he expected. “Thanks, Potter.” His own voice sounded surprised and almost confused.
“Ed Sheeran is so famous that it doesn’t matter where he held a concert, thousands would show up. He’s phenomenal.”
Harry's hand shifted to get a better grip on Draco's shoulder as his elbow came to rest on the blonde's chest. They had somehow become pressed against each other and the hand that once rested on his waist had become an arm that wrapped around him and kept him close. This was no longer a dance, they were embracing.
“I don’t want you giving me more boners.”
He dropped the parchment and sprinted to the Floo, throwing down powder and practically shouting "St. Mungo's."
After lunch, Harry had a crisis. He remembered that the very next day he had his Herbology and Potions exams, so he should study, but he also wanted to work at what he would do for Draco’s birthday. After about half an hour of questioning himself, he came to the conclusion that he should write down all the things he wants to do for Draco’s birthday, and then not worry about working out the details until the fourth when Draco would be taking exams and Harry would be free all day.
Harry clutched the necklace tighter and pressed his forehead to Draco’s chest. “Yes. Just stay with me for a while.”
Draco pulled out his wand and moved to sit beside Harry. He looked at Harry once more, silently asking for confirmation.
Draco nodded and couldn't help but to ask, "So you're just going to forget about all the times I was an arse to you in school."
“I don’t like shouting, and he shouted. It was a spell I had never heard of before, but through the crowd, I saw the skull mask. I saw it and I knew that it was him. I knew what he was going to do so I ran to Draco and I tried to yell for him to duck, I tried to tackle him, I just had to get him out of the way of the spell.” He bit his lip and another shiver ran through him. “I was too late.” His voice wavered and his emotions finally broke through. He was trying so hard not to start crying again. “He was hit and fell down. I think he was out before he ever touched the ground.”
They all crowded into the little sitting room while Arthur slowly read out the entire list. “Bellatrix Lestrange, née Black, currently deceased, on the charges of multiple counts of murder, torture, the use of unforgivable curses, and being a Death Eater. Verdict, guilty. Punishment has been forgone due to the accused being deceased. Titles and properties to be dissolved by Gringotts Bank.” Somehow, that got the entire room to feel at ease for the first time in forever. Molly even let a small smile slip.
Harry’s heart melted a bit, “I love you too.”
Of course, there were plenty of lame tropes and stereotypes that made him roll his eyes, but it was an otherwise excellent book. Then again, he’s read it five times now. He’s read most of his books multiple times. Although they were good, he was nervous about eventually getting tired of them.
Draco noticed what Dean was doing, and he thought it was absolutely hilarious. But he didn’t comment on it. He let Dean continue to display that Seamus wasn’t available.
Part of Pansy couldn’t believe that Draco actually fell for it. Love might be blind, but today, she learned that love is also a dumbass.
Harry let a grin slip onto his face before he took a deep breath and gave his instructions. The way emotions flickered on and off of his face so quickly was yet another little tactic of his. It was unnerving in ways people could never quite pinpoint or explain. "I was only wondering if there was something in Luther's past that might be a bit, controversial. Something my friend in the press could use to knock him down."
“Well I’d like to start by resolving the sexual tension between us, then I’m like to be your boyfriend.”
Draco really was on to something when he suspected Harry might be a bit of a bottom.
Harry hurried back to Hogwarts and snuck into the kitchen. He put together a plate of food to wake Draco up to before sneaking back out and heading to his room.
Harry does a bit of research on the world around him and gets a phenomenal idea with Hermione.
That alone exhausted Draco. His trial had just finished and now he was stuck at home with a father who probably hates him. Still, he pressed on until mid-June, when he learned the true nature of his oath as a Death Eater. When he asked his father about it, he was told that he didn't need to know because everything he owned was tied to Lucius anyways. He'd lost everything when Lucius took the mark. His father also couldn't stand that Harry ended up keeping some wine. It was meant to be an insult and they all knew it. But Draco also knew Lucius' anger wasn’t really about the wine. It was about everything Harry had ever done. The wine was just an excuse for the way Harry destroyed Voldemort's attempts at a racist utopia.
“Take the plate before I kill you.”
Maybe it was the way Harry didn’t talk as they got dressed, that his eyes were a bit duller, or the way he looked at the ground as he walked, but something was wrong.
“Neither did I.”
“This is my favorite vacation home.” He implied multiple others as Harry closed the door behind them.
Draco nodded. "I just feel like that would make the most sense. But I'd like to do other things before I finally take it, you know? I'd like to slowly show him more and more ways to find pleasure instead of starting with the most obvious."
Harry nodded, “Yes. Because beyond my own opinion and experience, I have evidence that Draco Malfoy was never truly a Death Eater.” He challenged.
Lucius raised an eyebrow, but didn’t question it, “Deal.”
“There are a few spells that can speed up the healing process but they take a lot of energy to perform. All I can really do is make you comfortable.”
“I swear I’m going to stab you.”
Now the three of them stood in Gringotts bank, five minutes early and with the Malfoys nowhere in sight.
Draco went to go get some supplies while Harry turned to his friends. “You guys can go, don’t want to be late for class. I’ll be fine. I get thirty Galleons out of it. I’d say it’s worth it.”
Harry couldn’t stop himself from grinning. “I didn’t think you felt the same way so I guess I wanted a distraction. Are you jealous?”
They were each riding a high on life. But as it does, life has a way of keeping people grounded. Draco’s grounding came in the form of his father.
One, people sexualize him a lot more often than he previously thought.
He turned red and and looked somewhat surprised. “I don’t mean to lose my virginity while tied up.”
If he asked, Harry would probably pounce then and there. He didn’t understand how Draco managed to turn his old arrogance into a flirting tactic, and he was even more confused as to why it worked so well on him, but if Draco kept it up Harry might not be able to keep it down.
He was abashed by his own behavior. How easy it was for his hips to move, how easy it was to crave more, how easy it was to make noise and let his own hand take him away. He’d never been so free before.
When the boy glanced back up, he recoiled at the fury on his father’s face, only soothed a few minutes later when it became apparent that the man wasn’t mad at
Taking a deep breath, Draco stepped forward and held out a book.
Crowley sighed heavily, slumping onto the ground with his back against the back of the couch. He ran a hand over his face, trying to calm his frantic heart.
Harry and his friends were gathered with the rest of the students at the top of a set of stairs after arriving at Hogwarts and getting off the boats. He could see the white haired boy towards the edge of the crowd, ready to walk over and ask his name, but the boy was already joined by his own friends: short, a black haired girl who clung to the boy's arm, and another dark skinned boy that stood nearly a foot taller than him at his side.
“Of course, mother,” the boy responded, tilting his chin up in pride. “Blaise and Theo say I’m the best of friends.” It wasn’t completely true of course, people of their status knew better than to be so open with affections, but both boys were always eager to come visit and they never complained, so Draco assumed he
“Severus?” Lucius asked quietly, glancing up and dropping his hand to the letters. “My friend-“
He was quickly ushered to the table with the rest of his friends and introduced to Ron's older brothers, the boy from the train with a toad, and a boy with a thick, lilting Irish accent that talked faster than Harry could keep up. Even after the room had settled down enough to get through the rest of the ceremony, Harry couldn't hide his bright grin.
Lucius gave a rare smile and nodded. “There will be much to do, but your test is the only one needed immediately in order to fetch the boy. We can leave everything else for after. I’d rather not leave him any longer than absolutely necessary.” Severus was already nodding, pushing himself from his chair and smiling gratefully when Narcissa helped him up. “I will write to the Ministry to open a case while you freshen up,” Lucius said as he stood as well, straightening his sleeves and grabbing his cane. “I’ll make sure they are aware to keep it completely confidential until we know the full details.”
"Angel-"
Crowley stalked forward, shoving the woman out of the way and pulling a sleeping Harry gently into his arms. He looked just like his father, though far more squishy, and with Lily's little turned up nose. The scar on his face was just barely healed, reminding Crowley of what exactly happened to the boy's parents.
Severus was fine with that, knowing it was the safest option for the time being. Harry might not understand, and he doesn’t look very recognizable with so many of the potion master’s own features, but that scar was too famous to explain away, even if it did look different than any one remembered.
It had been merely a decade since he'd seen the wizard, though they'd spoken briefly when he got the baby announcement for the potter boy months ago. Still, to see an old friend in such a state brought worry to Crowley's shriveled heart.
"Very well, Mr. Fell. Many great wizards have come out of the house Slytherin, powerful but dangerous sometimes. However, Gryffindor is a most respectable house."
"It's your own fault you know," the angel laughed as Crowley tried to reach under the table for Harry, but he was already gone. "I told you not to introduce him to Quidditch too early. If what you've told me about his father is even remotely true, he's got it in his blood."
Snipits of Harry's life throughout this childhood.
He glared at the blonde when Lucius laughed. “No one is ever truly ready for parenthood, Severus,” he said wisely, patting the dark haired man’s shoulder before letting it drop to his side, “and yet we forge on because we love them regardless.”
Crowley frowned, turning at the familiar voice and glancing down at the lump of fabric near the edge of the circle. Upon closer inspection, it was definitely a person, though their hair was matted and their face covered in grime and dried tears. The demon frowned, crouching as close to him as the circle allowed.
he spoke as he signed.
. (After that Draco was half tempted to snatch their spare parchment away from the boy, but he didn’t.)
the man signed slowly, taking deep breaths to calm himself down. “
Aziraphale did not wait to be invited before taking a very prim and proper seat on a couch that looked like it was never used except for company, and Crowley took the opportunity to sprawl across it lazily, his legs spread enough to have the woman glancing away with a blush. He only smirked wider. It didn't take long for Vernon Dursley to stomp down the stairs, his face red with exertion and his breathing heavy.
"You look like shit, mate."
"Well, that's why he's sad."
"Who's that boy over there," Harry asked quietly, glancing at Ron in hopes that he'd know the answer.
A sob escaped the boy’s lips as the tears started tracing down his cheeks, his small hands scrubbing desperately to hide the overflow of emotion he was no doubt feeling. But he nodded his head anyway as he threw himself into Severus’ arms, his tiny body shaking with the force of his sobs.
And oh how Narcissa’s heart positively ached at the despair in the man’s voice. Severus didn’t move from her shoulder, and she didn’t dare mention how improper this was for purebloods, but he waved a hand at her husband in permission.
Harry stared at the card, watching in fascination as the picture shifted and moved as if the man on the front of it was real.
"Yes!" Harry whooped, jumping into the air excitedly. "Oh my gosh this is going to be so cool! Wizard school! I'm gonna get a wand, and a cauldron. And I'm gonna mix potions and fly and-" he paused, eyes widening with barely contained excitement. "Can I play quidditch!?"
It wasn’t long before Severus found himself in front of an unfamiliar house in an unfamiliar neighborhood.
and the sign for lightning.”
Harry groaned, dropping his head back in complaint as Crowley adjusted his coat for the twelfth time since they'd gotten to Platform 9 3/4. "Mum, you'll be on the same train!"
After a moment of consideration, Draco straightened his back and looked up at his mother. “Do you think he’d like a gift? I have just the thing to give him!”
He was sorted into Slytherin just as fast as Ron had been sorted, the hat barely even touching his head. There was a proud smirk on his face when the table erupted into cheers and he strutted in that direction, his robes magically colouring green.
Crowley shrugged. "Sirius seems convinced that we would be better than where he is now. And after Warlock, he claims he trusts me to raise another. Though in truth he didn't seem all that sane, really." Crowley shrugged, glancing up at Aziraphale in thinly veiled worry. "I knew of Lily's sister, angel. She was a wickedly jealous woman, and her husband hates magic more than anything in the world. Lily wouldn't let them near the boy, and they didn't want to even visit if she would."
Draco.
"Someone I met when I was frolicking around that school in the Highlands, you remember. I got bored and posed as a teacher for a while." The angel nodded along and Crowley sighed. "There were some students there, a wiley bunch. They were practically wicked, angel. You'd have absolutely loved them. Always in my detention for some prank or another. I kept good friends with them when they graduated."
"What is it, Petunia? I only just gotten Dudley to sleep and-" he stopped in the doorway, eyes landing on the two visitors before narrowing into a glare. "Who are you?"
“Are you ready?”
And now that he mentioned it, Crowley could feel the energy wafting from the house. As a demon he was used to it, but it was still there. Singing his tongue with the taste of envy, anger, disgust.
"Very good. Now, upon entering the great hall, you will continue straight on to the front of the room. You will not stop at any tables and you will not take a seat. First and formost, you must all be sorted into your respective houses. You'll then sit down, there will be a few announcements, and we will have dinner. After that, your Prefects will take you to your dorm rooms to settle in. Please be sure to leave your pets in their carrying cases and leave them to the right to be collected, before entering the hall. Special needs animals are an exception. Understood?"
"I'm Ron!" The boy introduced once Harry had taken a seat, wiping his hands on his pants before holding it out. Harry laughed and shook it, not bothered. "Ron Weasley! You're a first year too?"
“There is no time, Cissy,” her husband replied sharply, narrowing his eyes at her before turning back towards the potions master. “The boy has asked for help. You must decide if you will give it, and if you do, what the ramifications of those actions will be.”
They were happier times.
So naturally, when his mother told him she had a very important job for him, he immediately latched onto her words, taking each one incredibly seriously.
about what he is or who his family is.”
"Well," Crowley shrugged, "he got bored and- Harry!"
Harry’s eyes brightened immediately and he gasped, bouncing on his feet a few times as he nodded frantically.
It has come to our attention that you've taken young Mr. Potter out of his protected home with Mr. and Mrs. Dursley. I hope you understand how much of a surprise this is, though personally I'll tell you that I think it was a wonderful decision for you and your partner. I admit that leaving the young boy with that awful family did not sit well with me, however at the time there was no safer choice for us. I am unsure of how much you know about the Potter's situation, and even more unsure of how you came about the knowledge of Harry, but it is quite a dangerous one. I have the utmost confidence that you and your partner will be the safest place for him right now, and I'll be sure to let Albus know as well, though I could not imagine he would argue with me.
“I have something for you,” Draco said quickly, pulling the gift from his pocket and resizing it. “Is it- is it alright if I give him a gift, Uncle Severus?”
Harry took a deep breath, closed his eyes and turned to take a seat.
"Yes mum."
?” Severus signed, though he spoke aloud for Lucius’ sake since he knew his friend wouldn’t understand him otherwise.

Minnie,
Severus Snape was always considered a well collected man.
"Mum?"
"My friend, I cannot promise I will be any better than who he  is with," Crowley tried to argue once more.
him there with her. After everything that’s happened, he just- he left their-
Harry hummed, nodding as if he understood. Which he probably did, Crowley mused, he was a smart boy.
Crowley shrugged innocently. "Listen, angel, a demon gets bored and mischief just happens. Hypothetically speaking of course. I couldn't possibly tell you what demon might have miracled the stairs to move, or what demon made it so they could not be charmed otherwise. Besides, hypothetically, if I did know which demon did it, then I would also know that they're safe enough and kids won't fall off of them. They just might get lost and be late to class. That's all."
They didn't have to wait long before the door was all but yanked open. A much too thin woman stood in the doorway, her hair perfectly coiled and her floral dress perfectly pressed. She looked prepared to glare at them before her expression softened into a very practiced politeness. "Yes, hello. What can I do for you?" Her eyes settled on Aziraphale for a moment before she frowned. "I'm afraid we already have a church if that's what you want."
Harry frowned, glancing up at his mum and shaking his head. "No, you'd be sad."
Severus nodded and took a deep, deep breath. She could feel him tensing, shifting, breathing… collecting himself enough to pull away from her. He didn’t go far, and he didn’t complain when he’d finally straightened up slightly and Narcissa had taken his hands in hers. He looked exhausted, a little bit broken, and completely and utterly lost. “Petunia hated magic. She was always jealous of Lily for being born a witch. Lily didn’t speak more than a handful of words to her sister after receiving her Hogwarts letter. I cannot- Albus
"Can I sit with you?"
A sad expression settled on his face and Crowley smirked, sharing a look with the angel. "Should we tell him?" Aziraphale asked.
Severus sighed, rubbing a hand over his face and shaking his head. He couldn’t help but glance at the two boys on the other side of the room, his heart lurching at the way Harry was practically drinking in Draco’s attention, the way he was soaking up any information the boy could give him from the yearbook. Honestly it’d been a wonderful idea and he’d have to thank Draco more thoroughly some other time, perhaps with a gift of his own to show his appreciation at the boy’s thoughtfulness. Still, it saddened him a bit to see the boy so enthralled with photos of his own mother.
"I raised Warlock not to be the prince of hell, Sirius. It's hardly the same situation," still, Crowley sighed and nodded. "But I owe you a favor, and I owed James and Lilly one as well. If I do this for you, we consider all debts paid." Sirius was already nodding, tears leaking down his cheeks, but Crowley continued before his friend could thank him. "But I can't promise I'll do better. I will try," he quickly said, "Aziraphale, my angel, he's with me now. We- we'll try. But that is the most I can promise you, Sirius."
You will never guess what Harry's done! He's stolen a snake! A whole snake, Minerva! We were at the zoo earlier this week for his birthday, as you know he's been a little bugger about it all month, and he was so excited to visit the reptile exhibit. I should have known better, really. It's my own fault. That boy's heart is much too big for his chest, no doubt thanks to Aziraphale and his goody goody morals. Anywhoo, that's beside the point. Harry managed to find a snake, shrink it down, and steal it away in his backpack! I didn't even know he could shrink things!
"Then we let him out!" Harry said excitedly, as if he saw nothing wrong with the issue.
They were at the zoo when it happened. It was Harry's birthday and he'd been begging for ages to go, so they'd surprised him with tickets.
"And so he wants us to find him a new home?"
Severus couldn’t help but glower at the fact, hand clenching around the goblet in his hand. “Right now we’re unsure if Dumbledore was aware of Harry’s true parentage or not. When Lily and Potter were originally killed, we were informed that the boy was being placed with blood relatives because Lily had cast blood wards on the boy. The headmaster told us he’d only be safe from the death eaters if he was with family.”
And the book! Harry had never gotten a gift before, only been given Dudley’s old clothes because Aunt Petunia didn’t want to buy him new ones or waste old ones. But now he had a book with pictures of his parents in it, all three of them! And Draco… Draco said he could
With a raised hand, Professor McGonagal silenced the room and continued her speech. "With that being said, we will be welcoming two new professors to our school. If you'd please stand," she turned, gesturing to Harry's parents with a pleased smile. "Mr. A. Z. Fell, your new professor of Magical History, and Mr. Anthony Crowley, who is a returning professor and will be taking Madam Sprouts place in Herbology. I expect you all to give them a warm welcome and treat them with the same respect as all of your teachers."
Aziraphale caught Harry's eye and waved excitedly, only to have Crowley elbow him in the side and say something too quiet for anyone else to hear.
A series of letters passed back and forth between Minerva McGonagal, Crowley, and Aziraphale, spanning over Harry's childhood.
“I am aware of how late it is,” Lucius frowned, glancing towards the grandfather clock in the corner of the room, “but it would be best if we visited Gringotts as soon as possible. I know you wish to retrieve the boy now, but without verifying your identity and relation to him through an inheritance test, I’m afraid it would be considered kidnapping. If we leave now, we can fetch the boy in less than two hours, I expect.”
“We shall take him shopping tomorrow as well,” Narcissa said decidedly, though neither of the men would dare argue. “The poor dear doesn’t look like he’s owned anything new in his life. He’ll need clothes, shoes, robes. I’d like to get him some a trunk as well for travel, maybe a few books and things for entertainment. We’ll of course have to get the boys their Hogwarts supplies but that can wait until next year. There are some wonderful books for magical children who were raised by muggles, those might be helpful for him.”
Ron snorted, saying something akin to 'you would, you nerd,' though it was soft and friendly. Harry thought about it for a while before shrugging. "I don't really care what house I'm in. I don't know much about all of them, but my Ba told me about them. My mum was a Slytherin professor when he taught at Hogwarts, and he likes to joke that my Ba is Hufflepuff. I don't care which I go to though." He smiled bright at Ron and Hermione. "I just want to be somewhere with friends."
Narcissa shook her head and straightened out a wrinkle in her skirt. “Yes, because I’m sure they’ll do the boy justice with the entire ministry in Dumbledore’s pocket.”
"You-" Aziraphale gasped.
"We'll need some sort of compensation," Vernon said sternly, crossing his arms over his chest. "You've dropped a child on us after just having our own. We have spent money on the boy already, added him to our insurance, given him a room-"
WITCHCRAFT
About halfway through the trip, there was a knock at their door and a girl with wild curls popped her head into the room, frowning. "Hi, you guys wouldn't have seen a toad around here somewhere, would you? A boy down the hall lost his again and is throwing a right fit." The boys shook their heads and she sighed. "That's alright then. Doesn't hurt to ask. You wouldn't mind me joining you, would you? My cart is rather full and I'd rather not listen to Neville cry about Trevor anymore."
They sat in the cart chatting for a while, eagerly sharing stories from their childhoods and swapping jokes. They only stopped when the trolley came by.
Crowley shrugged, adjusting his glasses slightly. "I dunno, angel. Looks alright to me."
Now, in regards to Sirius. As I'm sure you remember, the animals allowed at Hogwarts as pets are the following: owls, cats, rats, and toads. Snakes are usually a hard ban due to the incidents we've had in the past regarding Voldemort and his followers. However, I have brought up your concerns with Albus and taken into the account that Sirius is Harry's service animal. We do of course take exceptions for students with disabilities, though we haven't had the need to make an exception on snakes yet. I hope you understand that there will be strict rules as to his being allowed at Hogwarts. Sirius must not roam the halls on his own, and must be with Mr. Potter-Fell at all times if he leaves the dorm rooms. He must stay his current size, and Harry is not allowed to return him to his larger size under any circumstances. We also must ask that Harry not speak to Sirius in Parseltongue when in the presence of other students. Parseltongue, you may not know, is an extremely rare language, and it perhaps may scare other students and parents if word gets around that young Harry knows it. This may also be a given, however we ask that Sirius be made aware that there are other pets allowed at Hogwarts, and he is not allowed to eat another student's pet, including the rats.
“Had the boy been literally anyone other than who he is, I figure this would be an easy case. They would have signed the boy over and prosecuted the magical guardian immediately, especially considering the wills were ignored. However,” he continued before his wife could question him, “the ministry was unfortunately in agreement with Dumbledore at the time in question. They didn’t know anything about Severus being Harry’s birth father, however, which works in our favor more than theirs. Their missive was rather short in response, but they’ve agreed to a meeting by the end of the week to discuss the case.”
The snake lifted his head then, staring at Harry with a knowing stare.
"Look, mum! Look!"
Severus tensed at that, eyes narrowing at the goblin. “Magical Guardian? The wills should have been read and he should have been placed with whoever was named his godparents. As magical guardian, he’s had power over the heir seats by proxy and any of the vaults, right?”
of research.
I do expect that you and Mr. Crowley will not give young Harry any special treatment in his classes, and will hold him to the same standards as the rest of your students.
Aziraphale nodded. "Yes, they did make it rather hard to find you. But no matter. He will be much safer with the two of us, I assure you."
Fighting down a smile, Crowley followed close behind, nodding as he  rapped a sharp knuckle on the door. "Course, angel."
Speaking of Sirius. Harry has written him a letter and drawn him a picture of his snake. I'd like to get it to the man, but as I've no idea what that bloody prison's rules are, I don't want to make things worse for him by sneaking in to see him. I assume they do not allow visitors. Aziraphale and I would like your advice on how to go about it. If I must figure out my own way, I will, but Aziraphale thought it best to ask first.
When he didn’t answer, Severus frowned and raised an eyebrow. “You are Harry Potter are you not?”
"Gryffindor!"
Oh the possibilities of Harry breaking every expectation the world had for him if he managed to sort into Slytherin.
I look forward to seeing your family again. Please write if you have more questions.
Harry finds a new home.
He couldn't help but jump slightly as the hat touched his unruly hair. He knew that it would talk, he'd seen it talk to the other students, but hearing it was a different matter, and his fingers clenched around the wood of his stool.
His father frowned, seemingly trying to figure out his words carefully before turning back to him. “
Angel and demon were both prepared to rush forward and catch the boy, their fingers poised to snap as Harry jumped off the bookshelf without fear. Crowley launched himself over the couch to catch him, only... there was no need. Harry squealed as the broom caught the air, his legs sticking out straight as he tried to balance just above Crowley's waiting hands.
There was a long wait as Harry thought hard on the prospect, weighing the pros and cons of each house- or what he knew of them at least. He knew his parents would be proud no matter what he chose. After a few more seconds, he took a deep breath and made a decision.
long time but he remembered it vividly. It was during the summer of their fourth year. Lily had dragged him to some concert in a field for a band he’d never remembered the name of, spread out a blanket and draped herself across it with a smile that could light a thousand suns. Severus was sat next to her, his long black hair pulled into a messy bun and Lily’s with flowers woven into her braid.
Term begins on 1 September. We await your owl by no later than 31 July.
Aziraphale shifted and sat beside them, a gentle smile on his face. "Most kids can't do what you do," he told the boy carefully. "We didn't know your magic would show up so young. So you scared us because we thought you might get hurt."
Also, Percy is a slytherin and no one can convince me otherwise. I said what I said.
shocked, had been since he first laid eyes on the boy, at how much he looked like him. After so long of thinking the boy was Potter’s, of imagining a tiny boy with dark brown hair and a wicked smirk, cocky and spoiled in whatever pampered home Albus had put him in… it was hard to look at this skinny boy with broken glasses and damaged ears, with black wild curls and little button nose, and see the same child he’d imagined for so long. And what would he look like as he grew older? Would he take the spitting image of Severus aside from his eyes and small stature? Would he turn to quidditch like Potter or potions like himself? Or perhaps charms like his mother. What house would he be sorted into when he got to Hogwarts? With a Gryffindor mother and adopted father and with Severus in Slytherin.
“I cannot leave him there with her,” Severus snapped, body tensing and teeth bared like a cornered animal. “Who knows what that horrid woman has done to him.”
Crowley snorted, rolling his eyes. "I assume you mean mum, yes?"
The darker haired man grumbled and glared out over the heads of the many students. Not for the first time, Crowley wondered why he was a teacher if he appeared to hate children so much. Finally, he said, "I never expected you to come back here."
“We are aware of the unusual circumstances surrounding the situation,” Griphook was saying when Severus slipped everything back into the file and glanced up at the goblin, “but we request you return as soon as possible with the Potter heir as to read the wills. They have been sitting sealed for far too long.”
And Severus
Crowley's head shot up at that and he blinked. "Angel- you mean"
"James' boy? I sent them a bassinet few months back. What's wrong with him? What's happened?"
And wow, was it amazing.
"Yeah, there's all kinds of things a riley demon can get up to in that place, angel," he laughed. "The library is huge, you'll love it. There's a secret swimming pool somewhere on the fourth floor, or there used to be. It moves sometimes. There's a lot of ghosts that roam the halls, a polterguist, things like that. I wouldn't go too close to the lake, they've got mermaids in there, and not the super nice kind." He continued on for a while, explaining various parts of the castle to an eager-to-learn Aziraphale until the sky began to grow dark and the train lit up in soft, twinkling lights.
Ron watched the exchange in awe, never having seen that much money in his life, and Harry blushed again.
I am aware that Harry is very excited for the train ride to Hogwarts. He may of course stay with you in your train car if you wish, however the students will be free to choose their own rooms for the trip as well. I always recommend it, as it gives the children the perfect opportunity to make friends, however I am aware of you and Mr. Fell's hesitancy towards Harry's safety, so I shall leave it to your discretion.
Crowley and Aziraphale sat towards the end of the long front table, almost comically opposite as usual. Aziraphale sat very straight and proper, his usual creme waist coat now covered with an equally tan robe fitted over it. He even had a creme, pointed hat on his head that he looked very proud of as he adjusted it. Crowley too had stuck to something close to his regular attire: black leather pants, a black, skin tight tunic with fishnet sleeves, all with a thick black cloak draped over his shoulders. He didn't have a hat on, instead wearing his hair half up and half down, glasses still fit snugly over his eyes.
As for you, we would be happy to offer you a position as our History of Magic professor here at Hogwarts. I thought perhaps since you are so educated and interested in reading, as well as the fact that you have lived through most of what we teach, it might be the best position for you. It is also one of the few positions we have that does not require the use of magic, as I am well aware of your wish to be limited in your 'miracles'.
There was a tiny sign beside the door that read ‘
Harry had never
"Well yes, of course it
The boy giggled as he ran away from the demon. His feet were planted firmly on the ground, but he had a little toy broom between his legs as he pretended to fly away from Crowley. He was quick and small, slipping through the demon's legs and flittering around the tables like a snitch, giggling all the while. He made little 'zoom' and 'whoosh' sounds as he 'flew', climbing onto the couch only to jump off again.
When the demon blinked his eyes open, Harry was floating in front of him, still on the broom. Or... hanging was more accurate. His hair was wild as he hung upside down in front of the demon, face scrunched up in worry as he clung to the broom.
Anthony,
Severus nodded with a smile, lips moving as he spoke and signed together.
Just like his mother’s.
how his cold exterior he was usually so proud of cracked at that. For a moment he was glad the boy couldn’t hear the borderline whine that escaped his throat, and he was immensely glad that Lucius was gracious enough to ignore it as well. Not that his friend appeared to be taking much stock in the conversation at hand anymore. Of course, Severus was sure he was
Lucius was nodding, tapping his finger on his cane softly. “There are some stores for wizards with disabilities as well. They aren’t very common but I believe I know of one in Diagon Alley. We should stop there as well, perhaps get him an automatic writing quill that will translate lessons for him. I will speak with Draco’s tutor about adding Harry into the lessons.”
There was a series of nods and agreements, as well as students shuffling forward to leave their animals where instructed. Harry left his empty carrying case as Ron dropped off his rat Scabbers and Hermione dropped off her cat, Crookshanks.
It wasn't until they'd gotten all the way home that they'd even noticed anything was amiss.
Ron frowned, glaring at the snake as if trying to determine the truth for himself before he glanced up at Harry. "Can we pet him? Or is he like the dogs where you're not supposed to?"
Harry frowned at the book, though not upset, only confused. He put his hands together like a prayer before separating them. Draco didn’t need his uncle to translate to know the sign meant
"Oh, and be careful on the stairs, they like to move around on their own. Usually don't do it for teacher, but since you're new they may want to play around," Crowley grinned.
They only had to wait a few moments before a small figure skidded into view behind the foggy glass, his features blurred as he stumbled forward. A few clicks sounded and a second later the door was being tugged open slightly, a chain higher up keeping it from opening completely.
Harry shrugged and shook his head, adjusting his glasses. "My mom and dad left me everything they had when they died, but it wouldn't have been fair to buy everything. We wouldn't have eaten it all and the no one else would get any. But here! To replace your frog."
The blonde was a bit bewildered and tilted his head as the other sipped a cup of coffee. "You genuinely believe I'd be any good?"
They both tried to get some sleep, but it didn’t come easy.
The house elves were clothed and sent away, many of Lucius possessions were given away, and Narcissa moved to stay with Andromeda and Teddy.

“I can’t believe I was judging him on that.” He blinked a few times and shook his head. “I didn’t even consider.....” He trailed off, knowing he didn’t need to finish his sentence.
Harry furrowed his eyebrows, wanting a bit of further clarification, “You three are all dead, in the afterlife. Are you remnants of a consciousness left behind, or are the three of you sitting around in the afterlife, having this conversation in your heads?” He wanted just a bit of clarification to make sure he understood what was happening.
“Yes.”
Draco hated every second of his father’s explanation. He didn't want to hear any more of it. He glared at the man before him. Emotions flooded him and mixed into a pool of nothingness. It was like mixing every paint together, only to end up with a calm and cool black. He stood tall and took in a shaky breath, feeling everything and nothing at all. He had nothing more to say on the subject, only a deep regret for having ever loved the man before him.
Harry was silent, contemplating how honest he should be before saying, “I never mean to be.”
“No.”
Of all things, Greenwood let out a laugh. "Of course. Some idiot wrote about how great he is and now he's leading a bunch of morons against you two."
Still, standing before Wizengamot, he knew he should be focused. He knew he should pay complete attention to what went on before him. Yet somehow, he didn’t.
“Well, I’m not sure anymore. Draco ended up using a quite straining spell to help heal my body. Apparently he wasn’t suppose to do it longer than thirty seconds, but the stupid git did it for five minutes. Then, after I told him not to do it again, he waits till I fall asleep and does it again. From what I’ve gathered, my rib only needs another week to heal and my arm needs three more weeks in a cast. After that I’ll need a little bit of physical therapy to help my arm.”
The hall was huge, with four long tables taking up the main floor and another long table at the front on a sort of dias where the teachers were sat. Candles floated above them all, bobbing softly in the air and putting off no heat in the perfectly temperatured room. All the first years, Harry included, were staring in awe around the room. Until he saw his parents at the front.
"Tricky, tricky. I can see many path's for you, young Mr. Potter-"
“I-“ Severus paused, swallowing around the lump in his throat and gazing at them both gratefully. He squeezed Narcissa’s fingers softly before taking another deep breath. “I cannot take him to Hogwarts with me, and Spinner’s End is no place for a child-“
"I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I was going," Harry apologized, reaching a hand out to help the boy up.
Crowley sighed again, stepping into the room and sitting on the bed next to Harry. He reached under the pillow slowly, ignoring Harrys protests, and pulled the snake out. He was much smaller than before, though still large enough to curl around the demons full arm and then some. "Hullo, I'm sorry my son stole you, but I'm afraid he can't keep you."
clothes, and he would demand his mother see to the boy at some point about the ugly bruises across his skin.
,” Severus began, pausing slightly before sighing.
Harry nodded, his face screwing up in the same way it had when he'd been a baby and decided upon his parents names. "How about Sirius? Its my godfather's name. I've never met him, but mum says he's good and that he loved me very much. Also he was a super powerful wizard and is totally cool. But you have to stop calling me master, okay? It's just Harry."
ignored, which is illegal, it would be well within yours and Hadrian’s rights to demand he repay anything he’s taken from the vault.”
“It’s a letter from Lily Potter,” Lucius said quietly, the words barely heard over the crackle of the fire that Tipsy had started. She could feel Severus shiver in her arms, but waited for her husband to continue. “It’s to be delivered upon the tenth birthday of her son, Hadrian, in the case that something happened to her. Gringots must have sent it today.”
"This cage is too small," he answered the question, all but glaring at the sign. "He's a big snake with nowhere to go. You know how big I get when I'm like him, right? Do you think I'd be happy if I was trapped in there?"
“Deep breaths my friend,” Lucius chuckled, patting him on the shoulder as if he could read his mind and see his troubles. “Your life is going to be upside down from here on out, but it will all be worth it in the end.”
Harry's face scrunched up and he watched Crowley's lips intently. "Muh!"
Aziraphale frowned, head tilting slightly in concern. "Our help? What on earth for? What friend is this?"
Draco.
"Okay so you put your bags with the others right?"
He figured Harry must have known that already, since the boy didn’t bother even looking at his father for a translation, too awed at the picture even as he reached a finger out to touch it, stopping just before he came in contact with the parchment. He looked almost frightened for a moment but Draco didn’t say anything about it. He remembered his mother telling him to be patient with the other boy, so he was.
Lily was just as beautiful as he remembered, her green eyes twinkling in the pale photo and her smile lighting up as she laughed. He could tell it was the day of the birth because her hair was tied up in a messy bun, her skin was flushed and damp, and she was dressed in St. Mugo’s maternity gown. Still, she was the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen and he couldn’t help it when his heart lurched into his throat. In her arms was a tiny bundle wrapped in an emerald green cloth, a tuft of wild black curls just barely visible over the edge of the wrap.
"Um- hullo," Harry said with a small wave.
Ron reached forward slowly, holding his hand out like one might to a dog to let them sniff, obviously hesitant and scared. Sirius stared at the red haired boy before rolling his eyes and dipping his nose forward. His tongue flitted out softly and tickled the inside of his palm, causing Ron to giggle and reach a single finger forward to pat Sirius' head.
The demon frowned, searching those eyes that once held a very dear friend and now were filled with nothing but trauma and pain.
Severus nodded, smiling at the image before glancing at the boy. “Yes, that’s me.”
“They do seem to be doing well together, don’t they,” Narcissa smiled, following his gaze toward the boys. “If you are fine with it, Severus, I’ll put the boy in the room next to Draco’s. It’s down the hall from yours and ours anyway, but I’m sure he’ll be much more comfortable near Draco than us. Have you explained to him what we’ll be doing tomorrow yet?”
Anyway, hope you enjoy!
Crowley laughed at that and nodded, ruffling the boy's unruly hair with a soft grin. "That's right kid. Go on now. Tell your Ba, bye. We'll see you when we get to the school."
“The circumstances leading to the Potter’s death was… complicated as I’m sure you know, Lord Malfoy,” Griphook sneered, though not necessarily at the blonde, simply at the situation. “At the time, Head Warlock Albus Dumbledore took complete control over the proceedings. For the young mister Potter’s – nee Prince’s –safety, he saw to it that the boy was hidden away from prying eyes and the Ministry agreed. We goblins were not privy to any information further than that, but the wills were left in the vault and Dumbledore was named Magical Guardian.”
A difficult conversation then, the woman decided as she hid a grimace. Draco was a darling, but he grew up very privileged and proper. She would need to speak with him about how to treat the new boy so as not to frighten or upset him. Or worse, insult him.
"Yes, but you've decided to ride with the students, so I just want to make sure you've got everything you need, just in case. You've got Sirius' carrying case if they make you put him up, yes," Crowley fretted, finally taking a step back to look down at their son. Harry nodded eagerly and the demon sighed, shoulders slumping. "Very well. We'll be in the teacher's car if you need us. Don't take shit from anyone. And remember what your Ba told you. Be nice to the other kids. But remember what I told you too-"
He watched as the photo moved, Lily smiling at whoever had taken it- Potter no doubt- and shifting enough for that tiny face to come into view.
Harry had even been polite and asked the snake's name, turning a bit sad when the serpent said he was never given one.
When neither of them did so, Crowley pointed a long finger at them, the nails painted a wicked black, and hissed. "Sssssit. Down." With a little wiggle of magic, the two muggles jolted into action, their bodies not their own as Crowley maneuvered them into the couch across from them.
After a moment, the boy squeaked and shut the door, only to open it again and hold up a hand to them as if to tell them to stay. The men nodded in agreement, sharing a glance with each other as they waited. There was a loud shuffling behind the door, the sound of a chain clanking against the door and some more shuffling. Seconds later, the door was pulled open completely to reveal the small boy, huffing and puffing like he’d been running around. He pushed a small step stool out of the way- no doubt used to help him reach the chain- and rushed up towards Severus, holding up a photo and pointing at it and giving a soft, “ah?”
As they walked to the library they spoke in hushed voices. “So, you and Draco are getting pretty close.”
Harry let out a mix of a growl and a whine. Whatever it was, it was needy. He found that his opening was lit up with a thrill that shot across his lower stomach. Inside of him, he realized there were so many little nerve endings that he didn’t even know were there. It was almost overwhelming to feel such pleasure for the first time.
"Still." He said as he wiped himself off, "I don't like dirt."
Draco nodded. "They will, and we can't control the stories they'll put out or the speculations people will make. It's a risk we have to take, if we want to." Although they had agreed to spend some time together, he knew it was much more difficult in practice.
“How so?” He asked.
Harry couldn’t help but to crack a smile. “So, your my boyfriend now?” His voice was wrecked from his orgasm.
“Like I said, you aren’t half bad.” They began walking out together, Narcissa a few steps behind them. “So, am I gonna see you at Hogwarts? I’d like to whip you in Quidditch a couple more times, and I might as well prove I’m a much better at brewing potions than you.” Harry challenged.
"You wanted to make an example?! Harry, what happened to you?"
Draco was angry. He couldn't comprehend the kind of monsters that the Dursleys were. Although he couldn't do lash out at them like he wanted, he hoped something terrible would happen to them. Draco was also a bit amazed at how Harry had gone so long without ever telling anyone. It couldn't've been easy to hold it in or let it out, so he appreciated the trust Harry had for him. “And you’ve never told anyone?” He asked, expecting Harry to agree. But he didn’t. He hesitated long and hard, and Draco could tell Harry was struggling with something heavy. He saw the other jab his nails even harder and faster, and for a moment he didn’t know what to think. He’s never seen Harry so afraid before. Even in the face of war or a boggart, he’s never been this scared. It killed Draco and all he could do was squeeze Harry's hand in a feeble attempt at comfort.
Then came the hard part, examining Harry’s body.
"Yes, thank you for coming on such short notice." There wasn't a hit of gratitude in his voice, he only said it to be polite. He seemed to just want to get everything over with. "Your mother-in-law, Narcissa Malfoy, would like to will her inheritance to your husband, Draco Malfoy. Given the nature of your marital contract, all of his properties must be approved of by you before he can own them. I need your verbal approval on the following properties." He said as he slid a few files towards Harry.
By the time Scorpius came through, the textbook was updated and ready. Harry went through the same night with Scorpius that he did with Teddy. He ended it the same way.
Now that he’s had time to heal, he’s also had time to get angry. He's had time to realize just how fucked up and twisted some people in his life were. Although Dumbledore wasn't that bad, be still harbored a mix of resentment and respect for the man.
To create, alter, or nullify a law, Wizengamot must come to some kind of agreement between at least two-thirds of the members. To do this, debates would be held before time to vote. The older members, who were closer to Voldemort and of higher status, were as stubborn as ever. Even newer members of higher status stood with the older members, working to refuse any change that Shacklebolt or young rebels pushed for. At every debate, each side’s argument was jumbled and filled with repetition due to people scrambling to feed off each other. They'd all argue in circles for hours each week and the impartial members felt intimidated to not pick a side. No progress was the same as a win for the stubborn members.
When it was their turn, each entered their history class, got their textbook, skimmed through it, found the chapter on Harry, and binged it all that night.
"You are, after all, tied up and at my mercy. I could blow your mind and leave you trembling with an orgasm, or, I could keep you up all night until you're crying for release. It's really up to you."
Ron was ecstatic to have the book and he spent a couple hours with Harry before going off to spend the day with Hermione and their friends.
A son… he had a son.
Cute.
“The child,” she said as she raised a hand to rest on the back of Severus’ head, holding him, grounding him. “Where is he now? Would he not have been placed with family? Did their will not name a godparent of any kind? Even if Severus was never known to be the true father, some kind of guardian would have been appointed.”
"Do. You. Care?" He repeated.
Harry still looked confused, but to Draco’s delight, he shuffled out a bit from his father’s leg and stuck his hands out to show they were empty, bowing slightly. His form was terrible, his hands more shoved out than gently displayed and he bowed much too deeply, but Draco was pleased anyway, and it appeared the adults were as well. Besides, there was plenty of time to teach him properly before he met anyone else. When he glanced back up, he signed a few things in Draco’s direction, fingers slowly spelling something out before he took two fingers and waved them in the air above his face in the shape of a sowilo.
So to say he was surprised to be ripped away from the bookshop and tossed into a dank looking prison cell that smelled like death was an understatement.
"And you look beautiful, as always," the wizard smirked, though it fell a bit flat as he winced. Slowly, he reached through the circle and grabbed Crowley's wrist, forcing the demon to grab his in return. "I-I don't have time to explain. You owe me a favor, Crowley."
"And yet I am. And let me remind you of something, Severus Snape," the demon growled, leaning towards the wizard and letting his glasses slip just enough for the man to see his serpent eyes. "Harry is
“ he paused, pulling his hand back from where he was pointing at the man. “
"I do." It wasn't a question, but Sirius nodded anyway. "But if you want me to get you out of here, you'll have to break the seal and-"
Harry makes some friends and Mum and Ba are worried little fretters.
“Petunia wouldn’t have even taught him about magic,” Severus sneered, running a sweaty hand through his hair. “He didn’t know about moving photographs or that owls delivered mail. I honestly have no doubt she wouldn’t have told him
Harrys eyes widened in excitement, bouncing slightly. "Mag-ick! Mag-ick!"
It reminded him of the lack of photos they’d seen in Petunia’s house. The lack of any sign that Harry even lived there other than the light above the door and the…
“He’ll no doubt be behind Draco,” Severus commented with a frown. “I’m sure Petunia let him go to school so she didn’t get in trouble, but I have my doubts that she allowed him help on his studies. Not to mention he’ll have no knowledge whatsoever on wizarding subjects.”
? Everyone knows the story of Harry Potter.”
Been a while, hasn't it? Good to hear from you and I'm sorry about James and Lily. As for how we found out, Sirius called in a favor I owed him. I trust you won't use that information against him, as I've found out he's trapped in that terrible Ministry prison. Aziraphale went along with it perfectly, and honestly I'm surprised he was so calm about the situation. You'll never believe where we found Harry. Those bastards had him locked in a cupboard under the stairs! The stairs, Minerva! We left up your wards for them, but I do hope they rot in hell for the way they've treated Harry.
Aziraphale nodded. "I see. Well, shall we open it then?" He asked, smiling up at Crowley.
“Of course,” was his reply. “I’m sure Harry would be happy to teach you as well, now off you go.”
The Angel huffed and clenched his fists at his sides. "You have a five bedroom home! How- how..." He took a deep breath, forcing himself to calm as Crowley snapped his fingers and a tight scarf appeared around his torso that he carefully slid Harry into. The sight calmed him and he took another breath before facing the two. "You will never see us or Harry again. You will never contact him or us. You will be compensated for the amount of money you've had to spend on him- the
Minnie,
Crowley had come to Harry's room to announce dinner, only to hear him mumbling quietly behind the door. Or perhaps hissing was a more accurate, though Crowley could easily understand his words.
“We are going to fetch him now,” Lucius said when Severus didn’t respond, moving to stand and bowing his head slightly to the goblin. “We appreciate your help Master Griphook and would further appreciate your discretion as this matter unfolds.”
‘Distraught’ was probably too loose a term for what the couple came upon when they entered the room. Severus had indeed collapsed into one of the large arm chairs, hunched over with his elbows on his knees and his head in one hand. His hair was tangled and messy, hiding his face and looking like he’d gotten into a fight with nargles, and his free hand was clutching a piece of parchment so tightly Narcissa was surprised it hadn’t torn yet.
- sat just a foot away.
Narcissa smiled and placed a hand on the boy’s cheek, her face softening in the way it always did when she was particularly fond of Draco. “Of course dear, I think that would be a wonderful idea. Why don’t you go get it. Quickly now, they should be here any minute.”
