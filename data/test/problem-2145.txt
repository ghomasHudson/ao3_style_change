“Shh,” Draco soothed him, sliding his hands up Harry’s chest and cupping his jaw, turning his head towards him. “You can. You
Harry snorted. “I don’t deserve anything. I tricked Draco into falling in love with me, and now I can’t even look at him. He
are bound. That has to mean something. You said your ancestor believed White Mages were born for a destiny, right?”
, I still got –” He coughed. “I mean, but – I didn’t feel that need to submit, to beg him for – well. You know.”
He wasn’t lying, exactly, though he could see Hermione thought he was. But how could he not be fine, when his friends were fine, and his plan to save Draco had succeeded? Draco was alive. Ron and Hermione were alive. That was all that mattered.
Another ripple went through the courtroom. Robards nodded. “Thank you, Miss Granger. I know that must have been difficult for you. Now, will you tell us what happened next?”
Harry leaned in the rest of the way, covering Malfoy’s mouth with his own. Their lips slipped and caught sweetly, and there was a tug just below Harry’s navel, as if he’d picked up a Portkey by accident – but lower, warmer. He moaned, sliding his fingers into the hair at Malfoy’s nape, pulling his head back and biting his way inside that wet mouth.
pause. That he even mentioned it shows how seriously he considers my failure. I will be sacrificed, and then, when my magic has been completely drained from me and I am helpless to defend myself, he’ll give me to Greyback.”
Draco didn’t say that it was his legal right to do just that, because he owned Harry, and no medical professional in the wizarding world would treat (or not treat) Harry without Draco’s permission. They both knew it. It was just that Draco knew better than to say it, now. “You agreed,” he said instead, mildly.
He waved his wand, and sent Harry back to sleep. Dashing a hand across his eyes, he stumbled out of the cell and ran down the row, searching frantically for the mop of purple-pink hair. “Tonks,” he gasped out, desperately relieved to find her conscious and unharmed.
Pansy sat in the Muggle Studies classroom on the third floor, staring out the window. It faced east, towards the Forbidden Forest, but the glass was thick and rippled with age, and the rain blurred it even more, so that she could barely see past the greenhouses below.
“A noble sentiment, Potter,” he bit out, “but I haven’t saved your life twice now just to let you throw it away.”
As soon as he destroyed his Horcruxes, he would die. Voldemort was confident he could do it. All he had to do… was escape a magical prison without magic.
“And when the war starts?” Harry said, because that was why Dumbledore had tried to keep them apart, and there was a terrible, dark fear in him at the thought of Draco asking him to sacrifice himself to Voldemort. Because he would. He would do anything for his Alpha, and the world would burn because of it. He said, “We’re on different sides,” but they weren’t, really, not anymore.
“S.P.E.W.,” Hermione said, stiffly. “And yes. But there’s a house-elf down in the kitchens who works for a real salary now, and I’m still hopeful that where one is freed... I just have to work out a new strategy. It’s just –” she looked guilty now, “they
“Yes, my lord,” Draco said. “I apologise, my lord. I didn’t count on Pansy being there. I sent her off, out of the way, but I underestimated Gibbon’s ability to keep her busy.”
with a simple shield, but Draco’s non-verbal confusion spell got through. Yaxley blinked, staggering a little. Professor Lupin cast a spell that threw him off his feet. Draco froze him with
“This is different,” he said, wonderingly. “It’s not like last time.” Yes, he wanted to be held down and fucked, but he
Of course, even if it was, that didn’t mean the Dark Lord wouldn’t still torture him for Draco’s failure.
“Mm,” Malfoy agreed, not really paying attention. His finger was on Harry’s lips, now, and Harry was gazing at him in something very much like adoration.

“No,” Draco agreed. “But actions speak louder than words. He took an Unbreakable Vow for me. He attempted to kill Dumbledore, which would have made him an fugitive, for
“And you can’t force your way in, not without knowing what they’ve turned the Room into,” Vince agreed. “That’s the way it works.”
Pansy stared down at Draco. His chest wasn’t moving anymore, but that didn’t mean anything. He was just breathing very slowly. She fumbled for a pulse, but her hands were shaking too badly. She couldn’t find one. He was limp, his lips an unpleasant shade of blue.
“Indeed, Miss Brocklehurst,” Burbage said. “I believe it is a cautionary tale, a satire of male behaviour. The framing of the play within the induction supports this argument, as do the over-arching themes of Shakespeare’s other plays – Romeo and Juliet, for example, or Antony and Cleopatra, with such strong female leads. What you have to understand is that in the Muggle Elizabethan era, marriages of love were booming, and attitudes towards women were beginning to change.
Amycus yelled in fury, rushing forward. There was a blood-curdling scream. He fell, still screaming. Bellatrix had hit him from behind with the Cruciatus Curse. She crowed, apparently unconcerned with the fact that she was torturing one of her own.
After a great deal of back and forth, and yelling about traps and traitors and letting a snot-nosed kid give them orders, they were all overruled by Dumbledore. Kingsley, Moody and Tonks returned to the Ministry to begin preparations. They had agreed that infiltrating under the cover of darkness would have the greatest likelihood of success, as well as giving those affected by the Scorched Earth spell time to recover.
Harry ignored her, reaching out for his Alpha, alarmed at the way Draco was swaying. Or was that him? “I feel – odd,” he said, pressing a hand to his forehead.
“A-all right?” he stammered, clasping her hand gracelessly. She bent slightly to kiss his cheek. “Uh, Mrs –”
Pansy gaped. A Time-Turner. She stared at him, at the dark circles under his eyes, and horror almost overwhelmed her. When he was already so exhausted he was overdosing on a combination of potions that could potentially destroy his shields, leaving him open and vulnerable to the Dark Lord, to
“You have no idea what I’m capable of,” Malfoy snarled, taking an aggressive step forward. “I’m not you, Potter. I know you tried to use the Cruciatus Curse on my aunt last year. She told me you couldn’t do it, even though she killed your godfather right in front of you. I’m not like you.
“A wizard’s magical core is his soul,” Madam Pomfrey explained. “Or, at least, a reflection of it. And what I saw is something I have never seen in all my years of practice; the colours of your souls, reaching out to each other and intertwining. It was almost blinding in its beauty. And it explains how you were able to ‘share’ your magic. As for why neither of you were drained from such an outburst of magic, I still cannot say.”
“No,” Draco hushed him, still staring Dumbledore down. “You said blood protection. I’m a Dark wizard. I
Two Death Eaters walked into view, carrying Hestia. She was unconscious, bound in ropes, blood in her hair. Everything in Elphias revolted at the sight. Why were they taking her? What could they possibly need with her?
June Redcombe’s boyfriend defected, and the two walked around hand-in-hand, broad smiles splitting both their faces. Harry did a double-take the first time he saw them on the seventh floor, and then realised stupidly that of course Crabbe and Goyle had no reason to Polyjuice themselves anymore. Draco’s task was finished.
“I do not beg,” Draco said, outraged. The effect was rather lost under the assault of Harry’s lips. “Oh, for Merlin’s sake,” he said in exasperation, when they broke apart.
As it happened, Granger and Weasley were already waiting for them outside the Room, along with Dumbledore, Snape and McGonagall.
“Actually,” Harry said, frowning, “I think Hermione might’ve finally admitted how she feels about him. Maybe. But apparently Ron’s all freaked out, which is
“Aroused, Granger,” Draco said, in a tone of long-suffering. Harry heard several quick, indrawn breaths. He couldn’t look at anyone, instead closing his eyes tightly, hunching his shoulders and wishing very hard that he was
What with exams, and trying to figure out how to remove a Horcrux from a living person (which had never been done before) using a soul-bond (something so rare that most of the alleged ‘research’ was actually just myth and conjecture) between two White Mages (a category of Mage no one except Malfoy’s ancestor had ever, apparently, even identified), she hadn’t had much time left over for party preparation.
, even though the grey eyes were wet, and his mouth quivered. “Because I couldn’t think of anything else
Lunch in the Great Hall was a quiet affair, ordinarily; students trickling in and out over the hour-long break to grab a bite, catching up with friends and finishing last-minute homework for the afternoon’s classes. But that day, it seemed like the entire student body was crammed into the Great Hall, everyone buzzing with the new, juicy gossip.
.” She was lying crumpled on the bed, as if she’d been discarded there like an unwanted rag-doll, unconscious and bloody.
Harry woke with a cry, cold and sweating, his heart trying to beat out of his chest. His scar burned.
“And how did you feel about that?” Robards asked. “Given that you, yourself, are Muggleborn? That you, or your family, might be next?”
The Weasleys’ package dropped, unnoticed, to the ground. “One, then. But don’t think this means anything,” Malfoy warned, breathlessly.
Across from them was most of the professors, and a sullen-looking Dawlish, who glared at Harry and Draco. Harry’s best friends were squashed in another corner, behind Kingsley Shacklebolt. Pansy hadn’t been invited, which didn’t particularly surprise Draco. Not
The ceiling of the Great Hall was painted a deep shadow-blue, the few, tiny stars in the sky above drowned out by thousands of floating candles casting warm, yellow light over the four long dinner tables.
me?” he said, fury choking him, and he tried to lunge forward but his body was in too much pain, too exhausted to do anything but twitch futilely towards the other boy.
Tears pricked at her eyes, but she refused to let them fall. She knew she could be a bit oblivious at times, but at least she knew when to admit she’d been beaten. No matter how much she disliked the Prince of Slytherin, no matter how stupid she thought Harry was for falling for his lies…
“Harry,” Narcissa greeted, descending the steps gracefully. She made no move towards him, though, glancing back at Draco instead, just like Madam Pomfrey always did, deferring to Draco when it came to his care. But unlike Madam Pomfrey, Narcissa had only done it once before; just after their first heat, when Draco had been torn between his need to show the world that Harry was
Draco sucked in a breath, and his eyelids fell in a way that Harry knew meant he was trying to hide something. Arousal, in this case, and Harry grinned.
Finnigan was, after all, the only Gryffindor in Potter’s close orbit who had taken an interest in her. He was almost as vital to her plan as Potter himself.
Seamus waved a hand at him. “Go, go. Snog your girlfriend, you horny devil. Just don’t forget to tell her about The Plan! I’ll want you both with me when we talk to Ron and Hermione. We have to get them on board before we even
turn-around, wasn’t it? From desperately trying to convince half the professors on staff that Draco Malfoy had been recruited by Lord Voldemort, to being in ‘love’ with him?”
“Yes, sir,” Harry agreed, cringing inwardly at the thought of having to write another sixteen inches for Snape. And it would have to be completely different from his last one, too, so as not to arouse suspicion.
, you fucker!” George yelled. He couldn’t hold himself up anymore. He fell back, knocking the wind out of himself. “
“Terry Boot asked me,” Alexia said, in a hushed voice. She was a pretty girl with auburn curls and green eyes, and she held in her hands a coveted invitation to the sixth years’ end-of-year party. It had charms on it so that only those who had been invited could read it. “Can you believe it?”
“No,” she interrupted him again. “This obsession you have with him just isn’t healthy! I don’t care if he
Cardosa shrugged. “They knew the risks. Drop your wands, boys. The rest of you, walk away. You’re outnumbered ten to one.”
“No,” Harry sighed, leaning into him. He pressed a kiss to Draco’s jaw, and Draco turned towards him, seeking.
Robards guided her over to the witness chair in the middle of the room, and she perched on the edge nervously. “If you would state your name and relationship to the defendant for the court, please.”
“Of course they are, my good boys,” Molly said, tearfully. “I Floo-called Charlie as soon as I heard; he’s coming in from Romania. Fred and George are meeting him at Heathrow. They’ll bring him here.”
“Oh, no,” Pansy said. “That’s not her style at all. She’s far more likely to lay in wait for you and
“Merlin’s, actually,” Draco said. “Or, at least, it’s old enough to be.” He leaned into Harry’s shoulder, yawning. “Sure you want to know?”
Lucius glanced back at them. “I can’t bring you through with me, if that’s what you’re thinking,” he said, coldly. “I also can’t advise you on breaching them. As Auror Tonks can no doubt verify, you would need an army. Or a portkey, made by the Dark Lord himself.” He paused. “But I wish you luck. And if you do get through, beware the walking dead. Fiendfyre will kill them, as in the last war, but the Dark Lord has enchanted them to be impervious to all other flames.”
“Mr Malfoy is not above Hogwarts’ rules, Harry,” Dumbledore said, and Potter turned pleading eyes on him. “However,” he said, more gently, “I can assure you that he will not be expelled or suspended.”
Pansy Disapparated, too, to his surprise. She landed behind Macnair, opened the bubble, and fired. A green flash. Macnair fell. “
Thank you to everyone for the comments and kudos! Please do let me know if you're enjoying it so far xx
He twisted his hands together, and then frowned at the odd, crusty sensation. He looked down to find his hands and arms covered in blood, dried and flaking. There were dark, rusty circles on his jeans, splatter up his front, and the new, summer robes Pansy had bought him were ruined. Revolted, he scrabbled for his wand, casting
“I’ve been thinking about this, you know,” Harry said conversationally, straddling him. “Jerking off to it. And I thought… it’s really not fair that I can’t fuck you at the same time as I ride you. I want everything. I want your total surrender, your total submission. I want to be stretching your hole with my cock even as I fuck myself on your cock. So I came up with a spell. A sort of variation of the stretching one.”
Pansy felt a tremor of uncertainty, but there was hope, too, blooming bright and warm in her heart. It was foolishness, she knew that, and it made her angry. “And if you can’t?”
details of Dumbledore’s deal with Rita Skeeter, and whether she knows more about Malfoy’s task than she told him, or he told
Of course there was darkness inside him. It made sense. Why else would the Dursleys have treated him as they did, all those years? Clearly they’d seen something in him; the same thing Justin had. Something that wasn’t worthy of love, or care, or even decency. He was broken. Perhaps irreparably.
Draco stared at him for a moment, and then laughed. “All right,” he said, stretching up to kiss those infuriatingly pretty lips. “You’re bloody certifiable, but I’m past caring right now. Chocolate.”
Hestia!” He scrambled up. Her body flew towards him. The nearest Death Eaters began to turn. He caught her with an
A flash of green caught Pansy’s eye. She threw herself sideways, slamming into Katie. They both went down. Pansy rolled, casting a non-verbal
“Snape will give you an extra day,” Harry whispered back, a little puzzled. Malfoy had almost died; there was no way the professors wouldn’t take that into account. But then he caught sight of Snape’s forbidding expression, and the almost-but-not-quite hidden concern in those dark eyes, and he looked back at Malfoy, at the unnatural panic on his usually-composed face.
“Pull your hand back in,” Snape said, gently. He put a hand on the doorknob, and then paused. “I cannot tell you what to do, but I would ask that you bear in mind that Dumbledore and I both had traumatic experiences, and as such, any advice we give you is biased. We are not the norm, as much as any Alpha-Omega bond can be considered 'normal'. You should know that, while I had my true Alpha, while we were together... it was the only time in this life I have ever been truly happy.”
“I’ll give you language,” Draco muttered, but he was helpless against Harry’s touch, already surrendering to his embrace, his cock hardening in Harry’s hand.
The moving staircases refused to go further than the second floor, and spat them out near the North Tower.
did it. You were as much a part of it as Draco and I, and everyone who fought that day.” He realised he was rubbing his chest, and forced himself to stop. “But you were right about being united when he came for us. With our bond open, we had the means to defeat him, together. Closed, we would have failed.”
. “Oh Merlin, oh Merlin,” he babbled, pressing his forehead to the cool stone floor. It didn’t help. He needed to be
“Ah, yes,” the Dark Lord said. “You thought he was dead. Told the whole world about it, in fact. Quite the demoralising blow for your side, I imagine. I hesitate to say I couldn’t have planned it better myself.”
to cover it.” He pressed the plate of shepherd’s pie into Malfoy’s hands. “Eat, yeah? I haven’t had dessert either. It was apple and rhubarb crumble tonight, and I don’t like rhubarb much, myself. I’m looking forward to those cream cakes.”
, lighting up the common room and bringing smiles to the faces of even the most frightened and miserable of them. But then, Seamus had been spending a lot of time around the Slytherins recently. Perhaps he’d learned to be cautious.
Draco looked sceptical. “Every child in the wizarding world knows your scar. Not just in Britain, but all over the world. The symbol of the boy who survived the Dark Lord’s Killing Curse. You and that scar are synonymous.”
“No, no, my boy,” Dumbledore interrupted. He looked tired, suddenly. “That won’t be necessary. You’re right. It should be your decision. I won’t Obliviate young Mr Malfoy without your permission, I give you my word.”
Harry felt sick at the idea of Bellatrix gloating over Sirius to the Malfoys. He wanted to lash out, to answer Malfoy’s ugly taunting with fists or an Unforgivable curse of his own, just to prove he
“They worked,” Ron told him. “Only one’s been breached so far. That’s something. And it would have had to be someone
He swung around, taking in the Quidditch pitch under a bright blue sky. It was warm and sunny, and he caught a flash of the golden Snitch high above them.
“I’m aware,” McGonagall said, grimly. “Nothing else could cause the boundary wards to react like this. Unfortunately, while Professor Dumbledore appointed me his successor many years ago, I need his body to do the ritual. Or failing that, his wand. Neither of which we have.”
Hermione frowned. “But an illusion like that would require even more power. To sustain it over a period of time, to fool even
“Ah, yes.” Voldemort sighed. “The traitorous Miss Parkinson. I must confess to being disappointed. I would not have thought her capable of such treachery, but clearly her mother corrupted her long before I got to her. Working against me to turn you. It’s almost tragic.”
Draco bowed, low. A small smile appeared on his lips. “I may have a suggestion in that regard, my lord.”
other than him was at least a little embarrassed), but he was obviously in earnest. “Malfoy might not have been who I'd have chosen for you, but then, none of us would have chosen him. And we would have all been wrong. He's good for you, and he makes you happy, and that means
“I’ve never seen anything like it,” Dawlish said. His eyes were red, but his voice was steady. Dumbledore gave him an approving nod.
“Uh –” Harry said, but Draco was already standing and lifting his wand. He cast a number of protective enchantments around the cupboard, and was out of breath and shaking by the time he’d finished.
“Oh, don’t be so tiresomely predictable, Atwood,” Draco yawned, leaning into Potter a little more. He was deliberately flaunting his fucked-out state, Pansy realised, where once he might have tried to hide what he perceived as a weakness. It was his strength now, and Pansy’s heart broke a little more at the realisation. “You have a Gryffindor here right now. Or did you somehow fail to notice the flaming red hair on Miss Weasley?”
Lunch was an hour, so they still had some time to fill, even after Harry snuck out with his Invisibility Cloak to fetch them something to eat.
Ron just laughed, and Madam Finch started up from her seat, her expression forbidding. Ron buried his head in his textbook.
“Harry!” Draco skidded to a stop beside him and fell to his knees, his face filled with panic as he ran his hands over Harry’s chilled skin. “What happened? Are you okay? I woke up and you were gone and I could feel
Harry snorted. He splashed his face with cold water, and all he could think was that a few short hours ago, he would have been doing this with magic; just a simple wave of his hand, his own magic supplemented by Draco’s through their bond.
to fully master, you left yourself vulnerable to attack by a megalomaniac who used your very legitimate fears for the safety of your only real family to lure you into a trap. You acted rashly, Harry. Never mind that you were isolated from the Order, with Dumbledore and McGonagall gone. Don’t think I didn’t notice your attempt at veiled communication with Snape, in Umbridge’s office. You must have been
“I don’t believe you,” Harry said automatically, even as everything he had never really understood about the professor began to slot into place. “You’re lying.”
“The prophecy says I have the power to defeat him,” Harry corrected him. “Maybe that’s only ensuring my Horcrux dies. But I will try, I promise. I know what the wizarding world expects of me. Just… nothing ever really goes to plan with us, does it?”
Hermione’s eyes lit up. “Of course! That really would be a serious blow, Harry! Think of how many Death Eaters have children here! If we could turn
Madam Puddifoot was a plump, cheerful woman who wore about as much pink as Dolores Umbridge, but was always smiling and kind. Pansy remembered her impromptu date with Seamus, when they’d played hooky together to send Draco’s letter. Then later, when she’d told him the truth about that letter. The way he’d held her, as she’d cried.
you wouldn’t, sir, and I knew if I told you the truth, you’d never believe I would stay away from him. I
“I wish I wasn’t,” Harry said, with feeling. “And, by the way, that spell ‘for enemies’? It’s a bloody good thing I didn’t try it out on anyone in the middle of a battle. Draco says it practically cuts the victim to ribbons. Another of Snape’s sick inventions.”
“Then,” he said slowly, seeing a ray of hope, “you could offer him a way out now. You could get him out before he has time to complete his task.”
“Careful!” Neville cried, wrapping his hands around Pansy’s to steady the plant. “Dittany of Crete is more sensitive than White Dittany. You have to keep a
Harry didn’t want to admit that it hadn’t even crossed his mind. “There were mitigating factors,” he said, weakly.
Draco nodded. “Go help,” he told Millicent. He made swift work of each layer; a twist of magic here, the unravelling of a knot there. And then, with an “
“You’re mental,” Weasley said, flatly. “Harry wouldn’t fancy Ferret-face if he were the last bloke on the planet. He’s got gerblins in his attic because he thinks Malfoy’s a Death Eater, not because he wants to
Elphias rolled, just as little, careful to make the movement as slow and imperceptible as possible. What he saw filled him with horror. Dumbledore, slumped at Voldemort’s feet. Dumbledore’s wand, pale and knotted, in Voldemort’s hand.
He let Draco claim him, let him probe and explore, sucked on his Alpha’s tongue with all the need and desperation of a seventeen-year-old boy. But there was something wrong. His skin was burning, the familiar-but-long-forgotten ache of the heat creeping up on him, but his body wasn’t reacting like it was supposed to, no slick wetness trickling down between his thighs, no unbearable arousal between his legs. He
But that wasn’t true, was it? And yet Dumbledore – Dumbledore who, with the wisdom of his years, should surely have known better – had encouraged the notion. He was
Harry and Draco spent their stolen hours in their Room. Harry was exhausted, but he didn’t want to waste what little time they had left. He cuddled close to Draco, dozing lightly as his lover skimmed through the books he’d borrowed out from the library. Harry’s tiny dragon was perched on the top of the bedpost above them, watching over them.
The Potions classroom was quiet, only the scratch of quills across parchment disturbing the peace. Slughorn was writing his notes for their next potion up on the board, back turned to the class, and Harry let his attention drift. As so often these days, he found himself staring at the back of Malfoy’s head.
Dumbledore sighed. “Not at all, my dear boy. The shadow of war is affecting us all, and a certain paranoia is not unjustified. You, more than anyone else, bear this burden.”
the traditional choice for dates, as opposed to hook-ups, which generally took place in the Astronomy Tower.
There were several gasps at the Dark Lord’s name, and Harry sighed. Draco took his hand and squeezed it. “Breakout? What breakout?” he asked.
The trial recessed at four-thirty that afternoon, by which time Harry was almost falling asleep on the bench. So far, nothing much seemed to have happened; it was all boring legalese, precedents and pleas (“not guilty,” Justin had said clearly, his eyes on his father, who teared up and nodded vigorously – the only interesting bit in the entire day) and calls for a mistrial on the basis of a legal technicality that Harry couldn’t make heads nor tails of, but which took an agonisingly long time to explain before being rejected.
. I have to make sure it's a fair trial, at least. Not - not because he's my ex, but because he was there for me at a bad time. I owe him for that. And if I hadn’t kissed you out in full view of anyone passing by, when he’d only just found out about his mum and sister… it never would have happened.”
She shrugged, sitting crossways on the bench next to him. “Bit of a surprise,” she admitted. “But I had a good teacher. I’ll do my best.”
Draco was trapped, caged; not so very different from Katherina. A pretty, defenceless bird, afraid to even spread his wings within the confines of the cage, let alone fly out if someone opened the door for him. He couldn’t. There was no one he could trust not to slam the door in his face, or to reach out a hand and crush him in it.
“Damn straight we are,” Ron said, loyally. “Voldemort’s bloody well not getting the better of us this time. You’ve survived everything else the bastard’s thrown at you. This is just one more obstacle before we can
Draco’s heart leapt. “All right?” he echoed. Harry nodded, and Draco sat up straighter, clasping his hands together. It was ridiculous, but he felt like a nervous virgin on his first date. He wanted
Draco shook his head. “You’ve lost more people than anyone should ever have to. No one expects you to ‘deal well’ with that. We're all a – a little messed up, and you have more right than anyone to deal with everything that happened however you want, however long it takes. I was just afraid that Dobby was one too many, and you wouldn’t be able to forgive me. I was afraid that I’d trapped you in a loveless bond; that you’d be miserable for the rest of your life unless I let you go –”
Seamus relaxed, and winked at Pansy, who was looking vaguely amused as Neville disentangled their hands with stammered apologies.
The gentle tone touched that same place inside Harry, relaxing him enough to be able to look up at his friends. Hermione appeared, strangely enough, relieved at his answer, and her hand had found and gripped Ron’s tightly. When he met Ron’s gaze, however, it was bewildered and just a little pitying, and Harry turned away quickly, his face burning.
“It’s just, every time it’s happened,” Hermione said, her voice a plea for Harry to take over. He ignored her valiantly. “That is, there’s a pattern Harry – we noticed. I don’t know if it’s relevant, or how it relates to the accidental magic, but every time it’s happened, he’s been, uh – he’s been –”
Draco had always refused to strip down completely in front of him, and even though he knew why, he was suddenly desperate to
“If you want him to be,” Pansy said. “In some of the paths, a big part. The others… you’ll have to See for yourself. Will you look?”
how to manipulate me into accepting Potter’s offer, which means you knew this was a possibility. Maybe even planned for it.”
Dumbledore shook his head. “Where there are good men, Alastor, there will always be those willing to fight the evil in this world.” He sighed. “But you’re right. We can’t afford to lose the Ministry.”
Draco shook his head. “No. Not anymore. Betraying you would be betraying me, and she would never do that.”
“– but as you are clearly determined to stay, I will have a word with Madam Pomfrey,” Dumbledore concluded. He nodded at Harry and moved to Draco’s bed, twitching aside the curtain. There was a whispered conference, and then Professor Snape exited, glaring at Harry as he passed.
“Bloody hell,” Ron groaned, rubbing the back of his head. “Make it back from the bloody future for you, and this is the thanks I get?”
Draco’s heart almost stopped. He was a traitor. If they captured him, the very best he could hope for would be to be killed immediately. He had to stay hidden, stay safe, until he could get back inside the castle wards. On the other hand… his duty to his father had always taken precedence over everything else in his life. No matter what Lucius had done, he had a responsibility to get up, reveal himself, go to the man who had sired him.
Harry nodded, subdued. “We both were. You know I wouldn’t have blamed you, though? I understand what she means to you.”
Reassurance poured through their bond, and Harry nodded, letting it relax him, trying not to think about Draco’s glaring omission:
Raising her mirror again, she concentrated on a small imperfection in the mirror’s surface, allowing it to draw her into the trance required for a reading. For a moment, she drifted for a moment, letting unwanted, unproductive thoughts fall away. And then she brought her thoughts deliberately back to Draco.
Seamus sighed. “Yeah.” Bellatrix had really done a number on the poor fellow. He had unceremoniously stopped their advanced Charms tutoring, and everyone had seen him cowering in a corner like a child, during the Nightmare Curse. “I wish we could help him,” he said, quietly.
me?” His face flushed with pain and humiliation, and Harry longed to take him in his arms and just hold him. “Did you laugh to yourself, when I told you I loved you back?”
"Yeah, they are; it's just, ever since Ginny and I divorced...well, I don't want to be around her that much, so I just skip out. I'll probably go next year or something, it's just still too soon."
Only one person had applied for the position: Cho Chang. She'd apparently been working as a sports reporter for Quidditch Quarterly since leaving Hogwarts, and not been very happy at the job. So when she saw the advert in the paper, and remembered the Quibbler being the only publication telling the truth about Voldemort coming back and how Cedric died, she'd decided to interview — and she was an instant fit.
“You aren’t that heavy,” Draco said, sitting up and reaching toward the bedside table for his wand. “I can take it.”
He checked his watch — a present from Ron and Hermione before he left — and started. He should probably be going now if he wanted to have time to prepare a bit before his first students. His first class was going to be Second Year Hufflepuffs, so at least he was starting off easy.
Perhaps he should put that matter aside for now as well. He wondered if Ron and Neville had ever come back. Harry figured he'd been spaced out for a few hours at this point and ended the charm around his bed. He heard snores and even breathing filling the room. Definitely four people.
Harry tapped him on the shoulder and asked for the password, realising only once he had begun asking that it was Dennis Creevey. He swallowed a lump in his throat and tried not to think about how it was
"Yeah. All that thrashing around; I felt bad, but at least Malfoy woke him up." Draco could hear drawers in the bureau being opened and shut, but he kept his eyes closed.
"Whenever. All the time. I can't think of anything in particular that could cause it if it's happening pretty much constantly."
He wandered over to Bartholomew's cage, where the owl was roosting, with one eye open, watching Harry shrewdly.
Draco leaned back. "Come on, we've got to prep you." He pulled Harry back up and tugged his robes over his head. He stood for a moment with his hands digging into Harry's bare waist. "Oh Merlin, You just— I sometimes don't even know where to start with you; I just want to do everything to you all at once. Bloody hell you're fit—" He broke off with a moan when he saw Harry palming himself through his pants.
“I did not press her,” Dumbledore said. “The truth is, I learned I was the subject of Mr Malfoy’s assassination attempts quite some time ago, from a source I trust absolutely.”
“You like this,” Harry murmured, lips brushing the curve of Draco’s ear. He breathed out gently, making Draco shiver. “You like my weight on you, my hand on your cock. I’m going to make you come, just like this, and then I’m going to lay you out on your bed and
Oliver was the most vociferous. He flatly refused to leave Theo again. Harry couldn’t really blame him; he’d never shied away from a fight at his age, either. On the other hand, he also remembered just how little magic he’d really known, back then. And their wands were still missing. Still, Oliver couldn’t be dissuaded.
“Miss Granger,” Madam Primrose said, drawing her attention back to her. “You claim the defendant cast the Cruciatus Curse, and Malfoy went crashing through a window?”
. Something in him quietened. Had he seen this in the Mirror? He couldn’t remember. All he could remember, suddenly, was the Dark Lord’s threat. Maybe it was always supposed to be this way. Maybe he was always supposed to die at Greyback’s teeth.
Draco felt like he’d been hit in the chest with a Stunner. He told himself Potter didn’t mean it, couldn’t
Harry snorted. “S’pose its progress you’ve noticed she’s a girl, at least,” he muttered, turning his attention back to Shakespeare.
“Still dealing with the aftermath,” she said. “The Ravenclaws were not the only ones who surprised us today. Four of the Slytherins who attacked us today had pledged their allegiance to you.” Harry nodded, not particularly surprised by that. Spies and double-agents were the bread-and-butter of war. “But that’s not what I wanted to discuss with you. I wanted to offer my condolences for Hermione, and ask that the party tonight go ahead, in her honour.”
“The losing side,” Pansy said calmly, while her heart beat a sharp staccato against her ribcage. “You’re smarter than that, Blaise.” She smiled, using her teeth, edging it with a deliberate hint of danger. “Besides, I’m one of his Marked. Your mother has been unfortunately...
He would bet anything it had something to do with Malfoy. And he had a horrible, sinking feeling that the mark on his neck had something to do with Malfoy, too.
that was very dangerous. Draco could already feel he'd forgiven him entirely for abandoning him at breakfast, and for cuddling with Ron and Hermione instead of him. Dammit.
"Harry. You are so disgustingly happy with Draco it's ridiculous. Why are you trying to prevent the one thing that would finally make you happy? If I hadn't seen it myself, I'd never have believed you were capable of being such a light-hearted, smiling person. You've always been so weighed down and tired in the past, and
Draco straightened and pointed his wand at the flames, which lowered. He turned and jumped slightly when he saw Harry.
Pansy sighed. “I am not fool enough to believe I have any control over Draco’s heart. We can’t choose who we fall in love with.” She glanced across the room, to where Theo was buried in his Ancient Runes textbook. “You know that better than anyone.”
for him, and maybe – maybe he hadn’t been in his right mind to give consent to Draco claiming him, but maybe that was for the best. If he’d waited for after his heat, like Dumbledore had recommended… if he’d tried to choose without that feeling of right and wrong to guide him, without knowing what he knew now –
Harry lifted his head from Draco’s shoulder, looking down at him. His face was so full, of triumph and love and a deep, fierce possessiveness that had Draco shivering uncontrollably. He moved his fingers a little, and Draco realised they were in his arse, holding him open. The stretch was slightly uncomfortable, but it was insignificant compared to the feeling of being possessed, being held.
Pansy put a hand on his arm. “Will you wait for me here?” she asked, quietly. “This is something I have to do alone.”
“He’s right, you know,” Hermione said quickly, before Draco could unleash the full, terrifying bite of his scathing tongue on her boyfriend. “Harry has a higher pain threshold than you.” She frowned a little. “Or, at least, he’s better at coping with it. You were in a much,
“I’m not – this isn’t the same as you and Grindelwald,” Harry said, frustrated. “I’m sorry, sir, but it’s really not. Grindelwald was evil. Draco’s not. He’s just caught up on the wrong side of the war, trying his best to keep his family alive.”
Snape caught his arm and reeled him in, effectively halting his head-long dash away before he'd even taken a single step. “Don't be a fool, Potter. You think I would have brought you here if it put you or the Malfoys in danger? You think Draco would permit his parents to lay a
Draco opened his mouth, coaxing Harry’s tongue inside and sucking, stroking his hands over Harry’s shoulders and down his arms, claiming him. It was a kiss that said
“He doesn’t have to find out,” Harry interrupted. Pansy looked taken aback, and Harry felt hot shame curl in the pit of his stomach. “You don’t understand. He thinks we’re finally being honest with each other. I can’t lose him, Pansy. I
Pansy only realised she’d gotten separated from the others when she stopped seeing their spells. Occasionally, she saw a ghost. McGonagall had obviously summoned them from the castle to help. The Bloody Baron was hounding the vampires, screaming in their faces. Pansy saw one become so terrified that he turned himself into a bat and flew away. Peeves cackled, dropping Snargaluff pods on the Death Eaters from above.
Pansy glanced down at Draco. He was curled into himself, sobbing for breath. The pixies flew over to him, chattering anxiously as they patted his hair and shoulders.
“Me neither,” Dean sighed. “Maybe that’s it. Maybe she didn’t like how much I had to drink. What if I apologise? Tell her I’ll never touch another drop of alcohol as long as I live, if only she’ll forgive me and take me back –”
Harry whirled away, pulling off his outer robes in jerky motions and settling himself on the floor by Draco’s bed. Draco peered at him over the side, eyebrows raised.
ever again. But he’d promised himself he would allow Madam Rosmerta to take whatever retribution she desired for the wrong he’d dealt her. “I have a – connection, with Harry Potter,” he said, reluctantly. “A soul-bond. It means he can feel whenever I cast Dark magic. I don’t know whether he could feel the Imperius Curse I had on you, but if there was even the remotest possibility it might affect his ability to fight the Dark Lord, I couldn’t risk it.”
“And I have all three Deathly Hallows,” Pansy said, closing a hand around the stone in her pocket. A children’s morality tale, come to life. “I – can I –?”
. Forever. I’ve claimed you, and I cherish what’s mine. I will never hang you out to dry, never leave you wanting. You can ask anything of me, and if it’s in my power, I will give it to you. Understand? Now come here.”
Harry made a small, distressed noise. “No, you’re not. You promised, remember? You promised that if I did my best to survive this, so would you. I’m begging you, Draco. Let me protect you. Dumbledore needs me; he won’t say no, and you know he has the power and the resources to rescue your mother and protect you both. It’s time. Please say yes, sweetheart.
In the end, the duel between Draco and Travis Pickering lasted less than a minute. Harry retained just enough presence of mind to feed his magic through their bond, as Draco had in the final battle, and then Snape appeared around the corner, breathing heavily as if he’d chased Draco all the way from Ravenclaw tower. Together, Snape and Draco took the lust-crazed Pickering down with a few well-aimed, powerful curses that Harry could reluctantly (if distantly) appreciate.
Harry surged to his feet. A spell slammed into his shoulder. The world spun. He found himself on his back, Lavender’s face inches from his. Her eyes, open and staring, looked accusingly back at him.
There were several gasps from the stands, but not many. Apparently, Harry thought wryly, all it had taken to remove fear of Voldemort’s name had been to remove
“Sorry, Minister,” he said. “My point is this. Justin cast an Unforgiveable. In the end, it doesn’t really matter who he cast it on. It matters to me, of course. Draco’s my soulmate. He saved my life, and I couldn’t have defeated Voldemort without him. But I also couldn’t have done it without every single person who showed up to fight that day, Justin included. We have laws for a reason. The Cruciatus Curse is called unforgivable for a reason. I was wrong to use it on Bellatrix, and Justin was wrong to use it on Draco. The law says we should be punished, and if the Wizengamot thinks we should be, then I won’t fight it. But I think there has been too much suffering, too much grief, already.” He turned to Justin again, holding his gaze. “I forgive you.”
When he opened the door again, the bird was gone. He closed the door, and the second time he opened it (the passage from Borgin & Burkes to Hogwarts; the one that always,
inside him. Living off his soul, like cancer, or poison ivy, slowly strangling to death everything that was essentially Harry. Eating away his soul, piece by piece.
, Draco. Loved ones die, enemies deceive us, friends betray us. Crabbe made his choice. There’s nothing you could have done.”
Pansy took a deep, steadying breath, and let it out slowly. Then she knocked. Blaise’s voice called for her to enter, and she slipped through the door, closing it quietly behind her.
Harry shook his head, and turned to Hermione. She had been quietly doing her homework at a corner table, but she looked up at him now, a frown creasing her forehead. She didn’t look angry with him, though, just confused, and Harry took that to mean Ginny had come through on her end.
“The Snake Shield,” Draco said. “It eats magic. Any magic, including the Unforgivables. It’s rumoured to be what Dumbledore used, in the final moments of his battle with Grindelwald. You can cast it beforehand, which makes it incredibly useful. Especially at night, or when it’s so chaotic your opponent doesn’t see it. Apparently Dumbledore cast it just before Grindelwald cast the Killing Curse at him. Instead of dodging the Killing Curse, which would have cost him precious time and allowed Grindelwald to regroup, he stood his ground and cast a Stunner. Grindelwald was knocked out, and the Snake ate the curse that would have otherwise killed our esteemed Headmaster.”
“I don’t have to admit any such thing,” Ginny said. “Blaise is my boyfriend, not Dean. He lost his chance with me.”
Draco smiled at him. “Right,” he said, and pressed him down onto the blanket to kiss him. Millicent hooted, and Theo threw his boot at them.
“And then,” Professor McGonagall continued, sternly, “you were both out past curfew. Professor Snape and I waited in your respective common rooms until eleven o’clock last night, and there was no sign of either of you.”
“You created that sanctuary in my mind,” Harry reminded him. “That was pretty skilled work. And effective.”
call me Draco,” Malfoy said, stepping closer. His voice was oddly compelling, and Harry couldn't look away from his eyes, the stormy grey reaching into him and
“Maybe I’ll let you,” Harry murmured, rocking into Draco’s hips. Draco shuddered, knees weakening, his head dropping back against the wall. “Maybe I will,” Harry said, flicking his tongue around the rim of Draco’s ear, “but maybe – maybe I’ll do it my way. Maybe I’ll tie you down, suck you until you’re crying,
Hermione looked cheered by the idea. “I’d appreciate that,” she said. “I’ll let you into the common room at – say, six-thirty? That way, no one will be up yet to see you come in, and we can sneak you out afterwards using a Disillusionment Charm. I’m quite good at them now.”
!” The blood-clotting charm was one of the only Healing spells he knew, but it didn’t work. Pink, lumpy sausages spilled out under her fingers. Professor Burbage threw herself in front of them. George grabbed his mother under the shoulders, dragging her back towards the infirmary. He was off-balance, dizzy. But no fucking way was their mum going to die on his watch.
Harry sighed and tilted his hips up in relief, but Malfoy bracketed him in with his thighs, lying down on top of him and sliding his cock into Harry like he owned him. Like he
Snape’s lips twitched. “Indeed. And your Alpha would be well within his rights. Of course, if someone tried to tear you from his arms, he could prosecute. But trying to claim another’s claimed Omega behind his back – no one would even blink at murder.”
, Draco, this time. All of me. And you were going to tear us apart, permanently. If you refuse to mark me as yours when I’ve
He limped quickly over to his desk, figuring it was best if he didn't draw any more attention to his abnormal gait. He tried to sit and hissed in pain.
"So that's pretty much it," he said, as he finished catching her up to speed on his life and his relationship with Draco. "What about you? You have to 've been doing
"You can wear some of mine, we're close enough in size. I'm sure I have a t-shirt that can accommodate those arms of yours."
"Did I miss the 'volunteering injury' stage of courtship? I could've sworn I'd studied the subject extensively." Draco smiled. Harry was...well he was certainly
He flipped through for a while. “I'm not sure if it's even in here. Wait— it looks pretty similar to this one, maybe from a different angle. And the colours are different."
He got up, and opened the door a bit apprehensively, unsure as to who would be knocking at his door. The only people who knew where he lived would surely firecall.
If the reporter had really wanted to write an article about Harry being mentally unwell, they could surely dig up
Draco nodded and grabbed a handful of Floo powder from Harry's mantel before throwing it into the fire. "3F Gloswell place!" He stepped in and was whirled away, leaving Harry to his thoughts.
Harry patted her arm. "They're not going to think you're a crazy, clingy girlfriend. Come on, since when has Luna ever been judgemental? And I'll admit I didn't know Cho very well, but she was a very nice person from what I can remember. I don't think a little clarification is going to ruin everything at all; it seems more likely that continuing with everybody not knowing if they're on the same page will end up causing problems."
"You haven't changed in a bad way, no, and you're still definitely Harry, you're just, well...I'm not sure how to put it. I guess I didn't even know you could smile that big. Even at the Quidditch World Cup you didn't look like this. I'm not exactly concerned, but I'm wondering if I maybe should be."
"Of course it's fine. Why wouldn't it be?" He beckoned her in, and Draco straightened up uncomfortably on the desk under the girl's scrutiny.
The bird gave him a rather hard disapproving look and hopped around to face away. It pushed off from the window sill, pooped, and then flew off at top speed.
He set a plate on the table under a warming charm for Draco, and brought his with him to sit in front of the fire. All he needed to do was
"What do you mean it doesn't make any sense? I've been in love with you for ages — I don't know why I got into this whole...thing," he gestured between them, "thinking this
"You didn't want to look at any of the books?" Harry shook his head at Draco's question. He'd been plenty amused with watching Draco's ridiculous expressions as he'd looked at the books, plus he'd been approached by a few more fans.
The bell over the door chimed as he stepped into the dim shop, and the attendant behind the counter looked up from his mobile briefly, before going right back to texting.
The house was, as usual, crowded and overflowing with foodstuffs. Draco quickly charmed Molly by complimenting her food, and eventually enough food and alcohol was consumed that the atmosphere lightened up.
who's not gonna be there today and tomorrow. And I just— I already miss them, and I'm afraid I'm jumping in too much too fast. I already love them so much, but I'm just afraid that they see it as more of a casual thing, and I'm afraid to try to have a talk about it because I don't wanna be that crazy clingy girlfriend.
a shoulder to lean on — had never had the occasion to know before — but it had its own sort of warmth and comfort to it, knowing you could help support someone you loved.
"Oh good! I thought you went ahead without me too," Ron bounded up to Hermione, then noticed Harry and gave him an uncertain smile.
. Sure, healing might be a process, but really what was the point if he didn't know if any of Hermione's suggestions would work at all? He'd have to drag it out for a long time because she'd say it works slowly, and he'd have to be so uncomfortable throughout all of it because he couldn't just do what he
For a moment, he wondered if maybe if he just ignored it, it would go away — but a quick time-checking charm told him it must be important for someone to wake him at two in the morning. Probably Minerva, since she was the only one who knew where his rooms were, as far as he knew.
Perhaps an hour before Harry was due to leave from work, he looked up from his papers to see that Hermione had kindly let herself into his office.
"I know, I know. I just wish...that things had been different. I mean that was kinda my life plan. Get married to Ginny, become an Auror, have a big family. I guess I didn't really think about..."
Harry heard Draco snort and snap another book shut. He gritted his teeth and answered politely. "No," he cleared his throat uncomfortably. "I'm afraid I'm, er, off the market."
Figuring out how to make some Muggle appliances work with magic was truly life-changing; it took much less work to fill and turn on a coffee maker than to deal with magicking on a stove and dealing with a kettle and press and all that nonsense. For that, he would need to actually get up and do it by hand or use a wand, and a wand meant going back to his room, because he inevitably left it there every morning. He had encountered this problem every morning for
Molly and Arthur were predictably weepy, and immediately claimed Ron and Hermione’s attention as everybody found their places at the tables.
"See you tomorrow morning." Harry waved and let himself out of the shop, Apparating back to Draco's apartment with a sigh.
It was true they were hardly seen outside Hogwarts or their own home, but it was still funny to them that after so long, nobody else knew. And the students had picked up on it so quickly. Harry shook his head, thinking that some of the students he'd had would've been great reporters, for all the snooping they'd done.
"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked that. That's personal." There was a long pause before he continued. "Did you get anyone telling you what an amazing teacher you are today?"
Zylphia laughed. "Oh please, you know I'm not lying — if anything you're the one lying to yourself. You need some more confidence, you do."
"S'okay," Harry murmured, kissing down the side of his face and neck until he reached a small inked tide pool just under his collarbone, teeming with fishes and an eel and sea urchins, and even a miniature seahorse.
Eventually, he decided that a nice eagle feather quill would always be a safe bet, and he simply added some chocolate for Draco.
When classes began again, it was a welcome change. As nice as it was to have nothing to do, it could get pretty boring when Harry had
When Harry got back to Grimmauld place, he sat down and thought about what had happened the day before.
"Hmm. Well I'd mainly need you to sort the wares and package them. My last assistant left with hardly a warning, and I haven't got the steady hands for it." Her left hand spasmed slightly, as if to emphasise the point. "I'd be handling the front and you'd be doing the chopping and such."
Harry’s vision was going blurry around the edges. He struggled to push himself up, but he felt dizzy, weak. Ron jostled his shoulder, and he screamed.
“Weigh the costs against the benefits,” Draco said, slowly. “Easier to date him than deal with his relentless pursuit.”
Hermione reminded him about his appointment with McGonagall, and he nodded, taking the stairs two at a time up to the boys’ dormitory. As soon as he was out of sight, she turned to Ron, grabbing his hand and squeezing proudly. “That was incredible, Ronald,” she said, earnestly. “I didn’t realise you had so much insight into the minds of Slytherins.”
The Dark Lord was displeased, and Draco’s life was now forfeit along with his mother’s, if he failed.
Harry jostled him with his shoulder. “Just because the Wild Magic gives you a gift, doesn’t mean you have to use it.”
Dumbledore shook his head. “I’m afraid not, Miss Granger. Even a preliminary Alpha-Omega bond is very powerful. It would prevent such interference.”
“In a way, yes,” Harry acknowledged. He looked at Draco contemplatively. “Did you know he’s never heard the end of the prophecy? That’s why he tricked me into going there to get it, and sent your father to take it from me. Not because he didn’t want me to hear it, but because he’s terrified of how it ends.”
"You know I cannot bear to be parted from you, milaya — and even less so when I know you are in pain," they said, bending down to drop a kiss on her lips.
"Isn't it? I'm just supposed to miraculously grow out of it? Look, I'm glad you and George found Hermione and Angelina, but — if you hadn't noticed —
Neville, who had stepped up and taken the brunt of many punishments — must have incomparably more. But of course, Harry knew he only ever thought about himself, only ever assumed
Harry's face covered the entirety of the book cover, and he cringed when he saw it. "Oh, er, sure I guess. Have you got something to write with?"
The other students all immediately focused their attention on his left hand and began to chatter excitedly.
Thinking things were best not left to chance, he simply reached for the container of curry, opened it, and placed it in front of the owl. He had known he was right to be wary. Hopefully it left some for him — and also that he wouldn't contract some strange disease from eating after a carnivorous bird.
Harry found himself smiling, and clapped along with everyone else. He hadn’t ever really understood before why some people cried at weddings, but he felt a little teary-eyed just now.
He really tried to keep a lid on his temper most of the time, but Merlin's tits everybody was really testing him today.
He quickly decided he had better go to St. Mungo's, because alone with his incoherent thoughts was not something Harry wanted to be right now.
that he was dead, but he certainly hadn't been broken up about it when he'd heard that Lucius had died in Azkaban.
"Don't ask me," Harry said, taking off his glasses and waving them away onto the nightstand. "Give me your wand, you're going to break it sleeping with it."
When he reached the portrait of the Fat Lady, he realised he had no idea what the password was. He heaved a put-upon sigh and sank down against the wall to sit in wait. Bored seemed to be his default state now anyway, so he didn't much mind waiting anymore. Waiting was just like anything else. Boring.
"Let me know if I can help at all, or if you just want another person to try talking to him," Neville offered.
, learn some bloody control! This is why I don't tell you things." The boxes continued to shake. "If so much as
She nodded once, and turned back to the front of the shop, leaving Harry to follow uncertainly behind.
"Guys? What's up? It's been like two weeks and none of you guys really participate anymore. Is it my classes? Have they gotten boring or something? I can change things to make them more interesting if that would help."
“I now pronounce you husband and wife,” the officator intoned, waving his wand over the heads of the couple with a small trail of sparks. Hermione threw her arms around Ron and kissed him — although they were both smiling too big to manage it properly.
so. They were saying goodbye to the last of the students that had been at Hogwarts for their first year of teaching.
"Chill mate, that's not that big a deal. I know you don't usually, but that's actually normally how it goes."
They both dozed off on the floor, only waking from the cold to move into their bed some hours later. And if they ached a bit the next day, well, nobody had to know
"I also never thought I'd say I missed being able to cross reference the book of the Sacred Twenty-Eight," Draco grumbled, still pacing the room. "Even
, and if not for things completely out of his control, he might not have been in the position to do anything at all. It all came down to a simple choice. Even disregarding that, it wasn't like anyone else couldn't have done it.
"Hmm. Well, if you don't mind, please ask Draco if he's planning to come over for New Years as usual. We didn't know if you two had plans or something, and he's ignoring Rodya's owls still. Tell him to stop being rude whilst you're at it, too — they're beginning to get hurt, and I'm
Somebody made fan art! I repeat! Someone made fan art! Of this chapter! And it's fantastic! Three and a half years and this book finally got fan art! I am beyond thrilled!!!!!
“No, I don’t,” Snape said dryly. “My inclinations run the other way, if you remember, Potter.” Harry snapped a look up at him guiltily. Even after all this time, he couldn't wrap his head around the idea that Snape and his
you.” Parkinson looked stricken, but Blaise just rolled his eyes and began to draw her away. “Take me instead!” Seamus blurted.
Seamus bristled, and his Irish brogue thickened until it was almost unintelligible. “I would never ask her for more than she was willing to give – freely! If that makes me pitiful, so be it.
without thinking. It was so powerful that it not only doused the flames, but froze Umbridge where she stood. He dashed to his mother’s side. “Mum!” he cried, catching her before she could fall. “Mum, are you okay?!”
. None of that changed the way I feel about you. If anything, it made me love you more.” He remembered the way Draco had cried, when Harry had refused to let him help dig that tiny grave, and shook his head. “It did make me love you more.”
Draco used simple spells, like one of the Unspeakables had suggested. He was already tired, and this was not a battle that would be over in mere minutes. If they had any chance of survival, they had to ration their strength.
Harry whirled, feet almost skidding out from under him. But Dolohov didn’t reappear. Others took his place instead. Dozens of vampires, in heavy, sun-proof cloaks. Harry fought grimly, concentrating on disarming as many as he could. People could be revived from Stunners, curses removed, but very few could fight without a wand.
Dumbledore’s bushy eyebrows rose. “My dear boy. You’re saying this accidental Apparition is not the first thing that has happened?”
“You don’t believe that,” Daphne said, staring at her in surprise. “You really believe Potter can outsmart Draco. Are you mad?”
Harry turned as two Aurors came through the door; Dawlish and another one. Draco was between them, arms bound cruelly behind his back, his face drawn and scared. Harry stiffened. They weren’t being gentle, pulling Draco to the centre of the room just slightly too fast, dragging him off his feet. They shoved him to his knees in front of the stone statue, and the little grunt of pain he made was the last straw.
"Not funny." But Harry had caught the muffled snort of laughter against his neck. What a rotten liar.
"Oh come on, don't get mad," Harry said, still laughing, as Draco leaned back in a huff. He reached up to pull Draco's head back down, and pressed a kiss to his jaw. "I'm just taking the piss. I love you."
Harry sat silently waiting for him to finish. Really, Draco massively overestimated Harry's cunning.
Draco did as he was told, and Harry took the glass back, turning back to the sink and starting to wash it by hand.
"Harry!" Draco called, even louder, with more forced cheer. "Harry, my love, my dearest darling, light of my life!"
Once in the bedroom, Draco pushed Harry back onto the bed and climbed on top of him, positively snogging the sense out of him.
They didn't chat for very long before Ginny was back in the sitting room like a redheaded tornado, still munching on a biscuit. She hugged Percy, and then headed over to him.
Slowly, everybody's attention returned to their own gifts and conversations, and Draco let out a breath.
"Oh good, there will be at least one other person with me at the Christmas feast," Harry said distractedly as he tried to finish reading the paragraph he was on.
As Draco got nearer, he saw the man was dancing on a woman. No matter, it didn't seem like they'd come together, it shouldn't be to hard to break in. He danced closer and lightly placed his hands on the guy's hips from behind, making him turn around in surprise. He leaned forward to speak in Draco's ear.
be there. They make me feel better in a way, because I feel like I'm fixing things a little bit, and making things more even — but it's just so
He herded the excited eight-year-old into the kitchen with the promise of baking sweets. Andromeda might be angry for them making a mess, but Harry thought it was worth it if it got them to stop with the fantasy games.
Harry resumed with enthusiasm. He wanted to make Draco cum this way — there was just something so alluring about the idea of bringing Draco off so thoroughly. Draco was clearly enjoying this
"Just tired," he responded automatically, before biting his tongue. Shite, he hadn't meant it to sound like that.
She squeezed his hand. "Good. And third of all...that's a bit of a flimsy excuse even for you. It isn't as if you cared much about not getting laid since you broke up with Ginny — or
Finally satisfied he wouldn't be recognised as himself or any of the other guises he'd taken on, he left. He didn't like to repeat looks very much — it turned out people didn't take it so well when you weren't interested in a second one night stand. Harry thought that rather defeated the purpose of it being
Harry thought that maybe some things could be brilliant just being whatever they were. Maybe it didn't matter what it was called or how it happened. Maybe it could just be paradise.
that they're not returning," her tone softened. "I understand, Ron understands, and I know that different people deal with things differently, but it's been awhile Harry and you're not even beginning to try to get better. It's not healthy to be so closed off all of the time. You've got to start trying to branch out again or you're never going to get back to normal."
He found himself unable to control his hands as they roved Draco's body, clutching and stroking, sliding under the light robes to grasp at more skin. For all that Harry's hands were roving, Draco's certainly weren't any better. He gave Harry's mouth a rest, only to move to his jaw, and his fingertips brushed the inside of Harry's thigh.
Harry complied, and Draco kissed him deeply, rolling them so that they faced each other on their sides.
