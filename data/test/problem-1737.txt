Draco grumbled, pushing the broom behind his back. “I was going out for a walk. I am sick of being cocooned in the pighole. Surely you wouldn't have a problem with that, Potter, or are you planning on keeping me locked in this house for the rest of my life.”
room. So deal with it, and just go back to sleep," Harry mumbled while crawling onto the bed, only to be kicked back down.
"If you aren't going to answer my question then just leave, Potter! I do not need to be blessed with your oh so holy presence!" Draco snarled.
Draco flushed a little at hearing his name, and glared. "Nice to hear that out of the man that almost
He let his head drop, and stilled. It was a form of respect. A farewell. Draco didn’t know whether she was dead yet or not. Maybe she was still alive, hidden in a far away place that the unfortunates couldn’t reach. Maybe she’s dead. Or maybe she’d waiting...for them. For someone to save her, as her screams would be drowned in the hide of the unfortunates. Barely clinging on to life, as they would rip their teeth through her flesh, and she would scream. Scream and scream, begging for Draco and Blaise. Promising to be better, to never go out late again, to never lie to her parents. To be good, and listen.
The days after Christmas showed a more active Draco. He started to rise from bed before noon and even agreed to go to the new year's party organised by Blaise and Ginny. Harry began to believe that perhaps Ron was right, and all Draco needed was some time to heal. But seeing him now, alone on a lounge chair, his eyes blank, ignoring everyone around him, clearly not enjoying himself, Harry isn’t so sure anymore.
“I know,” Harry answers. He looks away, and Draco knows he’s scared. Healer Burke is aware of Draco’s past, and still, she prescribed the stupid things. It only means today is going to be hell for Draco, and for Harry, who will have to watch helplessly.
Malfoy rolls his eyes. Harry laughs at him. He knows it’s strange. That in most families, not everyone takes the time to learn BSL when someone becomes deaf. Harry doesn’t get that. He loves that his uncle can be an active part of their family.
I was inside a very long, dimly lit chamber. Stone pillars entwined with more carved serpents rose to support a ceiling lost in darkness, casting long, black shadows through the odd, greenish gloom that filled the place. It was eerily silent and a chill went over my body. I pulled out my wand and started moving forward between the serpentine columns. My footstep echoed loudly and I was sure I wouldn’t surprise anyone. They would know I was coming, so I kept my eyes narrowed, ready to clamp them shut at the smallest sign of movement.
Nathan lets go of the table and takes a wobbly step towards Lily. Harry shakes his head. Ever since that little man discovered how to walk a couple of days ago, he wants to do nothing else. Harry doesn’t know how many bruises he’s already spelt away, as Nathan’s endeavours have more chance of failing than succeeding, ending with Nathan on the floor with tears in his eyes. But it doesn’t stop him from trying again. And crawling is no longer an acceptable means to get from one point to the other. Sometimes Harry wished that Narcissa would still talk to them, he’s dying to know if Draco was the same when he was little. Harry can see it, a younger Draco struggling to stay upright, but determined to make it to his destination without falling.
But surely James would have told them. It’s important information to catch Pettigrew. But they still haven’t. And now Harry keeps dreaming about the man. He sees him over and over again in his sleep. And he’s always too late to stop him from killing the others.
Draco stops in front of the picture of Lupin and Tonks. Teddy puts his small hand next to them and smiles at them. “Hi, mom and dad. I’m going to be a big brother,” he tells the picture. “Can’t stay, uncle Harry is making grilled cheese sandwishes.”
Thanks for all the Kudos and comments! I just saw that I have a hundred kudos on this story already and I just love it, so thanks everyone for reading, leaving kudos and commenting.
Harry grabs one of Neville’s arms and tries to pull him back towards the benches. Neville holds his ground and tries to get free.
You wouldn’t believe the relief that washed over me when Draco knelt beside me and took me in his arms. I grabbed his hand and won’t let go of him. I didn’t know how to speak, to tell him how sorry I was for almost leaving him forever. I won’t repeat everything he already told you yesterday. Just know that I was shaken and scared, but also happy to be back with the people I love. Sirius and Draco made sure I got to the hospital wing. The supposed Professor Moody was with us. He questioned me. When Sirius and Draco both fell asleep, I knew something was wrong. And then Professor Moody called Voldemort the Dark Lord. And I remembered that Voldemort had said he had a spy at Hogwarts, one that had put my name in the goblet of fire.
Malfoy also makes fun of me every morning when I don’t receive any mail, reminding me that I don’t have any friends or family that care about me. He receives daily packages from his home with sweets and other treats that he shares with the others, except me of course, because I’ve not earned them.
Andromeda holds a cup of tea in front of Draco. Draco stares at it and shakes his head. He doesn’t think he can drink anything right now.
Today we had our second flying lesson and I finally made it into the sky. When I kicked off and was floating in the sky, only a meter from the ground I knew I was going to love this. We aren’t allowed to go any higher yet, but I can’t wait to feel the air rush through my hair when I’m allowed to fly more. I’m sure I’ll be smiling just like Malfoy had when he was racing through the sky. It all feels so natural to be on a broom, to hover above the ground. I don’t think I need to get taught how to fly, it’s easy and wonderful. And maybe I’ll be able to prove myself to the other boy’s when I’m finally good at something. Maybe it will make them treat me as a person worthy of their time.
Harry sinks to the floor, and Draco just stares at him while he cries. “I want to stay but I can’t, not if you won’t get help and try to beat this demon that has taken over our life,” Harry sobs. “I can’t watch you fade away. It hurts too much. I love you so much, but I can’t help you. I can’t do this on my own. I’ve tried, but I can’t. I’m sorry, I can’t.”
I promise I will write again soon and I’m sure everything will be better by than. It has to be. I hate school like this. I hate my life if it’s always going to be like this.
Harry walks into the kitchen to get breakfast started. He takes out the frying pan and a bowl to mix the batter. He looks back into the living room. Teddy is still on the floor playing with his new Duplo. Draco has moved to the sofa. He's got his book in front of him, but it doesn't look like he's reading. His finger scratches over his forearm again. Harry wonders if Draco is aware of it when he does it. Or if it's so familiar for him now that he doesn't notice anymore. Not like Harry, who sees it all the time. Just like how he noticed that Draco ignores his friend's messages, skips days at work and spends most of his free time in bed, no matter how hard Draco tries to hide it from him.
Except for the boy that refused to be his friend. The famous Harry Potter. Draco took out his frustration of missing the dead of all those silly Muggles out on him. He did everything in his power to make Potter’s life more difficult. It was fun to fight with Potter. His temper reminded Draco of how his father would get when a potion hadn’t turned out the way he wanted. The only annoying part was that Potter somehow always got away with his behaviour. So at night, Draco dreamed of Potter in the cell at the Manor, screaming in pain from a deadly potion for days before he would die.
“We can visit again later,” Neville says. He lays his arms around her shoulders. “Let’s let Harry get some rest.”
Harry shakes his head. “They would never,” he says. He looks at Neville and wonders if he still worries. They’ve faced Voldemort twice now in the two years they’ve been at Hogwarts. And it’s clear the man still wants Neville dead. Pettigrew used to be part of his crew. And he’s already been spotted in Hogsmeade once. It’s a miracle they even were allowed to go out to Hogsmeade. Harry wouldn’t have been surprised if their parents would have stopped them for the fear that something might happen to him or Neville.
“We’re really sorry, Harry,” Ron says. “I should have been more careful with my words around my mother.”
“Very careful,” Lily says as Nathan lifts his hand to place it next to his sister. “We don’t want to wake daddy.” Lily takes Nathan’s arm and makes sure the little boy doesn’t smash it onto Draco’s belly. They stand for a second and then Nathan giggles.
Harry shakes his head and walks out of the room. He takes the stairs and makes it to the beach. There is only one other person out this early. A young woman walks with a baby in her arms up and down the coast. Harry stares at her. His chest aches and his vision blurs as tears start to form. Fuck, he thought he was doing better. At least Draco isn’t here to see it. He needs Harry to be strong for both of them, keep them standing in the middle of this shit storm.
Harry smiles at Ron as he loads up his plate with all the food that has just appeared. He knew he could count on his best friend. Ron understands. Last year it was his little sister that almost died. Ginny looks better now. She smiles again and seems to be happy to be back at Hogwarts. She even talks to Neville now. Harry had thought her crush would only intensify now Neville’s saved her from Tom Riddle and the Basilisk. But the opposite seems to have happened. Somehow, she doesn’t worship Neville anymore. And that is a good thing. As Neville is just a normal boy, just like the rest of them.
“Fuck, no. Off course not. It’s the opposite. Our friendship means everything. You mean everything. Because, somehow, I’ve fallen in love with you. And I just wanted to know, if you maybe would like to go on a date with me sometime, to see if you could love me too.”
Harry places one of his hands next to the small once of his kids. Nathan wobbles a little, and Harry places his other arm around Nathan’s waist to make sure the boy doesn’t fall.
“Just a pregnancy test,” Draco says after he opens his eyes again. He would hate it if he would miss Harry’s reaction to his statement. The way his eyes start to twinkle and his mouth turns into a massive grin.
But first, he needs to finish this Potions essay while Draco is still around. Harry looks in his book again and reads the passage about Chizpurfle carapace. He doesn’t get why it’s so hard to open them and the way you should handle them, so Harry pats Draco on his shoulder. Draco looks up from his parchment and signs: “What’s wrong?”
‘We’ve been over this a million times. Start REMEMBERING!’ Draco writes. ‘You need to feed them to a Venomous Tentacula. You lure the Chizpurfles to the plant with the Lumos Duo Charm. This works because the Chizpurfles are attracted to magic. Then you wait for the plant to eat the Chizpurfle. It will spit out the carapace when it’s done.’
The final was a big deal this year. Slytherin had lost the cup against Gryffindor in my first year and last year the cup had been cancelled. And with me and Draco on the team, the entire house was convinced we could win. Tensions in the school were at a breaking point. Ron, Neville, Seamus and Dean stopped interacting with us because it ended up in heated words about which team was better every time. And other students also had scuffles in the corridors. A fourth-year Gryffindor and a sixth year Slytherin even ended up in the hospital wing with leeks sprouting out of their ears.
“Sorry, daddy,” Teddy grovels. “But are you okay? You look very pale.” Teddy moves further into the room and closes the door behind him. The bed dips as the boy sits down next to Draco and puts his hand on Draco’s forehead. “You don’t feel warm,” he informs Draco.
When I came home from school, Sirius told me more about him and Professor Lupin. I didn’t ask him about it when he was still at the school, but I had been wondering. It turns out that they started dating in fourth year and had been together until Sirius was sent to Azkaban. I think Sirius still loves Professor Lupin or Moony as he calls him. But they are not together now. Sirius says that too much has happened since then, that they are both different men than they were before you died. They are still friends and maybe one day they can find the love they once had again. But for now, I just think it’s sad to see how much Sirius misses Professor Lupin. He was really upset when he heard that Professor Lupin had resigned because word had spread that he is a werewolf. Went on and on about how unfair it is. I feel the same, Professor Lupin was the best Defence Against the Dark Arts professor we’ve ever had. Even though we didn’t always see eye to eye, and he really screwed up with the Boggart lesson, but he tried his best after that to make sure nothing like that ever happened again. Draco even feels a little sad to see him go, and that is saying something.
Harry was rushed to St. Mungo’s after the accident. He’d survived the fall. He had still been alive, is still alive now. The world seems to balance between hope and desperation. Draco wonders if he should come clean. What if Harry pulls through? Draco wants to be by Harry’s side when he wakes up. On one side Draco is ready to let the world know he’d switched sides in this coming war. He is done being the person his father wants him to be. And with Harry by his side, Draco will be able to do it. But what if Harry still dies? Draco will have given himself away. He will be stuck on the losing side of the war. Not that he cares. Dead will be a relief, a better alternative than moving on without Harry. If only Draco could be sure that his mother would be safe. She is the only one he still has. The only other person worth saving.
Harry stares at the door, not sure what he should do. He wants to follow them, to make sure that Draco is okay. And to keep Uncle Sirius in check. Harry knows how he can be. He might spill all of Harry’s secrets.
On Friday morning Hedwig brought me a letter from Hagrid, asking me if I wanted to come over for tea after my lessons. It was something to look forward to because I first had to survive a double lesson in Potions. And since professor Snape wants me to work with Malfoy its hell. We had to make the potion to cure boils. Snape swept around in his long black cloak, watching how we weighed dried nettles and crushed snake fangs. He criticized everyone except Malfoy. He got a lot of compliments about his work. He made it sound like Malfoy did it all by himself and that I didn’t help him at all. And maybe he is a bit right there because Malfoy kept pushing me out of the way, telling me that I will just screw it up. And when Snape was about to tell the class how good Malfoy was stewing his horned slugs the room got filled with clouds of acid green smoke. The fatty boy that was Ron’s new friend had managed to melt his cauldron into a twisted blob and their potion was seeping across the floor. Everyone jumped onto their stools while the other boy moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs. Snape got angry and told Ron to take Longbottom to the hospital wing. Then he rounded on Hermione who was working behind them and asked her why she didn’t tell Longbottom not to add the quills and took points of Gryffindor.
Harry doesn’t care what his friends think. Draco hates him. Draco never wants to talk to him again. They won’t be friends anymore. Harry ruined it all.
Oh, and my problem with my therapy being at the same time as Quidditch practise has been resolved. Professor Snape made it so that I can go to therapy in my free period on Wednesday when Draco has Ancient Ruins. It’s perfect like this, it means we still have plenty of time to do our homework together, sneak off to kiss and make all the practice. It’s really fun to be on the team. Marcus keeps yelling at us to stop being two sick lovebirds and pay attention. But I can’t help it, Draco is really sexy when he’s up on a broom. I’m just glad the entire team agrees that I’m a natural as a seeker. They didn’t even have try-outs for the position, just gave it to me. Marcus said that he had promised Terence. Who had promised him that Marcus would get his win this year if he did.
Harry just stares at Draco who tries hard not to look at any of them. He must feel bad that this is another thing he can’t do. Harry doesn’t want to think about how that class would have gone for Draco. How the others would have made fun of him, stuck on the ground. Why didn’t anyone realise something was wrong when Draco couldn’t even get his broom to fly for him?
Draco nods in confirmation. Harry’s arms slide around Draco’s waist, and he rests his head on Draco’s back. “It’s okay to be sad,” Harry says.
I don’t know what happened to Aunt Marge after that, I ran out of the room towards the cupboard under the stairs. The door burst open before I reached it. I think I did that too with my magic. I took my trunk out of the cupboard and then raced upstairs to grab the pillowcase with my books, letters and birthday cards. I sprinted back down and placed the pillowcase in my trunk. At that moment Uncle Vernon came into the hallway and ordered me to come back and put her right. I don’t know why, but I wanted to hurt Uncle Vernon at that moment. I grabbed my wand and pointed it at him. For a couple of seconds, I wanted to jinx him, to hurt him and punish him like he used to punish me. And then I thought of Draco and how disappointed he would be if I wouldn’t show up at school because I was in jail. And I thought of you, knowing you wouldn’t want me to hurt anyone. So I just opened the door behind me and left without saying a word.
They try again, with the same disappointing result. The broom crashes to the ground, over and over again. Draco’s shoulders start to slump and after the seventh attempt, Draco kicks the broom away. There are tears in his eyes. Harry wants to hug Draco and tell him it will all be okay, that he will fly today. But that’s not what friends do, so he keeps his distance. It’s time to try the next option.
Harry reaches out and takes Neville’s hand in his. “Nobody does,” he says. Not compared to what must be going through Neville’s mind when he thinks of Pettigrew. That man cost him his parents. That is nothing compared to the bother the girlish squad gives them. Harry is sick of them anyway. They always try to hit on him. Don’t they get that he’s never going to like them? Who would want to date a girl anyway? They are only trouble. Just see how difficult Hermione can be from time to time. And she’s the most normal girl Harry knows.
“We have food. I need to go now. See you tomorrow.” Harry finishes the call, and the kitchen goes silent. Draco lifts his head to look at the fireplace. Harry sits in front of it; his cheeks are wet from the tears. His hands pull at his hair, making it a bigger mess than usual.
In the end, it was Ron’s Niffler that had gotten the most coins and he won a large slab of Honeyduke’s chocolate. He shared the chocolate with Hermione after class. They were being all cosy and cute. No fighting or bickering at each other. And later Hermione told me that is when they got back together. It’s nice that they are a couple again. Now we just need to find a date for Neville (Luna thinks Dean would be perfect for him if he would just realise that I’m out of his reach for eternity) and Millicent and we’d all be paired up. Nobody joked about them getting together, even though they haven’t come out officially, we all know that they are both gay. Some other students do think they are a couple too, just because they are the only two single people in our group of friends.
The Saturday after that, Hermione, Draco, Nott and I had our detention. We had to meet Mr Filch in the entrance hall at eleven o’clock at night. Filch led us outside and started bragging that we’ll think twice about breaking school rules again and that it was a pity they let the old punishments die out, like hanging you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days. None of us said a word while Filch led us towards Hagrid’s hut. Hagrid shouted to Filch to hurry up and I was happy that we were serving detention with Hagrid.
Draco’s father started to complain about headmaster Dumbledore first, saying it was scandalous that he had forced the other governors to sign for his reinstatement before he demanded an explanation about what had happened since Draco refused to tell him anything. He wanted to know who had been responsible for all the attacks this year. Professor Snape said it had been the Dark Lord, acting through somebody else, by means of a diary. Professor showed the destroyed diary to Draco’s father. When he did that Dobby started to point at the diary, then at Draco’s father and then he would hit himself on the head with his fist to punish himself.
I also found out it had been the headmaster that had sent me the invisibility cloak. He said you used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food, dad. I wish I knew the way to the kitchen. I’m sure Ron and Neville will be delighted to get snacks more often. Oh, and it seems that professor Snape hates me because you saved his life once. The headmaster didn’t elaborate, but I wish I will one day find out what it is you saved him from.
Harry sobs into his knees. “Don’t die,” he says to the empty air. “I don’t mind if you never talk to me again, but please don’t die.” The idea alone is terrifying. A world without Draco is a world not worth living in.
“I did it,” he signs. He looks around at Neville and then back to Harry. His mouth opens and closes.
I know it was only yesterday that I wrote to you, but I really need to tell you what happened last night after I went to find Draco. So much has changed in so little time, I don’t even know where to start. Draco is looking over my shoulder and says I should just start at the beginning, with me finding him and Hermione in the Entrance Hall, so I’m going to do just that.
We had a little moment and for the first time, I understood why Professor Snape has so mixed feelings about me all the time. He’s worried about me, and about Draco, but sometimes I know he wishes I was in a different house so he can duck more points of me, or treat me like he does with Neville from time to time. I think it’s because I look so much like someone he used to hate.
“Is he dead?” Draco asks in a whisper. His hands tremble. He needs to know the answer. And at the same time, he doesn’t want to hear it. When Granger says it out loud, it will be real. Harry will be gone for good. All hope for a happy end will be scattered and Draco will know that he’s responsible for destroying the world they know. And for killing the person he loves.
When Harry reaches the library, he slows down. He wants to run towards the back. But he knows he has to walk at an acceptable pace if he doesn’t want Mrs Prince to kick him out as soon as he enters. And Harry needs to talk to Malfoy, clear up the mess he just made by going to Uncle Remus without Malfoy’s consent. Not that Harry regrets it, because if Uncle Remus is right, then Malfoy might be able to finally cast some proper spells.
Neville and Luna sit together in a corner, Dean stands next to them, waving his hands around while he talks. Blaise, Ginny, Pansy and Greg dance on the impromptu dance floor. Blaise his hands are on Ginny’s hips, and Draco can’t help but smile. His friend had circled around that girl for years, afraid he wouldn’t be good enough for the famous Quidditch star. Until a couple of months ago, when Harry had let slip that the pining was mutual, and Blaise had finally ask Ginny out on a date.
And it started all of great. Professor Snape was also there to help Professor Lockhart give a demonstration. Professor Lockhart said that we didn’t have to worry, that we would still have our Potions master before he was through with him. And I wondered why Professor Lockhart was still smiling; if Professor Snape had been looking at me like that I’d be running as fast as I could in the opposite direction. And maybe Professor Lockhart should have because Professor Snape made him fly backwards with just a simple Disarming Charm. I thought it was funny and I clapped for my head of house. Hermione was all worried about her precious Professor Lockhart; she still thinks he’s amazing. I think it’s the smiles and the hair. If I hadn’t been so hung on Draco, I might have felt the same.
It’s the Easter holidays now and I have to choose my subjects for the third year. I’m sure Hermione would take it all very seriously. If she was here she would be saying things like: ‘It could affect our whole future’. I just don’t know what to choose. I have no idea what I want to do with my future, only a few weeks ago I didn’t even want to have a future. I told Miss Davis that. She asks me if I feel guilty about thinking like that and I kind of do. I almost left Hermione and Draco behind. I was so stupid. I promise I’ll never do anything like that again. I want to live now. I know it’s still hard, but I’m not alone anymore. Draco is helping me pick out my subjects. He already knows what he wants to do. He’s taking Divination and Ancient Ruins. I told him I could just take the same subjects as him, but he told me that was the worst way to choose subjects. And he’s right of course, but I kind of like the idea of sharing all my classes with him. It’s nice to sit next to him again in class. My potion work has already improved and Professor Snape looks happy about the fact that we are working together again. He’s been keeping an eye on me a lot lately. I can’t blame him, what I did was stupid.
When dinner was finished, Draco and I headed back to our dormitory, only to be stopped by Professor Snape. He wanted to explain that he just wants to make sure that I’ll be safe. There is a change that the broom came from Black and that its sole purpose is to kill me. And I understand that it’s all about my safety. But for only a little hour I was the owner of a real Firebolt, the best broom there is at the moment, and I didn’t even get to fly it. I’m sure there is nothing wrong with it now, but who knows what it will be like after they subjected it to all sorts of anti-jinx tests?
Neville manoeuvres around Harry and takes a hold of one of Malfoy’s arms. “Get off him, you idiot,” he says. Malfoy doesn’t seem to hear him. He just pulls his arm free and slams his fist at Harry’s chest.
The steps come anyway, and Harry takes them and ends up in the Entrance Hall. Draco is still beside him. He slowed down together with Harry. Harry avoids his eyes. Instead, he looks at the stairs to his left, which will lead Harry to Gryffindor tower. Then he glances at the stairs on the right, which go down to the Slytherin dungeon. They will both have to go their separate ways.
They stand up and shake healer Burke’s hand. Harry places his arm around Draco’s waist as they leave the hospital. “It’s all going to work out, I promise,” he says. Draco wishes he could still believe that.
Harry looks at the ring on his own finger. The same golden ring they found on Draco. Only here the name Draco is engraved next to their wedding date.
“Bloody Merlin, Malfoy,” Harry says. “That you haven’t lost it until now is a miracle.” He again moves his hand along with his words and Malfoy watches them move. His grey eyes glitter a little. Harry wonders if it’s because of the tears that had fallen from them just now, or if it’s because Malfoy is fascinated with the way Harry tries to communicate with him.
‘Let’s start with the simple yes and no,’ Harry writes. Malfoy nods and then looks as Harry makes the sign for yes. ‘This is yes,’ he writes as he shows it again. It’s a simple sign. Just a fist with the thumb on top that nods. Malfoy repeats it a couple of times.
Narcissa takes him in her arms again. She doesn’t say anything else. No words of how all will be fine, how things will work out somehow. Because they won’t. Harry is dead and there is nothing they can do to bring him back. The Dark Lord has won. And all because of one small accident. Because Draco couldn’t hold onto the person he loves. Draco holds onto his mother’s dress as he sobs. He can’t hold the tears back any longer. Not now all hope seems lost.
But it was too late. The feast had ended and from either end of the corridor where we were standing came the sound of feet climbing the stairs. The next moment, students were crashing into the passage from both ends. They all fell quiet when they spotted the hanging cat. Hermione and I stood alone, in the middle of the corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see the grisly sight. And worst off all was Argus Filch that came shouldering his way through the crowd. When he saw Mrs Norris he fell back and clutched his face in horror. For a short moment, I felt sorry for the man until he started screeching that I had murdered his cat.
Harry takes a small step towards the stacks where his wand rolled to. Neville just has to hold Pettigrew’s attention long enough for Harry to reach it. Once he has his wand, he can stop Pettigrew and free Draco.
Malfoy doesn’t respond. He just repeatedly hits his fist against Harry’s chest. Tears fall from Malfoy’s eyes. It’s as if he’s desperate and Harry doesn’t understand. What did he do to upset Malfoy like this? He can’t still be angry that Harry helped their house-elf Dobby get his freedom. Or could he?
Pansy lowers the newspaper. “Well, if they don’t, they would have to arrest Draco for murdering their precious saviour,” she says. She takes some strawberries and bananas from the bowl in front of her and starts to cut them into smaller pieces. When she’s done she will put them in a bowl, add cereal and milk and eat her healthy breakfast. All to keep her perfect shape.
You will never believe what happened. Well, you probably the only persons I know who will. I found out today that I’m a wizard. A WIZARD. Isn’t that cool. I’m not crazy or strange, but I’m a wizard. And in just a couple of weeks, I’ll be going to Hogwarts, a wizard school. I never knew. Aunt Petunia never told me. It all started a couple of days ago when I got a letter. It was addressed to me. It even knew I lived in the cupboard under the stairs. Yes lived, I’ve gotten my own room now. Uncle Vernon went mad when the letter arrived. He didn’t want me to read it, so he took it and burned it. But I knew something was wrong because that night I got my own bedroom. It is still filled with Dudley’s old stuff and that evening I rather had stayed in the cupboard if it meant I had gotten to read that letter.
“Does Draco need Teddy-bear?” Teddy asks. Draco hasn’t heard him come down and into the room. He hopes the boy hasn’t seen much of what just happened. It’s already bad enough that Draco cried in front of him this afternoon without even realising it.
There are chains around his ankles and wrists. They keep him locked in the chair he was forced to sit in. He knows this chair. He sat in it once before. Years ago. When Dumbledore was still alive and there to save him. Back when the world still made some kind of sense. Before it had turned against him and took everything he ever cared about.
Draco walks up the stairs of the castle, the route he’s taken so many times in the last couple of weeks. He doesn’t stop until he reaches the place where he first ran into Harry at the beginning of the school year, where they shared heated words until Harry broke down in front of Draco when he mentioned Cedric. Harry had cried and Draco had sat next to him without saying a word.
When Harry finally finishes his plate, he and his friends get up to go and get some fresh air. Harry isn’t sure he wants to join them, but he also doesn’t want to be alone. But then he spots Draco in the hallway. Their eyes meet and Harry rushes forward. Only Draco shakes his head and then hurries away. Harry doesn’t hesitate and runs after him. It isn’t until he can take a hold of Draco’s arm that Draco stops and turns to face him.
He led me to the Beauxbatons carriage. I wanted to ask what was going on, but Hagrid shhh’ed me. Then he went on a stroll with Madame Maxime. She also didn’t know where Hagrid was taking her. He told her not to tell anyone he showed her because she wasn’t supposed to know. It irritated me not knowing where we were going and having to run after Hagrid and Madam Maxime. And I almost turned around and went back to the dungeon to crawl into bed with Draco when I could hear men shouting up ahead. We walked around a clump of trees and then stopped. For a split second, I thought I was looking at bonfires, and men darting around them, and then my mouth fell open. Because the men were darting around four fully grown, enormous, vicious-looking dragons. Draco made me describe them both when I got back. He says it sounds like they have a Hungarian Horntail, a Common Welsh Green, a Swedish Short-Snout and a Chinese Fireball.
I think I had the best birthday ever this year. Draco arrived on the morning of my birthday, kissing me awake. It was good to have him in my arms again, to have him close. I hate it when he’s not with me. Draco said he had the worst month of his life, trying to avoid his father as much as he could and missing me like crazy. And then he went off to go make me breakfast while I showered and got dressed.
Malfoy looks away for a second before he turns back to the parchment they’re using to communicate. ‘What’s BSL?’ he writes.
Dobby disappeared with a loud crack and Draco slumped back into bed, his watery grey eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing. I couldn’t look away from him, he looked sad and lost. Maybe he does still care about me.
We went to the Apothecary to replenish our store of potions ingredients. Draco helped us to pick the perfect ones, told me off when I just pick the ones on top without inspecting them. He loved helping me, hanging over me and touching all the time. Hermione wanted to know all about my troubles during the holidays with my family and was amazed I wasn’t expelled. I told her I was too, that for a little moment I was scared I would be sent to jail for what I did. This made Draco laugh, joking that it would make the news if the Boy Who Lived would be incarcerated. After that Draco asked Hermione how France was and she told us all about the interesting wizard history there.
“Yes, Weasley, he is. Always has been and always will be. And if it’s up to him, he will only marry one person in his life, but that idiot has told him that he doesn’t want him. So now he’s been sulking for a week, ignoring his schoolwork and being a massive pain.”
It’s a lovely day today. Exams are over and the results are in. I’ve done okay this year. My potions mark is an Exceeds Expectations and I still can’t believe it. I’ve got Acceptable on most of my exams and an Outstanding for Defence Against the Dark Arts. Draco’s marks are all Outstanding and he’s top of our class in all subjects except Charms where Hermione managed to beat him by a couple of points.
When Lucius reaches them, he doesn’t greet any of them. He just grabs Draco by his arm and starts to pull him away. Draco looks at Harry and he lifts his free hand to his chest and circles it over his heart and then points at Harry. Harry repeats the movement with dread in his heart. He knew Draco’s father wouldn't approve of their relationship, but having to say goodbye like this for the entire summer is hard.
The steak on Draco’s plate loses focus the longer Draco stares at it. He won’t only be responsible for Harry’s death. He will also carry the burden of the death of his mother. It’s unbearable. Draco doesn’t know how to continue. He can’t do this. Not without Harry by his side. Draco thinks of Harry’s smile. Of all the times Harry was able to see the positive in all. And then Harry’s final words ring in Draco’s mind. “Just remember that there’s always hope, and that I’ll always love you.”
“I need to go,” Harry says. He stands up and blinks with his eyes. He won’t cry in front of the entire school again. “I’ve got Quidditch practice.”
So I need to study a lot to get my head around all the theory of magic and the wand movements and everything. And Ron said I should stop being afraid of my wand. He thinks that’s the main reason I’m struggling with it all. Hermione agrees with him on that one (it’s a miracle!) but also thinks I just need to study harder. Studying harder is her answer to all our problems. I wish life was that simple, but I know studying won’t solve everything.
Nott and Crabbe had to say so stupid things before the match, asked me if the new broom came with a parachute, just in case the Dementors come near me. Draco told them to shut their mouth and pulled out his wand. Adrian and Miles also took out their wants and said it would be fun to hex them back into the dungeons. I’ve heard that Nott wanted to try out for the team this year for the seeker position and was that he’s been angry about me getting the spot without any try-outs.
“Okay, fine,” Neville says and then he turns to Ron. He makes eye contact and his eyebrows pinch together. “Ron, you can’t tell a soul,” he says. “Not even Hermione.”
The man we saw was Karkaroff and he was brought in for questioning from Azkaban. Mr Crouch was there and asked him for the names of Death Eaters. Karkaroff mentioned multiple names, but most were already captured or dead. Until he mentioned a wizard working for the Department of Mysteries. But he was still sent back to Azkaban, even after he mentioned professor Snape’s name. But it was agreed that Snape had turned sides in the war and was no longer a Death Eater.
“I’m sorry, Oliver,” Harry shouts as he turns and starts to run. He can handle an upset Oliver. He can’t handle an angry father and a crying mother, because Harry didn’t stop Neville from getting himself killed.
I also asked him why he was so sure back then that Professor Snape had switched sides, but he didn’t want to answer that. He said it was between him and Professor Snape.
Filch left us alone with Hagrid and Draco turned to him telling him he wasn’t going into the forest. There was a note of panic in his voice. Nott also started to protest, saying he wasn’t going either. Hagrid shut them both up that by saying that if they wanted to stay at Hogwarts they will go in. He said that we had done wrong and that we now have to pay for it. Draco started ranting then, saying that this was servant stuff, not for students and that if his father would know what he was doing… well, we never found out, because Hagrid stopped him by saying that if he rather was expelled he could go back to the castle to start packing.
Professor Quirrell was staring at the mirror, saying he could see himself presenting the stone to his master. I had to keep him away from it, so I continued talking, saying that Snape always seemed to hate me so much. Quirrell said that he does. That Snape was at Hogwarts together with you, dad, and that you two loathed each other. But that Snape would never want me dead.
Harry finishes his coffee and walks back into the room. He looks for his trunks so he can go and take a morning swim. If he goes now, he can be back and showered by the time Draco wakes up. They can order breakfast and plan their last day. Go into town, buy some souvenirs and presents for Teddy. Have lunch at that lovely little cafe at the beach, maybe dabble along the water before they have to pack their things to be in time for their port key tonight.
“They will just be bombarded with a million questions once word gets out that Pettigrew attacked them,” she said. Remus and Snape had agreed. And then they left. Remus to write to James and Lily and Snape to wherever he goes when he isn’t torturing students.
At the end of the class, Malfoy pushes the note in Harry’s hand and then storms off. Harry opens the note. The letters are large and scrawled over multiple times. LEAVE ME ALONE it says. I DON’T NEED OR WANT YOUR HELP!
Harry looks around the class. Ron sucks on his quill and fumbles with his parchment. He rubs his chin with his other hand. Hermione is bent over her parchment, scribbling away like crazy. Probably trying to get more words on the parchment than necessary. Neville sits upright and looks around the room too. Their eyes meet. Harry lifts his brows to indicate he’s not sure how well he’s done. Neville smiles and shows a thumbs up.
Their mom was really upset with the twins and Ron when we got there, screaming she had been worried when their beds had been empty and the car was gone. She kept on shouting until her voice was hoarse. And then she turned on me. I was afraid she would start yelling at me but she just said she was pleased to see me and offered me breakfast.
The other thing keeping me awake is Voldemort. I still have nightmares about him, about his livid face, his wide, mad eyes. I wake up drenched in cold sweat, wondering where Voldemort is now and if he found another way to come back. And would he come after me again if he has?
After our talk, we kissed and ended up making love between the trees. It was intense but perfect. I’m so in love. Dad, did you feel like this about mom? I wish I could ask you how it was for you when you and mom started dating. How did you know that mom was the person you wanted to spend the rest of your life with? Were you as sure about mom as I am about Draco? I’m extremely happy and don’t get me wrong, but times like these I miss you. I know that one day I’m going to marry Draco and the thought that you won’t be there. Well, it hurts.
Remus turns and starts towards the main gates of Hogwarts. “I hope it will,” he says. “I’d hate to fail Draco, only because he is scared to be in my class.”
Harry doesn’t know what gives James that idea. The horror on Draco’s face was clear. The message to leave him alone left no doubt in Harry’s mind. “No, he doesn’t. Not anymore anyway,” Harry says. He takes another sip of his lemonade. He shouldn’t have brought it up. It will just give him hope that isn’t there. Draco was clear. He wants Harry to stay away from him.
Sorry for that, mom and dad. Draco needed some attention. He’s off fetching some food from the Great Hall right now, he won’t bother us again. Let’s get back to my gifts. Mrs Weasley had sent me a slate sweater with a golden snitch on it and a dozen home-baked mince pies. Hagrid has sent me sweets and Hermione gave me more books to read. I also had gifts from our other friends. Blaise had sent us a book about gay sex and how to stay safe with a note to say we were not allowed to do any of it while he was sleeping in the same room. Greg had gotten me some new polish for when I get a new broom and Daphne gave me a book on braiding techniques. And Luna had sent me a magazine about Dementors and how to protect yourself from them. It’s called the Quibbler and Draco said they only publish nonsense. Still, I appreciate the gesture.
Headmaster Dumbledore told us a bit about the Pensive, but it wasn’t any new information that Draco hadn’t told me already. And then he asked me why Professor Snape had brought us to his office. I told him about the dream, with Wormtail and Voldemort. And that it hurt my scar when Voldemort tortured Wormtail.
“The gifts, the small little tokens Draco has been sending you. Fuck, you really don’t know, do you?” Zabini shakes his head again. “Didn’t any of your house-mates explain to you what was going on?”
“My Lord,” Bellatrix says. She waves her knife around and a sick smile sits on her face. “We’ve found the hideout of the wolf. Only he was alone.”
A lot has happened in the last couple of weeks. I don’t know where to begin so I’ll just start at the beginning. I’ve found out what the third and final task for the TriWizard tournament is going to be. I had to go down to the Quidditch field one evening together with the other champions. I met up with Cedric at the Entrance Hall and we walked to the field together. We don’t hang out that much, but we’ve become friends over the last couple of months. He’s the only other student who knows what it feels like to be a champion. And he was a bit taken aback when he heard how hard the second tasks was for me. And a little jealous of the fact that I’ve found the one I would love till the end of my days already. He’s been dating Cho Chang. He says he likes her, but that it would be nice to know if it was going to last.
Harry looks at their friends again. Ron seems to be losing. He’s covered with snow. Malfoy seems to be able to dodge most snowballs. His coat is still mostly black. His cheeks are flushed. He’s beautiful. Harry swallows as his hand moves up to touch his lips.
Harry shakes his head. The more he learns about Draco’s father, the more he hates the man. Does he truly expect all that from Draco? And it’s not even true. Draco is so capable of doing extraordinary magic. “Your grades are improving,” Harry signs. “And you did amazing magic tonight. Your father should be proud.”
Draco walks past a confused Andromeda, she opens her mouth to say something, and Draco just shakes his head. He walks on the side of the road that will lead him to the small town close to Andromeda’s cottage. Tears stream over his face and his hands shake next to his body. He’s about halfway to town when his legs start to protest, and Draco kneels on the moist ground.
“Let’s get back and get pissed then,” Harry says. He takes Draco’s hand in his again and starts the trek back to the cottage. And Draco is sure now. 2002 is going to be the best year ever.
“I don’t think he likes me, Hermione.” Harry looks over the lake and wonders what he will have to find there next week. Not that he will find it, as they still haven’t found a way for Harry to breath underwater.
“I’ll inform the teachers,” Remus says. “He must be struggling with his schoolwork if he can’t hear what is being said in class.”
Harry opens his mouth and his tongue slides over Draco’s lips. A small moan escapes Draco while he lets Harry’s tongue in. It’s perfect and Draco wants to stay like this forever. In a haunted bathroom, kissing the boy he’s been falling in love with for the last couple of months. In this place where the Dark Lord has no control and Harry is just Harry and Draco is just Draco.
Even at top speed, it seems as if the castle is still miles away. Harry pushes forward. He breathes loudly as his legs take step after step. As quickly as he can he makes his way back. He bursts through the door and looks around. He’s got no clue which way is to the Hufflepuff common room. It’s not the same way as the Slytherin dungeons. Whenever Harry walks with Draco to his common room, he’s never seen any Hufflepuffs. So it must be the other way? Down the stairs to the right, instead of left? But what if Harry is wrong? What if he goes the wrong way and doesn’t find Neville in time? Neville could die.
And we kind of were when it happened. It was just when Hermione asked me if there was any truth in the other boys saying that I’m bent. And I was kind of glad I didn’t have to answer that because I’m not really sure. I’ve never liked any girl, but I’ve also never felt anything for a boy, so I just don’t know what I like. Maybe I don’t like any of them. And that’s fine too, right?
Harry turns around to continue his track down the carriage to look for Iris. He only makes it two steps before a force hits him in the chest. Platinum blond hair and angry grey eyes are in front of Harry’s face. Malfoy’s fists slam against Harry’s chest, over and over. Harry tries to get a hold of Malfoy’s hands to stop the assault.
We’ve been in the library ever since Saturday. Hermione and Draco are sure we will find a spell that will help me get past a dragon. Krum is always here. It drives Hermione crazy. Because when Krum comes into the library, a hurt of girls come in a little later, making noise and staring at Krum all the time.
Draco and Hermione were in the Entrance Hall. They had received a note from Hagrid about the appeal of Buckbeak. He’d lost and Buckbeak was to be executed at sunset. We all agreed we should go and see him, but I’d left my invisibility cloak in the passageway under the one-eyed witch when Nott and Crabbe saw me in Hogsmeade and I hadn’t been able to retrieve it. Draco and I both made sure neither professor Snape nor professor Lupin saw us anywhere near it, knowing we would be in big trouble if they did. So Hermione went to retrieve the cloak while Draco and I joint our friends for dinner.
“He would have been a handful, being ours. Stubborn and impatient like me, innovative and smart like you,” Harry dreams. Draco can see it all in front of his eyes. How they would struggle to keep their little boy under control, but they would love every day of it because he was their boy.
“What are we doing on our Hogsmeade weekend before Easter?” Hermione asks. She sits down next to Harry and takes the newspaper. “Don’t tell me, you two are going to try to find him.”
After Marcus his little speech I could finally mount my Firebolt. And it was better than I’d ever dreamed. It turns with the lightest touch and seems to obey my thoughts rather than my grip. It’s so fast that the stadium turned into a green-and-grey blur. It was so easy to catch the snitch now that I had a broom this amazing. The other members of the team also seemed inspired by the presence of the Firebolt and performed their best moves faultlessly. After I got the snitch for the third time I just hovered in the air to see Draco fly and practice his moves. Because I braid his hair only at the front it still sweeps behind him when he flies and he looks so beautiful when he does. I wanted to fly up to him and jump him right then and there.
And then they arrived. Man in black cloaks and masked. They approached Voldemort on their knees and kissed the hem of his robe, calling him master. Then they would back up and stand. A circle formed around Voldemort, with gaps in between, like more people should still come. But Voldemort started to talk. He was not happy with the Death Eaters. Went on and on about how they never went looking for him and help him. One of the men asked for forgiveness and was punished by receiving the Curcio curse. Voldemort told them they should all serve them for thirteen years before he would even think of forgiving them. He then rewarded Wormtail for his help by giving him a silver hand that took the place of the hand he had chopped off.
Harry and Ron agree. Hermione doesn’t get why it’s a big deal. Neville says it would be nice to go and see all the international wizards. Draco says that his father has tickets, but that he isn’t sure if he will take Draco with him.
Harry ignores her and just walks away. She can’t see him, so there is no way she will be able to rat him out.
The next day there was another letter, now address to me in the smallest bedroom at 4 Privet Drive. And again uncle Vernon didn’t let me read the letter, but I was convinced they would try to send more so I made a plan. I was going to wait for the postman on the corner of the street, but uncle Vernon was waiting for me at the doormat when I came downstairs the next morning, so I couldn’t get to the postmen before he delivered our mail. When the post came I saw that there now were three letters for me, but again uncle Vernon tore them up. He didn’t go to work that day and nailed up the mail slot. But more letters kept coming. On Friday there where twelve letters pushed under the door and around the cracks of the window of the downstairs bathroom. Uncle Vernon burned them all and started to hammer and nail up all the cracks around the doors. The next day there where twenty-four letters in the eggs. Yes, you read it correctly; they were hidden inside the eggs! On Sunday letters came flying from the fireplace filling up the house. Uncle Vernon made us leave the house. We drove for hours without breaks or anything to eat. Dudley was howling at the end of the day. We stayed in a hotel and the next morning the owner brought us a letter, addressed to me, in room 17 Railview Hotel in Cokeworth.  She said she had about a hundred of them at the front desk. But I still didn’t get to read them.
Hermione and Harry laugh when Ron’s eyes widen. “Oh, shut up, both of you,” Ron says when he realises that Neville was joking.
Draco drinks every last drop of blood from Harry’s body. His love had died a couple of minutes ago. His blood has been the best Draco ever tasted. He turns Harry’s body around and lays him carefully on the pillows. He rests his head on Harry’s chest and waits for him to wake. He’ll be back with Draco before the sun will rise tonight. Draco also woke up just before sunrise, in the arms of his lover after losing his virginity on a new moon. Draco had spiked Harry’s wine with his own blood to make sure he would turn. Hours pass and nothing happens. Harry’s body stays still and unresponsive. The sun starts to rise in the distant. Draco knows he should move, that he should put his clothes back on and make his way inside. He knows it didn’t work, that Harry won’t come back to him. He closes his eyes and lays back down on Harry’s chest.
But like I said, I had been out flying my broom. It was raining and I was wet and dirty when I came back into the castle. I took the stairs down to the dungeons and ran into Nearly Headless Nick. He’s the Gryffindor ghost. He said I looked troubled and I responded that he looked troubled too. He told me he had wanted to join the Headless Hunt but was denied. It’s because his head is still attached to his body by an inch of skin and sinew. He also asked me what was bothering me and if he could help me. I was just in the process in asking him if he could mend a broken heart when Mrs Norris showed up, followed closely by Filth. I had to come with him because I had left a muddy puddle on the floor. In his office, he started to fill out a form with my name and crime. He was just about to write down my punishment when we were interrupted by a loud bang coming from the floor above. Filch ran out of the office screaming Peeves’ name, saying he would get him this time.
Before I could properly process what was happening I got dragged to my feed. The man in the cloak tied me to a headstone that had the name Tom Riddle on it. I struggled to get loose. It’s then that the man hit me with his hand and I saw that he was missing a finger. I knew then who it was. Your supposed to be friend Wormtail. Anger flooded my head. I wanted to get loose and kill him. I had shown mercy toward him and now he killed an innocent person.
“Oh,” both Greg and Vincent say in unison. It all makes sense to them now and they focus on their breakfast again. Draco looks at his own plate. Still empty. The coffee he poured sits untouched in its cup. If it wasn’t for the standard warming spells on the cups it would have turned cold by now.
Harry takes the necklace from the box and places it around Draco’s neck. “Just remember that I will never stop loving you,” Harry says, and then he kisses Draco. It’s sweet, and Draco wants Harry to stop because he doesn’t deserve this kind of love and kindness. And at the same time he never wants it to end, never wants his heart to break in a million piece when Harry finally leaves him.
I took off the hat and walked towards the Slytherin table with shaking legs. Draco Malfoy, the nasty boy is in Slytherin. Most people at the Slytherin table were clapping, but Malfoy just looked at me with a piercing look. I set down next to Theo Nott, who was also sorted in Slytherin. Malfoy said I better start behaving like a real Slytherin if I wanted to survive my first year.
Harry means to get rid of the book, but he places it on his bedside table at the end of the day and leaves it there. He never reads it, or even opens it, but for an unknown reason, he can’t move himself to throw it away.
“Thank you, Draco. I’ll write a prescription, and then you can pick it up at the hospital’s pharmacy when you go home today. It’s already late now, so I would advise waiting till tomorrow morning before you take the potion. This way, if you start to lose too much blood, you don’t end up with the slimmed-down night crew here at the hospital.”
“Hurry up, we don’t want to be late,” Harry tells his friends as he stands up from the table. He grabs his bag and starts his track towards the next class.
“Stop staring at the enemy,” Fred shouts when he swings by. He slams his bat against the Bludger that was going straight for Harry.
“Yes, Harry, we’re going to the Quidditch World Cup final,” James says. He’s got a massive grin on his face.
Draco went to look at my dregs, told me I was going to get unexpected gold and then he tried to figure out the animal shape he was seeing but never got to finish because Professor Trelawney came up to us and wanted to have a look at my cup. She saw a falcon, which means I have a deadly enemy. Hermione mentioned that everyone knows that, that I’m enemies with You-Know-Who. It was kind of weird to see Hermione speak up against a teacher, I don’t think she’s ever done that before. Professor Trelawney didn’t respond to it, just continued with my cup. She predicted that I was going to be attacked, that there was danger on my path and then she screamed and sat down with her hand at her heart and her eyes closed, mumbling that it would be kinder not to say. Nott was on his feet straight away to have a look at my cup. Draco pushed him to the side and asked the professor what was wrong.
After we’ve all gotten our money we split up and agreed to meet again at Flourish and Blotts in an hour to buy our schoolbooks. I, Hermione and Ron strolled off toward the broom store. Here I bought the new Nimbus 2001. It’s black and silver with revolving stirrups. Because they pivot they should be more comfortable while slitting in different positions on the broom. The shop owner told me it’s the fastest broom in existence and already ordered by all the big Quidditch teams. Ron is very jealous about it and has already asked me if he can try it out tomorrow. I’m sure I’ll let him after I’ve taken it for a spin myself. I’m looking forward to flying on my own broom. It should be better than the brooms I’ve flown up until now.
Harry doesn’t think about it. He opens his hand and his wand drops to the floor. It bounces a couple of times. The sound echoes around them in the empty library. Harry doesn’t take his eyes off Draco as his wand rolls out of his reach. Draco’s eyes on the other hand follow the wand to where it stops in its tracks. When Harry gets a chance, he knows exactly where his wand now lies.
Neville leans against the small fence at the edge of the path. Harry stops next to him and they both stare at the Shrieking Shack. Hermione was all excited to go see it, as it’s believed to be haunted. Harry and Neville both know better. They’ve heard the stories a million times. About how Uncle Remus needed a place to hide during the full moons when he was a student at Hogwarts. Maybe they should tell Ron. He hasn’t said a word on the way here. He looks around them and keeps a safe distance from the fence. Or maybe Ron shouldn’t be so silly and stop believing in haunted buildings and ghosts that are out to get you. He’s an idiot to believe a word from his brothers Fred and George. He should stop taking them so seriously.
We have lots of homework during these Easter holidays, so all of us agreed it would be best to stay at the school and study together. We just get a lot more done when we can help each other. I don’t know how Hermione manages with all her extra classes. Draco and I have gotten extra homework and I have no idea when to do it all. First off, I’m back to somewhat more regular visits to Miss Davis. I see her once a month now, just to make sure I’m dealing in a healthy way with this bond thing and the TriWizard tournament. She doesn’t give me that much homework, but she does want me to keep a track of when I’m feeling down or overwhelmed with everything and what is happening at those moments to talk them over in our therapy.
“You were with me, that was all that mattered,” Draco tells him. It will be the one thing that will always matter. It’s Draco’s biggest dream, to always have Harry with him. A dream which is slowly dissolving into a nightmare.
I also still go to Miss Davis every week. We don’t only talk about classes anymore. We’ve also been talking about how it is to not have parents like all the others around me. I told Miss Davis that I write to you on a regular basis and she said that was good, that I should keep doing that if it makes me feel better. I told her it did, that it made me feel closer to you. We talk about how I miss you, even though I can’t really remember you.
But then again. There was last week. Potter seemed more upset with himself than with Draco. He stuttered. Said he didn’t mean to say what he said, that he just wanted to talk. It was stupid. But what if it was his way of trying to reach out to Draco?
His mother’s screams die away. Blond hair and grey eyes pop into his mind. Malfoy smiling from the stands. Malfoy helping him figure out his Potions assignment. Malfoy butchering the sign for Harry’s name. Malfoy scribbling down that his name is Draco, not Malfoy. Harry telling him to figure out a sign for it so Harry can call out to him during breakfast. The faint blush on Malfoy’s face and then that sweet smile.
The rest of the next two weeks went by in a blur. We went to class and I either studied with Draco or Hermione for our exams. The days were getting hotter and I was happy that the dungeon stayed nice and cool, making it easier to study there. I told Hermione, Ron and Neville and they just complained that the west tower was sweltering hot.
But back to Sirius and Draco’s mom. They talked for hours once the test were all done. When they both witnessed how connected Draco and I are. I heard Draco’s mom say that they should forget the way they’ve hurt each other in the past and make sure that ‘our boys are taken care of’. I think that was enough for Sirius to open up to her.
“Okay, let me know when you figure that out,” Ron says without any judgement. “I hate being the last to know.”
Professor Snape came by when I was in the hospital wing, demanding me to tell him who had tied me on that tree. I told him I wasn’t sure, that I had fallen asleep on my bed and woke up tied up. Professor Snape got angry at me then, really angry. He shouted: ‘How am I supposed to help you when you won’t let me. Mr Potter? I thought that by now you would know that you can trust me. I can’t do anything about the bullying if you don’t give me names, Mr Potter. But have it your own way. Just don’t come hunting me when they finally manage to kill you.’
“What is wrong with me answering for us what we want?” Harry asks. “It’s not like I would tell you something Draco hasn’t already agreed with.”
Draco hates how Harry points the blame to himself. Like he could be at fault for all this. He’s perfect, why would he be the reason Draco can’t get pregnant. It’s so mixed up. Draco wants to open his mouth and tell Harry that he could never be at fault. He sacrificed himself to save everyone else. Why would he be punished for that? He’s not like Draco, who helped that mad man, who let Death Eaters into Hogwarts, who tortured others to save his own life. So many people died because of Draco’s cowardly actions. If anyone is at fault, it is him, not Harry.
“It’s going to be a good summer,” Ginny says. “With the Quidditch World Cup. I wish we could get tickets for the final. It’s in England this year.”
“I was supposed to be the one to kill him,” the Dark Lord says. His red eyes bore into Draco’s. Draco swallows but doesn’t look away. If he shows weakness now, they’ll all be dead.
Harry reads the sentence and then shows Draco how to say it. Draco repeats the movement and then nods. He gets it. They both smile at each other. Only Harry’s smile drops as the question sinks in.
“Shorten it, you mean?” Draco signs. He’s been able to keep up with conversations with more ease ever since Hermione started to get the hang of BSL. Ron’s signs are still horrible, but at least he tries.
“I want to find Pettigrew,” Neville says. Harry had already forgotten about him again. That’s another thing that Draco does. He makes Harry forget about everything else in the world. He takes up most of Harry’s thoughts. And almost all his dreams. Good dreams. In which Harry kisses Draco and Draco doesn’t mind. They would hold hands and sit next to each other all the time. Draco’s smile is in them too. Harry loves that smile.
“Oh my god. Did Potter just kiss Malfoy?” Justin says. Harry can hear the disgust in his voice. Before dinner starts the entire school will know that Harry tried to kiss a boy. And was turned down. Tears well up in Harry’s eyes. He can’t deal with all of that right now. Not now his heart breaks apart. Draco moves further and further away. He passes by Neville, who’s still motionless on the floor. And then he turns and runs. Harry wants to go after him. Wants to stop him and tell him he’s sorry. Tell him he won’t ever do anything like that again. As long as he can keep Draco as his friend. Only Harry is frozen to the spot.
“Just remember what will happen if you fail,” the Dark Lord says. He looks at Narcissa, a crooked smile on his face. Draco blinks and nods his head. Of course, it will not just be him who will die for his betrayal. The Dark Lord knows that there is no way Draco will manage to kill Dumbledore in the last two months of the school year. Draco will die trying. And his mother will pay the price. She will die at the hands of the Dark Lord. Her dead won’t be quick and painless. She will pay for their disobedient behaviour towards the Dark Lord.
“It’s bad that you need help defeating a girl and a Slytherin,” Neville says as he grabs some more snow. A snowball hits Draco straight in the face. He sputters and looks horrified. And then he laughs. His entire face lights up and even without any sound, it’s clear he loves this day. Then he spots Harry staring at him and throws his snowball at him instead of Neville. Only Harry’s reflexes are quick enough and he dodges the ball. Then he grabs some snow and joins his friends in the snow fight.
“I don’t want to know what just almost happened out there,” Burke says. “What I do want to know is how you’re holding up, Draco?”
“Neville, please drop it,” Harry says. He can’t do this. He won’t cry in front of his brother again. No matter how much it hurts, Harry will forget about Draco. He has to. He picks up the newspaper and goes over the article again. “Do you know where this street is they mention?” he asks.
Care of Magical Creatures was, how to call it, I think interesting is the best word. Hagrid has bred Blast-Ended Skrewts. They look like deformed, shell-less lobsters and are horribly pale and slimy-looking. They have no visible heads and legs stick out in very odd places. And the smell is like smelling rotting fish. OH and every now and then, sparks fly out of the end of a skrewt, making it propel forward. We had to feed them that first lesson, which was kind of hard since they didn’t seem to have any mouths. Draco didn’t like them at all, since they could burn, sting and bite all at once. And I had no idea how to make it so that these creatures sounded useful or less scary for him. So I just let him hover behind me while I tried to feed them.
Oh, I also need to tell you about something weird. Professor Snape thinks that Draco and I stole the Gillyweed and Boomslang skin from his office. I tried to explain that Dobby stole the Gillyweed, that he gave it to me. But that didn’t convince Professor Snape. He said he would have no other choice but to report us if we would brake into his office again.
“Do you think that will be enough?” Harry asks. He doubts it will. Who in their right mind will listen to Snape?
“Okay, we’re off,” Harry pipes in. “Before Molly realises we were here from the start. I want to stay in her good books.”
“I love you, but I don’t know how long I can keep doing this,” Harry continues. He pushes some of Draco’s hair out of his face. “I want my husband back.”
I thought of Draco, far away at the Hogwarts grounds. He would feel the pain and despair I’d lived through during the second tasks. He would be incomplete for the rest of his life. And I would do that to him. Tears fell from my eyes, knowing I would hurt him more than anyone could ever do. He would be alone and broken. I wished I could have held him one last time, kissed his lips goodbye and watch him sleep next to me.
“Bloody hell, Harry. Don’t tell me you’ve been staring at Cedric and Cho all evening. I’m sorry, mate, but I don’t think your evil eye is going to make them split up,” Ron says.
Sometime later, Hermione calmed down a bit and we strolled around. And then we overheard a conversation between Hagrid and Madame Maxime. It turns out that Hagrid is half-giant and when he asked Madame Maxime if she was too, she got really angry. Draco later explained that it’s a shameful thing, being part creature. Just another thing the wizarding world is stupid and short-minded. And giants are also seen as vicious and violent creatures that like to kill. So we all agreed to keep Hagrid’s secret and not tell anyone else.
Viktor nodded his head and then changed the subject. He told me that I was a really good flier, that he watched me during the first tasks, and that he would love to fly against me one day. I told him I saw him at the Quidditch World Cup and that I wasn’t near as good as him. He disagreed and we made a deal that after the last tasks we would find time to set up a little Quidditch match with some of his friends and my Quidditch playing friends. Miles and Adrian are all up for it and already started to think who they should put on the team. I think they even approached Fred and George to asks if they would be the beaters.
When we got down to the ground the Slytherin supporters came sprinting towards us, all shouting and chairing. Blaise was so happy because he had a bet going with Luna on who would win. Professor Snape was also between the students and congratulated us on the win and told Draco he showed some proper spell work with his Patronus charm. His eyes kept flickering between me and Draco and it felt like he was worried. I said the Dementors didn’t even affect me this time and that’s when Professor Snape showed us who the Dementors had been. It was Wood, the team captain of Gryffindor, together with Nott and Crabbe. Professor McGonagall was shouting at them and gave them all detention. Unfortunately, she also took 100 points from our house because of it. When Marcus saw Wood struggling to remove himself from a long, black, hooded robe he just stormed away, screaming something about that Wood was a pussy for trying to sabotage the Slytherin team.
“Teddy, I just want to sleep some more,” Draco tells him. “I’ll be fine later. I promise. Now go see if you can help Harry, he’s feeding Nathan downstairs.”
“Tomorrow I will honour you,” the Dark Lord says. “You will join our ranks and set an example for the others, the ones that are too great a cowards to act.”
After that, I just wandered through the castle. I didn’t want to go back to the common room and be reminded that Draco was out having fun with all our friends. For a moment I considered going to the library and do some homework, but I prefer to do my homework when Draco or Hermione are around to help me when I get stuck. Really I wouldn’t get the grades I have if it wasn’t for their help. We started our little study group again in the library. We go there every Wednesday afternoon after class. It’s me, Draco, Blaise, Greg, Daphne, Hermione and Luna. The other Gryffindors don’t really hang out with us anymore. I’ll tell you all about why in a bit, first I want to explain how I figured out that Professor Lupin was a friend of yours.
I could see myself in the mirror. I was pale and scared-looking at first. But only a moment later, my reflection was smiling at me. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone. Then he winked and put the stone back into the pocket. And at that moment I could feel something heavy drop into my real pocket. Somehow I had gotten the stone.
The house fills with Death Eaters again as the day goes on. Draco keeps to himself. He doesn’t talk to others and stays clear of the Dark Lord as much as he can. But the inevitable moment comes just before dinner. The Dark Lord calls Draco to come to stand next to him.
Harry wants him to look back up. He wants to know if they can be friends again. They both miss each other. Sure they can get over the fact that Harry loves Draco. They can still be friends. Harry will keep his feelings locked up. He will do whatever Draco wants.
I’m confused. Something happened on the train back to London and I don’t know what it means. I wish Hedwig wasn’t locked in her cage so I could send Hermione a letter and ask her what she thinks. Because I think it means he likes me like really likes me. As in he wants to be my boyfriend likes me. And I don’t know if that is what I want. I like hanging out with him, he makes me feel safe. But does that mean I like him too? I just don’t know. And what if I’m wrong? What if it just means we are good friends? I can do that. I think. But it’s different with him than with Hermione. I want to be close to him whenever I can. And I don’t miss Hermione as much as I miss him. Mom, does that mean I like him more than just friends? I just don’t know. And I don’t know what to do. I wish you were here to help me figure this all out. I miss you both so much.
For a moment none of us knew how we were going to go back up the long pipe, but Fawkes helped us out again. Draco was still holding my hand and Ron grabbed the back of my robes, holding Professor Lockhart’s hand with his free hand. I took hold of Fawkes tail feathers and then we flew upwards through the pipe. And when we reached the top I could see Professor Snape run into the bathroom with Neville on his heels. Myrtle expressed that she was disappointed I wasn’t dead and Draco gave her an angry stare.
Harry shakes his head and looks back at his brother. “It’s fine,” he says even though it’s not. Harry had hoped that this new focus, that their search for Pettigrew, would help him forget about Draco and the pain inside his heart. But it doesn’t. Everything seems dull without Draco. Harry can’t put his mind at rest, always dreaming of Draco and what could have been.
Harry doesn’t think that Professor Snape will be able to calm anyone. But he gets that Uncle Remus needs to hold him for a little while longer, so he doesn’t fight against the hold anymore.
“I know it’s stupid, okay. And impossible. And never going to happen. So you don’t have to worry about anything,” Harry snaps. He knew Ron would never understand.
After Draco wrote the letters for me we made our way back to the Slytherin dungeon where there was this amazing party just for me. Somehow there were mountains of cakes and flagons of pumpkin juice and Butterbeer. Adrian said he knew the secret of the Hogwarts kitchens but didn’t want to share it with us. And Blaise and Greg had enchanted the ceiling of the common room to show stars. They said it wasn’t as good as the Great Hall because it wasn’t the real sky outside, but just random stars. When Draco heard this he got his wand and moved some of the stars to make the Draco constellation. I told him he should show me it for real one night and he agreed with me. I know this means we’ll have to break some rules (like not going outside at night), but I would love to see the constellation that Draco is named after for real with him one day.
“The way they’re dealing with it is barbaric,” Harry says. “The boy is deaf and they think it’s funny to jump him from behind. They laugh at him and make fun of him. No, Malfoy needs someone who can help him, not make his life worse than it already is.”
Harry parks his bike in the shed and moves back into the garden. The one tree they have is leafless and cold, just like the last two months. Harry can't wait for spring to begin, watch the first flowers spring from the ground and sit outside to enjoy the late sunshine. A glass of wine and a good book in his hands. Draco close by with his papers and his quill stuck behind his ear, trying to make sense of the mess his clients present him with. A monitor spell hovering close to keep an eye on the sleeping Teddy.
“I wanted to say goodnight to Draco. Tell him not to be sad, that my mom and dad will look after my little brother.”
“I can’t tell you,” Harry says. “I promised dad. It has to do with how Pettigrew got out of Azkaban. Dad told me.”
And there is another image Draco doesn’t need. “Not the dining table we still have in our house?” Draco asks. The one Harry brought along when they moved into their own house.
I’ve been flying around with the team just now and they offered me a place on the team next year to replace Terence. Adrian and Marcus say that Terence is a good seeker, but that I have a natural talent that should not be going to waste. Terence even joked that he’s happy I didn’t try out this year since I would have kicked him off the team for sure. Miles agrees with him. Only Peregrine and Lucian don’t seem all that enthusiastic about me joining the team. They have been giving Draco and me some nasty looks. I don’t think they like the fact that our hands are always almost holding each other these days and Draco tends to rest his head on my shoulder or in my lap every chance he gets. But that’s their problem, it’s not like we are kissing in front of them or anything. We only kiss when there is nobody else around, or at night before we fall asleep. It’s nice to be able to kiss him, mom. I sometimes still can’t believe he’s my boyfriend now.
The warning never came, but the insults from Aunt Marge continued. And then yesterday, just after dinner when Aunt Marge was hammered from the wine she turned on me again. Told me I had a mean, runty look, just like some dogs. And then she told us that she had Colonel Fubster drown one of her dogs last year because it was weak. I looked down at my hands when she continued, small tears falling from my eyes. She went on, explaining it all comes down o blood and that Aunt Petunia’s sister was a bad egg. That she was stupid to run off with a wastrel and that I was the result of that. She then asked what you did for a living, dad and Uncle Vernon said you were unemployed. And then Aunt Marge just went on, saying you were a no-account, good-for-nothing, lazy scrounger and I just snapped. I pushed my chair back, stood up and screamed at her that you were not. She laughed at me, joked about the tears I was shedding and then she suggested that you died because you were driving drunk I couldn’t take it and yelled that you didn’t die in a car crash. This made Aunt Marge angry, she, of course, doesn’t know the truth and still believes you dying in a car crash is the trued. She called me a nasty little liar, an insolent, ungrateful little something. She couldn’t finish her sentence, her body was swelling, her face expanded, her tiny eyes bulged, and her mouth stretched too tightly for speech. Then the buttons from her tweed jacket burst. She just kept swelling. I knew I was doing it, but I couldn’t stop it. I was so angry. I’ve never been that angry before, it scared me a little.
Just that morning Draco and I had joked about the book Blaise had sent us, and now we are both thinking about it. About how better it might even be when we aren’t still wearing all our clothes. But also about how scary it all is. We’re only thirteen years old, isn’t that too young to start thinking of having sex? But on the other hand, I want Draco so much, want to be close to him all the time? I don’t know what to do now. I’m a little scared that Draco will want to do more now, and I’m not sure if I’m ready for that. I love kissing him, and what we did that Christmas afternoon, it was amazing and I want to feel like that again. But I don’t know if I want to start getting naked together. I wish I could really talk to you about all this, dad. I don’t want to lose Draco because I don’t want to take this any further, but I also don’t want to do something I’m not ready for. I know I should just talk to Draco about it, but I’m scared of what he will say. It’s not like anything has really changed. We still kiss all the time and I still want his hand in mine all the time. And we still have so much fun together. I just wish I knew if he wants to do it again, or if he wants to go even further?
They both stare at the ceiling. Harry wonders if Pettigrew is still in Hogsmeade. Will he go after Sirius or Neville if he gets the chance? It’s been weeks since the last sighting. Silently, Harry had hoped that Pettigrew would have moved on and would leave his family alone. Harry hasn’t found a way to stop him yet. But he will. He can’t have that animal cause even more pain. It’s enough that he betrayed Neville’s parents and caused their deaths, and that he disabled Sirius in the way he did. He won’t get that chance again, to do harm like that. Harry will stop him before Pettigrew comes close to Harry’s loved ones.
“Draco, I’ve been wondering. And I think I need this, need to know that this isn’t something Voldemort did to me by turning me into his final Horcrux,” Harry continues.
A distraction sounds good. Harry nods his agreement. He would do anything to forget about the pain inside of him.
Harry looks at his diary. The amount of homework for the upcoming Christmas break is ridiculous. It’s just two more days and then they will all be on the train home. Harry doesn’t get why the teachers hand out extra work for the holidays. It’s unfair if you ask him. He’s supposed to be on break, as in free from school. Iris doesn’t mind, she says it’s great that she can still study while at home. Harry is sure she will think differently when she gets there and sees all her neglected toys. And when Uncle Remus and Uncle Sirius are at the house the entire time, she won’t have time for all the extra work.
We also ran into Hagrid in the library last week, which was very unusual. He tried to hide some things behind his back and asked us if we were still looking for Nicolas Flamel. Ron bragged that we had found him ages ago. I had to hide my smile when Neville rolled his eyes. It had been Hermione and me that had figured it out, Ron had no part in that and he knew that. But I’m getting used to Ron taking credit for work he hasn’t done, always making everything sounding like a team effort instead of giving the person that done it the credit unless of course, Ron did it, then it’s just him.
Draco makes his way to the bathroom and opens the taps to fill up the bath. He takes off his clothes and slides into the warm water. For some time he just stares at the ceiling, remembering some of the times he did have fun with Vincent and Greg. When they still had been young and unaware of the wrongs they were taught. When Draco didn’t feel the pressure to live up to his father's expectations. When they would just chase the Gnomes in the garden and laugh and shout.
Harry doesn’t give up. He keeps up with the notes. He has to. If he doesn’t, he’ll be just as bad as all those people that had given up on his Uncle Sirius when he got injured and lost his hearing. Harry is a better person than that. Only Malfoy doesn’t read the notes anymore. He just tosses them in the bin. Harry needs a new tactic if he wants to get Malfoy to accept his help.
Malfoy moves the book to the side and starts to write. ‘How is this going to help me, when none of the teachers know these signs?’
Just a little warning, Harry will describe a very bad beating he receives in the first four paragraph's of this story, so if that's triggering for you, please skip them.
“Harry has a point. And Ron, you have too many brothers to be the vampire. It’s got to be someone without any siblings.” Seamus sits down next to Dean and rests his chin on his shoulder. “Maybe it’s my boyfriend, he’s a single child.”
At that point, one of the Dementors came for me. It raised both its rotting hands and lowered its hood. It was terrifying to see. Where its eyes should be there was only grey scabbed skin, stretched blankly over empty sockets. But it had a mouth, a gaping, shapeless hole, sucking the air with the sound of a death rattle. The Dementor’s hand were strong around my neck, it forced my face upward, I could feel its breath. I closed my eyes and for one second I gave in to the fact that I was going to die. And then I heard your voice again, mom. Screaming and begging for Voldemort to let me live. You sacrificed yourself to save me and I would not let it be for nothing. I was going to fight. I started to think of all the amazing memories I’d made with Draco. I thought about the first time he kissed me, and the first time he told me he loved me. I thought about Christmas and how we did a little more than just kiss for the first time in our lives. I thought about how good it felt to come with Draco’s mouth on me and of how he told me he loved me over and over again when I returned the favour. All the memories together worked, I did it. A silver dragon shot from my wand and I could see it chase the Dementors away. It’s the last thing I remember from that moment. I think I fainted on top of Draco after that.
Draco, Hermione and I went to visit Hagrid the Wednesday after that, he was really upset. Draco told him not to worry, that he was fine. Only that wasn’t the problem. The governors of the school had been told and Hagrid was afraid he would lose his job. We told him that we would back him up, tell everyone that needed to hear it the truth, that Crabbe had come up to Buckbeak without bowing, that he had ignored all Hagrid’s instructions. He hugged me and Draco, told us we were good boys. Hagrid was kind of drunk and Hermione told him so. He then went and stuck his head in the water barrel outside. When he came back he suddenly started shouting at us for wandering around after dark, that it was too dangerous. He escorted us back to the castle and promised him that we won’t go out after dark again.
The grounds outside are busy. It seems that every student in the school has decided to celebrate the end of exams in the fresh air. Harry and his friends walk around the lake and in the end sit down close to the forest. The trees give some nice shade, which is welcomed by Ron and Neville, who tend to turn red when the sun is out.
Lily lets go and then turns to Draco. “It’s good to see you again,” she says. Her hands sign along with her words and Draco answers all politely, as the proper boy he’s been raised to be. At the same time, Sirius pets Harry on the shoulder.
Harry shakes his head. “Nothing. What was it you said,” he says. He knows he should look at Ron, stop him from following his line of sight, but he just can’t. He wants them to trip, to stumble, to stop dancing. He needs Malfoy to stop dancing with that cow.
“Just don’t go after him,” James says. “No matter what you hear, or how close he gets. Just run and stay safe.”
Sunday we had to get back to studying, because or exams have started since Tuesday. Hermione was in a panic on Sunday, afraid she wouldn’t do any good because she had missed so much while being petrified. Draco told her not to worry, that he had no problem with taking over her number one position. She hit him with a book after that and Daphne and I just laughed at them. Greg tried to cheer Hermione up by saying she would still do better than him and that just made her determent to tutor Greg for the rest of the Sunday afternoon.
Harry looks around the Great Hall. It’s still early for a Saturday, but Harry’s sure that Draco is in here somewhere. He scans over the Slytherin table and spots Draco at the back. He sits alone, a mug with juice in his hand on his way to his mouth, while his eyes are fixed on the book in front of him. A smile forms on Harry’s face as he moves towards Draco and sits down next to him. Draco looks up from his book, smiles and then continues to read. Harry grabs some bacon and eggs and plants them on a piece of toast. Then he pours himself a cup of coffee.
‘You can never do that again! If it wasn’t for Headmaster Dumbledore you would be dead. And I can’t lose my best friend. I already lost one before. I can’t do that again. And I haven’t even shown you the sign I came up with for my name. I need you to learn to say my name.’
“Yeah,” Harry says. He hangs back on his chair. “Now that Hufflepuff has beaten Slytherin, we have a chance of winning the cup again. Wood wants to analyse the Hufflepuffs game, to see how we can beat them.”
“It’s probably a Slytherin, nicely tucked away in the dungeons, like a real vampire,” Harry concludes.
“Yes, they did,” Neville says. “But they aren’t registered. And they can get in a lot of trouble if that comes out.” And that is putting it lightly. Both James and Sirius work for the Ministry. If it becomes public knowledge that they have been in violation of the law since they were fifteen years old, they probably lose their jobs and can get sent to jail.
Draco pulled the picture out from the frame, and folded it, placing it in the back pocket of his jeans. He’d hold onto it for now. Maybe he’d see this little girl someday, and then he could give it to her as a memory. Or maybe when all of this is over, he would put it up on a wall as a way to remember everyone. To make sure no survivor forgot about this young girl and her brother. So they could live on even if they were dead.
Draco looked over to Blaise, who remained quiet. They both understood the unsaid question. This group had told them things about them...now it was their turn to pay back. To tell the three something about them. “What?”
He cries harder, falling in love with the hand running up and down his back softly. It feels so real, and Draco doesn’t know what to make it. Waves are crashing over him, but Potter keeps him afloat. Pulling him back from under the water to the surface, refusing to let him to back under, even if it kills him.
Draco let out a small snarl, feeling the need to laugh crawling up his throat. “And this is any better?” he finds himself asking, lips curved up in disbelief.
Remembers his partners subjecting them to the virus, wondering if this creation would be the one, and each experiment had never lasted more than two weeks.
Draco places his head in his head and shook. Bloody idiots! Why couldn't they just focus on getting him out and away from Potter's hold? His friends were idiots. They really were. And it was during times like these, he wondered why he'd even become friends with them in the first place. Merlin, give them a brain.
The ropes holding him to the trunk of the tree fell, disappearing into tiny sparks of light as they hit the ground, letting Draco slump down against the rough surface. His father was using too much magic. Too much hate contorted into the Crucio that he’d placed upon Granger. She lay withering on the ground, shaking and trembling. Like Draco...she was shaking..trembling.
The raven ran a hand through his hair, and gave Draco a disappointed look. “Fine, you give me your broom, potions, and wand, and I’ll let you go on a walk...
Emerald green met silver, and Harry flashed him a broken grin. “You know more than you let on, Blondie, so you’re going to help us.” The raven left no room for argument. It wasn’t a question..or request. It was a demand. Plain and simple...nothing more. Nothing less.
Draco snarled at that, reaching up to snap his teeth at the raven, who only returned the anger with a sinister smirk. “You promised!
He doesn’t look up. His plate is yet to be finished, and he’s eating again. The meat tasting like the screams of the man in capture. The wine tasting like the tears of the children who he’d seen break down as he took their fathers, and mothers away from them.
it. It just felt....suffocating,” Draco spoke quietly, not telling the complete truth, but not exactly lying either. It was true he felt suffocated, but there was more to the story.
Gritting his teeth, he marched down to the dorm rooms, trying to pull his mind away from the image. For a second...just for a second, he genuinely felt the need to help. Sure, he felt horrible for almost killing Malfoy, but the more he pondered on it, the more he wanted to think, and truly believe that Malfoy was just doing all this for attention.
Draco almost let out a chuckle, but the sharp pointed end of a want found his jaw first. He let out a crackled cry of pain, as it left a sharp cut on his jaw, the skin around it throbbing, and no doubt already bruising. “
Harry gazed down at the figure in worry. He plied the fingers off his wrist, shrugging the hand away and promptly ran out to find Madame Promprey.
Draco was now only functioning on the pure wonder of coffee. This was the 4th day he hadn't slept at all. Not even a blink. The bags around his eyes were prominent and his friends yelling didn't help.
And suddenly it clicks to him why they had returned. Dread begins to pool in his stomach, an overwhelming realization settling in. He knows why they returned.
Blaise isn’t scared of dying, no, he’s afraid of Draco dying. His friend who still held a flicker of hope so bright, Blaise was afraid he might smother it. He didn’t understand how Draco did it. How these years hadn’t torn his will apart and buried all the bright light deep under. Doesn’t understand how even after losing Pansy, Draco still walks with his head high.
Harry was, however, glad that Madame Pomfrey didn't ask him how it was that Malfoy came to be in such a pigiment. It seemed as though she already knew.
Draco swallowed, trying to ease his nerves, as he tiptoed down the hallway, sparing one last look into Lily’s room before exiting the house. If he was lucky he’d survive 2 days at the most. But that’s only if he was lucky.
Out of the corner of his eyes, Madame Pomfrey dragged a chair next to the bed and made Draco lay inside the safety of the covers.
And Hermione can’t decide whether it was the colour of hope or a remenating the end of the world. Either way, it scares her. More than it should.
Carrot top by the door flashed him a toothy grin, and the two others followed. “That’s where you're wrong Blondie. Unlike you, Hermione here wasn’t lying. We aren’t new.”
of him. Not to mention, Harry truly had no interest in her. Yes, she was kind, and sweet, but she just didn't have that exitement to it. That spark. He wanted someone who could match him. Someone who didn't like him because of his title. Someone who'd scold him, get angry at him, and be willing to give up everything for him. He needed a person who would challenge him every step up the way, without relenting. Someone who wouldn't be
Harry reached out to Malfoy as he saw the body fall, and land with a thud on the ground. He cringed when he heard the sickening crack of skull to stone. Harry did this. He was about to....
He wants to say, but bites his tongue. He looked at the ground glaring. “They know the way out of here.”
And yes, I know no living human being in capable of staying awake for 3 weeks, but meh. This is a fan-fiction  so it don't think it has to be acurate. The longest somebody has gone is like 17 days...I think.
He screamed as they drug him across the snow, his feet kicking, but to no real away. “LET ME GO!! NO!
He leaves no room for argument, and Draco slumps in his arms giving up. It’s a war he can’t win. He takes in Potter’s ridiculous outfit. Pajamas covered in a series of comical owls, and a night-shirt in the most hideous yellow Draco had ever seen.
Molly snapped out of her daze and nodded frantically. She grabbed the child from his arms and quickly ran inside and wrapped the small body in the blanket that was discarded on the couch. before rushing back to the door. The sights before her shocks her.
He waits for an insult or perhaps another punch for his “lies”. Instead he’s greeted with two pair of hands reaching behind his slumped figure, wrapping their arms him, and for a moment, Draco thinks the raven is comforting him. It’s a foolish thought, it only proves him wrong as the bindings wrapped around his wrists fall loose, dropping to the floor behind him one by one.
She noticed Malfoy wince, and stop for barely a second, and continued tretching in the snow, pretending he didn't hear her.
Malfoy winced at the words and looked down at his lap in what seemed to be shame. Harry almost laughed at the irony. Why was Malfoy ashamed? If anything, Harry should be ashamed, for letting the corners of his lips tug up into a barely noticeable smile. For feeling an overjoyed relief when he figured she didn't know the real answer. For knowing that he won't be caught unless Mafloy decided to open his mouth.
Hermione sneers bitterly, the knife trembling as it continued it’s way down the bark. Luna puts a hand on her arm, an unspoken cue to stop the carving and she does.
The only problem, he is a fool. A stupid foolish boy who’s made far too many mistakes, but he runs nonetheless. The shoe digging against the tips of his toes, and the random snarling of the unfortunates sending him the other way.
Draco remembers Vincent and Gregory and Marcus and Millicent and Adrian. How they’d lost them back at the mall. How’d they’d all gotten separated at the mall, and hadn’t seen each other since. Hell, Draco didn’t even know if they were still alive. Then he remembers Pansy. How they left her back in that warehouse, and he could only hope she made it out alive.
The plate is empty, and Draco feels the slightest bit proud of himself. His stomach feels horribly stuffed threatening to come up, but he gulps it back down. Eyes shifting to the side, he takes in the figure of a curled up shivering elf on the porcelain tiles. Bones prodding from his torn, moldied clothings. Chains clawing into their skin spilling dirty blood all over the white. The elf is quiet.
“Let’s talk!” the boy beamed and it made Draco uncomfortable. How was it that Potter could go from angry to happy so easily? He had made sure to use the most painful insults. The ones that always pushed Potter to the edge. So what was so different this time?
Draco was about to spit out a smart remark, but Blaise beat him to it. His voice remaining calm and collected. “And why’s that?”
Harry instinctively reached over, grabbing the first thing to keep him from falling, which just so happened to be Draco, sending them crashing into the pile of uck. The raven let out a choked laugh, pushing Draco off him who went sliding into the deep pit of wet dirt.
There was no way he could sleep here, or even think of it. They needed to escape, and soon. He couldn’t miss their chance of escape for wanting to catch a breath, or rest for an hour or two.
“Would you have believed me?” Draco leaned back against the whooping tree, eyes trailing over the the semi-frozen lake.
The glass table covered with white silk, and long. He sat at the end, watching his father eating quietly from across the empty surface. His hands were wrapped around expensive silverware. The metal cool and soft against his skin.
Blaise out of here. He couldn’t leave Blaise behind, couldn’t handle the pressure of being alone. He’d have lost his mind in hours had he been left alone outside.
The raven was quiet for a moment, arms crossed around his chest, and waiting for Draco to do something. Draco only gave him a confused look, “
I'll also maybe not write smut, since I've never written it before, and I don't want one character to have to top or bottom because of personality or physique. I used to have this idea of one being more feminine, but that sort of felt wrong after a while, seeing that they are both characters with their own personal characteristic, and it doesn't make sense to make someone the "male" or the "female" of the relationship. I don't know if what I'm saying makes sense, but yeah. It's just me realizing feminizing a character is wrong, and I will might not write any smut because I have no experience in writing it, maybe I'll imply that they did do it, but not write too much of a detailed scene?
Legs turned to jelly, and Draco tipped forward, his body rolling down the hill like a limp doll. The snow pushed up inside his cloak, barely audible to his numbing skin.
before him. Perhaps this world had something to hope for after all. If not, Lily would at least be able to get a couple normal years in life, before it all ended. A shame, he wouldn’t be there for those special years of hers.
glasses? Really? Couldn’t you have been anymore original?” Draco narrowed his eyes. “Besides, you’re the only one in this school that could have such a terrible sense in fashion for glasses.”
"He used to drink like 3 glasses during every meal, and now he only drinks 2! Only two and..and now he eats less too!! I know he's up to something!! And he visited promfrey just the night before! And...."
“Where is what?” he replied back, almost mockingly. Only he knew it was a genuine question. One that once knew the answer to, but no more.
Draco shifted awkwardly a little. He scratched his head in nervousness, and pulled his legs up onto the couch.
"You know, I think I like you better this way. Not being able to make those snarky comments of yours and all quiet. I think we could actually get along....ehh who am I kidding. We could
Molly had every right to be suspicious. The kids would definetely not come back this fast. It's too early. WAY too early. As she approached the door cautiously, the person on the other side became more impatient. The ringing of the doorbell became more urgent. More desperate.
And with that Draco squirmed even more, contemplating on whether to bite the shoulder in front of him or not. It wasn't the best decision, but then again, what better could you expect from Draco?
He breathes...calming his erratic heartbeat from tearing right through his chest. One breath in and one breath out. It’s not a hard motion, only Draco feels suffocated by these cold walls, hands clenching around the spring like he’d done with his knife only days earlier.
"Typical." And Draco felt his heart drop. "Honestly, Malfoy, I knew you were a drama queen, but do you really have to do this?"
can be!?! She's my god damn sister. I'd never leave her. But what would you know about that?! All slytherins and the children of Malfoy just seem like the Devils spawn to you! Like all we ever talk about is about death and how fun death is, and how we don't give a shit about our family. You probably think we eat boiled babies for breakfast. Along with the delightful cup of human blood. Oh how
"Quit frowning will you? You'll get wrinkles," he muttered glaring at her a little. Pansy smiled and nodded before leaving Draco to drift back into his own world of thoughts.
"Hates and absolutely despises Harry Potter. The savior. And a malfoy. Which would include the slytherin part too."
Draco looked around at the bloodbath folding out before him. A body draped in black cloaks lay crumpled before him, blood seeping through the small cracks of their mask. A blade lay tucked in the sole of the body’s show, jutting out, barely an arm lengths away from Draco.
Draco looked around, avoiding his gaze from the brunette. “You alone here, Granger? Where’s all the others?” he asked, trying his best to avoid answering the questions. That earned him a blow to the head.
Draco was really in shock. He'd almost died. Almost suffocated to death and that too, by none other than the mighty chosen one. And it was miracle that he'd even managed to break the hold of the magic.
Screw everything. He was going to die down here, maybe starve to death, and Blaise would be long fucking dead. He could always find his way back to the raven he had locked in the room and maybe force some threats out of him.
A couple games later, the victor had been decided as Lily. She’d popped the most matching crackers and eaten almost half of them. Draco let out a small laugh, watching her as she gloated, rubbing her victory into Weasley’s brooding face.
didn’t know...at least not anymore. Funny how well an ‘Oblivious’ charm could work when casting towards the mirror. It was a handy spell. One that could erase an entire life with the power of one small hushed word. Permanent when for someone else, but only temporarily when cast towards yourself. Draco had learned that the hard way. After all, he had been the only wizard in history to try..or better yet be
And with that the fireplace burst into sputtering puffs of smoke, taking his father’s place along with the flames. Once the smoke cleared, and Draco knew he was alone, he collapsed. Knees buckling underneath him, dragging his trembling figure to the floor.
A cup of water was immediately pressed to his lips, and he drank it eagerly. The water ran down his throat and he swore he could've purred in the bliss of it. How long had it been since he'd drank water?
He’d never pictured dying with such a pretty sight. He’d always thought he’d be standing at the end of a cursed wand gleaming an electric green. Maybe the fated were being merciful. Feeling pity for his devastated self.
Draco cowered on his spot on the other side. He could make out a hazy figure of Granger rushing out of the house, followed by Weasley. They were yelling something at the raven, and oh how he wished he could hear.
A woman appeared out of the darkness from behind the red head, and Blaise. Beautiful. Something he didn’t think existed in this world. Her unruly brown curls were put in a high ponytail, with soft wavy bangs coming to her eyebrows. He could make out a tattered knitted sweater, fit snugly against her body, with a satchel slung around her thin waist. A scarf hanging loosely from her neck.
But that was exactly what shouldn't happen. And with Draco Malfoy as a part of their plan. It'd be incredibly difficult. ...
"I can't though!! I can't wake up using them and they make me feel really groggy afterwards and they taste like absolute filth.
The unfortunates were drawing nearer, and she gripped onto her weapon. A small handgun, with only a bullet left. It trembled in her hands, threatening to fell just like the marker from before. Closing her eyes, took a broken breath, placing aim to the gun.
Harry sighed and burried his head in his arms, resting them on the bed. Gods, even Hermione and Ron didn't know. Even though they'd promised to hide nothing. To trust each other...
"Geez, Malfoy. I won't sleep in the common room, just because you were here. This is my bed. And it is you who's in
The thought alone made Draco’s stomach churn, and twist. “P-please..we need–we need to go,” he stuttered, his words more a crackling whisper. Tears threatened to fall from his burning eyes, but he blinked them away. This was no time to be selfish.
Tears blurred his vision, and threw off his aim. He blinked vigorously, trying to get rid of his temporary disadvantage, as a few tears spilled from his swollen eyes. It was dark, so the other wouldn't be able to see his pathetic breakdown, and somehow that put it him in foolish relief.
That’s right! It’s his dick’s fault...but then again, he couldn’t just walk up to his father and be all, ‘
Draco eyes softened, he grabbed Lilly's shoulders and wiped the tears that silently slipped out of her eyes, before the grin spread itself across his face again.
" Draco begged. He knew Potter understood. He wanted Potter gone, and Potter knew that more than anyone else.
“What. Is. Your. Name,” Harry emphasized, his voice turning angrier dropping a few octaves as growls emerging from the back of his throat. He sounded almost...feral.
Dropping the Vile onto the floor, he fell back onto the bed, desperate to make this feeling stop, and all Draco did was cry even harder. He felt suffocated. The tension increasing, and he felt himself slowly sinking deeper into the pool of tar. And he struggled and struggled to get out, in no vain. It only made him sink faster. His mind moving too fast, flooding with absolute terror. The weight on his heart increased, and it felt as though everything was closing down on him. He wanted out!! OUT!! Needed to get out, and he couldn't. He was stuck, not able to do a damn thing.
He knew it was Malfoy. He'd seen or well rather noticed as Malfoy would sneak out after curfew. The map, it would let him know exactly where someone was with the just words and the touch of a wand.
It was only minutes, but felt as like ages as Draco sat there. Pathetic, and shaking in front of the burnt-out fireplace. He turned his head to look at the clock. He had to go meet Potter soon. Either that, or have Potter drag him from his dorms in front the entire Slytherin population. Oh if only his father knew.
He gave Pansy a knowing look, and she returned it with a sly smirk. God, he loved slytherins. Sure they were all assholes, but they were some loyal assholes. Something you couldn’t even find in a hufflepuff. Slytherins were one of a kind.
Too trusting, and with a heart dangling off the edge of his sleeve, just waiting. Waiting for someone to take it, and place it back in his chest, to get his blood pumping again. Only, it were as if it were invisible. It was as if Draco ceased to exist. His body just a shell of what he could have become. Snarky. Sassy. Tough, but soft. Loving, and accepting.
he was here'. If Potter could could knock him out and then carry him all the way to his room without a care about the teachers that may have witnessed the scene, he doubted that Potter would let him go to easily. Turning, he dragged his feet towards the door and twisted the doornob ready to sprint the second the door opened.
I'm sorry for this really late update! And I know it's really short, but I promise the next update will be longer and sooner! I hope you like it. Until next time~ <3
Green caught his eyes, and his breath hitched, the hurtful words stopping themselves at the tip of his tongue. Yes, Draco was scared. Cowardly too, but could you really blame him? It seemed that having the dark lord residing in his very bedroom had given him the ability to feel magic. Or well...
"Look, I'm not going to argue with you on this any further. You're not leaving or getting out from that door without my permission. Until then you am come, and make yourself comfortable," he motioned towards the bed, and then glanced at the vials in Draco's hands. "We are going to have a talk."
“Get rid of it,” the man muttered stepping over the dead body, and walking towards the discarded bag on the concrete floor.
He needed to get out of here, because if this man finds out where Draco came from, there is no doubt in his mind, that he’ll kill him. Sooner or later, he’ll find out, and Drcao just needs to find an escape before them. Until then, he needed to build a foundation of trust between the two.
It was rare, but often times than not, Blaise would force his body awake for a while just for another chance to hear his friend’s voice filling the silence around them.
“Don’t wanna get out of here do you? Into bondage maybe?” Harry mocks, before letting out a small chuckle at his own joke. “C’mon, follow me. Unless of course, you’d rather stay here. Wouldn’t mind seeing you tied up all day.”
there was good in each and everyone. That was before his father's teachings. Before he was bred into the poor blood tradition. Before he learned hate, and pain, and disgust. Before all the lies, and the pain. Before the racism, and his bullying. Before
The bed is a plain mattress of the ground, pushed up against the corner as far away from the door as possible. He wonders if under all that foolish overconfidence, there was a flicker of fear inside Harry. Small, but still burning, eating up the last bit of oxygen around it.
I'm so sorry!! This chapter is even shorter than the previous one! Anyways, hope you like it, even though it's short.
He scrambled backwards, trying to gain any distance between the unfortunate and him, but in no avail. His heart was thumping, words stuck at the tip of his tongue. He wanted to cry out for help, for someone.
The hall was empty, and quiet. He knew they were waiting. Probably from him to waltz out from the room grinning like a madman. That was his opponents first mistake. Never expect things to be easy, and Draco sure as hell wasn’t going to make it easy. He moved his bat, to hang out beside him, and moved his weight to one foot.
Draco looked suprised. He had expected a dead for an apology, something in return. Something to make him replay for his
. He wished they would just leave and never return. He didn’t want their food or water no more. Blaise and him could find it elsewhere. Tears welled up at the corners of his eyes, but Draco blinked them away refusing to breakdown for this ruthless people.
“How could you?” Draco hissed, betrayal flushing through his blood. Rage mangled in with unbearable terror filling his lungs. “
Draco rang the bell again. It'd been a while since he'd rung the last one.. Cmon. ..please...be home be home...open!
Nope, definitely not. And now as he sat in front of his father, who’d come to visit him, Draco couldn’t help but go back to their last interaction together. The one where Potter had called him a
Draco looked up confused. Why would Potter care if he didn't take them? And how was it that he knew? Draco was sure he'd put on concealing beauty charms and everything. Was it is body posture, or the lack of excitement that gave it away? He straightened his back and lifted his chin up. Ok Draco, you've got this. Just don't stutter.
Draco sniffled, taking in another gasp of air, his fingers still shaking, convulsing. He peered up, not bothering to wipe the trails his hot tears had left behind. He only curled up tighter, wrapping his arms around his trembling body.
When Draco woke up, he was no longer laying sprawled across the cold floor of the great hall. No, instead he found himself with his head embedded into silk white pillows and tangled between red sheets. Groaning, he threw his head to the other side, closing his eyes again, and curling deeper into the blankets. Draco shut his eyes even tighter and waited.
He gave a defeated look, hair matted to his face as the rain continued to pour down. Draco’s own robes and hair soaked down to the bone. All the way that even his curls had begun to sprung up, and in the moment, Draco couldn’t find himself to care.
fight Voldemort a multiple times and returned back alive each time, which as a matter of fact, is a great accomplishment, considering the fact that he's only 16. Moreover, he was pretty damn good looking, despite his hair being a birds nest.
His ears ringed as his head came into contact with the ground. Vision now white, and body numb, he choked out a sob. It wasn't a large fall, but with his current condition it hurt like hell.
She hummed in response, before raising her head from his chest and sitting upright on his lap. Her eyebrows furrowed in concentration, and she pouted.
I have this block, and can't seem to write a chapter without erasing it and rewriting it all over again, which is why I haven't updating for like 4 months. I'm trying to stick to one plot, and I'm just not sure which one will work out the best. I wasn't sure if I wanted to end the story with a bittersweet ending or a more happier ending...or an open-ended one. Personally, I want to leave it slightly open-ended, because the title of the story will start to make sense then.
“Thank you, father,” and with that his father threw a handful of floo powder into the fireplace, and stepped in, engulfed by the flames.
“Wait here,” Potter said, more of an order than a request. Draco almost let out a small whine as the warmth left his skin. He did, however, let out another broken sob as the tall raven exited the room.
Her friends wouldn’t like that. They liked seeing her smile, even if it was in this hellhole. Shaking, she wobbled up onto the soles of her blistered feet, her legs trembling with every stretch of her bones.
It’s his fault Potter’s getting hurt, and yet Draco couldn’t help but say the two words stuck on the tip of his tongue.
"You haven't been taking your potions," Potter said flatly not breaking eye contact with the blonde.
. Maybe to the unfortunates to get them to spare her, or maybe to someone else out there. A survivor, that could hopefully save her. The sun was disappearing over the ocean, the last streaks of light shooting out like stars, piercing her eyes. This was it. The moment was going away.
But these...these experiments are no better. No, they are just the same. No different than the Third Eye, and no better. He feels his bones begin to ache and his chest tighten. He can’t give the cure to the Third Eye, but he can’t allow these monsters to get ahold of it either. They’d use it for vengeance, to create a world of anarchy and destruction.
The broken window provided the perfect escape route. Especially if someone had cast an Anti-Disapparition jinx on his flat.
“It’s always been you, Draco,” Theo said. “We were supposed to be together. I know that sounds silly, deranged. But I always knew we were meant to be together. Especially after we both served time in Azkaban. Very few people know how that feels. Very few people survive that ordeal. But we survived. We survived because we were meant to be together.”
“No, I don’t think so,” answered the duke. “But I should probably get back soon. I have hundreds of guests in need of my attention.”
Sighing, Malfoy sat upright in his chair, causing Harry to drop his hand. “I want to pay you back. I will. The moment I’m strong enough again, I’m going back to work.”
It wasn’t easy to remake an old room into a nursery. They had to call in dark magic experts to make sure nothing dangerous lurked in the curtains, under the carpet. They discovered the wallpaper in the room had magical spells that could harm a small child. (“Nothing too dangerous,” the experts had said. “But the spells might make the baby go blind.”) They then of course had to strip off all the wallpaper and figure out any and all counter spells. This all took time, and meanwhile Harry and Draco couldn’t come to an agreement about the nursery’s décor.
Part of him had understood Potter’s reluctance to spend the Christmas holidays at Malfoy Castle. It was ludicrous, wasn’t it? People
The Queen rose from her armchair to greet them. She was stout, grave-faced. Her billowing black skirts encircled her like a cage. “Malfoy,” she said, a bejewelled hand extended. “I am pleased to see you.” She turned her attention to the secretary. “And you are well, Sir Dullborne?”
“Are you really … jealous?” Harry struggled to believe it. He made the decision not to bring up Miss Greengrass.
Harry frowned. There it was again—an order. He didn’t like it all that much when Malfoy ordered him about.
Malfoy then did something quite unexpected: He leaned over and kissed Harry on the cheek. “No, I like it,” he said, breath smelling of sugary grapes. “I hope you will do it again.”
Draco held his hand close, the one with the ring on it. “We are equals, Harry. Of course you can do it to me.”
They took their breakfast and made their way outdoors to the garden. The London sun was shining, and the magical vegetation was lush and colourful.
Licking his cheek, keeping his hand still pressed to his mouth, Harry fucked him slowly, then picked up speed. It took no time at all for him to be pounding into Draco, taking his pleasure, using his hole.
The tool was easy enough to figure out how to use. The sun shone brightly and sweat began to bead Harry’s forehead, collect under his arms. He let himself sneak glances at Malfoy as they worked in comfortable silence.
Draco hummed and brushed his lips along Harry’s neck. His breath was hot against his ear. “They get me wet, Potter. So wet. Then they slide their cock into me, and they go so deep, so fucking deep.”
Harry looked away from the aristocratic man across from him. He stared gloomily out the window. “It was only a matter of time, Your Grace.”
“All right,” she sighed. She and Ginny both knew that he had fled back to Oxford before the ball had ended but they hadn’t pushed him for an explanation. He was grateful for that.
“I thought the duke wrote to my brother and Percy agreed to give you some time off?” Ginny was frowning.
“Very good, Miss Brown,” Granger said. “And we accomplish this by petitioning the men of Parliament. Tracking them down,
“Mr Potter,” said Lady Hermione Granger, secretary of the National Society of Women’s Suffrage. “Share your thoughts on how young women should approach men in public and hand them a leaflet.”
“Jesus, Harry,” Draco said, voice breaking. He slicked himself up and got into position behind Harry. They were still on their sides. He dragged his mouth along his throat. “Ready?”
The sun was almost blindingly bright as it glinted off the glittering snow. Their breaths steamed the air.
Using another spell, they cooled down the meat mixture, then poured it into the prepared pastry. Then they topped it with the mashed potatoes, but Malfoy grabbed Harry’s wrist in the process and cried, “Wait! Too much potato ruins
Under the table, Harry’s hands curled into fists. So many men could be so demeaning about women. They spoke about them as if they were possessions. But that was the whole point, wasn’t it? In the eyes of British law, women
Harry left the room. He wasn’t sure if Malfoy would make it through the day without a medical emergency.
Draco felt his gaze narrow as he inspected Potter. “You look under the weather.” Concern made his voice turn hard.
“My boy,” Draco said, cradling the baby to his chest. Harry hurriedly cut the umbilical cord. Once cut, the cord shrivelled up and disappeared.
Draco pulled back just a little. It was difficult to concentrate when Potter was stroking him. “You don’t want me to touch you?”
“Right.” Draco handed over the water and turned away. He was mortified, of course. He was making a fool of himself and they both knew it.
“Oh, I have proof. Loads of it. I’m sure a duke wouldn’t want his business printed in the newspaper!”
The man shot up in his seat, the side of his face pink from resting on his arms. He blinked his big emerald eyes at Draco. Draco watched as the man’s expression cleared, then grew panicked.
“It’s a plan.” Harry went to the door, then paused. He looked back at Malfoy. “There’s pyjamas in the wardrobe. They’re old but usable. Do you need help dressing?”
Tears still glittered in his eyes. Parkinson smirked at him. “I knew you were a big softie,” she said to him. He shrugged.
“The cells here fall short of any standards set by the Home Office,” Malfoy growled. “Too filthy, too cold, and unacceptably crowded.”
Malfoy fucked him slowly with the one digit, so slowly. He kissed the centre of Harry’s back, his breath skating over his skin.
Harry had to drop his head. He was afraid others would see the desire in his expression. Luckily, he was saved by the arrival of the second course—a roasted duck on a bed of cherries.
He was inside the Duke of Malfoy, and it was glorious. It was the hottest thing he had ever experienced.
Harry opened his mouth. He wanted to apologise, he did. But he also wanted to protect the duke. “I’m not worth it,” he whispered.
. Right. Harry now understood why Lady Parkinson had felt comfortable enough to invite a group of suffragists to the duke’s home. They were involved—possibly betrothed?
Gulping, Potter nodded slowly. He helped Draco tug off his shirt, then his jeans. Draco paused when they reached his underpants. He didn’t want to pressure or rush Potter.
The policeman pushed at Harry, forcing him to fall back against the women around him. This made Harry angry.
Malfoy reached over and threaded their fingers together. His thumb caressed the top of Harry’s hand. The touch unlocked something deep and sweet inside him.
Harry lowered to a knee to help ease Malfoy out of his trousers; then together they eased down Malfoy’s underpants.
Ginny frowned. “Percy understands that one needs rest. And think of it this way—if you take the time to rest now, you will be strong enough to give my brother one hundred and ten percent once the new semester begins.”
Fear had made him deny himself so much. Fear of being rejected, of being beaten. Fear of being thrown into prison. He had experienced all that, but still he wanted to deny himself. He thought he could somehow control how the world treated him, but he couldn’t. Forcing himself to be unhappy wouldn’t make the world treat him any better.
Together they watched the baby emerge from Draco’s stomach. Harry was delirious enough to recall a scene from a sci-fi film.
“You must not trust Theodore Nott. You must ward your flat against him and avoid him at all costs. If he tries to approach you in public, you must be ready to defend yourself.”
He couldn’t wrap his head around the fact Harry lay in that wooden box in fancy robes, motionless, utterly motionless. He couldn’t wrap his head around the fact Harry would never smile again. He would never laugh again. He would never kiss Draco softly on the lips and whisper,
“Yes, Your Grace, but be careful. We don’t want to get ourselves in a situation where we have to pay a ransom for him.”
“You animal,” Potter whispered hotly, and Draco snarled and bit his neck. He pounded him so hard that the bed banged against the wall.
He and his teammates took a few celebratory laps around the pitch, their brooms shooting through the air, their faces lit up on the mega screens. Black and white confetti fell from the sky, blanketing the crowd, catching in Harry’s hair. His job was done for the day.
“Potter wasn’t good for you anyway. He was a Gryffindor, remember. He was … he didn’t understand our kind.”
“Yes, love.” Harry eased his fingers out, then quickly removed his clothes. He cast another lube spell, getting himself wet. Then he eased his cock inside Draco, his gaze eating him up. He was so greedy for Draco’s reactions.
Draco wanted to throw something. “But still you run away? I can give you the world, don’t you understand?”
“Tell me something I don’t already know.” Malfoy gulped, still staring up. “What about my baby? Did it … survive the attack?”
Harry remained on the horse, not sure if he had the strength to get down. He wasn’t used to riding a horse, and their mad gallop had made his legs go numb.
Following the markings in the snow, they came upon Draco’s steed, the one that was supposed to have kept his head. The horse was nosing the ground innocently, looking for something tasty to eat.
“I’m not used to lazing about in bed. I’m especially not used to being visited by a duke when I’m still in my bed clothes.”
Then the duke did something astonishing: He removed his hat and lowered to a knee. He pressed his hat to his chest as he said, “I was wrong to order you to leave my home. I made an assumption, and that assumption was wrong. I had no idea you were a guest of Lady Parkinson’s. For all of it, I am deeply sorry.”
Draco wanted to hold him close, soothe him; but he forced himself to step back when two servants came to Potter’s aid.
Hot tears rolled down Draco’s cheeks. “That wasn’t our first date. That was just a … preliminary meeting.”
“Oh, right,” he said, terribly awkward. He removed the coat and gingerly gave it to a servant handling their tea. The servant looked at the coat, then looked at Harry. “Sorry, um. It belongs to the duke. He let me wear it. I didn’t nick it or anything.”
Harry’s mouth dropped open. “No! I just …” He trailed off, not sure how he wanted to end the sentence. He wanted to run away. He wanted to hide among his books, bury himself beneath his academics. He didn’t want to fall in love, and he definitely didn’t want to fall in love with a duke.
Sighing, Draco sat back in his chair. “We must be smart about this. We don’t know what sort of men Harry’s consorting with. We need to make quiet, but firm inquiries.”
“Yes, but I also want to help the working man!” To demonstrate this point, Malfoy rummaged in Goyle’s pocket, then shoved a stack of pounds at the bartender. “See? I’m helping out the working man.”
Only decades of Ducal training kept Draco’s expression perfectly bland. Inside he was screaming. The upcoming election was already a disaster, and the liberals had taken a surprising lead. Politics was a messy business, a time-consuming business. Draco excelled at it; but he had better things to do with his time, more important things to do. His tenants were still struggling. His lands were finally making a small profit, but if he wasn’t careful, people would starve on his watch.
Harry muffled a gasp. He felt ill as he watched Goyle pull a checkbook from his inner pocket. Malfoy signed the check and slammed it down on the director’s desk.
“And that is why I appreciate your company.” He glanced past her and saw that the duke was being introduced to a pretty blond girl. Other people were watching too, and they murmured to themselves. Harry overheard that her name was Astoria Greengrass. Trying not to be jealous, Harry had to admit that Miss Greengrass looked perfect for the duke.
“I did.” The duke’s expression was shuttered but his grey eyes were hard as they scrutinised Harry’s face. What was he looking for?
Malfoy blew out air like he was trying not to laugh. He moved his hands lower and lower until he reached Harry’s arse. “May I massage your gluteus maximus?”
Draco approached the royal apartment and handed his hat and greatcoat to a footman. Then he turned his attention to the secretary’s protection officer, the one who had just escorted both him and Secretary Dullborne from Parliament.
“Hello, Gibbs. Yes, it is a lovely day.” Draco motioned to Potter. “This is Mr Harry Potter. He’s accompanying me for a ride today.”
On the other side of Harry was Miss Lavender Brown along with her matronly chaperone. The chaperone, Mrs Bleakman, looked quite unhappy to be at the meeting. Miss Brown gave him a warm smile.
Lady Granger brandished her arm in the air like a sword. “Begin!” she ordered, encouraging them forward. It felt like she had yelled
Potter pushed himself down. The fall was awkward, inelegant. He squeaked and fell right into Draco’s arms. Draco caught him and held him close.
Not looking at Harry, Malfoy lay back on the bed, stretching himself long and straight. He stared at the ceiling and didn’t move.
. The man raised one haughty eyebrow, and determination suddenly poured through Harry: He had to talk to this man. He hadn’t become an Oxford student to cower. He’d changed his whole life to make a difference, and that difference started now.
They headed straight for the stables, but Draco was stopped when someone tugged on his coat. He looked around, then down. It was a child.
Harry’s eyes flashed. He Vanished the towel with a frustrated wave of his wand. “I’m sorry, okay? But you can be a little less dramatic about it.”
Christmas was always a lovely time, and Draco secretly enjoyed it immensely. After his journey out to the fields, he stopped by his bedrooms for his clothes to be changed, his hair brushed, his nails buffed. He wanted to look his best for Potter.
Gathering all his strength, Draco forced his turmoil from his mind. He took Harry into his arms and stood. “I’m getting you out of here,” Draco said to him. Harry didn’t wake up.
. They had grown so close since Draco moved in with him, and they now cuddled on the sofa virtually every night. But it had been months and neither of them had made the first move.
“I’ve got you.” Malfoy’s hand clamped down on his hip. He pulled him back a little, positioning him. Then he pressed inside.
“You entrance me, Mr Potter. There’s no getting around it. You have since the moment I saw you in Parliament Square.”
Weasley’s eyes glittered behind his glasses. Their handshake went on a second longer than necessary. “Take care, Harry. I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.”
Granger stiffened. She looked at Ginny as if the young lady had suggested they make a deal with the devil. “What about her, Miss Weasley?” Granger said, voice clipped.
Groaning, Draco pulled out a little and pushed back in. Harry was so tight, so warm. The pleasure made his vision blur.
He would pack his things, then go down to the kitchen. There had to be hired chefs or servants who planned to leave once the party was over. If all went to plan, Harry would hitch a ride with them to Hawthorne, then he would take a carriage to the nearest train station. He was determined to get back to Oxford as soon as possible.
“Everyone thinks that,” Draco said, voice trembling. He buried his face in Harry’s neck, letting himself feel protected, comforted.
Taking a deep breath, Harry turned back around. Malfoy’s expression was strained, his colour pale. He looked like a man on the brink of losing everything.
Draco was kneeling on the floor, clutching his stomach. He shook his head and muffled another gag. There was vomit all over the carpet.
Harry smoothed his hands over his warm chest. He felt Malfoy’s heart beating fast against his fingertips. He leaned up and took one of Malfoy’s nipples into his mouth, sucking. Malfoy hissed.
Sighing, Potter pulled away. “This is madness, utter madness. We shouldn’t even be in the same room, let alone …”
Boneless, Potter collapsed against the bed. Draco bobbed a little, not ready to release him. Potter moaned deep in his throat.
Draco never thought he would want to hug Professor Trelawney but he still reached out to her. She pulled him into an embrace, all her necklaces rough against his cheek. She smelled like lavender and mint.
Draco wanted to help Potter back to bed himself, but he was forced to stand back as the servants guided him from the room. He could imagine the gossip that was already circulating because of their horseback ride yesterday. He didn’t want to add to it.
The problem was Draco didn’t give a fuck. Not anymore. All he knew was he would do anything to spend even a few more hours with Potter. The Queen herself could order Draco to banish Potter immediately and Draco would tell her
Unable to speak, Draco helped him into the bath. Harry moaned low in his throat as the water came up to his shoulders.
Theo went over to the photographs. He stared at them for so long that Draco almost asked him if anything was wrong.
Draco fell silent for a moment, deep in thought. “Yes, it would make sense. He did sell off all his belongings before he left Oxford.”
“Of course, Your Grace.” Goyle pulled out an old map from his pocket. (The man was always prepared.) “Like I said, he’d be in one of the rookeries: Jacob’s Island, St Giles, or Saffron Hill. Just to name a few.”
“Perhaps,” Parkinson said. Harry groaned internally. He needed to write to Professor Weasley and warn him about the potential delay.
“We are two men who come from vastly different worlds. I have my world, and you have yours.” Harry paused to gather his thoughts. “You ask why I ran away; I did it for you, and for me. I did it because I knew we would never work out.”
Malfoy worked his thumbs into Harry’s shoulders. Harry gasped loudly. “Just breathe,” Malfoy murmured.
Harry was lost. He didn’t know why he walked the streets of Knockturn Alley in the middle of the night. It was dangerous and stupid, but it was also calming. He saw dark wizards and dirty hags and strange creatures. The things that lurked in the shadows knew not to mess with him. Only a few years ago he’d killed Voldemort.
They were out in Parliament Square for only a few minutes when the first police arrived. Harry’s insides turned liquidy. He never cared for the police, and these ones looked quite angry about being outside on such a gloomy, frigid day.
The truth was this had never happened to Draco. Not really. Outside a few wild years when he was young, Draco had always had perfect self-control; it was one of the reasons why the Queen felt comfortable enough to give him important tasks.
“Oh, God,” Harry said, hips still jutting, his knees shaking. He had made a mess of the duke’s appearance. He hadn’t a clue how the duke could walk away unnoticed after it.
She kicked his shin with a dainty foot. “Stop feeling so bad about yourself. She didn’t ask you to go to war, did she? She asked you to host a party, spend some money.”
She rustled back to her chair, lowering herself with regal care. Draco and Sir Dullborne dutifully followed her. Beside her was a writing desk messy with correspondence. Draco vaguely wondered which letters were for her children and how much she intended to berate them. She was especially nasty to her daughters, or so Draco had heard.
Potter leaned up and captured his lips in a kiss. Draco wrapped his arm around the small of his back and buried a hand in his unruly hair. He kissed Potter hungrily, commanding his mouth, urging him to submit.
“You don’t need to be grateful to me, sir, but I reckon the duke would like to hear you say it. You didn’t hear this from me, but he’s been a right mess since you left. I’m worried for him, I am.”
“Yes,” Draco said awkwardly, and urged Potter to follow him out. Mrs Gibbs was still asleep on the bed.
“I could give you everything I have. I could work only for you. I’ll go to London, get multiple jobs. I don’t need to be an Oxford student. I will send you all that I earn. Every penny.”
Harry reached out, wanting to finally feel Malfoy’s bare skin. Malfoy understood his intentions, and sat back to drag his shirt over his head. His pale chest gleamed in the moonlight. His nipples were pink, pebbled. There was a dusting of blond hair on his chest.
“I like you, Malfoy,” she said. “You are a rare sort of man. Dependable. Efficient. When you put your mind to something, you get it done. You don’t look it, but you are modest. I appreciate modesty.”
Draco blinked. He shifted in his seat, uncomfortable. “Yes, I suppose so, if it’s all right with Gibbs.”
This made Draco pause. His face was red now, his gaze glittering. “I’ve kissed you on the cheek. A lot.”
Harry glanced at the duke again, and discovered his face in profile. The duke was listening to his neighbour, nodding at all the right places. He had a beautiful neck; it was definitely swan-like. His hair was the most fascinating shade of blond—it was nearly white, it was. His mouth was thin, angular; his lips were a desperate shade of pink. Harry bet his cock was pink; he bet it was long and heavy; he wanted to know what it
Crystal hung from nearly every surface in the Great Hall. The windows sat snow-licked; the fires roared cheerfully. There were hundreds in attendance, and Harry had never seen so many jewels in all his life.
Draco felt something in his chest loosen. He’d been pushing everyone away for months now. It was exhausting.
Then Malfoy centred on his arsehole again, massaging it with his tongue, urging Harry to open for him. Moaning, Harry let himself relax, his back arching, his legs widening. Malfoy drilled into him with the tip of his tongue, and Harry gasped when he felt Malfoy successfully penetrate him.
In his mind’s eye, he saw all the account sheets for his land. He flipped through them quickly, trying to remember where exactly the dukedom lacked funds. “I would need shipments of barley, ma’am. And whiskey. Barrels of it. I would need cash on hand for emergencies.”
. I’m nothing. I’m trying to make something of myself, but it will take time. I—I can’t be with you, not romantically, not as friends. We don’t
There was an awkward pause. The duke’s expression turned strained. “I believe I will do just that,” he said stiffly. “Please excuse my absence for the rest of the evening.”
Draco forced himself not to react to the man’s proximity. “I demand to know why you are in my library.”
“Oh, bother.” He rubbed his forehead. She was looking at him expectantly, so he forced himself to laugh. “I sort of grew up in a barn … it’s kind of complicated.”
Harry followed the servant to the stairs. He glanced over his shoulder, wanting to catch Malfoy’s eyes, but Malfoy was already turned away.
The first surprise was the trail of soil from the old shed to a crowd of snooty violets. Harry followed the trail, his mouth twisting in a smile. He came around the violets and found Malfoy on his hands and knees, digging into the earth.
A small group of suffragists had been invited to Lady Parkinson’s townhouse in Oxford for tea. At the door the footman looked at him disapprovingly but directed him to where the ladies were already seated around a table with steaming cups of Earl Grey.
They spent loads of time together but they didn’t do much talking. Harry was okay with it. He liked Malfoy’s company; he liked just
The duke urged him several steps back until they were hidden in a dark alcove. The space was tiny but deep, their elbows brushing against the walls on either side of them.
“Yes … no.” Harry yanked away as if Malfoy had held him in place. He paced along a line of colourful roses, sweat beading his forehead. “I don’t fear you; I fear your position. I fear the dukedom and all the eyes that watch us.”
Sighing, he set down his ink pen and leaned back in his grand chair. It was dangerous to be this obsessed with anyone, let alone a commoner. Draco should be concerned for his tenants, his land, especially during a snowstorm. But he only had space for Potter in his head.
“It can happen, you know. It happens to poufs who let men come so far up their arse that their magic mistakes them for women.”
Turning his attention away from them, he instead listened in on the conversations around him. The problems of the aristocracy seemed incredibly foreign to him. They complained about land taxes, overbooked hotels on the French Riviera, a malfunctioning yacht. Harry imagined telling them about all his woes:
“There’s no need,” Draco said awkwardly. This was why he avoided talking to commoners. They were always so careful around him. Of course he liked the respect, the deference, but he also yearned to have a real connection with people.
In the courtyard, the horse veered left, presumably toward open land. Harry clung closer just as the duke turned his body to force the horse in the opposite direction. The movement made their faces connect—Harry felt the duke’s slightly bristled cheek against his own and their lips touched at the corners.
Potter continued to pace. “It’s ridiculous, it truly is. Lady Granger asked me once again to talk to you about our movement, to try to get you to see life through the eyes of the powerless, but that’s impossible, isn’t it?”
Potter took Ronaldo into his bedroom, closing the door on Draco. Draco whined and scratched, but Potter didn’t let him in. Then Draco heard Potter moan and he smelled the hot tang of sex, and he thought about Potter’s favourite pair of trainers by the door. Yes, that would teach him a lesson.
Draco’s kitchen was no bigger than a shoebox. He Summoned a bottle of wine - elven, made with elderberries - and poured each of them a serving.
Potter dragged his lips up and down Draco’s neck. His hand was hesitant, shy, as it tugged him. Draco was quickly losing control.
Sighing, Draco shouldered out of his coat and gave it to her. He would part with everything he wore if it meant finding Harry.
The first photograph was from when he and Harry first started dating, their young, boyish faces pressed together. Draco remembered taking that photo, how Harry’s glasses dug into the slide of his face, how his cheeks hurt from smiling so hard.
Harry met the duke’s hard gaze, then dropped his head. He was ashamed, and the duke looked murderous.
“It doesn’t matter.” Harry waved his wand and opened the warded cabinet. “I haven’t spent a single Galleon you’ve given me. I don’t need it. I want you to have it all back.”
Harry felt weak, a touch feverish. He wanted to have a sit but his trousers were dirty from the road. He was too filthy—too
“Oh.” Draco’s stomach squeezed painfully. When Potter looked at him curiously, all Draco could say was “Oh” again.
Draco stopped abruptly, holding up the line. Yes, it definitely was Potter; Draco glimpsed his oval glasses, his unruly hair. And it looked like he was with another man.
They twirled along with the other dance couples. Ginny’s dress had a lovely yellow skirt that whirled through the air like a sunbeam. Her brown eyes twinkled at him, and he smiled broadly.
“Right,” Harry said, and stood. He folded the flannel on the side of the bathtub. “I’ll give you some time to yourself. Let me know if you need anything else.”
“You are a politician in all but name, Malfoy. Do not play innocent with me. You know how this country works; every political campaign you’ve endeavoured to help has succeeded. You aren’t the boy you were when you took over the Malfoy dukedom at nineteen.”
Harry’s cheeks were burning. He dropped his head forward, trying to gather his wits. The truth was he was very, very smitten with the duke. The man had read him
, Draco thought, frustrated. He tore off the duvet and licked his way down Potter’s stomach. Potter laughed and tried to push him away.
“Good.” Draco wanted to shove him to his back, rip down both their trousers. He wanted to rut in the cold, cold snow, feel Potter hot and hard beneath him. “I need to get my steed.”
Harry drew closer. He’d memorised the spell he wanted to use. He tried to meet Malfoy’s gaze, reassure him; but Malfoy was no longer in the mood for eye contact.
, Harry,” Granger said. “Your business is entirely your own. My only concern is what you can do for our cause.”
“He was close enough! He didn’t want Muggleborns attending Hogwarts. That’s pretty evil in my books.”
For a moment, Harry just gaped at him. Then he hurried to the bathroom to spell on the bathtub. When the water was ready, he hurried back to Draco.
The sofa was snug, comfortable. The fire washed them both in cozy warmth. Harry had a blanket wrapped over his knees; he threw half of the blanket over Malfoy, encouraging him to come closer.
“Keep going!” called Granger. She sounded as if she headed an army. And Harry supposed she did; she headed an army of bluestockings.
. You mustn’t do that. You must marry that pretty blond girl and forget all about me. You must stop risking your reputation because you want to shag me. Didn’t last night satisfy you?”
Staring into his eyes, Harry opened his mouth. Malfoy carefully served him the broth. Some of it dribbled down his chin, and Malfoy, a bloody duke, cleaned his chin. Harry’s life was very strange indeed.
Harry gulped. “Um … I suppose they should approach firmly but with a smile. Men frighten easily. They need that smile.”
Potter still seemed hesitant; but whatever reservations he held crumbled. He closed the space between them and pulled Draco into a desperate kiss. Draco clung to him.
“You are no longer welcome in my home, Harry. You are a walking scandal … a walking deviant. I’m afraid to let you be around my children.”
Malfoy reached around to stroke his dripping prick. Harry thrust into his hand, his eyes rolling up. His orgasm was close, so close, and it made him clench around Malfoy’s thrusts.
“Too far,” Draco growled. “Why in the world didn’t you tell me you’d invited bluestockings into my home?”
Granger laughed. “It’s better if you don’t, believe me. Now—your outfit. You will need a suit of course. Black attire. Remove your jacket. I need to see your shoulders.”
Draco made space for himself between Potter’s gorgeous thighs. He took Potter into his mouth, going all the way down. Potter groaned and dropped his head back.
Guards yanked him through a dark archway, then slammed a gigantic steel gate closed. Harry was the one man in the group of arrests, and the women around him were crying openly. Harry wanted to join them, but he was too numb for tears.
“Yeah,” Harry said, and reached out to touch him. He could tell Malfoy was hard, but Malfoy stepped back. Harry sat up, his gaze never leaving Malfoy’s face. “What’s the meaning of this?”
“I come from scandalised people. My parents … they were circus performers. Went all the way to America to find work. They were magicians. Wore cloaks and such. Before their death, they had no contact with my aunt and uncle and cousin. Of course there was no contact.”
Once again, Draco thought of the man in Parliament Square. He hadn’t been afraid to speak to Draco. He’d marched right up to him and thrust his silly little leaflet into his face. Draco understood it was easier for men to approach other men, but Draco was a duke, and judging by his threadbare clothes, the man had been a lowly commoner. But
There were footsteps, and Harry hastily pulled up his trousers. Oh, God, how long had they had company out here?
Weasley looked up from his paperwork and smiled hesitantly. He had a nice smile. “I might have noticed that you are not eating …”
He had been preoccupied, but Harry hadn’t pushed him for details. Afterall, a duke’s business must have been quite complicated. The interesting thing was on multiple occasions Harry had found him flipping through the book of suffragist readings Harry had given him for Christmas. Harry didn’t know what to make of it.
With no coat, no money, Harry sneaked onto a train headed for London. He said goodbye to his future.
“Draco,” Harry said sleepily, and tilted his head up to kiss him. Malfoy met his lips hungrily, their tongues brushing, moving together. Desire throbbed through Harry, and he realised he wanted Malfoy again.
Harry read through his notes, then leaned close to Malfoy’s face. “You’d have two black eyes if your nose was broken. Perhaps it’s bruised?”
Harry was stiff and leaking. He tugged himself desperately, his pink head fully emerged from his foreskin. Draco leaned in and stuck his tongue out. Harry’s gaze was hot, possessive. His breathing was strained, his teeth biting into his bottom lip.
Draco hadn’t a clue who made the first move, but suddenly they were kissing desperately. Draco put all his anger and pain, all his frustration, into the kiss. Potter made a hungry, needy noise, and yanked at his jacket.
Draco pulled back. “You don’t want me? Is that it?” Even as if he said it Draco knew Potter wanted him. He just wanted to hear the words from Potter.
After a few bites, Harry set down his fork. He took up his teacup and drank deeply. Draco forced himself to eat as well.
“You are not a woman, so I don’t understand why you involve yourself in Lady Granger’s antics. Unless you have personal reasons to do so?”
For the next couple of hours, they made their way to every abattoir and knacker’s yard and piggery. Urban animal agriculture was a disgusting business and it made Draco yearn for the clean, open lands of Wiltshire. Draco waited outside as Goyle inquired inside. Every time, Goyle returned with a frown on his face.
Goyle took out a wad of pounds and shoved it into her hands. “Take your money and get out of our sight.”
Draco touched his chin with two gentle fingers. He urged Potter to look up at him. “If anyone’s a slag, it’s me,” he said, smiling. Potter smiled back, blinking back tears.
The plan was to march until they hit Parliament, then go inside to petition the lawmakers. As they moved closer, the police drew their weapons.
Potter frowned. “That’s not the same … those people … your profit depends on their health. Calling that doctor was beneficial to your bottom line.”
Malfoy bites on his lip and shakes his head. ‘So, I will be able to talk to you, Longbottom and two teachers,’ he writes. ‘I don’t think that’s worth the effort. I have to concentrate on my school work.’
Draco has no idea how much time has passed when two strong arms pull him against Harry’s chest. Draco grabs onto Harry’s t-shirt and tries to pull him even closer. “I’m here, and I love you. This is not your fault, and I won’t leave you,” Harry tells Draco. Draco nods against Harry’s chest. It’s all he can do. He’s afraid to speak, scared he will say what has been in his mind since that awful afternoon in the hospital. It doesn’t matter how many times Harry tells him this is not his fault. He will never believe it.
Harry doesn’t know if Malfoy has any friends. He always seems to be alone. But now that Harry is his friend, Ron, Neville and Hermione will soon follow. They will get along with Malfoy. And Ron and Hermione will learn. Harry doesn’t doubt that.
While the Professor and I were having tea Professor Snape came by to bring Lupin a potion because he’d been feeling a little off-colour. It was weird seeing them interact. I don’t think they like each other very much. And it didn’t look like Snape made the potion out of kindness, more because someone ordered him to do it. Like when I get when I don’t want to make my homework. They hardly spoke more than three words at each other. Professor Lupin didn’t even thank Professor Snape for the potion, he just drowned it quickly and placed the smoking goblet on his desk. And then I saw it, the picture on Professor Lupin’s desk. It contained both of you, a younger Professor Lupin and two other young men I didn’t recognise. And it just shocked me, seeing you there in that picture, big smiles on your faces.
“I love you too,” Draco answers. He lets his weight drop against Harry’s body, rests his head on his shoulder. Harry places his arms around Draco and hugs him. It helps a little with chasing away the demons in Draco’s head. But they won’t disappear, they keep nagging at the edge of his mind.
Draco drops his head and looks at his lap. He can’t go back to that. Not if it’s going to be useless anyway. He will just have to learn to live with the fact that he’s never going to be a father, that he will never give Harry his life wish, a child of their own. But then Harry will leave, so maybe it’s okay, maybe Draco won’t become addicted to them. If it keeps Harry in his life, it might be an option.
Harry turns away from Neville and spots his wand. He runs towards it and ducks to grab it. Behind him, he hears Pettigrew shout Avada Kedavra. Harry’s breath gets stuck in his lungs until a bright green light flashes against the books above him. Harry turns and is ready to jinx Pettigrew. Only Harry can’t. The only thing he sees is Neville laying on the floor. Is he dead? Did Pettigrew get out two killing curses? Harry only heard the one Avada Kedavra. Neville can’t be dead, can he?
“That’s not the same,” Neville says. “Sirius is family. Malfoy is just a boy in our year that isn’t even in our house.”
Draco and Hermione have started researching again to help Hagrid with his case. I wish I could help them more, but Miss Davis is giving me more and more homework for therapy. Even though I tell her time and time again that I’m fine and that I don’t need her anymore. She seems to think that having Black around is making me more unstable. It really sucks. I don’t want to go and do all the work she’s giving me. I want to help Draco and Hermione so we can save Buckbeak.
“Harry, you do understand that you will have to repeat this year if you fail your final exams,” Hermione says. Harry has the feeling she’s been rattling on and on about the importance of school and study schedules.
A hand and cloth slide over the bark of the broom. Harry follows it with his eyes. It’s his hand, even though it doesn’t feel like it belongs to Harry. It has moved over the broom a million times by now. Harry should stop and put his broom away. But the idea of not having anything to do is frightening. Harry wants to stay busy.
“You’ll have to wait until he shows himself,” Neville says. “He’s our only friend in Slytherin. And there is no way any of his housemates are going to let you in their dungeon.”
“We’ve got him,” Neville answers and points to the back of the car. Harry looks towards it, and Draco has to swallow away a lump in his throat when Harry looks at him. Harry is next to the vehicle in seconds and takes Draco’s hand while he gets out. The hand pulls Draco against Harry’s body, and before Draco knows it, he’s crying against Harry’s shoulder with too strong arms around him.
We joined the others, who were just as surprised to see me, they all paid for their sweets and then we went into the snow. Hogsmeade looked like a Christmas card. The little thatched cottages and shops were all covered in a layer of crisp snow, holly wreaths hung on the doors and strings of enchanted candles decorated the trees. We walked around the town a little until Draco said we had to get inside. I had forgotten my coat and was really cold. Draco had his arm around my waist and pulled me close to him while we walked, but I was still shivering.
And that was all fine and well, and I’m glad I can resist the curse. Draco is a bit jealous that I can do it. He didn’t manage at all, and Moody made him crawl over the floor like a ferret. I wanted to hurt Moody when he did that like it wasn’t bad enough that he’d turned Draco into a ferret for real once for no good reason. And that wasn’t even the worst of it all. After I could completely throw off the curse on his fourth attempt he looked at Draco and told him he would never be able to control me again. Draco just shook his head and pretended he didn’t hear but I was furious. So after class, I didn’t go with the others to get dinner but made my way down the dungeons to Professor Snape his classroom. He was still there putting away some potion bottles. I told him about Moody and how he keeps treating Draco as a criminal. Professor Snape premised me he would talk to Moody and even headmaster Dumbledore to make sure Moody keeps his prejudged feelings out of our class.
“He liked it better that way,” Draco says. He can’t say Harry’s name. Not here, in this house, filled with Death Eaters and the Dark Lord.
“He also wasn’t at dinner last night,” Ron says. “Ginny looked for him, but she thinks he’s been hiding in the Slytherin dungeon. Nobody she knows has seen him.”
That Saturday was a Hogsmeade day, and Draco and I joined our friends on the walk there. It was really funny when we passed the Durmstrang ship. Victor Krum appeared on the deck, dressed in nothing but swimming trunks. We all stopped and watched as he dived into the lake. Greg mentioned that Krum most be mad for jumping into freezing water. And Draco responded with ‘but also good looking mad’.  We all laughed at Greg who just shook his head complaining he should find straight friends, that everyone was betraying him. After which Hermione and Daphne pointed out that they were straight. Greg corrected them and told them he needed straight male friends. That the gays and bi’s are taking the overhand. Blaise said he shouldn’t be worried, that he would still drool over girls with him. And Luna agreed she would too.
Without another word, Draco moves to the dressing room and removes his trousers and pants. He pulls his t-shirt down over his hips when he walks back out in the room. Healer Burke has already moved the equipment closer to the bed and has put on some gloves.
Professor Lupin told me that you, dad, were one of his best friends when he was a student at Hogwarts. I just nodded and then walked out of his office. You both had looked so happy in that picture, surrounded by friends and I really missed you both. I ran down to the dungeons and cried into my sheets until Draco came back with bags filled with sweets. I asked him about his day, and he told me all about visiting Dervish and Banges, Zonko's Joke Shop, the Three Broomsticks and the Post Office. It seems Hermione had gone a little crazy there, completely fascinated with the colour-coded owls.
“Your father speaks highly of you,” the Dark Lord says as he walks past the dresser. His finger slides over the top as if he’s inspecting it for dust. “You made him a proud man.”
Remus stops in his tracks and looks out over the grounds. The sun is hidden behind some clouds and the air gets colder by the minute. “He comes from a proud family,” he says.
Harry glances over his shoulder again and smiles at Malfoy when the other looks back at him. This time it’s Malfoy who looks away first and Harry counts it as a win. He will get Malfoy to communicate with him. Harry just needs to irritate him enough.
Malfoy’s eyes scan over the note. Harry can’t stop watching them move. The thunderstorm in them calms down a little as Malfoy goes over the note a second time. Harry doesn’t look away until Malfoy hits him on his head.
Not long after that, the person that looked like Professor Moody turned into his true form. And I recognised him from the pensive memories Draco and I saw. It was Barty Crouch Jr. He hadn’t been as innocent as he had tried his father to believe on that day he was sent to Azkaban. Headmaster Dumbledore questioned Winky when she arrived and later Barty after he had given him some Veritaserum. He told us how he escaped Azkaban (and how his mother past away in there in his place), and how he stole my wand during the Quidditch World Cup with which he concurred the Dark Mark that night. He explained how he got to Hogwarts and how he killed his own father when he had escaped Voldemort’s hold on him.
Harry lets a soft curse slip over his lips. He still feels bad for setting Dobby free, now that he knows that Dobby was Draco’s lifeline when he goes home. But on the other hand. Dobby wanted to be free and Harry gave him that gift. But it hurts Draco, and everything that hurts Draco also hurts Harry.
“We won’t, dad,” Harry says. And he means it. If his father is this frightened of what Pettigrew could do to them. If he’s that scared that he will lose Harry and Neville if they go after Pettigrew, he won’t do it. He won’t hurt his parents or Iris. “But if he comes after us, I won’t let him live.”
The next morning an owl came to deliver a newspaper before we left for London to get all my school stuff. We took a train because Hagrid wasn’t allowed to do magic now he found me. I had to help him with the muggle money. Hagrid was knitting the whole way to London on something that looked like a canary-yellow circus tent. It looked really funny. And then in London, we went to the Leaky Cauldron. It was very weird. Everyone seemed to know who I am and wanted to shake my hand. I also met one of my professors. Professor Quirrell, he is the defence against the dark arts professor. He was very nervous. It had something to do with meeting vampires, I don’t really remember.
Later that evening, when I was brushing my teeth I remembered Myrtle’s story, about how she had died. She was in the bathroom and heard some boy say something in a different language. And when she opened the stall door she died instantly when she saw a pair of eyes. It must have been the Basilisk that killed her. She’s the girl that died fifty years ago. The entrance to the room must be in her bathroom.
