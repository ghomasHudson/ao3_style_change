Draco Malfoy is busy practicing writing his letters in his room when he hears a soft popping noise behind him. He looks up, eager to be distracted from the work his tutor has set him. There is a man in odd clothes standing in the middle of his bedroom, his wand drawn and a shimmering shield around him. He doesn't look scary or angry though, and when he sees Draco he drops the shield and puts his wand away with a smile.
"Diagon Alley door!" Pansy called out. No one answered. She hated when people kept knocking on the door and she was the only one home. It wasn't like she could just leave her hearth and open the door herself, so she just had to listen to the usually frantic knocking until either someone came home or the person gave up.
“Well. I was a- I played quidditch at Hogwarts and I know how to train pretty well without a broom. Do you have a snitch?”
His father’s eyes pierce his, and he attempts Occlumency as he was taught. “Yes, Father.” He feels a warm glow of pride when his father simply nods and turns back to his desk, dismissing him. If he'd failed he would have heard about it until they arrived at King's Cross, but now he can spend his evening relaxing instead.
“He clearly wants to be,” Draco grumbled. “I don’t think he’s even noticed that his curse scar is healing now.” He paused, staring at her logs with an unfocused gaze.
“We’ll- we'll need to discuss it more later, but first there’s something you need to see.” He got up and pulled Harry smoothly to his feet, leading him up the stairs and into the bathroom. Harry stood straighter than he had been since Pansy first saw him, now almost Draco’s height.
Draco lingers in the open compartment doorway. If what everyone’s saying is true, Harry Potter is sitting in front of him.
"I never thought I would be sent seventy years into the past either," Harry feels he has to point out. "And it has already gotten me detention for being out of my dormitory after curfew."
Harry shrugs. “I don’t really know yet. I think it may be the result of a curse. You know how I look like Harry?”
"Yes but, Harry, with the exception of you and this other person ages ago, no one has accidentally time traveled. It took the Unspeakables hundreds of years and cooperation with other Unspeakables around the world to formulate time turners that were safe for public use.
A few days after he set that particular platter in the shop window, he heard the potters gossiping about the poor man who’d bought it for his wife’s birthday, and had spread word that it was magical. Apparently when she used it to serve dinner to her family, the meager amount of food appeared to multiply in the dish, allowing everyone at the table to eat their fill. That night he fired a whole kiln full of those platters, with further instructions to glaze them identically to the first. Harry’s stepfather had been overjoyed, until many customers came back angry that their platters hadn’t magically filled with food as the gossip had said. But they hadn’t promised anyone magical pottery, just well-made pottery, and everyone could agree that the platters were well-made, so Harry wasn’t worried.
It was clear that Wizard Malfoy, for who else could it be, did not want him here. Instead of this making him want to leave, however, Harry became even more determined to stay. He decided that he wouldn’t leave until the wizard or Pansy removed his curse. He would become Wizard Malfoy’s problem for as long as necessary. Now he just needed an excuse to stay.
Harry has to admit that in all the conjecture about the meaning of his time travel, he's never considered that it might be trying to trick him.
“Nothing,” Harry declares, grinning now. “Nothing at all, I’m just happy to see you a-” Harry coughs and holds out his hand as if to shake Dobby’s. “My name is Harry. It’s a pleasure to meet you.”
“Well,” Draco begins dramatically. “First of all, I already know a lot of these. If Hogwarts didn't let mu-uhhh the
“I’m young!” Harry exclaimed, and hooked his elbow into Teddy’s, turning them around in a dance around the room.
"Upstairs," is all she responds. She levitates her’s and Ron’s supplies and marches up to the spiral staircase, leaving Harry to pick up his wand and quickly shove his books and parchment into his bag. He follows her silently all the way up, where they meet Ron on his way down.
"It will be very hard to prove," Hermione says. "He lived thousands of years ago; for all we know, you could be."
Harry nods as she pokes and prods at his jumpers, pants, trousers, socks, trainers, belts, pajamas, and robes. He had tried to bury his pants at the bottom of the pile, but Hermione is looking at his clothes like a particularly difficult wand movement and has spread them out for closer examination.
It's only about fifteen minutes later when Petunia hears another soft popping noise coming from the second crib. She gets up, reluctantly putting Dudley back in his crib, and sees that her nephew has returned. He seems fine, if mysteriously sticky, so she puts the incident firmly out of her mind and goes downstairs to make dinner before her husband comes home.
And this - something is very wrong. Draco pulls up his mask, the one he never expected to have to use in front of Harry, and uses the skills available to him.
“And I don’t blame you at all for that,” Harry continued. “We’re just scared of powerful wizards after what the Lord of the Waste did to us. You wouldn’t do that, and if you want, I can go back and spread the word that you’re actually a good wizard and not an evil one?”
Harry rolls his eyes, and Draco’s secretly glad he doesn’t mention it again. The whole period of time around there made Draco cringe. He’d requested a few months beforehand that Harry call him Malfoy, and Draco would call Harry by his last name, but Harry had refused both requests.
Harry glances between his dad and the dark haired man, confused. They share dark hair, but the other man is white and looks nothing like his dad. Was his father adopted? Was this other man?
"I got it from the closet. It was a little bent up, but I could tell that it was magical, and I fixed up some of the bent bristles."
If there are some less pleasant thoughts floating around his brain, that's purely his business. For the most part, he can push them back and tell himself that he's not even thinking them. It works for the most part until he comes across a scene that brings them all forward painfully.
"You look like you're about to keel over. I'm going to make you a cup of tea and you're going back to bed. Wherever you're going can wait."
“Of course, sir. Dobby understands. It’s just that, Dobby has come to tell you… it is difficult to know where to begin.”
“Mister Harry, sir.” It looks so strange, to see Dobby shaking anyone’s hand, but he knows this is also his insurance that Dobby will not mention Harry to anyone.
“This wouldn’t even be a problem if you weren’t here!” Draco yells, his anger at the situation and Harry exploding inside of him. “I don’t want you to visit me ever again!”
"Good, good. Now, I wanted to discuss the upcoming school year. I have taken the liberty of generously donating Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones for the Slytherin team, so you should have no problem obtaining a spot this year. I anticipate that your grades will not suffer while you are on the team."
Draco sits up slowly, knowing that Harry is already gone. He enjoys Harry’s visits so much, but every visit it’s that much harder to say goodbye, especially knowing that at some point Harry will stop visiting. He said last time that the final visit for years was Draco's first day at Hogwarts, and as much as he’s looking forward to Hogwarts, he can’t help but be sad that Harry will stop visiting.
"Headmaster Dippet would not have granted you the Award for Special Services to the School if he did not agree as well, and believe me, my boy, that will come in handy when job hunting!"
Harry grimaces at Ron, and then turns around to face the professor, whose limp is still noticeable even a few days after they noticed at Halloween.
,” Draco tells him. “Uncle Severus brought it for me this morning, so I can get ahead of the class.”
"I'm sure one of the professors in the stands knows how to slow his fall," Ron says, and Harry agrees.
He finally woke up enough to wash and decided it was time for a fresh bleach of his hair. He plucked the bottle of hair potion from its usual spot in the shelf next to the bath and thought nothing of it until he saw himself in the mirror afterwards. His hair was
"And I don't expect you will know," Flamel tells him, not unkindly. "Since it's outside of your purview. As the source of your knowledge said, it's a matter between myself and Professor Dumbledore. Now, shall I show you out?"
The man raises his eyebrows in surprise. “I didn’t realize--Well, my name is Harry too, and I’m going to be visiting you for a bit, just like the other Harry did.”
Down the long stretch of watery tunnel, Harry can see a small body lying prone, red hair splayed out. He runs toward it, flinging his wand aside to check that Ginny is still alive.
emotional harm,” he added with a nod. He repeated it all along the line of bowls, until he felt reassured that the wizard wouldn’t hurt any of the apprentices in his town. He himself didn’t feel any sort of danger from Wizard Malfoy, mostly because he thought Malfoy would have a hard time finding him, since he never saw anyone besides the potters and his stepfather, and occasionally his friends down at the bakery.
Hermione looks concerned. "You wouldn't know if you'd altered any timelines, Harry. That's the nature of the thing, in every case, including the Mintumble case, it's unclear what has changed. Mintumble knew who was missing from her old timeline, but no one else did. They had just simply never been born.
“We found out last term, but he's been doing it for ages,” Ron explains. “He doesn’t have any way to control it, and we didn’t want to worry you if he disappeared during breakfast or something."
"Hmm. I'm afraid I won't be able to help without more information. For example, were the laces of that particular shoe untied, or loose? Had you stepped on a piece of Droobles Best Blowing Gum? Was something different about the remaining shoe? Had you tied the laces around your ankle, did the laces come into contact with your skin at any point? Or you might have a limited number of objects you can bring with you. Think about that, and what might have been different from the time before."
"And your ability to talk objects into doing what you want has nothing to do with it, I suppose," grumbled Draco. He was still mad about Harry permanently fixing the drain in the bathtub by simply yelling "Drain, dammit! Do your job!" when Draco had been formulating a complex potion to keep the drain clear for months with no success.
He and Pansy had even made progress in untangling the Lord of the Waste curse, but for some reason it didn’t seem to be budging. Harry remained old no matter how much combined power they put into it. They rarely had time to discuss it amongst themselves, as Harry always seemed to be underfoot, and when he took an afternoon nap, Teddy was about, washing, drying, and chopping the ingredients that Draco had just harvested.
Harry takes a shuddering breath, trying to calm down. "Me too. C'mere." He pats the other side of his bed.
. Oh, and owl treats for Lyra, of course. I know I’ve been to Diagon before but it’s just so exciting this time.”
He wishes he was just a normal wizard. Not only is he a famous orphan who somehow defeated an evil tyrant, his scar and his skin color marks him as different even in the muggle world. And now he's hearing voices no one else can and speaking a mysterious language no one else at school seems to be able to.
Suddenly, all is quiet, and Harry is falling as if the chair has been taken out from under him. And it has - he finds himself lying on the cold stone of an empty corridor, his skin feeling perfectly fine again.
The room was eerily silent as the soup cooked, so that when a log popped loudly, Pansy hid beneath the pot, unwilling to see anyone's reactions. She focused her energy on heating the soup instead, eager to hear what would be discussed over dinner.
“Oh.” He looked shocked, as if he really hadn’t considered it. “Well, I guess tomorrow I’ll go to town to see my family and my friends, tell them I’m still alive, pick up that glaze, and then…” he looked between Draco and Pansy and Teddy, unsure of himself. “Probably get started on the bathroom?”
"The most notable case of documented time travel in public record is from 1899, when Eloise Mintumble used a time turner to travel back to 1402. She survived the travel back in time but became stuck there. They don't mention why, but it's almost as if her presence created a new timeline."
And then he hadn’t visited Draco again for a long time. Draco knew Harry didn’t control when and where he went, but when he did return a few months later, just after his ninth birthday, Draco’s magic wrapped Harry in a cocoon of blankets from the moment he arrived. Harry teased him mercilessly about missing him, and was still wrapped in one blanket when he left. The blanket had disappeared with him, and Draco presumed it was at Harry’s manor somewhere, reminding him of Draco.
Harry’s entire face lights up as he beams at Draco. “Malfoy? I mean, Draco? This is so-” he looks around the room again. “Sorry, I just wanted to make sure, sometimes I travel to the future, and you could have been your own son for all I know.”
In the seconds before Harry could turn around, damn his old bones, he pictured all of the objects in the room, trying to determine which one had spoken this time. Was the table sentient too? Something in one of those glass bottles? But no, as he turned he saw a new person who had entered the room. The man turned away as Harry met his gaze, but it was enough to see that he was beautiful. His pale eyes were lined with eyeliner as sharp as his richly embroidered suit and as smooth as the rainbow opals in his earrings and necklace. His white-blond hair framed his cheekbones and swished along his pointy jaw as he turned.
“I never had a birthday party until after I went to Hogwarts,” Harry says quietly. “I wish I could’ve gone to your birthday party today, I bet it was really fun.”
He doesn't want to believe it, but he knows Hagrid was expelled, and he's seen how Hagrid is with dangerous animals. Just last year, he hatched a baby dragon in his hut! If he found out about the monster in the Chamber, Harry could see him finding a way to free it, even if it was considered extremely dangerous.
Draco is working on his arithmetic when a soft pop tells him Harry has arrived. Thank Merlin, he’s so bored and his tutor is ill so she wants him to do double the homework until she is well enough to come back. He turns around with a grin and is about to say hi when Harry speaks.
Harry catches a few more glimpses of his parents and their friends, but he keeps having to dodge out of the way to avoid people lining up for the photo. Before he can convince himself to either approach them or not, he feels his skin wrinkling and disappears.
Wordlessly, Wizard Malfoy served the three of them bacon and eggs and poured some tea. The only acknowledgement that Harry had spoken was a raised eyebrow.
Harry looks up at Ron and Hermione. Both of them look as if someone has died, and he doesn't understand; he just told the snake not to hurt Justin, and it listened.
his father says. But no one has ever apparated into his room before, besides the house elves and Harry, and Harry hasn’t visited in forever. And this stranger is acting like he knows Draco, when Draco has never seen him before in his life.
“I forbid you from talking about this to anyone else, including Mother and Father,” Draco orders Dobby in his most Father-like voice as soon as Harry pops into his bedroom.
“Oh,” the man says, and stops, running a hand nervously through his messy black hair. “This must be the first time,” he mutters to himself. Draco takes the opportunity to memorize his face and any other defining features, in case he needs to describe him to the Aurors later. His hair is long, longer than Draco’s at any rate, and some pieces stand up like he’s just been out in a wind storm. He wears round, wire-rimmed glasses and his eyes are extra green, just like Harry’s. He's not wearing robes, and his trousers are rough looking and blue. He's wearing house slippers and something that could be a pajama top. It should be very distinctive if the Aurors need to catch him later. Draco feels he could describe him perfectly because-
Draco raises an eyebrow, hoping it looks as intimidating as when his parents do it. “You know who I am.”
“Harry,” Hermione says, ignoring Ron and his smirk. “Harry, how were you wearing these clothes? Was there anything different about how you wore them?”
Dinner is excellent, but Harry can only stomach one serving before declaring himself full. He and Ron stay back as everyone disperses again, and Harry still doesn’t know what to say. He's only ever shown people his ability before, and answered their questions after. What if she doesn't believe him? What if she sends him off to hospital?
And then a horrible thought occurs to Draco. "It's not, is it? Please tell me I don't marry Pansy in the future!"
For the first time in a long time, Draco isn’t happy to see Harry. It’s a hot, sunny day, and he’s just finished his schoolwork so he can play outside until the sun comes down. And since Harry is a secret, he either has to stay inside or leave Harry to play by himself in Draco’s room while he has fun without him outside.
His first thought is that this is a party -someone's birthday or wedding or some holiday- but as he listens to the witch and wizards nearest to him, he realises it's definitely not.
, but she has no way to contact him. From what she’s gathered from Lily’s excited rambles, wizards travel through fireplaces or thin air, and her fireplace is fake. She could send him some post but she doesn’t have his address, and she doubts they use the Royal Mail.
"I’m sure it’s not though,” he corrects. “You don’t look like you’re getting older anyway,” he tells Harry.
“I’m a time traveler. I travel to different places and times, and in my timeline, I’ve already visited you a few times.”
"After all," he continues as they walk through the gardens, "I know what your family's like, and we don't want you to waste away, do we?"
"No. I mean, I did see some Death Eaters, but it was definitely in the past." He doesn't mention that he's pretty sure his and Ron's parents were there. Time is ticking and they have to stop Snape. "I'm going to stop him."
“We light a small fire underneath,” Teddy pointed to the bottom of the cauldron with the bread knife.
“No way! You’re from the future! That’s so cool! Who won the last Quidditch World Cup? Father says he’s going to take me to the next one in England. Do you play quidditch? I’m going to be on the house team at Hogwarts when I grow up.”
"Yes, but Hermione, it all makes sense! He was the stranger that gave Hagrid Norbert, so he knows how to get past Fluffy now! That means that he could try to get the stone any time, and Dumbledore needs to know. If Snape gives the stone to Voldemort, he'll be immortal!"
Draco tries not to let his face fall in disappointment. "So you're not in love yet. That's okay, Mum didn't love Father right away either."
"You don't look so good, mate," is the last thing Harry hears from either of them before the rushing fills his ears and he finds himself elsewhere.
Harry pops into existence in the middle of what looks like a Potions class. He's not in any immediate danger so he takes stock of himself quickly: still under the invisibility cloak, which he's holding from the inside just in case, he's wearing both shoes, his belt is still on, he can still see clearly, and his wand is in his right hand. He takes a silent deep breath and grins. He's not sure what he's done differently this time but it's all gone as planned for the first time!
The sense of deja vu increases as he realizes this too happened when he was a child. His skin would do the horrifying thing, and then he would reappear somewhere else. He concentrates, trying to remember, but all that stands out is a child his age with bright blond hair, shoving a stuffed animal in his hands and demanding Harry play with them.
Harry comes back to the present and is immediately disoriented. There are bodies everywhere and he's in the invisibility cloak and- he dodges out of the way of a determined looking upper year Hufflepuff, and darts across the foot traffic to one of the suits of armor. If he stays here, tucked against the armor and the wall, he's fairly certain no one will run him over.
“You said we were friends,” he says, and tries to keep his voice from cracking. “But we’re not, we’re
Flamel told him about. Sure, with Ron and Hermione he helped defeat a mountain troll, but against an old competent wizard and Dumbledore, Harry knows he has no chance.
Teddy wasn't sure what Draco and Harry talked about the next morning, but Pansy told him it was "adult stuff" and he "shouldn't worry about it." He thought that was because she hadn't heard it either, but he didn't want to get on her bad side. Harry had closed off Pansy's listening device after her first comment on their conversation, and she was still burning the bacon in retaliation whenever he made breakfast.
"He's been spending too much time with you," Draco accused Pansy. "You used to respect me," he told Teddy.
"Whoa. Why is it in Hogwarts then? Why don't you have it? I mean, I guess you wouldn't know," Harry's face heats. Obviously neither of these men know what they're going to be doing so far into the future.
“I see, yes. You know, I think I liked you better as an old man. You’re much too cheery for me this way.”
“Right.” The cheery Harry of earlier was gone, and he and a subdued Teddy set the table and cut the bread.
"Yes, well somehow the Unspeakables were able to pull her out of 1402 after five days, which again, they don't mention." Hermione sighs. "But when they tried to bring her back to the present, her body aged as if she'd lived the entire five hundred years, and she died shortly after in St. Mungo's. She had altered the timeline even only staying for five days, and several people were un-born due to their ancestors' actions changing history.
Hermione stops talking to them for the rest of the week, only asking if either of them have found anything on Nicolas Flamel. Ever since Hagrid told them Nicolas Flamel's name, they've been searching for mentions of him in every book they can find, but they haven't had any luck so far.
Everything is silent for a moment, before the voice whispers, "Lumos," and the unknown man begins to walk, an odd cadence that suggests he might be injured.
“We just need to figure out what about that configuration allowed you to travel with your clothes. Oh, and maybe compare the two. Something about circles...oh, I wish there were more books about this subject. Maybe because you’re in a time...loop? Okay.” She moves on to the second outfit, eyeing it critically. “You really need to get clothes that fit, Harry. These jeans look like they could fit two of you.”
Both men have relaxed significantly, and seem to be taking him at his word. They both have a lot of questions about his time travel, and offer theories so complex that Harry can't follow.
By the end of the night, they've lost even more people: Hagrid is being sent to Azkaban and Dumbledore is no longer Headmaster. And they're no closer to getting Hermione back or figuring out who the Heir is.
Harry and Ron are on their way to Herbology when Harry feels the familiar itching spreading across his chest. He drags Ron into an alcove so that Professor McGonagall, who's escorting their class, won't notice them stopping right away, and pulls his invisibility cloak from his school bag.
"Show Mum or Father, and they and any of the house elves can test that it works. Then they usually Vanish it." He doesn't mention that Dobby has to Vanish his failed potions too - Father wouldn't like him to expose his failures to the world.
"My-" Harry's voice cracks. "My parents," he whispers, and he can feel the tears starting up again. He turns away. "I'm sorry I didn't find anything out," he mumbles into his pillow.
"What's going on?" Draco was zigzagging his way down the stairs in a way that showed he really had been sleeping. His usually crisp white shirt was rumpled, his hair uncombed, and his eyeliner smudged horribly.
He drew out a spell in the air in front of him, instantly sending all of the slime out the open back door to the Wiltshire gardens. Without meeting Harry or Pansy's eyes, he said, "I'll be home later."
When Harry opens his eyes again, Ron is gone, and Hermione is nervously tapping her quill against her leg, looking around anxiously. She jumps when he appears, standing in front of his chair.
"Right," Mrs. Weasley finally announces, setting her tea down with a clank, and glances over to the family clock. "I'm just going to get Dad to come back down, he's more of a mind for this than I do."
"So? I bet a lot of people can do it. I traveled to a boy over the summer who talked to his garden snake."
Draco pinched his nose, summoning patience. "Please come down and tell me where you got the broom." He readied a spell to catch him, but Harry landed smoothly.
Ron's eyes are wide as he stares at Harry's floating head. "What-it's happening? Have you got the circles?"
"No, not so helpful, that," Harry says. "I'll tell you about it later. We had loads of help from you, actually. Couldn't have done it without you."
They’re in the middle of playing Dragons and Tamers when he notices the silver ring on Harry's finger.
“A memory, preserved in a diary for fifty years.” Tom gestures towards the familiar diary, a few feet off.
Harry had snorted and set aside the issue of Teddy for the moment. “Ah of course. And you’ve never been frustrated by your potions ingredients sliding away while you’re busy at the cauldron, Wizard Malfoy?”
To his surprise, it took Teddy nearly a week to make any progress, and he resolved to circle back to find out what he'd been doing wrong.
Harry begins to follow the professor, trying to get a better look at the potions and the people so he can describe them later. It's one of the upper classes, sixth or seventh years maybe, and it's a combined Gryffindor/Slytherin class judging by their robes. It's clear that this professor also has a preference for Slytherin, and Harry wonders what it is about Potions professors that makes them so Slytherin.
A look Draco can't discern flashes across Harry's face, but then he grins and slides his wand into his back pocket. "What are you waiting for?"
Even when Uncle Vernon comes stomping upstairs to yell at him for making noise and to warn him not to make another sound.
"Yes. From what Harry's said, his detention was supposed to be eight o'clock tonight, scrubbing cauldrons. Well, from what I remember, about two weeks ago you had detention for no reason, with Snape, scrubbing cauldrons. So clearly, Harry traveled to the past and got in trouble, and he's already served his detention for it. It's just that he saw Snape two weeks ago instead of last night."
"Yeah, I'm still here.” He takes off the cloak. “It’s not working. I think we have to go visit Hagrid and ask him how he called the creature last time.”
"This is as good as it's going to get, I guess," Harry tells Ron, ignoring the mirror. It has never liked any of his clothes anyway. He grabs his invisibility cloak and stands before Ron in another hand-drawn circle, concentrating hard.
“Of course,” Draco continues, looking down at his school list, “I already have a cauldron, but I suppose I’ll be needing a new one, along with the rest of these. It won’t do to have hand-me-downs like the
must be the future he was talking about. He will be the great Harry Potter’s best friend. It’s just what he deserves as a Malfoy, but he still feels a thrill of excitement go through him.
Draco isn’t alone the next time Harry visits. Dobby is watching over him as he plays with his toy potion set. Luckily, Draco is prepared. After Harry left last time, he went through all of the possible scenarios like Uncle Severus taught him during potion making.
She watched him pull on one of the magical cloaks that gave him short brown hair and a full beard and take care of the customer, a man who needed a throat salve for his sick daughter.
“You forget that I know you in the future. At least now I know how you cheated. Alright, I’ll tell you which team caught the snitch, but I’m not telling you the score.
Draco grins at Harry, hoping he will be distracted by his joke and not mention that he had almost slipped up again and called mudbloods mudbloods in front of Harry. It's pretty much the only rule Harry has ever given him in their time together: Draco can slouch, slurp his soup, dance, make silly faces, and do whatever he wants that his parents never approve of, so he makes an effort not to say 'mudblood' in front of him.
When he awoke the next morning, he decided to start poking around before anyone else was up. To his left was the door he'd come in, with a dial next to it, each quarter marked with dabs of red, black, blue and green paints like a crude clock, with the green pointing down. The hearth in front of him was wide but poorly taken care of. It was clear the ashes were cleared only rarely and many bricks were blackened from the smoke. To his right was a door which appeared to be a small closet with a broom labeled
“I do remember. I’m sorry to say that I do not know much more about your power than I did then, although I still have many theories. Do you wish to tell me where you learned about Mr. Flamel?”
"I know," Harry says mildly. "I mean, it's only the second time I've done it. I accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Dudley -long story- but it was telling me it had never seen Brazil and I sort of set it free without realising it -that was before I knew I was a wizard-"
"Think up a new plan," he whispers back. "C'mon upstairs, I just got an idea. What if I try to travel to the future to get either the name of the Heir or mandrake roots? It's what you thought of before, but we never tried."
The boy, Tom, looked down with a little smile, his cheeks going pink. "It was nothing, sir, just doing what I can."
"Er, now that I have met you, sir, I wanted to ask, are you...are you already famous for something? Something dangerous maybe?"
- confirms who he is, and Draco introduces Vince and Greg by their last names before using his own full name. Maybe it will trigger a memory; Harry had visited Draco when they were toddlers, there’s a chance he still remembers although it’s fuzzy for Draco now.
“But did you find out what Flamel is famous for?” Ron asks on their way to the Great Hall. All three of them are hungry, and lunchtime is almost over.
A soft cough startles him and he whips around, finding two men staring at him curiously. Their wands are drawn but they appear to be waiting for him to make the first move. The older of the two looks fragile, with pale and wrinkled skin, shoulder length white hair, and pale robes, while the younger sports an older version of muggle clothing and a closely cropped graying beard.
friends. I've been trying to find, er, mentions of you in my textbooks, sir," he tells Flamel. "What year is it?" He's hoping that a year and a place will be enough to point Hermione in the right direction.
What he was doing wrong was simply not working. Draco gritted his teeth when he entered the manor to find Pansy crackling away on her own. She directed him onto the hills the manor was roaming, and Draco almost fell down in shock. Teddy was lounging in the field, cheering on a
"Why is it so bad?" Harry demands. "What is wrong with talking to snakes? Listen, if I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin-"
Mrs. Norris is hanging, incredibly still, there is a pool of standing water beneath her, and there is writing on the wall, in blood: THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED. ENEMIES OF THE HEIR...BEWARE. And worst of all, Harry and his friends are standing there staring at it when what seems like half the student body finds them after the feast.
Harry's mouth twitches like he's trying not to frown. “I really thought- but it is early days still and I guess I can’t expect…” he trails off, his eyebrows furrowing.
"See! You don't even believe you can take your wand, what makes you think- Wait, you don't care if when you come back, you fall hundreds of feet to the ground? You could die!"
Behind Harry, Draco was standing stock still, and Pansy couldn't decipher the look on his face. He certainly wasn't jumping for joy but then he hadn't for as long as she'd known him. Maybe he was just struck by the combination of Harry's good looks and the brightness of his eyes all at once for the first time.
That done, he turns back to H- Potter. “You’ll soon find out that some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.” Draco holds out his hand the way his father taught him - strong arm, steady gaze, firm grip.
"Oh I'm sorry, should someone have sent a half giant to your home to knock down the door and tell you you're a wizard?"
“Thank you so much, Great Dragon,” the man said, handing over a loaf of bread. “I’m sorry I can’t afford more right now…”
Pansy snorted out a shower of sparks, remembering, as she’s sure Draco was, when Teddy fell ill last year and had to be coaxed into even eating plain toast. It’s funny how he could clearly remember things like that, but still hadn’t gotten used to not having his father’s financial backing. A loaf of bread for two potions, whose ingredients alone outprice the bread, and they have three mouths to feed instead of the usual two. She sighed.
"T-thank you, love" the man says, patting him on the back. "You always did know just what I needed, didn't you?"
“Time travelers are only in books,” Draco responds. He knows the truth now that he is older; Father had told him last year. "Everyone needs time turns to do any kind of time travel."
"Dangerous!" the old man exclaims. "I suppose, in the wrong hands... You certainly won't be seeing it, if that's what you're asking." He narrows his eyes at Harry. "Who are you, really?" He raises his wand again and starts casting spells at Harry, several of which make his skin tingle.
“I was just wearing them like normal. Oh, except that first time, I put my laces around my ankles. It was one of the possibilities Dumbledore told me. But I didn’t do that the second time.”
"What about James though?" Harry couldn't help but ask. "She's in Montreal now. She'll be back in a month, then she'll have to go to some other country again. I wasn't against it at first, Mione, but... is that the best she can do for Jamie?"
Sure enough, in a haze of green smoke, from out of the fire came Ginny, eyes bright and blazing and looking expectantly at Harry.
"It should be. This was once the ancestral home of the Black Family, so I'm guessing you were probably here as a child."
"Well..." Ginny thought about it for a bit. "I definitely hope to get out of training with a recommendation to play professionally. It's the least they could do after all the effort I've given."
"Do you think your mother will be amenable to you going to France for six months?" he inquired with a lightness in his voice.
"We both know how you really felt about my father, Potter," he said with a wave of his hand. "No need for niceties when all the man wanted was to deliver you to his madman of a boss."
"I just mean, well," Narcissa took a deep breath before looking straight into his silver eyes. "What I mean to say, is that as your mother, I have been noting several signs, possible indications..."
"Well bully for those stupid fuckers, because they're not worth your time or attention if they can't get it around their heads just how great you are! I'm surprised this is even a problem, since we pretty much broke apart the old Ministry before putting it back together the right way." Harry swallowed, as everything seemed to click into place in his head. He was sure that Kingsley had pretty much gotten rid of the prejudice within the Ministry since he came into power. After seven years, Harry hadn't come across any hint of the old bigotry in the Ministry except among the Dark wizards they captured. Then he thought about Hermione's tendency to be highly pessimistic. Could she possibly be causing her own grief by unwittingly projecting her own personal doubts on the people around her?
"What do you - of course it's you!" Draco accused angrily. "The Aurors have their eyes on you, you bastard! They've been watching your every move since we found out who you were!"
"I don't want both of us to be so far away from our son, even for just one night," he quickly interrupted.
"It's just the magic drain," she said, perhaps knowing where Harry's thoughts had taken him. He bowed his head in embarrassment, but she continued. "They're ready to see you now."
It only took a half hour after that, and then the Breaking News Special Edition Prophet could be seen everywhere, detailing how one of the staff writers had personally witnessed the Savior of the WIzarding World with Ginevra Weasley. No photos, of course, but that was that. People couldn't stop talking about Harry and Ginny, Harry with Ginny, and Harry dating Ginny.
"Okay," said Harry, "I'll keep an open mind about that, but I can't deny that I'm not curious. You have to understand," he said imploringly, "I really didn't mean to be rude or whatever, it's just very different from what I've grown up with."
His mother laughed, her voice tinkling with the drops falling from the watering can. "It pleases me to do so, Draco," she answered. "Such simple pleasures make my day seem much more rewarding."
They were in the midst of a story based on one of the Weird Sisters' songs about a dancing hippogriff when Harry heard the Floo alarm from downstairs. Excusing himself (and leaving Teddy to conscientiously continue reading where they had left off), he leapt back to the lower level, all the while wondering what the call could be about. Long weekends were usually unbothered, especially this particular one when everyone was away and busy.
"There we go," Draco said easily, to Potter's confused face. "I was merely checking if the old you was still alive in there somewhere. You were making a good impression of a flobberworm that I feared I had lost you for a moment. Don't disappoint me, Potter."
Harry nodded his acquiescence. "We've agreed to be more responsible about it, and truth be told, we've both been busy anyway, so any... er..."
"I'm Teddy," the boy answered, his hair turning the same shade of silver as the man's before him. Malfoy took a step back in surprise, which made Harry's lips turn up at the corners.
"My nightmares went away gradually when I left for my Mastery," he said, his tone clarifying that the subject was being changed on purpose. "Astoria didn't have to deal with them ever, not like my mother had to."
"There is much left for me to do in order to rehabilitate our family from the mess that Father has carelessly dug us in. But I will not fail. As for the name, I fully intend to keep it and continue the lineage. No offense, Mother, but 'Black' would be such a bland name for me, don't you agree? And anyway, what would this world be without the one and only Draco Malfoy?"
Hermione's eyes started filling with tears. "I need to be good enough, Harry," she whispered shakily. "I was never good enough. In the Muggle world, sure, I was the weird nerd with the perfect record. But then at Hogwarts, I became the Muggleborn, the Mudblood… it's like no matter how much I achieve, just being me takes me back a hundred steps behind everyone else."
Weasley nodded. "It says here that rigorous magical testing has proven the cards to have been produced, processed, and sold exclusively in France. The parchment used has no Muggle derivatives to compromise the magical tests, and it's evident that the first card had never left French soil, which does narrow down our leads."
The training grounds of the Auror Corps took up a sizeable chunk of the Ministry. Being underground like all other Ministry offices, it took a lot of magical infrastructure to create a complex wherein Aurors and Aurors-in-training could hold classes, duels and all sorts of offensive and defensive spellwork. There were even rooms similar to the Room of Requirement, and Harry thought it was brilliant that they could stage mock attacks and create all sorts of possible scenarios that they would eventually face once they were Aurors.
"I already knew that," Malfoy said, his voice hoarse. Harry couldn't contain his own surprise at the admission. "The Minister saw fit to inform me of your particular kind of... evidence... to my defense."
At the tender exchange, which Molly had inadvertently witnessed from the kitchen door, the matriarch had broken into tearful sobs. "Oh, those just won't do!" she lamented, "The baby will need much more than just a cap and socks!"
The man merely cocked his head to the side as if trying to decide how to carefully say what was already on the tip of his tongue. Harry waited patiently, but when Malfoy said nothing, he decided to confront the awkward issue.
Draco frowned. "I know from personal experience just how messy this bureaucracy can be. Right after the war, Mother and I had to go through all the 'necessary channels' just to fix up the Malfoy accounts and estates, in addition to all the hassle of securing Father's treatment while in Azkaban."
When Draco followed her train of thought, he blanched. "Merlin! Nothing like that, Mother! I would never do that to Astoria!"
"Mr. Potter, Ms. Weasley, if you would," said the courteous Mediwitch, pointing to one of the doors behind her. To be honest, it annoyed Harry even more for the reminder that they weren't yet a married couple, but apparently on their second child already.
He knew that Hermione had done all she could to help him, and at such short notice, at that. But he couldn't help but grasp at the splinters of doubt that told him it was all mistaken, that the muggle methods had failed to provide any real information.
Harry's train of thought turned serious in a heartbeat when he sensed the undertone in Draco's statement. "It really bothers you, doesn't it? That I do this for you?"
: I won't go into detail. But it was the one thing Dumbledore taught me, to understand an enemy. That's how I defeated Tom Riddle. I think that's enough answers from me for now. I'm sure you have other things you want to ask about.
"Of course," Potter replied nonchalantly, as if the conversation hadn't just confirmed to Draco the extent of magical power he might be hiding in his very average-looking self. "I'd do anything to make sure that they were all safe. They mean too much to me."
"They're alright. Mum's just nagging Ginny about the baby, but that's been going on for the last two hours anyway so it's getting annoying."
"Ha! You plan everything out!" Pansy cut off his defense. "I know you too well, Draco, you've probably got this scene in your head playing out what you think should have happened and what should happen. Well, guess what," she looked at her perfectly manicured hands, "pregnancy is a bitch, and it's your first real look into married life. You'll love it, but you'll hate it. Stop focusing too much on your wife's faults and focus on making it easier for the both of you."
Ginny wiped away the tear tracks on Harry's cheek. "I love you," she whispered, voice still weak but eyes full of fierce joy. "Now say hello to our son."
Ginny's eyes filled with tears, but Harry knew they were for joy. Ginny never cried when she was sad, but oddly enough, she did when she was extremely happy and couldn't believe her own luck. His sudden proposition warranted such tears, and Harry brushed his lips on her forehead.
Hermione scrunched her brows and bit her lip, an expression that Draco knew from Harry meant she was going through information in her head at the speed of light.
After having Albus, the two of them had finally laid out their plans to the entire Weasley clan. Harry and Ginny had long agreed that he preferred to be more hands on with the children, but wanted to keep working as an Auror. Meanwhile, Ginny herself also appreciated time with them, though admittedly couldn't yet give up on her dream of representing England again in 2010 (her having to miss the 2006 World Cup due to the pregnancy). They decided first, between themselves, that while Albus was under two years old, they would maintain the same living arrangements, though Ginny would have her own separate room in Grimmauld Place. Harry kept his flat, though hadn't yet thought to move back in. Actually, if he were honest with himself, the move back to Grimmauld Place, (though done for particularly melancholic reasons), was perhaps the best decision he had made for his family. The space seemed so much more perfect for the sudden extension of his life.
Draco couldn't help but roll his eyes. "Perhaps it might be because of the threat to our lives? Or is that too trivial to be taken seriously?"
At his expression, Potter chuckled good naturedly. "Apart from Ginny, Ron and Hermione, I've also included Neville, Luna and the Weasleys."
"What was that about?" Ginny asked, her eyebrows high on her forehead as she stared at Malfoy's disappearance through the Floo.
Weasley, turning 20, is obviously the youngest player in the entire 2001 roster, but has nevertheless impressed even her most hateful hecklers with an amazing record of 26 successful goals out of the 29 that the Harpies scored in all, and in her first professional match at that. Interviews with the team confirm that she has put in the same amount of hard-work and commitment in her training. O'Finnicks was quick to add, "This has absolutely nothing to do with her private relationships. Weasley has always been a marvelous Chaser, and her record speaks for itself. Don't even attempt to mention anything about Harry Potter pulling strings, unless you want a noseful of bats in your face."
"You mean like the suspect is waiting for a reaction?" Perkins asked. "Like it's a question, and they're waiting for an answer?"
"Albus Severus," she whispered, and Harry's eyes both lit up and became very wet with tears at the same time. He remembered all the talks they had had over naming their second son, and this was one of the best gifts that he could ever think of.
Still, he refused to wallow. He knew that his and Ginny's situation was difficult, but they had had that routine for years, and only James had called for cause to change it up. Harry remembered Dumbledore's words, how it is one's choices that make them who they truly are. He had made promises to Ginny, and she to him, and both of them to James, and they had agreed to do everything they could to work it out without having to sacrifice so much of themselves in the process. It was more difficult than, say, Ron and Hermione. They had two children between them, but they managed because of some help from Molly and Arthur. Harry had too much pride to ask for Molly's help too often, and he took pride in knowing that he himself was caring for his son. It didn't make him any less lonely, though.
are... dictated by the limitations of the stability and interaction of the magical cores involved..."
To his credit, Malfoy didn't make a big deal out of it. "I'm fine, Ted, and so is Scorpius. We should be careful next time, though, alright?" he said gently.
He caught sight of Ginny, looking slightly harassed, trying to soothe James and stop him from bawling like a Mandrake. She saw him walk into the sitting room, the panic evident in her eyes.
"I'll take care of it, sir," she assured Harry, "I've still got that friend in Legal, I'm sure she can expedite the process. It's an emergency, after all."
"It's stupid," the redhead answered. "I can't believe it. Auror Stone is insisting we take care of this stupid paperwork, despite the obvious crisis that Harry is facing right now."
His best friend came running back into his view, face splotched with panic and fear. She didn't even have to explain. He knew his instincts had been correct.
"You know what hurt even more, Harry?" she sniffed, interrupting him. "That Malfoy was here, obviously not on purpose, and yet he still fit in more than I did. Fucking Malfoy, Harry! And why is he suddenly part of our wards! What made you suddenly decide that he should be aware of James! James is ours, Harry, he's our baby!"
This time, Draco felt ashamed. "I'm here, though," he said, trying not to sound too disappointed in case Harry decided to kick him out or something. "Don't mean to intrude or anything…"
Harry understood exactly how that felt. Every additional second it took was a delay in finding Draco. He knew he had to wait for the accurate coordinates. But that didn't mean he had to like it. Why did it have to take so bloody long?!
On that strange note, Draco put together his scattered impressions and tried to build a clearer picture of what this night's conversation was all about, because he really hadn't seen it coming.
Harry knew that while Arthur Weasley had agreed with Ginny regarding the belated wedding, Molly had remained adamant on arranging their bonding ceremony as soon as possible. Since they'd announced the pregnancy to the family a couple of months ago, Molly had taken to confronting them individually whenever she could, berating them about the consequences of their final decision.
"In that case, how about a stronger drink then?" Draco suggested. "The boys are all asleep, it's not even midnight yet and neither of us have anywhere to be, so… What say you?"
: Shut up, Ron. Anyway, I was a bit surprised, but then I figured that it was another chance for me to do even more, to be more involved with the important cases.
Draco nodded, turning away and focusing on the way Scorpius was playing with his slender fingers. "I don't want to waste my time cozying up to whoever is gracing Portugal with their holy presence -"
"Yes, but you've just given me a short list of your closest friends. They're practically family. That makes sense. But me..." He faltered, not knowing where he was going with his argument. Why was he against this idea? He would gain extra protection. He could have Astoria, Narcissa and Scorpius all under Harry Potter's protection.
"I know that I'm not exactly in the running to be mother-of-the-year," Ginny said sadly, "but I really do want to be here for them, but I don't know what else I can do."
"You know...I think I finally see what's wrong here," Harry said slowly. "Thing is, you've gotta figure it out on your own. It can't come from me." Finally Harry moved back but kept staring at her, waiting for a reaction. She had none. It kind of unnerved him. It felt weird, him saying so much, and her saying nothing at all. Talk about tables turned.
"I see," his mother all but purred behind him as they walked towards the sun room that Narcissa and Astoria seemed to love so much. "And how has your time with Scorpius been?"
"What else must be done?" Narcissa asked impassively. "The three of us have provided our blood and a reading of our magical aura. You have also taken the same from Scorpius," she said, gesturing towards her sleeping grandson.
"It might be," Ella replied gently. "I used to work with Tracking before moving to MMI, so I know how thorough their process can be. All I've been able to submit for their analysis were the two cards and the envelopes they came in, but at least we now have a narrower frame of reference."
Luckily his subordinates were supportive of the idea that both Head and Deputy Head were such loving family men, and eagerly volunteered for enough work load to give Harry and Ron enough time to concentrate on their private lives. This was highly appreciated, of course, especially since Harry had both Teddy and James to take care of that week, since Ginny had gone back on her regular training schedule on James' eighth month. She made it a point to come home every night instead of just the weekend, as it was the best compromise she and Harry had agreed on. Thankfully, Molly and Andromeda were always ready to help during those weekd when Harry still had to go to work during the day.
: Well, it's been quite amazing. Harry and I basically jumped into the Auror Corps straight after the war, and we did our training for about a year and a half. You'd think after winning a war that it would be a quick cleanup, but no, we've actually had to work hard tracking down some nutters who claimed to be working under Voldemort.
It had taken months of toil, of winning her with the right kind of thoughtful gifts, of exchanging witty banter. Of lowering his pride sometimes, of impressing her family, and gaining her trust. More importantly, it took most of that time to properly negotiate the possible future with her, to ensure that they both had a clear goal in mind. If they were to be allies, as was the desired point of view amongst traditional purebloods, they needed to establish their connection and project it into the future. The strongest marriages were the ones that developed from a steadfast alliance and grew into a deeper understanding. Draco saw that in his parents when he was young, and he desired it for himself.
The smug kidnapper gave no response, merely content with watching Draco. The blond decided for a different approach.
"I am thankful for my recent realizations," Draco admitted. "Spending time with, er, less traditional individuals, has opened my eyes to issues which I might have missed or deemed insignificant had I continued to blindly follow the rigid pureblood ways.
That, he thought, was most likely the crux of their problem. He leaned back into the couch, little James cooing in his lap, and waited for Ginny's scheduled Floo-call.
He was surprised when Hermione's eyes shone with tears but her smile seemed to become even bigger and warmer. "Thank you, Draco, oh thank you, we'll owe you for this!"
Harry chuckled. "Thank you for telling me. Though, I've got to admit, as much as I enjoy our occasional emotional exchanges, it's starting to feel a bit too maudlin."
"It's not that bad. Kingsley was pretty lenient, I mean, not everyone gets to work from home. I get to spend all day with James, so it's not like I'm wasting away my time at work."
Draco could find no will for a scathing remark or a sarcastic snarl. Without a word, he shook off Hermione's comforting touch and stormed off towards his private study.
Draco shook his head. "She's attending a ministry function in France this week, and my mother has taken Scorpius for the day."
"I fucking hate this!" Both Ron and Hermione stopped their argument at Harry's sudden outburst, which may or may not have caused several of the lights to flicker. The brunet just scoffed. "Only I have the luck of having the most powerful fucking privacy ward, and having it fail in the most inconvenient way, and humongously public at that."
He shuddered, which prompted Harry to refill his drink. The steam, which floated visibly between them as Draco sipped, seemed to help ease both of them.
"Is something the matter?" Draco felt that he sometimes worried too much, something that Pansy accused him of at every opportunity, but he felt justified when it concerned his child. Astoria seemed to be staring at the wall, as if refusing to meet his eyes.
Harry had never imagined such a day to come, but there they were, Potty, Weasel and Ferret putting their heads together (though metaphorically for Malfoy, who still could not be seen to be working with them). Malfoy's decision to return only after a fortnight had much to do with the discovery of an old wizard's corpse. Once again, the diagnosis was consistent with the other murders that were piling up under this mysterious potions case, and Kingsley himself had told Harry that most of the Ministry had grown dependent on the skills of his department, that they were awaiting for the day that Harry's team would finally get the arsehole who was causing so much trouble. As if the pressure hadn't been enough yet.
When a corner of Potter's lip twitched, Draco knew that he was on the right track. "Now, how about you start acting like a real Gryffindor, and be all brash and loud and impulsive while I play a quiet and understanding Hufflepuff and listen to all your woes?"
"Did you really not think we would at least contact you about this?" Harry decided to ask bluntly. He wanted to know what went on in Malfoy's Slytherin mind that a surprise call from friends left him so ruffled.
He sat, expecting a reply, or at least a biting remark, but Malfoy just looked at him with a raised brow.
"We know each other so well, Gin," he said, "and I've come to realize that you're really happiest when you're up in the air and chasing a Quaffle."
"Mate, you've gathered more information from that piece of parchment in half a day than my team did for the last four weeks. Looks like I made the right call."
Draco couldn't help but let out an uncharacteristic guffaw. It was always ironic for him that Potter was the Savior of the entire Wizarding world, but it was still so easy for wizards to doubt his sanity.
Draco shook his head. "I usually sleep in on Saturday mornings, so it's nothing unusual. I'm sure my wife is still asleep as well. I choose not to work on weekends either, so it's not like I have to force myself to get up."
With a bounce in his step, Draco took the shortcut to the library, intent on showing his mother the proof of his success.
The redhead warily turned to him, giving him a weak smile. Her freckles stood out even more today, because her skin was pale and clammy. "Hey," she said. "So I've got news."
"I'm surprised you can joke about it, especially since we've found how… dedicated… this person is proving to be." Harry couldn't avoid lacing his statement with the worry that had been plaguing him since this all started. "I hope Narcissa has at least calmed down. I haven't heard from her since that random Floo call, so I guess that's a good sign."
She gave a smile and went on to try to fix James' hair. "He definitely got this mop from you," she said accusingly at Harry. "I've tried every grooming Charm and it won't stay put!"
Going to and from the Ministry was beginning to get old. Draco had already accepted this unfortunate event to be part of his routine, but he couldn't help but be exhausted from it. The monthly visits to the DMLE were required by his probation, in order for him to be evaluated repeatedly and ensure that he wasn't up to something sinister. Presently, he had two more months left to his probation, and he was surprised to receive a summons to meet with the Minister himself.
"Sorry, Auror Weasley, Auror Potter. These just got archived. Higher ups say they prefer you keep the originals."
, Draco mused with a little smile. He wouldn't admit it to either Potter or Weasley, but a part of him greatly missed the challenge of working with the MMI. Sure, he was now better acquainted with his old enemies, and secured a higher position (albeit highly secret) in the DOM, but he realized that nothing could ever replace the rush of adrenaline as they put their heads together and raced against time to save lives. Having constant correspondence with Potter wasn't as bad as he had thought, either.
Was it a good thing that his wingman was a boisterous eight year old Metamorphmagus? Probably not, but Harry couldn't care less. Because it was Reading Time and both of them looked forward to it, as they always did.
" Harry exclaimed. "Maybe that's how your world works, but not mine, and I'm telling you to quit thinking like we're in one big monopoly game. I'm not going to suddenly call in a debt or whatever, that's just stupid-"
"She's usually here," the shop assistant said conversationally. "Comes by often enough to be remembered by the assistants here."
"Okay, then," Potter stood up and brushed off his trousers. "Thanks for all the information." The tone was that of finality and for a second, Draco felt as if he were being abandoned somehow. However, he turned his gaze to Potter's emerald green eyes and
Draco merely nodded, afraid that his voice might betray his panic if he had spoken his answer. He cleared his throat, then bowed once again to their guests. "If I may," he said as politely as he could while hiding his sneer, "I would like to retire to my suite, as my international Portkey has left me feeling exhausted."
Molly seemed to see that they had come to the same conclusions. "You see, Harry," she said. "My daughter knows what she wants, and how to reach it, but she also understands herself to know how to make it her source of happiness, of achievement. I'm afraid," and she dropped her voice to a whisper here, "I'm afraid that Hermione is pushing herself too hard for all the wrong reasons, and it's poisoning everything and everyone around her. I believe she knows what she wants... but she's not sure why she wants it, or why it isn't making her as happy as she'd thought..."
Of course, even he knew that there was a very narrow, possibly non-existent margin of error when it came to Hermione and research… Which then prompted him to start worrying about Scorpius even more. It didn't help that he had essentially isolated himself in his barricaded study, but he couldn't really face the facts just yet. Not when his son was concerned.
"...and with the combined magic of thy Father and Mother shalt thou, Scorpius Hyperion, enter this Earth to live out thy life in..." Narcissa's voice was also full of excitement, but not as much as Draco's when he felt the tug from his magical core, which meant that the Naming ritual was almost over.
"You remember those days," he said bitterly, looking straight into Harry's eyes. "I was torn between what I thought my Father wanted, and what I thought was right. I was so confused. It was when I found myself alone, without friends, and without my family with me, that I realized I didn't want to dig myself into a deeper grave like - like Father did. You asked how it was when he - when he died. Well, Mother received an owl from the Ministry that he had passed away in his sleep. He just never woke up. I expected to feel angry or furious, or hell, even relieved, you know? But… I looked at Mother and she looked at me and there was just this… this deep sadness for what happened to the great Lucius Malfoy. It's been almost two years, and still… still I ask myself if I still hold the same ideals that he once ingrained into me. I've worked so hard to come out of his shadow, but every day I fear that I might hold myself against the same strict standards he had for me. I know I'm a grown wizard, and a successful one at that. But sometimes… I don't know… I ask myself if what I've done will ever be good enough for him. Even when he's gone."
Draco felt no pang of insult, however, despite the obvious snub. He had known Daphne from Hogwarts after all, and they had merely been yearmates in school. Not even a friendship had blossomed over the years, and Draco couldn't care less. He had always gotten along better with Pansy anyway. Daphne had been quite the cold bitch, if he could remember.
: When you try to learn about your enemies, when you try to see why and how they did what they did, or why they think that way, you understand them much more. Because of that, it becomes possible to arrange more proactive measures in security, track down accomplices, or even prevent the crimes they've already planned. The Aurors in my office learn what to expect from the dark wizard, how he uses his magic, and we get to use that information against him.
Draco shrugged. "I'd keep it that way, if possible. I mean, I wouldn't want Weasley or Granger to be privy to all the embarrassing things I've already admitted to you. Unless you want them to know about all that shit you ranted last time…"
"Well, thank you then for the warm and fuzzy version of your friendship," he quipped lightly, and was promptly surprised at the slight frown on Malfoy's face at his words. "What?"
Draco had no words to that. He had no idea that all of his reports were sent to the Minister himself. They had been simple interviews, which admittedly had grown into a tentative civility with his Aurors, who provided him with interesting conversations in the midst of asking him the routine questions. He thought it was just protocol that he needed to complete throughout his probation, not something that people would actually go through and read! Suddenly he had way too many questions to ask, and no idea how to begin.
Draco realized that this was the first time that Potter had really ever talked about his fiancée. He knew that Ginevra had been away for just as long in Asia, around the time when they were busy with the MMI case. "And you hate it?" he guessed. "That she's leaving?"
Draco shook his head in amused disbelief. "Of course I'd rather spend my time with my own flesh and blood than play masquerade with strangers who could care less about me beyond my social standing. I've experienced the ideal pureblood childhood, as did she, and I am quite sure at this point in my life that I didn't quite appreciate how much I was missing back then. I refuse to make the same mistake to Scorpius, especially now that I understand what a difference it can make for Astoria and me to be more... present."
When he got there, Narcissa immediately flicked her wand towards the double doors, sealing them within her suite.
Ginny shook her head. "Maybe for now, sure, but… what about in the future? What if… well, I'm sure we'll have to reassess our living arrangements when we'll both need to have our own space again."
Draco caught a guilty look flash on Potter's face. "Actually...I learned well enough when I was seven. Or maybe eight? I'm not exactly sure though, to be honest."
"What can I do to get rid of your irrational fears?" he finally asked, weary of the discussion already.
Harry felt proud that the effort he and Andromeda had been putting in teaching Teddy some basic ethical principles was now showing,
He sat up and blinked, memories of last night coming back to him. "Oh, Merlin," he swore aloud. He wasn't exactly sure what he'd divulged to Malfoy. Malfoy of all people in the magical universe!
Ron nudged him again, nodding towards the crotchety witch in front, who had finally stepped off the podium. With a jolt, Harry realized that it was his turn to speak, and he nervously approached the space that the witch had vacated. Despite having done this quite a lot in the last two months, he still found that he was trembling. This time, however, it was because he actually had something worthwhile to say, and he fully intended to make sure the entire magical population would listen.
The two Aurors were currently in the process of giving him a thorough briefing on the case. To the outside world, it was just one of the owners entertaining a couple of friends at his pub. But that was only because of the extensive list of privacy wards around themselves, of course, combined with the
"It's one of the more difficult things about loving someone," Harry said nonchalantly. His thoughts strayed to Albus Dumbledore and his mutterings about the greatest power.
Harry slumped his head onto the table again, groaning. He was definitely not looking forward to that family meeting.
"Oh, relax," he chided her. "I went out with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley last night, and we all ended up at Potter's. Neither staying over nor sharing breakfast were part of the plan, but we all got carried away with the alcohol."
For someone who had gone through what he did in the last few months, Draco Malfoy didn't look the part. In fact, despite his circumstances, he had made it a point to appear even more well kempt than before. His eyes shone with an icy brilliance, and his silky hair glowed in the light of the moon. Only his pale face betrayed the nightmare he had just woken up from.
Harry sighed. "Look, I don't want to have either of you feel like you need to take sides, but.. I just wanted to talk to you first. I haven't even thought much about... everything that's happened."
Apparently, being touted as heroes had perks, and since Harry had an Order of Merlin, First Class, and Ron and Hermione had Second Class, they were presented with the privilege of furthering their career immediately. It meant that they could bypass the necessary requirements such as N.E.W.T.s and years of experience. The trio, of course, could sense the underhanded attempt of the Ministry to keep them under its influence, as well as bolstering its own popularity with the association.
Hermione raised an eyebrow. "You're still a patriarchal arse, Ronald," she said teasingly. "I agree with Harry, having elves care for your children are a bit too much."
Truth be told, Draco was actually doing his best to rile up his ex-nemesis again to try and get him out of his passive-aggression, but it was to no avail. Hearing such self-deprecation from someone he had once hated was more painful and pathetic than he had expected. And he hated it, hated hearing such weakness from someone he had once resented and admired at the same time.
He was in the fucking tower! Draco immediately thought back to that dreaded memory he had tried in vain to forget. The first feeling that flooded him was shame. Then guilt. Then... what? Annoyance? Anger? The thought that Potter had been there with him after all changed the way he felt about it. Was he relieved that there was at least one person who had seen him drop his wand to Dumbledore, seen that he didn't have the heart after all? Or was he outraged that his enemy had seen him, twice now, in a moment of extreme weakness and failure? His hand subconsciously went to his chest, fingering the scar that was invisible to all but him.
The idea seemed to relax Potter a bit; his shoulders were no longer held as stiffly as earlier. In fact, there was a hint of a laugh in Potter's eyes despite the slight frown still on his features. However, he didn't seem to have much to add, or perhaps he had lost the motivation to speak in sentences, so Draco decided to move the conversation onwards.
Kingsley smiled, a warm and genuine one that broke Draco's lapse in judgment, and he finally closed his mouth. "Is this really - I mean - really?!" he asked inarticulately.
Malfoy's sharp tone took back Harry's attention a few seconds too late. He realized what he'd unthinkingly blurted out, and he mentally punched himself. He looked at Malfoy, gave a little half-shrug (he was doing a lot of shrugging today) as if he could discard the unwanted topic like an old jumper, and busied himself with cleaning up, sending pots and pans to the sink with his wand.
Potter merely gave an enthusiastic nod in agreement. "I remember, it was all dark corners and creepy shadows all around. That's why I demolished two of the walls there-" he pointed, "so it opened up this space more. I also updated the kitchen to accommodate both magical and Muggle appliances so I could use it efficiently."
"Draco, you've probably studied about the elements and their role in chemistry," Hermione began. He nodded. "DNA is similar, but more of a biological science. Specifically what we call Genetics. In a nutshell, imagine that every living thing is made up of tiny little cells. In each cell, there is an embedded code that is unique to every living being, and it is this set of genes that dictates what or who it is and how it grows and develops. They act as a blueprint, and contains highly unique information about the individual it pertains to. It is even possible to trace biological lineages for several generations. It is such for muggle humans, and I'm guessing it's the same with witches and wizards, too."
Draco felt his heart stop. Maybe they finally had enough to move forward and find out the identity of the person harassing him. "Is it a lead?"
"Mother, Astoria and I have long since agreed that I've grown tired of such parties." He scowled. "I was willing to do it for the last few years to help our family regain its social presence. Now that we are in an even better position, I don't see why my wife can't keep doing exercising her commendable diplomatic skills without my cool indifference to hinder her."
Narcissa's expression closed off for a second, then warmed again, She really did have quite a warm relationship with Lucius despite being arranged as well. That was up until he had ruined their lives with his mad desire to follow the Dark Lord, but Narcissa was above blaming him for that. Despite denouncing him publicly, she could agree with the desperation he had clung to on the last days of Voldemort's coup. They had gone through that hell together, as husband and wife, both looking out for their son.
His mother saw his expression as he sat down opposite her, and she guessed correctly at his thoughts.
"Er..." He had no idea what to say, given that he had just literally broken down in tears and was interrupted by an archenemy-turned-mate. "Why?" he asked hesitantly.
Draco was at a loss for words. Perhaps he really should have owled his mother first to avoid such embarrassing situations. He had no desire to interrupt what must be another of her social calls, which he had always hated when he was much younger. Even as a man, there was something about being coddled by his mother's acquaintances that made him feel oddly inadequate.
"It seems, er, a lot less scary in here," Draco managed to say out loud before he could stop himself. The alcohol had really gotten to his head, he thought.
Hermione was confused. She frowned at Draco, as if it were his fault that she had never heard this before. "What do you mean?"
"Nothing much, but…I was wondering if I could come through and we could just - perhaps talk and while away the time? Are you busy?" the blonde asked quickly.
"No, same old Slytherin git," Harry said with a shaky laugh. "So that means he didn't get dosed too recently, right? I mean, theoretically, if whoever had given him the potion had lost their supply since we got the Eilert brothers, it would've caused a severe behavioral change. Total withdrawal."
Of course, Harry knew that they were no longer fighting in reality. Then he saw that Dream-Malfoy had morphed once again, now appearing to be no older than eleven. When he looked down, Harry saw that he himself had somehow become skinny and scrawny once more. He felt his dream-self drop his wand as well. "I don't want to fight anymore, either."
He flung Draco's letter onto his desk and brought his attention back to the memories he was preparing for the Pensieve. "Two weeks," he muttered to himself. "Just two more weeks..."
Draco realized she was partly right. Out of habit, he would analyze and overanalyze and reanalyze, if that was even a word.
"And you would know?" Draco said without thinking. His heart stopped for a millisecond. Would Potter let slip something more about his own secret, or-?
The thought of holding back wasn't even an option. For the rest of the night, he allowed himself to lay everything out to his old enemy.
Harry laughed even harder at the memory of him knocking on Draco's Floo in the middle of the night a couple of months ago, drunk and beyond reason, just to rant violently about a row he'd had with Ron and Hermione. Sure, they were his best friends, but Draco definitely got an earful of colorfully descriptive adjectives in the process. That he didn't repeat a single insult to either Ron or Hermione when they made up meant more to Harry than anything.
"As for the invitation to apprentice in France, well that was a surprise as well, but something that I immediately approved, given your academic records in Potions and your personal endeavors at Malfoy Manor. I hear your brews are of such high quality and up to the standards of even St. Mungo's."
"Thank you for telling us, darling," he said softly, whispering in her ear. "I'll get right on it and tell the MMI. You should go and rest. We can spend time with Scorpius later, perhaps that will help to think of other, happier things in the meantime."
Harry thought ruefully as he leaned back behind his desk, watching Ron's somber expression from across the office.
Harry nodded. "And we all know from working with all the mind maps over the years... sooner or later, a criminal will become careless and get himself caught."
Draco attempted to keep his face straight as he recalled all the 'Call of the Pint' talks. He felt his lip fighting to curl up and it took all of his self-control not to let it show. "I wouldn't know," he sad off-handedly.
On the contrary, even Malfoy's disposition had become... sunnier (if that were even possible on such a sharp face as his). Now that they had Scorpius and Albus, they were able to relate with each other more than they had ever expected. And during their lively exchanges, Harry always learned something new and interesting about his former enemy.
Hermione laughed delightedly. "Oh yes, there is that," she mused. "Ron and Harry confessed to me that they'd had to resort to hitting the pubs more often just to offset what they claimed was me and Ginny 'going barmy'."
The late afternoon sun touched upon the edge of Harry's desk, forcing him to squint at the glowing curtains in frustration. He hadn't even realized until then that he had wasted away all of the daylight hours with his head bowed down, shuffling through piles of paper for his latest case.
"Enough, Gerard," Astoria scolded, finally turning toward her partner. "I still do not understand why you had to go this far. Everything was fine until you started sending the threats."
The redhead, bless him, merely rolled his eyes at Harry's outburst. "I meant, if you think the person who poisoned Malfoy is the same one giving the threats?"
Ron looked aghast at Harry's calm demeanor, but didn't say anything. Harry knew that it was a difficult position for his best mate to be in - caught between his best friend and his sister. He had thankfully grown past his teenage urge to implode and rant impulsively, which meant that he was still probably coming up with the appropriate response.
"I also have plans for you, Draco," she said gently. "I promise not to be as overbearing as your Father in this regard, but for your own future and well-being..."
Harry nodded his understanding. Alright. We've got everything to get this approved by tonight. I'll call when it pushes through."
Harry let the change of topic go. Ginny had always thought that he would want to be in charge of his life the moment things settled after the War. To be honest, though, Harry had wanted stability. He wanted a home. He wanted something permanent and reliable. The
"What?" Harry asked, huffing. "You didn't think we were being sincere about our reasons? I don't know if I should be offended, or..."
"Go ahead, Potter," the mad said noncommittally. "It might be something important for them to need to visit at midnight."
Malfoy nodded politely at their acknowledgment and tentatively approached their booth. "What brings you law enforcers here?" he asked, all small talk and none of the venom that may have been exchanged only years ago. "I didn't think your crowd would appreciate small haunts like this."
"I gave them the memories to make sure my statement was airtight," Potter continued. "Then I specifically told Kingsley not to tell you."
"What's wrong?" he demanded, moving closer to the hearth, drowsiness and sleepwear forgotten. "What's happened?"
Also, Harry made all sorts of reasons just so he didn't have to acknowledge that he liked Malfoy telling him what to do and how to do things. Because it wasn't true. Not at all.
Sure enough, Kingsley gave a curt nod, schooled his features into what Harry called his 'official face', and addressed the assembly in his deep, booming voice.
"Like I said, Potter, you are unfortunately the only living being to truly understand me. I had a moment of... weakness... and I... I needed someone who wouldn't judge me for being overwhelmed. I thought... of all people... you wouldn't judge me for anything."
"Harry?" Ginny's voice carried through the hallway and into Harry's study. The sound made James stir from inside his bassinet, and Harry called out, "in here!"
"Harry, dear," she whispered, eager to keep Hugo sleeping in peace. "Andromeda Floo'd me just last night, asking if either of us could watch Teddy for a couple of days.
His kidnapper took the last few steps until his face was finally revealed from the shadows. He had a hard look about him, features stony and roughly hewn, expression gritty and menacing. He meant nothing good. Draco at least was smart enough to admit the fact, and his last hope was to somehow stall whatever the man's plans were until help came.
Ron shrugged. "You see, Malfoy, very few Muggles follow the concept of arranged marriages. Hermione tells me that most of them marry for love."
"Then they would find a way to provide for that specific diet," Malfoy replied smoothly, before cocking an eyebrow up at his guest.
Harry nodded, playing absent-mindedly with James' chubby fingers. Ginny reached over to run her fingers through her son's hair. "Did you spend the morning with James?"
"Harry's new status, of course!" Percy said exasperatedly. "Honestly, Ron, how thick can you get? Harry here is the number one Hero and recognized in all magical communities around the world, he's one of the reasons some gossip rags are even running despite the trash they print, and suddenly he's called up the invocation that will prevent outsiders,
In a way, Harry already knew what was coming next, and he didn't know if it was a good thing that he was calmly prepared for it.
When Ginny remained quiet as if to formulate her argument, Harry melted into the couch feeling helpless. "What do you even want, Gin?" he asked softly, weakly. He felt defeated. "Be honest. Do you still even want to marry me? Do you want to be with me? Do you want this for the rest of your life?"
"This from Tracking?" the redhead asked without looking at Ella, not that he waited for her to answer anyway. He lay down the papers and leaned back, rubbing his eyes.
"I'm not!" Harry argued. He thought about his words this time, knowing how Draco tended to read too much into what anyone said. "Look," he started again. "I'm offering my condolences because you're my friend, and it sucks to lose a parent. That's all. I still hate him for everything he did willingly under Voldemort, but that doesn't stop me from
Ron's eyes sparkled with excitement. "Malfoy was in the right direction from the start, mate! This reinforces the fact that all of this has some sort of root in old Scandinavia."
Like the fact that Malfoy so needed control in his life that even just ordering at a deli took so much consideration (Harry just picked one of his favorite ready-made ones). Or that his initial expectations of married life were very different in terms of closeness and intimacy (Harry shuddered to imagine what it must be like for an unfortunate traditional pureblood to sleep with their spouses without the intimacy of romantic love. Lie back and think of England, indeed).
Narcissa rushed forward to embrace him. "Oh my dragon, I would do anything to protect you. And Scorpius. Yes, it won't be difficult to find a strong enough ward for his safety. I must begin looking…"
Draco leant further into the armchair he had chosen, and thought about what he wanted to know most. He felt so lost, since Potter had once again given him too much to think about (the prat!) but everything he had said about raising children had struck a chord in Draco's heart.
There was Ginny, helping a laughing Malfoy and a frazzled Hermione in putting down their overexcited babies into the enlarged crib along with Albus. Hugo and James were being secured by Ron in the play pen in the center of the room, while Teddy harassed all of the grownups one by one with his boisterous giggles. The mood was infectious and in no time at all, the adults had settled into their routine of catching up while Kreacher busied himself in the kitchen.
"Oh." Harry noted there was a sort of disappointment coloring Draco's voice, but he didn't have any idea why he would have imagined that. Draco cleared his throat. "Well… I promised Blaise I'd talk to him once this was all over. He tends to travel a lot for work anyway, so it isn't a big change from our habits. I've been in contact with Pansy once or twice since the threat began, but nothing out of the ordinary there. Less visits, but then that's somewhat of a good thing to be honest. She's patient. She's a Slytherin. She understands."
That left Draco in place, deflated but determined. He took a deep breath to gather momentum for his upcoming talk with Astoria.'
"You're welcome," he said. He was startled when he felt Draco grasp his hand gently. There was something behind the shiny grey eyes, but he couldn't tell what.
"Hey, it's just me," Ron said, smiling tentatively, staying by the door. "Hermione told me to check on you in case you had decided to escape using that cloak of yours."
Harry and Ron laughed and joked with their co-trainees on the way to the showers. They were a pretty solid bunch, being the first class to take on the Auror training straight after the war. They all shared the burgeoning need to do something, to make the wizarding world a better place to live in. After all, everyone knew that it was after a war that law enforcement was most needed.
"Mother!" he huffed, trying in vain to disentangle himself from her affections. "Surely such behavior is unbecoming of a Malfoy!" he chided, the tone of his voice betraying his obvious relief of being reunited with her.
"I'm pretty sure we'll manage," Potter sighed. He looked impatiently bored, which flustered Draco even more. Why could Potter not see his point?!
Ginny sighed. "I know. I'm trying to balance it out, but I'm not that good at handling the kids and it's definitely not for lack of effort."
Harry sighed, not bothering to hide how much heavier he felt now. "Like I said before, I do love you and I want you to be happy. I see you with James and I know that you mean it, and you do like being around him but... I don't think you're truly happy unless you're competing."
The little attempt at a joke made Draco relax a bit as well, since he at least got Potter to resurrect his humor.
"I'm not saying you're not happy here, of course, and Merlin knows James loves having you around, but... I don't like seeing you turn into a shadow of yourself. It doesn't feel right."
Draco ground his teeth in frustration. How did she even come up with such conclusions? "Mother," he managed to force out as calmly as he could. "I did as you asked. I admitted that you were right. I am addressing my shortcomings as a husband. Now, you are going the complete opposite direction with your reasoning? Forgive me if I cannot take you so seriously."
He knew this was probably the first of a growing list of bad news they were going to get in the next few days. Knowing his luck, it probably wasn't the worst, either.
He had realized after the war that he more than anyone else would have to fight for his name and honor every single day. He already knew that very few would take him seriously, or even give him their attention. He therefore promised to do everything in his power to regain the respect he deserved. Focusing on his appearance may have sounded mere vanity by others, but Draco was a calculating soul, and he made it clear that he was doing the very opposite of languishing in the shame and shadow of his family's history. No, none of that. He would, in fact, do everything in his power to show the world that he would stand up and fight to redeem the Malfoy family honor, and do it all while still looking good.
Overall, the entire mind mapping business was a pain in the arse, which of course meant that almost every single Auror went out for drinks immediately once it was over. Harry himself couldn't be more grateful. He hadn't expected it to be so hard to be away from home for a month worth of office-time, and it was the first instance of him being away from the kids during the day. Granted, his actual hours were half (since he only had to be present to sign off paperwork for the mind maps) but it still left him restless. Luckily, Ginny had asked Odair for a two-month long reprieve from training. Of course, it meant more time with the team in preparation for their run in South Africa, but it was heaven for both Harry and Ginny that the arrangement had worked out to their favor.
Draco now had the urge to track down Potter, thank him, then promptly punch him in the face. He shuddered at the Muggle-ness of it, but he didn't think even a Cruciatus would ever be as satisfying.
"I was jealous," she whispered. "I had packed up and stepped into the Floo, thinking that I'd catch you and James unawares with my surprise, and what happens instead? I step out and see the three of you having a jolly good time with Malfoy of all people."
"What difference would that make?" Astoria asked worriedly, turning her large, teary eyes to her mother in law.
"Within?!" Harry repeated skeptically, exchanging a significant look with Ron. The redhead frowned. "How is that possible?"
"What the bloody hell does that mean?!" Ron roared. "Are you saying we've been tailing the wrong fucking guy
"Would you mind asking him if he could come speak to me now? Ron and I have some things we wanted to ask. They're pretty…er, he just needs to hear it from me," he amended.
Malfoy nodded. "It's not exactly open information, but seeing as you value privacy, what with your invocation and all" (Harry chuckled at that) "I guess I can be forthcoming with you two." He took another drink before continuing, and both Harry and Ron leaned closer with interest.
Ginny took a napkin and wiped away the stray bits of egg on Harry's chin. "Unfortunately, Harry, you do look like a crazed maniac right now, it merits a photograph!"
"Yes, well, I can be decent when I want to be," Draco smirked. "I just enjoy bothering you too much so I make it a point to check and make sure the hour is perfectly ungodly before attempting to call you."
At that moment, a disgruntled Ministry intern knocked on their open office door and indicated the file box he was holding.
As he settled himself into bed, his last thoughts were still on his former nemesis. He knew Malfoy was one of the sharpest wizards he knew, and he hoped that the wards on James would work on him as effectively as it had on everyone else. In any case, the attention he had given Harry's arms was possibly because he was already quite perceptive, even when he wasn't trying.
Potter's eyebrow quirked up at this, but he didn't say anything in response. Instead, he distracted himself by checking the time again and promptly standing up. At Draco's inquiring look, he gave a lopsided, albeit brilliant smile, which definitely caught him off guard.
"Actually, I've already said yes," he said, to the shock of his wife. "I sent off my response right after I'd figured it out."
Draco was surprised, but silently agreed. He himself had been afraid of his son's upbringing. Sure, he had grown up knowing what rules were to be introduced, what behavior was to be rewarded or punished, but it was only recently, after the War and after his mother's separation from Lucius that he began to wonder what exactly it meant to have children - because he knew that it was so very different from 'having heirs'.
Gerard's laugh reverberated above Draco's voice. "This man has lost his mind! You played him well, Astoria!"
"Which was why you sent me to France." Draco was beginning to see her logic, but that didn't mean that he agreed with it.
He used his free hand to touch his fingertip gingerly to one of the envelope's corners, expecting some sort of explosion or spark of a magical attack, but he was disappointed. All that happened was the flap unsealing itself after reading his magical signature.
He sighed. He had known Hermione well enough to understand her personal drive, her motivations. But now that it seemed to affect so many people around her, he had no clue how to go about it. Looking back to their Hogwarts days, it became blindingly obvious to Harry just how negative she could become when she pushed herself too hard. How she had once prioritized education over life (he and Ron would never let her forget that! When is being expelled EVER going to be worse than getting killed?!) They way she had suspected Harry's Firebolt and gone about it underhandedly, ruining his and Ron's moods (despite being right about it). How even Dumbledore had admitted (albeit in the afterlife) that he had relied on Hermione's logical pessimism to hold Harry back from the Deathly Hallows, because she was just that predictable. And now she was going way overboard.
"I'll be fine, darling," she said, waving his worry away with her arm. "Eventually I'll get used to having more time on my hands. There are people I need to Floo anyway, so tonight would be a good time for me to do so. I'm afraid I miss travelling to the continent, but I've been advised to stay in one country for now."
"Shut it," Potter said suddenly, expression still blank but voice matching the sharpness in Draco's. "It wasn't like that at all. I don't even know why I said that, so just forget it."
As usual, Teddy had not remained in his room as promised, and Harry sometimes had a feeling that his godson might have extra strong hearing abilities to have heard Draco from upstairs. His cousin didn't seem to mind, though.
The man before him sneered, looking quite satisfied with himself. "Been wanting to say that to your face meself. How's it feel to know that you've been keeping a brat who isn't even yours?"
Ron had agreed and applied immediately. Harry, on the other hand, had been torn with his decision for a while. He had realized that without the special privilege, he would have to wait another three years to become a full Auror instead of just one year. He wanted, no, needed to be out there, fighting Dark Wizards and helping those in need. He couldn't stand waiting even a few extra years if it meant being useless.
This time, there were some in the audience who shuffled uncomfortably. Many present were loyal subscribers to the Daily Prophet, of course, and had believed the rumors.
"Gin," he prompted. She brought herself down by a notch to give him her attention. "C'mon to the roof, you might be able to celebrate more properly there."
After the Auror's first pronouncement that Ginevra was leaving, Draco had expected him to explode in anger, or retaliate with raging words and insults. He was disappointed. Instead, he and Potter might have just been talking about the weather or the latest Quidditch scores. That was how Potter talked about his relationship problem - calm, cool and casual.
His mind couldn't stop thinking about the absurdity of sharing drinks and laughs with Potter and Weasley. Sure, they had gotten over their animosity a couple years ago, and they had been pretty mature about it. They had even been at Draco's wedding, he and Astoria had made sure of that (as it was also a well-calculated move on their part, which played out to their advantage).
Draco tried to break down the situation from a pureblood's point of view, in hopes of determining if the problem was rooted in a difference in cultural traditions, but he came up with nil. He and Astoria had spent much time away from each other during their long engagement, but they hadn't had a child during that. They had also had a clear list of expectations and limitations on their contract, which had so far ensured that they were both contented.
"Potter!" the blond exclaimed breathlessly. "I-I-" He moved closer, full of awe, and reached out to touch one of the tiny little hands, which enthusiastically grabbed at him and playfully tugged. The child's ringing laughter echoed around the hallway.
"I don't doubt it," Astoria laughed. "I suppose it remains to be one of your more endearing qualities."
Harry sighed and leaned back. He had thought that having this conversation in the dining room might help, but he thought all of them needed the warmth and comfort offered by the sitting room.
Potter took a huge gulp before speaking again. "Ginny's going away for another six weeks. Montreal."
"Stop it, Harry," Hermione groaned. "No, we won't judge you or think any less of you for telling us what we think you want to tell us."
"Hey," Harry said, dropping the forms he had been working on and putting his hands on Ginny's. He enjoyed these small moments between them. They had never been the kind of couple to be rabidly passionate or romantic. They were always much more comfortable with the steady stability of a sincere companionship, without the bells, whistles and drama that most other couples seemed to have. Their relationship, long and solid as it was, felt very much like a favorite jumper - warm and familiar, and highly dependable despite the inevitable unravelling over the years. He and Ginny had overcome quite a lot of issues, and he was glad that they had come through all those times still together.
Draco nodded interestedly. "Is that so? Good, then! At least we know you're not cheating!" he joked.
Inside was a simple white card, matching the plain parchment envelope. Draco took it and turned as pale as a ghost.
"I'm not sure," Potter said, looking pensive. Draco noticed his green eyes turned upwards at the ceiling as if he were trying to see his thoughts. "I was raised by Muggles, but it's not as if I was exposed to the culture, you know? And among the wizards and witches I've met, I guess the subject of naming hasn't really come up. Though I know Ron was named for one of his great uncles, and Hermione got hers because her parents were fans of mythology. I've no idea if I'm named after someone, but Sirius did mention once that my parents had argued about naming me. To be honest, I think my mother won that with her 'Muggle sentiments'," he said with a bit of a grin.
Also, I'm not just randomly adding in angst or something to twist you up hahaha. The precarious relationship between Ginny and Harry is very tricky to write realistically, but I have seen it in real life  with one of my best friends who has  a child with a woman from another country. Their relationship has been almost like this, with sacrifices being made from both sides, making the thing work but not exactly in a perfectly happy way. They both try, though, and I think Harry, being Harry, would always want to fix things, and Ginny, wanting everything in her life to be perfect, will also want to try.
He had the ghost of a smile on his lips, and he had to admit that he was feeling much lighter, but that immediately Vanished when he saw the grim look etched on Arthur's face, and the lines of worry around Molly's eyes.
"It's not a bad thing, but it might be since you've been pulling away from all of us." The sad tone in her voice pulled Draco abruptly from his indignation. "I thought at first that you were placing too much attention on Scorpius, but now I see that you were content, and happy."
Ginny squeezed his hand with both of hers. "Look, I don't mean to say that what we had, or maybe even still have, isn't significant. It is. You have been such a big part of my life and I'm happy that we have two beautiful boys as a testament to our love. That's not something you can just regret, you know. It's just more obvious to me now that our love just isn't the romantic kind, and we will probably find that in other people. Someday."
"Oh, yeah, I forgot," Harry gestured to the intern. "Thanks. You can probably just put them over on the conference table, we'll take care of the rest."
"What are you on about, Malfoy?" Potter finally asked, perhaps a bit scathingly. Draco could give him that - after all, the man was having a pretty shitty day.
"They'll be fine," he whispered, grabbing Potter's hand and squeezing it briefly for a second before letting go again. The change in Potter was almost instantaneous, the tension leaving his stiff shoulders. "Now sit still."
Draco waved him off. "Weasley was right. His predictions have been accurate so far. It's hard to feel scared when I've got a good team on my case."
Malfoy slowly nodded. "Yeah, I absolutely dreaded having to come here to visit Great Aunt Walburga. Horrifying woman. I must have been very young back then, but I was glad when we didn't have to visit anymore." He looked Harry in the eye. "To be honest, if I had inherited this place, I would have left it alone. You did a much better job bringing it back to life."
It took a while for the blonde to gather his thoughts, but when he did, he gave a bright smile and Harry felt the glow from his host. "It was absolutely brilliant!" Malfoy all but exclaimed. "I blame YOU, by the way, for poisoning my thoughts. I was lucky enough that my mother is apparently a rebel and allowed our little secret to happen behind everyone else's backs."
"Thank you, darling," Draco said with pride before turning back to the fire. "Now, Mother, waste no time in raising any wards you may already have lying in wait. You are also in danger so long as this threat... just please, be safe," he added in a small voice, hating that he sounded like a scared little boy.
Hermione gave out a snigger, nudging her husband in the ribs with her elbow. "Well in that case, I reckon I can forgive you," she said teasingly, lips quirked up. "Anything else interesting happen?"
Harry chuckled. "Learned all my lessons from experience as well. I eventually figured out that all those times that I couldn't get James to settle were just caused by his discomfort. To think that I kept flipping him over and peeking at his nappies and trying to feed him. Wouldn't stop wailing like a banshee."
"Can't you break a contract or something?" Harry asked, interested. Ron had tried to give him a better idea of traditional marriages before, but Harry never really paid any attention.
"Don't you talk to me that way, Harry Potter!" she said, matching his tone. "You know I've been doing my best to do both, and it's fucking tiring but I accept that it's something I'll have to do-"
It was immediately obvious to Draco that the warmer climate of France was more agreeable to his wife, whose temperament seemed to mellow out the moment they stepped away from the Portkey Terminal.
"I will owl Lady Greengrass immediately," she finally said. "Perhaps this match is what we have been waiting for."
"I mean it, Harry," the man said, squeezing his hand in a comforting manner. "Thank you for everything."
Malfoy shook his head, which confused Harry. "Thank you, Potter," he said, still all smiles. "It's so odd that only three people know of this 'scandalous rebellion', and you're one of them."
The next day, Draco would be sure that he had had another nightmare, but for the life of him, would not be able to remember a single thing about it.
"I was joking," Draco assured him. "I must say, I find it marvelous that we can jump from one depressing topic onto a completely absurd one."
Ron passed him one of the sheets. "Confirmation for Macmillan and Malfoy about the statements they gave for the additional mind maps. In triplicate," he scowled.
He was currently sitting with the Savior and the Weasel in one of the more private booths in the back. At 6 o'clock, Viridian's patrons were currently transitioning between the people who came for after-work drinks, and those who were coming to have dinner, so the three of them could enjoy the advantage of less distraction and more privacy during the awkward hours.
Ron, having heard everything from his desk, had leapt closer to the fire. "Hey, Malfoy, just relax, alright? Now, let's go through this logically. Are you sure the warding ritual was a viable one? I mean, are you sure it had historical precedence?"
While the women exchanged their version of pleasantries (which was mostly high-pitched sounds and some squealing and jumping in between, as far as Harry could tell), the three men stood awkwardly near the Floo.
The laughter reflected in Harry's eyes, his mood definitely better. He and Ron would definitely need tonight to unwind after the last month, and he was quite curious to hear what Draco had to say about his first few weeks as a dad-to-be. He had a feeling that tomorrow was going to be a big day, what with Ginny's return home, so he wanted tonight to rest and recharge. He and Ron had at least agreed that Malfoy was an excellent drinking companion, and they were both looking forward to their night out with the Ferret.
It took Draco a while to adjust to the fact that he was on all fours on the floor. He immediately tensed and struggled to stand up.
"Oh don't you try that on me, Draco," she said with a little smirk, her voice full of humor. "I've spent too many years with the two worst liars on earth, and I think they're rubbing off on you. I'd've expected more from a Slytherin."
Harry and Ron received individual owls from Malfoy that week, explaining quite formally why he couldn't work on the formula for a few days. He had been quite blunt about the reason, of course, publicity-whore that he was.
He let out a drawn out sigh and melted into the couch. Teddy climbed up onto the cushions and tugged on Harry's arm with the insistence of children his age.
Draco remained silent once again. This was a lot to take in. Kingsley seemed to understand his sudden taciturnity, and so he smoothly changed the topic for Draco's benefit.
"Yeah, but having James in the picture... it's just... I'm sorry Harry, I just can't help but be a bit sad for Jamie, and he's still so young and impressionable."
When Draco informed his family what Harry and Weasley had told him about the threat patterns, he was expecting some general feeling of relief. He didn't expect his mother to grow even stonier, nor his wife to be more anxious.
For the first time in his life, Draco felt so happy that he was sure he could produce a Patronus as bright as the stars he was named for.
"Which is why some memory charms helped me out," the man sneered. "Didn't take long to charm the potion down your throat at such a close proximity, you know. A quick
Malfoy nodded. "Dilly was one of my nurse elves," he pointed out. "My childhood was what you'd expect of a typical pureblood, you know. I lacked nothing and wanted for naught. I was given and provided with everything. Though, between you and me, my mother the rebel sought to spoil me in her own ways. It.." Draco frowned a bit. "It always made my father a bit angry at her, I guess."
"Oh, yeah, sorry," Harry said, "it's an electric fireplace, so I'll have to switch it out with magic and then have the Floo Network connect me."
"Can't blame you there, mate," Ron shuffled guiltily. "It's not like we didn't provide some distraction..."
Draco tipped the last of his butterbeer into his mouth delicately, before continuing the conversation. The kids were mostly asleep (with Potter forcing a sleepy Teddy into the bedroom down the hall) and all the pleasantries had run dry, so it was now time for the more serious topics.
"I'm just worried, okay?" he admitted to the girl, hoping that she would not ridicule him. "I just thought she'd be more, well, cheerful, about it. You know, like you were when you and Wood found out!"
Ron nodded miserably. "Hermione, she's gone all barmy!" he cried, then looked as if he regretted his words. "I mean, maybe it's the stress of the pregnancy. Is it the same with my sister?"
"I did invite you over," Malfoy reminded him. "I only hope to Merlin that you're not secretly a vampire as well."
"I think it's pretty clear with our established schedule so far that you'll be spending much more time away from here than me," he continued.
"Look at where we are now, Malfoy," he said with amusement. "Entertaining each other and crossing over one another's hearths at odd hours on odd nights..."
Harry had honestly expected an outburst from Hermione, recalling that she had only recently been defending Ginny's ambitions. He did not at all expect her to be so composed and supportive (as much as she could, given that Harry knew she must have been against the final choice he and Ginny had made.)
That particular day, they had gone to have a Saturday brunch at one of their favorite restaurants. They were quite familiar with the owners, who had been given the privilege of being invited into the Solum Sanctuarii ward when Harry deemed that they could be trusted. Of course, Mr. Prishna and his wife Anazka couldn't have shared the information anyway, but they stayed true to their word, honoring the trust and keeping mum despite knowing of Harry and Ginny's private life. Today was bound to be different, however.
"Oi," Ron called out to his sister. "I hope all the Chasing in China hasn't made you blind to the fact that my wife might want to sit down, yeah?"
It was Harry's turn to laugh. "So did Gin. Maybe that's what drew me to her, come to think of it. Never really had a lot of people say things straight to my face. Even Ron and Hermione are sometimes careful of what they say to me. Ginny was just up in my face if she wanted."
"What are you doing!" Astoria cried, sounding panicked, grabbing Gerard's arm. "We agreed not to incriminate ourselves by harming him!"
"Look at you, Potter," he said, but not unkindly. "You're actually wallowing on my couch. I'd expected you to handle matters much better than this."
At his words, Narcissa's lip quirked up a bit. "I have told you before that I have no intention of meddling in your private affairs, Draco, but something like this must be addressed soon. Your pairing is of great significance to the new world order, and it unfortunately puts you in the scrutinizing eye of the magical public. Your actions speak louder than words, and if they see that there is even a scruple of discord in your relationship..."
Draco saw Hermione pursing her lips and knew that she was already thinking of the possible avenues of research she would take. Truly brilliant, that girl.
, and he observed the wonder and surprise in Malfoy's eyes as the little baby suddenly materialized out of thin air.
"So... what now?" Ron asked hesitantly. Harry couldn't help but smirk at the wording, very similar to his last talk with Ginny.
Ginny stood up, shoulders still obviously shaking. She moved slowly towards one of the windows overlooking the street. "I know," she said softly, meekly. "That's why I'd already made up my mind before I even came here."
is the highest level of personal protection that Magic itself can offer. If I can extend to my family and friends, there's no reason I can't include you."
Draco was surprised. "We just spent two hours voluntarily discussing nappies, crying and politics," he said in awe. "I think we're actually acting like adults now, in the most boring way. A bit more food and we're well on our way to Slughorn level."
There was only a month left until the birth of their son, and Draco had yet to discover the extent of his patience. So far, he had gone above and beyond the call of duty, obliging Astoria and providing anything and everything she asked for with no question. He felt smug about it, of course, and wasted no chance of flaunting his perfect self to his new friends. Because that's what Potter and Weasley had become to him. In actuality, the two blokes were very helpful when it came to preparing for his imminent fatherhood, and Draco was very grateful for things to have turned out the way they had.
After them, there was a whirlwind of witnesses presented to the court. Most of them were witnesses to the "crimes" of the Malfoy family, but a majority were obviously full of contempt at the mere mention of the name. A few were from pureblood families who had remained neutral in the war, and they spoke for the defense of the Malfoys. Of course, they were not taken as seriously.
At his words, Hermione's eyes widened. Of course she would be excited with the prospect of hidden research material. "So we
Harry couldn't help but ask himself for the seventh time. In front of him, Malfoy seemed to shrink into himself. Not physically, of course, but Harry felt like he knew his old nemesis at a level so profound that every little gesture of nerves that the blond showed was enough for Harry to imagine what he might be feeling. It was so very rare to see Malfoy shrinking metaphorically, when all he had ever done was to make sure that everyone knew he was larger than life. The sight went against all he believed Malfoy should be, which made him take a different tactic.
There was a complex expression shadowing Malfoy's face. "Too simple for you?" Harry asked, somewhat amused. "Not enough obscure constellations to suit your taste?"
"It is a big deal," Harry nodded solemnly. "I would die first before giving it out, but-" He looked straight at Malfoy, emerald eyes burning into silver. "I want you to know."
"Would you like me to stay with you for your calls?" he asked, wondering if he should also provide his supportive presence in such situations.
"I went down on one knee and everything, and I-I think I did okay when I told her-I mean-I'd been practicing, you see..."
Upon hearing Draco's words, Narcissa seemed to contemplate many things in her head that Draco felt that he could hear her the machinery working behind her blue eyes.
"But what, Draco?" Pansy sighed. "You've always tended to do this, even in school." At Draco's confused look, she raised an eyebrow. "Oh, come on, you always used to overanalyze everything, reading it all wrong, and then blaming everyone else for your own mistaken assumptions."
Once again, Harry nodded his agreement, and gave one last squeeze to Ginny's shoulders before stepping away. "I'll see you soon, Ginny," he said. Goodbye seemed too finite to say in this situation, he thought.
"Oh." Harry looked dumbly at Draco, feeling even more so on the inside. He smiled sheepishly. "Sorry, guess I got carried away there…"
When he once again checked on Teddy and James and ensured they were alriht by themselves, he called Kreacher to keep an eye on them.
"Sorry," Harry apologized automatically, face turning a deep red. "I didn't mean to barge in last night, like that..."
"Exactly," Ron said, smugly. "You should go and talk to Odair yourself and make him understand that Ginny has to rearrange her priorities a bit first, at least until James is a bit older, you know?"
"Our Healer says she'll be fine for as long as she avoids travelling abroad. She's been out and about, mostly mingling with her friends here, possibly trying to make up for all the European society balls she's missing by staying here."
Of course, Malfoy couldn't be fooled, and Harry braced himself for the onslaught of jeers and taunts.
Perhaps Malfoy expected him to take the mickey, but Harry actually paused to think about the choice. "Scorpius..." he whispered, as if tasting it on his tongue. "That actually sounds... well, it's as odd as any wizarding name, as pretentious as a Malfoy, and as uniquely memorable as Draco... not as sinister as Lucius, which is a plus..."
"I can't be sure yet," Hermione admitted. "There are magical ways of determining blood relations and magical auras, of course, but these can be fooled by external factors such as volatile magical currents, or the proximity to magical substances and artifacts. There are even rituals to change or modify lineage, such as for magical adoption. In muggle science, however, there is such a thing we call DNA, which are the building blocks of every living organism."
"One of the potions is to ease her pain," Narcissa explained calmly. "She drank it about an hour ago, and it seems one of the effects is a sort of dreamy lucidity."
The Auror growled under his breath in apparent frustration, which Draco secretly relished, considering he had once again aimed for it on purpose. He loved getting under his former nemesis' skin, no matter how trivial it may have sounded.
: No, of course, not. It wasn't like it was a favor. I presented him with all the facts, made the proposal and everything. I just made him see the need for such a department.
"Sure," Harry confirmed, sounding more confident. "It's a safe place, my wards on you will be extra strong while you're here, and it's not like the place is crowded. You can take one of the rooms in the third floor."
Draco felt his heart stutter at the sound of the gruff voice, but faced his kidnapper with all the haughty dignity he could muster. "And you are?" he demanded, voice dripping with barely contained venom.
"Yes, Potter, your visually graceful mastery of limbs really adds to my telepathic comprehension of your unspoken thoughts."
Odd as it was, a part of him still felt rebuffed by Potter's rejection of his handshake in their First year. Over the years, he had always counted on just a civil acquaintance with the Chosen One. The last month they had spent exchanging owls and talking on Fire-calls, however, made Draco realize that they could, in fact, be good friends. With Potter and Weasley inviting him into their fold, he felt a bit vindicated somehow. He would deny it, of course, but deep inside, he knew that Potter was silently holding out his hand in friendship, and Draco was more than happy to take it.
He moved over to where James was and pulled him into his arms, bringing him back with him to the sofa. "This tyke here, almost drove me and his mum up the wall one time because he wanted to have a dragon. It was the stupidest tantrum ever."
"This is old news, Gin," Harry pointed out. He felt like a dick, but it had to be done. Now was the time. "We've been avoiding it over the Floo, but now we have to open this up. You see how fucked up that has become, right?"
"Any idea what your mum might name him then?" Harry asked, after deftly catching the flying biscuit and stuffing it into his mouth. Malfoy shook his head. Harry shrugged. "I guess it's not the same for you then if you can shrug your shoulders like that. It does take away a lot of pressure, you lucky bastard. I had Arthur, Molly and Ginny to please while I spent months deciding on a name."
"Oh, no, it's not, um... I'm glad you're here," Harry appeased, shaking his head and wiping his eyes quickly with the back of his hand as he turned more to face Malfoy. He gestured his free hand towards the seat next to him, indicating to Malfoy that he could take a seat.
He was absolutely terrified right now. He was worried thrice over, for himself, Astoria and their son. There was always that small part of him that needed things to go according to plan, or his mind would stumble back to dark corners and he would lose himself again.
Thank Merlin it was a Saturday. Draco usually slept in after late Friday nights, so Astoria wouldn't make a big deal out of his coming home the next morning. Given his state last night, it was much better that they had all ended up at Potter's - Harry's!!! - place.
Harry shook his head. "No, and I'm not sure if I want him to find out.. but I don't know how to deal with this situation right now."
"Do you really have to put your arms up in that ridiculous manner, Potter?" Draco insisted. "It's rather distracting."
"Don't apologize," he said sternly. "I've already come here prepared to play the part of loyal and supportive friend, which I intend to pull off with flying colors. That includes being a good listener to your whinging. Now, before we continue this little bonding session, why don't we actually go somewhere? Didn't you promise Arthur Weasley you'd go and take a break?"
He nodded, hiding the slight sadness he felt for Potter. He knew that the relationship wasn't as strong as the Chosen Couple had been projecting it to the public, but still... he could sympathize wizard to wizard. Even with the privacy wards, there was no predicting how big of a backlash this could cause from the fickle public, who, Draco thought scathingly, were so quick to judge their Savior.
"Perhaps there is an essential step that we have missed?" Astoria suggested. "A missing incantation, or ingredient? This ritual is centuries old, we can't even make sure if the sources we've used have recorded it properly. Maybe something significant was omitted somehow…"
Draco hung his head in shame. He hadn't meant to grab her in such a childlike way, but his nerves had gotten the better of him. After all, it wasn't every day that he made this sort of decision. He steeled his resolve and stood his ground. "I was wondering..."
"But..." Malfoy seemed so lost at the moment, but he found his words. "Okay. Let's get real here. The three important aspects of extending your bindings."
Harry shrugged. "Ron and I have come here before, though not for a while. Are you always here, then?" He hadn't seen Malfoy out much, though he always saw him in the papers. The last time they had actually spoken was at some Ministry event last year, and they had barely exchanged more than a few pleasantries.
"You can come and help, though," Harry offered, thinking it would me much easier to take care of two boys in the same room than if he had let the kid run around downstairs while his attention was on his son.
"I'm sorry," she said, still with a sigh. "I guess I'm just... well I'm a bit embarrassed about it but I guess I was taken aback by all of you being here, just having fun..."
It was then that Draco put together both sides of what he heard from Weasley and Hermione. "You know, Hermione," he began in a slow, soothing voice, "in the Wizarding world, children are cherished. Dare I say it, the tradition was to start as early as possible, and have as many offspring that a couple could manage to raise. The Weasleys are a very good example, actually."
Draco's brow furrowed at her concern. "Our means of raising the next Malfoy heir is hardly the business of anyone without that name," he pointed out. "Yes, I do understand that Astoria and I must always be sensitive to the image that we project, and impressions mean a lot in our circles. However, she and I have already discussed this before, and while I understand that her responsibilities might take her far and away, mine happen to leave me with much freedom to spend my hours however I desire. And I do prefer to spend them with Scorpius. None of this is dictated explicitly in our contract anyway."
He couldn't imagine what it had been like for her, returning to a Voldemort-controlled Hogwarts, going against Snape and trying to steal the Sword of Gryffindor for Harry, taking punishment and dishing it out with equal fervor, and readily fighting on his side at the final battle. And the whole time, she had known nothing about his whereabouts, his safety, or even his plans. She had gone through the year just going on whatever was speculated on Potterwatch, and then she had seen him seemingly dead in Hagrid's arms. Harry recalled seeing her unmoving in the Chamber of Secrets, the dread he had felt when he thought he had come too late. It had never been easy for the two of them, he mused bitterly. But that was why they had worked so well together for years - they had gone through almost the same things, together and apart. They had lost family, they had their minds and souls invaded by Voldemort, and they both had had a lot to live up to. They shared the passion for Quidditch, the immense dislike for anything ostentatious and unnecessary. They fit together, both in the big things as well as the tiny details. It just made sense for them to be together.
Draco took a deep breath. He couldn't believe she had taken this for granted. No wonder she and Weasley had had problems. "Magic is highly dependent on the well-being of one's mind, body and soul," he explained. "That's why it is very difficult to use magic when under pressure, and only the more powerful or well-practiced wizards are able to do so. It's also how Dementors make it hard for anyone to use magic - they cause severe depression and anxiety, weakening the mind and soul without having to harm the physical body. Yes, I'm aware that the concept is very abstract," he said pointedly, "but what we currently know of magic is that it is a direct reflection of one's being. What happened to you... Merlin, it's a good thing Potter took notice! When a witch or wizard is under constant stress and anxiety, it causes their magic to fluctuate dangerously, and possibly even weaken beyond repair!"
"A friend of mine can have the samples analyzed as soon as possible," Hermione continued. "She's a muggle, of course, but this is her area of expertise, and there will be little room for error."
"Her family was very amenable to the contract," she told him. "Daphne was the most perfect lady for you, Draco. Whatever could have happened on your acquaintance meeting that ruined such good chances?"
Ron laughed. "Come out with us more often," he suggested. "Wouldn't want to ignore the Call of the Pint now, would we?"
: Thank you. Speaking of Ms. Weasley, how is your relationship? What is it really like for someone quite ordinary to be dating a person of immense fame and celebrity?
"I love you, Hermione. I want what's best for you. It's always different for everyone. For Ginny, being on a broom chasing a Quaffle 16 hours a day brings her so much joy that she brings it home and shares it with me and James. What do you take home with you to share with your family?
Draco accepted gratefully, holding it close and staring at the liquid as if he could divine his future from its depths. He said nothing, but it seemed his face was betraying him a lot today, and Hermione was reading him like a book.
After the welcome lull over the weekend, Harry thought it was both invigorating and vexing to be around everyone else again. Granted, he had a lot of years to get used to the non-committal chatter expected from Ron and Hermione; the stifling yet warm coddling from Molly and Arthur; and the entertaining talks with Ginny whenever she had something to rant about.
Draco could remember how he had been in the same position, waiting anxiously and alternating between sitting restlessly and pacing incessantly. Which Potter had been doing for the last two hours, driving both Hermione and Weasley mental.
"You know," he said, his tone more playful now. "I think I'll stay. It seems we've got a lot to talk about."
As he and Teddy changed James (or, more accurately, Harry changed James while Teddy knocked around some bottles and jars while looking on curiously), the sound of the Floo from the fireplace downstairs rang.
"Ginny, have you refreshed the Temperature Charm?" He had discovered earlier on that James was easily bothered when a room became too warm and stuffy. Now that the weather was transitioning, the fire was still necessary, so he had kept up a Temperature Charm to act as a thermostat for James and ensure he was comfortable.
"Well enough, Mother," he replied,, his voice tinted with the warmth of affection for his son. "It took a bit of persuasion for both nurse elves to give him up to me, but I believe it was worth it."
"I don't see the problem," Harry said, raising an eyebrow. "We fulfill all three. So what's our point?"
When the two of them settled back into their chairs, they fell into small talk, and Harry had to admit that it was getting much easier to talk to the blond. Sure, they had differing opinions about a lot of things they discussed, but again, they fell into the old habit of competing with each other somehow, and they both took comfort in that.
He would have gone to bed already, but for the whirl of disorganized thoughts now going through his head at an alarmingly distracting manner. Once again, his new "friend" had unwittingly succeeded at making rethink everything he used to believe.
But their grins could not outshine the one on Potter's face, Draco was sure - he looked absolutely pleased with himself. The Auror gleefully stepped towards Astoria, bowed, and kissed her hand.
The redhead settled tentatively next to Harry, who automatically held out his arms to hold her while she in turn held onto his arms for support. They knew they both needed some form right now.
"I want you, Harry. I want to be with you, and I want to be with James, and I want you both to see and know and feel that It's true!"
"Bedroom?" Ginny asked breathily, once again making Harry wonder if she could read his mind. She'd only said one word, but her voice was hoarse and throaty, full of heat.
Still, it had been tiresome, catering to the random whims of a woman running purely on hormones. He laughed to himself as he took the chocolates up to their bedroom. If Pansy had heard him say that, she would have hit him upside the head with her diaper bag. All in good fun, of course. He laughed when Astoria basically grabbed the box from his grasp the moment he had stepped into the bedroom.
been responsible for the well-being of someone else, whether it be the Dursleys, his best friends, or the entire world. Caring for his own son was a very welcome addition to Harry's list of responsibilities; for Ginny, it was a first.
"Anyway, it should be done sometime soon, I've been timing it," Hermione added. Draco suppressed a snort of amusement. Of course she would take this on a technical level.
to someone else was seemingly simple enough of a ritual, because its depth of complexity depended wholly on magical power, concentration and emotion. It was mostly Potter clasping Draco's right hand and intoning the long and ancient Latin chant that invoked the bindings he intended to form between them. Such old rituals relied purely on Magic, with a capital 'M'', and demanded very clear focus and a strong combination of intent and emotion towards the person being covered by
Harry nodded. "Plus tomorrow. Ginny won't be able to stay with the kids and Arthur and Molly have gone back to France, so I'll have my hands full. If things go well on her end, she might have to go iron out some contract formalities with her team. So if ever, I'll probably work from home again for the next week or two."
Harry couldn't help but chuckle. "Kreacher's pretty good at it. And I've told you, Ginny and I want to raise our kids first hand. No elves. Not that there's anything wrong with that," he quickly added for good measure, "but it's just not me."
"Does this have anything to do with something you and Mr. Potter talked about today?" she inquired. Draco nodded.
"Hello, Hermione," he greeted back with a genuine smile. "Potter, Weasley," he added, nodding to the other two men as well.
Neither was expecting much fanfare that morning, which was why both Harry and Draco were startled to consciousness by the shrill yell from someone running down the stairs.
Draco seemed to mull over Harry's words. Harry hadn't really thought about it, but for some reason, he liked being able to listen to whatever Draco had to say.
Ron sputtered. "This is one of your businesses?" Harry shared his surprise, since he and Ron had never heard mention of it.
There was a popping sound, and Kreacher appeared, bowing low. "Good morning Master Harry," he wheezed. "You have missed the breakfast today, is there anything you want Kreacher to prepare for lunch?"
"Haven't we just eaten less than two hours ago?" Ginevra cried in disbelief, patting her tummy. "I'll never get my figure back!"
"Hey," Harry found himself saying with a sigh. "I'm honestly getting tired of hearing that from you. This game of ours has gone on for too long I think."
"Is this what you really want, Harry?" he inquired quietly, making the younger man feel as if he and the Minister for Magic were sharing a private, intimate moment without a handful of spectators privy to their conversation. Of course, he knew that this conversation would have had to happen eventually anyway, seeing as he needed the Ministry's approval and endorsement if he wanted to pursue the invocation. Without missing a beat, Harry nodded eagerly, betraying his impatience at finally having the life he wanted.
it, if that makes sense," Harry said. "How do I put it? I mean, we never even really thought about how we would really treat parenthood, you know? It sounds kind of sick, but I guess it was like we felt ready for a family, but we were only really thinking like we were preparing to get a
"Yes, of course we all knew. Obviously, you didn't stick to our expectations, seeing as you arrived about eight hours in advance."
Draco ground his teeth. "I wouldn't have, then," he said slowly, carefully. "But now, I'd like to thank you directly. And now, I really would like to know what it was you saw, and why you thought it wise to even side with me."
"No, they weren't," Draco said, eyes narrowing and zeroing in to Potter's guilty gaze. Hermione released him from her hug and he crossed his arms in front of himself, still staring accusingly at the man who always made his blood boil. "How did you even manage to make it to our door when we had our private ward closed off to anyone?"
"That's why I had to see you," Draco said in a low voice. He didn't feel the need to explain further. He knew he was right to assume that Potter would understand.
"I'm not so keen on leaving them alone for too long," she said flippantly, but Harry heard an undertone of a growl. "I mean, sure he's changed for the better and all, but he's still a Slytherin, and probably has a lot of hidden motives or something."
"It might have been just a quickie, but that's where it all began." His voice reminded Draco of heavy oil - each slick word seemed to weigh down on his increasingly sore shoulders. "Surely you've forgotten our short introduction, since you were too busy with all your books. It wasn't hard for me at all to slip you a special something."
"Of course not," Ron answered. "It was a quiet affair, you know, simple. Mione's family were there, too, so there wasn't much of the old tradition. It was sort of just a ceremony for us to finally be husband and wife."
"Harry, you have to understand, I was raised with so many expectations. Growing up within the hierarchy of pureblood society… we're used to objective things, situations we can predict, alliances we can make, debts we can pay. I can't help but calculate everything that's happened and I hate that I owe you-"
Draco remained silent, but against his will, he tried remembering what had happened the day he met Astoria. He'd always felt that he was flying on Felix whenever he recounted to anyone who asked - it was too good to be true that he'd met his perfect match in such a way.
"No, Mother is busy with her research on certain blood wards, and Astoria has several of her political circle visiting, which is why I thought to have some time with Scorpius."
"Sorry, it's just... you came at the precise moment that I pretty much fell apart," Harry apologized, slumping back into his seat with a bit of embarrassment. He didn't want Malfoy to think he couldn't handle things. When he looked back at him though, there was nothing but a thoughtful expression on the man's face.
When both families had gathered in the delivery room around Astoria, Draco couldnt help but stare in awe at the little bundle of life, moving around in Astoria's arms. His wife looked so tired and fragile, which was to be expected after just giving birth to her first child, but Draco noticed the emergence of the strength of her character- she obviously wanted and needed to rest, but was holding herself up throughout the naming ritual. He felt such a rush of admiration, once again reminding himself how lucky he was to have bumped into her at the bookstore.
Harry knew that she was already questioning so many facts - first of which was why in the hell would Malfoy ever be in their sitting room close to midnight?
Harry shrugged one shoulder, turning away from the pan and beginning to make coffee. "I got enough practice, seeing as I cooked every meal for my Muggle family."
He found himself pacing in slight agitation, but his Mother's presence helped him to calm down in order to think about everything going through his head at the moment.
love him. That he did not come from me will never discount the fact that I myself have been his father! And no one can ever take that away!"
: That's as good as gold. Well, that’s pretty much it, our time is up anyway. Ms. Granger, Mr. Weasley, Mr. Potter, thank you very much for your time. Our readers will be grateful for this rare opportunity.
"This is highly irregular, you should know," Helen Rosewood was saying gently. "Usually we have to keep the father outside but this kind of decision must be made by both parents. It's not something to just take for granted."
Finally, Draco realized they were almost done. He was already weighing the testimonies in his head, trying to calculate in whose favor the judge would fall. As the time for judgment finally came, however, there was a sudden hush, immediately followed by a flurry of violent whispers. Draco tried to twist from where he was seated to see the source of the commotion, but the high back of his chained chair blocked his view from behind.
Something in the blonde's expression shifted, but there was only silence, which made Harry think he made the right conclusions.
"Under strict confidence, Mr. Malfoy, he also provided me with Voldemort's memories as well." Draco looked up at the Minister, confused.
"Is it?" Harry knew they needed to address the elephant in the room, otherwise she might never get better. "I think you've become too overinvolved and unnecessarily attached to your jobs," he said finally. Might as well get straight to the heart of it. He mentally prepared for a backlash.
"No," Malfoy said, deflated. "No one really stays here except me, Astoria, my parents and the elves."
This year's subcontinental Quidditch tournament has gotten all fans up in a tizzy with the unexpected results. This writer is willing to bet all her entire month's Galleons that at least two thirds of the entire magical community in Britain have lost a fortune betting against the Holyhead Harpies, who have surprisingly finished the tournament with an impressive list of overall records above any other team.
"Ronald Weasley!" Hermione admonished, "if I ever hear you talk about women with a tone like that, as if it's a joke! I swear to Merlin..."
Potter laughed, perhaps one of the first genuine laughs that Draco had ever witnessed on Potter's face. "Yes, it would have been inconvenient, but almost everyone at the Ministry does it whenever they go on holiday. So I thought it was appropriate to thank you in person."
Several heads snapped up, interest peaking. Not a single breath was released, and a dropped pin would have echoed thunderously. The reactions just made it easier for Harry to finish what he had to say. The earlier he could leave, the better.
"Well, Harry... Harry came to me one day and told me about how he thought I'd been pushing myself too much mentally and emotionally that it was affecting my physical well-being. Sounded like a load of waffle at the time..." she laughed weakly.
"Now, Teddy, what did Granma Andy say about rushing at Cousin Draco while he's holding Scorpius?" Harry asked sternly with his I'm-a-father voice.
As if on cue, Draco's brain was jolted at the mention of the child. Automatically, he looked around for the boy, and the Auror laughed.
"Well..." How could he explain it when even he couldn't understand how and why he felt this way? "You do remember that S
"The contracts depend on magic. Before a marriage, the families can cancel betrothal contracts at any time. Traditionally though, a child changes things, because breaking a contract can mess up a lot things for the heirs and their hierarchy."
"Well after another quick owl exchange - and mate, let me just tell you how awful it is to have to write a seriously loaded message in the plainest terms - he told me that we could meet up at same place as before."
"Harry," she whispered, bringing him out of his thoughts. "I was contacted by Ted's remaining family again earlier today." Harry knew that Ted's Muggle family had been in turmoil since they found out about Ted's disappearance, and even worse after the abrupt announcement of his death. They had no inkling of the War, nor did they understand the circumstances of Ted's demise, which meant that Andromeda had to deal with their family issues over the years. Over the last five years, she'd needed to coordinate with the Muggle Liaison Office in order to corroborate the stories that she was inclined to tell the Tonkses. It seemed that she still had a lot to do.
Ron smiled sheepishly. "Well, now that you think about it, I guess I panicked. But yeah, she did say she wasn't ready yet. I shouldn't have bolted- oh Harry sorry mate, I shouldn't have-"
