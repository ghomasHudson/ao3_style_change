"I imagine a few days without even a name would drive anyone mad - not that you were mad!" he added hastily at James's warning glance. "Only… It must have given you something familiar to latch onto."
A loud series of crashes and bangs foretold the arrival of a young boy from upstairs. He stumbled and fell down the last few steps, collapsing in a heap on the ground behind the counter. The crashing continued as a large contraption bounced down the stairs behind him, finally breaking apart into pieces around him. The horn of a gramophone skittered and spun around madly across the floor, eventually coming to a rest at Remus's feet on the other side of the counter. There was a resounding silence as the boy cringed on the floor, hiding his face, and then the man launched into a cacophony of laughter, swears, and accusations.
"I'm asking the questions!" Blaise bellowed. Obviously there was a hefty sound-dampening charm on the ward he had thrown up because nobody was coming to his rescue.
"How exactly did you find me?" he asked softly. He'd never let himself linger on the details of his case or even his rescue for long. But he found the subject didn't make him quite so sick to think about what Ron and Hermione - his best friends, even after all of this - had to do with it.
“We could start with our product adverts,” Hermione suggests brightly, but there’s a hard edge to her voice; Harry and Ron exchange knowing glances.
The curse went wildly off target, missing Narcissa and hurtling toward James who was only just clamoring to his feet. He threw himself back, landing on his arse and kicking out his legs, and the curse slammed into his foot.
"Anymore?" Malfoy asked conversationally. Harry didn't know how to have that conversation, so he just said,
“Fine,” he huffs, relinquishing Potter’s arm and stalking around the bed to what he thinks might be an exterior wall, or near enough to it. “I’ll do it myself.” He flicks his wand at the wall in a complicated pattern and draws a square in the bricks. His incantation is flawless, the wand movements clean and precise, but the magic doesn’t…go. His wand doesn’t summon the magic from within him, doesn’t propel it into the wall. It just…doesn’t.
, Arty signed back, pale and twitchy. It was James's turn to smirk. Maybe he could get McGonagall to demonstrate her ultimate transfiguration skills.
In the time that bridges Danny and Denny, when Harry is just coming to terms with the fact that he is running out of options, his voice is too raw - from calling for help - to call his captor anything.
"You were never curious?" He couldn't imagine a world in which Harry Potter managed to curtail his own curiosity.
Instinctively, Draco knows they have their magic now that they're outside the confines of the oven. He whips out his wand—the tip brushes his now flaccid cock, as if mocking his efforts to distract Potter earlier—and pulls the door open with a wordless incantation. The screams morph into a desperate crowing that's somehow worse and then the old woman is flinging herself out of the chamber, tripping over Potter again and crashing full-force into the far wall of the gingerbread corridor. Her head breaks through and she scrabbles comically to free herself, but can't. Draco huffs a laugh, but doesn't really feel it.
James read it, eyes widening as he drank in every perfectly phrased politic. It was dripping in rhetoric designed to make the pill easier to swallow: though unfortunate and often kind-hearted people, werewolves were dangerous; the Ministry's registry was not enough nor was it up to date; finally, it was time to start phasing them out of wizard society. Pack life in the wilds of Romania would be an adjustment for many, but worth it for the world at large.
Harry perched on the edge of the hospital bed, swinging his legs back and forth. He was sporting jeans and a t-shirt with a picture of a tiger’s face. Behind him, voices from the other end of the St. Mungo’s wing drifted over and he caught a few words.
“Yours, you berk, but that doesn’t mean Remus is wrong.” He had that pitying look on his face again, the hypocrite. Both of them were imprisoned for over a decade and Sirius had the gall to
"James woke in hospital several years ago without a clue. Couldn' remember 'is name, couldn' walk or talk. They found 'im on the street, all banged up, no identification."
like he does when ye leave 'im alone in a kitchen too long. Starts makin' buckets an' barrels of candies an' sweets like he's Willy Wonka!"
"I remember." Draco waits, but Potter avoids his gaze. He goes for another truffle, moaning sensually. Blood rushes south and Draco forces the conversation forward before he does something else. "Why is that?"
“The reduced hours were just the start, Draco,” Harry murmurs, no less alarmed. He tears off his wet glasses and cleans them on his grey tunic. “It’s happening!”
"UP!" he yelps, flailing against the dead weight on top of him. Like a spatula pressing on a sausage, Potter is pushing him into the searing hot bricks. Draco's sweat-slicked back spits, sizzles, and steams in the worst, most grisly, disgusting, offensive, grotesque—"UP, POTTER!
"I'm not always at Hogwarts," Potter says easily, popping a shiny truffle into his mouth. Draco envies the truffle.
“I s’pose so,” Scorpius muttered bravely. “Could we go for ice cream then?” Harry smirked. Malfoy was getting played.
Remus left the office with a happy flutter in his chest, browsing the rest of the list. He set an ambitious goal for himself: three visits in one day. That would certainly earn him a guilt-free box of chocolates from his favorite shop. A spring in his step, Remus set out to Kent to visit one
James couldn't remember when he'd been suffused with such energy. The boys were back home, Monty was still stubborn but at least quiet about it, Draco had joined them again on Saturday - without Blaise this time! Not that James had anything against Blaise. But like a security blanket, it was a big deal to leave behind the implied "plus-one" on the invitation.
Through the heavy iron door, which has proven to be resistant to wandless unlocking charms, Harry hears the trap-door lift from the hidden entrance of the bunker. Bubotuber pus. Fin has returned. Sometimes Harry finds himself so desperate for company that he's tempted to actually snuggle up with the man during 'storytime.' Not that he has recently. It's been years (probably) since he last gave into his raw need for human contact. Now he shakes with the rage of eternity when Fin is near. Now there's hard ice in his chest, slicing at his heart, and in his darkest moments he reminds himself that he is capable of cold-blooded murder. That he is aching for it.
Mr. James said sheepishly. Daddy cleared his throat and looked down, ashamed. Then they both shared a little smile that Scorpius could clearly see, so obviously they hadn't learned their lesson at all!
Potter huffs, not sounding very amused but not moving to pummel the indestructible door again. Thank fuck for small mercies.
"Fiancé!" he said, unable to articulate a response worthy of this momentous occasion. A Malfoy and a Potter,
Shoving away the hands that dragged him out of hell, he throws himself to the ground. The ground, not the floor. The ground.
So he waits. He talks to Danny, and when the man disappears for his first long absence - around the time that he seems less like Danny and more like Denny - Harry starts talking to himself.
"Pansy's easier," he decided to try. Judging from her twisted expression, it was either the wrong thing to say or made no sense outside of his head.
"Draco didn't mention it to you?" Hermione asked delicately. Harry ruffled up his hair in the back and blinked up at the sky. It was beyond his comprehension how soft the pink fluffy clouds looked against hard streaks of white in the distance, all of it joining in a warm golden glow. The majesty of it stole his words, but he'd gladly give it everything he had in a steady worship that could carry him through the rest of his new life.
Not much can be seen through the closed blinds except for two figures, conversing quietly across a desk. A paper is signed and handed over. One figure stands, and then the other. They shake hands.
"Yes!" Oh Merlin, this was the part when he got the brilliant idea to mimic the git. Something about the schoolyard curses made him respond to the torture like an actual schoolboy.
"I should think it's Goldilocks," Draco cut in. He held up a stack of files, eyes sparkling with defiance in the face of a challenge...perhaps a bit of madness, too. "At least until we find you the perfect fit."
James thought viciously. Why were they trying to keep him from his kids? Wild thoughts began to fly through his panicked mind. Could he even trust these people?! What could Aurors do anyway? Would they really be willing to do whatever it took to protect the boys? They didn't protect Harry! James shoved past Ron and stumbled into the corridor, the pain in his hip screaming down his leg and up his back, stealing his breath away. He yanked open the door to the last compartment.
James turned the paper over and surreptitiously slid it into the utensil drawer, where Rachel wouldn’t have to see it again. His regular rotation of bodyguards was looking particularly drawn lately. The case was taking a toll on the comparatively small Auror squad while the rest of the DMLE struggled to pick up the slack. The extended hours were brutal, sometimes extending into triple or quadruple shifts, however much he insisted he didn’t need a bodyguard now that he could recall how to use his wand properly. At least he was taking the threat seriously now, though Ron had nearly rolled his eyes right out of his head when he realized that James's newfound interest in the case was mostly due to Draco's October attack.
"Put a warrant out!" Ron barked at Rachel, who turned her entire body in order to give him a Look. Right. Too aggressive. "Sorry. Er - Theodore Nott, Romilda Vane, and that Montague bloke."
"Have you noticed…?" Ron trailed off, nodding across the room. Hermione could barely contain her grin.
"I'm not breaking into someone's home! I'll just knock again," he sighed, doing just that. Voices and footsteps filtered faintly through the door, but none seemed to approach. Well, he wasn't going to give in now, he had to set an example for the youth on his back - who seemed to be getting heavier and heavier with each passing second.
She came to Draco two weeks ago and pleaded with him to take a mysterious new case involving amnesia of unknown causes. She insisted that he would want to take this one despite her not being able to pass on any concrete details. Given their tentatively friendly and beneficial history (post-Hogwarts, at least), he trusted that the case would serve to further his career as an up-and-coming Mind Healer on the rapidly expanding frontier of his field.
Harry bared his teeth in a weak grimace. Draco barely waited for his meek "yes" before he was off again.
“Attention, employees. Attention, employees. Mr. Cedric Diggory, please report to Warehouse Sector B, as per Bellabitch’s request. Repeat, Mr. Cedric Diggory, please get your pert little arse down to Warehouse Sector B - as in Basilisk - as per Bellatrix’s request.
"Assistant Store Manager - if you'd bother yourselves to read the name-tag - and I don't have time for this. We've agreed to let you follow the workers in their day to day duties, as per the Board of Directors' research on worker morale."
James shrugged noncommittally, looping one arm lightly - tentatively - around Draco's waist again as he reached over and grabbed a letter at random. He stared at Monty's name on the open envelope but made no move to read the message within.
, by Frida Macías. He had read it again over the past few weeks and seriously considered emailing the author to ask: "Summer camps and exchange programs are all well and good, but what if you're harassed into sending your babies away to magic murder school?"
In a stupor, Ron heard himself bark some orders. Photographs were taken. Statements were recorded via Quick Quotes Quills on Ministry-Grade Tamper-Proof Parchment. The firepoker was extracted and sent to Evidence. Wands were returned and Lucius was arrested.
“Cake?" Draco shoves a sponge-cake into Potter's face so that he has no choice but to open his mouth and accept it. Potter looks ready to slug him for that shit move but then he hums in delight, his eyes roll back in his head, and he seems to forget all his worries about the locked door.
"I know the ethics!" He turned away, suddenly sickened by her perfect eyebrows. "I submitted half of them."
Draco smirked and pulled his arms back around his waist firmly. Enough with this unsettled nonsense. He liked those arms around him, just as much as he liked wearing the disgusting mustard-yellow hoodie and the droopy joggers. It felt safe. Comfortable. Exciting. A little mad, but the good kind of madness that led to dark lords being defeated and worlds being changed.
The boys leaned in eagerly, torsos splayed on top of the table as they gaped at the moving picture. Monty turned it around to face him, and Harry leaned in to get a better look.
Arty was fully crying now as he pressed his tear-streaked face into the cat's wrinkled skin. James pressed his own face into his son's hair, trying to...to push some sort of comforting energy at him, anything to help him where words couldn't. They stood there for a long moment, James's arms around a sniffling Arthur whose arms were cradling a grumbling cat.
Monty was distracted because Harry was spending an awful lot of time signing in the corner with Draco, who would hardly read the translation before launching into his own cheeky monologue.
Malfoy was decidedly not gracious while watching his favorite team suffer a crushing defeat. He swore constantly, making creative use of long words and mythology. Monty seemed to take it as a personal challenge to outswear Malfoy with James caught in the middle. Puddlemere sent a bludger at the Harpies Seeker and Monty went off in his trademark pseudo-vulgarity.
"You'd have me believe the Sorting Hat would've left the Boy-Who-Lived to fend for himself? Among the children of Death Eaters? Among actual
Harry sighs, looking down at his feet momentarily before peeking back up through his lashes. "Well, sir. I understand if you have to put me in
“I didn't know you were into such games, Hermione,” she says, stepping forward to stand over the tangled mess of limbs on the floor.
But Ben is already closing the door behind him as he retreats to the other side. And then the light - the only light source in the room, a stark bulb behind a protective metal cage above the door - goes out.
“Red,” she repeats, making a note without looking at the paper. “Anything else to add, Mrs. Flamel?”
"Are you looking for anything else in a home besides space for your work?" Malfoy elaborated slowly. Harry scowled and bit back a retort. How was he meant to answer questions properly if they weren't asked right in the first place?
Charming. He had to call him Charming now. For as long as this legendary wizarding war hero preferred, he would be called Charming in this office instead of Potty. Potter. Draco would have to think of some new insults for him. Privately, of course; he was a professional, after all.
Alec was showing Rose how to take apart the telly remote - what fresh hell - and Arthur was playing absentmindedly with Hugo while watching his dad out of the corner of his eye.
Draco shivers, but the soft leather of the armchair is comforting. It’s of supreme quality. He bats Potter’s hand off the stain, aiming for another peek at the strange design as the old crone goes on. Perhaps it’s a tradesman’s mark?
James shook his head. He knew better. He remembered all too clearly the blood-curdling scream he had heard one night after Alec came across a stray in the alley while taking out the rubbish. The huge, yowling tomcat had cornered him by the dumpster and the eight-year-old had actually wet himself in terror. James wasn't sure if the phobia had always been present or if that was the instigating incident, but he knew better than to allow Arthur to gloss over it carelessly.
" Potter says through clenched teeth, glaring at the door with more determination than Draco has ever seen.
Arthur said in that wavering, high-pitched voice. Hermione's heart broke a bit at the sound, wondering how she could ever get those two boys mixed up.
The crying subsided into sniffles and Harry smirked when the boy used his collar as a handkerchief, smearing snot and tears into it. Better than crying and attracting all sorts of strange stares from passersby, anyway.
He's wearing these childish clothes and wonders, but has learned not to ask, where they came from. Who they came from. The underground bunker smells like concrete and dust, not old sweat or - or blood. But perhaps there
"DADDY!" The door of his shop was suddenly under siege. Harry startled violently, cracking his head against the top of the table and sending a can of paint rolling across the shop.
Susan Bones had arrived that Monday morning to deliver her nephew Robert, and she and James spent the morning catching up while Monty entertained the boys. She worked for the Ministry now, following her aunt's footsteps, and seemed extremely sympathetic to the werewolf issues that James was pursuing. She was brilliant, really, she knew the ins and outs, who to charm and who to call out. James was able to mark down plenty of notes to go over with Hermione later.
"We all know Aurors are the reigning experts on mental health," Malfoy interrupted in a clipped tone. He seemed to be preparing a long speech and Ron wanted to die.
"Never in a sharing mood, are you, my dearest hoarding Dragon?" Blaise's slightly bemused and mostly amused expression was perfectly executed. What a fine actor.
"The asper coops." Malfoy gestured to the imposing brick building and then at another one in the far distance, across several more lines of fences.
Without warning, the telly sizzled and popped, leaving a trail of smoke pouring out of the controls on the side. In the time it took for Monty to glance over at it and look back at him, James's fingers had found the word he was looking for.
Then again, he thought as he let the door of the outhouse creak shut, at least whoever used this would get to go outside first. Bully for whoever that might be, but it would certainly never be him.
"Remember the counter-charm when you're settled," Ron said to Arty, referring to his charmed appearance.
"That is usually why one stops by an Open House," Malfoy drawled, "when they're not returning errant children, that is. Thank you, by the way."
James hesitated, waiting to see if Draco would revert back to his Healer self. They were one in the same, he knew, but that didn't mean he wanted to be picked apart. But Draco simply waited for him to continue, so he did.
"Potter..." Draco glanced at his father warily, waiting for the inevitable. "Nott wants Potter. I'm to retrieve him."
Potter's head snaps up. His eyes are blazing but unfocused. A perfect metaphor for the Golden Boy, in Draco's opinion.
Gingerbread walls, the cracks and pores sealed by a thin glaze, with thick icing seeping out of the joined corners. Quaffle-sized gumdrops and hard candies line the edges of the roof, perfectly spaced in channels of frozen custard. The glossy syrup windows promise a sweet surprise for anyone who licks the glass, and Draco’s tongue longs for a taste. Peppermint candy-cane pillars on the front porch hold up a stretched-taffy awning, where sugar crystals hang as a delicious mockery of the icicles that nearly claimed Draco's head hours ago. The front door of the cottage, the pièce de résistance: a colossal hunk of dark chocolate peppermint bark.
"Arthur's the one relying on attention from his cat, from older students, and from a manipulative, not-worthy-to-be-called pseudo-step-parent." James sat back, meeting Draco's firm gaze. "But even if he is pushing Alexander away, some time apart won't destroy their bond. They're not a reflection of you and Monty."
Inspired, he dove into his pencil box, looking for the right utensil. James waved to bring his attention back.
"James?" Monty called out, leading Remus to a seat next to the Thing. He nervously pulled out the chair but couldn't bring himself to sit, lest he find himself eye-level with that expressionless painted face. "There ye are..."
James had managed before Malfoy threatened to blast his other hip) split up amicably after the birth, leaving Scorpius to be raised by Malfoy and his mother. When Malfoy eventually returned to work, he reported, he was a wreck. Flooing in to check up on the baby upwards of twenty times a day, extending his lunch hour to spend more time at home staring into the crib and forgetting to eat, finding any excuse to beg off early.
James let Anne out the window and turned around, expecting to feel a familiar rage, expecting to fight it out and rip Monty a new one, maybe throw some things. But upon seeing Monty's heartbroken face, James suddenly felt all the anger drain out of him. He
“Appearances matter,” Draco says in a rather snooty voice. From behind him, Blaise places a hand on his shoulder, shaking his head minutely as if it say,
For the first time in years, they made a blanket fort in the living room. Dad even used magic to enlarge one of the blankets, floating it high overhead so it felt more like a blanket castle. Robert was appropriately enthused over the hot cocoa and Alec, delirious with sugar and no sleep, even summoned the courage to feed a soaked marshmallow to Leonard.
Monty snorted at their sign for Quidditch - a Q that wobbled through the air - and imagined Malfoy with a bloody nose and a broom up his arse.
"Prescribed by St. Mungo's and filled by Starr's Apothecary," she corrected as she sent the vials floating out of the room and down the hall. "We don't have much in the way of your family history, Mr. Charming, but it's possible you are susceptible to hemophilia given the wrong combination of potions. It's rare, but that's our working theory for now."
The sight of the boys threw Draco back to that day in Madam Malkin’s almost twenty years ago: they were dressed as Muggles, just as Potter himself had been that day. But instead of oversized and threadbare rags, one of the Potter-clones wore some sort of denim coverall piece that must have been a cosmic joke. It was stained everywhere with bright paint and dark ink, the straps at his shoulders were twisted haphazardly, and the trouser cuffs were rolled up unevenly. His sneakers were pink -
"Too bloody hot for this," Draco whispers. He remembers all too clearly the time Potter and his friends were…guests…at Malfoy Manor, and decides it's wise to skip the why of what's happening in Scarhead's head right now. "Ease up, Potter. We're locked in, yes, but there's food, so she's not the worst warden. For all we know, she really does just want her privacy for the night. She's working on breakfast."
. Now was the time for hysterics! All he wanted out of today was a lazy morning, a late breakfast, maybe some flying, and to catch a show after supper at his favorite restaurant. Instead he was led on a wild niffler chase all over the northern hemisphere. In
James hunched down even lower under Tony's gasping, twitching body and the curse hit the Auror on the shoulder, blasting it to pieces and setting off a ringing sound in his ears. James felt the sheer force of the spell knock into him and he was sure he'd either be hit with the next one or pummeled into the floor under Tony's body if he kept using him as a shield. He rolled out from under the bloody mess, getting caught against the firepoker in Tony's chest. He twisted free, his hip was screaming in pain, and lifted his wand -
And as an Unspeakable, he didn't need Draco to just hand over the answers. He could figure it out on his own.
A burning smell assaulted his sensitive nose and the Thing's head began shaking and popping up and down.
His stomach did a big fluttering flip, ten times more powerful than when Sirius had first called him Haz. Haz, not Adam, or Addy, or 'Adam Marcus Schmidt!' when he was in trouble. Haz was his very own, and it felt even truer than 'Harry' after years of screaming that that was his name.
"They split," Dean said. Malfoy didn't seem to take that in so he bent close to the blond's face and practically shouted: "Monty and Harry split up two weeks ago! That's why we've ambushed him tonight. To cheer him up, not set him off!"
"Father, let it go!" Draco started peeling each finger back one at a time while the owl hooted in distress.
Harry bit his lip and thought of Hermione in first year, bemoaning the lack of wood to start a fire.
Alec had already pried off the back and was poking around inside the device, wearing his terribly stupid Inventor's Goggles. A strap around his head held a series of magnifying lenses that were glued into metal rings on flexible goose-neck spokes. Alec would twist the lenses closer or farther, adjusting as needed while he poked around at tiny wires. And he looked bonkers.
Astoria faced forward on the settee, hunching her back in a brutish way that would have sent the rest of the Greengrass family into hysterics if they'd witnessed it. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw her watch the fire as if she'd learned the art of divination from the Greek oracle. She may have done. Draco had no idea what she was up to these days.
James laughed outright at the story of Malfoy blackmailing his friend Blaise into taking Polyjuice Potion to impersonate him so that he could skip a four-hour budget meeting. He had treated himself and Scorpius to a mid-day field trip.
Harry threw his head back and laughed, feeling as if he could fill the bright blue sky with it one of these days.
He demonstrated the first part of the sign again and Draco felt a flutter in his chest as he practiced it for himself. A sign of his very own, one that James had thought to create himself! Anything James Charming put his brilliant hands on turned to gold, he knew, and this would be no different than the box of constellation chocolates. It would be perfect. Draco would treasure it.
But Ron was barely listening. He pushed past Robards and approached Draco and Narcissa Malfoy just as another Auror released them.
"I suppose your Weasley clan will be feeling it the most,” he says. “All forty-seven paychecks cut back at once. Pity.”
, he said urgently, hoping to finally speak his piece. Communicate, Hermione had told him. Monty had always been a baker at heart and they had talked about expanding into baked goods before. James was always up for a challenge but adding a bakery unit was just too much for their dynamic.
Alec, on the other hand, was masquerading as Teddy Lupin, who had donated a hair to something called Polyjuice Potion. He was tall and white, with mousy brown hair and a small round face. Teddy himself was on the other end of the platform with his father; he was sporting his trademark turquoise hair and had changed his nose, cheeks, and eyes for the occasion. Lupin - no,
"A nice one?" he suggests. "One who recognizes the importance of maintaining steady blood sugar levels whilst traversing treacherous terrain!"
James saw on the telly once, years ago, a trashy daytime program that was pumping the studio audience full of wishy washy relationship advice right alongside recipes for Halloween treats. While James was taking notes on the recipes - nearly all of which ended up bunk - he idly listened to the host speaking with a woman in the audience who had recently divorced.
Harry shook his head. "The trees were..." He gestured vaguely over his head. He didn't know what exactly was setting off alarm bells, but he knew it just wasn't right. Even on the clearest of days, those tall trees would cast dreadful shadows and block him in.
James snorted and looked up theatrically as if to peek into his own brain to check for ego-swelling, but then his vision blurred with tears and the game was ruined. His face crumpled. Draco hesitated, then brought up his other hand to stroke his hair.
"Killing Curse," Weasley grunted, looking pale under his freckles. "He dodged it and tried to keep him away from the kitchen and the stairs, to keep him from the boys. He didn't have his wand - I
, James said, trying in vain to be subtle. He could see Fred and George clearly in his mind, the both of them trading off in their speech, always in perfect sync. He could see the funeral, somewhere in the far corners of his mind. Anytime Arty did something particularly stupid or Alec nearly electrocuted himself, James remembered George being left without his Fred.
There was an uncomfortable silence, the kind that made Monty's stomach hurt. Hermione's eyes were glistening in a horrible way. Alec had stopped scraping his fork listlessly around his plate, apparently frozen under so many stares. Monty cleared his throat loudly, coughed, then cleared it again.
It isn't until three days - he can count them now - after his rescue that he learns his captor's actual name. But he finds it doesn't even matter. It doesn't matter. None of him matters to Harry anymore. He wonders how much of his curiosity over the years - trying to solve this mystery, to suss out any clues as to his identity, his history, his motivations - was survival and how much was just trying to fill the cruelly empty void.
The Muggle woman James had hired to mind the shop was around James's age and Draco chose not to torture himself over the fact that he was relieved to learn she was married. The Gryffindor ponce had enough gallantry in him that Draco feared he could get overly attached to a suitably sympathetic prospect, and six-months-along Beatrice had the same happy-go-lucky attitude that Gibbs had used to reel James in.
"Greg?" Draco straightened up from his stooped position. "For what?" Gregory Goyle was a bit of a brute in their school days under Draco's command, but left to his own devices, he wouldn't hurt a fly. He preferred to focus on his music. What trouble could he have possibly gotten into while still living with his mumsy?

"As he said," she began, "it was a tumultuous time in our world. Harry was in the thick of it, he was on everyone's list, and that
Time seemed to slow down and speed up all at once. Harry was grinning widely, all smugness left behind for teary green eyes and a reprehensible level of sincerity. Harry was saying something, but the ringing in Draco's ears drowned it out. He remembered kissing Harry at this dried up well years ago. It was cold then, too - just past Christmas, in fact. And he remembered kissing Harry in their new home months ago, surrounded by old photos and new furniture. And, as if watching a memory in a pensieve, he saw himself reach out and haul Harry to his feet now, cramming their lips together in a heated kiss that could melt any frost.
"I confirmed it myself with Forensics," Unspeakable Zabini said. "It's a clean match. Or as clean as it'll get - not much of it left."
, he said stuff - an' makin' potions, there was a bloke wae red eyes an' no nose - bloody hell - an' those wands you lot have, 'cept they, er...the people cast horrible spells, pain and death..."
," Potter growls through gritted teeth. "But when you judge someone, a whole group, before you know them—that's what starts wars."
She grimaced. "He rings sometimes, late at night," she said gently. James turned his head away, scowling, and Ron frowned at her for spilling the beans. "He asks for advice - I've only told him to stop being a caveman and start communicating with you properly. The same as I've told you, so stop giving me that look, James Potter!" Ron snorted and James blinked at her, his expression morphing into something closer to bemusement. "Charming, I mean. You know who you are."
he thinks desperately. He holds the old woman's gaze challengingly. Well, he holds it, at least. He's not sure how much fight he has left in him but he can stare an old tart down if it means she doesn't spot Potter.
Montague was sentenced to one year, Vane ten. Both were talented potioneers - along with Nott - but Vane had a special talent and a long-time romantic (read, obsessive) vendetta against Harry Potter. She was the one who altered every single one of his pain potions last fall, leading to his close call after Helen's mauling. (Ron would forever treasure the memory of Unspeakable Hermione Granger-Weasley explaining to the Wizengamot what a robot was and why it wasn't on trial as well.) Montague supplied the Polyjuice to disguise Anthony as Monty that winter, and they were only able to pin him with trafficking a regulated potion with malicious intent.
Still working on a name for the cat, weighing some options.  Trying to keep you on the edge of your seat, stay tuned.
"Stop it, now," he murmured into James's hair. "S'alright, ma little fish... Jus' a bit of water, cannae do
The twins' bedroom door was ajar and James's heart sank when he heard it: a distinct and unmistakable meow.
be his Mind Healer." Draco spluttered, blinked, checked her face to see if she was serious, and choked on another witty retort. "I mean it, Dragon. It's not right. There are rules and ethics against this sort of thing for a reason - "
Magic. Always an answer for everything. Except for the James Charming conundrum, of course. Dr. Abbott had concluded, at the end of the physical, that there was nothing to be done for his lost voice and little to be done for his damaged hip. James had accepted the one month supply of potions, despite Monty warning him to look into the risks of painkiller addiction. James was a sharp bird, he just didn't have any common sense. Magical painkillers were likely just as addictive and dangerous as the normal stuff. And bone-strengthening draughts? Sounded like milk, if someone bothered to ask Monty. But no one ever did. Because Monty's opinions didn't matter now that magic was back in James's life.
"Nothing, she's dead," he said simply. And then he just went on licking his hand clean like Harry's world hadn't just tipped over on its side.
Draco wants to abandon the chair now, but that seems rude. She’s right. He owes her a chance to explain, even if cooking magic goes against everything he’s been taught since childhood about magic purity—about tainted, undead souls and madness. He’s been wrong before.
“Is this romantic, Draco?” Blaise asked too casually as he reached the landing. Draco shoved him hard in the back because he didn’t have a knife to return the favor.
James grinned broadly as his wand translated the random crudeness. Draco blinked and James said it again:
James said incredulously. They weren't even married and Monty felt entitled to his life savings for a second fucking shop that he didn't want!
she replied, looking to Hermione. To Monty's surprise, Hermione nodded her agreement without a translation. She was a sharp lass and must have picked up a lot in the past few months.
Ron appears out of nowhere, sweaty and covered in chalk. He ushers people back, strategically placing himself closer to Viktor. In a whirlwind of activity - flailing hands, shouted questions - Draco and Viktor disappear through the crowd, leaving Harry standing alone among the maxi-dresses.
under her breath a few times, offering nothing else in response. Arthur clears his throat again, shooting a desperate look at Percy, who simply nods dutifully and takes a note.
It’s a moderately sized feather, oiled to shine, pressed flat, and sealed between thin layers of plastic. A bookmark. Possibly homemade, with the right materials.
The Malfoy Mess was just as daunting as the Monty Mayhem and James was stuck. Should he talk to Monty about how to make things right with Malfoy? James could do with a friend that wasn't Harry Potter's choice. Or should he request another appointment with Malfoy to learn how to deal with Monty's insecurities? He could do with Monty's peace of mind, if he just knew how to bring it out.
His voice carries a note of finality and Draco falls silent. They stop bellowing the fire and it begins to peter out. They move on, warm and notably less prickly than before. Potter drifts from the path again. It's been at least an hour since they left, perhaps they should turn back—
"I'll tell you a trade secret. This brand here, they got the mallowmarsh recipe, copied it right out. But they've kept it under wraps, yeah? Don't want a lawsuit. This is what you want, the one with the blue logo. Er - toothpaste-free, I promise."
"Er, what's happening?" Ron asked, looking over his shoulder at the door Arty and James had disappeared through on their way upstairs.
“The signage around the store,” she corrects. “Is it only white people who buy fresh fruit? No. So why is it just white or ethnically ambiguous models that are smelling strawberries and unpacking picnic baskets in the photos?”
He froze in place and had to be pushed forward - none too gently - by Draco. The room was just as he imagined it in the yoga parler with Pansy, but so much
Draco watched with a carefully blank face as Charming absorbed his words. The man was wearing that hideous yellow jumper again, the one with stains and discolored blotches all over. His baggy, tattered, paint-stained trousers were the worst Draco had seen since Potter himself was traipsing about unchecked. His hair was ruffled from the wind - surely he hadn't left the house like that - and his eyes were comically huge as he took in Draco's meaning.
Unable to summon an answer, he nodded once. That didn't seem to be enough, so he added, "I will apologize." All of this fuss for one flippant comment about saving his damsel from the mad Muggle...
. They don't, and marshmallow isn't even a brand. Look, they're on the bottom shelf - there's different brands
to her. She clasped a hand to Alec's head, pressing his face into the crook of her neck to keep him from watching. Draco blinked owlishly at the struggling boy in his lap as he used those long nimble fingers to grapple him against his chest.
They pulled apart and Harry kept his eyes closed, unable to see what Draco was doing and therefore not sure if he was supposed to open them.
James had never felt so invisible in a crowd, but he couldn't stop his own staring. His boys, stubborn proponents of dressing themselves ever since they were old enough to open the wardrobe, had never managed to look as mismatched as they did today. Arthur was almost himself, but his skin was significantly lightened and he looked ethnically ambiguous. His hair was charmed into a copper color that nearly blended in with his new skin. Under these changes, however, the same bone structure and green eyes remained.
A rude gesture that didn't require a translation was his only answer before Harry snatched his wand and stormed - stumbled - upstairs. After a long moment, Ron caught Tony's eye and jerked his head at the door. Auror Goldstein followed, looking as if he'd rather be anywhere else tonight than playing nanny to a drunk infant.
Ginny and her fellow Chasers were superb, to say the least. James was on the edge of his seat and even found himself shouting silently along with the rest of the crowd when she pulled off a tight roll or a set of loops. Puddlemere put up a fight, but the Harpies were fierce. In the end, even after Puddlemere caught the snitch, the Harpies were victorious.
staring back at him curiously. He stepped forward and cleared his throat, running nervous fingers along the envelopes in his hands. "Is your mother around? This is usually a conversation best had as a family."
"We had to move cos Dad didn' like the area or somethin'," Arthur tried to recall. There was some sort of break in that had spooked Dad into moving...was it their flat that had been burgled or the neighbor's? They were little more than toddlers at the time; he only remembered Dad's long rants in which they had both picked up some interesting swear-signs. "Then he started a' the bakery wae Monty."
"But the magic school has - er, Quidditch? That sport from the picture?" Arthur protested weakly. Dad gave him an unimpressed look.
"They're long-gone," Malfoy said far too kindly, the twit, apparently under the impression that he had a dire phobia of snakes.
Harry Potter squinted at him suspiciously from one of the three guest chairs in Draco’s office. The look was almost identical to a million green-eyed glares Draco had received in Hogwarts. But it was an empty, vague suspicion. Draco hid his smirk. Potty had nothing on him now and, even better, he couldn’t even remember the days when Draco truly was up to no good. Granger claimed that he only had a tenebrous recollection of some “blond git,” and Draco took no small amount of pride in the fact that he had been remembered in the desolate landscape of Potter’s memories.
"It's a wonderful problem to have, don't mistake me," McGonagall sighed from behind the Headmistress's desk, handing over a long piece of parchment. No less than three dozen names were listed; a quarter of the names had sharp little checks next to them. "We haven't had this many Muggleborns on the register in nearly a century! But I only have so much time to make these visits, and Filius won't return for another three weeks, Hagrid is still in Romania, Neville can't be spared from Greenhouse Ten... I'm afraid I have to start cutting the holidays short for the rest of our staff if we're to get anywhere with this list before August."
He sneaked a glance to his other side, reaching out a quivering hand to find his dad, like he had when they had learned how to swim. But Dad was gone!
you, you twat!" his friend hissed. Draco snorted, opening his eyes to look pointedly at their surroundings. The Janus Thickey Ward was not exactly teeming with gossips.
"I provide private funds in exchange for - services rendered?" James scrunched his face in disgust and Draco, thankfully, seemed to agree. "Awful phrasing. It was an understanding, anyway. We were and still are on perfectly good terms. And she's not a terrible lay, for a girl. She let me - "
He was practically vibrating when Pansy brought them back into the yoga parlor. They set right to work sketching his space and her skilled hand quickly brought it out of his head for the others to see. Before he was quite finished admiring it, she snapped closed the sketchbook, bid them farewell, and traipsed away.
"Listen, he's still - I don't know - but he's fun, now," he protested weakly as they clung to each other, literal tears streaming down their faces. He didn't think it was
It was one thing to wave a magic wand and cause proper magic spells to happen, but a sentient broom? Or was it Dad’s magic, without a wand? Was it innate or learned? Did the ability to summon a broom grow stronger as one got older? Alec filed these questions away for later. Hermione was a wealth of information.
He threw the wand at the wall and the gushing sound broke off suddenly, as soon as the stick left his hand.
Harry snorted despite himself. He didn't know if Kim was always this daffy or if it was played up for his benefit.
James stared between the formal invitation and the huge vase of flowers that Draco's eagle owl had carted in at lunch. Weeks of trading stiff letters had led to this: Malfoy Senior himself, stooping low to fix what his sharp-tongued son had done. He could only imagine what conversation had prompted such an act of desperation.
Arthur growled lowly as he stroked the cat, but when he spoke next, he sounded a little less antagonistic. "Al an' a found her wae some lads on the way home from school."
These are the Days of Lenny. Without windows but with just enough routine, Harry estimates it has been several years in this little underground room. Probably not ten, though it feels like it. It's impossible to be sure of time, so he defines it by whatever he's calling his captor nowadays.
"I suppose I could put in an emergency request for a pensieve today," she considered. "I should be able to get one before tonight… Will you pull out Harry's old photo album from the attic before you head off?" Ron nodded, not quite looking like he heard. "Can you secure his wand? The Aurors still have it, don’t they? That'll be the fastest way to get him to believe us - "
The tiny Charming flat was rapidly becoming more like a home to him than Malfoy Manor had ever been. Not that he hated his childhood home...not exactly. It was tainted, of course, by the piss, shit, and tears of prisoners in their cellars, the screams of a certain bushy-haired Muggleborn in the west wing, the masked figures who held him and his family hostage under the threat of a glorified, animated, noseless corpse -
James was horror-struck, his hands flying through the letters. Harry Potter's closest friends were coming to dinner
The world spun, the sky tipped - his thighs hit the stone wall behind them and then they were stumbling - grappling - falling -
Arthur thumped miserably downstairs. They still had to work, of course, even if everything felt wrong without Monty. The chocolates wouldn't make themselves and while Dad would let them off if they made their case, Alec would never let Arthur skive.
“I figured, if you let them in,” Draco heard the other Auror mumble to herself as they made their way up.
He searched, but there was no date. It came from the top of the stack so it may have been quite recent. His stomach churned.
“Just because I didn't read the instruction manual, doesn't mean you're broken,” he says, and watches in a sort of detached fascination as Harry uncoils ever so slightly.
"Worked out in the end, though. Started sellin' 'is candies at the bakery an' through those mail-orders tha' Remus likes so much." He winked conspiratorially at the pale man. "That was all well an' good when he got sacked, he was able tae work outa his own kitchen for a while before he finally got this place, then a came along tae help out. Then a s'pose we ended up back in the manager's office for sexual - "
"I don't want your hopes to be dashed if this doesn't turn out, Remus," she said, her voice oddly gentle against the firm line of her mouth as she followed him down the street toward Charming Chocolates. It was darker now, the street lights were on and the crowd was just beginning to thin. "And not a word of this to his friends until we're certain."
"There's an opening at Hogwarts," Harry blurted out, mind whirling. Luna had told him about someone in the circus who she referred to as 'they,' and he supposed this must be like that. "Hooch is retiring, or taking leave or something. You should apply. You were a brilliant flyer at Hogwarts!" When he -
If he was uncomfortable on the crowded street, he was in hell now. The shop was no bigger on the inside than it looked on the outside -
Harry dropped some truly foul language - on purpose! - which made Draco laugh louder than he'd ever heard. Harry got the feeling he hadn't done it right - the swearing - but he didn't mind because he did it and didn't feel sick afterwards...on the contrary, he felt on top of the world!
"And do you remember how, when Kingsley sent a letter saying we could come out of hiding, you hid the message for another week so we could stay a little longer?"
"So..." Dean started, sucking on his lip noisily. "Do you have a taste for war against Harry or are you just thick?"
Scorpius straightened in his seat and recited: “This kitchen comes with all-new stainless steel appliances, and check out that gorgeous backsplash!” Malfoy patted his blond head and then turned to Harry, who failed to hide his glee in time.
Remus nearly forgot why they were there until he heard McGonagall gasp quietly next to him. She gripped her cane with white knuckles and stared over the head of the Thing as a man emerged from a large pantry, a stack of plates in one hand and a cane of his own in the other.
" - left us wae the nanny all day. When he woke up, he got all confused cos 'is watch said eight o'clock but no one was there. Thought it were eight in the
Sirius gave a low whistle of appreciation. "Didn't see how you'd improve on my old space, Malfoy, but I have to admit..."
They fight. They always fight. Fighting is in their blood; it’s the fire that gets them out of bed and into the Great Hall. It fuels their appetites when grief and trauma would have food turn to ash in their mouths.
Monty must have seen his sincerity because he smiled in that wide and deep way that made James's chest hurt a bit. Montgomery Gibbs was everything that was gorgeous and warm in the world when he smiled. They leaned over the table and shared a soft kiss, and James smiled back.
Alec closed the door behind his brother and perched on the stool at his desk, waiting with bated breath. They'd noticed something was off with Monty and Dad lately. They hardly spoke to each other since the boys had come home. And Monty, Arthur pointed out, hadn't touched Dad once all week. Not a hug, not a nudge, not even a friendly pat. Nothing. Something was wrong.
Of course, as he will learn in the Days of Denny, it's his mouth that gets him into trouble more often than not.
Draco peers closer as he passes and nods sagely. Yes. There’s a distinct nipple stretched out on the cream-colored lamp shade, like the red spot on Jupiter. How whimsical.
“I think maybe - ” He hesitated and the annoyance in James’s expression twisted into something else. Caution? “I think maybe I could have said something hurtful.”
"In our first meeting, the one in which you agreed to pursue my care, you indicated that you were not interested in gaining full memory recovery," he said while he studied a form in James's file, as if reciting from a script. "Unless you've changed your mind, I suggest we leave Mr. Potter out of our sessions. From my own experience, I can assure you that he will only bring us trouble. Do you understand, Mr.
Potter shuts his gob and the room is eerily silent. Those lips, still glossy with syrup, are pressed firmly together and his face looks oddly naked without his glasses. The little indentations on his nose make him look softer. Sleepier. Draco wonders if he can get him to sleep at all tonight or if even the mattress is too much for him now. He regrets snapping at him. Whether the danger is real or imagined, the terror certainly is.
James lifted his wine glass - it was white wine, he saw now - and extended his pinky-finger daintily.
“It’s hot,” he adds usefully. Fuck, but it’s hard to think. The heat is everywhere, pressing in on them from all sides. The air is heavy, hard to breathe. There’s an awful tingling sensation in his legs and he chances a glance down. His knees and shins are blistering before his eyes in angry red circles that match the ones on Potter’s back.
Ben eventually relents when Harry passes out again and badly chips a tooth on his way down. Harry eats his pudding - it makes his stomach cramp up and his tooth ache ferociously - and then chucks the empty cup at Ben's face. Gods, he hates looking at him.
"What have you done to your poor fingers, son?" Denny had said back then, tending to his bloody nails with nauseating care before retrieving a pair of clippers. That was the last time Harry had nails long enough to scratch anything.
, Mr. Charming," Draco repeated loudly and pointedly. "At the very least, you'll hobble out of the examination with Healer's orders to eat something other than chocolate." And wasn't that the crux of this mess, the fire behind Draco's foul mood this week, that the brilliance behind Charming Chocolates came down to
They spent the rest of the evening eating luxurious chocolate and telling Harry and his family about themselves. Remus was quiet - Ron wondered if the story of Aarti’s passing was hitting close to home or if he was just overwhelmed by the chocolate - but Teddy forged a fast bond with the boys. George was their personal hero, it seemed, and Harry looked equal parts delighted and concerned about the inevitable trip to the Diagon Alley joke shop. Ron wondered if the twins knew yet that George himself had been a twin once, if there was some weird twin energy unfolding between them now.
Harry narrows his eyes at Draco before seeming to arrive at a decision. Nodding to himself, he remains silent as he finishes his sandwich. Draco watches, waiting, as Harry starts to work on a tupperware container of cold beans, tossing liberal amounts of salt and pepper over it.
of Pansy Parkinson. Pansy, like Hermione, had managed to grow into her look in such a fitting way that Harry had trouble recalling the pug-nosed girl from Hogwarts. They were all awkward, misformed teenagers back then, after all. Harry was only just now coming into himself.
"The unicorn?" It feels like he's talking about something other than a sparkly magic horse now, but it's cold and Draco can't be arsed to figure it out. Potter doesn't answer.
"Come on, Harry," Ron went on, stepping over to allow Remus and Teddy inside. "Remus teaches Defense, he'll be in the compartment with them the whole time. And there's a team of Aurors next door, so you don't need to worry!"
Harry flinched instinctively, but Kim's voice was already telling him that this was misdirected aggression and he wasn't in any more danger than he was seconds ago. And then his gritty thoughts caught up to what he'd said.
Not for the first time that morning, Hermione wondered if it was best that Harry had lost the memories of his dark past. A fresh start...
"H-hot," Draco chokes out, swallowing back tears. Nothing like being grilled alive to knock around one's sense of pride.
He didn't want Monty to be right. He didn't want to admit to the boys, much less to himself, that there
“Thank you once again for your eloquent input, Mr. Gibbs. We’ll table that if you’re unsure, Mr. Charming, there’s no need to decide right away. Is there anything you would like to work on for your own purposes?” Draco took comfort in his old familiar Mind Healer script, even if he was using it on his old-school-enemy-turned-amnesiac-Muggle.
It seemed like a brilliant idea at the time, but he was having second thoughts now. Now that he was staring at an enormous chocolate penis on his kitchen counter, he wasn't sure why he'd ever thought it could be romantic. It was
Alec bit his lip and didn't answer, but that was all the confirmation he needed. Arthur Charming had smuggled a damn cat into the flat. Monty wondered if his beautiful idiot had spontaneously combusted yet. That wouldn't get him out of making dinner tomorrow, the fiend.
He looked forward to grandchildren for one reason: together, they could team up properly against the twins and put Al and Ar through at least a fraction of the hell that they subjected him to. Or the hell that he subjected himself to, in the case of this backfired plot for revenge.
"She's going to eat us," Potter says flatly, his voice muffled by his knees. Draco tries to mask his flare of annoyance. The twit's clearly going through some sort of…thing.
"Go on then, open it!" Longbottom rallies when the post is delivered. Potter seems to recognize the Malfoy eagle owl standing in his waffles and Draco winks at his questioning glance.
"Carry me!" he demanded, and Harry found himself complying. He was too big to carry in his arms, but with some fumbling, he got the boy settled on his back with his legs gripping his waist and his arms wrapped uncomfortably around his neck.
don’t even wanna know, so they keep tearing after each other like they’re arch enemies or something. Hermione says the best thing to do is just lock ‘em in a dressing room overnight, let nature run its course. But I think they may actually kill each other if they have half a chance, sexual tension or not.”
When he was feeling a bit better about the boys, about his memories and his wand, he had made the mistake of letting Malfoy see only what was making him happy. And now all he was left with was a mess of wobbly coping mechanisms and a smothering boyfriend prone to jealousy and worry.
Harry watched in detached fascination as Malfoy scooped some ice from the Muggle freeze box into a little plastic bag before applying it gently to a seemingly random spot on his son’s leg. The men in the corner of the kitchen were giving him significant looks, but he had no idea what they were signifying. He shrugged at them and they went back to giggling at each other.
Still reeling, Harry tried to imagine that special space in his mind's eye becoming a reality well before Christmas. It was beyond his wildest imagination - and he had quite the imagination - but he couldn't help the thought that Draco was keeping some vital information close to his chest.
Except it felt fake now. Nothing felt average or normal anymore. A witch and wizard turned up yesterday. They sent his furniture flying through the air and invited his sons to magic school. They claimed to know him, his other life, they claimed he was some bigshot war hero with a penchant for drama.
James yanked Alec and Arthur from their position between the settee and table, pulling them behind him as he moved back from the furniture that cluttered up their space. They were all disarmed, not killed outright, so he was expecting some sort of stand-off, some questions or demands, but then -
“And you shouldn’t speak with your mouth full, but I suppose if they can’t afford enough etiquette lessons for their own baker’s dozen, they won’t spare any on the strays.”
that Monty knew better. Business wasn't something to be "good at," it was pouring over account balances, micro- and macro-transactions, supply orders, inventory, and research. None of which Monty ever did; all of which Monty watched
Draco settles back into the couch – he doesn't remember when he stood – and they try again. Draco can't stand a cold Harry Potter. He fell in love with his fire, his fight, and this is too much like the prickly first few weeks of their business partnership. He wheedles his way back in. He's good at that. Picking. Poking. Finding just the right words to ease them back into a conversation he very much doesn't want to have.
On top of increasingly violent Prism raids, a rising blood purist movement in the south, and anti-werewolf rhetoric turning into dozens of cases of harassment, the Ministry now had to contend with disappearance of Auror Anthony Goldstein.
Throwing his weight forward with renewed strength, he clumsily forces the stunned man to walk backwards out of his prison, towards the trap-door.
“Let’s get you settled, dumplings,” the old sorceress coos. Her withered hands are strong as she helps them up. On their way out, Potter strokes a lamp shade and giggles serenely.
“I know I’m safe, why does everyone keep telling me that?” he spat. Still kneeling on the floor at his feet, Sirius was watching him with wide, reverent eyes. “What’s wrong with you?” Sirius flinched and Harry felt like a git. “I didn’t - I’m...sorry,” he offered, not knowing what to say. He seemed to have lost his words...or at least all the words he hadn’t used in the past fourteen years.
Draco wants to lash out, but the last time he dismissed Potter’s theory, it turned out to be true and now they’re being cooked alive. He takes a deep, purposeful breath. It doesn’t do much good except to pull more heat into his lungs.
“Do you think you can manage for another hour, Scorpius?” Malfoy asked quietly as he hefted him onto a tall stool at the breakfast bar. Harry shuffled his feet, thoroughly regretting not taking his leave earlier. He couldn’t leave now, could he? Then it would be obvious that he should’ve left already.
James pushed a hand through his hair, pulling at the locks in frustration. Twenty-four hours of pouting for being one hour tardy!
Where shelves wouldn't fit, they had hung framed photos, newspaper clippings, the boys' art, and even a few pieces of school work that James was particularly proud of. A vertical strip of the back wall featured several ribbons and certificates that Alec had won in science fairs and robotics club. James had framed all six pages of Arty's original short story that even Mr. Alan had grudgingly admitted showed some promise. More than his original recipes and clever holiday themes, James loved to show customers these little treasures. Last summer, just before closing one night, he spotted someone reading the story in its entirety and he kept the shop open an extra half hour so they could finish it. Arty was embarrassed but pleased when James marched him over to meet his fan.
"Yeah, an' he weren't s'posed tae do that," he said, grimacing. "Got in a right bit o' trouble when the Ministry found out, even though Ted's mum was a regular human witch." James sat up straighter and, dishes put away, Monty went to join him at the table. "Teddy got taken away for a bit," he went on grimly. "Stayed in hospital fer a month tae make sure his genetics were all human and he weren't bein' abused or nothin'. Yer wizards don' like werewolves much. Don' treat 'em right at all, if ye ask me."
"You'll want to hear about Hogw - er, our program," Remus insisted. "Trust me. Shall I return at eight o'clock?"
"Now anyone else in the world would know a sunset picnic in the park is romantic, but no our James. So it came tae be Valentine's Day an' a make him a nice heart-shaped cake. Stayed up all night tae do it an' had no time fer the frosting but a bring it in tae work fer 'im anyway. Leave it in a pretty little box wae his name on it..." He paused, letting the tension build. "Come tae find him an hour in tae our shift an' dinnae see it anywhere an' he dinnae say nothin', so a reckon he's flustered, like 'e gets sometimes. Only later when am workin' the counter, some old bint is tryin' tae buy ma heart-shaped cake! It had got fancy piping over it by then, but a know ma cake. Ma daft pigeon only went an' decorated it, put it on the block for sale!"
“Mr. Potter?” The Healer from earlier was here again, but he didn’t turn away from the window. The view was nothing special - just the side of a Muggle shopping center - but he thought the clouds might clear soon and he didn’t want to miss his first glimpse of sunshine in fourteen years. “Mr. Potter, you’ve visitors,” she went on in the same gentle voice, as if speaking to a frightened animal. Did they really think he was feral?
"No." She sent him a stern look. "I'm saying it's only natural for your mind to assume the worst when someone advances on you during an argument. It's only natural for you to pull your wand, but...well, it may have made things worse. Monty's sensitive, you know, and I'm sure he was hurt that you thought he would do something to you. All those emotions running high… It may not have been as awful as either of you think."
Nott, however, was still awaiting trial. It was a farce. He had carved out a plea deal, throwing out nearly a dozen names to save his own skin. He was the one to drug Zabini and zap Malfoy's hair off; he brewed and sent the Sparking Potion that nearly blew up Harry and Rachel; what was more, he'd even admitted that he was the one to entice Anthony into joining their "potions project" shortly after leaving Hogwarts. Of the three Starr's Apothecary potioneers, it was Nott who should rot in Azkaban for decades. But he was supplying the Department with information that had thus far taken down the largest Prism operation in Europe. So it would be house arrest for him, whenever his trial came around.
"But yer usin' yer wand more," Monty went on. It was one thing to see Hermione set a tea kettle to boil instantly or Ron to repair the facing on their front counter. But nowadays he was watching James summon his potion from down the hall, or light his way to the loo at night, or even keep the bathwater hot for hours while adding all sorts of goopy potions to the bubbles... Monty's little bird doing magic was an odd sight.
Halloween was coming up and the shop was overflowing with witchcraft-themed decorations and treats. Actual vintage cauldrons, donated by the Weasleys, were full of cauldron-truffles, each with a surprise "potion" ganache filling. Pointed witch-hats were upturned and suspended from the ceiling, carrying chocolate snaps decorated with tiny witch faces. The pièce de résistance was an enormous spellbook mounted on a pedestal: large flat bars of dark chocolate made the covers, thin white chocolate snaps (individually wrapped for quick and easy sales) made up the pages. James seemed particularly inspired this Halloween.
James met them in the sitting room while Auror Rachel No-Surname and Auror Red Weasel retreated downstairs. Blaise lasted all of three minutes while James prepared the tea - adding two heaping sugars to Draco’s - before the uncomfortable silence became too much for the always-speaking Unspeakable.
Even if Potter's busy being a hero, Draco has the sense to force him to put his damn shoes on. He'll have to wax poetic about the state of those trainers later, because as soon as they're on, they're stuffing their hot wands in their pants—he wishes that were a euphemism—and shuffling toward the door. They keep the clothes on the floor as an added buffer—Potter mumbles something about melted rubber soles and Draco adds it as a point against his egregious choice in footwear—and pass over a sea of hot red bricks. Draco tries not to think about the fact that what he's smelling is
Draco closed his eyes and hummed his pleasure around the chocolate truffle, relishing how his front teeth sank through the firm outer shell and into the soft ganache within.
A steady thumping sound started on the floor above, in time with Sirius's favorite Muggle record. As fun as it seemed to dance around with his godfather without a care in the world, experience told him that Sirius would likely be in his skivvies right now.
the headline screamed, followed by a photo of Ron and Hermione in their auror robes speaking gravely to an entire pack of aurors. Harry counted himself lucky that he had yet to be papped since his escape from the bunker - he had the protective nature of the whole of Hogsmeade for this small mercy - or else his face would've ended up splashed across the front page and Malfoy would've seen it and everything would be ruined!
And now Dad was leaving the room, which was even better than his silence! Really, this was turning out too good to be true. Laughs were shared, the boys put a dent in Grosh's treats, Narcissa Malfoy was thoroughly charmed, and those green eyes looked at him with warmth again instead of...instead of whatever he'd seen that horrible morning in February, after his shit comment and little smirk. Hurt. Betrayal.
at the slightest brush of a finger. Alec stared into his half-empty glass and decided he didn't really care for the smell of milk.
Harry opened his mouth to respond but was interrupted. "Haz Blue! Pleased you could make it." Malfoy stalked over, his boots clicking sharply on the floor. He looked very important in business-casual dress, and very...good-postured. That surely accounted for the nice shape his torso made, shoulders firm and straight over his narrow hips. Harry's mouth was still open and he looked between Terry and Malfoy, unsure of whom to address.
“I knew that, I just - “ he broke off and waved his hand vaguely in explanation. He was twenty-eight now, apparently. It would be weird to call him Professor Lupin. “Good to see you. Figuratively speaking,” he added, gesturing to his bare face. He regretted breaking his glasses now, but he stood by the point he’d made in doing it.
He presses down against the tent in Potter's pants, drawing simultaneous moans from both of them. He can't quite convince himself that the heat in the room is a bad thing anymore when the best of the heat is
So Monty played along and watched the telly on low volume, insisting to Alec that he just wanted to finish this program and then he'd be off to bed, just like he had last night.
came Harry's muffled, miserable groan, his face planted in the grimy muck. Rattled, Draco didn't even catch the pun this time.
he demanded. They would never get anywhere on the bakery issue if they kept going back to this because Monty would never concede on this.
Temper or no temper, he knew, even as it was happening, that he was crossing some sort of line when he stormed over and wrenched the stick out of James's white-knuckle grip, flinging it into the far corner. James remained frozen on the spot while Monty went on, throwing every word he had in the hope that something would get across to his brick-wall of a boyfriend that had refused to listen to him these last couple months. There were words that may have belonged in a proper, less shouty row:
"I live with, er - my uncles right now. But I really should find my own place. I've started a little business, see, and I've been using the shed out back, but it's bl--blingin' hot," he caught himself before the swear could come out, but then immediately wanted to retract the other word and use
"James?" he called, testing the handle. It didn't budge. James tossed the wand back in his sock drawer and climbed into bed. "James, please..."
"I'll never eat meat again," he says as Potter winds his trousers around his blistered hands and grips the metal wire. He crouches low so that the ventilation holes, the ones where a door handle should have been, are at eye-level. He inserts the metal wire and begins a long, arduous process that Draco can't even begin to understand. "Potter…?"
James nodded quickly. It was a wise choice, as it turned out, because when Ron failed to cover up a long, drawn out snort, Malfoy flicked his wand. Suddenly Ron was swearing and threatening to arrest everyone while he clutched his foot. Malfoy seemed pleased and unaffected by the threats.
I'll be putting together a oneshot sequel so we can see a very Drarry Christmas, in which James gets his first Arthur Charming Original Tattoo! I'll add it onto this story as part of a series so I think if you subscribe, you should get a notification about it...?
"Dinnae think we should keep on wit those, tae be honest," he said. James sent him a sharp look. "This was a close call. James was doin' jus' fine wit the Muggle stuff."
with cats. He left his cane behind and flew up the stairs, obstinately ignoring the roaring pain in his hip.
"Yes - wait. You didn't take that mystery potion that showed up a few weeks ago, did you?" James pursed his lips and looked aside. "When?" he snapped.
"You can't blame Granger's accent for that one, no matter how close your offices are to one another."
Minutes pass and the unicorns disappear. The last rays of sunlight are fading fast and Potter still hasn't moved his pert arse. Draco clasps his hand—it's ice—and takes him away. They have to carry on.
"Right, I can return then if you'll pardon the interruption to dinner," Remus said quickly. "I really must insist that both parents are present. It's very important, you see. Very important. Yes, you'll understand once I explain the program, there's quite a bit to go through - "
Kim, his Mind Healer, was kind and funny and far too wise for her age. She was hardly older than him, after all. He never felt like she was patronizing him. In fact, she was the only one nowadays who made him feel like he was...well, if not right, then at least capable of arriving at what was right.
The others share a bleak, commiserating look. The swinging door to the break room pushes open and a small group of people - wearing suits and Visitor name-tags - bustles in; they look around and make notes on clipboards.
Draco felt a stab of blind panic - what if he'd meant to keep them private? He was snooping a bit, fine, but was this the same as perusing the bookshelf? Oh Merlin. Oh shit! He was doing exactly what he'd hated Potter for doing at Hogwarts, poking his nose into other people's private business! And he didn't even have a prophecy to urge him onto such half-baked shenanigans! Draco's head snapped back sharply, as if he were just physically assaulted with how stupid and hypocritical he was -
with magic?” Perhaps that’s what’s wrong with the Weasley clan, they’ve been cannibalizing their own magic for generations—
“Here,” she says, thrusting it in Pansy's face and lifting her chin in defiance of what just happened. “In case you’ve read all of Belrose, I thought you might like Adora Conti’s med school collection. This one’s called Defibrill My Heart.” On the floor, Pansy reaches for the book with both hands, making sure to brush against Hermione’s fingers. She accepts the book blindly, staring up at Hermione with an adoring expression.
and for Viktor's football team/position (which isn't specifically mentioned in this episode, but it's coming soon!), and Tami (
"They cuff him an' leave 'im on the floor, some fat lard's sittin' on his back while the others search for whatever poor blighter he's bludgeoned tae death. He cannae say anything tae explain himself so they think he's a blood-thirsty psychopath and take 'im down tae the police station, still cuffed. Monty shows up at the bakery for his shift at five an' there's caution tape everywhere, detectives swarmin', an' Da's not around for his shift but he's
"Don't," came his quiet warning. James froze on the spot, lifting his hands in a surrendering gesture but barely sparing Tony a glance. He nodded in what he hoped was a comforting way to Arthur, though he had no idea if it was misguided...if he could even hope to get the kids out of this alive.
"He has flashbacks," explained Alec, looking up at Ron with urgency. "That's what it was, right, Dad?" James nodded numbly, watching the Auror climb back to his feet. Alec stooped down and snatched up the stolen wands. "Here," he said, holding the two wands out to the trio of wary Aurors. "Just, maybe don't point it at him."
He didn’t know when Sirius had let himself into the shop, didn’t even notice the burst of frigid air he brought with him.
"Oh ma god," Monty's voice boomed out from the platform. "James, ye Richard!" James reached behind his back awkwardly and fumbled the window shut, muffling Monty's latest rant.
“Don’t.” His voice was cold and hard, stubbornly unyielding in the simpering face of this shattered man who, wonder of wonders, actually conceded. He pulled his hands away and left them floating in the air between them, fluttering anxiously. Harry closed one eye and squinted with the other, taking in a face he once knew. “Sirius?”
Silence fell and Tony shifted where he stood, fiddling with the series of gold snaps on the front of his Auror robe. Ron bit his tongue to keep himself from saying what Harry really looked like that day on the Hogwarts Express: wide-eyed and gasping, throwing open doors like a madman. They were right to respond with caution; Ron's only fault with his team was that two of the three were so easily disarmed.
"Here..." he breathes, still clutching the sink. The tap is still running and there's steam rising out of it like a cauldron. "Here. I'm in here!" His own voice sounds fragile and broken. It's like in his dreams, when he's crying out for help but only air comes out. Which means this isn't real, and that's fine. He doesn't want reality anymore. He wants the voice to lead him into madness, never to return.
An austere young man, wearing a sharp vest made of green silk and a gold name-tag that reads Draco M., snorts inelegantly and looks to the ceiling as if calling for divine intervention.
Draco bit his lip and gripped the counter, his knuckles turning white. He breathed deeply and told himself it could be worse. Prism was nothing if not powerful, so it was lucky that Greg was getting help sooner rather than later. It was the sort of potion that could have changed everything, could have been worshipped by the healing world, if it weren't for the downfalls.
"Are you ready, Haz?" he whispered, suddenly very close, his hot breath tickling Harry's ear. Harry lost his words and nodded. With a whispered finite, the spell lifted. Harry blinked and squinted against the brightness of the clear sky shining against the snowy field. A tall, familiar structure stood before them, and he gasped.
Alec jumped and spun around, climbing onto his knees atop the tall padded stool as Arthur opened his wardrobe. Arthur felt his brother eye him warily as he rifled through a drawer, opened a can of wet cat-food, and began poking around in the hanging clothes.
to keep his mobile in his pocket. He had a strange habit of shorting out his electronic devices. After three family laptops, Dad was no longer allowed near a computer. The tube-telly in their sitting room seemed to be immune as long as they didn't try to upgrade to a flatscreen (and as long as Manchester didn't lose). After sixteen mobile phones, this was the only the latest. And, miracle of miracles, it was currently still working. Possibly because Dad never kept it with him and likely texted on it using a ten-foot pole.
"Potty, stop. I mean it. You're drunk. Stop...stop moving around over there. All swirly and...and yappy. Flappy. Like a drunk squid, is what you are."
"So, the asp farm was found wanting because…? And don't say loo," he added just as Harry opened his mouth. "Our carpentry wizards could easily fix something like that."
"Green light, lotta green light, dragons, a bad fire, flying on brooms, the white owl and orange cat, you, Hermione, an old man wae long white hair an' a beard, some tetchy blond git, an actual
"Room enough," he answered. He felt a smirk pulling at his lips but didn't feel it in his heart. "The sofa transfigures into a decent enough bed. Could probably split it in two."
“Stay here. Wand at the ready.” He nodded but didn’t pull his wand until she sent a stinging hex his way. He ducked, knicking his finger on the grater, and swore silently even as he whipped out his wand.
A year ago, Draco could have counted Charming as a good friend. As usual, Potter had came storming through to ruin things. Protests and op-eds and shit comments on Draco's shit hair that was only shitty in the first place because of Potter's idiocy.
"Because it fucks your magic?" Potter's trying miserably to clean his glasses on his sweaty shirt, but it's only making a smeary mess. His hands are already bruising from his assault on the door.
"Mr. Blaise is nice. Ms. Pansy is a bit loud for my tastes." It was another thing he'd heard Grandmum say, but she was married to Grandfather, who shouted all the time, so maybe she just didn't like Ms. Pansy.
Another scrape of furniture, then another. There are more voices, indistinct and still muffled. The other voices he's imagined over the past eternity are never muffled.
Harry Potter. And Harry Potter would never truly want to befriend Draco Malfoy (nor would Draco wish to have anything to do with Potter, thank you very much). The flow of resurfacing memories hadn't exactly slowed; Potter was creeping back into Charming's fractured mind a bit more each day. Draco bemoaned Charming's reintroduction to the wizarding world and his own role in bringing Potter back to life. No good would come of letting this carry on. Potter was too powerful, too annoying not to cock it up from beyond the grave.
Ron resisted the bureaucratic urge to confirm the guard's identity with Harry, already knowing who it was that had failed to protect his friend all those years ago. Bertram Norwood had shown promise in the final stages of the Auror training program but resigned in disgrace after Robards tore into him.
"Why?" This didn't sound right - unless James had lost his temper. Yes, and then he was too proud to fix it, leaving it to his boys to call in the troops. Well. Hermione would just have to fix things for the idiot, as per usual.
And Kim, during their session Thursday, wasn't much better with her goofy leering and winking, which made Harry want to die, which made Kim want to talk seriously about...well, things he couldn't catch himself thinking about.
he would say - but he let them do what they wanted with their room. And they both wanted a bit of a mess...it distracted from the stolen mobile and stowaway cat.
Harry knelt, swallowing hard and blinking harder. "It looks like an old friend of mine, you know. Her name was Hedwig."
,” Draco sighs, waving a dismissive hand. The air is thick. It’s difficult to draw a full breath. They’ll have to sleep here tonight. He'll use a marshmallow as a pillow. “Wands’re okay. They’re just a tool.”
"Spare. Me." Ron shook his head, staring at her as if she'd sprouted a third eye that was particularly unattractive. "Merlin, woman.
leaving one for Blaise. He had to get back to work. Mr. and Mrs. Longbottom would be receiving a visit from their son later and Draco wanted them in proper clothes again. He detested those hideous bed-slippers.
Alec's screams were still echoing in his mind and the waves were playing on loop. It was much too dark to push the image of the makeshift grave out of his head. He needed some light. Needed something to do. James scrubbed both hands over his cheeks, wiping away the wet tracks. He turned from the shop and headed into the kitchen, switching on the radio as he went.
Alec snapped the phone back together and took off his Goggles triumphantly. "The extra coils I put in last time burned through but it's holding up so far," he grinned.
James forced a smile as he greeted the others. Remus's face broke into a wide, happy grin that James couldn't help returning. The man looked decades younger like that. George clapped him on the shoulder and slipped him a small bag of suspect candy. Hermione had brought their five-year-old daughter, Rose, who immediately started lecturing Scorpius on the best colors of sprinkles. James dropped heavily into a seat between Malfoy and Monty, taking in the incredible view.
Harry loves all of it, he tells him, “just not...that bit, so much.” Well, fine then. Draco can take care of himself, but what does Harry need from him if not his legendary efforts?
He stared at it dumbly. Four pages, signed D. Malfoy. Each paragraph was a rousing review of the chocolates he'd sent on Monday. From presentation to taste to Shipping & Handling, Malfoy had an opinion on everything.
He was drawn to Draco, time and time again, for better or for worse, because that was how it had always been. They energized each other in a way he'd never felt with Monty, or Aarti, or Ginny.
"Or," Nott said loudly, "we kill you, Potter, and wipe his memory instead. Even if Draco works past it, I doubt whatever remains of this memory would hold up in court. Without your testimony, nothing else can happen. No more arrests."
shop. He should be grateful to have someone to share his shop with. To share his life with. Malfoy had told him once that Harry Potter was an arrogant git with his head firmly planted up his own arse. James was determined to not let that Potter pride ruin things.
Charming considered his hands, which were still gripping his cane but no longer picking at the paint or tapping it against the floor. Gibbs was watching him expectantly and Granger was sending Draco some sort of meaningful look. Ugh, it was
It was a fraction of a dose, but it calmed the shaking in his limbs and that was enough. She returned the bag of candy to her plain black robes - which seemed to be passing in the dark light of the evening as a modest Muggle dress - just as they reached their destination.
The kitchen door swung open and James whirled around, trying to arrange his face into something less guilty-of-pornographic-confections.
"Jewelry sales have skyrocketed, alongside Beauty," Arthur's saying now, "and everyone is always well stocked.
Apparently growing tired of the dramatics, Draco showed up at Blupin Frottage (uninvited) and escorted (kidnapped) him to their next real estate venture. (Sirius was all Smirky McSmirkface and Harry began to wonder how much of a fight his traitorous godfather put up against this home invasion.) Instead of their usual round of soon-to-be-rejected properties, however, Draco enlisted the
"Either Monty's secretly been a wizard this whole time, or someone's used Polyjuice," he sighed, his shoulders inching up close to his ears in an obvious sign of tension. "Got through the wards on the street, anyhow, so I reckon it
“Did you hear what I said, Potter?” Draco finally asks, leaning down slightly to try to catch his gaze.
“Yes, that’s what mandatory means,” Hermione G. grumbles. Nobody seems to take notice, but behind her, Pansy P. smirks devilishly.
When there were no more barbs to trade, Weasley used the Floo to return to the Ministry. Draco put Scorpius back to bed, but he couldn't calm himself. He was trembling, as he was prone to do when he heard his father mumbling to an invisible Dark Lord at the dinner table. His limbs were thrumming with nervous energy, his heart was pounding. As he choked down a Calming Draught, he wondered what was going through James's mind now. Was he afraid? Angry? He could easily imagine Potter in a situation like that, he could see him coming out of it heroically - unscarred and unbothered. An average Saturday night for lunatic Gryffindors. But James was unarmed and half-crippled and distracted by his kids. Betrayed by his love.
"Put some sprinkles on fer me," Arty said, falsely bright, ducking in for a fierce hug. Something horrible pulled in James's chest when he realized he was about to go out for ice cream without his boys for the first time in his life.
Worse than the professionalism was the frigid shoulder James was getting. Malfoy wouldn't look at him, only at the smokey letters. In their torturous hour together, all they talked about was his sleeping schedule, his eating habits, and the protest.
. Monty knew too well what it was like to lose family; he couldn't live with himself if he let James turn his own away. And the boys deserved a family too.
“Priceless, like I said,” Mr. Flamel continues. “World-famous gemstones. I tell you, if word gets out that you have them here, not a villain in this world will pass up the opportunity to get to them.”
"That's rude." Ben frowns at him and the wrinkle between his brows deepens like a canyon in the desert, which Harry will never have the chance to see. "You've been quite recalcitrant lately, son... What's bothering you?"
Dad said, limping over to snatch the parchment out of his hand. He turned away to smash the letters into a haphazard pile, shoving them away from prying eyes.
Rachel arrived in the doorway at the same time that Anne appeared at the window with a bundle of letters. Rachel - chest heaving, hair wild, and a nasty stain spreading across her perfect robes - flicked her wand to let the owl inside.
James cocked his head and squinted. He was every bit his photo in the Prophet last summer - the one in which he looked like a confused pigeon.
"I-I-I - " Remus stammered, at a loss, still staring at Harry who was looking back at him coolly. The Thing - the robot, Monty called it - was vibrating violently now. Its arms were spinning in their sockets and it was looking less and less human by the second.
They fell into their usual conversation, like they always did when Draco came over. Except it felt a little more special, a little more like a proper date, because Draco was a little more dressed up today. He wore sharp black trousers and a thin black belt, paired with a sleek blue shirt that made his hair practically sing. Overall, he looked more...pointy, than usual. But a good pointy. Like when James managed to suck a candy cane down to the finest point -
Apparently not. Potter says nothing as he draws the wire out and bends it in half. He bends one end into a little crook, tamping it down with his teeth before shoving the device back into the little shaft. Draco watches his back as he works. Even through his shirt, Draco can see the angry, raw wounds bubbling up on his once immaculate skin.
Handing over the letter meant the link could be made by anyone, even a Hufflepuff. Charming trusted Draco to keep their twice-weekly one-on-one arrangement confidential (there had to be a better way of phrasing that), and Draco just
The witch says nothing, but she’s staring at them with an eagerness that's unsettling. Potter’s ready to storm over and blast the door off its hinges and Draco reaches out to steady him, catching his forearm before he can insult their host and land them outside all night in the dead of winter.
, James replied. He placed the wooden spoon carefully on the spoon-rest that was shaped like a cartoon owl. James had picked it up at an odds-and-ends store years ago, no doubt hearing Harry the Wizard in his head prattling on about owls.
"Draco, be sure to clean those thoroughly," Severus demands as he stalks away. "I don't want customers complaining about sticky rings."
What with the bumbling social invitation, the inadvertently calling Girl Weasel a harpy, and finally the audacious gift of an original Charming Chocolates Variety Box, Draco was quite thoroughly distracted. And so he saw the signs, but paid them no mind.
"I love it," he insisted, grinning widely and dropping his little hands with a final squeeze. "I'd no idea you were such an artist, Scorpius. I may have to hire you one day to make my brooms just as beautiful!"
phase," Draco cooed, his fingers hovering over the shining truffles and squares within. "My opinion has been sought out specifically."
Ten hours later, James saw the last pair of gabbing customers out with a friendly smile, waving apologetically at the pair of older women lingering on the sidewalk hopefully. He pointed at the sign - it was clear, after all. 7:00 sharp. His peculiar but always accurate watch - featuring planetary orbits, the phases of the moon, and one too many hands - read 7:01 when he flipped the sign over to Closed and locked the door.
James folded his pillow over his ears, feeling the hot anger in his chest begin to grow. He couldn't fight about this with Monty anymore - the man would have to come to his senses at some point. Malfoy wasn't even his Healer anymore, he was just a friend! Why couldn't he have friends?!
know I don't subscribe to that nonsense anymore, right? I haven't for a long time... My mum helped set me right, and Astoria was a dream, she opened a whole new world for me, and I have a son now, so I - I intend to do better by him. Half my clients are Muggles, for fuck's sake!"
"You've another one," said Mum as she unburdened a familiar red owl. Draco grinned at the sight of Anne.
The Eighth Years share a common room on the fourth floor. Potter and the Weasel have the dorm across from Draco and Blaise. Not everyone is quite so lucky with their pairings; Pansy is putting on a good show of stoicism, but Draco can see she is positively terrified of Granger (for good reason).
James didn't quite believe him. He thought it might be worse the next time it came up but he was exhausted and couldn't deal with anything more than a simple yes or no right now. This would have to do. He nodded and turned to go back to bed when Monty touched his arm.
He could hear Monty moving around upstairs as he gingerly transferred each truffle into a large, flat, specially-insulated gift box. He had to force himself to stop fiddling with the particular arrangement of each piece - after a sleepless night and with his hip now boiling in pain, his hands weren't so steady anymore and he was just going to ruin things.
"Just weeks ago, you see, a certain friend of mine voluntarily went to a Quidditch match with a certain Man Who Conquered," Blaise carried on. His expression shifted into something more considering, calculating. "Have you finally gotten your handshake, Mr. Malfoy?"
James nodded slowly but didn't respond. Monty tried not to take it personally… James was always hurtling into things at breakneck speed, and it was a testament to how out of it he was feeling that he wasn't already plunging into this idea.
"A cannae trust Malfoy no' tae mess wae yer head!" Monty screeched, tapping James on the forehead. James reared back from his touch, thinking he might bite the stupid sod if he tried that again. "A though' a trusted ye, James, a really though' a could! But this is - what the hell am a supposed tae think? Ye wouldn' make somethin' like this fer Ron or Hermione! No' even me!"
She and Ron had not gone to bed after all. They spent all night discussing what to do. Should they barge into Charming Chocolates and whisk this James fellow off to St. Mungo's? Should they try to strong-arm him into letting his children attend Hogwarts? Should they sit him down with a pensieve and flood him with their shared memories until something clicked and James became their Harry again?
for a glimpse of Harry. The world had given up; the Aurors and Minister Shacklebolt had given up; Remus, Minerva, Mum, Dad, even Hermione had given up. But Ron had given up on Harry before, in the Forest of Dean, and he couldn't do it again.
"Right." Ron didn't look entirely satisfied, but he continued. "And anyway, Hermione, he shouldn't need Monty, I don't think that's right."
The large window behind the desk was charmed to show a sunny field of white peacocks, because Draco Malfoy was apparently still every bit the posh wanker. Pretty glowing orbs of light floated over their heads, and the arched ceiling was surely a product of magic, seeing as the outside of the building was far too stout to allow it. The dark hardwood floor matched the dark beams of the arches, but the cream-colored walls, rug, and ceiling kept the room feeling bright, clean, and open.
Hermione clambers to her feet, fixing her blue tunic with a huff. A plastic finger is stuck in her bushy hair, but she doesn't notice as she stoops to retrieve the fallen book.
- " James brought his other hand up to more thoroughly hide his face. " - an' they eventually piece it all together and let Monty inside tae identify the raspberry jam what started a murder investigation. By the time they let Da' go from the station, he jus' goes back to work to finish his
Monty was forced to wait until midnight, when he was sure the boys were finally asleep, before he could lie down and doze. James had invited him back to their bedroom again after their latest Saturday night chocolate binge, as if Monty had forgotten about all those other invitations. But he was no turkey. If he gave in now, if he surrendered this battle, he'd lose the war. Better to let James miss him a bit.
Visibly trembling, Draco raises his head once more into view, peering with comically huge eyes at the group near the door. They’re facing away from him, but Bellatrix sees him. She takes a long drag of her cigarette, furrowing her brow, but says nothing.
But then again, Charming had claimed last month (and seven times since) that it was an open invitation. Saturday night was boozy chocos night, open invitation, that's what he said, Draco still had the letter in his desk. He could put up with the superfluous Gryffindor garbage for company if it meant he could drag Blaise along and force the funk out of him with chocolates and booze. Depression, not funk. Merlin, he was starting to think like Charming.
“Is there a discrepancy in what they collected?” Minerva asks impatiently. “My understanding is that they wouldn’t take anything that wasn’t marked
"No, Ben! No, I said NO! I'm not tired!" Harry manages to turn over on his stomach and tries to crawl out of the bed onto the floor again, but Ben just flips him on his back, catches both his wrists, and wrestles the blanket over him once more. "OFF! FU-- FUMP OFF!" Harry screams, trying the move again.
Now was the moment of truth. Now he would stop pretending these could possibly be two separate people. James Charming was Harry Potter, there was no denying it.
"I need to drink," he said, but that wasn't quite right if Draco's sudden alarm was anything to go by. "
"Thank you ever so much for having us over," Astoria gushed, beaming. She took a biscuit (also imaginary) from the proffered plate and took a small (imaginary) bite, humming her delight.
Arthur insisted for the third time. Alec knew his brother. Knew those tears in his eyes were an inch away from turning into some very impressive yelling. Alec picked at his last waffle, watching Dad fumble over his words. He was hiding something. They were only getting the barest details.
"You...you know it's hippogriff shit, right?" she said as she watched him swoop Hugo back and forth, back and forth. Hugo hummed, nearly out of his tantrum now. "Your family values aren't
look. One of his boys was deathly afraid of cats, he knew that much, he had just temporarily mixed up which one it was. "Well, he says this one's alright," Arty amended.
His shirt has ridden up slightly and he has to peel his bare lower back and thighs off the brick before he can crawl to their island of safety. His palms are burned, much like Potter's feet, and he suspects there's a distinct brick-pattern seared into his skin if Potter's wide, staring eyes are any indication.
"Have you had a physical examination yet?" Draco asked blandly. Charming shook his head and furrowed his brow in a question. "I'd like that to happen today. If you're amenable, we might be able to do something for your hip and your voice."
"Am sorry..." Monty said. It sounded as if he was pressing his face right up against the wood of the door. "A saw the shop, it looks… Jaybird, it looks incredible. Am sorry, a jus' - a jus' worry about ye. Dinnae wan' ye tae be taken advantage of. Doctors aren' s'posed tae get close tae their patients like that fer a reason, ye know, it's no' right."
This stuns Pansy to silence, but she rallies. Staring hard at the other woman, she uses her finger to push the notebook across the tall counter until it bumps against Hermione’s chest.
"Don'it 'sposed to get colder at night?" he wondered. Draco had an arm around his shoulders, slumping against him and making him go all tingly, and Harry had his arm around Draco's waist, which felt perfectly wrong. He couldn't say who was holding up whom, just that it was very warm and easy to laugh and easy to make
"Sorry!" he spluttered. "Sorry, I apologize, I'm not - I'm not making a very good impression, am I?" he laughed, sounding manic. Monty quirked a brow. "I only - your boys here, they remind me so much of someone I once knew, years ago," he confessed. "Spitting image, really, only without the glasses."
"You wouldn't dare," she said. "He's seeing what isn't there, that's not your fault. I'm only saying that fighting fire with fire won't put anything out. You were hurt and you responded with anger - "
Potter spots something off to the side and diverts their journey yet again, like an easily distracted niffler. He navigates an intricate root system and Draco follows, his hand catching on—on—sticky silk? Stumbling over the last of the gnarled roots, he straightens his robes and finds himself standing at Potter's side on the edge of an acromantula nest.
"Shh!" Alec darted a glance at the door. Dad was doing the numbers at the counter. They could hear Beatrice ramble on as she cleaned up. "What'd Mr. Malfoy do?"
"As we discussed, this is an old asper farm," Malfoy explained slowly. Harry's mouth formed a little "oh" shape. He had
"She died givin' birth," he explained evenly. He didn't need to sugarcoat it, not even around James, really. But he hadn't lied when he said that the experience traumatized James, who had remained single and celibate for several years. "Only knew each other fer a year, but she got 'im started in 'is new life. Was hard fer 'im tae move on, try again."
"I'm feeling much too philosophical for my liking, Potter," he grumbles. "Like a bloody frostbitten Ravenclaw." Potter snorts and sits up, leaning one of his broad, bony shoulders against Draco. Draco feels sinfully warm.
and Arthur shot straight up out of his seat, whirling around. Dad smirked knowingly as the Spice Girls started up:
"Jus' wait til I tell Monty!" he said, brandishing the letter. "Yer mad at him cos he dinnae like Mr. Malfoy an' here you are, pushin' him off anyway! What's it all been for then?!"
“This one!” he cried without indicating right or left. Harry took a guess and placed his hand gently on the right leg, earning a fresh wave of wails. He snatched his hand back and looked around for help, but no one was near.
This year, he'd opted to wait for his actual birthday. They'd go to a Quidditch game on the 31st, the semi-final match before the World Cup. Today, he was coloring with Arthur in the kitchen while Alec showed Draco some of his inventions upstairs.
Monty's heart soared at the apt description. James Charming was one stubborn, independent git. It was eerie how similar he was to this Harry Potter... Monty was right to have looked for James's mysterious past life on the Internet last year, even if James wouldn't admit it. One had to know where they came from, even if they couldn't go back!
"And then we're thrust back into the world with others and it doesn't know how to cope, I think, with actual sensory input. It's blingin' stressful."
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry!" he pleaded, a crack in his voice making him feel so much younger than he remembered being just moments ago. "I'm so, so sorry, please!"
This - whatever he and Charming had - was something else entirely. Because Charming was entirely different from Potter, Gryffindor-inspired protest be damned. Charming was a grown man, not a wiry boy in a red and gold tie with a stick up his arse about justice, good and evil, right and wrong. But then Draco's eye caught the photo on the front page again and that wasn't entirely accurate….
Charming started signing something slowly and Draco was interested to see his mouth following along with the signs, a silent pronunciation meant only for himself. Gibbs sounded it out as Charming spelled: "Exp...ell...iarmus,
, and he let the bartender know it. He couldn't even feel the burn like Sirius's whiskey. He tried to watch her pour more drinks but got distracted by something, and then he was trying very hard to not spill on his way past the raucous billiards table.
"Slow down, crutch, a cannae keep up..." he muttered, attacking a plate with the scrub-brush. James rolled his eyes.
He paused, waiting for the inevitable joke. A smirk touched Malfoy’s lips and there was a mischievous, knowing glint in his eye, nothing more. Everyone had the same vision at this part of the story: a yoga instructor helped him through physical therapy so effectively that he got her up the duff within a month. Nevermind that she did all the work during their extra curricular activities.
“Nipples,” Draco blurts. His cheeks are burning but he's unable to look away. Potter fails to choke back a laugh and it turns into a long, inelegant snort, and then they’re both giggling madly. Draco shucks his own jumper and goes a step further—he slings his dress shirt onto the bed.

It was a rather large supply, hidden away in his desk. Perhaps he had better gift it to her in small portions, over time. To help keep her figure in check. Right. Not much of a thank you if it went straight to her thighs. He would hold onto the rest in the meantime.
That night, James dreamt he was underwater. Arty was tied to a pillar at the bottom of the lake. The merfolk were guarding him, keeping James away with sharp spears while Arty - eyes wide and pleading, mouth open in a garbled scream for help - ran out of air. The water was freezing, the current was pulling him back from his boy, Alec was shrieking at his side, crying out for his brother, and James was too slow, too weak, too stupid to reach him.
