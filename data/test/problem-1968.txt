“It’s just, I kind of assumed but I never actually
He had found this clearing, overlooking the lake, with Cedric in his third year. Draco had received a few letters from his father that concerned him, and Cedric had shown him this place, so they could talk about it without fear of interruption.
“I’m in the kitchen with you Teddy, I can see the owl,” Harry replied, raising an eyebrow.
Pansy sighed, “he won’t, and you know it. At most he’ll tell you to leave and we’ll have to find a different option.”
“Hello to you too Malfoy,” Harry grinned. “I told you yesterday you’d see me again.”
“Who might have just given us valuable information,” Sirius added. “Is it possible this was him reaching out? That he might want to change for the better, but he isn’t in a position where he can?” Sirius said, and Harry opened his mouth to deny what Sirius said, but it made sense.
Harry smiled, seeming to be lost in thought again.
“He what?” Harry asked in a low tone, knowing exactly what Draco had said.
Harry glanced at Ron. “Dinner’s only just gone in, it’ll be at least an hour and a half so as long as they don’t pick FrizzlingStacks you should be fine,” Ron shrugged.
“What are staring at?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow when he noticed Harry watching him.
And then, the dragon stretched his wings and took to the air, flying in circles around the room. Sitting in silence, Scorpius watched the dragon glide across the room, his head moving to follow the direction of the dragon.
Tilting his head, Draco wondered what that had to do with anything. However, he didn’t have to wonder for very long, as there was a light knock at the backdoor.
“Are you sure? You look slightly – ashen,” Draco asked again, placing his hand on Harry’s arm. The contact should have made Harry flinch, but he found himself relaxing into the touch.
Muttering a string of angry curse words, Ron began cleaning his cauldron as Hermione shot Harry a sympathetic look. Harry knew he had nothing to worry about when it came to Hermione’s potion skills, so at least he wasn’t going to be poisoned.
“Thank you for entertaining Scorpius, Potter,” Malfoy said quietly, watching as Scorpius was engaged in conversation with an old woman’s German Shepherd. “You didn’t have to say yes.”
,” he said, stumbling over his words, but meaning each one.
“Are you suggesting Harry should keep seeing Draco simply because he makes good tea?” Hermione asked, raising an eyebrow.
“Your Auntie is a good friend of mine,” Harry said, leaning back on his chair. “My Godchild is her grandson,” he explained, and Scorpius scrunched his eyebrows together.
“I like the colour green, so maybe Slytherin would be cool, but I don’t think I have much ambition,” the boy said, scrunching up his nose.
“Then I guess I’ll have to catch you,” Draco replied, and Harry grinned. “
“I- I’m not sure,” Draco replied. “Intelligence is nice but, being courageous is also good, and of course I’m ambitious, but I don’t think it’s more important than the other traits and values of the houses,” he said. “But my family expects me to be in Slytherin,” he shrugged, shuffling on his feet to the displeasure of Madam Malkin.
“I – git,” Harry muttered, trying not to smile. He moved to stand opposite Malfoy and leaned against the wall. “Thank you.”
to talk to you,” Draco drawled.
“Remus kept on going back to the clock when the other returned and pushing the forwards by a few hours,” Harry explained, grinning at Teddy’s starstruck expression.
Draco smiled. “There’s four houses. Firstly, there’s Ravenclaw, their house colours are blue, and bronze and they’re known for valuing intelligence, wisdom and a thirst for knowledge,” he listed – he’d read about it many times in his family’s library. The boy nodded as Draco spoke, his eyes staring intently at Draco, wanting him to continue. “Then there’s Gryffindor, who’s house colours are red and gold. They value bravery, loyalty, daring and chivalry.”
“Obviously you’re in desperate need of an expert to teach you the correct way to drink tea,” Malfoy drawled.
“I don’t think I can,” Harry replied, grinning as Draco rolled his eyes. “How do you celebrate Samhain?”
Cedric smiled at Draco, the light of the fire making it seem wider than it was. “So why won’t you let them do the same for you?” he asked.
Both filled with anger, and grief, and pain, but a strange understanding laid between the two.
Sirius shook his head, his jaw clenched. “
Draco bit back a laugh. “I wouldn’t be so sure Blaise,” he said, and Pansy nodded, thinking Draco was sticking up for her. “She knows that the little ones are called prawns, and then there’s the castles and the ones that go diagonally-“
The daunting realisation of his kiss with Malfoy must have shown on his face because Malfoy sighed. “I said you wouldn’t like it,” he smiled softly at Harry, his eyes expressing what his face refused to – sorrow. Harry had never been more confused in his life, even more than when he was eleven and he was told he was a wizard, but Malfoy
“An example of what though?” Draco asked.
recently,” he sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose. “What did you ask me Cub?”
Potter grinned, “Well, your wand is made of hawthorn wood, which is very contradicting.”
Harry sighed. “That’s what I said,” he grinned. “They just told me it was going to get worse,” he said, smiling as Draco suppressed another laugh. “How long have they been together?” he asked, and Draco thought for a moment.
“Yes,” she said with a sigh of relief. “Do you want to know what a television is?” she asked, her eyes sparkling.
Blaise telling him it seemed like a reasonable response.
He shrugged. “It’s definitely nowhere near the same as it was ten years ago, but it’s still difficult to walk down Diagon Alley sometimes,” Harry said, rubbing the back of his neck. “I usually end up hiding in the back of Florean’s ice cream shop, so it’s not all bad,” Harry chuckled.
He cried until his eyes felt as if they’d been rubbed with sand.
“I’m sorry I kissed you,” Malfoy blurted, looking horrified with himself before he composed himself again. “It was inappropriate and I instigated it without any consent from you so –“
Harry furrowed his eyebrows. “He wasn’t like this before?”
“And then finally, how to create your own tea,” Draco said with a sigh of relief.
Potter blushed. “Ah yeah, well, I hear things. You know with ‘Mione being the minister and all.” He spoke rapidly, rubbing the back of his neck and Draco smirked.
a plan of Voldemort’s that he heard, then he risked a lot to tell you anything,” Sirius pointed out.
So, he ignored it still.
“Git,” Draco sniffed indignantly, although he was grinning from ear to ear.
“The wonders of customer service,” Harry grinned, finishing another cup of tea.
This didn’t appease Ron. “It’s just, clearly something is eating you up inside and,” he took a deep breath, shifting his sitting position. “You’re my best mate, I’m worried.”
“I was paying attention!” Ron insisted, making Harry raise an eyebrow at his friend. Harry remembered that lesson, and he knew neither of them were listening to Professor Flitwick, but rather they were talking about plans for the DA. “I was! But ‘Mione, not everyone masters a spell that quickly, you’re just bloody smart.”
Harry smiled.
“But you don’t?” Draco supplied.
“You won’t like that answer,” he replied. He was incredibly still, like a statue or a Muggle portrait, displaying a calmness that his eyes betrayed him on as they darted from item to item, anywhere except Harry, who was staring holes into Malfoy as he stood before him.
Scorpius nodded violently and Teddy began to relay the time Harry took him to Romania to visit Charlie with Ron and Hermione as they began to walk to the Market.
Harry had not had a peaceful day. His supervisor had nagged at him for being one of the best on the force but refusing to use his skills. His supervisor wasn’t wrong, but he was comfortable with his routine, and he didn’t want that to change. She hadn’t taken kindly to that.
“Did you manage to avoid Hagrid’s rock cakes for the rest of the term?” Harry joked, causing Teddy to laugh as they reached the supermarket. It was rather quiet as the shops were always quieter during working hours. There was a woman cradling a crying baby and Harry shot her a sympathetic glance as she looked at him as if to say ‘
“In other words, you’re a Hufflepuff at heart?” Harry asked, sipping his tea and staring at Malfoy over the edge of the cup.
“I climbed a tree last year, so you’d notice me,” Draco admitted, his face going pink as Harry broke into a grin.
good, but your house seems to go for muscle over
aren’t we depressing,” he joked. “I’ve been awake five minutes and I’m crying,” he chuckled, wiping his eyes with his sleeves.
Draco shook his head, “the only free time I have tomorrow is during lunch.”
. “So, what’s the plan for today?”
. In fact, he insisted it was a stupid idea and I should forget he ever kissed me,” Harry said, smiling at the memory.
It wasn’t until he heard a creak from the door hinges that he realised he never locked it.
“Valentines day… do we have any plans Padfoot?” Remus asked, watching Sirius grin.
“Whose dog is that?” Draco asked, his curiosity swelling.
Harry furrowed his eyes. “The fourteenth, why?”
was the one to tell Sirius, not the Prophet.
“Idiots,” Pansy mumbled. “I’m friends with idiots.”
Harry laughed. “You know, I’m not actually supposed to be out of the hospital wing,” he admitted sheepishly.
Ron fumbled for his own bag. “I’ll come with you,” he said.
“Harry –“ Draco said, at the same time.
Once they reached the door to the Potions classroom, Harry noticed that everyone was huddled together to keep warm and he bit back a smile when Hermione muttered about how everyone learnt the same spell. However, Harry saw that Malfoy was standing apart from everyone else, looking unfazed by the temperature of the corridor, most likely because he too used the spell to keep warm. Harry scowled at how unbothered Malfoy looked. He didn’t know why, but seeing Malfoy leaning against the wall with a grace only ever presented
,” Draco teased, his cheeks a pink hue.
“If it’s just me, he’s less likely to get caught, isn’t he?”
“You know” Harry laughed, running his fingers through his hair, the laughter becoming more and more strained. “I think I needed to do that too,” he said.
“I’m not telling,” the boy grinned. “I want to see if I’m right.”
“Exactly,” he grinned. “No one goes there, I only knew it existed because Sirius asked me to help him move some things.” Draco noticed (much to his dismay) that his hot chocolate was now gone. He had finished it. “It’s as if the house has secrets, as if it knows something it doesn’t want others to just stumble upon.”
being your friend.”
to a date with me,” he grinned widely, poking Draco’s cheek.
,” he said. “But I don’t think I can,” he admitted, leaning his head on Draco’s shoulder. Draco was confused as to what he meant but didn’t want to push.
“But I do,” Draco said, staring at his hands.
Harry felt his heart rise to his throat. “I –“ he began, swallowing down his fear and his anxieties on the idea. “I’m thinking of quitting my job,” he said quietly, bringing the teacup up to his mouth, as if he would be able to hide behind it.
Draco laced his fingers with Harry’s, silently telling Harry that he was there, and he would listen. Harry didn’t notice that he had moved closer to Draco, until their knees were gently touching.
Andromeda only stayed for an hour.
He had anxiously awaited Teddy’s first letter, curious to know if it was all he had hoped it to be. Harry practically tore the envelope to shreds when it arrived and quickly scanned the letter, chuckling to himself when he found out Teddy was a Hufflepuff. He wasn’t surprised.
“I can feel you staring,” he said, his eyes flickering in the direction of Harry, who was currently leaning against the shelf.
“I’ll protect you.”
“Around about yeah,” Harry grinned, taking another bite of the cinnamon bun.
Hogwarts.
“Only if you make sure to not run into anyone,” Harry chuckled, remembering the first time he had let Teddy push a trolly whilst they were shopping for Andromeda. The woman with her baby seemed to have enough problems without Teddy accidentally ramming a shopping cart into her.
Malfoy was avoiding him.
,” he scowled.
“You shouldn’t have to deal with any of this, you’re just a teenager,” Sirius said with a sigh.
“So, we need a distraction?” Hermione added, looking lost in thought as she tried to figure out what would be a decent distraction.
,” Draco finished, resting his head against the wall. “Well then, you’ll be glad to hear that the Slytherin team is doing abysmally,” he sighed.
going back there,” Remus said, without a shadow of a doubt. Sirius nodded in agreement.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Merlin’s mother, you,” he muttered, rubbing temples. “You’re so incredibly dense,” he accused, refusing to look at Harry. “You’re lucky you’re cute,” he mumbled, loud enough for Harry to hear.
Draco rolled his eyes. “I just didn’t think it was important,” he shrugged, forcing Blaise to look away from Harry. “Besides, I only found out on the train.”
Malfoy looked as elegant as ever as he wore a pale grey trench coat and a black turtleneck. Although, the collar of his turtleneck was partially hidden beneath a greyish-green scarf, that danced in the breeze. His hair was styled back but it looked wind-swept. Of course, there was always a possibility that it was wind-swept but Malfoy somehow managed to make it look intentional. He looked incredibly autumnal, and Harry had to admit, Malfoy looked as if he were from a work of fiction.
“Don’t, please,” Harry said, not wanting anymore pity. “He knows it’s a bad idea but, he won’t listen to reason, neither will Remus.”
“Two?” she asked, as if she had misheard. “Harry, you have been coming to my stall for the past five years, and you have never once asked for two,” she said, raising an eyebrow.
Scorpius shook his head. “No, not really,” he said, absentmindedly, bouncing Ladon across the table. “Oh!” he exclaimed, dropping Ladon on the table. “We visited Auntie An-drom-e-da,” he said slowly, to make sure he pronounced it correctly. “She’s nice, she gives me biscuits,” he nodded, as if that was all that was needed to determine someone’s intentions.
Another thing that he had discovered was that he really had learnt a lot about tea from Draco. He was no expert, that was a title still earned only by Draco himself, but he knew more than the average person. It might have been because he couldn’t help but remember every conversation he had ever had with Draco, but he liked to think it was because he had an excellent memory – despite forgetting where he placed his wand on a number of occasions.
“You’re uncultured when it comes to tea, I’m guessing that’s the same for books?” Draco asked, his face a rosy shade of pink.
Scorpius beamed. “I didn’t spill anything,” he said, tilting his chin up in pride. “Not on the table, anyway,” he admitted, gesturing to his shirt which was not only covered in flour, but somehow cake batter.
“I’ll be there in a moment,” he heard a voice float from somewhere in the shop. “Please have a seat,” the voice said again. Draco recognised it to be Potter’s voice and he wondered if he would have been so polite had he known it was Draco who just walked into the store.
“How did you find us?” Draco asked, pulling his eyes from Harry to see Ron sit on the sofa opposite, whilst Hermione glanced longingly at the books before joining him.
” he said, gesturing to the cards. “Is a tactical retreat,” he grinned, as Harry burst into laughter, only making Sirius look at them both, bewildered.
“He sent me a letter a few weeks ago, asking if I wanted to meet his son,” she explained. “I think I’d have said yes no matter the reason. I don’t like what the war did to our family,” she sighed. “We’ve met a few times after that, but it wasn’t until today that I learnt you had been meeting with them too,” she said, a knowing glint in her eye as Harry fiddled with his teacup.
“It must have been the potion,” Hermione deducted, and Harry nodded in agreement whilst Ron still looked sceptical. “It lets you do what you normally would talk yourself out of.”
“You tell yourself that,” she said, turning to another customer after she passed him his tea, leaving Draco to his thoughts.
The ritual for Samhain left Harry feeling more at peace than he imagined it would. After lighting his candle, it was as though all his anguish and the pain of loss had lessened slightly. It was always there, and after so much loss in his life, Harry doubted it would ever truly go away, but he hadn’t felt so light for years.
“Because you look dreadful,” Malfoy said simply, rolling up his sleeves.
Malfoy froze for a moment. “If you’re implying, I have a
Whilst he wished there was nothing pressing at his mind, there was a question he needed to ask, and he wasn’t sure when he would get the chance again. “Auntie?” he asked. “How did you feel when you were disowned?” he asked, staring at his hands. His numbness to the entire situation had been concerning him, despite Harry
“Potter,” Malfoy greeted, leaning his elbows on the counter. “Gracing us with your presence again I see.”
“I’ll get you to slip up one day,” Harry chuckled. He bit his lower lip as Malfoy looked momentarily horrified.
Harry felt his stomach drop. “I’m sorry, you’ve probably missed all of first lesson because of me,” he said, shame washing over him as he spoke.
Harry stayed on the path, not wanting to intrude, but Scorpius had other plans. “Harry!” the small blond called out, beckoning him over. Hesitating, Harry glanced at Malfoy who raised a single eyebrow, challenging him to say no to his son. “Lyra, Cygnus, this is my new friend Harry Potter,’ Scorpius said to two of the closest ducks as Harry arrived. “He’s nice.”
“Cryptic...” Draco muttered, smiling, nonetheless. “Do you really think they’ll be able to ameliorate the situation?”
Taking his hand between his own two hands, Harry squeezed it tightly, to let Draco know he was there. “I bet you miss her a lot,” Harry said, as Draco nodded.
“Yes, no… I don’t know,” Harry muttered, shrinking into the sofa. He wished he had some tea. “I’m not looking for a relationship, but if one happens, then it happens.”
Harry sighed, shifting his position to look back at Draco. “It’s OK,” he muttered, and Draco looked at Harry as if he’d gone mad. “Well, it’s not at all OK and I still want to hex him for it,” he said, and Draco chuckled. “But what I

Harry shook his head. “It was so weird, but we actually had a conversation that didn’t make me want to hex the shit out of him,”
him there.”
Potter rolled his eyes. “You’ve been staring at the shop for the past 5 days Malfoy, I noticed,” he chuckled.
In that moment, Draco looked not only pained but also completely unfazed. His face couldn't decide on an expression of how he was feeling.
“That’s entirely untrue,” Draco announced, walking to the middle of the room. Harry almost entirely lost his balance and fell to the floor. “I keep you around for your name, it’s very good for business,” he drawled, smirking as Harry rolled his eyes.
and saw that it was 8:17am.
The boy took a shaky breath. “No,” he said, chuckling nervously.
They sat, watching the sun set over the hills, shivering from the cold – Harry hadn’t thought that part through when he followed Malfoy up the astronomy tower. The snow glistened as the light reflected from the sun, making it look like liquid gold. The edges of the Black lake were frozen, and Harry could see the ripples of water as the giant squid brushed across the surface. A few students were visible, wandering around the grounds, making snowmen, and throwing snowballs before the sun set.
“You’re doing brilliantly mon cœur,” he said to Scorpius, leaving Harry stunned.
As he left their corner, he didn’t miss the look they shared, a look of concern.
believed that was a real thing,” Harry teased, earning a small smile from Malfoy.
his legal guardian, since Andromeda decided she’s too old to raise a child.” Draco watched as in the photo, the boy’s hair went from honey blond to bubblegum pink. He felt bad that he didn’t carry any photos of Scorpius around. “I tried to tell her she wasn’t, but she insisted I cared for him. I’m glad I said yes.” Harry smiled at the photo before he put it back in his pocket.
. It isn’t the same.”
“My father has strongly implied that he wants me to – that I’m going to get,” Draco shook his hands, flexing his fingers. “He wants me to become a

and Harry didn’t want to risk Sirius’ freedom.
“Sure,” Potter smiled. “It was good to see you Draco, I haven’t seen much of anybody I know besides the Weasley’s for a long time.”
“It all depends on what the wand’s made of,” said Potter. “Dragon Heartstring cores are the ficklest with their owners. Wands with Dragon Heartstring cores choose people based off their values and beliefs but as soon as these change, the wand no longer has a connection to the owner,” Potter explained. “Phoenix Feathers are more flexible. They flow with the ‘rebirth’ of their owners,” Draco rolled his eyes at Potter’s lame pun with a small smile. “But, changing too quickly can cause the wands to fall out of sync with their owners. Now, Unicorn Hair,” Potter made a point to look at Draco, knowing that his wand’s core was Unicorn Hair. “They’re the most loyal. Ollivander never had anyone need to exchange their wand if it had unicorn hair.” Potter looked lost in thought again.
Draco could have sworn he saw Potter’s smile widen at that before he shook his head. “Who in Merlin’s name told you you’ll only ever own one wand?” he asked, his eyebrows furrowed as Draco looked back out the window to avoid eye contact.
“In the classroom? What did I do?” he asked, part of him hoping he had done to Snape what he did to Aunt Marge.
“You still need to be careful Harry,” Hermione advised, an eyebrow raised. “I know you believe him, but, just in case.”
For a brief moment, Harry thought Ron was offended he had never said anything, but with one look at his friend’s face, he noticed that, that wasn’t it at all. Harry shrugged. “It didn’t seem important,” he said, not wanting to talk about it. “I have to talk to you two.”
The point was, Draco hadn’t received any news from his family over the past week, despite writing letters to them.
had quite a few regulars. The boy smiled politely at the regulars and held himself as if he was ten years older.
“But she should be
When Andromeda opened the door, Draco saw a man he did not expect to see. “Professor Lupin?” he asked, furrowing his eyebrows. It was a reasonable response to seeing Remus Lupin, as anyone would be a little confused to see someone who used to be their teacher, in their aunt’s kitchen.
“Scarhead,” Draco grinned, and Harry shook his head, opening his mouth the respond when Remus cleared his throat.
“Fuck,” Harry muttered, scrambling to his feet, and pacing the tower. “Fuck!” he exclaimed, causing Malfoy to flinch. “Anything else?” he asked, looking back at Malfoy, hoping there was more he could tell Harry.

which stood on the corner opposite. It was covered in ivy and the flowers seemed to glisten, as if they had a preservation charm on them. Upon closer inspection, he found that, that was exactly why the flowers glistened.
Harry nodded. “Perfectly,” he replied calmly, placing the Prophet down on the table before standing up. He knew half the Great Hall was also staring at him, along with his friends. “I’m going back to the common room, see you in a bit,” he muttered, not waiting for an answer as he walked out the Great Hall and down the halls, heading for the one place no one would find him – the Astronomy Tower.
“A Muggleborn?” Blaise asked, his eyebrow raised. “Your father let you talk to a Muggleborn?” he asked, unconvinced.
Harry didn’t look too worried anymore, and Draco couldn’t help but smile at the fact. “Do they play it at Hogwarts?” Harry asked, and Ron looked as if the thought that they didn’t was criminal.
“Salazar you’re sentimental Potter,” Draco muttered, a small smile lighting up his features.
“Malfoy?” Ron asked. “Bloody Merlin mate, why did it have to be Malfoy,” he groaned, leaning back into the sofa.
, but he still felt bad about it.
“Ladon was the dragon that guarded the golden apples in the Gardens of
“None of them are particularly convincing,” Blaise sighed, sinking into his seat.
Malfoy leaned forwards towards Harry. “What’s got your knickers in a twist then? Fallen out with the Weasel?” he said, prodding at the open wound on Harry’s mind.

Cedric nodded, contemplating Draco’s words. “Did you
I’m right, I’m always right,” Draco said, embracing Scorpius in a sideways hug and kissing his forehead.
, sorry, you probably don’t want to talk about it,” Draco apologised, looking at the ground as they walked.
“A date,” Harry confirmed, a small smile pulling at his mouth as Draco smirked.
is why I hate that people think you’ll only have one wand,” he muttered, flicking his wand to chance to open sign to closed. “This might take a minute,” he said when Draco glanced at the sign in confusion. “You know how the wand chooses the wizard yeah?” he asked. Draco nodded, remembering being told so when he first got his wand. “Right, so, the wand can also decide it’s no longer the wand you need.”
“I think it was written by the creator of this manor,” Draco explained, closing the book to look at the cover. “It goes on about how the house seems to have a mind of it’s own - the author called it the House Heart,” he continued, unable to make eye contact with Harry as he spoke. “It’s strange really,” he chuckled, rubbing the back of his neck. “You’d have thought the Malfoy Manor was similar, but it’s the opposite really, it sucks you in, like a void.”
“Be glad we know you,” Blaise chuckled as Draco smiled at him.
Harry should have expected people to talk about his outburst.
“Sod off,” he muttered, just loud enough for Harry to hear and not Scorpius.
Draco couldn’t help but laugh. “You’re right,” he said, and Harry sat up straighter at the praise.
Sirius?” she asked, assuming Lupin had come straight from Sirius.
Potter coughed. “So, you want to try and find a new wand? It might take a while, usually I ask some questions first to see if I can figure out what wand someone needs.”
In reality, they were hiding, sort of. Draco knew Harry didn’t wish to speak to Ron and Hermione, and he wondered how much that extended to the entire Weasley family.
“I’ve spoken to her before, she gave some good advice on baking bread,” Harry reminisced. She had also told him that he and Draco make a wonderful couple, but he wasn’t going to tell him that.
come in,” he said, sounding relieved.
Draco rubbed the bridge of his nose. He knew eventually he would have to visit Potter’s shop, but he would rather not.
It didn’t.
“Scared Malfoy?” Harry taunted, smirking as Draco froze.
There was a lot relating to the dark arts in this library. Draco wasn’t surprised, the Malfoy Library was no different.
Casting another
he’ll be in Hufflepuff Blaise,” she chuckled, as Draco let out a nervous laugh. He felt his stomach drop as he became more uncertain about where he would be sorted. Whilst he didn’t dislike the other houses, he knew that he needed to be in Slytherin to please his family and his friends. “Besides, it doesn’t change that he’s our friend, even if he is a little soft,” she joked, making Draco elbow her in the stomach.
“I’m not sure how to bring it up in conversation,” Harry sighed. “Not because I’m ashamed to be friends with Draco!” he added hastily, seeing Andromeda’s eyes darken. “But because I’m unsure how everyone else feels about him. I don’t want him to get hurt because someone decides to go and punch him,” he said, curling up as best he could around his cup.
. He wished he could tell his past self to stop being a selfish-dick and be this boy’s Father, but he couldn’t, so he did all he could, and held Teddy close, hugging the boy with all the love he could muster.

It didn’t help.
“Now why don’t you go help your Dad and Hugo in the kitchen?” Hermione encouraged.
“Not to everyone Potter,” he said, his voice devoid of emotion. “It’s all right I suppose. Everyone will have their opinions on what I did.” As he spoke, he forced a smile to Scorpius who waved his arm vigorously, grinning from ear to ear.
Yet, there wasn’t much to misunderstand about the phrase,
sorry Auntie!” he added quickly, ducking as she tried to hit him around the back of the head.
“Oh,” Harry said meekly, watching as the gold and red mixture swirled in his teacup.
“I can’t deny I’m curious,” he chuckled, and Harry’s face lit up.
Draco wouldn't take that chance.
“The grin says otherwise Potter,” Draco smirked as he began to look through the shelves.
However, they didn’t need to; Harry was already halfway out the door when he realised what he’d done.
“Harry,” Draco said, deciding it might not be the best idea to say it was Harry Potter. It would seem a little like he was boasting, and he didn’t want anyone to think he was only friends with Harry because he was Harry Potter.
“That’s a yes then,” Harry said, laughing as Rose whooped and grabbed her brothers’ hand, dragging him up the stairs so they could pick a game. “Careful Rosie, you’ll run into something,” Harry called after them.
so it’s bedtime,” he said with a firm nod making Draco chuckle.
“And have you ever had any issues before?” Potter asked, clearly electing to ignore Draco’s other comments.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Do you even know how to punch?” he asked, appearing genuine, and Draco rolled his eyes.
, no, he was distant and cold and – well,” she paused, gesturing with her hand. “He received some

be escorting you.”
“Harry,” he heard Remus’ heartbreak and Harry realised he said that aloud.
Harry ran his fingers through his hair. “Don’t sugar coat it too much, I might be sick,” he muttered.
It was a Thursday and the dread of going back to work was settling in, but the smell of ginger and apples let his mind forget for a while. The shop was emptier than usual, but Harry only cared about his sofa seat by the fireplace, which was yet to be claimed.
Draco chuckled. “I’m sure she’ll listen to you,” he said, his voice dripping with sarcasm.
still seen as a bad thing?” he grumbled, raising his hands in exasperation.
Harry was watching him, with a slightly bemused, amused expression. “We’ll face it together then,” he nodded, his voice filled with a certainty Draco wished he could feel about everything.
Andromeda smiled too. “You know, I happened to meet an enthusiastic eight-year-old today,” she said, as if talking about the weather.
With an exasperated glance at Draco, Harry conceded, handing Draco the card. “Enjoy your hollow victory,” he sneered, but when Draco did a mini victory dance, a smile tugged at his lips.
Suddenly, Draco stopped, his eyebrows furrowed at he looked at a collection of books. “They’re in the wrong order,” he muttered to himself, squinting as if to be sure.
“Charming, am I?” he said, wiggling his eyebrows at Draco.
Draco giggled. He had spent the train journey trying to ignore his excitement but as they pulled into the station, Draco was practically vibrating, a smile plastered on his face; a smile that almost looked painful.
The boy pondered over this for a while. “Where would you like to go?”
As soon as Sirius called the Order, everyone went straight for the Ministry to apprehend the Death Eaters. Sirius had kept his promise to Harry, despite wanting to join the others, particularly Remus (Harry checked with Remus to see if Sirius was telling the truth - he was). Remus recounted the events that had transpired at the Ministry, explaining that it had been a Prophecy they were after, but Dumbledore refused to share what it was about to anyone other than Harry - "It's best you pay him a visit when you can Cub, he might change his mind on the subject."
“And Harry will still be here in a few minutes, I just want to talk to him about boring grown-up things.” Those appeared to be the magic words and Harry had to stifle a laugh as Rose groaned and scrunched up her nose.
Harry nodded, “Unless you don’t want to perform magic?”
It hit Harry like a bucket of cold ice water.
“And you’re worried how your sorting will be received?’ Cedric asked, though it was more of a statement than a question.
“No,” the boy responded, shuffling on his feet.
“Your Dad is just looking out for you,” Harry said, going to take another sip of his tea, only to realise he had finished another cup. “Dragons are really dangerous; my friend is always covered in burns,” he explained, pouring another cup of tea.
The older Malfoy was still bemused when Scorpius ran up to him and tackled him into a hug. “Dad! Dad!” Scorpius beamed, his smile pushing at his face in a way that made it seem permanent. “The – the - it’s - le cerf est si joli, est-ce qu-on peut le garder? S'il te plaît,” he asked, looking pleadingly at his father.
Ron reached out to place a hand on his shoulder, but faltered when Harry flinched, lifting the Daily Prophet in front of his face. He frowned. “Harry, mate, are you all right?”
peacock pecked at my arm and he was more concerned about the peacock?” Pansy shuddered. “Mother is still upset about it.”
“Where Granger and Andromeda were also influencing them?” Draco asked, making eye contact with Harry, who couldn’t help but blush. Smiling sheepishly at Draco, he ducked his head slightly under the amused gaze of the Malfoy.
“When?” Harry asked, his blood beginning to boil at the idea that someone’s own family would force someone into this position, just as Sirius’ brother had.
He had to be in the office at 8:45am.
Harry nodded; relieved Teddy was okay with the idea. “Why’s that?”
he asked, starting to get a little concerned. It appeared he wasn’t the only one as he noticed McGonagall watching him closely.
“What’s Quidditch?” Harry asked.
Harry shrugged. “Not sure,” he said, staring at the trees. “Not long,” he added, when Draco’s eyebrows began to furrow. “I didn’t have another nightmare though,” Harry said, smiling at Draco who felt his face heat.
Draco and Ron looked at each other, debating who was going to tell him the answer. “Sometimes,” Ron replied, and upon seeing the worry appear on Harry’s face, Draco decided to elaborate.
“Sadly,” Remus muttered, laughing as Sirius elbowed him. Harry blinked, dazed. He never noticed, but it explained
He could just about make out the confused whispers of everybody in the Great Hall over his own muddled thoughts.
With a smile, Harry left Draco to his own devices and went to join Scorpius, rather than sitting at his usual spot by the fireplace. “Good Morning Scorp’,” he said. “And Ladon,” he added, seeing the green dragon tucked in the blond’s arms.
“I guess,” he muttered. “It would explain a lot.”
Potter grinned, “I heard you were studying to become a healer.”
He pushed the heels of his palms into his eyes to stop the tears.
are moonstruck my dear,” she said, her eyes shining as Harry felt himself go red.
“Of course, you’re my little star aren’t you?” Draco laughed as Scorpius squealed in glee.
“The one and the same,” Harry said. “He was a close friend of my Dad’s,” he explained, and Draco made an ‘O’ shape with his mouth.
“Sorry, sorry, I’m not mocking you, it’s just,” Harry grinned. “I always thought you hated me, and it’s pretty much the opposite.”
“It’s strange,” Harry said to Draco, as Scorpius had fallen asleep on the sofa. “Halloween is usually a time where I feel guilty for being happy when I should be remembering my parents,” Harry explained quietly, so as not to wake Scorpius. “But today, I celebrated Samhain and I felt happy, and I felt sad too I suppose, for a moment, but not guilty.”
“When’s Sirius’ trial?” Draco asked, as Harry leaned his head on Draco’s shoulder.
-----
When he was satisfied with his father’s explanation, the child walked back to his table, stopping to talk to all the customers as he did. It seemed that
“’Course I will,
Draco quickly shifted the weight of the books to his other arm and Harry held out a hand, offering to take the books from him for a moment – Draco was the one looking at the shelves anyway. Instead, however, Draco placed his hand in Harry’s and continued to look at the shelves.
Harry, wait up!” he heard a voice yell from the end of the corridor. He turned to see Ron and Hermione bounding towards him, looking as if they’d ran around the whole castle.
what you just told us?” Remus asked, a pained expression running over his face for a split-second.
Harry instinctively reached for his wand, but his hand froze before he reach into his pocket when he saw Parkinson and Zabini, clearly attempting to be somewhat intimidating, but after facing Voldemort, nothing else seemed particularly threatening.
His situation hit him at full force, like a wave on the sand during a storm, and he was no longer able to pretend to be indifferent. Crying into his knees, he curled up on the window seat, pressing his back into the wall behind him, wanting to go home and star-gaze with his mother.
,” he said quietly, and Draco moved to sit next to him. Harry was glad that Draco knew what he was talking about.
Draco nodded again. It made sense of course.
“You can tell a lot about a Wizard by how good his tea is!” Ron insisted, and Harry fell into a fit of laughter. “It means he doesn’t use magic to make it,” he said, and Hermione looked contemplative for a moment.
“I feel like there might be more to that sentence,” Andromeda added, smiling into her tea.
“You love my sappyness, don’t deny it.”
Harry rolled his eyes with a smile. “It was because Dobby sealed the gateway and, well, at the time, he was
“Oh, I get it,” Sirius chuckled. “You’re as bad as Remus,” he muttered with a small smile. “I still don’t like that you’ve fallen for a Malfoy –“
“Oh, not at all, not at all,” she said, smiling at Malfoy. She glanced between the three of them. “He’s such a sweet boy, you two –“
Breathing in shakily, Draco flexed his fingers, wincing as his knuckles cracked. Myrtle’s bathroom was rather peaceful when she wasn’t here. Draco hadn’t planned on entering the room, but he was hit with a sudden wave of realisation he couldn’t ignore.
His vision blurred as he tried to read one of the letters, and he clutched them to his chest, as if that would replicate a hug. It felt as if his heart had turned to stone and was ripping through his insides as it fell to the floor. His stomach twisted and he tried to take a deep breath.
With Delphinus on his shoulder, he left the hall, ignoring the confused looks from Pansy and Blaise at the Slytherin table, and the piercing gaze of one Harry Potter.
Draco couldn’t help but smile. “And if I know Harry, he’s probably going to want to hex something,” he joked.
“How was France?” he asked, sitting next to her on the sofa.
He saw Harry grin in the corner of his eye. “It’s to do with values isn’t it? So, it would make sense for families to be in the same house.”
“As are you Malfoy,” he replied, not looking up as he poured himself another cup of tea. “And it’s Harry,” he said, offering Malfoy a small smile.
want to kiss you right now,” Harry admitted in earnest, running his fingers through his hair.
,” Draco said, glancing at Harry for longer than necessary. “I was taught manners,” he grinned, and Harry scoffed.
“Merlin no,” Harry crinkled his nose, shaking his head.
went to Hogwarts, that was when I noticed him becoming everything I disliked about my family. He was Slytherin; he was prejudiced; he was stuck-up; he was a complete git actually,” Sirius chuckled.
Ron’s face exploded into a ray of emotions until he managed to blurt out, “the pointy git mentioned Kreacher? How would he even…?” he trailed off, looking questioningly at Hermione, who looked just as concerned.
“Then I’ll go.”
The door creaked open, and Draco’s eyes darted in the direction of the noise. “Draco?” It was Harry. “What are you doing in here?” he asked, his eyebrows furrowing as his eyes scanned Draco’s face for an answer.
Teddy had never asked many questions about Remus, and Harry had never wanted to push. He was glad that Hogwarts had sparked a curiosity in him. Whilst he was hardly the person to ask about Tonks (he thankfully had Andromeda for that) there were parts of the Marauders lives that he could relay to Teddy. It couldn’t be as much as he liked, and he finally understood how Sirius had felt when he asked questions about his Dad; there were parts of them you couldn’t explain because you didn’t know yourself.
He threw the letters back at his trunk, standing as he did.
The fireplace was not ablaze, but the wood had been reduced to orange embers which reminded Harry of the time he read bedtime stories to Teddy after he awoke from a nightmare.
“Is that a yes?” Harry asked.
the hat said. If it had a face, Draco was certain the hat would be smirking.
When nothing happened, Harry saw Malfoy open one of his eyes and take a peek at Harry, who hadn’t moved from his position but had his eyebrows furrowed as he stared at Malfoy. “What do you think I came here to do?” Harry asked.
Harry nodded, shivering at the lack of heat. He wished he could skip Potions and curl up in front of the fire in the Gryffindor common room. As much as he hated Snape, and the cold, Hermione would have his head if he even voiced that he was genuinely considering skipping a class during the year of their OWL’s. “Can’t wait to not only be cold, but have to deal with Snape for two hours,” Harry grumbled, already in a foul mood due to Umbridge’s lesson previously.
“Not about
As they stopped in front of the bookshop, Harry couldn’t help but chuckle at Draco’s dull tone. “Oh,
“Master Harry,” Kreacher said, picking up the mirror shard.
about Kreacher is concerning,” she said, looking lost in thought. “Do you think,” she began, before whispering, “do you think he
“Harry!” he saw a flurry of blond hair and his mind went to his Aunt Petunia. He pressed himself further against the wall and raised his arms to cover his face. The blur of blond instantly froze, and instead of approaching Harry, they closed the door and sat in front of him. “Harry, it’s me, Malfoy.”
“And that,” Harry smiled, as Teddy yawned, rubbing his eyes. “Tired?” he asked, knowing he must be. The train journey from Hogwarts was always exhausting. Ron said it was due to being confined to a tiny carriage. He took the pan off the stove and added the hot chocolate powder, and some cinnamon, then pouring a cup for them both.
generous of the Dursley’s to let me have the
’ replayed over and over in Harry’s mind. Harry had never thought about it being abuse. “Pads,” Remus said quietly. Harry only just heard Remus speak.
“A little,” Draco said.
Draco nodded, before having a moment of his own realisation. “I haven’t called him that around you, have I?” he asked with his eyebrows raised, a small smile on his lips.
Hermione sighed. “But what if he didn’t,
Mrs Weasley didn’t try to correct Harry this time.
but – I mean you don’t have to – if you – it’s just that,” Harry said, going darker with each word and Draco laughed.
“Good,” he nodded. “When are you meeting them?”
The silence emanating from the house, almost made Harry want to scream, just to fill the emptiness. In the first few years after the war, the house was never truly quiet. Ginny would be sat in the living room with Teddy when she wasn’t practising Quidditch or playing a match. Their laughter would echo off the walls and Harry would be able to hear it wherever he was in the house.
Draco snapped his head in her direction. “
Over the next few hours, they fell into a routine. Harry could see why Draco loved the teashop so much. He enjoyed talking to people, getting their orders, and seeing how much they enjoyed the tea Draco would make. Even when the orders started to slow, Harry continued to help, not only because he wanted to, but because he found that he enjoyed it.
Evelyn chuckled. “Well, it was good to see you Harry, don’t let me keep you,” she said. “And it was wonderful to meet you, Draco? Was it?” Draco nodded. “I hope to see you both soon,” she smiled, waving to them as they left.
“It’s not a date,” he hissed. “It’s professional. I need a wand if I want to pass my exams so the sooner I get one, the better.”
Sirius laughed as Lupin handed them all a cup of tea. Draco wasn’t the biggest fan of tea, but he drank it, nonetheless. “Are you staying for long Andie?” Sirius asked, all prior teasing forgotten. “The Weasley’s won’t be here for a while, Molly took them back to the Burrow to tend to the animals.”
“Well, I was going to
Turning to truly look at Harry, Draco noticed the fiery green eyes, the eyes that intrigued Draco when they were eleven.
Harry groaned, lifting his head. “I was acquitted,” he replied, and the entire room breathed a sigh of relief. “But the Ministry can go
Practically running to the tower, Harry made sure to keep glancing at the Map to check Malfoy was still in the tower. Thankfully, when he reached the stairs to the top of the tower, Malfoy’s name was still darting about the tower.
“All right Father,” Draco said, not looking directly at his father.
Teddy sighed, resting his head on the table. “But Uncle Harry,” he began, resting his chin on the top of his hand. “Why is it dangerous?” he asked.
“No, no, don’t try to weasel your way out of this Potter, you’ve piqued my interest,” Draco insisted, internally remarking on how soft Harry’s hair was. “So, tell me – what’s my biggest flaw?” he asked, biting back a grin as Harry smiled at him.
“My dad makes the best chocolate cake, you should try some, it’s the best,” the boy grinned, sitting down in the armchair.
And Draco waited.
“Wait!” Teddy exclaimed suddenly. “Can I have hot chocolate?” he asked with a pleading smile.
Then he thought about the Weasley’s, who had shown him nothing but kindness, who would now think he didn’t trust them because they didn’t know.
Harry shook his head. Then, only a second later he sighed and nodded. “I – I’ve never told
’ Draco thought.
Draco pouted. “She started it!” he insisted, and Harry rubbed at his temples, not wanting to deal with this right now.
“Not at all,” he said, ignoring Pansy who was smirking in his direction. “I hope it wasn’t too much trouble to get here, but I thought if we did this now, then it would be easier tomorrow.” Draco resisted the urge to fidget in his seat. “Tea?” he asked, offering Harry the teapot.
” Scorpius whispered to the dragon, and, as if awaking from a prolonged slumber, the toy dragon seemed to blink, stretching his wings and shaking himself from head to tail. The green scales became metallic looking and shimmered with a red tinge that made it impossible for Harry not to be impressed by this toy.
, as he has threatened to do,” she sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose. “You have twenty minutes.”
Draco delicately brushed his finger across the spine of each book, carefully inspecting the name of each of them. Harry couldn’t help but smile as the soft orange glow of the lights above made Draco’s hair look as if it had flecks of silver and gold woven into it, as well as illuminating the sharp angles of his face.
Harry’s eyes widened. “How old was he?”
“But I want to play with Uncle Harry!” she protested, stomping her foot on the ground.
“Well Hermione finished the exam
“What do you mean,
Draco rolled his eyes. “You
“It has,” Harry nodded. Whilst he did get to see Remus over Christmas, he didn’t manage to see much of his old professor. It was only when he heard a soft barking, that Harry pulled away from the hug. “Hi Snuffles,” Harry teased, earning a laugh from Remus and a huff of indignance from Sirius.
“Queen of Hearts,” Harry said, and Draco shook his head again.
The library was Draco’s second favourite hide away at Hogwarts – the Hufflepuff common room being his favourite. With bookshelves that reached higher than the tips of his fingers, three floors of twisting aisles, and the quiet humming of magic, whispers, and pages being turned – it always made Draco feel at home. It held a different sort of comfort to the Black library, which was a comfort for its familiarity to the library at Malfoy Manor. The Hogwarts library was warm and inviting, as if he was sitting next to the fireplace with a friend.
“I get it,” Draco said, staring through the trees as the stars began to appear. He knew Pansy and Blaise must be getting worried by now. “And to be honest, if I
he said, spinning Harry around.
“I wouldn’t hold it against you to be honest.”
“Did I say that?” Draco asked, feigning innocence. “I seem to remember I said I tolerated you.”
As he pulled away, he saw Malfoy’s smirk and rolled his eyes instinctively. “I’ll see you around Draco.”
“I’ll alert the Order, but Harry, you must stay at Hogwarts all right? You can’t run off to the Ministry just because this trap was set for you,” Sirius said, his eyes scanning Harry’s face as he looked away.
“I don’t expect we’d have the best heart to heart Potter,” Malfoy smirked, glancing back at Harry. “Besides, would you tell
“It’s a Muggle sport,” Draco said. “I think,” he added, looking toward Harry who nodded with a small smile to tell him he was right. “Then there’s the beaters who use bats to hit about the bludger, making sure it doesn’t knock anyone on
Draco stared at the pieces of red paper, trying to process the words of his father, when he heard a snapping behind him.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “If I was going to kill you Potter, I’d have done it by now,” he drawled, folding his arms.
“We’ve established you’re handsome, now scram,” Draco said, making a shooing gesture with his hands, his face a light shade of pink.
A few days had passed since their meeting at the lake, and Draco had tried to visit Harry every day since. Pansy and Blaise insisted it was a lost cause, Madam Pomfrey was very stubborn when it came to her patients. On his fourth try, she left muttering about how it was bad enough that the entire Weasley family insisted on visiting Harry every other day, and something about a dog.
Draco nodded. “My wand hasn’t been acting as it should as of late,” he said, still avoiding looking at Potter, who’s oddly nice behaviour unnerved him.
“See you then Draco.”
Draco had been numb since the end of the third task.
“Here,” Harry said, shoving a hot chocolate at Draco. “You’ve been in here all day, it’s freezing,” he shivered, sipping his own hot chocolate.
“Harry,” Draco smiled. “So, it
“We got into an argument, it wasn’t pretty, and I left,” Sirius said, his eyes never leaving the shelves opposite them. “I’d been expecting to be kicked out and disowned for years, and then
The two sat in silence, soaking in each other’s presence and the last warm of the setting sun. It was difficult to process everything that had happened over the past few months, but they had been there for each other through it all.
“We’ve made good progress,” Hermione enthused. “To be honest, we’re hoping at the moment to make sure it’s illegal to fire them
Draco rolled his eyes.
“Yeah, it’s me,” Harry said, unable to sit still. “Have you – has Remus – Did you read today’s Prophet?”
“Make sure to write to me dear,” she said as he climbed aboard the train.
He sighed, slowing down his pace as he walked through a small park, and watched as parents kept an eye on their children as they ran around. His eye was particularly drawn in by a man with sky blue hair and a boy with platinum blond hair, feeding the ducks. He couldn’t hear what they were saying, but he smiled as the boy began to jump up and down. Maybe it was the boy’s birthday, or perhaps the man had just told the child they were going on holiday. Maybe he had just told his son they were having takeout for dinner.
Whilst Cedric’s words did make him feel a little better, the house itself was not the reason he was crying on a window seat. Draco shook his head, trying to figure out how to word his worries to Cedric, who seemed nice enough. “I –“ he began, shuffling about as he felt pins-and-needles in his feet. “Everyone expected me to be in Slytherin.”
“Positive,” Draco said, his teeth gritted as he furiously scribbled at the piece of parchment, despite knowing it was a waste of parchment. “If
tell your mother,” Pansy said quickly and angrily, as if trying to drill it into Draco’s head.
His mother helped him through the crowd, levitating his trunk onto the train, placing a lightening charm on it so he’d be able to get it off the train. “Sorry your father couldn’t see you off darling,” she said. Her voice had always sounded like wind-chimes to Draco – it was calming.
-----
“I’ll visit,” Harry said, covering his mouth with his teacup. “I – I will, I miss him too,” he admitted, and Andromeda smiled warmly.
Harry laughed. “Because there’s never anything left,” he said. Between his own sweet tooth and Draco’s, and Scorpius’, they were lucky if there were any crumbs left.
“Did you know dragon’s fire breath can be up to 300°C?” Scorpius said, bouncing enthusiastically on the armchair, and Scorpius then began to explain everything he knew about dragons; Harry was amazed at how much this child knew. Half of the facts he was explaining, Harry had never heard before.
“And here I thought Gryffindors were supposed to be fun,” Draco scoffed, and Harry rolled his eyes.
Harry glanced at Teddy and Scorpius, who were laughing, and Teddy looked as if he was in the middle of re-telling an exciting story. He glanced up at Draco. “You mean a lot to me too.”
last a year, the charms wear off...”
,” Draco began. “How are you really?” he asked.
“Hello Mr Potter, I’m Scorpius and I’m six and a half years old,” he said, sticking his hand out for a handshake, as he’d seen Draco do when meeting new people.
"Sure, and you haven’t had a crush on him since 4th year,” Pansy deadpanned.
“Oh,” he said. “OH, are you seeing someone?” Ron asked, excitedly, and George couldn’t help but laugh.
“That means kiss me again you twit,” Draco said, smirking as Harry’s eyes widened in realisation.
Teddy laughed, and Harry felt himself sigh internally with relief. “I have actually,” Teddy grinned, as Scorpius’ eyes widened, as he bounced about even more. “Would you like to hear about it?” he asked.
“It’s alright,” Draco said. “Explains why it stopped working about a month ago actually.”
Harry shrugged and smiled sheepishly. “I don’t mind that you work here Malfoy, the war was twelve years ago, I doubt you’re the same person,” Harry said, his eyes unable to focus on Malfoy, and instead looking at the empty fireplace. “You aren’t, are you?” Harry needed to ask.
“Honestly ‘Mione, I don’t care because if he does have Sirius, he will kill him and I can’t lose Sirius, not yet – I can’t just – he’s my,” he stumbled over his words, pulling at his hair. “Fuck, Hermione,” Harry yelled, at no one but himself.
“Outstanding vocabulary Ginevra, I’m impressed you know what that means” Draco replied nonchalantly, turning his attention back to Harry, who was staring at him with a raised eyebrow. “What?”
Without explaining himself, Harry looked at the shard and said, “Sirius Black,” watching as his reflection rippled away into what appeared to be the ceiling of one of the rooms at Grimmauld Place. “Sirius?” he called out, and he called out again when he got no response.
Harry woke up in a cold sweat. He needed to get to Sirius. He needed to leave, now.
He had spent the past few days frantically making sure Grimmauld Place would be welcoming to Teddy. He had been so obsessed with making sure his home was inviting, that Draco had shown up to see if he was okay. The two of them ended up spending the afternoon redecorating the living room, and then Draco insisted Harry sit down and relax.
Draco thought for a moment – it was a complicated question. He used to, and he used to hate Harry for that exact reason. His laugh, his wit, his smile, his eyes, everything about him used to make Draco confused. Until he left Hogwarts and met Astoria, someone who loved him back, faults and all, and he forgot all about Harry. It was only when Scorpius asked this question however, it made him realise something. “You know what Scorpius, I think I do,” he replied, suddenly unsure of what to think.
Draco looked at his cousin and it felt good to be understood, even only on a surface level. “Thank you,” he mumbled, and Sirius smiled at him before glancing back at the books.
“Woop-de-doo,” Teddy mumbled. “It’s better than floo though,” he added after a moment of contemplation. “You don’t end up covered in soot afterward,” he said, and Harry had to agree.
“It’s endearing Draco, admit it,” Harry teased. Draco rolled his eyes and Harry couldn’t help but laugh.
“Of course I do,” he huffed.
“She won’t
“He doesn’t believe in what his father does, if that’s what you’re asking,” Harry assured, prepared to stick up for Draco if he needed to.
spell, you know what that is right?” she asked, and Draco rolled his eyes.
“Well –“ Draco began, but he found he was unable to finish his sentence. “It’s a growing up in the Wizarding World thing, isn’t it?” he asked, appalled with himself for missing it.
Harry nodded. “Oh definitely,” he grinned.
“I -" Harry was about to say he wasn’t going to do that. “I won’t,” he promised, and Draco sighed in relief.
“You don’t have to tell us where you go, but knowing that you
people,” she pouted, and Draco patted her arm sympathetically.
He felt the usual pull from beneath his feet as he apparated and held on tight to Teddy. As they landed, Harry quickly turned to Teddy to see if he was okay, to see him grinning. “That’s so much better when you know what to expect,” Teddy said, laughing.
Harry thought for a moment as Draco looked at his expression, confused. Harry took a deep breath and said, “how about dinner?” he asked, looking up at Draco’s face for a reaction.
Ron continued to make sputtering noises as Hermione rolled her eyes and Harry felt a little lighter. He had been so worried that they would hate Draco, it was nice to know they didn’t.
“OK, what’s the plan, do you know where he is?” Ron asked softly, knowing how much Sirius means to Harry.
going or,
Harry shook his head.
Whilst he waited for Harry to reappear, he sat Scorpius on his lap, who would occasionally ask him what certain words meant.
Harry furrowed his eyebrows. “What do you mean?”
“Me,” Draco replied, his voice soft, but certain. He wasn’t sure if Harry could see that Draco was watching him with a concerned eye, but he hoped Harry knew that Draco meant every word he said.
area of the gardens visible to guests) but the other gardens were tinted orange from the hot sun, and the flowers had all wilted. The only part of the gardens still alive were the trees. Their green leaves were a reassuring comfort for Draco as he helped his mother tend to the grounds from time to time. She only tended to the gardens when she was annoyed about something, or worried; Draco had picked up on this through-out his childhood.
“’Mione’s been trying to get people to change the law Umbridge put into force after Lupin, but people seem to actually agree with it,” Ron said, and Harry groaned.
Scorpius shook his head, “no! Sleep!” he replied, and Draco shook his head with a smile.
Harry let out a surprised laugh. “Sure,” he replied, relaxing further onto Draco.
Unable to respond, Harry looked at Draco, as if asking ‘
Draco groaned. “Sorry,” he muttered, trying to hide in his jumper.
“I’ll talk to him,” Harry said firmly, knowing that if Sirius were right, Harry would be condemning Malfoy if he didn’t try to help.
“Oh, it’s OK, it’s not that bad, really. Besides Dumbledore won’t allow it.” Harry hated trying to talk them out of adopting him, but the truth to what he said made his stomach drop.
night,” he said, smiling at Draco who was looking at him with a fondness Harry had begun to notice over the past few weeks. It was almost invisible, his expression as collected as always, but his eyes would shine and become silver instead of grey, and the corners of his mouth would be slightly upturned.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Draco said, straightening his back. “You two are my best friends,” he grinned, linking arms with them both.
“I’ve noticed,” Harry sighed, remembering Warrington.
“I will!” he called out, walking further onto the train. He wanted to find Blaise and Pansy as soon as possible.
Not because Draco was unable to use magic (there was an upside to being in an untraceable house over the summer), but because Draco was worried he would accidentally set fire to the bookshelves. Harry insisted he would be fine, and hypothesised that the books were probably fireproof.
Harry grinned. “It was good, very bitter without honey though,” he admitted, rubbing the back of his neck as Malfoy continued to stare at him. It was similar to the stare Scorpius had given his earlier. ‘Like father like son,’ Harry mused. “Are you going to continue to stare at me, or tell me what it is you want to say?” Harry asked, raising an eyebrow. Malfoy’s face turned pink.
“Stop comparing your problems to other people’s Harry, that’s how you end up being miserable,” Draco whispered, Harry’s fingertips turning purple. “My father possibly forcing me to become a Death Eater does not mean that your
“I can wait,” Harry said, smiling. “By the way, do you want to know what your new wand symbolises?” he asked, and Draco nodded, although apprehensively.
, in part, so thank you.”
Humming in amused agreement, Draco shook his head. “I’m certain you don’t,” he chuckled. “Thank you, I haven’t seen him this excited in a while.”
It was one of the reasons why he was happy that Narcissa was taking him to Diagon Alley to get his Hogwarts supplies. He knew she would take them through the Muggle areas of London once they were done so that he could look at their creations much as Tellie Vision boxes and light switches.
“When I call your name, come up to the front and sit on the stool,” McGonagall explained, lifting up the hat. “Abbott, Hannah,” she called out.
“Gee, thanks,” he muttered with a sigh.
“We should just be thankful nothing was burnt to be honest,” George added, sitting where Hermione had been sat. “Hi ya’ Harry,” he grinned.
He returned to the first book he came across, pulling it from the shelf and curling up on one of the sofas.
Harry stared at Malfoy, his eyes scrutinising the other boys face for a hint of mistruth. “That’s not all is it,” Harry stated, blinking as Malfoy froze.
“You’d be an amazing Dad,” Scorpius remarked, grinning at Harry, completely unaware of the implications of what he just said.
Draco nodded, stirring the milk into his tea. “They start next week, I’ll be glad when they’re finished,” Draco sighed.
“Thanks,” he grinned, making Draco’s stomach flip.
Hermione nodded. “Yes, we can’t head there without a plan.”
Harry furrowed his eyebrows for a moment, but she wasn’t exactly wrong; there was a lot on his mind. “I suppose we might,” he said, smiling as she passed him a teacup. “Thanks,” he grinned, sipping on the tea.
“He became a Death Eater,” Harry said, watching as Sirius rubbed the bridge of his nose.
“If you weren’t a good person, or weren’t at least trying to be, Scorpius would show that,” Harry shrugged, shoving his hands in his coat pockets. “And even without that, it’s clear
to go on a date,” Harry muttered. “And besides, he’s a friend and nothing more,” he insisted. Even if he did have feelings for Draco, it was unlikely he felt the same. Their friendship was fragile enough.
This left Draco with many questions, but he knew not to ask them. There were certain topics a person should leave alone. There was a tension in the air that told Draco he should appreciate that Sirius told him this much. He was relieved to know he wasn’t alone in feeling numb.
to talk about it, that’s fine, but if you’re simply worried about being a burden…” Draco trailed off. This conversation felt familiar. “
“This one might be better,” Harry said, passing him another wand. “Willow, 10 inches, Phoenix feather.”
Ted shushed him and Draco ducked his head sheepishly. “He’s trying to convince her to let you go to a safe house he’s created.”
“Harry?” Draco said, standing up straight as Harry waved at him, entering the shop. It was still early in the day, and the shop was yet to fill with any customers; the only people in the shop were Draco and Scorpius, who was talking to Ladon. “Is everything, all right? You work on Saturdays,” he asked, his eyebrows furrowed.
“Do you regret it?” Draco asked, his eye’s scanning over Harry’s face as he rubbed his thumb in circles over the back of Harry’s hand.
With a hum, Harry grinned at Malfoy. “Of course, I would never.”
She sighed dramatically and Draco gave her a small smile, “I do, it’s one of the best jobs I’ve had – it’s helped me to learn so much about Muggles! But she’ll hate me, I know it.”
Harry said, surprised.
Draco’s face went bright pink, and he took a rather long sip from his teacup. “I’d say it’s rather common knowledge,” he said, avoiding Harry’s amused gaze.
“Prat,” Harry replied, lowering his arms slowly.
“That’s bad,” Sirius stated, and Harry rolled his eyes.
It was about three hours later when Harry realised, Draco was not kidding, nor was he exaggerating. The teashop was incredibly busy.
Sirius was clearly supressing a laugh. “Look, I can’t say I’m pleased that you have a Malfoy on your mind all the time,” he said, and Harry felt his blood rush to his face “But, if his warning is real, and it
Draco looked taken back. “You’d want to?”
“Yes,” Harry replied, rubbing the bridge of his nose, leaning back his head until it hit the books behind him.
?” Harry exclaimed again.
Draco wanted to respond to that but all he could do was nod and add a quick, “me too.”
“Does this Landon guard golden apples too?” Harry asked, sitting where Scorpius had gestured.
Lupin, in an act of trying to change the conversation, turned to Draco. “Are you all ready to go?” he asked.
Yet, every time he entered, all he received was an eerie silence; his hope shot down swiftly, leaving a feeling resembling that of a punch to the stomach.
Draco and Harry glanced at each other. Harry knew a relationship isn’t what Scorpius meant, but that is exactly where his mind went; by the blush on Draco’s cheeks, he assumed Draco had the same thought. His stomach jolted at the prospect. “Scorpius –“ Draco began.
Thankfully for Ron, the door opened
Teddy grinned. “That one seemed so cool,” he said, his attention quickly being grabbed by a bar of chocolate and he looked at Harry with a wide smile.
Snape’s cloak swept across the floor as he turned to face the class. “If your Befuddlement Draught appears to be correct, you will test the Draught on either yourself, or a fellow classmate,” Snape said, his eyes lingering on Harry for longer than he liked. “Follow the directions
“But then why are some people
Draco raised his eyebrows, stifling a laugh. “I suppose so,” he said.
“I can’t wait to see the Slytherin dormitories,” Blaise enthused. “I wonder how many snakes there’ll be there.”
knows what they thought they’d achieve,” he said, and Draco agreed. He couldn’t imagine that the Wizengamot were thrilled about the change, just as much as he knew Harry wasn’t.
The two were sat opposite each other in the attic, which Harry assured Draco was now safe as they had cleared it of all Dark artifacts only a few days prior.
Harry opened his mouth to ask again, only to be interrupted by his Godfather

,” he said, flinching at the name.
” she screeched, only fuelling Blaise’s laughter.
“So no different to normal then?” he joked, revelling in Draco’s laugh.
I really hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it
“This is brilliant,” Ron exclaimed. “Oi! ‘Mione!” he called out. “You owe me five Galleons,” he called across the living room, pointing at Harry.
“And Sirius, probably Lupin too,” Draco continued. “So, if you need us,
Raising his free hand in surrender, Harry tried his hardest not to laugh. “So, what’s the order?” he asked.
“What Hermione means is,” Ron interrupted. “We’re worried for you mate, really worried,” Ron said, his eyes fixed on Harry who shuffled awkwardly.
Except, his eyes were closed for longer than a second.
“I’ll have a Malfoy as a brother-in-law!” he exclaimed, and Hermione snorted as Harry blushed the deepest shade of red, he had ever gone in his life. “A
“Can I –“ Harry began. “Can I ask you something if it’s not about Hogwarts?” he asked, fiddling with the bottom of his t-shirt.
They laughed about the stupid things they used to do when they were eleven. Harry explained how Lupin had taught him how to produce a Patronus so he would stop fainting around dementors. Draco explained how once he accidentally set loose a rose bush in the Hufflepuff common room that wouldn’t stop growing and Professor Sprout insisted she personally tutor him on plant care so it wouldn’t happen again.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Ha ha, you’re hilarious,” he deadpanned. “Anyway, you clearly like me, even if it’s only a little, you said
“I don’t think my father has ever mentioned your family before,” Draco said, scrunching his eyebrows together as he tried to remember the conversations he had with his father.
“Thanks,” Harry grinned, feeling slightly awkward as Malfoy turned and left. It was odd to see Malfoy being polite; it was especially odd to see him being genuinely polite.
Harry grinned, though he was unsure what an ‘
Draco from talking to her, but he couldn’t help himself. Draco had snuck out of his room, creeping through the corridors – much to the amusement of the house elves dusting the vases – and into the parlour when he was sure his father wasn’t around. “Draco darling, is that you?” Narcissa called out as he peeked past the door.
“You like me Draco, you can’t deny that,” Harry teased.
’ mean?” he asked.
Draco smiled; it was a small smile, as if he had just witnessed a private joke occur. “Yes,” he said, his voice soft as a wool. “She wasn’t pleased about the idea, I think she blamed herself for my situation,” Draco explained, still rubbing his thumb over the delicate flowers as they swayed slightly, as if someone has blown upon them. “But she was the only person I wished to live for at the time,” he said, his face still.
your biggest flaw,” he said, rolling his eyes.
“Why give you a warning about him,” Sirius finished, bringing his hand up to his mouth as he began to think.
“I know the felling. It was good to see you Pott –
Harry glanced around them dramatically. “Unless the tree roots know of this reputation, you don’t need to worry,” he said, grinning. “And what reputation?”
As he reached the counter, Draco passed him a cup of tea. It was apple and cinnamon. Harry tried to suppress a smile, but he could feel it tug at the corners of his mouth.

have.” He turned away from Draco. “Why don’t you blame me?” he asked, facing the lake.
And if I’m honest, I didn’t tell you because I didn’t know if he was genuine but,” he couldn’t help the smile that crept onto his face.
“We’ll fail Potions together mate,” he confirmed with a nod and the two chuckled. Hermione looked mortified.
Draco stared at the words on the page. “How did you feel when, you were –
“Here,” a voice said, and Draco turned his head to see a red and gold scarf being offered his way. “You seem cold.”
“I thought you said you hadn’t baked in years?” Draco asked.
“He never did join in with the other Slytherins on the blood purity nonsense, did he?” Hermione asked, although it was more of a statement. “He was still unpleasant, but after Warrington...”
“Really?”
– it’s just – I mean,” Harry mumbled, rubbing his arm. “I’ll just go,” he said, turning to leave.
Until Malfoy cracked. “I thought the kiss would have made my reasons quite obvious Potter,” he sniffed, his face a light pink.
“Harry,” Draco interrupted, and Harry forced his mouth shut. “I’d have to be incredibly stupid for this to only be a fling, you know it would be incredibly
"Old habits die hard," he smirked.
“There are chasers,” Ron cut in. “They, well, they chase the quaffle, score points by throwing it through one of the three hoops. Then there’s the keeper who makes sure they don’t score points.”
Which was why Pansy was making her grand entrance into Draco’s apartment, thankfully whilst Scorpius was at Narcissa’s.
“I don’t – I don’t want to go into detail – I
Harry furrowed his eyebrows. “How can you tell?” he asked, glancing at the books. The only similarity he could make out was the author and the fact that they were about tea. “Is there even an order to them?”
Sirius’ face appeared above the shard. “Sorry about that, Buckbeak’s been quite,
/ˈkəʊdə/
“Thanks,” he said, his breath hitching in his throat slightly. He coughed. “So, when will you get busy?’ Harry asked, pouring himself some tea.
“Yes! Thank you,” Blaise drawled, throwing his arms back and resting his head on his hands.
He sighed, focusing his attention on Ron, who looked as if he wanted nothing more than to set himself on fire.
Andromeda was paler than the last time he’d seen her, with her dark brown curls appearing as if they were black. Though there was no need for concern; every winter she became paler from the lack of sunlight. Harry assumed it was a Black trait as not only was Teddy the same, but he had found photos of Sirius when he was younger and noticed he was a lot more tanned than when he had been living at Grimmauld Place. She still held herself with the grace of a Black too, something Harry found similar to the effortless elegance Draco had, and on occasion Sirius too.
Nodding, Harry untied his laces. “Well, I suppose I’d better take my shoes off then.”
“I’ll get it,” Lupin reassured, kissing Sirius on the cheek. Lupin rubbed the bridge of his nose as he climbed the stairs and a few moments later the yelling stopped.
“The Little Prince?” he asked, raising an eyebrow at Draco who chuckled.
“I know you said he’s different to his father, but,” Sirius whispered to Harry who smiled. “He is nothing like his father,” Sirius chuckled, shaking his head.
Draco’s lips parted. He wasn’t expecting Harry to ask him that. “I know he was your father’s best friend,” Draco said apprehensively, as if testing the waters for something. “And I – Harry I don’t know if you know this – he wasn’t the one to sell out your parents to the Dark – to
Glancing at Harry, Draco noticed his eyes were closed and his breathing even. He knew he should probably wake Harry, but he couldn’t find it within himself to do so.
“Well then what do you recommend? I know nothing about tea,” Harry grinned, changing the topic after noticing Malfoy’s odd reaction to mentioning his family. Harry had managed to glance at the long list of tea, and he recognised two.
Harry began to stumble over his words. “I – well, that was only once –“
“To meet your Godparents?” Draco smirked. “I had no idea we were that serious,” he teased, setting Harry off on a stream of stuttered words.
Harry nodded as if that was obvious. “Ah, of course, I see it now.”
“So, you’re a tea expert then?” Harry teased, grinning as Malfoy’s cheeks went pink.
clumsy, but I guess I’m lucky that
Remus smiled. “Your mother disliked your aunt quite a bit, I assumed there was a reason. I wanted to give you the happiest home I could.”
“I know we didn’t get on at school but –“
Harry froze, unable to respond with anything other than a nod. “Anyway, I’ll see you around,” he said quickly, reaching to open the door.
“He – he really said all that?” Harry asked, his face burning, and a wide grin plastered on his face.
“It’ll be fine,” Draco assured, and Harry took a deep breath.
Andromeda shook her head, and Narcissa looked torn between letting her continue and dragging Draco back to his room. “Muggles may not have magic, but that doesn’t mean that we are superior,” she explained. “They might say the same about the fact that we don’t have electricity or televisions.”
“Which was the first thing you taught me,” Harry said, coming to a sudden realisation.
As soon as Draco held the wand, he felt a wave of magic hit him, almost knocking him over. He turned the wand over in his hand and didn’t notice anything unusual until he heard Scoripus.
As the rest of the group started to argue – Harry hoped Hermione and Ron would be able to explain Draco’s arrival – Harry and Draco continued their own conversation. “Are you sure that what you saw was real? What if this is the plan I overheard? Then –“ Draco paused, and Harry saw the cogs turn in his brain. “How do we know it’s real?” he asked, his eyes searching Harry’s.
“I –“ Draco began, his throat constricting. “I really miss him,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper as his grip on Harry tightened. “There’s so much that I – that he never –“ he broke off, unable to finish.
“Ron, Ron Weasley,” the ginger haired boy said, watching Draco in what appeared to be distaste, or maybe it was curiosity, Draco couldn’t tell.
Ron glanced at Hermione; his eyebrows furrowed. “You’re far from fine Harry, even bloody Snape can tell somethings wrong,” Ron said, tired of asking the same question. It was true that Snape had been less vindictive for the past few days.
to be in Slytherin?” he asked softly.
to be in the action,” Lupin said, rolling his eyes. “But he’s been particularly restless since the safehouse,” he admitted, glancing at Andromeda. “It’s at twelve Grimmauld Place, Andie.”
Malfoy’s scowl deepened. “If you’re going to mock me Potter, I’d rather you leave.”
“Obviously,” Draco drawled, noticing Blaise had managed to grow taller since he had last seen him. His skin was also darker than when he had last seen him, like dark mahogany, and Draco was suddenly curious where Blaise had visited over the summer. “You?”
He rolled his eyes as the Howler floated by him, as if it was judging him, and he turned to pet Delphinus, who was perched on a nearby tree branch.
“So, what’s this about me being attractive?” Harry asked, unable to stop himself.
Hermione pursed her lips, looking as if she wanted to contradict him. “Will you be all right-"
“I’m not sure how it works, my parents won’t tell me, but I think it’s about what you value, not what you are. So, you can be brave and smart but not be in either of those houses,” Draco explained, and the boy nodded.
it?” he asked.
Harry felt as if Teddy wanted to say something, and he didn’t want to rush him or interrupt his thought process. “Can I –“ he began, his voice quiet as he looked anywhere other than directly at Harry. “Is it okay if I call you Dad?” Teddy asked, shuffling his feet.
When Draco mentioned that he wouldn’t mind going to pay for the books he had found, Harry insisted on paying for Draco’s books. “Potter, you don’t have to pay for my books,” he said, shaking his head, despite the smile pushing its way onto his face.
“Peppermint?” Harry exclaimed.
, what the fuck is going on?” Ginny asked again, looking at Malfoy in incredible distain, as if she wanted nothing more than for him to spontaneously combust as well as bewilderment.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Of course you don’t, I remember you used to put at least seven sugars in your tea at school,” he sniffed, and Harry felt his face warm.
Harry nodded. “Seems like it would have been easier, although, I’d have taken that less serious than Dobby.”
He was in
Draco nodded, and saw that Hermione looked just as uncomfortable as Harry did. He didn’t need to be a genius to figure out there was something the trio needed to discuss; the tension in the air was almost as thick as concrete. “I’ll just be –“ he gestured to the entrance of the library, grabbing his book off the table.
Harry shrugged. “It means there’s a chance,” he said, joining Malfoy in staring at the horizon.
feeling is understandable.”
“What’s the reasoning behind this tea?”
Harry groaned. Whilst he loved Molly dearly, she did fret about his being single as if it was the only thing that mattered. “What if I don’t want to date anyone?”
“You can flirt with Luna later, this is important,” Ron insisted, and Luna and Ginny both went pink as Neville glanced between the two, baffled.
“What a lovely place for a family reunion,” Draco said sarcastically, raising an eyebrow as something in the shack moved, releasing a puff of dust into the air.
That was all the incentive Scorpius needed apparently, as he darted out of the kitchen, excitedly chatting about his toy dragon collection. Harry had a feeling he was going to have the honour of meeting those dragons at some point today.
’ flirting, Harry packaged up Draco’s old wand. Draco was slightly sad to see it go, it had been his wand since he was eleven after all, but he was glad to be in a new chapter of his life; a life of healing; a life of hope.
Harry’s blush darkened. “Partially? I mean, it’s
I don’t think I properly introduced myself,” Draco exclaimed suddenly, glancing at the both of them. “My mother would have my head,” he muttered to himself. “I’m Draco Malfoy,” he grinned. “And it’s wonderful to meet you both.”
Suddenly overcome with hunger, Harry offered Draco a side-along apparation to a park that he swore sold the best cinnamon buns – the perfect snack before dinner. Draco laughed, and commented on how Harry’s solution to hunger seems to always be some form of pastry or cake. He wasn’t wrong.
“I’ve had that conversation one too many times,” Harry joked, running a hand through his hair as he glanced over at Draco, who was still watching him curiously.
Teddy scrunched up his face, deep in thought. “Will there be ice cream?”
Harry was silent for a moment. “I’m glad you’re here,” he sighed, and Draco felt his face go a deeper shade of pink as Harry leaned his head on Draco's shoulder.
“I knew they existed,” Draco chimed in. “But I didn’t know how to play.”
having people over for tea unless you know how to make it and how to drink it correctly,” Draco explained, placing yet another book back on the shelf. “I mean as a function of course, not purely a social event,” he said, and Harry nodded, despite being baffled by almost everything Draco had just said.
Draco smiled. “You know, I don’t actually know. Why don’t you ask Mr Potter when he appears?” he whispered back, booping Scorpius’ nose who giggled and nodded.
“I think we still have some,” Draco muttered, searching his shelves. “You’re in luck Potter,” he smiled, pulling a jar off the shelf. “You’re also lucky you’re here before we get busy, or I might have run out.”
After a moment, he shook his head slightly, pulling his thoughts together. “Yeah,” he said, his voice slightly strained. “Sorry, déjà vu,” he lied, smiling at the two Malfoys, who both shared similar looks of concern.
He wanted her to say that his house didn’t matter.
“But they want to,” Cedric explained, trying to help Draco understand. “You know, they personally sought me out to know if you were eating properly.” When Draco looked at Cedric, his eyebrows furrowed, Cedric chuckled. “I know it can be strange, but –
idea would be foolish,” he continued, sitting up straight. “
Andromeda glanced at Draco. “How long do you wish for me to stay?” she asked, and Draco blinked.
Narcissa looked pained. “You know you shouldn’t be here – “
“We need to talk,” Harry said, jump-scaring Malfoy who snapped his head in Harry’s direction, before his second of fear was replaced by a sneer.
tell you.”
“My father doesn’t know we’re friends,” Draco grinned, and Blaise laughed, shaking his head. “And he isn’t a Muggleborn,” he said. He knew for a fact Harry Potter was not a Muggleborn – everyone did.
“Draco…” Harry trailed off, unable to look at Draco without giggling.
“Master Draco,” he squeaked, and Draco sighed.
“T’es fou,” Draco muttered, laughing along as he joined Harry on the bench. “You’re not wrong though,” he added. Harry wondered if Draco had insulted him.
Harry could hazard a guess.
“Mr Harry, do you know much about dragons?” Scorpius asked, and Harry tried his best to suppress a chuckle at ‘
Ron sighed. “Harry, if you had said that then -"
Harry didn’t need to say much else, as Draco put the pieces together in his mind.
He held his breath, waiting for Sirius to respond. “
-----
Scorpius giggled. “You’re funny,” he said.
Draco complained, thwacking Harry on the arm. “But I suppose in
“Harry!” Mrs Weasley accosted, frowning at Harry’s use of language.
Harry grinned as the two Slytherin’s made a mental note to tease Draco later. “We won’t keep you from the Great Hall any longer Potter – we know that Gryffindor’s are sticklers about food,” Zabini said, glancing at Harry.
It was then, that Draco noticed the sunrise, turning the sky a soft green and yellow. “Morning,” Draco yawned, rubbing at his eyes.
Harry felt his stomach rumble and knew that if he were much later, Ron and Hermione would ask him an unjustifiable amount of questions. “Tell Draco I said hi,” he smiled, heading to the door.
It was where he would hide away from his own emotions. He would stare out the window, sit by the flames, and remember his mother, or wonder about her safety. There were times when he would sit and compose letters he wasn’t able to send, or imagine what he would say if she was to arrive at Grimmauld Place tomorrow. Sometimes Harry would join him, other times Harry recognised the need to deal with your emotions by yourself.
Andromeda rolled her eyes as Sirius grinned, joining him at the table. Lupin started making some tea. “Teenage rebellion,” Sirius nodded, chuckling as both Andromeda and Lupin threw him an exasperated look, but Draco was thrilled.
Harry felt a blush creep up the back of his neck and onto his face. “Sorry,” he said sheepishly, quickly averting his eyes to the books in front of him.
As they made eye contact, Harry nodded. “He is incredibly endearing.”
Malfoy didn’t even flinch. “Tell that to those chairs,” he said, gesturing to the splintered remains of a few of the chairs he had exploded. “Accidental magic is dangerous past childhood Potter, and after what you did in the classroom –“
Draco knew he must have missed something. “It’s all right,” Harry muttered. “But Draco mentioned it too, and Hagrid sort of explained it but he said he had never been too interested in it,” Harry explained, sitting up in his seat. “I know it’s a sport.”
Harry was replaying that memory in his head as the train pulled into the station. The volume on the platform went from a hum of chatter to a buzz of laughter and Harry was on the lookout for Teddy.
“No, nothing is wrong with your wand,” said Potter, fidgeting with some of the pillows.
“Merlin,” Harry said through a laugh. “I haven’t heard that nickname for years.”
“I’ve not a clue, neither do they,” Harry continued, leaning into Draco with a sigh. “Dumbledore’s plans aren’t brilliant, are they?” he asked, with a humourless chuckle. Draco hummed in agreement. “I’m not even mad at them –
“I’ll write to you, and you’ll visit me at Sirius'?” Harry asked pleadingly.
“Where will you be staying? Are you taking up the Order’s offer?” Harry asked, worried that Draco might have no where besides the Malfoy Manor to go.
He opened the door and was hit by the smell of tea and cinnamon. It was a pleasant combination, but the thoughts of relaxation were quickly interrupted when he saw a man with sky blue hair, similar to that of the man at the pond, behind the counter. He was tall, his features sharp, and the hair made the man seem ethereal, but Harry recognised the man almost instantly, and took a sharp intake of breath as they made eye contact.
“Better?” Harry asked, unable to keep the amused tone out of his voice.
He wanted her to tell him that his father was proud of him.
Teddy looked contemplative for a moment. “Does he like Quidditch?” he asked, his tone dead serious.
“It’s a tactical retreat,” Draco replied, picking up his small pile of cards. “And he didn’t, no,” he said, replying to Harry’s previous question.
“No, no, it’s fine, I guess I – I hadn’t really noticed,” he admitted. Hermione wasn’t wrong, he was happier. He still hated his job, but he enjoyed his visits to Draco’s teashop – he looked forward to them.
“Thanks,” Harry smiled, trying not to laugh. “I hope I win too if I’m honest, I rather enjoy living.” He grinned as Malfoy rolled his eyes.
“You’ll never be too old Teddy Bear,” Harry said, kissing Teddy’s forehead. He saw Teddy smiling to himself and couldn’t help but smile himself.
Piercing at his skin, flooding his eyes, taking his words from him.
With a small smile, Draco shook his head. “Such a man of words,” he joked, trying to lighten the mood a little. When Harry smiled at the comment, Draco sighed with relief. “Where to next?” he asked, and Harry relaxed his shoulders, looking relieved Draco didn’t push.
The trio almost fell out of their seats as the train started to move. Draco turned his head to the window to watch as the platform disappeared from sight. He grinned, finally letting the excitement flood his veins. He could hear Blaise and Pansy asking him questions, but they sounded distant compared to the buzzing in his ears.
“Yes well, we didn’t exactly lie, but that’s beside the point. Harry are you all right, what happened?” Hermione asked. “You just, collapsed and started, well, muttering,” she said, glancing at Ron who nodded to confirm the story.
They wandered through the back of the shop with Draco occasionally pausing to pick a book off the shelf and read the blurb. It was one of the few times Harry had seen Draco look entirely relaxed and care-free, unbothered by the world.
It was rather dreary, with the only light being from a few scattered candles – which, Draco assumed, were always lit to appease Buckbeak. There was a small layer of dust covering the floor and floating through the air. The room was filled with old portrait frames and odd objects, but the strangest part of the attic was the Hippogriff, who was unfazed by their presence, no matter how loud they got.
“O’course not you prat,” Harry said, a smile pulling at the corners of his mouth once more. “It’s just unusual when I come across people who don’t seem to have any idea who I am,” he admitted.
“He wanted to buy ten litres of love potion as well as a hundred single use invisibility cloaks,” Ron said.
“Anyway, how are you dear?” she asked, a warmth in her voice. It had never been intended, but after the war, Andromeda had become a motherly figure to Harry, like Molly had. Neither of them noticed it until Teddy asked why Harry didn’t call Andromeda ‘Mum’.
It was only when Malfoy began to speak again that he realised that’s exactly what he did say.
Draco let out a burst of laughter. “You did what?” he asked, amused. Scorpius was also intrigued.
It landed with a soft splash, but Draco’s screaming caused Harry to tense, freezing in place. His back straightened as if someone had tied a string to his spine and pulled it – hard. He looked ready to bolt it.
Harry had mentioned that he didn’t blame Ron and Hermione for how things transpired over the summer, but that didn’t mean that he was completely all right with them, as Draco had assumed.
” Sirius sighed. “They wanted –“ he paused, glancing at Draco and took a deep breath. “They wanted something of my brother,” he explained.
“I’m not sure,” Harry replied, hoping ‘
After a moment of silence as Harry looked at the wand, Draco said, “you’re acting strange.”
“14, almost 15,” Sirius replied, his sorrow turning into anger. “I was pissed, obviously, but Reggie told me he’d figure it out, like he always did,” Sirius’ face went blank. “I believed him, I thought he’d figure it out but, he didn’t,” Sirius trailed off, but Harry knew what that meant.
“Oh, sod off Ferret Face, I’m trying to be sentimental.”
Harry nodded. “Thank you,” he said, smiling at Draco. “Anyway, how are you? How was your summer?” he asked, as he shook his head. He then grinned at Draco, who couldn’t help but grin back.
“It does,” Draco replied.
“That’s why I’m here,” Harry grinned. “There’s only so many games of chess I can play with Ron.”
“Thank you,” Harry mumbled, smiling faintly at his Godfather.
“Well Mr Potter?” Snape said.
if you want to,” he emphasised. Whilst he did want them all the meet, he understood if it was a little too much for Teddy.
“And it was,”
It was only when he found the Draco constellation that his eyes began to sting. He pushed he palms of his hands into his eyes to try to stop himself from crying.
“You’re glowing!” he exclaimed, his book no longer more interesting than what was happening. “Like those Muggle street lights!” he added, making both Draco and Harry chuckle.
Shrugging, Harry tried to keep a straight face. “I’m a man of simple pleasures Draco,” he replied, the façade breaking for a moment as he laughed. He covered it with a cough.
“I’m Draco,” he grinned, sticking his hand out for Ron to shake.
“Anyway,” Ron continued. “I think it because of Percy last week,” he said, and Harry chuckled at the memory. “Not a clue what he thought he was doing really, we all know not to mess with Mum when she’s cooking, and you don’t tell her to change how she does it,” Ron groaned.
around to help,” Harry said, wagging a finger in Draco’s direction.
“And I saw some Nargles the other –“
“Alright,” he said, sitting up on the seat. “So, your wand suggests that, in the past, it looked to others like you had the capability to perform dark magic, but internally, you’d never be able to live with yourself if you did.” Draco was shocked at how accurate that was. “There was a time you had to pick between destruction and creation, and you didn’t know what to believe.” Draco opened his mouth to ask how this related to it not working. “If it doesn’t work for you anymore, it means you’re less unsure about yourself and you picked your path.”
Zabini laughed. “Well you’re right about that, his father is complete prick.”
“Daddy no! Auntie Pansy said you need to
Ron and Hermione had cast him bewildered looks at his cheery attitude at breakfast – so did half of Gryffindor, who had dealt with his sour mood all week. It seemed unexplainable, but Harry’s nerves about Sirius getting caught were rivalling his excitement at spending a day with Draco outside the Astronomy Tower. His eyes kept flickering to the Slytherin table, and when Ron caught his eye, he blushed slightly, smiling as Ron rolled his eyes, now understanding his behaviour.
you, I was awful,” Draco replied, as if trying to convince Potter of his misdeeds.
He bumped his shoulder to Harry’s, grabbing the boy’s attention. He raised an eyebrow at Harry who sighed, shaking his head a little.
Draco nodded again, his words seeming to fail him, and tried to levitate one of the cushions but could barely get it an inch off the seat. Potter watched curiously.
terms, yes.”
“That I’m feeling a little under the weather,” Draco said, earning a look from Pansy. “He’ll hex me you know,” Draco said, trying to find any other excuses but he had exhausted all of them.
Harry chuckled as they entered the corridor and waved enthusiastically as they went their separate ways – Draco brought a hand to his face to hide his blush.
“I had another dream, and you were at the Ministry, but Voldemort was torturing you and – I don’t want you to – I’m glad you’re alive,” he said breathlessly, trying to control his breathing.
Chuckling, Harry sipped the tea and his eyes went wide causing Malfoy to laugh.
Nodding, Scorpius grabbed Harry’s hand and began pulling him out of the kitchen. “His name is Ladon,” Scorpius began to explain, and Draco shot Harry an apologetic look, but Harry could see him suppress a laugh at Harry’s bemused expression, replacing it with a cough.
“I have it on good authority that I can be rather pleasant actually,” Draco sniffed.
Lupin picked up on this.
The figure nodded but stayed in the doorway. “I’m sorry –
“A cloak?” he asked.
However, as soon as Dumbledore’s Army was discovered, it became harder to meet with Draco, and Harry hated that their meetings were becoming less and less frequent. He knew that Draco missed him too, and that was why Draco had suggested some study sessions, so they’d be able to meet more frequently and not feel as guilty about it.
,” Harry said, moving his hands furiously as he spoke. “Because ‘
“I’m Harry,” the boy smiled.
Draco nodded. “
Potter looked up from the wand, placing it on the side before raising an eyebrow at Draco, “you haven’t seen me in almost eight years, what did you expect?”
he insisted, lifting his glasses to rub the bridge of his nose. “There’s just, a lot happening OK?” he said, a dull ache pressing at the back of his eyes.
’ before he died,” he explained, still holding Harry’s hand. “I could never love her the way I was expected to, and she knew that. Instead, she became my best friend,” he said, smiling weakly at Harry. “She helped me to see the reasons to continue existing, all the reasons why I deserve to be happy. She was the one who came up with the idea of starting a teashop you know.” Draco shivered; his eyes glazed over.
” she hissed, pulling on the sleeve of his robes. “That’s
“A tactical retreat?” Sirius asked, raising an eyebrow. Harry appeared to be biting back a laugh.
Harry shook his head. “I’ll admit, you’re a good seeker –“
Draco shrugged. “Not that directly but Andromeda is my Aunt which makes him my second cousin? I’m not too sure.”
“And you’re a prat,” Harry said back, a lazy grin on his face as he yawned.
Harry laughed, kissing Draco on the cheek and making his cheeks go rosy. “Let me know when you’re free ok?”
Remus turned his head, and noticed Harry, who apprehensively waved, forcing a smile. Remus waved back, a black dog sat by his heels, looking disgruntled. Harry bit back a chuckle at the sight, knowing that Remus had told Sirius not to react in a way that would draw attention to them.
“Hello Mr Harry!” Scorpius exclaimed, waving excitedly, bundled up as if it was December instead of September. Harry bit back a smile. “We came to see the ducks,” he explained, nodding seriously. “They get sad if you don’t visit regularly.”
“No, no,
anything if I did?” he returned, raising an eyebrow.
And so, when he saw a familiar head of sky-blue hair in the park walking towards him, he was certain he was imagining it; when he saw a familiar, platinum haired child holding his hand, he was still absolutely certain that it was purely coincidental.
Ron chuckled, “She’s right, Mum’ll be a nightmare, you know how she is.”
“It’ll be okay,” Cedric assured, as Draco wiped away his tears, feeling embarrassed to be crying in front of someone. “I can’t tell you how they will receive it, and I wish I could,” he said, before offering Draco a small smile. “But I can tell you that you will make friends in Hufflepuff, and that we’re a family outside of our families.”
you Pans, it might be a bit – “ He flinched as the box crashed onto the floor, thankful that there wasn’t anything too important or fragile in the box. “That’s never happened before,” he muttered to himself as Pansy sat up to look at him. Scorpius seemed rather unfazed.
The boy looked at him for a minute, examining him. Harry shifted, wondering if he’d said something he wasn’t supposed to say to a child. “I’m Scorpius,” the boy smiled, sticking out his hand.
However, every time he walked home; he found his eyes scanning the park for the two. He wasn’t sure why, he convinced himself it must be because he missed Teddy, but whenever his eyes wandered to the pond, he scolded himself, telling himself he was bordering on stalker behaviour. For the rest of the week, he didn’t see them by the pond.
“All right,” she said, returning her attention to Sirius. “It appears so.”
Harry wagged a finger in his direction. “More than others, don’t forget that part,” he said, his grin infectious.
“So is my dragon endearing?” Scorpius asked, beaming at Harry, who’s eyes flickered to Draco.

“I used to hate Samhain,” Draco began, pouring Harry a cup of the surprise tea of the day. “But then, the war happened,” he said darkly, starting intently at the cinnamon stick he had just placed in the teacup.
night, the usual,” he said, with complete sincerity, making Harry snort with laughter. “But yes, it’s been like living in a different reality,” Draco admitted.
Harry’s eyes widened as a blush flooded his face. “I – well – I’d like to – only if you want to! I suppose I haven’t really asked, but well – I’d really like to be in a relationship with you – I really like you, and spending time with you and –“
He also looked in the crowd for Harry and saw him clutching at the hem of his robes, glancing at the floor. He was able to – somehow – catch his attention and tilted his head slightly, as if to ask if he was okay. Harry shrugged, and Draco offered what he hoped was an encouraging smile and a small thumbs up. There was a moment of confusion that danced across his face, but then Harry returned the smile with a nod.
“Thank you,” Teddy mumbled, wiping his eyes on his sleeves, sniffling. Harry used
? Why do any of it? And why tell
,” Ron blurted. “Sorry Harry, I should have known you didn’t know anything about Quidditch,” he said, his ears turning red.
Scorpius’ eyes lit up. “Yes!” he exclaimed, darting from the room.
“What? I’m your Godfather, I’m curious.”
“Yes, yes, we’re very old, as you keep reminding me Beth,” she grinned. “Be thankful of your memory whilst you have it,” Hilda said to Harry, waving a finger at him.
“Fuck Dumbledore,” Remus said, shocking both Sirius and Harry.
Hermione had convinced him to talk to Sirius about the warning. She tried to convince him to talk about the Dursley’s too, especially as he wasn’t talking to either of them about the matter, but Harry refused and for the first time, neither Ron, nor Hermione pestered him until he complied.
“Not on purpose!” he insisted, rubbing the back of his neck. Draco laughed, not noticing he had leaned closer to Harry. “If it makes you feel better, I tolerate you more than others too,” he joked, cracking an embarrassed smile.
“I know for a
Draco chuckled. “It was probably the Howlers,” he replied, watching as Harry whipped his head around to look at Draco.
Draco felt the cushion of the window seat dip as they sat down and he peaked over his knees to see who was talking to him. They were older, but they didn’t seem to be as old the prefects. They had soft brown hair and a warm smile that meant that Draco didn’t want to tell them to go away.
“It’s nice to meet you Teddy,” Draco said, with a warm smile. “Harry has told me a lot about you.”
Harry couldn’t help but smile at the thought. Draco would lose his mind at the chaos of the Burrow.
He coughed as he inhaled the black smoke coming from the front of the train. It stung his eyes a little too. He shook his hands, taking a deep breath when the smoke when gone. His eyes flickered across the platform to see if he could see a head of black curls.
He missed Draco’s tea.
“But my Dad was the least idiotic,” Teddy clarified, and Harry nodded. He couldn’t argue with that.
Then, he lost another game and knew it was a fantasy to think about winning.
“He’ll be alone at some point. See if you can get him to elaborate his warning – if he heard anything else.” Sirius’ eyebrows furrowed, and it looked as if he was debating telling Harry something. “Have I ever told you about my brother?” he asked.
for work today Pansy, you’ll regret not going,” Draco smiled softly at his friend who shrugged in response.
Harry woke up, although rather reluctantly, the day after Samhain. Even though he wished he could have stayed with the Malfoys (and Draco had offered), he knew if he didn’t return to Grimmauld Place he would never have gone to work, and, for the first time in a while, he knew exactly what he wanted to do; he wanted to resign, to quit being an Auror
After taking another sip of tea, Harry asked, “so are you married?”
Before he could express any form of condolences, Draco continued. “It was an arranged marriage, one of the last things my father ‘
you should feel something if you place your hand close, like this,” Harry said, moving his hand over the neck of the stag.
That was undeniable.
Teddy’s mouth fell open. “But then people would notice right? Hagrid told me it went on for weeks,” he said, leaning on the handle of the trolly as Harry picked up fruit and veg to put in said trolly.
With a nod, Teddy linked his arm with Harry’s. “Let’s go!” he exclaimed, raising his arm, and pointing forwards. Harry chuckled, placing his free hand on Teddy’s arm to make sure he would be stable when they arrived.
Hermione shook her head at the two boys. “Honestly, you two are useless,” she muttered, pulling her wand from out of her robes. “
He heard Harry sigh. “I – I love Ron and Hermione, but they don’t really,” Harry groaned. “They don’t get it, and I don’t
Blaise scrunched up his nose. “You’re so nice sometimes,” he sighed, slinging an arm around Draco’s shoulders, making him jump. “And such a Hufflepuff,” he grinned, making Pansy cackle.
” he muttered, wiping at his eyes with his sleeves.
For the rest of the week, Harry was unable to contain his nerves. He was irritable and jumpy, concerned that Sirius was going to get caught and worried about Draco. He would snap at anyone that spoke a word to him, scaring them senseless and the Gryffindor’s quickly learned to avoid him as they waited for him to cool down. He was glad that Umbridge had been sick for the past view days, or else he would definitely not have been able to go to Hogsmeade.
“It’s a Malfoy family secret,” Scorpius replied, and Draco nodded along with him.
Harry shrugged. “Officially, about… thirty minutes?” he asked Draco.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows, trying to figure out the reasoning behind that decision. “Why –“
,” Draco said, grinning at Harry. “Is the seeker. They follow the golden snitch.”
“I’ve always known a lot about tea,” Malfoy admitted. “One of the benefits of growing up with a traditional family I suppose.” He sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose.
“That too,” he admitted, sighing.
, any deviations will be an automatic fail.”
Ron and Ginny continued to argue about Draco’s presence for the entire walk to the tower, and whilst Harry was glad Ron was sticking up for Draco, despite the fact he had never spoken to the Draco Harry knew, the fighting was infuriating. Harry clenched his fists tighter and tighter until…
Noticing Harry’s scowl, Draco stiffened and muttered an apology.
Draco rolled his eyes with a smile, leaning his head just on top of Harry’s. “
“I don’t know Pansy,” Draco said, biting back his laughter. “It – it could be a – a
Draco felt a tingle in his arm and snap his head up to meet Harry’s. Harry met his eyes for a moment before sighing. “No, not that one either.”
“Don’t worry about it,” Harry grinned, raising his hand to pat Draco’s head.
“It’s alright,” Draco assured her.
It wasn’t illegal to see a wizarding teashop which was also for Muggles, but it was highly unusual, and it peaked Harry’s interest. That and any shop with a pun for a name made Harry feel instantly welcomed. The outside of the teashop had a little garden, but it looked as if it was closed off, despite with the unusually warm weather, perhaps because it was almost October. However, the sign on the door clearly said the teashop was open, and Harry decided he was too curious to let this shop pass him by.
“Don’t worry, I won’t,” Harry grinned, feeling giddy.
His Patronus was one of the few connections he had with his father.
Draco sniffed and held his head high. “As it should be,” he nodded, a faint smile on his lips. He walked towards the Whomping Willow and glanced back at Harry who gestured for him to continue. “If you run my clothes Potter -"
Hermione chuckled. “I swear she listens to you more than Ron and me,” she joked, glancing over at Harry who shook his head with a smile. “How are you?” she asked, walking into the living room.
other people in my life,” Harry smiled, glancing at the stairs, hoping Rose and Hugo would run down to help him escape the situation.
Stumbling over his words for a response, Harry managed to say, “Thank you Scorpius,” before quickly trying to change the subject and failing, as Draco decided to join his son.
“Do you want to talk about it?” Draco edged closer to Harry, but didn’t touch him.
“Does that mean I’ll get to glow too,” he asked his eyes full of hope.
Snape headed over to Ron’s potion and sneered. “Ten points from Gryffindor Mr Weasley, it’s clear you never even read the instructions on the board,” Snape said, barely even glancing in Ron’s cauldron before emptying it – it was now Harry’s turn to stomp on Ron’s foot.
Sirius nodded enthusiastically. “We’ll meet you at the Hogs Head.”
Harry stared at him, mouth ajar. “And here you are saying
Harry’s smile widened into a grin and he began to laugh. “You’re insulting me,” Harry said once his laughter had died down, though Malfoy was looking at him as if he’d lost his grip on whatever sanity he had. “You almost had me worried,” he said, trying not to laugh again.
Harry grinned, and that was that. It was much easier than Harry had anticipated. It was possible Ron and Hermione were completely right and he was really overthinking it. “It can be, but sometimes it’s worth it,” he said, and Teddy raised an eyebrow at him. Harry chuckled. “Not everyone likes it. You know Uncle Charlie?”
Sirius stared at Draco for a moment before bursting into laughter. “Poppy is a terrifying woman,” Sirius said, more to himself than Draco. “I’m going to join the Weasley clan downstairs, are you going to stay here?” Sirius asked as he stood.
“Have you ever met a dragon?” he asked excitedly, and Harry almost choked on his tea.
,” she began. “The presence of other people is helping,” she said, although Draco noted that she didn’t seem to believe what she was saying.
“What did you tell him?” Harry asked, disgusted someone would even want to do that.
“I’m glad you asked Scorpius,” Harry said, enthusiastically clapping his hands together, making Scorpius stare at Harry, intrigued as to the answer. “You see, if I grow my own trees, then it’s easier to get wood for my wands,” he explained, Scorpius nodding long with every word. “Plus, it’s nicer than a regular shop, right?” he grinned, and Scorpius grinned back, turning to Draco, who was watching this exchange with a small smile.
, I need her here,” Draco croaked, biting the inside of his cheek to stop himself from crying. “
“You did?” Harry asked, brief flashes of a childhood with Remus flooding through his mind.
“Stop influencing my son Parkinson,” he said with a smirk as she rolled her eyes.
He picked up a stone and pushed himself off the ground.
Unsure of what to say, Harry blinked rapidly as his eyes stung. “Why would you want to adopt me now?”
Scorpius continued to explain the basic safety of baking a cake and Harry didn’t have the heart to tell him that at the age of twenty-nine, he did already know the basics of safety in the kitchen. Instead, he tried his hardest not to stare at Draco. It is, of course, completely normal to find your friend so exceedingly attractive that every time you glance at them, you feel as if your heart is about to beat out from within your chest.
“I cannot believe you set a
Scorpius looked between the dog and Malfoy. “It was nice to meet you Alexander, maybe we’ll see each other again,” he grinned, scratching behind the dog’s ears.

, the
“He did knock over a vase when he arrived,” Lupin said, grinning as Draco groaned.
“I don’t –“ Harry’s words died in his throat. Did he see it as being his fault?
The group half ran, half quick walked to the Gryffindor Tower, and the Portrait Lady reluctantly let Draco and Luna inside. Thankfully, the Common Room was empty and the eight of them clambered up the stairs to the Boy’s Dormitory.
“I’d say I’ll visit, but Madam Pomfrey won’t let me,” Draco said, with a small shrug and a smile.

“Hi Draco,” Cedric grinned, sitting near Draco in the common room.
“That’s exactly why Andie is angry about this,” Ted explained, his voice barely above a whisper as the voices in the kitchen died down a little.
“Why wouldn’t I? And don’t say what you’re going to say,” Harry added, seeing Draco open his mouth. “You’re easy to talk to and I like talking to you.”
A week after Harry’s last letter, he awoke, rather abruptly, to the sound of raised voices. He was somewhat thankful for the interruption of his dreams, as there were only so many times he could dream about Cedric dying before his eyes. He knew it was his aunt shouting, but he had no idea why, and the lingering thoughts of his nightmare still clung to him.
“Wow,” Scorpius said, his eyes fixed on the stag as it approached the small blond. “Can I pet him?” he asked excitedly.
“And I
“Eleven,” Harry said, removing the cloak.
“Promise?” Teddy asked.
Scorpius giggled. “No silly, he’s much too small.”
Draco scrunched his nose at the hats words, wondering if that was a good or a bad thing.
But Malfoy only said two words, one phrase, “
,” Teddy said, grabbing onto a trolly and pushing it along, jumping into the air to glide down the aisles of the store. “Anyway, Hagrid told me that Remus –
Harry sighed. “I’m trying not to, but I mean, it’s nothing compared to what’s happening to you.”
“Next step is the Minister of Magic then?” Harry teased. They all knew she had no interest getting involved with running the wizarding world, simply changing it.
“I’m sorry,” Draco said, with a sigh. “We haven’t spoken much since our first year.”
Tossing the stone in his hand, Draco watched as Harry examined the stone, squeezing it tightly.
When darkness began to spill into the apartment, the laughter turned melancholy as the time for remembrance drew closer, but as Draco left to gather the candles Scorpius grabbed Harry’s hand. “It’s okay if you get sad,” he assured, and Harry felt a strong urge to hug the small blond. “I get sad sometimes, but I’m glad we do it because I don’t want to forget my Mum.”
“Daddy, isn’t that cool!” Scoripus said, bouncing up and down with glee.
“When I was your age, maybe,” Sirius muttered. “And not if Remus was playing, no one can beat our Moony.”
“Of course not!” Harry grinned.
“I – well,
He watched as Draco bit back a laugh. “Harry, I’m known to be quite the reckless idiot now and then,” he smirked, and Harry groaned, remembering the Potion’s incident.
“You catch the snitch to end the game,” Ron said. “Usually, the team who catches the snitch wins the game, but it depends on how many goals were won by the chasers,” he explained, shuffling in his seat as the train went through a tunnel.
Draco’s eyes narrowed as he examined the empty space where Harry’s body had been. “But invisibility cloaks
“I think I know exactly what house you’ll be in too,” Draco said, grinning. The boy was a shoo-in for Gryffindor, he was sure. “I’m Draco by the way,” he said.

,” George said, placing a hand on Harry’s shoulder. “Teddy will see it as his family expanding.”
As Harry approached the Gryffindor Tower, he prayed Sirius had waited for an explanation. Either that or Remus forced him to wait for one, he didn’t mind either way.
“Coming from you, I
“You’ll scare the ducks – they’re just there, look,” he said, pointing to the far edge of the pond, where a small gathering of ducks quickly jumped into the water as they saw Scorpius, swimming toward him. “They like me,” Scorpius explained, giggling at the bemused expression on Harry’s face as he ran to meet the ducks.
,” he said, no longer supressing the smile.
“What about me? Did you miss me?” Scorpius asked excitedly, leaning across the table.
compared to the Muggle celebration, Halloween.” Draco shifted and was now sat on the sofa cross-legged, tilted slightly to look at Harry as he spoke. “Anyway, despite it still being rather morbid, I now understand the need for it.”
Draco furrowed his eyebrows. “Of course I did, why wouldn’t I?” he asked, watching Harry hug his knees to his chest, shrugging. “Did you find the platform okay?”
Lupin returned, muttering about blasting that portrait through the nine circles of hell. “Honestly Sirius, at least greet your cousin before you attack her,” Andromeda chastised, hitting Sirius around the back of the head.
By Wednesday, Hermione and Ron were concerned, and they cornered him in an empty classroom on their way to the Great Hall for lunch. “I’m fine,” Harry replied, without a second thought.
He nodded, not trusting his words and wandered to his usual sofa.
“I –“ Harry began, unable to continue as a blush crawled up his spine, flooding his face. “Alright, fine, I am a bit unobservant, but to be fair…” he trailed off, unable to think of a justification that would wipe the smug look off Draco’s face.
Harry snapped his head away from the door to look at Hermione. “I have not!” he exclaimed, feeling his anger levels rise as Ron agreed.
Harry was here for the same reason he was.
“Harry!” he exclaimed, seeing Pansy face palm in he corner of his eye.

Harry turned to his boyfriend who shrugged, a pink hue covering his face. “They’re interesting,” he mumbled.
“And one of the first things you did,” Draco began, his face turning pink as he realised. “Was –
Scorpius nodded, raising his head proudly. He looked like a mini Malfoy at that moment. “My Dad told me so, and I read all about it, they don’t understand why ducks exist,” he said, waiting with Harry.
“You, Draco, are a complete, and utter, tosspot,” Harry said, laughing as Draco scoffed and hit him with one of the sofa cushions, repeatedly. “Hey –

Draco turned on the tap, listening to the rush of water as he clutched the sink, his knuckles turning white.
And so, here he was, stood outside of Potter’s wand shop for the 5th time this week. Every day he had stood outside, mentally preparing himself to go in, and every day he talked himself out of it. He insisted however, that today was the day as he was going to enter the little shop.
“Why aren’t you in lesson? Is everything all right?” Sirius asked, definitely assuming the worst.
“You never seemed to really like it,” Andromeda commented, placing her teacup on the coffee table.
Pansy retaliated in a similar fashion, raising an eyebrow. “How, in the name of Merlin, is that a pawprint?” she asked, failing to contain her exasperation. As Draco opened his mouth to reply, she cut him off. “Actually, sod it, I don’t care, it’s a rabbit.”
Ron had apologised over and over.
“Did you –“ Harry began, unsure how to approach the subject. “Did you see much of your Dad before he…” Harry trailed off.
“Who will survive, what about life will change,” Harry elaborated, squeezing Draco’s hand.
going to figure out a way for you to not take the Dark Mark, no matter what.” Harry felt his face heat up as Draco grinned.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows. “You remembered,” he said, a smile pushing on to his face. “I may have only mentioned it once.”
Harry opened his mouth to reply, but Ron stamped on his foot and shook his head, waiting until Snape had passed on before leaning over to Harry. “It’s not worth it mate, you’ve already got months of detentions with Umbridge, we can’t have you missing DA” Ron whispered, shooting Harry a small smile. “If you could do it without getting a detention, I’d let you hex him,” he added, making Harry smile back. Ron was right, and so Harry held his tongue for the onslaught of comments Snape made, clearly trying to rile him up at this point.
“They’re witches?” Harry asked, surprised.
Harry grinned, remembering when Sirius had told him about what they’d gotten up to in Hogwarts. “Remus didn’t but Sirius did.”
“It was definitely something he wouldn’t have done without the potion,” Harry muttered, still thinking about the kiss, before remembering what it was, he actually wanted to talk to Ron and Hermione about. “I mean – he kept mentioning how he shouldn’t be talking to me, and it was the potions fault and then,” Harry paused, puzzled by Malfoy’s warning. “He told me that Kreacher is loyal to
“Mum, mum, can we get a Tellie Vision box,” Draco pleaded, glancing at his mother.
– it’s a peacock,” he said, refusing to look at Harry, who was grinning like a man who had won the lottery.
Rolling his eyes, Harry shrank into the sofa. “
“What!” Draco exclaimed, feeling the heat rise in his cheeks. “Don’t laugh at me you git, it’s a legitimate concern how many different coins they have,” he said, only making Harry laugh more. “And the
“Headache – stress,” Harry said, bouncing his hand on his leg as he stood up. He needed to go, right now.
He heard Draco scoff and turned his head to see a small smile on Draco’s face. “Show off,” Draco muttered, nudging Harry’s foot with his own.
“Are you alright?” she asked, concerned. Draco always had complete control over his magic, always.

“You two are brilliant – I don’t
“The time of your life, the best kiss you’ve ever had?” Draco supplied with an amused glint in his eye.
“That’s the issue,” Draco sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose. “They know
“You celebrate Samhain?” Harry asked. He knew that Molly had mentioned once that the Prewetts used to celebrate Samhain and she had spent twenty minutes explaining to the room that it’s pronounced ‘
“But –“
“I put two sugars in my tea Potter, that’s hardly the same,” Malfoy replied. “Seven sugars means that you are practically drinking milky sugar water,” he grimaced.
With a feeling tugging at his heart, Harry gently clasped Draco’s hand. “I hope you find there’s more worth living for now,” he said, smiling as best he could.
“I’ll leave you to get to your dormitory then,” Cedric said. “It’s getting late, and you’re probably exhausted.” As if on schedule, Draco yawned. “If you ever need to talk, or want a friend, just ask around for Cedric Diggory,” he said, placing a hand on Draco’s shoulder as he left.
you, they cannot expel him for protecting himself,” she told him, with a small smile. “He hasn’t broken the Statute, and the Ministry has no grounds upon which to expel him.”
“But it isn’t that bad,” Draco insisted. “Healers can fix pretty much everything. There’s even a spell to fix broken bones instantly,” he said, turning to face Harry.
“Would you like a cup of tea?” Draco asked, jolting Harry from his thoughts. As he’d been daydreaming, it seemed that Draco had boiled a kettle.
fucking pampered,” he said, glaring at Snape (who looked caught off-guard) as if he wanted the man to explode.
Harry shook his head with a laugh. “I’m not, I promise. It’s also said that they teach you to repent and forgive whilst helping you deal with your guilt and represent rebirth, like a Phoenix,” he said, as Draco stood, feeling as if someone was describing who he was and wanted to be. He wasn’t sure whether he wanted to kiss Harry or run right out the door.
“You think so?” Draco asked, unsure. He looked so vulnerable that Harry wanted nothing more than to give him a hug.
The grounds of Malfoy Manor were starting to decay as they did every year towards to end of August. The grass may have been green at the front of the Manor (the
“I know Dray, I know, but I made a complete fool of myself and I don’t think I can look her in the eye without spontaneously combusting,” she groaned, burying her face in one of the few unpacked pillows on the sofa.

in the same house as their family?” Ron asked, glancing between the two.
Harry chuckled, and Draco snapped his head back to Harry, blinking repeatedly as if that would change Harry’s smile. “Aren’t we cheerful?” he giggled, making Draco smile fondly. “
There were very few customers in the shop now, and as Harry went to pick up another teapot, Draco nudge him with his shoulder. “Thank you,” he said. “Don’t get me wrong, I love the teashop, but
In hindsight, it was a bad decision to stay, but it was what people expected from him. It seemed like the logical choice. He’d beaten Voldemort; he wasn’t too shabby at Defence Against the Dark Arts; if it weren’t for the fighting, the loud noises and the chaos, he might enjoy being an Auror. He liked talking to and helping people.
“I can’t imagine you called just to insult me,” he said, looking at Harry expectantly.
“Do you have any peppermint tea?” he asked, ignoring the ‘
a back to this place?” Draco asked, making Potter chuckle.
Chuckling, Draco moved his hand slightly, never letting go, and tangled their fingers together. “I do,” he smiled. “Astoria, she taught me that there’s more to this life then the mistakes we made, as long as we’re willing to change for the better,” he said, staring intently at the tattoo. “I can’t expect forgiveness from others, but I can strive for indifference.”
Draco flushed pink, taking a moment to reply. “The apple represents life and the five elements, rosemary is for remembrance, and,” Draco paused. “Cinnamon is for the home, for family,” he said, turning a darker shade of pink as he spoke.
“You’re both
Despite having already been in the shop once, Draco was still amazed by the forest. He saw Scorpius’ eyes widen as he looked around the shop in wonder before pulling on Draco’s sleeve to get his attention. Draco looked at his son curiously, who was now gesturing for him to get closer, so Draco knelt down beside him. Scorpius cupped his hands over Draco’s ear and whispered, “why are there trees in here?”
Draco shot up and grabbed Harry’s elbow. “
“Yes Father,” Draco replied, unsure what that meant.
“Well, as long as he isn’t our replacement,” Blaise joked, bumping shoulders with Draco who rolled his eyes.
there are some non-chronological elements to this fic from here onwards, but there is always a time stamp, so don't worry :)
immaculate.
,” he muttered, and the dragon curled up, as if falling asleep. He passed the toy back to his son who clutched Ladon close to his chest, smiling at his father.
“Well, that’s okay,” Draco said, smiling at the boy. “No one really knows before they go there, do they?” Draco then remembered that this boy might not know about the houses. “Wait, do you know about the houses?”
Teddy stuck his tongue out at Harry. “It’s a very important question,” he said. “Will I get ice cream?”
Draco chuckled, rubbing the back of his neck. “Dumbledore thought it would be safer,” Draco explained, noticing that the adults in the room were watching them with wide eyes. He pushed their expressions to the back of his mind.
The book was The Great Gatsby, and as soon as Draco saw it, his face split into a wide grin.
“Nothing, I just
There was a pause, where neither of them spoke, but they didn’t move either.
“And I’d fight for you but at the moment, that’s not possible,” Sirius said, sounding frustrated.
Harry nodded. “Ron and his family showed me how it works,” he said, glancing towards his companion.
, that’s because Dumbledore told them not to.”
going to miss the most, if they expelled me, was the Hogwarts treacle tart,” Harry admitted, smiling at the memory of it.

Lupin glanced at the clock behind him. “
Harry could see that this apartment was loved. He could see it in the collection of random Muggle items and objects bought from antique stores or from places they went on holiday. He could see it in the crayon drawings pinned to the walls and even from the shoe cupboard where shoes had been carelessly shoved away to make the place look tidy.
“How did you…?” Harry began, baffled.
“I might not be able to answer, but sure,” Sirius said, shifting in his seat to look at Draco.
“Couple of troublemakers if you ask me,” Ron grinned, tickling the two of them. Hermione watched the scene, smiling as if she could watch her family laugh until the last star in the universe exploded.
“You have to take off your shoes,” the blond nodded. He looked around and beckoned Harry to lean closer. “Dad
“Remove the cloak you prat,” Harry said, with a faint smile.
“That isn’t what I –“ he began, stopping when he saw Draco raise an eyebrow in a way that said ‘
They talked for a while after that. Harry bit back his laughter when Sirius complained about being cooped up inside but felt relieved when he heard that Remus visited often to keep him company.
Once they apparated back to the Malfoy apartment, Scorpius looked sad, as if he’d made a friend he would never see again. “Daddy, will we see Harry again? I liked him,” he asked, stifling a yawn as they cuddled on the sofa.
But eventually, he ran out of things to say.
“Well, you could have said,” Harry replied, a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth as he saw Draco roll his eyes yet again. “All right don’t get all grouchy,” he teased, connecting their lips again in a small kiss. “Happy now?”
“Wouldn’t dream of it Blaise,” Harry grinned. Blaise sighed as if it was painful to hear and Parkinson chuckled.
over here gets frustrated,” Remus said, nodding in Sirius’ direction. Sirius whined slightly, somehow managing to look offended in his dog form. “Did you come alone?” Remus asked, noticing a lack of Ron or Hermione.
Draco let out a sigh of relief too, and everyone in the room seemed to follow suit. “Could you take this mirror shard to him please Kreacher,” he asked, smiling as the house elf nodded and snapped his fingers to apparate.
As Harry realised what he did, he felt his heart flutter from his chest to his throat; a blush creeped upon his face, and he saw Draco had the same reaction. Before Harry could come up with a good excuse, or any excuse at all, Scorpius entered the room with a plate of un-iced cupcakes, and Harry had never been more relieved to see a child. “We forgot to make
“I retract my former statement,” Draco said, a small smirk tugging at his lips.
“Are you -?” Blaise began, only to be cut short by Draco.
She wandered back into the hospital wing, holding open the door for Draco, who quickly followed her before she could change her mind.
“You use it when describing a reason to be loved or liked,” Harry explained, and Scorpius made an ‘
Draco nodded his head, taking a breath. “I think so,” he replied, doing a mental tally of the contents of his trunk. “Yes, I’m ready,” he sighed.
be careful,” he said. “Anyway, did he ever tell you about the pranks? Hagrid didn’t have any details on them.”
“What’s that?” Draco asked, stepping forward as if that would give him more answers.
“Sirius?” Harry called out, his voice breaking as Draco handed the shard over to him. “You’re all right? You’re really, all right?” he asked, needing to hear his godfather say it. He could just about hear the rest of the group muttering in the corner as Draco left the bed to give the two a moment.

Is so much more difficult than it needs to be,” he added, making Harry bite back his laughter.
“Neither of you will fail Potions,” she shook her head. “I’ll force you to revise until you pass.”
“How about we play a game? that counts as rest,” he smiled.
The two spoke about their memories of Cedric, about who he was – though Harry had but a few. Draco explained how Cedric had become a brother to him. Harry explained, albeit briefly, the night at the graveyard. Draco told Harry that it was okay not to be okay and Harry asked Draco if he had taken time to grief himself yet.
It was as if his own thoughts were poisonous.
“How did it go?” Draco asked, brushing his fingers through Harry’s hair.
Malfoy was still tense, but his eyes looked less as if he was ready to attack Harry, and more as if he was trying to understand the situation. He sighed. “Look Potter, there’s a lot of bad blood between us and I –“
This made him smile, despite himself.
Malfoy’s expression returned to its usual bored demeanour. “I guess if it stops you from killing someone,” he shrugged, closing the door as he stepped into the room.
be intruding, I’d want –
you,” he groaned. “If I’d have known he’d take it as far as he did, I’d have just sent a letter.”
Blaise raised an eyebrow. “I think Draco’s idea is stupid –“

“Sirius!” he groaned, feeling the most embarrassed he’d ever felt.
“She did,” Harry grinned, standing to leave.
Pansy told him he was being dramatic, but Draco was inclined to agree. So, instead, they were lying on the grass, feeling the warmth of the earth, cloud gazing.
“And I’m not!” Harry insisted, despite laughing. Composing himself, Harry smiled at Draco. “I think it suits you actually,” he said.
Harry reminded Teddy to change his hair from bubble-gum pink to a dark brown as they walked into Muggle London. It was much easier to go unnoticed by Muggles and apparate home without brightly coloured hair.
“Yes?” Draco replied, shifting in his seat. He thought everyone was able to feel magic. “In the same way you can feel the music when you put your hand against the shell of a grand piano whilst someone plays,” he continued, and Sirius looked as if someone had just announced the Beatles were getting back together.
Harry chuckled. “It’s probably because they don’t know magic exists,” he theorised with a shrug.
This very idea forced Pansy to sit up. “That’s it,” she declared, slamming her hands on the grass. “Blaise, you’d better watch out, or
,” Draco said, gently shoving Harry with his shoulder. “Surely your Godfather told you this?” he asked, unsure of himself, but Harry saw him relax when he chuckled.
idea was much better,” she boasted, straightening the creases in her robes.
“That’s so cool,” Harry said, breathlessly. “Do people get hurt?” he asked, and it was a reasonable question.
Harry groaned. “Queen of Spades then,” he said, staring at Draco, who smiled lazily.
The platform was lit by the golden hue of the setting sun, illuminating the faces of waiting parents and family, and obscuring the clock from view ever so slightly as the sunbeams hit the glass. There was a faint hum of chatter as people spoke about their Christmas plans, as well as about how they wish the train would arrive quicker as they had places to be. The train was due to arrive any minute and Harry was glad for the warmth and beauty of the sun; it was helping him keep his nerves at bay. This would be the first time in over six years that Teddy would be staying with him at Grimmauld Place.
“Harry, no!” Scorpius giggled, shaking his head as Harry pretended to not know how to whisk cake batter. “That’s not how you do it,” he said, looking at his father as if he was exasperated. Draco brought a hand up to his lips to hide a smile, but it was clear that he wanted to laugh at Harry’s antics. “Here,
Harry felt the guilt pool in his stomach. “I don’t– not really,” he said, bringing his thumb to his mouth, chewing on his fingernail. “Maybe if we were still fifteen, but not now.”
“I’m sorry mate, I really am,” Ron had said as he was shrinking the few items on his desk. Harry smiled faintly, despite the small pit in his stomach. “But I can’t – it was all right in training, but the field is, it’s too much like – like the war.”
“I haven’t baked for years,” Harry reminisced.
“Thanks,” he said, his voice cracking. His throat felt sore.
Just then Madam Malkin told Draco that his robes were done. “It was nice to meet you Harry, I need to meet Mother – she promised to take me to Quality Quidditch supplies after this,” Draco rambled on, not noticing Harry’s perplexed look. “I’ll see you at Hogwarts,” he waved, heading towards to door.

Hermione glanced at Harry, scanning his expression. Her eyes widened. “You mean You-Know –
Ginny’s eyes, as well as Neville's, had widened at Draco’s polite tone because it was directed towards a house elf. Harry could see that Ron and Hermione tried to act unsurprised but they both failed miserably. Luna caught Harry’s attention as she smiled dreamily at the two of them, grinning as she made eye contact with Harry – she was the only one besides Harry who was unsurprised that Draco was not an arsehole.
The room filled with silence again, and Harry sighed. “It’s –
“Very much so,” Draco smirked, but it faltered. “Harry I -" he paused, his words failing him. “I need you to know something,” he said, avoiding Harry’s concerned looks. “I avoided talking about this because I didn’t know if – and now I – I
Ron and Hermione always picked up on his chipper mood, smiling with him. It made a change to see Harry smile so effortlessly and it usually happened after a meeting with Draco. This was the only other time they saw Harry relaxed, the other time was when he was at the Burrow. Occasionally, when there was no one else in the common room, Ron or Hermione would ask about Draco and Harry would grin, replying with a simple, “good,” before returning to his studies or the game of exploding snap.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “What are you smirking at Potter?” he asked.
“Merlin Harry, I thought I had a sweet tooth,” he smirked at Harry, raising an eyebrow.
“First, they move my trial forward an hour, without telling me,” Harry listed, as he tapped his foot, scowling at the ground as if it had swallowed a beloved pet. “Then –
“Bless you ‘Mione,” Ron smiled, placing a hand on her shoulder.
the hat continued.
“Very capable. That’s why I had to stop you from tripping down the stairs last week,” Draco said.
“I also missed you Scorp’,” Harry smiled, ruffling the blond’s hair. Scorpius giggled. “Did you and your Dad do anything exciting without me?” he asked, already knowing the answer.
Remus will have seen the article.
“If I say that Remus, I think we’ll both feel old,” she laughed. “
“Samhain,” Draco replied, setting the water to boil.
by now,” he joked.
“How’s the unemployed life treating you,” George asked, lifting his feet up as Dominique and Louis ran past him, closely followed by Victoire.
The aisles were rather narrow, just wide enough for two people to pass by each other, but not for two people to stand side by side. Books were stacked high, on shelves as well as simply stacked on a table. It was a wonder to Harry how anyone would find anything in here; it was as if they were ordered in a code known only by a few.
it continued, seeming to pause for thought. Draco shuffled on the seat. ‘
Realisation hit him. “Oh,” Harry said. “Yeah… I – is, is being Slytherin
Deciding to write the letter to Andromeda before he forgot, he asked if she would like to meet for a cup of tea. He sent Teddy’s letter with Genevieve and his own owl, Cyrus, with Andromeda’s.
“It’s kinda funny that it’s made of pine wood actually,” he said. “Pine trees symbolise reaching for the stars,” he grinned as Draco looked at him with scepticism.
They sat for a while, watching as the sunlight dwindled from the sky, flickering across the lake, dancing with the ripples caused by the wind. Harry’s fingers were getting colder, and Draco’s cheeks were bright red, but neither of them wanted to face what was inside Hogwarts.
As Scorpius was trying his best to pet the stag, Draco began to laugh. “I can’t believe your Patronus is still a stag,” he said, and Harry shrugged.
For Draco, however, it could put him in danger.
“No one’s forcing you –“
“Cake!” Scorpius exclaimed with a grin, as Draco chuckled, sitting next to his son.
someone,” he said. Ron opened his mouth to reply. “He’s a friend Ron,” Harry said pointedly, and Ron sighed, leaning into the sofa as Hermione chuckled.
“I don’t want to be a burden,” Draco mumbled.
Harry hummed in contemplation. “
me?” he squeaked, a blush creeping onto his face.
“I don’t want them to be burdened by me,” he mumbled, burying the side of his face in his knees. “They have to deal with so much and, I’m sure I can spend a few more years with the Dursley’s.”
“You’d rather take it out on me then?” Malfoy asked, raising his eyebrow even further. “Potter, did you not hear me when I said I don’t – “
Sirius’ expression darkened slightly. “Harry -” he began.
Harry grinned. “Remind me not to get on her bad side,” he chuckled.
Panic entered Harry’s eyes as he shook his head again, “no, no, she’s lovely but she’s like a sister so it’s strange to think about.”
it looks like a paintbrush,” she said, through gritted teeth.
Draco took a deep breath before he replied. “I used to be.”
“I know what dinner is you prat, I just meant,” he paused. “Are you asking me on a date?” he asked, partially wanting to tease him but also curious at to if he had misread the conversation.
tell Granger and Weasley, if you thought they’d be OK with it.”
“That’s exactly my intention,” Harry grinned, taking another sip of tea as Malfoy aimed for his shins and missed. “Have you made any decisions on what colour you’re going to dye your hair next?”
“She visits quite regularly,” Malfoy explained. “And
“And especially after Christmas...” Ron finished, smirking at Harry who felt his face heat.
allowed to leave,” Malfoy said, staring at Harry, trying to discern why Harry was in the teashop he worked at.
“Obviously,” Draco muttered, once again taking a long sip from his teacup.
“My father’s in Azkaban, Voldemort is probably after the Malfoy family’s blood, I’m dating his number one enemy,” Draco frowned, and Harry was worried he regretted his choices. “But I wouldn’t change it. Fuck Voldemort,” he said, laughing. “Fuck Voldemort,” he laughed, speaking louder this time.
