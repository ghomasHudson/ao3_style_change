“Everything!” Kenny laughed. “You have very broad tastes, of course, so that’s one thing…”
“I have heard you talk on the phone several times now,” Draco said, after. “I think I can probably do it too, if you do all the button stuff for me the first time.”
“Shit, I’m sorry. Do you even know what pizza is?” Harry was asking.
He wanted to argue more with Harry Potter, he thought, and the opportunity would arise. Every Tuesday, apparently, because Harry had to give up something called Tae Kwon Do class on Tuesdays because it was still too strenuous for his body.
People were walking by on the sea promenade six floors below, and now, in early May, they were no longer hurrying to get where they were going as fast as possible, as they had all through winter, but instead seemed to take their time and just enjoying the day.
Draco was good at convincing people, and it felt both annoying and strangely good to run his words into the human wall that was Harry right now. Annoying because he knew he was right, there had to be a better solution, and this was undignified, and how on earth couldn’t Harry see that? Good because… he couldn’t quite put his finger on it. It felt safer, somehow, to argue out something with someone who didn’t seem affected by Draco’s passions, but at the same time, wasn’t that part of the annoying thing too, how unaffected Harry seemed by the whole thing?
The display said Pansy, in big pixelated letters, as her number was already in his phone, saved there after Hermione texted it to him. He knew how to do that now, didn’t need help from anyone. He picked up, careful to hit the green button just right.
The next two chapters will be speed running through the first two years of recovery, with a heavy sprinkling of discovering muggle culture. And then, to the meat of the story.
“I know that! Of course I know that. But muggle technology doesn’t work in the magical world, the magic is too strong, it interferes and destroys electrical things!”
He found he enjoyed most of the magasines Mary had brought him. There were ones about muggle celebrities and royalty which provided helpful insight into muggle culture – muggles were quite mad, true, but in quite a different way than he had expected. Then there was a magasine that was all about muggle science, which he read small stretches at a time. There were magasines dedicated to music, cooking, and various other specialties, and he was excited to read them all. Everything he learned might help him survive, of course, every exposed piece of ignorance was dangerous, but also, he had been starved for entertainment, and it was lovely to finally have some, even if it was only in small doses.
“I was dying.”
“Yes, I’m nearly halfway through recovery, and of course life is getting better the better I get, so that’s… good. I’ve been outside several times, too!”
The choice of Hastings made a lot more sense now, he supposed. No wizards here since the Norman conquest. There was unlikely to be any magical items around, and certainly no magical people or creatures.
“They originally just asked her to break off the engagement, and be open to one or other of the men who would then show an interest, but she wouldn’t. She threw an enormous tantrum, and then THEY broke off the engagement for her. A bit of a scandal, that, I mean, you’re supposed to do it yourself, even if the parents are the ones making the decision, or insisting on breaking the engagement. She absolutely refused, though. She can be quite stubborn. My mother was livid with her parents. She actually didn’t serve them dessert, can you imagine?” He smiled fondly.
“Oh, that’s lovely to hear, I’m so happy for you.”
Kenny was good at cooking. His grandma had taught him, Harry said. She was now in a home, with dementia. Then he had to explain to a horrified Draco what he meant with ‘a home’, and as much respect as Draco had learned to have for muggle culture, this one he just couldn’t stomach. No, he didn’t buy it – it could hardly be impossible to care for their elders in a better way, could it, even if they didn’t have the guarding spells and tracking spells that one had to use on small children and sometimes elderly people whose mind was going? Surely their last years should be spent in their home. And don’t get him started on ‘a home’, who in their right mind would call…
“You’ve got it, mate. More? Any morning traditions?”
He shook the morose thought off as well as he could and walked over to the sofa. The living room was lit only by the moon, looking so different than it used to. He picked up an old copy of Rolling Stone that he had read every little piece of already, and lit a small reading lamp on the side of the sofa. He read what Bruce Dickinson had to say in the big interview, trying to make his thoughts go there instead. But the thought was lodged there, stubbornly insistent. He could not quite distract himself from it. He had gone through something no one else could ever understand. He would need to find a way to live with that.
So, yes. The connection back home is established. And Hermione is out for (pure) blood.
“No wonder you… oh, there’s Hermione ringing us, then. I’m putting her on loudspeaker.”
Mary told him that she had not been allowed to open it, so obviously she didn’t know what was in it, but that it was for him to look at when he was well enough. She thought he was probably well enough now that he could read a little, but added that “if it’s too hard, just save it for later. If it could wait this long, it can wait a little longer.” It did not feel like it could, though, not at all.
“That went rather well, didn’t it?”
The look of horror on Harry’s face probably matched his own. The excitement he felt, at the technology to communicate with people back home being available, was pushed down, hard, by the terrible knowledge that there wasn’t any way to let them know about it. He felt horrified that there was a way and he hadn’t known about it, and that they hadn’t known about it, and that he couldn’t see a way to create the connection now that he did.
“Sorry, tart is used a bit more positively in my circles than in general, umh. Anyway, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with liking a lot of music. It’s very unprejudiced, actually, which I appreciate.”
Harry’s laughter was fond, loving. Only been in muggle shops to browse – no pureblood Draco knew has ever gone to a muggle shop to browse. Ronald Weasley was a lot more adventurous than Draco. Of course, these days Draco wanted to experience the muggle shops for himself, but before living here, it had never even occurred to him, not even as a lark. He supposes Weasley might have been dragged there by his muggle-raised and his muggle-born best friends, but that was still fairly adventurous in Draco’s book. Draco laughed with Harry, finding a trickle of fondness in himself for Harry’s friend.
Huge? Posh? New? Draco schooled his face. It would not do to look shocked at this information, so he tried very hard not to. So much for the idea that he knew what muggles lived like now. Apparently he still had no idea.
“I guess, yeah. We know where people are sorted, I s’pose. Sometimes it still doesn’t make sense, though. Like Peter Pettigrew, you know the shitstain of a man who betrayed my parents, being in Gryffindor. I keep wondering how that could have happened.”
What had he even been doing in 1994? Been in third year? Played quidditch? Been mauled by a wild animal that the crazy Magical Creatures teacher had been allowed to have them play with? His father was trying to bring back Voldemort, of course, but he hadn’t brought Draco into that. Draco hadn’t been a nice child, but in that, at least, he had been innocent. “But you see, it’s not me, it’s not my family – ” - but it had been his family. His mother must have known too, or suspected, at the very least, pushed away suspicion. If his parents had made different choices, the entire war might have twisted and turned differently.
“They married her off to Marcus Flint when Draco got too sick. Against her will, Hermione.”
“You were pretty brave to defy Voldemort and not kill Dumbledore.”
“It’s only pretentious if you are pretending,” Draco pointed out primly. “And I am not. I have lots of thoughts about muggle technology and the role of science fiction, and I haven’t had anyone to talk to about it, obviously, and I thought you might be interested, because you belong to both worlds, and…”
“That’s the plan, then. Any other birthday wishes?”
“Sure, that sounds like a good solution. Do it – call this man, and we will hear whether he thinks that might work.”
Draco just nodded. And just like Kenny predicted, he was fast asleep in minutes, no pill needed.
Explaining that a beard marked not just a life phase, but was a claim to magical mastery was out of the question, of course. Even if it hadn’t been for the statute of secrecy, just wrapping words around the concept was hard enough. One just knew these things: only a really remarkable wizard would grown one in his sixties, just like only a truly remarkable witch would start wearing her hair in a bun at that age. It was just obvious, wasn’t it? Experience needed to be collected at the appropriate speed. Gravitas took time.
“Sure, maybe. I forgot you must have known him.”
He mostly listened to whole albums, not songs, but there were exceptions. A song called Zombie got him thinking so much about the war that he only played it when Mary left the house, and then on repeat. It was beautiful, but disharmonious, a woman singing about the war, howling grief in a way Draco couldn’t. He even wondered if Dolores o’Riordan was secretly a witch, if it was that war – but no, it was just a bit too early, released in 1994.
“…gave me a lot of time to think. And if that is a clichee, then that must be because it has been true for a lot of people. But I think that both the experience of nearly dying, and that of recovering so slowly, well. It is very unpleasant, obviously. It’s not something I would wish on anyone. But it’s an opportunity too, for a certain type of growth.”
This was when Mary brought him the folder. He couldn’t have said what it was about the smell of it, exactly, but it smelled right somehow, it smelled of home. It must be what the Healer said he would leave him – “everything he needed to know,” he vaguely recalled the man saying. Well, that was still an enticing promise, even after nearly a year awake – after all this time he still needed to know a whole lot. He hoped there would be some sort of guide to living with muggles without breaking the statute of secrecy. That was still his main challenge – what could he say, what would mark him as an outsider, a wizard? .
As it turned out, the flower shop also had some fancy chocolates, including something that sounded like the ones Mary liked, so Harry ordered a big box of those as well as the bouquet – “the nicest thing you could fit into a hospital vase, with lots of yellow roses”, Harry instructed them. Draco figured the amendment and constrains on his wishes made enough sense that he shouldn’t make a fuss.
Blink. Blink.
Muggle politics – he might understand it one day and he might not. He was in no hurry, he had years of muggle newspapers ahead of him. For once he felt content at the thought of all the time ahead before he could go home. His veranda chair was nearly as comfortable as the one in the living room, and it was a lovely day. He was wearing a woolen blanket over his pajama legs, and another over his shoulders, and his dressing gown was quite warm, so he was perfectly comfortable out here.
“I have apologised to you, but I have not apologised to Hermione. I will need to do that once I come back to the wizarding world. And I owe apologies to many other people too. I know it’s not the only thing I have to do, but it’s somewhere to start that feels right. What do you think?”
Harry kept coming over every Tuesday. If Kenny was there, he would join them in conversation between doing other things around the house. Harry and Kenny were friends, of course, but clearly Kenny also understood that Draco and Harry wanted time to talk about their own things too. Draco sometimes wondered what Kenny imagined those things to be – certainly not a magical world they both secretly belonged to, a parallel society that Kenny knew nothing about. Draco and Harry would sit on the veranda, or in the outer living room, and talk about the similarities and differences between muggle and wizarding culture.
In another case, a dutch woman had fallen ill, and was being nursed, away from everyone, by her devoted husband, who had taken great care to use no magic at all in her care. He still noticed her getting slowly worse, though, and after two years he gave her care over to a muggle neighbor and left, thus saving her life. She was the only one of the five to survive.
His bed turned out to be a muggle machine. It could lift his upper body up to a semi-sitting, semi-reclining position, which was useful. It had what Mary called a remote control, which did exactly what it sounded like: It remotely controlled the bed. A little machine that controlled other machines – it was so muggle-like it sounded almost like parody, but here he was, finding it far too helpful to really be amused. The remote control had buttons for the bed, buttons for controlling the light in the room, and a big, red one for calling Mary.
“What the fuck,” Harry whispered. “What the utter FUCK.”
So, the outside scene is fairly direct lived experience, and this is just to say that going 	outside after years of no access to that at all is an even more intense experience than I am 	able to describe here. Just seeing so many faces. Just driving by a flower. It’s extremely 	intense.
“And YOU can kindly shut your mouth, Granger, I do not need your input. How dare you! You come into my house and insult my husband, and you –”
“I’m not, well, not exactly. I can learn, though. And it’s certainly nice not to be that afraid. Though I still have to uphold the statute, and I do. It’s hard sometimes, but it’s easier now that I have Harrry. He’s my interpreter and guide, and he’s explained more of the muggle world in the last few months than I have figured out in two years myself.”
“I know I brought it up, and I’m sorry, but I don’t want to talk about it anymore. How about, um. Let’s… make more tea.”
“I never thought about that, but I think you’re right. Except I also think both opera and country are bloody horrid. Not that I have been saying that thing myself, I have plenty of genres I don’t care for, personally. Besides, it used to be hip-hop and country, I think.”
Harry got her to to promise to text Kenny about any updates, and in return he promised to get Draco a phone and teach him how to use it.
Mary had asked if he liked classical music, and he had said yes – that sounded like a safe thing to say, he supposed, something that most people would like. It turned out to be nothing like wizarding music at all. Nobody sang anything, for one thing, and there was so much feeling he was overwhelmed at first. Mary said it was probably good music for resting, she’d read that somewhere, at least. He could not understand why that would be, he never felt quite at rest with the music, he just felt intensely alive, but still, rest it was. He still spent a lot of time laying flat with his eyes closed, and if Johan Sebastian Bach could make him feel like this, well, that made his life a lot more tolerable.
Blink. That didn’t really make things better, but he supposes it makes sense.
Draco had just nodded mutely. All of his breath and tears and words had left him, and now he was just empty. Harry had placed a cup of tea in his hands, with milk and honey, which wasn’t how Draco took his tea, normally, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. A wrong cup of tea was better than no cup of tea. Now he was at the bottom of it, and had eaten five biscuits and a small chocolate bar, besides, that Harry had somehow found in the kitchen.
“Pansy,” he croaked. “And Greg too, but oh, Pansy. My mother will certainly owl her, though, to let her know I’m okay.”
He moved his arms and neck around a bit just to prove to himself that he could, now, he could, and then his legs. Then he got out of bed entirely. It was still dark, but he found his walker. Normally he would take his wheelchair, but he wanted to show himself that he could actually walk now, even if he needed something to support himself with, wanted to show himself that the nightmare was over, the worst of it. He had to sit on it to open the door to veranda, and then just sat there on the seat of his walker in the doorway. The sea was quiet, and there was a waning moon. He could hear someone drunkenly shouting and laughing in the distance. Other than that the night was silent.
“I suppose it is easier for me than it is for him,” he heard Pansy say. “I have a good marriage, and Draco has, well, a life among muggles. No offense, Hermione, but it will limit him, you know? He won’t be able to find a wife until he comes back, even though Narcissa will do her very best in setting up a good situation to start his search from. And Draco and I – we were so sure of each other that he never had any backup plan – why would he, right? It was always meant to be the two of us. We got engaged when we were five, you know. That’s all lost to him now.”
“Yes, thirteen more years, is it not? Well, as you know, politics is more than what happens in the Wizengamot. I will tell you about some more of that later, after the Goyle soiree on Samhain. It may all come to nothing yet. And I understand that this phone gives us rather unlimited access to having conversations.”
He wanted inclusion, he decided, and potentially he was vain enough to also want to be desired. That was only natural after all this illness. Nevermind, he would meet men, later, when the time was right. And in the meantime, he would make sure Kenny knew for sure he wasn’t straight, so it looked less strange when he inevitably had to make sure Harry knew. Unless Hermione would do it for him. That seemed likely, somehow, but he couldn’t quite put his finger on why.
“How nice for you, these excursions. I had to read up on the history of the place, so I knew there was a castle, but I haven’t much idea what it is like there now, except that there is, of course, a muggle town of some sort. I don’t suppose the castle is very relevant anymore, defense-wise.”
He woke up on his own accord, thankfully. The clock showed quarter past five in the afternoon, and he felt intensely hungry – oh, because he hadn’t had any lunch, just biscuits and a chocolate bar. It took a few seconds for reality to fall into place: Mary in the hospital, Harry Potter in his living room (and when had he started thinking of him as Harry? He really had gotten used to muggle customs – normally he would have known someone a lot better before they became a first name in his head). He pushed himself out of bed, used his walker to get to the loo, and then got into his wheelchair.
“And to show that they have a large area of acceptable music, they still need to have something to mark the boundaries, something to exclude. What would happen if someone said they liked everything? I am willing to bet it would seem like they had no taste at all. Liking everything would send a message of no discernment. But somehow finding a way of marking the boundaries negates that.” He knew how that worked, the necessity of excluding something to place something else as acceptable. He’d thought about it a lot since coming to the muggle world. Kenny looked flabbergasted, though.
But then everything changed.
This conversation is also why this chapter took so long to write. The next three or four chapters are basically finished, but this one was difficult af. I wish it was better, but it is what it is.
The thing was – the thing was, he didn’t know any of it, not really. People were their habits, to some degree, of course they were, but they were more, too. Everyone could surprise, everyone. He didn’t know what she would have said, not really, and he had to accept that. He told Mary as much, adding that he was telling her that because she generally seemed to take pleasure in that kind of thinking, though wasn’t the implication that he could easily be wrong about that to? She laughed, clearly still taking pleasure in it still. “You’re the best birthday gift,” he told her.
Conditional love, what an ugly thing to bring a child. And he had still been a child, he could see that now, although at the time he had thought about himself as a freshly minted adult. No, anyone who had tried to tell him at seventeen that he was a child would have received his deepest disdain, but he had been, and his father should have seen that.
While these cases were anecdotal, the article stressed, they did indicate quite clearly that it was indeed dangerous for the patient to be around magical people. This was further supported how there were no recorded successes of the patient being cared for by someone magical, including house elves, and by how even rare visitors seemed to make the patient detoriorate further.
Draco knew he had slept, but he didn’t feel rested. He knew he had tried to call a house elf, and failed, for the first time in his life, and none had come to check on him either. They usually would, once an hour. And he could hear the healer again, entering. He could not hear his mother. The healer shuffled into a chair.
That hit like a hex. He didn’t know how he could have been satisfied with just having moved along, but he had been, it was true. Learning about muggles the way he had for the last few years had been so good, it had felt like peace and growth and how life was supposed to be. Like he had finally claimed his place among the broader humanity, the place he hadn’t realised was there for him, had been there all along. He hadn’t known he had wanted to belong to that until he did, but it felt so right now. Learning and growing had been good, and necessary, but he felt ashamed now, embarrassed that he had felt so content with it.
Sorry about the huge delay here (and the morose Draco). I have several chapters ready to go, but I have some structure problems in order to get to them. Not giving up, though!
Divorce was almost unheard of among wizards, and his own family, and everyone like them, looked down upon it. The few stories that circulated were mostly about muggle-borns and mixed families anyway, but it happened among purebloods too, and then disdain was the correct response. Probably part of it was, as Harry pointed out, that it was a lot easier for purebloods to avoid divorce in the first place, as most of them had an enormous hereditary family home, and plenty of money besides – if they ended up in an unhappy marriage they would have a lot easier of a time avoiding each other, after all. One would take the west wing and one would take the east wing, and so a married couple could lead very separate lives, though on occasion they would probably have to go places together. It certainly put some previously rather puzzling things about aunt Isabella and uncle Thaddeus into perspective.
“Ignore Harry’s mix, though, it’s just got a lot of pop that think it’s punk,” Kenny said. “But I guess it’s the thought that counts.”
“And then there is the way I need your help for everything,” he said “That is being in your power too.” Not that he had ever been truly independent, he was used to doing with the help of house elves, of course, but that was different. And he definitely had the power over the elves, so it didn’t matter as much that he needed them to... oh no. He had the power in that relationship, and he had no idea how that might look from below. He had always heard that the elves liked to serve, of course, but only from other wizards. He could sense a cascade of implicaations ready to bury him.
“Yes, my school… it was a bit like that, yes.” The goblin wars… well, clearly something was missing from the tellings of that history, that was obvious at some distance, and probably from lots of other parts of history as well. “And then I discovered the topic of war in music… and I wanted context, but I wasn’t well enough back then to read up. Now I am.”
“Well, I suppose I didn’t have much in the way of knowledge, to start with. Not about genre, for instance – what makes something rock-and-roll? What makes something the kind of rock-and-roll that can almost be considered proto-punk? I had no idea, and I still only know what I see written about it, and what it says on the cover or in the booklet. Which generally does not include genre, for some reason. So the best was interviews, because then I could see more of what the artist themself thought about their work. And now I am starting to get a grasp on genre, but that is only from listening to a lot of music and comparing that to what I see written about it. What I do find covered, I mean, most of my CDs I have never seen any proper coverage of.”
This chapter happens immediately after the last one, where Kenny realised things about Draco's past and Draco realised forgiveness had just happened to him when he wasn't aware.
“Are you saying that you were that shithead who bullied Harry through school? And pretty much everyone else you thought beneath you, too? That was you, Draco?”
“I don’t actually know. But if you have ideas, they are very welcome.”
“This place is on the High Street, I’ve walked past it many times. I’ve never been in there, but it looks fancy enough for your tastes, and so it should be plenty fancy enough for any of ours. Any small thing from there should be a proper thank-you-gift, I should think. And if you get stuck or confused in the conversation, just say ‘excuse me for a moment’, and then hold your hand over there and don’t talk too loud, and chances are they won’t hear you very well, so you can ask me stuff.” That seemed reasonable enough. “Ready?”
“I know it’s just eight, but do you want to go to bed?” Kenny asked. “I think this day has taken a lot out of you. I tried to keep my questioning minimal, but you know how it is, there’s a lot to go through in the beginning.”
And then Kenny turned on Harry, insisting he take a taxi home and then take a “crash package” and spend the next day in bed. Draco was surprised – Harry didn’t seem out of sorts at all. But Harry grudgingly acknowledged that this was probably a good idea, fuck you, Kenny, and call me if you need anything tomorrow, anything at all, hear me? And then Harry was gone and Draco was alone with the stranger.
“Is it okay I do that on Tuesday this week? Otherwise we can do errands on Thursday whenever I don’t work, if that matters. What magazines do you want? Is there a list?”
“Oh. You were that close to dying. I didn’t realise. God, I’m a bellend, sorry. Hermione told me about some people dying of this stuff because they refused to leave the magical world. I’m glad you didn’t die.”
To her credit, Granger didn’t bat an eye. “And which grimoire is this that someone would risk attacking you in broad daylight over? You know most old spell books aren’t very up to date compared to the modern ones, though there is still tremendous historical value to finding one—”
I sat Potter down under a ferociously lifelike chimera.
Potter’s face tightened. He was no doubt having his own recollections of facing the Dark Lord. And I was left in amazement, once again, at how easily Potter seemed to have forgiven us.
“Ron and Hermione both know how to handle a gun,” Harry said, “and I’ve set up their place as a sort of back up safe house if things go wrong. I also have a stash of weapons there. If we don’t shake off the tail, then we might need to fight them off.”
“I thought I already helped enough today.” Malfoy leaned back into an armchair. “I answered all your questions earlier and I rescued you from the tender attentions of Blaise. Though to be fair, I think he was actually fond of you. Maybe you two could have had a nice time together.”
It was Granger.
Riddle’s voice was like a blast of chill wind, and several of those sitting around the table shivered. Riddle made special note of them. They would need to be dealt with.
Draco relaxed marginally. “I’m just trying to be financially responsible. The economy isn’t doing that well right now. Can’t afford to splurge on all my whims.” He wanted to move out of his chair without seeming rude. The powerful odor of tobacco smoke made Draco dizzy.
“Let him go.” Harry’s voice was strained with fury and worry.
“Besides,” I continued softly, moving so that I could count his lashes, “isn’t it much better like this? No strings, no obligations, just fun?” I kissed him, gently cupping his jaw.
Draco drove like a madman; he needed to reach Harry.
“How can you be certain that backup won’t have a set time by which they would come in?” Harry asked, ignoring what Riddle had revealed.
“That, Potter, is how I know how much of the drug to give you.”
I nipped at his earlobe, moved down to his chest, my breath ghosting over his nipples. I missed this. I missed sex, especially with a body substantial enough that I could grab onto, that I could feel the raw power humming just below the surface. I was tired of my hand being my only companion.
Potter’s reluctant smile grew a centimeter bigger. “I guess this will be a test of how well I taught you how to duel.”
“I’ll drive you,” Granger said, when Draco declined Mr. Weasley’s half-hearted attempts to convince Draco to stay overnight. Mrs. Weasley hadn’t said anything, but her face showed relief.
I settled finally for a cream sweater that I had bought on sale at Selfridges two years ago, and a pair of black pants tailored to accentuate the length of my legs.
They needed to be careful. Who knew what kind of damage the saltwater had wrought? Rosier wasn’t clear on what he thought the Decoder was made of, but even if it were constructed entirely of precious metal, it still might have suffered from the shipwrecking itself and broken into fragments.
It became silent, with only the light breathing from those watching able to be heard.
Harry knelt down to help, muttering suggestions about choice areas where Draco could stuff his degree.
“Sorry,” Harry said, half-shadowed in the doorway. “I didn’t mean to startle you.”
“No, you’re right.” I had to face my past somehow. It was inescapable. “I was up to no good.”
“That sounds lovely,” I cut him off with a look. Again, that twinge of annoyance at his refusal to put a name on what we had. And it would be less conspicuous if the inn-keeper thought we were an ordinary couple here for the pleasures of country living. Particularly if they got ‘busloads from Brighton’ around here. Though I loathed Brighton – the last time I was there, visiting for Pride, I ended up in a great row with some fat American over the last table at the pub.
The first thing Harry noticed when he woke was how parched his mouth was. The second was that he was on one of the softest beds he had ever lain on.
My father peered over. “Is that a duck on the label?”
“You should use a Body-bind, Draco,” Cross mused. “On Potter here. Stunning would be more efficient, of course, but I think that it would be best if he sees you pry the Grimoire out of his hand. To dissuade him from any further illusions he might have about you.”
But yes, that would be an ideal place to begin.
“That door right there. Hurry up.”
“Yes….” Harry looked at the console unseeingly. “But this does affect the Ministry, and in a way that might have big implications. I don’t want to take any chances.” He was thinking about the leak – somewhere – that had betrayed the drug raid to Dolohov and Pettigrew. If it was someone on the Elixir task force, that was one matter. But if it related to their Web comms, then that would be problematic….
“Yes,” Bellatrix said. “We will.”
“I guess I’ll go in then.” Harry blinked and stifled his yawn.
“Hang in tight,” Theo yelled over the engine’s buzz and the water. “We’ll get there soon.”
Feel free to leave a comment or DM me on here if you liked this!
“I came with my professor for a dig in Turkey,” Draco said drily. “We slept in tents without cots. We didn’t even have a shower, and we all looked like we had drowned in dust after a week.”
I had not envisioned I would be standing here in the chilly afternoon baring my soul to Granger of all people. I forced a wan smile. “Don’t worry about it. Let me know when you track him down.”
“Harry,” Draco said in a croaking voice –
Potter insisted on coming despite my objections. I told him in no uncertain terms that I would be fine without him tagging along. I was, after all, just returning to my childhood home.
She gave a startled sound as she stopped, staring at me. She remained mostly relaxed, however, eyeing me with my wand out more as an exotic sight than a threat. Undoubtedly, she had unseen Shields and other magical protection invisible to the eye around her; most high-ranking Ministry officials did nowadays, since the War.
However, Malfoy’s clothes indicated he might actually regard eleven thousand galleons as paltry change. Malfoy’s opera hat, now held in his surprisingly bare hands, looked as though it was worth more than Harry’s weekly stipend. The cut and material of Malfoy’s evening jacket must cost more than Harry’s savings.
“I don’t think it’s a good idea,” Potter said. “The Circle will likely have your parents watched and Cross is still out there. Visiting them would only expose yourself and put your parents in danger.” He looked at Granger. “Can you let them know Malfoy is safe?”
Draco scowled. His dinner partner was late. He had specifically told Fletcher to meet at half past seven and it was now almost eight.
“It might still be at the Manor,” I said, “if Cross hadn’t taken it. I doubt he will, since he knows it won’t respond to him. And I don’t think he would have known where I put it. The Manor is big.”
I let out a groan. My friends were right – it had been too long. I was already hard, like a randy teenager fumbling around for the first time. I was still pleasantly buzzed, floating on a cloud of sensations. Blaise’s touches were electric. Every time he put his hands or lips on me, a wave of pleasure washed over me.
Portraits of past Ministries luminaries stared at me, some with a mere glance before returning to posing, others with a much more intent curiosity. I could ask Professor Snape for advice. Even in portrait form, he still had valuable insight to offer. Being the former Head of Slytherin, it was possible he knew more. Being oil and canvas had not improved his disposition, I remembered, from the last visit I paid him.
I quickly transfigured it into a pillow as Harry aimed another Disarming charm at the figure. It glanced off harmlessly.
“When will Bellatrix and Dolohov return?” he asked.
He needed to get out of here. Never mind that Goyle, that scum, had already vanished, but Harry had to fight his way out of the Leaky Cauldron first. Man for man, he was more than a match with his training and enhanced body, but he’d tire, and the number of his opponents were against him.
Draco made an expression of mock horror. “There must be centuries of accumulated grime here. How long has anyone lived here?”
“In that same message, our station in Helmand picked up notice of a rendezvous between the Mors Mordre and a known faction of the Taliban. They plan a sale of the item you’ve just described.”
Hedwig, broadcast for them to stop.
“You’re starting to think like an Auror, Malfoy.”
Strong arms enfolded around him. At the same time, there was the coolness of a needle at his neck and a snick that barely registered.
I could hear the grin she so assiduously hid on her face. “Can you look away? It’s disconcerting.”
He just grinned cheekily at me.
It was true; he did. He also found a sense of style – or more likely, his wife the female Weasel dressed him.
The car bumped and halted.
I looked coldly at the Weasley. He glared back.
Potter looked at me dubiously. “I know of a book like that. It was a powerful Dark Artifact. In light of your epiphany, I don’t think you should touch it again. It could be a very dark curse – or even a fragment of a soul.”
“The Blacks have a tapestry to show their family tree,” Potter said, taking his eyes off me momentarily to take in the sight.
Then Harry was naked in front of Draco. The fact that Draco could only see outlines in the darkened room added to his desire. He moved in, his breath hot and wet, to engulf the swell of Harry’s cock.
“You said that you found this from the body of an Unspeakable?”
Ah. That would explain how easily she managed to get Draco to drop his guard. Or at the very least, not walk out immediately.
“I’m glad you’re alright,” Draco said. “It was stupid, but it was the only way I could think of to help. I didn’t have a gun, and I knew I couldn’t take her out by challenging her to a duel or anything.”
Potter gave me a strange look. His eyes really were attractive, even with those hideous glasses. “No. Dennis called up and told me you were waiting.”
“I gave you the equivalent of a muscle relaxant for your bio-enhancements,” Malfoy said. “This is a drug that is used for node connection burnouts when the web components between the human body and the Sentient Intelligence become too stressed.”
Harry avoided a sleek racer with a move that left it spinning in midair for a second. He passed by the driver’s angry face and suppressed a grin. That man had been pushing at the edge of safe driving anyways. Served him right to be taught a lesson.
They stopped at a pillar in the middle of the cavernous space where trains used to run. Goyle’s fingers danced a series of patterns quickly on the surface.
Sunlight streamed in and pooled at the foot of the bed. I rubbed my eyes. It had been a pleasant sleep, lying next to Harry. His arm, flung across my chest, weighed comfortably. The aftermath of sex still filled the air, and the little vial of lube that Harry had, in a stroke of foresight, taken with him, rolled on its side. I grabbed it before it fell to the floor.
“Oh, no.” Dolohov shook his head, his grip tightening on the gun. “Mr. Malfoy is crucial to our plans. Truth be told, we want him more than we wat you. Now, both of you, get in the car.”
Riddle laughed. Wormtail tried not to flinch but he didn’t entirely succeed. Riddle did not seem to notice, though.
“That simple?” Fletcher sat at a desk that Draco hadn’t noticed and lit another light. It darkened his face in an oddly menacing manner.
Harry suddenly smiled. “I sound like an arse, don’t I? I haven’t even thanked you for helping us get out of there.”
“My dear boy, I have no intention of harming you. But it’s best if you don’t make threats. For one, they are quite meaningless in your situation. For another, even my patience has limits.”
However it takes nearly three days for him to fully recover and visits Harry at No 12, Grimmauld place, London to obtain Dudley's letter of approval to study the No5, Privet Drive, Surrey.
He finished the report around six o clock and cleaned the house. He always cleaned the house spotless before he started his day's work or went out. Potter would call him a clean freak or neat freak and would deliberately drop a towel or a shirt here and there to annoy him and would make it up to him with a random snog or with 'out of the blue' sex on the kitchen floor with their clothes on. Perhaps he purposely annoyed Draco to find a reason for a fuck in broad daylight.
Harry knew he would never leave. Even if Harry got late from work he would always sit on the step outside their new house leaning against the railing waiting, having smoked five, six cigarettes trying to kill himself.
Despite truth.
His voice became dangerousy low and malicious. He sucked the last bit of smoke and threw away the cigarette watching Harry's rage hitting the top notch with a wicked satisfaction on his pale face now glowing in the setting sun.
Draco bought white roses and walked when the sun was setting. Kingsley had created a cemetery for war heroes. It was a beautiful peaceful home for the brave hearts. He found him. He touched his name. He placed the flowers. Sat there and waited. He didn't stare into nothingness. If he dug this grave he could get his bones. He could find some other ingredients and cook up a dark spell and bring him back to life. He knew he could do that. Potter would surely yell at him.
'For Fuck's sake Draco, why can't you see this? I don't give a flying fuck about anything in this world when you are dying somewhere. Same thing happened in the Room of Requirements. I just wanted you and you only, you worthless ferret..., and yes I nearly died for you. Yeah perhaps I was noble Harry Potter and they say I would die for anyone but I don't know..., after rescuing you, I did not give a damn about your other sick crony? All I wanted was you.' he caressed Malfoy's clean blond strands now smelling fresh. ' I thought I lost you. You scared the shit out of me.' He hugged him tightly
Malfoy was totally distracted. He knew he could not concentrate on his work. He looked at Harry nervously.
Malfoy kissed back. As though assuring him that he wouldn't go tonight. He didn't know what he said through his warm kiss tasting Harry's tongue, with his soft grunts but Harry's heart understood everything though even Harry didn't know what. Because he was happy, holding Malfoy in his arms in this quiet dark night in this lonesome having him and kissing him made him extremely happy.
He watched Potter's face, took his glasses off and gazed in to his eyes. They were full of passion and adoration. He touched Potter's face and watched how he closed his eyes to his touch. He had never done that before.
Harry was dreaming of going home. He finished his work around nine o'clock and was dreaming of spending the rest of the night in peace. Watch some TV or read the sports page or just relax with a mug of cappuccino made from the fancy muggle cappuccino machine he had bought recenty. He loved his new apartment in Edinburgh. He was planning, to spend a perfect relaxing weekend and, on going to visit Edinburgh castle on Saturday if Kingsley didn't send an urgent owl asking him to report to work.
'Eleven thirty in the night. You never stop this habit do you?'
'We make rational decisions. We do. If we can't save a victim, we give up. But could not do that Draco, when you were dying. What mattered to me was you and only you. There is nothing called rational decisions when it comes to love. I love you. I always have.'
Malfoy opened it slowly. He was not bothered like Ron or Neville. He was calm. and the howler did not yell either. It said in Narcissa Malfoy's sharp quiet cold voice, 'DO NOT ACCEPT!'
How he loved staying there, in his place, perhaps fall asleep! Potter didn't have to hold him. Draco loved just staying by his side even if he didn't say a thing.
He coughed, looked here and there. He was thirsty. He felt  cold. His head ached. He ran his fingers in his hair and felt the short silky flop that the styling charm he had cast was wearing off.
After a stormy argument or yelling at each other over a good for nothing issue Draco would come to sleep on the sofa and Potter never slept alone in their bed for the past seven years.
Draco loved his taste. He tasted the cherry wine he had offered him. He sat on the sofa pulling Potter on him and decided to lose control. Potter understood and took charge of the avalanche.
She read the page and grimaced. 'Harry, this needs a blood sacrificial. Blood of a willing non relative's beating heart should bleed on his heart. That means somebody should cut open the heart and give his heart blood. And there is a ritual.'
'Death Eater right?' he laughed. 'You want a Death Eater Potter? I'll show you the Death Eater.'
But Harry would never. He knew justice. The right and wrong.
'You OK princess? Tell me which one shook you the most?'
'Where is your bedroom?' Potter stroked his cheek softly with his thumb.
'You know why I fell for you, my spoilt attention seeking prat?' He placed his head on Draco's chest as though asking him to pamper him that Draco instinctively ran his fingers in his hair lying on his back on the sofa.
Harry dragged him to where they had stopped. They kissed and undressed each other and they kissed more running their hands everywhere on each other, in every nook and crany, hair to neck to shoulders to shoulder blades down the spine, groping, grinding their hard erections against each other wanting more and more.
Other days were not so mild and smooth. Harry got real spicy treats.
just a fraction of a second before Harry had reached him Malfoy gasped in sheer pain, his body stiffened, his eyed opened wide in pure astonishment and his whole hand was being sucked in to the book.
'That door doesn't open. No one comes in and no one goes out. Since you love that kid of magic.'
He remebered one by one the events of the day, and dragging and tedious that he wanted to drift in to nothingness and never come back. Draco counted the five cigarettes in the ashtray. Drank some water and sat back on the floor of his room in Malfoy Manor.
He let go of the cloth, carefully cast a cleaning spell to clean his hands, cupped Potter's face and kissed him thoroughly and got on with his work silently.
He turned with raised eyes, 'Oh yeah? what did you fantasize doing to me?'
'Draco, why didn't you tell us you were coming? We could have prepared something special.'
Harry made love to his one man and there was no escape from that raging bliss. Harry told him in every possible way he could, showed him in every posible way he could how much he died every day to love him more and more. And he gave him everything he could give tonight seizing every moment of the night.
He prepared his coffee after a shower and started his research report. He couldn't focus at all. Those green eyes shining bright in the golden light were bothering him. There were red marks on his pale wrists where his rough hands had held him hard. He didn't use dittany on it. He still could feel everything of him all over him that it tortured him with a mild treacle tart sweetness. It was lovely but he needed his peace. He rubbed his eyes, drummed the table, drank another coffee, smoked another cigarette, and then tried watching Fashion TV.
He sat back and waited. Allowed Harry run his hand down his spine, kiss his hair, massage his shoulders. Harry felt Malfoy was slowly yielding to him. He naturally leaned against Harry's body and relaxed between his legs. Harry wrapped his arms around him and stroked his chest embracing him, kissing his hair more.
Last night was one of those. Malfoy sucked him, kissed his whole body thirstily. Harry jerked him while he was in him shagging hard. They reached orgasm together and Harry fondled his beautiful narrow waist giving him the love bite just at the base of his spine. After kissing for another long moments Harry bound him to the bed held him and sucked him hard making him moan loudly and making him come breathlessly.
Harry pulled him and kissed him. The moment his mouth touched his lips Malfoy yielded and kissed back greedily. Harry hugged him, cradled him and told him he loved him too. 'You have no idea how much. I will always bleed for you. I will alway burn for you.'
He is observing a drawing while sipping his coffee at the kitchen table when Harry walks in. A plate of pancakes steaming on the table despite his inability to perform the art of muggle cooking.
Draco wouldn't say anything.
'What?'
They gazed at each other for a few long moments.
'I don't know to operate those.' he points at the sophisticated cappuccino machine and the stove Dudley has brought recently.
Draco had to let it go.
They shook hands. George held both his hands and smiled broadly. Malfoy did not show any  sign of reproach or disgust. In fact he was so mellow and civil.
Throughout the session Harry did not grasp anything. He simply watched him. He knew he had to concentrate but his movement, his clear speech, gesture and even the frown mesmerised Harry. So he made a mental note to find a document or something on the subject later or ask for the notes from a "Hermionish" auror.
'I like your style.' he finally said.
'Oh fuck off!'
He opened his eyes and saw Potter was watching him.
Harry sent three patronuses to Kingsley, Head of the auror division and Narcissa Malfoy.
'Remarkable Inca civilization. But why do you care?' Malfoy sneered.
'You!'
He thought it would be over and it would be gone with time. He thought if he didn't see him quite often it would be over.
Narcissa Malfoy was reading an ancient grimoir belonged to the Malfoys regarding curses. Malfoy was lying in his room and Harry could see he was turning very slightly grey.
Kingsley ignored them and permitted Harry to take his long awaited cozy Friday evening around 10 o'clock in the night which he did not want. Not anymore.
Paramedics could not do more. They finally gave up and let go of Draco's life. The neighbours sobbed softly to the night sky not knowing that life was not a choice but sometimes death was.
His face moves. Facial muscles relaxes. Then he sighs with a sweet smile. 'It's adorable the secret you cherish.' His hand moves to his heart smiles looking sideways at something. 'I'm honoured!' he talks to himself rather than to anyone else around and locks himself in a dream.
Hermione disapparated and Narcissa Malfoy appeard with Hermione seconds later.
The next minute he felt sick. So sick.  He ran to the bathroom and vomited everything he had eaten. He started shivering slightly and felt dizzy. He rinsed his mouth washed his face and came back. Mother was sitting very white faced but he didn't see father's face for it was hidden behind the paper. He sat at the foot of father's chair and rested his head on his lap and relaxed.
'I don't know,' Harry snatched his cloak and walked out.
And then,
'Draco!'
When a curse breaker worked it was necessary for the auror division to provide gaurd. One of the aurors was assigned to monitor the check in and check out times of the curse breakers.
'Thanks for the information you gave me. I found it very useful for my production.'
Harry knew what to do. Just one visit to Mrs Malfoy and this problem will be over.
'What's this?'
Malfoy dropped his bag, his body stiffened first but then relaxed alowing Harry to kiss him. Harry felt his warm hands touching and holding and carresing his arms. He let Harry kiss him. They kissed and kissed and broke apart, stared at each other nervously with mounting desire and kissed again.
Potter was glowing in gold. His green eyes were vicious amber, his black hair was purple or dark magenta or hot pink, Draco did not know. His skin was gold, golden brown and he was glowing like some holy creature Draco had never seen.
Draco noticed that the sun had set and there were stars in the sky. It was very cold and his nose was bleeding again. He realized that blood stains were on his shirt. He cleaned it, kissed the tombstone and came home.
Ten weeks passed.
Yet he went home, had a wash and got dressed in a T-shirt and a pair of jeans and apparated at Peru, in that unfamiliar territory to find him sitting on a flat stone looking at something down below, in his usual 'I don't give a damn' stance. His cloak and bag were lying on the ground away from him ignored, but a pack of cigarettes was next to him.
Harry got up to get him water.
'Why even asked me to try if you knew?' Harry takes the cigarette from his fingers and drags in the smoke. His eyes closed and voice in a delicate whisper, smiles to the soft chuckle of the man next to him.
'I know!'
'Well there's only one way to know!'
The wound healed. Malfoy woke up, looked around and stood up. He reached Harry in a start. Harry tried to smile but he knew he could not. He was shaking uncontrollably and Hermione was weeping hysterically. Harry could see Malfoy going so red in crisp anger that he gritted his teeth and snatched the grimoir. He grabbed Hermione's wand and chanted a complicated spell placing the wand on Harry's Heart. Harry could feel the pain ease but he was still shaking and the vision getting blurred. He felt his heart was getting slow and realised that he was dying. Slowly and softly.
Once Harry had to visit Malfoy in his house in Glasglow to hand over top security files from the auror division. Harry volunteered surprising the others but the Head of Auror Office was happy for the importance of the file. Harry refused the assistance of another auror saying he could handle it alone.
'Am I dreaming?'
He knew it was not very easy for Potter but he managed pretty well.
'Pretty good!' Draco laughed.
Harry yelled horrified, bent, hugged him from behind wrapping his hands around his body and pulled him towards him, away from the book. The force of the book was so powerful that Harry's whole body strained in pain. He pulled his wand out cast a rope to bind him to the sealed door and he hugged Malfoy and tugged both of them towards the door. finally the force of the book broke and Malfoy leaned slack against Harry's body.
Day 2 was threateningly silent for Harry. They worked every spell detecting the magic and the source of it. Kingsley and Arthur Weasley sent a patronus. Hermione sent an owl asking complicated questions and giving even intricate instructions which he read and gaped at Harry dumbfounded. Then he hogged the floo to talk to Lucius Malfoy for half an hour.
Harry heard footsteps. He held his hand and stopped him gazing in to his hungry eyes.
Draco Malfoy did not even turn back to the sound of Harry apparating. He carefully blew a ring of smoke to the still thick tropical warmth that the smoke rings beautifully rose high up in the air.
That night they had sex. As though addicted to each other, mad about each other, they had sex. Harry fingered Malfoy's yearning hole lovingly with lube and then entered his desperate aching cock gently, caressed his warm moist back. He held Malfoy's warm beating chest and kissed the sweet smelling skin of his back.  He loved when Malfoy moaned in pleasure. Harry wanted to say how much he loved this. He wanted to say how much he wanted him, how much he wanted to do this all night long. But he did not. He caressed him, kissed his back, hugged him, ran his fingers in his hair, turned his head and kissed him. He shagged him. He shagged him hard, slow and deep calling him his baby  while holding his already hard cock and stroking.
But Harry wanted to warn him. He simply wanted to stop him but the words have left him maliciously. Dark objects are toys to Malfoy. What if Harry was just worrying for nothing? It will clearly offend him trying to tell him off his work.
He felt unbearably cold. Perhaps another cigarette would make him warm before getting ready for work.
Draco felt the sudden warmth in his heart. It was surely him.
'Oh yeah?' he grunts.
Eventually his spell overpowers the magic of the house dragging them out of the broken window, which, the precise moment he seizes, capturing his naked glassy green gaze.
Harry stays awake for he did not or could not sleep. He is sitting on the floor of the living room watching the moonlight seeping in through the curtains apart when Draco walks in for a smoke. He sits by him pulling his knees towards his chest allowing moonlight on his creamy arms resting on the knees.
'Oh!' he sighs looking up at the ceiling.
He loved staying at home shut down, sitting on the floor, sleeping on the sofa or doorstep drinking coffee from the machine, wearing his clothes, smoking. He found peace in it.
Draco walked toward him and sat at the foot of his chair and held his hands. 'I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.'
He just wanted this to last. For how long...? He didn't think.
'Somebody barges into life if I don't go to work and drags me somewhere to feed me or these people send me food.' he pointed at the neighbourhood. 'I'm going to put on,' he poked his belly with his forefinger.
He wiped his bleeding nose, left the box on the floor and walked out of the house and disapparated.
...........
It happened again.  He fucked Harry longer than before. Harder than before. He turned Harry's head for a deeper harder kisses while stroking him more. More lube, one finger, two fingers, longer, more lube, more fucking, uncontrollably than before. Then he sucked Harry until they were worn out.
'Of course there is Harry Potter!'
Harry wanted to hold him, embrace him but Malfoy pulled away. He  turned Harry around and pressed him agaist the wall. Harry felt his hot breath on the back of his neck and the hands running down his spine. His hands stopped on his buttocks slowly caressing and squeazing. He played mischievously pressing his thumbs in between them and kissing the back of his neck. Harry groaned pressing his hands against the wall, his cock aching and the tip of it touching the wall. Malfoy, sensing it, slowly wrapped his fingers around his cock and started stroking. He stroked for awhile until Harry caught the rhythm and started moving.
Draco took his hungry invitation wholehearted, embracing it, hanging by that very moment, falling even more in love with him, just before his wedding day.
However Malfoy started spending more time around Harry signing the book or tying his shoe lace or finding something in his bag or making a note sitting infront of Harry. And Harry didn't know why but started feeling uncomfortable when Malfoy left to the sealed room where the dark objects were waiting to eat him. He wanted to tell him to take care or simply to stop what he was doing but Harry knew he had neither right nor valid reason to tell him.
Harry kissed that rosy mouth againg breathlessly. He felt his hot wet mouth opening wide letting him in. He felt Malfoy's whole body relaxing under him accepting his kiss. He kissed slow and deep. He kissed properly, taking time, sucking one lip and the other lip and both lips together and found his way in to his wet tasty mouth again, met with his wet tongue, embracing sucking, playing, dancing, grunting softly for sheer delight and finally let his hands go and pulled away to breathe.
Malfoy moaned happily. Harry couldn't have enough of him. He came moaning loudly kissing the back of his neck and the spine helplessly. Malfoy came a little later. They spent a few more minuted kissing and then fell a sleep.
He breathed hard, wiped his eyes and looked aside. He was sleeping soundly, facing the other side of the room with his hand under his head. Hie skin was glowing in the golden light in Harry's bedroom and Harry could see the love bite on his back which he had given him the previous night.
'Yeah? Try me!' Harry laughed scathingly.
Harry yelled in utter pain shaking, and he woke up breathing hard.
Draco Malfoy was a curse breaker.
Narcissa looked at him sharply. She observed him quietly. Then she turned to a page of the grimoir and gave it to him.
Harry had to tell him where his heart is. Where his heart sleeps at night. To whom his heart makes love. He coldn't walk down the aisle without telling him everything. Without letting him know how much... and for how long.
Harry ignored again. If the man hated Harry that much probably he'd better leave. He didn't want to dive head long in to an unnecessary brawl with him but for some ridiculous undying reason he couldn't leave. He yearned to stay. He craved that moment. There. Right there. He knew this was exactly what happened in the boys' bathroom six years back but still he couldn't make up his mind to walk away. It was as though he was very much cursed to thrash himself again and again against this man.
'It's my job!' he would yell.
'Draco normally stays back for sight seeing,' a young witch smiled at Harry.
Harry and Malfoy lay side by side with their chests open to the  sky. Hermione cursed open Malfoy's skin reveling his beating heart that his body jerked slightly. Harry kew he was feeling the pain and shut his own eyes tightly. Then He heard Hermione's voice shaking near him. He held her hand and put the tip of the wand on his chest and nodded. He heard Ron hissing nervously. Hermione took a deep breath and cast the curse on Harry's chest that he whole heartedly embraced.
'Because he has your mother's blood!'
'She said, "Things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end. If not always in the way we expect." And I think she is right.'
Finally George remarked.
Draco woke up.
He stopped and looked at Harry, 'Guess who's getting an owl from Kingsley!'
Harry tucks the few strands of silver blond behind his ears and lifts his face by the chin meeting his anguish gaze. 'Well there's one way to find out.'
Draco stops transfixed for an instant forgetting his coffee, stops breathing, drinking in the sight of the man not bothered to hide his rouse.
But now every color has left his life. Not even black and white was left for him.
Potter had just finished buttoning his pants and was going to wear the shirt. He stopped getting dressed. He put his shirt on the chair and came towards Draco who was sitting on the bed still wet, in his towel.
Day 4 has passed the break even point.
'Are you going? Please come again!' Draco looked up at him.
They had sex. In his bed he had spent his entire childhood till he became a man.
Once he simply pushed Harry on to the bed and kissed him all over hard and hungry.
Potter laughed, walked towards him and sat on the ground beside him.
Because there are no rational decisions when it comes to love.
He coughed.
He watches the third smoke ring ripples up, touches it with his forefinger and taps it.  Watching the disturbed smoke ring making designs in the moonlit darkness he drags in the next intake and fills his lungs. His head tilts back in bliss rests against the wall tapping the cigarette with the tip of his finer shedding ash.
'Ok... what did George tell you mother?' He rubbed his eyes wearily.
He would roll his eyes, shrug or simply shake his head hopelessly and would say, 'Shall we have this conversation later?' and would kiss his forehead.
He had a bath. Looked in the mirror. His dark circles had vanished. He looked good. Hair grown. No styling charm on. He used all his hair care, skin care products, shaving lotion, cologne, perfume, everything. And got ready.
'You told me the magic would hurt me but it hurt you severely! You lied!'
'I'll stay if you want me to stay. I'll resign. ' he finally said. 'I mean it.'
'I thought you would be surprised,' Harry showed his genuine astonishment.
'Really Malfoy?'
He softly rubbed the revealing line of pale skin on his left wrist, bellow the cuff of his shirt and unfastened his sleeve button.
'You slept well?' he asks smoothly sipping his coffee.
Everybody got used to his funky hairstyle and Potter's clothes.
Potter removed his fingers moaned in sheer pleasure and entered Draco. He winced first but caught up the rhythm and found the glory in it.  Potter bent and kissed his parted lips hungrily time to time and they both moved so in unison losing control and losing every sense of time and space.
Draco entered his living room, threw his cloak on the sofa, closed the door and sat on the floor leaning agaist a wall.
Harry sat and Hermione hugged him holding him tight Harry spent a few more minutes holding her listening to Ron and Malfoy yelling.
Draco would simply grimace.
Draco always waited. He couldn't sleep, he couldn't eat, he couldn't rest. He would smoke to kill time and wait for him.
'Mother!' He hugged her and stayed in her arms for awhile.
He made the correct choice. It's not that he made a mistake as a eleven year old child. He made all the correct chioces. He chose his people wisely.
He didn't want to wash away anything tonight.
'You filthy little mudblood!'
Falling...
'What are you thinking?' Draco ran his hand down his naked back. Potter was sitting on his four-poster bed, waiting for Draco to join him.
He caressed Draco's cheeks with his thumbs and gazed into his grey eyes with pure adoration.
Harry couldn't understand that beautiful mild expression he gave George and the sweet moment they shared.
'You tore it!'
Potter didn't answer. He slowly pushed Draco in to bed throwing his towel away. Draco tried to push him away but he pulled Draco and locked him in his arms. He held him till he calmed down.
'I was so mean to you wasn't I? After his death!' Draco frowned.
He had quit smoking. Everyday he worked. Without breathing he worked. He started learning about powerful wand-less magic the American covens used and spent most days outside. When he came home he hugged one of his clothes and slept soundly in some corner on the floor.
But no words came out.
'Weasley I need your blood. Come! Granger hold his body he's shaking.
'Why don't you spend a few days with you parents?'
'How so?'
Once Harry had to meet her at an International Quidich Conference and he threw a trantrum.
Harry kissed his hair, wrapped his hands around him, held him that night. The epic worrior and his prince and their unwritten story and all the  broken pieces.
'This is Drey, my boyfriend.'
Draco Malfoy woke up to the black and white quiet.
Draco didn't protest. He led him to his bedroom. Soon they were naked and more kissing and more groping.
Draco simply hugged him more. Fingers tangled in his hair, kissed his neck or shoulder or hair trying to stop his tears. He gasped. He caressed him knowing his tears were trickling down his cheeks and on his back. Draco couldn't say a thing.
'What's this?'
For a few seconds Harry, Ron and Malfoy relaxed in total silence while Hermione continued to sob softly holding Harry.
'Wake up lazyass I'm hungry!'
And Draco wouldn't sleep inside the house without him. Because the house woke up when he was not there and played tricks on his mind.
'Hey Mr Drey, you look cute in that new hairstyle. like your boyfriend's. Oh is that his jacket you are wearing? You look gorgeous in his clothes.'
'Because he fucking didn't want you dead, you bastard and I have no control over that and you are a curse Malfoy you always have been in his life. Just get the hell out of his life.' Ron yelled now shaking with sever anger.
Kreacher was the happiest to have Master Malfoy at Grimmauld place. Harry had to seal the bedroom door Kreacher-proof and soundproof to have privacy and then they made love. They made love desperately tasting and experiencing each other's everything. They kissed each other soft and hard. They touched each other, felt each other's skin, stroked each other's hard aching cocks touching each other's come for the first time. They sucked each other drinking eachother for the first time. They made love all through the night until they were worn out and fell a sleep.
He swallows, considers and approves and sighs gravely.
He accepted it happily.
It was beautiful that Potter was adoring him, doting him and basically pampering him. He was scared to fall a sleep. He didn't want this to be over. How he wanted Potter more and more! He needed him more and more.
'No news from the ministry and no way out and you couldn't figure out the curse!'
'It's fine Kingsley,' Harry lied.
He removed his tailored cloak, shirt and trousers revealing his flawless body and got dressed in a set of thin leather jacket and a pair of jeans which gave him a look of a muggle biker. Then he covered his hair with a leather cap. First he walked around the object as though studying it fiddling with his enchanted 'hammer like tool' among his fingers. Then he pulled a chair closer, sat and worked. His usual sneer and proud gaze vanished when he concentrated. He frowned and bit his lip time to time and grimaced. Then he did his naughty sneer when the curse was broken. Harry had leaned against the wall and admired him the whole time.
Draco looked into his eyes. Took his glasses off and looked in. In seven long years Draco had  trained himself to let him do his job. He had learnt not to yell at him when he had had to leave for special duty. Because that's what he had always wanted to do.
'Draco wake up!'
He had seen Potter placing it there and had asked what it was.
Draco woke up. He was sleeping on the kitchen floor. No cigarettes. He was wearing his own night shirt and jeans. The heater was on. He was warm. He made coffee. He cleaned the house. Washed the clothes.
'I don't know why you kissed me,' he continued yelling, 'But I loved it. I loved it Potter. And everything else. I just loved it. You know why? Because I loved you. I don't know how or where it started but I have always loved you. So when you kissed me and did everything you did to me I embraced it all greedily because I craved you. I didn't expect you to feel the same way. Fuck you Potter, you nearly died!' He walked away as far as he could from him and looked out of the window at the nght sky.
'Potter that!'
'Potter Stinks!'
'For Merlin's sake Weasley, you three can never stop this can you? Rule breaking, the unorthodox crap...., whatever.... You never can stop your sick habbits, can you? Why didn't you stop her? He nearly died you shithead. You thought it was a domestic healing spell? Potter nearly died!' he yelled in pearcing anger.
'I know this is hard for you Drey,' he turned and kissed Draco's chest. 'My life is at stake all the time and you always have to bare with me.'
Harry didn't know why he wanted it but whenever Malfoy was assigned to work he volunteered for duty, which Kingsley was glad with for Malfoy handled serious dark objects and Kingsley wanted his best auror on duty. Harry just stayed there when Malfoy worked and he did not ask for overtime payment for his work too.
He returned. Washed himself. Got dressed in fresh clothes and went out for lunch. Then he went to Flourish and Blotts. Perhaps a new book would help him.
The book was a leather bound jet black book. It lay innocently on the wooden table and just looked more normal than Hagrid's Monster Book of Monsters. Malfoy sat cross legged on the floor facing the book. He took his curse detector out and placed the metal tip of it on several places of the the book carefully. At first it didn't indicate any curse but once the titanium tip touched the very centre of the book the detector beeped and glowed in red.
Draco barged into the shower and pulled him closer under the shower.
'You tried to keep me away but I dragged you into this.' Potter looked up at him. 'Because I needed you so badly. I couldn't let go. I'm sorry.'
'Just eat!'
Draco moved back on the sofa to a sitting position and dragged Potter in between his legs and arms and nested him. Draco wanted to say many things to him. Many treacle tart sweet words to him. But there was a lump in his throat. He just hugged him tightly and breathed him kissing him here and there.
Waiting.
Whenever he trampled it with his work or with Ron and Hermione or with Ginny and the Weasleys, it stubbornly found its way out. Somehow. It would crawl, creep back to the front lobe of his brain and torture him.
For some reason Harry felt so good. He was angry but he felt good. His every muscle was toned for the fight. His heart beat became calmer, his mind clearer. It felt as though he was getting somehting back which he had long missed. Did he miss this so much? Did he miss bickering with Draco Malfoy?
He threw his wand on the ground and stuffed his hand in his pocket sneering. 'What was the problem that your fairy tale lovestory fell apart? Was the bitch not enough for your needs? She  couldn't give you what you wanted?'
“What the hell. . . .”
Gran, I need help with an assignment.
48 each:
. . . . . . . . . .
“What about Mr. Cookey? He is very experienced.”
WHAT ARE THEY HIDING?????
GOT IT! Hugo must have written your homework!
“How did you do it without the neighbors getting nosey?”
They aren’t really rare or expensive I swear. They’re just really pretty. And he’s bringing the special food and live bugs for the frogs.
7:00.
“Could be your Father-In-Law.“
“WHAT THE FUCK, POTTER!!!!”
It very much is happening Mr. Malfoy-Potter. Mr. Granger-Weasley, how long will it take to consolidate the language, print it and present it to the body as Legislation?
Me either!
. . . . . . . . . .
Hugo says that we can get him a computer like mine and he can fix it. Only access to what the parents allow. And it can be set to timer to only allow using it for a designated amount of time. Automatically shut down at bedtime. Can’t be started back up without one of the parent’s permission. I'm not too concerned about it though. Jon is more interested in his books.
Would it react the same though?
YES!!! We love you both. And CONGRATULATIONS!
“Who is it?”
Just what we wanted. Arthur is very excited.
I also need to share the new Dua Lipa and Pop Smoke. Where’s Lucy?
“Every single one of you!”
“Of course. Follow the stone path.”
“Originally they were for the evening after the burrow and morning of the wedding, but we’ve decided against that. Everyone will still have a suite available to change for the wedding and we’ll serve a light breakfast in the library to get things started. You can use them as something comfortable to wear so you’re not stuck in the suits all morning while we wait for the guests to arrive.”
“I want one too! Davey needs two!”
Plan to start at around 14:00?
I remember you saying it looked all dark and foreboding. Probably why then.
potion . . . . . . . . . . masters.”
OMFG. You’re crazy.
The Dad’s don’t know you’re that far along do they?
NO it’s fine. I’m buying some biscuits. Grayson is here to help me.
OH IT’S GOOD.
“Why not? That’s my favourite outfit. I choose that.”
What’s up, Buttercup?
“. . .”
“Of course I’ll do it. We should get Mr. Trandy to help so the staff will know both of your requirements.”
I think so. Actually, Dad I’m freaking out about it.
I KNOW. And I really won’t push it.
Where are we with the other outfits?
Only family.
“I do have a request. I need your help.”
“What?”
“Potions supplies are DONE! She’s all yours now.”
“We’ll have to ask Harry. I’m thinking not today. We still have 3 floors to look at.”
“Okay, good.”
Grampa’s shed is better!
“I mean, yours is quite a bit longer than mine but. . . .oh MERLIN.”
“Is your team going to think this is weird?”
Goodbye.
“I’m not sure what to say.”
Reba is going to need kitchen help.
Oh. Even if it’s cashmere and black denim?
“And?”
. . . . . . . . . .
I’ll get the fire going!
“Well, just a little after six.”
"That's a different line of Potter's. There's another manor home somewhere. This one was closed down in the 1600's I think he said 1650. Something like that anyway. Fleumont and Euphemia had the Potter Bungalow and he built my Potter Cottage. . . . .The other Cottage is the Godric's Hollow ruin."
What?
“The 1975, remix. I actually like it better than the original. Gawd look at Decram.”
It’s too early!
“Oh dear.”
This is concerning the display on the stairs. Order members and anyone who was inside Grimmauld before knows that they are there. It is loathsome and repulsive on its own. What people didn’t know is that each one is a member of Mr. Kreacher’s Family. His Parents. Siblings. Aunts. Uncles. Nieces. Nephews. Take a moment to let that sink in.
“Happy birthday, Davey. This is my friend Jaydne.”
I Love You. Get back to the ice cream!
“Catch up with the program, Potter!”
It’s not Gringott’s policy to divulge such matters. In this unique case I’m allowed to speak freely and in confidentiality concerning anything you choose. I am not allowed to question your decisions, but I am allowed to guide you in matters concerning your vaults or properties. Happy to do so in fact.
“I’m serious. Leave it.”
“Hmmm. Try that once more on the same spot.”
They might publish the photo with a proper caption, but if it’s the Prophet they won’t write anything else. I can’t tell you why right now. You’ll know soon enough.
“You’re Dad’s coming with me. You’re going with Grayson.”
They sound cool. I’d like to see it sometime.
“Yes.”
Help?
“I don’t use a wand. I didn’t bring it.”
“Why?”
“Fuck.”
Yes! Let’s do it. Teddy can frame it at the gallery.
That plus twelve more every time. BYE!
Okay you guys. You PROMISED. BE NICE!
“Thank you. I’m pleased with it . . . . . Oh good. It looks like they’ve finished. It’s been changed to a buffet. Harry’s cake will go there in the centre. Beverages and hors-d'œuvres can still be served by staff but we’ll just have them wander with trays instead. The guests can sit where they please. We’ll have the later evening meal served in the same manner as the buffet, but that will be much more casual and split between the ballroom and the downstairs dining.”
“White panther. Adolescent. Not quite a cub as far as we can tell. . . . . . Of course we can’t know for sure until you’ve done a full transformation. . . . . Minnie is helping with your bird.”
“The seven and a half ended up being fun for you, right?”
Do you want this done with all Black vaults and properties?
I would very much like that.
You most certainly are and I love you for it.
“Victoire, would you like to take a ride?”
Are you going to be ready?
. . . . . . . . . .
My playlist is always changing. I usually just put it on the random choose setting.
“In honor of one of our favourite students, the Lovegood-Longbottom and Delacour-Weasley families have decided on a collaboration. Do you still like flowers?”
The position starts one week after you’ve finished school. Beginning salary is 1000 galleons per week.
That’s pretty much how Dad rolls. It might take forever to bake, but once it’s out of the oven it’s time to serve it!
My Gran is summoning you into a chat room.
Of course! All of us?
Oh Fuck.
Fair warning though. I’m going to ask the young people to get involved.
“You’ve got a cobble path leading up to that riser that the planters were set on. Those weren’t originally put in just to hold the pretty planters. And those are pretty planters by the way. They should be restored.”
“It goes fast, but we’ll take it slow to avoid those dump trucks and bulldozers. The streets are pretty cleared out though.”
“Well we've always figured that. No one else In the family has this fantastic hair.”
You home yet?
“Are those dragons spewing up off of the building?”
Catch you later.
“Number 0001. See? He’s engraved your name on the handle.”
Scorp’s hair products.
Harry said it might be a late night. Be prepared for it.
“Try that door.”

“Cruciatis on a six year old . . . . how MANY fucking times? There are hundreds of memories in there and we only viewed TEN! . . . . He did that AFTER he hit his own fucking CHILD with a stupefy. . . . Like that was a common babysitting technique when his wife was away at work. Fucking monster!”
“Okay Draco can deal with mum and Andi and the family. I’m on the way.”
Tiaras, brooches, monstrosities of all sizes. I can provide. Yes I’ll contact Pansy.
We have three floors vacant that would be perfect for it.
Thank You. I think I might implode if I had to keep this from Rosie and Dad. You can understand this isn’t just a usual “Uncle Harry goes over the top” situation. This is huge.
“Just shoot me a text, nothing elaborate, just say “Tomorrows issue” or something.”
“Where did you find these!?”
Me too.
“Not the same. Do it. And then you can get started with the actual cooking!”
——————————————————————————
“And it’s really only one cake Al, I’m not bringing massive sheet cakes.”
“Where do you come from?”
Second, there has been a request for chamber music in the entrance hall. I’ve mentioned to Mr. McAlroy that Gringotts has very nice live music played during holidays. Would they be available to hire for the event? If so could you coordinate that with Sean?
“What the FUCK!”
“What happened with Witch Weekly?”
The potions people are intense!
“I like the shape.”
EVERYONE ON THIS MESSAGE BOARD
“My favourite.”

Spider such as a tarantula ONLY if kept in an enclosed environment.
Here’s the list and a general timeline we spoke about.
Lucy refuses to cut into it.
“Is there any temperature in those showers that isn’t just scorching hot?”
Now I believe before we move on to the Referendums. Alicia Ogden had questions?
Sorry about that. I needed to get things out of the way early. Harry’s schedule got complicated and I wanted to get it sorted out beforehand. I’ve got my other paperwork all in order.
What a mess.
“Elevator.”
—————————————————————————
Give it a shot. It’s your story to tell anyhow.
“Yes?”
Yeah. We’ll have a picnic with Eric. I’ll have her back before dinnertime. I promise it’s safe.
“It would be fun for you to make Scorp learn to use one.”

“It's from Pansy! It’s also possible that we’ll look like complete idiots, but I don’t care I’m taking you out anyway. Besides, you’re always cute . . . . . especially in those jeans.”
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!
Paisley retreat.
“What?”
No. That’s my final question. WHY?
I’m sure. We’d already had an emotional day, we went to see Poppy and Minnie. And then we get back and it’s SURPRISE! Geeez. I can’t remember the last time I’ve seen him run like that in the house. I’m surprised he made it over to yours with fucking shoes.

“Alright that’s true. I wouldn’t. But the age limit on profanity just keeps expanding, Potter!”
“OH NO.”
We can come today? In an hour?
“I’m just going to sit in my Dad’s lap. We’re still allowed right? Just like old times. Get comfy.”
We thought something was wrong with Scorp! Draco Malfoy doesn’t just show up on your doorstep!
We could put it over the mantle at the new house!
“He did? Is that what happened to my phone?”
Well. Everyone want’s to give Lucy a nice send-off. Who am I to deny them??? Ron and George are bringing gift boxes from the Wheezes for all the kids! And of course Iris will be here with Dean and Seamus. Jay and Agruella wouldn’t want to miss it. Gin and Jerry are bringing Jerry’s famous French onion soup and his bread bowl things.
“TV room. . . .”

Harry,
The online version of the paper will permanently discontinue comments.
“And then.”
Anytime.
“Give it to them. Whatever they want! Healthy snacks???? That’s just not right! These children need to get hopped up on sugar and foul tasting beans!”
“I asked?”
“Most likely, but he would never say anything.”
Where are you?
“Draco?”
“We had the best time. It’s so awesome up there.”
All of it cleaned up nicely but I still would want to replace those ugly things in the upstairs hallways. Who put those there? Guys, they're ugly.
Everyone is settled in. Miss Parks has all the fires going. I’m getting things together for the art tour. I’ll let you know how that goes!
If Lucy’s interested in it that would be really awesome. At least she can learn about the Evans’ stuff. Lucy will just use it as one of her optional classes. Poppy want’s to make it custom learning based on the grimoire.
“I know you didn’t. And I know Kenny didn’t either. Fuck, I’m tired of this shit, though.”
“Excellent, we need to get this one out”
“Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen. Actually all her books are about courting in one way or another, and it always ends with a proposal, but this one the most.”
He had not had one of these nightmares in a long time. There had been a lot of them just after the war, which he supposed was no wonder. His mother had thought he might have a muggle mental disease that she had heard about from Malindra Goyle, that people got after wars and such, and perhaps he might, but at that point what happened in his body had become too serious to explain that way, and so the whole thing got left by the wayside. Besides, the nightmares had stopped. He hadn’t had one in years.
“Well, needs must, I suppose. Your mother owled me on Wednesday, saying she had heard from you and that you were alive and doing a lot better. I was so happy to hear it!”
“Oh no, it’s the other way around days. It’s like everyone is supposed to like everything. Actually you’ll find that most people say they like everything except country and opera – ”
“Excuse me, are you okay? Do you… need anything?” A stranger, a woman with a little child strapped into a contraption on wheels, both mother and child in bright pink, had stopped and looked at him, worriedly.
“I did not think about it. Mary…” he said, swallowed. Mary. The outside. New routines. New people. “There’s been a lot to think about, I suppose.”
Draco just nodded in response. He felt exhausted, which he supposed was no wonder either, with the screaming, the dream. He couldn’t remember screaming as the fire happened back then, but he probably had. The fire, the enormous storage room he had still felt was his own up until then, which had been his only safe place the year before the fire, in spite of what he was there to do. Up in flames, gone forever. And he himself, damaged. Vincent dead. And Harry, it turned out now, damaged, too. Talking to Harry about it was probably why the dream had come back. He said as much to Kenny.
“For him?”
“Crepes,” he said, “with strawberries, and sugar, and clotted cream.”
“Well, lots of things, I suppose. But I did read quite a lot of science fiction this winter. It’s very educational.”
Draco twisted uncomfortably in his chair. Was it possible they had entirely forgotten him? Pansy seemed to have moved into the mode of dealing with a potential friend now, doling out small confidences to see how the other woman would handle it. He never understood female friendships very well, but they were a lot more verbal than any other type, certainly, even than his own friendship with Pansy.
“I know about it. I… saw it.”
He tried to stay calm: No one who mattered would see him like this, no one would need to know. Still, just knowing it about himself was so shameful it hurt. Even if he hadn’t done it himself, his face still had a beard on it, at his age. There were stories of wizards who tried to grow one early, of course, but early had meant in their fifties, and those stories were not nice ones either, and usually marked the beginning of a descent to madness. But there was no way he could explain that to poor Mary, who clearly had no idea what she had done to him.
And then there were the possibility of meeting aliens. How might they judge humanity, and how would humanity respond? Would they teach people more peace, or more war? Were they deeply similar to humans, or so different as to be completely incomprehensible? Or somehow both? How would we deal with them? Ethical dilemmas, culture crashes – lots of people wrote about aliens, and in a stunning variety of ways.
“Oh, thank you, I appreciate that. She didn’t make it public, not at all, but she invited me and Marcus for tea after you were taken away, to let me know. And I am very glad she did, or I don’t know what I would have thought.”
“Hmmm. Could I borrow your books, maybe? When I’m better? I’m not up for heavy text books yet, but still. I would like to learn more about the microwave thing.”
“And did you figure out this all by yourself?” She sounded so proud.
“I’m glad you let her. These phones are terrible to figure out on ones own, it’s hard enough with help, really. My mother had been taught, and she still had a bear of a time until Tippy stepped in. You seem to be doing a bit better than her.”
“I will do that, Draco. Of course I will.”
“Nemeses,” Kenny said, eyes suddenly narrow.
Because Mary said it would take years. Just getting out of the bed would probably take about a year, during which time he would be introduced to such things as talking, sitting up, drinking water, eating soft foods, gentle stretching, and so on. It would be hard, Mary acknowledged, and demand a lot of self-discipline, but as time went by he would at least be feeling increasingly better, she promised.
“Did you have dragonpox during puberty?”
His mother shouting that she would not leave her son die among muggles, and a darker voice answering, something he could not hear, but it sounded firm, brutal. His mother crying – oh, he was dying, then, after all. The healer had tried, with the arm poking method, which had indeed been unpleasant, and it had failed, and now he was dying. Nothing else could possibly push his mother over the edge like this. And she said leave him to die. And dying among muggles. Why among muggles? He tried to stay awake, then, to say goodbye, but he slipped under anyway. He...
And suddenly, with sleepy clarity, Draco knew exactly what Harry Potter was doing in Hastings. He was doing the exact same thing Draco was doing, of course. He was recovering too. Harry had been in the fiendfyre as well. Sense made, Draco slept.
They sat, Kenny in the sofa and Draco curled up in the arm chair, leaning back with his eyes closed. Kenny had the booklet and a cup of coffee, and they let the entire Filth and Fire album wash over them, song by song.
“Sure, I will put on some Dolly Parton. She is good washing-up music, I imagine. And after that you’re getting Mary Gauthier. She is excellent, but probably the worst possible washing-up music. Except Leonard Cohen, perhaps.” Draco had never done any dishes in his life, of course, but it seemed like having catchy music would go with it, and Parton apparently had a broad appeal – which of course some people minded, too. She would do.
A fair chance. Statute of secrecy. Why on earth. This didn’t make any sense. But maybe if he could only… but he couldn’t only. Thinking was beyond him again. And then he slept.
“Yes. That day is a bit of a blur, but yes, I do remember.” He had already been starting to get sick then, but it was just small things. Getting tired more easily, dizzy spells, travel sickness. He had not been able to apparate by himself, so he had side-alonged with his mother, and then promptly vomited in a large potted plant at the ministry. Then after, he had spent two days in bed, telling himself it was just because he was sad, that hard feelings wrote deeply in the body. True enough, too, but not the most likely cause of those days in bed, in retrospect. Now, five years later, that was what he remembered that day for, not the loss of Lucius. The feeling of getting sick echoed all the way here, all the way into the year 2004. He felt guilty about that, but not so much that it overrode the feeling of losing his father.
He could think more or less properly now, too, long stretches of thought, and talk quite a bit. When he wanted to talk, Mary would take a seat in one of them, and sometimes she would knit while she talked. He wondered if that was a muggle thing as well. It could be, he decided, it would make sense: They had to get clothes somehow, after all, and he did learn in school that muggles had less leisure time than wizards did. It made sense to do two things at once, he supposed.
So while the specific arrangements had changed a bit over the years, Draco and Pansy had always known they would marry each other, and they had been very happy with that prospect. Who better to marry, after all, than their best friend and ally in the world? Together they would have independence from the adults and be able to arrange life just as they wished. They knew this, they wanted it, they talked about it as a matter of course.
Harry laughed and laughed. Draco didn’t see what was so funny about it, though.
“Well, the adults let us have our engagement, confirmed it for us, made it count. And we meant it, deeply. You know how serious children can be. And of course we were best friends ever after, and marrying my best friend was the best possible thing, so there was no reason to doubt it.”
“Yes, large ones sounds good. And oh, some chocolate for me too. A smaller basket for me, I think.”
It had also been classified as a disease by something called the World Health Organization, which apparently got to decide things like that, but that was all over now too.
Draco didn’t ask about Aunt Petunia this time. Whenever she came up, Harry stopped talking very quickly. Still, he wanted to know what could make Harry, one of the most easygoing people he knew, get so upset he disliked anything he associated with her. Floral patterns. Queen Elizabeth. Scones. Bacon. Hair products. Respectability. Draco now added Jane Austen to his mental list of things Petunia Dursley liked and so Harry didn’t.
He sat waiting, but he didn’t hear the voice again. Had he succeeded? Was help on the way? No way of knowing. He couldn’t remember Mary ever having to shout into the telephone, but what did he know? He unlocked the door with his free hand, keeping the telephone close to his ear in case the voice came back. Then he opened the door and peeked out.
Well, Draco sighed, that made sense. After all, how would they know how many of the people sent into the muggle world died of the disease, and how many died of other things, such as breaking the statute and getting killed? Or being abandoned by their muggle carers, who, after all, was apparently paid in advance? It was not like they could ask the ones who didn’t come back what had happened. Surely that sort of thing accounted for at least some of the deaths, he thought.
“Well, my mother says that it is very important to please our past selves, especially the child past selves. I hope your past self will be happy with the chocolate.”
All of this was a new development, Harry said. About forty years ago it had been legalised, but was still considered an illness until fifteen years ago, and the discrimination had been a lot worse, too. And it was still there. There was violence, and refusal to rent to gay people, and job discrimination. But at least it was better now, Harry said.
Draco had thought about this. Mary hadn’t seemed to react to his parents being strict about music, but Kenny seemed both confused and upset. Draco considered lying, amending what he had said, saying he was only allowed classical music – that’s what he had let Mary think, after all, when she assumed it – but he wanted to share the whole story of discovering music, too. Surely that was possible.
“Sure, I still don’t like country, but this isn’t so bad. Now who was this other person?”
And then a small voice, much closer to Draco, smug and full of glee:
“Then something else! Potions! People that aren’t potions masters use potions all the time. I’m absolutely sure you must have taken potions you don’t know how to brew. I know I have. I have even taken potions Hermione doesn’t know how to brew!”
“What happened to hip-hop? Did it become more socially acceptable in that period, by any chance?”
“I suppose there are… um, different ways of marrying your best friend…”
“Very good, I hope you can appreciate that this was a necessary thing to ask, because some people are reluctant to admit to, hum, certain things while their mother is in the room, but of course, your mother insisted on being present. An admirable instinct, of course, to protect a mother’s feelings, but in this case it could be lethal.”
Something was stuffed in his ears. Something pierced his arm. Something was over his eyes. No, he wanted to say, no, I’m not dead yet, no! You’ve misunderstood! Need to say goodbye! To mother, my mother, goodbye.
“Oh. Well, then take the time to feel that properly, for sure.”
“You were shouting for someone named Vincent,” Kenny said.
Harry laughed, a slightly hysterical-sounding burst of mirth. Draco found himself waving his hands, shaking his head, frantically denying any such possibility with his whole body. Then he, too, was laughing, gasping.
“Yes, it. It’s been. A bit. Difficult.”
“Alrighty. Do you want to do the bedtime stuff, brushing teeth and all, or do you want to skip it for today?”
Harry came over on Saturday morning. Kenny rushed around getting ready, shouting things like “If the microwave decides to be ornery, Harry can just call for some take-away for you both”,  “If you guys exhaust each other and I have to do more than I have to come Monday, I will just drug you both down so I can get some goddamn peace, you know I will” and “Eat whatever in the fridge or freezer that doesn’t have a weekday written on it. No matter what you do, don’t eat the lasagna for Monday, if you eat that lasagna I will kill you both, because I absolutely won’t be in any shape to cook anything come Monday, oh fuck me, two double shift in two days, those fucking insane admin people, I hate them so much, but I will hate them more on Sunday night, thank fuck for coffee at least, come to think killing you two will take even more energy than cooking, ughhh”
Draco hadn’t realised mobile phones even had loudspeakers, but apparently they did, albeit not very good ones. Hermione’s prim but scratchy voice filled the room.
“Oh. Well, I suppose you believed what you were taught to believe, Draco. You can’t blame yourself.”
“You’re here,” a voice said, a world away, but he was too busy fighting the dream to really listen, and besides, the voice was so far away. “See if you can breathe,” the distant voice suggested. He tried to not gasp, but breathe more fully, but it hurt even worse. But then, suddenly, he found his rigid body went slack, and he sagged against Kenny. “You’re here,” he said, Draco could hear it clearly. He nodded. He was here. Hastings. Bed. Here. It didn’t feel true, not yet, but he knew it was.
“Camping,” Harry said. “It’s odd, I miss camping so much sometimes. Spent a lot of my seventh year camping, you know, on the run from snatchers, and it was so fucking hard, but sometimes I still miss it. Strange, isn’t it? But this time I want to do it with just muggle things, and alone, at least the first time. Just me and the forest, like, for at least a good week.”
He had no idea how to talk to the man. Not like Harry did, certainly, in a tone that mixed intimacy and vulgarity. Harry had certainly never been especially well-spoken in school, but he had not talked like this. He had known the basics of talking properly, even though he had absolutely no refinement. Well, Draco had no intentions of being neither vulgar nor intimate with the man, but also, Kenny was so very unlike Mary that Draco found himself floundering a bit, especially as he was just so tired.
“And with that voice, now I can too. Your Dumbledore impression is even better than Daphne’s, I am impressed.”
“Yes! He even adds more magic sometimes. I mean, the charm needs renewing once a month or so, but it’s really not a big deal. Hermione customised the spell a bit so it’s more flexible and lasts for about a year if it’s cast on fairly small things, and, well, for a mobile phone you will also need an adapted stasis spell on the SIM card, but that’s not very hard either, and you only have to do it once. Lots of people have phones now, Draco, don’t be such a pureblood snot. Wait, you...”
“Tell you everything? Well, that would be a lot, Mother,” he laughed through tears, “but let us start with… Oh, yes. I was in bed at first. Seven months in some sort of muggle technology induced stasis, which of course I don’t remember at all, and then another year spent just in bed. They connected me to tubes for everything, which were a joy to get rid of, of course. And after about a year, I started moving around a bit. They have a chair with wheels on it, so that I could move about even before I was strong enough to walk. I still need it most of the time, and when going out, but I walk more now. And then… hmmm. And I have learned so much about muggle culture, and it has been so very interesting, and I am looking forward to giving you some muggle books.”
And then it struck Draco that this, this would be the way of things forever. He was going to come home, in a few years, yes, but he would be a different man after what had happened to him, and no one was going to be able to understand it, try as they might. His mother would try, so hard. His wife, when he found one, would try too. And they would try to get his children to understand, or else it would be a dark secret, or worse, an exciting story. “Tell us about when you lived with the muggles, father!” It all felt utterly insupportable.
“Sleep until lunch,” Draco insisted. “And if you need more sleep than that, just stay in bed. I’ll just have some biscuits. Oh, or I can order pizza. Harry taught me how to order things. Anyway, I will be fine until tonight, and you already made dinner for then. You can sleep.”
“Of course we weren’t!”
He was the loneliest man on the planet, and he would remain so. No one, muggle or wizard, could echo this, no one. This was forever, forever, because even though the illness would end, and the worst of it had already ended, living with it wouldn’t. There was no escape from it having happened.
“Not like that, so noted.” She still sounded far too amused.
“So we’re in some luck, he’s just finished his shift and he’s coming here right away, and then you two can talk and figure things out. Oh, and I said I’ll order us all pizza, so, what toppings do you like?”
“No, I’m… not well enough for outside yet. I’ve never been out, here.” A plain ‘no’ would probably have been enough of an answer, but apparently his filters were all turned off. A good thing it was only Harry, who didn’t really know him, in this life or the other, not anyone who mattered.
He bought whatever sounded good, or interesting, or different from what he had already heard, or similar to what he had already enjoyed. Those loose criteria kept the CDs flowing in. He even bought some just because he liked the names or covers. He bought a record called Abraxas because it reminded him of his grandfather, and although he didn’t think his grandfather would appreciate it that much, he rather liked it. He got one called Blue, because the close-up of the woman who had made it made him feel sad in a way he thought he perhaps needed to be sad, and it turned out the record did that for him too, although how exactly songs were like tattoos, as she claimed, remained unclear.
“Yes, and it has changed me, but at the same time, that doesn’t mean that is enough either, like you said.”
“I’m… okay,” he finally managed to breathe out.
“He’s a PUNK,” Draco half-whispered back, in spite of at least half agreeing with Harry’s assesment. “Punks would automatically be sorted into Gryffindor, I’m pretty certain.”
Draco couldn’t quite believe how his voice came out. He hadn’t known he was this angry. He had rejected his father’s actions and values long ago, but that rejection had been done quietly, without a word to anyone, and he had thought he had done it in a reasonable and measured way. His voice told a different story.
“No wait, and the thing is, even if muggles HAD been doing worse, that would not have proven anything, you know? Because of course someone with more experience will be better at something in general. Like, a third year will be better at most spells than a first year. You are better at muggle technology than I am. It’s the same thing, and I chose not to see that.”
“We’ll have to keep talking? You’re assuming he’ll stay? After this? Really?”
He read through most of the book from Mary’s bookshelf in her room, which held a lot of “nice romances”, as well as Audre Lorde and James Baldwin, whom he loved as much for the language as for their analyses of power. Power, as it turned out, looked very different from up and from down. He hadn’t known that, and he was stunned by the implication that it was often perfectly invisible from the top of any given relationship, even as it affected everything. Seeing it described from below was extremely enlightening, and him and Mary had many conversations about it, once she would open up about the subject.
“So once they had broken off the engagement, they just found Flint for Pansy instead. Pansy’s mother and his are cousins, and very close, so it was easy to arrange, of course. And now she signs her letters Pansy Flint, and I haven’t even had one of her letters for… four years? Five? A long time.”
“No, I… sorry, I absolutely didn’t mean it like that.”
“You said that already,” Harry said. “After they sentenced your father, remember?” He looked like he regretted the words as soon as they were out of his mouth, looking uncomfortable as they hung between them. Draco forced himself to answer. It wasn’t that bad. It wasn’t.
Draco wondered, quietly, whether he might be permitted a membership, too. No one in the muggle world knew him, but then again, he supposed he already knew two members, if they were willing to vouch for him. He did not really know how these things worked – in his father’s club one needed to be a person of some societal status, as well as have several recommendations from existing members. The editor of The Daily Prophet had tried and failed to get in repeatedly, to Lucius’ mocking amusement. Trying and failing to get in would be the worst, Draco decided. Carefully asking once he got better, though, that would be the way.
“Oh, was that a yes? Can you confirm that for me, Draco?”
Kenny did the dishes, and he even shook his arse a little as he put the frying pan away, but he wasn’t sold on Dolly Parton at all.
It was nice.
(See the end of the chapter for
Only the next morning did it occur to him that he had interrupted Kenny’s sleep too that night, and after the man had been working very hard for two double-shift days, too. Kenny actually had pronounced blue rings under his eyes that morning, and after Draco was clean and had his breakfast, he suggested Kenny go back to bed.
“Oh, Linda at the Disk-overy? She’s great. Even has a bit of a punk selection. I don’t know how she keeps afloat in this shitty little town, but afloat she is. She does a bit of mail order on the side, to shitty towns that don’t have their own record store, or just have a bad one, so that probably helps.”
“So, what do you think I should do?”
“Nice. Young. Man,” she said, smiling. And then pointed to Kenny and Harry and repeated “Nice.”
“Wait, actually asleep?”
And so Harry did, while pacing the length of the flat. Draco tried not to listen, but eventually he gave up. It was about him, after all.
Draco raised an eyebrow. He did not appreciate being called a tart. Kenny blushed and immediately backpedaled.
“Oh, good, let’s test something. Hmmm…” Harry flipped through the pages. “I can’t think of anything. Is there anything you want? An item you miss and didn’t know how to ask for in muggle English, something like that? Because then I can probably help you figure out whether there’s a muggle version, and you can call in for that, and order it sent here.”
Getting muggle gay history explained is not going to be tidy no matter what, but it needs doing. Also, please remember that this convo takes place in 2004, not 2021. The mass AIDS losses in the gay community are still fresh, and the danger isn’t quite over either. Basically, this is a generation ago, and that matters. Harry and Draco are the youngest gen x, or the oldest millennials, depending on how you count it.
Happily, after a little while of that, sucking food through a straw was the next step. First he was given something called nutritional drinks, which were utterly foul-tasting, and then pureed soups and pureed fruit drinks, which were a lot better. Not his idea of food, for the most part, but still, even the strange fruit-and-spinach drink Mary served him was better than the nutritional drinks had been. For a few weeks he had worried that all muggle foods would taste as bad as those drinks did. He had tried to think of how to ask Mary about that without exposing himself as non-muggle, but he couldn’t think of a way. The relief when he realised proper food would probably be available later was more intense than it had any right to be.
The door opened, and he could hear them enter, the light step of his mother, the heavier ones of the healer. The one who might be able to figure it all out, but maybe not, there had been other healers before, and hope in them. The footsteps hurt his head, though he could tell they were trying to be quiet. He could hear them take a seat in the chairs near his bed, hear the stranger adjust his feet.
“Yes, they are. Very lucky that they showed up. And Mohammed knew first aid, did they tell you? The ambulance people said what he did really improved your chances of making it, and here you are.”
“Actually, I do sort of understand about not feeling the choice at all, um, I just… made different choices. And I still think, honestly, that those choices say something about our characters. It’s like it’s our character and not the mind making the choice in the situation. And your character is brave, and mine is… well, it’s not.”
“And your father?” Kenny asked, politely interested, as were drinking tea, eating biscuits, and working through a few of the chocolates, which were, in fact, delicious.
“What do muggles do for people in hospital?” Draco asked, somewhat frantically, after Harry had hung up (why, why would it be called hung up? Why not, say, pushed out?). “Would you send candy? People sent me candy when I got sick, it’s the thing to do, traditionally, and letters and cards. Do muggles do that too?”
“She made that public, where I am? Not that I need it to be a secret or anything – the spreading of it is all yours, if you want, and if she hasn’t.”
“Okay, now I really need to listen to what you consider good country music. Go put some on while I do the dishes, then.”
“It really is the same thing, in the sense that people build on what they have available to them. Magic opens up for more magic, and muggle technology opens up for more muggle technology – electricity opens up for the telephone, just like transfiguration is necessary for some people to become animagi. And then culture is built in much the same way…”
“Shall we go in?” Draco asked. There was no point in having this conversation right now. “I do want to know if the handsome dark stranger in my life will ever put away his socks.”
I didn’t catch the rest of their conversation as I turned to Blaise to ask the same.
“Great.  Maybe you can ask him for a checkup of Hedwig and your bio-mechanical systems. You’re due for one anyways.”
“I don’t,” acknowledged Riddle. “But then, by that point it won’t matter anymore. You came just in time. We were going to seek you out, you know. You specifically, Mr. Malfoy.”
Malfoy muttered something inaudible under his breath, before turning to face Harry. “Well, what is it you want?” he asked, settling himself into a throne-like chair. He regarded Harry with cold, sharp eyes. “This obviously isn’t a social call, Commander Potter. Otherwise Filch wouldn’t have allowed you up.”
I waited for him to continue.
He took a deep breath. He was feeling the strain himself. He could have Hedwig release some nano-cells to wake himself up, but it always left him hazy and disoriented after the effect wore off.
Draco didn’t know how to respond. These men watched the Manor for five years without Draco ever noticing – nails dug into his palms at the anger of the violation. Burning in there too, was a rage at his father, for leaving yet another tangled knot of unhappiness for Draco to manage. By himself.
It wasn’t like Draco was a spy or an illegal artifact smuggler, though one of his colleagues from the Iraqi Museum had been caught for just that. What Rosa had said brought an intense flash of memory, of his father walking a cowled figure out of the study. Draco had wanted to speak to his father about the new appointment with the British Museum, but the expression on his father’s face stopped Draco in his footsteps. It went beyond the anger Lucius Malfoy usually displayed when interrupted. Though Draco had never once seen his father show fear, this time Draco had.
He had to remind himself to be discreet. Though he was in a position of trust and favor at the moment, Harry understood all too well that any act of carelessness could bring everything he worked for into ignominy. Harry knew he was scrutinized by others, most doing so out of curiosity for a minor celebrity with the novelty of having achieved his fame by being good at his job, but others had a less benign goal. Harry knew McLaggen, for one, would love to hear of anything that could hurt Harry.
“You’re very observant,” Dolohov said in a mocking tone. “Why else did you think my master wanted it? It certainly isn’t for the masses.”
“I don’t take orders from you,” Greyback said, dragging a sharp nail gently down Draco’s cheek. “Even from someone the master wants unharmed.”
“Oh, I had a house-elf with me at all times,” I said. “Can you imagine a child running around here by himself? I would’ve gotten lost in the maze or stuck in the bushes.”
The Weasley looked at Potter. “Any idea what they’re on about?”
“Touch him again, you son of a bitch, and I’ll make sure that’ll be the last thing you ever touch.”
“They were taken by you lot!” the man roared. “Taken because of one missed tax payment and they were sent to the goal!”
“A Pensieve?”
Harry grimaced. “Ah … well, civilian life. I need to go into HQ. You know, for work. How are you holding up?”
“Didn’t Goyle tell you that a lot of the wealthy come down here for the thrill of illicit fun?”
“I — I can’t do this,” I gasped out. “I’m — I’m sorry.”
I flushed. My sexual preferences weren’t well known. For the most part, I lived more celibate than a monk, but the one time I was enjoying myself in the Room of Requirement, Goyle had rushed in to warn me about someone passing by — and caught me in a compromising position with a dildo.
There was a sardonic clap. Draco turned in confusion. It wasn’t from Theo, who was examining the Decoder with scientific interest, or Harry, who was busy changing out of the wetsuit.
Wormtail quailed at his master’s disapproval. “I’m working as fast as I can, master. If you would just give me more time –”
“You’re always welcome to visit, too, Mr. Potter. How did you suddenly come by your interest in history?”
It was agony to be so close and yet so apart at the same time. Draco longed to have Harry’s callused hand in his once again. He also wanted to hit Harry.
“It’s an interest of mine,” he said.
“There’s a rumor that its full clairvoyant abilities can be unlocked by a sequence on the Shield.”
“I don’t think you’ll win songwriter of the year anytime soon if that’s the level of your talent.” Potter grinned at me. “You best stick to those boring academic papers of yours.”
He and Harry occupied a pole to the corner. Harry spent much of the time thumbing Draco’s arse whenever the train lurched. Draco didn’t have the heart to order Harry, to stop. He tried to demonstrate his irritation, though, by pressing his own back into Harry at the earliest opportunity to push Harry’s hands away. Somehow, Harry didn’t seem to get the message.
“Our men tracked the car,” he said. “We’ve kept this house under surveillance ever since your parents’ death, and this was the first breakthrough we’ve had.”
“Granger enjoys them,” I pointed out.
Harry had barely broken out in a sweat, though he was panting. Whether from nerves or exhilaration, Draco didn’t know, and didn’t want to find out.
Potter groaned and I didn’t blame him. “What started all of this? The book that gave you visions?”
“Oh. If you insist.”
And unlike the place we raided, there was no cellar with magical artifacts that might help me escape.
“You could do with a bit more decorations,” he said, giving my living room a critical once over. “Needs more color.”
Ron laughed. “I’m glad you still realize that.” Then he sobered. “So what are you going to do now?”
“It doesn’t seem like much, does it?” Harry picked it up, gave it a little toss. I winced. It seemed somehow sacrilegious to handle it so cavalierly.
Harry scowled. “Well, now that we settled that, we should probably get moving. We don’t have a lot of time to waste.”
If that tiny touch from earlier had overloaded Draco, then he didn’t know what to term this. Hallucinogenic ecstasy, perhaps. Draco couldn’t stop himself from drinking in the sensations, one hand automatically going to cup Harry’s chin as the other held himself steady on the desk.
There was a loud bang. Both me and Potter jumped, Potter whipping his wand out reflexively. It was barely in time – a bolt of red light went directly towards him.
“Miss them?” Malfoy looked wistful. “I think I do. Anyways, I went to look for them when I saw that one of the hallways that was off-limits to me was lit. I was a curious child, you see, even when I was half-terrified of the lightning, and I followed it. There was a slight sound too, that got louder and louder, pushing out the thunder.”
“You tell me, Mr. Malfoy,” Riddle said. “You’re the expert.”
I slashed out, my wand in an arc, letting loose a bright flash. The man – I was fairly certain it was a man now – raised his arm, deflecting my curse with a Shield.
“You think it might have big implications, sir?” Finnegan asked. “I mean, it’s a drug overdose. We’ve seen plenty of these so far in what we’ve been doing. The only difference is that this time, the identity of the user is an Unspeakable.”
“You have got to stop thinking all my friends hate you, Draco. She’s actually quite fond of you. Once you’ve gotten over that prat phase.”
I needed to leave the flat today, I decided suddenly. I had made no headway with the book and tracking down the Grimoire. In truth, I had not moved the book; it remained untouched in the safe. I was reluctant to touch it again, for some reason, working off the clues in that vision from memory. I could find no mention of Slytherin and caves in any of the historical records I had, or any mention of the Grimoire apart from brief mentions that were useless.
Victoire, that dish will go nicely!
“The painting is lovely.”
You know, I spilled everything to Luna a while back when I did her interview. She said she wouldn’t publish it.
I think Al and I are up for it? Not a late night though.
“Can Davey come too?”
“I know where that next one goes! The snowflake!”
“Dad. We love it so much. The view of the fountain is amazing. Especially at night. So relaxing to just watch after a long day.”
“Check THIS out.”
And who would that happen to be?

Why? She and Jerry certainly have the room!

“Now just quickly let’s touch on Mr. and Mrs. Brick. They will be moving in on Wednesday.”
RETURN TO 12 GRIMMAULD PLACE.
I’m closing this out! LOVE YOU BYE!!!
And there you have it. What’s more traditional than a vintage styled wizard or witch robe?
Dad was bawling.
“Gurdyroot. Luna insisted you needed one so I brought 24.”
I’m going to need your expertise. I don’t want anything left out. The more I look into this it’s even more fucking abhorrent. Kreacher isn’t allowed to cohabitate because he lives on Hogwarts grounds? Even if there were private quarters available? Can you think of one reason why Kreacher isn’t allowed to be an Assistant Professor? That’s the job he’s doing. Any reason whatsoever??? These fucking “Elf Laws” are going to be priority number one. Day one. Kreacher can’t use a fucking wand without special permission? WHY? How do I get special permission for Kreacher? I need him to use one at the Grimmauld opening!
“So soft!”
Who? If I may ask?
“Nope! Start printing, Beanie! We lay them out on this
“FUCK!”
Well our townhouse is three levels from street and a basement.
“Auntie Luna! What is your Magic?!”
A tiara on ROSE?
I’ve got orange fizzy! May need to run around the corner for more though.
“We’re both lying aren’t we?”
“That fucking piece of shite is going to AZKABAN!”
James = Dolphin
Yeah, probably.
“What is this painting above the mantle?”
You would be correct.
“Breathe. There’s still sparks.”
I am surprised that you’ve not been hounding them for answers to tell you the truth.
How so?
“I refuse any over the top adventures today. Harry, we need a break.”
Part Five:
Guests return to London between 11:00 and 13:00
AP: I remember some of my first day. Oh man I was scared. . . on the way in we got ambushed by photographers. Dad carried me in and Mum says she spent a good 15 minutes hexing them outside. They still got their photos published the next day. I wonder what the point was. I mean, I was just a 4 year old kid! First day of school and all. Dad put me down and THIS kid came to me with chocolate?
Guest rooms assigned as follows:
“You’ll have to answer that owl.”
“Get it, Jon!”
Today you get whatever you want. We don’t get mad about things like that. Besides, he’s been through it before!
I know, I’m really sorry.
Neville
HARRY J. POTTER
Write me back? I know it’s late but just a note? Give Snabb a treat. He’s strong and good for the flight back!
LOL that was good.
Now I really don’t get it.
“I’ll bet Scorps gran would know.”
Hadn’t seen. It’s incredible.
You would be able to review on paper what was disposed, but that would be permanent.
If you want. Of course. Mr. Trandy is at the ready with whatever you want from the cellar.
No. I shouldn’t have assumed.
“You’re pants at those charms but I’m not. We’ll have these done in no time at all. I’d say we’d do a replication charm on them but they’re all individual aren’t they?”
Dad. This cracked me up. Let her do it. - Al
“Probably not!”
“Look at this display of my Grandfather’s pocket watches. Teddy taught Louis his display charms.”
“He.”
Thank you. I’d really like to do it.
I know that. You’re the only person I would ever trust to quote me on anything like this though. People think I’m dumb. They know I’m magically powerful and all that, but a good portion of them think I’m pretty stupid. I get it though, I’m passionate about things most wizards don’t care about or take for granted. I love muggle pop music. We could probably talk about Harry Styles or Lil Nas X for an hour or so. . .no? Old people aren’t supposed to like that stuff but nobody told me. . .K Pop? . . .BTS? . . .okay no. . .
“Gin. We’re not planning anything. . . . .Not on purpose anyway.”
Good afternoon Albus. How is your day going?
“Obviously, you owned multiple sets of the exact same attire. Why?”
Now we own all of her bogus “research” and the Prophet "special publications" unit? GONE. We're shutting that thing shite down immediately.
Find the rune and stand over it. Have the other kids stand behind you. It should be fine since the two units on either side are unoccupied.
“Harry say’s you came to rescue your girlfriend.”

“Wow. Cool!”
“Done.”
“I’ve got you all figured out. Don’t you worry about that.”
“I’ve brought Harry’s peach sparkling water.”
I need you to come to the snowflake. Jay’s here with the paperwork.
Confessions are made.
“Okay Ted’s turn. Get in there!”
“Because it’s painful?”
history. It’s not like I’ve given her or anyone else access to the fucking house since the war. I’m not giving them access to it after today either. I’ve done everything I can to have it documented. So at this point. I’m done. They just have to live with it.”
I’m not kidding. This is not a prank.
“Now?”
We’re all so young.
Pry of course!
Enough?
(See the end of the chapter for
So cool. I can tell the shop staff that I’ll be out.
“Eyes closed!”
“Okay well I’ll head out then. . . . . what?”
I’ll try. I need to talk with Scorp anyway.
So you talk into it and it translates? Seems to work pretty good.
“Maybe I’ll join you in the kitchen and make biscotti?”
“We’re coming in about an hour or so. Aspen has a surprise. A big squid plushie she want’s to share.”
“. . . . . . . . . . Dolly.”
It comes with housing and I’ve already moved out of the Leaky. And it pays good. I’m going to be an assistant. So I’ll be running errands and helping do whatever Mr. Potter needs. I’m meeting with the house manager first part of next week.
“Oh no. Here we go. . . . what is this going to cost?”
“I can’t say I’m not scared.”
I’m glad you’ve been brought up to date with the cottage plan. Draco has described the property and it sounds wonderful.
“No. Just family. This isn’t about me, or connections. There really aren’t any mystery Malfoy relatives. Just Black’s. Me and Andi. It’s actually less people than who were at the family party at Grimmauld. This is your wedding and we all just want you to be happy.”
“Phhhht. . .obviously. But really, I think this kitchen can be fixed up. It’s double the size of the kitchen at the cottage, but not overly huge, and I don’t plan on slaughtering a cow anytime soon. . . I really do like this wall on the end with the windows. It certainly didn't look like this from outside. What do you call this?”
“I thought to research some things.” Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “What about you, Potter? How come you’re still in bed? I didn’t know Aurors are so lax nowadays. I shall have to speak with the Minister when I have a chance.”
“An Auror.” The man cracked his knuckles. “Do you know what you lot did? To my wife? My children?”
“They offered him funding and connections in exchange for his help in finding the book. After all, the Circle has a millennia’s worth of experience, magical knowledge, and resources. No matter how talented the Dark Lord was, without help, able to achieve such power in such short time.”
“No, they’re reinforcements.”
The proximity was too much – Draco leaned in, his lips making contact with Harry before Draco even registered his body was moving.
“We go after Riddle,” Draco said. Nothing about the man had seemed out of the ordinary, except perhaps more distinguished than most. Draco had felt that intangible force of his personality even from that distance, one that inspired fear and awe of power. “We take the fight to them. So far, we’ve been on the defensive. Our luck will change if we shift tactics.”
“I’ll go check the register,” Harry whispered. “Go sit in one of those chairs or something,” he said, pointing to the aggressively modern and frankly uncomfortable couches near the exit.
Potter seemed more satisfied with that. “I should get changed, then,” he said, gesturing at his ripped t-shirt and gray joggers.
Except for a box lying in the center.
“I have many books,” I said, affecting as much calm as I could muster from being sprawled on the dirt. I had my wand in my grasp now. I gripped it, willing the pain to disappear. I waited for the response, to draw it out for more clues.
“We tried to invite him into our fold, have we not?”
“Oh Merlin, don’t compare me with your mother. It completely ruins the mood.” Blaise grinned at me, flashing a smile that reduced the even most hardhearted into rubble. “I just care, that’s all.”
“You guys alright?” Granger asked as her men clicked silver cuffs that shone with anti-magical properties onto the librarian’s wrists. They would inhibit his powers, and, as an added precaution, they had also muzzled him.
“We don’t know what level Riddle is at,” Harry pointed out. “Imagine if we scaled to the top and find out that the office is actually on the first floor.”
Don’t change the subject! Okay, what?
You’ve got something else in common. Lana Del Doom.
You guys know I’m joking right?
“How rude?”
“That was your fault for letting them watch those old Muggle animations. The box was cute though.”
“When the time comes I’ll just back the lorry up to the gate. How good is your levitation Mr. Elliot?”
“Do you like the grasses?”
“Very dead. Cremated and scattered into the ocean dead.”
my turn then give me that tart and a fork.”
U.S. New York, Real Estate Branch.
“You could, but it would be a highly unusual. You would have to get the Minister and the Aurors involved.”
Not really WHY??
I’ve never been.
I guess I don’t?
“How do you know it’s a her?”
I hope so. Just dating for now. Hanging out.
Uncle Ron is a NO GO.
How so?
“Not so fast. Let’s look into it.”
“Lucy, I’m okay if you decide to do that. We need to get you a better phone so you can talk with someone who’s not just me though. The one I got her she had to hide from the school and only use it to call me for an emergency. It’s really old now.”

This calls for a bold plaid.
“Shite.”
“Mione? What are you doing here? Hi Draco!”
“Are you sure?”
Tic Tock Draco.
Bye Sweetheart
“That poor guy is going to hurt tomorrow.”
Crap.
PLENTY.
“Roasted.”
“Shite.”
We’re just not there. I’m the stay at home and piddle in my garden type. He’s traveling all the time and lives in a penthouse. He does finance and potions. I come up with ridiculous ideas. This works for us.
And once her magic settled down she told me that she and Jerry have just finished up a guest suite that will be “perfect” for Eric and I. And that there was no way we were not going to stay in Scotland and to not pull this kind of shit on her ever again? Oh, and to use contraception of course.
. . . . . . . . . .
“Yes.”
“Ginevra, what does it say on this broom?”
. . . . . . . . . .
“But he’s Uncle Harry’s new assistant! We’re both his employees. We’re going to have to work together on stuff!”
“Oh.”
——————————————————————————
WHAT? How do you know this?
Yes. There’s not much to do it’s just a day trip. Make sure you have a decent coat. And bring a scarf. The wind can be pretty bad this time of year.
Minerva McGonagall
Meeting is called back into order! Can we get rid of all of these extra desks for next time?
“Yes. Don’t tell Draco.”
“UGH”
Scorp and I can't of course. But we promised our Grandmothers that we would stay hands off if they would do it.
It’s prophet bullshit again!
“Yes, I can get it?”
All hands on deck please.
“In Scotland?”
“Prepare for your demise! This is the last round, Ferret!”
“Why three tables?”
“Other than vanish those potions bottles you should at least make the bed!”
THREE THOUSEAND MORE.

We knew Dad had that kind of stuff in storage, but we never saw it.
“Harry came for testing in, I believe his fourth year. Intense magical testing related to the tournament. I had previously tested him for his birther abilities because of his Father.”
“Now we can do the same with the caboose. I love this one with the deep red . . . . . see? Fits right on . . . . . now. Just needs a drop of this smoke liquid in the smoke stack . . . . . shall we try it?”
I contacted Gringotts about the inheritance and they want to do the ritual/ceremony thingy TOMORROW MORNING.
“Don’t bother. She starts her lessons in Wales tomorrow. Scotland in the autumn.”
“Okay, like this?”
“You just process things differently. It’s a good balance.”
Do you think so?
“Yes, as I said, extensive. They seem to be in order but there’s nothing written. I could catalogue them and organize it better if you’d like.”
“HA!”

“The jest, or prank is that this manor is so absolutely opposite to how I live my life. If my family were to be told I was going to live here it would be very shocking. So, Draco and I are going to dress in your outfits and greet them in the dining hall. You will welcome them to my new residence in your entrance hall. Black and Prince are additional Lordships that I've inherited.”
“You don’t like it?”
“Does this work?”
Because Professor Grandma?
“You don’t say! You wouldn’t think so what with this low maintenance home and no responsibilities like new Grandchildren or anything. It’s not like you went and married Harry Potter or something stupid like that.”
BORGIN AND
We don’t even know how to say thank you for letting us do this. The lodge is more magical than actual magic.
DONE!
“Send all of that furniture out to muggle antiques consignment to be sold. It’s all good quality and in excellent shape. It’s worth a fortune. I know it’s ugly but it’s worth a fortune and not a small one.”
She’s just visiting!
I’ll keep that in mind! Well, thank you all for having me into your chat room. It’s been fun, really! But I should go.
Are you sure?
It is with some urgency that I contact you today.
SUMMON THEM!
That makes sense. Can I say something like “Oh Fuck” now?
“ . . . . . . . . . .
I will! I also was thinking. The kids aren’t going to care a bit about floo privileges once the have their portkeys. Program them all so the last button brings them to the Grimmauld back porch. Even better the front once Seamus finishes the entry courtyard! What do you want for dinner?
Have a great week.
I’ve copied it. I’ll use it as my phone home background!
“ME!”
“Now I will turn my back and Davey will place the card back in the deck. Make sure you hide it really good!”
You are BRILLIANT!
I like the rainy ones. You’re going need to give me a master class.
How long?
Good. Okay that’s all I need to know. Don’t tell me anything else.
I actually understood that. Coming from Harry’s experience as a child, hot water is a luxury. And growing up my Mum limited our use of water like that. In her case I it was more a time management issue with all of us kids and only two freaking bathrooms.
Absolutely!
Harry
“Was it worth it?”
“I can’t take this.”
Please have the clerks name reflected in the transcript!
“NOTHING IS OFF LIMITS. THE IRIS ARE REALLY NICE THOUGH. CHOP AWAY.”
“I know it’s very exciting! We haven’t decided on much of that yet.”
“You’re going to have help and we’re going to work together on it.”
“Yes.”
“Wait. Let me pull out this binder and see if it says anything about that.”
“That is a good idea. He could also make sure you put your socks in the laundry.”
“Did you just pick that up with your hands?”
. . .Shirts and hoodies are available in the gift shop! (kidding about the gift shop . . .
Well, we think so anyway.
I’m really happy that she’s staying on with the boys.
We sure did! Nobody got Teddy’s baby pic though. That was funny. They all guessed it was me. And we all mixed up on every single Weasley. Even the Weasley’s.
“Oh hell no.”
But Dad isn’t “Dad”?
“Well. . . . .If you don’t like that . . . . . here’s one for a driving school . . . . . here's one for another high-rise, but we don’t need anything like that really . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .
“Hello.”
“So what’s the goal?”
——————————————————————————
“Rose and I are taking Lucy shopping. Girls only. . . . .after Malkin’s we’re going to the potions shop. . . . . . We MIGHT stop by Tattings. Go away. Take Uncle Dud to the joke shop or something. . . . .We’ll meet you back at Daisy’s in two hours.”
Great combination for Dad.
“I got in trouble for that.”
Jay is much better!

No. You don’t understand.
So do you think Jon’s predictions will come true?
. . . . . . . . . .
“It’s a good prank!”
And you’re okay with being outed as pregnant to the public before the wedding?
“What’s the spell then?”
That’s my point/question. Would it be weird to you guys?
“Put one of the cars in there. . .put the ghost on display. We could do a valentines theme in February. . .bring the carriage from Decram’s manor and display wacky cherub stuff. Bring in some of the creepy pirate ship stuff for halloween. I could choose some of my favourite paintings to show too.”
“You’re right.”
“How about . . . .pops. I’ll call you pops then.”
This is wild.
He’s a very successful entrepreneur and a great conversationalist.
“Alright so we’ll meet here on Friday afternoon and try it out. I’ll pre-program the first ones for here at Grimmauld as home base, the Harpies Center and where else?”
——————————————————————————
Okay. Well I should try to finish up here and come home.
Yeah. You’re right.
“I can do that!”
I’ll get it all fixed up for you with special protections and everything!
Sorry for the swear Grayson.
“Ferret.”
I’ll start. I’m making fruit pies again, I think? Or I’ll take suggestions.
but. WOW.
Mr. Harry J. Potter
Who all is in here?
“Zebb did you do a count?”
“Lettuces! Oak leaf, salamander, gotte jaune d’Or, blonde maraichère. I’ll have to look those up I can’t even pronounce it.”
Well they’re going to need all of that. It looks like they’ve outgrown most everything they’ve got and it’s not a lot to begin with. Transfiguration only goes so far and I’m not good at clothes charms.
“Language! Public!”
“How is he doing that?”
“We’re pretty close to saying yes. Some of it would involve getting the sanctuary together by Hogsmeade. And then transporting dragons from Australia. There are a few that only respond to Eric. We would want them there.”
“So he dumped you for a younger man and was a bore. And what about the Cherubs?”
“Look at Jamie.”
Thank you. It will be my pleasure.
“How many what?”
“UGH! . . . Hardly. Just you wait, Malfoy.”
A note from Luna Lovegood-Longbottom:
SHITE. This isn’t the family room where the little kids are allowed is it?
Okay this could actually be fun.
“Talk with the other portraits, learn some things?”
“Thank Merlin. So nice to be home. Kiss me. . . . . . . .”
Owl Post To:
“I’ve got that too. . . . .”
“It’s the same they just changed all of the DJ photos. You can still listen live or go back to listen to your shows. I put a link here for your podcasts. Volume controls are here.”
“She’s just putting on a show for the kids. She’s not really mad.”
“Lily.”
Hey. What’s going on?
Master tub cleaned/refurbished but otherwise left as is.
Not harmless when they’re Teddy’s favorite crisps. Muggle scampi fries are hard to find.
I’ll need to do some diagnostic charms on it. Is that okay?
“It could, but it’s meant to last me forever. I don’t plan on ever getting another one.”
Thanks Luna, that’s some Supreme Mugwump conflict resolution right there!
You know this is going to end up in the prophet.
“It looks like a fucking craft store implosion. And all new wallpaper with big fucking golden chevrons all over the place. There are fake flowers and plants everywhere. Words in big letters all over the walls. “Live! Love! Laugh!” and all that kind of crap.”
My Dad passed out. That was a sight. After that there was just a lot of tears. And you know how they both get. It was really something. Especially Harry because well, Al and BABY.
I want him to set up and administer an account and vault for each of the Grandchildren. Those will be his accounts and responsibilities.
“Hugs! More hugs. Always ask first!”
I am pleased to report that our representative in Iceland believes that the Potter Lodge is quite habitable. He is looking forward to meeting you tomorrow morning at 10:00.
You would be correct.
I’m not sure if I can answer them.
“Definitely.”
“Okay, now I will retrieve your card . . . . . . . What? It’s not here! Davey you better check! . . . . . . . . Look through the cards and find the eight of hearts!”
“It’s like we’re floating in your dream meadow.”
Who cares. The FILM WAS RUBBISH!
“I need you to come upstairs.”
Am I late?
I will say that we’re excited about it and it’s going to be cool.
Dried Ingredients. I’m never letting you near a knut’s eye ever again.
“Is that?”
Louis William Delacour-Weasley.
“Okay.”
I haven’t even asked him! And I’m just terrified that he’ll say no because of all the attention.
LEAVE BRIGHTON BEACH
She looks just lovely.
Thank you for your assistance with the correspondence.

“How spooky are you wanting to go this time?”
I snuck down to the gallery so we could chat without the boys getting suspicious.
“I’ll get the other things together while you make your marzipan.”

“Uncle Sev, we haven’t opened it yet.”
“Oh. Hello Grayson.”
“Looks like someone needs to design a faster snitch. They’re both just teasing it now.”

“And you said the cure had already taken effect on Remus.”
“Have they outgrown ladybugs?”
“Mmmmmmmmmm ok. What do you have in mind? Because you’re my favorite pastime for stress relief.”
“Through there I’ll bet it’s a study.”
“There’s a big closet of robes just off the entry hall, but every first-year should have the full experience for the boat ride to the castle. . . . . . I’m going to fix you up. . . . . .here you go . . . . . who knows a shortening spell? Oh that would be ME. ”
And all of the kids. Think about it.”
“Sunday.”
38 seats Potter.
“I agree with Lucy. That was COOL!”
Love You. See you soon!
Your opinion is correct.
Good morning, Jay! Official business! Are we all set up?
He’s always been creative, but this is jaw dropping. We’ve never seen him so excited about something. Ever.
It’s not really an interview.
“Okay. And no I’m not sad at all.”
“Pretty.”
“UGH.”
“We got off easy. I think Uncle Ron was going to give him fireworks! A screaming yo-yo is bad enough.”
Physical contact with your guest and an
“Harry, do you want to go home now?”
“Yes. And step one is Iceland tomorrow, and the cottage plan with the guys on Saturday. See, you’re already making progress.”
Oh Merlin.
“We can try it. It will take both of us to move it through the floo. The fireplaces are certainly big enough. We’ll have Dec stay here while we move it. If it doesn’t work we can take it back. The main portrait must be returned to the manor though. The collection must remain intact.”
Paperwork. Finishing up the foundation details for the Children’s Society fundraiser. Scorp is in the lab making something smelly. Good smelly. You?
Okay. Wow.
You have to ask?”
“Ron!”
Just let yourself in. Draco and I are on the main floor hanging art.
“I believe I missed a spot that needed a kiss.”
“Merlin’s fucking jumper, Al look at these closets.”
“I have superior heating charms. You don’t need a dumb robe to walk from the shower to the bed.”
Kids react.
Next up: Ginevra Weasley-Linder.
I can bake a PIE!

“No. I never really got into it with Hermione . . .figured she’d just want to dig and give me a headache, but yeah, I think all stasis and fidelius and umm all that stuff. Gringotts said they’d sort it out. And like I said, Ginny and the kids never showed any interest so I just let it be."
. . . . . . . . . .
Never mind. You just don’t know how my entire morning has gone.
Not what the kids were expecting.
“Good choice . . . . . . There you go . . . . . . Do you want bubbles?”
Oh, Scorp! I need potions assistance!
“Well I wasn’t expecting stir-fry as entertainment either! We’ll herd them into the dining room somehow! Oh Thank Merlin. . . .it’s Fleur’s fluffy potatoes. . . . I know, Decram can help us out!”
I’ll have them for you tomorrow.
I've already bought it.
“Ring the bell?”
