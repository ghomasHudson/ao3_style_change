In less than a month it will be our lovely Teddy’s first birthday, and I cannot believe how much he has grown. His hair is often as black and as wild as yours, Harry dear, and there are many times that he reminds me so much of my Dora that it brings a tear to my eye.
“Merlin,” I cursed, my voice louder in our little than I’d planned. “Don’t stop. That feels... Oh, it’s all so great.” What a pathetic, hopeless word for me to have used, love. You spread the wetness around and massaged the rim of my arsehole with small circles. You cautiously pushed down on my entrance with the tip of your finger. Fuck, but you were so crafty. “Please, don’t stop,” I begged, and you didn’t.
“Spoiling you is the name of the game,” I said, walking the pair of us to the entirely enormous bed that the Room had created for us. When the backs of your legs hit the side, I untangled our embrace, and we pulled off our clothes in a flurry.
Before you could decide what to do, I’d join you under your shower. I’d raise your chin and kiss you before you know that it’s happening. Hot and wet. As deep as I can. My other hand will be on your back and pull you closer to me until our bodies touch. Your firm chest against mine, our pricks trapped between us. It’d be all too much and not enough. It’d take your breath away.
And Ron, the git, was just wheezing while McGonagall gave us a real telling off. My heart was racing, and I felt the heat in my cheeks. But fuck, I couldn’t have held myself back – even if I had known the outcome. I don’t remember much of her scolding. Just that we are breaking intimacy rules and that we shouldn’t even dare to think of accusing her of being homophobic because she “would’ve separated any couple at once who was misbehaving so shamelessly.”
And back in the Slytherin common room fucking Theodore Nott – who is under pretty similar probatory regulations like me because of his father and who hasn’t spoken one single fucking word to me since the beginning of the year – had the audacity to ask me whether it’s true that some of my regulations have been lifted because of my ‘advantageous relations’.
What can I say? I told you that you’d like the little chap. Purely the natural pride of an older cousin? Of course, Draco, love. Of course. Remember when you wrote in this very diary that my words always seem to carry an extra layer of honey whenever I talk about my godson? In fact, you half expected my i’s to be topped with little hearts. I’m laughing. I’m surprised that there weren't a dozen hearts and kisses adorning your page.
And I shall keep my promise. You’ll see me at breakfast tomorrow and I won’t miss a single class. Don’t expect any miracles, though. The bags under my eyes are hard to charm away, just as much as I can’t charm a smile on my face. But I strongly doubt that’s what you meant when you begged me to be there and not shut you out again.
Are you still as happy with our plans as you were before? I’m sure it isn’t anywhere near as impressive as Stonehenge or any of the Wiltshire circles, but there is definitely something enchanting about the place.
Ron looked so pleased, didn’t he, when he made his announcement? He looked at Hermione with such soft longing, like she held the moon. Perhaps that’s how I look when I talk about you. I wouldn’t be ashamed if it were.
You wouldn’t ever be far from Whitby though; it’s joined with the Floo network. We could spend the afternoon walking on the beach hand in hand and be home with plenty of time to make leisurely love to each other.
Seeing that the RofR became our room again probably bore the sweet memory of last night, love. Perfect conditions for summoning happy thoughts, love and hope alongside some fancy lights.
When anyone outside of you and I look at these pages, the charm comes into effect. The words twist and swirl on the page and everything becomes unreadable. I expect it’s some sort of concealment spell that only our Mind Healers would have the ability to break.
Are you okay after this morning’s bedlam? Our fellow students are entirely ridiculous, but I can scarcely blame the younger ones for being whipped up into a frenzy. The bloody
Narcissa does love you; I don’t believe for a moment that she wouldn’t have seen the happiness spread all across your face when I kissed you at the awards ceremony.
Thing is, we’d have been happy too. We’d have knocked out a few children of our own soon enough, named them after our nearest and dearest, and grown old together. That was the plan, anyway. Like I mentioned before, our relationship shattered as swiftly as a
I told you about the painting in the Manor which shows the Roman thermae in Caerleon alongside the Ministry building we dined in and which used to belong to the Malfoy estate many years ago. And about my great-great-great-Grandfather Arimanius who donated said building to the Ministry. I told you about the house-elf my ancestor forgot there and who refused to take any commands from the officials because they were a loyal servant for the Malfoy family and then finally you warmed up and told (and warned) me about Kreacher instead of going paler by the minute.
You went on, “Feels a bit gloomy, don’t you think? Different from the Burrow which has its quirks but always feels friendly and crowded. I fell in love with that house when I first visited, but I was a bit green then. Never been to a magical house before that. The place is very colourful, a bit dated perhaps. It has this second-hand feeling about it, you know? For you- no, actually – for us it might be too… all over the place. I love how friendly it feels, I just wouldn’t want to decorate my home like that.”
Personally, apart from the not-so-small incident of my overactive penis, I think our first Gryffindor revision session was the most fantastic success. Having both of our beloveds beside us helped Ron and I to stay focused far longer that we would have usually – you mightn’t have realised but there was considerably less Quidditch talk between the pair of us than was normal – and we only lapsed into our favourite game of magicked paper planes that on that one occasion, which I was very happy to say I won! I have to say, love, that your face was a bit of a picture. Are Slytherins all very orderly and proper about their schoolwork and revision? I hope you don’t think me too much of a child.
I know it’s technically your turn to reply, but I needed to pick up our diary as soon as I was back in my dorm.
And apropos of roommates. Two of mine just came back from the Ball and I cast a Tempus. It’s fucking one at night?! Tell me in case you get tired. Part of me wants to write with you until the sun comes up but, well. How do you sleep lately anyway? We can totally talk about this some other time if it’s a sensitive topic. My Dreamless Sleeps are still doing their job for me. I’m feeling so warm and cosy tonight that I’m tempted to try without them. At least this night.
My assumption was that she’d been asked to attend this damned Ball by a third party and that she was clearing the air between us. Then, when the night of the Ball comes, it wouldn't be awkward between us.
Each night, when I fall asleep with my arms wrapped around you, I’ll whisper secrets, and words of love into your ear. I’ll kiss the nape of your neck, and there won’t be any force in this world that can come between us.
, and they didn't want it to mysteriously vanish. It made the house elf – Eden, I think their name is – promise to run it straight down to you as soon as I cast a Doubling Charm on the parchment. Sweetheart, what do you think of what our barrister has told us?
Fuck, I came so hard, spurting my junk all over your hand your cock, red and leaking, flush against your stomach. I needed a moment to acclimatise myself, but fuck, I wanted to make you feel good, darling.
I’ve packed up all the documentation – both the originals and the copies that I made with a Gemino Charm – into a folder too, and I’ve added the character reference that Headmistress McGonagall has given me. I particularly liked the line where she stated that ‘not only had my actions saved the wizarding world from a villainous, totalitarian tyrant,’ but that I was ‘also an able Quidditch coach and fair at potions, as well as polite and genial around school.’ I’m not entirely sure how her sarcasm will go down with the Aurors, but I’ll spend the rest of my life happy that McGonagall thinks I’m an affable fellow!
I love you. I think I have to sleep now. Find me tomorrow. However demanding our timetables might be, I don’t want there to be a single day where we don’t find time for at least one kiss.
I know, I know: I’m being a typical Gryffindor, running before I can walk, but this is the first career that I’ve actually been able to see myself doing in my mind’s eye. I reckon I’m pretty personable – I have my moments! – and I think that people will open up to me. Plus, it’ll help shake the heroic reputation while still allowing me to help people. Best of both worlds, eh? What do you think?
We’ll slowly wake, a tangle of bed-warmed limbs, fluffy dishevelled hair and bodies that fit together like two pieces of a jigsaw? Nothing will compel us to move, for we’ll be lost in each other’s embrace.
Occlumency. Love, I want to have another go at it, as soon as I can. It’s so incredibly intimate, and I want that with you, physically and mentally. I’ve thought of a memory, one that I really want to share with you. It’s an important one for me, one of the ones that I hold most dear to my heart. Even thinking about it now fills me with warmth and effusion, so I know when you experience it, you’ll understand why it is important to me.
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named made me Crucio Death Eaters – not the so-called enemy – whenever something in their own lines was amiss. Of course they hated me even more, how could they not?
Love, just a quick reply, because I’ll be seeing Luna and after that my Mind Healer in a bit (fabulous combination, isn’t it?). But after reading your words, I just needed to pick my quill up and respond.
Do you suspect that your mother might know that you like men? I do hope that she won’t be very upset or say anything hurtful, even in the heat of the moment. As you can probably tell, I judge everything through the bigoted lens of Uncle Vernon and forget that others love their children without condition or judgement. Merlin, but I have to admit that I’ll be a bit nervous to meet her, when I eventually do.
What I mean is that I think it would be great, if wixen would be educated about such traditions. I’m sure that some of them would enjoy it. Not in a way one might read it in a History of Magic textbook, or one might hear McGonagall and Flitwick reminisce on the corridor in between classes. But rather experience it first-hand. We’ve talked about the complete absence of education for young wixen before, love. My thoughts went in this direction: Youngsters should have the chance to partake and decide whether the ancient rituals should stay in the past for them or not.
Me though? I used to have a rough idea of the life and career I wanted. Not any longer. What job it was doesn’t matter. The important part is that even thinking about doing it day after day leaves me cold. That’s another thing that you and I have in common. The paths that were laid out in front of us, so straight and narrow, are suddenly rather more maze-like.
In hopes of taking your mind off things, I’ll talk a bit more. Hermione is off to Arithmancy, and Luna is in Divination right now. Ron stayed with me and we were talking about Crups. For some reason that I can’t even recall now, I asked him about his Patronus, and he showed me that it’s a sweet little Crup who sat on my bed and wiggled its tails. Harry, I practically bathed in that intoxicated feeling of the medication. This mild feeling of a pleasant drunkenness mixed with this post-orgasm contentment – I felt it tenfold with a Patronus nearby.
I don’t think it matters if you’re a Muggle or a wizard: meeting your future Mother-in-Law is always tough. Narcissa and I just have a little more history than most people. Still, in life things are only as easy or as hard as you let them be, and I do think our experiences today bode well for the future.
I didn’t tell him about what we had both planned, my darling. I didn’t want to get into it, and then have to bring up your probation, or the Mind Healing that I’m so keen to pursue. It didn’t matter though: Seamus wasn’t all that interested in having a debate about careers.
I carefully read what you had to say about me, my pride and my fears, and I get the feeling that you see right through me most of the time. I like to think that it works the other way around just as well. I see you. Self and persona, as your Mind Healer would say. Whenever I look at you, I can’t see one without the other. When I see you, I’m overwhelmed by all the nuances that make up only you. You are a very unique and fascinating person. I spent night after night rereading our diary and racking my brains over the fact that you told me that you loathed the sight of yourself.
This polite, achingly cold-blooded character that you’re currently playing doesn’t fool me, Draco. It’s a tactic. He's your public persona, honed over years. You’re still pretending to be the feared, noble, and powerful wizard that your father so wanted you to be.
The letter that I sent to Pansy wasn’t the only thing that I dispatched this morning with the Hogwarts owls. I also sent a letter to Andromeda, asking her permission to bring you with me. I won’t repeat every word, for much of it was me asking after her many pals in Whatstandswell, whether Andi believes her enchanted pear tree will give her a good crop this spring, and – most critically and vitally – whether the local Muggles have restocked her favourite cherry jam in their shop.
Apart from that, she remembered an altered kind of Girding Potion to help children with crazy magical outbursts. But I’m not sure if this is anything worth looking into since you’re hardly a child. Perhaps the ingredients of the potion could give us a lead, though. Just as I expected, Mother would indeed know of some books, and could even recall where they were placed in our library. She can’t go home now, though. Our home is still confiscated until further notice.
I can dream this up rather vividly, how forming important connections with the high society of the old wizarding world bound them together. This sounds so much like them (in all the good and the bad ways), and I see them falling in love over this rather than kissing in front of la tour Eiffel or holding hands while crossing the Grand Canal in a Venetian gondola. As for me, I would much rather share the latter two with you, my love.
Pulling my sleeve up, I showed Narcissa the watch that’d belonged to Sirius, and she glanced at it, taking in the glow of the old gold and the Black family crest on the dial.
Listen to me. I'm incorrigible. I haven’t even said hello and I’ve already descended into a romantic flight of fancy.
Thank you for trusting me, darling, and thank you for letting me give you pleasure. Thank you for being my one true lover.
I hummed and hawed for a moment, but Seamus had me, bang to rights. Subtly hasn’t ever been my strong suite, has it love? So, I did what I do best and dug my grave a little deeper.
spouts nothing but dragon dung,” I replied, feeling my face heat red as I spoke. “And its most recent foul article was enough to have Draco confined to the Hospital Wing. The truth of what we have together isn’t anything like they say. What we have together isn’t sordid or sinful. I really love your son,” I answered. “Please believe me. I really love Draco, and I’d have imagined – hoped – that you’d have wanted that same outcome for him too. I’ve committed to him with all of my heart,” I added, “and there’ll never be a day where he doesn’t come first.”
Do you remember the Yule Ball? That is a great example. My friends and I fussed for weeks about having the right robes, the right dates and having all the right moves on the dancefloor. But, by the end of the night, we were all sat about like so many bitter lemons, cursing the very day that we’d been born.
“The reason that I went to Lyon, Harry, was to recover this.” She sighed, and for the first time since we’d met, I could see how the horrors of the war must have weighed heavily on her shoulders. “It doesn’t look like much, does it, but this little ring has been a Black heirloom for many generations. It was part of my dowry that was given alongside myself when my parents wed Lucius to me.”
Talking of love spells, I’m hopeful that we can cast one of our own over Theo and Pansy. I made the change to the letter that you suggested and added your sentence word for word. I had to look up fainéant in a French dictionary, and it made me laugh that you described your best mate as idle and lazy.
But Salazar, he sounded so desperate. I have never in my life heard him like that. I have no idea how well you know Theo, Harry, but let me assure you that he’s rather quiet. Stoic. Seeing him cry, mutter unfocussed things about his responsibilities that he has no clue how to solve, and then on top of that sob over Pansy is completely out of his usual emotional spectrum.
They’ve stuck me in a tiny annex interview room while they make a decision about whether to admit me to visit Narcissa. It’s horrible here. The temperature feels like it's deliberately charmed too cold to be comfortable, the walls are covered in grey tiles, and the carpet is thin and patchy, covered in strange grubby stains. The air smells old, stuffy, as if this place has been forgotten about.
My mind at ease from the talk with Lulu, I went to see my Mind Healer then. You might think me nuts, but I had a list with topics I wanted to address with him. You see, sometimes when I’ve been seeing him, my mind was just blank, or I’ve been in a too good mood to think about my worries.
Fuck, I’m so sorry that it took me a moment. Couldn’t really speak while I came, but my belly and my fingers are positively covered in cum right now. Oh, Merlin.
That’s nothing to be decided quickly though. I remember how you talked about this friend who was so sure of what to do after Hogwarts. I’m still sticking with what I said about this: nobody will bat an eyelash, should you wait to start a career for some years after your N.E.W.T.s. It may sound incredibly urgent and important now. But in your 120 years or so of life, it won’t matter whether you start a job at age 19 or 25.
It felt horrible to read your thoughtful suggestion and, in the same breath, be reminded of everything that’s rotten about me. Well, not everything but a huge part of what’s wrong about me.
Oh, Draco, you’ll be in your element. You’ll charm Andromeda’s socks right off her feet with your handsome smile and the polite way that you’ll inquire after her health. You’ll know all the Latin names for the plants in her garden and be able to make intelligent comments that’ll have her swooning (and me as well, most likely.)
Sadly, however, you are correct.  Maybe the Mind Healer will write a report about whether we have used this diary at least once a week. The report won't cover any of its contents, though. Unless we wish to discuss anything, we've written in here during our therapy sessions. It is supposed to be a safe and anonymous space.
Okay, speaking of pure-bloods and of regulations and all, let me fire a question. You can be open-minded about me, but how far would you really go: is there hope for Draco Malfoy?
with a tap of his wand and opened the door for the three wix to enter. Waters directed Narcissa to sit down at the table opposite myself and, once your mother was settled in her seat, the Auror
“Don’t you think she could be with friends? She knows you’re in Hogwarts, and that you aren’t alone. She does know about us, doesn’t she?”
This, Harry. This is why I love you. To be fair, I love you for a myriad of reasons, but you’re so brave and just good at heart. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more eloquent on that, but this moment was so you and everything I love about you. You don’t take shit from no one, no matter if it’s a misguided teacher, the corrupted Ministry, or your mother-in-law.
I’m so excited about all these Muggle things you’ve mentioned. I forgot to mention it during Yuletide, but in the Muggle part of the bed and breakfast in Whitby they had a television set. I almost started writing down all about it, but you probably know what a television is like, I suppose. Did the Dursleys let you watch it as a child? I shall hope so because it looked like jolly good fun for a young chap.
Merlin. I’m half flabbergasted that I didn’t wake up to one of my so-called nocturnal emissions. I’m wild for you, love, and I can’t wait until I can wake you up like a real lover should. We’ll have whole days in front of us and no place that we need to be. You’ll despair of me.
This tea is so good, so much better than these atrocious concoctions served in Hogwarts. Did you really order Kreacher to get ‘posh tea’? Were those your words?
“Malfoy had been flirting, giving me lusty gazes and small touches for days by that point, and, innocent as I was, I didn’t know how to back down from his honeyed seduction techniques. It almost came to a head during a school party three days before."
Secondly: yes, let’s continue with the brutal honesty that we have always treated these diaries with.
Now I’m thinking of your hair, though, and I’ll have you know that I had quite a physical reaction to your mention of putting up your hair in a bun. I reckon you’d look even more scrumptious than you do now, even though up until I read your ponderings, I had no idea that was possible.
My left hand is on my prick as I write this, but I can’t wait to have both hands. I’ll Levitate our book. Will
I stayed quiet because I knew that you were thinking about something. After a few beats of silence, you said, “I thought that it– that we were so obvious. That people would see me kiss my beloved and just know that it had been inevitable all along. Merlin, we’ve always been at each other’s necks. Always. And this year we fell in love. But – Draco, darling – we had months to fall in love, didn’t we? We’ve been writing in our diaries because it felt like the only place either of us could be honest. It was the one place I felt like... being just Harry.”
Afterwards we walked over to the local park. It’s funny really. All of last summer I resided in Grimmauld Place, and I never once thought to leave its stately doors and actually look at the part of London where I now lived. Today I did though and seeing it through your eyes made me love Sirius’s gift anew.
I had to tell you all this before I could speak about the game. The diary always holds a warm place in my heart as well as in my satchel which I hugged so closely that it might well have been my lifeline. You wouldn’t believe how much it still scares me to be among other students. I start second-guessing everything I do and say which usually renders me mute and stiff.
“When you say ‘Lord Draco’ like that I vividly remember your eleven-year-old self,” you said, far too amused if you ask me. “Merlin, but you can’t deny you were a pampered little prince- Lord! And I probably know less than half of it.”
It’s a lot about controlling your thoughts as well as your impulses. I’d hazard a guess that you’re well-experienced with the latter while gathering and channelling all this passionate willpower is the problem, isn’t it? Occlumency. We’ve been talking about this before. Do you want me to try and teach you a bit? It’d even be good practise for your DADA exams. I won’t accept any result other than an O from you.
. I had a plan in place – I’d have taken you to St Mungo’s – but luckily it didn’t come to that. At two hours past their appointment time, the three Aurors arrived, the crack of their Apparition announcing their arrival and startling us in the silence of our Living Room.
Sorry. Am I being too much? Like I said yesterday in very different circumstances, I love you. I love you with everything I’ve got, and I’m not good at sitting about, twiddling with my wand and waiting for my cauldron to boil. This is me being a Gryffindor, Draco. Impetuous and quick to action. All I want is to protect the people that I care about, and I knew, I fucking knew that trouble was brewing when McGonagall came to collect you from Defence.
Just now, my two dormmates got themselves into a little accident. The idiots practised Transfiguration and instead of altering the colours of each other’s eyebrows, Atkinson Vanished Palmer’s eyes. The bloke panicked, of course, and his wand went off, hitting Atkinson with something that made his face go an appalling shade of green before he started retching and gasping for air.
of my wand lighting my page and very soon I’ll watch the sunrise over the Scottish mountains, knowing full well that tonight I’ll go to sleep in your arms, in our bedroom, in a home that is ours.
Like the old Mind Healer of mine. I’m really looking forward to my appointment this week. I still can’t believe that it could’ve been like that from the start of term. What do you reckon – would our MHs still think it’s perfectly normal how we communicate and what we’ve found in each other? I’m sure no one would understand us, and the idea is oddly romantic to me. I feel like we already have something that only few find. I, for my part, had no idea such a feeling existed before I found you.
We must reward Harry for a lifetime of brave deeds by allowing him to be truly happy with his own Chosen One beside him: Draco Malfoy.
I love you most ardently and quite kinkily, Mr Harry Potter-Malfoy, First Class OM, masterofthesnitch, cock worshiper, and Saviour of the Wizarding world.
When I see Mother during the holidays, I won’t possibly be able to keep us a secret. This relationship means far too much to me to deny anything. On top of that, I don’t feel like lying to Mother right now, after all we’ve been through. She ought to know that I’m in love with a wizard and that we might have plans to move in together after Hogwarts. Perhaps this will even put her mind at ease, should she consider staying in France.
By the way, I had no idea of your life apart from Hogwarts either. I always assumed that you must’ve been raised in a home much like mine, legend that you are. Like every wix, I knew that you grew up with Muggles. But I simply assumed that you must’ve had tutors. We haven’t talked about it much, but when I learnt your name after New Year’s and reread our diary, I felt so guilty for all the times that I bullied you. I mean, you were a prat, yes, but I just… And I thought about Dumbledore who must’ve fucking known, didn’t he? Just like your Muggle school teachers who didn’t care a sickle.
My darling boy. I’m here, wrapped up in my sheets, thinking back over our afternoon, and I cannot get over what a brilliant wizard you are.
Luna didn’t once hurry us as we answered her questions, did she? We took it in turns to tell our friend about our shared diaries, and how we’d found freedom and happiness in those pages that we’d never known in our real lives.
Straight after Potions. Bring your coat and scarf (and revise your best warming spell) because I know a great little spot just past the Quidditch Changing Rooms.
Okay, you can probably count one and one together. I know Malfoy. As far as I know, what you said about his father is right. It might not have been the brightest idea to bring his family in the position to owe the Dark Lord so badly that his son needed to step up in row when LM fell out of His favour. And imagine having Him living in your home. Creepiest family dinners ever, am I right?
I mean yes, she’s utterly stone-faced, and a little bit terrifying, but hedging her bets that the Ministry would do a backroom deal with her? That takes some serious brass balls. I don’t think there are many wizards, especially not in my experience, that would have taken such a chance.
Of course, you’re absolutely right on the wand about those hideous mating rituals that are bestowed upon us with this Ball. I certainly won’t go. I would neither want to go alone nor would I score a date. Let’s just stay in our respective beds and sulk about it, shall we?
You came to stand beside me, flinging your arm around my middle, and we looked at the tapestry together, both of us silent for a good while.
Do you really think that they’re going to get hitched? I wonder if he’s brought her a ring? Ron doesn’t have two brass Groats to rub together, but I’m sure the Weasley's have got family rings or suchlike. I suppose we’ll see what Valentine’s day brings. Hogwarts will be a sea of hearts, chocolates, owls bearing bouquets and broken dreams tomorrow. I, of course, have two small gifts for you. Please don’t fret: I haven’t been emptying my vault for the occasion, but I do rather hope they’ll be memorable for all the right reasons.
He said that we should have been thinking about our futures for the last two years, forming our own opinions and discovering our sexual orientations in a natural way, as teenagers usually do.
It isn’t any wonder, really, that Voldemort was able to draw so much hatred for the Muggles, not when such prejudice is ingrained in their mythology. Not that it’s just non-magical folk, is it? We’re just as bad. Worse in many ways! Remember how quickly Lupin was harassed out of Hogwarts once it became known that he was a Werewolf?
I’m glad that I’ve set Silencing Charms and Wards around the curtains of my bed. I’m noisy. I’m panting.
Robards hardly changed his expression. “Malfoys never supplicate,” he repeated, “yet here you are, living in another wizard’s house. I saw the glamorous outfit you wore to kiss Mr Potter on the front of the
You’re right with what you said. I do deserve fair and lawful treatment. That petty revenge is not what our legal system should be about. Being allowed outside without a chaperone and being allowed magic outside home will make it easier to lead a normal life. It might even be important for my work. Who knows for which occasions I will need to check in with clients personally? Just imagine having to travel to Diagon or anywhere outside of London by Muggle transportation.
And the truth is, I actually can’t wait to meet your mum! Don’t worry, I was half in jest in my last letter, when I wrote that I would give her a kiss and a hug when I met her (I was entirely serious when I said that I’d treat you better than any other man could.) Indeed, I promise I will be the epitome of respect and courtesy. I'll be perfect son-in-law material (half in jest once again).
Darling, it was so snug, and the angle was difficult, but the thrill of it had me ejaculating in hot spurts all over my bed sheets. I knew that soon it’d be your fingertips, opening me wide and ready, inside our bedroom at Grimmauld Place. I want you to stretch me and scissor me; acclimatise me slowly so that I’ll be able to accommodate every inch of your perfect penis. You’ll be so proud, and so full of love for me, when you finally push inside, filling me up to the brim.
And to me – only to me – it also means eager, unblinking eyes that look at me like the whole world might cease to exist for a moment. But when I come near, they close in a knee-jerk reaction while plump lips part, awaiting my kiss. Nothing in this world makes my heart clench quite so beautifully than recognising your love for me in your words, your expression, and the way your body reacts to my touch.
Has sneaking about always been this easy for you? You know so many places around the castle, much more than I ever have, and nothing seems to stop you. Frankly, it’s quite the contrary. Wherever there’s something in your way, it seems you rise to an even better solution, Harry Potter.
I hear the sound of the dinner time bell, thank Circe. I’m famished and think I could eat a dozen of Hagrid’s rock cakes if there were all that were on offer. I love you.
There hasn’t ever been some great, defining moment where I thought that I wouldn’t ever fancy a girl again, but I’m beginning to think that it’s increasingly unlikely.
Merlin, I’m getting quite exhausted just now. Sorry for telling you all this nonsense. I remember only now that I used to jerk off, just to fall asleep a little easier.
But there’s one image that I won’t ever forget. You stood before me, your body leaning against mine, and I felt your erection against my thigh. Your lips gleamed with wetness, reddened from the effort you put into pleasuring me. The view was so sultry and compelling that my thumb automatically went to your mouth, grazing your pliable bottom lip in a light touch.
They are very sweet to me, though. Hermione and Ron hover next to me, asking me whether I’m alright when I was only giggling about something silly I thought of. They also wanted to know whether you’re alright, Harry, and I showed them our diary like the complete idiot that I am. Forgot that he can’t read it. Hermione has been laughing and smiling at me ever since.
A twisted part of me would instantly go back to that state of my blissfully unaware life. Quick as a hex. Even though I’m more than aware now how wrong it would be to forget. Not sure how much of a trigger the recent historical events are for you, but this war was pretty much the worst thing that could’ve happened to my life.
Sanctimonia Vincet Semper – that’s the family motto. And while sanctimonia can indeed mean ‘purity’, it can also mean chastity, venerability, irreproachability, or integrity. That’s a lot of different words and different meanings as far as I’m concerned. Chastity is not for me, I suppose, and long gone are the days I cared a sickle about purity, at least in the context of blood-status. I am not to judge my venerability and I’m everything but irreproachable.
Don’t laugh at me, or call me some sort of kinky git! – please! – but he reminded me a little of you. His movements were so fastidious and controlled, and I imagined that you might have been taught to conduct yourself in much the same way. I imagined how you might look, eating food that I'd prepared for you. How you'd savour it and smile. How it would sustain you.
of my carefully chosen Top Three Wizarding Places You Ought To Visit Before You Grow A Beard Like Dumbledore (I almost started to write my name down because it would be an even better title; add some dramatic effect, you know):
You’ll be my good friend, Draco. We’ll sit together in the Great Hall, and we’ll moan about our teachers, and we might even find half an hour to take out our broomsticks. It’ll be fun, I promise you.
As for my mother – hm. I’m really unsure how she will take the news that I’m gay. She might suspect it since she always knew me so well. But then again, I’m sure she had expected me to marry a respectable witch someday and produce a proper heir. There are ways to have children as wizards, I suppose, but that’s still very frowned upon, isn’t it?
We’ll have to plan our bonding ceremony too. I don’t wish to have Narcissa dislike me because I’ve dragged you into a depraved world of living in sin. If a wedding is a fulfilment of a contract, then I’m anxious to uphold my side of the bargain.
Of course, I’ll reply soon! As fast as I could manage. I’m so relieved now that I heard back from you again. And I usually don’t dare to be too optimistic at the moment. But sweet Circe, am I full of hope right now. Okay, admittedly, I can’t quite tune down some of my… I call it realism, you call it pessimism, I suppose. But let me explain myself and let me dig into the bad thoughts first.
It is very easy for the wizarding public to believe that they know Harry Potter. His image regularly gazes out at you from the front of
I need to ask you something. I’ve ordered several things for a proper fitting before selecting dress robes for February. Do you already know what you’ll be wearing? Don’t worry, I don’t want to suggest something dreadful like matching ties or anything (though I’m not saying I’d be completely opposed) but I remember that you told me you’re not too confident in choosing appropriate attire.
“I didn’t mean to…” you signalled to the fireplace, but quickly surrendered the gesture, your hands dropping into your lap. “Fuck, but I haven’t felt my magic like this in a while. That was strange.”
Anyhow, what I actually mean to say is that – in my world – there’s no reason not to enjoy intimacy over the words we share. No matter if we are doing any of the things we say we’d be doing with each other in person (yet). I might even go as far as to claim that it might be a good way to learn about each other and perhaps even ourselves.
Please remind me to never read your words when I’m around people. I did only so much as glimpse at your first words and my cousin read it all over my face. “Oh you fell in love. How wonderful!” is what she said. In case you had any doubts: I, too, am a man in love. Just as much as you seem to be and say you are, my darling sap.
Seamus seemed to like that answer. “You’re not going in for the Aurors yourself?” he asked, putting the textbook back on the shelf. “You used to talk about it a lot, back before the war. I always thought you were dead up for it… All that wand waving and hex throwing. You’d have been ace at all that. The fastest Expelliarmus in the Ministry.”
Second. Harry, what the fuck. Alice Kyteler was one of the first witches Muggles ever held trial against – well, with accusations of witchcraft that is. She was an Irish potioneer and, like many other wixen at the time, made herself quite a fortune by taking advantage of clueless Muggles. Her wealth already got her rather unfavoured in the eyes of her debtors (okay: victims), and apparently the witch wasn’t afraid to speak her mind when it came to the deities. So she was accused of heresy and some other crimes, mainly to do with witchcraft.
Sweet Circe, I was so moved. And you better be moved too! We will have loads of social responsibilities, love, but if the Weasleys call you their seventh son – which is a very magical number – then they shall be family. Merlin, I’m gaining so many unexpected new relations.
“I want it to be simple,” I answered eventually. “About our lives, and the love that we’ve found together, rather than the ceremony itself. I want to respect any family traditions that are important to you, and finally,” I said, “I want a big, fat Muggle wedding cake with grooms on the top tier. I want us to have a party, at Andromeda’s home, with all of our loved ones there.” I curled my hand softly around your jaw. “As long as I get the honour of being your husband,” I finished, finding your eyes, “I’ll be the happiest wizard that there has ever been.”
The war, the Mind Healer explained, was a critically disruptive event in the lives of our year group. He said that while we were fighting, we weren’t paying any heed to our normal emotional development. This all sounded like namby-pamby nonsense to me, but the Mind Healer shook his head.
I’d like to imagine that you’re already starting to get hard now. Stroke yourself a few times, but not too quick. Now pull your foreskin down a bit and give yourself a nice, firm squeeze around the base of your prick. Just hold your hand there until further notice. No moving, not yet. And no cheating. We will practise some self-control.
Now that this is said, I wouldn’t judge you for your romanticism. Instead, I’ll give you a reason to laugh at me. Let me clear my throat really quickly.
Maybe I will talk a bit more about my childhood to you, but not today. Today, with the last of the glacial fresh air in my lungs, my relations and my childhood feel about a million miles away, which is exactly where I would love them both to stay. Perhaps that is what being an adult is really about? Choosing not to have negative, damaging people in your life anymore.
You laughed and rolled your eyes at me, but your expression was serious when you kissed my face and took my hand in yours. “You do know that none of it matters, Draco, don’t you? We’re not doing this for anyone else but us. It’s mere coincidence that Narcissa and Andi… Well, that they would be pushing us if we weren’t decided anyway. And also – fuck a dowry and that talk about ‘not entering the relationship as equal partners’ or whatever else she said. Circe, I don’t care about any of it.”
Remember that I’ve told you that Mother and I have always been a team somehow? I read her like a book – which is not always the greatest experience, let me assure you. Let me explain some things you haven’t picked up on. Just a few, though.
I got the impression that Nott’s tale had upset you rather a lot, especially when you said quietly that you ‘understood his anguish in a way that nobody else might.’
But my name, Draco, it also means serpent, did you know? Snakes have always fascinated me. Dragons too, but you obviously know all about them. Snakes are treacherous creatures, especially the venomous ones. Something that will not face you in a fair fight but dive in for a quick and well-aimed bite, then slip away into safety while their prey is left to die.
The laughter faded immediately when your hands were stroking my bulge only covered by a thin layer of fabric. You arched your brow and tugged at the hem of my pants. Everything then was happening for me in a daze, my love. I pulled down my pants and felt incredibly ungraceful and insecure for a second, wondering what you might think. So many silly things went through my head – I even thought that there was a good possibility that you’d decide at this very moment that you weren’t even into cock.
Just kidding. We had awfully sweet sparkling wine and whatever else we could get our grabby hands on. Only once did I manage to purloin a fine brandy off Father’s collection. Firewhiskey I usually ordered using the accounts of senior school mates. I was well-respected and feared after all. No one wanted my father to hear about their inadequacy, am I right?
But I’m worried about you. You, too, seem to live happily in the bliss of our love, and the worst fears of our everyday life are the prospect of exams or finding an apt career. Please, if there should ever be anything you want to talk about, talk to me. Anytime. I know that you’re quick to worry about me, but I can’t stand the idea that you shy away from burdening me. I’m just as much there for you as you are for me. Serva me, servabo te.
I’m outside on the bench down at the beach again but it feels like the weather tries to usher me back into the cosy safety of the couch in the sitting room. Or in my bed. I’m actually starting to feel a little worn out from the permanent company. I don’t know whether you can relate to this or not, but being around other wixen so much, permanently being engaged in conversations, face schooled to avoid looking too bored, always sitting straight – it’s rather strenuous.
My rockstar friend though? He was sincere, unashamed of who he was. I was attracted to him because I wanted to be like him, I reckon, rather than anything that I wanted to actually do to him. The idea makes me smile. I wouldn’t have known what to do with him even if he'd noticed me. I'd probably have fled.
Remember that I told you, letters and letters ago, that I tended to fall into relationships with anyone that paid me even the slightest bit of attention? This diary had been more attention than I’d been given ever before in my life. You’ve told me about your travels and shared beautiful poetry with me. You've even told me secrets that made my blood thrum with desire and want. Talking to you helped me articulate my own sexual desires. Fuck, but your words made me view myself as a sexual being. You've been a revelation.
And I couldn’t agree more, love. I knew that Luna would write a brilliant article – I’ve edited enough of her articles over the past few months that I trust her expertise – but it felt so wholesome to read about us with such amiable words. Of course, it’s not the whole truth – news articles never are. Like you mentioned, it centres around you. But that’s a good thing, Harry. That’s what people want to read.
My eyelids are heavy with sleep now, my darling. I will reread the beginning of your letter now and enjoy a very slow and lazy orgasm that will send me right off to sleep. I’m sorry for mentioning this in such a drowsy and unsexy way. Sometimes I can be awfully pragmatic about such things. Let me assure you that your description of playing footsie under the table before sneaking off tickled all my desires, I’m truly just too tired for adventurous self-stimulation right now.
My love. I’ve cried off my Astronomy lesson and feigned a headache. I didn’t get to the Hospital Wing though; I’ve returned here, to my bed, and I’m laid upon the covers.
You told me how hungry you were now, after you had barely touched the sandwiches hours before. But sweet Circe. The moment realisation dawned across your face that getting food would also mean a very formal dinner in a smaller circle, only guests of honour, no journalists – it was an adorable sight.
It’s not healthy for little witches and wizards to be educated by their mums or by their Governesses (was that your experience?) and only be allowed to socialise with the children their parents think are suitable companions. It isn't natural.
“Malfoy was wanton and dissolute,” Zabini admits. “To this day, I wonder whether Malfoy cast a spell over me. At the time, I only thought he was trying to seduce me into marriage, possibly with the aim of stealing all my own Mother’s Galleons. Three days later I had a far fouler shock.”
We’d made it, all of us, after a hard and difficult year.  None of us had wanted to come back, the ashes of the war still drifting around our brains, too big for the constraints of schoolwork, uniforms and rules. The whole world that we’d known was blown to smithereens.
That might be the perfect time, I imagine, to continue our extremely serious research. We’d have to consider not only the quality and number of our orgasms, but all the different ways that I can wring them out of you, with my lips, my fingers and other parts of my anatomy that you might find agreeable…
Now, you’ll have grown up with house-elves, I’m sure of it, but not me. I had no idea that such a group even existed until I met him. Gods, but was he the most aggravatingly awful/brilliantly great creature? They smashed the mould with that one.
Last night, Draco? I don’t have the words to express how much I enjoyed myself. I loved every part. Riding our brooms and having the cold March air rushing over our faces as we looped and dived. finding that romantic, isolated spot and experiencing the perfect, flawless silence and best of all, kissing you as the seasons changed.
These last few weeks and months? You’ve grown to the most important part of my life. When I read your words about visiting France and eating mille-feuille, and when I read your words about growing together, about sharing all the big parts of our lives, then I know. I know that this is the future I want.
Maybe if we'd met in a different place or time, things between my girl and I could have been different. You were right. Everything that you said here in our diary was correct. My ex-girl was looking for a romantic diversion, looking for a bit of that dreamy intrigue which has seemingly overtaken our whole eighth year.
I nodded even though I hadn’t really been aware of that until he said it. But once he mentioned it, I sort of guessed what he was going to say.
When I told her a little about your magic, Mother seemed to be quite impressed. She said that this usually only happens to very powerful wizards. Made me quite proud, isn’t that odd? Anyhow.
And just before I started writing, I actually used one of my empty vials to store the memory. I’m such a sap for you, it’s unbelievable. When we are the one-hundred-and-two-year-old wizards, I will hold you to this promise. I will grab you and shove your head in our Pensieve to watch this memory and when we pull back into our future present, we shall kiss, my love.
Others stopped their training to marvel at the legendary Patronus that paced the room with his ethereal gleam, but he stopped right next to me as though he was my familiar, his antlers proudly raised. His magic feels like you, Harry. Not like all of you, but like I’d catch a waft of your scent, or like I’d hear your mellifluous voice muffled through a door, or like grazing your skin with my fingers but not quite touch it. But more than that, it feels like untainted happiness and candid hope bundled in such a magnificent creature.
Love, I saw how your home was no longer a place of safety, but was instead a place of terror and heartbreak, and I heard your thoughts, as clear as if you had spoken them. My future is void, you thought. My life has ended, and it hasn’t even begun. Tears pricked and stung, tears of impotent horror, but you didn’t even dare to let them fall. That would only have raised Voldemort’s wrath, and you couldn’t bear to see his punishment doled on your mother. He was a sadist, Draco, a psychopath, skilled at picking at the loose threads of your brain until he found the soft places of kindness that he could twist and manipulate, torturing you into near madness.
It’s this coming Friday. Here's a challenge for you, my Slytherin lover: think of a way to return the favour then.
Poor Sinistra. There wasn’t a celestial body in the whole of the sky that could have kept my attention this lesson. The only constellation that I have even the slightest interest in is you, my darling love. Is it too terribly cliché to say that you’ve bewitched my heart and captivated my senses? That sounds a little bit Snape-esque doesn’t it, but it suits my mood.
You and I will make a Patronus Charm. As soon as Potions is finished, then you and I shall find somewhere secluded to practice. I’m excited to see what form yours will take, my darling, and whether our falling in love will influence what we see. Teddy’s mum – Nymphadora – well, her Patronus changed after she married professor Lupin. I’ve no clue what it was before, but her Patronus changed to that of an immense silver wolf, exactly the same as her husband’s. My parents were a matched pair as well – a stag and a doe – so I think there must be something to it.
How could it be any other, Draco? You’re my boyfriend. I’m not ashamed of you and I’m certainly not worried about what the rest of Hogwarts might think when we hold each other’s hand, or I slide my arm around your waist in the dinner queue.
In retrospect, I must say that me and my cronies were absolutely horrid. We weren’t as daft as to come across as such to the Professors, but we weren’t nice. House rivalry was very big for us. My snide remarks on sappy Hufflepuffs, boorish Gryffindors, insufferable Ravenclaws and cunning Slytherins are meant in jest today, but I used to be quite the elitist. Smuggling sparkling wine into the Yule Ball definitely was a harmless but nonetheless fun stunt which I already mentioned before. I’ll try to think of something else that doesn’t make me feel like a right prick though.
The house is a beautiful town house on the Royal Crescent. I have no idea whether you’ve ever been to Whitby, my darling, but it’s indeed a crescent-shaped street of town houses. Right in front of it, there’s a park – but not a single tree nor a house bar your view across the open sea from here. I could overlook it from my window right now as I’m writing to you, would night not have already fallen over us.
So, George is stuck between the cauldron and the fire. I think you’d be the perfect person to help him, and George realised that yours were the finest potions available – because of course, they would be! – you’d have a regular customer.
“You were saying something about me being clever… And, what was it, domestic?” you asked, eying up the pan suspiciously. “So domestic that I can’t make toast, Harry!”
Look, I know that I’ve been hinting on those treacherous friends before, but it doesn’t stop there. Who wouldn’t off a Malfoy if given half a chance, Harry? Friends, enemies – it doesn’t matter, not at all! Let’s face it: Mother being missing means she’s dead. How else would she manage not to be found? Does the Trace work abroad? Did someone try to track her wand? Fuck.
You were surprised that I’ve been to Godric’s Hollow before, and I told you how probably most wixen have been there. I wasn’t fibbing when I told you that – as a child and completely ignorant of the meaning of it all – I was fascinated by famous Harry Potter and his parents who have heroically died so that their son could defeat the Dark Lord. See, the times were different. Father made himself a name in the Ministry, holding back whenever something about You-Know-Who came up, and Mother wouldn’t have ever spoken to me about their former alliances in the First War anyway.
It was the set of the Headteacher’s face, those thin lines beside her eyes that she always has when she’s concerned, and the way that she asked for you to “please follow, Mr Malfoy,” and that “you had an important visitor from the DMLE”.
“Susan Bones,” I answered eventually. “Me, Ron and Draco? Well, we reckon she might fancy you Seamus. The other day, when we were waiting for Transfiguration? She couldn’t keep her eyes off you. The three of us… We had a bit of a wager. Thought she’d jump to your aid.” I pulled a resigned face. “Looks like I own Ron three Groats.”
We can’t undo that fact, not with all the spells and Time Turners in the world. A few letters ago we were talking about the relatives that brought me up, and I said something that I only realise now was significant: “I was fed a lot of unpleasant ideas by my relatives, and I internalised them completely. I didn’t know any different.” Tell me: how is that any different to the childhood you shared with your family?
My second bit of exciting news is actually rather more like gossip, so this will have to remain under your hat for a little while. It is about Ron, and more specifically, his relationship with Hermione. Yesterday morning, love: do you remember that Hermione was in a tremendously bad temper? Well, here is the reason.
This said, I want to answer your question now, the one you begged me to answer. I would have been more reasonable and careful, had I known it was you. It holds true; I’d still say that.
You bit the side of your fist, muffling your whines, and I steadied myself, holding the base of your girth in my fist as I slid my mouth over your shaft. I could feel the trembles of your body as I went to work, licking, sucking and exploring this wonderful new part of you. I’m sure that I looked undignified, with spit leaking in a stream over my chin but that’s all part of sex. We’re allowed to make faces, and to be our rawest, truest selves. We were both so wound up that it didn’t take long.
Seeing it made me think about our non-Ball, Potter. Part of me fancied hiding away with you from the world again. But we ought to join this time. We’ll be happy about this last occasion to see a bunch of faces for the last time in a while. And I’ll be in desperate need of that Firewhisky after exams.
Whichever path it was, I’m glad they loved each other enough to make you and to nurture you. Together they created the beautiful boy that I’ve fallen so deeply for.
Seriously, Pansy and I never minced our words with each other. Thinking back, I’d say we were horrible – judging others for their appearances, making fun of everyone who was poor or unclever. But enough of that. I have changed and as you put it, “Pansy doesn’t seem stuck in the past either.”
Speaking of your smashing looks. Sleekeazy’s? I used to use it all the time! Not currently, though (bloody money troubles), but of course I normally use it. Sorry, I know that this is a bit inappropriate, but I’d be lying to say that it doesn’t feel like dating a superstar. Sorry!! Just being honest. You know that it doesn’t mean anything to me. Well, it does, but it isn’t the reason why I fancy you. Circe, I should stop.
We escaped a couple wixen who looked quite keen to speak to you (but who had enough decorum to NOT follow us onto the graveyard. And then we stood there, in front of your parents’ grave. You laid down the bouquet on the well-kept grave, and the two of us were briefly wondering who keeps it clean and tends to the plants that grow around the graveside.
I’ll get up now, take care of our lovely owl sisters, get the kettle on for when you get back, (try to) prepare some breakfast. I have an idea of what we’ll do today.
But I promise that I’d be very soft and pliable. If we were to lie in bed together right now, we’d jerk each other off with lazy, bed-warmed fists, and we wouldn’t stop kissing while doing so. Circe, I’d love that.
Are you sure that it’ll be alright? They will dig, Harry. They will try to find something, and the bloody Ministry always finds something.
I didn’t exactly expect him to start crying all over again. Only this time, I conjured him a tissue at least. “Please, Draco – if you heard anything from Pansy – I beg you to tell me! Do you know whether she’s alright?”
Anyway, I’m sorry I’m late in replying. I meant to answer earlier but it’s been a bugger of a day and very confusing to boot. You said a couple of letters ago that whatever I felt like talking about, I could. So that's what I shall do.
And words, Harry. So many words that ran through my mind without being able to focus on just one stream of them.
I ventured outside the safety of my dorm today and found an alcove in a quiet corridor. I think most students have classes right now. Don’t worry, I’m not skipping. Free lesson. And I can’t wait to reply. I’m feeling so close to you whenever I’m picking up my quill and our diary.
Looking in from the outside, the similarities are blatant. You’ve both been dealt an awful, dreadful hand in your lives, and yet here you both are, throwing off the shackles of the world you were born into. It doesn’t matter about the probation you've both been put under or the loss of your Galleons. You’re both making whole new lives for yourselves. Finding the people that you would never have been otherwise. It is humbling to watch, actually. I couldn't ever have been as brave as you both are.
“I’m still confused as to what you hope to achieve from this,” Robards said, his eyes flicking over Narcissa and myself. “But, since we’re compelled to allow you one visit, I’m not going to argue with your choice. We’ll be back in ten minutes – no more, not less – so say what needs to be said.” He looked over at me before he left. “Such a pity,” he said, more to himself than to the room. “A clever lad like yourself, getting caught up with this nest of vipers. If only your parents were still alive: perhaps they’d have helped you to see sense.”
Atkinson, Waters, and Robards appeared then, and I felt your whole-body shudder. They bustled in, full of an air of their own importance, and we stood up to meet them.
After I Flooed to the DMLE, the pair kept me standing, waiting, for half an hour. I wasn’t fooled, it was all mind games. They were trying to intimidate me. At least now that I’m here in their actual place of work, they’re both being much more civil. I couldn’t have borne any more veiled threats.
I’d never figured myself for the exhibitionist type but those words that you’ve just written for me? Bloody hell. If I’m not careful then I’ll shoot my load just thinking about them.
I know I’m being a selfish prick again, but I couldn’t help myself at that moment. Thought I’d share that with you since my thoughts tend to be not as proactive. Although it’d be hard for me to live up to my claim. I might be too stiff and starchy to behave like the dashing young lad I was supposed to be in an alternate universe without the Second Wizarding War. But who knows?
It was obvious they wanted me to change my statement. That was all it would have taken for your life, the one that I’d saved, to be spent rotting away in Azkaban. That was never going to happen though. Never in a million, billion years. Those Ministry goons wanted to throw away the key on your family, but I wasn’t about to let myself be manipulated by their questioning faces. Those red-coated Auror arseholes hadn’t fought during the Battle but now they wanted to swoop in and be the saviours of the hour.
As for traveling them myself – currently not so much. Neither now nor after Hogwarts. The current circumstances with my family don’t really allow me to do something like travel after my N.E.W.T.s, I assume. If things were different, that would’ve been exactly what I’d done. I would have spent some time in France and Italy and Greece. Maybe Scandinavia. Not to forget the Giant Mountains. But Merlin, talking about this sparked something inside of me.
And get this, Draco: being the irrepressible Gryffindor that I am, and nosy to boot, I used the opportunity of you and Hermione leaving to collect Pumpkin Juice and Cauldron Cakes from her dorm to quiz Ron on what his plans were for Valentine’s Day.
“Harry won’t be speaking to you, or any other person if he doesn’t have an actual speech written.” She stabbed at the bottom of the page with a finger. “And, here, at the bottom? It says that you need to owl a copy of what you intend to say back to the Ministry by this evening.” Hermione frowned. “That isn’t a lot of time, Harry.”
At least all the revision is beginning to pay off. I saw how proud you were when I was able to explain Golpalott’s Third Law to Slughorn without referring to my notebook yesterday. Don’t worry: you schooled your face very smoothly, straight afterwards. That was the reason I squeezed your hand so tightly afterwards.
Draco, sweetheart. It’s okay. Don’t ever be worried about wanting to talk to me. That’s what I’m here for, and you didn’t wake me. I wasn’t really sleeping that soundly anyway.
My own emotions are complicated by the war; in no uncertain terms Narcissa saved my life. Voldemort would have killed me were it not for her bravery. I’m eternally grateful to her, yet I know that her courage came only from the wellspring of her love for you.
I raised a challenging eyebrow at that. “I dare hope this isn’t meant to be a feeble excuse, Weasley.”
Love, I’m trying to listen to you and take better care of myself. Which is working well so far – I just had some lunch – but no nap for me. I need to see McGonagall this afternoon. I assume it's about my missed days… At least it’s only another hour with Slughorn after that until I can finally see you again. I can’t wait to kiss you.
My Mind Healer offered me a glass of water, and I sipped it pensively. “How does that impact your day-to-day life?” he asked, taking up quill and parchment as he spoke. “Don’t worry, I’ll only write down exactly what you say.”
You were giddy and restless, full of unspent energy, when you sat there, writing away in our diary. First you picked up a book, snuggling in next to me on the settee, (despite your good intentions) stealing my attention away with kisses and your hands beneath my jumper.
I smirked then, continuing, “Tell Hermione it’s sexist that wixen suggest that a wizard, in contrast to a witch, wouldn’t appreciate a romantic date or an affectionate kiss. She will get the underlying meaning of that without you accusing her of anything.”
I can’t believe that it’s been a whole year since our bonding ceremony. Time has been racing! Do you remember how we fantasised on spending weeks and weeks in bed to wallow in our hedonistic vices? Well, that’s hardly been the case, was it? After Hogwarts, we did indulge in some time that was just ours and no one else’s, but then there were invitations we couldn’t decline, friends who needed help with moving (as if you could ever say no to someone in need, right?), and so much to do in our own home that required us to get up early and work until we slumped down on the settee in the afternoon.
While we’re on the subject of clueless dolts, I laughed heartily at your description of Harry Potter checking out that Ravenclaw’s enticing bum! It certainly sounded rather lovely. I shall keep my eyes peeled during the next Quidditch game and see if I can experience the vision for myself. Round as an apple, you say?
“You smell so good,” you said with a pleased hum at least for the dozenth time that day, though it never fails to pull at the corners of my lips. “Help me find the right glasses, love. There are a thousand different ones here, and even more in the small parlour across the hall.”
This can be anything; from all these things to do with electrocity, sports, traditions, celebrations. You name it. I thought, perhaps, you could share how you would answer the question. You wouldn’t have to explain in detail, I can do the research myself then. It’s just hard to pick something when you are utterly clueless.
Well, I do. The reason for this is that I’ve had many, many dealings with their officials – including a spell sat in the Wizengamot dock – and I’ve seen every side of their bureaucracy.
She must have taken my silence for agreement because, before I knew it, she’d closed the space between us.
I won't forget. I love you, but I'm nervous. Just another hour and I'll be Flooing over to Hogsmeade.
But still, there’s one more thing to mention. Last night you dedicated all of your attention to my arse like my hole was the most precious thing on the planet. You probably won’t believe it, but I feel my cheeks heat when I recall the way you tongued and sucked my entrance so reverently and thoroughly that I begged you to fill me with your prick.
‘Zabini, a young man of decent background, and high moral standing, was visibly upset when he recalled to me his seduction by Death Eater Draco Malfoy.'
“-the love of your life. Your soulmate. I can see the strength of your love on your face! Feel it in the fierce, raging magic that radiates from you as you sit before me. I do believe that yours is a true love, and that fact terrifies me. It’s only been a matter of weeks and, even as we speak, my son languishes in hospital, made ill by the venomous ink spilt at the
I wanted to address what you said about the Exscribo. First of all: you are my favourite fan-girl. I wouldn’t have anyone else and I’m not only saying this for the sheer purpose of cajoling you.
Oh yes, before I go, I must tell you. Gossip! Well, I don’t actually know if it is gossip or not, but it might be noteworthy. So, this morning I had to sneak back into the dorms relatively early, and I was being my quietest self beneath my Invisibility Cloak so as not to wake anybody else up.
I don’t want to mess with you in any way. It makes me smile to read that I’ve been a sexual revelation to you! And I hope that my candour doesn’t make you think back to the night of our non-Ball with disgust. I hope that you only did things that you truly wanted to do. And that I didn’t make you do anything that could’ve given you the impression to lose control. I can relate to the horrors of the idea to have someone claim your mind or your body or both. But just to be clear, I’m not a Dark object, or at least I hope not.
Everything would be eagerness and heat, all tongues and teeth. It’d be a delicious tussle between us, the sensual give-and-take intimacy of two people for whom the rest of the world has ceased to exist.
I’m sure when McGonagall looks at you a little oddly, it’s because she’s worried about your health. She’s such a mum in some ways. She doesn’t have any spouse or children, though, does she?
You took my prick between your palms, using both your hands to give me the most exquisite feeling. Dear Circe, it actually felt like you practised this. When you leaned down, you licked my glans and your arms hugged around me, shoving me closer to you. I must admit that I had quite a hard time holding my hips still. When you took me into your mouth, I knew that I wouldn’t be able to hold it any longer. I told you so, but you didn’t pull away in the slightest. You just sucked harder until I came, my hands grabbing onto your shoulders somewhere in the process.
You know what? I want Luna’s article about us in our diary, my lovely Harry. Let me duplicate the pages.
Go to Italy as soon as you have the chance. On first sight, the Colosseum looks a bit underwhelming. There are other attractions much more imposing. BUT your friend is so right about the graffiti. And I tell you what: if you have a good sense for magic, Wards, and such, you can actually feel that the Colosseum has been a magic place once. So don’t just look from the outside but pay the weird Muggle ticket and enter the ranked areas. With a minor Disillusionment Charm, you might be lucky and get to the podium.
My Occlumency lessons for example. They were horrible. My Aunt was my teacher, and she wasn’t exactly a very gentle Legilimens. Or a gentle witch, for that matter. She barged into my mind like a crazed ram, pulled every memory from the deepest corners of my mind, then watched only half of it before picking on the next one. She was quite powerful but completely mad. Perhaps I only ever became good at Occlumency because I needed these practices to stop.
Our lives, once the doors of 12 Grimmauld Place are shut, will be our own. There’ll be no stares, no comments, no judgements, and we’ll live according to our whims as far, of course, as our respective careers will allow it.
“It wasn’t a gay thing then?” he asked, keeping his voice really low. I didn’t quite understand what he was talking about, and I must have pulled a face. “You know,” Seamus added, confidence in what he was saying increasing with every word. “A gay thing. The two of you – both blokes – and you realised, when you were writing that you were both into that. So, you pursued each other, and your feelings grew from there.”
Harry, you looked so stunning tonight. I must admit that I didn’t have the highest of expectations in your promise to dress up. Forgive me, love, but I have never once seen you not sporting a crumpled shirt, loose collar, and messy tie knot. But Merlin, your robes suit you so well. And they will be perfect for the ceremony as well. It fits perfectly around your shoulders and your chest, looks casual but very elegant. I was a little to dumb-struck to compliment you in detail, but your arse looks fabulous in these trousers.
