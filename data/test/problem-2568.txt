"You’re that certain?" Hermione asked almost desperately, The moment her ‘Parents’ had told her about her adoption she’d felt more alone in the world than ever before. Maybe if Harry was her Cousin, she wouldn’t have to be. Maybe she could live with him, after all, now that she knew her ‘parents’ had decided she could ‘move out’. She was staying in a shelter for now. Not that she’d ever bother Harry or Ron with her problems. They barely knew about her troubles with the Grangers.
“GET STUFFED YOU BLOODY FAT ASS!” Harry barked back. He’d stopped calling the man Uncle long ago and finally began fighting back last summer. It helped that all the manual labor they’d forced him to do had allowed him to fill out and develop firm muscle. There wasn’t much Vernon or Dudley could bully him into now that he was physically stronger then both of them.
Draco turned on the boulder he was perched on, “Looking at the moon?” He raised an eyebrow at the other boy, “That a crime now Potter?”
Blaise leaned forward cautiously, “Malfoy, -”
… Leo was shirtless. Leo’s bare naked torso was on display for everyone. Daphne and Tracy blushed fiercely, giggling shyly. Draco wanted to strangle them all for looking, that was for his eyes only dammit.
He stared down at the parchment before pinching the bridge of his nose to relieve his headache.
Paul scowled rolling his eyes, “Then you’re both weirdoes, I’m gone. Noah, walk me home.”
Remus and Harry looked between the two curiously before scoffing, “Pervs.”
“I thought we we’re going to the cinema?” Harry asked settling in across from him.
Draco quickly began kissing his neck and chest doing his best to distract him.
Spotting his target down the hall Julian smirked, right… that’s why.
Hermione frowned uncertainly, “Well yes, but what do you mean by Mental warfare?” the curly haired brunette scrunched her nose at the term.
Harry hung up without waiting for a reply and slowly climbed off his bed reaching for his old wooden baseball bat just as the window slid open. Harry clutched the bat threateningly as someone clutched the window sill and climbed through.
Julian nodded a grim frown on his face, “The so called security measures taken to protect Nicholas Flamel’s Sorcerer’s Stone, were frighteningly easy to dismantle. A three headed dog, lulled to sleep by music. A plant that can be frightened off by a spell we learn in first year. Flying Key’s. A Chessboard. A Troll. And a riddle… three eleven year olds made it through without a problem.”
Draco squirmed still trying to process how he’d wound up straddling the taller boys lap in the small narrow… tunnel? Draco reached out blindly for a wall feeling nothing but air. What was this? How had Leo known about it? He shifted moodily annoyed at the unanswered questions building up in his head.
Harry faltered frowning slightly, before hugging her tightly, “Don’t worry Car-bear, we’ll all be together soon.”
Draco reached over his clothed bulge pressing against Harry’s bare ass as he shuffled through the drawer. Harry moaned loudly rubbing against him like a bitch in heat. Draco smirked as he grabbed the bottle giving two sharp thrusts against the bo pressing against Harry’s bare ass as he shuffled through the drawer. Harry moaned loudly rubbing against him like a bitch in heat. Draco smirked as he grabbed the bottle giving two sharp thrusts against the boy causing him to gasp and cry out.
Hello AO3,
Draco waited for his to nod before slowly pulling out and then forcing them back in, Harry cried out again he never realized how vocal he could be. Pretty soon harry was practically fucking himself onto four of Draco’s fingers and loving every second of it. Draco ripped his hand away and flipped Harry forcefully onto his back roughly replacing his fingers as he leaned over Harry to watch his face, “You truly are a virgin whore kitten.” Draco chuckled lustfully licking his lips as Harry struggled to find a way to keep moving on Draco’s fingers. Draco reached down wrapping his hand around Harry’s length working in time with his other hand Harry went wild before screaming and releasing all over his chest.
Julian slipped out of bed and snatched a quill and piece of scrap parchment off his desk scrawling a quick message to Carina and Lyra telling them to meet him in the common room. He grabbed his wand and charmed the parchment into an origami broom and sent it off to the girls' dorm.
“I’m not too broken up about it, I’ll just skip it anyway,” He drawled lazily, internally cringing at the arrogant tone in his voice, but it had to be done for his plan to work.
The boy leaned his arm against the wall over his head, he had realized how much taller the boy was as he’d only ever seen him from far away. He was even more attractive up close. His wild blond hair was windswept obviously from flying his pale cheeks flushed with color, sweat clung to his hair and body and if Harry wasn’t mistaken his breathing was a bit heavier than normal. The boy had obviously just finished flying.
Harry laughed humorlessly, “Gran is always trying to resolve the tension between Mum and Aunt Petunia. It’ll never happen though… not after what they did.”
“That’s nice dear,” her mother mumbled not looking up from her work or even pausing to acknowledge her daughter.
“Of course Liebe Frau (2), Is this about the experiment you’re doing with the Wolfsbane Potion?” Draco asked in actually interest, that’s not to say he wasn’t interested in Charles Potter’s work as a member of the Wizengamot. He’d just never held in interest in Politics, experimental Potions work however had always been a Passion of his.
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
“Hey Potter, did you get the essay in Charms, I think I made a complete mess of mine.”
Glancing up at the Teachers table Harry shivered at the sharp look the man sent the Slytherin table, his  gaze sweeping over the table before settling on…, Harry started in surprise when a hand settled on his shoulder, “Potter, everything alright?”
English Translation
"I know," Sirius moaned in distress, shaking his ankle in a futile attempt to dislodge the undergarments.
Draco knew that a Malfoy was never supposed to open unmarked mail, for Malfoy’s had many enemies, especially during this time of war. But Draco was feeling rebellious, so he tore into the mail anyway.
Draco raised a surprised brow, before a slow smile spread across his face. He understood now, he nearly pounced on the unsuspecting raven, as something an old friend once told him came hit him like a rogue bludger. Harry squealed struggling for a moment before he realized what the blonde was doing, “Wha… Draco, are you cuddling with me?”
Leo rolled his eyes, his smirk never faltering, “you have heard of dating haven’t you Draco?” As if it should’ve been the most obvious answer.
Adrian actually had to stifle a laugh as they rounded the corner listening to the echo of Pansy’s tantrum. “Well this is beginning to look like a promising alliance.”
Lyra and Carina exchanged worried looks while Julian shifted uncomfortably. The rest of the students in the hall started whispering amongst each other.
“And it will end Malfoy, because if Leo doesn’t Fuck you in the next thirty days or at the very least do something to indicate he’s given up. You’re going to back off.” Lyra continued, mirroring her sister’s stern expression.
Harry sighed in relief relaxing into the blondes hold, “So Vik, is he a friend of yours?” Harry asked curiously. He had a lot of making up to do, he wanted to know everything about Draco.
“No it’s alright… another time. You’re right; it’s been too long since we’ve had any time alone.” He leaned up, kissing Harry’s jaw line and following it up to his ear, tugging lightly on his earlobe with his teeth.
Draco shouted in protest footsteps thundering after him. Thinking on his feet Harry darted around a tree hiding from site.
“I like it,” she laughed weakly as she was led away from the agency. So it would be a few more nights in at the shelter than. Maybe she’d tell Harry and Ron about being kicked out soon. She was tired of having to hide her things from desperate runaways looking for quick money.
“Ronald?” Hermione asked, lacing their fingers together, and waiting patiently for a response.
"Yes!"
Julian nodded, lips twitching in amusement, “What we’re going to do is simple. We’re going to do WHATEVER we want. Anything from skipping class to mouthing off to the teachers, you feel like doing it, be my guest. Feel free to ignore any detention you’re given as well, but we can’t jump into this right away. The Headmaster may get suspicious and we might push him into a corner and make him take drastic measures. So we have to do it gradually, start small. A snide remark here, a verbal attack there, we’ve only got one rule. DON’T let your grades slip. You’re no good to us stupid. We won’t hold your hand later in life when you can’t do anything for yourself. If your grades take a hit because they’re trying to force you into behaving, whatever, at least you’re actual education isn’t taking a hit. We’ll send copies of any work we think was graded unfairly to a colleague of ours who’ll look them over and re-grade them. It won’t change the grade on file but we’ll know were doing well.”
"I told you I'd be rough," Leo chuckled before grinding their hips together causing Draco to moan loudly his head falling back into the wall surprisingly not hurting at all. He whimpered feeling nervous as Leo's hand inched closer to his ass.
“Orion,” Draco insisted coolly, voice eerily calm.
Draco chuckled lightly, still looking a little uncomfortable.
“Leo have you seen- Oh my I’m so sorry!” Draco froze eyes wide as he spotted their third year Defense Teacher quickly exit the room. Throughout it all Leo never faltered or stopped, seemingly ignoring it all. Well Draco defiantly couldn’t!
Harry shrugged, “I get it from my dad.”
Theo sighed as she moved passed him, he wasn’t about to tell her, Draco would be more concerned with Zabini getting caught. No need to frighten her even more.
Well this defiantly killed any denial he made to being Gay. He was pretty sure kissing a guy and liking it meant he was. Or was Lyra right? Was it just Draco? Did he care? Did he want this? Did he really just leave the boy there after kissing him senseless? Leo skidded to a halt in the middle of the hall looking back down the Hall.
Harry panted heavily after releasing the other boy smiling sheepishly, “Sorry, I thought you might’ve been having me on when you said that.”
Blaise rolled his eyes, face tense with anger, “You should have come to me.”
Leo grimaced scratching his neck, causing the blonde to raise a brow at him. “Is the notion of dating me so disturbing?”
Harry shifted guiltily, “Found it when I was cleaning the Attic.”
Orion bent to drop a quick kiss to a startled Harry’s cheek and wave to her fellow Gryffindors before linking her arm with Draco’s.
"Ah yes, my apologies Nott. Where are my manners? You wanted to speak to me?" Leo drawled casually, pinching the bridge of his nose to stave off a head ache.
“Leo,” Draco breathed winding his free arm around the older boys shoulders in a loose hug.  He wasn’t sure how he felt  about Leo just yet, but he was finding his way there. Eventually, he was confident he would say it back, he would be able to tell Leo with every confidence that he loved him. He was sure of it.
Blaise nodded with and exasperated frown, “Draco then, is Black-” he frowned as the girl cut him off insisting he call her Orion. “Is Orion going to be joining us every day.”
"You mean Prewett right?" Leo smirked at Molly's shocked expression. He almost felt sorry for the woman. Julian was not going to be very forgiving.
“He seems alright I guess, Malfoy Pucey will be in the third room of our shared suite. Nott, Goyle, and Crabbe all share the other suite.” Draco nodded glad to finally have faces with the names of the two ‘bodyguard’ like boys who seemed to be waiting for him to come back.
Searching his face skeptically Draco nodded, allowing a slight smile to curl his lips. “Good.”
I've placed Photo's of Orion Black and Mikhail Koshkov at the beginning of this chapter as well as updating chapter 6 to include their photo's. Thank you LittleYepa for your help! Also WARNING TAGS HAVE BEEN UPDATED PLEASE READ BEFORE CONTINUING YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED, READING PAST THIS POINT IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRESION AND ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TAGS.
Draco winced, “Has everyone left already?”
Harry and Draco nodded in embarrassment, staring at the table. Sirius nodded, “alright then, I’ll leave telling your parents about your… relationship, up to you. We won’t mention this ever again. Just know Malfoy, I know where you live,” Sirius jerking his thumb at the window behind him where they could see Draco’s house.
Draco’s eye brows hit raised in surprise, snapping his him forward roughly.
Julian immediately picked up the left one, “This is Felix Felicis, it’s denser and more resembles molten gold where as the other,” he set the first one down and picked up the other one, “This one has the density of a thick soup, still dense but not as, indicating that it’s the Girding Potion.”
"Right let's go find my sister." Carina grinned excitedly, thoughts of a happy home and warm hugs filling her mind.
“I don’t want them to come,” Harry whispered in a scratchy voice.
“MR Prewett, did I just hear you admit you’re planning to ignore a teachers order?” Professor Snape called warningly, heels clicking obnoxiously as he stormed over, Julian cocked an amused brow. My, my, he had pissed him off hadn’t he?
"I'm not saying he isn't. I mean Merlin the boy is fit. Very fit. I mean that body. Rock hard abs, bulging pecks, broad shoulders…"
Carina laughed crawling out of Ron's lap and tossing herself into Leo's to hug him. She hadn’t lost him then.
Draco sighed closing the book, tossing it carelessly onto the table, before turning to glare accusingly at Carina.
I've been made aware that it might be difficult to keep up with some of the different names that I've changed. so at the beginning and end of each chapter I'll try to remember to post this note!
Harry stopped at his door spinning and pulling Draco in to a deep and passionate kiss pressing himself back against the door. The kiss seemed to kick start Draco’s brain and pretty soon he was pinning Harry to the door on his own.
“What?” Draco demanded quietly, glancing around wildly for eavesdroppers.
DMDMDMDMDMDMDMDMDMDMDMDMDMDM DMDMDMDMDMDMDMDMDMDMDMDMDMDM DMDMDMDMDMDMDMDM DMDMDMDMDMDMDMDM
Lyra mumbled something sulkily into his thigh before biting it. Julian flinched and tugged sharply at a loose strand of her hair, “Ouch.” He stated firmly, warning her without saying it, not to do it again.
Winter break…
Harry tilted his head thinking over what he’d just said and trying to figure out what could’ve embarrassed the blonde. He couldn’t think of anything… unless.
Draco blushed, feeling a semi hard… ahem. Well. That was interesting.
“You’re being shunned,” Malfoy stated, a faint wrinkle creasing his brow, Leo didn’t seem the type to ignore his family, Padfoot had mentioned multiple times how protective the boy was of the Twins.
Ten minutes later the door jerked open and a confused Carina peeked in before entering with Lyra, and Millie following after, both frowning curiously.
“Why did you bother leaving it down if you were just going to tie it back?” Millie asked in amusement, as they walked to class. She never understood the constant need in girls to change their hairstyle nearly every day. It’s one of the reasons she kept her dark brown hair in an admittedly messy ponytail most days. She sneered at a group of Ravenclaw boys eyeing Lyra and Daphne as they passed. She didn’t mind hanging out with the girls, she didn’t even mind that she was overlooked in their presence. Daphne and Lyra spent time on themselves in the morning. Millicent didn’t see a point to it, if the only reason a boy spoke to her was based on her appearance and, not on who Millicent herself was she wanted nothing to do with him. Now don’t get the wrong impression she was by no means ugly. Her heart shaped face, button nose, and slender frame was a constant source of pride for her mother. The woman was always lamenting that her daughter wasted her good looks, and that she would never be a beautiful as she was now… You can why she resents shallow people no?
“I’m sorry alright,” Leo gritted out between his teeth. “I didn’t mean to hurt your pride. I just don’t understand why you were being nice, and you can’t really blame me because you’ve never been before! I’m sorry.”
Draco’s mind was racing in a panic as he nodded stiffly wondering when the other teen could’ve seen that, he’d charmed the door so no one could see through-… Draco closed his eyes holding in a groan, as his stomach turned, he’d messed up. When Harry tackled him on the train the door was open, anyone could’ve seen them.
Draco sneered, stepping back and leaning against the wall arms crossed defensively across his chest.
Draco caught his chin before he could look away, “Why would you ask me that?”  He demanded, anger nearly disguising the hurt in his voice.
you were going?” the smirk had melted into a serious expression, delight danced in his eyes at the panic Draco couldn’t help but express. “It’s referred to as ‘the anchoring charm’ it keeps things in place until the castor moves them… handy I’d say.”
A few weeks later
“No Mum,-” Hermione tried, rising slightly from her chair.
Draco scowled glancing back at Blaise and Adrian suspiciously. The two held their hands up defensively.
Delilah’s fault.
The others sighed bidding him goodnight, they knew he wouldn’t be back tonight.
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
Harry’s eyes widened as Draco leaned over him shuffling through the drawer again for the box of condoms he’d seen earlier, they’d be going with him later. Harry wouldn’t need them without him anyway. He’d destroy the other sizes and keep the X-large to use later with Harry.
They were still Julian’s cousins, just not Molly and Arthur’s children. Molly was being paid to take care of them as well.
“Maybe it’s because EVERY time you ‘apologize’, if you can even call it that. It’s because it’s OBVIOUS you don’t really mean it. I understand that you don’t like me Potter. Hell I wouldn’t like me if I was in your position. I meant it when I said you had nothing to be sorry for, I can’t really hold the truth against you, can I? I had only thought that MAYBE if I was nice to you I could make up for that, I’ll admit it was a stretch and more than a bit presumptuous but I figured it was worth a shot. Why? Because I LIKED you Potter. I REALLY liked you. Now I’ll admit I went about it wrong, but I don’t really have much experience with that sort of thing. So I’m SORRY if everyone is picking on you about this, and I’m SORRY if this makes things worse but FUCK YOU Potter! This is NOT my fault, this is on YOU! And you are NOT going to bully me into feeling bad about something YOU did! I WILL NOT let you! So you can just go to HELL Potter!” Malfoy was nearly shouting by the end, his face red with fury.
Lyra and Carina squealed jumping around happily, Millie laughed joyously as they each grabbed one of her arms and dragged her off.
Mikhail snorted, almost looking offended, “You didn’t honestly think Rion and I were just going to let you leave us behind did you?” He asked in slightly accented English, Draco and Orion usually spoke in Bulgarian when they were at school but he was pretty fluent in English.
Millie shrugged, when she noticed Theo’s hand twitch on the table indicating she had the girls attention, “Nothing that’s proving useful or to our advantage.”
Harry was shuffling through the old boxes in the Attic. He really needed to learn to control his temper. Maybe he wouldn’t always wind up in situations like this. Petunia had informed him that they were donating all her Mothers and Fathers old things to charity. The neighbors had donated their sons old things now that he was off at college, and Petunia would be Damned if anyone thought themselves better than the Dursley’s so Harry was to pack up all her parents old things and pack them into the back of Vernon’s car to drop off after work tomorrow as a ‘Family’. Harry was also informed that ‘No he was most defiantly not invited’. Dudley had of course thrown a tantrum when he learned that he WAS going. He’d claimed they liked Harry better. Harry had laughed at the futile attempt to make his parents change their mind. At his laughter his Aunt informed him that he’d be fixing the fence tomorrow for bullying his cousin. He’d promptly stopped laughing and stomped off to his cell er ‘room’.
Two days before Harry’s Birthday James woke up and the family hurried over to the Hospital. Both Lily and Remus agreeing it would be best to wait and tell James about Draco before leaving for school.
Mikhail rounded on her catching the collar of her robes, over at Hufflepuff Cedric jumped up rushing to defend her.
Blaise shrugged, a very un-Blaise thing to do, Draco noted, “You said yourself Potter, not everything is as it seems. After that it wasn’t hard to figure out.”
Orion clapped loudly quickly followed by Harry and his friends though they were slightly disappointed in his placement.
Harry blushed  remembering the day they’d met, before scowling sulkily.
Lyra and Leo looked up from the Map, the Marauders Map truly was useful, annoyance flashing across their faces. Theo who’d obviously chased her the whole way back leaned against the wall trying to catch his breath.
Sirius’ face softened slightly, and he sighed before leaning back against the counter, “And what does that have to do with me finding you in bed together?”
“Harry?” Hermione called in concern, sitting on the bed near his head to rub his back, “Is something wrong.”
Orion quirked a brow fighting a smile while Mikhail shook his head sympathetically, glancing around him at the two.
“What?” Leo softened considerably and looked at the two girls. Their gaze immediately dropped to the floor. “Oh.”
Carina looked shocked, "Who?" She asked eagerly not seeming to register his use of the past-tense.
The blonde strolled casually closer seeming perfectly at home in Harry’s room.
“Don’t come to Pomfrey, if anything dire comes up you’ll only wind up in Saint Mungos anyway. See Tracy before even contemplating coming here. Malfoy,” Prewett nodded sharply at the blonde, before smirking at the Potions Master, “Professor,” he drawled mockingly, with a cheeky little grin.
“Lo.” He grunted.
“Yes… it’s absolutely, perfect.” A slow but crazed laugh echoed throughout the entire room. A few of the Previous Headmasters futilely attempting to escape their paintings, but alas they were trapped as they had been since the man became Headmaster. Phineas Nigellus Black remembered a time long ago where the Headmasters Paintings would roam free, offering aid to lost First Years, comfort to the Homesick Muggleborns, and advice to those who need only ask. But it had been a long time since those days, he frowned idly surveying the room, ignoring the hysterical former Headmistress Dilys Derwent in the Portrait beside him. If only he could leave this Painting he could warn someone in the Black house. If his portrait still hung in it that is. Oh well, might as well sleep, it’s all he could do anyway.
Leaving the door open behind him, the raven quickly found his bed and fell onto it face first.
“Potter you dropped your quill.”
“Hello Harry, no greeting for your old Granddad?”
Julian was leaning casually against the wall beside the Slytherin common room, waiting for Theo and Millie to come out. The Slytherins he had sent in to get them had seemed suspicious about him knowing where the common room was. He had told them he and Leo found it back in second year, but hadn’t cared enough to figure out the password. It was true, if they were going to win over Slytherins they couldn’t start by fooling them completely. They couldn’t start by being completely honest though either. Julian really hated waiting. The wall shifted and Draco Malfoy stepped out straightening his robes as he came.
Throwing up the door when he got home he saw a note on the hall mirror from his Mother. They were going to be away for the week on a mission for the Auror Department. Sirius would be checking on him every afternoon. His dad was the top Auror for the department and his mum was his partner. She was actually a Healer but they called her in from time to time when a mission was thought to be too dangerous not to bring a healer.
Leo smirked, “Millie, Love, I’m Leo Bloody Potter. I’ve got plenty of successful companies, firms, hospitals, research facilities that I OWN. If you play your part right and you could stroll right into any career you want and soar through the ranks. Most especially if you’re in my good graces. So… are you in?”
In the Library Zabini and Malfoy were sitting in a secluded corner. Draco sat stiffly in the seat next to his tall olive-skinned friend, while Zabini sat relaxed with his back to the wall in a chair he conjured.
"Excellent," Leo smirked, shaking his hand firmly, and they resumed walking.
Draco jumped and looked up with a nasty glare. “Bloody hell!”
“I’m still horny from earlier we can hang out tomorrow,” Harry grumbled grabbing Draco’s hand and dragging him up the stairs.
The Dwarf grunted a gnarled toothless smile before hobbling off to the Kitchen, grunting out a polite “Lord Black,” as he went.
“Kitten, NO one can make me give you up. And to chase anyone else would mean leaving you wide open to anyone watching… I’m not about to let that happen. You have all of my attention, only you.” Draco raised an amused brow, “Besides, I highly doubt anyone there is as tight and satisfying as you. You make the sexiest sounds.”
Julian scoffed raking a hand through his hair roughly, “Poor bastard doesn’t realize the kind of man Dumbledore is.”
"Does it say anything about my dad or any siblings?" Hermione asked through her tears.
Draco looked around in confusion, “Hold on… where are we?”
Sirius growled, he was determined to make things right, "But we will find her and Dumbledore will pay for his transgressions."
Harry flushed in embarrassment scowling as he pushed roughly at Draco’s chest. “Piss off pervert!”
Blaise raised a skeptical brow appearing amused, but nodded in acceptance, “The common rooms are this way. Slytherin has the whole of the Dungeons so each Year has their own section off the main commons and then it’s three to a Suite, all with our own rooms of course. Suppose I wouldn’t mind if we shared a suite with you.”
Draco never thought one simple word could make him melt so spectacularly.
Harry shrugged guiltily, “I was busy.”
George reached for the letter after Julian pulled it from the pouch, Fred leaned over his shoulder silently reading.
Leo was laughing, bent over with his head between his knees laughing. Draco stared at him as if he were mad, he’d no idea what the boy found so amusing, that had really hurt.
It's been a long time since I posted on here, and my only excuse is fear. I was afraid of the reaction I would get posting chapters after disappearing for so long. I was afraid no one would be reading this after so long, that everyone had abandoned this story and didn't care about it anymore. After I while I felt I had waited too long to even try. Now after a recent comment, i'm wondering if maybe I had been too concerned with how long the chapters were taking... I still have a rough draft of the next chapter, and now after two years of not posting my life is very different and It might take me a bit longer to update then it use to. But I do love this story and I still have an idea of where I want it to go. Please comment and let me know, if I get enough people telling me they still want to read this story, then i'll edit and upload the next chapter and begin the following chapter.
“Come on now, too shy to even see your own?” Draco smirked, looking the very picture of a sadistic demon in that moment. Harry blushed even more in humiliation and began crawling toward the other side of the bed toward his pants and jeans, “Maybe we should just go downstairs again.”
Draco sighed tapping the sharp metal point of his Quill on his desk. He’d finished writing and answering the questions from the board ten minutes ago. Now he was watching the hourglass in the corner of the room waiting for the sand to run down on his Defense lesson. Glancing at his watch Draco sighed noting they had at least five minutes left in the class.
The boy who he’d seen roll his eyes, leaned his hip against the pool table as he eyed Draco with a sharp calculating glint in his eye. Draco studied the other boy as well, from his dark brown ‘just got shagged’ hair to the carefully maintained muscles that showed even through his robes. Draco glanced at Blaise noticing the same athletic play of muscle through his robes. The Quidditch team most likely, “Charmed.”
“Shush, just relax!” Draco urged holding Harry’s hip still and whipping his tears with his thumb.
“What about me?” Draco huffed, scowling as he released the other boy, only to trap him as he braced both hands on the table.
The room froze and Harry shifted nervously standing in front of the blonde defensively, “Um… Mum, Your home, is Dad with you?”
Harry didn’t listen immediately tensing up in pain. “Harry relax!”
"Whatever,” Ron sighed in exasperation, not understanding her passionate response.
“Harry?”
“For the most part,” Draco chuckled sitting up, “Merlin I hate Lucius and Narcissa. I hate their stupid rules, I mean what’s wrong with having a bit of fun? Being free? Why can’t they let me be… me?” Draco sighed shoving his hands in his hair, and pulling at it.
Draco sat reading over the letter repeatedly, it was short but the information it held was endless. Draco could read between the lines. Leo had a very hard childhood, which was clear in his need for control and respect. Leo was definitely going to be a hard nut to crack.
Millicent nodded knowingly, “He really knows the subject, most people are surprised when they find out that potions isn’t his favorite subject-”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yes she is." Leo snarled, sensing the underlying exasperation.
Petunia quickly dried her hands, and took the Album with shaky hands, "Where did you get this?" she demanded shakily.
Draco couldn’t resist the small pout on the boy’s lips and forgave him with a quick kiss, “Hello love, how was the rest of your summer?”
Leo raised a skeptical eyebrow, “And you’re not now?”
"Okay, meet us in the subway restaurant at this address, in two hours, I already promised them I’d be there." Leo grabbed Remus' hand and scribbled out the address with an ink pen from his pocket.
Blaise eyed Leo critically, seemingly over their family based debate, “I have your answer Potter.”
A slow grin spread across his face, he braced his hand on either side of Harry hips and leaned in for a deep passion filled kiss, “I think that more motivation for me to come back then the boxers.”
With a matching evil smile Lyra shared a look with her sister.
Malfoy nodded checking it, “Thanks, I need the fairy wings please.”
Harry flopped forward panting heavily as Draco rummaged through the drawer. He was surprised when Draco roughly flipped him onto his back.
Ignoring the indignant look on his new Slytherin ‘friends’ faces Draco spun to look down at Orion, “Join us at the Slytherin table would you, I’d like to discuss a few things.” Orion smiled ignoring Mikhail’s affronted protest.
“Of course I’m right,” Orion scoffed looking as though she were offended he’d thought otherwise, “I’m a Black.”
“Can I stay here tonight?”
Taking a deep calming breath Draco allowed his brain to work through it, he needed to find a way to do this as covertly as possible without alerting his parents to the situation. This had to be handled delicately.
Harry turned over to look at the blonde, a mischievous sparkle in his eye, “Like pranks?”
“The Legendary Room of Requirement, rumor stated only the summoner can call on the room. Anyone else must have the original Summors permission to access the requested room. The room can become anything you need. A study, a supply closet, even a loo. If someone’s already in the room it’s impenetrable unless you’re granted access. Black and Nott left the door open, that’s the only reason we’re here. I must say I’m impressed Potter. Finding the lost Room of Requirement, very impressive.” Blaise smirked taking a quick glance around the room, filing everything away for later.
“Really, let’s give Rae the grand tour.” Leo smirked at the bouncing girl, he had a lot to make up for and it felt good to see her smile again. He never wanted to make Lyra or Carina cry again, he’d protect them with everything he had.
Carina chuckled lightly leaning into Theo, who wrapped an arm around her shoulders casually, “We see that.”
“It’s Leo! MERLIN, just call me Leo, dammit!” Leo shouted, clutching his hair as if he wanted to just rip it out of his head.
“But of course, mien kind,” Amelia smiled, the mischievous spark leaving her eyes for a more serious look, as they led the awkwardly (The Dursley’s and the Evan’s) silent group to the Dining room. “Harry tells me you dabble in experimental Potions. Well it just so happens the Potions Lab I work in will be in need of a new intern next summer as our present one will be graduating this year and moving on to his Mastery.”
Leaning over the table Harry placed a soft kiss on the blondes’ lips, “More than. I love this Draco.”
Ron- Julian Michael Prewett (Fabian Prewett's Only son)
“Did you honestly piss off
Draco looked relieved.
Carina nodded pulling back to look him in the eye, “No one will look at you differently if you are, we just want you happy love.”
Harry's POV
Harry complied, face pinching slightly at the new even fuller feeling.
Draco stared in shock as he reached for his zipper, "Now?" he asked in disbelief.
Leo growled, he wanted to punch a wall, "Your cousin is disgusting Prewett."
“What’s wrong with Rina?” Leo asked in a deceptively polite tone, raising an inquiring eyebrow at the panicking boy, setting the scroll down again.
“Draco,” The young man corrected coolly.
Draco's two best friends Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson looked up from their homework and rolled their eyes. They always did Homework in Draco’s rooms. They could be themselves here.
Draco smiled coldly, “I’m a Malfoy… remember?”
The three Slytherins made their way down the Hall toward the dorms, only to come face to face with Pansy and two unfamiliar Slytherin girls.
"Draco," He corrected breathlessly, eyeing up the boys strong well-muscled chest that he could just barely make out in the thin fitted dark green cashmere sweater.
Draco glared before shoving off the wall and invading Harry’s personal space, “Who needs one when I can fuck them for free?”
The Slytherins paled further and Tracy promptly fainted, or pretended as her ‘cover’ indicated she should. Despite the situation they had to stay in character.
xXxXxXx
Leo leaned back in his chair staring at a spot on the table in front of him. He had no idea what was going on. He let his mind wonder until the bell rang and he stood grabbing his bag. He watched Malfoy pack up quickly only pausing for a moment to nod a polite “See you later Potter,” before hurrying out the door with Parkinson and Zabini.
Harry choked turning back to the Car, a brand new red 1995 Bentley Continental. “No I couldn’t!” He protested.
Sirius raised a brow, silently demanding an explanation.
“Impressive… show me.” Leo insisted, gesturing with a hand for her to begin.
Carina crossed her legs rubbing her hands along her thighs absently as she attempted to wake herself up, "Yeah, why the sudden wakeup call, it’s 2 in the morning you know."
Draco couldn’t be more excited for it. The days following his amazing date with Leo were boring and he’d waited impatiently for the last few weeks before winter break to pass. Now it was finally here. Draco boarded the train glancing back at Blaise to nod agreeing with whatever he’d just asked him, he couldn’t really be bothered because Leo had boarded just before him , his hand brushing teasingly yet subtly over Draco’s bum as he’d passed him. And now Draco could hardly think.
“You realize I’m taking these all with me later right.” Draco drawled finally finding the right box.
Leo frowned of course Snape was going to attempt to trip him up. They were discussing the Girding Potion.
"Uh Huh, hm, Hermione Granger ah here we are. Oh it looks like your name was changed would you like to know what it was?" The woman smiled comfortingly.
Draco turned to look at her questioningly, raising a pale sleek brow.
“I don’t really care if he likes it or not, Dumbledore’s on my shit list and I’m planning on making his life hell this year," Leo smirked.
Harry- Leo Harry-James Potter
Draco could admit it to himself. He’d fallen in love with the boy. Draco Malfoy fell in love with Leo Harry-James Potter. His ancestors were rolling in their graves.
Hermione- Carina Aurora Black (Harry's Cousin)
“Alright for the most part, until we can trust you, you will be given basic information that won’t cripple us if it was to get out. We still don’t want you spreading around alright?” Leo explained coldly, ruthless leader mask firmly back in place.
“Coward,” Harry mused eyeing him in mock disappointment, “That’s a cop out. Too bad really you seem like a good person but you’re too scared to let anyone in. Such a shame.”
“So why did our old Defense teacher just walk in on us?” Draco demanded dryly, unimpressed with the taller boys blasé attitude.
Draco’s eyes bulged as a burning heat crept over his body his stomach clenching pleasantly.
Draco nods frowning slightly, “Tinsel I order you to join me at Hogwarts this Year. I’ll need my personal Elf while at school. Should Lucius or Narcissa Malfoy call for you, you are not to heed them. I’ll send word once we arrive at Hogwarts. After dropping me off you are to go to Hogwarts and check in with the Headmaster inform him that you have my permission to help there in any way possible but that I am your main priority.”
Carina smiled as Theo massaged her shoulders staring at the Television screen, she was in the process of introducing the boy to her favorite Television series ‘Doctor Who’, the skeptical Slytherin had immediately become hooked requesting they watch it whenever Carina asked him what he’d like to do. Though the boy always insisted they didn’t have to if she didn’t want too, he was so sweet she couldn’t help but indulge his newfound guilty pleasure, her smile only grew as he placed a tender kiss to her temple silently encouraging her to fully relax back against him. It was another reason she had no trouble indulging the boy, despite his attention being mostly on the TV he never ignored her, he was always tending to her. Like now for instance, he’d begun rubbing her shoulders the moment he noticed how tense she’d become, and showered with tender kisses now and again. This usually resulted in Carina slowly drifting off to sleep against his chest waking only when it was time for supper. But this time,… Carina reached up twisting to place a soft adoring kiss on the startled boys lips. Theo responded of course, cocking his head with a bemused smile when she pulled back.
Blaise blinked, glancing back at Adrian, before looking back at Draco frowning uncertainly, “What, no.”
Harry could barely breathe as he stared up into the entrancing Blue-Gray eyes. Harry had never seen eyes like his before. The two colors seemed to blend in some areas and separate in others. His eyes follow the ring of dark blue surrounding the outer edges of his iris. Harry blushed even harder noticing the amused quirk of Draco’s lips.
Leo rolled his eyes hooking an arm around Carina’s neck ignoring the scowl on her face, “Relax Car, and quit frowning, you’ll get wrinkles.” He chuckled pressing a kiss to her brow.
“Such a Gentleman, you must be popular with the ladies,” Draco scoffed sarcastically, smirking unrepentantly at the mystified frown the other Slytherin shot his way after he dragged the blonde through a false wall by the collar of his robes. Readjusting his tie he nodded for the other boy to continue leading the way.
Carina shot him a skeptical smirk, “Right of course he did, funny how they all seem to offend you.”
2 is a supernatural X Harry Potter crossover. Here's a quick sneak peak!
“Plain and simple, No I’m not involved with Malfoy, and no I’m not gay, one word answers it all, no.” Leo sighed scanning the page in his defense text, they’d made him lose his place. Julian and the Twins shifted subtly fighting the urge to laugh. The two girls had been hinting towards this for a while, ever since the confrontation with Draco after Leo spiked his ‘dates’ tea with Fungiface Potion causing the boys face to grow a foul smelling fungus.
“Let go Draco,” he panted, breathless with desire, “Cum for me.”
Draco walked into the Great Hall feeling uneasy. He hadn’t heard from Smith in almost twenty four hours and rumors were flying that he was missing. His Ravenclaw friends had begun asking others if they’d seen him around, the Headmaster had made an announcement. Draco glanced at Leo and his group, who were sitting calmly at their table. Draco was concerned, did Leo do this? Was it because of the kiss they shared? Did he know Smith was blackmailing him? Did he know what he was being blackmailed for?
Harry scowled, “Part of being a boyfriend is satisfying all of your boyfriends needs… I want you to fuck me now.”
Draco grunted as they landed with a thud… in a sandbox? Before he could investigate that thought further Harry was tangling his fingers in his hair and attacking his mouth. Draco’s brows shot up in surprise, before mentally shrugging. He could live with this. The movie could wait until next time. Draco rolled them over so Harry was the one laying in the sand.
“Not sitting with his Highness today Nott?” Malfoy asked coolly, though the look on his face was more than a little curious.
Draco arched a brow at the… figure, and the unnerving rattling gasping sound it made, chills running up and down his spin. This was… creepy.
Orion and Mikhail turned to greet him before pausing to look around him curiously at Blaise and Adrian who were watching Draco warily.
Looking at the girl in front of him, his heart ached, he knew nothing about her and yet she was family. She was his Aunt’s daughter. The girl looked like her sister, but was so different. The eyes, the cupids bow lips, the perfect cheekbones. Everything a pureblood should be copied perfectly on each girls face. The other girl beside him, his sister in nearly every way, shifted slowly before launching herself into the younger girl's arms. "Lyra!" "Carina!" the sisters clutched each other tightly as if the other would be ripped away at any given moment. He couldn’t help it as he reached out dragging both girls into his arms without separating them. He clutched them tightly to his chest unwilling to let go, not that they seemed to mind. The smaller of the two tucked her head under his chin and sighed contently. “Is this what being home feels like?” she asked quietly. Neither of them answered, they merely stood there embracing and just soaking up the much needed comfort.
“Hurry,” Harry glared impatiently.
"My brother."
Draco grinned reaching over the table to mess Harry’s hair, dislodging some left over sand, “Remus said you liked pizza. Lily said you liked Movies. So I thought why not the classic Dinner and a movie date. Sirius helped me set up the Pizza part, he also went to Gringotts and exchanged a few Gallons for Muggle Currency so we could come here and go to the cinema.”
“I’m impressed,” Blaise admitted giving up when he spotted the knowing smirk on the blonde’s face.
Julian glanced up from his book eyes studying her curiously before he beckoned her in gesturing to the seat across from him as he marked his page with a feathered bookmark. Pansy awkwardly but gracefully slipped into the room plopping down into the surprisingly soft seat.
Leo grinned at him unrepentantly… god he was sexy.
Harry, and admittedly many other students jumped as Mikhail slammed his hands down on the table, standing abruptly. His jaw tense and fury in his eyes he smiled tightly at the affronted look on Professor McGonagall’s face.
Remus sighed setting down his quill and turning to offer a stern look. “She’s also a fifteen year old girl Padfoot. Your smothering her, remember what you were like at fifteen?”
Carina finally let the tears spill over, allowing Theo to gently lead her over to one of the overstuffed arm chairs in the room. “I made a mistake.” She explained quietly, hand shaking over her mouth.
Carina leaned forward, giving him a stern look “So we are going to help you. In the end as we see it. Leo is either going to Fuck you, or beat the fuck out of you, it’s as simple as that. We aren’t picky so long as this ends.”
"Okay? What if I was a Deatheater?! Are you mental!?" Sirius scolded, peeking out of the bush to glare at his godson.
Millie tilted her head in amusement, “It takes a desperate soul to expose their true allegiance, before procuring a solid ally, to the enemy.”
“I could play up the single status. Start flirting, put up the sleazy Casanova front.” Julian suggested, shrugging awkwardly as if unsure. “You could put on the cold, emotionless, arrogant Lord Façade. More than you’re already doing anyway. Make them squirm.”
Harry and Draco exchanged surprised looks. Charles and Amelia Potter laughed merrily, at the expression on both boys faces. Lily, Sirius, and Remus just shook their heads in wary amusement.
“What if we accidently offend him?” Carina murmured, this was incredibly dangerous for two students. Dumbledore was one thing, having his Public image as a buffer. But possibly insulting a prominent Member of a dangerous Mob Family? “Dumbledore’s dangerous enough on his own, with the people’s faith on his side. An Italian Mob, one with no qualms about murdering two teens still in school? I don’t know about this.”
Orion nodded in agreement, turning to lean her shoulder against the wall as she leveled him with a look, “I’m not sure if you’re aware, but Draco’s never dated before.”
Harry flushed slightly knowing Draco had probably gotten that one from him watching American TV at his house. Draco grunted rolling his eyes and moving back to his seat, knowing Mikhail and Orion would be joining them.
Finally he pulled out the old Album, looking it over Harry could barely make out the worn gold script on the shabby old brown cover. He frowned in confusion at the words it looked like a woman had written it, though admittedly his Grandfather could have paid to have it done professionally.
Carina leaned forward, to look at her cousin in distress, “Leo, please listen to him.”
Draco straightened his robes idly glancing over his shoulder as he made his way toward the door. “I’m glad we could come to an understanding Severus. You really should’ve been kinder to me when I was small. Things could’ve been different,” Placing a hand on the doorknob he turned to smirk at the ashen and shaken looking man.
“A certain Gryffindor I saw you snogging on the train?” Adrian supplied calmly, raising a brow at the chilling glare Draco paused to shoot him. “This conversation would be better held in the privacy of our suite I think.”
And then he was gone. Draco leaned heavily against the wall attempting to quell his temper. He was in no way the tease in this situation. That title went to Leo Fucking Potter. Merlin help that boy if Draco found him before his temper calmed.
Draco startled awake when he heard a Door close. Leo was rubbing a towel roughly through his hair another wrapped loosely around his waist. Draco swallowed thickly watching a drop of water travel slowly down Leo’s perfectly sculpted chest.
I'm doing a Poll
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
“Can we… Can we have a moment… this is, it’s just a lot.” Fred mumbled no trace of the usual laughter or mischief in his eyes.
Noah shot Harry and Draco an apologetic look before jogging after the shorter boy.
Then he spotted Leo, or more specifically his legs… well he assumed it was Leo. He was under one of the Vekill’s with only his legs sticking out. Lyra rolled her eyes before passing Padfoot into Blaise’s arms, startling him and the Pup as she marched forward with a purpose. She crouched down glaring at his legs for a moment before grabbing one of his jean clad legs and tugging.
The blonde glanced around the small hall before spotting the dark wood door with a silver name plate reading 'Draco Malfoy' on it. Pushing his Magic into it and opening the door the blonde wasn't sure what to expect. But the bare impersonal room with all his things from home was definitely not it.
---Main pairings will be Dean/Harry and Sam/OC with a side of Draco/Jo
Cho lifted nose looking unrepentant.
Paul merely shrugged giving the blonde a heavy lidded smile.
Draco forced himself not to stiffen, blue-gray eyes widening imperceptibly, how had he noticed? “Why would you say that?” he asked as if the idea itself was foolish.
Theo could, on the other hand, be angry at the way they handled the situation. Even if she wasn’t as fragile as she was, Carina was only human, and humans make mistakes. Better yet she was a fifteen year old girl, to expect her to be perfectly sensible all the time was expecting too much. He needed to talk to Leo, whether Carina liked it or not the boy needed to know… he needed to know that he quite possibly just destroyed Carina’s steadfast trust in him. She’d now being second guessing her every word, every move, and every decision in his presence. And though Leo may be angry with her Theo was certain he’d never want that for her.
“Because if you and I were both Gryffindors, I’d have you screaming my name every night kitten,” Draco smirked devilishly.
"Come on Leo," Ron frowned looking disappointed in his friend, he understood being overprotective. He had been of Ginny before she’d started sleeping her way through his year, now he could hardly stand the sight of her. It was rumored she’d pressured most of the males in Hufflepuff into sleeping with her… he honestly wouldn’t be surprised anymore.
Julian nodded, “The other one isn’t mine.”
"Who's Violet?" He demanded following her as she moved to begin putting them away.
Harry blinked in surprise before scowling, “I wasn’t trying anything, I’m just –“
Harry groaned, Draco was going to torment him, he was dating a sadist. “Dracooooo!” He whined pitifully.
"Draco," he corrected breathily.
Draco shook his head insistently, “My Father’s never set foot on school grounds. It’s not permitted unless your child’s life is in danger. It would compromise the wards on the school, if parents were allowed to come and go as they please.”
So it made sense that he’d be tense and distrustful, in the man’s dank little office, which Snape had just led him into. The man grudgingly ordered him to sit in the chair across his desk.
Blaise Zabini stood leaning against the doorframe, starring coolly into Lyra’s eyes.
“Am I really that bad?” Draco blurted out, before he could stop himself.
“Longbottom, The Patil twins, Finch-Fletchley, and the Three Old Maids are basically on our ass’ as often as possible. So we need to do our best to be as obnoxious as possible, or make them so uncomfortable they don’t want to stick around. So, anyone have any thoughts?” Leo asked in a no nonsense tone.
Sirius chuckled softly, “Your Dad’s got a Saving- people thing, don’t know where it came from, but he’d never be satisfied in a hospital. He’s more active than that, he needs the thrill.”
Draco choked, and glanced warily at the tall Italian, he fidgeted uneasily at the cool look on the other man’s face.
Ginny smiled brightly nudging a red haired boy beside her. The boy rolled his eyes before extending a hand, “I’m Ron Weasley, Ginny’s older brother and Harry’s best mate.”
The four huffed before following his orders. Lyra pulled her chair as far from Goyle as possible and sat on the very edge of her seat doing her best to ignore his leering. Carina did the same sitting rigidly in her seat. Julian merely shrugged sitting beside the brunette calmly. Leo sat stiffly in his seat while Professor Snape lectured the class on their next project.
Lyra lifted her chin defiantly, “Well,
Harry frowned over his shoulder, “What’s us being in separate Houses got to do with whether they sleep or not?”
Theo nodded while Millicent smirked from behind him, she was obviously pleased with herself.
“Oh?” Leo cocked a brow as calm as if they were speaking of classes.
Draco scowled smacking him sharply upside the head.
"What!?" Remus demanded in shock, forgetting his musings the twin’s uncanny resemblance to their Uncle.
Blaise rolled his eyes in irritation, before strapping his wand back into its holster, “Fine, but be on your guard.”
“Oh, yeah? In Third year you threatened Pucey with Toilet paper… and then followed through!! I’m still not sure how you managed to put him in the Hospital Wing for a week with Toilet paper… or how you managed to get away with it!” Draco snapped he didn’t need Leo coming after Blaise because he hurt Black and/or Nott with a scrap of Parchment or something similarly benign.
“What happened?” Harry asked in concern, lasted he’d saw, Draco had stayed behind to talk to the man he hoped the blonde hadn’t done something to get himself in even more trouble.
"NO one neglects a member of the Black family." Sirius hissed lowly so as not to attract attention. After all he was still on the run, which was why he was still in disguise. His tone hinted that he was thinking about his discovery three days ago.
The blonde flipped golden curls over her shoulder shooting Draco an aggravated frown, “He can be a real piece of work right?”
“Why?” Draco demanded, glaring at him defiantly, though the hand on his throat was definitely making him nervous now.
A slow smirk spread across the boys’ lips, “Actually I didn’t know they were gone, you just told me. And seeing as I just saw the man who I presume to be your Godfather leave I doubt anyone will be in to check until tomorrow.” He chuckled stepping closer.
Draco rolled his eyes hearing his wand go off, “Let’s head to the Parlor. We should be leaving soon.”
“Ass,” Harry gasped but didn’t disagree. He felt too good to argue right now.
Blaise leaned back in his seat studying the group around him, “You’re not what I imagined you to be. I figured you all to be fools playing a petty game set to fail. Your friend can get off the floor now by the way.”
“Potter the Professors looking your way, better pay attention.”
Carina rolled her eyes, “They have, and no one’s ever realized what it was until they lost it though. At which point they question whether it was ever there at all.”
“We wanted to ask you over. Sirius has probably gone already so you don’t have him to worry after you. You should come over.”
“Yes,” Harry deadpanned in annoyance. He was really getting irritated with the interruptions if Draco didn’t get a move on Harry was going to take over.
With a wave of Remus’ wand the Blanket fell limp before folding itself neatly.
Harry shrugged looking resigned as the shorter of the two brunettes, who undoubtedly had to be Paul, bounced over, “So Har,” he leered, “who’s the eye candy?”
Leo froze as his own words caught up to him. His hand paused halfway to his mouth as if to cover it in horror at his thoughtless insults.
Harry- Leo Harry-James Potter
“Is that a threat?” Lyra asked quietly, glaring at the boy, or man. No one could call this man a boy. He may have only been fifteen, but the bloke was just as broad and chiseled as her cousin if not more so. He was tall at six foot and looked more dangerous than any man she’d ever met (and her Uncle had supposedly been to Azkaban… (Note to self: Ask about that!))
It was only after he’d left the room Pansy realized she’d been holding her breath. She’d found herself in quiet the mess, and it was all that
“Hmm,” Draco hummed slouching in his chair and propping his chin in his hand, drawling sarcastically “You’re so good with kids Uncle Sev, how is it you never had any of your own?”
“You sneaky little snake,” Leo chuckled wrapping his arms tighter around the blonde, “I should’ve known I was being manipulated. The Bath, the library, the Kitchens, the Rock by the Lake. How’d you know I was going to be there though?”
Sirius sighed and ruffled they're hair, obviously mollified by the reassurance.
A cruel smirk twisted the other boys’ features, “That’s right, you can’t hurt me, not if you don’t want Potter and his lot finding out your filthy little secret love.”
Orion nodded taking the seat between Draco and Seamus, while Mikhail put their trunks on the racks above them, before sitting between Ginny and Hermione. “Yes it was quiet startling when he burst into our Foyer flailing around about how a blonde menace named Malfoy was corrupting his little nephews’ innocence. I’d almost believed he was talking about a little boy until father made him explain.” She looked mildly amuse by her story, but Harry was blushing fiercely and Draco wished the floor would swallow him up. Harry’s friends were staring at them in an odd mix of horror and amusement. Ron looked a bit peaky actually. Hermione looked about ready to lecture them, as a mother would her children.
Vernon turned purple in his rage literally squeaking as he attempted to restrain himself. His hands twitched as if he wanted to wrap them around his Harry’s neck.
Tracy hugged him tightly as if she were holding onto her very life. She trembled lightly promising herself she would do anything she could to earn his trust. After all he held her very life in his hands now, and as a Slytherin she was going to do everything she could to make sure she didn’t give him a reason to crush it.
“Sod off Ian,” Leo huffed sulkily.
Leo looked up to see the boy leaning on the table next to a Seventh year boy who seemed to be dazed by Malfoy’s proximity, Malfoy was talking quietly to the boy a light smile tugging at the left corner of his mouth as if to smile. He was leaning over the boy in an almost intimate manner.
Draco blink in confusion, "What?"
Leo eyed up the cocky Blond curiously. Malfoy hadn't changed too much over the summer. He was still the same height making him shorter then Leo, he was still pale, the only noticeable difference was the obvious change in his hairstyle. It was elegantly messy.
Harry flushed, the warm feeling in his body increasing, “Draco,” He whined again.
“Draco Malfoy, I’m Harry’s boyfriend. And you are?” His smile was teasing he didn’t want them to feel uncomfortable around him. They were Harry’s friends after all, so they had to be good people… right?
Blaise and Adrian frowned glancing between the two curiously. Even the Slytherins around them seemed grudgingly interested now, though they were unable to grasp the meaning of their conversation.
Lyra walked up and sat on the stool waiting for McGonagall to place the hat on her head. She smirked at the nervously waiting first years she knew exactly where she was going.
“THAT’S IT!” Leo threw down his quill, ignoring the raised eyebrows he got from his group of friends at the table, and the hissed reprimand from Madam Pince. Carina, Millicent, Theo, Julian, Lyra, and Leo had been in the Library studying when Malfoy had been spotted trying to hide at his own table off in the corner. It had been obvious he’d been sitting there before they had been from the mountain of books he was using to help him hide. So of course, Carina started talking about how NICE he was.
Leo’s hands were everywhere! Draco groaned arching in to the raven above him when the boy squeezed his ass. He’d no idea it would be such a turn on.
Draco’s breath hitched, before stuttering out, as he unconsciously bared more of his neck for the other boy, “Yes.”
Twin- Lyra Amalthea Black (Carina's sister)
Draco would’ve laughed at the dumbfounded expression on the two boys faces if it wouldn’t ruin his plan. Instead he kept his expression neutral as if he were merely wishing them goodnight rather than analyzing their reaction. Oh those poor fools, they wouldn’t know what hit them. Draco and Mikhail hadn’t when Orion came into their lives. They’d had a tentative truce before Orion came along and tricked them into hanging out with her, before they knew it they’d actually become friends, they’d become invested in each other’s lives. If Draco had it his way the two boys would follow the same path, he kind of liked their sarcastic, broody personalities. More to that it would be very beneficial to have them fully on his side, with their knowledge of the other Slytherins they’d be the perfect allies. They’d make a good addition to the group, but it wasn’t just him they had to impress.
Harry frowned, “Lucius, your dad? Why don’t you…”
Harry frowned when he’d managed to look through the whole car and find nothing that look even remotely present like, “Granddad?”
“And you can cast it?” Leo directed the question to Daphne sharply, eyes taking on a more calculated gaze..
Julian shrugged indifferently returning to his magazine with a detached sort of interest as if he were merely reading a book.
“Sorry,” Daphne shook her head sheepishly, still eyeing the other girl crossly.
“Slytherin!”
"Dead,… Remember?" Remus felt the weight of his words hit him like the Hogwarts Express, he was shocked at his own revelation. Lettie was…dead? Why had he only now remembered her? Had there even been a funeral? He didn’t remember it.
Blaise let a slow smirk curl his lips as he leaned forward, “You’re destroying his reputation first.”
Harry and Mikhail startled when Ron nearly slammed his hands down on the table, “Wait, wait, are you talking about Viktor Krum? THE Viktor Krum?!”
"Its fine," Leo seemed to sense her unease and reached over to squeeze her hand comfortingly.
All and all things are crazy. Im so sorry i havent responded to your messages. Im back, i bought a New laptop and hopefully i'll have what was supposed to be the Christmas chapter up soon! Thank you all for being so patient, HAPPY NEW YEAR!
A flash of enticing curves and a deceptively thin waist flitted across the Italian teens memory, causing the teen to smirk openly as he speared a tomato and popped it into his mouth, well at the very least the trip was already looking to be worthwhile.
