The next morning he showed up at Potter’s flat in London. They quickly moved out back to the garden and Potter began to lay down the ground rules.
Eventually, Draco dragged himself home and rinsed off in the shower. He was already fast asleep by the time the clock struck ten.
Harry came with him to Japan not as his coach but as his friend. Still, that didn’t stop him from giving Draco pointers after every game. They would get dinner together and talk about each match or if Draco went out with the team, Harry would stop by his hotel room afterwards and they would talk late into the night.
The next couple of weeks carried on much in the same way. Harry and Draco worked out, analyzed old games, and took their meals together. The soreness faded as Draco’s stamina increased and he found it easier and easier to keep up. Harry was still well above him in terms of muscle mass but Draco was making progress. And the entire time he didn’t touch a single bottle. He didn’t really need to, since every night he would knock out as soon as he hit his mattress.
It was a good routine - comfortable, easy - and the semester passed by quickly. Draco was content at least for the moment.
The moment was bitter-sweet for Draco because it was his last game. Next year, Max Crevier, the team’s usual seeker, would be healed enough to take back his spot. Pansy said he was moping but Draco preferred to think of it as succumbing to ennui.
“That was amazing!” The boy yelled once he got close enough then immediately bent over to catch his breath. He was a year or two older; Draco wasn’t sure of his name though he remembered seeing him around.
Simon had been at l'Internat longer than any of the other boys and was only about a year older than Draco himself. He was constantly getting detentions and was one of Draco’s more enthusiastic tormentors.
With exams over, everyone was preparing for the break. It looked like it was going to be another long summer of studying and revisions for Draco. He didn’t know if Thomas would be coming back this year and Professor Dubois was spending the summer break in Serbia. He was starting research on his new book and had left Draco in charge of looking after some of the more mundane plants while he was away. Draco was on his way to the conservatory now, to do some pruning and watering when another student called out to him, wishing him a happy summer. Draco blinked, then a small smile spread across his face. That was new.
“You shouldn’t have gone for the feint,” Potter blurted out. Draco turned to face him again. “In your game with Montrose.”
After it was all over. Draco sat alone in the locker room. Birch came in. All of the Tornadoes had come to see the match.
Draco looked at the other boys, muggles. Did they really think Draco was the same as them? No matter how far Draco had fallen - his name, intelligence, and magical ability placed him heads and shoulders above these children. He had made it this far in life without any friends. He certainly wasn’t about to resort to allying himself with these plebeians and their dirty blood.
Boarding school? Draco shouldn’t have been surprised. He knew his independent study was only a temporary solution and he would need a formal education. Boarding school would take care of that and absolve his father of any other parenting responsibilities.
Draco didn’t know how to handle the situation so he left. He left Thomas standing there in the hallway crying. He was a terrible person.
They worked like that for a bit longer, Draco would ask Harry for directions and Harry would give a curt response.
Three house-elves appeared at her side. She handed Draco over, red-faced and still silently wailing, to the nearest one.
Draco flew across the empty quidditch pitch climbing higher and higher. A weight Draco hadn’t even realized he had been holding was lifted off his shoulders and he was suddenly struck with the notion that on a broom he could go anywhere, do anything. A whole world of possibilities stretched before him, and Draco felt free.
?” Simon looked into the box and Draco’s muscles tensed, the pressure was beginning to build behind his eyes as he fought back the tears.
He looked up at Draco for permission. Draco knew his own eyes were blown wide but he kept the rest of his face composed. Draco and Asim had never gone further than some heavy petting, and Draco wanted this. He unzipped his trousers and pulled down his pants giving Xavier full access.
to prepare for.” Pansy rolled her eyes but didn’t call Draco out on his bullshit. The truth was that Draco had already checked and all the seeker spots were filled for next year.
“Alright, point taken. I’ll talk to the professors tomorrow and see if any of them are feeling particularly generous.”
Draco felt a wave of emotions wash over him, happiness, sadness, grief, longing. Emotions made Draco feel vulnerable, and so most of the time he pushed them away. But this feeling was so strong he didn’t stand a chance against it. He had to leave,
“That’s very nice of you but I am not sure.” Draco moved to take another sip of his drink but Potter stopped him.
The summer flew by and before Draco knew it, it was time to say goodbye. Thomas’ mother had completed her research so he would not be returning for another summer, and he was never going to be a student. This time when Thomas left both boys cried.
“Monday I will ask him to go over some of my plays with me in the conference room after practice. Then I’ll have some kind of emergency and send you in to reschedule for me. You’ll have the room to yourselves.”
“Murphy let me in,” the tone was stern. Birch walked over and sat next to Draco. “The greatest match of your career and you show up drunk.”
Draco tried to take Finwick’s advice and put Potter out of his head, or at least quit keeping tabs on him which was unfortunate because not half an hour later Draco found himself running into the Boy-Who-Lived at the bar.
His teammates did their best to keep the action away from Draco so that he could focus on spotting the snitch, but already he had had to avoid two colliding players, a rogue bludger, and one very close call with a goal post. He loved every second of it.
Asim sighed heavily, “We’ve had this conversation before. How did you even get the rankings in the first place, they aren’t posted until the end of the semester?”
He showed up to breakfast with a smile on his face and a pep in his step that he hadn’t had the day before.
The summer of 1994 was Draco’s loneliest one yet. There were a couple students that stayed behind who included Draco in their group, but whenever he was with them he couldn’t help but feel like he was putting on a performance. These people weren’t his friends. They didn’t care about him, nor did he care about them.
The street was crowded with witches and wizards doing some last-minute school shopping. Draco breathed in deeply, he could feel the magic radiating through the air, this was where he belonged.
“I’m leaving,” Draco said. He was out of bed now and pulling on his clothes. “I can’t believe you would quit just like that. Honestly, who the
“I can imagine that quidditch must have been a nice distraction from such a tragic childhood. I mean, you must have been very lonely growing up - a wizard stuck among muggles.”
Once classes started up, it seemed his fears had been completely valid. Draco found the girls themselves easy enough to avoid, but he couldn’t escape the conversations. Girls quickly became the sole topic amongst his “friends”, and Draco found that his lack of interest in girls was just one more thing that made him different from the other boys.
Harry let him in without question and they played several rounds of exploding snap. Once it got late, Draco got up to leave.
“Well, who knows where I’ll be so far into the future. But I wish you luck in your match.” Blaise turned back to the bar.
The rest of 1995 wasn’t half bad. Pansy had come out in full support of Draco and Asim’s relationship, going so far as to say that she was proud Draco was finally spreading his wings. Even with Professor Dubois gone, Draco still found Herbology to be his favourite class. For once in his life, he was happy. He was doing well in school, he was popular, he had a best friend, and a boyfriend. What else could he ask for?
“Narcissa!” Lucius Malfoy’s voice echoed through the Manor as he apparated straight into the entrance hall. “Where is my wife,” he snapped at the house-elf who had appeared to greet her master.
As the year progressed so did Draco’s rank. He began to draw the attention of the other boys in the class as a real threat. By November he had cracked the top ten and by May he was fourth in the class. It wasn’t number one, but it was a start, and Draco was determined to reach the top by the end of third year.
The stadium the had been built for the final was larger than any Draco had ever seen. He wasn’t sure how they had managed to fill it but fill it they had. Everyone was there to see Krum pull off another win for Russia. Draco took a deep breath and tuned out the crowd. It wouldn’t do to get nervous now.
From that point on, they started interacting with each other during practices and Draco slowly improved. He was starting to adjust to the new team and was eager to test out his skill in a real game.
The next day Thomas did in fact forgive Draco, he was ecstatic that Draco still wanted to be his friend and didn’t hate him for being a squib. Draco was discussed at their society that was how Thomas had to navigate the world now and discussed at himself for playing into that narrative.
It was a hasty clash of teeth and tongues and spit. That ended with Draco pinned against the wall and Xavier sliding his thigh between Draco’s legs.
Draco made his way back to the party and his team and drank until he ended up puking in the bathroom.
Beauxbâtons also got its fair share of talk. The has-been team was a threat once more and they had a real shot at taking home the gold.
They tidied up a little before getting ready for bed, throwing out several liquor bottles of various degrees of full. After taking a shower, Draco crawled into bed next to Pansy and prepared himself for a restless night of sleep, the first of what he was sure would be many.
- a free, confidential, 24/7, 365-day-a-year treatment referral and information service (in English and Spanish) for individuals and families facing mental and/or substance use disorders
Draco performed well in his matches. There were a few tight games, but if he was being honest no one came close to beating him - certainly not Fisher. Draco won the cup easily and got invited to join Great Britain's team for the upcoming European Cup. He accepted, of course, but it left a bitter taste in his mouth.
Why would the ref invoke the advantage rule now? And then he saw it hovering right next to him was a small golden ball. Draco reached out to grab it and the whistle blew.
The whistle blew and a timeout was called. A medi-witch came out to check on him. Draco winced as she popped his dislocated shoulder back into place and cast a few healing spells. Coach Kern came up beside them.
As Draco made his way down to the ground, several of his teammates offered their congratulations but Draco was only thinking of one person. Once he landed, he saw the mop of dark black hair barreling towards him and he took off in a sprint.
Draco smiled and put the letter away to respond to later. The next day he got three more offers for various teams and by the end of the week, he had gathered a respectable half dozen from teams all over the world.
Draco showed up one morning to find Harry out back with a smirk on his face, well as much of a smirk as the golden boy could muster.
The next day at lunch Pansy slid into the spot next to Draco like it was a completely normal thing to do.
Fuck, Harry was right. His wand was probably sitting under the couch in the living room. Draco would retrieve it in the morning; there were much more important matters at hand. “I can manage a simple wandless vanishing charm, I assure you. Especially when I am feeling particularly motivated.”
With his signing bonus, Draco had all his moving expenses covered along with first month's rent on a nice apartment plus enough to furnish it and even then there was enough left over for an entirely new wardrobe.
They were neck and neck now and Draco had the snitch in his sight. He clenched his jaw, willing his broom to go faster, but he knew he wasn’t going to make it. Draco veered to the side throwing his weight into the other player and knocking them both off course.
It was a while before Draco got another chance at the snitch. He was hovering near the goalposts when he saw it. Unfortunately, two beaters zeroed in on him at the exact same time. They slammed into Draco from both sides pushing him towards the stands. He managed to stay on course bringing them closer and closer to the snitch but suddenly Draco’s broom went into a tailspin. He fought for control as the ground grew closer though he kept his eyes on the glint of gold. He could see the path to victory in his head, all he had to do was execute it. He willed himself to move but he couldn’t do it, his body wasn’t strong enough. Instead, he ended up tumbling to the ground in an inelegant heap. At the last second, he managed to tuck into a roll to keep himself from getting a mouthful of dirt. Draco popped back up immediately. He heard the sound of a whistle and the call of “Play on!”
Euthymia feigned innocence as Draco entered the shop alone later that week. She began work on his nape, humming to herself.
Of course I'm over the moon for you, darling. In fact, you're my moon and stars. (And I've always been adorable, ta for finally noticing, yeah?) We can keep this to ourselves (and your mother) as long as you want or need to. I'm yours and I'm not going anywhere. At least nowhere without you.
“And a piece of advice. If you ever need a bit of space, pretend to go out for a smoke. It’s worked for me since I was 16.” He gave him a wink and a nudge in the arm with his elbow before he walked off. “See you around, cousin,” he called, before disappearing through the Floo the same way he’d arrived.
Harry sighed, turning the burner off. Gods, if only Draco could see him now. He’d give him some shit about how he was a baby, crying over breakfast,
It wasn't supposed to happen, so don't you dare feel like you somehow deserve this. You aren't a monster, either.
“Well, I mean… My magic seems like it’s stayed the same, really. If I’m emotional, yeah, it’s stronger, but I’m still pants at a few charms, and potions still isn’t my best. I didn’t think I had anymore powerful magic than the next guy.”
He blushed and took another few bites of his crêpe tower. Truly, this was more dessert than breakfast or lunch, but he didn't care. It was sent from heaven itself, of that he was certain. And after the night he'd had, he felt maybe this wasn't the worst way to recover.
“What exactly does low-rise mean?” Draco tried to look between the two of them, frowning as he looked around. What sorts of shoes were these? Bas nudged his ankle with his own foot.
Draco gave the letter one more glance over, tucking it close as he breathed. Just… Sunday dinner with the family he never knew he had. Easy enough. He ascended the steps and knocked on the door, letter carefully tucked away. It only took a moment for the door to open. "Draco, good to see you again. Come in, dear."
“Oh, should we talk about the time then that you got on Dean because he wasn’t folding his clothes right?” Ron’s ears went bright red as his wife and best friend laughed at him before he chuckled alone.
"She only looks for those with… power and influence in high places." Remy and Sapphire both hummed and shared a Look.
“Harry, dear. Right on time.” Narcissa was there to receive him, smiling at him, though he saw the brittle heartbreak beneath it. “I suspect, since Draco isn’t at your side, that you didn’t have much luck in finding him?”
down Celesti Alley over the weekend, the results of which are included at the end of the letter. I had quite a bit of fun, but it would’ve been
Bloody well hoping your answer will be yes… I’m very much focused on becoming a Potter-Malfoy, you know. Now, I’m not proposing we become bonded and married by letter, or that we do it immediately. Your mum said it’s important that the one doing the courting “make their intentions clear to the other party”. I think I’ve made my intentions with you very clear, Draco my love.
“My love, there was no protection in her blood, because she had no magic. Your parents’ sacrifice protected you from being killed that night, because their love and magic protected you in that specific moment. There was so much untethered, powerful magic in the air, with the intent of protecting you, that you survived.”
"Probably because of the Boy Who Lived Twice reputation, ta very much. Sometimes, catching normal criminals is nice, too. Keeps things interesting," he said, looking over the file a bit closer. "Have you ever heard of the Crowlins? They aren't a Sacred 28 family, but are they old money?"
Harry paused, looking at her through the mirror. "Ah, what do you mean? What potion?" Potions ran in his family, besides his mum?
With Harry in the air and the dragon grounded, he knew it would be a short but hard fight. The dragon kept shuffling away, tossing his great head back and forth to throw Harry off. He even let out a few bursts of flame as Harry leapt from his Firebolt and onto the base of the dragon’s neck.
You’re too thin by half.” He grinned at her sheepishly and adjusted his glasses. Everyone was always trying to feed him, jeez.
“You have a family house, don’t you? The Blacks have the Ancestral home, the Malfoys have the Manor… What have the Potters got?”
How about we agree to spoil each other? I know you, you’ll argue against everything I try to do for you, and I’m never opposed to being treated the way I ought to be. We’ll take care of each other, Harry. I promise.
One more friend to ask after, the illustrious bachelor Blaise Zabini, who coincidentally didn't live too far from Grimmauld. Harry apparated to the closest Apparition spot to Blaise's muggle flat and walked the rest of the way. It was a lovely Sunday morning, apart from the grey clouds that suggested an afternoon drizzle.
“Certainly not,” Draco scoffed, shaking his head slightly. “With my awful luck, I'd be stuck with something like ‘Dead Draco’ for eternity.” Merlin, that would get old fast. His statement drew an even bigger laugh from the Baron, who hadn’t been nearly this friendly with him while he was living.
“You’re not the first person to tell me that… but you might’ve said it the nicest.” He sighed and pressed a gentle kiss to the top of her head. “So… you know he’s been bitten and turned and ran away.”
“Well. I think we ought to find it, don’t you?” She tied his hair after combing the potion through it and smiled at him, putting her hands on his shoulders. “Perfect. Now come, dear, “I believe I’ve found the perfect room for Draco, when he comes home.”
She looked over at him and smiled. “Metro. It’s very close to Bas’ work, and saves us lots of walking time.”
Running after Snape had done him no good. Even Sectumsempra hadn't taken him down, and Snape then revealed that he had invented the spell. Snape was the half-blood Prince, and he'd set fire to Hagrid's hut for good measure as he fled the grounds.
“Thank you, Poppy… and please, keep this to yourself for the time being,” Albus said quietly, dismissing the distraught medi-witch. She descended the spiraling stone staircase and Minerva turned to face the Headmaster.
“Oh.” Right, then. He was on holiday in Paris. New experiences. He followed her down the street, and down the steps under the lovely Art Deco Metropolitan sign. She bought a booklet of 10 tickets for him and handed them over, taking out her own card.
Luckily (or unluckily), both men greeted him with a smile and a warm handshake. They were kind, courteous, and a decade older than him, but Draco decided that, for the moment at least, Gabriel and his husband were his favorite cousins. "You… took your husband's name?" They could do that? He wasn't surprised this family didn't disapprove of the fact he had a husband, but the fact he gave up his name…
“I got his next letter just before your Floo call came through.” He half stood up, to take the letter from his back pocket. He handed it to her, across the table. “He’s got an off-the-shelf Wolfsbane potion for his first full.”
Narcissa leaned back in her chair. “But do you think he would want to teach?” She had him there. Draco never seemed to be overly fond, whenever they had to work with kids for any reason. Harry hesitated before sighing.
“Oh, don’t worry, I lost plenty of weight afterwards. I dropped about nine stones of deadbeat weight, after I found out I was pregnant.”
family. He was… he was a bloody French Weasley, or at least well on his way to becoming one. “Where… will Sunday dinner take place?”
Harry sighed and put his glasses back on. He looked up at Draco, seeing how focused he was on the file. "Okay. Six it is. You'll be ready?"
They must've come to take his body, they must've. He wasn't buried on Hogwarts grounds, he could feel it. He had a hunch he was buried far, far away. Good. Maybe his parents had finally left.
He took a deep breath and looked over the letter again. That had been too close. But it seemed like Valerie didn’t catch on to Harry mentioning his condition. He laid on his bed, on his back, the letter pressed to his chest.
“He does, doesn’t he… I really need to find him. I need to make sure he doesn’t do something drastic and out of character.” Harry set down his teacup, stood up, and paused. “...it’s too early to go around and ask about him, isn’t it?” Neither Pansy nor Blaise would be awake. The pair of them liked their lie-ins, and it was only chance that Narcissa was awake and ready to have company.
But Ron knew what it was like to be in love. Hell, nearly two years ago Harry had been Ron's best man when he and Hermione had gotten married. Harry would probably get a couple days of shit from him, ‘the ferret? Really, the ferret? I knew you were bent, but bent for Malfoy is another thing entirely.’ Then Ron would give it up ‘I’ve been rooting for you the whole time. You knew I was messing, right?’ And if Ron had figured out that Draco had been turned during the raid… there might not be much teasing at all.
He took a few hesitant steps forward before settling in on his bed. He could already catch whiffs of the shirt… He couldn't help himself. In all of a moment, he was naked and the door was locked, wards up to prevent anyone hearing him. He carefully lifted the soft fabric up to his face and breathed in.
“I am saying he molded you into the perfect soldier, who found solace and wonder in the magical world and would give up his life for it. You forget that I saw you that night… no seventeen year old looked like you did. You walked to your own death and by the magic of luck alone were able to come back.”
Ah, much better. It's not so much my full name… it's you saying it. I love your voice, and thought it was obvious. How many times did I bait you into going on a rant or ramble in our shared office? I quite like hearing you talk, even if you're angry.
"Oh. I like to experiment with potions in my free time, or read up on magical theory. My friends since childhood are Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini. You've heard of Starling Zabini? Her son."
"He has a sweet tooth, this one," Remy laughed, patting Draco on the back. "But good taste. I will find you some Loire Valley sparkling wine soon, you will appreciate it better than my brother-in-law," he joked.
A dark blush crept over his face and neck and he nodded, thinking of his father and godfather's blatant disregard for the Ministry rules. "Yes, ma'am. To be fair, I'm also not doing this at 14." That would've been impossible, with everything going on at the time.
“Alright, fine,” he sighed. He would need to pick up some more his own tone, though, while they were out. He was certain that her makeup wouldn’t match his skin tone. He might be able to steal a lipstick or two, though.
‘Harry?’ The voice was very familiar, but he wasn’t wearing his glasses and so everything was hazy. ‘You’re alright, just stay still, I’ll get your glasses.’ He still couldn’t quite identify the voice, but he just automatically trusted it. ‘I’m going to put them on you now.’
clothes. You look good, I’d dare say attractive if it weren’t for the glasses and the hair.’ Well, Draco did warn him she would have
As the court proceedings started, Harry was once again happy he’d decided that politics weren’t for him, because this was
‘No, no, like I said, it’s fine. I can be professional, please don’t ship me off to Gaulding or something.’
He’d gone to buy himself some new sneakers late that Saturday morning, his old ones had practically been falling apart at the seams to the point where not even magic could save them. So he’d caved and went to exchange some of his Wizarding money for pounds, and he’d headed into Muggle London. It took way longer than Harry would have liked it too, but shopping was a hassle in general. It was the late afternoon by the time he made it back to Grimmauld place.
‘I was thinking that maybe I’d want to get something for my parents, you know. I recently learned that Wizarding tattoos can move, how cool is that?’ Harry grinned.
‘He looks exhausted.’ Hermione said with a mild reproachful look at Ron. ‘It must be hard on him and his mother with his father in Azkaban.’ Ron rolled his eyes.
They didn’t see Draco’s mother and that was okay. Harry was actually kind of happy about that. He felt pretty certain that Draco had thought this through to the point where his mother wouldn’t be a problem, but it was still intimidating to think about Narcissa Malfoy being his boyfriend’s mother.
‘Frame him? Because they want him out of the way.’ Harry threw his hands up in frustration. He was going to
‘What Lucius Malfoy did is on him, not on his wife or his son. I do not believe it is right to punish someone for the sins of their father, do you?’ Harry fired back. The wizard in question stayed silent. ‘I do actually have a reason to say the things I am saying. When Hermione, Ron and I were caught by Death Eaters and brought to Malfoy Manor, Hermione used a spell on my face to try and make me unrecognizable. So, the Death Eaters brought in Malfoy to confirm whether it was me, or not. I
A tawny owl came fluttering into the room right before Draco who was carrying two mugs. The owl landed on his desk, hooting softly. Draco set one of the mugs on Harry’s desk and he caught a whiff of tea.
‘So you want to go from Auror partners to professors?’ Draco asked, but he was smiling. Not smirking, or sneering, honestly smiling. Harry shrugged.
‘- you have actual experience with Dark Wizards, you know how they work, how they think. I say it’s an advantage.’ He was dealing with a Slytherin, he should play him like a Slytherin. ‘Also, it’s a very respectable job. It’d be good for your reputation.’
First, Harry secured the note he’d written to the owl’s leg and he let Malfoy tell the owl where to go. Someone named Missy Fletcher, who was apparently the witch who’d done Draco’s tattoo. Then as the owl smoothly took off out of the room, he went and unwrapped the little mystery tissue present. It was one of the chocolate chip cookies from the cafeteria.
‘Yes, it is most certainly stupid, among other things.’ Malfoy said. ‘It’s okay though, I’m going to see her at dinner. I think she has prepared something special.’ He titled his head, this hair was falling out of its carefully constructed style. Normally he would already have redone it with a spell by now, but maybe the beer had actually loosened him up a little. ‘She was very specific in what time I needed to be home.’ Harry should tell him about his hair, he couldn’t go back to his mother like this. Harry could just push the rebelling strands back into place… well, the beer was surely making
‘That is not looking good. I thinks Master Harry’s friend is hurt.’ Kreacher said, actually showing an emotion. ‘Master Harry’s friend must not bleed on the upholstery.’ Ah, that’s why. ‘Shall Kreacher heal Master Harry’s friend?’ He should probably introduce them, maybe Kreacher would be nicer to a Malfoy.
‘I don’t know, Robards is in there. But he was breathing the whole time.’ He immediately tried to reassure her. She got that determined glint in her eye and suddenly Harry felt a little bad for the Mediwitch behind the counter. Scary as she might be, there was nothing scarier than Hermione Granger on a mission.
‘I’ll show you mine if you show me yours.’ Now that seemed to work better. There was a familiar spark of interest in the pair of grey eyes. A slow smile spread over Draco’s face.
‘Yes, Minister.’ Malfoy said, making a good effort not to sound as snooty as he normally did when people didn’t treat him like he felt like he should be treated.
and Weasley.’ Malfoy sounded bitter. Harry wanted to say he was overreacting, but to be fair, Robards still barely looked at Malfoy. Any praise for their pair was usually aimed at Harry, no matter how many times he redirected the praise to Malfoy, it wasn’t the same.
It had started with Mrs Malfoy and how he wouldn’t have been able to defeat Voldemort in the end if she hadn’t lied and told Voldemort Harry was dead that day in the forest. That’s what started his thoughts about the Malfoys. From Mrs Malfoy, he’d started thinking about Malfoy (Draco, that was) and his terrified face up in the tower the night that Dumbledore died.
‘Right sure, sorry.’ Harry held up his hands in surrender, turning back to his paperwork. He tapped his pen against his lips for a second, pondering over the next part. Ever since he’d left Hogwarts he’d gone back to using ballpoint pens. There was a lot he loved about the Wizarding World, but their strange obsession with using quills and parchment was not one of them. So instead, Harry used his pens and a regular notebook. Draco had looked at him funnily at first, but now he just shrugged it off.
Some good news, maybe this was exactly what he needed. Maybe this would help him get out of his slump. They sat there for a while, just smiling at each other and Harry felt calmer than he had since Draco left.
‘I still don’t get it.’ Ron broke the moment and Ginny dropped her head back with a groan. ‘You dated my sister and now you want to date
‘You know, Potter, I never really saw the “could have been a Slytherin” thing before, but I see it now.’ Harry was pretty sure that was supposed to be some kind of insult, but he meant what he said, so he held his ground. ‘No one will want to work with him, have you thought about that?’ Harry didn’t like how they were talking about Malfoy like he wasn’t there.
‘I don’t know, I’m having a great time.’ They were saying he was right and everything. Malfoy rolled his eyes, then crossed his arms and shifted away from Harry.
‘We are now.’ There was an amused tilt to the faux-stern twist of Draco’s mouth. He sighed dramatically.
They ordered her to pay a large sum towards the rebuild of Hogwarts and she was also placed under house arrest. She would be confined to the Manor for a year and if after that, she had caused no problems they’d take her off house arrest. If she ever caused trouble again though, the Ministry reserved the right to send her to Azkaban for even minor infractions of the law. She would have to live on the straight and narrow, or go to jail.
‘Now that it’s been confirmed that they want us to dress respectably while we’re on the job, you really need to let me take you to go buy some decent clothes.’ Malfoy said as Ron weaved between the last few people between him and the table.
That Sunday, Harry went and got the three new tattoos he’d been talking about. Missy had been delighted to welcome him back and she didn’t have any other appointments that day. Draco came with him, just like old times. It was something familiar and the way Draco smiled at him made Harry’s stomach flutter.
He threw himself into work with even more vigour than before. Sometimes he forgot to eat, other times he forgot to sleep, but that didn’t matter because Dra-
‘Well, he never said this outright but I think he felt like he made his choice during the first war. I don’t think he gave himself a second chance.’ Not like Draco did. ‘At the end, I don’t think my father believed the Dark Lord would win, but he did, of course, believe in what the Dark Lord was preaching.’
‘That sounds dangerous. How are you going to obscure your identity? What if they make you take Veritaserum to prove you’re not a spy? They expect you to go in alone?’ Harry asked and some of the excitement disappeared from Draco’s face. That hurt a little, Harry never wanted to do that. Draco looked excited so rarely.
‘I don’t ever really do this so you better enjoy it, but I wanted to say I’m sorry and thank you.’ She did sound a little bit like it pained her to get the words out.
Their graduating class was dubbed the Post War 7. They were the largest graduating Auror class since the First War. It consisted of Harry, Ron and Malfoy and:
put me in Slytherin was because I asked it not to, because I’d been told that Slytherin is where the evil people went.’ This caused another round of murmurs. ‘This prejudice against Slytherin, however, causes the other houses to treat them with caution. Their pride makes them angry that they are treated as such, therefor they act out against the other houses, to them this confirms Slytherin’s reputation and so it goes and goes and it creates this rift that drives young witches and wizards right into the hands of someone like Voldemort who promised to get them the respect they didn’t get elsewhere.’
‘Here’s what we’ll do.’ Hermione said after a few minutes. ‘You’re coming to dinner here for at least four days a week. You can cook two and I can cook two. Ron is going to be checking in on you at work as much as he can around lunch time and you are going to move back to Grimmauld place.’ She held up her had before he could argue. ‘I know you don’t want to, but Kreacher still lives there and he can make sure you have food. Just for a little while, Harry.’
The first big case the Aurors caught, they invited Harry to sit in on the briefing. Draco was pointedly
‘Like you?’ A voice near the corner sneered. Another one of the possible recruits. Harry didn’t know his name. Malfoy ignored him.
‘Yes, it would definitely have been interesting.’ She smiled at him and patted Malfoy on the shoulder.
‘What do you think Malfoy got on his NEWTs?’ Neville asked, his voice was carefully blank like he never used to be able to before the war. His eyes were aimed at Malfoy, who was still standing with his back against the wall, but he’d been joined by Zabini and they seemed to be quietly arguing about something.
‘Seems like.’ Draco finally grinned. ‘We should probably head to the Great Hall, it’s about time for supper.’ Harry just stepped closer and put his hand over the lighting tattoo.
‘How do you do that? How are you just okay again?’ Harry flinched at the desperation in his own voice.
It was amazing. The image was basically just the solid black silhouettes of a stag and a doe. They were running, looking free and happy and wild and Harry loved it. There was a joy to the way they moved that made him feel a little chocked up. He looked up at Missy.
Footsteps behind him had him snap out of it. His hand went for his wand without even thinking about it. He caught himself just before he threw a hex over his shoulder. He forced himself to breathe. The person behind him cleared their throat.
‘One of the first things I learned when I entered the wizarding world, was that Slytherin was the bad house. That you didn’t want to go there, that Slytherins were evil. I don’t think I’ve ever told anyone this before, but the Sorting Hat hesitated between putting me in Gryffindor or Slytherin, I am fairly certain the only reason it
They walked straight to the Ministry, pretending like there was nothing wrong the whole time, like they weren’t being chased by Aurors and to be fair. It worked. They actually passed two people that Harry was pretty sure were Aurors at one point, but neither of them reacted and they passed by them with ease. They arrived back at the Auror offices with fifteen minutes to spare and Harry was actually kind of proud of them.
Draco, but Harry just stared back defiantly. Robards didn’t comment as he started the briefing. Harry threw Draco a self-satisfied smirk, he rolled his eyes.
‘Fine, but I do not want to go to a pub. The floors are always sticky and these shoes were expensive.’
When he came home and stepped inside he could immediately feel he wasn’t alone. The house shouldn’t have let anyone in but Harry and Kreacher wouldn’t have let anyone else in either, right? No one except-
‘Get the Minister here.’ Oh great. Malfoy took a few tentative steps closer to Harry, his eyes still on Robards.
.’ Malfoy said accusingly. Harry just rolled his eyes and watched as Ron tried to carry four beers without spilling anything.
‘Well, why a snake? You were a Gryffindor, right?’ The blue lining of her robes was distinctly Ravenclaw, but the way she asked the question reminded him a lot of Hermione when they were younger. The near annoyance with herself because she didn’t understand something.
Harry spend the rest of that day sitting in their office, alone, staring at the wall trying to make sure he didn’t run out the door to go find Draco. He tried to do paperwork. He tried to make himself have lunch, but the pit in his stomach just wouldn’t go away.
at Amelia and she’s way pretty.’ She motioned vaguely at him. ‘Also, all of the stuff you just mentioned? How he does your paperwork for you when you have a headache and how he doesn’t snap at you for being a fidgety little shite, I think he does.’
In the courses that Malfoy struggled, Harry excelled and the other way around. They were strangely good together and Harry would not say it out loud, but they were kind of
‘You’re doing it again.’ Malfoy said as he handed over his parchment and snatched Harry’s from his hand. ‘That thing where you pretend we’re friends and we didn’t actively try to kill each other.’
Ron was… Ron. He was trying to protect Harry, but he’d never been particularly good at putting himself in other people’s shoes.
get it, because if you want to talk about debt, I owe you for trying to kill you in our sixth year.’ Malfoy rolled his eyes.
‘Just- well, can you explain what you meant by “not blonde enough”?’ Harry wasn’t sure he even wanted to know the answer, but it would only get stuck in his head so he’d asked anyways.
‘Yeah okay.’ He said weakly. He cleared his throat. ‘There was another thing you guys wanted to talk about?’
‘I want to get a tattoo.’ Draco looked up at him from where he was sitting at his own desk. He raised a single eyebrow.
‘Mate, if there’s anyone they can’t deny, it’s you. Harry bloody Potter, saviour of the wizarding world.’ Ron said it with enough humour that it didn’t make Harry’s skin crawl like it usually did when people called him that. He wanted to be just Harry so badly. ‘If they’re going to deny anyone it’s going to be Malfoy.’ Ron said, his face twisting into a sneer. ‘Pompous prick.’
‘Ah yes, perhaps Kreacher should have mentioned that.’ The House Elf said, not sounding all that apologetic at all. Harry rolled his eyes.
de-curse this mysterious Death Eater safe house. I want your reports done by Monday and I’m sending someone by here tomorrow morning to check if you finished the house.’ Before they could respond he marched off.
‘If you’re going to go off and be a hero, you should give me a hug first.’ He said, trying to sound casual. ‘It’s tradition.’ Draco raised an eyebrow, but it wasn’t nearly as sassy as it usually was.
‘I remember why I know this town.’ His hands suddenly darted over the map, he traced along a sideroad. His fingers hesitating over what looked to be an empty plot of land. ‘There.’
.’ Harry sighed. ‘This is not what we’re here to discuss today.’ He’d gotten side-tracked. ‘My point here is, Draco Malfoy and I have hurt each other plenty of times. We’ve been on opposite sides pretty much since the start and yet, I do not believe he is evil. I do not believe he is a danger to anyone. I think he learned his lesson a while ago and I don’t believe he should be punished for the things he did after he was a
‘I’ll start on the prep.’ Amelia said, but Harry was unable to take his eyes off Draco as he studied the tattoo. There was something so soft and wistful in his face, something he didn’t think he’d ever seen on him before. Something longing. Oh.
‘Yes, that would make me feel better. Thank you Draco.’ He nodded slowly. His smile was still a little tight, but the look in his eyes was genuine.
It was pretty good, Harry was of the humble opinion. Sure, if anyone looked too closely, they’d still see his eyes, which were immensely recognizable.
‘Oh.’ Harry said. ‘Can you undo the restraints please? I won’t try to punch you, I promise.’ Draco hit whatever was binding Harry with a
There was something calming about the process of getting them. The thought that he put in it, the focus it asked of him. The making of a serious decision that
‘Ah, nightmares.’ It wasn’t really a question, but Harry nodded anyways. ‘What do you take?’ He asked.
‘Me neither.’ Harry admitted. ‘Also, we should probably have an actual proper, no shouting, no kissing conversation about our bloody job, but for now, can we just… not?’
there was that day they’d gotten drunk together. At first, Harry had been really good at pretending he didn’t remember because he’d been Embarrassed about it, but now, he remembered the way Draco had looked at him when he didn’t have his normal reservations.
‘Do you want to work on your rapport here? We could work together, it’d be quicker that way.’ Harry offered. He wasn’t about to let this tension stay in Draco’s spine. That wouldn’t do. Draco looked a little surprised at the offer, but quickly smoothed out his face.
. You can… pay me back for keeping you out of Azkaban by never using the M-word to describe Muggleborns again. You can pay me back for your mother and friends by never making fun of Ron’s family for being poor again. And you can pay me back for the Auror stuff by- fuck it I don’t know- by paying me one Galleon.’ Malfoy narrowed his eyes at Harry. ‘Would that satisfy your hurt pride?’
‘What a surprise.’ Draco drawled, pushing the Butterbeer into Harry’s hand and flopping down on the couch. Harry didn’t let his snarky attitude deter him. He hopped off the couch and pulled his shirt up, twisting so that Draco could see his lower back.
‘So you’ll speak for me and my mother, but not my father?’ His voice was soft, like he was making sure not to be overheard. Harry looked at him over his shoulder. He’d looked older before, but now he just looked really young and a little nauseous.
Harry closed his mouth with an audible click. He suddenly felt underdressed in his jeans and hoodie.
Their latest case however dealt with a small, but nasty group of wizards who had been attacking Muggleborns. They were the vicious sort and so when Harry and Draco ended up being surprised by them and then cornered, things got dicey.
He had taken most of the fancy stuff off before they came out to the pub (unlike Gaulding who was still strutting around in his full outfit). He didn’t want to spill beer on them, so he’d taken the robe and the waistcoat off. The grey shirt would soon be too warm, but he’d cross that bridge once he got there.
still stupid.’ The smirk on Malfoy’s face was like they were back in Hogwarts all over again, just without that edge that made it feel like he was trying to insult him.
‘You were not gone that long.’ Harry protested without much vigour, inhaling the warm, comforting scent of the tea. ‘Thanks.’
‘Harry, mate, you know I love you, but your clothes aren’t exactly professional.’ Harry let his mouth drop open.
With the shortened training programme, they’d introduced the term Junior Auror. It meant that they had technically graduated, but that they still had to get more practical experience, which Harry found  a little silly for the ones that had fought in the battle of Hogwarts, but he’d take it.
The familiar sickening feeling of being squeezed and then expanding again wasn’t enough to take away the pure dread in the pit of his stomach. They popped back into existence outside of a warehouse. Harry drew his wand as they approached slowly at first, when they started hearing the sounds of spells smacking into the inside of the warehouse, they picked up the pace.
Malfoy made quick work of his Glamours and he refused to tell Harry what exactly he’d done, so Harry was pretty sure he looked ridiculous.
. All wiry muscle overlaid with porcelain skin. It was rude. ‘I think I still have some clothes here, I’ll get you something and no,’ Harry said before he could open his mouth. ‘you are not allowed to complain. That shirt is ruined and you know it. Not even the best of spells will be able to deal with all that blood and a hole that size.’
Harry was out of his bed before he even realized what he was doing. There were no coordinates, no nothing, just a message. A curtesy call, if nothing else. But he was awake now and there was no way he was going back to sleep. Where would they take him? Would he be allowed straight home? Or would they take him to the Ministry?
Together they formed the first Post Second War graduating class. They were all given the title of Junior Auror and the Head Auror, Robards, would decide when they would be promoted to fully-fledged Aurors.
Their first day had them matched up in pairs of two. The immediate problem was, of course, that there was an uneven number of them. Now Harry, with his big mouth, had said that he’d work with Malfoy if no one else wanted to and
‘I don’t like seeing you get hurt either. I think that’s kind of a given at this point.’ Harry said and Draco sighed before turning back around.
‘Someone needs to contact Hermione and- does Amelia have a significant other? Family?’ He suddenly found himself nearly desperate to do
Over his heart, there was lighting. Proper lightning, coming from a dark stormy cloud. It forked out and Harry could almost hear the crackle of it, that’s how real it looked. Draco had lightning tattooed over his heart. He blinked a few times before looking up. Draco had smoothed out his face.
‘Potter-‘ Robards said in that warning tone that always made Harry feel like shrinking in on himself.
‘This way would lead her into a residential area.’ Draco mused. ‘But someone is more likely to find her there.’
‘I want to get a tattoo from the same person you got yours.’ Harry elaborated and Draco sighed. He put his quill in the holder and looked at Harry properly.
‘You’re welcome.’ Draco said setting his own mug down before sticking his hand in the pocket of his red Auror jacket and producing something wrapped in a tissue which he came to drop on Harry’s desk as well. He didn’t wear his jacket often, but they’d been out in the field this morning for official business, so both of them were wearing their official outfits. ‘Eat that.’ He pointed at the little mystery package.
‘We got ambushed.’ Amelia snarled. She was bleeding from a cut along her hairline and she had her free hand resting against her ribs. ‘I don’t know what they hit Ron with, but I put him under a stasis spell. I couldn’t Apparate us out of here and we’re pinned down.’
The Hit Wizards were out searching for the murderous lunatic and Harry couldn’t even make his feet move. Just- all of this destruction and why? What for? He must have looked upset because Blueroot stopped next to him from where he’d been heading into the house and looked at Harry with an uncomfortable expression.
‘I suppose that’s to be expected seeing as he didn’t come home last night.’ She tilted her head to the side. ‘Are you wearing Draco’s clothes?’ Harry frowned and looked down at himself.
He didn’t seem bothered by that. He just stood there looking all proper in his expensive robes with his shiny hair and perfectly blank expression. Harry was impressed by his ability to appear unbothered. He’d probably been prepared for this.
‘That’s in the past, we were young and stupid.’ Harry tried to focus on Malfoy’s NEWT results, but he got distracted.
Draco seemed to have accepted early on that this was what their lives would be for the foreseeable future. He was also better at research than Harry was. At least, he had more
‘Well, go on then Malfoy.’ He said impatiently when Malfoy kept staring at the floor. Those cool, grey eyes turned to him, disbelieve written all over his face.
‘You’re hurt.’ Harry said the second they landed, his hands already reaching for Draco. Apparating while hurt was always a bad idea, but he hadn’t had much of a choice. Without even thinking, Harry had brought them to Gimmauld Place. ‘Welcome to number 12 Grimmauld Place.’ Harry said, he needed to let Draco in on the secret or the Fidelius would keep them out.
‘Let me rephrase: Has he brought out the “blood traitor” thing or your family’s financial situation recently?’ Ron seemed to think about that for a second, probably scouring his recent memory to find an instance. He blinked a few times.
‘Here.’ He handed the one glass to Draco while he took the other for himself. Harry wasn’t much of a drinker, he’d have the occasional beer, but the Firewhisky had been standing around in his kitchen for a while. It had been a gift from George for completing his Auror training, so it had been there for like, nine months. ‘Cheers.’
‘Is it a secret?’ He asked, because it seemed weird. If Harry had a masterpiece like that on his back, he’d want to tell everyone about it.
had been wiped away by this undercover operation. He felt off balance and uncertain. And the worst part was that it only seemed to get
‘Of course not.’ Malfoy said with an eyeroll. ‘Just a small dash of a Calming Draught to counteract all of the horrible coffee you drank.’ Harry wanted to ask how he even knew Harry had drank all of that coffee, he hadn’t even been there, but Malfoy was already moving on. ‘I don’t think you missed much, this seemed like things you knew already. Except for the part where they said to strike whenever given the opportunity and not try to “discuss” until they were in custody.’
‘No, but it was the consequence of his actions.’ Harry made sure to let his eyes drift over the different wizards. ‘I won’t deny that Mister Malfoy and I haven’t always seen eye to eye, in fact, for most of our time at Hogwarts we were at each other’s throats, but I have actually learned from that, I learned that there’s this vicious circle going on at Hogwarts that makes it a breeding ground for division and hatred.’ Thank you Hermione. There was an immediate outburst of whispers all around the room. Minister Shacklebolt silenced them all with a look.
‘We should also take our robes off, blend in with the muggles.’ Harry proposed. Malfoy made a face, but he did take his robes off and handed them to Harry to put in his Bottomless Bag. He looked, yet again, more like a royalty than was really good for blending in. They weren’t supposed to stand out. Malfoy stood out. ‘Okay, you can’t wear that.’ Harry shook his head. ‘Take the waistcoat and the tie off and roll up your sleeves.’
They ordered the whole shebang and Harry paid for it because, as usual Ron forgot his Muggle money. Harry had taken to always carrying enough to at least buy them lunch/dinner because Ron
‘You called me Dray.’ Harry tilted his head in confusion. ‘In the warehouse, you called me Dray, no one has ever called me that before.’
‘Your NEWTs, c’mon Malfoy, keep up.’ Harry smirked and Malfoy seemed torn between going for his wand to hex him and… smiling? Was that the start of a smile? No, it was probably a grimace because Harry was awkward as hell.
, I have thought this through. I want this.’ Draco held his hands up in surrender. There was an uncharacteristic ink stain on his thumb. The dark ink was stark against his pale skin and Harry had a hard time dragging his eyes away from it.
Wizarding Tattoos how cool would that be?! The whole idea of Draco having a tattoo stems from a convo with my wonderful friend Lubs, who helped me figure out I love tattooed Draco.
When Robards came out, Hermione was finally allowed in, almost exactly when what had to be Amelia’s sister came bursting into the hospital. Draco had apparently sent her an owl to inform her that her sister had been hurt. She looked like a honey-blonde version of Amelia, maybe a few years older. She didn’t look at any of them, she only seemed to have time and energy to focus on her sister, which was fair.
hoped they were right about this. He did not want to do nothing but paperwork until he was thirty. That would suck.
Harry didn’t look at the process, but it definitely felt weird. Occasionally there would be shots of pain along his side but it was honestly not as bad as he’d expected. Or maybe he’d just been through worse. It took about an hour before Missy made a satisfied humming noise and Harry turned to look as she cast a final spell that settled over Harry’s side with a tingle.
? Buddy, you gotta help me here cause I’m bloody confused.’ Harry held up his hands in a helpless gesture.
‘I mean, probably. I think Robards is a great Auror, but I don’t really want to become like him. So tired and jaded and angry at the world, I don’t want that, but I already feel like it sometimes.’ Harry admitted.
Minister Shacklebolt looked at him like he wasn’t entirely sure how to feel about what Harry had said, but he also didn’t seem angry, so that was a win as far as he was concerned.
‘Could you go through the wards and get her out?’ Harry asked. ‘We can deal with dismantling the house itself later?’
pretty in a very soft kind of way. She was a few years older than them, Harry was pretty sure she was twenty two, but that wasn’t a big deal. Her hair was a warm brown, always waving gently over her shoulders. She had big, round eyes in an equally soft brown colour. She was always smiling. She was sweet and capable and she was never nasty towards Draco. ‘-so I’m not sure how I feel. Harry?
Death Eater and even that is questionable, since he was cleared of all charges.’ Harry said with a sheepish smile (the one that always worked) and he could feel Malfoy glare at him. Robards glared at him too. Great, he was already making friends. He did put his wand away, so that was good. He didn’t take his eyes off Malfoy as he spoke to what looked to be the other Auror there to administer the aptitude and character tests.
Harry made Ron and Amelia promise to tell them what happened tomorrow, after they’d all gotten some rest.
‘We need to talk about you and how you’re doing.’ Hermione said firmly, even though her voice wobbled. ‘Harry you look awful. Like a shadow of yourself. You’re always tired, you’re so skinny. All you do is work, work and work more. We barely see you anymore. Ron says you’ve been so much quicker to anger at work, you’re constantly getting in arguments with that Gaulding. You’re just not acting like yourself and we’re worried.’
Harry picked up his beer and motioned for Malfoy to do the same. Amelia slid onto the bench next to Malfoy and picked up the fourth beer.
As Hermione marched over to the desk, Draco came back through the doors. Now that Harry was actually capable of standing still, he could feel himself sway a little. Draco looked even more pale than he usually did. When had the circles under his eyes become so dark? His eyes drifted from Hermione to Harry, who was still standing. Harry could see him sigh. He seemed to drag himself over to the little table where there was the necessary equipment to make tea and coffee.
The young wizard’s name had been Rory and he’d only been seventeen. They were too late. Harry had taken one look at the body and left the room. He couldn’t. He wanted to force himself to go back in there and do what needed to be done to find the crazy bastard who had done this, but he couldn’t make his feet move. He just
‘So, this is the flat of the Saviour of the Wizarding World, huh?’ Draco asked, looking around Harry’s apartment as he sauntered in. It was his first time here and Harry had actually managed to add Draco to the wards without him realizing it. ‘I was expecting something more-‘
‘What would you want to get, Harry? I hope you will put some thought into it, these are very permanent yes?’ Hermione pressed gently and Harry was once again reminded how much more restraint she’d learned over the years. Back in the day Hermione would have already been half way towards panic and convinced Harry was about to ruin his life.
‘Swedish Short-Snout.’ He pulled at the bottom of the shirt, it was a little short on him. ‘They’re from, surprise, Sweden. The real life ones grow to about 22ft.’ Harry nodded.
‘Mother.’ Draco seemed surprised to find his mother in a chair near the window. Narcissa Malfoy looked almost exactly like she always had, a little older, but still tall and bordering on royal.
‘Good afternoon.’ Harry called out, they hadn’t been planning on meeting up, but maybe there was something about their latest case that wasn’t quite finished?
‘Just tell me what’s going on. I was worried.’ Harry didn’t mean for his voice to come out that sincere, but it did.
It wasn’t until the ceremony (which lasted about thirty minutes too long as far as Harry was concerned) was over and their group had moved to a nearby Wizarding pub that Harry got a few seconds alone with Malfoy. Malfoy dragged them to a table in the back corner of the pub as Ron and Amelia veered off to get the first round. Baez and the other two had gotten stopped as soon as they entered the pub by what seemed to be Gaulding’s father. The Weasley family was there too and Hermione would be joining them a little bit later.
And what was the absolutely most confusing was when Harry found Ron in a whispering argument with Draco on that Friday. Both of them immediately stopped talking when they noticed him. Harry just rolled his eyes at them and went to get his coffee. He didn’t even want to spend the energy on figuring out what they were up to, he was already exhausted.
‘You think this is what caused Death Eaters to join up with Voldemort, House rivalry at Hogwarts?’ A witch asked, disbelieve colouring her voice.
‘I can.’ Harry said as confidently as he could manage. He tipped his chin back just a little so that the light hit his scar. If he couldn’t use his name to do some good, than what the hell
‘I hate this new Wise Potter thing you have going on.’ Draco groaned as he stood and grabbed his own Auror coat. They hurried towards Robards office where the intel would be shared. Robards raised a single eyebrow as Harry came into the room
‘Obviously.’ Draco turned his head towards the clock and groaned. ‘I can’t go home to my mother like this at this hour, she’ll be horrified.’
‘Oh bloody hell.’ He marched towards him. ‘Sit still, I’ll do it.’ Draco muttered a few unpleasant things under his breath but he didn’t actually argue. Harry peeled his button up off. It was completely ruined, which was a shame, Harry loved this pale blue colour on Draco. Maybe he’d buy him a new one.
‘Proudfoot, Dawlish, go find the mother.’ He ordered and the two Aurors scurried off after a final disbelieving look at Draco with the little girl on his hip.
. Sure, they didn’t really hang out after training or anything, but they could have conversations now without getting to a point where they wanted to hex each other. He knew that Malfoy had a potions lab in his basement and that he had considered selling the Manor, but that his mother wouldn’t let him. Malfoy knew about Harry’s ongoing rivalry with the fat orange cat that belonged to his neighbour and liked to sneak into his kitchen and that Harry needed a steady supply of Dreamless Sleep. None of the more personal information was shared with intent, at least, not for Harry. It was just surprisingly easy to tell Malfoy things sometimes.
‘Right, it’s easy to forget you didn’t grow up in our world. Do you want to take a guess as to which element belongs to which?’ Harry considered that for a second.
He was going to work, catching the bad ones and making sure the good ones went home. Most of the time, he succeeded. Other times he found himself with blood all over his hands and the voice in the back of his head screaming “too slow, you were too slow, you didn’t work hard enough and now they’re dead”. He found himself on the doorstep of parents whose children weren’t coming home, on the doorstep of spouses whose loved ones were severely injured.
He reached out, his hands were so pale Harry could see the blue hues of his veins running under his skin. He took the wand back and slipped it into his pocket without looking at it further.
‘So, do you want to have dinner with Hermione and I today? You could stay over?’ Ron offered, drawing Harry’s attention away from Malfoy.
‘I believed what my father taught me, but then I got to Hogwarts and I did start to have doubts. However when the Dark Lord returned it was like… like my choice got taken away as much as my father’s. I was a Malfoy, therefor I was on the dark side. I was a Slytherin, so I was on the dark side. Everyone expected me to go dark, so I did.’ He shrugged, far too casual for the topic of conversation. ‘By the time I realized what a mistake I’d made, I was in too deep.’ Draco bumped his shoulder against Harry’s in a casual gesture, but the look on his face told Harry that he was fighting his emotions. ‘And then you gave me a second chance and you forced everyone else to do the same.’
had a week off and the first thing you do when you get back is get hurt. I don’t know what to do with you Potter.’ Draco turned his back to Harry, his voice stayed perfectly level, but that usually meant he was trying to hide something.
‘Yes, I was a Gryffindor, but I could have been a Slytherin as well. The houses aren’t black and white. Most people are a little bit of all of them and that’s good.’ He said with a smile.
will know.’ Harry said before bringing out the puppy-dog eyes. ‘Please?’ Draco did that thing where he made his face look blank, but it really meant that Harry was getting to him. When he rolled his eyes it meant he caved.
Draco was, as usual, the picture of control and grace. At least, to an outsider. Harry could see beyond that and Draco was happy. Tired, but happy. Happy to be back. Happy to be with Harry, at least, he hoped so.
They had been through so much together and somehow they’d survived and come out relatively okay in the end. Sure, Harry woke up with nightmares almost nightly and he’d taken to taking a small dose of Dreamless Sleep every night before he went to bed so that he’d at least catch a few hours and sure Ron flinched at every loud sound and sure Hermione would sometimes still get that haunted look in her eyes and she only ever wore long sleeves and Neville would clench his fists sometimes without a clear reason, but they were alive and they’d be okay.
At first, Ron was horrified that Harry was letting Draco supply him with Dreamless Sleep now. He was convinced Draco would try to poison him. Luckily, when Ron and Amelia (along with Gaulding and Blueroot) were promoted a month after Harry and Draco, Ron figured out that they had a common enemy.
‘Oh right, you haven’t been around. I’ve been living here for the last two months.’ Harry said, he knew Draco was going to ask why. ‘I kind of lost inspiration of what to do food-wise so Hermione suggested it might be good for me to go live with Kreacher, he could make sure I ate.’ Draco watched him attentively as they headed inside.
He didn’t want to see this. This was not what he needed in his life. He already knew there was darkness out there, he didn’t need it stuck in his face like this.
‘You have to prove that they can trust you and you have to be there to do it, but they won’t let you be there because they don’t trust you. You have to break the cycle. Now
‘O-kay.’ Harry said to himself before following Draco. ‘None of the other rooms are really liveable, so I can Transfigure you a bed here or downstairs? Or you could take my bed and I’ll sleep downstairs. I don’t really care.’
‘I just, I heard blondes are your type and I didn’t want that to be why you… treated me properly. I know better now.’ He hurried to add, but Harry was still stuck on the first part.
And that was that. The first proper case they’d solved together. Harry wanted to grin and poke at Draco until he laughed and then go have a Firewhisky to celebrate, but Robards was still there, so Harry held his tongue.
‘Just a questionable taste in men?’ Ginny asked, but it wasn’t her normal good-natured teasing. There was a genuine curious undertone to it.
‘Okay, are you familiar with this area?’ Harry asked, spreading out the map and grabbing a red marker from the little penholder and circling the little girl’s last known location. Draco came to stand next to him, bumping his hip against Harry’s as he leaned forward on his elbows. He traced his index finger along the street where the girl had disappeared from.
, this is stupid.’ Ron stepped to the left as Harry tried to dodge around him. Shit, his friend knew him too well.
‘Potter, in here.’ Robards ordered as he marched past their cubicles with an extra serious expression on his face. Robards always looked serious, but in gradations. This was heading towards his “someone died” look. Harry pushed himself away from his desk and out of his chair, grabbing his coat from the back of the rolling chair (one muggle invention Harry insisted on having in the office).
‘I feel fine now. I’m fine.’ Harry stressed again. ‘That’s why we’re a duo, right? So we can look out for each other?’
‘It was good to see you, you should join us on another lunch soon.’ She said with a clearly perfected friendly smile.
‘Soon.’ Draco said. ‘They have a patient currently in St Mungo’s that doesn’t look like they’ll make it. It would be the first death from these potions, but it won’t be the last. They need to be stopped.’ Harry nodded, not knowing what to say to that. If this had been the other way around, he knew he would have taken the assignment too, he just hated the idea of Draco going off without him, without any back-up.
He was tired of waking up in a panic searching for Ron and Hermione (and Neville and Ginny and Luna and so many more), convinced they were dead or in the process of being killed. The amount of times he’d already been halfway out of bed before he realized that he wasn’t in a forest or at Hogwarts or at Malfoy Manor. He’d banged his legs into the bedside table, his actual bed and the couch (that time he’d actually made it out of his bedroom before realizing where he was) and he’d taken to putting his wand in the drawer of his bedside table after nearly setting his curtains on fire.
She was beautiful with her gold blonde hair and her dark mysterious eyes, she was fun and she had a spark and yet… she just wasn’t Draco.
‘Well, yeah.’ All the fight had drained out of him pretty quickly. Draco stared at him for a good minute, Harry fought not to squirm. He wasn’t ashamed of this and he was 95% sure Draco loved him back. Like 90% at least. Maybe 85%. The number may have dropped to about 60% in the time that Draco was silent.
‘Thank you.’ She got up from the chair, all elegance. ‘I need to speak to my son for a second, would you mind waiting here?’
He was a little more paranoid. Draco had never been one to look over his shoulder. His shoulders had always been back, chin up, almost
‘Well, if that is everything we should take this to a vote.’ Minister Shacklebolt said and Harry jolted. He stood up quickly.
‘Thanks, do you want the last piece?’ Draco shook his head before Harry had even properly finished the question.
‘That is not the only way to control someone.’ Harry said firmly. He was glad Hermione had helped him prepare for this, even if she hadn’t done it entirely voluntarily. ‘In fact, the easiest way to get someone to do what you want is to threaten them or their loved ones with bodily harm or death. Both mister Malfoy’s father and mother were at one point
‘We’ll Apparate into the Ministry, I can wear my Auror coat for the rest of the day.’ Harry tried to reassure him. He was pretty sure Draco also had his Auror coat in the office, but neither of them seemed to want to mention that.
‘Of course, we were happy to help.’ Harry said and it seemed like that was the moment where the mother really
‘I want to get a tattoo.’ He said as he put his empty plate on the coffee table. Now it was Hermione’s turn to look surprised. Ron released a sigh of relief.
‘Bloody hell, Malfoy.’ He tried not to sound angry but his heartbeat was up and his head was pounding along to the rhythm of it. ‘Don’t scare me like that.’
And then he kissed him. Draco kissed him. On the mouth. Harry was pretty proud of himself for not freezing. It wasn’t like he’d kissed a guy before, or had even kissed that many people in general, but it just felt easy with Draco. He wasn’t scared or even nervous.
Aurors would take her to the Ministry’s Apparating point and take her to the Manor where she’d be escorted inside. Harry left the courtroom as soon as she had disappeared through the doors. He really hoped Malfoy had stayed behind to wait for the results of his mother’s trail.
After they’d graduated Draco had dragged him to Gladrags Wizardwear where he’d gotten Harry to spend more on clothes in one day than he had spent in the last nineteen years of his life. His closet now consisted of more than just plain black robes, old jeans and hoodies. He had button ups and a few
Once Gregory Goyle arrived and had gotten over the shock of seeing Harry there, their lunch was… interesting. The girls were nice enough, if Harry ignored their needling about his hair and glasses. Goyle was quiet, he seemed unsure what to do about Harry, which was fair. Zabini was… well, at first Harry thought he was kind of a dick. He seemed very miffed that Harry had been invited to
Amelia heard them first. The voices coming down the hallway. Excited voices, happy voices. Harry was out of his chair immediately. He nearly ran into Proudfoot as he rushed out of the breakroom.
‘Holy shite Malfoy.’ Harry checked the list again just to make sure he’d read that right. ‘You’ve only got one less than Hermione and all Os too.’
‘Probably.’ Draco gave in and followed Harry from the door to the Apparating point. Harry hated Apparating and he avoided it whenever possible, but there was no time right now.
It had been a strange day when he realized that, but they’d worked together so much and spend so many hours in each other’s company that it was only natural, right? Plus, he still called him Malfoy out loud, so it wasn’t like he needed to know.
Ron drew Harry into a conversation and he found himself truly relaxing for the first time in what felt like forever. Malfoy’s shoulder was pressed against his in a way that now felt comfortable, the humming of conversations going on around them and the taste of beer on his tongue was beyond nice.
Still, he smiled to himself. Mondays were usually quite rough, the students were still with their heads in the weekend, and to be fair, so was Harry. Especially since he’d been away from Hogwarts and hadn’t had much chance to see Draco.
He should probably take a full dose so that he’d sleep through the night, but the drowsy feeling of the potion also made him anxious because he felt like he wouldn’t be ready if he was attacked. He wasn’t sure who he’d even be attacked by. No one except Ron and Hermione even knew he didn’t live at Grimmauld place and his wards wouldn’t allow anyone but them and Harry himself in, unless invited. It was just a giant pain all around.
was an example of something he probably wouldn’t have said if he’d thought it through first. Another Gryffindor trait, however? Going backwards wasn’t really something they subscribed to, so forwards it was.
In their first week of working together she told him that if he ever tried to ask her out, she’d kick him so hard he’d sing soprano for a week. Harry had spit out his coffee.
‘That’s nice.’ Harry said, far too late. Draco raised a singular, sharp eyebrow at him. ‘I’m supposed to head over to the Weasley’s for dinner.’ He added, he could feel the urge to babble come on, so he bit his lip to stop himself.
‘Why exactly were you two together this morning? I thought even Junior Aurors got the weekends off unless there was some kind of emergency?’ Ah, that’s what she was after.
He searched around in his bag (he’d gotten a bottomless one, just like Hermione) for something to entertain himself with while he waited for Ron. He didn’t find anything, but it wasn’t necessary.
Malfoy gave a far more interesting lecture on History of the Dark Arts than the instructor had given. Harry nailed his test.
‘Yes.’ Harry said without much hesitation. ‘They’re very pretty, I’d recognize them anywhere.’ The eyes in question widened slightly. The surprise was quickly wiped away for that mildly annoyed expression that seemed to be Malfoy’s default.
He didn’t realize how bad it was until he was at Ron and Hermione for dinner one day and she burst into tears. Ron looked pained, but not surprised.
‘Wow, thank you for that astute observation Ronald.’ Hermione said. ‘Why would that be a problem?’ She raised her eyebrows and tilted her chin up.
Their days were long, spend digging through lists of Portkey requests to find the singular one made by a fugitive wizard, through lists of potions sales looking for an incredibly specific combination of ingredients and searching an entire house top to bottom looking for a singular golden ring that had been Transfigured into
The course was actually pretty interesting but Harry’s brain refused to focus for longer than a few minutes at a time. Luckily, Malfoy paid enough attention for the both of them. He seemed to know when to do that, sometimes he’d keep actual notes. Which Harry had told him reminded him of Hermione, which in turn made Malfoy look positively horrified. Harry just sat there in his seat in the back with his cosy sweater and his tea and tried not to fall asleep on the spot.
‘Yes well, not everyone wants to be as big of a know-it-all as Granger.’ There was a little of the familiar venom. ‘And it’s not like I’ve had much else to do than study. Not all of us have to do interviews, get medals and sign people’s foreheads all day.’
“Not going by normal email submission then?” Ron scooched his chair a bit closer to his wife's, peeking over her shoulder and bushy hair to study the bullet-pointed parchment.
“I do, thank you, dear. Mimsy, get my things.” The elf from their dinner at the Manor appeared with Narcissa's luggage.
If he were alive, he would've been petrified. Death Eaters roaming the grounds, the Mark appearing over the school… for a sweet moment or two, Draco was glad he was dead and didn't have to worry… but then he started worrying about the other students, the innocents, his parents.
As the usual, Blaise's letter had him cackling with glee. That man and his sense of humor. Oh, Draco wouldn't be the one to tell Blaise that he was in love with both Dean and Seamus, he'd get laughed out of his invitation to lunch. But still, anyone with bloody
Now the dragon’s eyes were really sparkling, and Harry was struck by how beautiful he was. Nature had a way of creating some pretty stunning creatures—he had a soft spot for the bright fire-dwelling salamanders—but there was something otherworldly about this particular dragon.
"Wait right here, and don't touch anything," she said, and the display case quickly shut on its own. She breezed behind the counter and went down to the far end, unlocking the case and lifting a necklace from it. Draco leaned over to try to get a good look at it, but she was quickly turning around and striding back towards him. “This should do.”
“Ah. That does sound like Draco… Walls up and on his guard. It’s a good thing you won’t give up on him easily, won’t you?”
Especially since now it seemed that… That if anything were to go wrong… He could easily turn Harry with one single bite. He wouldn’t ever wish that on him. Not that he wished it on himself, but… Oh, this all had gone to hell, hadn’t it?
“It means, husband mine, that Harry won't have to hide or lie about anything. He can admit to his war trauma without them asking ‘what war?’ and they'll be able to see and enter Grimmauld Place and we wouldn't have to hide Teddy's abilities around them.” She smirks as the two Weasleys nod along, understanding how fortuitous the situation is.
Unsure what to do, and knowing that actually touching the dragon would be a bad idea, he took out his wand. He could at least perform a series of diagnostic spells that would tell him more about the dragon. But as soon as his wand was out, the dragon was back on his feet, snarling.
She nodded. “Thank you for doing what you can, but I believe we both know that Draco is particularly strong-willed at the worst of times. Why don’t we move to the dining room, though? You must be famished.”
I could only imagine Great Aunt Walburga rolling in her grave. Mother’s told me horror stories, of course, so such a thought only warms my heart.
Draco was up on his feet— paws?— in an instant and padded over to her, his tail wagging. He approached her, almost whining in question.
"None of your business," he growled, voice tight with emotion. He didn't have to share his entire bloody tragic life story with them, blood relations or not. "I think I should go--"
“I need to get a Mandrake leaf to start out, so I was thinking I’d go visit Professor McGonagall tomorrow, maybe get a leaf from Neville.”
“Of course it counts. You can’t learn it overnight, and I believe you had to unlearn a few things from the war, as well. Progress is progress, darling, and should be celebrated.”
Harry shook his head softly and blinked a few time, trying to process the new information. "So you think I… you think I made him anxious? Maybe I overwhelmed him..?" Harry
Harry just shook his head fondly and took his seat, taking out his own late lunch. It was important to have the energy to go into a raid-- exhaustion and low blood sugar have landed Harry in the first aid office before. (The Ministry healers knew him by name, from all the small injuries that didn't warrant a trip to St. Mungo's.) Across from him, Draco huffed and shifted in his chair before raising an eyebrow. “Any information from our ‘Deputy Auror’ about the mission?”
“...Ah. I see.” Well, that would explain it, then. She was more than blasted off the tapestry, she was completely erased from it. Sure, it would’ve been a scandal, but to completely forget your firstborn child… it was extreme. Also, it got Draco to wondering… was this the reason why his mother was arranged to marry his father? To fulfill a broken marriage contract between the Blacks and Malfoys from the generation before? “I’m… sorry. I don’t… I never knew-”
Draco, if I saw you in a collar with a leash, I think my heart would explode… that being said, the image hasn't left my mind in days. Perhaps that's why you're such a brat, you just need a firm hand, don't you? You'd be all sweet for me after I took you over my knee, or showed you who you belong to, wouldn't you darling?
always wondered if he'd done something to make Draco flee as he had that night. After all, he would've absolutely stopped if Draco had been uncomfortable or against the kissing… but he had seemed like he'd wanted it.
The Wolfsbane meant it wasn’t painful, but I think I’d prefer the pain. I was aware of every bone in my body changing and shifting, of pieces of fur pushing through my skin, and my teeth shifting and changing in my own mouth
With his wand, he made long vertical cuts up both of young Malfoy’s forearms and the shirt was once again stained with blood. The deed done and the body sufficiently mutilated, Albus stopped the bleeding with a quick spell. Albus summoned a house elf  to pack all of Draco’s possessions while the other students were in their classes.
In a blinding flash of light, a figure seemed to materialize, just as opaque as his spectral audience. His hair, face, and skin looked largely unchanged-- as pale in not-quite-death as he was in life. The most striking thing about him were the large slashes across his scrawny chest, easily visible through his shirt. Much of him was soaked in silver that shimmered when it caught the pale spring sunlight.
Ah, about the childhood… not good. Erm, in fact I saw a Muggle therapist about it weekly for two years. They helped a lot more than the Mind Healer did, at least with all the pre-war trauma. I still go by every once and awhile, actually. I promise I’ll tell you more when you come home.
I think I would like to keep it quiet. Just for a little bit? Just for us to get used to it. I do like the idea, though, of going to — say — Diagon Alley on your arm. For multiple reasons. Partially to show you off and silently brag that you’re on my arm, and not theirs.
Also… this was dinner with his work partner/friend's mum… he wasn't going on a date. That shocked a bit of a laugh out of him as he changed into a dark blue collared shirt. The girl at the shop said it would bring out his eyes, make his skin glow. (He didn't know about that, but what did he know?) Looking in the mirror, he nodded. This was probably as good as it was going to get. He didn’t want to be late, at least. Narcissa seemed to like him, he didn’t want to give her reason not to.
Harry groaned, putting his face in his hands for a moment. “Okay. Okay! This is fine—” He looked up into Narcissa’s anxious face and sighed. “I brought him there last night. Our raid went horribly wrong, and he was hurt. I stayed the night in their waiting room… and they woke me up about 15 minutes ago to tell me that he disappeared. He escaped.”
“I… believe so, yes. My mother, Narcissa Black, daughter of Cygnus and Druella.” Gwendolyn nodded sagely, still smiling at him.
Really, Harry, don’t worry so much. Yes, it is quiet, but… I think I needed time to myself. Time without you, or mother, or Blaise or Pansy, or anyone else. Time to reflect.
Have you found a potioneer for your wolfsbane yet? Though I'm sure you could probably brew it yourself, you were always aces at potions at Hogwarts. Or is it too dangerous? I didn't pay enough attention in class… too busy dodging bad guys. Does the gash still hurt? What about your joints? I know Remus used to complain to Sirius about the pain often… I hope it isn't that bad for you… I hate to think of you in pain.
“Yes, I’d say about a third of our family doesn’t have magic,” Gwendolyn said, shifting Felix up onto her shoulder. He made a little noise in his sleep and settled. Draco watched the babe for a moment before slowly letting his eyes float up to make contact with Gwendolyn’s.
“I won’t, I promise. The, ah, the Muggles have a saying. ‘If you love something, set it free. If it comes back, it’s yours forever.’ I’m not… I’m not saying I necessarily
"I'm certain he'd say the same thing about you, dear. You wouldn't believe how often I'd heard of you through him." She was smiling at him, and… It really reminded him of Molly, it was almost honey sweet, and as warm as the tea they sipped from. It was obvious that she cared deeply about Draco… and perhaps Harry held out hope that maybe she carded for him a bit, too.
Harry was up in Sirius' old room, cleaning and snooping. The place was empty except for him, why shouldn't he poke around? The room was much as he'd seen it during the Horcrux hunt, with the same muggle posters spelled to the walls and tokens of his godfather's life littered about the room. There was just a lot more dust on it now.
“Draco Malfoy, I’ve called you eight times! Sebastien is free for the day, he and Valerie are ready to take you out!”
with magic. “A ring.” Harry moved closer, peering down at it. Not only did it swirl with magic, but it sparkled.
After Harry had waited for what felt like hours but was most likely only a few minutes, the dragon relaxed once again and slowly moved its wing back up. Harry breathed a sigh of relief, and started to inch away again. This time, the dragon made no noise, but simply turned its head and gave Harry a look that would have made even Hermione Granger shake in her boots. Harry decided to stay put after that.
She laughed, patting his arm as they set up the stairs. "Harry, dear, you flatter me. I'll be turning fifty this year, though."
And you berk, you know well enough by now that my working isn’t about the money. If it were, I’d be like my father and stick strictly to business and to politics, as that
And it makes me laugh that you like my clothes so much… you know I get them from the cheap shops, right? The pants were in a five-pack at Primark for £3. Naturally, I already have a pair of pyjama pants set aside for you to commandeer when you come home. (Nice and soft and dark grey for you, with pockets too. Aren't I the best fiancé?)
“Y… Yes,” he said quietly. He felt himself go a bit pale and October sat down beside him, placing a steady hand on his shoulder.
“You wouldn’t happen to have Draco over, would you?” Although guessing from the robe, Harry already knew that Pansy was either alone or entertaining someone who definitely wasn’t Draco.
Allow me to introduce myself, first. My name is Gwendolyn Roots, though I was originally Gwendolyn Malfoy. Please, feel free to call me Gwen. I’m Draco’s great aunt, from his father’s side. I believe that this picture may prove the family resemblance.
“Well, of course. Harry, you’ve made your intentions perfectly clear, I understand if you two are still trying to keep it quiet-”
His long tail dragged on the ground and his wings drooped. His entire huge pearly body went still and his head drooped, looking down at the clawed up earth in front of him. Harry was easily able to slide from his perch at the dragon’s neck onto the ground, now getting nervous.
Molly thought it over, setting her knitting aside and nodding slowly. “Well… Where did you two meet?”
He watched for a second more to see what the dragon would do next, but it seemed that he—was it a he? Harry couldn’t tell from where he was—was down for good. The dragon was making strange whuffling noises, but wasn’t trying to get up or fly away.
Did you tell the headmistress of my condition? She’s willing to accept us both, with the full knowledge of what I am, and the risks she would be taking upon herself for me to teach at the school around the students? If so, I’d love to use the dungeons for my own brewing. They have an atmosphere that not even the darkest Malfoy cellar can hold a candle to, wouldn’t you agree?
Gin says the wager is set at 50 Galleons, to be collected immediately after the Harpies win. I think I'm going to stay out if this one, love, I know how competitive you get, especially with Ginny. (Not that I'm also not competitive as hell, but that's not the point.) What shall we do when you win?
Suddenly, Harry wasn't very hungry. "I don't know. I mean, I guess I understand why he'd be anxious about it, but I made the move. I feel like that was a big risk on my part."
“Because it seems we're going to match,” Draco said, red in the face and nervous. Harry paused for a solid 10 seconds before blushing and rubbing the back of his neck.
“Not at all, Harry dear, come in, come in! Oh, it’s been ages since you’ve called around. The house is so
He took of his glasses and rubbed his hands over his eyes, already tired. "Okay. Alright, fine. Tonight. Does it say how many people we're expected to bring in… or take down?"
Luna nodded as she put her tea cup down. “No wonder Ginny had so much to complain over.” That definitely caught Harry off guard. He hadn’t thought too much about other possible reasons why he and Ginny wouldn’t have worked, because he had a Draco to pine after, and he thought Ginny and Luna were much better together.
“That bloody terrifying, huh? I keep telling you, you’re going to be fine. You practically raised the rest of the boys in the dorm.” He looked over at Hermione and winked. “Taught us all how to shave with magic in our third year, only one of us who knew how.”
“I think that Draco was frightened, yes. Frightened of what could be, and what it could mean. Don’t you often think it’s much safer to remain comfortable, rather than to risk anything?” And honestly, Harry didn't know… because he
“You lost more than most, it is easy to understand, when put in perspective.” She came a little closer, gingerly resting her hand on his shoulder. “In another life, I believe you would’ve been the happiest, most cared for boy in the world, and I do mean it literally. Your parents loved each other, and you, much more than a number of other people love their families. Not to mention the adoration of my cousin and Remus.” Harry’s shoulders shook and he sniffed, immediately trying to wipe at his face with his sleeve.
Leaning against the counter, he finally turned around and got back to it. “Dumbledore didn’t care about the individual people. He cared about winning a war.”
“She complains about me? Was I really that bad of a boyfriend?” If word ever got out to Draco, they’d never be together. Draco deserved only the best in romantic partners.
"...Oh. Well, I suppose," she said with a tone that made it sound like that wasn't what she was talking about. But then what else could she be talking about? Complaining about Harry was his favorite pastime. But he wasn’t about to argue with Draco’s mother, especially when he was newly-bitten and definitely missing.
She frowned, crossing her arms and leaning against the doorway. “No. I haven’t seen him since our weekly lunch on Thursday.” Fuck. Well, Harry was quickly running out of places where Draco could be hiding. He dragged a hand down his face and sighed. Pansy was looking at him oddly, one dark eyebrow arched in question.
He pushed through the morning crowds, keeping his focus on Malfoy's quickly retreating back. Something ugly twisted in his chest-- something angry and bitter, black with fury at Malfoy and all he stood for. He followed him up to the 6th floor bathroom and watched for a handful of moments as Malfoy gripped the edge of the sink, hunched over the porcelain. He was as pale as his dress shirt, and he was sobbing; choked off, gut-wrenching sobs, the kind that would eventually make one sick. The ugliness inside of Harry reared its head at seeing Malfoy so weak-- and it broke through the surface.
baby. That’s Felix.” Felix, in question, seemed to give a gurgle, not much caring for any of the adult conversation. He had a few locks of honey blond wisps atop his head, but other than that… Not incredibly remarkable. Then again, what baby was?
“Scuse me?” Hermione shook her head and produced a handful of MACUSA document copies for the redheads to peruse. Ilvermorny graduation confirmations… hair potion patents… a St. Augustinia’s mind healer license… a Hogwarts graduation certificate.
On that day, on the first of June 1998, Harry James Potter left the Queen of Wands with a square of muggle plastic wrap surgically taped over his left pectoral, upon which was inked ‘James and Lily’, in his parents own writing.
Narcissa took a moment to think about it as she sat. “I believe so, yes.” She rose a hand, giving it a wave, and murmuring her spell quietly. A large book fell into her hands. “Perfect, exactly where I left it.”
She took his hand and squeezed it. “I think that’d be perfect then. But I didn’t know that you were already planning so far ahead. You must be sure he’s going to accept.”
Startling, Draco stared up at her before smiling. “Well… I do mean to visit the vineyard. Miranda, yes? I have a friend that would love a fresh bottle.”
Remy grinned at him while Sapphire took care of paying the waiter. "That's a good sign, Draco. Can you imagine your life with him? The day to day, the big events?"
When Harry followed Malfoy into the 6th floor bathroom, he didn't entirely know what he was going to say, only that he's finally going to confront him.
Harry opened his mouth to ask more about the godfather he felt he never truly got to know, when Porthos flapped in with a letter attached to his foot. Maybe Ron or Robards asking Harry where the hell he was…
Neville looked Harry over, and for a long, terrifying moment, he thought he was going to say no- “Come on, Mandrakes are in greenhouse six.” Harry let out a breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding and followed Neville down towards the correct greenhouse.
“For a crime he did not commit, and you know this. Becoming a child’s godparent is a huge honor, and a big responsibility. It requires a ritual similar to a bonding ceremony, and there is blood magic involved. You would’ve been safe in Sirius’ care, because he was your father, for all intents and purposes, after your own parents were killed. In the eyes of your magic, anyways.”
Something peculiar was happening in the 6th floor toilets… The doors had sealed themselves from the inside, not letting anyone inside. Coldness was seeping out from beneath the wooden doors, leeching through the stone walls of the castle itself.
She's not the only one worrying. I haven’t said anything about what happened to you that night… But you need to owl me back or I will. It’s been a bloody fucking week.
It didn’t take much for Neville to get Harry a new leaf. He told him sternly not to lose it again, and Harry agreed, eager to head to his lessons with the Headmistress. He made it up to her office just before noon, as they’d agreed, a touch out of breath from the number of stairs. “Come in, Mr. Potter.” How did headpeople do that?! It was all part of the magic and mystery, he supposed, as he pushed the door open. He smiled as he saw her behind her desk, finishing up a letter to someone.
It would destroy the room, eating up everything in its wake, including the Boy Who Lived and the two idiots that Draco had once called friends. He started to panic, pleading with the castle.
“If I put you in a fitted grey waistcoat, you could go work the front counter for Remy and Sapphire,” she said, coming over and fondly combing her hand through his hair. “Go on, let Valerie and Sebastien take you shopping, hm?”
I'll wait up for you, my love, and I'll leave the wards keyed in for you too. Take a Portkey in to London and
“Can you, uh…” Harry cleared his throat. “Can you tell Alfred I’m sorry?” Neville looked up at him and grinned, shaking his head.
“Hey, Val. Looking for Bas?” The woman only glanced at Valerie for a moment before going back to… whatever it was. Was that how tattoos were applied? What sort of machine was it?
"That is her goal, yes," he told them with a sly smirk. "It's been her dreams since she was a young girl."
“Untrue. I can name at least two dozen people that would very much agree with me.” She cupped his face with one hand. “You are a good man, and you prioritize nearly everyone’s happiness and safety above your own. You need to learn that you are worthy of love, and your needs are just as important as mine, Draco’s, Teddy’s, or anyone else’s.”
