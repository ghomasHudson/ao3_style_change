The force of the unexpected spell knocked him forward on hands and knees as his wand flew from his hand and a second voice boomed, "Petrificus totalus!"
"Sorry, professor," Harry said, joining her and Periwinkle with Draco at his side. Periwinkle looked Draco up and down with her mouth twisted in concentration like she was trying to figure out how to solve a problem. He frowned at her. "They're here because what happened today made me realize that I can't hide from some things that I've been hiding from and I need some support if I want to actually be... ok."
Strengthening his resolve, he waved his wand and summoned his cloak.
"Gross, mate."
"Harry, let's get two things straight: Firstly, The Dark Lord was one of the most powerful, most prolific wizards of our time, right on par with Dumbledore and Grindelwald. Sebastian Krafft is a bloke who spent a year begging to eat my--"
"Well... partly." Harry drew back, feeling wounded. "Not
Draco finished his bite and shrugged.
Draco chanted and she began to stir.
"25 Under 25!" list last year. No amount of accolades, however, seemed to prevent him from being reduced to little more than a reformed teenage death eater and disappointing son whenever he returned home.
Harry had gotten so used to thinking of oral sex as something taboo that he hadn't even thought about receiving it! But, now, the thought of Draco's warm mouth on him made his cock grow inexplicably and impossibly harder.
. He tried to push any thoughts of that crazy woman out of his head.
But now, Harry's traitorous mind kept fantasizing about Draco taking over in that bossy, assertive, possessive way that he had when they'd made love. He swallowed as his eyes traveled lower to the tent in Draco's pajama pants and he blushed fiercely at the thought that, right now, he would like
"It's.... complicated," was all he could think to say.
"Not when some of us have been waiting fifteen long years for you boys to sort yourselves out." Harry's jaw dropped when he realized that the cheeky comment came from Headmistress McGonagall. She fixed him with a stern brow in challenge and he smiled back, sheepishly.
Draco continued to float. He didn't pressure him to do anything at all, he just continued to float with his eyes shut. Harry started to do some of the deep breathing that he'd learned in the book and he gradually felt the anxiety dissipate.
Draco smirked, smugly, when he caught the way Harry's eyes stayed glued to his hips.
"Harry, can you come dance with me?" he whined.
look. I didn't want to get that from you, too." He shook his head then stared down at his trainers. "I hate feeling pitied."
She gasped in shock.  "You sneaky, sneaky snake! How?!"
Harry smiled wryly when Draco held up a pinky finger. Harry wrapped his own around Draco's at the same time that their lips locked to the sound of more than a couple of wolf-whistles from his family.
Draco rolled his eyes and removed the parchment bearing the gold foil letterhead of Z&M International.
"Come off it, Draco, I'm not blind."
"You know..." He blanched. "I'll be sad..."
"Fine!" Potter threw his hands up in exasperation and stomped off towards the door.
Draco shrugged out of the embrace and rolled his eyes but smiled back, wryly.
"The timing was completely coincidental, I assure you. More a reflection of my unfortunate luck than anything," he said breathily as Harry reached out to tuck long, soft strands of blonde hair behind his ear. "The closet is a dangerous place. Can make you miss out on so much
He frowned when he saw the name Blaise Zabini in the 7th year dormitory next to Ginny. He rolled his eyes because of course Ginny had figured out how to get a boy up the slide.
The girls smiled and there were some
"Thanks, you guys. You really showed up for me today."
"I'm sorry, Draco. You deserved so much more from them. I don't know if it means anything, but..." He looked away and shook his head as if debating something. When he returned his gaze to Draco's, there was nervous sincerity shining there. "I was so proud of you when I heard you actually did it... Came out, I mean. Finally decided to live for yourself." He rolled his eyes and added as an afterthought: "I mean, annoyed as all fuck that you waited until the week I proposed to Ginny, but, still proud."
"I think... I think Ollivander freaked out and wanted me to see if I could still use your wand that day to see if we could both truly be possessors of the same wand..."
Draco apparated to the secluded backstreet and headed, on foot, in the direction that Harry had scrawled out for him. He was preoccupied with a million thoughts that made him both nervous and excited about his rendezvous with the Chosen One.
"GRAM! Did you see?!" he yelled back towards the house as Andromenda stepped out onto the porch, smirk firmly in place. "Draco's here!"
Draco's eyes fluttered open slightly and Harry helped him sit up. It took some effort from that angle but he was able to get his pants back up around his hips and jeans buttoned, all while trying to give him the decency of not looking.
is a benevolent man who helps the kids in more ways than just handing out toys."
"Yea, I have no idea why it's just been sort of working
Blaise stopped and pinned him against the wall. "You look fine, trust me," he said as he licked up his neck to the soft part under his ear.
"Jansen! Are you alright?!" Robards boomed from just outside the cell.
He had to give it to his best friend: When he flooed her last night to say that he needed her charm, she didn't hesitate. Not even when he insisted that she only take muggle transportation so that she could avoid the portkeys. He didn't want anything placing her here when shite hit the fan. He'd much prefer the ministry think she was still sitting pretty in Paris.
Fred nodded, solemnly. "So, I did the only humane thing I could think to do: invited the prat over to help move things along!"
that was with Malfoy in potions!"
After the war, the ministry offered Harry a large sum of money along with his Order of Merlin. Harry had initially refused it, the situation feeling eerily like 4th year and accompanied by just as much guilt at the idea of being rewarded when people had died that he couldn't protect. But, like with the Triwizard winnings, he realized that just because he didn't want the money, didn't mean that it couldn't be invested in those who could use it. And with that, he created the Hedwig Center for children affected by the war.
the moment he'd got home from that shiteshow of a dinner. But tonight...
Draco smirked, realizing that Harry was so close and he hadn't even touched his cock yet. As if he'd read Draco's mind, he tried to reach a hand between them, desperate for release, but Draco quickly pinned his hands above his head. Harry whimpered.
Draco's eyes widened and he heard gasps from the kids. What was Potter getting at?
Draco smiled warmly but then it turned rueful.
"Greg! Wands exist for a reason! --Hey! Be careful with that chandelier!"
Harry quirked a brow at him. Ron wasn't usually the one to probe him on emotions.
He had walked down the streets of Soho with wide eyes, amazed by all the red lights, colorful buildings, rainbow flags, and people dressed in flamboyant clothing or even drag. Every where he turned he was met with a smile, surrounded by people who seemed to have no qualms about just being themselves.
!" Draco didn't hear any screams so assumed Harry must still be paralyzed. "How 'bout I rip that pretty little arse of yours apart? Give you a last hoorah before the Dark Lord rips your last breath from your lungs."
He rolled his eyes. If she thought that was too much then she really wasn't going to like the next ask.
He nodded. He got it. And Potter was right because he couldn't back out of this wedding, not now... His eyes were burning as the possibilities that he never knew were possibilities slipped through his fingers like grains of sand. The fates were cruel and surely he deserved this. He turned away so his hurt wouldn't show.
Harry nodded and stared off in thought. When his gaze met Draco's again, he bit his lip as if he were hesitant to speak.
Harry couldn't resist. He leaned in and let their lips brush together tenderly, their noses rubbing gently. Draco's eyes closed and his breath hitched as Harry reached out to cradle his head in his hand and he angled his head to kiss him harder. Draco responded by wrapping an arm around his back and pulling him even closer as he licked at Harry's bottom lip. Harry parted his lips and allowed Draco's tongue entry. He explore his mouth, gently at first and then passionately, possessively. Harry could have sworn he felt magic course between them as he felt all of his senses heighten. Draco tasted of treacle tart and smelled of lemon shampoo and felt so soft to hold but... Harry angled his hips to get closer and gasped when he felt how hard he was through the thin pajama bottoms he still wore and waves of pleasure shot through him as his own hard cock rubbed against him. He wondered briefly if this had been what Ginny meant by
"Well, I'm happy to be your distraction
Harry smiled, brilliantly, and he finally nodded, reassured.
. He laughed when he got to the end and saw Ron's sloppy, hastily scrawled handwriting:
case, I just helped a bit!"
Ok, what more was there to deny.
"And you're expected to lead?"
"Mother agreed to meet with me for tea at the Manor," he said as nonchalantly as he could manage.
Malfoy shrugged.
At that, Harry could no longer contain himself. He stood abruptly, letting go of Draco's hand, to pace back and forth on the threadbare rug. He ran his fingers through his hair, threatening to dislodge his bun.
!" he said and stood back as the door to the prefect's bathroom opened. Draco was already there, carefully selecting the right combination of bubbles, soaps, and oils from the hundred golden taps around the pool-sized bath. Harry could already smell hints of lavender and eucalyptus. "You really couldn't just tell me the password? I had to ask Hermione and she was
Harry smiled. "And what are you going to play this on?"
He sighed. He had long ago worked out that Ginny and Blaise had a...
He buried his nose in
There was a tiny gasp followed by a tug at his hand and Harry looked down to see Teddy looking up at him with wide eyes. "Harry, are you going to cry?" he asked, astounded. Harry stiffened, slightly, when it occurred to him that it was probably a sight to see for his friends, who had rarely ever seen him as anything but stalwart and (ok, maybe a little) emotionally repressed, to now watch him on the verge of losing it entirely.
"Well, Oblansk's guys were still outside of the restaurant when Ginny and I left. I didn't think much of it, thought they might be, I don't know, debriefing about the meeting or something. I wished them a goodnight and apparated us to the flat. But, then, we saw them again..."
"Andromeda explained that she had no more choice in whether she stayed or left the family than she did in falling in love. She fell in love and had been naive enough to hope that her family's love for her was infinite enough that they could accept her still, as she had tried to accept them despite their views. Instead, she was banished and forbidden to talk to her sisters." Draco shook his head and Harry could see the conflict in his eyes.
"Harry!! Hermione!" came shouts from Neville, Ginny, Luna, Seamus, and Dean as they filed in behind Ron, all bearing armfuls of sweets. Soon laughter filled the cart and the unease from moments before was all but forgotten.
Harry smiled, brightly, filled to the brink with pure love as he took off the headphones and turned to face Draco.
He heard keys jingling outside of the door to his flat but didn't bother to move. Only three people, besides Draco, knew he had this place and only one had a key.
The group stopped talking abruptly and Harry's jaw dropped as Pansy discretely used her wand to point a spotlight at the stage, revealing Draco lounging seductively on its edge. He was still dressed in his perfectly tailored trousers and waistcoat but his hair was down and flowing in angelic waves. An upbeat, poppy melody began to play and Draco cocked his head slyly, a playful smile on his lips as his eyes locked with Harry's.
"Thank you, Molly," Harry said, his cheeks turning a faint shade of pink.
"There!" He pointed to the line of fireplaces across the hall that lead out to the employee entrance. They carefully wound their way through the crowd towards their only way out.
"ONE OF YOU LOT OR YOUR UNGRATEFUL LITTLE DEMON SEEDS MUST BE RESPONSIBLE!" Ollivander was shouting.
reasons.
He sighed and gave up. "Ok, ok, I'm going," he said and stood.
Harry had been wondering that, himself, all morning. Draco had been noticeably absent from drills today and, considering the state of him when he'd left last night, Harry really hoped that he was ok. If he were being honest though, he was really kind of relieved because -- what on Earth are you meant to say to a bloke after you kiss them, yell at them, tuck them in, and they tell you they love you?
"Woah! Draco!"
Draco, have you gone mad?!" she asked, nonplussed and completely losing all pretense of professionalism. "I'm not a miracle worker, you know?!"
"Yea, whatever -- I'll do it," he said absentmindedly, gathering his things in a rush. "Look, I've got to get out of here."
"For your anniversary," she said matter-of-factly.
"Ok, what's the task?" he asked, still a little bemused when Potter released him.
Before he and Harry had even hit the floor, they were surrounded by a shield of Gryffindors (and Luna Lovegood) who all shouted in unison: "
"Only that I fucking
!" he hissed. "You can't absolve me of my crimes! And there is no
"Good. You can swallow now."
"Do I
on repeat back when he had the muggle flat.
Harry blinked back, dumbfounded. It took a moment before his eyes eventually lit up with something akin to hope. Finally, a tiny smirk curled his lips.
Harry had had every intention of following her except, at that very moment, the bulkiest of the dignitaries passed and Harry froze. There, right in front of him, stood the perfect, pristine, beautifully angelic visage of a man who he had all but convinced himself had only ever been a ghost.
"Thank you, madam. Is there anything else? Anything at all you can remember about them?"
Draco twisted his mouth, wryly, in thought. His disguise had been shot to shite back at the ministry by the time they'd made their escape but there had been so much going on that he had no idea if anyone had worked out who Harry Potter's accomplice was, yet.
When Draco witnesses Harry be raped by death eaters the summer before 6th year, all of his convictions are questioned as he steps in to save Harry's life. When they return to Hogwarts after the war, Harry and Draco both struggle to define themselves outside of the roles that everyone expects of them while helping each other heal from their respective traumas.
Draco glared at his smirking paramour.
He shook his head. "My apologies, Potter. I forget that you were raised by muggles and are apparently incapable of reading
"Yeah, yeah, alrigh'. So this Celestina Warbeck fiasco -- apparen'ly the records are being laced with a potion with a..." He looked up and to the side as if trying hard to remember the exact words to recite. "Somethin' about an 'undetectable amount of bulbadox juice and boomslang' and alls you need is a li'l bit of bezoar and bubotuber pus to stabilize the old ninnis."
, but Harry paid it no mind.
was what had caused him, Draco Sodding Malfoy, to ignore every Slytherin instinct for self preservation yelling at him to turn and fight and, instead, hastily discard his precious, trusted Hawthorn wand. He groaned as the facts settled: he was somewhere in the den of the enemy, utterly wandless, and Harry was probably...
"Hey! We missed the gifts?" Ron groaned as he saw Harry and Draco still practically wrestling over their gifts. "Oh, ice cream cones. Is that because after that first field case you two got paired together on you stopped by Fortesque's to celebrate?"
"Draco wavered, conflicted. He had thought his deciding moment in the upcoming war would be whether or not he was actually able to kill Albus Dumbledore. Instead, it now seemed to all come down to whether or not he'd let an injured, addled brain Harry Potter wander off into muggle London alone."
Just as he was deciding to go with something with a
Harry, still slightly shocked, turned to find exhilarated grey eyes blinking back at him through wet, brown hair. They shared twin smirks as renewed hope filled them! They nodded once before pushing forward, Harry casting a mixture of defensive and offensive spells, wandlessly, while Draco covered his back.
but if you are not here within the next 5 minutes then you are disinherited!"
"No, I assure you --
who figured out where Ginny was taken from.
s to count. He started to head to his seat but the open bar in the back of the room was looking awfully inviting and he reasoned that there was no way he was going to make it through the night without a drink. A very
drink.
"It'll calm down, mate," Ron was saying from across the table right before he stuffed his mouth full of bacon. "S'only the sec'nd week."
-- he gets owled a letter, meant for him, laced with the same potion properties from the completely unrelated case when he has the cure right on hand?" He quirked an eyebrow, challengingly.
Something about this didn't seem right to Draco but he had to get away from this place and find mother quickly before anyone could become suspicious. Potter was giving him an easy out here so he searched his blank eyes one more time before saying, "Ok. Take care, Potter."
The still stunned secretary was tied up, neatly, to one of the cushy arm chairs in a rustic drawing room full of brightly embroidered kantha cushions.
"Well, I'll be. To what do I owe this honor?"
He sat up and pushed Draco so that he laid back, Harry crawling atop him so that he could get a better angle. He leaned in for another kiss, instinctively sliding his thigh between Draco's and worshipping the resulting little intake of air and Draco's cock growing against his thigh.
Ron groaned.
"Oh, but of course! Master is hosting it this time and Boply made sure that the drawing room was spotless and made all the favorites! There is treacle tart for Mrs. Fawley, and macaroons for Mr. Greengrass, and sponge cake for Mr. Ollivander --"
"Merlin, Harry..." Draco's voice sounded almost awed as he explored. "Are you living completely muggle?"
tell me you're shagging Potter! Does Blaise know?! He did mention that ever since Narcissa sent out the wedding announcements you've been shagging every Tom, Dick, and..." She looked at Harry suggestively and he rubbed at the back of his neck, mortified.
Draco's eyes went wide and furtively sought out an aghast Lucius who was clearly trying his best
Potter looked a little confused by the line of questioning but shook his head.
She sighed. "Now I've gotta deal with you getting over a broken heart from Draco Fucking Malfoy." She rolled her eyes. "Well, at least I know I've got one thing that he doesn't."
would just not be fair to you, considering the circumstances," he continued, matter-of-factly.
that we were pregnant -- not in our circle, at least. We'd agreed not to until the baby was full term." Harry shook his head. "The fact that you knew at all meant that you could've only found out from one person and, according to Ginny,
Harry looked around for a glass of some sort but was distracted when his eye was caught by a large floor plant surrounded by the glowing haze of a well cast warming charm and situated in front of the vast picture window that took up most of one wall. Birds of Paradise. His heart warmed as a puzzle piece clicked into place that only added to the complexity that was Draco Malfoy. He looked back warmly and shook his head at the man who, somehow, managed to look angelic even though he was completely pissed. Right. Water.
Harry swallowed hard, his mouth suddenly going dry. "Well... I've probably thought about sex more in the past 48 hours than I've ever done in my life and... there's something about the idea of it being with
Lee downed the rest of his eggnog and couldn't help but be filled with mirth as he watched Ron clap Harry on the back and pull him into a one armed hug.
"No, I believe this makes us even," he smirked.
, Potter?"
Draco muttered something about insufferable prats as he hurried to push himself out by his elbows, eager to be far away when the tree thought to come alive again. Hagrid's great boarhound howled from the nearby grounds keeper's inn and Draco paused (once he was out of whomping distance) to look around the grounds. The castle lights twinkled against the dark skyline and the flags from the distant quidditch pitch, waving gently in the early breeze, were just visible from this vantage point. Perhaps he would have basked in the nostalgia of it all were the moment not immediately broken by the magical bindings reacquainting themselves with his wrists.
Blaise raised his thick brow and fought to hold back his smirk. "Are you sure you want to know
Draco smirked and they headed out the door, feeling exhilarated and triumphant.
"Thank you, Draco." She wiped her tears with her sleeves again. "I really needed that and, you're right. I think I will try to celebrate her. It might be hard but maybe some of the other eighth years will do it with me, for support, you know."
His mouth dropped open, incredulously. "Andromeda!"
everything in my power and I just can't do it.
"Oh... I guess, technically, you're not out yet... Sorry, I didn't even really think -- And, Merlin, I guess I sort of outed you to my parents, didn't I?" He frowned.
Walden nodded in agreement. "
, Hermione?" Ron screwed his face up in confusion as he obliviously took the seat between Harry and Draco. "What are you on about? And why are you all standing over there just staring?"
"Fascinating case, indeed. Long have we known that a wand will yield to whomever defeats its master but, Mr. Potter, your ability to master the two wands, at once, when typically only the wand in use is up for grabs proved that the rules are different when the Elder Wand is involved."
She nodded and marched off.
Draco got introduced to Muggle Pop Music in DHSGAHP and discovered he had a surprising affinity for the stuff (pop Divas in particular). Harry burnt him a mixtape as a farewell (it was 2001, people still did that lol).
-- you know how she gets--"
Harry moaned. Draco tested the waters with soft, tentative kisses at first. He had never really believed that Harry's hesitance actually had all that much to do with Ginevra to begin with but, he knew this was still technically
The woman always knew just where to prod!
"From
"Ha! I thought that was you, Potter!" he snarled. "What is it, you perv? Thought you'd follow me home and catch me in a wank?"
"Yes, Ron. I'm fine. I'll be over for dinner at the Burrow on Sunday night," he reassured.
Harry glanced at Draco, nervously.
just a senile old coot, then I suppose I am also to believe that
Draco's eyes widened, momentarily, but then he flashed Harry a crooked smile.
"It's good to see you, too, Kreacher. Look, I need you to find Mundungus Fletcher, again, and bring him to me."
"Draco?" he said without thinking.
Some of them, like Granger looked at him wide eyed in shock or awe for daring to challenge a professor while others, like Longbottom, simply looked somber as they remembered. Weasley might've actually been impressed; but it was Harry who stood out the most. Green eyes stared at him pointedly with what might have been gratitude and Draco was startled when something in his stomach seemed to flutter. That, though, he had to ignore.
And he was ok with that. He
"And no girls have caught your fancy during this
She rolled her eyes. "Draco, why do you think I picked karaoke? I was hoping that if you got sloshed enough you'd let Blondie out."
-- in case you were wondering."
"Ronald, no!" Hermione screeched and tried to come between them.
Draco blinked up at the big red and white circle above a flight of descending stairs that bore the words "Underground" and "Public Subway."
Blaise Zabini," he said as he gathered his searched bag and left the poor boy gawking bemusedly in his wake.
Blaise looked around with Ginny at his side, making sure to touch anything that looked like he shouldn't touch it, just giddy to finally be let in. Meanwhile, the Greengrasses sat on the sofa next to Hermione, both looking thoroughly put off by all the Gryffindors.
Knowing what was at stake, Harry had chosen the path that would not end with the man that he loved also losing his family.
He raised an incredulous brow. "So? What's wrong with that?"
"Yea yea." He rolled his eyes. "But really, mate -- sex requires a lot of communication and being able to read each other for it to work right. Take me and Hermione, for instance..."
Covetous eyes followed them in their wake and Draco became acutely aware of the fact that he didn't have use of his wand hand. He could kick himself for agreeing to something so ludicrous! Apparently, Potter noticed him stiffen because he briefly placed a reassuring hand on his back. Was he normally this touchy-feely?
Ah! This has me on the edge of MY seat. **bites nails**
Draco's face softened as comprehension dawned. Harry's eyes were drawn to the way he worried his lip, conflicted. Finally, Draco took a big step back and opened the door wide to let Harry in.
Draco sighed as he pulled out what appeared to be an impervioused document with the Ministry of Magic ledger, front and center, from an inside robe pocket. He placed it in front of Harry, who raked over it quickly.
"Wow, you really are a wealth of knowledge," he said in a low, distracted voice.
"Harry, what in the bloody fuck is going on?!"
"You ok?" he asked as he planted a kiss in Harry's soft, black hair. He reached for his wand and Harry felt the stickiness between them disappear.
Potter smirked and quirked up an eyebrow. "What happened to that new leaf, Malfoy?" Draco put down his book and scowled. "Ok, ok." He raised his hands in surrender. "I need to study for potions. Slughorn keeps suggesting that I take extra lessons," he said as he started to unpack his bag and pulled out a quill and his copy of
"Stori?!
become overly curious about the lot of them as of late... And, come to think of it... all of the drunken conversations about Harry had almost always been started by Sebastian...
"Well then, you know that I haven't always been loved?" Draco stared deeply into Harry's eyes and caressed his face with the back of his fingers, hoping to convey all the love
he thought as the superpowered killing curses blindly richocheted off of Harry's shields with loud, thundering crashes that shook the room! Draco felt his chest rise and fall rapidly as he watched Harry be forced to be on the defensive.
Draco laughed, "Ok, I may have gone a
need that visual." Harry shivered and shook his head briskly. Hermione's jaw hit the ground when she realized her mistake.
It shouldn't have been possible... Then, again, it shouldn't have been possible for Harry to cast that Patronus from his wand either, especially without even holding on to the thing.
Hermione rolled her eyes for the umpteenth time and Harry was beginning to wonder at what point might they get stuck like that.
"Now, mind you that, at the time, Lee had had the biggest crush on Angelina for years and Fred had just taken her to the Yule Ball the previous year so I had been pining for my love, secretly." He smiled warmly at Angelina who beamed back. "I hadn't even told Fred! So at that point I'm red faced and flustered and apparently the only one aware of the fact that she's a few seats down and bound to hear this! I try to deny it and Fred's all like:
It always amazed Draco how sincere and accepting kids could be.
Draco nearly lost his balance as they landed erratically in an alley that he didn't recognize. There was smoke coming from the vents of a nearby restaurant and the distinct smell of grease from a fryer.
Harry wasn't feeling well that Saturday morning. Surprisingly, he'd actually slept last night. In fact he'd gone to bed early and woken up 12 hours later, just before he was supposed to head down to the Great Hall for the dueling club.
Harry's mouth went dry and he blinked back tears as he thought about his parents, Dumbledore, Cedric, Sirius, Hedwig, Dobby, Fred, Remus, and Tonks... All taken away from him within a blink of an eye. Would it have made a difference if he had been able to say goodbye? If he'd had even a moment to prepare himself for death's possibility?
He probably would've given him a harder time, really, if Draco hadn't looked so great with his pouty, pink lips or had his own heart not started doing the tango at him actually being there.
If you read any of this before 3/27/21, Jansen's name had previously been Jensen when I wrote this the first go round. I'd just thought it was an interesting name, nothing more. But that was before I got into Supernatural as my pandemic show and realized that Jensen Ackles deserved way better for a namesake. Lol I can't even look at the name Jensen without making the association now and so it had the be changed!
"Come off it, mate! It's not like it's everyday you become Head Auror." Ron rolled his eyes though his smug smile betrayed his pride.
He sighed, knowing that Snape would never let him live this down. He looked back towards Harry sleeping peacefully and thought about their conversation and decided that it was worth the wrath of his godfather. He had been on edge and conflicted ever since his father's letter but now, for the first time in a very long time, he felt like he was making the right choice.
! And, all the while, Harry thought he was doing a fairly good job of not letting his wayward thoughts get away from him -- that is, he had been until the point when Draco, fascinated by all the muggle pop dancing, actually stood to follow along with parts of the choreography on the screen. Harry found himself hopelessly captivated by how carefree and joyful Draco looked as he danced, arms thrown wide and hips swaying freely, rhythmically.
He hung his head. There was a long moment of silence.
"We will. As soon you find
Draco watched on as she tenderly crafted the plaits into an intricate, braided crown and then waved her wand so that the rest hung down his back in long, beautiful waves. He clutched his heart.
Draco silently sauntered towards Harry, stopping to hover low over his back, letting his breath ghost over soft skin as he rubbed his hands up the length of his back. Rather than relax, Harry stiffened and Draco smirked, devilishly.
like Blondie? And besides, Blondie doesn't sing. She lip synchs," he huffed, indignantly.
was supposedly not in her life anymore."
and my answer was yes, very, very much."
Draco leaned over and kissed him on his scar. No one had ever done that... Most people were apt to gawk at it but even those who had been close to him always seemed fearful of touching it. It felt sort of symbolic in that moment: Draco being the only one who wanted to touch the trauma, and doing it so gently.
Parvati laughed. "You know, I've heard that Harry is a pretty good baker, muggle style -- maybe I could get him to bake a cake."
Merrywhip looked as if he might press the issue but Draco felt the carefully contained anger that he'd done such a bang-up job of containing all term come to a peak.
"Michael Corner? Merlin, Draco! Have we really dated all the same guys?!"
If Harry had expected his professors to take it easy on them or that there would be a gradual ease into NEWT revisions, then he had been sorely mistaken. With many long nights spent studying facts he was sure he'd never need and cobbling together essay after essay, the next few weeks had flewn by in a whirl and, before Harry knew it, it was the end of October.
Harry frowned as he thumbed through some of the files and came across pictures and article clippings dating back to the war...
is it possible that whenever we're together one of us ends up without a fucking wand?!"
Draco paused and pulled back, eyes wide and questioning.
"Yes!" Granger chimed in. "Well we're working with Penelope Periwinkle to try to do damage control around what happened this morning and reduce public fallout so that Harry and Draco might actually have a shot and Draco might actually be able finally get out from under this scary outcast image enough to actually help others."
"Malfoy!" Ron said as the lift doors opened on the atrium level.
The man looked confused but then winced in pain as Harry somehow made the man curl in on himself.
Draco held his eye. "I didn't know. I decided all of this this morning and officially owled in my resignation this afternoon."
? Why couldn't I just floo?" He rolled his eyes as Harry led him to his second story walk-up.
Draco gasped softly, stunned by his words. "Potter, I --"
"So Harry tells me you really were the secret Santa?" Andromeda broke through the awkwardness. Draco nodded nervously. "Mystery solved. Harry had been going on and on for years, convinced it was you. Now, maybe he'll finally shut up about it."
"You think this is a game?!" Sebastian bellowed. "There is nothing standing between me and my destiny right now and, unless you'd like to end up like my dear old mom and pops, then I suggest you get with the program! Now," he growled. "Take me to the white tomb!"
"I don't know, it made for a fun fantasy."
Draco couldn't help the smile that overtook his face as his stomach filled with something fluttery. If he were alone in his room then, surely, he would've done a proper happy dance but, since he was in public and that was just undignified, he had to settle for a quick, discrete fist pump.
"I'm so sorry, Draco, that I made you think I didn't love you because of who you are or who you love. I've never stopped loving you. I just felt so betrayed and abandoned."
"Thank you, Mr. Borgin, you've been a great help. By the way, how much was this mystery woman paid for these things, anyway?"
He threw the pouch of gold galleons across the table in frustration and left without another word.
"So there were the three muggle boys and... Anyone from here?"
Eventually, his hand replaced his mouth, stroking Draco's shaft with a twisting motion as he let his tongue travel back over his balls and venture lower until he was lapping at the tight, pink ring of muscle at Draco's entrance.
"Unless he'd come for one particular player and then left when he realized that she wasn't showing..." Harry said, gears turning in his head.
Potter narrowed his eyes and crossed his arms.
Harry just stared, deadpanned, at him.
going to be happy that you've doomed her with a lifetime of limp dick."
" he huffed.
"Of course I did... I listen to it every day -- I even got one of those big stereo CD player things so it can play throughout my house and not just in my ears."
George took a moment to bask in the warm and fuzzies before he pulled Ron over to the side.
He buried his head in Harry's chest again and groaned. "But then
Draco sighed. He knew that Blaise and Ginny's story had started at the same time as he and Harry's. The exact same week, in fact. At the time, he hadn't even considered that what the red head and his smoldering friend shared was more than a desperate, convenient shag. Now he routinely wondered how things would have been different had 21-year-old him not been so afraid of what he might lose when there had been so much to gain. Maybe then there would have been two more
"Ouch! Hermione!" He turned to see Ron nursing his arm and Hermione smiling tersely.
"Harry, it's not going to help if you go all mental again! Then Malfoy is going to have to do the mind fuck mambo jumbo thing again and we're back where we started, mate," Ron said before stuffing his mouth, having somehow found Draco's can of biscuits. "We'll look after him."

That dream had felt too real, almost like the ones he'd had back when he was privy to glimpses of Voldemort's mind. Surely, that wouldn't make the slightest bit of sense in this context, but still...
about such a thing and, right now, he believes
"Well then, we need to know what happened on Sunday night; if anything stood out."
Harry rubbed at the back of his neck, sheepishly. "About that. Apparently I'm bisexual. According to Ron and Hermione, I have been for some time." He shrugged.
then you could have it done however the bloody fuck you want!" Blaise shouted back, sweaty and annoyed as he carefully stood on the bed trying to unscrew the chandelier. "Why on earth didn't you pack all this shite up earlier?"
"I assumed you knew." She shrugged and Daphne put a hand on her back.
and some bullshite about people still having
Harry made a choked sound and Draco pulled him close.
"I'll floo the Aussie's and see if they can crosscheck with muggle records!" he said, scrambling to his feet and leaving Draco staring up at him in that endearing,
"What's going on, mate? We got your message to meet you here."

and also ensure that Dumbledore would be the master of his own death and that the legend of the Elder Wand would die with him, and so with it, the destruction, chaos, and greed that has also been known to come with it."
"So, you're a virgin?"
"So that's why I've barely seen you around!" Harry exclaimed.
Harry, you've no idea--" Draco stroked his cock slowly, mouth dry and pupils blown to shite as he took in the sight before him
secrets we'll find if we look a little..." He shook his head gravely. "Now, I would like to avoid that, you see. You've been such a good friend to my family and this community that, perhaps, you would rather just help my partner and I out? Tell us who this thief is and I'm sure we could let you off with a warning."
, and three years of muggle support groups (because there was no way he was going to let the wizarding world know) until he'd gotten a handle on it. He'd finally gotten to a point where he felt comfortable drinking socially again with a strict "one drink" rule and it was never at home but, right now, he really wanted to drink the neck and shoulders off of a bottle of Ogden's.

Harry dodged a curse from the man's wand and Draco flattened against the nearest wall as it ricocheted his way.
"What makes

" he managed to choke out, mouth dry and cock suddenly very interested at the sight of his husband-to-be wearing nothing but an apron and a pair of light pink, lacy, thong knickers.
Draco bit back the litany of swear words that were on his tongue. He turned on his heels only to bump headlong into Potter who reached out a steadying hand to catch Draco before he could fall, a curious sadness in his eyes as he regarded him. Once he'd caught his bearings, the brooding blonde simply huffed and marched off to the other side of the room.
And at that, Malfoy disappeared into Diagon Alley.
"I just need you to help me understand," he continued. "We're having a real hard time understanding just how you went almost two days without noticing that your wife was missing."
"Can we move on, please?" he said, irritably.
"Ehrm..." Harry said, panicking as he realized he hadn't thought about how he'd explain that in the slightest. "Blaise told me? He's in Gryffindor tower!" he added to make it sound more authentic.
"What?! That traitor!" said Astoria.
Harry felt all at once touched and overwhelmed as he looked out at the loved ones gathered around the scenic knoll that was he and Draco's hill. There wasn't room enough for seating, even. Instead, they stood, beaming, shoulder-to-shoulder, each holding a Weasley Wizarding Wheezes Ever Burning Sparkler in hand. It was perfect.
"I love you, Harry. And, of course, if it makes you feel better to wait until this is over then, we'll wait."
"Well you can if you have an illegal portkey connection!
He had turned to his mother who'd looked away with tears in her eyes.
"Wait! You know a muggle? Who studies psychology at Uni? How on earth did that happen?!" he asked, intrigued.
All of this! You are all risking your own reputations but what are you expecting of me in return?! To be this fake, friendly bloke who wears his heart on his sleeve?" he scoffed, angrily. "Harry, I'm not even friends with my own friends! Not really... Blaise and Pansy are the closest but even they get bits and snippets. Everyone sees the parts of me that are necessary, when they are necessary."
"Ooh! Sweetie!" A girl in a tiger striped, hot-pink neon tank top and hot pants was embracing him. "You don't need him anyway! Fuck men!"
Harry's eyes widened to the size of saucers as the simplicity of the words rang deep within his core. "Draco! You're a genius!" he shouted, placing both hands on either side of Draco's face and snogging him, hard.
"Are you... dating anyone then? Just having fun until you get back with girl Weasley? What's your deal?"
Defined as 'Extraordinary or mystical
less flare (but maybe still sparkly), he heard the roar of his fireplace from his sitting room.
"And of you that can, how many were directly taught how to cast it by Potter?" Since everyone in the room besides the Slytherins were members of Dumbledore's Army, they kept their arms raised. "And those who actually had to use it in the Battle at Hogwarts?" No one put their hands down.
to think sexier for the leather and lace display!" Pansy directed a blonde witch with pouty lips. His best friend was dressed to kill in one of her power suits, peering through her angled fingers as she tried to manifest her vision. She waved her wand and one of the mannequins sprouted a disturbingly familiar mop of greasy, black hair. "Think wayward potions master and sexy school girl!"

"I know, it's bizarre! While his dad was a bonafide wizard, descended from a very old, decidedly pureblood family, it looks like dad stopped embracing his own magic when Sebastian was around six-years-old and Krafft Sr.'s magical trail started to go cold. There's even medical records for Sebastian from muggle hospitals for things like a fractured wrist at age eight from playing something called
Draco chuckled but began moving again as Harry pushed back against him.
Sorry, I've no idea how to convey a Bulgarian dialect besides following JK's lead from the books and replace Ws with Vs 😅. Apologies if that reads weird!
He blinked through tears,
"Both. I believe it was definitely both," Harry said before he turned to kiss him, again, and this time let his lips linger, kissing in a slow and deliberate kind of way until he felt Draco's worry melting.
He shook his head, ignoring all of Draco's nervous rambling, and stared confidently into grey eyes before firmly reiterating: "Just. Take me. To him."
"Erhm..." Harry looked away. "Would you like some pajamas?"
"Oh, right. Right on through, sirs."
"Yes. You terrify me, Potter. And I'm afraid you're going to drive me absolutely bloody mental by the time this is over." His voice was soft and he shook his head wearily. "I'm not used to caring about people. Not like this... How do you think you got me to eat greasy cheese on hard bread without protesting?"
Draco pulled the hood of his cloak up against the London night chill and stuck to the shadows of Elderberry Road as he approached the terraced home.
you don't know every damned thing? What's the matter? Not so fucking brave outside of your bloody owl posts?!"
"The whole
"Talk to me, why would you do this?"
Draco still had vivid flashbacks of being wrapped around Harry's body, clinging for life with heat and flame and death licking at his back, knowing that he'd just lost a lifelong friend and that his future was uncertain... and, simultaneously feeling safer than he'd ever felt before... because, deep down, he knew that Harry Potter was good and he could make it alright, even if he didn't deserve it.
He hissed and wove his fingers in her hair, trying to resist the urge to hold her head steady and move his hips to fuck her throat.
Harry frowned and grumbled under his breath, "Yea, well she took you away from me."
"Come on, Draco. I'm sure you'll have fun!" Harry added, traitorously.
"But he... he was waiting for me..." he breathed, eyes wide and pupils blown as he tried to connect the dots.
"What's the matter, Malfoy?
She cleared her throat and he started again. "Shall we, Mr. Potter?"
Harry's heart jumped at the use of his given name but he was more concerned about the lump forming in his throat at the sincerity of the words spoken from the gray-eyed boy. He looked away, mortified, when a strangled noise escaped his throat and his eyes began to burn of their own accord. He hadn't cried through any of this and he was afraid that, if he did, the dam would break and he would drown.
. He exhaled a long breath that he didn't realize he was holding which made Draco laugh harder.
"Yes, Ms. Granger?"
and we're....
"I said '
He fought back the lump forming in his throat and hurriedly stood to put on his shoes.
bloody wanker! "I just need to help give him a fighting chance -- a way to play to his strengths! But I could..." he paused and bit his lip, struggling to get the words out. "I could use some help."
"Really, now, Garrick. Why would any of us steal from one another? These meetings have been going on for 2 centuries and our family ties have kept us all safe through witch hunts, goblin rebellions, and 3 wars--"
She gasped, wide-eyed.
"Harry..."
She simply laughed and made to leave the room.
, Ron. How many times do I have to tell you, just because it happens on the screen does not mean it happened. It's just special fx."
"Alrigh'! Alrigh'! I don' have a name! -- I swear!" he added when Harry looked doubtful. "All I know is it was a bloke with a funny accent. Was with a lady with a different funny accent. Met 'im at a bar in Yorkshire. We got to talking about the unfortunate events -- knew I'd been asking around after you put the call out, see -- an' he told me I needed to tell somebody."
"Hey! That vas antique!" Hristofor groaned, momentarily forgetting his role. Draco watched in shocked horror as Sebastian whipped out his wand in one smooth motion and, with a flash of green light, Hristofor dropped to the floor, motionless.
Decadent smells of chocolate and buttercream filled the air as the house elves brought out an array of sweets that, on any other day, might have delighted Draco's sweet tooth. Instead, he couldn't help but feel queasy at the burgeoning bubble of panic threatening to burst from his chest.
"Well, that was quick," he huffed, reveling in the irony of his last words. He shifted from foot to foot uneasily for a moment. He turned to leave but then turned back to stare after the three. Why should he care? His father's friends were about to turn Potter over to the Dark Lord and he should be jumping for joy because that's what he deserved! ...It was, in fact, the natural order of things, right? He shifted uncomfortably again, his face screwed up in thought. Potter was another one of those stubborn idiots who seemed incapable of just lying down and getting out of the Dark Lord's way so who cared if he'd probably die? And so what if he was barely 16 and Draco had known him for 5 years and he was Draco's favorite person to hate? He deserved what he got, right?
"Well that's the thing, isn't it?" asked Hermione. "People expect you to be fake. The objective is for you to try to
"Are you sure?" Draco leaned in so that his forehead was resting on Potter's, his lips so close that all Harry had to do was lean in just a bit more...
"Can I have a second pie chart?"
"Today, has been lovely, Gin," he said as he led her inside and they waited for the hostess. "I have a good feeling about tonight."
required the conduit of a wand.
Just as Draco was thinking that he really liked this girl, that gruff voice that always grated on Draco's last nerve broke through the murmurs of the room.
Harry moved to the middle of the bed and did as instructed, resting his head on his forearms. Draco moved behind him, leaving him feeling incredibly exposed with his arse up in the air. Long moments went by without anything happening and Harry's face flamed when he looked back to see Draco studying him, reverently.
His panic eased as he noticed the jumper, trousers, and school robes laid out on the chair and a tray with toast, eggs, sausage and fruit spread out on the coffee table.
Draco rolled his eyes. Ugh, he was
10 minutes passed with still no sign of Harry. Kamal came over and sat the basket of fish and chips in front of him.
"But he's expecting that you will?"
"Potter..." he said, experimentally.
It had been blatantly obvious to Draco that it had been an invitation for Harry and Harry alone, but of course the self-righteous git had taken it upon himself to invite Draco along, too.
to Harry!
"You're fine. You're good," he said, forcing a smile onto his face until it started to look somewhat natural. "You're fine."
Draco was surprised when all eyes turned to him.
Harry lifted his feet onto the couch and shifted to mirror Draco. He let his legs outstretch just enough that their feet touched, hoping that the contact might be as reassuring for him as it had been for himself. Draco lifted his head at the touch and continued.
!" Ron yelped as Hermione hit him with a carefully aimed whack of this morning's Daily Prophet.
Yes, Draco let Harry pick the name of his brainchild ;-)
He was forced from his thoughts when a very distinct
Finally, he rolled his eyes. "Hermione, I've dated Ginny! I had a crush on Cho! Remember?!" he said indignantly, trying and failing to keep his voice even.
"I'm not sure, but I may never be able to dye my hair now even if I wanted to." He laughed, too.
Hopeful green eyes stared into beady blue ones that were gradually turning grey!
"Thanks, Hermione," he said, kissing her on the top of the head.
"Oh, this is going to be fun," smirked Blaise as he wrapped an arm around Ginny's waist and they began to walk. Harry walked so that he was on the right of Blaise. Hermione was next to him with Draco, Ron, and the girls close behind.
He sighed then threw on a robe and followed the sound of the annoyed, panicked voice.
"I'm very glad to see that you took my advice, Harry."
"Are you ok, Harry? Draco?" Hermione asked, her brow worried.
he groaned.
He pulled Draco to his feet and then his arms were around his neck and Draco's soft lips found his.
decided to take his slow, sweet time getting ready." She rolled her eyes at Ron.
"Well I expect the bond to fix that." She shrugged.
"Sure they can," Andromeda chimed in. "Sometimes, when you like someone in a
"Then why else would he be so insistent on owning The Wand?" Harry asked, baffled.
"I don't know if it's the Christmas spirit or the smell of unrequited love in the air, but it's giving me the warm and fuzzies. Do you feel the love, mate?" he practically sung.
He rubbed a thumb gently across Harry's bottom lip and Harry's breath caught.
"Is something wrong, mate?"
more sob story --" Draco stopped his pacing and strode directly in front of Anavi, wandhand twitching at his side. "Answer me this: Did you start feeling like a poor, mistreated damsel before or after you started getting dicked down by Sebastian Krafft?"
Robards turned to him, questioningly, as the lift continued its descent.
"Relax, love. You underestimate them. Trust me, it will be fine. After all you did to help bring Ginny home, there's no way they would just cast you out or something."
"Well,
"Patience," he said as he cast the lubrication spell.
Harry bit his tongue. He wanted to point out that of course he had meant to put him on the spot, that's what everyone seemed inclined to do. Instead, he simply said: "It's ok, professor, really."
"You don't look so good, sweetie," she said, placing a hand on his shoulder when he doubled over against the counter, now flushed and sweaty.
Draco shivered and arched into the touch. "Well... I suppose you could thank her yourself. Later tonight."
Harry cringed and shook his head fervently. Talking about sex with Hermione was just
still no where near solved. Something had shifted between last night and now, however... Maybe trust that he wouldn't leave? Regardless, it made him wonder... Harry hesitated for the merest of moments before he opened up for Draco, letting his wet tongue slide, sweetly against his.
"Are you ok, Harry?" Draco asked, his calm voice laced with amusement.
"We wouldn't even have to have it here if my future in-laws were not liars and thieves," he said, turning his gaze to Astoria, Daphne, and their mother off in the distance as they excitedly oversaw the decorations. He closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose in frustration. To make up for the Greengrass' lack of funds and the sheer madness of the time crunch, his parents had decided to just host the wedding, here, at the manor. "Isn't that case enough for me not to have to go through with this?" He argued.
Harry blushed but leaned in to breath into his ear, all hot and throaty like. "I don't know, Draco, the way the colors reflected off of the cock flushed against your abs was pretty beautiful. Magnificent even.
That being said, the second part of this chapter is all explicit smut with some dom/sub undertones (or overtones, depending on how you view it). It's also filthy because, with this being so plot heavy, there's been so little sex in it at all it's almost like I had to make up for it? Lol idk, anyways: Enjoy! Or, you know, feel free to skip if you need to cause lol um...
Draco narrowed his eyes at the interruption but continued. "Yes, like Lockhart. Muggles, on the other hand, have studied the human mind and the affects of experiences and trauma on the human psyche for centuries. Wizards haven't really explored how to translate muggle psychology to the experiences of witches and wizards. I'm sure that if we better understood the science," he said, lifting up his book from the coffee table which Harry only now noticed was titled The Neuropsychology of PTSD. "We could combine magic with some of their empirically proven muggle methods for healing to create a completely revolutionary form of mind healing."
Ron shrugged. "I have no clue what you're talking about," he said, innocently, but George thought he distinctly heard his little brother whisper something suspiciously along the lines of "
Draco joined him at his side and watched as the gold dust spiraled into the air to take the shape of Ginevra running off, gingerly, heading east. They walked over to the bigger ones and the dust formed into two familiar, hulking forms.
"Draco, hunny!" he called out as he slid down next to him. Draco was sobbing, uncontrollably, as Harry pulled him into his lap. "I'm ok! Hunny, are you ok?"
The thought of having to work under that prick, Potter, had driven him mad but, then, the bizarre turn of events from earlier that week had given him hope! Oh, it was lovely! Potter couldn't very well lead if he were locked up in Azkaban.
"Seriously?? How did I wind up on a movie set?! I must've been pissed last night!" He laughed. "You're right, I think it's time I gave up the sauce. -- What are they shooting anyways?"
a hell of a title!"
"Sod off!" he groaned.
"Hey! You're that mean guy!" Some drunk girl in a neon pink catsuit blocked his path and pointed a finger at his chest. "Leave him alone!"
He was distracted when Malfoy stumbled into the room, followed by the Greengrass sisters. Harry narrowed his eyes; if he didn't know any better, he'd say that they'd just pushed him through the doors of the great hall. Malfoy had been painfully absent from meals this past week and it had been weird; while Harry would never admit it, part of the experience of eating in the Great Hall had always meant that he could always count on Malfoy to be there for them to glare at each other -- it was a part of their routine! But whispers filled the hall and Harry watched as the same heads that had looked to him in adoration now turned toward Malfoy in disdain. Draco quickly straightened his back and walked purposely toward the end of the Slytherin table where he was joined by the Greengrasses and Blaise Zabini. He kept his unbothered Malfoy-mask carefully in place as he poured himself a cup of tea. Then Harry watched on, bewildered, as Luna Lovegood, of all people, skipped right up to Malfoy at the Slytherin table and started a conversation! Malfoy looked just as confused as he felt but then Luna handed him some type of necklace and Malfoy flashed her a warm, unguarded smile.
"Instantly!" Neville smiled proudly.
"But there was one abnormality he couldn't really make sense of..."
He hugged himself and then Harry was there, wrapping him up in what Draco mentally called a Harry cocoon (though he would never tell
"I didn't realize you were looking for me," he said with a smirk and Harry felt his cheeks warm. "What made you come looking for me tonight?" he asked, nodding at the map.
"Settle down! Settle down! This afternoon's test will consist of an actual field assignment." There were gasps and Draco perked up. This is what he'd been waiting for! A time to shine in the real world!
"Should we find a bed?" he asked, breathlessly.
Potter broke apart and ran his fingers through his hair in frustration, threatening to dislodge his bun.
Harry shrugged. "I'm guessing it has something to do with whatever Ollivander was on about."
Harry scrunched his face up, bemused when he pulled away. "
Harry took a deep breath. The world seemed to pause. Seemed to get smaller. Narrowing in until there was no one else, nothing else, besides them, in that moment.
(See the end of the chapter for
He was left speechless, however, when Draco dropped down to one knee and, waiving his wand, summoned the chain from over Harry's head.
"Crikey! Isn't that that hero bloke? Your former boyfriend partner?"
Potter was backed up against the wall next to the grand staircase, his arms thrown in front of his face defensively as Granger tried to get a good look at him to cast another spell. Finnigan and Thomas tried to keep the crowd from getting too close while Weasley and Longbottom looked on worriedly. Luna Lovegood was dancing and waving her wand through the air, presumably trying to rid the air of Wrackspurts or the likes. Flitwick was giving orders for someone to get madam Pomfrey and Merrywhip just stood there helplessly. The scene was complete chaos!
I don't know that I fully expected it either, Grizel. I think I had given up on myself much as everyone else had. I'm just lucky that someone believed in me and was also willing to give me a good kick in the arse to remind me not to stop trying.
Her eyes lit up and she bounced up and down on her toes.
"Draco --" Harry started to say but Ron had already stood up slowly and closed the gap between him and Draco, ignoring the wand as he pulled him into a one armed hug. Draco stood there confused and speechless, his arms now awkwardly squashed against his sides and making no attempt to hug Ron back. There was snickering as the girls poked their heads around the tapestry.
"Tonight? Not Tuesday? Draco--" he said, warningly, mind finally coming out of its lust driven haze enough to catch on. "Out with it! What are you buttering me up for?"
Draco wrapped his arms around his neck and pulled him closer as he came down. He felt a flood of emotion as Draco peppered soft kisses in his hair and he was wrapped in a blanket of hushed words of reassurance.
Jansen smiled smugly to himself as he walked into his favorite coffee shop and joined the queue. He was just fantasizing about handing Harry over to the dementors when he was stirred from his thoughts by an annoyed brunette barista.
"Shite!"
"Now it's like the bloke has just vanished, racked off to Merlin knows where."
Harry's cheeks turned a shade pinker. He raised his knees to his chest and hugged them. "....Yes. I mean...." He bowed his head and stared at his knees. "What happened 6th year didn't count. I'm not even... gay... I mean..." He gestured listlessly with his hands.
to blame for that Howler!" He shot a wry look towards Blaise, who had the good grace to look sheepish.
"Draco, is Potter right? Has the bond made you feel different? Ooh! Are you even still gay?!" Her eyes went wide with wonder as she peered up over the note. "Quick, when you think of post Hogwarts Neville Longbottom, does he do it for you?"
"Don't they?" Andromeda chimed in with mirth in her eyes.
"You have nightmares, too?"
"None of this happened," he repeated, straightening his back and his eyes going weirdly void. "You didn't help me, I didn't see you, and I'm fine because nothing happened. Let's never speak of this again."
Distracted by the opulence of the grand drawing room Draco had just apparated them to, Harry didn't immediately grasp exactly what had caused Draco's reaction. He jumped and reached for his absent wand, however, when he turned to find Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy staring at them, completely flabbergasted, from where they were sat around the fire.
Anger flooded through him as he stopped at the line of sinks. He grasped hard at one of the the porcelain basins, his knuckles turning white as he glared back at the pathetic reflection in the mirror.
"And what are they even on about? Wand? Who would do all of this for a confiscated
Draco's jaw dropped as he stepped into the small flat, wide-eyes scouring the sitting room full of cheap IKEA furniture and bright, electric overhead lights.
"Why do you even still get that rag, mate? You've hardly even been to England in half a decade."
They really would have probably pushed through it all had the unthinkable not happened.
"Ok, class. Settle down, settle down!" called Professor Merrywhip. The sandy-haired wizard was relatively young, he couldn't have been more than 10 years out of Hogwarts himself. He knew the theory well enough but his posh navy blue robes and generally jubilant demeanor made it clear that hadn't been touched by either of the wars. Draco wondered how long he would last here, DADA curse broken or not.
Madam Pomfrey had worked her magic and he was feeling fine now but, of course, she was insisting that he stay until she was sure the concussion had been fully healed.
He did it again and Harry mewled as cock stroked against prostate. Harry wrapped his legs tighter around Draco's hips and moved to match him.
"Let me make sure I'm getting this correctly: We get a new, big shot head Auror and along comes a new, big, unsolvable potions case. Funnily enough, he's somehow the only one who knows the secret contents and cure of said potion that could set him up as the media hero only one week in -- and doesn't even mention it." Harry paled as he followed the prat's line of thought. "But then his trophy wife asks for a divorce and conveniently gets
Draco shook his head again. "No, Ron's right." Harry smiled at him funny. "What?"
"Draco!!!" he called out as he set off down the halls, wand clutched tightly and cursing the fact that this new house was so bloody big!
hurt Harry Potter.
Harry laughed. He felt grateful that his friend was being so accepting. Harry really hadn't known what to expect. The Dursleys viewed queer folks as just as strange and ungodly as they did magic and he'd barely even heard mention of bent couples in his time in the wizarding world except for the whispered rumors about Dumbledore. Knowing that Seamus and Dean weren't out as a couple and that Draco had remained in the closet despite the fact that he clearly had known that he was gay at least through most of his adolescence told him that it still probably wasn't considered
"Ok, back to the drawing board."
actually changed his hair into the short, mousy brown mop of curls that it was supposed to because, really, it was a bit of a die roll. Draco hadn't thought much of it when he flummoxed his wedding vows by sneakily reciting the line
He huffed. Now
"No, Harry. In ten years, I have never
"Yea, I know!" He flashed that toothy grin. "Did it help?"
"What? You think I'm bent?!" His jaw dropped. Did his best mate think he was bent?! And for how long?!
"Is he ok now? What just happened?"
"I thought you were gone! I thought you didn't make it!"
He hurried towards the lifts feeling far too grateful for something to do.
"Yep, I wonder how many of them are going to get stuck in there this year?" he said, gleefully, and Hermione clucked her disappointment. "C'mon, Hermione! It's a right of passage that at least three get stuck. That prick Jansen was in there for 3 days during his first training week." He chuckled. They were always alright -- for the most part. He nodded at her work. "How's the fight against pureblood laws going?"
"Do those items mean anything to you?" chimed in Potter. "We're trying to find a connection."
He slid to the floor and cried out, anguished.
Harry gasped as his half-hard cock connected with Draco's. He started to pull away but Draco kept him close.
"Stupid, stubborn, prideful gits," Ron mumbled, finally breaking the silence as he took out his wand and transfigured some holly into a poor excuse of a mistletoe and floated it inbetween his best mate and his former enemy. "Are you two going to get over yourselves and snog or what?"
"What does it matter, Potter? It's too late." He shrugged, deftly walking backwards towards the brick wall.
Her eyebrows threatened to disappear into the fringe of red locks still wild and frizzy from morning bedhead. She smiled back wanly and he thought he saw a faint twinge of guilt.

Then he heard the distinct voice of Davenport. "He did something to Harry! The death eater must've imperiused him! Get him!"
"You can take him back to where you found him and then return to Hogwarts. Thank you, Kreacher. Oh, and give Winky and Headmistress McGonagall my regards."
Draco laughed a light, melodic laugh and then kissed away his pout.
"Is that what you've had to tell yourself to help you sleep at night?"
Draco smiled, victorious. "Ok, Potter. Just hurry it up!"

Draco groaned into his hands. He had told his so-called
"Yes, so I've heard," she said, brusquely. Was she angry that he was getting married or that he hadn't told her himself? He couldn't tell. He had thought she wouldn't have wanted to know. He hadn't worried about father. Now that the sensationalized rescue of Ginny Weasley and the upcoming nuptials to Harry had Draco painted as Britain's new, gay darling, he'd undoubtedly collected every
Harry followed his gaze to find Savage walking past the display window and, by the looks of it, following
Draco smiled ruefully.
"Mr. Malfoy, sir --" she said, composing herself behind her desk.
"Ronald! Shhh!"
"Sorry, old friend, I'm actually here on business," he said, peering around the bar at the plethora of disreputable looking patrons until his eyes finally landed on the shadiest of the bunch: a man in a corner both whose face was wrapped in bandages like a mummy (or a Stepford wife after a go at plastic surgery).
Harry and Draco exchanged incredulous looks before Harry was being ushered out the door and Pansy closed it with a snap behind him.
What he did want? He still didn't know exactly -- at least not when he thought about Bubblykicks' question:
Harry did feel like he melted every time Draco's tongue touched him so maybe he was on to something. It took a few more firm but gentle thrusts until Draco was fully buried in him. Harry held his breath, afraid to move.
Draco laughed. "Quite the contrary, Blaise -- he actually keeps me quite hard," he countered with a smirk, feeling triumphant when Blaise's mouth fell open, indignantly.

He hadn't made it halfway down the corridor before he was shoved into a dark classroom.
about? He'd have to worry about it later.
"I promise I'll watch your back, Malfoy. Pinky swear." Draco screwed up his face in confusion as Potter lifted his pinky and then held it out for him. He rolled his eyes at Draco's resistance. "It's a muggle thing."
Draco nodded. "Excuse my language, but, I just can't keep being a part of something shitty anymore just because it's expected of me. It's not the life I want to live," he said solemnly. Harry heard Ron scoff from the other side of Hermione, clearly not convinced.
felt ashen. He was pretty sure his heart stopped beating altogether and he had no hope for it ever resuming as he numbly lifted his eyes from the spot to see Astoria's jaw on the ground and mother staring at him stoically. He blinked at them dumbly; speechless.
"Oh, this is for real for real," Blaise said appraisingly.
Sebastian's cheeks turned beet red and Draco refused to turn away or flinch when the bat raised and reared back, mightily, before barreling towards him!
He turned slowly towards the owl who was now watching him, keenly.
Harry got up and hastily pursued Weasley out of the office. When he'd gone, Draco felt his mask slip into irritation. How dare Weasley be such a selfish prick when Harry had enough to worry about. He thought to himself that he frankly didn't care if Weasley didn't like him because he'd probably never like him either, but he'd at least planned to pretend for Harry...

Harry, sensing the changing tide, walked backwards to the suspiciously still Whomping Willow and hovered with his hand above the bark. He raised a brow in challenge.
After eight years, Harry Potter's existence still managed to annoy him more than a bad case of spattergroit -- now, his annoyance was just for very different reasons than when they were younger.

When Draco witnesses Harry be raped by death eaters the summer before 6th year, all of his convictions are questioned as he steps in to save Harry's life. When they return to Hogwarts after the war, Harry and Draco both struggle to define themselves outside of the roles that everyone expects of them while helping each other heal from their respective traumas.
"Is that a telly vision?" Draco cocked his head, fascinated as Harry turned on the 30 inch television tube with the remote and turned the channel to MTV.
"Of course there was only one plausible reason why she would have run to Blaise Zabini first, of all people, or why you might send me flowers when she
Harry sighed, shoulders sinking. "Nothing, I'm just glad you're here. And safe."
Draco handed Harry his wand and went to sit on the one sofa that hadn't been upturned. He placed his face in his hands.

The room filled with laughter and Harry found himself filled with so much joy he was sure he could cast the brightest
Harry's heart beat rapidly as he watched pale, slender fingers work deftly to remove the ring and, suddenly, he'd forgotten how to breath. He saw himself reflected back in silver eyes that shone with such sincerity, as if he were the most precious thing they'd ever laid sights on.
"I love you more, Harry."
"Watch your back, Malfoy," he threatened as he walked out the room.
"So there's someone else involved." Harry swallowed.
"Bloody hell, Malfoy! Are you insane or do you have a death wish?!" Leave it to Weasley to forget to hate him when he was impressed by something. Draco smirked and decided to take what he could get.

big?"
"You'll find out soon enough! Can we go now?"
Draco felt so torn in the situation. His deepest concern was for Harry, of course. He knew he was bound to be hurt in all of it but was it his place, as the bloke who'd hurt him and likely led to him being in the situation in the first place, to break it to him? And as much as he wanted to shout his friend down and call out that she devil, he knew it was complicated.
"Beg your pardon?"
here either.
Robards nodded solemnly. "Their records show that Zabini traveled alone."
She sighed and hesitated for a moment that felt like ages.
"Oh, every day. Not just about surviving but keeping those I loved safe. And I think the scariest part was when I got captured and I was sure it was all over and thought I had failed them all."
She quirked an eyebrow with some effort.
He was starting to understand Harry's fervor about not losing him because Merlin forbid something happen, Draco would be

"Well, it's fine whenever all those brats aren't overrunning the place on their Hogsmead visits. I miss the days when the ambiance of the place scared them off but ever since the battle, I can't get rid of 'em," he griped but Harry had a feeling he was secretly proud. "Fancy a firewhiskey?"
"And no need to worry about the press, mate. We kept the portkey destination undisclosed so not even that bug, Rita Skeeter, can pop up unannounced," Ron added as Rose toddled, playfully, around his feet.

A faint blush touched her cheeks. "I don't know, Harry. I just get the sense that whatever happened between you two all those years ago was bigger than you let on and I wouldn't want to create a bridge if it would make you uncomfortable."
What Draco appreciated, Harry did not know because they were interrupted by the sound of someone coming up the front steps.
He watched Harry play with the cuff of his jeans. "Did it work?"
Draco grinned, slyly, knowing that he'd thank him later if he could actually make him cum this way, solely from prostate stimulation, and, Draco loved a challenge...
"What we talked about! You know, about you needing to find a boyfriend to play with? Harry's really fun so I'm sure he'll play a lot of fun games with you!"
"Well, afterwards, we went to this bar -- that had these amazing cheesy chicken nachos -- and we wound up getting so sloshed that we couldn't apparate home so we stayed at
Draco pulled back and pushed his shoulder so that he was forced to look at him again. He searched his eyes for a moment. "What are you trying to ask, Harry?"
"Yes, 10 points for Ravenclaw." She nodded, her head girl status ensuring that Stephanie got her points.
Draco's expression softened. He crossed the room and cupped Harry's face in his hand, warm grey eyes imploring green. "Harry, please don't do whatever stupid, half-cocked thing you're about to do. He isn't worth it."

Draco wanted to flip him the bird but figured that wouldn't win him any points with the kids and he realized, with some annoyance, that he did actually
He reached inside of his cloak and handed her his ID with the Elderberry address where, for all intents and purposes where the ministry was concerned, was his place of residence.

there's no hope for her unless we do this."
Yes, I slipped "entanglements" in there. Sorry, I couldn't resist that little teeny tiny bit of 2020 Quarantine humor 😂
"Wow, Malfoy, you sure know how to give a compliment." Harry rolled his eyes but smiled wryly. "I haven't mastered it, per se. I've always been able to do it in an accidental sort of way when emotions were high. Not being raised in the wizarding world, I just assumed that it all fell under typical accidental magic that little kids experienced. After the war..." He looked at Draco sideways as if contemplating if this were something he really wanted to share. "Let's just say I was not well after the war... I was a mess. And losing control in every possible sense of the word..."
"Well, I think anyone who knows you knows that that's bollocks. You're one of the bravest men I know and that's partly because you're willing to love bravely. I trust you because, for someone who hasn't always been able to fight for himself, you're continuously willing to put

He instinctively reached for the chain that he kept hidden beneath his collar but his hand dropped abruptly when he realize the direction of his thoughts. He shook his head.
"So," Ron said as they walked past a group of dumbfounded Ravenclaws. "The Chudley Cannons or Puddlemere United this year?"
Harry looked nervous. "No, professor. I'd really rather not."
Harry felt his cheeks heat up and he chuckled.

"Malfoy?!" he shouted, looking around the room.
"YOU'RE SHAGGING POTTER?!" she screeched.
"Andromeda was my favorite sister." A flicker of pain flashed in her eyes at the admittance but she continued. "We were closer in age than Bellatrix and I but she still prided me as her baby sister. She was always kinder and gentler. Bella would kill for me but Andy would let me cry on her shoulder or crawl into her bed at night when I had a nightmare, well into our teens." She smiled sadly.
Draco opened his eyes to find Harry smiling sweetly from the doorway to the hospital wing. He smiled back from his bed and shrugged.
Draco had asked to top their first time purely for selfish reasons but he kind of got the sense that Harry had enjoyed not having to be the one in control for once in his life. He hoped that he knew that it didn't have to be the case if it made him uncomfortable.
"Hello, son," Narcissa said at last.

That's it, Harry," Draco got out as he began to melt and rock against Harry's tongue. "Oh, you're so fucking good for me, my darling." Harry mewled at the praise and then pushed his tongue inside, graciously stretching Draco's inner walls and surreptitiously kissing and sucking at his puckered rim.
"Correct! Shield, disarm, and stun. 10 points to Ravenclaw!" he said, belatedly looking to Hermione with wide eyes as he realized that he didn't even think he had the power to give house points.
Draco smiled wryly and shrugged.
Draco nudged him with an elbow and pointed to where Jansen stood, smirking, a few houses down.

"Face it, Chopra: you're only here right now because Sebastian thinks of you as a weak, easily manipulated pissant. He's right, of course." She flinched at his words.

It wasn't until the second time that the snogging turned into frotting that Draco finally pulled away breathless.
"Draco... What if they don't make it? How am I supposed to live with myself? Knowing that while I should have been worried about her making it home, I was off having sex in an airport massage parlor?" He rolled his eyes.
She gasped. "Oh, no! I couldn't!" she said shaking her head vigorously.
suspect! They aren't looking for anyone else! They've already stopped looking for her, and, a part of me really hates to say it, but Harry Potter is probably the best Auror of our time." He shook his head as they looked at him with stunned, incredulous faces as they processed words they'd never expected to hear out of the Slytherin prince's mouth. "Whoever pulled off such an intricate frame job is a bloody genius and Ginevra doesn't stand a chance without him. And neither does Harry if he doesn't get the chance to clear his name."
reflect well on me."
time... insisted that the odds were low... But still...
Draco smiled back at him, sweetly, and took a moment to gaze into Harry's eyes. His were dark with lust but Harry also saw something softer and warm reflected back at him in the pools of silver-grey.
"Today, sir? A same day portkey is going to be --"
before they stepped in.
Gratefully, when he reached the door, it unlocked and opened before him. It was odd, he had been struggling to get the hang of this whole wandless thing for months but, ever since he'd been around Draco, it'd been flowing out of him left and right.
hold on to after that. Simple.
now?" Ron asked through a mouthful of French pastries.
"Oh no, Harry! I was coming to tell you -- Well, we wanted you to be the first to know..."
Ollivander turned wide, fervent eyes to Draco who took a cautious step back, instinctively guarding his wand with his injured hand.
"So it's not the crime that Ollivander couldn't talk about but the connection?"
Harry forced himself not to run, trying hard to keep a cool head.
Draco shook his head and stood. "
"What in the bloody hell is the matter with you, you prick?!" yelled the busboy as security made their way over, blocking his path.
"Oh, DRACO!" he cried out.
"So the black market... Ok everyone, now would be the time to reach out to your CIs and let them know to be on the lookout for any movement of Celestina Warbeck records! Time to catch this guy before anyone else gets hurt -- or worse..." he added soberly to murmurs of agreement as people gathered their things and prepared to disperse for the day to track down leads and wrap up existing cases.
The first man pulled out a tiny box from his trouser pocket and pointed his wand so that it unshrunk to reveal an evidence box. He removed the lid to display a strange collection of books, files, and what appeared to be obscure potions ingredients -- some roots and twigs that he should probably send to Neville. Harry cocked his head as his eyes were drawn to a beat up old book that looked like it hadn't been touched in many years though its well worn spine suggested that it had once been a staple: "
"Come on, Malfoy." Harry ignored his grumbling and grabbed his arm again, this time leading him onto what seemed to be a busy muggle street. Draco was immediately put off by the loud sounds of the muggles hustling about in their bizarre clothing and on their telemaphones and in their automobiles.
Harry chewed on this. Draco was right, it didn't add up. Of course he knew that Krafft was a half-blood but, then again, so was Tom Riddle. Maybe he just had a horrible case of mummy issues...
"Tough nut, love," he chuckled. "You know, it's really nice to be able to do that. Kiss you. In public," he clarified in answer to Draco's raised brow as he bent to slip on his shoes.
Harry was only half listening at this point. He stared off into the distance, deep in thought until--
life away?
"Oh no -- whoever this prick is used you, hurt Ginny, and is actively trying to tear my life apart. I'm livid," he said, pulling Draco closer and planting a kiss in his hairline. "But at least now we
Harry rolled his eyes and tried to tamp down his rising anger.
Harry stared back into burning grey eyes and took in the enormity of what was being offered. Draco thought he might lose his family and his inheritance and the respect that his name still brought him in plenty of high class circles -- all of which, had meant the entire world to Draco...
so guarded -- the freedom giving him permission to be his sassy self without having to mask it in a layer of meanness that disguised the queerness... A world where he had friends and community that actually understood those parts of him and embraced them... A world where maybe he could have Harry Potter by his side as soon as he figured out that he was most definitely bent...
Could he really go through with this? Two weeks ago, he would have been perfectly content to play house with Astoria. The thought of them trading snide remarks in a New York penthouse while trying to figure out how to raise a small child like some sort of cliche American sitcom was not a bad one. But that was because he had never considered more... But now that he knew more existed?
"What in the fuck did you just say?" His voice was soft and wispy, his throat too dry and his heart having stopped beating in his chest, altogether, only to take up residence in his ears.
The door swung open as someone exited behind him and he caught glimpse of a shock of white-blonde hair still visible where he'd left Draco standing on the dance floor just a moment ago.

Harry held Robards wand tightly, not at all sure if it would work for him since he hadn't won it and in no mood to find out.
"When she actually did it... Oh, I could hardly believe it! I ran out after her as soon as I could. She had waited and she was crying but she smiled because she was finally going to be free, you know?" Harry winced and Draco frowned at his big, dumb friend. "Sorry, mate... I meant free from the lying, and the cheating, and the disrespect that she hated just as much as you did, Potter --I swear she did! She hated hurting you but she was just so afraid that she would hurt you worse by telling you the truth..."
"Oh, no -- there's no turning down
Ever since then, Harry had learned to wrap his feelings up around that particular heartbreak in a neat little ball and throw them somewhere in the recesses of a deep, dark, mental cupboard. His former mind healer didn't approve much of that plan at the time, insisting that it wasn't healthy to repress feelings like that. There might've been something to that because he hadn't been able to do wandless magic from then on out. It was all just too painful to think about and so, instead, he had done what he always did: turned to work. And Ginny was there...
