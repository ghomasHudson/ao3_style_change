When Harry returned to his body, he stared listlessly at the diary in his hands, thoughts whirling around, emotions a tangled, knotted mess.  He noticed that Tom had written something, but he couldn’t focus his eyes on the words.  Harry inhaled sharply and then read what Tom had written.
Then it was his turn, and he ambled over to Professor Black. He smelled the potion and told the class that he smelled, “Green apples, dark chocolate, masala chai, ink, and vomit.”
The Minister just watched all the reactions with an impassive face, uncaring of the effect he had on the students until he got to the short Ravenclaw he was especially interested in.  He would have to figure out who that was.  His intrigue tripled when his magic brushed up against another’s magic: dove grey mixed with a bright, almost unnatural lavender and extraordinarily powerful.  Without another thought, he let his magic envelop the other mass.
The next morning Harry yawned and stretched, ready to start the day.  Michael was already up, but Terry was the furthest thing from a morning person, and it would take quite a few charms and creative techniques perfected over the years to wake him up.  It sounded like Michael had taken on the “waking up Terry in the morning” task, so Harry cast
Harry woke up just before midday, groggily stretching his stiff limbs and massaging his aching palms.  His makeup had mostly rubbed off, but pigment lingered under his eyes, and so when he staggered to the bathroom, he splashed his face with water and a palm magic
And the Minister was going to have him.  He never thought of taking a male in that way, but Harry was just so deliciously powerful.  Or maybe he could have the boy as his heir.  Anyway, who said it had to be one or the other.  The boy was delightful, and the Minister would have to duel him again sometime.  Too bad DADA was a lecture today, though it was fun watching his prey act all studious as if he wasn’t the most powerful being in the whole Hecate-damned room and could kill them all in a mere blink.  Oh, the Minister was going to enjoy this chase.
The spell he used was an ancient one, known to Ravenclaws exclusively, and could be used to find Rowena Ravenclaw’s relics within a certain distance (though nobody knew precisely what distance it was). Harry let out an elated yelp when he felt a tug towards further in the room, and he all but sprinted to the diadem. Then he laid his eyes on the half-crown, and oh
The rest of the day passed in a blur (from finishing up lunch to gossiping in Arithmancy with Pansy and Marietta while doing hieroglyphic hextangles to practically screaming at Sue about whether names or intent was more important in spell crafting).  Soon enough, he was sitting in his bed, the curtains drawn, quill in hand, staring at the black journal in front of him.  It took him a good seven minutes to gather up the courage, but eventually, he wrote out a simple:
He had to push that all to the side when people badgered him for answers -- not that he gave them any -- but he still had to turn them away and smile secretively.  Thank Mother Magic and Morgana that class was in five minutes, so he used that as an excuse to all but sprint to his Charms class.  Charms class was a welcome respite from the uproar at breakfast as Professor Flitwick would not have anything disrupt learning.  The previous class had been a lecture, so now it was time for the practical.
The house-elves, bless them, brought up food and water during lunchtime, as they were accustomed to Ravenclaws elbow-deep in research, and knew that nothing could make them leave before they were done. Dinner, though, was a different story, and the house-elves gave them an hour's warning to wrap up before unceremoniously kicking them all out, to the amusement of the 1st years who had never seen anything like that before.
Harry canted, almost shouting, and the shade greedily absorbed the Ayin runes but shrieked when it drank the hyacinth tears too. It tried to stop, but Harry just chanted louder, letting his magic flow through the basalt, forcing the shade to absorb the tears. Harry knew his face was damp with sweat and tears from exertion, and the screams and wails the shade emitted were horrendous, but Harry compartmentalized and renewed his focus on the ritual.
Wow was this chapter a doozy! Here is some info I think might be helpful if you didn't quite get it all, but just ask for any clarifications :D
"They seem shorter this year, don't you think?" Harry joked.  Knowing he towered over them satisfied him, given that he was the shortest boy in their year and two years below.
When he returned with all the ingredients, Hermione smiled in thanks, and they began to make the potion. Hermione poured a liter of Standard Potioning Water in their silver cauldron and turned on a hot flame.
Then came the tricky part, every 4 minutes -- exactly -- they had to stir 16 times clockwise and add a whole terrafire lizard that had been only fed may bells. Once they did that, their potion was thick and matte black and ready for the last step. Hermione took her mother-of-pearl dagger and slit her fingertip, squeezing four drops of blood into the potion. It swirled, and its matte color turned shiny and iridescent, like the oil spills Hermione had seen in pictures.
doesn’t require a specific wand motion to cast a corporeal spell or mist, but to cast a shield, and you move it down and up in a U shape three times.”
O-okay, that was weird.  Harry decided to ignore the usually composed man who was currently angrily stabbing his eggs and sausages with a dark sort of glee--what had gotten the man so worked up that he was like this?  Harry was not the only one to have noticed; he should be worried about his public image.  People were sure to write home about that.  Oh, and whatever last night was.  That reminded him that he had to write to Uncle Moony and Uncle Sirius.  Harry made a mental note of that and started listening to Luna explaining what heliopaths are to Cho, in a very roundabout and musical way that annoyed the straightforward and no-nonsense Cho.  He snorted and joined Luna’s side, lightheartedly teasing Cho.
Professor Black smiled encouragingly but stiffened when the temperature dropped, and Minister Peverell calmly asked, in an eerie way, “Pray tell, what is this bad experience?”
“But should you not play to your strengths?  And if you aren’t skilled enough with transfiguration, then you’d just make a fool of yourself and waste energy, but if you are, then that’s an advantage.” Marietta said in a placating way that only served to further the debate (which was her intention).
With Father not speaking and Cousin Rhodesia not budging on her stance, breakfast quickly ended, and Harry went outside to the horses.  He had thrown a cloak on over his robes, and combined with the sun; he was pleasantly warm.  There were only two horses: a bay mare named Turnip, which Harry had named when he was quite little, and a dappled mare named Chand.  Acorn happily greeted Harry and led him to Turnip, saddling her for a ride.
Eventually, everyone’s chatter and small talk from all around the plaza died down with the unveiling of the platform where the seemingly omnipresent minister resided.  Despite his best effort, Harry zoned out during the Minister's speech, and when he refocused, the Head Unspeakable (denoted by their elegant lilac-lace veil) was on the podium.
Nobody knew what happened to her other than that her family, three months later, received her jarred uterus and a note that read
“We have been invited to the annual bonfire and rites this year, as well as the Black family rites, in addition to the--” James paused and swallowed, “Our familial rites.”
Of course, he was impressed with the grades (O’s in everything except for an EE in Runes, which was well known as the most challenging subject at Hogwarts).  He had also aced his OWLS and was looking at a very promising future.  But there was nothing speaking of his magical prowess, nothing of what he was like.  Nothing at all.
and the forms his friends and classmates had.  He transferred the knowledge of the forms to each of the books on each person he knew, and the facts on
The other time was much, much more terrifying. In 3rd Year, there had been a student in their 7th Year -- a creep named Vivian Penmark -- who had drugged Draco with Amortentia. Harry and Hermione had discovered them in a very, very compromising and very, very illegal position. Draco told Hermione once, late at night, that while she was vomiting, Harry had looked at Vivian dead in the eyes and cocked his head.
Harry slid on ivory slippers, which would be burned later -- it was a shame, given how comfortable they were.
“Students, since we have 25 minutes left, we’re going to do a little exercise on what we smell in Amarenovis, since, as Ms. Brown stated at the beginning of the class, it smells like Amortentia with an undercurrent of your least favorite smell. It is prudent to know what Amortentia is like, and this is the safest way to learn all of its characteristics. Now! Who wants to go first?”
As soon as Harry wrote the last exclamation mark, his consciousness was sucked into the diary and he was next to Tom, watching the memory.  It was Tom, alone in what Harry assumed was the Wishing Room (for that was what the snakes called it) in sepia tones.  The memory had an intense look on his face as he called out, “
Harry wiped sweat off his forehead and melted into the floor.  Well, he actually hid with a spell Aaron Woodbridge (one of his fellow 7th year Ravenclaws) created that made it look like he dissolved and turned him invisible.  The Minister and the class were shocked, and that opening was enough time for Harry to cast
An Unspeakable cloaked from head to toe in white linen, with only a mesh window for the eyes, walked up to them and spoke with a clearly altered voice, “Blessed Samhain.”
Despite Minister Peverell’s best attempts, the old houses were dying, and their family magic weakening.  The war and subsequent punishment of light families left most houses with one or two surviving members (or none, in the case of the Prewetts and Selwyns).  Families were forced to blood adopt or marry mundane-borns to keep the name alive, but it was really no use.
"Is everyone ready?" Lisa asked, and once she got a nod or a verbal response from every first year, she began to walk out the Ravenclaw exit towards their tower.  Michael started telling jokes, trying to relieve the tension, and soon he had everyone giggling, or at the very least amused.  Harry laughed as he walked out of the hall, not noticing the crimson eyes that followed him with a predatory gaze. The Minister wanted--no
Harry had not, actually, gained weight since the summer, but the comment stung in that sort of muted way, not cleaving straight to his heart but poking at his defenses, analyzing where he’d crumble.  Still, it hurt, and he pasted over a smile that turned into a genuine one when he heard the tinny voice of Topsy, the ancient seamstress elf.  She was withered and wrinkled, both from her actual age and then from the lack of magic in the air.  Three generations ago, Potter Manor was a bustling home full of life, but now its magic was weakened, reputation dashed, and home all but decrepit.
The students quieted down immediately and waited with bated breath to hear what the Headmaster had to say.  Many were startled by his announcement, especially Harry and his friends.
At dinner, while eating the beef stew, rice, and fried plantains, Harry thought of his week, and it was quite the week. This was not how he expected his 7th year to go, but oh well, at least it was interesting. Pushing all thoughts of the Minister and the past week away, Harry tuned back into the conversation bouncing between his year mates and joined in the light-hearted teasing, joking, debates, and storytelling.
” and cast a clumsy honey bear that clambered over towards Susan’s osprey and began to interact with it playfully.  The class looked on with awe and doubled down and continued to cast their charms.
The Minister’s face paled dramatically and quickly hissed back, “I didn’t know you were a Parsssselmage.”
When the last student scurried out of the room, the Minister roared, and his magic lashed out, destroying the room in an explosion of inky black and coppery reds.  It was different hearing of the abuse from Severus, but to see it?  The Minister was apoplectic.  How DARE that man hurt him.  Harry was HIS to hurt.  To break his bones and char his flesh, till nothing remained but that gorgeous, gorgeous power.  And that despicable man would pay for hurting his Harry.  And that Hecate-damned mudblood and Malfoy heir.  Harry was HIS, not theirs.  His magic swirled around, only contained by the protective ward Hogwarts had for her students.
A basket of threads of every color floated up to him, and when he peered behind the positively massive basket, he saw Topsy and nodded in greeting.  She could barely speak with how little magic James had fed her, so, as she began to measure Harry, he siphoned off a little bit of magic and looked on satisfied as she gained a little pep in her step and began to steadily chatter throughout the process of robesmaking.
That sentiment was echoed by at least six other 7th years, but Harry made up his mind and turned around, making direct eye contact with the Minister.  He shouldn’t have done that, and he should have looked away as soon as he felt probing at his mental walls, but before he knew it, there was a second presence tearing through his mind.
He continued, “I have set up partners for you based on your skill in charms from last year, but think of this as a pre-assessment.  Stand with your partner in a space in the room when I call your name.  Padma Patil and Ron Weasley, Lavender Brown and Millicent Bulstrode…”
He left the class feeling very unsatisfied, so throughout lunch, he brainstormed with Pavarti and came up with his final idea: Alchemy and its applications to limb regeneration.  It wasn’t his best idea, but it was interesting and would pose a big challenge, so Harry was pretty happy with it.  He was also happy with his vegetable stew and the baguette he snatched up from the Slytherin table while passing on gossip to Pansy.
The Headmaster said, in a blasé tone that belied his true feelings, “The Minister has decided that, for the rest of the days of the week, he will be observing several classes to better learn about the students.  A schedule of his observation is in front of each student, so peruse that to your heart’s content.”
He shook off that thought path and refocused on the cooling blood in the bowl. Harry took a breath and steadily poured the blood on the chalk runes and anchor points. Blood smeared on the Teth rune, so Harry waved a hand, and it was back to picture-perfect. He continued pouring the blood till he drained the bowl of its last dregs and could stand back and look at his work with satisfaction. Oh, how Moony would be proud of him. Harry sighed before getting back to work. He summoned the vial of hyacinth tears and poured them in the Ayin runes, careful not to get it on the blood. Finally, he was done setting up, and it was time for him to proceed with the actual ritual.
Ron and Harry exchanged a look, and it was that sort of look that told they shared something Draco wasn’t a part of. Weasley blushed, unable to stop it and Harry shifted weirdly under Draco’s scrutinising gaze.
Draco had been missing Potter all day while he was away at work and he hadn’t expected him to show up at Draco’s doorstep with Weasley at all. It was infuriating, and Draco would need a whole bottle of wine after this to wind down.
Draco had instead reluctantly accepted and then emptied his glass while throwing Ron defiant looks over the rim the entire time. Ron had glared back, insisting that it was the only way he could think of that would make Draco relax and stop to have random, annoying freak-outs, and claim that Harry was dead. Without using magic, that was.
He really didn’t want to learn the stupid bloody computer or how the emailing program worked. Learning that meant accepting that they just had two days together before he wouldn’t be able to see Harry for several weeks. Draco couldn’t have that.
“He’s at work, probably busy raiding a cursed house or something. And besides, Malfoy, you’ve left him probably close to five hundred messages. Or more. Calm down.”
that Potter had brought to his apartment along with the stupid tall ginger Draco secretly wanted to smack in the head.
"I would've come here anyway," Weasley hurriedly continued, now glancing at Harry, "But then you wrote me, and I sorta decided to play along with that." He shrugged. "I couldn't straight up tell you, could I? Harry would've murdered me for ruining the surprise."
Harry only had eyes for what was happening in front of him. Was only hearing what was in front of him.
"Thanks for everything Ron," Harry said, and Ron gave a small nod before he bent down to pet Ozzy one last time. The cat seemed to really enjoy his cuddles, which made Draco scowl. Why couldn't he leave his cat alone?! Harry and Draco were still on the floor, and it wasn't until they heard Ron leave that they looked at each other again.
“Because of Potter!” Draco hissed, fighting hard to keep all his emotions contained, not let anything show. He stopped mid-pacing, shooting Weasley a poisonous glare. “
"Good, you're awake," Harry said excitedly, flopping down heavily next to Draco on the bed. "I made you an email account. So now I have one, and you have one, and I thought we could practice emailing each other today." He was beaming with happiness. It was adorable and annoying at the same time.
Blaise reluctantly concedes, falling into the chair with only half of his usual grace. He casts a quick glance over the ledger on the table and winces. ‘Do you ever wish we were born to different families?’ he asks, looking up at Draco.
Blaise’s shoes click deafeningly against the wooden floorboards as he paces. Kingsley stands up from his desk, heading to the bar at the back of his study. He pours himself two fingers of golden liquor, downing it almost instantly, his throat clicking audibly.
They lie together in the small, cramped bed with their foreheads touching, their hands clasped tight. There is a sweet stillness to the air around them, as though magic itself is holding its breath just to give the two some long-awaited peace.
Harry wonders how Malfoy’s been hiding this. He’s been watching Malfoy obsessively since before term started, but he’s never noticed -
Harry pushes up Draco’s sleeve and unflinchingly presses his thumb against the Mark, never once breaking eye-contact. His magic feels like a thunderstorm in the best way, piercing through the ugly, nausea-inducing pain of the Mark. His is like the sting of spices and the atmosphere crack of electrocuted air.
Draco’s stomach plummets down past his polished shoes, digging resolutely towards the centre of the earth.
Guy nods. ‘We also made black boxes four our clients to use - devices to record all spells cast in the vicinity. The more information we gathered with the black boxes, the better our products became.’
Auror Smythe comes to a complete stop in front of Harry. He lifts his wand and points it directly at Harry’s chest. Draco gasps in Harry’s ear at the blatant threat, but Harry’s spent enough years having curses flung at his head. He stares steadily at Smythe, keeping himself placed solidly in front of Draco just in case the young Auror gets any funny ideas.
But even if he was brave enough to say the words, to admit his long-hidden love, his decade of yearning - even then he does not know how to encapsulate the great universal workings that bind the two of them together, stronger than any deep magic that Harry has ever known.
Hermione was already waiting for him (like she always was), but Draco was still in his dorm, probably styling his hair (like he always was).  Harry and Hermione waited for him, though, like good friends, and not 10 minutes later, he was out of his room, a little breathless, like he fought someone for mirror rights (he had).  Anthony, his roommate, was just as vain as he was, and they constantly battled for the vanity.  It was a strange situation, but they had lived together for seven years, so they made it work and refused to switch rooms or add another mirror.
The plaza was decorated with all sorts of lanterns and flowers, garlands of marigolds and carnations and white roses floating through the air.  Dripping candles drifted about, contained in clear bubble charms.  The sunset saturated Moonlight Plaza, making it and all the people glow with a hazy, orangey sheen.
Being back in his own bed (and next to Tom’s soothing magic) had done Harry wonders, and by the time morning came around, he was well-rested and in a decent mood.  He was beyond grateful that today was his self-study day so that he could catch up on his classwork after the debacle and recovery of the past two days.
Harry did not react outwardly other than a narrowing of his eyes as he shoved all his (icy, frigid, so cold it burned) anger behind his Occlumency shields. Hermione led him to their assigned table and waited for Professor Black to start class.
Also, would this fic be classified as a political fic? Those are my favorite to be honest, and I feel like this sort of qualifies, but ehhh.  (I'm thinking of writing one anyway, once this wraps up, since I already have Better Than Tinder and That One Time...)
and two unknown curses.  His eyes widened.  The Minister must be getting very angry to cast such curses verbally.  A glance at the class and Professor Flitwick showed that they were all as worried as he was (though he didn’t show it as much, and he quickly compartmentalized it).
and his eyes widened at the late (or early hour).  He’d be lucky to get four hours of sleep!  Oh well, he thought, before crawling back under the covers and falling into a deep, relaxed sleep.
His waxing on of Lily was cut short when the group stood at the dining room entrance, and the dining ritual began. First, James entered as the host, and then Harry followed as the heir. Cousin Rhodesia, as the last blood-relative, entered the room, and Sirius and finally Remus trailed in.  They stood at their seats, and a ring of magic, they all sat down.  First, a simple soup was served; butternut squash -- Lily’s favorite.  Then followed course after course of small meals, legumes, meats, grains, berries, squashes, and dairies made appearances, and with each one, the best part was set aside onto a massive golden platter in the center of the table.
The dinner was scattered with meaningless chatter: how was school, how is Little Cousin Aquila, what are some recent projects you’ve taken on, any new legislation?  It was mind-numbing and dull, though only made that way with James’ presence.  He refused to talk of anything but Lily.
“Mother Magic and Morgana Harry, you have no idea how terrified we were when Padma, Cho, and Susan told us what happened in Charms,”  Hermione said, her hands cupping Harry’s face.
The leaves and trees were colorful and wild, all fire and sunshine, on the cusp of change and death.  Harry meandered down the grimy cobblestone path till he stopped at the imposing cherry wood doors.  Harry fixed his hair, and without his influence, the doors swung open to reveal James.
James continued for quite some time, ignoring how everyone was quite uncomfortable with how he talked about Lily.  It was this strange sort of immortalization and worship that didn’t align with how any real person should be treated.  He idolized her and placed her on an untouchable pedestal after her death, and it was near impossible to deal with.  No one wanted to speak ill of the dead, but Lily was by no means a perfect person.
“I ssssmell green applessss becaussssse of Draco, dark chocolate becausssse of Uncle Moony, massssala chai becausssse it’sss ssssoothing, ink becausssse of Hermione, and vomit becausssse of Jamessss.”
Draco smiled, the corners of his eyes crinkling, and they chattered absentmindedly, blessing the flowers for each other and tossing them into the fire.  Eventually, the sound of a tuning violin tore them apart, and Draco apologetically went back to his family.  As the orchestra (if it could be called that -- it was really just a handful of Unspeakables who specialized in musical magic) tuned, Harry and the rest of the plaza cast cooling charms and fire-resistant charms all over their bodies in preparation for the dancing.
Harry woke up the next morning, feeling not right.  He couldn’t pinpoint exactly what he felt, but his skin was crawling, and it was a little hard to breathe. Stretching his limbs, he tried to get his mind off of the strange, oppressive cloud fogging up everything.  Harry groaned as he remembered they had Potions today.  He tiredly rubbed his eyes till white-hot dots swam, and he felt a little more in control.  He sighed, and then again.  Thankfully Michael and Terry were already up and more worried about getting themselves ready -- small mercies.  Harry headed down to breakfast with Draco and Hermione, waving away their concern, instead, focusing on eating his grits and sugar (a very delicious breakfast a Hufflepuff, Aquila Yates, who was a transfer from Ilvermorny, taught him).  He also focused on clearing his mind and on the new debate: whether agrimony or hawthorn was better in blood-replenishing potions.
He left his ruminating behind in time to change back into his day robes and head up to his room to begin getting ready for the dinner party and subsequent mourning rites.  Harry entered the bathroom and drew himself a bath -- Billa, the handmaiden house-elf, would be with James, so Harry would get himself ready.  Harry scrubbed his skin raw and rinsed his hair, one, two, three times.  Afterward, he drained the bathtub and dried himself off completely.  He sat, naked, at the vanity and manicured his nails, eyebrows, facial hair, and body hair till he was as close to perfection one could get.  Kohl lined his eyes and filled in his brows, vermillion powder dusted his eyelids and cheeks, and cake mascara lengthened his lashes into near-impossible lengths.  Pigmented oils were scrubbed unto his skin to cast a shimmery glow and gave his lips an imperceptible shine.  With a flick and swish of his wand, his Potter robes were wrapped on him, and after a few unnecessary de-wrinkling charms, he was ready to go.
The Minister’s magic screeched in anger, and the lights flickered back on as he reabsorbed his core.  That brat.  He was going to have him.  He was going to.
At that last statement, Harry grabbed his stuff and Hermione’s hand and dragged her out of the Potion’s classroom, leaving a stunned group of students behind. The Minister took a deep breath and swept out of the room, going straight to his office; he did, after all, make a promise. Harry groaned and ran a hand through his hair, making it stand up almost vertically as Hermione patted his arm sympathetically. It wasn’t common knowledge that he was a Parselmage, but it wasn’t like he would receive negative backlash. Harry was more worried that all of his Merlin-be-damned secrets would get out before he finished his NEWTS.
That got him a sharp elbow in the ribcage from Draco, who hissed, “Don’t be cheeky; he could be listening.”
and waited till his water was at 99 C º and then carefully measured out a third of the purpura brassica into the water and stirred three times counterclockwise, three seconds between each turn.  He repeated those steps methodically and precisely till all the purpura brassica was in the potion.
After dragging himself through his morning routine and picking at his scrambled eggs, Harry tried desperately to get away from his friends. They
It was clear, though, that he was speaking right to Harry.  They looked at each other, and Susan looked at him sympathetically.  They nodded their understanding, and the Minister’s smirk widened.
“Ah right, you gave statements,” the Minister said, distractedly, still leafing through his mental file.
Cousin Rhodesia attempted to start another conversation, “Neither of you have been to the annual ritual, are you excited to go?”
” Professor Escrivá stated, rapping a knuckle on the blackboard, “Now, Mr. Finnegan, why are you learning this spell here, not in Charms class?”
He shouldn’t have been surprised, he thought, resigned, by the unnatural shadows in the far left corner of the classroom, but he was, and Harry was very, very angry. Harry didn’t get angry often, but there was something about the Minister’s single-minded obsession with him that made icy cold rage fill his veins. This was the man responsible for his fucked up home life and James’ depression (Harry knew that James was an adult, yes, but the Minister shouldered some modicum of blame), and this was the man who slaughtered his mother.
“Thank you, Mr. Malfoy, take three points.  For this class, you will practice the spell with a partner or partners of your choice.  To cast, you must think of what makes you happiest, not just happy.  By the end of class today, you should be able to cast the mist for an A, the shield for an EE, and a corporeal

The last touch he had to make was putting on his stag mask, but it would obscure his vision just enough to be annoying, so Harry withheld from fixing it onto his head, instead, staring at his reflection.
Damnit!  Draco won the bet, and by his smirks, he was enjoying the win.  But he didn’t recognize the name.  Was she the first muggle-born Slytherin in 10 years?  By the mutinous looks of some of the older students, she was, but the girl took it in stride, walking confidently, with near-perfect posture and a perfect mask.
After that class was DADA, where Professor Escrivá lectured on decapitation spells and their counterspells.  It was really quite interesting, even though there were very few real-world applications for decapitation spells; much too messy and uncontrollable.  She demonstrated a particularly gruesome one right before class ended, so the group of students left for lunch more than a little queasy.
Innovation was the name of the game, and the winner from the end of the year fair received 1,500 ⅁ . Throughout the event, hundreds of Ministry officials from all different departments scouted for new ideas and promising candidates. It was a marvelous opportunity, and Harry had his eyes on one department specifically: the Department of Mysteries.
he slit his palms and squeezed so that the blood dripped into the bowl in a steady stream. Harry winced at the burn and then the aggravation of his wound, but he ground his molars and continued till he had filled the bowl half-way. After, he let his magic wash over the wounds, mending, stitching, cleaning, and seeping into the air. It was imperative to imbue magic into the ritual room as it hadn’t been used since he discovered it in the middle of his fifth year, and as everyone knows, rituals harness latent magic.
Harry was glad he was towards the end of the class, and it was likely he would finish and be able to get a head start on his homework, but he was getting ahead of himself, so he focused back on his potion, and as the
Harry snarled, “I don’t see how that is any of your business,” putting emphasis on each word, enunciating crisply, anger sharp and cutting.
Harry shoved himself out of his mind-space back into his body and nodded, mumbling, “I really don’t want to do it, Professor.”
"Ohh darling," Harry cooed while plucking her out of the water, not caring that she was covered in foam and pulled her close to his chest. "Don't cry, baby! Daddy's very sorry." he kept talking as he petted her back, swaying her side to side.
Thinking of such rubbish, he took a turn left to exit the dark empty hallway when he was suddenly pulled backwards with a hand on his elbow. The next thing he knew, he was being shoved roughly against the stone cold walls and being pinned there with two very strong hands at each side of his head.
"I'm afraid they are too flashy for my taste," Harry said good naturedly, before continuing in earnest "They are beautiful, though. You did really go —"
He heard the faint sound of water running while he kept talking to Olivia, quickly getting her out of her clothes and wrapping her with a towel so she doesn’t feel cold.
"Not talking to me then?" Draco spoke in his airy tone while making himself comfortable on the stool beside him. And Harry wanted to scream at him. Scream and flinch away because he had no right to sit this close to him anymore. He had no right to drive Harry
reality! You lived through a war, for fucks sake! You can't seriously think —" Draco groaned, "Reality wasn’t you doing a job that practically had no end and coming home looking
Harry had done just that back then, didn’t he? He had picked himself right up, piece by piece and he had glued himself back together. All because of a boy with a crooked smile and hair that made the moon look faint.
"Above average now am I?" he asked, mock offended while holding Olivia, "listen to that Olive, your dad thinks I'm
"Look at what you did, love!" Harry cooed at her while carefully keeping his face away, and the little traitor made another hearty gurgle in return. "You made daddy wet!" he continued, enjoying the unimpressed look Draco sent him.
were dying. Our love, it was killing us and I couldn’t let it go on anymore. I loved you too much to watch you
He shot Draco an alarming look, and in return the blond ran a hand through his foamed up hair once more, clearly feeling as distressed as Harry.
Draco turned out to be a very difficult and impatient student, and Harry scolded himself for not realising how it was going to be. Of course, he was, he was Draco and apparently all sorts of dramatic. It wasn't that he didn't understand; he was just unwilling, it seemed like. Very unwilling.
"Sorry I scared you," Harry mumbled a bit sheepishly into Draco's hair. "Just wanted…just thought it would be a nice surprise to wake up to. In my defence, it looked a lot cuter in my head."
Weasley has always been the easiest one to crack. Draco decided to ignore Harry, who opened and closed his mouth uselessly and went straight for Weasley instead. Draco's intense gaze could make anyone budge if he just stared at them long enough. His eyes were stormy grey. No one could resist that.
“About Potter,” Draco continued, almost smugly because he’d been right. “Tell me, Weasley, what the hell is going on?”
Harry already had an email account too, because of course, he had. He logged in to show Draco how it worked before they started on creating his account. Draco frowned at the name of the address: lightningbolt80(a)mail(dot)com.
"Only if we send some emails to Potter; I'm not done expressing my frustration with him," he said, and Weasley nodded again as if to agree.
If anybody had been there when Ron Weasley arrived at Draco's apartment two hours ago, they would have been witnesses to a very panic-stricken Draco Malfoy who couldn't let go of the thought that Harry was dead. He was driving Ron slowly but surely insane. Not that Ron didn't understand why Draco reacted like this, but the truth was, the redhead was in a predicament of his own, and he couldn't tell Draco Malfoy that. So he needed to be very creative, but it wasn't easy with how dramatic Draco was.
And when Draco saw who it was, he flew over them faster than his mind could take in the situation, tossing his wand aside in the fall. Anger surged through his body, eyes unseeing as he slapped his target over and over in the face shouting on top of his lungs.
but he had been working when he'd replied too, and that had never been a problem. But now, it had been quiet for a while, for too many days for Draco's liking. Potter hadn't given him any reason as to why Draco's inbox was so empty either, and if he was busy, he should have let Draco know. That was only reasonable. That's what anybody with a brain would do.
Ron snorted. “Nah, wouldn’t do any good.” He got to his feet; Ozzy jumped gracefully off his lap. “Hermione’s working late today,” he said, stretching out his long body. “D’you have any Firewhiskey here? I reckon you need something to calm yourself. You’re all twitchy.”
“Hermione and me both,” Harry confirmed with a smile. Then he turned to Draco. “You emailed Ron? I’m impressed.” He looked like he wanted to say
Then he surprised Harry by taking out his wand from the pocket of his robes, and for a split second, Harry thought Draco would hex him, and it would just be so typical now when he didn’t have the energy to fight back.
A few moments of stillness passed. Then, Draco lifted his head, heat returning in his stormy grey eyes as he demanded answers to a billion questions all at once.
to do the impossible and break the sacred Malfoy code. Technically, he had already done that by being in a relationship with Potter anyway. Lucius couldn’t judge him more if he tried.
“That’s a lot of words for you to say, isn’t it, Weasley?” Draco arched an eyebrow and pulled back to sit down on his chair again. He folded his arms over his chest. All of this was rather suspicious and he sure as hell wanted to know why. It wasn’t normal for Weasley to
loudly, but failed. He heard Hermione call his name, horrified, but he could barely hear it. Several pairs of eyes turned their way, including Draco’s stormy grey, and Harry forced himself to look down. He was bleeding, and not so little, between his forefinger and thumb on his left hand. Lost in thought, he had cut himself, and badly too.
Not that he was ever going to admit such thing aloud. He was Draco Lucius Malfoy and liked to believe he had some pride. Admitting to ones weaknesses didn’t belong in such pride.
Draco narrowed his eyes at that and threatened to put his fist up Harry's arse if he didn't shut up. Harry didn't want that, but he realised to get Draco to co-operate, he needed some sort of outside force.
“To solve the mystery,” Draco answered simply, pressing his lips together. He still had his arms crossed over his chest as he started to pace back and forth across the dining room floor.
“I dunno! How many times should I have to tell you?!” Ron said, sounding helpless. “You wanted me to come; you said you needed my help. I thought it had something to do with the computer and I didn’t get why you didn’t ask Hermione; by the way, she told me to ask you about—”
“You’d still have to go to the hospital wing,” Draco said once he was done. He pocketed his wand, and uncharacteristically offered his hand for Harry to stand up. Harry thought for a brief second that Malfoy was kidding, but he helped Harry up like he just hadn’t healed his wound in the dungeons and actually been nice.
"Anyway," Weasley continued, "You press down on these keys here, and letters show at the screen. Better than any owl, and a hell of a lot faster. It's not so bad. You'll get the hang of it, I'm sure…"
Draco reluctantly sat up and began unscrewing the top of the vial slowly, pretending it was difficult to open when it really wasn't. He didn't answer right away. Harry watched, waiting patiently as Draco put the vial to his mouth and drank a good amount, feeling the power of the potion work its magic almost immediately. He almost felt sorry for Muggles who didn't have hangover potions as options the day after drinking too much wine, how awful their headaches must be.
Draco hadn’t heard from Harry in several days. He didn’t like it one bit. Potter was the one who wanted to email him, why wasn’t he glued to his computer answering everything?
Also, special thank you to the person in the Drarry: Fanfiction and fanart group on Facebook who came up with Draco's email address!
Snape’s eyes went from Harry to Draco and back to Harry again before he said: “It seems that Mr Malfoy is offering to accompany you to the hospital wing, Mr Potter. How very…
“You’re bleeding onto the floor,” Draco commented, walking up to Harry who now had sunk to the ground. Draco stopped in front of him, and when Harry opened his eyes and looked up, he saw Draco leaning over him, almost invading Harry’s personal space. “Bet it hurts a lot.”
“Well, you do spend an awful lot of time here,” Draco said, his mouth turning up at the corners. He turned his head, giving his unmade bed a look. “And you do sleep an awful lot in my bed.”
"Fun," Draco said sarcastically, forcing the corners of his mouth to twist upwards into the tiniest of smiles. Harry didn't listen; he was already opening up another tab in the browser with the help of another little device to Draco's right. Draco had his right hand resting on the table, and Harry accidentally brushed his fingers against Draco's as he moved what was apparently called a
It was an eerie smile, and Harry was petrified.  With a shaky voice, he asked, “W-what are the rules of this d-duel?”
Standing in the open room filled Harry with a sense of wonder, but he had no time to spare, so he quickly opened up his satchel and took out white chalk. On the stone floor, he drew a heptagon, straight lines crisscrossing all the way through, continually referencing the diagram and instructions Tom had written in the diary. After setting up the general shape, he summoned the basalt, letting his magic permeate the air. Harry took the basalt and meticulously sprinkled it over the pre-drawn lines. He dared not breathe as he evenly distributed it all and only did so when he had completely finished, taking a steep breath and inhaling harshly.
Harry approached the tangle of emotions and pulled at a dark blue thread.  Betrayal.  Harry straightened it out and laid it down before pulling the next ones apart.  An olive green exhaustion, a mustard yellow confusion, a crimson red hurt, and a greyish purple irritation.  He untangled it all and held each thread, letting the emotion wash over him, before walking over to a magnificent loom with a stunning tapestry being woven right before his mind’s eye.  Harry wound the individual threads onto their same-color spools and stepped back, watching the tapestry evolve right before his eyes.
Throughout the ritual, the Minister couldn’t help but feel the Potter boy’s irresistible magic, and oh, what a good heir he would make.  He was a Ravenclaw, to be sure, but a good Heir Slytherin he would make.  All the Minister had to do was wait.  All he had to do was wait.
Soon enough, though, he succumbed to sleep, and he slept till the next morning, unaware of what the future held for him.
Also, Tom's magic was totally sexually harassing/assaulting the students.  Like chill dude ever heard of boundaries...?
Halfway through class, everyone had managed to cast the mist, and Harry, Draco, Hermione, Cho, Susan, Lavender, Blaise, Hannah, Greengrass, Nott, Weasley, Dunbar, and Jones had all managed to cast a shield.
Hello lovely readers!! I hope you had a wonderful holiday season/new year and are doing well!  This chapter is a lot longer than last time's to make up for it, hopefully.  I've created a
“I didn’t lie; I jusssst omitted the whole truth. I think I’ll take my leave now. I have to get to class.”
It was all anyone could talk about for weeks to come, and Harry quickly informed Tom, who was quite morbidly impressed and enraged.  Aurors had flooded Hogwarts, and the students, and the teachers, were all in a muted frenzy.  By the time Harry had classes again, and the weekend was over, he had heard thousands of theories, had been questioned by dozens of Aurors, and was truly disappointed.  These students had decided to throw away their futures in exchange for what, money?  The thrill?  The Greengrass name had been dragged through the mud -- it was worth less than a first-generation mundane-born.  They were all looking at prison sentences, and that would likely mar their record for the rest of their lives.  The rewards were meaningless when those five students began to face the consequences of their actions.
As the night progressed, Draco and Harry found themselves dancing together, swaying with the crowd.  Draco dipped Harry, and they almost,
The Minister’s smile widened, and he answered, “Any spell allowed and aim to incapacitate, no maiming and killing.”
He had heard about them once or twice before; the Potter library was a lot darker than one would think, but it was mostly as examples of Black Magic (not Dark, Black) and that you should never, ever use them.  Harry scraped the bottom of his mind for any information on them, but all he found was what Tom had told him, a couple of warnings, and one vaguely chronicled tale on Herpo the Foul.  Otherwise, he didn’t have much to go on.  Filing that on a brand new shelf, Harry moved onto the more
Harry shook his head as if to clear out all the wayward thoughts in his mind, and he huffed a laugh, smiling softly at Draco, who flushed a pale pink.  Huh.  That was new.  His smile widened, and Draco’s breath softly hitched.  This would have gone on further if Hermione hadn’t linked arms with them and dragged them into a carriage, interrupting whatever
Standing up and flopping back onto his bed, Harry ran through everything he knew would happen at the annual ceremony.
somnos en aeternum - a charm that puts the targeted person into a deep sleep until the counter charm is cast
A person next to him huffed, and he whirled around to see his second favorite person in the whole wide world (the first was Hermione) Draco!  He was dressed in his black robes, blue and bronze accents striking against his pale coloring.  And hadn’t his sorting been a surprise.  It fit, though, and after several violent incidents in their first year, Draco had inserted himself into the fast-formed friendship Harry and Hermione had.
He read, re-read, and re-read again the information Tom had written, memorizing all the different chants. When he was confident in his memory, he put the diary and the diadem in the center of the Teth rune, took a deep breath, and summoned his wand. Waving it in the same pattern as the Teth rune, he chanted, “
before banishing them.  The class was silent, they hadn’t seen anything like that before, and Susan looked on appreciatively.  She readied her wand, back on offensive, and opened her mouth to cast a spell when she heard a slow clap.  The Minister disillusioned himself and walked--no stalked--towards the pair.  They lowered their wand arms and stood, facing the man.
Harry thanked him again and grabbed his stuff.  He was immediately accosted by Draco and Hermione, who looked frantic.
Then, the Headmaster called the end of the feast, and the food disappeared.  He stood up and said, “This year, our esteemed Minister is looking for an apprentice in their 6th or 7th year to study underneath him in the Ministry. This is an excellent opportunity, and I hope you all take advantage of it.  Anyone with a grade average of EE or above will be considered. Minister, is there anything you'd like to address to the students?"
Professor Black looked at them sternly before continuing, “Amortentia is one of the worst potions out there, which is why we no longer teach you how to make it and focus on the antidote, instead. Now, I have posted the instructions on the board, so gather your ingredients and begin.”
Hi everyone!!  I hope you're doing well!!  I am back with another chapter (very late due to finals week, I apologize), and this one is pretty heavy on the world/ritual building, so these are all my headcanons, stuff I picked up from other fics/tumblr, and ancient alphabets!  Slight T/W for self-harm (scratching and ritual based blood-letting).  More info on the ritual is at the end!
Harry didn’t bother with shoes -- it wasn’t like they were necessary or even customary for formal ceremonies.  He strode down the hall and stairs and looped around the mansion till he was at the entrance, where James already was.
Harry read the scrawl of chalk on the blackboard and, while Hermione set up their work station, went to their assigned cubby to grab:
“That’s a weighty accusation,” Cousin Rhodesia said, “I would have to report you, if that were the case.”

In a swirl of color and a last breath of air, Harry and his family were transported to Moonlight Plaza, the largest plaza in Wixen UK, where all annual rites were performed.
Finally, the class period ended, and Harry rushed back to his dorm, flanked by Helen and Ophelia (Terry and Sue went off to the library).  Making some haphazard excuse about wanting alone time, he rushed into his dorm, threw his shoes off, and quickly summoned a quill.
Hermione stepped away and nodded her agreement, linking her arms with Harry’s on his right side, Draco linking his on Harry’s left.  They walked to the DADA classroom, and it seemed that everyone, from the littlest first year to all their year mates, knew about the incident in Charms.  Harry sighed but shrugged the whispers off and entered the room.
The three of them exited their dorm and were greeted by an anxious-looking Hermione and Draco, though they hid it admirably, Harry just knew them too well.  He smiled and linked arms with them, and they all walked to the Great Hall.  Everyone was mostly there, and he received plenty of sympathetic looks from his peers in other houses.  Harry sat down next to Lisa, Luna, and Anthony and served himself some french toast.
Hey everyone!! I hope you're doing well!  My friends tell me to stop apologizing for late updates, but here I am, apologizing for another very late update.  I swear I try to update more than once a month, but I dunno it never happens T-T Also AP season and finals are coming up so if I don't update this fic till school's out, that's why, and I'm super sorry about it.
Ah, he was getting semantic with all this rumination.  Harry left his emotion tapestry to expand and grow and walked up the stairs back into the realm of the living.  He braced himself as all the physical feelings (chilly air, heavy breathing, itchy blanket) returned, and he waited out the disorientation till he was in full possession of his facilities.  Harry cast a
Harry smiled widely at her, the adults trailing behind.  Though he had several other little ‘cousins’ from the Black family, she was his only baby cousin, and he held an abundance of affection for her.  She wasn’t the only little child at the festivities, though.  When Harry’s family got to the Black family (and Malfoy/Nott/Potter), the little kiddies swarmed them.  He didn’t know them all that well, only having met them once or twice, but he greeted them all, sparing a little more time for Aries Black, one his Ravenclaws in 2nd year.  Aries was Heir Andromeda Black’s son and the younger brother to Tonks, who Harry knew only tangentially.
Once finished, he added the 24 grams of Io tongue and stirred 3 times clockwise.  Harry then mixed the poppy seed Oil and dawn orchid nectar and poured it into the cauldron, turning the flame onto low.  He took his mind off his prickling neck and stirred 3 times counterclockwise.  Harry turned the flame off and let the potion sit off the flame for 3 minutes and 6 seconds.  It was a matte, vibrant teal blue with little black speckles, and if he did it correctly when he sprinkled the arachnanutmeg on top, it would turn brilliant oily chartreuse.  He watched the last seconds tick down, sprinkled the arachnanutmeg on top, and watched with bated breath as the potion swirled into the exact right color -- just the slightest bit less oily than it probably should be.
Hermione and Draco were pressed up against his sides, providing the physical comfort he desperately needed.  Luna looked unusually solemn, and she whispered foreseen futures entangled in between comments on wrackspurts, midali, and nargles.  Lisa, Marietta, and Maisy fielded questions from other concerned students (his year mates in different houses, Ravenclaws in other houses, and other students who knew or of Harry) so Harry didn’t have to deal with their probing queries.  The rest of the 7th year Ravenclaws just formed a barrier around Harry, and he was beyond grateful for them.
Draco just groaned in response and put his head on Harry’s shoulder, his murderous mumblings muffled by Harry’s robes.  Harry just patted his head lightly and struck up a conversation with Anthony about Arithmancy.
There used to be -- at least, according to the painting of Great-Great-Great Grandmother Melphia  -- a jewelry-maker house-elf, but no longer, so the only jewelry the Potter family had any longer was the rare heirloom and wedding gifts.  With the limited selection (wixen were buried with their jewelry), Topsy picked out the best accessories for his status and outfit and then proceeded to make his stag mask for the annual rites, complete with gold antlers.
It was on a bright morning, precisely three days after Olivia came into their life, that the prospect of bathing her came to light.
"Your hair's gotten prettier," Potter said in a form of conversation, "I like how fluffy it is now. You should leave it like that more." His fingers skimmed over the edge of Draco's fringe as he talked.
Potter had now ambushed him in an empty bathroom. Draco was just about to leave after washing his hands when Potter barged in taking a look at Draco, and backing him up towards the sink in one swift motion. Draco tried to make a narrow escape this time, he truly did. But he had failed rather miserably — the git was really quick on his feet —  and was now stuck in a very horrifying position between Potter and the
It wasn’t fair. The way Draco made it all look so effortless. As if leaving things behind came second to nature to him. Looking back, Harry sometimes wondered if it actually was natural for him all along. Maybe it was only Harry who was foolish enough to not see it. He had always been foolish when it came to Draco.
"Thank fuck," Draco said, dropping his head onto Harry's shoulder and Harry let out a little chuckle, watching as Olivia broke into one of her dazzling smiles.
Three years after the war when he had once again run into the blonde-haired man, he knew his life wouldn’t stay the same. Studying at the same university under different subjects didn’t seem to lessen the amount of time they saw each other. Even though Harry had taken up The Study of Magical Signature just to relax a bit before joining the Auror department, Draco and his little struts around the hallways of their University while clutching some obscure book on healing had kept him up most nights. His downright obsession soon turned into infatuation without the shadows of war surrounding them, and soon Harry found the sly tilt of those thin pink lips more distracting than destroying. He was a lost cause by the time Draco Malfoy started to smile at him.
"You know, Malfoy," Potter spoke over him with a sigh of pure defeat, "for a person with clear eyesight, you sure are

"What's your game, Potter?" he asked calmly as Potter's face floated an inch away from him. Draco was this time ambushed while taking a stroll around the grounds; Potter popping up out of nowhere and forcing himself onto Draco yet again in the most

The sigh that escaped Draco suddenly made him look much older than he was. As if twenty seven was a number that weighted ton on his thin shoulders.
So the sight of Draco sitting on the floor to their bathroom in his pressed white shirt and black trousers did things to his heart. The blond looked every bit of the posh git who shouldn’t have any business sitting on the floor with a mountain of bath towels, but there he was, crouched down, face pinched with concentration as he tried to get the temperature of the water just right.
"C-can't you just accio them?" Draco forced himself to sputter out, bringing an end to his train of thought that was taking an alarming turn. He took another step back from the glasses-less idiot just for safety.
Hearing his voice, Draco looked up at him like a kicked puppy, his eyes holding so much pain that it forced Harry to look away.
he sputtered indignantly, pushing his nose up high. "I'll have you know that the Malfoy's ar— mmpph!"  the rest of the words died in his throat as Potter's lips crashed onto his own, causing all sorts of alarms to start ringing inside his head.
The bone shattering panic that seized his body began to melt slowly as he took in the familiar green eyes, just mere inches away from his face. Salazar they were standing

look that Potter sprouted, and now, everyone and anyone could be seen wearing those pitiful glasses up their nose. As if those would make them look like the golden git.
"Who are you?" the person in front of him asked, finally deciding to speak while taking a dangerous step closer towards Draco, and while Draco's brain did recognise who those vivid eyes belonged to, the sudden lack of personal space between their bodies had left him quite, well,
"You'll have the next seven years to do this, so best watch and learn for now boys," Molly had told them with an amused smile after looking at their swollen face, and both of them had nodded stiffly in return.
"Well, now that you've made sure it's me, kindly piss off?" Draco snapped at him as he tried to maintain every inch of distance as he could. This was not good for his mental state. He was already having dream after dream where Potter backed him up towards various hard objects before doing terrible,

with most of the returning eighth years. He had a good, civilized talk with Granger and even a stiff little conversation with Weasley that had ended with an understanding nod from both sides. Hell, he even apologised to Longbottom for everything he had done in the past. Draco was half sure he was going to be sent to Azkaban with his family before, so it was a surprise when Potter spoke for them at his and his mother's trial, saving both of them from that horrible sickly place.

His face broke into the softest smile the second he spotted Harry with Olivia, and he spread both of his arms at their direction, ushering them close.
"Say that for yourself!" Harry swatted him without realising. "I saw the uhh, the photos of your fall collection. They were — you’re really
you, Harry," the man whispered aloud, and suddenly all Harry could feel was pain engulfing his chest.
Harry sighed before moving away with an amused smile, watching Draco cradle Olivia into his arms, slowly dipping her down into the tub, feet first.
Harry still remembered the casual way Draco had said those words ten years ago, his legs dangling loosely  from a window of the owlery, how easily he had fitted himself right beside Harry after that, demanding Harry to pull himself together.
In his three piece navy suit, Draco looked like he came off of a runway, which he no doubt did, with what his career was now.
"Can I then interest you into buying one of my designer coats, then?" Draco asked in a pleased tone, and Harry chuckled.
"My game?" Potter's voice broke Draco out of his little trance, and Draco did his best to give the man a glare with the blush he was sprouting. It was unnatural, being this close to him.
The shop owner had been thrilled when he saw it was none other than Harry Potter stepping over his little threshold, swooning like a twelve year old girl at every word that left Potter's mouth. With the way his head was bobbing furiously at everything Potter said, Draco was sure the man was going to sprain his neck muscles at any given moment.
"So are we ready?" he said dipping his pinky into the tub, and Draco nodded briskly before taking Olivia into his arms.

"A hidden surprise that only shows itself to the ones who look," Draco had mumbled into his neck after Harry wore it for the first time three days after they met at the function, and Harry had chuckled.
In the end, their long-awaited family time finally came along two weeks later, and there was no one happier than Draco.
"Harry," Draco's soft voice drifted towards him again, sending vibrations of pain into the broken strings of his heart. And it was funny, how he hadn’t heard that voice call him for a year. But the way Draco said his name made Harry feel like he had never stopped calling him.

Potter cooed at him for that. "Are you worried about me, Malfoy?" he asked in a teasing manner, taking another dangerous step closer to him. Merlin's —
"Ohh?" Draco said, turning towards the man who was smiling rather warmly at him. "Is this the only reason you bought me along then?" he asked while taking a step towards him, Potter's grin widening at the closing distance between.
"Yes. All your fault. I was an angel of a child growing up. So there is no way she got this troublesome behaviour from
It took another whole day before they got to bring Olivia to their home at Somerset. When they walked into their little cottage in the countryside, they were welcomed with open arms. Hermione stood teary-eyed beside a happy Ron who clapped Harry solidly on the back, before melting into a cooing puddle when his eyes landed on their daughter. Molly was the first one to take Olivia into her arms, dropping a huge kiss on her forehead while both Harry and Draco tried to keep their footing straight. They hadn’t had a single drop of sleep since the trip to Edinburgh, and everything around them felt like a drunken happy daze, everyone cheering and cooing and pulling them into warm hugs. Both of them were reluctant to leave until Molly shooed them away for a much-needed bath, but a shower had proved to be the just the thing both of them needed then. Upon returning to their living room, clad in fresh clothes and a clear mind, the sight of their daughter sleeping soundly in Molly’s arms as everyone circled her, struck them with a sense of happiness they didn’t know existed before.

as the book impacts against the flat of his hand. Another flick of Draco’s wand, and book slams open, the pages fluttering as the volume flicks open.

Three is a blessed number everywhere, it seems. Three times, Astoria and Stephen bow before they drink clear liquor from tiny porcelain cups. Three times, the binding knot is tied around their clasped hands, as the spell takes and they are sealed together as husband and wife. Three times, Astoria presses kisses to Stephen’s knuckles, and three times, she wipes the tears from his face and whispers to him:
‘Look, I wasn’t the one conducting the interview,’ Proudfoot says, raising his hands defensively. ‘But there’s no way Robards would have approved that sort of thing unless it was absolutely necessary.’
Harry’s not alone, and he is with family. He sits in front of the Christmas tree and watches fondly as Teddy rips apart everyone’s presents for them, because apparently none of them can do it fast enough, and tries not to laugh when Teddy places the ribbons in Draco’s hair and messes it up horribly, only then Draco glances over at Harry with a lopsided smile, and Harry can only stare at Draco and fall deeper and deeper.
‘We were in school when the War ended,’ Angel explains. He interlocks his fingers and places his hands on the polished surface of his desk. ‘By the time we finished up our Cursebreaker apprenticeships, the hate crimes started up again. People were scared. And we realized we’re more interested in preventing curses than breaking them.’
Harry storms back into his office, his anger still burning in his veins as he slams the door behind him with a satisfying thud. ‘If one more person asks me why I associate with Death Eaters,’ he rages, shucking off his outer robes and flinging them unceremoniously at his chair, ‘I will hex them into oblivion.’
Draco’s skin is pale, and he looks sickly and thin, but his eyes burn with a fury that makes Harry’s heart leap with hope. And then there’s his hands - Draco’s beautiful, long-fingered hands - clenched into angry fists on his lap.
‘Your Muggle family were bloody appalling, Harry,’ Draco points out. ‘You didn’t have to stay with people who didn’t want you. There were plenty of people who were willing to take care of you. Lupin. Hagrid. Hell, even Severus would have been a better option.’
After Ron’s had an appropriate viewing of the hybrid nightmare of the plant and uttered a few choice cuss-words at the thing, they circle back up towards the house. Ron flops down beneath the old oak in Harry’s garden and leans back against its gnarled trunk. Harry pulls off his shoes and socks, rolls up his trouser-legs, and drops down on the earth next to Ron.
Smythe still doesn’t seem to understand, but one of the witches behind him grabs him by the arm and shakes her head. She whispers in his ear what Harry already knows - what everyone even tangentially involved in Healing or Potions or has worked in any kind of magical laboratory knows.
… Harry has never seen anything burn so bright. ‘You will take that abomination off him. Right now.’
‘Yes. No. What I mean is,’ Harry says, feeling frustration bubble up in his chest to sting in his mouth, ‘yes. It has to be compatible for it to work, but there’s more. I’m sorry. I’m trying to explain,’ he sighs.
‘Right,’ he says, with conviction. ‘When I was going through all my issues, with the alcoholism, the reckless self-endangerment, you were there for me. Unequivocally. But I wasn’t there for you, not properly, even though you were going through so many of your own hardships.’
. He’s wearing a white t-shirt and jeans, and a leather jacket with the collar propped up against the chill, and he’s got a freshly rolled cigarette tucked behind his ear. He’s put a little product in his hair so that it stays out of his face, but that only makes the colour of his eyes more striking.
‘I do not want my nephew to be a war hero,’ Andromeda says, her voice edged with steel. ‘He is my family, and I want him alive. However, he shall not live for very long if you do not put that
Harry’s on his feet in an instant, racing towards the elevators. His pulse drums a feverish beat as he charges down the corridors faster than he’s ever run in his life. He nearly collides with the Healer leaving Draco’s room. She says something to him, an explanation of sorts, facts and spells and medical terminology that he stows away for when he’s thinking clearly, and he responds as politely as he can, excuses himself, and then he’s through and in the room and Draco-
But Malfoy is crying. His long, lean body curled over the sink, his body heaving with ugly, bone-crushing sobs, his knuckles white as he grips onto the sink. He’s sloppy when he whirls around at Harry, his voice shrill with desperation as he tries to get all the syllables out, but he’s slow, and Harry’s always been faster in a duel.
‘Always taking care of me,’ Narcissa says to the wall, and Harry wants to throw himself out the window.
Draco plucks the cigarette from Harry’s fingers. His skin is so pale in comparison to Harry’s dark, summer-browned skin. ‘Our adults did a real number on us,’ he says quietly, ‘didn’t they?’
Pansy drops into the nearest sofa. She makes to lift her feet up onto the cushions but is stopped by a disapproving glare from Draco.
‘Of course she did,’ Pansy replies. She waves the piece of paper.  ‘She gave me a list of questions to go through.’
‘Oh, Merlin, here we go again,’ Ron says wearily. ‘George has an idea, Harry. Let’s go save him from it.’
Draco kneels on the floor in front of Harry’s bed, holding the holly wand in his hands as tightly as though it were the remains of his shattered heart. Milky blue light spills in through the curtains as dawn approaches. The windows are open, and a chill lingers in Harry’s bedroom. The bed has not been slept in, and Draco does not dare to look up at it, hateful of Harry’s absence.
‘I’m not exactly going anywhere, Harry,’ Draco says, tilting his head meaningfully towards the glimmer of monitoring spells still hovering above, the medical chart clipped onto the foot of the bed. ‘Take your time.’
‘Hello,’ says Harry. His smile is a quiet, tender thing, and he is so beautiful that Draco almost forgets his misery. ‘It’s a bit cold in here today, isn’t it?’
Draco looks at Harry like he’s a puzzle that needs solving. ‘You say the strangest fucking things,’ he remarks. ‘Someday I’ll figure out what you really mean.’
‘I’ll eat your honey parsnips and carrots then,’ Draco says, leaning over to spoon the potatoes into Harry’s plate.
Next up: a long-awaited confession,Teddy is the Best Boy, Harry tries to explain time magic (poorly), Pansy-f'n-Parkinson, and Lucius does not get what he deserves. At least, not yet.
Harry knows he should be thankful, but instead he feels nauseous about the whole thing. When he confesses this to Draco, burning with guilt and shame, Draco just nods solemnly.
‘You can get angry at her, you know,’ Draco says, breaking the comfortable silence. ‘That’s normal.’
Draco bites down lightly on his kiss-stung lips. His eyes are the very fire that lights the stars when he looks at Harry, and Harry doesn’t know how
Harry pushes his glasses back on and nudges Malfoy lightly with his elbow. ‘Not for me,’ he grins.  ‘For you.’
The man smiles. His teeth are brilliant against his dark skin. ‘You may have two weeks to perform a private investigation into the disappearance of Draco Malfoy,’ says the Unspeakable. ‘After that point, you will make every effort to cooperate with Auror Proudfoot and his partner.’
There isn’t time to explain. He can feel them approaching now, their magic sour against the warm golden spread of the wedding guests. Harry unclips the wand holster from his thigh faster than lightning and tucks it into the inner pocket of Draco’s jacket. He slips a
Mr. Blake, the owner of the bookstore he works at, is a kind man. He gives Draco money for coffee. His wife makes Draco lunches for his long shifts. He buys Draco a coat when a particularly harsh winter strikes - and boots too, and then gives Draco these spectacular little pouches that can be warmed up in the mi-cro-wave and then tucked away in his pockets to keep him warm. He buys Draco Christmas presents and birthday presents and knows to keep a jar of sweets at the cashier, because Draco has a terrible sweet tooth.
Instead, he turns towards the Unspeakable. ‘You’re not giving me a choice, are you?’ he asks wearily.
‘Professor!’ Michelle exclaims, rising from her seat and flinging her arms out dramatically. ‘You are here!’
exactly,’ Daphne says. ‘Just different. I am curious, though. Harry, would you indulge me in something?’
Harry, in turn, tells Malfoy about taming Grimmauld Place, about his valiant efforts to compromise with Kreacher regarding housework, about how much he hates six-day work weeks, but it’s nice because it’s sort of pushed him and Ginny to move in together, which is great because Harry’s pretty certain he wants to be with her forever and a forever is nice after
‘Mum, Dad, Ron - everyone told me I was being cruel,’ Ginny says, ploughing on relentlessly. ‘You were going through absolute hell and I couldn’t find the capacity to be there for you. So I left you. And that’s on me.’
Harry stares at the black brand on the wall where Prentis used to exist. She didn’t even have time to scream. The fire burns, the same green as infection and sickness, its flames reaching eight feet into the sky. Harry’s mouth tastes of ash and charred bone. There’s a ringing in his ears that grows louder and louder.
Harry thinks his knees might give out. He grabs Draco’s forearm in an effort to steady himself. ‘Fuck,’ he curses. ‘Draco, are you - are you really doing this?’
Draco climbs back up the stairs and continues sliding books into place. ‘I told you you weren’t going to like Murakami,’ he says, glancing down over his shoulder.
"Salazar's ti—" his words were cut off when a splash of water landed square on his face, and Harry began to laugh, helplessly enjoying the whole thing play out, while Draco sputtered about.
While both of them did appreciate the help all of them insisted they needed, they still felt a bit left out at having to just stand and watch while the three of them did everything.
And Harry wanted to. Harry wanted to look at him and scream and break down, wanted to wrap his arms around the man and pull him close because he was
"Loves to see us in pain, doesn’t she?" Draco muttered from behind him, his voice fond despite the accusing.
