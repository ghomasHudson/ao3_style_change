Later that night after Andromeda had gone, Narcissa was seated at her vanity brushing out her hair while Lucius was pulling off his socks and unbuttoning his cuffs getting ready for bed. She hummed a little tune under her breath and leaned toward the mirror to examine herself for any new wrinkles.
“After the war you just kept on going, you didn’t have to stop to rest. Auror training, marriage, kids; it’s a lot to deal with after a war without a pause to breathe. Then James was born barely out of Hogwarts and your life hasn’t really slowed down since. Obviously it eventually overwhelmed her."
will do this," and he did a practiced swish and flick, clearly saying the magic words. The rickety lawn chair sitting off to the side sprang into the air a good four feet up.
Rounding a bookshelf, Draco saw Hermione curled into a tight ball in the very back corner of the Arithmancy section crying her heart out.
Cool gray eyes regarded Harry from the other side of the desk before Lucius found his voice once more after that rather passionate speech.
"I focused on the love I have for them and the love they gave to me, and every day the hurt got a little less; a little better," Narcissa said quietly staring off into the darkness. "Focus on something else, dear," she told Hermione. "Focus on your beautiful children and your amazing husband. They love you dearly, no matter what. They will continue loving you, no matter what."
Draco glared at him then turned his furious eyes on the still giggling children behind him. "I bet you all think that was funny."
“What are you going to get Teddy for his birthday?” Draco asked changing the subject again.
"She is a very odd girl," Lucius commented after she'd gone. "Very, very odd, but intelligent."
A distinctly uncomfortable feeling was crawling up his spine. Harry turned around and made sure to keep his voice low. "Hey guys, knock off the hissing until we get home. It's drawing too much attention."
Narcissa stared at her, utterly stunned for a moment before choosing not to comment.
Scorpius was good for the kids as well. He was a kind, happy, cheerful, energetic, loving kid. He wasn't spoiled, at least not rottenly so, not in the way Draco had been at Hogwarts.
"Three times as fast as what?"
"Oh, well," Narcissa began with an exasperated air. "My darling mother-in-law had some very, shall we say, malicious plants installed during her tenure as Mistress of the Manor. They are very Dark and we have been unable to divine a way of removing them without severe injury," she told Molly, receiving a commiserating hum from the older woman.
"What happened?" Lily asked from her place next to him.
"Imagine that," Ron murmured and shot an amused look at Harry who grinned in return.
Lily just shrugged unconcerned. She didn't really know what "blackmail" meant, but if it got James to help research then she wasn't going to say anything.
And they did. They read all through the rest of Lucius's entry and then started on Draco's without stopping until they hit the end of that one too.
Lucius had the good grace to blink somewhat owlishly, or as owlishly as he could get, before coming back to himself. "Why in heaven's name would you want to invest your perfectly good gold in that imbecilic and asinine rag?" he sneered.
"You're Albus, eh?" he said with a small reassuring smile.
"Most of my money is," Draco conceded. "I get a hefty galleon from my shop in Diagon, and other bits and bobs I get up to." Harry didn't bother asking what “bits and bobs” entailed exactly. He figured it was best not to know. "The Malfoy fortune has always been large, but when my father inherited the Lordship from his father it wasn't really all that impressive. The fortune was about a sixth of what it is now."
He answer was some sputtering over the line and he burst into laughter. "Haha! Way to go, Big D! How far along is she?"
. The staff described is the one Merlin got from a pair of evil Sidhe. According to the show the runes on the staff are Ogham, an ancient Celtic language, and are meant to spell out: Abas ocus bithe duthected bithlane, which supposedly translates to: “To hold life and death in your hands”.
"Luna Lovegood would be that loony girl with the long blond hair, then?" he asked in affected neutrality. He did remember that girl. Brave, but frighteningly spacey, he recalled. Not a bad witch. Of course, she'd also spent quite a bit of time in his dungeon.
The little boy stammered, "It was an accident, Dad! I was trying to teach him to say, ‘
"I hope you come back soon," he said softly, sounding much younger than he was.
"And I'm Fire Lily," Lily told them proudly.
"So, tell me about this young man of yours and then we'll sort out the rest of your problems I know you're still stewing over."
Teddy was busy trying to make nice between his three pets while the other children talked and chatted with their snakes and each other, translating when need be. Really it was the strangest breakfast he'd had in a long time. Not that he minded much.
Lucius stared at him in contemplation. He hadn't ever thought that Potter would wish to seek out his company apart from their financial meetings and the times that Draco and Narcissa forced them together. Potter asking for his assistance in exploring his own heirloom vaults was... surprising.
“Quite sure, dear.” She smirked at him and released his hand after patting it lightly. “If you can’t find them, come back down and I’ll help you look.”
Harry glanced at him with a self deprecating smile. “Nope. They didn’t even remember. We were still on the run trying to escape the Hogwarts letters they kept sending me. Hagrid actually gave me my first ever present that year. A rather squashed birthday cake.” Harry chuckled fondly at the memory. “He’d sat on it on the way to the place we were staying, but it was still nice.”
"You wouldn't happen to make earrings, would you?" Bill asked with a teasing grin as he lightly flicked his ever present fang earring with his fingers.
Belle seemed to think about that for a moment. “
” she murmured and snuggled the snake closer to her chest. “
Draco watched the whole display with increasing suspicion. He had a sixth sense for scheming and it was definitely tingling. Oh yeah, he was so going to have a word with Shotzy sometime soon.
She sniffed and unclasped her cloak letting it fall to the floor expecting that a house-elf would be there to catch it. One was, of course, and the cloak was quickly whisked away by the frightened shivering creature. They all knew Mistress Cassiopeia de Vil Malfoy. They all knew better than to displease her, as well.
Eventually, Cassiopeia shrugged it all off and waved her hand through the air dismissively. "Very well, Narcissa. Our family owes Harry Potter lives and life-debts. I will play nice," she said. "The Gaunts never were any good stock. I never understood what Lucius saw in that interloping half-blood of theirs anyway."
Sighing, Harry tightened his hold on Draco tilting his face just enough to smell the clear herbal scent of his soft blond hair. "Yeah, I wouldn't mind waking up like this again either."
"I made you get sorted into Gryffindor?" Draco demanded, words horrified and a little shrill.
," Draco nodded seriously. "
"From what I understand, she's a muggle as well and has no family history of a wizard on either side," Draco said munching on an orange flavored cookie. "It must come from the cousin's side. Harry's aunt was Lily Potter's sister after all. Perhaps magic is a recessive gene in the family."
Harry had to smile at the boy for that. Scorpius was perhaps the only child he knew that could make being a Parselmouth sound like the neatest thing since sliced bread. It probably had something to do with generations of Malfoys being sorted into Slytherin.
"No. He lives with his maternal grandmother. I would like him to live with us, but she likes to hog him." He grinned, trying to return some lightness to the conversation. "He does come and stay with us as often as he can, though."
"Does everybody know what they want?" Harry asked, noticing not for the first time just how strange his kids were acting that day.
Harry gave them both a stiff formal nod. "Good morning Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy. Thank you for allowing my children and I to join you."
"Oh! Can Teddy really stay with us, Aun’ Dromeda?" Lily latched into Teddy like a limpet, her eyes wide and pleading like her father’s had been.
"Nah, mate, it's alright.” He waved off the apology easing some of the tightness in Harry’s expression. “I kinda figured as much. It just makes it real to hear it out loud."
"Teddy, two snakes?" Harry stepped closer eyeing them.
"Yep!" Lily grinned guilelessly lifting her snake up in explanation. "Belle was helping me." She was way better at fibbing than the boys were.
Harry finally tells his two best friends about all the changes in his life and is met with a mixed reception. Surprisingly his conversation with Lucius is less nerve wracking.
He nodded. "Yeah, ’course." He didn't tell her that Sirius spent the last two years of his life on the lam or locked inside his house. She would just start crying again.
"Draco can't be our mum. He's a boy like Dad," James said like it should have been obvious.
Narcissa just smiled at him knowingly and let him guide her. She knew she was never wrong.
"Where's your wife, Harry?"
An idea floated through Harry's head. Perhaps Chrissy wasn't the only one prone to accidental magic.
Lucuis frowned at the sword then his eyes widened in dawning horror. "My God," he breathed.
Draco, arms crossed unhappily over his chest, curiously lifted his gaze from where he'd been staring at floor. "What do you mean?"
With a sigh, Draco turned his attention back on the garden and watched their children chase each other in some game that only children were allowed play.
With a resigned sigh she nodded. "Yes, Mr. Potter. Please follow me."
Taking a deep breath, Teddy rose onto the tips of his toes with the force of it and blew as hard as he could. Every single candle extinguished itself in perfect synchronization.
Teddy stopped reading and lifted his head, a bright grin on his lips as he met Harry's proud smiling face. "I'm going to Hogwarts!" he shouted bouncing up and down excitedly.
"Of course, I nearly had to put the beast down," Lucius continued casually, like they were talking about the weather.
That earned him tentative smiles from the children. Albus pulled his face away from Draco's neck and wiped furiously at his eyes trying to get rid of the remnants of his tears.
A short planning session later, the five of them were sneaking down the stairs to the second floor. Scorpius went first, seeing as how he knew where to go, then Albus, Lily, James, and last, Teddy. They crept through the hall in a straight line constantly looking left, right, and over their shoulders for any sign of Lucius or anyone else that might give up their game.
Marianne and Dudley stared at him incomprehensibly.
Lucius raised an eyebrow, but picked them up and began to read.
The little boy looked up into his eyes for a second then quickly looked back down at his feet, shuffling shyly. "Hi, Harry. I'm glad you're here," he murmured quietly, tentative gray eyes peeking up at him again through silvery blond hair.
"Is the floo repaired?" he asked coolly
” James giggled when she flicked her tongue out smacking him on the nose with it. “
Turning back to Albus's hand's Draco looked them over before pulling a handkercheif from his own pocket and wiping the salve away. "You're all done, Albus. Check them over and tell me if I missed a spot."
"Mostly shelters for woman -and men- abused by either their families or spouses," Audrey answered with a sobering voice. "There is a rash of abuse in mixed homes and we find that there just isn't enough help going out to those people that need it."
This was one of Molly's favorite days because it usually brought all of her thirteen grandchildren together and gave her an excuse to cook for more than just her and Arthur.
“My Ted could never find his tie-tacks,” Andromeda reminisced fondly. “Of course, it never occurred to him to just
A gush of air exploded from Ron’s lungs. Looking back it didn't really surprise him, it just... It was just a little hard to hear it out loud.
Hermione looked truly surprised by the question and Ron nearly choked on his strudel. "Um, no, sweetie. You can't have a pet snake."
"I have to tell you something." Draco lifted his head and looked Harry in his beautiful curious green eyes. "I can have more kids," he told him, then realized that didn’t really explain anything.
"Albus," Harry frowned at his messy, raven haired son. "Don’t shout, at me. I didn’t lie. Your mum-"
Nodding, Draco ushered the boy toward his mother as the floo flared again. A large, burly man tumbled through carrying a wide-eyed starfished little girl in his arms.
"Oh! He didn't go into details or anything," Scorpius reassured them. "Just told me stuff that wasn't put into any of the newspapers or history books."
There was a slightly choked sound from across the table, but by now they were both used to ignoring any disturbance from that seat.
. He raised an eyebrow in surprise.
"Yes, I suggest that you do," Lucius agreed sternly. "However, seeing as you are not a Black and that you have no real knowledge of their magics, you should enlist Draco or someone else well versed in the Dark Arts to go with you. There may be -unpleasant- artifacts in that vault that you will not know how to combat," he cautioned.
"I'm a matris," Draco explained a bit nervously. "I can bear children. I can get pregnant and give birth to an infant. I can have babies." He clarified, rushing through and rephrasing perhaps more than he needed to.  Harry seemed to understand him just fine, but that wide eyed unicorn in spotlight look was not reassuring.
, Draco finished for him silently, his gaze meeting Harry's once more. "I know, Harry," he murmured, heart beating hard in his chest. "I feel it, too."
Draco didn't know where she was going with this, but he was willing to let it play out. He was curious now that it the situation didn’t seem like it was going to turn unpleasant.
Tilting his head once more so he could look at him, Draco stared into his eyes for a moment. "Yes," he finally answered, "I'd love to have more kids."
"That's..." Albus trailed off then blinked, "really, really ironic."
It didn't escape anyone at the table, except for Draco and Harry, that he'd said "our boys". Ron and Hermione traded a look before glancing back at the rest of the group. "Are you having any success?" she asked Scorpius, her analytical tone of voice very familiar to her two best friends.
Combing his fingers through Draco's hair, Harry stroked over his neck and shoulders, and pressed down his back to grasp at his waist, pulling him closer.
"And this is Harry James Potter, his godson, Theodore Remus Lupin, and his children, James Sirius, Albus Severus, and Lily Luna." Harry held the woman's eyes until she broke contact and turned her gaze on each of his children, one at a time.
"By the way, what's in the box?" Harry asked once he and Draco made it out to the yard.
"My financial adviser," Harry repeated slower with a slight grimace of anticipation. "He's bloody rich, you know. Draco told me he accumulated most of the Malfoy wealth after his father died and he became Lord of the Manor. Part ownerships in businesses, investments, real-estate. It was all Lucius." He shrugged. "I got to thinking and I want to leave my kids that kind of legacy. I want them to have property and wealth. Something you have to work at to maintain even if you don't technically have a job."
Draco stared down at the little boy nearly speechless. He knew exactly who this kid was. Well, he hadn't known his name, but he sure as shit knew who he belonged to. Those bright green eyes, that messy hair, that stubborn chin. There was only one person he could have gotten all of that from.
"That's really amazing," she said, her eyes tracking Teddy through the yard as he once again led the siege against the garden gnome. "Is it just his hair or...?"
Andromeda felt herself blanch then flush with shame. How much had he heard? It didn't matter, she realized, as she looked at his lank hair and his unhappy eyes. He'd heard enough.
Mowgli nodded patiently. "She is trained just like the others. She'll know what to do."
James knew absolutely everything, and Lily was so nice! Scorpius sorely hoped that Harry would bring them over all the time. Even though he didn't ever tell his dad, he got lonely being the only kid at the Manor.
"Tipsy is sorry, Masters, Mistress," she curtsied nervously, "but there is no more rooms available for Mister Harry Potter, sir."
"I promise."
"It's rather interesting what you've done with this room, Narcissa," she commented, an undercurrent of mockery in her elegant accented voice.
"No, Scorpius. You're not in trouble." He finally let them off the hook his voice softening. "I will, however, request that when you wish to use the house-elves in any future schemes, you inform me ahead of time. Especially if something important, like the floo, is to mysteriously cease functioning as part of those schemes."
’, but he couldn't get the little s's. He didn't mean to say that." Albus hunched his shoulders, his face reddening.
"Yes, please." Harry smirked and leaned into the chaste close mouthed kiss Draco pressed to his lips. "Good morning, love."
He always did have a dangerous sense of curiosity.
Struggling to calm himself, Lucius peered down his nose at the little pot-bellied, bald man with all the arrogant disdain he could muster. "Quite the contrary, Draco's shop is doing very well. It's very popular with young people buying gifts for their lovers." His sneer curled into a malicious smirk and the other passengers all sucked in a breath as he continued as if trading bland pleasantries. "In fact, if I remember correctly, he was telling me that just the other day the French Ambassador was in buying a rather expensive necklace for your wife."
She seemed satisfied with that and leaned back into her chair.
Standing up and gently urging Chrissy to go stand next to Lily, Harry decided to try Eddy. "Eddy, you want to try it?" he offered.
A small insistent tug distracted Draco from his current discussion on Quidditch with Angelina and Ronald about. Tilting his head, Draco caught a flash of blond out of the corner of his eye and turned fully to see a small toddler pulling at his robes.
, when Dorian stabbed his friend, Basil, to death and left him locked in the room with the Portrait.
"Oh dear!" she exclaimed as Draco helped her right herself. "Thank you. I'm not usually this clumsy even with this big belly, but those fireplaces really make me dizzy," she said with a pleasant smile on her pretty face.
He passed it to James to sign, then Teddy, and Lily, then it finally passed back to him. Albus folded it in thirds then thirds again like he'd seen his dad do loads of times. Then sealing the folds with a sparkly unicorn sticker he'd stolen from Lily the week before, he carefully tied it to Artemis's leg. The owl was given instructions to take the letter directly to Scorpius and peck on his window until he opened it.
Malfoys were being friendly and charming to Potters of all sizes. Ron and Hermione are not going to believe this, he thought. But people changed after the war. Harry certainly had. Why couldn't the Malfoys?
Stepping into the vault, Harry couldn't figure out where to look first. There was furniture, jewels, clothing, and books, lots of books. Some of them had frayed spines, pages sticking out unevenly, and some of them looked pristine if a bit dusty. Harry could feel his fingers itching with the need to explore.
By the time he’d gotten control of himself, Harry’s stomached ached from laughing. “Alright,” he wheezed, his free hand pressed to his stomach. “I believe you.”
"But we weren't spying!" Scorpius exclaimed, frantic to minimize the amount of trouble they were definitely in.
Molly stepped up beside him and placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. "It wasn't your fault, dear," she said rubbing a nurturing, weathered hand over his back. "You couldn't have known Ginny would do something like this."
“Yes.” Andromeda smiled slightly at her. “Quite vehemently. He invited me to leave if I was going to continue to say disparaging things about your family.”
James nodded in agreement then asked, "Where do we look for that, then?"
Harry sat up from his lounging position and toyed with the leaves from a strawberry suddenly feeling self conscious. "Nobody knows about it. George knows, of course, but no one else. Not even Ron and Hermione." He took a deep breath realizing that he'd just told Draco Malfoy something that not even his two best friend's know about him.
"Good morning." Draco smiled at him leaning down to place a kiss on his forehead before he did the same to Albus next to him then James and Teddy on the other side of the table. He got to Lily and she just wrapped her arms around his neck and traded kisses on their cheeks.
"Missy Hermione is being in the library, Mistress," Frilly said with a solemn look on her elfin face.
business had been dropped in his lap.
That brought Harry up short, because it was completely true. As Parselmouths they were all considered the Masters of the Serpents. Snakes naturally obey whatever they tell them.
"Yes, well," Draco agreed with a wry smirk. "Don't we all."
Dudley clicked his tongue in mild frustration shaking his head. "Nah, Marianne's not like that. She was worried just as much as me when Chrissy suddenly disappeared to our roof. She's just happy our little girl is healthy and happy. You know how mothers are."
earlier this week."
"If you would begin eating," Lucius broke in coolly as he studied the two new arrivals, "I believe Scorpius has volunteered to give you a tour of the grounds. There is much to see."
He had come to a realization then that his little sister had gone completely around the bend. Ron would tear out his own heart before he gave up Hugo and Rose, so Ginny must actually be mental to give up James, Albus, and Lily. It made him ache with sadness and shame for his little sister.
Now, a third of the way through, Genevieve, the heroine, has met Vance, the handsome hero, and they've had mad, hot, wild, steamy, passionate-… three times already. And Narcissa couldn’t put the silly book down. The mindless little thing was addictive.
"I don't know about that, Albus. Being a Parselmouth is an inherited gift. It would be very difficult, if not impossible, to learn," Draco said as calmly as you please. Harry almost fainted.
"Grandfather, are we in trouble?" Scorpius asked tentatively.
Harry took a step forward and pretended to think it over as he lifted the snake from his daughter’s shoulders examining her closely. She was a very beautiful snake.
"That sounds... morbid," Draco murmured to him only to get a helpless shrug in response.
Lucius just rolled his eyes at his wife and went back to reading his Sunday
The rest of the evening went almost perfectly after that. The kids played themselves into the ground and the adults drank tea and wine and firewhiskey until everyone was feeling quite cheerful.
He held the stick level with his lips and with a mischievous wink at his cousin blew lightly at the wick until it burst into a small flame.
Narcissa let Teddy return to the other children, but she had a pensive look about her.
Soon, they had locked the vault up behind them and were once again in the cart zooming off through the tunnels faster than was strictly healthy.
"Now, normally," she continued, "this wouldn't be a problem seeing as the children have been instructed to keep away from them, but with all the other little ones running through the gardens this afternoon, it just wouldn't be possible to keep an eye on all of them at once."
Picking up her own perfectly polished silverware, she began to eat her pancakes and actually enjoy her breakfast for the first time since… well, a long time.
Mowgli is the name of the main character from the novel
"Is that true?" Lily asked after a moment of silence, her tiny voice hesitant. "You don't really want us?"
Draco studied Potter searching for anger or any sign of hostility. He found only curiosity and weariness. "I don't know honestly," he answered. "All I know is that you've got the shit end of the stick and my son has latched onto the teary eyed little boy I found in my shop like a Devil's Snare."
"Yeah, well. We'll make Albus and Lily do all the reading."
Harry grinned down at him still curled up against his chest. "I'd only ever heard that all the dark wizards came out of Slytherin and then I met you and you were the snottiest kid I'd ever met. You reminded me of my cousin Dudley, actually," he muttered absently then continued, "I saw you get Sorted into Slytherin and I just didn't want to be there."
“Hermione…” Ron was shocked immobile, near speechless.
"What?" Albus didn't have any more time to protest because Scorpius snagged his wrist and dragged him to the back of the store.
Lucius scolded him with such vehemence that Harry had no doubt he was missing something the older man felt so fundamental to his life. And he hadn’t even known he was missing something at all.
"It's not that hard, James," Lily chimed in from across the table. "Just look for the names Tonks, Lupin, Black, or Malfoy."
He was what Harry's children will be without their burdens of insecurity and the fear of abandonment.
Scorpius, Albus, Lily, James, Teddy, Belle, Tal, Mischief, Nova, and Stella sat on fluffy cushions up in Scorpius's play room. They were circled around the little low table covered snacks, a bowl of candy, a tray of sweets, and a pitcher of pumpkin juice. The adults were downstairs drinking tea and talking about boring adult things so the kids were free to plot uninterrupted.
"I don't know," Draco repeated peering at the fireplace intently. "It’s always worked before." He pulled his wand out and shot a half a dozen diagnostic spells at the hearth.
Blowing a heavy breath, Harry nodded and ran a hand through his hair. "It's alright, Draco. We'll come visit the Manor again soon. She just took me by surprise."
He cracked the black wax seal stamped with the Malfoy crest and quickly unfolded the letter.  Reading it, a grin stretched over his sleepy face. They had themselves a plan.
"Seven and four."
Only stopping when they were almost nose to nose, Harry had the fleeting thought that he was actually a couple of inches taller than Draco, then the entirety of his attention was taken up by something much more important. Smiling slowly, he raised his hands, cradled Draco’s cheeks, and threaded his fingers into that silky silver hair.
. Or at least that's what it looked like he was doing. He didn't exactly want anyone to know that he was reading the
Surprisingly, since it came from a Malfoy, the compliment meant a lot to him. "Thanks. Scorpius seems like a sweet kid, too."
Looking up from her snake, Lily grinned. "They were kissing."
"They both seem to be serious about their relationship." Narcissa steered the conversation back on point. "They have to be with the children involved."
They shared friendly goodbyes, then Harry was out the door and wishing he could get home just a little quicker than a floo ride. He’d been gone barely an hour and a half and he already missed his kids.
"I don't know, son," Draco responded just as quietly as he brushed back Scorpius's long bangs from his hopeful face. "We can't speak Parseltongue and I don't want what happened today to ever happen again."
Dark clouds of depression began forming over his head and he could practically see the ones hanging over his children. The situation was becoming dire and he was at a loss on how to make it all better.
"She didn't want to be around Scorpius at all?" It wasn’t really a question and it wasn’t tactful. Draco didn't seem to mind.
"Scorpius can come play anytime, Albus. As long as your dad's okay with it. You know how to floo, don't you, Potter?" he drawled at Harry with a mischievous glint in his eye. "And I'm sure even you can figure out how to owl," he added just for old time's sake and walked to the front entry holding his son's hand.
"Well, Potter," Draco said wryly after closing the door on yet another uninhabitable guestroom. "It seems like you're bunking with me."
But this could be his only chance to find out what had happened, Teddy thought. He looked around at his siblings and friend with determination. They all knew that look well. "We'll do it."
After that Draco couldn't remember much, but he knew that they'd laid the baby, his little sister, to rest in the family mausoleum at the very edge of their property. He knew that she'd gone unnamed as was Wizarding custom, but had been given a place of respect with the other Malfoys that had gone before her.
Scorpius gave him a small smile and shook his head. "No. Just my dad."
"Er... Yeah." Harry scratched at the base of his skull. "I've been... busy."
They traveled the rest of the way to Gringotts in silence, both men watching the stunned crowds around them cautiously. Harry's hand hovered over his wand in his holster and Lucius's grip tightened on his snakehead cane.
The kids trailed after him completely absorbed by their new pets. They didn't see how people gasped as they walked past or how the other shoppers cleared a path for them. It was almost like when the war had first ended and everyone was in awe of the Savior except decidedly more alarmed.
"Alright." Harry grinned at his kids. "Let's get this over with."
There was a chocked sound at the other end of the table and a muffled laugh, but Lucius ignored it. He also ignored the heated blush starting at the top of his ears, but that's neither here nor there.
"What has he invested in now?" he repeated. Draco not having completely answered his question.
"It is ironic," he began after a time, "that they should dislike each other so ardently, fight against each other so viciously when they were children only to grow up, have children of their own and fall in love with one another."
"Ugh." Draco scrunched his nose up and shuddered with memories of his father's mother. The woman was a nightmare. "When is she coming for a visit, again?" he asked wishing she would just stay in France where she was spawned.
Albus shrugged at her a half apologetic smile on his face. "Moon," he answered quietly. "Tal and the others call me Moon."
look. "Explain."
As she began to usher him away, shaking out his overwhelmed haze, Scorpius seemed to remember the lessons his own grandmother and bestowed on him and paused in his steps. "Thank you for inviting us, Mrs. Weasley," he intoned formally, a little nervously.
Skyclad is a Wiccan term that refers to the practice of being naked during rituals.
"Okay, right." He rolled his eyes and continued. "Dad said that Sirius was my cousin through Grandma, so we should start looking at the Black family."
"Your inarticulateness has done absolutely nothing to diminish how terrifyingly happy that sentence just made me." He breathed deeply and squeezed Harry almost painfully tight around the middle. "You really believe that, Harry?" Draco asked hopefully. "That you'd be alright with being a father to Scorpius and you'd be alright with me being a father to your kids?"
Harry burst out laughing. “Shut up! You used to kiss Snape’s ass all the time.”
When he was gone again, Marianne turned to level an unreadable look on Draco. "They're servants."
The snake shook its head. “
He lifted his humus, eggplant, and tabbouleh wrap to his mouth and took a healthy bite. Lucius chewed thoughtfully and swallowed tentatively. When it didn't immediately come back up, he figured it didn't taste so bad and took another bite, this one more eager than the first.
Luna just released his hand turned around in a circle still studying the room intently. "Oh, it was no problem," she answered airily. "Harry asked me especially, and you sent a very interesting letter. I'm really quite curious now." She smiled again.
Harry is stumbling over the wreckage Ginny left in her wake and all he can do is try to pick up the pieces. He gets some help from a surprisingly familiar face.
Harry chuckled with a feeling of relief at his cousin’s seemingly easy acceptance. He was also grateful for Dudley's limited scope of understanding when it came to the Wizarding World. "Yeah, Dud. The kids can handle the snakes. Besides, I told them I'd skin them and make belts out of them if they ever hurt one of my kids."
"I always thought all of your money was inherited."
Harry stepped up to one of the goblins at the front desk and placed two keys on the marble counter. "I would like access to these two vaults," he requested politely.
"Coming inside, Potter. Honestly you are a terribly host, you know that?" Draco interrupted again. He seemed to be good at that. "Why don't you introduce me to the pretty young lady barnacled onto your side?"
The guilt and feelings of uselessness had not disappeared all together (Harry feared they never would), but Draco had a way of making everything seem like it was going to be alright. Which was ironic considering how much time he’d spent making Harry's life difficult back in school.
"Um, yes? Kind of?" Why did he feel like a twelve year-old again with Lucius looking at him like that?
"Mr. Malfoy." Shacklebolt nodded politely as he stood up and reached across the desk to shake his hand. "I'm glad you could come. Please, have a seat."
Coming out of her thoughts, Narcissa continued into the room and pasted a pleasantly bland, attentive smiled on her face. Her hostess skills were so ingrained that they would bend for no one.
Nova and Stella were Teddy's brother and sister dwarf snakes. They reminded Harry of a couple reptilian beach bums. He was informed that their Chameleon was a very righteous little dude and that they were very psyched about his "skin shedding" ability. Harry couldn't help, but think they fit Teddy perfectly.
Days later Harry sat at the picnic table in the Burrow’s backyard snapping green beans while the children ran and chased each other in the field behind the house.
Lucius took a deep breath and pierced each child with a stern glare. "I want an explination, every single detail." The kids sat close mouthed, completely petrified. "Now!" he barked.
A shrill ringing echoed through the house and Harry nearly jumped out of his skin in surprise. The telephone was ringing he realized.
James frowned in confusion. "What does that matter?"
Draco and Scorpius nearly split themselves open laughing at the unlikely parade that tumbled into their receiving room. Their guests nearly knocked each other to the floor when the traveling pairs didn’t jump out of the grate fast enough.
None of them wanted Lily to get upset if they found more unpleasant things in their family's history. Plus, they'd been at it for hours and Lily was still young enough to get cranky when she was tired. Or at least, that's what they told themselves. They didn’t want to admit that all this reading about bad stuff happening to people they knew was getting to them, too.
"Are you sure?" Harry asked dubiously.
(1982) starring Julie Andrews, where Robert Preston's character, Toddy, mentions that the only woman he ever slept with was named Nanna LaNou... and she had an adam's apple "like a coconut".
"Why is it a nightmare?" she asked unable to hide her happy smile. "They sound wonderful. Draco sounds wonderful. Granted," she tilted her head in concession, "there is no love lost between us and the Malfoys, but the Wizarding World has changed so much since the end of the war. I don't see a reason why the Malfoys should be denied the chance to make amends and change themselves the way everyone else has."
Molly and Arthur had sat him down in the kitchen shoved a plate of leftovers at him and forced him to drink half a pot of tea before they looked at him with somber, tired faces and began to explain.
"I said, are you okay?" the little boy with silvery blond hair and gray eyes asked again in concern. He was dressed in nice clean robes and he inched closer to Albus cautiously, his brow furrowing. "Why are you crying?"
"Here we are!" he called plastering on a smile to hide the emotions still roiling through him. Three of the four children turned their whole and undivided attention toward him. "These are the stables. Let's go meet the horses, shall we?"
James frowned confused then shrugged. “
Dudley lifted his head, a flash of hope shining in his still somewhat beady eyes. "How do we do that?"
"Calm yourself, Potter!" Lucius snapped, straightening the few hairs that had fallen out of their ribbon when the magical wave had hit them. "That should have worked exactly like a wand. Either you feel a small tingle of power or you feel nothing. There should have been absolutely no- none of what just occurred."
"Oh, yes!" she chirped happily and shook his hand. "I'm Marianne Dursley, Dudley's wife. It's very exciting to be here." She grinned and rubbed absently at her large belly. "We've only ever been to Grimmauld before, this is the first really magical house we've been to."
The next few visits went famously for everyone involved. Each one started out with conspiratorial grins exchanged among the kids and, when they were at the Manor, knowingly amused looks from Lucius and Narcissa.
“Everything?” Harry breathed trying to stay calm. “What ‘everything’? Make me understand, Ginny, because I have been going crazy trying to figure out what could possibly be so bad that you would just up and leave our kids like that.”
Harry laughed. "Oh quiet, you. Why don't you go outside and say hi to James, Albus, and Lily. They'll be happy to see you." He put his godson down and watched as the little ten year-old scampered out the backdoor and bounded through the yard with an ear splitting shout that was promptly answered by his cousins.
On the plus side they would have no problem going to sleep that night.
"Yes, Master," the elf squeaked and disappeared right as the door opened.
A speculative look came over Lily's face and she turned her head to look up, first at Draco who was laughing in delight at something Harry said then at her father who was grinning back pleased with himself.
Harry cleared his throat. "Teddy's my godson. Professor Lupin, you remember him, was his father. His grandmother is letting me keep him for a bit to give her a rest." He smiled sheepishly. "I should have told you he was coming, I'm sorry."
"Oh no, Mother," Draco groaned. "They won’t want anything from me."
Smirking, Draco nodded and pulled Harry back into a deeper kiss. “You better get started on that, Potter, because the chicks always leave the nest before you’re ready.”
"Yes, well, one does not just toss out family heirlooms, do they?"
Harry was reluctantly impressed by how well she was taking all this. Usually when people hear Parseltongue they run for hills, but she’s handled it pretty well considering.
Harry stared at her for a moment, but still couldn't stop placing most of the blame on himself. He should have seen it, or been there, or something. Maybe none of this would have happened.
Curious, Lucius asked, "Why wouldn't they wish to stay with their Weasley grandparents?"
James shook his head and gently lifted her out of the tank. “
The snake lifted his head from Albus's shoulder and looked him right in the eyes again. “
"Da-ad! Har-ry! Stop snogging! We don't want to see it!" Scorpius whined in protest.
"Yeah," he sighed, still staring at the moon. "That would be great."
Hissing interspersed with English caught Draco's attention and he turned his head to see Albus and Scorpius sitting in the grass on the other side of Harry, Albus’s snake Tal curled between them.
It had taken a lot for Grimmauld to feel healthy again. Harry had to exorcise the house’s Darkness like a doctor would cut away cancerous tumors. A troll leg here, a shrieking painting there, a house-elf head here until the infection was gone and the healing could begin.
"You must be, Edward." Draco smiled kindly at him as he took out his wand and banished the soot clinging to the boy's cheek. "I'm Draco." He held out a hand for the boy to shake.
They spent an hour more in the stables petting spoiled horses and indulging the children's curiosity then they moved out to a pond the size of a lake. Narcissa called a house-elf to supply them with old bread and the kids started trying to peg the ducks with bits of crust completely ignoring the bread’s intended purpose.
"Well," Harry began as he stepped up to the table and pulled out a chair, George following behind him just as eager as the children to hear the story. "The first time was when your Uncle Dudley turned eleven."
Despite the Manor's enormous fireplace they still had a little bit of a backup.
Hurriedly, he bent to pick up the bowl, not broken thankfully, and straightened, his eyes never leaving Andromeda.
"You smell like cookies," he rumbled distractedly, his hands splayed wide over Draco's lower back.
Drying his hands he moved back to the kitchen table and took a seat across from her. Not for the first time Harry was struck by just how much she resembled her insane dead sister. He brushed the thought aside and focused on her words.
They sat in silence for a time before Draco decided he had better dispel the heavy atmosphere again. Moving his hand form Harry's shoulder up to ruffle his thick, surprisingly soft hair, he grinned. "So, Mr. Potter, you are a successful business investor, eh?"
Cool gray eyes regarded him before Lucius turned his head away and stepped onto the street heading towards Gringotts. "She was with you in the Department of Mysteries," Lucius remembered blandly, as if talking of the weather. "She was braver even than a few of my own Death Eaters that night."
"Yeah," Harry breathed turning slightly wild eyes on her. "It's not just Draco either. It's the whole bloody family. Scorpius is such a great kid, I could so easily love him like I love James and Albus and Lily and Teddy." He tugged at his hair in frustration.
"Six and three."
"What's so funny?" Draco asked as he stepped into the room. The laughter abruptly died and his parents schooled their features into pleasantly bland masks. He looked around the room with suspicion.
"Sure it is, Malfoy," called a grinning Ron from the kitchen door to the backyard . "It's good of you to join us," he said completely genuinely as he stepped forward and held out his hand.
A warm smile curved over Narcissa Malfoy's perfect face. "It is quite our pleasure, Mr. Potter. You have charming children," she informed him elegantly.
"Harry," Draco breathed as he sat up and moved closer to him, pressing their faces together and squeezing his eyes closed to the fear and sadness he felt.
"I have no idea, but it's delicious," Draco mumbled around his food causing Scorpius to mock scold him for talking with his mouthful. He shot his son an exaggerated glare and made a show of chewing with his mouth open just to spite.
"I don't believe Mr. Malfoy would ever follow such a horrible wizard like Voldemort." Lily scowled, indignant at the very idea.
Draco stared at him for a moment feeling immeasurable warmth burst in his chest and expand outward. This amazing beautiful man could not have said anything else more perfect to make Draco fall even more in love with him. A stinging hit him in the back of the eyes and he looked away so Harry wouldn't see the shine in them.
"Yeah," Harry gritted. "That's her."
Looking back up at the seemingly annoyed, frowning wizard, Albus smiled bashfully at him. "Tal says he's sorry for being rude."
” hissed a snake from right up against the tank wall making James jump in surprise.
Harry just snorted and shook his head. "Your grandmother would have a fit if I let you go home carting a giant boa constrictor."
Turning his earnest green eyes on him, Harry nodded. "After the floo broke I was pretty out of it. I was helping her look after the grandchildren one day and she dragged it out of me."
Her laughter coming to a natural end, Narcissa reached out and grasped Lucius’s hand to get his attention. “What was it you wanted, dear? You were growling about something when you came in here.”
” he responded sternly.
"Oh yes. He never looks at anyone else, but me like that. It would appear our James Sirius has found himself a friend." Draco grinned at him and strode forward to lavish his own attention on the horse.
"Yeah," Harry replied, a smile plain in his voice. "I think the kids have been angling for that anyway, so why disappoint them." Stroking his fingertips over Draco’s lips, Harry tipped his face toward his. "Besides, I already love Scorpius like I love Teddy. He's not blood, but he might as well be for all the difference it makes."
In lieu of a disbelieving snort, Harry couldn't help, but raise an eyebrow. Lucius’s smirk grew even wider.
into the lighting gutter like Lucius had at the Potter vault.
Harry apparated away without another word. Ginny sat on the beach staring out at the ocean with tears rolling down her cheeks until the sun disappeared from the sky.
Reflexively taking a tall, sweating glass, Andromeda sipped at it lightly before setting it back down again. She didn’t know quite what to do with her hands. “Harry told me that his children and your grandson have become friends.”
"I bumped into someone and fell," Albus mumbled shyly. Scorpius's dad seemed really nice, but he was also intimidating. He looked elegant and put together. He studied the blond man's fancy robes, his eyes tracing the embroidery on the cuffs.
He groaned and wrapped both arms around her, burying his face in her neck giving it a light nip. "I'm not a young man anymore, Narcissa. I don't think I'll be up for more tonight unless I want to miss the Minister in the morning."
He suppressed an amused smirk and went back to watching his kids pick out their snakes.
James smiled at him the turned back to running his eyes over all the snakes trying to find the perfect one.
Seeing the reddening looks on their faces, Draco decided to interrupt the father-son bonding moment before it devolved into tears on either side."Come on, Potter. Don't be so hard on the kid. He spent most of the afternoon stuffing his face with cookies in my shop with Scorpius. Nothing happened to him. He's perfectly fine. No reason to sick Granger on the poor boy."
Draco rolled his eyes and watched the little emergency triage the house-elves set up off to one side. "I have no clue, Father. She's your wife and she won't listen to me."
The longer he looked at the tapestry the surer Harry was that there had to be some kind spatial magic involved in its making. No matter how far to the right or left he looked, the names never stopped, the velvet never ended and yet, when he took a step back, the tapestry didn’t look never ending.
"Your father's going to ward the gardens," she informed him as she sat down and poured herself a cup of tea.
"No, no," Ron said visibly trying to calm himself. "It's alright. I don't know what has been going on with her lately. She's just been getting worse." He deflated a bit and sighed tiredly. "She even snapped at Hugo yesterday. I've never seen her seriously raise her voice to either of our children before."
“She knows that. Andromeda wouldn’t disappoint her grandson, I’m sure. She’ll come around.” Draco placed a chaste kiss on the corner of Harry’s mouth then pulled away, returning to his afternoon tea.
Sighing heavily Harry nodded. “I know.”
"What did you and Father discuss this afternoon?" Draco asked as they sat on the patio watching the kids playing in the gardens.
Hermione lifted her head and stared into the darkness around them unseeingly. "I just keep asking myself, why? What did I do that would have caused it? How could I have let it happen?"
Pictures of what the
Jumping away from the door, Harry was half expecting another horrible family portrait to appear howling and cursing at him, but soon he realized that it was just the rusted hinges of the door screaming in protest. The door swung agonizingly slowly on its own, the shrieks and groans of metal didn’t stop until it halted it’s swing abruptly, leaving the vault completely open.
"Lucius," the woman called from the doorway in a displeased and thoroughly commanding tone. "Aren't you going to greet your own mother? Or are you too busy with your guests?" She flicked her gray eyes over the syrupy children and the three non-familial adults with barely controlled disdain.
He tapped a long finger on his chin and squinted trying to remember. "Then there was a Dorea Black that married a Charlus Potter. They would be your," he lifted a hand and counted silently on his fingers, "great-great-grandparents."
"Whoa," he breathed, giving Lucius an impressed look that was met with another roll of his sharp gray eyes.
"Sweet?" He sneered in disgust. "It's sweet that our grandson is trying to make his father fall in love with Potter? Yes, how very sweet."
"Mr. Potter," Lucius began after a long moment of silence. "Why is it that you would choose me to approach with such an offer?" he asked sounding genuinely curious, or as genuine as Lucius Malfoy could ever be.
Draco and Harry relaxed as the kids played. They talked about everything and nothing, just enjoying the cool evening air and their children's laughter. It felt comfortable and right. Both men were loath to think about when Draco had to floo with Scorpius back to the Manor at the end of their visit.
The rest of breakfast was served soon after that and everyone ate contentedly. The kids laughed and giggled and regaled their parents with stories from the night before, while Harry and Draco took the opportunity to just enjoy being all together for a quiet, late morning breakfast. They trading knowing looks and tangled their bare feet together under the table.
"He's not much like Malfoy was when we were younger?"
and back to Lucius before translating. "He asked if he can read the
Harry smiled apologetically. "I would like that, yeah. George doesn't really have a problem with him and your mum's alright with it."
"This afternoon?" Harry asked, a little strained.
"Damn it, Narcissa! Where the hell are my good boots?" Lucius cursed the next morning as he rushed around their suite trying to get dressed.
"I can imagine." Draco nodded solemnly. "I can tell they’re taking Ginevra's absence hard."
"Right, just don't ruin your dinners," he cautioned them, playing along. He shot Harry a pointed look, but the other man just had a vaguely puzzled wrinkle to his brow. Draco realized he was the only one that had picked up on the clues.
"And this Harry Potter is happy enough to impose upon my darling son's hospitality, but to not offer up his own?" she remarked with affected lightness and surprise.
Draco was seated on the stone laid patio with the kids sprawled around him. Narcissa was sitting primly at the table next to them sipping her tea and chuckling along to the story. Whatever it was it must be very funny.
Draco looked at him searchingly for a moment in the heavy silence that had fallen over the kitchen. Finally he nodded and covered one of Harry's hands with his. "She's not always that foul. It's sort of like a game to her. She's wretched to everyone when she firsts steps out of the floo until either my mother or I kick the stick out of her ass. Then she's just mildly unpleasant."
She wasn’t all that hard to find once Harry had narrowed down the islands. There were only so many Caribbean islands he could comb through before finally stumbling upon his wife.
Discretion being the better part of valor, Draco flashed him an uncertain smile before hesitantly asking the Weasley son, Charles, to pass the peas.
He felt a pang in his chest at that thought. Ginny was his little sister and he would always love her, but for leaving Harry and the kids he could never forgive her. It didn’t matter what her excuses were, Ron wouldn’t forgive her for taking the easy way out.
: sends your opponent flying backwards.
"That's right, my dear." Narcissa nodded. "In fact, I believe we have some Narcissus and Dancing Chrysanthemums in the gardens. Would you both like to see them?"
What followed was ten minutes of George sipping his tea in silence thinking it all over.
Teddy was quiet for a time, then mumbled, "I hope so, too. I like the Malfoys and I want her to like them, too. It would suck if she hates them when Harry and Draco get married."
Harry grimaced and rubbed uncomfortably at his neck, unwilling to say anything.
"Well, you are much sweeter than these two," she said and patted his cheek with a tad more condescension than was necessary. "Perhaps you got that from your mother." She looked back up and the little bit of softness that had come over her evaporated like mist.
Except for Teddy's two little snakes, they were all good sized reptiles. Thankfully, the shop attendant informed him that they were pretty well matured. They should stop growing soon so he wouldn’t have to worry about them reaching epic proportions.
He scoffed at himself. His kids already had snakes, before too long he’d be running his own zoo if he let it get out of hand.
And what about Draco? He thought, still staring up at the moon.
The little elf popped into being directly in front of Lucius and shot discrete unseen glance a Scorpius. "Yes, Master Malfoy?" he squeaked, trying not to sound guilty.
The little boy was just short of a year younger than James and stepped forward with more confidence than his little sister had before him. "I want green sparks," he announced decisively.
"Eeeew!" Albus drawled in mock disgust. "That's gross!"
Clearing his throat, Harry stepped toward the opposite side of the bed from Draco. "Yeah, thanks. Your bathroom is amazing."
"Don't 'hi dad' me!" Harry scolded. Suddenly the fear and worry came crashing down on him. The thought of losing Albus, any of his children, made his heart pound painfully. "Where on earth have you been? I've been worried sick. I called the Aurors, and the Minister, and your Aunt Hermione!"
"Well, let's move on, shall we?" he suggested forcefully, looking down to read through the rest of the papers. Finally he laid them down and began rubbing at his temples. This agreement was already giving him a headache. He just positively couldn’t wait to get started.
Teddy celebrates a wizarding milestone with everyone he loves. It turns out the adults need more supervision than the kids.
"Snakes? How could the snakes know?" Lucius asked incredulously.
"Yes." Draco nodded. "She's actually quite fascinating once you get a little tea and whiskey into her."
"That's great, Dudley." Harry smiled genuinely. "How are Edward and Chrissy?"
"Yeah!" they cheered. Teddy grinning, flushed, and happy came forward and let Draco pull him into an extra tight hug.
Draco took a sip of his lemonade before answering. "Just this and that really," he hedged nervously. "I brew some custom healing potions from my own recipes and sell a few packaged baked goods that I make as well."
Lily kept running, her head down, dodging witches and wizards left and right, her eyes fastened unwaveringly on her -thankfully- brightly colored companion. She trusted Belle to not lead her astray, so she concentrated on keeping up with the snake and not losing sight of her underneath all those feet.
"I know," he thought as his beloved wife shook in his arms with the effort of controlling her grief.
"When was the first time?" Teddy asked curiously, his hair a strange mottled brown-green pattern.
"Yeah." He stared down at the grass, toeing at it with his boot. "I’m not angry anymore, but I don't think I'll ever forgive her for what she did. I know I'm not a saint in all this, but I couldn't ever imagine deserting my kids like that."
He glanced toward his wife to find her in a rather impassioned conversation with the little Lily about the little girl's snake and decided to keep his own council for the time being. There will be time enough to discuss their son's potential love life, but for now the matter will rest.
Harry smiled back and shook his head. "Not today. But you will be able to deliver her on time?" he asked a little nervously.
Harry snorted and sipped at his own drink. "Are you complaining?"
Only the offspring of a Potter, a Malfoy, and a Marauder would think they could pull off such a plan. And wouldn’t you know it, they did.
The tilt of his head, the way he absently tucked a lock of silver blond hair behind his ear, the amused glint in his intelligent gray eyes. It was all really distracting. Considering he couldn’t for the life of him keep his gaze from sliding back to Draco it seemed like he didn’t actually mind the distraction all that much.
"That's what grandma said and Harry didn't say she was wrong," Teddy confirmed. "Are you worried about that now?"
God, he really hoped Teddy liked his gift.
Andromeda suppressed a scowl. She might have deserved that tone. There had been no reason for her to be rude, to be suspicious of the boy. He was baking cookies for God's sake. He wasn’t rigging the house to blow, but even so. She hadn't had contact with her family in decades, was resolved to continue to despise them. It had thrown her to see her younger sister's son standing so domestically in Harry's kitchen.
Harry had wasted no time and began searching high and low for his wife. He had sickening ideas of what he might find. He just hoped he was wrong and it was all just a misunderstanding.
Glancing at Lucius over the top of the document, he asked, "Where did you get a Quick Quotes Quill that actually got everything right?"
"Gah!" he yelp and jumped back from it with a hand pressed to his pounding heart, the children’s giggles sounding from behind him. "Is it supposed to do that?" he demanded with a scowl at his lover.
"I had to tell Ron and Hermione about us the other night when we went to dinner at their place," Harry confessed.
"Do you have a problem with sharing?" Draco asked almost petulantly not liking the thought that Harry might indeed have a problem with sharing a bed with him. He thought they were friends, the thought he was squeamish about being so close to him didn’t sit well with Draco.
Sending a grateful look at Ron, Harry relaxed a fraction and took a sip of his drink. He shouldn't have been surprised that Ron was being so good about this. He'd matured a lot over the years.
A bark of laughter, an ugly unhappy sound, fell from his lips. "I should be thankful she dropped the kids off with her parents before she grabbed the first international portkey available she was that far gone."
Lucius snorted. "Potter I can see not noticing a plot when it’s right under his nose, but Draco astonishes me. It's not as though the children’s machinations were all that complicated."
Molly gave her an understanding smile and nodded her head sagely. "Well, that's quite alright. With the wards I doubt anyone will get more than a skinned knee. Your mother-in-law planted them, you say?"
She nodded sadly against his shoulder and sniffled.
Harry stared dumbstruck. "Albus?"
A choked retching noise came from Lucius and Harry had to laugh. "Calm down, Malfoy," he chuckled. "It's not that big of a deal. I don't have the other two anymore, so it's not like I'm all powerful or anything."
They degenerated into comfortable silence once more, each of them with different things on their minds.
"What sort of investing does your father do now?" he asked curiously.
"Yeah," Albus murmured, “and that was when they still had Dementors as guards there."
” Belle asked curiously. She did not understand human customs of family living separately.
Teddy's mouth fell open and Scorpius ceased his bouncing. The children all looked at each other with varying degrees of surprised then they all broke out into triumphant grins and cheered.
Lucius let the subject drop, but eyed the staff warily as they edged past it on their journey around the room.
Harry thought about his cousin's concerns for a moment before saying, "You know, Dudley, if she is a witch you could enroll her in a wizarding primary school. She wouldn't be the freak in school then. Or she could be taught by my mother-in-law. Molly taught all of her kids before they left for Hogwarts and is teaching most of her grandkids as well."
Harry chuckled. "Good man."
"Call me, George." George grinned then winked at him. "If you call all of us Weasley, we'll never figure out who you're talking to."
But wasn't that true for most marriages?
He held his breath waiting for their situation to really hit Draco and the inevitable fallout that would follow.
Then he’d noticed it at the Burrow; the almost mischievous, nurturing warmth of the place. It felt quirky, and odd, and too full, but always welcoming to more, and forever filled with love and cheer.
The four Weasleys departed and Harry and Draco were left in the kitchen sipping their tea. Harry still looked worried and doubtful.
The room went absolutely silent and all the fiery heads turned to stare until Harry and Lily stepped out behind them.
"Family tree?" he suggested. "Dad's godfather was Sirius Black, right?" James gave him a look that said quite plainly, "duh".
"I'll never get used to that," Dudley muttered rubbing at the back of his neck as Harry just grinned at him and picked up the stick of dark green wax.
They were just about to debate which room Harry should sleep in when Tipsy, one of the maintenance house-elves, appeared with some rather unexpected news.
"No, I guess not," he conceded with a wry smirk of his own. "But I’m not here to discuss family heirlooms." Well, not the Malfoy family heirlooms anyway.
Chuckling as she huffed at him and waved him away so that she could fix the curl he'd dislodged, Lucius said, "I'll be back for lunch. I'll tell you about the meeting then."
Teddy and James quickly joined the fray putting their collective strength behind the effort. And absolutely nothing happened. The handle stayed in one place and the drawer stuck like it was welded closed. It didn't even creak.
"Albus!" Scorpius exclaimed. Unable to contain himself any longer he threw himself across the room into Albus's equally ecstatic arms for a tight hug.
Harry snapped his mouth closed and he jerked his gaze up at the sign for the shop in front of them.
"I really did it?" she asked, wonderingly.
Andromeda’s head snapped up to look at Harry. "What?"
"What do you mean? Dad killed Voldemort and Uncle Ron and Aunt Hermione helped him, that's it." James frowned, confused.
"Whichever you want, Dud,” Harry chuckled. “So, what's up? How's Marianne?" he inquired sincerely. Marianne Dursley was a surprisingly sweet woman and Harry had often wondered what exactly possessed her to marry Dudley in the first place.
Albus nodded in agreement “It is pretty cool.” Scorpius sagged in relief.
A chuckle broke out of him, relieved that Draco’s lighthearted attitude kept him from overthinking their situation. Harry nodded in agreement and they started shuffling everyone off to their temporary sleeping arrangements.
“Oh!” Narcissa jumped in surprised, pressing a hand to her chest as she looked down at the nervous house-elf standing next to the table. She’d been so
Harry's brow creased in confusion. "What do you mean?"
” the snake hissed at him with what constituted as a pleading look for a reptile.
"Where are Lucius and Narcissa?" Harry asked as he sipped his cool minty alcoholic beverage and leaned back on his hands. The kids were once again tormenting the ducks and geese down by the pond. He and Draco were leisurely sitting out of the way on the grass in the shade of an ancient tree watching the action.
In a way the Manor reminded Harry of himself, too. He’d never let all the pain and despair in his life stop him from living, from moving on and being happy.
Teddy had to commend her commitment to her acting role, but Harry looked really mad. It was time for the next part of the plan to distract him. He nudged Albus and gave him a meaningful look.
Narcissa hummed thoughtfully. "But how will they get here? The Manor is unplottable and hidden from muggle eyes. They can't even floo in."
"Then you shall have your own room, Miss Lily," he declared making her grin happily up at him.
Chuckling, Draco shrugged. “When I was eleven I loved it. Got to show off my new gifts and mingle with society's elite.”
"Mother, would you like to explain that to me?" Draco asked after she'd sipped at her cooling tea and steadied herself.
"Molly-Wobbles!" Arthur gasped in outrage, sharing an alarmed look with Lucius. "Why don't we grab a plate and eat a little something before the other guests arrive, dear?"
"You had no right, Harry!” Andromeda violently slapped a hand on the table in frustration and anger. “No right to let those prejudice blood supremacists anywhere near Teddy."
Andromeda opened her mouth to protest, but the words choked off and she simply stared at him in shock.
Draco was overwhelmed with horror and anger.
“Pardon me,” came a familiar voice from behind him, “Surely you wouldn’t judge a young boy on the actions of his father? Here I thought Dumbledore would expect more tolerance from his staff.”
At this, Draco looked at Harry questioning, his eyes still shining with emotion and slightly red-rimmed from crying. “But then, how did his account end up in the Black Family Vault? A disowned family member doesn't have access to the Family vaults.
Olivander smiled again, speaking softly, “Cedar, with a core of unicorn hair.”
With that thought in mind, Harry left immediately with the portkey, wrapping it in his cloak to avoid touching it until he stepped outside. When his stomach settled from the travel… he still hated portkeys… he began to walk around the island.
Credit, love and thanks to Kaede-marie and Ghostie for working with me on this chapter. Couldn't do it without them! Love as always to all of my Lovely Larks and all of my new friends for their continued support!
Draco stumbled, falling to the ground from the unexpected blow. His father had moved so fast that he hadn’t anticipated the backhand. Within a moment, Draco stood, knowing that staying on the ground would only make his father call him a coward.
Healer Edwards was sitting at his desk working through a large stack of files when Harry knocked on the door. “Well,” Healer Edwards said, sounding slightly shocked, “that certainly was fast!”
By the time they’d arrived at the robe shop, Harry felt completely out of his element and was beginning to think Hagrid had forgotten he’d only just learned about magic. His hopelessness was only magnified when he’d met someone his age while getting fit for his school robes. The boy had stared at him, and Harry had figured he was going to comment on his scar like everyone else. He’d been surprised when the boy had apologized for staring and explained his nerves.
"There now, that's much better, isn't it?"
The cat went back to tormenting the toad, and Harry shook his head in amusement, unable to resist teasing him a bit, “Well now, aren’t you adorable, taking down that nasty toad?” Draco apparently did not find this funny, as he turned and actually growled at Harry, followed by a stream of yowls. He swore he could almost hear the curse words Draco was using.
“Very well then,” Healer Edwards said, clapping his hands together. Let's get you back to the exam room and see what we are working with here.”
Healer Edwards returned the smile for a moment before a serious frown crossed his face. He bent down to Harry’s level, looked him in the eyes, and spoke gently, “I think your home situation is less than ideal.”
“He is—”
“Yes, Uncle Sev,” he nodded.
Merlin appeared to be pleased, but halted him once again, “Hold on Draco. Before you agree to this, I need to make a request of you.”
nearly blurring his vision as he started to write. He was careful to avoid the parchment, but otherwise let them fall freely down his face. For several minutes, he poured his sorrow, anger, and grief onto the parchment. When he felt he couldn’t say anything else, he ended the letter with an apology for bearing his burdens and hopes that Harry would understand. Before he could second guess himself, Draco signed and addressed the letter, summoned his owl, and sent it off. As alien as it felt to be that open with another person, his instincts were telling him that doing so would help them both in the end. Difficult as it was, he was going to trust them.
“How did you get me out of there? You insisted we leave our wands behind!” Draco said, confused and irritated.
Sirius paused a moment, his irritation at the map evident in his face.
'' in enormous gold letters. The whole thing was large enough that even Harry could see it clearly at a distance.
Harry would do what he could to help him. As for being friends? Only time would tell.
“Apologies, Madam, of course,” he began, “I’ve found a hidden room in the castle. It can provide whoever summons it with anything they require.”
“Of course, Harry!” Hermione beamed. Ron nodded wordlessly.
When the day came for Draco to journey to Diagon Alley, he found that at first, things happened much as they had the first time. His mother was ecstatic at the prospect of taking him to buy his wand, school supplies, and his owl. His father had scolded her heavily for fawning over Draco and insisted he be sent off on his own. His mother had heavily protested, but his father had only allowed her to give him a proper list before ushering her off without another word.
Harry turned toward Draco, wordlessly requesting his opinion. Draco studied him for only a moment before exclaiming, “They look brilliant, Harry! Much better than those horrid old things.” Harry laughed, “Thanks, mate. I won’t need to try on any others. I’m going to take these back to Healer Edwards.”
Draco huffed in disbelief, “I did try! The infernal thing was like Devil’s Snare!”
When they walked through the doors of the eye-care center, Harry’s eyes widened at the sight before him. There was so much chaos he couldn’t tell how anything got done. Glasses flew through the air in all directions, some to shelves and some through an archway leading to the back of the office. They arranged themselves over and over, some even knocking each other off to try to take a space.
When he opened his eyes, he flailed in surprise at the beam of white light shooting towards him, causing him to nearly drown in his attempt to dodge whatever attack this was.
“I need you to promise that you won’t reveal anything I am about to tell you, Kreacher.”
His performance had the desired effect: her face grew impossibly swollen and flushed the same colour pink as her office. “That’s very nice to hear, Mr. Malfoy. It would have been rather… unfortunate… if you were no longer able to perform your duties,” she smiled sweetly at him.
The information for Tala in this story was taken from The Monster Blog of Monsters. I based her physiology on the Pygmy/Anthill Python and came up with a few specifics for myself. We will learn more about Lyra in the next chapter. Please review with questions, comments, or things you would like to see happen!
It overwhelmed him… lifted up and drowned him all at once, and he collapsed to the ground, feeling no shame in his emotions. The one who initiated a bond was always the most affected by its acceptance.
My hope is that with everything balancing out here, and my lovely new beta Yuvika kicking me in the tail, it won't take me too long to update.
“What are you talking about?” Draco asked, utterly confused.
Edited 10/05!
He was shocked when his mother pulled him into a tight hug, releasing him after a moment and placing her hand gently on his head. Something had changed between them since his return; she had never shown him affection like this in public.
Mentions of violence, mentioning of blood, OC character death, nothing too explicit. Implied sexual activity, nothing explicit.
Things are changing without Umbridge around. A relationship begins to evolve, leading to an unexpected confrontation.
As he approached, number 12 appeared in its dramatic way, shoving the neighboring houses aside. “Go inside and ask Kreacher to allow me entrance,” Draco whispered to the air next to him, “From what I understand, the house would allow me entrance because of my magic, but he’s been alone for six years. I don’t want to enter unannounced,” he paused, thinking he should probably warn Dobby. “Be careful, Dobby. The house is not in good condition, and Kreacher is a bit mad, but he needs to be treated with kindness. Explain to him that I am a Malfoy and that my mother is Narcissa Black. Hopefully, that will be enough for him to allow us in.”
Harry took a breath and stood, wiping tears of mirth from his eyes. There was a teasing light in his eyes as he said, “Back to Potter now are we? And here I thought we were at least on a first-name basis.”
I want to thank Merlioske and Yuvika for their wonderful work as betas with this chapter. Their ideas, patience, and encouragement helped get me through to the end. Their links will be at the bottom, as well as another note discussing this chapter in particular, as well as plans for the future.
He didn't wait for Draco's agreement and left the room without another word. Draco sat, stunned, his earlier hopes returning. He knew he couldn't risk anyone seeing the emotions in his eyes or the exhaustion on his face, even at this time of night; so he spent some time in the alcove calming himself until he was sure no one would notice any difference. Once he was satisfied, he swiftly made his way to the dungeons. The common room was empty and everyone in his house was already asleep, at least from what he could tell. He was just barely able to dress and lock his curtains, before the night's events rushed back at him and he was overcome with exhaustion. He was asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow. That night he dreamt of happy things for the first time in months. He dreamt of flying and freedom and slept soundly through the night.
Draco was fuming, his knuckles were stark-white against his wand, and the urge to curse her into oblivion was almost unbearable.
Cursing his own cowardice, Draco turned to leave. Caught up in his thoughts once again, his foot hit the wall a bit as he turned. The noise was small, but deafening in the silence. Slowly, he turned back and forced himself to face Harry. It would do no good to run now. He might as well face the consequences of his spying and get it over with. After seemingly an eternity, grey eyes met emerald green, and the world stood still. All at once, Draco felt as though he was frozen to the ground, pinned beneath the emerald green eyes which seemed to spark with fury. His mouth went completely dry, and he found he couldn't say a word.
“Shhh,” whispered Harry. “We’re almost there. I don’t want you to see it until the right moment. Don’t worry, I won’t let you fall. Trust me,” Harry pleaded quietly.
“Well… I was thinking… well Hermione told me to, but I was thinking of asking you anyway…”
Surprisingly, the thought of his death was rather easy for Draco to accept.
Suddenly, Draco remembered the hand still resting on his shoulder. Unsure of what to say, he looked up, only to be completely floored by the depths of the concern in Merlin’s eyes.
Suddenly, he was engulfed by darkness like none he had ever known.
However, he only did the opposite, and Draco’s magic began to pulse about the room. Books fell off shelves, the lanterns began to flicker, and the walls began to tremble. “Yes, he did, Professor.” Inwardly, Severus winced. Draco never called him anything other than “Godfather” or “Uncle Sev” when they were alone. “He told me that James Potter was a bully and that he tormented you. He also told me that his father looks exactly like him, and that you are constantly saying Harry is just like him.”
“Then how?”
Tilting his head in a manner that Draco was quickly beginning to refer to as his "thoughtful look", Kreacher stooped over and plucked a random pebble from the ground. As Draco watched, the pebble shifted in shape and color until it looked exactly like the Philosopher’s Stone. Draco wouldn’t have been able to tell the difference by looking.
“Is there something you would like to tell me?”
His love for places like this was something only Draco knew. When the wind blew and Harry closed his eyes, breathing in the scented air, it was almost as though something was calling to him, awakening his soul and rejuvenating his mind and body. He didn't know if it was magic or just his imagination, but when that feeling swept over him, it felt as though the forest had a life and spirit of its own.
He approached the ornate door to his father’s study, unable to keep his hands from trembling as he knocked.
A curse… his father's last words to him…
Kreacher stepped forward, “How can Kreacher serve you?”
“It’s a big choice, and you’re so young. Why do you feel the need to do this now?”
, he thought,
Harry was dead.
Within a few moments, Draco’s foot was free. He scrambled to his feet and faced Harry, who was smirking at him, amusement shining in his eyes.
Thoughts of Harry brought what little courage he had to the forefront. He’d waited too long to defy his father. He wasn’t going to make that mistake this time around. “Better to ‘debase’ myself with them than crawl on the floor like a miserable worm,” he hissed through clenched teeth. “Tell me, Father, did you buy black robes so they wouldn’t show the dirt you crawled through to lick the boots of your precious Lord?”
“Alright calm down, I’ve got you,” Harry said, moving over to take a closer look at the situation, still chuckling, seemingly unable to help himself. Draco glared petulantly at the forest floor and waited.
Draco thought for a moment. Harry was trying to tell him something...but what? He closed his eyes and thought over everything Harry had told him. Suddenly, the words came flowing back to him.
He looked inside, but all he could see were steps leading downwards. The thing apparently had an expansion spell on it. He was curious for a moment, then shrugged before stepping inside and descending the steps.
Harry's POV in the Room of Requirement. Harry is in for some surprises, and how does Draco plan to deal with this mess?
“Yeah,” Harry answered quietly.
“Do you smell that?” Draco sniffed the air, curiosity growing by the second. Honeysuckle? No…something similar…but not quite.
Draco gulped, dizzy with all of the information, “And this place?”
Draco was shocked by Dobby’s speech; it seemed the elf truly cared about his well-being. His guilt at his earlier behavior towards the elf, and house-elves in general, intensified. Draco had only shown basic kindness, and Dobby was acting like a completely different elf. “All right, Dobby. I promise.”
Though it was still a little unnerving, Draco nodded, deciding it wasn’t worth worrying about in the grand scheme of things. “How far back would you send me, then?”
"It's not on any books or any maps, and not many know about it. Your dad, Moony, and I
After what seemed a very short time, the Devas made their exit, and the forest was still.
In another 10 minutes, Harry had his glasses. They fit perfectly and he could see better than could ever remember. Healer Edwards came into focus and Harry admired intricate blue flowers decorating his tie; he had thought it was just blue before.
Healer Edwards clapped Harry gently on the back, “Now that’s settled, go and pick out your glasses. Then we can add your prescription and discuss any enhancements you may want to make.”
“Do not worry, I do not intend to deny you this chance if you do not agree to my request. It is one I must make nevertheless. For too long now, our world has been divided. Houses at Hogwarts, blood-status, light and dark, good and evil. This is not the way the world works. One madman has convinced the world that all Slytherins are evil, choosing to ignore that I myself was a Slytherin.”
Now it was Harry’s turn to stare in shock, “What…?”
Inwardly, Draco cursed his idiocy. He should have known this would get back to his father. He hadn’t been careful in the least about being seen. Still, he couldn’t bring himself to regret the day he spent with Harry. It was worth anything his father could throw at him.
While Draco had been terrified when he'd first been captured, that was no longer the case. Now, looking up at snake-face himself, Draco was royally pissed off.
Lucius turned and seated himself calmly at his desk. The only sound in the room was the scratching of quill against parchment, and Draco knew he was dismissed.
As the scream echoed above the mayhem around him, the cloud vanished.
“You  see that large man over there?” Draco asked, pointing towards Hagrid.
“What happened then? Tell me!” Harry laughed outright at the curiosity and impatience coloring Draco’s tone before continuing, “finally, as the sun was beginning to set, I spotted a tiny colorful blur. It reminded me a bit of a snitch as I watched it fly around. All of a sudden, the thing did a dive bomb and stopped right in front of my nose! I was able to see then that it was a hummingbird. The little thing fluttered around my face for a moment, and then I heard a voice in my head! I thought I was going mental at first, but it introduced itself as a Deva, coming to me in that form.”
The man waved his hand, vanishing the snake. "It was a curse set upon you by your father. When he killed you, he wanted to ensure you suffered beyond your death. It would have fed on you for eternity, crushing your soul beneath the weight of your own emotions."
He would have been alarmed if he weren’t used to the idea of magical creatures, and the sight itself wasn’t so beautiful.
Draco looked up, a genuine smile on his face. “I said sure, you nutter. Did you think I’d be angry at the offer? Living in comfort instead of on the ground? Real food instead of mice?” He shuddered, “I’m proud, but not
Swallowing a thick lump in his throat, Harry nodded, unable to speak. Healer Edwards reached out and pat his shoulder, “Barring any unforeseen circumstances, I’ll see you next year.”
Harry took off in a mad dash after Hagrid and was able to catch up to him rather easily. “Hagrid, wait!” Hagrid turned around, evidently startled by the urgency in Harry’s voice, “Alright there, Harry?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dobby that the
"What?" he said to the air, "You're mental, Draco."
After dabbing at the wound, Draco was just barely able to make out the lines seemingly carved into Harry's hand, although he couldn't read the words due to the blood still seeping from the wound. He had to struggle to keep his face impassive. The horror and anger he felt on Harry's behalf was nauseating. He wanted to be sick at the sight of it. Finally, he addressed his, for lack of a better word, patient.
Marching forward with all the purpose and elegance of a Malfoy that he could muster under the circumstances, he gestured for Harry to lead the way.
From where he stood, Harry could see a den, kitchen, and even a bedroom. It was almost an entire house... inside a trunk!
Draco shivered despite the warmth, his skin breaking out in gooseflesh. He wasn’t sure he liked this story, but he was captivated.
Harry turned to leave and Draco's hopes plummeted. He assumed this meant he was being rejected once again, and tried to keep from being overcome by the devastation until he was alone. He started when, as if hearing Draco's thoughts, Harry turned and spoke to him again, one hand on the curtain that separated them from the rest of the castle.
It was at this moment that Kreacher finally released Dobby, who flopped forward, barely catching himself before shooting the older elf a reproachful look. He turned to Draco, his eyes wide and tearful, and began speaking at a frantic pace, “ Master was ordering Draco to see you, but not to be healing you unless you would not be living. Dobby went to be getting Kreacher because Kreacher serves Young Master and could be healing him. When Dobby and Kreacher returned, the baby cat and Young Master was being covered in bright light. The light grew until Dobby could not be seeing before it was vanished. Dobby was being so frightened, Young Master. Dobby thought it was an evil baby cat-”
There was a flash, and where Umbridge had been moments ago, there was now a sizeable muddy-brown toad. Draco didn’t have much experience with toads, but he thought this one was hideous.
Draco jerked as though stunned, “What? What did you say?”
His descent lasted seconds, centuries, and no time at all until he landed in a place unlike any he had ever seen.
The toad turned around and puffed up its body, looking like a bumpy balloon as it called loudly, “Quark!”
Harry was staring at him, his eyes filled with...was that...concern? For him?
Draco’s eyes widened. Harry was right. He had been so furious; he had just thrashed around and attempted to get out. Normally, he would have calmly analyzed the situation and kept a cool head. It had been drilled into him from birth that giving in to such emotions was unbecoming of a Malfoy.
Harry nodded. “That would be brilliant. What do houses even mean?”
“The soul bond is being so powerful that the familiar absorbs a portion of the magic. It is being different from when a wizard uses a familiar to store magic. When the bond is being sealed, so is the magic in the familiar. It is belonging to them, as your magic is belonging to you.”
"Har-" At this Harry's head snapped up. Silently Draco cursed himself for getting too comfortable in his mind. He cleared his throat and continued, "Potter. If you want this to get better you are going to have to show someone." The stubborn idiot started to shake his head and protest, but Draco would not allow him to interrupt. "I know that you being here trying to fix it yourself means that you don't want to show the healer or Dumbledore. And I don't imagine those friends of yours would be of much use." He paused, expecting the usual Gryffindor loyalty in defence of his friends. He had to mask his shock when all he received was a slight nod, gesturing for Draco to continue. Encouraged by the lack of insults or injuries thus far, Draco made his offer. "I could patch this up for you. I can't do as much as Pomphrey or Dumbledore, but that doesn't particularly matter. I can stop the bleeding and ease the pain, allowing the wound to begin to heal."
