"I don't see that that is your concern," Severus answered, but his voice was muffled against Harry's shoulder.
, perhaps, but while she wouldn't get that from Voldemort, she might be misled into believing she would.
Harry studied Draco. He was slightly flushed -- a good look on him, but many things were -- and despite the nonchalance of his pose, much of his weight was on his toes, as if he were ready to launch forward. "You really want this to work."
"Ah. Yes, I can see the value in that." He hesitated. "Have you anything to tell me about Mr. Nott?"
Draco cleared his throat.  "Sisters sharing sangria and tapas at Dover's best Spanish restaurant would hardly be remarkable at most times. But when those sisters are Narcissa Malfoy and Andromeda Tonks --both née Black -- the meeting might be noted well beyond the society pages." He lowered the clipping. "For those of you
achieve my magical potential with a wand selected by someone else. He left us there and bustled off to Ollivander's, and then came back to fetch us.
Harry started to shake his head, but then stopped. "Just once," he said, letting his nervousness show. "He wrote to me after he escaped and told me he was safe, but that he was leaving the country and wouldn't be able to keep in touch."
"Hi," Harry said. "Want to come watch a Quidditch practice? We'll talk for a while, since it's the first one, but I plan to start with a little warm-up." He grinned at Sammy. "You can see some good flying."
"I am establishing an environment more conducive to communication. My annoyance at your recklessness is genuine, but I should not give it undue prominence. After all, I knew that you were reckless before we were so much as friends, and if I expect you to maintain perspective, I should do so myself."
Harry knew that this wasn't good. Snape had been cleared without a hearing, due to private testimony from various people -- including not only Dumbledore, but unnamed officials in the MLE -- that he had been working as an informant, but he still wasn't what most people would consider a reliable witness.
"Oh, all right!"  Draco huffed. "I withdraw the challenge. I've never cooked anything."  He sat back, arms crossed. "Orange. Put a little chef's hat on it, if you can."
"Still, he's selling himself short, not demanding what resources he can. As are you. If you're each only taking what scraps the other has left, neither of you is getting what you most need."
Harry rubbed into him. "Oh, I think I'm obliging all of us." He reached the juncture of Malfoy's thighs, and was relieved to find cock there -- thick with arousal, and doubled back in a way that made Harry wince inwardly. Malfoy let out a high, wordless cry when he touched it. "Take the knickers off."
"An unusually asymmetric collection of beads," she returned. She tapped her wand next to the strings. "They have garnered some attention."
"Not that I care," Harry said hurriedly, "but the last Harry saved all his correspondence and news clippings about himself, and I got the impression, reading them, that Lucius had seen it as a political opportunity from the start."
"Here," he said, nudging a plate and flatware down the coffee table, closer to the far end of the sofa, where Draco had sat. He took some rice and then passed Draco the foil container. "Not classy, I'm afraid, but good."
"Done this before?" Harry asked, nipping Draco's ear, while he worked a hand under Draco's robes, bunching them up and getting in his way. Draco panted harshly at the contact.
"Eighty-two minutes," Shacklebolt said wryly.  At least, Harry was assuming that dark blur was Shacklebolt. "Tonks rushed you here while I filed reports. Can you sit up? You'll feel better if you have some water."
“Yes. There is an unpleasant method that I was reminded of recently; with your leave, I would like to transfer the curse to an animal.” He held a hand up, stopping Draco, who had taken a step towards him. “It doesn’t need to feel the pain – I can Stun it first – but it will die.”
"Do not call him that!" Snape hissed, but then sank back. "Yes. It could be possible." His eyes snapped to Harry.  "We will discuss this," he said. "I need to give you several nights of detention anyway, lest Professor McGonagall catch word of what your predecessor suggested. However, if you behave appropriately -- both in public and towards me -- we will use those times for discussion and tutelage."
Draco and Hermione turned at the dismissal, but Harry did not. "If this stays secret," he said fiercely, "I want a reason."
"That he doesn't know my abilities as well as he thinks he does." Harry looked over at Hermione. She was curled sulkily back from her notes, quill tapping on her robes. The black would hide any dots of ink. "What do you think, Hermione?" he asked.
Harry tried to crawl up to join him, but his school robes got in the way. He pulled them off as casually as he could, and in trousers and a jumper, joined Draco at the top of the bed.
"Oh." Torn between the desire to reassure her and the fear of making things worse, he wrapped his arms around her while he thought, and let her lean against him. "I don't know," he admitted softly. "You seem to want different things."
Madam Langston straightened. For a moment, she just stared straight ahead, and then, shaking herself much like the cat had, summoned a cup of water.
"Right. Um, so the Dark Lord's servant made him a new body from, among other things, my blood. Since that blood is also his now, we hoped that you might be able to do the divination with blood from me."
for them. And as Hermione pointed out later, we'd be messing up international politics if one nation had that sort of sudden population decline."
Snape thumped a stack of books down in front of Harry's chair and had him put his foot up on it. After a few diagnostic charms, he stalked off, still muttering, to get potions. All tasted -- or smelled -- foul, but that was now reassuring, and the liniment he smoothed along the lines of Harry's ankle provided instant relief.
Harry considered this. It wasn't too dangerous, and it would make a big difference to the business. "Okay, you can open. I won't move to your flat, though. This is the
"I thought to write home and ask Mum. She's delighted, poor woman. Thinks I'm developing an interest in my appearance." Millicent, her face red, scrambled in her bag and drew out a textbook, and, from inside the front cover, two photographs. One was from about a year ago, and Harry didn't think it would be of much use. It showed a clearly posed Millicent dolled up with lipstick and blush and wearing lacy robes that she tugged at between moments of forcing out a flat smile. In the other, though, she was working in the garden in comfortable-looking wide trousers and a slightly tight short-sleeved blouse that flattened her breasts and showed muscular forearms.  There was dirt on her nose and she grinned as she shook a wilted rose at the camera, sending out a flutter of petals.
Still keeping his wand trained on Malfoy, Harry eased back slightly.  "So? Does anyone else know about this place?"
They continued on in silence to the fifth floor, where Draco opened the door to the Prefect's bathroom with an easily audible "Suds and buds."
"I want one of you to bring a message to one of my closest childhood friends," Draco retorted through clenched teeth. Harry moved forward.
"And do you think that he would require such surety to advise you?" Dumbledore chided. "I am certain you would not, in his place. Draco Malfoy may have taught you strategy, but that is not why you befriended him."
come back. I spent the evening of my fourteenth birthday stuck in Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's bedroom, with him telling me about the prophecy, and that it was vitally important to the Wizarding world that I return, despite the risk, and when I finally gave in, I insisted that Ron and Hermione be given Portkeys to the infirmary, in case something happened."
He grabbed Harry's hand and pulled him over to a desk. From the center alcove, he drew out a large box and set his wand to the top, murmuring a password. It opened to show a pile of newspaper clippings. On the top one, Harry saw a picture of Lucius Malfoy, walking in consultation with someone. "These are all articles about you. Reading them may help jog your memory."
"Well, all of us. It's seventh- and sixth-years, and we talked about it last week, and chose a few people."
"Harry?" Draco prompted, rather than tossing the powder on the grate. Harry nodded and took some as well. If Dumbledore was trying to separate them, it wouldn't work. He tossed the powder down immediately.
had done too, Harry," Sirius said firmly, taking the pan off the heat and stepping over to lay a strong hand on Harry's shoulder. "We were all involved. We got caught up in it, you know, and it seemed like such a clever idea.
Draco's nails dug into Harry's shoulder as Blaise fled, and Harry gave as much of a nod as he dared with Hermione there. There was a bit of noise in the corridor, and Millicent came in.
Asking her to go away suddenly seemed too rude. "Are you going to the Burrow?" he tried. When she looked glumly away, he realized that he had expected either pleasure or guilt.  "Hermione?"
Instead, he trailed his fingers through pale curls and to the base of that cock, and then slowly up, making the thing twitch in response.
"Ah." Harry wanted to ask how Snape had kept his job after that, but that would give away that he knew more than he was letting on. Perhaps Professor Dumbledore had lost his position in the following scandal. Lucius Malfoy could certainly have developed it into a scandal. And he had been raised by Snape, and made to
Justin barked out a laugh, quickly covering his mouth and looking apologetic. Draco, quite unexpectedly, sent him a wry smile.
The second door on the right was open. The first room had two chairs, both facing a large window onto unlit space. Harry wondered if it was really still night. The thought fled as he noticed what was on the little table between the chairs -- a small glass full of water. Harry sucked on his dry tongue. They weren't going to give him that, were they? From what Tonks had said last night, he got nothing to eat or drink until after the interrogation.
While Harry was still catching his breath, there was a knock on the door. Both of them froze. "I'll answer it," Harry volunteered.
Seamus was next. He looked around at the people without beads -- Padma, whom Harry thought he must know well, Linnet, and Sophia. "I've never worn eyeliner," he said, and crossing his arms over his chest, sat back.
"Can, yes," she said grimly. "Now, I want you to admit we have a right to." While he was still trying to absorb that, she took a quick breath. "No. An obligation to, as people who
“Again, Mr. Potter.”  He was swallowing something comfortingly vile. He had done this before. Bit by bit, he became aware of the people around him. Hermione, Draco, Ron, and others further back.
Harry's obvious embarrassment as he explained that he hadn't was rather amusing in retrospect, as was Draco's shocked response.
Harry sat down, but didn't call Dobby just yet. "I'm not sure Dean's worth this much trouble," he hazarded.
In the Common Room, sunlight was slanting in the windows.  He had forgotten it was only afternoon. As always on the short weekend days of winter, the seats by the windows were favored, leaving his favorite comfy chair by the fire available. Rather than settle there, Harry headed back out and down the stairs. Near the Entrance Hall, which he knew was in range of Slytherin, he paused long enough to take out the
Parvati ignored her and turned to Seamus. "You're right," she said. "It was inappropriately catty of me, given the people present." Her mouth twitched. "Though I do think Harry got what he deserved."
"Yes, at least not willingly. Of course, learning Voldemort's weaknesses will be difficult. Many people have tried. At minimum, you need some bit of him."
Ginny sniffed. "Slytherins. There were two of them in the car when we arrived. My brother was horrified, of course."
From the other bed, Theodore Nott exploded to his feet, grabbed his dressing gown and something from his bedside table, and stormed from the room.
"Really?" Draco responded, surprised. "Why wouldn't it be? The spell has the same duration whether cast for prophylactic use or for dismissing an erection-- about two hours -- but could be dispelled immediately."
"I believe that's the end of tonight's practical. Does anyone else need Calming Potion?" When only Justin nodded, he frowned. "My error. As your professor, I am giving
" He raised a hand -- that didn't hurt, though he could feel some tightness across his ribs -- and stroked carefully down her silky scales.
anything," Harry said. "That's why yellow -- and I feel kind of stupid dragging everyone in here. Leaving school to look for them would be useless and put me in more danger, and Professor Hecksban said there's no way to protect myself beforehand, but I thought everyone should know, in case something happens, or just if I'm acting, you know, strange. I'll need to be more cautious than usual, because one curse that could work with an indirect relation is a bad luck sort of thing. And I need to stay inside."
"Something like that," Harry answered. He stopped at the door to the mixed-house social space. "Okay," he said to everyone. "We're here. Behavior is a little quieter than the Gryffindor Common Room, because we have Ravenclaws, but it's still okay to just hang out and talk, or even to play Exploding Snap, if it's not game after game. Come on."
While he was considering this, Hecksban returned with a satchel the yellow of lollipop lady's vest, and set it down behind the Pensieve.
"The professor wasn't where I could see, but I think it was a woman. Frieda? Unless that's a surname."
"Well, Cedric Diggory," he answered. He bit his lip against a twist in his gut and a catch in his throat. "But who wouldn't have admired him? He was handsome, and bold, and kind...."
Harry nodded. He fingered the letter, which was thicker than usual. He wondered if it had some personal message added --telling him to behave himself, no doubt -- or if the added bulk was all due to the extra information for seventh year students. "And that I won't be visiting you again."
, trying not to think too much about Miranda. She would have been good at this job, and it wasn't fair, and had anyone ever
Dumbledore chuckled.  "Often said of Professor Snape, but more rarely of Professor McGonagall," he observed. "But perhaps I can help. As it happens, I, too, am a professor. Might you discuss this matter with me, Harry?"
too arduous," Malfoy drawled. He cast a quick charm, and everything that could be unfastened was. Shin guards and forearm guards, unbuckled, clunked down on the floor or thwapped down on the futon-like mattress. Stays, undone on both ends, slid and fell. Malfoy's silver cufflinks struck with a bright clink, and Harry's plainer wood ones with a soft clack. Trousers, unsupported, began a slow slide down, quickly helped along by pushing hands, and were abandoned held up to the ankles by low boots.
"Oh, I always love parties," the man replied airily.  "Although the change in decor was a shock. Do you suppose our hostess is trying to break with the past?"
Ron scowled. "That might explain last week's game against Tutshill. Someone probably bought him off."
"No, though that is the usual reason for that sort of thing. That's why he didn't know Linnet, I take it. But as a first year, when kids were being petrified, Gilbert was all for something taking out the Mudbloods, so he had to have picked that up at home. It was just at the beginning of last year -- or, no, I guess after the Halloween massacre -- that he suddenly started indirect criticisms of the Dark Lord."
"Since we met. Severus had brought you to Diagon Alley to get your school things, and the two of you joined my parents and me for ice cream, and you and I were the best of friends by the end of it. I was worried about Father disapproving of your mixed blood, but he reassured me, that evening, that as your mother was at least a witch, and as Severus would provide you with an appropriate developmental environment, your social status far outweighed that unfortunate blemish." Draco smirked. "Don't scowl, Harry; this is my father I'm quoting, and he was not yet aware of the breadth of your power and skill. Severus had just told him about rescuing you from those Muggles."
"She says 'Papa,' actually, but you are right about the sentiment. I found her crying in the Common Room an hour after lights out, last night."
They discussed the matter for some time, but Professor Hecksban held firm there would be no more practical work today -- not even diagnostic charms. At the end of the session, he allotted house points -- ten to Slytherin for Draco, and otherwise two for each student's house -- and they dispersed. It was too close to curfew for Harry to take Draco to the Uncommon Room for distraction or comfort, so they had to settle for lingering kisses in an alcove near the staircase before parting to go to their houses.
The photo was grainy, perhaps because of the dim light in the restaurant, or the distance at which it had been taken. It showed two men, one older -- perhaps fifty -- and one of Harry's age -- mid to late twenties, at any rate. The younger man looked vaguely familiar, but Harry couldn't quite place him, so they might have been several years apart at school. The older man turned to speak to someone -- a waiter perhaps -- and his companion's expression of interest drained from his face, leaving him looking lost, but only for a second. Harry watched his face harden, and then the loop repeated.
"So you can not reinvent it!" Harry shot back.  "Electricity uses magnetic fields. Muggle electronics don't work in the presence of magic because magic
was wearing on his nerves, and there was a place where the sheet was mended under one of his knees, and the magic had gone from a pleasant hum to the buzz of a station too far away to bring in.
"Fine. Next time, I'll just tell Professor McGonagall that you're missing, and then I can go straight back to my studies."  With a huff, she turned on her heel and strode off toward the library. Feeling stunned, Harry climbed slowly up to Gryffindor tower and a waiting owl.
"Shh." Warmth drew back over his ribs and up to his shoulder blades, and then looped down and forward again. Harry waited motionless as Draco brushed tantalizingly along the waistband of his jeans only to continue up, over his chest, and then return to his shoulder.
or they're always going to think of you as 'the girl with a prick.'" Harry wasn't sure what he wanted here. For Eugene to give up and give him Hermione back, maybe. If he couldn't have that, though, he wanted to protect her -- as him -- as much as he could.
"Oh, it should," he replied. "You're laid out for me beautifully. No claiming we just got carried away."
Shacklebolt shook his head. "In the last decade, there have been firmer limits enacted on testimony. Yes, if you'd been a suspect in a crime, and were legally subject to involuntary Veritaserum interrogation, you might be charged, or he might be charged with corruption of a minor. But as a willing witness with a magically verified contract with the MLE, you are protected from any consequence of that contract being violated.  You can't be charged, and he can only be charged if you agree to it."
Harry remembered the chilling sea air in Azkaban. In a surge of protectiveness, he curled around Draco. "I'll keep you warm."
"It was easier for me," Jacob volunteered. "I could tell he was lying to me, so I listened when he was with Dad, until I knew enough to pretend I knew more, and then I got the rest out of him."
When they heard the door open, they had to pull apart, and quickly settle robes over clothes that were not quite in place. Harry was pleased with the bright pink of Draco's cheeks, even as he could feel the heat in his own.
Gilbert smirked. "It's not the words; it's Adelaide's Amiability Elixer in the champagne, as I understand it. Good natured arguments continue. You
"I keep running into these two," Harry said, with a wink for Gentian. He held out his hand to the boy. "But I don't know your name, yet. I'm Harry."
Dumbledore nodded. "Perceived, but not processed. Yes, that is one of the advantages of it. It is frequently more accurate than conscious memory. However," he continued mildly, "you are quite clever. I do not intend to give you the opportunity to verify your redactive skills." He waved toward the Pensieve. "The next one, if you please.  You may watch them all with me when you are done."
Draco took a breath and straightened, but not quite out of Harry's hold. "Accepted, but please understand that I am
Draco froze. For a moment, he bit his lip, and then nodded. "Yes. She's too angry for comforting, but it hurts to see her hurt."
She shrugged off Ron's snort of amusement, but dropped her hold on Harry. "Sometimes," she agreed coolly. "It depends on the class."
Snape frowned at him. Draco cleared his throat. "Well, yes," he said, "but you mostly just fight. Or rather, you fight, and then one of you sulks, and then you send him a conciliatory letter or he sends you an expensive present, and then you maintain strained civility until the next fight. He's not at all happy about you being in Slytherin, and his attitude toward Professor Snape is execrable."
The pink-haired Auror was there -- except at the moment, her hair was a brilliant turquoise with streaks of gold -- the colors exactly matching Dumbledore's resplendent, starred robes. That seemed to be what was amusing them.
Draco's quick thought that he might, if that someone was Potter, tumbled over the shocking revelation that Potter was willing to be on the receiving end of things, something he would never have believed from anyone else's lips. He might have wasted more time on inquiring -- a fifth-year was old enough to be curious, certainly -- but his shirt cuff heated slightly, warning him that his time in Creevy's form was half-up. Fortunately, a fifth-year could also be awkward. He got to his feet. "How much fairy silk?" he asked.
There was no one in sight, but she still walked close enough to him to speak quietly. "That might be worth the trouble. You're certainly not what I expected. Still, it's a dangerous place for you."
While Hermione was contemplating the summery display, Harry stormed out of the tent. He stuck out his hand, palm up.
"Damnation," Draco muttered. Grabbing his wand, he dropped the silencing charm that he had put in place hours ago. "What is it?"
"I don't get why you're doing this," Harry said quickly. "I mean, I know you think it's your duty, but you're just making yourself miserable, and making me miserable, and looking for a girl dull enough not to be miserable along with us."
"Publicly, the MLE has said only that Voldemort claimed responsibility for the killing and that their investigation supports this." Harry wasn't sure why Draco was even saying that. Certainly Pansy would have read that morning's news articles. "I suspect they shared more evidence with your mother under a Confidentiality charm. She would probably have a harder time talking about it than we would about--" he fingered one of his bead bracelets -- "other things."
"Arrogant and not a pureblood," Harry pointed out. "I've mentioned that to a few of his more dogmatic followers."  He sat down on the bed. "Feel free to transfigure yourself a chair, by the way."
Harry nodded. The time he had talked to young Tom ...  well, if Tom had understood him better, and he hadn't known about his parents, and Ginny hadn't been lying there dying ... well, then it might have worked.
Draco hesitated, but when he replied, his voice was firm.  "I miss my friends, Harry, and this is the friendliest that Pansy has been since I fled back to Hogwarts. And she chose Millicent, who's not one of her usual set, but
Sunday, Harry was busy with the intensive Apparation class, held in a tent just outside the Hogwarts gates. He was glad to avoid wandless magic with Snape. By next week, he hoped, Draco would have smoothed things over with his spellfather. When he asked before their session with McGonagall, which she had moved until evening, Draco told him that he had sent Severus a letter, saying that he valued his support and suggesting that they dine together on Monday.
Harry had practically forgotten about their intention to experiment. Now Malfoy's admonishment to remember made more sense. He lay down, trying to duplicate his position his exactly, and Malfoy repeated his slide and push, eliciting a very similar -- if rather higher-pitched -- cry.
Harry hadn't heard Draco call Horsyr "Frieda" before, but he supposed he would, since they had interacted after school. She was definitely the sort of person who would make the offer as soon as she was no longer his professor. Draco was looking almost anxiously between him and Hermione. "Is there anything it might be helpful to ask now?" he asked. "While you can't get too upset?"
The tension of the entry had dissolved in the chaos. Astoria drew her wand, but only to cast a smoothing charm on her sister's hair. Harry looked over at Pansy to find her eyeing him uncertainly.
"Hi!" he said. She looked just a bit taller than he remembered. "I see you managed your own charms."
"Oh." Harry rolled onto his back and stared up at the ceiling. He could feel his face heating. "I'm, uh, pardoning Lupin. Officially. I've still told him -- via Black -- to stay away from me and Britain."
Harry hadn't ever thought about Death Eater relatives who might not share a name with the ones he knew. "Does Avery have any kids in school?"
Hecksban came into sight first, with an unconscious Petunia Dursley floating behind him. Her legs were bare, and flayed to meat. They glistened with unclotted blood, but it did not fall.
Remus filled the kettle, while Sirius, without prompting, moved to the fire, uncovering the embers and adding kindling.
, and he would feel sympathetic, but seldom indignant. Unable to admit to even that much, he shrugged.
"You're so wrong." Harry ran a hand down the front of Draco's body, lingering on his satisfying hard cock. "Say it."
"Well, that's why I agreed to talk to you -- to do this. I talked to Dean about it, and he still had yesterday's paper, so we read about the murders ...." Ron swallowed. "And he talked about Gemma, and--" He looked away. "We need to do something. Cabot isn't getting the results the Minister of Magic claims, if they're having escapes."
Draco distracted Severus by putting something else on his hair. Severus actually twisted to look at him. "Stop that!"
Harry hoped he had misunderstood. If Hermione and Ron couldn't keep a secret like that, he couldn't trust them with anything.
, or from Dean, or from Snape, when he hated me. My Muggle teachers never protected me from Dudley and his friends, and my aunt and uncle never protected me from
Draco hissed, the sound turning louder as Hecksban lifted the partial Muting hex – or whatever it was – around them. Susan was turned away and coughing, having vomited as well. The professor Vanished the remains and Susan’s mess, and sent cleaning charms at the floor. Justin was curled over his desk. With a quick touch for Harry, Draco went to Susan. He bent down, rubbing her back.
"Am I punishing you?" Harry asked mildly. Beside him, Draco was stirring. "I thought I'd stopped, last night."
It was luxurious. The bath was a wide oval that would easily hold three. In a shared glance, Harry and Draco decided that Severus should go between them, while Severus, contrarily, seemed belatedly self-conscious.
Ron started forward. "Mum, let's--" Clamping his mouth shut, he sat back. "Never mind," he muttered. Harry was almost certain he had nearly suggested something for his birthday.
Linnet frowned. "Does she have children? Oh, yes, there's a girl, isn't there? Older than us, and rather clumsy."
They both ended up with a week's detention with Snape. Draco had to write an essay on why modern Muggle technology was incompatible with magic, and Harry one on the importance of understanding reports that you approve. Neither took a week, but Snape didn't make them do anything else. He just left them together in his office every evening, and returned about an hour later. That was all right. Even better, Harry didn't try to pull away the time that Snape came back early. That, Draco thought, might win them another week of detentions.
"That's a point." She frowned, but then shrugged it off. "Still, I think you're brilliant. I only had one close call."
“Other thoughts on the curse?” Hecksban asked. He hadn’t taken the Calming Potion himself, Harry realized.
"But I think that's part of the point," Parvati argued. "That you become less careful as you get more drunk."
. And it hardly seemed fair that you might be kept out because you had been orphaned, and someone had placed you with Muggles who had lied to you."
"Um...." Harry thought back through previous Potions classes. Remus was looking very urgently at him, as if he knew Harry had an answer.
Rob dashed off, with Jeremy close behind. Sammy stood more slowly. "Rob showed me some magazines," he advanced.
Padma waved to Hermione, and Hermione waved back and then looked pointedly past Draco, Harry, and Ron, and to her other side. "Sophia?" she asked.
That had been a needed warning, but over the course of the day his urine shifted from dirty green to brassy gold. Humiliatingly, he needed to report on the color after each trip, and with the amount of water he was instructed to drink, those were frequent.
"Oh," Draco sighed, pressing into the contact. "Mm."  Harry wondered if this was a good idea. He was hard already. Then Draco pushed one hip forward, dragging his erection over Harry's, and Harry knew it was a splendid idea. He dragged Draco's robes to the side so he could open the front without needing space between them. Draco lifted his head.
It was a challenge. Draco gave it the compliment of his attention. "Hm," he said. "It would be foolish of Potter, but then, he is a Gryffindor, so that is to be expected." He studied the face in front him. "I would say Creevy had more reason to want revenge, but Potter talked about me, didn't he?" He smirked. "Most vulgarly."
Harry growled and bit again, making the body beneath him jerk forward. He added more lube and pushed his finger in deeper, getting through the inner ring. "That's it." Shifting up, he worked his free hand between Severus and the mattress to grope his cock as well as the space would allow.  "You're hard again. I like that." Even as he was speaking, he began to rock his own erection against the back of Snape's leg. "And I'm fucking aching. I want that blowjob." He bit again as Severus tried to squirm away. "No.
Harry nodded. That was interesting, but not useful. He sipped his drink. Draco sighed, and leaned back, relaxing against him again.
Harry laughed. "God. When I'm old enough, I can buy it myself." At Zabini's tense look, he recalled Draco's opinion about Harry's tastes being over Zabini's budget. "Look, don't worry about it, okay? If you feel like you need to do something, you can just owe me a little favor."
One of her shoulders rose in a shrug, but unexpectedly, she smiled. "When it's good," she confided, taking his hand, "it's
I make introductions?" At the Auror's nod, Dumbledore turned to nod himself, but at Harry. "Harry, this is Auror Richard Mason and Auror Nymphadora Tonks. Please cooperate appropriately with their investigation. Auror Mason, Auror Tonks, this is Harry Potter, a tolerable student, but an impressive young man, and a quintessential Gryffindor."
"Race you!" Mill said suddenly, and took off thundering through the snow. Harry followed. It covered for the awkwardness, at any rate. They showed up at Hagrid's hut wet and muddy from slides down the slope, but it was nothing a few warming and drying charms couldn't fix. Harry had just finished his own, and was going to ask if Mill needed help, when Hagrid's door opened.
Snape nodded wordlessly while Harry did the second cuff. Harry considered whether to bind his ankles as well. Not with Snape standing, he decided; it would take from, rather than add to, his security here. He started even more lightly than he had for Draco, with a whirling brush of just the tips of the tails. Severus made a choking noise.
"Both of which have helped me in the past," Harry pointed out, "if only by accident. And you seemed convinced that I'd have a rough winter."
at the Goyles'," Draco answered, grimacing. "I managed to skip their Christmas party twice, but the third year, Mother noticed the pattern."
"We did. But when we came out of the tunnel, Remus turned into a werewolf, and he tried to attack us, because he had missed his medicine, and while Sirius was drawing him off, the rat escaped."
"Of course they think I ought to! Look, don't worry about it, okay? I'm still on the team, and it's not my problem, now." Harry turned away to loosen the cord on the bag of fluxweed. "And while it wasn't penance, it seems to have worked that way. They were far less angry at me today."
Harry snorted. Draco rolled his head in an interesting manner to look up. "Considering that you're late..."
"All right," Thornton agreed easily. He frowned down at the pile of stripped uniforms. "Are you certain the Gryffindors are targeting by color, sir?"
have a more credulous reception for second thoughts, I will give you the choice -- shall I stupefy you both, or provide Mr. Malfoy with lubricant?"
Laughing softly, he erased the phrase from his imaginary letter. Though it might suit her sense of humor, at that.
"No. Um, it's called the Credulity curse. The book I read said the effect was mild, but Draco -- I asked him about it afterwards, when you were happily assuming that I knew more about Charms theory than you do -- said that's if you cast it on someone who distrusts you." His chest felt like he was in the coils of an anaconda. "Which I'd thought you did.  And now you will, I suppose."
"Neither of whom can be discreet." Draco held his wand to the top collar button. "Observe," he said, and cast a light severing charm. Reaching out, he picked up the freed button and moved it to the corresponding spot on the new jacket.
"Here's an idea!" he said. "Maybe I could get the headmaster to open the mixed house space for Christmas. Anyone who wanted to could open presents there, and we could play games all together if we want."
Tonks laughed. "Hm," she said, her expression mischievous, and the pink of her hair turned black, blond, and chestnut in stripes.
"Why not? I said they were for calling friends together. That's a perfectly lovely thing, you know." She cocked her head to the side. "I think he may have assumed that the house colors called members of that house, but you can't explain everything."
"Tsk." Snape raised his head. "Of course not. You would receive the dosage entirely too slowly. I painted it on the rim of the glass."
With a grin, Harry did that. When it was closed, and muted, he flopped down into a chair, and took the bag of gold out of his school bag. "Here," he said, tossing it Snape. "Thanks for the loan."
In the guest room, Harry flopped down on the bed, but then rolled to his side. "Now," he said, "I want you to suck me. Do you think you can manage that?"
"Allergy to what?" Hermione snarled, lunging into his space. He took a step back. Harry wondered whether to intervene. He had vanished the mess, but Ron was making a miserable, wordless whine and clinging tightly to his wrist. Harry stayed put.
"He'll say that someone needs to train me," Harry returned. He took a quick breath. "And someone does. We can't just hope I can do it right on the first try."
After settling on text for her and for Draco, he considered conjuring temporary parchment, but decided that calling Dobby to bring something more durable was safer -- he'd never got the hang of conjuration. Somehow, it felt more improbable than changing one thing into another. He was just folding the letter to Narcissa when the door creaked open.  He looked up to see Headmaster Dumbledore stop, one foot over the threshold, his robes swinging on without him and then falling back.
Smiling fondly at her, Sophia leaned forward in her seat. "I have never," she said, with the air of imparting a great secret, "written a brilliant essay that, to my deep dismay, was never assigned."
"Professor Sprout called me in on Monday," Susan offered. "'Now, dear, I'm sure it's nothing, but you understand I must ask...'"
"I've been thinking," Harry said, "that it's a really targeted ability. And for most of my childhood, he didn't really exist. I wasn't even around other magic. Snape thinks of that as a setback, but I wonder if it might not have helped. Maybe Professor Dumbledore had a point, leaving me with Muggles -- though sending me back for summers seems rather useless."
"Well, of--" Ron looked up, and shook himself. "I...."  he began uncertainly. He swallowed, and then laughed shakily. "I don't know why I said that. Blood in the water, I guess."
"So," Draco said. "I am informed that your contribution to the party was the only liquid you had after the match."
Harry thought quickly. Claiming to be Tom might trip him up -- he was reluctant to lie at all -- but he had better sound like he belonged here.
.  So I don't see what else I can do. If adding the potion triggers it, I have no chance to siphon it off."
Eventually, he left the protection of the Sound-Block charm to use the loo, and when he got back, Kingsley was waiting for him.
"This one." Harry dropped into his favorite and patted the worn cushion beside him. "It's the comfiest."
Moving far more slowly, they resumed their approach. The Auror on the ladder seemed to be having some trouble lifting the head from the gate. He finally got it free and came gingerly down the rungs, balancing with his elbows now that his hands were full. Hair swung with each jolting step, dripping blood. Harry felt a little better when the thing was hidden by the people examining it, but his heart was pounding and his stomach squirmed. Who had it been? Now that the question had made it though his revulsion, he wished he had looked more closely. The hair had been dark, he was sure, although the bright snow behind it had obscured detail. Had the dangling mass actually been
"Sorry," he said, as she swung away to the window, and Daphne attempted to smooth her hair. "I should socialize them more. I sometimes think they're almost Beings, but that doesn't make them civilized."
"I can't believe that!" Harry exclaimed. "We're so careful coming in, and then we do an idiotic thing like that."
"Explain to me again how you're no good at this?" Malfoy's voice was wry, but he did, indeed, hold still for the fine brush that was lining his eyes in grey.
"That would need to be with Dean, not instead," Seamus objected. "Otherwise, you're taking another friend of his away."
With a bark of assent -- did he need to do that? -- Sirius raced back the way they had come. The noise, of course, brought glances their way. Remus and Harry hurried down to close the gap before anyone came to meet them.
"He can't do things sensibly. You'd think he'd want to win more than anything, but he wants an audience for it more."
As soon as Harry entered his office, Snape snapped out his wand. That would have been alarming as little as a year ago, Harry mused, as he watched the door swing shut and glow around the edges.
"Oh, I see! That raises the challenge considerably." Narcissa reached for the wine that had appeared with the quail. "Harry? Another glass?"
"An invitation." Harry sat down on Ron's bed, across from Neville, who was sitting on his own. "Draco and I have a mixed-house social group. It's been going for about a month now, and we've decided to expand. We think you'd make a good addition."
"Objection," a wizard for the defense barked out. "These matters were reviewed in court in 1982. Since that time, witnesses have died or vanished, and evidence decayed. For Mr. Snape to revive these allegations --"
Draco laughed. "No! Although Blaise would've, I expect, if I'd suggested it." He slid a hand behind Harry's neck. "Now.  We are free until dinner, are we not?"
Harry looked at the old picture of her for a moment, and then closed his eyes. When he thought he had the face right, he opened his eyes and took her height down from actual, but not quite to where he remembered. "How's that?" he asked.
Snape shrugged, but he looked uneasy. "Perhaps," he said evasively. "If you are telling the truth, which I doubt, it was foolish of you to repeat a trick on the trickster."
"I never bother with people I hate," Cornelia sang. Harry didn't recognize the tune, but it made Hannah giggle.
"Nah, I thought I'd let you do the work." Harry kept his tone light, although again, the comment worried him. "Don't want to choke you.  Though actually, you seem to be doing that on your own."
"Well, to say that someone should come speak to him.  How do you know when Professor McGonagall wishes to see you?"
"Inside the right elbow." He took a quick breath. "With the point of a knife." He pushed up the arm of his robe to bare the skin. His hands, to his disgust, were shaking.
"It was not madness," Hecksban corrected, repeating his earlier diagnostics, none of which appeared to have any effect at all.  "It was a curse."
"That's an advantage though," Blaise put in. "It narrows things down." Hermione had pulled a self-inking quill from her bag and was writing "tastes good to Harry" on a piece of parchment.
"Well, my Harry is the enemy that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named fears most, now that Dumbledore is dead. Death Eaters have taken over the Ministry and Hogwarts, so we're on the run."
memory. I knew certain things would please you, and how to do them, but I still don't remember doing it before." He turned his head to look at Draco. "When did we first do that? Was it like that?"
"That might be the best one to use on him, too," he said thoughtfully. "If I'm careful about wrap, I can work him up slowly."
"It's great to go in with a leading score, too," he said generously. "Did you see that bit where Cornelia forced Cecilius off course, and Ginny was able to intercept the Quaffle?
Harry sighed. He would never figure out the potion on his own, and the others deserved to know why to be suspicious. It wasn't being hasty.
"A substance that induces purging." Draco's voice was at its most brittle. Harry raised his eyebrows at Blaise.
When Malfoy turned back into a boy, everything was out of place.  His greater height had his back arched, and for a moment, his head pressed into Harry's chest.
"I knew there was some reason I rescued you from Fenrir," Harry replied, and Draco, despite his exhaustion, snorted with laughter.
"It rather depends about what, doesn't it?"  Snape asked. "Voldemort will not call me to account for not killing you. A number of people might still want to know what I have to talk to you about."
Dumbledore laughed outright. "I do believe she told me that story, but I had forgotten. Now, I still have a matter to discuss with you in private." He inclined his head. "Where would you like to do so?"
After a deep breath and a slow exhale, Draco raised the cup. He took a moderate swallow. Afterwards, he sat, wondering if he felt different. Well, a little more self-conscious about being naked and sticky in front of his head of house, he decided, but another go with Harry still seemed like the ideal way to spend the afternoon. Or perhaps a stroll in the rose garden, with actual conversation, to see if this had any chance of becoming more than mind-blowing sex. He realized Harry was watching him anxiously, his lower lip held taut under his teeth, and he nodded and extended the cup.
Flying was just the thing, both for Draco and for Harry. They played a mad game of Follow the Leader, swooping and diving and turning so fast that their Warming charms couldn't stay fully in place, and then stumbling red-cheeked and icy-fingered into the changing rooms to warm each other up. By the end of it, Harry felt optimistic again.  Dumbledore was worried about him: that was almost nice, if stupid and badly handled. Snape would protect Draco at Malfoy Manor: that was useful, and would also keep Draco's visit as short as he had promised. Draco needed to let Snape know that he mattered: that meant this ridiculous construct of always visiting together had to stop, and because Harry had promised Hermione to visit the Quiris with her at the beginning of next term, Draco agreed that Harry could be alone with Snape also.
they win," he shot back.  "I don't deny that in a flat-out race, he would beat me; he's still the size of a fifth year. I assure you, if I had anyone of my talent
Gradually, Harry's racing heart began to slow, and he raised his head to see Draco looking smugly up at him.
"You," he breathed. Realizing what he'd said, he shook his head. "I'm sorry. I must sound mad. It's a long story."
"The creature in the Chamber of Secrets," Hermione explained. "You remember how students were paralyzed? The only reason I was paralyzed and not killed was that I'd figured out what it was -- the roosters all being killed was the first clue--"
Sidestepping out of the way, she gestured at the room. "But did you see? It's lovely! I was wondering what on earth Padma was talking about. Padma," she called over her shoulder, "it wasn't like this when I saw it."
"No." He shook his head. "When you were around, you made me keep it reasonable. And you argued with me. But you didn't
"I doubt the elixir will prevent that in a moderate dosage." Snape hesitated. "I believe you are on good terms with a young Auror -- a girl with pink hair?"
And he did, he thought, as he walked away. Potter, of course, had Creevey, as he had Thornton, because scholars in their N.E.W.T. year -- or even their O.W.L. year -- no longer had time to run foolish errands. However, he intended to have Thornton seen tailing Potter -- and Thornton
Whether or not Talbot was telling the truth, his testimony turned Harry's thoughts to a related problem. Even if he didn't stay with the Weasleys after his birthday, they could still be attacked to flush him out. On the other hand, that had always been true, hadn't it? Visiting the Weasleys would give Voldemort a more concrete reason to attack them; it made sense to stay away. And leaving the Dursleys should keep them safe -- certainly Voldemort would know that he didn't love them, wouldn't he? And Voldemort -- Tom Riddle -- had hated his own Muggle relatives, so there, at least, he should not invent affection where it didn't exist.
"No!" Malfoy sighed and shook his head. "No, it was a revision," he continued more quietly. "I couldn't get the speed I wanted at sufficient mass to control you."
"Good." Harry began a series of even, steady blows -- nothing that would really sting, but a slow build of force. "Breathe."
"Couldn't wait," she panted, before moving her hands to his flies. "Can't strip you fast enough. Want
With a sharp look at him, Snape nodded. "That advice is why I was forewarned -- barely -- of the matter.  Still, I would like to see the full message." He held out a hand to Harry.  "If you would not mind...."
Rather than returning to his room after breakfast, Harry stepped out to Diagon Alley and went straight to Madam Malkin's. The salesgirl who greeted him ran to get Madam Malkin herself, and the matron came breathlessly to meet him.
Harry pushed up his glasses by rubbing his eyes again. It wasn't that he thought he wasn't seeing correctly -- he was fairly certain that Hermione was now a
Once they had sat down and there was food on his plate, Harry sat and listened to the conversations -- mostly about school work -- and tried to pay attention, but he couldn't keep from looking at the Gryffindor table. Ginny was laughing with some sixth-year boy. Hermione was there -- and Ron, with his arm around her shoulders. Ron looked up, and, by chance, their eyes met. Ron scowled and flashed an obscene gesture at him, and Harry quickly looked away.
"I -- I was angry," Harry admitted. "And I couldn't leave the others helpless with an attacker. Yeah, as soon as I had half a minute to think about it, I realized they were probably safe with him, but I didn't have time to get to that."
"That was marvelous." His mouth twitched in a sly smile. "I'm ridiculously pleased at the thought that the whole floor may have heard you."
"Well, you may have thought he was cute." She laughed harshly. "And I wouldn't have touched that with a barge pole."
"Good." Hecksban shrugged. "Actually, quite bad in the larger sense -- Professor Dumbledore was dismayed at Snape's certainty over the matter -- but good for you now. It does limit the direct harm that can be done to you remotely." Swinging his legs like a boy on a dock, he slid forward and off the desk surface. "There is nothing you can do to protect yourself in advance, and others are working on prevention, so worrying about it is pointless." He grinned. "Write a great essay for me instead. Next question?"
"The little princes, I see. Does your arrival at this hour indicate a crisis, or merely your usual lack of consideration?"
The Slytherins had moved on. With a huff, Draco turned to Hermione. "Miss Granger," he said politely. "Would you like to accompany us to see the Quiris?"
, and Harry found himself staring up at Draco's bollocks. Tentatively, he nuzzled the soft skin. It wasn't as if he hadn't done that before, but the angle changed things, drawing the hanging pouch down toward his mouth. Behind that, he could see the compressed lines of Draco's anus.
"All right, then. I'll look over the components for the first set, and if I can, I'll get them for you. If I can't, I'll let you know by owl as soon as possible."
"There are ... certain things of which I am always willfully ignorant, Potter -- part of the arrangement between myself and my house. Any matter of willing sex is beneath my notice."
The old man's expression grew grim. "I would certainly not challenge Professor Snape on knowledge of Dark curses. His years as a Death Eater taught him much that I would rather he did not know. However, all knowledge has gaps; I will not assert the negative in this case. Neither he nor I know of a means to cause you irreparable harm through her."
Even together, they slept badly. Harry work up early from a dream that he was writing a curse in blood. He couldn’t picture the letters or hear the words, but knew the curse had been horrible. He also knew he would not get back to sleep – not with his heart racing and his chest tight. His scar felt like it was pulling on his skull, giving him a headache. He lay as still as he could, listening to Draco’s breathing. Was he really asleep?
His coat turned a shimmering blue color, and the Bludger zigzagged off down the field in search of Slytherin green.
her, Draco. That's how people make babies, don't you know that? It's not done by signing your name on a
When Harry noticed that Malfoy's hands had progressed from touching him through his clothes to unfastening them, he shifted to reciprocate.  "Yeah," he said. "Skin."
Gin turned out to be like coffee; it smelled lovely and tasted vile. He thought he managed to swallow it without grimacing, but even diluted, the alcohol stung his sinuses. He coughed slightly. Snape appeared not to notice, settling comfortably in a wing-back chair and lifting his own glass.
His lips curled in an unfamiliar sneer. "Granger," he said shortly. With a disgusted air, he surveyed the tent around them.  "So. I take it my counterpart in this world is another Muggle-coddling masochist?"
“I wonder …” Draco cast another detection charm at the Pensieve. “Again, not an area effect. Perhaps we should put up shield spells, and I can drop a rock on it? The curse might just blow up whatever touches it.”
Harry felt his blood run cold. He wasn't sure if the euphemism was for sex or murder or something else, but it was clearly something horrible.
," he spat out, focusing all his fury at Snape on the feather. His rage didn't shoot out of him as it had with the Bone Burning curse. Nothing seemed to happen at all. He tried again, until his head ached with pressure. The pale fronds may have trembled, or there might have been a slight draft across the table. Snape hissed.
Glancing at Tonks, Harry stumbled forward. Was Mr. Cabot going to ask him the questions? This wasn't how it was supposed to go, was it?  What if he changed the limits? Her face gave him nothing, but as she came close on his heels, she whispered, "Steady."
Harry pulled a third blow, the change in motion so abrupt that he knew he would feel it in his shoulder in the morning. "Shall I let you go?"  he demanded.
"Maybe not. We open the Quidditch season against Ravenclaw on Saturday, and the Patil twins have been major supporters of mixed house space and are people I'd like to bring in on the first round. That might make it awkward. The following Friday, perhaps?  Feelings should have settled by then."
Without reflection, Harry shot upwards in pursuit. The sound of the match faded away as he streaked towards the Hogsmeade hills, gaining on his quarry. He flattened out to his broom and put on all the speed he could. As he drew close, he reached out a hand for the dragon's tail, as if it were the Snitch.  Six inches, four inches, two.... He stretched the last bit, and grabbed. As he did, he felt a sickening pull at his stomach, and the ground below spun away.
Dean accepted a beer when Seamus handed it to him, but was still uneasily studying his strawberries when Millicent practically dragged Blaise into the room. Blaise pulled away to settle alone in a chair on the far side of the chamber, with a glass of wine and a mound of fruit. Millicent didn’t press further, plopping down beside Cornelia, who happily punched her in the shoulder. Harry didn’t think his housemate had noticed any discrepancy, but made a mental note to warn Mill against permitting that sort of physical greeting. They were only ten weeks away from completing her change, and although they had been adjusting the glamors – she could still have a growth spurt at seventeen, after all -- parts of her body weren’t quite where they appeared to be.
"No, but you're not entirely reliable at it either, and the potion is neither easy nor safe to brew. I wouldn't want it wasted. I can form the bowl for you if you command me to do so, but it must be a command."
They drove along an assortment of roads, through a day that Harry had suddenly noticed was sunny and fresh. He sat in the center of the back seat, and leaned forward to talk between them.
Draco chuckled. "I'm not sure it's entirely cheek, either. They seem to have bonded over the Sirius Black investigation."
male beetles. Transfiguration across species, unlike an animagus transformation, has no bias at all to the original gender.  Starting from a male beetle, it should be no harder to produce a female quail than a male quail. You will note that most of you have done so.
Harry raised an eyebrow. It was all he could manage. "And both of us?  Do you think we could fight off a dragon?"
"Harry!" Remus said brightly, turning from conversation with Hagrid. "Here at last!" More coolly, he nodded a greeting to Draco. "Mr. Malfoy."
"Well, good. I thought you might have been off on your own." She sniffed. "Really, I was terribly worried about you, Harry."
"'Coming down the hill,' Mrs. Plumtree said, 'I heard a splash -- rather a large one -- too loud for a water rat. So of course, when I was crossing the stream, I looked down. It was getting light then, but I cast a Light charm anyway, because the water looked like it had strands of yarn in it, which didn't make any sense. It took me a moment to realize it was blood.'"
"Professor McGonagall was surprised that I wanted to keep Potions, but it's a requirement for some jobs -- Auror, for example. I told her I wanted to keep my options open."
Harry swallowed. He felt he had a hundred things he needed to know, but finding words for even one was hard. "Could they?" he asked finally. "If they ... if the Death Eaters took ... if
didn't even find out until ... less than a year ago. I figured out that some people who ought to have sense thought I was the one who would defeat him, and I confronted Dumbledore, who explained why, and I got more from Remus and Sirius later." He paused.
"Primarily," Snape said, breaking his pattern to turn towards him. "However, it also contains both Quiri hair and Unicorn horn. The effects of the former are not well documented, but both react to Dark Arts. I believe that if you practiced Dark Arts while consuming this daily that you would develop visible symptoms -- perhaps just anxiety, at first, but fairly quickly progressing to tremors and paranoia, if the interaction continues."
"I'm afraid I'm making you everyone's dogsbody. You'll be fetching and prepping whatever we need and don't have time to deal with."
"Carla Jenkins," Caradog said. "She is a fifth year, but a Quidditch player, you know, so used to older students."
"I would never stop using it. I would use it to go to dinner at school. I would use it to walk into the Leaky Cauldron. I would spend the rest of my life hiding."
Pain seared like the Cruciatus curse through Harry’s legs and mind, and Aunt Petunia was shrieking over Hecksban’s incantation. Harry clamped his mouth shut on his own reflexive scream. Hot pain turned to pure heat, obscuring both sound and vision.
"Yes, but we can be alone here. And if we do a project with McGonagall, that might be three birds. I'm sure she'd soften a bit if she saw me working with Hermione."
That, Harry decided, as he heard a distant meow, had not accounted for the strange schedules of cats. Draco met his eyes. There was a door up ahead -- perhaps even the one that they were looking for -- and they hurried to it and checked inside. It was the storeroom, cluttered with hideous junk, just as Myrtle had described. They stepped in, Harry cast a freshening spell down the corridor, and they closed the door.
"No." She grinned cheekily at him, her hair sparkling back to pink. Harry caught his breath, and Draco's eyes widened slightly. Harry could tell even he was impressed.
"All right."  Harry leaned back against an upholstered chair so he didn't have to look down so far. "Are you interested in the real thing?"
Harry stopped and considered. He had wanted to talk to Zabini. Of course, now he was Fred, whom Zabini had no reason to talk to, and no one with a drop of sense would believe Fred if he said he was someone else on Polyjuice. Harry checked the time. He had less than ten minutes until his own form returned. Perhaps he could send Susara over with a note to ask for a parley?
"Look, what are you actually here for?" Harry demanded. "Is there a message from Dumbledore or not?"
"Er, no." Harry regretted the words as soon as they were out of his mouth. If he had paid attention, he would have had an incantation to search for, at least. He stepped closer. "Is it hard to learn?"
They stepped through a gap in a holly hedge. Harry was expecting a garden, or more holly if it was a maze, but instead found himself facing a wall of bare, twisted bramble. He stopped. He could not imagine anything less Malfoy-ish.
"Simply what I said. The effect should be something he would not dread repeating, yet will not desire to." Draco frowned.  "Speaking of which, have you talked to Blaise yet?"
To Harry's dismay, the energy from the Bone-Burning curse (cast on some sort of preserved fish that Snape dumped out of one of his jars) shivered at the tips of his fingers, as even Morsmordre had not.
Harry shook his head quickly.  He didn't think he had been quiet. "Just didn't mention the ones that might cause trouble," he muttered back, choosing the remaining tart with pear slices.
Hermione was giggling. When they paused, she reached out and hooked Harry's bracelet. "Would I get answers on this? If I came, I mean?"
When the corridor forked, Harry started for the back staircase -- the den staircase, Finch-Fletchley had called it -- but Draco caught his arm.
"Really?" She laughed. "Oh, good, because I've been trying to figure out what I'd do if you got cold feet."
Thirty minutes later, they collapsed onto the stiff sofa and looked happily around at their work. As seen from the entrance, the Slytherin banner was to the left of the rock heap, and the Gryffindor one to the right. Continuing around, the Ravenclaw banner was next, directly across from Slytherin's, and then, on the other side of the door, Hufflepuff's banner hung across from Gryffindor's. At either side of the room was a fall of ivy, growing with nearly visible speed. Two more -- one of them Draco's finished demonstration piece -- framed the door, and two more tumbled down the rock pile.
for things, really -- that he let me try to win support in his house, and that he look the other way about us."
Zabini shot him an odd look, but didn't ask. "I'll meet you there, then. Ten minutes, because I'm not leaving my ice cream, and it's a longer walk than Floor and Bore."
"I don't know what either is called, but one is full of odds and ends of old furniture. I've only been in there for a moment, because it doesn't have any plumbing, but I appeared in a disconnected bath there once, when I was startled. A terrible bath -- it was lined with seashells, and horribly uncomfortable to even
"Said my first lover," Harry parried, not needing to remind Draco who that was. "Lie back, okay? And put your feet up on my shoulders, so you can relax your thighs." Helpfully, he curled an arm around one calf, stabilizing the leg. "Now, breathe."
Harry nodded. "Defense and Cursebreaking, too. I get the feeling Professor Hecksban won't mind that sort of thing."
"Mm. That Professor Dumbledore didn't ask to see me."  Harry pulled the door open, and they crossed into the sunlight. It was fair, but chilly. "I was expecting words about crossing him." The door shut behind them, and Harry breathed more easily. No one else was in sight.
They went up a half-flight of broad stairs, and down a long gallery with portraits to the left and arched windows to the right. Those seemingly gratuitous steps, Harry decided, might have been to enhance the view of the grounds and gardens, now grey and gold in the last glow of sunset. At the end of the gallery, they passed into an elegant room, much softer than the entrance hall, and flooded with light. The wood paneling was painted a soothing cream, with the carved leaf border of each panel faintly picked out in pale green and gold that echoed the more richly colored ivy of the cloth above. An intertwined pair of silver snakes marked each corner of the wall covering on the sides of the room. Ahead, sliding paneled doors were open enough for Harry to see an airy dining room with table set, awaiting food and diners.
"Most of the time," Snape shot back, but his sense of self-preservation reasserted itself. "Perhaps I misspoke. However, it is the same transition, and the power of a creature with more control over that transi--"
With a tap of his wand, he made the center panel of glass reflective, and using it, duplicated some of the changes that he had used to go to Knockturn Alley, making his hair red and his jaw a bit jowly. To his satisfaction, she gasped when he looked at her.
Having finished his account of beads that would entertain Hermione, Harry gave Draco a little nudge, and he took the hint and slipped off. With incongruous grace, he leaned against the arm of the sofa, and twisted back to talk to Hermione. Harry stretched and wondered if he wanted another tart to fortify himself for the evening.
"I don't like things messing with my mind, that's all." Harry couldn't get upset about it, at the moment, but he still knew that was what it was.
"But that's not really enough." Lifting her chin, she stepped away, out of reach. "I don't want to get you in trouble, but I don't think I should let it go."
"Well, not if this source is accurate." Harry wasn't used to Draco making him feel like a student in a lesson. "The introduction talks about how most blood curses that are more than a nuisance require potions -- with a few exceptions."
Harry expected that to end the matter, but Padma looked intrigued as she leaned forward. "How do we define the difference?"
be destroyed quickly. Pushing down the satisfying thought of using the table and a Blasting curse, he moved on to other options. Neutralizing the curse in place was probably impossible.  However, he thought he could change the parameters of it, as Professor Hecksban had them doing before exams.
Hermione settled Harry with tea and a blanket. He kept frowning at the space around him, as if something were bothering him, but when she asked, he said he wasn't sure what was wrong. After two rounds of this, she excused herself and went back outside to think.
. On more than one occasion, though, he had kissed Draco and trusted the people around them -- Millicent and Blaise and Linnet and Gilbert -- to keep an eye on their drinks.
"To some people, perhaps," Snape answered, approaching him. He stood close -- almost as close, Draco reflected, as he had for their near kiss.  Snape, however, had his wand in hand and pointed almost at Potter. "Not to me."
Harry looked over at the trunk. After a moment's scan of the room and one look under the bed, he got back to his feet and nodded. "Yes, Sir."
Parvati laughed. "I don't disapprove of Draco, Harry, but you're spending too much time with Slytherins. Give him a few weeks before you suspect the worst."
The sudden false brightness of that query was dismaying.  Harry sighed and sat down on the edge of the bed. "It's complicated. Will you keep a secret?"
After a long, hard look, Ron nodded. "All right. I was worried that you weren't in the Great Hall, but I can see it would look odd to turn her down." Sighing, he sat down on the edge of his bed. "How's your week been?"
pictures of my mum? All Ginny'd need to do is put a little wave in her hair -- and her body, maybe a stone, in just the right places...."
Draco's face was tight with anger, and Harry fought the urge to look down. He wasn't required to take Draco's advice on his relationships. "Gryffindor honor, you know." The words came out colder than he had intended.
go through Hermione's things. That left him without much to distract him from the question of how well Draco could handle Hermione's protective anger. Draco might be better with people than he was, but he didn't know Hermione as well.
"And even as it stands, several members of mixed-house families have expressed their appreciation." Draco regarded her keenly. "What about you?"
In the moments of silence that followed, Harry saw everyone steadying him or herself in some way -- Ron pulling at his hair, Neville chewing at his lip, Ginny smoothing her skirt, Hermione closing her eyes. It was Hermione, almost timidly, who spoke first.
"Something strategically important, Harry? Yes, that might be an issue. However, Gilbert was letting you know something, with this challenge. You must see the value of that."
He stopped, not bothering to hide his trepidation as he looked up to meet Malfoy's eyes. That was right, wasn't it? If he'd truly been through that sort of curse, he would be feeling just as vulnerable as he actually did, right now.
. And everything went this delicious, slow, summer green, which slowly became darker and darker, until I ... I
Their next lesson was Transfiguration, during which Harry and Draco sat together, but made it a point to behave exceptionally well. Ron and Hermione, two tables in front of them, talked more. Harry didn't want McGonagall to have any chance to criticize his behavior with Draco. He had even left Susara back in the dormitory, partially to make it easier not to whisper, and partially because he wasn't sure how dangerous Cursebreaking would be. He didn't suppose he and Draco could maintain this level of behavior for long, but a good start might make a difference in the professors' attitudes later.
It wasn't quite, but it was close enough. Malfoy's cock was not entirely like his -- a little narrower, and less of a change from shaft to head, but he could still set up a rhythm that he would have liked himself, and then slow it down until it made Malfoy moan. He didn't have any real desire to kiss the white shoulder in front of him, but a not-too-violent bite was well received.
Draco laughed. "I had the same problem with the cleansing charm. It took me a while to work up to it, as I'm sure you noticed."
"Ah." Draco tilted his head. "Hm. Can we do one with each? Perhaps the one with Severus could be largely fictitious."
"Look," his former self said resolutely, moving towards her, "I'm sorry I was an arse." He offered her the bottle of cognac. "For your party. It's still sealed."
"Harry," Draco soothed, edging over, and Harry, with a glare at Pansy, thumped down into the cleared space.
she find out about that, anyway?"  Harry shot back. "You'd no right to tell her. She's not family. She's not my guardian. She's not staff."
Of course, Draco reminded himself, that might not be what he thought.  The entire incident may have gone over Potter's head, and he might be smirking over something entirely unrelated -- his exaggerated opinion of his Contrivance, for example. Draco frowned. He was allowing himself to be distracted by an incident that was no worse than momentarily unpleasant. What he should really be doing was trying to get more information on the Gryffindors' Contrivance.
"Um, some. I mean it's interesting." With a sunny smile, Hannah straightened in her seat, and looked over to Millicent.
For minute, the room was silent. "Please continue, Mr. Malfoy," a man on the floor said levelly. He was standing in front of the facing box. Harry thought he might be part of the defense team.
Harry couldn't help but feel indignant that Mill and Blaise -- his friends, and clearly Draco's allies -- were not acceptable to invite. It at least meant something that Draco was uncomfortable as well.
Harry was surprised at how many people took a bead. He knew that he and Ron and Draco all would, of course, but Ginny was surprising, and Susan and Gilbert downright shocking. "Gilbert?"
Snape looked around the room with notable suspicion, but Dumbledore, in contrast, had a slightly questioning air, which Draco ignored.
On and on it went, until the final 'sincerely' ("emphasizing honesty, but without warmth, and bypassing any question of his status in her eyes"). At the end of it, Harry looked over the notes and decided they had enhanced his understanding of the invitation not one whit.
"Well, not really," Harry answered. "I mean, he's sent me letters, since that article, you know, but I can't reply.  The owls are confounded or something."
"It's hard not to get in the way," Harry said.  "We'd agreed he'd set it off, but I still tried to shield him."
, as far as I can tell. He rolls his eyes and ignores her. I just thought you should know, so you don't play into it if she tries to set you up."
"I don't know how I'll survive six weeks without you," Draco murmured, as he brushed sweaty hair back from Harry's brow. After leaving the twins outside Gringotts, Harry and Draco -- with Draco's Auror guard -- had returned to Draco's room, where Draco had sent Auror Tonks away for an hour, and without delay, led Harry to bed.
Snape's mouth almost quirked up at that. "And yet, as little as a year ago, that is exactly what I would have heard."
can, of course, but I still think he'd agree -- and that the rest of the team would pressure him to. They're incapable of believing that we might learn more than we give away."
Draco sighed, and sat on the other side of Harry, just out of reach, so the three of them faced in from a curve. "We have four options, so far." He took a large vial full of shimmering liquid from his pocket, and tilted it in the dim light. "Of these, we have only completed the base potion for one. This is the least Dark of the methods, but also the least likely to work."
Ron nodded agreement to Draco's summary. "Right. The rules have been around for hundreds of years, but it never really took off, except in some really hot places English wizards went, like Egypt."
Harry managed to stumble only a little as he stepped out onto blindingly white marble. The walls were more marble -- white shot with grey and black -- to about waist height, and then wallpaper -- well, he corrected, stretched brocade cloth -- of silver and black above that. The effect was coldly palatial. Narcissa Malfoy, a delicate vision of porcelain and gold draped in floating blue chiffon, stepped forward.
It was good to hear Draco make sense of how angry he felt. Relaxing, Harry glanced at the empty table and sighed. "No breakfast."
"I don't--" Severus tried, but Draco was already working shampoo through the thick mess and into his scalp. Lazily, Harry slid a hand up and helped a little with the back of his neck. Severus made a strangled noise and pressed against him.
"Not too badly," Harry answered slowly, as he turned over a cushion, looking for chocolate smears. "Last night, I told her in advance that I'd be out late, and I think that helped. On the other hand, if I keep doing that, she'll notice sooner who else disappears, and that it's every Friday."
At Madam Hooch's whistle, both teams kicked off into the air, and for several minutes, Harry could think about little besides dodging other flying bodies as he adjusted to the feel of the buffeting winds. Others were doing the same. When play started in earnest, it was slow, but aggressive.  The heavy Bludgers were unaffected by the conditions, but long passes of the Quaffle tended to go off-course, keeping play close and scores low. As for the little Snitch, Harry hadn't yet caught sight of it, though he did, at one point, twitch towards a yellow and white mitten that blew out of the stands.
Harry wouldn't have refused for the world, but afterwards, he thought it was just as well that he hadn't known what he was agreeing to. Remus seized his arm, and after a moment of horrible pressure, they were all three sprawled on the floor of the ramshackle house. As soon as Harry stood, Remus took his arm again, and Harry found himself in a dirty alley, stumbling in the dirty rain. When Sirius grabbed him, Harry thought it was just to keep him from falling, but then he was being compressed again, and then he was in the front garden of a tiny stone cottage.
"Of course. I've been researching the appropriate dilution...." Harry scowled at the typograph again. "And I still think there ought to be some way...."
The problem was, Harry thought, that he could still tell with his eyes closed. It wasn't that it didn't feel good -- the wet pliant grip of Malfoy's lips sliding down his cock -- but he could fee the roughness of Malfoy's chin when it brushed against his skin, hear the timbre of his voice in the occasional moan, and could sense somehow -- scent perhaps -- another aroused man over the fading scent of girl. Discomfort kept his arousal ragged at the edges, even as Malfoy kept finding new ways to vary the sensation, sucking hard, caressing with a long, loose slide of his mouth, setting a no-nonsense wanking rhythm with tight lips. He brought his fingers into it, first moving in a tight circle below his lips, and then stroking wetly up Harry's crack, along skin that was far more sensitive than Harry had ever known. When he pushed in slightly, sensation finally overwhelmed any other awareness, and Harry climaxed. It was more of relief than anything, and he had to work not to scramble
"Slytherins bowing to you?" Ron remarked, coming through once the door was clear. "Something you want to tell us, Harry?"
When Draco was breathing evenly once more, Harry cast a light warming charm over the bed, and then slowly began to turn back the covers. He was not surprised to find Draco naked beneath them. Carefully, Harry eased onto the narrow space beside him on the mattress. Draco mumbled again.
Ron flopped back onto the bed, the force of his impact sending a ripple through the drapes. Harry watched him in anxious silence.
Harry nodded quickly. That was more than he had expected, and while it did not violate any literal rules, was not what a professor would be expected to do.
"Yes. Perhaps calling the Aurors would have been more sensible, but that seemed a course that would raise more ill-feeling. As you and I were unharmed, and Miss Sinclair merely scratched, Mother treated it as any -- no, as a
"That's what he was called then. Voldemort was an ana-- al-- whatever you call those things where you rearrange the letters."
Clark nodded. "I'm pleased to meet you, Mr. Potter."  He ushered Harry towards a small, round table that had been set up in the space left beside the bed. "If you will forgive me speaking frankly, you seem rather more presentable than I had expected."
"Ron. You're with me." Harry reached across the table. He was vaguely aware of Susara racing back from somewhere and then pausing just out of reach, her fore-body raised.
"Oh, I see. Yeah. Anyway," Harry continued, "you can change a little, right? So maybe on the third and fourth weeks, I should do a glamour of how you look the second week, and then the fifth week, change it a little more...."
"Yes, of course." Draco nodded decisively.  "Hermione Granger, properly warned. It's settled." He looked back at his mother, and said: "I will endeavor to regard the decorations with a fresh mind. You would not prepare something less than beautiful, I am sure."
Draco smiled brightly. "I had thought elderflower presse and pumpkin juice for non-alcoholic beverages, but now that I think of it, we might want--" He stopped. "Herpo!"
That was enough to pull Harry back. He reviewed the team in his mind, confirming that everyone else had left. "Okay."
"I gather you think that I'm--" Harry broke off as Ron dove for the bowl, scraping a knee when he couldn't get his legs unfolded in time. He made it just in time to vomit into the shallow vessel, ending coughing and spitting. The smell of sick and acidified potion spread through the room, even as Harry vanished the mess. To the side, he saw Draco casting as well -- probably to freshen the air.
"No, they just came for the ball. Though Linnet hasn't been before. Draco wanted me to have friends here, I think."
Harry bit his lip while he calculated what he could say. "No," he answered finally. "But from the coverage, I hope what I said had some effect."
Harry opened his mouth to say no, you couldn't invite someone somewhere and expect them to work on it, but then he looked at Millicent, and thought how she was talking about this room as theirs. "That's a wonderful idea," he said, just as he decided it was. "Actually, why don't we make it part of the opening? Everyone can talk about how to fix the light stripe."
"About the Contrivance?" Harry shook his head. "Only in that I asked you to fetch me four Fairy cocoons for silk."
"Oh, yeah. Never stopped that." Harry yawned, and tugged Draco up to lie beside him. "Snape says it may mean I can learn wandless magic. He's offered to teach me."
-- which had the same problems. He wished he had at least made their second meeting closer to the first of September, so his secrets needed less protection. On the other hand, that would have given him less time to make purchases.
"Not exactly, but you can ask the people who repaired that side. When I found it -- by tripping -- only the wall on the right worked. Apparently, something about the cave-in had disrupted the charm on the left, and it needed to be recast."
"It's possible," Draco said seriously, "but I don't believe so. This is the culture we inherited, with the bickering of the Founders entrenched into procedure."
Snape's eyebrows shot up. "There, you are talking about Divination, which is not one of my strengths."
"Can't very well go and find someone else, can I? You already know, and I daresay you'll keep your mouth shut if I do."
"Harry, they were keeping you in a boot cupboard! And letting their son abuse and isolate you. And they tried to prevent you coming to Hogwarts -- they might have managed it if McGonagall hadn't told Severus about how she was running out of parchment, and it was your letter count that was rising in the ledger."
Dumbledore looked up, all weakness suddenly gone. "Oh, I quite agree, my dear boy. It is unconscionable."
"Mm." Eugene's breathing was back to normal by now. "What do you say, Harry? Would you like to spend some time with my pretty girl?"
Harry lifted their prisoner's hair and kissed the back of his neck.  "And you want to be ours, don't you Severus?"
"Diagnostically," Draco shot back, and with the eye away from Snape, winked at Harry. Harry grinned back and stepped readily into a kiss.
you in the relevant environment. I doubt any third year would have had better results; there was a werewolf to protect you from."
he wanted to take that course. He would be happy to be rid of all the Not Recommended courses as well, so that gave him one free slot. He looked back up at the word "Potions," and the strong line beneath it and shook his head. "Any other year," he muttered.
She bit her lip. He took another quick puff on the cigarette and shrugged. "So, I thought what if we're both right, but I'm from another not-quite-parallel timeline? If Sirius had died when I was fifteen, I never would have lived with him when he was really free, and I probably
"I saw him several times a year," she said.  "He was tolerable -- for a rough little boy -- until Hogwarts. Once he sorted Gryffindor, he seemed to consider it his duty to be beastly, rather than merely annoying."
," he said, hoping the curse wouldn't keep her from getting the hint. "About, well, private things."
Somehow, this made Harry more angry than the same sentiment from an enemy. "If you think that, you've never really talked to one."
"I ..." Surprise had made Draco forget his act. Harry heard the soft thump and scrape of him sitting in a chair. "It's not
present this a momentary lapse in judgment. You obviously went out of your way to study this curse."
Considering Draco's interest, Harry wasn't surprised to find him already there. He was sitting with Blaise, who had never been to the room before. Still, Harry supposed that made sense. Blaise wanted very much to return to being friends with Draco, and would certainly come along if asked. Draco looked up almost immediately.
Potter seemed to be plotting. Draco couldn't imagine any other reason for the evaluating look he was getting. "Do you know Octavius Lincoln?" he asked suddenly.
Ron thumped back against the arm of the sofa with an explosive sigh. Hermione took a long breath.  "Security?" she said.
When he had vanished, Harry closed the grate to calls.  Draco's hand settled tentatively on his shoulder, and Harry touched it lightly as he turned.
"I'm thinking about it." Ron scowled. "I'm still not sure it's a good idea. All this unity crap. I mean, we're in houses for a reason, right?"
Harry shrugged. "Well, he says that's how awkward social gatherings work -- wine and food -- and that we're definitely at an awkward stage."
"The Quiris, right." Harry hadn't given the creatures any more thought. They might not be any trouble at all, he reflected.  After all, he didn't plan to do any more Dark Arts. But there was still the matter of what he was going to do about Voldemort, and there were so many people to protect. He knew there was nothing he wouldn't do, if it came down to a question of Draco's life. After all, Lucius Malfoy was right, in a way. He
"Mm. Well, dinner is a stew. It can sit. We'll start in the hallway, just before he should be leaving the bath, and one of us can charm the door not to reclose."
When I'm getting dressed and-- stuff, my body isn't quite where I think. I have to close my eyes, sometimes, or it throws me off."  She bit her lip. "And my balance is off, sometimes."
"Over Christmas. He's friendly with Bill -- my oldest brother -- you remember how he said 'you must be Ron' that first day?"
Harry thought back. "Sirius was over the summer," he said. "And there were so many other things to say -- and so much to argue about. I didn't even remember to tell Draco, honestly.
"Of course," Snape sneered. "You can afford multiple presents for the boy, but not Wolfsbane potion."
"So you bought food you couldn't identify?"  George picked up one of the buns, bit into it, and twitched.
Harry looked at him suspiciously. He didn't believe professors could change marks three years later, but Snape didn't look like he was joking. Of course, with Snape, it was sometimes hard to tell.
Harry dreamed that Draco was fucking him in the Gryffindor Common Room, and Ron was saying he should be painted brown, and Dean was offended. Hermione offered to start an organization for the acceptance of anal sex, and before he could stop her was designing obscene buttons with Sophia, except Snape came in and confiscated them, and seemed to think they were Harry's fault. Draco, obliviously, wrapped a string of beads tight around Harry's cock.
With that done, it was time to cover the matter of Voldemort's name, which was both the easiest -- he really had just been telling a story! -- and the hardest -- he was genuinely ashamed of the moment. He rolled it back to talking about finding Ginny's dying body, and moved it past when he had erased the words. "In an orphanage," he said. "So he could have
“No, it’s fine,” Julian answered. “Mr. Holt and Miss Hanley have organized study groups for fourth-years and under. Most of the prefects are scheduled to supervise for two hours, but Miss Parkinson agreed that you should be exempt, as you will be too distracted now, and might have duties as Head Boy later. I was just sent to let you know.” He nodded at Harry. “Best wishes for your recovery, Potter.”
Severus seemed utterly befuddled by Draco pulling away. He stood, motionless, until Harry brought the flogger down again, with almost the force of his last blows.
"Draco. We're at the sofa. I am going to sit down, and then I want you across my lap, understood? You are welcome to speak, shout, comment -- anything but ask me what happens next."
With a rude gesture, Ron stormed off, and at a glance and nod from Harry, Hermione followed him, and Neville followed her.
Reluctantly, Harry nodded. The matter of the Dursleys was a dead horse. "If properly inspired, yeah."
"I suppose." He would rather have followed the Weasleys out to the pitch and watched them practice. "Keep my place; I need to get my books."
Draco nodded, but didn't move. He forced himself to slouch and to shift his weight in an uneasy sort of way. "Could I see it?" he burst out.  "The Contrivance?"
"I see." She pursed her lips for a moment. "I know that Professor Snape has talked to you on occasion--"
Harry nodded. "I thought the Wednesday gathering went well," he offered. "Not as obviously so as the Quidditch players, but...."
He shivered as the smooth tip of Draco's wand slid under his shirt, and along his skin from navel to collarbone. Then Draco tipped it out, whispered an incantation, and drew it back, making a smooth cut from collar to hem.
Harry's eyes closed. Draco might be right -- about that part.  Growing up as a bastard would be hard in the Muggle world, and he could imagine it as unendurable, in a society where even someone like Auror Kingsley talked about "a Hanley, at the Malfoys'." He took a quick breath and looked at the world again. Here, it was mostly masses of grey stone. "Let's go flying."
"Um..." The image that conjured was not conducive to concentration. Harry took a quick breath and threw all the will he could muster into casting. A moment later, he was tilting with a yelp -- echoed by Draco -- as the floor went squishy under his feet. He threw himself back upright . . . into Draco's flailing arm. They grabbed at each other and tumbled down to the stone, which felt less like a mattress than a pile of feather-stuffed duvets. Harry exploded into laughter, and was gratified to hear Draco do the same.
"Professor Hecksban worked in Egypt," Draco cut in, eager to move on. "He says it's still just a matter of finding where it's attached."
By the time Harry started the potion, they had missed lunch. Draco went out to the kitchens to get food and returned just Harry was dropping the first bugbear claw into the noxious brew. The hard, black hook lay for a moment on top of the thick, heaving potion before a bubble opened with a splat and then closed over it. Harry rolled the next one over in his fingers, feeling the heavy darkness of it. This was a creature that lived in the shadows of forbidden places, waiting for prey. Like a Boggart, it was both more and less than it seemed. Some people said the claws were the only real part of it.  He dropped the second claw in and let it sink. The third claw was the largest.  Harry wondered that it wasn't sharper. Contemplatively, he ran it up the inside of his arm, leaving a white line on his skin.
Harry collapsed back on the bed and stared up at the ceiling. It seemed the only possible response. "One of?"
Potter went up on tiptoes to have slack for a shrug. Draco thought he might be better at this than he had seemed.
Nodding, Harry folded the paper and tucked it away.  Hermione gave an exasperated huff, and Draco arched one pale eyebrow as he looked over at her.
"Harry!" Hermione rushed forward. After Harry's shout, she could have sworn she had seen a flash of cream and green, and a disturbing waver in the space between herself and her friend. Now he was staring down at the ground, or perhaps at the tip of the sword.
An hour before dawn, Harry crept out of his bed, put on his invisibility cloak, and made his way down to Slytherin. He entered without incident -- there was no one in the common room, and the password hadn't changed since he had last heard it -- and made his way to the seventh-year boys' dormitory. Nott's attempt on Harry had not been publicly acknowledged.  Harry knew that Snape had disciplined the young man privately, but that still left him in residence. Snape had decided that it was better to have him under watch than at large and probably serving Voldemort, and after some argument, Harry had agreed not to dispute that to Dumbledore or McGonagall. For the most part, he thought that Snape was right, but it did add the spice of real danger to sneaking through the room where Nott and Blaise slept.
"That's not a name. You're not named Harry, are you?  It's Harold or Henry or Harriot or something."
"What shall we do tonight?" Linnet asked brightly, taking a place on the other side of Draco from Harry. "A round of 'I Never' to welcome the new recruits?"
"For what? You can call me Harry if you like. As long we're not in some official meeting with Angelina and people from other department."
"All right, everyone.  Business first. I have some announcements, and then we can debate suggestions for new members."
Malfoy smirked at him. Slowly, she curled one leg, turning towards Harry as she slid her foot from Harry's ankle to his arse. "Afraid to be naked with a man, Potter?"
"Did you want me to--" Harry began, but she was already shaking her head and reaching for his flies.
Harry made himself think, rather than bursting out with a denial or protest. "Among other things, I'm helping her with Charms.  That's why I've been doing more research than usual."
"Not exactly." Letting out a long breath, Draco shifted away from Harry. "I'll need a Pensieve to record it properly. That may need to wait until I can get home -- I think the headmaster may control the only one at school. Would someone clear away that blood potion please? I'm going to be ill."
"It's always ambiguous. 'Miss Weasley' isn't, but it makes feel like everyone's treating me as a child. It will have to be Ginny."
"They're all over, sir," she said. "The sales into stores looked legit, with well-forged papers, most mentioning O'Brian & Fisk Limited, a known supplier of animal-based potions supplies. Their usual seller for this area is away on his honeymoon, so people weren't suspicious of a seller no one had seen before."
"I suppose," Harry said. "Though it was rather unprofessional of her, wasn't it? I mean, what if she'd had to go for her wand?"
"And you have no appreciation for a developing art," he said sharply, and turning, held out the glass.
"Well, I wouldn't put up with that! How do you ever know where you stand with him?" Draco grimaced. "I can't imagine Hermione would find that adequate."
"Just manners," he lied, aware of other housemates looking on. "She has to invite me, but I'm not expected to accept or anything."
"Well, Hermione doesn't yet," Harry said. "I'm planning on inviting her next week, but I thought I should talk to people first."
He shrugged. "I'm not particularly good at it. I made him a brooch, once, but that was out of gold."
"Well, that was what I wanted to ask about," Harry broke in. "Power. I only stand out in Defense against the Dark Arts, I think."
Ron led him, in tumultuous silence, to the statue of the One-Eyed Witch, and then to the space below, which he flooded with light in a casual manner that either of them would have envied a year earlier. Harry, perplexed, stayed silent.
At another such sound, Harry gripped the cheeks of Draco's arse, and pulled himself as close as he could, not even minding when Draco's mouth went slack, because he was crying out around Harry's cock, and Harry wanted to tell him how sexy he was, how perfect, how much he mattered, but not at the expense of stopping, not when he was clearly so close....
He was an absolute heel, Harry thought, even as he returned the squeeze of her fingers and gave her assumption tacit approval. "Of course not!" Rolling his eyes let him look away from her. "I've told them I started a dueling club -- most of the things we need are used in healing potions." He cocked his head, giving her a sly glance as he let go. "Have any use for several pints of Murtlap essence?"
, he wanted to say, but that wasn't really true, of course. Both of them knew he would give Draco up for a wife, someday. Having forbidden Draco to ignore that, he shouldn't do so himself. Instead he held Draco close and kissed him with a need that had not been at all abated by sex.
"That's it," said Harry. "Breathe. For as long as you are in my bindings, you are under my protection. You know I'm good for that."
After a moment, the man cleared his throat. "Theodore, please continue, but restrain yourself to the matters relevant to Draco."
The 'study session,' of course, was a divination review in the Uncommon Room. Hermione -- or possibly Hermione and Draco -- had decided that they should all meet in the morning to discuss the sessions thus far.
Frowning, the woman led him off for an immediate test. Harry didn't apparate on his first two tries, but when the third was interrupted by a red flash and a loud bang, he found himself behind his tester, gasping for breath.
That grew faster, and then frantic and graceless, spurred on by Draco's rising response. Harry's jaw began to ache, and just as he started to fear that he wouldn't last until Draco came, the tone of Draco's sounds changed as his throat opened, and with a choked
Harry half expected Ron, who was only separated from Parvati by Neville, to move, but he squared his shoulders and sat deeper in his wing-back chair instead. Harry thought he might need the security of being between Gryffindors -- although sitting alone -- or he might want to get his first round over with. He had an obstinate look that strengthened the latter theory.
"Oh, I'd like that." Malfoy pushed the finger in, effectively derailing any train of that thought Harry might have had. "I'm bound to come too fast after all this."
They were at lunch, sitting with the other Slytherin and Gryffindor students. Ruthven was delightedly terrified by Sajid's tales of sixth-year Care of Magical Creatures, and Harry wondered if the Slytherin realized that Sajid was a Muggleborn. Seymour had figured that out on Christmas, he was sure, but might have kept quiet about it.
