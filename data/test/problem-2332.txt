“These are professionals, Harry. You deserve a night of pampering and quite frankly so do I. Do you have any idea how many boils I biopsied today?” Draco challenged, shivering slightly at the memory. “Come on, it will be fun to have our face masks done together.”
At the moment they had a job.
Now that made Harry smile wide for the first time all day. “Yeah? Me too. I wish this wasn’t how everyone found out about us.”
While he only used the sink for no, Harry got on with the freshening up with a remarkable enthusiasm. When Draco returned all that was left for Harry was to clean his glasses. There was a knock on the door and Harry almost dropped them.
“Five minutes.”
“I’m aware.”
They’d rehearsed for cues and marks the day before, so that wasn’t a problem. What was a problem was the crowd of faces staring up at them. They burst into applause immediately when Harry and Draco stepped into view.
“Yes, yes I do,” Harry urged. He never considered himself a selfish lover, and being able to see Draco Malfoy come undone from his doing was the subject of many a wet dream of Harry’s. He wanted to be the one who pleased him in every way.
“Because you need someone to pass on your name and hopefully, just maybe, have the kid come out just as sick as you,” Maggie informed him.
Putting on a defiant face, Harry crumbled in seconds. “Fine! Shag me, Mr. Malfoy-Potter!” What kind of roleplay even was this? Was Harry a secretary of some sort? Or was he a mediwizard, or—
Why Grace had requested a blood test was beyond Draco. It would take a day to process with the work load he had, and she hadn’t even bled when she fell.
A loud ‘clink’ came from whatever Ron’s shovel had struck. “Hey, I think this is it!”
“The money?” Draco collected himself enough to ask, popping back into view of the webcam.
Blaise stood to give his friend a sad clap on the back. “Looks like you’re joining the dark side, mate.”
“Then you beat the shit out of him.”
“Harry, wake up, it’s me. You’re having a nightmare,” Draco urged him. “It’s not real, Harry, but I am. Wake up!”
Narcissa hid her laugh.
She was younger then, with less wrinkles and worry-lines haunting her face. After all, who in the world had it better than her? She was glamorous, rich, and blonde. She made other women’s husbands gawk and kept her own husband faithful. That was more than Goyle’s wife could say, anyway. Cheating was a popular activity for Goyle and Parkinson Sr., and it would have been for Nott Sr. if he hadn’t, you know, murdered his wife.
“Yeah, but the shitty acting makes it much less believable.”
The end of the day came, miraculously, and that meant returning to the apparation-approved section quickly so as to not have to answer more questions from his well-meaning ‘bestie’.
“Mr. Potter,” Trelawney said, closing in on her new target. “Why don’t you share what you see in your partner’s iguana bones with the class?”
“None taken. You’re a terrible student.”
“He is literally sixteen. Sixteen.
Of course, Draco was the sort to never think apologies were quite enough. “Well, you did. This isn’t Hogwarts and I’m not your fairy godmother,” he snapped. He knew that they were searching for a child, not a mother, but still. Draco couldn’t let every pregnant teenager into his home for a bloody interview. “You are going to fill out a form.”
Harry huffed before leaving the room, forgetting to say a fond farewell to the man who he currently despised.
“Merlin, will you all lay off?” Ron defended his friend, slinging an arm around Harry. “Or at least get the man something to drink if you’re going to hound him like this? See, this is why it’s hard to come home to you people sometimes. Come on, mate, let’s get you properly buzzed. Want anything, Draco?”
It was high-pitched, a wail that carried across the fountain and the nearby shops. The first few seconds of it were gravelly in texture, but the rest came out as smoothly as a river. She held it at that one excruciating note for only Merlin knows how long.
Harry hummed. “Never doubted you for a second.”
The last thing Harry wanted to do was waste it. Moving offstage like he had been instructed, Harry ducked into the tech booth.
“No,” Jordan replied, a little shake coming to her hands. “This is my boyfriend pulling a prank on me.”
More so than their regular kinks, of course.
Draco realized he’d have to cushion this poor girl’s fall. Of course Brooke was lying. “If,” he offered. “Totally hypothetically, you find out she was lying about her appearance, what would that mean to you? What would you do?”
On the wall a magical clock had begun to tick down their time, and Harry paid close attention to the second hand until his glasses became too hot and foggy to see through. He took them off, shaking out his hair as the time eked by. Why did ten minutes suddenly feel so long?
Hey! I have four real days of school left. I think I’m going to cry. SUMMER IS SO CLOSE I CAN TASTE IT AAAAGHHH! I’m gonna write so much fic this summer. TW for dumb cishets.
Harry’s strategic mentioning of a library caught Hermione off-guard. She raised a brow in interest. “The library?”
Draco’s hand planted themselves on Harry’s chest, giving him leeway to push his taut hole up Harry’s length even faster. His arse cheeks jolted up and down in an uneven pattern with his thrusts, his arse smacking down on Harry’s legs whenever he pulled up on his cock.
“I’m okay,” said Monica. Her voice was so high and quiet.
“Too late,” Ginny grinned. She always tried to sneak out of babysitting duty for Ron and Hermione’s babies since she drew the line at changing nappies. “At least what Blaise and I bought for you will help.”
The living room that Draco stood in now looked like the victim of a hasty cleaning spell storm, but was otherwise unremarkable. He did note the Safeword scroll on the coffee table with some delight. Was this where Harry had written his responses? “Harry?” he called out to the flat. The walls were mostly bare, and his voice echoed off of them.
Harry felt motivated to add his own opinion to the clusterfuck of ideas that had sprouted in their parlor. “Look, I get it,” he sighed. “You’re in a messed-up place and things might not seem so clear right now. I’m sorry that your aunt and uncle did that to you.”
Sure, Theo had a bit of an affinity for joints and bongs, but that wasn’t awful in Harry’s eyes. It was subsequently better than any kind of hard drug.
“And you were plenty of an ass back!”
“And where is that?”
of Harry’s body when they had sex. There he was, proud as a peacock, rocking on Harry’s admittedly mostly-flat chest like it was all he knew how to do.
“Ah!” The bags under Umbridge’s eyes lit up with wonder. “That’s the one. Pity,” she said, using her plain and chipped nails to bring the photo closer to her. “He was a real charmer back in school. I always thought Regulus had an ickle crush on him.”
“Do you know what it means?”
“I don’t know!” Theo yelled, stuffing the ring back into the box and into his pocket. “I just… I bought it! Mindlessly.”
It was a firm belief of Harry’s that Draco looked irresistible in any position, but the way his pale skin caught the sunrise through their curtains and let it drip down his back was particularly beautiful. Harry leaned over him to kiss that back.
“Rule Four: You must always be honest with your limits, and never push yourself to take more pain or kink than is sane for my sake. I know it’s a shitty word, ‘sane’, but ‘safe, sane, and consensual’ is a movement now, really. Sane, what does sane mean really?” Draco repeated, giving Harry’s hands another little squeeze.
Why the hell did Colin have to be so sweet? It was really making Theo’s angst over marriage and his parental situation feel less relevant, and he wasn’t at all sure how he felt about that. “No, I’m fine here.”
He trudged up to his room, the master bedroom as he was now the master of this house, and lit all the candles in his room with a flick of his wand. This was his sanctuary, his place from which he could pretend the rest of the house looked this nice.
“Well, maybe if you say what your rules are, I’ll tell you what I honestly think of them.” Harry hadn’t a clue how to navigate this, especially when there was a gorgeous man pressed to his side. Harry made more room for him, and Draco shifted closer.
Draco used his wand to make a small incision on the present almost surgically. While he’d never perform any medical service while drunk he was pretty impressed with himself for getting the rectangle out of the wrapping paper with as few tears as possible.
“Please, take whatever you want,” Draco insisted. “Nothing is too extravagant a request. Your enjoyment is the only measure of worth here.”
“Lullaby, and goodnight, in the skies stars are bright,” Draco sang, voice low and private for only Harry to hear. “May the moon’s silvery beams, bring you sweet dreams…”
“Fucking straight people.”
“Yes, well, you’ve got nothing but time, I suppose,” Lucius went on, slicing his asparagus up and spearing a stalk of it onto his fork. “Being unemployed.”
Okay, so maybe I did the thing again where I take forever writing the last chapter, but I hope this is sweet enough for you to forgive me. A lot has happened in these past months (a new job, a year’s anniversary in quarantine), and I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for listening to my madness on this one. Your love, support, and readership means the world to me in a world where cruelty, ignorance, and fear reign supreme. Don’t ever let anyone tell you how to love when you’re consenting adults, and let your freak flag fly. That’s it for now.
This one made the hairs on Draco’s neck stand up when Harry told him about it.
Without answering any questions, Draco gave a grin that seemed to reveal nothing and everything all at once.
“Because you cannot technically witness magic until I fill out the proper registration.”
Into the Floo they went, and there they were once again on marble floors with the sunset shining through the arched white windows.
However, the modeling picture got a hit. “Original source is Ford Models,” Harry read aloud, opening up a sleek gallery page of photos.
Draco licked another stripe up and this time lingered around his hole in achingly-slow circles. Harry’s wispy sighs guided and encouraged Draco all the way, and came to a peak when Draco flicked his tongue deep inside the center of the puckered skin.
“And my only,” Draco nodded sagely. “It is the two of us against the injustices of the world, just as I said before. We have so many more wrongs to right, Harry. Have you ever been to a wizarding amusement park? Or a proper masseuse?”
“I am not calling MTV and asking them for their Macklemore connections,” Draco repeated, highly offended that Harry would even consider making him do something so wildly embarrassing.
“Thank you,” Narcissa responded, looking over her shoulder to cast a reassuring smile to Harry. “This estate has been in the family since the 1600’s. The Manor is—was—older but I’m sure you know that.”
That music to Draco’s ears, along with every moan slipping out of Harry when he slipped into him. Their skin made obscene, wet sounds slapping together with this much lubricant coating Draco.
With a slight hum of agreement—fuck, indeed—Harry took more and more in, gagging slightly and pulling off, but then going in and trying again. He was woefully out of practice. Harry swore that what he lacked in experience he would make up for in eagerness, in willingness to try and put his all into it.
Finally, Harry heard the tone. “Hello, Chris,” he tried out. The name felt wrong to say out loud. “This is Harry Potter and I’m from the TV show Catfish. We’ve just met Ruth—a really lovely girl—and she wants to come see you. I know you’ve had things come up in the past that prevented you two from meeting, but she needs to see you as soon as possible. Call me back for details.”
A fair number of them were also chatting about other Professors, their worries for the schoolyear, who got haircuts or grew up over the summer, but the name on everyone’s lips was ‘Professor Malfoy’.
“Because we gave you some of your way, and now you’re giving us some of our way.” He placed the embroidered napkin before him on his lap. “You wanted a child that looked like us, and while it isn’t actually even your child to begin with, we accommodated you. We have it narrowed down to fifty candidates.”
When the doors opened all Harry could do was stare, mouth agape like he was trying to catch flies.
The whole ordeal would have made Grace feel proud in the feminine solidarity, but the baby wasn’t planned. Grace was giving her up after this and would never see her again except in gossip columns and news about Draco and Harry.
The clue had to be talking about those begonias, they just had to be.
“Still.”
“While I am his partner first,” Draco continued. “I also consider myself a consulting physician on Harry here’s health. I can speak to my teaching him coping mechanisms and giving him alleys in which to be successful and free, but I am not the font of this newfound happiness. It is all in you, Harry. It always has been.”
“Roots?” Maybe he was a tree. Maybe he’d been the Whomping Willow this whole time.
Ushering their remaining family out of the door, they would do just that.
“Swear on a stack of potions books?”
“You two are disgusting,” Blaise decided before sulking over to the parlor so that he wouldn’t have to suffer through a bowl of that fruity nonsense. “And I am shocked that I am still friends with you.”
“You had better be kidding,” Draco snarked right back. “Because I was thinking of going easy on you for your lesson today for yesterday’s exemplary performance, but now that’s all out the window.”
“’Brooke lives in Mason, Michigan with her father, a paraplegic who needs her assistance like my father needs mine. First we bonded over that, and things only grew from there’,” Harry read. “’I’ve tried to set up meetings with her, but she is too afraid of her father finding out that she’s gay for me to get anywhere near her. Please, please help me meet her, she won’t even let me talk to her on the phone or cam her in case her father overhears’.”
Jordan laughed. “Oh, come off it, Shaun. When can I see you again?” That Shaun was always a joker. Jordan vaguely remembered a joke of his getting her into bed with him. She loved funny blokes.
Then they came in—the first years down the center aisle led by none other than Deputy Headmistress Aurora Sinistra of Astronomy. She set the first years in a line by alphabetical order in a hurry. “Make way, make way, we will first hear a few words from the Headmistress.”
“Fuck,” said Harry, voice climbing in volume and pitch.
It was so neatly-placed—had Draco expected him to come in here?
“So you are leaving out things you want me to do.” Harry wasn’t accusing, but he’d figured Draco out soon enough.
The first porn he’d seen of it wasn’t even that good. It was some bored-looking twink being tossed over the lap of some famous muscle guy or another and being spanked until his arse turned bright red and then being thrown onto a dingy old bed and getting fucked.
*** *** ***
“Fine,” Draco agreed, noting on the hotel clock that they’d stayed up past midnight and would have to pick a case the next day regardless. He hopped out of Harry’s bed and into his own, shedding his pants and turning off the light somewhere along the way. “Sleep tight.”
Ron blinked and turned to Malfoy with the two officers clearly trying to sprain something of his. “Put him down. Only get him if he runs,” Ron allowed cautiously.
“Exactly,” she smirked, rather pleased with herself and her lesbian sex.
Draco pushed the second finger in with a shuddery breath. “Call me that again.”
“Diversity…?” Maybe this was too snooty.
Opening his eyes long enough to look into Draco’s grey ones, pupils wide with mischief and excitement, Harry did just that.
“Ron?” Hermione tried, note in her left hand.
“Stress, sexual activity, certain foods, any kind of infection she might have, excessive amniotic fluid…” Draco listed off of the top of his head. “It’s most likely just an anomaly. My tests didn’t show any existing diseases or structural issues.”
Draco and Harry exchanged looks. “Call again,” Draco asked of him.
In response, Draco reeled Harry in closer to taste those soft, pink lips of his. Harry tasted like chocolate, which really only further encouraged Draco to give him a swish of his tongue along Harry’s bottom lip.
“I dare you to tell me if you’d cheat on Maggie if you knew you could get away with it.”
Harry groaned. “I am,” he argued weakly.
From a shelf to the side Draco fetched a large, pink bath bomb that glittered under the low lights. He dropped it into the water with a heavy splash, watching it bob slightly as the whole bath began to blush pink. Spectral pink butterflies emerged as the bath bomb twirled in the water, sending rays of light out from the cracks emerging in it.
Draco was finally getting to do some good in the world, shape some young minds and make sure they didn’t make his mistakes by falling in with the dark side of magic.
Once someone got Draco talking about how Azkaban used to be run, it was hard to get him to stop. He would rant and rave about the blatant disregard for human rights the prison had. After a short stay there, Draco could see his own father fray at the edges. Dementors were a form of psychological torture, Draco said, and that fell under the ‘cruel and unusual punishment’ label.
“He wants to meet Ruth, and I quote, ‘because she deserves the truth’,” Harry pointed out. At least this person wasn’t messing with their heads anymore. It was pretty clear from the text that ‘Chris’ knew the sham was over.
“When isn’t it?” Maggie closed the letter and wrestled her red curls back into a ponytail. It was far too hot in her flat for her wild locks to be set free. They always soaked up the sun, even when she had nothing else on.
Lucius cocked an eyebrow. “Is it a deceased relative’s name?”
“I think I did, too,” Harry couldn’t help but agree. He settled in beside Draco, nudging their thighs together. “And I believe face masks were mentioned?”
“Any wine you have is fine,” Draco insisted.
His favorite part about walking alone in the hallway was overhearing the conversations around him. Well, his first favorite part was not hearing Ron and Hermione’s flirtations for a second longer than necessary, but snooping was still fun.
This one is for the fabulous Alijandra's Editor who suggested a detention scene! Ah, I love when these two homos are stuck together in a small classroom. It’s also so strange writing them as immature teenagers! I’ll be bringing in some characters I haven’t used in HP fics in the past, so let’s see how this goes!
Harry looked down expecting some sort of elaborate hand tattoo. Colin was acting especially persnickety that day, after all. Who knew what he was up to.
“Nevermind, I take it back. Ambush him all you like,” Theo waved on.
“Thank you,” she said again. It felt a bit like a break-up.
Harry hummed, nudging their feet together under the surface. “I like the sound of that.” He wanted to kiss Draco’s cheek and had to restrain himself from ruining the even coverage he’d achieved. He settled on taking Draco’s hand and holding it close to his chest.
Harry shook his head and turned to the two-way mirror that Ron was peering in on from outside the cold, grey interrogation room. “She’s got nothing, Ron. Bring in the next one.” A little negative prodding wasn’t an illegal interrogation tactic, after all.
Harry went into shock for a few seconds before he could properly respond. “Draco, you are absolutely disgusting.”
“Who’s the most cunning, shrewd of them all?”
Harry could hardly believe it. Was Draco really right about the clothing thing? He opened his mouth to reply when the blonde himself cut Harry off.
“I do,” Harry admitted as he sat down on the couch to the side of Draco’s office. “So what do you want to talk about? Considering we are skipping many parts of this conversation.”
Grace would sign whatever the hell she needed to get this kid out of her realm of responsibility, even if the woman telling her to sign had smeared her austere lipstick on her teeth when putting it on. Maybe her ponytail was pulled too tight and it was starting to get to the poor woman. Materialism-wise, the rich woman. Lucius compensated them well.
Draco tilted his head to the side. “I’m not sure how much it was. I just picked out a model and my parents bought it.”
“Good bone structure, excellent, soft skin—you’re quite the specimen.”
There were rarely moments where Severus Snape felt comfortable, but the level of discomfort he was in was pretty astounding in that moment. He collected his bag and the papers he would be failing everyone on later that night in a rush. “You two are working together and that’s final. I would suggest meeting in the library to finish up, since… Well. Draco’s house has valuables that aren’t nailed down and Potter’s house is a closet.”
“I know all about being short-staffed,” Hermione nodded. “My position in the Ministry is to assist those underrepresented by magical law and establish protections for them. It’s working within existing systems that are flawed, but we get as much good done as we can.”
Harry, being a Malfoy-Potter, supposed he could give it a try. “Just a small slice.”
“And you’re
Sure, some kids on the server were still a special kind of Warcraft stupid—or hadn’t known they’d picked the queer server when they signed up for the game—but for the most part they were bearable human beings.
“Ah,” Draco struggled for breath for a moment for how silky-soft Harry felt inside.
“I mean,” Draco tried. “If it’s about Care of Magical Creatures I’m not an expert exactly.”
“I dunno,” Harry shrugged, gripping Draco in return as he came down from his submissive high. “I guess I just got emotional during.”
“What’s the next note say?” Harry asked when he noticed the piece of paper. No way in hell was he reaching into the box that contained his current reminder of the biological apocalypse his home planet would one day endure. Harry was poetic like that.
“Yeah. I’ll see you tomorrow.” The redhead leaned over the desk to give Draco a flick on the side of the head. “What was that for!”
He carried the plate in one hand and the milk in the other hand, The Hobbit squeezed under his arm so Draco would only need to make one trip with all of the required items.
“That was when I thought we were on the same page, you deviant. We were the ones who wanted you and Draco to have children,” he pointed out. “And then you had to go to get on your moral high horse like you always do.” A Potter had ended the line of Malfoys in the world. A
“You bought a hen for them to gangbang?” Draco asked, still laughing. In his head, Draco imagined the pearly white beauties draped in silks and smelling of pungent spices, rubbing their necks together in a hazy, smoky and steaming room with some kind of heavy music setting a beat to their debauchery.
Harry walked back to the couch and turned the television on to some sitcom he didn’t recognize and turned down the volume so he could hear the buzz but not understand the jokes. The screen in front of him seemed to be showing a wacky day at the science fair for some hapless-but-loving family, something he couldn’t really relate to but that was for the best, anyway.
, Draco thought bitterly to himself and got dressed.
Draco considered it, and the deliberation didn’t take long. He reached into the box and grabbed the largest one, biting into it without thinking. He closed his eyes for a moment as he chewed, and opened them again to see Harry beside him.
Olivia ran down the stairs so fast she could have been gliding. Sirius had once tried to slide down the bannister to some unfortunate results, but she was young and lithe.
Draco sighed. Lucius never could bring himself to be specific about this, could he? “He and I are together,” Draco answered succinctly. That was the sort of clarity his poor, confused father needed.
“Thank you,” Draco replied, genuinely flattered that Harry thought that and ignoring the harsher implications of how Harry would indeed know.
Harry swallowed down his own fears. “Yeah. Let’s get it back to the station.”
“Sugar covered in gold-leaf, most likely,” Draco guessed.
“No,” Draco admitted. “But apparently I’m too much of a dick when I tell the truth.”
“Who, who even reads The Prophet?” Harry asked in genuine disbelief. Maybe this wasn’t a big deal, and people would see it as a desperate attempt to bring their names down.
“Who was it?” Draco demanded. He knew that Harry and he had both lived in the school district since birth. It had to be someone from their grade.
He knocked on the door for both Lorraine’s truth and an end to whatever kind of white-rapper circus this was turning into.
“I think I’ll still have to interrogate you.”
But in the present Draco was pleased, and the room was done and ready to be stocked. “Thank you, Harry, I really couldn’t have done this without you. I was experiencing such a mental block with how this house is tied to my family and my sense of self.”
“Fine!” Draco mumbled. “’M sorry. Though I’m sure a blowjob could have articulated that.”
Harry himself was on his way to eleventh year health.
Harry smiled again, this time bigger and thank goodness it was, because at least those high smiling cheeks of his could then cover up the fact that he looked about ready to cry. “Thank you, Daddy. You won’t regret this,” he whispered and drew Draco in for a tight but awkwardly-angled hug on the floor.
“I don’t know if you remember how well that went last time—“
“So that means,” Theo spoke up, hands shaking. “That out of all the people in the world, you kill
The hat laughed above him, ruffling his hair. “You are, but you’re not. You have their curiosity and their inner strength, but you prefer a quieter life.”
“That they were. Here.” Draco took his wand from the side of the tub and murmured a spell to open the cabinet from which he’d grabbed the bath bomb. A tube of avocado-and-clay face mask material floated their way until Draco could close his hand around it and snatch it out of the air. “This one will be perfect for you.”
“We were actually on opposite sides,” Harry laughed sickly. “Even though he was never really on their side, he was just trying to keep safe. It’s sort of too complicated to explain in such a short amount of time.”
for yourself.”
“What?” Harry scoffed. “You’re the one who thinks he’s so great when you’re actually a complete jerk.”
Zeke didn’t really know how to respond to that. So, he just stood there in the pinnacle of teenage futility. He was in no power to change the situation in front of him and was attempting to be a ‘better man’ by respecting the requests of women whose lives he had come deathly close to ruining for good. The end result was him shutting his mouth.
. Merlin, I still can see you as the little kid who kept trying to take my picture in second year. Who’s going to do your wedding photography?”
Only his ‘brother’ knew who the mystery man online had turned out to be, while Pansy, Blaise, Greg, and Vince were in the dark. Draco didn’t have the time or the patience to explain what was going on to them and honestly, Theo was the least judgmental of Draco’s inner circle.
“Don’t ruin the moment, you dick,” Harry said before pinching Draco’s side.
to be? In
He sighed, looking down to his sleeping boyfriend. There would have to be some way to get the flower in on the cluster of violets and roses already positioned in Theo’s black hair. The Slytherin was a thankfully heavy sleeper, so Colin had even been able to sneak in some little buttercup flowers in his eyebrows.
“Hey,” Ron said quietly to his partner. “What are you thinking about?” When Harry kept things in, it only made things worse for his mental health—which was a deep concern of Ron’s. “Talk to me.”
Leading the crowd, Draco came to pat his friend on the back once he lowered his vice-grips on Lucius and Harry. “Hey,” Draco said as if they were meeting for tea.
Seeing Draco’s spirits lighten, Harry used his other arm to anchor Draco close to him. “I won’t bring Theo in unless we’re entirely out of options. You have my word.”
“Can you call me down when dinner’s ready?” she asked. Olivia would show them how grateful she was; she had to. This was more than she ever deserved.
Oh. My. Drarry. Bridezillas’ Marriage Boot Camp is on my television at this very second. This is the show that started it all! When I looked into the eyes of an entitled bride with too much money and too many anxiety problems, I saw Draco Malfoy screaming at a waiter. Bridezillas gives me hope for the human race, man. Look at how far we’ve come as a species. God bless us everyone one.
“Please, do not call it a quest,” Draco sighed, stepping away and making the gestures that he was about to apparate away soon.
“Was that how it was? I honestly can’t remember,” Draco lied.
“But if you just wank each other off, is that sex or is it mutual masturbation or—?”
Draco leaned forward thinking Harry was saying something to hear a stifled little snore. He laughed—had Harry seriously fallen asleep so fast? Wasn’t he always saying it was hard for him to do that?
Draco hollowed out his cheeks and sucked hard. His nails dug into Harry’s hips, sure to leave bruises.
“Five!” Harry cried out. “Six!”
“Theodore,” Marcus greeted him solemnly, voice crackling over the bugged room.
Every time he tried to confess it the words stopped flowing. His mouth went dry and his throat scratchy, and he backed down from admitting how he truly felt each time. A mad, feral part of him wanted to just shout it out now, but that wasn’t the way he wanted Draco to first hear that he loved him. Regardless of whether Draco loved him back, Harry wanted his confession to be in a moment of mutual admiration.
From behind Remus, Padfoot barked happily at the small children pawing to touch him. When he licked one little girl’s face, they all shrieked with delight.
“Just a tad,” Draco grinned to hide how his heart was pounding.
Harry smiled. He knew what that rush was like.
Maddeningly, Harry tugged at himself and bit back the noises spilling from his mouth so that the Dursleys couldn’t hear.
When they entered the small apartment, Draco was disappointed to see that there were no Macklemore posters covered in mysterious substances anywhere.
Even with an agreeable fellow passenger, however, Draco and Harry still found ways to get on each other’s nerves.
“That’s nice, Draco.”
“Don’t you think,” Harry said, hand trembling as he reached for his drink. He took the glass and brought the straw to his lips. Merlin, he was so scared, but so was Draco from how white he’d turned, and it seemed genuine. Had this truly been without scheme? Was this
“Why not call him again?” Draco asked with subdued suspicion. One instance of a male voice on a phone call didn’t prove anything.
“For the show,” Draco clarified. “It’d be confusing to the audience if we used last names.”
Draco was under no illusion of what a purist arse he’d been those days.
His head felt light. Harry was dizzyingly happy, and in no mood to find his footing in this strange state of bliss.
“It’s not my fault the bottle rocket crashed into the school,” Seamus grumbled to his boyfriend. “If I was just a foot farther…”
“Wait, really?”
There was a reason Harry never talked about Regulus with Sirius. His godfather was plagued with guilt for the way his brother died. In Sirius’ mind, he had let Regulus stay in that abusive house, so he was responsible for his becoming a Death Eater.
“This is a violation of your privacy, the both of you. We need to call the lawyers. How could someone have intercepted a direct owl?” Lucius spiraled.
A smile spread on Draco’s lips. “You give as good as you get, you know that?” he asked.
Draco let out a disgusted sigh. “So you did do this just to get in my pants. I should have known. You’ve always been so in creepy lust with me, Potter.”
“That’s it, that’s my boy,” Draco comforted, putting a hand over Harry’s heart to feel how it was nearly beating out of his chest. “That’s it, my heart. You’ve done so well.” Draco’s hand trailed down his chest and over his stomach, resting just inches above his cock. “Would you like your reward?”
Sometimes, how fond he was of that kinky fuck was a little ridiculous.
“I see how hard you are, love,” Draco murmured. “And how hard it is for you to keep standing like this. I’ll take you down, and take you as mine.”
“Harry,” he responded after he’d disappeared completely into the other man. “My Harry. Don’t you dare come until I say so.”
Draco knew who she meant by ‘us’. “You would have to somehow have broken into Safeword’s vaults if it were one of you,” Draco waved off, having already considered the possibility with Harry. “Or stolen my personal copy of the messages, which I have now burned.”
“Apparation safety is no joke,” Draco insisted, wobbling slightly.
“La la la la la!”
The room was quiet then, but in a comforting sort of way.
Harry cracked a smile. There was that banter.
“What…?” Draco pointed at the square where a profile picture should have been and instead there was what looked like a flying tropical banana tree monster.
Harry winced with guilt. It was in Hermione’s handwriting but he could tell where Ron had insisted she put certain parts in. They were trying to be a united front here for Harry, though, and Harry had to meet that front head-on if he ever wanted his family to understand what he was doing with his life.
“It wasn’t a phase, Moony. I am still a pirate.”
“I’ll need a cart,” Harry said with confidence upon hearing all the variety of set dressings he could purchase. The clerk looked delighted.
Draco reached across the table to squeeze Harry’s hand. “Think of it as a sign of affection.”
“Of course I’m ready. At this point, I should have a bloody degree in breaking distressing news to Malfoys,” Harry grinned. After all, he had married into this and didn’t intend on divorcing out of it. ‘Forever’ meant a lot to him. “Are you ready?”
“That
Harry was excited by the prospect of a library in the house where he lived. “Their fiction is ten times more creative than anything wizarding, I swear,” Harry said, feeling quite victorious that one of the most ancient families of wizardingkind was about to have a muggle section in their esteemed library. “They come up with the strangest things. Have you ever read Lord of the Rings?”
Draco smacked his arm.
“What?”
“It is… so good to see you again,” spoke up Narcissa before Lucius could get in with anything else. “Harry Potter.”
“Just barely,” Draco huffed. It was insane of Harry to even get the poor girl’s hopes up.
Soon enough they were both coated, washing their hands off under the water to rid them of the excess.
“I have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about,” Draco defended with a smile. “Rule Two: This room is your Safe Space. If you wish to be unbothered here then it shall be so for as long as you wish it. You can ban me from it if you wish.”
“Come right up.”
“Oh my god. Are you seriously telling me the Malfoys have a family doctor like you’re some group of royals?”
“Draco! That’s absolutely disgusting!”
“No, I mean,” he tried. “It’s just a bit strange, you know?”
Before Harry could ask what being the ‘Ben’ in a relationship meant, Draco gave him a sloppy line of kisses on the jaw. “Non-sexual bed,” Draco clarified. “I am being tucked in!”
Blaise Zabini as Draco’s right-hand man took the liberty to laugh at the conversation he was overhearing.
“You cook?” Harry asked, smiling at the thought of Draco tending to him on his couch with a pot on the oven. It would sure be a sight, his old rival blowing on his soup spoon and taking his temperature. Whenever he got sick now he just isolated further to chug his potions.
“What?” Harry asked, amused by this slightly-sillier Draco. Draco drank with Harry over food most nights but Harry had never seen him this properly foxed. He began to unbutton Draco’s shirt for him because he clearly wouldn’t be able to himself.
It was really in a bathroom stall during one of the few times they were allowed out of their cells in the cold, cramped darkness. The tattoo artist was a man who only spoke Russian and Sirius was feeling adventurous that day, handing his skin over to someone who could mark it permanently with a surprise picture. “I got this in the old Azkaban yard after I strangled a guard.”
“Supervisor,” Maggie suggested. After all, someone needed to watch Draco.
More than willing to feed into Draco’s narcissism, Harry slid his hands up Draco’s shirt to paw at his sides. “Take everything off, then. I need to see what I’m complimenting.”
“Looks like the plants have taken over.” Ron moved a thorny vine out of their way before heading in. The garden reminded Harry of the third challenge in the tri-wizard tournament, only less-trimmed. “Wouldn’t be surprised if something tried to eat us.”
“Harry…”
While sometimes the show portrayed Draco and Harry as one-dimensional, at least Ruth’s air-time did her justice. Her kindness showed through, and her story was never framed in a way that would mock her. Harry breathed a sigh of relief for her sake. She was the one who had taken the real risk in revealing her love-life on television.
“Uh, that’d be a no,” Harry laughed his nerves away.
Harry put an experimental foot in the water and sighed aloud at how perfectly warm it was. He stepped in, Draco following him, and sank all the way down to below his nose in the water, enjoying the heat wrapped around him like a blanket and the scents of lavender and rose wafting up his nose.
, Macnair thought.
“If any of you need anything, ask a Prefect to help you find my office. I will be just down the hall,” Draco swore as he stood, adjusting his robes. “Goodnight, everyone.”
Draco laughed and wordlessly summoned the bottle of lubricant from their bookshelf, behind a copy of some muggle book Remus and Sirius had given them for one Christmas or another.
Harry burst into the parlor to slot right into Draco’s arms, fitting perfectly between them. “Draco,” Harry said, happily burying his face in his neck.
Grace was flabbergasted, and her usually loquacious nature receded. “Uh. My aunt and uncle sort of kicked me out.”
From the changing table, Hermione shot him a smile. When he disappeared to make her meal the smile didn’t even fade. Ron was a shit liar, and it was flattering to be considered preferable to decoding a madman’s thoughts from the eighties.
“Doesn’t prove that Chris is Chris,” Draco shrugged.
“I don’t know. Maybe we’re being too quick to judge her.”
“Has your father disowned you?”
The site was basically a joke shared by the internet excepting the few that actually wanted to stick sharp, bumpy, pointy tentacles and deformed pricks made of silicone up their naughty bits, and Harry was glad he’d found someone who found the damn thing as funny as he did.
Draco smirked. “Sounds perfect. You sure your department won’t fall apart without the Head Auror?”
“Oh, but think of the possibilities,” the old leather hat marveled. “In Slytherin you may find a path to greatness as your sister and your father did. Or, you may take the route of your other father and your elder brother. Heritage does matter in these decisions, but…”
The talk had lasted long into the night, the plan of what Harry and Draco were going to do moving forward. Before Harry even realized it the clock on the wall read midnight.
“Father!” Draco’s face turned red this time. “How did you—? Oh, please don’t tell me you’re getting updates on everything I buy with the platinum card. I can use it how I want!”
From down the hall, Harry had to adjust to a house where they had to actually shout to hear each other rather than the echo of a flat. “I think it’s with the linens!”
“We should let them in, then.” Draco paused. “Harry, I don’t do well with animals—“
xxxxXXXXxxxx
“Looking forward to it,” Harry said on the subject of training, sitting up straighter on his stool as he forked down the eggs and bacon. “If I’m good, may I sleep in your bed tonight?” Harry batted his eyelashes, laying it on pretty thick.
Blaise fell to the bathroom floor before he even knew what was going on. “What the fuck?”
That dream lasted all of five seconds. “And we can smoke it while Olivia’s being harassed by some customer at the grocery store she’s apparently going to be working at.”
“It is.”
A small smile formed on Draco’s face. Ron Weasley had, historically, always had Harry’s back and now through the transitive property of their relationship it seemed he had Weasley the King serving him drinks in his family home, too.
Adorning the inside of the door was a contraption that looked like it could hold a hundred shoes. Ring holders, necklace holders, bracelet holders and more covered the porcelain space beneath the hangers, and there was even a rack for earrings. Olivia only owned one pair of earrings.
Ron scooted closer on the couch. “Hey, it’s okay. I just want to help. There’s a pub right down the street from here, you know. Maybe we could grab chips there sometime after you… er, shower.”
“I just, I don’t know, this whole process makes me feel so nervous. It’s stupid, since my parents are never actually going to be able to see any of this, but I keep thinking of what my father would do.” Draco turned to Harry, leaning into his touch. “But this isn’t my father’s house. Not anymore. It’s mine, and I have to decide the kind of legacy I want to leave.”
Draco had actually had to smack him to calm the poor man down. Pansy sort of wished he were there with her to do her the same favor.
A cold shiver ran up Harry’s spine, his toes curling in his heels. He’d had some, albeit more amateurish, spanking in his life from a man’s hand but never a toy on top of the bruises already forming from how damn hard Draco’s hand was.
Draco rummaged through the bookshelf they had put in the living area of the flat they shared, trying to pick an appropriate book.
“Worry not, love,” Draco assured him. “I’m going to change all of that.” He finished off his bacon and wiped his mouth with a monogrammed silk-blend napkin. “Are you okay with that? Me calling you ‘love’?”
“Don’t care,” Draco whined. “I won’t see some hack.”
“And we could be zookeepers.”
“Now, now, let’s not name-call. That’s not what I came here to do.”
“Nope. I think I want to spend more time working on classes. Do you know how hard it is to get a job without any skills? It’s like, ridiculous,” she told him seriously since it made her feel grown-up and mature. Her week-long search had been depressing as a twelve year-old who had no bills to pay or children to support.
“There he is. That’s my guy,” Draco beamed in return.
Colin smirked. “Or that.”
“Aerin likes to experiment with new flavor palettes. I think he’ll appreciate the compliment,” Harry encouraged. “It was kind of you to say.”
“I think,” Draco proclaimed. “That you’re amazing.”
“I know,” he sighed. “I get it, I get it. I’ll try not to do it again.”
Draco kissed him again because how could he not when he said such sweet, genuine things? Using his title melted Draco’s heart and stirred something in his gut but he ignored it as best he could. He put his hand on Harry’s cheek. “Daddy will be back before you know it. Then we can do whatever you want after our dinner, just us two.”
The three of them had survived the flight and a night’s stay at a questionable hotel on the Jersey Shore only to find themselves restlessly waiting on the strip of beach that Emmett had told them to meet at.
Without so much as a goodbye from the older girl, all they saw was a flash of blonde hair darting off towards the Great Hall.
“Thanks,” Harry responded quietly, letting his arms rest above the blankets so Draco could hand him the milk and cookies.
A few minutes went by, but it was more companionable than Draco expected. Harry’s character was still moving from zone to zone, so Draco had not reduced a guy he liked online to a wreck of emotions by bringing up something so painful.
“Hey!” Harry laughed, curling his leg around Draco’s even closer.
“Feeling close, are we, Harry? That’s too bad.” Draco withdrew his hand.
Oh, she could strike him right at that moment. “That’s what new cleaning spells are for. I could buy a book of them, I’m sure.” As a last resort, she could even ask Molly Weasley how all of that nonsense worked. That, and Harry and Draco could teach her a thing or two. They shared housework like a proper couple.
“Come on, you two!” Harry responded and threw his hands up. “It’s not school anymore! People can change, and he has changed. Haven’t we all changed? Look, when I rejected his friendship that first day at the robes shop it was because he reminded me of Dudley. Now Draco’s my—“ Harry stopped himself. “My boyfriend, and he reminds me of the kind of bloke I always used to dream about being with.”
That got a laugh out of Ron, shaking his head as he walked into Harry’s bedroom. Well, here was where all the debris had gone. Harry had apparently all shoved it in here trying to make the main living space look clean. Did he have someone over?
Gently, they rocked their hips in sync. It was to a beat only they could hear, and as always, Draco was an excellent musician.
“Everything about you is gay.”
Harry’s face heated up when he remembered Neville Longbottom was the third wheel in this exchange. “Uhm, so did I. It’s complicated. Not now, alright?” he directed at Neville quietly before turning back to Draco. “I’ll see you around? I kind of want to talk to you later.”
Draco stowed himself away in his room where even Theo was reluctant to go when he’d come home in such a strange mood. Draco was always in some mood or another, but this sort seemed dangerous to interfere with for fear of suffering the wrath of the dragon boy. Video games gave him a sort of heightened sense of self, especially in terms of how he used his anger.
“Well,” Colin continued without noticing the look of realization on Theo’s face. “Dennis and I went over to his house for a late father’s day get-together because Dennis has a real job and stuff. He told us that him and Helen, that they’re—um, seeing each other? Oh, fuck, I am never going to get the mental image of them shagging out of my head.”
“Yeah,” he grinned at Draco. “You were a snotty kid, then you entered a cocoon and burst out of it a compassionate and caring individual. Some might even say ‘charming’.”
“Did you see his
Harry made a face.
The Auror looked at Harry with wide eyes. There was something so raw, so feral about this man, like the magic in him was pouring forth from his mouth, his eyes, his nostrils in horrible, angry puffs.
Dean ran a hand through his hair like some greaser in a fifties movie. “I dunno, babe. I’ve been in pretty bad trouble with the law, they may lock me up for a long time,” he joked with a big, cheesy grin.
“Something about it doesn’t really flow, is all.”
“Is it wizarding?”
Harry frowned. “Hey, should I be calling a doctor?”
“Hey, no ‘now’ bullshit,” Sirius told him lovingly, petting his hair like Harry was the dog in the room. “How the hell old am I? Actually, don’t answer that. It’s fucking depressing. What I am trying to say is that I break curses sometimes, other times I garden, other times I cause public distress. I do things that I like, and I don’t worry about finding your nuclear family career crap. People are always defining themselves with jobs and you’re so much better than that, Harry. You’re better than them.”
Augustus Pye made Draco’s stomach churn along with the metal trap they had been corner into. He hated cars, especially ones with drivers who smelt like they hadn’t showered in weeks. “I think I may throw up.” The city whizzed around them, muggles and concrete buildings flying past Draco’s eyes.
“I know that, Harry.”
“Watch yourself,” Draco warned. “Backing him into psychological corners is my territory.”
“I can’t hear it,” Harry frowned.
The frown Harry had on since the mention of Lucius and Narcissa deepened. The last thing he wanted was to pressure Draco into telling them, or worse, have Ron and Hermione pressure Draco into telling them. “It’s alright,” Harry said quickly. “That’s why we want to keep it out of the papers, of course. To give Draco time."
Draco made a horrified but amused face as he approached with the cold metal dial. “Please don’t actually do that.”
And just like that, Harry’s thoughts were back on Draco.
Once all the cameras were turned off after that, Draco was free to grumble, “And what a hotel it is…”
“Yes, mine,” nodded Harry. “You’re the skeptic and I’m the believer, and this time believing is going to win out.”
The ginger’s eyes went so wide his freckles stretched.
“In the place one of your best friends was tortured while we were held in the basement? What, does the new paint of coat cancel out the worst memory of my
“It’s okay, Harry. It’s me, I’m here and it was but a dream,” Draco whispered, clutching the shaking man with all his might. “It’s okay, everything is going to be okay. Daddy’s here, I’m here.”
So Harry took him. He pushed himself in and found nirvana in Draco Malfoy’s arsehole. Stranger things had happened to him, after all. The world had magic and wizards who went to work in toilets, Harry had died and come back to life, and now he was making love to the most beautiful man he’d ever seen in his life.
Then she dated some stupid boys, some gay boys, and some ridiculous boys, and then a war happened. Ginny had the distinct feeling that normal people did not endure that, and probably only dated one or two bad matches in their life and only thought of war as an idea in textbooks and philosophical discussions.
“I,” Draco declared. “Have no idea what you’re talking about, Harry.”
“I could say the same of you,” Harry replied, shifting his weight between his shoes. They gave him some room to move around in, thankfully. “I will, I mean. Say the same of you. You look great.”
It wasn’t truly meant to be, though. Harry had to accept that, and so did Ron. Harry had failed all psychological evaluations, and every consecutive therapist he saw only made him feel like more of a freakshow so he’d stopped going altogether, stopped trying to get into an organization that clearly thought him insane.
Oh, this man had found Draco’s weakness. Scathing, awful sarcasm.
To top it all off was a fluff of whipped cream and pumpkin spices swirled around the brim of the cup.
“Not for me, obviously! For you, Harry. There’s one just a few blocks away called the ‘Velvet Lounge’ that serves wizards and muggles. Drinks, music, blokes—I think they even have drag shows,” Ron offered. It was hard to gauge what kind of nightlife activities might interest Harry when nothing seemed to interest him anymore, so he was throwing out as many ideas as he could.
“—and
“—What position do you Remus and Sirius do it in the most?”
Lorraine shrugged. “He’s never had the time or the computer skills. It’s actually sort of cute how terrible he is with technology. He’s always making autocorrect errors.”
“It’s the least you could do,” he nodded, keeping his teasing grin planted on his face.
This is gonna be an emotional one, friends! TW for talk about suicidal ideation and even more of Harry’s trichotillomania. Keep reading to the end and you and the boys get a nice reward for their suffering, I promise.
He let his mouth open, allowing Draco to swirl his tongue past his teeth.
“You dog,” Pansy giggled, voice in that gossipy tone she took on whenever scandal entered Pansy’s line of vision. “Who with?”
“But you should probably be worried if I’m not here by morning.”
With a nod, Theo sat up and waited for his breakfast. It was a refreshing change to watch someone else brewing a treat.
“No, no, she’s just messing with us. Open up, we shouldn’t be standing in the street so long,” Draco said, looking over his shoulder.
“Who even are you? Are you a friend of hers?”
“Mm?” Theo asked with closed eyes. Blindly, he reached out to grasp onto Colin.
“Yes.”
“Yes,” Draco growled. “Yes you will.”
That was true. Very, very true. “We are not teenagers anymore, Padfoot,” Remus pointed out. “Where do middle-aged men even acquire weed?”
The second wave came with Draco came inside him so that his come dripped out of the stretched-open hole. “Harry,” Draco shuddered.
Harry nodded.
His reception was far from warm, but it wasn’t outwardly hostile. The children stared at him with a fear of the unknown, and a fear of what they knew about his family.
“You suppose?” Harry laughed as he settled back into the mattress, tilting his head to the side so he could get a better view of Draco dragging his tongue down his chest.
Harry placed the half-unwrapped glass on the table and looked to his husband. “Draco, you’re the only one in the world for me,” he said dramatically, mocking the request. “You make my heart gushy and my cock hard.”
To be that rich was terrifying to him. Sure, Remus had grown up lower middle class so he was never destitute, but this was extravagance that felt horribly wrong. How could someone not go into their pantry for seven years? How could they really believe themselves entitled to a small, helpless creature that would go into their pantry instead?
That is so foul!"
The grand staircase was a marvel all in itself. The metal railings that spiraled around it was so thin but expertly-carved to look like blossoming flowers in chains. This level of pomp reminded Harry of Hogwarts but these stairs weren’t trying to kill him or change destinations so he was late for Potions again.
“Harry and I have decided on a name based on that,” Draco nodded.
“That’s hardly true,” Draco pushed back gently. “I am glad I can help, but I would argue it’s your own strength you owe it to. I like to bring out the best in you because I know you’re capable of the best, but you owe me nothing.”
“We found it,” Harry assured him. Under the ash and rubble of the Gaunt house, they’d found it.
“Because Gryffindor or not, you cannot expect that boy to ever go public with you,” Lucius insisted. “To announce a wedding with you.”
“We go as each other’s exes,” admitted the man. Upon closer inspection both members of the couple were dressed in all-white laces and spandex, custom pieces by the look of them. “I am sorry, we did not know…”
“Well, you know,” Harry fumbled. “Some gay people like their privacy. Not everyone’s as accepting as we’d want them to be, homophobes all over the globe. Not to mention that I’m me, and mentioning that kills any chance I have of getting to know someone without them seeing me first as ‘The Chosen One’.”
Draco was so furious he didn’t notice the stares of others that were doubtlessly on him in St Mungo’s halls. He was of one mind—
“There’s something I should say before we watch this.” Draco’s voice was deadly serious. “I’ve been Catfishing you the entire time. I’m a sixty year-old man from Michigan who just needed to feel young again.”
A week had to be long enough to lie low, hadn’t it?
Harry squeezed Draco’s hand to remind Draco it was all more than forgiven. “Mmm, I can smell something cooking,” Harry’s nose perked up. “Something oily.” It was getting to be around lunchtime and the stew they were collecting ingredients for was for dinnertime, so maybe they could grab something here? Just as Harry looked over to ask about it he saw a knowing smile on Draco’s face.
“I know,” Maggie gushed facetiously, putting on an expert poker face.
“Harry,” Draco tried through his groan. It was his turn to look at Harry like he was some new god, some gift from an unknown force that made his cock leak inside of him.
“Just today?”
“There you are!” Draco called out from down the row of bushes.
“I mean, who do you even talk to about sex?” Draco asked as Harry approached with their meals and parmesan for the shredding. Draco stood to follow Harry hungrily towards the dining room. “Ah, this looks delicious, thank you.”
“But they didn’t—“
“Good. I’d like that,” Harry nodded.
“I know!”
It was creepy, it was a red flag, and it really should have bothered Harry more than it actually did.
That was where Draco had to step in on the madness and remind everyone that they were playing a game. He refused to fight the evil constructs of the first titans that roamed Azeroth with homophobes.
“Mhm.”
“I’ve been out for about a decade so yeah, I’d sure hope so,” Draco retorted.
“Agreeable indeed,” Draco nodded as he conjured forth the rules he’d been working on for years. “Rule One: If we are to enter into this arrangement it would become a main, monogamous focus. I take this seriously.”
“Hermione?” he called out, lingering in the door frame.
“Yes, moving on, we’ll go to Grimmauld Place this weekend and hopefully this will be done before we even know it,” Ron nodded, eager for a change of subject.
“Abomination!” screeched a woman in plaid, holding up a sign that read ‘Get out of our neighborhud!’ so that Draco could at least take solace in her misspelling.
Now was not the time for pain, though. Harry could take quite the thrashing of his most sensitive parts like a true trooper, a trait Draco deeply admired, but that wasn’t what he needed from Daddy at the moment.
That talk would have to come later, though. It seemed Monica was being tended to by a group of Slytherin girls at the end of the table, offered napkins for her tears as they sat her down. Teddy, Monica, Angela, and Brynn. The future of House Slytherin.
Draco pushed in a third finger.
“The last thing we need is you sneezing on Christmas,” Harry teased. He liked to team up with Draco’s parents to bug him. Harry just really loved bugging his husband in every way that he could.
“I dunno, are you too drunk for this?” Harry teased, getting rid of his trousers and snuggling up against Draco so their bodies were fully pressed together.
“Daddy,” said Harry, voice thin.
“Okay, now I really know you’ve gone off the deep end,” Tiffany laughed before flipping to a page on the summer’s hottest make-up tips.
This is for Mallika, who lets me bitch to her on New Year’s Eve and beg for advice. For her, I have a little surprise in this fic. Happy new year to everyone, too! May 2014 bring you lots of gay magic and queer representation in every form.
It was then that Harry realized something sort of wonderful. Hermione, Ron, and Harry would be raising children together. Their kids would go to Hogwarts together, and maybe even room together. They’d spend holidays together, and Halloweens, and birthdays, and everything. “I can’t wait.”
After what Harry and Draco couldn’t believe they’d actually done in their future child’s nursery—the sin! The mess! The sexual shenanigans!—they dressed themselves and left. Apparently, Draco needed a thorough shagging before and after anything that provoked even mild anxiety.
“No need,” Harry stopped him, covering Draco’s hand with his own. “We’ve got them now. Just… one thing.”
“If she doesn’t come downstairs in less than a minute, my father will come up here.”
Harry figured it was his turn to contact Draco first when he saw his name pop up on his social list online.
“Can you really blame us for missing you?” asked Greg.
“Oh, Lily! Come out, come out wherever you are!” Harry shouted as he and Draco went in hot pursuit of their little girl.
“Isn’t he?” Molly cooed, clearly restraining herself from grabbing the little baby up and kissing him all over once again. “Oh, gosh. Look at him and his sister.” Tears sprung to her eyes and Arthur took her in for another hug so she could happy-cry on his shoulder.
“That’s brilliant,” Draco said as if he hadn’t been the ones to meticulously lay the plans out for him to see. “Let me know if you need extra supplies or support.”
A tense second passed by. Harry had put speaker phone on so the camera could pick up audio, and the two men in the room heard every ring perfectly.
He’d really have to borrow some clothes if Draco somehow (Harry was doubtful that this was even possible) proved himself to be a decent man, maybe even a favorable coworker.
“Gays are so lucky,” Ron sighed. “You don’t have to worry about recovery from pregnancy. You don’t even have to worry about pregnancy. You and Draco could just shag all day, all night, every second…”
“This is the hallway,” Draco said carefully, slowly. His voice echoed off the empty walls. “Where we will leave to go to work tomorrow.”
Fuck. Not just handsome, or attractive, but
“You’re such an arse,” Draco huffed. He let a chocolate drop melt in his mouth before deciding to speak again. Draco really was lucky to have a friend who was alright with waiting.
“I just, uh, wanted to make sure. I don’t think it’s a choice! It’s totally not! I support, like, gay rights and stuff, you know? My wife, Theresa, she has these two lesbian friends from work. Their wedding was really nice, and that should be legalized everywhere, you know? It’s only right—“
Pansy released Harry and turned to Draco. “You’re welcome.”
The words washed over Draco like the comfort he didn’t know he needed. It was like feeling Harry’s magic without casting a spell.
Molly wrung her hands in front of her, trying to think of a way to phrase this. “Well, young women undergo lots of changes at her age. Hormones rage, hair begins to grow…”
“Exactly. Your opinion isn’t always called for; especially when you’re such a brat.”
“You’re beautiful,” Kennedy reinforced.
Charmed blueberry incident—that was a new one. The novelty forced Draco to be the one that wrote up the report, as Head Healer Pye would drive a lice-comb through the paperwork when he got wind of a file heading to the Records. New cases were always sent there upon first encountering them, and Pye was always intercepting them to make sure things were ‘up to par’ before they got there. Draco had stayed an extra hour filling out nonsense for this alone, and then the shower robbed him of more time.
“Thank you. Can we edit it when we’re done speaking?” Harry asked.
Harry could have just written that he wanted a general caretaker, but he didn’t. Familial love was one thing, and he had it, and had nothing to do with. It was separate for him, this concept of being a Daddy. It was something he’d heard young, in the muggle schools whispered on the streets about the single mothers around the area, about teachers and waitresses. ‘Kelly’s gotten posh ‘cause she went and got a Daddy!’. Petunia loved to gossip loudly with Harry in his assigned cupboard.  At the time it was both the money that Harry focused on and one key factor: escape. It was forbidden slang, a forbidden thing for a boy to want.
Harry watched his husband collapse onto the plush green carpet they’d installed with a content sigh. “Happy?” Harry asked, amused by Draco’s antics.
“Can’t catch me! Can’t catch me!”
“There’s nothing actually wrong with me,” Harry dismissed. “It’s all in my head.”
Oh, Draco hated when Harry was right, but sometimes it just felt divine to watch someone he disliked suffer.
“And mine. And believe me, I will be seeing if his views are as changed as you say they are,” finished Hermione.
“Alright, kids, listen to your Healer,” Remus sighed and ruffled the hair of those ones who had hair. He turned to the old man as if they were sharing a secret. “I’m a teacher, don’t worry. I understand kids. My husband and I are also in the process of adopting, aren’t we love?”
“I’ll show you a hernia,” Lucius grumbled without any intention of following through on that threat.
Every year he’d wrap Harry’s presents in festive ribbons, adorn them with golden trim, and put Harry on his lap when it came time to open them. Sure, there were some sleazy jokes about whether he’d been ‘naughty’ or ‘nice’, but for the most part Draco just kissed his face and held Harry tight.
For those of you who do play (this will not appear in English to people who don’t play), this is taking place in (I will be updating in real-time with the game, so you may see some of my own opinions on it in here haha) in Mists of Pandaria. I’m changing the fact that cross-faction characters cannot talk to one another so our boys can communicate. Also, I’m changing party systems so that for neutral content (LK, Deathwing, Mogushan Vaults) the Horde and Alliance toons can team up and they can trade. Also I made Proudmoore a pvp server, oops.
Harry paused to bite his lip. It felt strange being so formal with the two people who’d risked life and limb for him on at least once an occasion per year at Hogwarts.
“I do,” Harry admitted. He felt cute, and stockings were like a whole new world to him. “I think I’ll wear this more often, seeing what it does to you, too.”
“Hospital nonsense. Interns, pleasing Pye, diagnosing cases,” Draco dismissed. “Something much more exciting than that is being in bed with a gorgeous, naked bloke.”
“Okay, I know, I know it’s really fast, but—“
Harry never knew what it was like with Ron or Hermione to be single and out with them on the look for a one-night stand. He never would know, either, because Ron and Hermione’s relationship just kept getting stronger with time. Sometimes he went drinking with Neville, but he could never envision them trying to hook up with some fraternal twins. “Wow.”
As her friend nodded and added a final topping of eyeliner on in the mirror, she was prepared to leave her bedroom in a whirlwind.
“But now that he’s back at work,” Ron said. “What do you plan on doing? Does he just expect you to stay in the house all day? In that house, especially?”
Draco thrust into him and Harry saw stars. A cocksleeve, yes, just a toy for Draco to use—the word alone had made Harry’s dick begin to weep between them. “I won’t come,” Harry told him, words punctuated by the slap of their skin. “Not until Daddy says, I promise.”
“Pretty much,” Grace sighed.
Harry, curled around his Daddy, thought back to Hogwarts’ motto. Draco dormiens nunquam titillandus—never tickle a sleeping dragon.
“Lots! They need to have things that stimulate their cognitive abilities and make them feel calm enough and tired enough to not to cry all night and wake us up. The goal,” Draco said, activating the scanner gun so he could swipe over a bright ordnance walker with charmed dancing zebras on it. “Is to keep them as spoiled as possible.”
That didn’t really seem to help, either.
Harry opened his fridge to reveal quite the sad display. He was hardly wanting for coin or muggle money, but it was getting out of the house that was the problem. The remnants of his last trip a week ago included ice cream, leftover spaghetti, a whole lot of carrots for some reason, and one last frozen pizza from what had once been a mighty stack. He opted for the pizza.
Harry scrolled down. “Yup. Let’s see if she’s at her computer.” Harry pulled up Skype, as glitchy as the program was they had paid for a sponsorship on the show, and entered her number. Harry was logged onto the verified MTV Catfish account so it wouldn’t seem as if some random creep was calling Ruth.
"Oh, Harry. Sweet, simple Harry,” Pansy sighed fondly and Harry wasn’t sure if he liked the sound of it. “Anything you bloody well want. If you could have one thing in the entire world regardless of cost right now: what would it be?”
“What is ze phrase? Safe, sane, consensual…?” Fleur teased from the brim of her own drink.
For the fortieth time, Draco closed and reopened the Google Chrome window on his laptop. It was the Apple Store home, and it was really a pity that Harry still had the iPhone 3 when the 5
“I’m sure he’d appreciate you calling him that.”
“Oh!” Harry gasped, arms shaking. Draco tweaked Harry’s nipples quite mercilessly, sending jolts straight down to his cock. “Yes, yes Daddy,” Harry repeated in a low, breathy tone to feel Draco’s nail gently run down the sensitive skin.
Harry huffed and crossed his legs on the couch. “Because. I want Ginny to be happy.”
“That’s right, that’s right, darling,” Draco breathed, all the stress of the day melting away when he was working Harry’s hips with his.
Harry would need an actual apology to get this going.
“You’re creative; you’ll think of something.”
The sun was an invariably good thing with Draco around, even if he whined about how he burned, because the sun truly made Draco shine.
Draco honestly wished he could send images back in time because if he’d been able to see this—this promise of Harry Potter, simpering and whimpering for an orgasm with his pretty pink nipples all bound—this alone could have gotten him through a war.
“Oh, none really. As of now I’m still single,” she admitted.
Draco nodded. “Exactly. That’s why we throw a fake one, and stake it out. We would have to make it look convincing, of course, and there is another problem…”
“I noticed,” Draco nodded before doing something mildly evil yet entirely premieditated. He snatched Harry’s glasses right off of his face and inspected them as if they were fascinating. “What’s the strength on these things? They look pretty thick.”
“Before we start can you please just try this?” Harry asked of her, the calm breaking slightly. “Let’s just eat together, okay?”
didn’t make fun of you for being queer, but I made fun of you for other things while
Draco laughed darkly. “You think I’m done already? That’s adorable. You’re also wearing panties to work tomorrow, coming home and letting me spank you, reading me a passage from the book I’m reading right now, and… Hm. What else should I have you do?”
So Harry gave him another, this time a long and lingering one full with a soft hum from Draco.
Merlin, Olivia loved that. ‘Just a feeling’. How cool was that? “Then what breed is the one that looks like a cat?”
Dazed, Draco let his elbows fall out from under him, fully laying back as he panted and shivered in the glorious aftershocks. “Harry,” Draco said again just to say his name. “Come here, get back up here,” he urged.
“There was a note with the leg, too,” Kingsley went on. “Another riddle. Remus solved that one—it was some sort of anagram—and it led us to a leg and a more complex note. A few weeks later, Voldemort was gone, Sirius was in jail, and Remus didn’t quite feel like solving any more riddles.”
Their tongues swirled together, with Draco’s plunging into Harry’s mouth so he could run his tongue along the back of his teeth.
“Good evening,” he greeted Hugo when he realized he was alone in the corridor. “Congratulations on breathing for the first time.”
“I wish I had been there, too,” Draco replied with a tenuous strength. He had been misty seeing Harry so upset. “Instead of being a damned fool. Can you settle for me being here now?”
“Have I inherited the sewer throne?” Colin laughed. What was this nutter up to?
“Wouldn’t it be rude to go home without saying goodbye?” Harry questioned, tempted as he was.
“I’m eager for
“Hermione,” he greeted her, trying his hardest to seem normal. Unfortunately, when Remus tried to be normal, it looked like the most abnormal thing on earth. “We got your letter.”
“Hey,” the voice said again. “You listening to me?”
Also I’m adding social chat on mobile devices that isn’t limited to guild members because yolo.
Everyone involved in shooting was given an advanced copy of all the episodes while the public would watch the first episode of the season that evening on television.
The man could request to see his son, but he could never change him.
“Even though Pansy offered up his immortal soul to the Dark Lord?” Theo teased her, earning a little slap to the shoulder.
“Uh.”
It was easier just to do things and apologize instead of asking for permission.
She raised an eyebrow, but figured she was in no position to deny him that. Grace—one hand on her stomach—rose from the chamomile sofa. It was probably predictable, but she loved the décor of Draco and Harry’s home sweet home. “Where are we going?” Grace asked.
“Oh. I didn’t know that was what it meant,” she stammered.
God bless us every one.
“I’ll ask our host first,” Pansy giggled. “Draco?”
“Caught him in bed with a go-go boy.” From the very club they’d met at, too.
If it weren’t for that, Kennedy strongly believed she would have never, ever ended up on reality television.
“Take off my pants, too, no half-measures tonight,” Draco commanded, voice firm and resolute.
“Harry tipped me off,” Draco admitted. “Might I also recommended the goat here—it’s quite juicy.”
Theo was laughing so hard he wiped away a fake tear. “Oh, this is so rich,” he got out between laughs. “Potter’s gay? With you? And you didn’t even know it was him until you met?”
“Yet you couldn’t tell the
Tension.
“Yup. You’ve got competition, Malfoy-Potter. I’ll give you a hint,” Colin decided, putting his left hand on the bar counter. It wasn’t specifically a gay bar or a straight bar, but the place still had some flashy neon lights around.
“Yes,” Harry answered. “We are.”
Ginny sipped her tea and offered forth all the information she had.
"No!" Harry replied loudly. "None of that!"
“I know what ‘magazine’ you’re referring to, Draco. I am your father, after all. Your hiding places were obvious to me when you were at Hogwarts.” Lucius thought back on their old home with pride for what it was before The Dark Lord came and ruined every corner and floorboard with his rot.
That was a problem for future Harry, though, because sleeping in such a regulated, restful fashion had changed his whole outlook. With meals to mark the morning, afternoon, and night, Harry was on a schedule again, like at Hogwarts but this time he was training in something darker than magic.
“Now, Ruth—“ Harry quickly looked to the teleprompter for the name. “’Toby’ here in the audience has a question for you.”
Then approached a boy with bright pink hair. Draco cast a quick look to Harry who nodded—this was him.
She grabbed Ron’s elbow and pulled him to the side. “This is what we liked to refer to when Lucius worked in the Ministry as a ‘Temporary Blackout’. You didn’t see anything, you didn’t hear anything. As far as you’re concerned the next five minutes didn’t exist,” she said sweetly in a mothering tone she’d mastered so well.
She had avoided icing a cake alone only to scream alone it seemed. Nobody was rushing over to see if a young and impressionable girl was being dragged into a white van. It was almost as if no one had heard her.
“Yes, thank you, excellent as always,” Draco nodded as well and signed the receipt with a massive tip, leaving it on the edge of the table for her to collect once they’d left. “Well, Harry, it seems we’re welcome as long as we like. Please, sit back, enjoy your tea.” These last few minutes of their allotted time would be uninterrupted by outside distractions.
“Some of it’s true! Did you know that Narcissa is rumored to have donated money to a charity for house elf rights? There’s enough secrets in that family that you might be able to slip by.”
Draco’s eyes were centered on Harry’s cock through his pants, outlined from how erect it was. It had grown considerably so Harry’s earlier comment about it not being at its full potential yet was accurate, it seemed. A grower, not a shower. How cute. “Stand up,” Draco spoke like a command.
That didn’t seem to matter to Alex, though. He was the first one to lie down and watch the clouds roll by after their game of tag had tired him out. It had really been more like Olivia tagging him and Alex giving up, but that was beside the point.
They were both close, and Harry knew it was never too early to start begging. “Daddy, can I please come?”
That worried both Hermione and Draco.
When Hermione owled her husband, her best friend, and her old professors she held in such high respect, she was expecting a small gathering of friends to support her in a medical mishap that had shaken her.
Harry’s smile went wider. “Yeah?”
“We’re going to have to eat on this counter, you know,” he laughed breathlessly. Not that he actually wanted to switch locations in the slightest, of course.
“There you go. White carpet it is.”
After checking to see the temperature was just right 79 degrees Celsius just as His Majesty had requested (never more, never less. Harry had once tested him and brewed the coffee at 80 degrees only to find Draco demanding a refund and berating him), Harry poured it out into a cup.
‘Liar,’ Draco mouthed.
“Then maybe I’ll show you how rewarding I can be,” Harry volleyed right back.
“I was last tested in January for my yearly physical, and everything came back negative,” Harry responded quickly.
“Oh,” Harry said, shocked. The figure in the door wasn’t his lycanthrope godfather in the slightest.
“Of course you did. You’re my Princess. How was life in the royal family?” Maggie crawled back onto her bed, slinging an arm around Pansy’s exposed waist. Her skin was impeccable from years of the most extreme spa treatments, and that was sort of inspiring.
Harry’s wand—when had he taken that out?—dug into Blaise’s neck. “I knew you didn’t deserve her. She—She’s better than you could even dream of! She’s patient and
“Is this,” Draco asked quietly. “Some kind of metaphor for—?”
“Okay, come on,” Remus finally said when he made his way over to Sirius in front of their fireplace, holding himself steady on Sirius’ shoulders. “We need to... We need to not be stupid right now.” That only made him laugh harder, though. “Okay? Not stupid.”
From her place in the doorway, Narcissa caught a look at her granddaughter’s feet. “Oh, Lily. You two have to stop letting her get so dirty,” she sighed, taking Lily from Harry’s arms so she could cast a cleaning spell that tickled her toes. Lily giggled and kicked in Narcissa’s arms.
“Oh, come on! Give us more!” Pansy requested. “I’ll get you another drink, how’s that sound?”
She rolled her eyes. “That’s hardly kinky. You don’t even know the half of it,” she said airily. It was just the right amount of mystery that she had been going for. “Have you ever even thought about other blokes?”
“What? I make one innocent joke and you’re already done with me?” she asked, disappointed. If Dolores were any younger, she would have tried a pout.
“I love you too,” Theo said quietly, turning to press his forehead to Colin’s. “I’m fine, okay? I know it sounds crazy, but I knew this would happen. I just… I knew I’d see him again after the trial. I’m not giving him the power to affect me, and I’m taking you out to dinner after this.”
A chill ran down Harry’s spine. “I, I…” He couldn’t, daren’t finish the sentence and turned Gryffindor red.
“You definitely like it,” Harry grinned, moving his other arm around Draco. “You love it.”
These strangers who approached him were not his parents, not anything to him, really, and he resented them so much he stayed inside to keep thoughts of the general wizarding public away.
“And I would think that you could handle a little physical contact,” Theo sighed before digging into his ribs. With barbeque around his mouth in a way that Colin found adorably classless for a pureblood, Theo amended his statement. “Nothing’s even happened yet. He had the decency to tell you, and you can see how it actually goes next time we’re all together. You may even wind up figuring out why your dad fancies her so much.”
“Thanks,” Harry said into Sirius’ shirt, relaxing considerably.
Dr. Hart smiled thinly. “Please, sit down.”
They reached the dining room in record time based on Draco’s nerves alone. “Maybe they thought we were coming later?” Harry tried. When Harry was upset it could be disastrous, but Draco being anxious was on an apocalyptic level.
“Then a DNA test won’t be necessary,” Draco sighed. The test would be invasive and dangerous to the baby, too. “Don’t worry, I’ll have my father come over with the lawyers tomorrow. We can work all of the legal documents out there. As the one carrying the child, you can feasibly go right over Zeke’s head once we prove him to be an unfit parent.” That wouldn’t be hard, considering he was sixteen.
he had narrated to the camera.
“Want to know something?” Sirius asked as he dug into the bowl of popcorn in between them.
Pansy’s metamorphosis into accepting muggleborns came from that purely scientific standpoint. Sure, she’d been against the idea of making flower chains with muggle populous of the world for most of her life, but she wasn’t doing anything of the sort. Apparently, acceptance didn’t mean going horribly out of your way to not be a dick.
“She was kidnapped, and the Manor was the headquarters of the Death Eaters.” There was no point in lying to her, so he let it flow out. “Peter Pettigrew tried to get information on Hogwarts security out of her.”
Thankfully, it worked. Draco slid down on him harder, practically bouncing up and down on his cock at a quickening pace. “Harry,” he groaned. The slap of their skin echoed in the office space.
“Then that opens up a new pool of suspects, doesn’t it?” Pansy pushed.
It was a dark, delightful waltz that was distinctly harlequin in origins.
Seeing Harry cry and speak so openly about this had tears pricking the corners of Draco’s eyes. “In my lowest moments,” Draco nodded to admit. “I know what conservatives and purists say about people like us. There’s a class of respectable, sexless gay some can stand but the ones like us, the freaks, we’re abhorrent to them.” Draco wiped away one of Harry’s tears. “But they’re wrong. They don’t know love like I know it when I’m with you, and it’s made me a better and stronger man.”
“Wow, a television in Malfoy Manor,” Ron tried to imagine. He knew the place looked different now but seeing any digital screen around even the amorphous new Manor in his mind seemed out of place.
Unfortunately they had to separate at some point, Draco sliding himself out of Harry and observing the white trail he’d left in him with a smug smile. “Now, what do you say we wash up? Your bathroom, or mine?”
Draco prided himself on expensive skin creams, luxurious clothes, and in general being a snob, but he was also kind of a slob. He left clothes scattered everywhere like some maid was going to pick them up and ate like a pig.
Draco cocked his head to the side.
“You,” Draco countered. “Are a hypocritical, stubborn, uncouth bonehead with no real idea what he’s talking about!”
Draco turned to say something to Ginny when Harry noticed something. The couple had come into the entrance foyer, but the door to the main building was still open. Someone was holding it open. Draco started saying something but Harry couldn’t hear it. There was something about that white hand holding open the door.
“Look, I can just make the beds myself if that’s what you’re worried about,” Harry cut in. He probably wouldn’t even mind sleeping on a bare mattress he was so wiped. “I’m not going to write a bad Yelp review or anything.”
Harry nodded—that had been a point of pride for him, some actual social change. “They don’t sell them at joke shops anymore, either.” Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes had thrown a party where they destroyed all the bottles in their stock. “So I suppose we were the last class of Hogwarts students to learn it.”
“Granddaughter. Now
“One more,” Draco allowed, getting a creeping feeling that this was going to be a long night of dodging questions.
Thus, Gerda was brought under the roof of Malfoy Manor. She was born a few days after Dobby’s death, so when the Manor was returned to Lucius’ custody after an extensive Ministry investigation Gerda was ripe for the picking.
“So you’ve been here before?” Hermione questioned.
Draco was frustrated enough to cry, so he didn’t say anything lest the floodgates open. He was staring at his father with a slight tremble in his lower lip. It didn’t escape Harry’s notice.
They sat like that for a while–in quiet disgust with one another but making no move to separate–before getting up to see the reply text from Aubrey.
There was always a paranoid part of Draco that imagined Pye to be plotting against him and it seemed that imagination was reality, now. It always had been, as Pye had just said.
“Then let’s look at his Facebook. Hm.”
"Fuck, did he kill your pet dog or burn down your house or something?" Alvaro climbed in intensity. He needed to know what was keeping this couple apart when they were so clearly great for one another.
The tight, hot muscles constricting around him made Harry see stars. He moaned out Draco’s name as he thrust up into him without holding back, knowing just how Draco liked it.
Harry sipped his drink. “Front page?”
“How did you…?” Draco asked, looking at the magic scanner feeling a mixture of disturbed and distressed.
As Harry and Draco walked back to the car with their pack of cameras, one camerawoman got a shot of Kennedy and Brooke’s first kiss.
“Daddy!” Harry cried out as his last coherent word, fading to aftershocks and low groans from the release still rocking his body.
“Not a blessed clue. Why?”
“Was my mum the only sensible person around?”
A hush fell over the hall. Then came the murmurs of students.
Harry spied the glass panes when the light from the simulated sun reflected off of them. In crates and on top of lumber bundles sat a blueprint of a wood and glass greenhouse.
In the end Harry went with an inoffensive white shirt and started his way down the stairs. From what he was smelling—and mm, so savory—Draco was cooking breakfast for two again. Perking up, Harry rushed the rest of the way to the kitchen. “Draco?” he called out.
“I bet you like my hand better than yours,” Draco agreed, loosening his grip and coming down to trace Harry’s ballsack. Harry’s hair stood on end, whole body clenching to have such a sensitive place touched so lightly. “How often do you masturbate, Harry?”
“But there are things that women go through in puberty that the all-boys-club of the Marauders probably didn’t go through. Well, James probably watched it carefully, but—“
“And you,” Harry responded after a long moment of continued distrust. He’d had all of Sunday to sit around the Dursley’s and think of how he’d treated Draco unfairly. “You had points. You have points. And you’re not—You’re not the only one at fault.”
To keep both of their honor intact, Lucius bought the engagement ring later that day. The Black and Malfoy families were to be united (definitely not for the first time, but Narcissa didn’t really like to think of her one and only as a distant cousin), and both were over the moon in spite of the nervous and jittery couple.
“Are we finally all here?” Molly asked, trying to count the swarm of heads. Thank Merlin that Harry and Draco finally had this much space.
As Harry brandished his trusty wand his confidence was only growing. First things first, a spongy charm on the glass so he wouldn’t break any while moving it. Harry waved his wand wordlessly and the glass went floppy. The wooden frame would come first, and that would require some measuring and cutting with his wand as well.
Draco’s eyes widened. He couldn’t pick a word for what he was feeling because there was no word for it, not a single existing one in the English dictionary.
“How early into two months?” Lucius asked.
“And you contacted him?” Ron asked in disbelief.
Kingsley seemed to be composing himself for some sort of speech.
“They do know. They have always known, in their way. I told them after the war that I wouldn’t be taking a wife and might hopefully someday take a husband, and they adjusted expectations. Mother dealt with it best, of course, but father got there with her help, too. Do your friends know?”
“I’m prepared to do an Unbreakable Vow just to be out of this suspense,” Blaise declared.
Harry’s previous pride on not being a gay man who was disturbed by the inner machinations of the cisgender female was dashed, however.
“That means you’re on in five,” a person dressed in head-to-toe black told Harry. He had no idea who these people were backstage, but they were the sort of mix of stern and focused that he did not want to mess with. The head manager was named Minny something—that was all he knew—and there they were working together on live television where everything could go wrong.
Olivia grabbed Alex’s wrist, which had gone ghost-pale like the rest of his body. Sirius had been hoping to make him cry a little, but he stopped just short of that. Alex was a nice kid, after all.
Draco smirked. “Watch it, Harry. She’s got your number. Do you still want to come out with us tonight for dinner?”
Just being in this old building had brought back so many memories as Draco moved into his tiny Professor’s Quarters in the dungeon. “Things would have been very different if that had happened,” Draco said, the memory of that day fresh to him now. It was hard not to sound bitter when he knew Potter had only avoided Slytherin because of him and his bratty behavior.
“Thank you,” Harry whispered.
Either way it was the last day of winter break, the last eve of freedom before school began. Harry figured he had to eat right.
None of that was Ginny’s fault, of course. Ginny was lovely. Ginny was fit. Ginny was kind, funny, smart, and had a cute little family. Ginny Weasley, in conclusion, had to be the perfect picture of a girlfriend. Blaise had been entranced by that at Draco and Harry’s stupid monogamous wedding.
Harry was hyperaware of the way his breath felt cold in his throat when Draco said that. “Shut up,” he replied weakly. He had no more ammunition; he was a dead man walking and Draco The Conqueror didn’t seem like the sort to go easy on captured enemy troops.
“You make it sound like we’re going to eat him,” Charlie laughed from his place beside his father in the kitchen. The open floor plan made what looked like an unassuming tower seem like a grander home from the inside. “Come on, Audrey, are we a hard family to be introduced to?” he asked his sister-in-law.
“Well, neither do you,” he snipped just to get his last word in. Zeke was always doing that in arguments, like it was a battle to win.
“Hm? Well, my shift is ending in a couple minutes but I could certainly find time to help you out in
Jordan grabbed her wand to scribble down the hotel name on a nearby piece of paper. She would have to find someone to cover her shift at the store. Merlin, when they heard about this, they wouldn’t even believe her! “Thank you,” she said, feeling like her life had been saved by some deus ex machina. Now she and Shaun wouldn’t have to quit their jobs for a baby, and maybe she could move out of her mum’s place! “I don’t even know how to thank you. This is wonderful.”
Harry pulled the cloak out of the box and Draco almost, almost got the opportunity to admire a genuine Deathly Hallow like the storybooks said before he was running back towards the fireplace. It was so gossamer, like woven water. He could marvel at this later.
Hermione was having a baby! The perfect mix of his two best friend’s genes! It was the baby who would grow up alongside his own.
She answered without thinking. “My home town.”
Harry started with his thumbs pressed deep into Draco’s right shoulder, immediately zeroing in on a knot that held a great deal of tension there. “Ah,” said Harry. “Here’s where you’ve been keeping your stress.” He began to rub the hard spot like Draco had done for his back in the past.
“As for the location of the party trap it needs to be somewhere neutral but still mostly closed to the public,” Harry went on.
Draco obliged as she typed in her username and password to some small local branch banking site.
The next minute was complete chaos. The lights and sirens became overwhelming to Harry, leaving him clutching his wand and his ears to try and drown out the noise. He tugged on his hair, mind still racing and unable to piece together what exactly was going on.
There was far more wrong with this group of players than just some messed up mechanics (a healer had run off the platform and fell to their death, the tank had terrible damage-per-second rates, and Draco was the only one dispelling anything), but Draco supposed that was also true. With each patch there were instructions on the fights, but people never read the instructions. Of course not.
He released his spirit from his corpse, effectively resurrecting himself after combat with less health and the power source for his spells (mana) than he’d had before dying. It’d take a few minutes to regenerate back to its full capacity.
As discussed before they arrived, Draco and Harry played dumb. “Nothing yet,” said Draco. “But we’re playing the long game.”
Draco watched Harry watch the Manor, wondering if it was too much to be back here. What had happened to Granger here especially was a horror Draco was sure Harry would rather forget. Their own ‘struggle’ for the wands that Draco gave up on purposefully happened here, too. Was Harry thinking of that, too?
“All of this to make the point,” Draco cut in. “That I need to go burn your copy of The Prophet. Right now. Do not look at it.”
“…Yes?”
“Do you think you could have both?” Harry asked wistfully.
Hermione was.”
Eric Sinclair and Aiden were attached at the hip ever since they met in first year. Born into a conservative family, Eric was a rebellious gay kid who never had a chance until he met his new friend from wizarding school’s parents. Draco and Harry had for all intents and purposes become his replacement parents.
“We’re only sure you’re alive because of Pansy’s updates from work,” Blaise agreed. “You never go MIA like this, even when you have a new boytoy, so this one must be something special. Go on, tell us about him!”
Harry gave his side a pinch. “Hey, not just any roly-poly. Our kid will be fantastic, just like their daddy.”
“Quit looking at me like a sap. I’m just saying that if I loved someone enough to marry them that a huge part of it would be dedication to, you know, seeing their face. That’s important,” Draco grumbled.
Draco shamelessly snogged Harry’s arsehole while stroking. Harry was in for it after this, but Draco was feeling indulgent towards him for this first one.
“Yeah? You like this?” Draco teased because of course he did, Harry looked like a man possessed with the way he twisted against the sheets in response to Draco. “You like having a man open you up while you’re dressed like this, covered in your own mess?”
“Then I will have to say it more often,” Draco decided after placing his toothbrush back in the holder. Next to it was Harry’s toothbrush, and Draco tried not to think of what a sod he was for thinking it to be intimate.
“No, there’s a reason I’m on the floor.”
Harry decided not to prolong his teasing. He opened his mouth wide, covering teeth with his lips and sliding them down over the head and down further over the spiraling veins.
“Not your fault,” Draco whispered in his ear as he smoothed his onyx hair. “Let’s go home.”
“Malfoy,” Kingsley grumbled. He stood behind him in the mirror. “Just let them do their jobs.”
Draco returned to his room and left the door open a crack just in case. Tonight they would sleep, and if Harry was still considering him, then he would still be here in the morning.
Wrote this when I heard Trump got COVID-19 in a fit of joy. Everyone else stay healthy, but sincerely, that man can rot.
“And three months, yes.”
Draco propped the seven books up around him, starting with year seven as their assignments would be the most challenging, some even for him. There would be no way he’d let them see him sweat, though. Draco’s abilities with a cauldron were tried and true, and he’d be preparing most samples before the class started.
His eyes narrowed. “And they say I’m the Slytherin,” Draco laughed. “You realize that they’ll swarm whoever goes there, right?”
“That’s the danger of Pansy’s efficient mixing,” Theo warned, already on his third mixed drink for the evening, nursing a bright pink cocktail. “It sneaks up on you. Helps having a Healer around.”
It reminded him of mortality and the inevitable day that the Earth would be consumed by its sun, destroying all evidence of Harry’s existence and the existence of everyone he loved. That was admittedly a lot to get from a formation of calcium and marrow, though.
“I’m perfectly content with my two pets,” Pansy preened, always happy to talk about herself. “And they are
After fishing it out of the trash, the elf passed the paper to his owner. She was disgusted by the bits of chopped up tomato that had fallen on some of the pages, but that was what happened to things that got tossed in the rubbish bin…
, the thought flashed across Potter’s mind,
“Mhm.”
Draco walked past the poison wing and towards the general patients section of the second floor. There were some patients from the past that could have asked for him by name, but how had they known to send the intern after him?
“Hm?” The other man was busy patting his face dry and the green tea scent of the mask wafted over to Harry.
“French toast,” she replied with an easy smile. Narcissa didn’t like chastising her husband in front of the help, but something felt wrong that morning.
It was still exciting to use spells, and now he had a reason to use them. Watching heavy wood lift with his wand effortlessly reminded Harry of his first Wingardium Leviosa lesson, filling him with warmth. He could do this.
“You look dashing,” Draco said and Harry knew what he meant:
“I wouldn’t expect anything less.”
“Hello, Draco,” Harry greeted him, now getting a better look at his face to confirm what he’d already known from the neck—this was his old rival. Age had done him well. He fit into that angular face a lot better now.
For a moment Draco could have heard a pin drop in the room. All of his friends were staring, mouths agape, faces twisted in confusion.
Sirius took it upon himself as the scarier one (scars were creepy, but tattoos were voluntary pain) to open the front door. “Alex,” he greeted sweetly. “Come in, she’ll be right down.”
“I didn’t sell the flat!” Harry defended. “I’ve got this place for life if anything goes wrong I just—I just wanted to be with him!”
“I know you love Cheetos,” Harry insisted. “Don’t lie to me.” He knew Draco’s apartment very well, too, and made himself at home by plopping down on Draco’s couch.
“No,” Draco snapped as his hips snapped forward. “Not yet, not yet, fuck, fuck—!”
Father was always pushing him to be more ambitious with his desire for promotions, but Draco didn’t exactly give his advice as much credence as he used to these days. To his credit Lucius had taken to post-war life well enough, banished to the France Estate of the Malfoy family while only Draco was permitted to set foot in the Manor again.
His eyes followed the little tiles in their swirling patterns to the end of the aisle, where the back of a very familiar head caught his eye.
“Yes! Fuckin’ killed him!” one of the girls shouted. “I’m the queen!”
Draco swept back Harry’s hair and leaned down for a kiss to his forehead just like the last time. Unlike then, though, Draco also kissed his nose and lips on the way down before rising and leaning in to whisper in his ear.
The covers shifted and Harry could see the faint outline of Draco’s hair as he turned to him. “You were crazy to begin with,” he informed him seriously.
Draco smiled. “That’s what I like to hear,” he said, giving the students a round of applause that they then joined in on, everyone pumped up and clapping. “This year is going to be a great one for you all. Classes start tomorrow morning, so don’t let anything distract you from the mission: we’re here to prove why we belong in such a great house.” The students clapped again and Draco waved his hands. “Dismissed. Goodnight, everyone.”
“Straight people,” Draco sighed.
Draco let out a bark of a laugh that was wholly unlike his usual façade. Harry couldn’t help but crack a smile. As much as that Slytherin Ice Prince tried to keep his cool, he really was anything but cold at his core. Loud, expressive, laughing Draco. Harry’s favorite kind of Draco.
“After a child, no less,” Hermione grumbled. The only good memory of that whole night had been being able to hold Rose after they had cleaned her up.
“Merlin’s sake, I can’t do this, it’s too foul,” whined the other.
“Shopping,” Draco said cheerfully. Weren’t teenagers were supposed to love that? “You need new maternity clothes before you bust the seams on your current ones.”
The tremors had begun as little tickles around the five month mark, but now it felt as if someone was flicking Grace from inside her. That quick but distinct twitch caught both Harry and Draco’s attention.
“Colin, it’s not because of that. I… I bought this damn thing two months ago and I have been a coward about just saying it.”
“You’re telling me,” Harry laughed in return, having wanted this for a while now. He’d just been too nervous to ask for it, not believing himself worthy of such a reward. “Are you feeling okay? Did it hurt too much?”
“I’m sure they’ll appreciate your calling them old,” Harry snarked.
“Not even in your dreams, Malfoy.”
This interview was getting tired. “That’s why I’ll talk to them first,” Grace said as she shifted her weight. “But, yeah. If two blokes can still fancy each other after a war enough to marry one another, I think that qualifies as a ‘loving parent’ characteristic.”
If Lucius could properly articulate his feelings then not only would most of his problems be solved, but he would say something along the lines of ‘I’m glad we’re family, you fucking freaks’. “Let’s just start with the cake,” was what came out instead.
“Yeah, well, maybe not for long,” Harry replied. “I mean, they don’t really have Dim Sum in Wiltshire, now do they? Perks of being magic I guess, I can Floo back here whenever I want.”
“And what about your voice on the phone?” Harry asked, keeping himself in between Randy and Lorraine protectively.
“Even in the face of paparazzi?” Draco asked, having held Harry back from punching a few photographers on Draco’s behalf. Something about Gryffindors and defending their chivalry, or honor, or whatever.
“Work,” Ron shrugged as he flipped through the menu. “Work and wedding stuff, mostly. We have most of it figured out but it’s like there’s always something new—new guests, new traditions my parents want to include.”
Maybe they could have romance and great sex all at once, but first they’d have chocolate.
“And you can’t fuck unless you see them.”
“But we have someone behind bars who does know,” Ron pointed out.
Lucius cocked an eyebrow. “But his financial plans? You can’t tell me that giving handouts to the poor is going to get us out of debt.”
“You owled them, right?”
When they returned to the couch with their meal—because they were grown adults who could eat whatever they wanted any time they wanted—Draco grabbed another file. “So,” he said, spooning the cold treat into his mouth. “What do you think of Camila Rosa?”
Draco’s whipped-cream-covered lips curved up. “I’ll try and get Maggie to cover for me.”
“Thank you, thank you, thank you!”
Draco’s head hurt. He could just see Harry looking down to him and talking with a honey-coated condescension to tell him that it was ‘better if they were just friends’.
a year.”
“What is going on?” bellowed Lucius from down the hall. “Narcissa?”
“The Invisibility Cloak? Yes,” Harry answered, picking it up and walking to Draco’s side.
“Yes! Of course! How could I have lied about anything else?” Brooke’s defense flared for a moment before she receded back into herself. “I didn’t lie about anything else.”
Most of the time when Harry woke up, he couldn’t even remember those questions. They weren’t important.
“Thank you.”
Harry grinned slowly. “Oh? Well, it’d have to be of all the places I didn’t get to go at our stay there.”
Harry parallel-parked the car, letting the crew in the jeep behind them to take care of their meters. Ruth had gotten to ride shotgun to capture each nervous tick of hers in the dashboard cameras as she drew closer and closer to her fate.
“You were so busy eating you didn’t tell me how your day went,” Harry pointed out.
Draco led Harry along, slowing when he needed to and when conversation demanded more eye contact. He had seen some clothing stores already but none fit his high standards as of yet. “I won’t lie to you, they slip up and say prejudiced things sometimes. They’re far from perfect, but they do try.” Draco checked his watch. Ugh, way too much time talking about his parents when he was supposed to be showing Harry a ‘night on the town’.
To amuse herself, Ginny looked at the water drops racing down the side of the window as she sipped her tea. The one on the right made a dashing start for victory, but it was the dark horse from the left that beat him out. It sort of reminded her of a Quidditch move.
“Well,” Draco broke the news to her gently. “It seems Brooke’s profile doesn’t have any actual pictures of her. Do you see how that could be problematic?”
But the cameras created an even greater problem.
Draco hadn’t left any mark on Hogwarts so lasting, or at least not a positive one. “Wow, really? I have to admit I haven’t kept up with what happens at our old Alma Mater.” He knew McGonagall was Headmistress now but that was about it.
“That’s true,” she nodded.
“Yeah,” Blaise agreed eagerly. She never got mad with him for staring at chicken breasts. Then again, chicken breasts didn’t turn him on. “And afterwards, we can go to that cupcake place you like so much.”
Pansy shrugged. “Hey, she’s probably happy to be at her boyfriend’s.”
“And it’s not simple finger-painting like other schools. We offer comprehensive courses on clay and wooden sculptures, modern art, and avant-garde theatre performance.”
Draco’s gaze flitted from feature to feature on Harry’s face. His green eyes, his long lashes, his plump, soft lips…
You know, just like all of those other adults who have incessant blood feuds against teenagers.
Draco went on singing, soft and low, and did so until he ran out of verses in his memory. Narcissa had done a better job than he with the words and it still seemed like he had a long way to go, but apparently Harry didn’t mind. He’d gone very still to listen, and… what was that?
“It has to be wrong,” Monica insisted. “I can’t be a Slytherin!”
“Worrying is in my blood.”
“Don’t. I’ve got it.”
Harry glowered. “Yes.”
The blonde put the milk and cookies down on the night stand, eyes still on Harry and the absolutely adorable pyjamas he was wearing. Draco usually took his lover to bed with much, much less on, but this was nice too.
“The biological mother is at eighteen weeks,” Harry confirmed with pride.
“Draco,” he began as if he hadn’t snapped at Draco for being so stuck-up that morning.
The halls were lined with vertically-striped wallpaper that peeled at the edges if one looked closely enough, and Draco had an eye for detail. “Disgusting,” he said flatly. He was past arguing with Harry and the bug-eyed hotel clerk and had resigned himself to complaining as he and Harry trudged down the hall.
“I’m not,” Harry piped up. “Some kind of gold-digger, you know. I have my own funds. I could buy a house the size of the Manor if I wanted and have plenty to spare. I’m not after Draco’s money or his home. Just… him.”
“While it would be fun to see you fumble with one,” Draco admitted, lighting the tip of his wand and holding it before Harry’s eyes. “I’m testing your reflexes here. Try and keep both eyes on the light.” He moved the wand back and forth slowly, watching how Harry’s eyes twitched to attention trying to follow it.
“I’m just so glad,” said Harry, another tear falling. “That they understand. I didn’t say it for the interview but I was so afraid—
Oh, if Lucius saw him now his shrewd heart would break. Not only was his son a Gryffindor-loving queer, but his fist around the family fortune wasn’t half as tight as Lucius’.
“What? You’re getting what you wanted,” Draco growled as he continued his brisk walk to the fireplace entrances. “I’ll hear you out on my way back.”
With a huff of annoyance Draco grabbed Harry’s wrists and pulled them in, placing Harry’s hands over the scars on his chest. “Then show me how sorry,” he demanded. With past partners Draco had always been in control of how they saw the scars, of what story he spun for them, but Harry knew the cold, naked truth of him lying on the bathroom floor sobbing and nearly bleeding out. It made Draco angry even though he’d long forgiven Harry, to see him still hung up on it when Draco was trying not to be anymore.
“Thank you,” Harry nodded, producing the black card to them. “Just ring me up on this.” Harry looked around him, nodding at all the different options of dress and play and knowing any of them could be his with the swipe of Daddy’s card. “I think I’m going to be awhile.”
A woman with a hot pink bag strutted by with a cellphone up to her ear, blabbing about some business deal or another. Behind her, two teenagers walked alongside one another and blushed when their hands accidentally brushed together.
Harry snickered and kissed his cheek. “No, you don’t.”
“Or make a crack about my clothes?” Ron added in.
“Um.” Dudley looked around nervously. “Look, I just don’t want to get caught in another magic place and have them try to erase my memory, okay? I’ll explain somewhere else.”
“Pretzel?” Harry offered begrudgingly when he realized Draco was staring at the soft pretzel he’d gotten from one of the airport shops like a starved lion.
“Look at them,” Draco marveled, looking out onto the hotel’s finished and polished dance floor being desecrated by a sexual smorgasbord of epically heteronormative proportions. “It’s like they were born to do this.”
“We exposed you for what you are! Sexual deviants, sinners in sheep’s clothing!” Bleremy boasted from his place on the floor. “Even if you kill me now, you can never put your secret back in its shameful closet!”
“All we know is her voice, Harry,” Draco reminded him.
“Just text me the license number so I can look it up—“

A small crowd had formed around the Chemistry door to witness what they hoped would be the next school throw-down. That would make two guy-on-guy fights in one week after Zacharias Smith had decked a ninth year who called him a coward.
“…You sing?” Harry asked curiously.
Draco didn’t linger long after his customary eyeroll. He took a deep breath, focusing hard on the Manor and closing his eyes only to have them open on the front door. Home sweet home, he supposed.
“I do,” Harry confirmed.
Draco shook his head, smiling. “Boner-killer,” he said affectionately.
“Who now has a committed girlfriend,” Harry pointed out. Draco and Pansy shared every intimate detail of their sex lives with one another, so Draco couldn’t exactly argue to the contrary. She and Maggie were a party of two.
“Fine. Then bugger the vaults idea. The ‘scream’ bit comes first, so that has to mean something.”
Jaws dropped.
That was actually sort of sweet? Harry nodded to show he understood.
“And why is that?” Draco asked in a voice that tried at calm but sounded shrill as ever.
There was no room for the cowardice Draco had been able to display under his mother’s wing during the war in the real world when she wasn’t there to protect him.
“Mum,” Draco said quickly. “Are you—?”
Harry didn’t want to quit this, to quit on himself. Everyone had to be bad at something before they mastered it, right? Well, Harry took to magic like a Giant Squid to water and in the process some other life skills has been left behind, especially ones outside of performing ‘male’, which he barely knew how to do either.
