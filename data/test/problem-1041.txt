'What?'  He tried not to snap, he tried to temper his voice into something friendly.  But...
'I was thinking about Harry.'  Ron murmured, stooping beside her, already spelling away the worst of the mess.
He was surrounded by The Boy Who Lived.
'They were frightened of me.  Frightened of what I could do, of what I was going to become.  So they made me sleep under the stairs.  They wanted control of me, control over what they didn't understand.'
'I think he won't survive, my lord.'  A moments hesitation.  A fraction of a second where this was not okay.
'No, you are not dreaming.'  Harry's hand finally fell to Draco's head.  'If you were, I'm sure you wouldn't be dreaming of me.'  He stroked Draco's filthy, matted hair away from his sweat slicked forehead.
'I...I should go.'  Harry found his voice, faint and full of an emotion he couldn't place.  'I'm sorry, Draco.  I really am so sorry.'  He could feel the tears welling in his eyes, the sight of the desperately sad boy in the enormous bed overwhelming.  He wanted to go over to him, to bury his fingers back into his filthy hair and try to offer a little comfort.
Draco couldn't fight it.  He was going to suffocate.  Panic set in.  He could hear Harry talking amiably to Filch, could even see him.  Only a matter of steps away.  But still too far.
'They took him, Neville.  They kept him for months.'  Harry raged, helpless with fury.  'Would you like all the gory details?'  He didn't wait for a reply, blindly forging ahead, wanting Neville to finally realise the extent of Draco's torment.  'He begged them to let him die.'  His voice shook, the black anger holding him tightly, a vice around his chest.
'I'm s...sorry.  I...I didn't mean to go, I...I was stupid.  I wouldn't go.  I...I can't.  I never would.'  Harry drew closer, his legs finally giving up, dropping to the floor by Draco's chair, pressing his face into Draco's knees, the great tide of tears sprung forth, overpowering him.  'I wouldn't.  Not...not without you.'
The headmistress stood beside Madam Pomfrey, her heart aching for them both.  Watching Harry as his hands twitched by his side, unsure what to do for the best.  Not knowing whether to flee or throw himself onto the bed.
Draco's eyes were heavy, it took all of his remaining strength to open them, to keep fighting towards that voice that pulled him away from the darkness.
'It's okay.'  Harry touching his face, his careful fingers stroking away the tears.  'It was a dream, only a dream.'
He saw Neville.  Dear sweet Neville who had gone for help when he had most needed it.
'It's all right, Draco.'  Harry whispered.  'It's going to be all right.'
But it had been.
'I found him like that.'  Neville told him, needlessly pointing.  Malfoy exactly where he had left him.  'What's happened, Harry?'
Reaching up, Harry selected a perfect box from an ocean of perfect boxes.  Bringing it carefully down from the precarious tower, he carefully examined every inch, every corner, for imperfections.
'Mother tried to move, but she couldn't.'  Draco did as McGonagall wished, his eyes locked on the wall ahead.  'I...I think she was going to come to me.  He wouldn't let her.  I...I only wanted a touch.  She was my Mummy.  She begged Him to let me go.  She said to take her instead.  Not Mummy, better it was me.  He laughed, He always laughed.  He made Father look at me, made him see what they had done.  Then the spells again.  Mother screaming, begging him to stop.  He...He said he would.  But Father had to kill her.'
Picking him up, Harry had to sit Draco down in the chair while he set to making the bed.
They hadn't.  No one had.
Of course he had slept thought the night, thank you for asking.  And yes, he had indeed finished all of his breakfast, and of course he had not been crying into the dark night, wishing for someone who was lost to him.  The muscles in his face straining at the pretence of a smile.
'I'll be with him all night, that is if he can stand the sight of me after I have told him that the one person he has trusted, the one person who can touch him without setting off a screaming nightmare has just betrayed him.  Draco trusted me with his secret.  Do you realise how important that was to him?  And I've just broken that trust.'
'Ron...  He did.'  Hermione spoke softly, sadly.
He wouldn't do that to any of them.
So completely alone.
Dean was going to the Weasleys this Christmas.  Neville finally telling Harry in confidence that Dean was going to propose to Ginny over the festivities.  And Harry knew he had his excuse.  In part wanting to be with Molly, Arthur, George and all, but needing to be with Draco.  Not just for the blond boy's sake, not for the chasing away of nightmares, but for his own.
'No...'  He choked, almost dropping the little glass phial he held.
'Ron, look...'  Harry never got to finish what he was about to say.
Shoving his cold hands into his pockets, he walked away.
The boy was a mess.  The once proud, haughty student debased in such a vile manner.  Beaten, violated, abandoned and left to die alone in the Forbidden Forest.
His fingers curled around the edges, holding it tightly.  A sliver of shining card peeked out from between the folds.  A makeshift bookmark. Harry edged closer, careful not to wake the slumbering boy.
Only it kept happening.  Night after night Harry followed that same routine.  He would get into bed as the others did, the usual chorus of 'goodnight' echoing around the room.  Shouts of laughter and sometimes catcalls as curtains were dropped.  Then there was silence.
Sectumsempra.
'No.'  He couldn't stop his own smile.  'But that doesn't mean he makes the right choices.'
'Is it?'  Hermione watched as Ron made no attempt to eat the lump of pork. 'Ron, they were kissing.'
'I am always with you.'  Voldemort's mouth splitting with a wide smile.  'I wait in your nightmares, my beloved Draco.  I am there when you sleep.  Watching you, waiting for you.'  He held that wand up, raised it high.  'You feel me, deep inside of you, walking in your footsteps.'
'Stay with me.'  Harry begged, feeling Draco drifting further away, his body slumping, his words slurring.  'Don't go.  Not where I can't follow.'
She could detail the treatments she herself had performed with her trembling hand.  The spells and the potions, the sleepless nights and the terrible realisation that it might all be in vain.  She could find the words for the rapes.  The torture, the dreams and the injuries.  She could tell of the nightmares and the vomiting.  The screaming and begging.  The bed wetting and the Boggart they had witnessed.
Capturing, cursing and screaming.
'All I wanted was something for me.'  But I guess that was always asking too much.'  He drew back a sob, tearing off his glasses and dragging his arm roughly across his face, the cuff of his jumper scratchy and cruel.  'I'll be who you want me to be, who everyone wants me to be.  I guess I never really had a choice in the end.'  He turned his back on her, it was time to leave.  She didn't get to see him cry.
'I don't like it for you.'  Draco admitted, looking into those sad green eyes.  'It's...it's so horrible.'
'What do you mean? You made me jump, that's all.'
'And he shouldn't have.'  She replied, knowing that Harry had every right to be furious with her.
Those days were a figment, a wishful hope that Draco would always yearn for.
'Close your eyes, Draco.  Trust me.'  Harry was pulling away.
'Draco...'  Each letter stretched, pulled tight and forced out between thin lips.  Hissed.  'Come to me.'
He would never see them again.  Never again hear his mother laugh, never again see his father reprimand him for some slight infraction.  They were gone, cast aside by the whim of a maniac.  His entire life wiped out in a fraction of a second, a blink of his eye.  He remembered the screaming, his mother pleading that her son be spared.  The laughter that had greeted her request.  The humiliation that her pleading had brought him.
Only, the nightmare was real.
It was what he did now, it was what they all did.  Pain cleverly held behind smiling eyes, jokes thrown around, tears held inside.  There was no going back, no recovery from the horrors.  The very worst of it lying in the bed beside him.
'Can't.  Or won't?'  Ron murmured.
'Draco...'
'What...what can I do?'  Neville asked.  'There has to be something.'
It wasn't real.
Harry was a murderer.
'It's not cloudy tonight.'  Harry whispered, his fingers tightening on Draco's waist.  'I thought you might like to see.'
Even the word was brutal.
'And it is.'  Harry smiled softly, touching his fathers cloak. 'Please, Draco.  There is no one I would trust it with more than you.'
'Soup first. Then book.'  Harry handed over a bowl of warmed chicken broth.  Noticing that Draco kept his Dark Mark branded arm tucked out of sight.
Each day a trial of new potions that would achive nothing other than pain, stinging skin and even once, bleeding.
The wand that made his dead parents dance.  Made their sunken, grey eyes look down upon him curled on the floor, grinning at him with vanishing lips, fleshless fingers twisting, asking, wanting.  They would be laughing too, if they had vocal cords left.
'That is why I brought Potter along with me.'  McGonagall threaded her arm through Pomfreys, leading her down the corridor  'We both agree that Draco cannot be on his own right now.  This is the clear solution.'
His warm, protective furs were gone.  Naked and cold, he lay upon the bed.
'His voice was like a snake.  Getting into my head.  I couldn't keep him out.  I...I had to believe him.  They all believed him.  They did what they were told, they...they alway did.'  Draco sobbed, his words disjointed, confusing.  'So many hands.'
But he couldn't stay here.  Throwing back the covers of his bed and opening the curtains, he set his feet onto the chilly stone floor, reaching around for his slippers and dressing gown.  He would go for a walk.
'Don't be rediculous.'  Harry coughed.  'What would I be doing with Malfoy?'  It hurt to say Draco's name in this way.
'How are you today, my boy?'  His voice boomed across the divide.
'Harry.  Do shut up!'  Draco laughed openly.  'Shut up and sit down, for goodness sake.'
The teachers had done a fantastic job in getting the castle back to is former glory.  But there was sympathy here also.  Plaques adorned the walls, bearing the names of the dead, monuments that stood proudly within the castle grounds.  It was not overwhelming, but it was necessary to all the ones who had fought, who would always remember the ultimate sacrifice.  New students would gather around the shrines, chattering quietly.  And the older students and teachers?  They would touch the memorials reverently, brushing fingers over the carved names of friends and family before walking quietly away.
'Are you sure, Draco?  It's no matter to me.  If you just wait a second...'  She waved her wand around his cluttered table, the books instantly rising and taking themselves off in the various directions in which they came.
Spent his childhood in a cramped cupboard, often hungry, sometimes crying.  Not a person in the world to give a damn about the poor little orphaned boy.
As wands were drawn from hidden pockets in black robes by faceless figures.  Circling, closing in on the boy on his knees.  Faces obscured, hoods pulled tight.  Elegant fingers turning, promising Hexes and agony, and so many desperate things.
And that difference had terrified him.
'Did you see?'  Asked one girl, turning to her friends with tears dry on her cheeks and hair pulled into tight pigtails.  'Was that...?'  Her voice was silenced, lest she utter that fated name aloud.
'He's terrified.'  Harry looked across at a very concerned Madam Pomfrey.  'You can't put him to sleep.'
And so...  So right.
Unknowingly, Harry mirrored Draco as he fell to his knees, already reaching out.
'I've seen you.'  Greg told him, knowing he had the attention of everyone around their table.  'I've seen the way you look at him, Theo.  Like...  Like you want to hurt him, make him suffer.'
On silent feet, Madam Pince inched her way to where the Malfoy boy slept, his eyes roaming freely beneath his closed lids.  She had first assumed he rested peacefully, but now she could see for herself that waking him might be doing the boy a favour after all.
This was the way of things now.  He had to get used to it.
Harry remained silent, he was all too aware of the eyes in the room.  He couldn't say.  It hurt that he couldn't tell his friend the reason he didn't give a damn about Quidditch was because of a tired, lonely boy that Ron continued to hate with a passion.  He wanted to be with Draco.  He didn't want the burden of playing a sport that he no longer loved, when he could be curled up in bed, book in hand, reading to someone who had become his...his everything.
But did he even like chocolate?  Harry thought sadly, knowing all too well that he knew next to nothing about Draco, other than his tormented dreams, and the untold months of his tortuous incarceration
'Harry has to go back to the castle eventually.'  Madam Pomfrey looked down at the two boys curled around each other.  'He will miss the evening meal.'
Draco had gone.
'Come back. Please.'
'I'm sorry.'
And silence once again took control.
Harry wanted to do nothing more than put his head in his hands and weep.  How had to come to this?  The name Malfoy whispered back and forth around the Great Hall, the voices growing, the interest rising.  Seamus looking mightily pleased with himself for delivering this earth shattering piece of scandalous gossip.  His grin couldn't be contained, and nor did he wish it to be.  Questions were thrown at the smiling boy, all of which he answered with a shrug, or a statement that he know nothing more.
He was quiet when he returned to the room, the overflowing mug in his hands.  Watching silently as Harry picked the thin boy from the floor with too much ease.  Not saying a word as Harry set Draco down on his bed, wrapping a blanket around his shoulders.
Naked in the dark.  Just as he should always be.
The way he always touched him was measured, careful.  Every brush of his fingers, every time he held his hand, reached out, it was planned, done in such a way as to not startle, to not provoke fear.  But this, tonight, was different.
Old memories brought forth the idea of the Forbidden Forest.  There, he would carry out his desperate deed there under the cover of trees, no one around for miles.
'Stay out here?  Someone would come looking for you sooner or later.  From what I recall, you tend to be rather popular!'
'Before I show you where you shall be sleeping, there is something I need to tell you.'  McGonagall halted him by the door to the bedroom.  'I didn't mention it before because I did not want to get your hopes up, only to dash them.  But...'  She stopped.
'You broke up again?'
'Don't worry about that, dear boy.  You are not a bother.  You can wake me whenever you need to.'  She set about lighting the dead fire in the hearth.  He needed warming up, and quickly, if she was any judge.  Heaven only knew how long he had been wandering the castle in that condition.  Considering calling for Poppy, she placed a blanket over his shoulders.  'Let me get you something to eat.  Or perhaps a drink?'
He should have thought about the direction Nott came from, and realised that he had been with Malfoy.  He was clever, he was perfectly capable of putting two and two together and coming up with four.  Nott was grinning, Malfoy was sat on the floor, ready to carve lumps from himself.
She never gave him a thought after that.
'I know, ssh, I know.'  Harry tried to soothe him, but knew there were no words in the world that could help.
'You look pleased with yourself.'  Millicent was the first to speak, obviously she had noticed it too.
'Only five minutes.'  Draco relented, his head resting against the warm fabric of Harry's pajamas.  He could be happy here.
'You won't ever be alone, Draco.  If you need anything, anything at all, you know where to find me.'
Magic.  Warmth.  And safety.  It seemed to flood through him, inside him.  His feet still refused to move away from those slowly encroaching footsteps.  But...  He knew who those steps belonged to.
'I...  Ron, I'm sorry.'  Harry could feel his own tears beginning to well.  'It's...It's been hard.'
Despite the late hour, Harry found that he could not sleep.  Even watching Draco sleeping softly beside him was not enough, not tonight.
'I have to go back to the castle.  McGonagall has already gone.  She is going to make up an excuse for me, but I still have to go back.'  Harry paused, his heart breaking.  He wanted to stay, friends be damned.  He wanted to lie back down with Draco and stay in this little bubble of warmth and comfort.
'I...I deserved it.'  Draco hung his head, unable to look into those green eyes.  The time had to come, Harry had to know that Draco was nothing.  No, lower than that.  Dirty, vile, unspeakable.  Harry needed to go now.  Walk out the door and never turn back.  Harry didn't need him in his life, messing it all up and causing problems.  He was free now, free to do whatever he wished.  He didn't need a filthy, worthless little whore ruining everything.  'I deserved it all.'
'I think I have found something.'  Professor McGonagall stood before Pomfrey's desk, waking her from sleep.  A small book, old and made from faded blue fabric, clutched in her hand.  'It might begin to explain what is going on with Draco.'
Just standing against the wall.  Smiling.  Smiling at him, his eyes hooded, his gaze dark.
Round and around and around they would go, Harry's arm tight around his waist, holding him upright when his legs were not able to.  Night after night, exhausted and spent, dropping to the bed with a fear that he would never really walk again.  A limp caused by a shattering of his hips, a flick of a wand, a booted foot.
Get him some water, he will be parched.'  Harry finally snapped to attention.  'I need to get him off this bloody floor.'
'We all have things in our past that we cannot look on with pride.  Look at what I did to you.'  Remembering.  'I almost killed you.'  His voice dropping with the shame.  'I can't ever be forgiven for that.  I...I think about it every day.  You lying there, choking, blood all over the floor.  I did that, I hurt you.'
'Harry, stop.'
'Oh, Harry...'  Draco's breath caught, his unsteady legs holding him in place in the open doorway, the door pushed back so he could see what lay before him.
'You can't stay awake forever either.'
'He would be nothing but proud of you, Draco.  Of that I am certain.'  She smiled softly, reaching over, touching his hand.
'It is for you.'
'Ssh.'  Harry was suddenly alert.  His head whipping around, facing the darkness of the hallway, and the noise that had drew all of his attention  'Someone's coming.'
'I am taking away your choice.  I cannot, I will not, allow you to throw your life away for this silly little moment we have had.  You will lose Ron, you will lose Hermione.  You will lose everyone you ever held dear.'
'He was also raped, tortured.  Left for dead.'  Harry swallowed thickly.  'By Voldemort, by Death Eaters.  By former students of Slytherin.  Professor, can you promise me, hand on heart, that it was not the fathers, or the brothers, or the uncles of the students in Slytherin who did this to him?  Can you?'
The slight tap at the door made Draco start, overwhelmed by dark thoughts.  Whoever it was didn't wait for him to reply.
Once again she had to be the sensible, detached Headmistress, however heavy that label had become.
'Go on then.'  Harry stepped closer, his eyes stinging.  He had done this to them all.  He had been the one to lie, to keep the secrets close.  He had hurt them, just as they had hurt him.
'Mum is over the moon.'  Ron smiled deeply, looking over to his baby sister with pride, remembering his mother's joyful reaction.  It was about time the matriarch of the Weasley family had something to smile about.  'She's thinking of throwing a party once the weather changes.  She...'  He continued his excited chatter, but Harry had already drifted off, the subject of Malfoy all but forgotten.  By everyone else at least.
'Father was crying.  I'd not seen him cry before.  I...I was scared.  I wanted to tell him that I was all right.  That I wasn't hurt.  But...but I couldn't lie to him.  He could see what they had done to m...me.'  A gasp, a hard breath.  'So ashamed.'
'I can't.'  Draco told him, not meeting his green eyes.  It hurt to look into those eyes and see the pain reflected back.  Harry was huting too.
'Harry...'
'Harry...'
He hadn't been sure.  Not then, not at first.
'I can assure you, Mr. Potter, we are doing no such thing.'  Professor McGonagall's voice was stern, even as her hands shook.  'We are doing all we can for Draco.  I warned you that it would not be easy on him.'
'Harry?  Draco?'  The tap on the door startled them both, lost in each other.  'Can we come in?'
'You can.  You don't have to be afraid.'  Harry closed the book, set it aside.  'Is there anything I can do?  Any way I can help?'
'Make it up with him, Harry.  And Hermione.  Don't throw them aside.'  Draco was pulling away, releasing his hold from Harry's jumper.  'Take back your friendships and never let them go.  Forget about all of this mess, it was brief, it didn't matter, not in the grand scheme of things.  I hope, one day, you can look back at this, at me, and smile.  And know that I was right.'
'You did what had to be done.  I...I wish it had not fallen to you, but there is no going back.  You saved us all, Harry.  You must never forget that.'
Time stilled in the tiny room that Draco now called home.  The sweet smell of honey on Harry's breath, his face, his mouth, inches from his own.  And those eyes, those eyes in his kind, gentle face, a face that had begun to mean the world.  How was this possible?  How had he been granted this?
Realisation finally crept up on Harry.  He was with Draco.  Close to him, lying beside him.  In his bed.
'Apparently not.'  Draco couldn't wipe the grin from his face, tears of laughter still shining in his eyes.
Harry may have said the word, may have even thought that he meant it, but Draco knew that he was only being kind.  It was laughable that Harry could see him as anything more than a pale, pathetic creature, someone who he would surely only ever pity.  Friend was not a word that could be shared between them.  It was impossible.  Something as big as that could never happen to the person that Draco was now.
It was a sound that pulled at Harry's heart.  Soft, choking.  A scream from an already raw throat.  It couldn't be contained, couldn't be helped.  Draco cried, his hands once again reaching out for something, someone, who wasn't there.
He was out of the portrait hole before Harry got the chance to reply.
'You're shaking.'  Harry spoke softly in the darkened room.  'Are you okay?'
Not today though.
The simple words from his visting son twisted deeply in his chest.  His grave mistake coming back to haunt him.
It was a mistake, one in which he had to see through.  The stone cold and hard and always unforgiving under his useless, shuffling feet.  It would hurt to fall, he would surely break something.  Harry would be here soon, he would find him crying on the floor, his legs twisted under him, blood on his brow.  He couldn't let that happen.  Harry would be devastated.
That was where he knew that name.
'You do keep trying.'  Harry told him, brushing a tangle of blond hair from Draco forehead as his eyelids fluttered weakly.
There was nothing he could do about it, Harry realised.  He couldn't go charging about the castle, demanding to see him, to reach out his hand and lead him back to the common room, back to this bed.  Draco had made his choice, and it was one that no longer included him.
'I...'  Draco choked, seeing for himself that so brief flash of compassion, of shared memories and childhood.  And just as soon as it had flickered across those hard features, it was gone.  Replaced with the raw anger he had first seen.
His place was here.
'Harry would fight for you.'  Madam Pomfrey told him.  She couldn't help herself.  Leaning forwards, she finally reached over the space between them and took hold of Draco's hands.
Madam Pomfrey always ready with a kind word, or a new potion that may just work this time.  They didn't.  Draco long resigned to time being his healer.  But it didn't stop her from trying.  Long years of training had never failed her before.  Draco was a painful reminder that she could not fix everything.
Anything, anything at all was worth this smile, this pure joy.
'Don't.'  Draco begged, his breath catching in his throat as he leaned into Harry's gentle caress.  This boy was his home.
There, that one among the many.  The one with the brittle glimmer in his eyes, his face hidden behind a mask, patterns of silver curlicues and burnished ebony.  A mask Greg had seen before.
'I...I don't know, Mother.'  He took the book from her, turning it over so he could get a better look at the young couple on the cover.
'You are safe.'  The voice repeated, the hand stroked.  'There isn't anyone going to hurt you anymore.  I'm going to look after you.'
Ron never expected the door to the bedroom to be opened.  He waited, listening as bare footsteps padded down the cold stone steps.  It was almost morning, the sun biding it's time just beyond the horizon.  Another Friday at Hogwarts, just like every other day of the week.
'Harry, you cannot stay here.'  Her voice gentle, ready for the heat of Harry's rage once more.  She was afraid, there was no doubt in her mind about that.  But fear, like her other emotions, was not warranted now.  'Harry?'
Soft, scared.  At first, anyway.  Becoming so much more than Harry had ever believed possible.  The way Draco had curled his hand in his hair, the way he had pulled back, just to check, just to see if it was all right.  It all settled in Harry's chest and became everything he never realised he had missed.
'Are you boys ready for that last staircase?'  McGonagall asked gently, breaking down the barriers between him and the hope of dreams.
Harry gave the tap a firm twist, unleashing a stream of tepid water that quickly became a steadily flowing gush of hot.  Plumes of steam eddied around him, immediately fogging up his glasses.
And here he was, with his very best friend.  They were playing a game, jelly beans at his elbow.
'Left?  Left for where?'
'I'm sorry I was grumpy with you.'  Draco broke the silence, his voice loud in the still night.
'I won't say anything, Harry, I swear it.'  He held up his hands, his face white, his stomach in knots.
Who was he without magic?  A child in the dark.  A nobody, a nothing.  Being a wizard was all he knew, had been all he ever wanted.  Magic, his parents, the Manor.  All were his life, and all were gone.
'Then you understand why Draco won't be returning to Slytherin.  I will never, ever allow him to be scared, or hurt, or put in any kind of danger ever again.  Draco is my friend.  And as such, I shall defend him with every breath in my body.  I will kill anyone who would dare to hurt him.'
'You need to keep as still as you possibly can, Draco.'  She told him again, uncorking the bottle.  'This will hurt.'  She eyed the open wounds on Draco's back.  Now that she was so close to him, she could see the utter severity of the punishment.
'I am about to head back myself.'  She tried again.  'I need to inform Draco's Head of House about the situation and fetch him a potion for the rest of his injuries.  Have something to eat, freshen up and get some sleep.  You can return later when it is time for Poppy to apply the potions.'
'I like it too.'  Draco brought him closer with a tip of his hand.  'I never once thought of what this could be, I never figured that you were missing from my life.  I thought I knew it all, Harry, I thought I knew what was in store for me.  And I was right, all of what happened was always go to.  Apart...apart from you.  I never expected you.'
'It's Friday night, Hermione, I am not doing homework.  That's what Sunday's are for.'
He came to a stop as his back hit against the far wall, crowded eyes already looking down upon him, like he was the monster and the rapist.  Like he was the Dark Lord who had been Draco's source of torment.  Shame gathered in him like a blanket and wrapped him up too tightly
And there he stayed.
'I hated you, Harry.'  Draco told him, wrapping the blanket from his legs over Harry's trembling shoulders, leaning close.
'I know.'  Hermione soothed, her hand gently rubbing some of the tension from his back.  'And I'm sure Harry feels terrible about what happened.  It's not like him, you are right about that.  I think there is more going on with him than he is prepared to admit to.  And this proves it.  Harry needs us to be strong for him.  Like he was for you after the battle, after we all lost Fred.'  She spoke quietly as they made their slow way back to Gryffindor Tower.  'He was great that summer, Ron.  So together and supportive that you couldn't have wished for a better friend.  Even after all he had been through himself.  Maybe what happened tonight, and how he has been recently, is his way of coping, of finally letting his own emotions emerge.'
'Draco didn't kill anyone.'
'We are not even friends!'  Harry's laugh carried no humor.  'He has no one, just me.  Someone he hates.'
'I'd...  I'd like some water.'  He admitted.  His throat sore from all the retching.
'No sorry's.'  Harry shook his head against Draco's shoulder.  'Promise me.'
Harry.  Walking away.  Leaving.
Harry watched in silence as Hermione made her way around the grounds of the castle, no doubt looking for him.
And Potter was his aid.
'Do you think anyone would notice if we stayed out here forever?'  Draco asked quietly.  'After all, I've already disappeared, that just leaves a suitable explanation for you.'
His fathers approach was more abrupt, more focused on his studies, his future.  But no less loving as a result.  Lucius Malfoy may not have been the most demonstrative of people, but there had always been a kiss at the bottom of the page, signed off 'with love.'
The night pulled in.  Harry slept beside him, his hand resting on Draco's gently moving stomach.  The touch intimate, soothing, right.
'Open it.'
'Water?'  She asked, the glass already in her hand.
'Like Harry's.'  Draco murmured, transfixed.
'I shall think of something to tell his classmates for tonight.'  Professor McGonagall came to stand beside her.  'Heaven knows that Draco needs him right now.'
'Almost time to go, Draco.'  Madam Pomfrey addressed him kindly, finishing with the folding of his pyjamas.  Harry's.  Harry's pyjamas.
'I think so.'  He answered before Harry protested for another minute.  Another hour.
Pomfrey was only feet away, sitting outside his closed door at her desk, pouring over books and parchment, trying to find anything that would give her some clue, some sign, as to why the Dreamless Sleep potion had caused only strange dreams and dark nightmares.  All Draco had to do was say her name, whisper it, and she would come.
'And you can still have all of that, Draco.  You can have a good job, a partner to love you.  It doesn't change anything.'
But his body had betrayed him.  The shivering cold had got Harry to his feet.  Had got him to hold out his hands, making Draco reply in kind, his own hands rising, waiting for Harry to help him to his tentative legs.
Hogwarts.
'This was me.'  Harry choked, hearing Draco's words but not able to comprehend.  For he had found them, the scars he had long looked for.  'This was what I did.'  His touch lingered over the buried white stripes of long ago healed wounds.  The ones of his own making.  'I hurt you, I put those scars on you.'  And where he found one, he found the rest.
'I won't say a word.  I don't know anything.'  He shook his head, a smile of reassurance.  'You know where I am if you need anything.  Anything at all, Harry.  Please remember that.'  A warm hand placed itself on Harry's trembling arm.'
'Harry...'  His hand slipped on the rail that ascended upwards, the Fat Lady was in view.  Just one little, tiny flight of stairs and he would be there.  Only there seemed so very far away.  'I...  I can't.'  His breath coming to him in short stuttering pants as he fought against the want to cry.
It was almost easy to let Harry guide him, pull him closer and wrap his strong arms around his weak body.  It was easy to lay his head against Harry's shoulder, his own hands pressing into Harry's back, impossibly closer.
'Why would Dad make that up?'  Ron asked, turning to Seamus.  'It wouldn't surprise me if they blew it up themselves, just to get rid of any evidence that would land them in Azkaban.  Maybe they aren't in France at all and they are already locked up and it's all being kept quiet.  That would explain why Malfoy stayed here for Christmas, and perhaps why he doesn't want to be in Slytherin anymore.'
And then Harry could be free, able to forget this brief, unexpected interlude on his path to a better life.  A life filled with happiness and light and most of all, love.
He appeared to be gathering up all that had spilled from Draco's ruined bag.  His head bowed as he pulled trampled and spoiled parchment into his arms, he too wanted to help, that much was clear.
'That is certainly not true.'  Madam Pomfrey smiled, the first one for many anxious hours.  'When Draco woke, your name was the first word he uttered.'
'No.'  A thrash of his head against the hard stone floor, a plea sent skywards.
'Can't.'
It would feel light in his hand, easy to wield.  His fingers itched, flexed, almost reached out.  They would fit so very perfectly around that thin thread, made for his hand alone.
'No, Draco.  They wouldn't.  No one would think that way.'
The blond boy resumed his laboured steps far beneath the window.
'All this time...  The boy?  His...  His Boggart.  It...  It also spoke the truth?'  She too had been cruel, thinking, always thinking the very worst of him whenever he passed through into Gryffindor Tower.  He hadn't belonged, he was only pretending.  He was a nasty, spiteful child who had no place behind her beloved wall.  And all this time the child...  She swallowed heavily, deep shame carving a path across her worn features.
Should the boy open his mouth and talk of his horrors, Nott knew that it would be his ending.  He had to think fast, had to convince his only hope, his son, that the Malfoy boy was a liar, a fool, a friend that had deceived them all.
'Neville...'  Harry's voice little more than a warning.  He was not to be crossed when it came to Draco.  Not now, not ever.
'It will be morning soon.'  Draco murmured, already slipping into sleep.  'You should go.'
Professor McGonagall caught the words that were whispered only for Draco.
'I'm not sure I do.'  Harry bit back.  He didn't blame them, not really.  He had been the one to press the glass to Draco's lips, making him, almost forcing him to drink the liquid.  Draco had cried, Harry remembered with a lurch.  He had cried and begged Harry to not make him.  He had known all along that the potion would make him go back.  Back to those terrible dreams, back to the torture and the pain.  He had done that to him.
Harry had to draw his wand to spell the mattress dry.  Draco turned away, shaking at the sight.  How would he ever be able to hold a wand in his own hands again?  Just the thought of gripping tightly to a thin piece of wood and feeling the power within his fingers made him feel sick.  How could he ever hope to become a true wizard?
It was his life, it was his secret if he so wished it that way.  She could help allow him that.
'I...  Harry, I...'
But he didn't have Draco.
Harry couldn't stand it a moment longer.  He pulled Draco tight to him, knowing that he had to be causing considerable pain.  But Draco didn't cry out.  He needed to be close to him, pain be damned.  He leaned into Harry, burying his face into Harry's jumper.
'I'm sorry, I...I should have come sooner.'  Draco spat out, desperate to say all he wanted before the tears began.  'I...I want to...to thank you.'
'No, it's not that.'  She glanced over to the pair on the bed, feeling for all the world like a voyeur.   'Who would want to disturb a moment like that?'
It was already too much, too many had already turned away.
Here was a boy stood before him that he wanted to know, a boy he wanted to call friend.  A hope of better things, for himself at least.  A wish of friendship, glamour and recognition from the impossibility that was Harry Potter.  A name he had heard about since he slept in his cradle.
'Why did this have to happen?'  Harry's voice was so soft that it took Neville a long moment before he realised he was being spoken to.  'Why now, why this?  Hasn't he already lost enough?'  He watched as Harry stroked his hand over Draco's hair, so gentle in his movements that Neville couldn't answer for fear of crying.  'Put it all away, Neville, please.'  Harry begged.  'It's too much to bear.'
'I'll come next time, Ron.'  Harry smiled, eternally thankful for the sudden rescue.  He dropped his barely eaten breakfast back onto his plate and stood.  'I'll see you when you get back.  Get me some sweets, would you?'
This one was new.  The blood fresh, the cut open and weeping slowly.  Down over his arm.  Over the black brand of that other Curse he bore.
There was no pretty way of putting it, no other way of describing what he had done to that monster of a man.
'Good morning to you too, Hermione.'  He blinked heavily at her, dragging his eyes away from the table decked in silver and green.
It went without question that the boy would die.  Only...  Only there were hisses, words that ended with whispers, ribald laughter.
Harry eyed it all with trepidation, wondering if his stomach was up to the task, wondering if he should pocked a bun or two to take back to Draco.
The potion washed over him, dragging him down.  The hut fell away.  The quiet chatter from the two remaining voices drifted, caught in the air and vanished.  The memory of the way Harry had held him faded.  His safety gone.  The darkness was coming, claiming him once more.  They said he wouldn't dream.  They promised.
'The thought terrifies me, Draco.  That...that I may have known who...who did those...those things to you.'  Draco watched as Slughorn reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a silver flask of what could only contain alcohol.  'I may have taught them, I might have dined with them.'  His hands shaking as he unscrewed the stopper.
His son had drank in the stories, reveled in the nonsensical.  Wanting to believe, wanting to claim Slytherin as his own.  Of course he would never consider his revered father could lie to his face, why would he?
She watched the dark-haired boy during the lesson.
'Y...  Yes, Professor.'  Draco forced a smile, already feeling sick to his stomach at the thought of eating.  Water, that was all he wanted.  'I'll head there now.'  Slughorn nodded, his good deed done for the day.  Patting him roughly, he retreated back inside his classroom, shutting Draco out.
A sharp bark of laughter woke him from what was almost a deep fall into darkness.  And for a moment he had to remind himself where it was he sat.
'You are still holding his fucking hand!'  Ron raged.  Draco twisted in Harry's warm hold, pulling his hand free.  'At least the ferret has the decency to feel ashamed!'  Ron spat,   'Get out of here, Malfoy.  There isn't a person alive that wants you here.  It should have been you, not Fred.'  Ron could feel hot, helpless tears streaming down his face.  'You should have been the one to die, not my brother.'
'Potter.'  McGonagall's hand on his arm jerked him back to reality.  He had been so comfortable, they both had.  Draco leaning into him, his breathing steady, the terror abating.  'It's getting late, the evening meal will be starting shortly.'
No.  Ron was more than his friend.  He was his family, his brother.  He had wanted to hurt him for his words.  He had only seen red, only heard the hatred exploding from that kind face, words of cold-hearted anger, directed at the person Harry had come to...
'Talk to me, Harry.  Please.'  She reached out, grasping his hand in its mindless destruction, and held it tightly.
Until now, until Harry.
He had been shocked that night in the locker room, Harry sobbing on him like his heart had broken.  In all the years, and through all the struggles, Neville had never seen Harry like this before.  He hugged him, told him he would listen.  And above all, he believed him when Harry said it wasn't Ginny.
'Phoenix feather.'  McGonagall told him, following his gaze.
There was a figure walking towards him with purpose.  For a split second he thought it might be whoever had left Draco, coming back to finish the job that had begun months ago.  But no.  It was Harry.
'You can't mean that.'  Harry whispered, his eyes sparkling.
'Not going anywhere.'  He smiled shyly.  Harry knew, of couse he did.
'Stop it with your stupid stutter, Malfoy.  We both know it's a twisted little act you have got going on.  No one cares about you.  No one will ever care about you.  Not even that dirty old man you are trying to fuck.'
He was getting stronger, he could feel it in his bones.  That itching in his limbs, the will to move his frail body.  But what then?  What was to happen once he was upright, standing on his own two feet?  Where did he go after that?  He couldn't stay here, safe in his tiny little room.  Away from prying eyes, curious questions and inquisitive students.  How would he find the answers they would surely demand?  How could he ever tell anyone what had happened to his unwilling self.  The thoughts sickened him.
'You haven't.  Ssh.  You haven't.' Draco soothed, finding himself to be the one now trying to offer the crying Harry comfort.  'It's okay.  It's my fault.'
'It's not goodbye,'  Draco whispered, his hands reaching up, framing Harry's face.  'We never really had a hello.'  He swallowed back his own burning sobs, brushing at Harry's streaming eyes with the tip of his thumb.  'No more tears.'  He whispered gently.  'You have cried enough over me.'  Draco closed the distance, knowing that this was the last thing he and Harry needed right now.  But he knew he couldn't do it any other way.  'Thank you.'  He murmured, 'for everything.'  He pressed his lips to Harry's, felt them yield beneath his.
'I...  I do not know what it was that Draco saw.'  McGonagall told the teary eyed boy.  'I was not quick enough.'  Another thing to add to her ever growing list of regrets.  She could well picture what horrors had visited the corridor of Hogwarts.  She had tended Draco's body, she had heard his cries.  'But...  I can only imagine.'
They would be there, some would have returned.  Faces that bore the likeness of their family.  Eyes that would remind him of every touch, every smell, every bitter taste.  He knew, knew who had been there, visiting his Cell.
It was better to hang back and risk being late to whatever lesson was next on his timetable.  Thankfully it was only dinner, and he had no intention of going there.  Slughorn, on the other hand, had no such reservation.
'She will want answers I don't have.'  Theo shook his head, his voice scratching and sore.  Potter and his hands had done a firm job.  He coughed, swallowed.  The pain was no more than he deserved.  'I have to get them.'
'You saved his life, Hagrid.'  Harry spoke, turning his head so he could look at his friend.  'Thank you.'
Almost.
Where the nightmares lived.
Could it be simple?  Could he find the words to make everything right?
It only took a moment.  Harry unbearably gentle wih him, guiding him, leading him to the fireplace.  He helped him down to the floor again.  His hips twisting, his breath catching at the pain racing up his spine.  He swallowed it down, didn't let Harry see.
She would hold his hands, press her body close to him.  And kiss him so thoroughly that it would make him think things he had no right to about the sister of his best friend.  At the time, at least.  It had all gone so wrong after that.  Long before he should have put a stop to it, long before he broke her heart.
'Come on, let's go back.  I'll go fetch us something from the kitchens, are you hungry?'  Harry ready to turn his body from the closed door, Draco tighter than possible against his side.  Trembling.  He was wrong to bring him here.  They should have stayed where they were safe.  The little bubble of warmth that was Draco's room.  Books waiting for them, candles and covers and sleep.
'I don't think it was ever love.'  Harry replied softly, his voice quieter than normal.  'I wanted it to be, but...  She always deserved more then I could ever give her.  She loved me, she told me so, but I could never bring myself to say it back.  I wasn't kind.'  He drew idle patterns on Draco's thigh, distracting himself from the myriad of emotions that Ginny had raised.
Professor McGonagall had always wanted to be a teacher.
'No, it's me.  I'm being stupid.  Forgive me?'  His finger played along the length of Draco's forearm.  He had yet to touch the Dark Mark.  Neither boy prepared for what might happen should Harry's gentle caress stray over the black brand.  Draco sighed, tiredness washing over him.  His chest ached for the despairing boy beside him.
'You got your answers.'  Greg spat, his anger catching up.  'What you did...'
'There is no need to be so bloody nasty.'  He roughly pushed Ron away, went to Draco.
'Do you think so?'
He had been scared and worried and a coward.  He had done nothing but pretend his ears were lying to him.
'Draco, I...I can't take this.'  He offered up the delicately crafted glass figurine.
'Mr Malfoy is adamant that he wants to attempt to live a normal life as possible.  He is a wizard, Poppy.  It is our responsibility to help Draco with his future, whatever that may hold.  Should it turn out that he is no longer able to perform magic, or indeed own a wand, then it is up to us to guide him through what would undoubtedly be a very difficult, confusing transition.  But, as it stands, neither he, nor we, know what the case will be.  I will not force him.  Draco has time.  His life with Hogwarts does not have to end when eighth year is over.  He can stay.  Indefinitely if he so wishes.'  Her sigh spoke volumes.  'I could have seen it, Poppy, I should have seen it.'
'I believe we may have.'  McGonagall told him, taking the place Harry had vacated.  'Draco, could I ask you a few questions?  You may find them difficult to answer.'
'So I am right then.'  Neville snorted, the distaste clear.  'You have been with Malfoy.'
The Library would be closed, the Room of Requirements still left a sick feeling in his stomach as he thought about his time with Ginny between those four walls.  The Owlery no longer contained Hedwig, the Astronomy Tower held the memory of Dumbledore.
McGonagall holding court over the dining students, Madam Pomfery in her usual chair.  Potter at the table where he belonged.  The world was as it should be.
'But can you keep Harry safe?'  He looked up into her sad eyes.  'Can you stop him from arguing with his dearest friend?  Can you make him sleep in his own bed?  Can you prevent him from coming to me in the middle of the night?'
'I'm sure you wouldn't be.'  She protested, not fully believing her words.
Draco watched as Ron and Hermione glanced up, looking around the room for any sign of their friend who had only been a step behind.  Sighing with weary resignation, the pair whispered to each other, glancing surreptitiously in his direction, before quietly opening their books.
'Are you okay about it?'  Draco asked carefully.  'You loved her too, once.'
She swirled towards him, body bloated and deformed.  Her eyelids peeled back to reveal milky white orbs that focused on nothing and everything.  She too tried to make her voice heard in the crushing silence of the darkened corridor.  A bubble burst from her slack jaw,  an inaudible gurgle that spoke of nothing more than the death of her lungs.
'No.  Not once.  I...I scare myself.'
'Milly...'  He hissed at her, pulling her to a sudden stop.  'Greg, wait.'  He tugged at her again, pressing himself up against a wall and drawing the pair towards him.  'Just a minute.'  He bowed his head, forcing them to do the same.
Milly put her hand on his arm, her fingers wrapping around his wrist, offering what little comfort she was able.  'They would have hurt you too, Greg.'  Her voice subdued, her words quiet.  'You know that they would.'  She too would have walked away.
'You don't have to do this, Harry.'
Slippery hands pushed and pulled and arranged tormented flesh.   The dying boy forced to endure, forced to look at decaying faces set in rictus grins, twirling to music that wasn't there.
'The voices...'  Draco told him, naked and shivering, watching Harry as he stared down at his prize.  'They were so loud.  I didn't...  I didn't think.  I couldn't think anymore.'  He shook his head, swiped at his tears.  'He was always there, and I thought...  Thought that McGonagall might not quite know.  It's in me, it's always in me.'
Lights twinkled against the stone walls of the castle, candles burned across the damp grass, it was a haven of peace and comfort.
He deserved all that had been done to him, he deserved more.
They were holding him down, they were pulling at his legs, wrists.  Stretching him out for all to see.  Hands crawling over his body, leaving scratches, making him bleed.  He tried to shout out, tried to beg them to stop with there foul torment.  But no.  Hands and teeth, fingers and nails.  Dragging over him, turning him around and around.  His legs were forced apart, made to ask for the unthinkable.
Draco.  His own Draco.
Draco would be waiting, always waiting for the night, for Harry to arrive.
Casting her eyes up that final flight of steps, her gaze fell on the gilded portrait of the Fat Lady.  Another hurdle to cross before the boys could be led to safety and solitude.  'You stay there, and I shall go and get the door open.'  With a pat to Harry's shoulder, she hitched her skirts and put her foot on the bottom step.
He should have realised back then that the monsters under his bed were nothing compared to the cold, hard truth.  It wouldn't be the monsters who would hurt him.  It was the humans who had turned out to be far more dangerous than any demon his young mind was able to conjure up.
'Nice to see you too!'  He grabbed at her, needing her warmth, her softness.  'Good holiday?'
He had to make do with the heat from the hot water tap.  It was not as if he was going to sleep the night away, so frequent trips to the bathroom to begin the process again would come as a welcome distraction, and they would help with keeping him away from the sickening tug of sleep.
There had never been another, not like this.  This familiarity, his body pressed between Harry's legs, his stomach being touched, his own hands wrapped around Harry's.  Stroking his fingers, lacing them together, like it was the most natural thing in the world.
A boy she had sworn to protect, in the arms of Harry Potter.
'You can.  You have to.'  Draco replied easily, not needing to ask what he was talking about.
'Then why does it hurt?'  Harry whispered.  'Why can't they understand?'
'Thank you.'  His voice strangly thick, Harry could be forgiven for thinking that Draco was about to cry.  'Would...would you open it for me?'
'Minerva, you could not have known.  No one could.'
'It's a party down there.  No one will notice if he slips away, I swear.'  Neville stepped closer, his hand reaching out.  Draco flinched, forced himself hard against the solid wood at his back, anything to get away from those grabbing hands.  'Sorry.  I didn't mean to frighten you.'  Neville spoke softly, snatching his hand away, his feet retreating.  To see Draco Malfoy reduced to this...
Follow it, follow it down into the black abyss, where his parents endured, where the men waited.  Where the dead lived again.
Harry sniffed, taking the offered tissue from Neville's outstretched hand, and edging over to make a space for him on the bed.  'He kissed me, Neville.'  Harry told him quietly, hesitant in sharing the fragile moment with his friend.  'Last night.  He kissed me.  And, well, it was the first time.  But...  It...it was perfect.  I was so scared of hurting him.  But it was perfect.  And now it's over, ruined because we weren't careful.' He tucked the letter under his pillow, it was only for his eyes.  'I'm guessing Draco and I will be the talk of Hogwarts before the first lesson even begins.'
'Not without you.'  His voice hardly heard.
A whisper of a promise, a command in the void, someone, something, lurking in the shadows, beckoning him closer.  Waiting.  Always waiting for him to arrive.  Just out of his sight, promising him the world, if he would only just follow.
'What about that girl you were dating?  Ginny, is that her name?  Doesn't she wonder where you are all the time?'
'I wanna stay here, with you.'  Heat suffused Harry's cheeks.
But the cost was too high.  It was breaking Harry.
'Can't a man be happy?'  He continued to grin, flicking aimlessly through the book at his side.
'Please...'
'I...I did.'  Draco sobbed.  'They...they said I did.'
'Don't.'  Draco breathed against those questioning fingers.  Catching, kissing.
Ron took his place beside a silent Hermione, her breakfast untouched before her.
'Yes.  It's a map.'  Harry grinned.  'You can see where every single person is all the time.  And there,' he pointed to the corridor outside of Draco's room.  'Empty.'
Would her castle home ever see the light again?  Would the hallways ever ring out with the sound of laughter?  Was Hogwarts truly beyond all repair?
'Looks more like he was taken, Harry.'  Hagrid whispered.  'Someone left him to die.'
'Yes, indeed.'  She took her place at the little kitchen table.  'It brought colour to his cheeks when he informed me that their friendship has taken a more intimate turn.  And I must admit I am heartened by this news.  It proves to me that Draco is not as broken as he believes himself to be.'
Malfoy had been carrying around a picture of Harry.
That surprising treasure sat deep within his pocket, a comforting weight against his thigh as he once more took his solitary place at the desk.  A treasure he would look upon later.  Much later, when the castle slept and he was alone with the voices once more.
The House Elves welcomed the great and good Harry Potter into their kitchen with open arms.  Neville too.  The polite, unassuming boy from Gryffindor who accompanied a sad looking Harry.  He held his arm loosely, almost as if Harry was ill, weak with some ailment that they were not privy to.  Harry clearly needed sustenance, something the House Elves could more than provide for the wonderful Harry Potter.
'It's you.'  Harry turned his eyes from the figure standing in the doorframe and back to his lap, to where he held the letter Draco had written.
They came back to him.  In his dreams.  In his nightmares.
'Harry...'  Draco's soft voice stopped Harry from moving forward, from reaching towards the red-headed boy in anger.  'It's okay.'
The low level silencing charm that McGonagall had cast around his bed prickled his skin.  The room was still empty, his new roommates had yet to come to their own beds.  It wasn't surprising.  Draco knew without a doubt that he would be the sole focus of their angry conversations.  He couldn't begin to imagine the words being said about him.  He didn't care, not really.  He only cared about what Harry must be going through.
'Listen to me.'  Harry sat in front of him, carefully taking Draco's bruised face in his hands.  'You can't stay here anymore.  You need to be looked after properly.'
The weeks drifted by on clouds of wonder, heated speculation.  Voldemort growing impatient, his time coming, the fight drawing ever closer.
So many returning students wore that look now, and it was always best not to ask questions that she didn't want the answers to.
It was shampoo.  His extortionately expensive shampoo and a cap that he had failed to tighten properly.  The liquid had seeped into everything.  He crushed the destroyed letters in his hands, the treasured photographs mangled upon his lap.  Dried fluid ruining the images of his parents forever.
The nightmares that took him when Harry was away were unthinkable.  Real, sickening.  Every touch, every spell, every single event burning into his skin.  But Harry didn't need to know that.
It couldn't put the past right, it could never make any difference to the life they now shared, but Draco needed it.  Needed to say the word that haunted his waking days, and consumed his nights.
This was lonely.
'Oh!  Oh, God.  Draco...  I'm so sorry.'  Harry tore his hand back, pulling away.  'I...I wasn't thinking, I...'  How could he have done this to him?  Touching him against his will, being so very free with his body.
'I am out of options.'  He told her, staring down at his trembling hands.  'Everyone will know where I am.'
Malfoy looked like he was about to speak, his mouth opening, closing.
'I speak only the truth.'  Raising her voice, McGonagall folded her arms across her chest and appraised the portraits that surrounded her.
'It's not true.'  Harry whispering to him, his hand warm and gentle, his thumb rubbing along the back of Draco's hand.
Draco could see Harry from the window.  Watched his feet moving slowly over the shadowed grass.  Watched as he didn't turn his head, didn't look behind.  Didn't come back.
Was that blood..?  Ron blinked and turned away, his lie already too deep.
'You do realise that is impossible, don't you?'  Harry smiled.  'You could never be ignored, Draco.'  A hint of teasing in his voice.  'I gave up trying to do that years ago.'
Harry knew that wasn't exactly the way of it, but as he peeled the sweat soaked, urine tinged clothes from his body, it was hard to think of it in any other way as Draco was bared to his gaze.
The Fat Lady made no comment when Harry whispered the password so very early.  He hadn't been back all night, out roaming the halls no doubt, unable to sleep again.  She allowed him entrance, the despondent, red eyed boy was on the verge of tears, she realised sadly.
'He has Mum and Dad.  He has us.'  Ron murmured, hurt by her words.
Pain.  Endless twisting light.
And then Draco sent him away.  Told him that he had to go, go and concentrate on his lessons, go and eat, sleep.  Spend the night apart.  Told him that he didn't want Harry to return until the morning.
'So...so real.'  Coughing, gagging on blood that was no longer there.  'M...make them stop.'
Potter's head whipped in his direction, his emerald gaze openly hostile as he locked onto him.
The Dark Lord.  He was there, smiling his wretched grin.
Probably not.
'Nothing about this is your fault.'  Harry slowly raised his head.  'It's me.  I...I don't even know what I am doing anymore, Draco.  I...I'm scared.  I'm scared all the time.'
As he was forced to look upon his own father.  His flesh, his blood, his dear dad, watched as he appeared before his lonely friend.
From behind her dipped glasses, she saw him take out his things from that tatty bag he carried around.  Parchment, a single quill and a pot of ink. Setting it all out before him, ready for a long evening of concentrated study.
'Self preservation.'  Draco sighed, his body heavy.  'I'd even settle for the rain right now, anything to be out there.'
'Dreaming.'  Draco whispered.  'Please...  No.  Don't...  Don't w...wake me.'  It hurt to talk, it hurt so much.  But he had to get the words out, the voice had to know.
But Draco was adamant, unswerving in his repeated answer.  It had to continue as it was.  It was for the best.  There would be too many questions, too much interest.
He had almost slept.  The bottle at his back was cold, his water glass empty.  The voices calling from the distant dreams.  Nightmares touching his skin.  There it was again, that laugh, carried on the breeze to his open window.  And with tired legs, he got out from the bed, walked over to the laughter.
Merlin, that last kiss.  Right there in the corridor, where anyone who had cared to look too keenly could have seen them both.
And there he would wait.  Wait for Fred's face to emerge between the curtains, his grin wide, his eyes sparkling, telling him that it was only some great joke.  He hadn't died at the end of a wand, how would that even be possible for him to die in such a way?  He had so much life left to live.  He hadn't left them all behind, the very idea unthinkable.  Oh, how his brother would laugh at the shock he delivered.
'I'll never forget, not any of it.  For as long as I live.'  He admitted quietly, closing his eyes.  'I couldn't.'
'You couldn't face me.'  Draco nodded, understanding.  'It's okay.  I get it.'
'I hate to make you cry.'  He told Harry softly.
He couldn't be here.
'All day, if I thought I could get away with it.'  He spoke with a smile, stepping forward, tossing aside the damp towel.  He saw Draco's shoulders move in a laugh, how he was still able to laugh after the night they just had was beyond him.  'You okay?'
'Will it be enough?'  He asked, begging her for the answer to everything.
'This one?  It's Oliver Twist.'  He held it up so Draco could see.  'It's my favourite.'
She had glanced from her desk when he had appeared hours ago, selecting books from the shelves quietly, not paying attention to the students who also watched his progress around the stuffed cases.  The Librarian noticed that they talked behind their hands as he passed them by, grinned and turning to their partners, their voices hushed.  And she watched as the boy ignored it all, not making eye contact, not acknowledging anyone else in the room.  He steadfastly selected whatever book he needed, piling them up in his skinny arms and taking the stack over to the far most table.  As far away from anyone as was possible.
'I promise you.'  And Draco was once again back where he only ever wanted to be.  Safe in Harry's arms.
Just out of his desperate reach.
'You...you are going?'
'Harry...'  Draco pulled the book to his chest.  'It's your favourite.'
'No, you're right.  It's an invasion of privacy.'  Draco valiantly tried to school his features.  But it was no use, the look of consternation on Harry's face was just too amusing.  He dissolved into a peal of giggles once more.
'There you are, Potter.'  McGonagall was by his shoulder.  'Are you ready?'
George was a shell.  His annoying, teasing, adored brother was gone.  Still there in body, but not in spirit.  He too had died alongside his twin.  And it hurt to look at him.
The voice calling his name was his family, his home.
'No, no, no.'  Draco cried, his head shaking back and forth.  'Stay, stay here.'  Panic setting in.
'Once.  Only once.'  Another thing that Harry had never spoken of.
Finally his mind had been made up for him.
'I told you to leave Draco alone.  I begged you to leave him be.'  Greg was up in his face, his eyes flashing.  'But you couldn't, could you?  You had to have the last word, the last little victory over him.  Fucking Hell, Theo.  Hadn't he already been through enough?'
It was morning.  Finally the light broke into his room, touching the floor, washing over the walls.  Once again he had survived the long, lonely night.  And from his high window he saw people, students gathering on the path before the entrance.  Laughing, pushing and shoving with good humour.  Saturday.  His mind supplied.  It must be Saturday again.  And once again, a trip for them all into Hogsmeade.
Perhaps it would be the Headmistress.  Perhaps she would be the one to cut him down, to ease the vicious cord from his reddened throat.  She would hold him on the floor of his lovely room, tears never normally shed would escape.  She would beg his lifeless body for answers he would never be able to give.
Harry turned away from the stairs, turned to the two people who knew him better than anyone.
She herself could do all she would to help.  She could help him with his tests, could read to him every day and encourage his efforts, praise his small victories.  But she knew, deep in her heart, that he would never pass an exam.  He would never complete an essay, or finish reading a book.
Hermione held her breath.
It was madness to reach up, madness to clasp his hand around the back of Harry's neck and draw him ever closer.  This path only led to heartache and loneliness.
'I'm sorry, Draco.'  Madam Pomfrey spoke to him.  'But I have to ask.'
'You don't ever have to ask me that.'   His eyes closing, his fingers finding those lips that smiled beneath his questioning fingers.   'I...Harry, I...'
'I'll take you back.'  Harry told him, squeezing his waist.  'It was stupid of me.'
'Ronald!'  Hermione exclaimed, jumping back just in time as the glass tube Ron had been holding carelessly slipped through his distracted fingers and shattered on the floor.
'He will kill you.'  Draco murmured, his voice fading.  Voldemort's curse rattling through his weakened body.  'He wants you.  Don't...don't let Him find you with me.  He wants to kill you.  Run.  Please, Harry.  You...you can't help me.  Leave m...me here.  I...I won't tell.'
'I don't want your pity, and neither does Draco.  But I do want your silence.  I'm telling you now, Neville, if you breathe one word about this, I'll...I'll...'
'Not...not sleep.'
'No.'  He turned his head towards Harry.  'I can't do it.'
What had he given in so easily?
How was anyone to know that Draco would be sitting up in his tiny bed, blankets over his shivering legs, with a hot water bottle that was undoubtedly cold by now.  Holding it tightly in case some warmth happened to slip into his chilled fingers.
'Oh, all right.'  She sighed.  She was tired, she hadn't been sleeping.  Maybe the fight just wasn't worth it.  'I suppose he would let me.  And I guess I could do with something to eat.'  She allowed him to slip his hand into hers.  'Come on then.'
Ron was shoving something at him, papery and glinting in the strained sunlight.  'Look, you have to look.'  He urged, desperate as he pressed the paper closer, forcing him to look.
The return visits to Grimmauld Place had been sporadic, just mainly spent doing the cheerless place up a little.  He was determined that he would call it home after Hogwarts.  Even Ron had shown an interest in moving in with him.  Neither boy had an urge to be alone.
'Hagrid!'  McGonagall's exclamation roused Harry further.  He realised that he had not given his friend any further thought after last night.  Everything had happened so fast.  Hagrid had fell from his mind, taken over by Draco.
'Are you prepared to cross the only person alive who was able to kill the Dark Lord?'  She didn't try and stop the slight smile that crossed her lips.  'Harry is right, Draco stays here.'
He could have Harry back if he just listened, paid him some attention.  Be the best friend that Harry deserved.
'Whatever you want.'  Harry flushed, a sudden heat suffusing his once ghostly pale cheeks.
'Told you that did he?'  Neville sighed, exasperated.  'If you believe that, then you are a fool, Harry.  Can't you see that Malfoy is nothing but a liar, a treacherous snake!'  His voice rose, wanting, needing Harry to realise, unless it was simpler than that, baser.  'Are you fucking him?'  That last, shocking word coming from his dear friend was Harry's undoing.  He couldn't hold his anger in any longer.
It wasn't done, Harry always slept above the covers, always with his back against the headboard, awkward, but sleeping none the less.  But not now, not tonight.
They had come for him, of course they had.  The beautiful dream with the emerald eyes had been snatched away, leaving only white hot pain that blazed through his body, setting alight to his bones, searing his flesh.  He tried to talk, to beg, to pleed, but the only sound that forced it's way from his throat was a weak, pathetic cry, his eyes leaking the precious water the kind voice had given him.
'Tell that to my family.  Tell that to George.'  He pulled his hand from hers, rising to his feet.  'I've forgotten to finish my Runes homework, I'll see you later.'  He walked away from the table without a backwards glance.
'I'm so sorry.'  He couldn't help but repeat, an endless loop of apologies.  It would never be enough.  It would never take away what he had done.  'I...I thought it would help.  I thought you would sleep.'
'No.'  A soft shake of his head.  'You have no idea what you give me.'  Draco's lips curving into a sad, knowing smile.  'They took all of me.  Everything.  My parents, my mind, my body. They left me with nothing.  I was nothing.'  He shivered despite the warmth.  'In...in that place I knew my life was over.  But then Hagrid found me.  I...I didn't want him too, I wanted to die.  They took it all.'
There was nothing more than this cold, hard, disgusting touch.  All of them, so many of the glittering masks, the black cloaks, the torment beginning anew.
Harry waited, listening carefully until the group had passed safely by their hiding place.  'Are you okay?'  He asked him softly, watching him.
Draco had come to realise very early on within his Cell that there were some men who were worse than others.  Some with tricks, cruel ways that haunted his waking hours, some with a darkness so deep there was no hope of reasoning.  But for all that, for all he endured, he knew that the bodies could only do so much.  They could hurt, taunt, punch, kick.  Violate.  But the wands...  The wands were something else.  The various strips of carefully crafted wood.  Precious to each individual owner.  Guarded with a savage intent that would never be broken.
He wandered for hours, climbing up stairs and walking into unlocked classrooms, remembering the places of fun, the places of death.  He was done with crying.  A summer spent in mourning had dried up what tears he had left.  There was only so much sobbing a person could do before the tears stopped, before the heart started to slowly mend.
'This is all we have left, Hermione.'  Ron felt the prickling of tears once more.  'This is the only place where we can get back what we have lost.'
'Draco...'
It was not for their ears.  It was for the boy who lay with Harry Potter, the boy tucked close to his body.  Warm, comfortable, safe.  Protected.
Despite the hazy recollections from that first night, Draco had never forgotten the way in which Hagrid had cared for him.  The way he had picked him up off the forest floor, gentle, caring when all he knew was pain.  Laid him down, covered his raw nakedness, got him warm, gone for help when he had been so far from saving.
'A fat lot of good that will do Draco.'  He turned his back on one of his oldest friends.  'Make an excuse for me, Neville.  Think of something to tell those vultures why I left.  Do you think you can do that for me?'
Warm.  Dry.  Clean.  Nothing to fear here.
'I...'  Harry starts, stops as soon as the breath leaves him.  He tries again, his voice whisper soft, Draco straining to catch each sound that Harry makes.  Every word fighting to be heard against the trickling noise of the running tap, the bath filled to the top, the forgotten water threatening to spill over.  'I couldn't sleep, not...  not without you there.  It didn't feel right anymore.   And... all I could do was think of you.'
'I want to.  If...if you'll let me?  If you would rather Madam Pomfrey?'
Surely she could leave them here a moment longer?   Would five more minutes make that much of a difference?  She could rise to her feet and usher everyone from the corridor.  She could patch the gaping hole in the wall that allowed the elements to swirl around the couple.  She could conjure blankets, perhaps even a fire.  Anything to grant them five more minutes.
Professor McGonagall would bring him books.  He still struggled over the words, letters swimming before his tired eyes.  So she had also taken up Harry's new hobby.  Reading to him.  Text books, not stories.  But Draco was more than grateful.  He didn't want the years spent in copious study to all be in vain.  He had to have something, had to have a plan in mind for his future.  Had to remember that he only had himself.
She had never seen such injuries on one person before.  Let alone on one so young.  It went without saying that the Death Eaters were notoriously cruel and savage in meting out their punishments.  But to do so on a child.  On one of her students.
'Neville...'
Draco couldn't help but think of that image on his mother's book.. So full of passion, so full of heated desire.  So unlike the kisses he had pressed to Harry.  'It wasn't perfect.  It won't ever be perfect.'  He replied bitterly.  'I want to give you everything, but it's already gone, and I have nothing left to replace it with.'
'Ah!  Draco, my boy.'  Slughorn turned, his voice on the high side.  'Come in, come in.'
'Just not your perfect ending.'  Neville said softly.  'I want you to be happy.  And I don't believe that you are.'
It would hurt, Draco had no doubt about that.  But really, how bad could it possibly be when comparing it to Cruciatus, or that spell that cracked his bones, or the one he had no name for, the one that licked flames over his naked body, his voice vanishing from all the screams ripped from his throat.  Or the pain of his body being torn into?  His thighs pressed open, hands holding him still.  A leering grin dripping saliva over his lips.
'Noise.'  Draco whispered to Harry, his fist curling weakly into the front of his robe.  'What..?'
'You can't force it.  It's going to take time.  A lot of time.'
'Your friends will have enough questions for you as it is.'  McGonagall told him.
'Thank you.'  Harry said, grateful beyond measure.  He knew he had neither the strength or the spirit to deal with the impertinent Lady.
His breath caught in his throat.  Panic squeezing his lungs.  Cold fingers of dread reaching into his chest, stealing what little air remained.
'No.'  He couldn't stop his eyes from falling to the blackness.  'I never have.'
And there she was, as he had expected. Sitting in the lamplight, the orange glow highlighting the concentration on her face, the tired lines around her eyes.  Piles of books surrounded her, unrolled parchment and several quills littered the space.  Scribbled notes and closed tomes.  There was a cup at her elbow.  Probably cold, she was always in the habit of forgetting her tea.
Harry lay him down, fussed with his covers.
'No.'  Draco shook his head back and forth.  'Please, Harry.  Don't...'
'No.'  Draco was absolute.  'To have someone see me, to have their hands on me, on my scars, it's more than I could bear.'
'I can wait, if you'd rather.'  Draco hesitated, looking back down the empty corridor he had just walked along.  Slughorn was nervous, and looked embarrassed to see him.  It might be for the best if he just stood outside and slipped in alongside the students who were moments from appearing.
'Come on, Draco.  Please.'  Harry begged, terrified that he couldn't get a response from the blond boy, his eyes staring, glassy and wet with tears.  Shaking hadn't helped, neither had the desperate kiss to his chilled forehead.
Getting to the door, reaching out his hand, Ron looked on as Malfoy tried for the handle, his grip slipping, like he had no strength in his too thin body.  Was he always so very thin?
'Are you sure?'  Harry knew him better.
A push away from the wall.  And a hand once again held in his.
'Draco doesn't need us, not now.'  Theo told them quietly, knotting the borrowed scarf tighter.
'Give me your scarf, Greg.'  He straightened himself, held out his hand in waiting.  'I can't be here a moment longer.'
'And what about Harry?  Do you believe he would want to be kept away?'  She spoke quietly, wanting Draco to see.
'Is it not the fault of all of his teachers?  We allowed this to happen.  He's a child, a child that was under my care.  And I let him slip away.'
Draco knew it wasn't fair to do this to Harry as he slept, oblivious to the world around him.
'It doesn't feel like it.'  Draco replied, he couldn't help the anger.  How could she ever truly understand?  She wasn't the one covered in memories.  She didn't have to look into a mirror and see the darkness looking back.
He watched as Madam Pomfrey pushed aside his stack of books, making room on the small table for the dark wooden bowl she carried.  He tried not to look, tried so hard not to focus on the thin plume of red smoke that spiralled into the air, curling round the curtains and drifting up towards the ceiling.  It was sharp, pungent in an unpleasant way.  Eucalyptus, and something stronger, earthy.  Dark.
'I was...  I just wanted to get away.' Harry told him, grasping for the right words.  'I didn't want to be around anyone.'  He cast his eyes down, pushing his hands into his pockets, pulling them out again.  Nervous energy making him twitchy.  'How...  How have you been?'
The early afternoon air rushed in, a swirling cacophony of noise and confusion filling the space that silence had taken.
Harry.  Back where he belonged.  Where Draco had begged him to return.
He could carry on.  He could quite easily ignore the hopeful faces that looked up at him, homework and games forgotten for the moment at his unexpected return.  He could put his head down, ignore them all, just as they had so easily done with Draco.
'No!  Draco...No.'  Harry was aghast at the idea.  'Please, Draco.  Sit down, please.'  His hands shaking, he slowly got Draco to the bed, sitting him on the edge.  Leaving him, stepping away.  'Is that what you think?  That I am only here because I want to make myself feel better about what I did to you, about how you almost died at the end of my wand?'  He turned away, scrubbing a rough hand over his face.  'I'm not good for you, Draco.  I'm no good at looking after you.'
'It was only a matter of time, Harry.'  Draco forced a dry smile for him.  'I was lucky that I got this long.'
The close memory was alive in his purpling bruises that he had to hide.  It was in the way Potter's green eyes had burned with an intense fury, unadulterated power and rage.  Pure and simple rage.  There was no doubt in his mind that Potter had intended to kill him.  And if it hadn't been for that red headed Weasley...
It was a Chocolate Frog card.
It would be gone by morning.  Harry had to make sure of it.  People would see, they would ask questions as to why there was a little space in the grounds that held all Draco needed.  The thought of this tangible link to the outside world vanishing from sight, to only become a memory, was more than his fragile soul was ready for.
'You can't.  You need to get back.  I'm okay.'  He tried to push Harry away, tried to extract himself from Harry's embrace.  He was too weak.
'You can't, can you.  Fucking Hell, Malfoy.  We were friends once.  You stayed at my house.  My own father treated you like his own!'  Nott snapped.  'And look where that has got him!  He's done nothing wrong, but still he's held prisoner in some grubby little room with a House Elf for company.  You did that, you and that disgusting teacher turned against us, spied on us and destroyed all we had.'
'It did.'  McGonagall nodded.  'To my great regret.'
Madam Pomfrey took in the sad scene.  Harry slumped in the hard, unforgiving chair, his head at an uncomfortable angle, the dropped book at his feet, pages of his treasured posession crumpled against the stone floor.
When you cared for them, bathed away all the fear and the terror that the night can bring.  What use was magic in a world like that?
Soon the hands would be back to hurt him, soon the wands would be drawn and he would be reduced to a screaming, sobbing mess.
Harry stared down at the glass that he had allowed to cut into his hand.  Imagined Draco, his Draco, pressing it deeply into his arm.  Unable to stop as the red of life flowed down his arm, pooling at his feet.  Cutting and cutting and cutting.  Until his arm was a ruin, until that blackest image was a blood soaked mess on the floor.
'How can I be strong for anyone when I can't even do it for myself?'
'Thank goodness.'  Hagrid exclaimed, leaning heavily on the wonky door frame.
'Where have you been these last few days Harry?'  Neville cocked his head at him, not allowing Harry the luxury of escape from his gaze.  'Because I know you have not been sleeping in your bed.  So where have you been?'
The lax body was carried into the Forest, there was nothing that could be done for him, nothing that would be done.  He was as good as dead.
The thought of finally leaving.  Walking out of those doors that held his true home was more surprising than he ever expected, his stomach dropping at the idea.  Could he do it?  Could he really leave this place forever?  Harry opened his mouth, his reply already on his lips.  There was no question.
'I...I can live with that.'
'We have the place to ourselves tonight, Draco, I swear.'  Harry jumped in before Draco could continue.  'I checked.  Everyone who stopped is spending the night with other people.  It's just us, just for tonight.'
For those split seconds, he had honestly believed that Harry was capable of hurting him.  He would have been justified.
'You are not there, Draco.'
'I knew Madam Pomfrey wouldn't be able to help.  I understood that from the start, but to actually have her tell me that nothing more could be done, it was harder to hear than I expected.  It felt like an ending, you know?'
'Harry?'  A soft voice asked for him.
What had he become?  A wizard, surrounded by power, consumed by it, but unable.  Useless.
Harry couldn't stay as he was examined.  Draco could not stand the thought of Harry seeing him like that, all laid out for him to see, not again.  Nowhere to hide in his own skin.  He had to beg him to leave, had to get through this alone.  He pushed him away, made him walk out of his room and not return.
'I was sick.  All over him.'  Draco admitted with shame.  'He just kept rubbing my back, he didn't mind.  Told me it was all right, that it didn't matter.  How can that not matter?'  He didn't wait for Hagrid's reply, forging ahead in his terrible tale of last night.  'He tore up one of his t-shirts, wrapped my arm up in it, just so I didn't have to look at what I have there.'  A sob ripped its way from his throat.  He covered his face, ashamed by the sound of despair.  'And...and after all t...that he...he still...still touches me.'
'Warm.'  Draco spoke, his eyes widening.
No, Harry could never see Draco as his enemy.  Not now, not ever again.
'Draco...'  Harry's body so close to his own, his lips a breath away.
He closed his eyes, a monster such as him didn't deserve the stars.
The person he had always thought of as his enemy had turned into someone else.  The blond boy who had been the bane of his life at Hogwarts was not the same one lying in Hagrid's bed.  This Draco was lost, alone in a world that had done him so very wrong.  Harry instantly thought back to that fateful day in the toilet block.  How different could things have been if Harry had acted in another way, If they both had?  With words instead of wands.  Would Draco still be here, sleeping fitfully, tossing and turning and mumbling incoherently?
A hush that grew, whispered words held behind hands soon became excited chatter thrown across the crowded space.  Tears still flowed, shock still etched on faces that had seen their own family in Draco's fears, but still the voices exploded all around them.
Hagrid was about to lock up.  It was late, and the night was cloudy and cold.  Fang's last walk for the night would not be a long one.  Just a quick wander through the nearest trees and he would turn in.  Put the kettle on and open his tin of ever present rock cakes.
'I'm not going anywhere.'
'It's late, they are all asleep.'  Harry took up his usual place on the hard wooden chair beside Draco's bed, pulled it in fractionally closer.  Madam Pomfrey had, on numerous occasions, offered to replace the chair with something more comfortable.  An offer Harry consistently refused.  Comfort might bring about sleep.  A luxury Harry could ill afford.
This was not like a dream.  This felt tangible. The water in his mouth, the kind hand on his hair, the soft voice that was full of worry.  It all felt so very real.
Once so full of love and understanding.  Gently words and soft hugs that he missed with an ache buried so deep.
'Daddy?'  Draco breathed, dropping to his knees in a heavy fall that surely hurt.
Casual conversations over the holidays had raised eyebrows.  The mention of the Malfoy name had shocked.  Surprise and the truth had turned over in his already confused mind.  Everything he had been told fitted in with how Malfoy was behaving.  It all made sense.  Finally.  He had to confront him, had to let Malfoy know that his secret was a secret no longer.
He watches as Harry parts his mouth, a word, perhaps two, three.  Trapped there, hanging in the half space, a fresh sadness that Harry cannot, will not speak aloud.  Draco feels his own lips part in answer, but nothing comes.  All he wishes to say vanishing in Harry's gaze.
'Thank you.'  Harry felt his voice tear up.
'You don't feel horrible.'  Harry's own face was damp.  'You...you feel like the only thing in my life that makes sense.'
Dipping, twisting and turning around imagined obstacles, subconsciously searching for a Snitch that had not been released, Harry was never more alive than when he was flying.  He could usually leave his problems on the ground.  Nothing but air under his feet, gravity a minor inconvenience.  But not tonight.
'Tell me you understand, Hermione.'  Harry begged.  'Please.  Tell me.'
But there was no other way.  Harry would never let him speak freely of their long, damaged past together.  He would never allow Draco to say sorry, the one word that Draco longed to say above all others.
'Can't...  I can't.  Harry, please.'  His tears ran down Harry's fingers.  'Don't let them.'
'Oh, he will.  I will not allow the pretty little thing to die quite yet, you can be sure of that.'  His mouth twisting cruelly.  'Do it again.'
Nott had waited, biding his time.  Allowed his own torment to control him until he got his chance.
McGonagall kept a step behind them, ever aware that should they need assistance, she would be close enough to stop a tumble or lend a helping hand should they trip.
'I was going through the books that had been taken from Dumbledore's office.  I guessed that if anyone would know about the spells of He Who Must Not Be Named, it would be him.  Turns out I was right.'  Holding out the book, she placed it into Madam Pomfrey's waiting hand.  'There are a lot of things written in that book I am sure Dumbledore never intended to see the light of day.  Spells that raise questions, questions that we shall have to ask Draco.'
'He is not a problem!'  Harry bit back angrily.  'It's everyone else with the problem.'
'You shoudn't get special treatment, Potter, despite what you have achieved.  But...  Be on your way and I won't inform a teacher.'
But there was a man who had stayed, who had not been scared of the person he had been before, of the person he was now.  Scars and pain and nightmares had not made him leave, it had only brought him closer.
'Why?'
'Thank you.'  Draco told him, beyond touched at Harry's thoughtfulness.  'But I...  My eyes, I...I can't focus on words at the m...moment.'
He could have coped with the arguments, the nasty words and the accusations.  Hell, perhaps he even deserved most of it.  He had lied to them, deceived them.  He had been that person, and more besides.
'I don't fucking care about him!'  Ron seethed, his arms rising, falling with a resounding slap against his sides.
'Hey, it's all right.'  Harry soothed, easing them both down to the bottom step.  'We can stay here a minute.'
Draco looked at Filch's arm for a moment before taking it gratefully without a word being passed between the unlikely pair.
'No.  It won't.  it's...It's all too horrible.  Please, Draco.  Can't...can't we just go?  I...I can't do this anymore.'
She knew, deep in her heart, that her time at Hogwarts was coming to an end.
He had told Harry that he would always be there.  Would always be a shoulder to cry upon. He had gone against his words, questioned him, thrown accusations without thought, without understanding.  His friendship in tatters, thrown away in a moment of unthinking naivety.
'It is my fervent wish that he will not.'  Professor McGonagall grimaced, feeling sick to her stomach.  'But in order for that to happen, we must continue.  Do you understand, Harry?'  At his barely imperceptible nod, she once again turned her attention to the beaten body of Draco.
'I broke your nose, I bullied Neville, stole his things, called one of your best friends the most despicable name ever.  Teased, picked on and generally made most of your friends lives a misery here.  Why should they forget about that?  I wouldn't.'
The world had fallen into silent.
'No...  He...he has to s...stay.'  Draco wept, clasping the mass of paper to his chest.
Draco wasn't expecting the slight tap at his door.  It set his heart pounding, froze his hands,  It was mealtime, by rights he would be alone for hours yet.  He owned no clock, the growing darkness outside his window served as his only timepiece.
'But you are not the same as them, and you never will be.  You alone brought peace to our world, only you could do that.  You will never be just a student, just that scruffy child, not anymore.  Bloody Hell, Harry, you are a Chocolate Frog Card!'  Draco couldn't help the little burst of laughter.
It had been six days since Hagrid's terrible discovery.  Six days of fear, blind terror and a burgeoning friendship that Harry was struggling to contemplate.
He didn't deserve her kindness, not after all he had done to Harry's fragile life.
'It is for the best.  In time he will realise that.'  He shook his head.
All he had was a book to hold, and a Chocolate Frog card to reminded him of shy laughter and pink cheeks.
He had all he needed for the night.  A small room, small bed, a chair, water, blankets, blazing candles that chased away the darkest of shadows, even a stack of books.  Gilderoy Lockhart grinning that insufferable grin from the top of the pile.  Clearly even Madam Pomfrey was not immune to his charms.  Draco wanted to reach out and turn the book over, to stop that face looking at him.  But he hadn't the strength.
'It is not power, money or fear that makes a life, Draco.'  She told him softly.  'And you would do well to remember that.'
And yet...  Here was Harry.
Madam Pomfrey had taken the hard decision not to try any further spells on Draco.  There was something at work on his body that she didn't understand.  The spells to heal him had helped somewhat.  But nowhere near to the extent that they should have.  He was still filled with pain, with shaking and trembling.
'It was nothing.'  Hagrid waved away Draco's words, concentrating on opening cupboards, pulling out a tin, setting biscuits on a plate, anything to keep from turning to the boy who nearly died in his bed all those months ago.
'I have to go.'  He blurted, clutching his bag to his chest, as if to shield himself from the crushing weight of the simple spell that flowed around him.  It prickled, it burned.  'I'm sorry.'
One he had walked out on.
She had known about him.  Girls talked.  Ginny talked.
He was hoping to slip away to Draco earlier tonight.  He figured that it wouldn't pose too much of a problem.  What with it being a yet another busy weekday full of homework and extra classes, his fellow students would likely be asleep in moments, allowing him to quietly exit out of the portrait hole and along the corridors to Draco's little bedroom.
'You are Draco Malfoy.  You will always be Draco Malfoy.  Nothing Voldemort or any of those bastards that did you wrong will ever be able to change that.  Your mother and father loved you very much, they would be so proud to see you now, knowing that you are a fighter, knowing that you made it.'
Harry didn't speak, couldn't find any words.  His hand turning in Draco's loose hold, lacing their fingers together.
Only Harry would not let him go, his hand tightening almost painfully.
'I...I can't close...my eyes.'
He didn't head in the direction of the Library, of course not.  But in the direction of the hospital wing, desperate to snatch a few minutes with Draco before the start of an afternoon of long classes and an even longer evening.
'My father is not in the past, Milly. Neither is Pansy.  She was your friend, and she cannot return.'
'Did he fuck you in here?'  A low voice whispered in his ear, turning his blood to ice.  'Did he push you up against his bottles of poison and fuck you?'  Nott's body so close to his own.
She turned back to Harry.  Everyone else could wait.
And done nothing.
White hot fury consumed him as he stepped through the silence, forced himself between Draco...  His own Draco, and the living nightmare.
'I do.  And it doesn't.'  Draco laced their fingers together once again, bringing Harry's hand to his mouth.  'This,' he kissed him.  'And you.  That is the only thing that matters now.'
'He can't.'  Harry told her.  He couldn't help but feel self-conscious by the way Draco held onto him, by the way he held Draco.  His cheeks flushed as he looked up at the woman who had cared for him multiple times during his childhood.  He cleared his throat, forcing down the embarrassment.  If Draco needed this, needed him, then he could have it, no matter who saw. 'He still doesn't dare close his eyes.'
She knew she had caught his eye as he quickly turned away from her searching gaze.  He pretended to be most interested in the book that lay upside down on his legs.
And Draco.  The Malfoy boy who was so sure of himself, even way back when he first walked through the imposing castle doors.  Bold and brash and oh so confident.  She hadn't taken to him, he was too much like his father before him.
'It may take some time, Potter.'  She made her voice carry across the attentive classroom.  'Don't expect him back for dinner.'  She addressed his friends, closing the door tightly behind them both.
'Harry, stop it.  Stop it now.  All this moping won't bring Draco back, and it certainly won't fix your friendship with your two best friends.  Ron and Hermione love you, Harry.  They want the best for you, and they are struggling to believe that Draco is that person.'
It wasn't real.
'What do you need, Draco.  Tell me what I can do?'
It had happened to the boy in the dust, alone and afraid and sodden in his own shame.  Ron had watched it all.  Raped and beaten and so lost.  Bruised and broken by all who had known him, by all who had done nothing to help.
He watched Hogwarts burn.  People running, trying to save dying students, dying teachers.  Everyone dying.
'Harry!'  Hermione was the first to launch herself at him, the door behind her gaping wide as a steady stream of students began to file inside the once empty room.  She rushed to him, her arms flung out, almost bowling him over in her haste.
'Draco...  No, not today, not after last night.'  There was panic in his voice, desperation.  Not there, not now.  Just the thought of Draco inside of that place again turned Harry's stomach into knots, he couldn't keep his peace over this.  It was too much to stand.  'I'll sort something out. Please.  Not there.  I...I don't want you going in there again.'
Vengeance. Against all who had ever hurt Draco.  Against anyone who had ever dared to call him names, and those that had stayed silent.  The people who had tortured him and beaten him and left him to die in the dirt.
Draco sobbed.  His own stupidity had caused this, not Voldemort, not Death Eaters, him.  His vanity, his haste, his desire for luxury.  He had ruined any chance at having something good, something worth holding onto.
'Just needed a moment.'  Harry looked up, his face drained and sallow.  'It's been hard, hasn't it.'
There had been too many deaths already.  Too many students lying unmoving on the ground.  Lives not yet lived snuffed out in a flash of green or a screamed curse.  Gone.  And now another.  A little blond boy.  A horror, sure.  One that had almost ended his newly founded career at Hogwarts, a boy that had almost gotten his beloved Buckbeak murdered.
'I'm right.  I know that.'  She wasn't accusing, or demanding an answer.  She did know.  Draco had to wonder what else she had managed to work out for herself.  He knew Harry would have kept his secrets.  'I'm not going to say anything, Draco.  I...  I've made my mistakes with Harry, and I can't put them right, he won't allow it.  Not that I blame him.  I was horrible to him.  And to you.'
'Neville!'  Harry exclaimed, simultaneously covering his nakedness with the fluffy towel and placing a hand over his thumping heart.  'You scared me half to death.  What the Hell are you doing in here?'
'She was crying.  She was sad for me.  I tried to talk, but He...He broke my jaw.  Then Father was there.  I...I didn't see him come in.  I was going home, they had come to get me.  My Mummy and Daddy had come to take me home.'
'How was Hogsmeade?'  Draco asked, moving uncomfortably, wanting to sit up to greet Harry properly.
He clawed his way back to the voice, the hand on his back finally bringing ease to his lungs.
There was a thirst about the damaged form, an ache so strong that there would never be salvation.  All the water in the world would never be enough to quench the drought that was slowly claiming his life.
And others.  All the others who waited on her next words, knowing that they would be forever changed by what she was about to say.  So many wet eyes, so much guilt.
'I...I don't.'
Dump him, leave him.  Let nature work its own special magic.  There would be no trace back to him this way.  Now, just the small matter of the boy's parents rotting in his celler.
And the blond boy who hadn't killed him.
'I...I think...'  Harry stuttered, turning his head away.  'I don't know.'  He finally admitted, fiddling with a dog-eared corner of his Transfiguration text book, he wouldn't meet her eyes.  'It doesn't matter, I'm fine.'
Let him take everything.
'I don't know.  He was hardly going to tell me, was he.'  Ron shrugged, as the feelings of guilt once again washed over him.  Malfoy had looked so ill.  He quickly shook the lingering thought from his tired head.  'Anyway, Harry wasn't with him.  That's the main thing.'  He reached over the table, spearing a sausage with the tip of his knife.
He could fight this, He would not let Him win.  Not again.  Never, ever again.
'He...he's here every night.'  Draco was powerless to stop his gasping sobs.  'He doesn't sleep.  He stays with me, all...all night.  Tell me...tell me he's all right.  Please.'
'Or he's gone.'  Hermione reached for Ron's hand under the table.  'He might...  He might have gone.  With Malfoy.'
'You could change your habit of a lifetime.'  She added, turning her attention back to her book, clearly Ron wanted to revel in his misery.
Hands on his shoulders, forcing him to wake.  Long moments of disorientation, a blurred face coming slowly into focus.  His little room, the school nurse leaning over him.  Another nightmare, another reason to not close his eyes.
'Have you thought about what you intend to do once you have finished with school?'  McGonagall asked conversationally, wanting to do something, anything, to get the silent boy to talk.
It raised an unexpected smile in him.  Perhaps one day, when he was able, he would take that path once again, the dust on his shoes, the tread of his feet.
'My...my mummy...  My daddy.'  Draco cried, his eyes closing.  'Fix them.'
She approached him slowly, the glass held in front of her body, as if to tempt him, a tool to tease, to barter with.  Draco knew he would do anything for this gift.  He would give them anything they asked of him for just a sip, a taste of the sweet liquid.  He had begged before, why should the sunlight, the hut change anything?
He hadn't killed, he hadn't struck anyone down.  It was proven.
McGonagall was right.  A wand didn't make him a Wizard.  He had always been one.
'It is my fear that should we send Draco to sleep, he will be unable to wake.'  Madam Pomfrey spoke gently. 'We are being as kind as we can.'  She sighed in frustrated resignation.  'There is little we can do to help with his pain.  I'm afraid that Draco will have to endure it.'
It wasn't real.
Run the taps, and made the voices fall silent.
'You told me, I didn't listen.'  Harry shook his head, pain building behind his eyes.  'Do you want me to go?  I'll understand if you want me to leave you alone.'
Harry had believed that he had already seen the worst humanity could achieve.  Tonight had proved him horribly wrong.
It was a bright morning, and Draco could hear Professor McGonagall moving around her little sitting room room.  The fire grew warmer, his blankets were tucked tighter around him, and he heard the soft scrape of a fresh water jug being placed on the table beside his head.
Harry was dimly aware of Draco's gentle hands guiding him down to the bed.  Covering him with blankets and settling in close beside him.
There it was.
'Look after yourself, Malfoy.'  His shoulders slumping, Harry backed away.
Two people stood in the doorway.  Professor McGonagall.  And Harry Potter.
Harry had caught the muddy confusion that ripped a hole in Draco's thoughts, the vacant, distant glitter to his eyes, the quick sting of fresh tears. He set the empty glass aside, his eyes burning as he watched Draco follow the path his hand took, knowing that all the water in the world would not slake the thirst of his dreams.
As it was, Draco did indeed jump.  He swallowed, hastily wiping the back of his hand over his mouth and spun around to face the intruder.
'No.'  Harry shook his head sadly.  'Not right now.'
Blinking away those tears, Draco turned his attention to his own battered book.
Of empty beds and empty arms.
Holding the glass to his lips, she made him sip the water slowly when all he wanted was to gulp it greedily down.  Sip after sip after sip.  She told him that his body wouldn't cope with huge amounts all at once.  It would make him sick, would undo the healing from last night if he was to vomit and tear his insides with the force.  Draco didn't give a damn.  It could tear his body into shreds for all he cared.  He needed the water, needed to feel it flood his mouth, soothe his ragged throat, bring him back to life.
'I'm sorry.'  He could already hear the growing threat of tears in her soft voice.  'I'm sorry for the way I reacted, for what I said to you.  It was wrong of me.'
Harry held it up, the water inside making the soft rubber bulge.  'Can I?'  He gestured to the bed.
'You need to be sitting down.'  Harry told him firmly.  'You have been on your feet for far too long, you look about ready to collapse.'
Harry didn't hear the door behind him opening, none of them did.
Two crackling wands were suddenly silent.
'Is it true?  Did you know?'  Theo turned to him, stunned to see quick tears pooling in his eyes.  'Tell me!'
'I have to.'  With shaky breath, Draco relinquished all control to Harry, slumping weakly in his arms.
'I like it.'
'What's happened, Draco?  Something is wrong.'
'There is nothing more that can be done, Draco.  They...they may fade, but you will always have them.'
'You can't.'  Harry felt tears against his cheeks, against his fingers.  'You are terrified.'
They arrived at the portrait of the Fat Lady, who looked slightly perturbed at being woken once again this eventful night.
'Aren't we all different now?'
Finally, the boy resting in his arms was warm.  Harry always felt a spark of fear through him whenever Draco was cold, whenever he could feel his body shaking.  It reminded him too sharply of those dark days in Hargrid's Hut.
'Yes, I am also aware of this.  He has agreed to some one on one lessons with me regarding this matter.'
'Mummy.  Mummy danced.  Father.  She...  They died, but they...they...'
'Thinking about dinner, more than likely.'  She snorted, bending down to begin retrieving the little glass shards.  'You have to concentrate.  This is a very complicated potion, and I cannot afford to mess up my grade because you are always hungry.'
'I want you to have this.'  Draco spoke, placing a small parcel in Harry's lap.  Wrapped in white tissue paper, pale blue string holding it all in place.  'It's old, I'm afraid.  I had no money to get you anything properly, but...but I wanted to give you something.'
'I...'  Draco faltered, eyes finding Harry.  'I don't know.'
He had done nothing as Draco had pulled away, his hands, his slight warmth, his soft kiss.  Leaving him.  He had closed his eyes as Draco had whispered his final parting, his name just a breath in the silence of their shelter.
'You do not need to open it tonight, Draco.  You don't need to even think about it until you are ready, whenever that may be.'  She pushed on the door to the Gryffindor bedroom.
'Harry...  Don't.'
'Go on, off with you.'  He dismissed Harry with a wave, waiting to watch him depart down the corridor.
'Metal.'  Draco told him, his head falling back against the pillows, his eyes closing against his will.  'They...they kept me chained to the wall.  Unlocked me when they wanted to take their fun.'  He felt the rage coursing through Harry's body, making the water jug shake.  It was that strong.  'They t...told me that if I was good, if I did what they wanted, they would take the cuffs off.  So I did.  I did what they asked.  But...but they lied to me.  So tight.  They kept them so tight.'  Draco's hands trembled.  'I...I couldn't escape.'  Tears escaped from under his eyelids, trickling down his face.
The only thing that mattered to the trembling boy was to get as far away from Potter's madness as possible.
'Will you read to me?'  Draco asked after a heartbeat had passed between them.  'Like you used to.'
He would never, ever admit it in words.  But it was there.  The pain of seeing his broken brother at the breakfast table each and every morning had become a pain that he was struggling to bear.
'It's not morning yet.'  Through the crack in the curtains, Harry could see the break in the darkness, the threat of daylight on the horizon.  But there was still time.  'Five minutes more.'
Her reaction shamed her.
Draco's book, the one he had carried around, the one with a picture of Harry pressed safely between the pages.
One he knew, one that would always haunt his dreams.
He was warm, dry, clean, dressed in the softest pajamas that Madam Pomfrey could find.
'Is that wise?  We cannot know what performing magic will do to him.'
Hagrid could not keep his feet still.  He paced the floor, unable to settle in one place.  Eventually he took himself outside, not wanting to fully realise that there was a very sick student flitting in and out of consciousness in his house.  It was too terrible for the giant to contemplate.  Fang stayed close to him, not understanding why there were so many people in his home.
'Oh.  I didn't think.  Stupid of me.'
His home felt different now.  It was no longer the sanctuary he had always known.  It was now a place where a young man suffered untold agony, brought on by an evil that they all believed had been eradicated.
It had made him blush, even then.
'I'm not so sure.'  Hermione smiled at him, sweet and kind.  She touched his arm, and it was all Draco could do to still his own hand, to not grasp hers and never let go.  'I am sorry, Draco.  I am sorry for Harry, and for whatever has happened to you.'  Her voice dropped as her hand squeezed gently.  'It's bad, isn't it?'
He became accustomed to it over time.  Time.  It didn't seem to matter down there, amongst the filth, the fear.  It could be morning, late night.  It made no difference.  The boy still cried, still bled over the stones.  Still begged for salvation.
'Where?'
Luck was on his side tonight, and he smiled as it turned easily.  Some nights it would stick fast and refuse to yield, making his stomach drop and his eyes prickle.  Stupid really, how this silly rubber bottle had come to mean so much, to stand for so much.
'Yes.  Harry, I'm...'
'Does that name make you such a terrible person?'  She asked carefully, taking his hand gently when he couldn't answer her.  'You are also Draco.'
They couldn't hear him.  No matter how much he cried out, sobbed, begged.  They were oblivious to his terror.  The darkness was all around him, all over his body.  He couldn't wake.
Ginny was with Dean, and appeared to be happy.  They both did.  Going to lessons hand in hand, sitting closely together in the evenings.  Should anyone be in the mind to try, they would struggle to slide a piece of parchment between them.
'I remember.'
'He wasn't.'
In Draco's dream the sound of a door opening brought in the night.  And voices.  The same rough one from before, but there was another one, a softer one.  A voice that he knew well.  The name of the owner escaped him. He tried to grasp hold of it, but it slipped through his memory like liquid, impossible to hold on to.
'You make me feel safe.'  Draco sighed, admitting his closely guarded secret, one he had carried throughout his years.  'You always have.'
'It has always been too late.'  Harry allowed a grin to escape, his huff of laughter tickling Draco's lips.  'You and me...  I see it now.  I understand.  This...this is how it always was.'  He felt Draco's fingers tighten almost painfully in his hair.  'I'm not running, Draco.  I'll never run.'
He sobbed.  Great wracking shudders that shook his body, made his healing ribs ache.  He wasn't in that Cell.  He wasn't being held under spells that ripped his body in two, that burned him inside, and promised only death.  He was back at his school.
It sickened him to think in this way, but...  The rapes were almost a blessing in the darkness.
'I never said that!'  Hermione almost squeaked, her hand turning to Ron and delivering the same weak slap that Harry had received.  'I was just thinking about you and him, stuck here together for the whole of Christmas.  It must have been horrible.'
Harry tore them away, sending the infernal glasses flying across the room with a furious throw.  He let his weight drag him to the floor, his back pressing uncomfortably against the filling bath.
He had realised it back then, before anything else, that he would remain chaste.
And spun a web of lies to cover his cowardly back.
He couldn't risk waking Harry, it wasn't time.
Harry kept his voice low, but it was no use, he felt the magic under him, seeping into his back.  The warmth, the slight vibration.  He wanted to scream.  And then it was done, the wand quickly pushed away, shut in a draw for safe keeping.
Ron looked over, his mouth opening, closing.  Thinking of speaking to his best friend.  His face dropping as he realised painfully that his conversation was not wanted, and may never be wanted again.  Harry's heart twisted at the sight, as Draco's words came back to him.  'It's not his fault.'  And he was right.  He had been right all along.
Those hands that held him down had nothing to do with want, with desire.  With love.
'You can, you have to, Harry.  I know it's not fair, you're right, it is horrible.  But listen to me, you can do this, you can get through anything.'  Draco soothed, his fingers combing through Harry's tangled hair.  'Did you find him?  Ron?'
'No one can get you.'
That wand.  That object of power that was his.  McGonagall and her words, telling him, asking him.  It was his, it would only ever be his.  Only...  Only he was too stupid, too weak to reach out, too pathetic to take what was rightfully his.  He could still feel it now.  Waiting.
'I'd stay with you every night, if you'd have me.'
His Draco.
Draco was held down by soft blankets that had once offered comfort.  He had kicked them down the bottom of his tiny bed, his nightmare ravaged mind turning his body against him.  Now they served as ropes, his ankles impossibly twisted, pinning his thin legs to the mattress.  All the thrashing, the pleading, would not release him from his bonds.
At least...  Ron paused, guilt, shame and remorse fighting for attention.  At least Malfoy had stopped hurting himself.
'No need for that.'  He waved him inside.  'I have been meaning to visit you...'  He stuttered for a suitable explanation, one that didn't sound so false.  'Professor McGonagall told me you were taking a few days rest from classes, and I was going to come see you...  It's just...  Well, it's been a busy time, what with...'
She saw him raise a barbed whip already crusted with blood.  Flecks of wet red splashed across his familiar cheeks.  Cheeks she had once kissed goodnight.  His thin lips curling into an unsparing mockery of a smile as the lash came crashing down.  Over and over.  And over again.
There was a shyness to his touch, a slight press, his lips parting each time, before pulling away, only to return again and again.  Harry sat, still as a stone statue, allowing Draco to control every part of this.  There was no reason to rush, no need to surge forward and claim Draco's lips for his own.  They had all the time in the world.
'Oh, right.  Yes.'  Draco managed to control the quaver in his voice.  'I...  Sorry.'  He was quick to apologise to the stern Librarian, she was not one to be taken lightly after all.  To fall foul of her...
All it would take was a twist of the handle, a step to the side, and the full force of Malfoy's ultimate humiliation would be unleashed to the school.
He woke gasping, couldn't breath.
'No.  It's okay, just a little sore.  Don't...don't stop.'  He could hear himself begging.  Ashamed by the note of desperation in his voice.
'I left before word got around.  But by now, yes.  They will all know.'
'He's been through so much, Ron.  Too much.'
Hands that tried to be careful raked fire down his back.  He gasped in agony as the hands held him upright, as they rubbed gently between his raw shoulder blades.  He cried, trying to fight for a breath that just wouldn't come.  In out, in out, a voice instructed, kind, understanding.  A woman.  That was new, strange.  His visitors were almost always male.  And never, ever had they been kind before.
Or, she could tell them nothing.
With a heavy heart, Harry turned his back on the Potions doorway and headed in the opposite direction.
But...  Tonight, and hearing that name, Draco Malfoy.
It wasn't a great surprise that Harry was awake and out of bed.  It had been a regular sight in the past, he had always been up to something.  But Neville had believed those days were long gone.  Perhaps he was only paying a visit to the toilet.  But he didn't appear to be headed in that direction, pushing his feet into slippers, shrugging on his dressing gown, reaching for his wand and glasses.  This was not a quick trip to answer a call of nature.
Only...  No.  It had changed.  There was a boy, a man, where the monster had stood moments before.
Could he tell her?  The Headmistress who had been so good to him when anyone else would have turned their back.  Would he even be able find the words for all that he and Harry had shared?
Draco knew that if he didn't force his feet to move now, they never would.  He would be trapped here, in the middle of a crowd of rowdy, confused Gryffindor students.  People who hated him, people who would soon grasp that he was the sole person to blame for the divide in the eternal friendship between Harry and Ron.
'You never will.'
There had been one other.  A single kiss he dared not think of.  A kiss that was only ever friendship, a helping hand, a kiss to make him realise.  To help him understand, finally, who he was and what he really wanted.
Old cuts covered his chest and sunken stomach, indistinct words carved crudely into the soft skin.  Black bruises and welts snaked up his thighs, more fingermarks on his hips, digging deeply into the vulnerable flesh, dried blood crusting between his legs.
He didn't stop his hand from reaching out to touch him, his fingertips ghosting over tired features.
That did it.  That tiny declaration fractured Harry's will.  His feet leading him to the bed, into Draco's waiting embrace.
'Is he sleeping yet?'  Madam Pomfrey leaned over them, talking to Harry.
'It doesn't count.'  Harry stilled him, his fist curling in the fabric of Draco's pyjamas.
He had been expecting this day to come, wishing, hoping that he had more time, time to get his head around it, time to come up with a string of excuses.  But no.  The day had finally arrived.  He waited for her to speak again, closing his eyes.  His mouth as dry as old parchment.
Draco paused, his eyes flicking up to her kind face and back down to the drink he held tightly in his hands.  She was right, it was indeed warming him up.
Draco would already be inside.  He would be sitting right at the back of the room, where he could keep his head bowed, fingers wrapped around a quill he would struggle to use.  Taking scratchy notes that once read back would make no sense.  Fetching ingredients he couldn't use, trying to read from books that he could no longer comprehend.
On the way that he had looked up at him after Slughorn had sloped off and Harry had closed the door firmly behind him.  All huge wet eyes, full of apprehension and hope.  Hope that Harry had meant every single word.
'Yes, and I can't get the image of you in there from my mind whenever I step inside.  I don't want that for you.  Hagrid understands, he knows why you haven't been.'  Harry picked up Draco's hand unconsciously.  It had become as automatic as breathing.
'I am a Malfoy.'  Draco whispered to her, his head dipping.  'I will always be a Malfoy.'
'What can't you have?'
'I'm not going to change my mind about this.'  He could not allow himself to be swayed, this was too important.  'I need to get back to my schooling, I need to start moving on from what has happened.  And if that means being on my own, then so be it.'
Draco turned to him, watching as a flush rose around his throat.  Yes.  It was true.  He did allow Harry all of those things.  He wanted Harry beside him, stroking him, murmuring nonsense, taking away all the pain and fear that had grown in those last terrible months.
Snape would never...  It was inconceivable, disgusting.  Sex.  Not with him, never with him.  The sex, the rape had been under Nott's own father.  He had dined at the man's table.  Had eaten off his plates, drunk from his cups.
The duo parted at the grand entrance doors.  Harry nodded briefly at his Headmistress, not even trying to attempt a smile.  He turned to head off in the direction of Gryffindor Tower.
Begging for the drops of water that one of the men would sometimes produce with his wand, making puddles on that very same floor, watching over him as he lapped at the fluid, desperate.
'Yes.'  Harry nodded.  He wanted to sit, wanted to take up Draco's hands and lend him some warmth, some safety that had been taken from him yet again.  But he couldn't, the sting of what he had said to Neville heavy in his chest.
'Ssh.'  She glanced around the empty room, the sound of Ron's quick anger echoing across the space, reverberating off the bookcases.  'I had to get special permission to be here this late, you'll have Filch storming in here in a minute.'
Draco knew, deep down, that Harry had to be the one to leave in order for that to happen.  He would have to push him away, bit by bit, until Harry himself would not realise what he was doing.  Until it was all too late.
An ownership that transcended death.
'How was this allowed to happen?  How did we all fail him so very badly?'  The headmistress asked her friend.  'How did we not see?'
'Minerva, oh my dear Minerva, tell me, tell me what can be done?'  The Fat Lady clutched her hands to her breast.  'Anything.  I would like to be of some use.'
'No...Please.'
Even his own parents couldn't offer him that.  Ever.  The thought sickened him, how could he think like that?  They were his parents, they had loved him, they had tried their very best.  They were meant to protect him from all of that darkness, all of the pain.
'Perhaps I deserve that.'  Theo told her, stepping forward to face Potter's wrath.  'Perhaps we all do.'
That in itself was a lie, they had so many more steps to take that she had to wonder if it was asking too much of the tortured, broken child.
Draco's body betrayed him, leaning closer to Harry despite himself.  'There are always going to be nightmares.  There will always be a reason not to visit his hut.  You still go in there.'  Draco added softly, knowing that Harry would always keep his visits to Hagrid from him.
The walk back to Draco's room was taken with a heavy heart.  Draco didn't want to leave the beautiful place that Harry had so thoughtfully made.  Just for him, for them.
'No.'  Harry tightened his careful hold.  'There isn't.'  Malfoy, he was holding Malfoy.  The fragile body in his arms gently shivering.  'It's been overcast all day.  Even the friendly Quidditch match was called off.  Too much chance of rain, according to the Hufflepuff team.'  He laughed softly.  'After the War, people have gotten soft.'
'Perhaps I've decided to take back a little control.'  He told them all cryptically.  'Perhaps it's now time for a little well executed payback.'
Now she danced in broken shoes and torn skirts.
He had to stop, just for a moment.  Just to get his thoughts in some semblance of order before he went to Draco.  Head pressed against the cool stone, the hallway mercifully dim after the aching light in the Hall.  His hands trembled with rage.  It wouldn't do to go to Draco in this state.  He had to be calm, had to be strong.  Had to tell Draco the devastating news.
'Lie back for me, sweetheart.'  She was standing by the bed, leaning over him, her hands reaching towards him.  His mind beginning to stray as she bent forwards.
'Almost done.'  He told him, touching his face gently, stroking his fingers over Draco's streaming eyes.  'You will be able to sleep soon.'
'But Draco hiding from him in a solitary room in the castle will not help matters, it will make them worse.'
'Do you honestly believe that I would leave you?'  Harry cocked his head.  'You may not want to tell me what's wrong, but that doesn't mean I'm going to just walk out.  I don't have to know everything, Draco.  You are allowed your secrets.'  He smiled softly.  'There is something I want to show you.  Are you up to walking?'
'I thought that perhaps you might like to read them?'  Harry spoke, finally breaking their easy silence.  'While you are stuck in this room.'
'Ssh.'  Harry whispered into his ear, his hand tight in his hair.  'It's going to be all right, you are safe here.'
Hagrid stood in front of the closed door to the hut.  It was his home, he shouldn't be afraid.  But still his hand paused, fist ready, but unwilling, to knock against the wood.
A string of pearls dipping low over her wasted breast.
What could anyone say that Harry would care about?  He had Draco.  Had him so completely that nothing else would ever be important again.
How he wished he remained in the dark.  Those words that Harry had used, each and every one more terrible than the first, echoing around his head.  He knew he would never forget them.  Why did he ask?  Why had he pushed at Harry so, forcing him to tell everything.  After all this time, why shouldn't Harry do as he pleased?
With a speed that belied his size, Hagrid wrenched the door open and took off to the castle at a sprint, Fang close to his heels.
'Fred, George.'  Harry told him, sadness in his words.  It wasn't often he spoke Fred's name out loud.  'They gave it to me.'  He swallowed heavily, not wanting to burden Draco with his own upset.  'I thought it might be useful tonight.'
'Several.'  Draco told him honestly, quickly, his hands twisting in his lap.  'I...I didn't count.'
No, it wasn't then.  He was so muddled.  When had the screaming started?  He was so thirsty.  When had the dark place changed?
'It belonged to my father.'  Harry told him softly.  'It is all I have of him.  Apart from some pictures.  I...I thought you might like to hang onto it for a while?'
From the sidelines she had watched him grow, his life in constant danger.  Looked on without a voice when he had to die, when he had to kill.
Someone started to scream.
He hadn't killed Albus, he didn't need thinking over.  The child was gone, maybe that was a good thing.
'I'm sorry I couldn't help you.  I...I didn't know you were there.  I'd...I'd have looked for you, I swear it.'  Harry held him close, panic setting in.  'I wish I could kill him all over again, make him suffer, make him feel everything.  It was too quick.  Please, Draco, come back to me.'
'I've had it for years, found it in the bottom of my trunk.'  Harry sat on the hard chair placed beside Draco's bed.  His eyes falling on Lockharts book.  'Oh, I can't be looking at his bloody face.'  He instantly turned the book over.  Draco had to smile.
'If that is what Draco wants and needs right now, then we shall have to do as he asks.  His shelter is my only concern, Poppy.  The boy cannot go out into a world where people will only treat him with contempt.  He is the son of a Death Eater, a Malfoy.  And the past is not so easily forgotten.  The Wizarding World will not look upon him kindly.'
'It's not enough.' Harry's voice hollow in the growing panic that had begun to rise around them, someone was crying out his name.  Harry blocked it all out.  What did it matter now.  Hadn't he given them everything they ever wished?  Hadn't he already lost everything to Voldemort's insanity?  'It will never be enough.'
'Draco is not the one to blame.'  Greg spoke softly, his gaze on the stained table.
Nothing much.  The words reverberated around Draco's head.
'Oh, I think we can do better than that.'  She smiled softly, going over to a silver jug placed beside the fire.  After a few whispered words, she was pouring sweet, dark hot chocolate into two heavy mugs. 'This will do you the world of good, Draco.  Wrap your hands around it, it will warm you up quicker than anything.'
Watching him leave the room had stretched every nerve in Draco's tired, broken body.  He wanted him back, desperate to cry out for him not to leave. He wanted the stories and the gentle hand holding.  Wanted Harry to touch him, protect him from the whispering in his head.  The voice that patiently waiting for the darkness, for the loneliness to descend.
He could do it.  He wouldn't, Draco at least knew that much.  But he could.
'Thank you.'  Draco's voice dragged him from his memories.  'For this.'
'Yeah, probably because he thinks I did it on purpose.'  Harry continued to seethe.  'He said it himself, we don't even like each other.  He must think I did it out of some twisted form of revenge.  I should go back, leave him be.  It clearly would be better for him.'
'We need to get you back to the castle.'  Madam Pomfrey stepped forward.  'You are not well, Draco.'
'They...they danced.'  Draco gasped, sobs roughly gripping his chest, his blunt fingertips digging into Harry's back.  'I...I can see them.'
Their kiss had sealed Harry's fate.
Guided gently by this Neville, Harry was made to sit as they set about their task with unbridled glee.
'You don't!'  Draco snapped, rising quickly, the chair toppling to the floor with dizzying a crash.  Anything to be as far away from that wand as possible.  It wasn't his, it could never be his.  No wand ever would.  'You don't know what it was like, you can't ever know that!'
So many memories.
His mother's words, along with her sad smile, had come back to haunt him more than once in his Cell.
Potions, poisons, spells and curses.  Steps out of top towers and drops into deep water.  He had grown up surrounded by the darkness, the murmurs of others, of acts carried out willingly by the desperate.  He was never blind to the possibility.
He washed, dressed.  Looking into the mirror above the bathroom sink he saw someone old looking back out at him, someone he struggled to recognise.  Tiredness made his skin grey, his eyes haunted by fresh horrors.  He had to get moving, had to go down and pretend that all was well, that he hadn't spent the night crying over Draco's poor body.  They wouldn't understand, his friends.  They would never understand why he had felt the need to spend the night by Draco's side, why he was desperate to return to him.
'Will...will you stay with me tonight?'  Draco murmured, not trusting his voice.
'Look, I'll go get Harry.'
'Don't.  Don't you dare.'  Harry was the one to stop it, to stop the threat that his friend now posed towards Draco.  He pushed himself forward, making sure to shield Draco from anything that might be cast his way.  Draco wasn't to be touched, to be hurt.  Whatever the cost.
'Draco, please!'  A soft shake, a warm kiss.  'You have to fight this.'
'It...  It was Vold...'  The name caught in his throat and closed around it.
He didn't care about the noise his bare feet made against the stone floor, the cold seeping into his toes, or the fact that Mrs Norris could be lying in wait around the next corner.  So what if points were lost?  So what if Gryffindor came last?
'But what?'
And in silence he crept from the castle.
'We can take Draco someplace safe, the hospital wing.'  She soothed.  'Where he can be...'
'Come on, there is something else I want to show you.'  Without pause, Harry picked up Draco's hand, leading him slowly away from the open door.
'I heard you.  All right.  I fucking heard you.'  Ron moved, all of a sudden up on his feet, his knees catching the edge of the board.  Pieces crashed to the floor in splintering fragments of pottery.  He hadn't meant it, not really.  But there was something undeniably satisfying in seeing all of those crafted forms in bits, spread out across the floor.
'No...Please, don't.'  Draco shook his head.  'I...I can't.'  His voice still so very scratchy.  It pained him to talk, but he had no choice, they had to know.  He couldn't close his eyes, didn't they realise that it would only take him back?
The boy from the platform, the neglected child with the sweets and the white owl.  The boy he had gone through school with, argued and laughed with.  They had fought trolls and shared their secrets.  Spells and books and homework, quiet games of chess.  Embarrassing knitted jumpers and Christmas presents.  Quidditch and grief and so much more.
He hadn't been lying, he had wanted to stay there.  Forever.
Theo closed his streaming eyes on the fear, the pain and the betrayal.
'I can't do it.'  Harry slipped through the curtains.
'You'll see.  Things have a way of working out, it just takes time, that's all.'
That bloody Boggart.  It had conjured up Harry's deepest, darkest fear and exposed it before the world.
'Seamus, for goodness sake!'  Even the mild mannered Neville couldn't help his voice rising in pitch.
That familiar face blinking up at him owlishly from behind glasses he had never been without.  His scar prominent, his eyes verdant and full of surprise.
The realisation still didn't stop his legs from failing, it didn't stop him dropping to the floor as he blindly raised his wand into the crushing silence.  Pointing it at the boy he loved.
There were no china cups, no steaming pot full to the brim with Draco's favourite tea, no plate of tempting treats to encourage him to eat.
'T...  Thank you.'
The lid was heavier than he remembered, only able to open at his hands, but then he wasn't the same boy who had lifted it all those long months ago.  Nervous longing coiled in his stomach, just the very thought that he would now be able to touch a small part of his former life, to claw back a little piece of himself.
'I made him drink it.  He...he only did it because I asked him to.'  He scrubbed his hand over his brimming eyes.  'He knew what it would do to him.  He begged me not to make him.  I...I did this, Draco doesn't need me to do this to him.  He doesn't need me at all.'
He trailed his hand down, brushed Harry's damp eyelashes, cupped his tear streaked face.  'You cannot leave the people you love.'  His thumb uselessly wiping away the tears that could not be stopped.
'Ron...'
But for all that, for all that it was over, for all that she could put it to the back of her mind each morning, she never thought she would have to listen to another ear shattering explosion, screaming children and breaking glass.  She never thought she would be forced to walk around another corner, her steps slow, her wand clasped tightly in her trembling hand, and see the sight of a boy on the floor in a cold corridor that spoke of the War.
He could focus on the words now.  The crisp black ink no longer swam before his eyes in a muddle of letters and smeared blotches.  He could read for himself.  It took time, patience, his eyesight might never be what it was, but he could certainly read the book for himself.
'But I am afraid that I cannot tell you this.'  She took a breath before continuing.  'What Mr Malfoy was forced into witnessing was very real.  What you all saw when that Boggart was released from the cupboard in which it was placed, did in fact happen to Mr Malfoy.'
'I am not a kind person.'  Draco told him.  'If I was, I would let you go.'
Draco could not look at Slytherin.  The small group clustered at the end of the table, muttering under their breath about his limp, his scruffy hair, his dark shadows.  There was uncertainty behind those calculating eyes that lit on him throughout the meal.  They knew that something was very wrong with their erstwhile Housemate.
'You are helping.'  Draco admitted.  'Just b...being here is...is enough.'
Neville slumped down on his bed, his shoulders hunched over, his eyes damp, his heart still thumping.  He could do no more than stare at the empty space before him where Harry used to sleep through the night.
He had been taken back too far.  He hadn't been ready for the intense questions, imploring him to remember.
Roaring around the castle grounds, Harry clung to his broom, his hands little more than blocks of ice.  Rain lashing down, wind threatening to tip him from the thin strip of wood clamped firmly between his thighs.
'Bed.'  Harry whispered to him, the implication heavy in the air.
The words would stick in his throat, choking him with their cruelty.
And then it all fell into place.
'Draco would tell you otherwise.'  She told him kindly, well aware that Harry was not himself.  He was tired, angry and frightened.
Sure, he had watched, they all had.  It was part of the punishment.  Part of his Lord's fun.  Watch and learn, see what was sure to become of you should you fall out of line, should you dared to cross, to turn from the righteous path.
'You are good enough for me.'  Harry blushed, adding another kiss to Draco's hair.  'More than good enough.'
He thought he had wanted this, the outside, the cleansing air, the great wide world.  But now when he had it before him all he wanted was his little room.
School was to begin again for him tomorrow.  Bright and early.  He didn't like to think about the reaction from the other Houses, from his own House.  He knew that Slytherins didn't take too kindly to desertion, to feeling betrayed.
'Draco?'  The bed dipped once more under Harry's weight.  'It's me again.'  His hand shook as it hovered over Draco's hair.  'Harry.'
'Only.'  Draco coughed, fighting the urge to gag at the memories, at the images that were never far away.
'Of course.'  Hermione needlessly answered her boyfriend, reaching out for his hand.  'Harry, where do you want to go?  You missed out last time.'  She twisted her head in Harry's direction, back where he walked in tandem with Neville.  He remained silent, no idea that he had been spoken to, his eyes fixed on the motion of placing one foot in front of the other.  'Harry?'  A frowning Hermione still received no answer.
'Draco doesn't hate you, Harry.'  She patted his arm.  'I don't believe that he ever has.'
'I'm sorry for everything I have done to you, now and before.  Every horrible word, every nasty comment.  I was so cruel to you.'  Draco could feel his tears welling.  'I'm sorry for my Father, my Mother, my entire family.  They all hurt you, I hurt you.  I hurt everyone.  There is no good in me, there never has been.  All that you have done for me...  I'm sorry.'  He swallowed thickly, stopping the sobs that begged to be set free.
'Don't you remember Fred dying?'  Neville spoke calmly, a contained anger bubbling behind his eyes.
She could tell Draco's story in all it's vivid colour.
'It turns out that he and Harry's friendship has progressed somewhat.'  She told her friend as they left Draco to his sleep upon the fireside sofa.
There was nothing dream like about being asleep, about being so tired that it was hopeless to fight against the sickening tug towards that dark place.
'It was okay.  I...I'd rather be here though.'  Harry admitted, looking down at the pale arm resting in his lap.
'I don't believe that.'  Draco tucked himself closer to Harry's side, sensing his sadness.  He wanted to do nothing more than comfort him, he looked that miserable.
Harry heard the words, caught the excitement in Seamus' voice, the eager eyes that were all all turned in the Irish boy's direction.  Slytherin.  Missing.  The bottom of his carefully constructed little world fell away.  Leaving a great, gaping hole where all his secrets, all his dreams spiraled into.  The heavy stone of his heart thrummed horribly, churned his stomach, turned the blood in his veins to ice.
'Don't try to speak.  You need to save your strength.'
'There isn't a normal anymore.'  The headmistress put a hand on Harry's trembling shoulder.  'What has been done to Draco is abhorrent, I cannot comprehend it, I do not think I want to.'  She shook her head sadly.  'There are no answers in any of this, Harry.  The War, the deaths, the destruction.  What has happened to Draco.  There are no words that will make it better.  We just have to keep on living, trying to make the best of it.'
