“Well, yeah.” He seemed to blush a bit, and seeing Harry both giggle and blush did things to my stomach that made me feel both sick and elated. “So ask away!”
That night, after he had nursed his wounds and erected every safety ward he knew outside his bedroom door, Draco felt safe enough to examine the memories.
For the first time in months Draco cried. He cried with joy, knowing that there was someone out there that he loved, someone who
Harry gently laid down his husband to their bed without breaking their kiss, but Draco was not happy with taking it slow. He practically ripped Harry’s shirt off, causing his glassed to fly away and managed to get his on t-shirt off with Harry’s help. He grabbed Harry by his hair and crushed their lips together in a frantic kiss, rolling them both over so Draco was straddling Harry.
I made my way back to my room and got into bed, even though I knew I wouldn’t be sleeping any time soon. All I thought about was Harry, his touch, his hugs, that kiss. The way he looked at me, how he smiled.
His words were my undoing. I buried my face in his glorious hair and came. The orgasm hit me so hard I’m sure I blacked out, but I could hear Harry groaning my name as he came too.
When Pansy started riffling through my underwear I snapped my tether. I practically launched myself through the room and slammed that drawer shut.
“That’s a great idea, you guys know I can’t write a proper Transfiguration paper if I’m not buzzed” Blaise said, making Pansy laugh.
I groaned at the touch and fisted his hair in my fist, and started kissing him like I had never kissed anyone. He tugged me towards him and a second later I was straddling him and pouring myself into our kiss. When he separated from me gasping I started kissing him along his jaw – nipping, biting and licking my way down his throat. His hands flew to my hips and grabbed my arse cheeks and squeezed and I couldn’t help the mewl that escaped my throat.
, how it would all be his fault, he would never be able to forgive himself, no one would, Harry’s face of distrust blooming in his mind eye, him raising his wand at Draco and Draco couldn’t, wouldn’t do anything, not to
Draco closed his eyes to enjoy the foot rub for a few seconds, then opened his eyes and stared at Harry, his exhaustion palpable in his expression.
“Yeah he was, we only went out to muggle clubs, cause you know, all the media thing. None of us felt comfortable being followed around by journalists and photographers.”
“No, Hermione did just fine. It was… the memories came back a few months ago.” Draco said quietly, not quite ready on talking about how they came back.
I knew he would be fit, of course I did how could Harry Potter not be fit, but – wow. There was a difference between my imagination and the pure, unadulterated reality of his perfect body, which looked like it had been sculpted from marble. His back was wide and muscled, his shoulders looked strong and gave me the feeling he could easily pick me up and toss me around. His legs were beautifully defined, and looked to be made of solid muscle and his arse – fuck, that arse – I wanted to bury myself in it and never leave.
He turned to look at Ron, expecting to see the same look of shock and confusion in his eyes, but Harry was again stunned to see Ron not only look almost
“You guys are improving so much, I’m very happy with your progress.” Beamed Linda, the Sign Language teacher the Ministry was paying to teach Draco Malfoy how to sign.
Under Harry’s touch Draco felt safer, but it still took a while for his panic attack to fade. He tried to slow his breaths as he tried not to think too much on why Harry was here in the first place. Was he here to ask Draco to leave, to go back? Would he wish for Draco to return to his sure death? Draco gasped and tried to force his mind away from that line of thought.
Harry just stared after him with his mouth slightly open and finally turned to me. “Is your nickname Mr D?” He asked me, surprising me too – was that really the first question he had for me?
“That was quite the dramatic entrance you made” he whispered at me, giggling madly. “And a dramatic exit too, actually.”
I went back to those delicious lips and licked my way into his mouth again as we started slowly grinding together. My cock was achingly hard and protesting against my pants, but feeling Harry’s hardness against my hip made it all worth it. I broke our kiss just to sit up against him. I stared into his face as I re-positioned myself against him so we were perfectly lined up, and watched him groan deeply as his eyes rolled to the back of his head.
Draco had been dreaming of this moment for a very long time, ever since the memories broke free from the wall Hermione had hidden them behind back in June. Harry’s lips were just as soft and warm as he remembered and the feeling that swelled inside his guts was the same that he remembered feeling the first time they had kissed. His hands raised to tangle in Harry’s hair, which was just as surprisingly soft as it had ever been, thumbs grazing over Harry’s cheekbones.
It felt only natural that Weasley would come over to sample the ketchup, which he gave his approval to. However, Flitwick was not very impressed when Weasley suggested we set up a picnic in the middle of class, apparently that wasn’t part of the curriculum.
I turned to him. “I don’t remember giving you permission to search my belongings Blaise, or have the Aurors asked you to search me?”
The tension in Malfoy’s stature evaporated, a grotesque hunger and excitement taking over. He strode to Harry and grabbed his hair, forcing his face up to the light so he could see him better.
“Well… it turned out that neither of us were as, I guess, straight as we thought we were, you know.”
Yes, Harry thought irritably, he could remember some of his classes, and of course he could remember Quidditch, he won the Quidditch Cup that year! And of course he studied in the afternoons with Hermione every day in the common room and in the library…
Hoping for a glimpse of his cock, I grabbed the doorknob (oh my god, knob) and quickly opened the door before I could talk myself out of it. I looked into the room and saw that the curtains were wide open, and the moonlight was streaming in, straight to Harry’s bed. Where Harry sat up, looking straight at me.
Draco closed his eyes and inhaled deeply before looking back at Harry. Harry pulled Draco’s finger out of his mouth, placed a kiss on his palm and reached out to Draco to get him sitting up.
I rolled my eyes at him. “So you kissed one bloke and you’re having a whole big gay-crisis over it?”
It seemed to take Harry a few seconds to process the scene – me, almost naked, in his bed and laughing at him. The loud pounding at the door, he himself tangled in sheets, lying on the floor with a foot still in bed.
We separated a few minutes later to gasp for breath, still clinging as if neither of us ever wanted to separate.
He heard the low voices of his love and Dean followed by their footsteps as they both went into the tent, and he tensed. Hermione shuffled backwards to look at him in the face.
I groaned out and stayed silent, shutting my eyes for a few seconds. When I opened them I saw Harry looking at me, but staying silent. I appreciated the fact that he didn’t pressure me to talk, it was a tough subject. I sat up and moved to sit next to him, and leant against the headboard – the idea of looking into the eyes that pulled me out of that fire would be too much.
“I just know.” He gave me a small smile. “They have the sauces in bottles, so you can add spicier sauce separately if you want, but if I were you, I would go for ‘mango and passion fruit’. At least that’s Ginny’s and Hermione’s favourite sauce.
Everyone was only too happy to comply – our task was to have a fountain of wine sprout from our wands. The glee from my classmates was very palpable, and I spotted Blaise conjuring two goblets out of thin air for himself and Pansy before Flitwick went over to tell them off.
“How dare you, Draco, I am the nicest person you’ve ever met.” He said smiling and he took a sip of his tea, smacking his lips in approval.
Probably no one was more shocked than myself at his unexpected friendship with Hermione. After our first evening back, I had cornered her and apologised for all my past mistakes – everything from the name calling, to the beaver-teeth incident in fourth year. I half expected her to punch me in my beautiful face again and was already planning my next apology after I jinxed all her hair off, when she flung her arms out and hugged me tight. She said she wanted to start over, and I had agreed. Behind all the forced prejudice that father had planted in my mind about Hermione and muggleborns, there was a witty, compassionate and incredibly smart witch that for years he was too blinded to see. We shared our notes with each other, we did our homework together and soon we shared meals and argued theories for hours at a time. If someone had told me 7 years ago that I would consider Hermione to be one of my best friends, I would have laughed and hexed their pants on fire.
I broke the silence. “Earlier you mentioned that there was a prat that you couldn’t stop thinking about” I whispered to him – no one else needed to hear this.
We spent the remainder of the lesson practising, me calmly explaining exactly how to do the spell, him trying his best whilst his attention held and eventually managing to conjure a vinegar fountain. My fountain was popular amongst both the students and Flitwick, and when the bell rang for break, I was pleasantly tipsy.
loved him back. Cried with grief, because he and the man he loved could not be together without fear of one of them dying. Cried with despair, as he thought of Harry almost dying at Voldemort’s hands, wondering where he was and if his injuries were life threatening.
Harry frowned. “What does that mean?” He felt like a fool for repeating the same question so many times. He still had a feeling like he had forgotten something very important.
“Alright then, well I will leave it to it then guys.” Said the waiter, barely waiting for a response before he hurried off.
He looked at me and I could tell he was trying to gather his thoughts about the whole thing before he spoke. “Yeah, I just kissed a guy, but it was all I could think about for the rest of the summer. Every club we went to I was looking for that bloke, even though I knew I’d probably never see him again or he wouldn’t even remember me.”
He blushed slightly but rolled his eyes exaggeratedly. “I don’t know how many more dreadful things I can handle.” He said, sounding like the drama queen he really was.
One moment they were standing in the middle of the clearing, the next Draco was slammed against a tree trunk, Harry gripping his hips and then his thighs as he hoisted Draco up, Draco immediately wrapping his legs around Harry’s torso. It was a while before they both realised a need to breathe and with loud gasps their lips separated, Harry’s immediately tracing a familiar path along Draco’s jaw and down his neck. Draco moaned above him and buried his hair in Harry’s hair, sniffing his musk and drowning in a rush of pleasure, and kissed Harry’s hair reverently.
“Nonsense, Mr Potter. You can take the boy out of Slytherin, but you can’t take Slytherin out of the boy.” Flitwick beamed at me. “Mr Malfoy, would you be so kind as to help Mr Potter with the charm? He could do with your expertise.”
“I get it, I mean I’ve been there too” I looked at him sheepishly. “I’m gay, and I agree it’s definitely weird when you first start figuring it out. Everyone always talks about love and shit like it belongs only between a man and a woman, there’s no fairy tales of men falling in love.” Did I sound bitter? Merlin I fucking hoped not.
Draco rolled his eyes in fond amusement and also got up to shake Linda’s hand. He then signed her a flourishing
“Er, you know, we realised that we were looking for… er, different things” he mumbled, not quite looking me in the eyes as I stared at him.
Silently we made our way to the boy’s dormitories. My room was further down the hall, past Harry’s, but once we reached his room, he made no move to let go of my hand until we reached my own room. We stopped walking when we got to my door, and turned to face each other. I wasn’t yet ready to let him go.
He grinned at me and leaned closer to me. I couldn’t look away from his eyes, the whole world had turned emerald green.
Harry’s eyes twinkled as he looked over at me and I rolled my eyes at him. He completed his order and we returned to the table with our drinks and cutlery. This was the first time I had ever had to pick up my own drink and cutlery in a ‘restaurant’, I still wasn’t convinced by this Nando’s.
I nodded and we put our coats on before walking out. Harry had brought me to a small town that I assumed was still in Scotland. The streets were quiet as we walked through them, and made it to a small river that waded through the town. We talked more and shared other stories, even a bonkers one about Harry and Hermione rescuing that damnable Hippogriff of Hagrid’s back in third year and giving him over to Sirius Black for his escape. Coming from anyone else I wouldn’t have believed a single word, but knowing Harry and his penchant for being involved in highly improbable scenarios I knew it would be true.
Draco turned his face towards Harry and gave him a needy kiss, biting his lip in earnest. His eyes bore into Harry’s, lust flooding out of them and into Harry’s chest.
“Draco, please shut up” Harry smiled and hugged me again. “I haven’t forgotten that you were a Death Eater and I don’t care either way.” He placed a kiss on my lips and pulled back again to look me in my eyes. “The Mark doesn’t define you and I think I know you well enough to know that you don’t believe any of that nonsense anymore, right?”
My stomach did a funny leap at hearing that. “My my, Potter! You are full of surprises! I did not know that!”
“Er, I guess I’ll see you later?” I mumbled, finally getting off the bed and moving to grab my clothes to leave.
His smile was so pure my throat started burning. “I like you too Draco.” He whispered back to me. He moved his other hand to the nape of my neck and pulled my face to his. “I really like you, have been for a while.”
He seemed a bit uncomfortable at the question, so I quickly backtracked. “No don’t say, this is clearly not appropriate, just forget I came here…”
He huffed a laugh “have you been bottling that one in all this time?” He asked gently. I nodded slightly at him and he squeezed his arm around me again. It really felt nice.
Harry seemed taken aback and seemed to realise he said something amiss. “I didn’t mean… I meant that you not wanting me dead can’t be the only reason… right?” he squirmed and pulled at his jumper sleeve in a nervous gesture. Draco’s guess was that even Harry didn’t understand his own stupid fucking question.
“Would you like a cup of tea?” He asked suddenly, and not really knowing what I was agreeing to, I nodded my head.
I summoned the blankets up to cover us both and gripped Harry close to me. I laid my face on his head and dropped a gentle kiss on his head, and let myself drift off back to sleep.
“But I want to” he said quickly. “I mean, I’ve only talked about this with Ginny, Hermione and Ron, and they’re great but… well, they won’t understand as much as you, I guess.”
Being the architect of my own self destruction as I am, I ordered a fourth round of drinks. I was happily buzzed by now, listening to Potter, Weasley and Blaise argue about Quidditch and the Gryffindor and Ravenclaw game that was played the previous weekend. Blaise, being the loyal Slytherin that he was, insisted that there was no chance Slytherin would lose the cup with year, and Weasley’s hand gestures were becoming more and more erratic the more he drank and the more indignant he became.
Hermione said it should be, and after making Draco agree to send a plea for help if he got in trouble, as well as making him promise he won’t stray far, Draco left the protective bubble around the tent and walked into the trees.
Instead, he shook his head. “Thank you, Hermione, but… I think it might be too soon you know? We just got reunited, I don’t think he’s ready yet.”
“We found Potter!” Father said joyfully, as if he had done something other than sit around all day, bemoaning his loss of stature in the Dark Lord’s eyes.
“See you tomorrow darling” Pansy said, tiptoeing up to place a kiss to my cheek, and she shooed us out of the room.
“Yeah, who would have guessed that we would catch these two doing homework?” Said the ginger accomplice. Grinning, Weasley unceremoniously dropped Hermione’s bag off a chair and sat himself on it. Before she could so much as yell a protest, he gently cupped her cheek and kissed her.
He stared at Draco as Draco stared at him, and Harry thought he saw an emotion flicker in Draco’s eyes, something that almost immediately disappeared, making him believe that maybe he had imagined it.
I noticed Harry shiver as the night grew colder, so without thinking much I wrapped my arm around his shoulders as we walked. He let out a gentle sigh that I would have missed had we not been so close, and he put his arm around my waist and squeezed me to him. We walked like that in silence by the river until we reached a tiny little bridge. Without verbal agreement, we both stopped in the middle of the arch of the bridge and looked to the water, which made a gentle trickling sound and reflected the light of the streetlamps and the moon. It really was quite romantic.
The clock chime indicating midday resonated loudly in the quiet living room, indicating the end of the lesson.
By the time we got to the pub, our friends were already sitting at a round table. Pansy and Hermione both gave me a mischievous look, which I ignored to walk straight to the bar with Potters. He got us each a glass of Firewhiskey, and we turned to sit at our table, and that’s when I noticed that the remaining two empty seats were together. Which explained the mischievous looks. I rolled my eyes and sat on the one next to Blaise, Potter taking the one next to Weasley.
A rush of memories flooded Harry’s brain as his and Draco’s lips crashed together, teeth clacking as they held onto each other tightly. Tongues wrestled as tears splashed on their faces, sobs escaping God-knew-who as arms held the other slightly too hard.
“That’s a lovely tattoo” Harry said, as if he couldn’t help himself, and as the lady noticed what he meant she let out a laugh like a bird.
I had to admit that Pansy had nailed the outfit. I was wearing soft black trousers that hugged my butt in the most glorious way and a navy shirt that complimented my skin tone well (which meant my pants were now blue). Careful with my precious hair, I put on a grey jumper on top on took care in making m shirt collars peak out elegantly.
Harry’s knuckles on his wand turned white in anger and he started raising it slowly, casually taking aim at Malfoy. Malfoy seemed to know something was going on in Harry’s mind though as he started turning to him. As he saw Harry’s wand taking aim at him, his eyes widened in shock, but before he could do anything a flurry of bushy hair ran and jumped into his arms.
I don’t know how long we stood there hugging. All that mattered was that Harry held me with an arm around my waist and a hand on my neck. We didn’t say a word, just stood there hugging until my tears ran dry and then stopped.
I held Potter’s stare. I could hear Weasley and Hermione quietly having their 273th daily catch up, so I knew they hadn’t heard my conversation with Potter.
About 6 minutes later I skidded in front of the Charms classroom and burst in through the door. Everyone turned to look at me, so I awkwardly mumbled an apology and went straight to the back of the class. I could hear my classmates snickering and I glanced at the desk where Harry normally sat and he beamed at me, motioning to the empty desk next to him. I hurried over and dived to the seat, hoping to hide my embarrassment as quickly as possible behind my textbook.
A part of me never wanted to speak of this ever again, but I felt like I had to be completely honest with Harry, if only because he was the only person I felt comfortable enough in talking about this with. “Father used to say that muggleborns had earned their magic after killing a witch or wizard. He taught me there was no other logical way for magic to suddenly appear in a family. He believed that to align with muggleborns was like aligning with a demon. That’s why he joined the Dark Lord, he believed we needed to control the muggles before they had a chance to kill us all.”
A flash of grey crossed his mind and Harry’s eyes snapped up to meet Draco’s. Draco was looking at him intently, looking for a flash of something, some recognition that he had longed after for so long.
“It really is him.” She whispered, and in an instant she rolled up her left sleeve and pressed a finger to the Mark.
Harry moaned at the brush of magic and tightened his grip on me. I couldn’t move even if I wanted to, and why the fuck would I move? I felt like I was literally in heaven.
Harry didn’t intend to stop, but he couldn’t resist teasing his husband. He licked along Draco’s crack twice more before planting a firm kiss on his opening, followed by a soft lap and a small kiss. He pulled back slightly and met Draco’s indignant gaze.
A pang went through Harry, Draco would definitely recognise him. After all those years of their open hostility, insults thrown back and forth and fights, he was sure Draco would know him immediately. Harry hoped desperately that Hermione’s brilliant mind was coming up with a way to escape, panic was threatening to choke Harry completely.
Draco’s heart swelled and he pulled Harry’s face to his again, kissing him furiously as his fingers tangled in his hair again. Harry’s grip on his thighs tightened, his touch anchoring Draco firmly to the ground though his heart soared. Their kiss became softer, gentler as their need to feel each other, to hold each other and
“How did they react?” He asked quietly. I met his eyes and knew that if I didn’t want to say, he wouldn’t pressure me to tell him. I just knew that I could never speak about it again and he would never question it, and that made me feel safer and freer than I ever had before.
Draco wanted so badly to say yes, to run into the tent and know that Harry won’t look at him suspiciously, that they would both hug and be reunited, the past few months apart nothing but a nightmare to put to bed.
I half rose off his bed, but his hand tightened on mine and pulled me back. “No, it’s OK Draco, I just don’t want to talk about Ginny, it’s not my place to out her.”
Harry was looking at Draco’s feet as he tried to think back. “All of it? What kind of question is that?”
“OK fine, I’ll go, stop manhandling me woman!” I shove at her until she lets go, smiling triumphantly. “One drink, and I’ll be coming back. I need my beauty sleep, you know that.”
“No you don’t hun, you finished everything before Runes, remember?” Hermione truly was a deviant and was smiling at me like one.
His hand was resting tantalisingly close on his knee. Before I could think about it too much, I grabbed it in my hand. “I feel the same.”
I woke with a start, soaked, gasping for breath and indeed surrounded by tentacles. It took me a few seconds to notice those tentacles were actually Harry’s limbs and that I was drenched in sweat. A while after that the memories of what happened a few hours before flooded my brain, the rush of emotions making me shudder.
Gripping his head I delved back into a messy kiss, and slowly started grinding against him. His grip on my hips tightened and I couldn’t help the needy noises coming out of my mouth. With a particularly loud groan I tilted my head backwards and Harry’s lips immediately went to my throat.
Hermione again seemed to know what he was thinking, but it was Ron that shook his head in answer. “Sorry mate” he clapped Draco on the shoulder and stepped towards Hermione, putting his arm around her shoulders.
Harry Potter didn’t know he was a wizard, when the entire wizarding world knew his name? “That’s just… wow.” I really didn’t know what to say to that.
“So you kissed a bloke, that’s it?” I asked, really quite amused at the glare I got from him. “That’s great.”
A warm hand touched his shoulder, another his lower back, both painfully familiar. The one on his shoulder held him, the one on the back started rubbing in circles, slowly as it had a hundred times before, as if it had never stopped, as if he had never forgotten.
At some point after midnight I heard Pansy’s giggling – clearly the group was back from the pub, and by the sound of it the couples hadn’t separated to each of their dorms.
“But they match the shirt!” She protested from across the room. As I looked at my clothes I reluctantly had to admit she was right. I glanced backwards to make sure they weren’t looking at me and saw they were hunched together whispering frantically. I quickly changed and, yes, I changed my boxers too. I then stood in front of my mirror to inspect my outfit.
“That’s ok, anytime” he said smiling. “Though maybe next time it can wait ‘till morning?” He joked – or at least I hoped.
Blaise just patted his shoulder. “Just kidding Potter, I don’t give a fuck what time you get back. Just be quiet, I don’t want any
I bristled slightly at the mention of the Weaslette name, but ignored it for now, there was absolutely no need for me to get jealous of some red-haired harlot when I was the one currently on a date with Harry. Instead I went back to the menu and decided to have half a chicken with a side of salad and a portion of grains and nuts. I put my menu down and looked around, trying to make eye contact with a waiter to take our order.
“I was thinking, do you guys want to go down to the Three Broomsticks? Celebrate the weekend and all.” Weasley suggested the group, nodding his hello to Blaise and Pansy.
“Yeah come on grandma, live a little!” Pansy said, pinning my arms by my side in a ferocious hug. “Pleaaaaaaase!”
to get back to, Draco took his punishment. And he knew they would be amazing, the feeling that had swooped in his heart as that unknown barrier came down left him no doubt that what had just been unlocked had been something special enough to lock away in the first place.
“Thank you so much for coming again Linda” Harry jumped to his feet in his excitement and reached out a hand for Linda to shake. “I don’t know what we would do without you!”
I glared at Pansy through the reflection in my mirror. Really, what was I thinking asking her for help in getting ready for my date with Harry when I was more than capable of getting presentable by myself.
The kiss was short, but everything Draco had hoped for. He drew his head back slightly so he could see the look on Harry’s face, to try to determine what he was thinking.
Harry gave a soft laugh. “I’ll get you one, drama queen.” He kissed Draco on the temple and stood up. “Yes, you are” he said in response to Draco’s thought-retort
“It was you who found me” he said, turning his head slightly to place a kiss on Draco’s hand. “Thank you.” He whispered.
at Malfoy, but also walk over to him and join Hermione in their group hug, holding the both of them tightly.
We made it to the Entrance Hall and walked around the edges to the door. The noise coming from the Great Hall was loud, and there were several groups of younger students milling about and chatting excitedly with each other. Feeling the gazes of some on us, I gently tugged my hand away from Harry so as to not draw attention, but Harry gripped me firmly and lead me outside the Entrance.
Harry cupped Draco’s cheek and kissed him again. Really, neither of them needed to talk, they both knew how much they were loved and cared for by the other.
Harry stayed silent for a while processing what I told him. “That… doesn’t surprise me” he said. “No wonder you hated muggles so much, if that’s what you’re taught growing up.”
“I’m… I’m sorry, Dean. Er… you can bring Griphook inside, there are plenty of beds where he can rest.”
We all walked up to our common room to get our cloaks and scarves, and traipsed our way to the pub. It was early December, and the snow levels were steadily growing. Forced to walked down the path in twos, I found myself walking next to none other than Potter at the back of the group, his nose looking steadily redder from the cold. It was truly adorable.
I frowned a bit at that last part, who wouldn’t remember snogging the Saviour himself? “Was the bloke a muggle?”
“I’m not saying it’s bad” he frowned at me. “Just confusing you know? I like girls, since always, but I think I like guys too, or at least one and, I don’t know, it’s so confusing. I never really had a chance to think of stuff like that you know, thanks to a bat-shit crazy fucker I never had a normal childhood or time to even think about these things, and now there’s this infuriating, annoying prat who I can’t stop thinking about, and all I know is that I’m not sure what to do about it or how to know if he likes me back.”
“You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to Draco” he whispered suddenly. “You don’t owe anything to anyone. You don’t need to do anything you don’t want to do.” He repeated himself, almost as if he was trying to convince himself as much as he was trying to convince me. I held him tighter to me, burying my nose in his scarf and inhaling his scent.
His answering smile was so full of happiness I couldn’t help grinning back. He leaned his face close to mine, our lips almost brushing together when he whispered, “my boyfriend” and kissed me, tentatively, as my eyes fell shut. He pulled away and it took me a second to pull myself together and open my eyes to look at him. I smiled at him and leant down to kiss him again.
“Why don’t you want to come Malfoy? You know we’re not going to kill you – probably” Weasley said, laughing at his own terrible joke.
Too soon I heard some horribly noises from next door. Seriously, they may be smart, but my two best friends either didn’t know any privacy spells, or never bothered to use them. I really, really hoped it was the former – I couldn’t bear knowing that they didn’t use them on purpose.
spot, causing Draco to drop his head back into the pillows. Harry kissed down Draco’s neck as he pulled at Draco’s cock, twisting it just so at the tip as Draco liked it. As Harry sucked a love bite into life on Draco’s collarbone, Draco’s nails dug into Harry’s shoulders and his arse
I felt Harry tense next to me as we both saw it, and our eyes met at the same time as a horrible memory of deep trauma flashed through my mind.
Flitwick carefully ‘sampled’ the wine again. “Well Mr Malfoy, I am impressed! 10 points to Slytherin!”
His mind spun, searching for a way out, trying to work out a way to get his Love and his friends out of danger. He locked the panic away for now, he needed his mind clear if they were all going to make it out alive today.
Next thing I knew I was laying on top of Harry, both of us panting and neither letting go of the other. It was a while before I truly noticed the mess in my pants and how uncomfortable it was becoming and looking down I saw that Harry was in the same situation. I flicked my wrist and both of us were instantly clean.
I still don’t know who was the first to move, or if we simply couldn’t help the obvious attraction between us, but the next thing I knew his wonderfully soft lips were on mine and I felt like I was flying. He grazed his tongue against my lips and I gasped in surprise. He took that opportunity to let his tongue into my mouth and grazed mine softly.
I grabbed my wand and padded over to Harry’s room and pressed an ear to his door. Silence too. The bastard better not be sleeping.
“So… Harry doesn’t remember?” Draco asked, trying to sound casual. The image of Harry looking at him with such blatant distrust was burnt into his mind, more painful than he had imagined it would be.
“Not tonight you don’t, tonight we part-ay!” Pansy said, elbowing me sharply so I almost choke to death on broccoli. And what a pathetic way to die that would be.
What a weird question. I looked at Harry, hoping for some help, but he looked like he could barely contain himself.
The most surprising change in this new life could be this new acceptance within the 8th year group that had come back. True, not many had bothered – most students had found jobs or apprenticeships, or had travelled abroad. Not everyone wanted to return to the castle haunted by the ghosts of their friends. But mother had insisted I return. With father in prison and the Malfoy name tainted, she said I wasn’t likely to get employed without any NEWTs.
My mind went back to a time during the summer holiday that I snuck out of the Manor to go to London by myself. I wanted to get away from the drama, leave the trials behind and get away from father for one afternoon. I had gone to muggle London, and visited the British Museum and for hours I had wondered round looking at all the different ancient art pieces and the history behind them. I had ended up in front of The Discobolus, an ancient Roman statue of an athlete throwing a discus. I read its story, oh how a man called Hyacinth was accidentally killed by a discus thrown by his lover Apollo. I had stared for a long time at the statue and thought of the story it represented, the pain Apollo must have felt at accidentally killing his lover.
Potter held the door open for me, so chivalrous of him, and together we started walking back to the castle. I noticed that he walked a lot slower than usual, normally he practically jogged everywhere, I guess because he felt his saviour instincts kick in? I don’t know, but who was I to complain about spending more time alone with him?!
By the time I finished relaying my order to him, it was out turn to order. We approached a lady at the counter with bright pink hair and covered in tattoos. As Harry gave her a table number (whatever that meant) and handed her a plastic card, she reached out with her arm and, beautifully tattooed on her forearm there was a ferret.
He just winked at me “we’ll work out the details tonight.” He grabbed his bag and walked off to class, leaving my heart beating madly in his wake.
The recovery also drained a lot of energy from Draco and to this day he was only able to remain energetic for a couple of hours at a time. He and Harry would utilise those periods effectively by either going out for long walks, runs, or quick trips around the country for lunch or dinner. Harry would keep a constant stream of conversation during the outings, talking as both himself and Draco, which amused Draco to no end. On occasion Harry would make a rather terrific imitation of Draco’s drawl, which always earned him an elbow to the ribs and a grin from his husband.
, he wanted to reply but didn’t dare. Of course Harry didn’t know, the spell still clouded his memories of them together, of the words they had whispered to each other for months, the promises they had made to each other.
A voice sounded from far away, muffled as if Draco was under water. Was he drowning? He felt like he was drowning.
“Yeah, of course.” Potter scratched the back of his head awkwardly. “So… do you still want to come? I’ll buy you a drink?” He said, and he almost sounded hopeful.
“Draco, is it Potter? If we hand him to the Dark Lord, all will be forgiven!” Malfoy’s excitement was barely contained.
“Thank you! She’s my pet ferret, her name is Lucy. You can’t tell from the tattoo, but her coat is pure white.”
“See you at breakfast” Hermione said with a smirk, and gave Weasley a sharp look when he seemed inclined to protest.
Sleep clearly wasn’t a priority in my life anymore. I couldn’t take it, I just had to know for sure. How would I sleep without knowing what Harry was thinking?
Draco’s breathing was heavy as Harry started trailing kisses along his jaw. He paused at Draco’s ear for a nibble and a lick, and carried on his path down his neck, kissing, biting and licking as he went. With Draco’s hands gripping his hair, he left a particularly strong love bite at Draco’s collar and he moved further down. He trailed kisses and licks down the scar he had once left in a bathroom, and took care to kiss right above Draco’s heart which he felt fluttering madly under his lips.
The feeling of desperation threatened to overwhelm him. The sight of Harry raising a wand at him with white knuckles had been far more painful than any bout of Cruciatus curse had been, and yet not nearly enough for him to hate himself desperately for the position he had left his mother in. He knew she could take care of herself, she was an impressive duellist and so fucking smart – she knew how to hide in plain sight, how to walk in and out of rooms without being noticed. She was Draco’s hero… and he had left her to the wolves.
Panic had flared in his gut the second that the wards had alerted them of a large group of people entering their grounds. It had been an instinct he thought when Harry’s mangled face entered the room he was in, an instinct born from a promise he was supposed to have forgotten.
I gulped and looked around. In normal circumstances I would have sat on his desk chair, but that had been long buried in what looked like half of Harry’s wardrobe. There were no other chairs, and I didn’t bother looking for any other excuses before I sat on the foot of Harry’s bed, facing him.
He shook his head slightly and looked at me. “My cousin’s nickname from his friends was Big D, that just reminded me.” He fell silent
“You must know it is” I said, rolling my eyes. “First off, this is a muggle place and I’m sure that over the years you might have gotten a hint that my family doesn’t appreciate muggle culture.”
This kid looked confused as he stood there, and didn’t say anything as if he was expecting me to continue talking. When I didn’t, he simply said “OK? Is this your first time in Nando’s?”
As we slowed down with our eating the conversation picked up. We talked about our different classes and shared stories and laughed together. I told Harry a story of how Pansy, Blaise and I had once tried to sneak into the Ravenclaw common room because we had heard that Terry Boot had smuggled a crate of Firewhiskey in, but we couldn’t get past the riddle the door sang to us,
I did wonder though, was Potter serious on his flirting or was he having a bit of fun? Was he actually interested in something, or was I clutching wands? It was too easy to imagine him being interested in me, Merlin knows how many nights I fantasised about Potter opening my bedroom door without knocking, closing it behind himself and stopping my shout of indignation with a kiss that left me breathless. Him and I clutching at each other, desperate to get our clothes of, us stumbling to my bed, still touching and grabbing and tasting each other…
“Good evening, is everything alright?” Said the waiter, and Draco realised with a start that this waiter was barely older than he himself. Harry just looked at me, looking concerned and as if he was trying to contain his laughter.
Potter finally gabbed my hand, and laced his fingers with mine without saying a word. It gave me the strength I needed to carry on talking.
The sky had begun to lighten to a dull grey, though it barely filtered through the trees. Draco begun walking in no particular direction, following what looked like an animal trail, trying to organise his thoughts.
“HARRY! You’re going to be late for class! Wake up!” Weasley was pounding at the door so hard it was a wonder it was still held on by the hinges.
Harry struggled to keep on his feet as he, Hermione, Ron, Dean and Griphook were dragged, all tied together, into Malfoy Manor. He was trying to think quickly of a way to get out of here, get everyone out, without anyone dying. His chest was constricted with an anxiety he had felt once before, a lifetime ago, when another mistake had led to the death of his godfather. It couldn’t happen again, it won’t, he would
Harry’s last words to him before they had both been Obliviated to forget their relationship. Their real relationship, mind you, one forged in love and care, not hate and envy like they had been at one time.
In an instant, he had Stupefied his aunt, then the wolf. He cast an Impedimenta to some man who was holding a sword for some reason, and slashed the ties binding the prisoners together. A moment later, Hermione was helping Dean up, Ron was picking up the goblin, and Harry had dived to the wolf to retrieve all their wands.
He fell silent again and I could feel I had touched a sore spot by the look of his face. “Sorry, Harry, it’s none of my business, just ignore –”
Ron grasped Draco’s shoulder again and gave him a one armed hug, Hermione reaching around Ron to also hug Draco. “We’re with you little ferret” Ron said, grinning at Draco’s eye roll.
Harry scoffed and squeezed my hand affectionately. “So what would you like to talk about then?” He asked.
“I didn’t realise I had to seduce my husband after 5 years” Harry asked, pretending to be shocked. “If I had known I would have done something completely different.” He rested a hand, almost accidentally, on Draco’s thigh.
Draco simply grinned at Harry and leant over to kiss him. It started sweet and gentle, but soon it became a clash of tongues and teeth that had them both panting. Draco sucked Harry’s tongue into his mouth and opened his eyes to look into Harry’s.
I turned to look at him so quick I could feel a pop in my neck. I hadn’t had time to consider how awful it would have been for him to watch me bolt out of his room, and I suddenly worried what his reaction would be.
Draco took another small step forward. “Do you remember your classes? Quidditch? Do you remember who you studied with in the afternoons?”
“What kind of heathen do you think I truly am, Potter?” I teased at him, grinning when our eyes met. I looked back down at the menu and frowned at it. This menu was so confusing.
“Harry are you up already?! Let me in!” Weasley carried on with his foolish endeavour to break the door down.
“Well… I mean, you know about my history is Rosmerta… it’s uncomfortable, you know.” I replied quietly.
of his friends Disapparating echoed in the hall as Harry grabbed Draco's hand. They met each other's eyes and Draco thought he saw something in Harry's, confusion and… comprehension?
I stood still for a second and just took him in. He actually was shirtless, so there still was hope that I would see the glorious bastard naked, but what really did it for me was the way he looked at me. Yep, that definitely was lust in his eyes. My heart fluttered.
Harry gently pulled his fingers out of Draco and raised himself onto his knees. With a whisper he cast a lubricating charm and quickly lathered his cock, noticing how Draco followed his every move. Draco reached a hand over as if to grasp Harry’s cock, but with a growl Harry grabbed the hand and pinned it above Draco’s head. He guided his cock towards Draco’s entrance but paused before pushing in
“She’s right Draco, you don’t need to finish that tonight, it isn’t due until Monday” Hermione helpfully chipped in.
“Oh Draco, thank you so much for what you’ve done, you’ve saved our lives!” Hermione sobbed into Malfoy’s shoulder. He simply hugged her harder, letting out a shuddering breath as he squeezed his eyes shut.
“Being a few minutes late to class won’t get you into much trouble.” He nudged my side and I flushed even more.
He looked away from his friends to their other companions and saw Dean help Griphook up into a sitting position. Harry went to them, hoping to forget the sight of his best friends and his childhood nemesis
I stared looking towards Harry’s door for a while before I turned to my own room and locked myself inside. All I could think of was the look in his eyes when he said those words.
“Don’t forget these!” Pansy yelled, and I turned around in time for a flying pair of boxers to hit me in the face, quickly followed by a neatly folded pair of socks.
Instantly, Draco’s arm burnt, and his Harry moaned on the floor. Draco knew that meant his scar had burnt too – Voldemort was on the way.
Harry’s hand trailed up and down Draco’s thigh, gently caressing, slowly teasing. “Well my love, I know how much you enjoy being touched and teased, so I would start there.” He looked down quickly and saw Draco’s erection slowly filling up his trousers. “Would you look at that, it’s already working.”
You would think that I had stabbed Potter if you heard the gasp he let out. I had no idea what he was thinking, but her suddenly turned beet red.
“We’re just finishing a translation for tomorrow’s lesson. We were nearly done before you rudely interrupted us”, I threw Potter a pointed look, ruined by the small smile I couldn’t stop from appearing. “Where were you, playing Quidditch? You know you’re not allowed on the teams this year, you old fuck.”
I didn’t want to prod, but I couldn’t help my curiosity. “You don’t really talk of your relatives, what were they like?”
The softness of his lips contrasted with the sharpness of his teeth as he bit my lip. As I gasped his tongue entered my mouth and licked mine tentatively before we both furiously began snogging each other. One of my hand gripped him by the back of his neck and the other held onto the collar of his coat, pulling him against me as close as we could be. I slanted my face just slightly to kiss him deeper and he moaned in appreciation and tightened his arms around my back.
“I’ve been wanting to do that all morning” Harry whispered against my mouth, lips moving gently against mine. We launched into a fresh attack, teeth smashing as we kissed as if our lives depended on it.
Sharp claws grabbed him by the shoulder, a stench of blood, sweat and nightmares clouded his mind as Greyback dragged the group through the Manor into what looked like a sitting room.
“What kind of weird place did you bring me to, Potter?” I asked as I stood. What kind of fucked up restaurant made its customers queue up to order food to be brought to them to their table?! “Why are we queueing again?”
“What in Merlin’s name do you think you’re doing, boy?” Father hissed at him, teeth bare, eyes flaring with a madness that Draco was not going to miss. “I am going to
Harry could feel his balls tighten but as always refused to acknowledge them. It was his unofficial rule that Draco would always come first, the sight of him falling apart being the single most erotic image that Harry could ever conjure. So he reached between them and grabbed Draco’s cock in a firm grip and changed the angle of his thrusts to hit
Draco’s arse clenched around Harry’s cock, urging him to move, which Harry could hardly refuse. He pulled out halfway and snapped his hips back in, making Draco close his eyes and moan in Harry’s mind. He pulled out further next time and felt Draco arse clench possessively around him. He followed his imagination, moving as he knew Draco loved, chasing the ghosts of Draco’s moans, turning his husband into a quivering mess below him.
“So why don’t you like coming to the pub Malfoy?” He asked me, quietly so he wouldn’t be overheard. His consideration was actually endearing.
Draco’s response was to lift his hips to brush their cocks together, eliciting a groan from Harry and fully breaking his restraint. He separated long enough to rip Draco’s trousers and pants off, followed by his own, before he went straight back to snogging Draco and grinding their cocks together.
We chatted idly whilst watching the muggles around us until our food arrived. Harry had also ordered half a chicken with hot sauce, and a massive plate of chips, which he immediately attacked. I looked at my chicken and back at Harry, sceptical on the quality. Harry and I made eye contact and he raised a questioning eyebrow at my hesitation. Without comment, I picked up my knife and fork, and carefully cut off a piece of chicken breast. I sniffed it, which made Harry laugh, and quickly put the piece of chicken in my mouth.
I swallowed down the thickness in my throat and pushed the thought out of my mind for now. Without letting go of Harry’s hand, I got my textbook and parchment out and started taking some notes for class. We worked silently for a while until Flitwick announced that we should start the practical test.
Harry jumped so hard he fell out of bed tangled in his sheet and I couldn’t help the guffaw that slipped out.
Hearing Potter’s barked laughter made me feel lighter, but nothing like when he grabbed my arm in an affectionate squeeze. “No one has said we can’t help our team train though.”
Sharp sticks and stones dug into Draco’s knees as he fell on the floor gasping for air. He embraced the pain, trying desperately to feel something that wasn’t this hollowness, the hopelessness that seemed to not go away, the desperation he felt at leaving his mother behind in the hands of a maniac. His chest hurt, the pressure almost unbearable, and even as he gasped he couldn’t
Draco frowned, feeling his pulse rise rapidly. “Excuse me?” He said, shocked to realise how angry he sounded. How did Harry dare question Draco on whether or not he wanted him dead?
Harry moved his head back to look into Draco’s eyes. Draco stoked a thumb over Harry’s cheekbone, and Harry’s face leant into the touch.
“Next… I would start kissing you here” with his other hand he raised one of Draco’s hands up to his mouth. He kissed the back of Draco’s hand. “I would kiss you all over” Harry kissed every one of Draco’s knuckles, each of his fingers, pausing at the ring finger where the band he had placed all those years ago still rested. He left a lingering kiss on that finer and, making sure Draco was watching, he sucked that finger into his mouth at the same time as his other hand finally cupped Draco’s cock.
I imagine he remembered the same thing I did because he let out an unexpected bark of laughter. “You wish.”
We finally made it to the courtyard where we got into a heated discussion of the realities of dating paintings when Harry tugged my arm to call my attention. I looked at him and he discretely cocked his head to the side, signalling a more secluded alcove where we could easily hide. I followed him there.
Tense, I watched as he did the whole wine-sampling regalia, and I couldn’t help by feel aggravated that I was the first student to get such a thorough testing. He stirred the wine in the goblet, sniffed it and then took a careful sip. I saw his eyes widen in shock as he quickly took a rather large gulp, almost as if he hoped that no one noticed the Professor drinking on the job.
I could practically hear all the laments of his fan club from my room. I wondered briefly how it would feel like to care for their feelings, but I would lie if I admitted I gave a damn.
“Look closer, Draco! His eyes look very green – wait is that his scar?!” Lucius practically squealed like a child that had been given a crup for Christmas.
“My, my Mr Malfoy, you certainly have good taste! Of course, this spell can recognise the caster’s drinking preferences and casts accordingly. May I ask, what wine is this?”
“Hey, hey, hey” Harry said, tugging us both to a stop and he turned me round to face him. “Don’t say that, how can a child ignore his parents?”
Once hidden, Harry grabbed my face and gave me a heated kiss. I clung to his hips to stop myself from falling if my knees collapsed and gave as good as I got. Our tongues wrestled in each other’s mouths, teeth nibbling at lips and moans being drowned by the other.
“Merlin, Potter shut up!” I said, fully grinning. He was so cute when he rambled. Gods, I needed to control myself. “I spoke with Rosmerta over the summer. I apologised, she accepted it, we’re OK, I just feel a bit uncomfortable you know?”
Draco arched his back as Harry feasted, licking and slurping at Draco’s pucker. His silent moans were deafening in Harry’s mind as he wrapped his lips around the pucker and
“Right, well we’re off!” Potter stood up abruptly and wrapped his cloak around him. “Have fun kids, see you all at breakfast?”
, his hand movements somehow showing the posh accent no one would hear again, but one which Harry would remember forever.
“I… don’t know. I can’t be sure” Draco practically whispered, his eyes still searching Harry’s face, was he looking for something?
that I couldn’t help but moan. I dug into my meal with far too much enthusiasm, but I could not bring myself to give a flying fuck. Even the salad and grains were nice, but I did find myself eyeing Harry’s chips often, so much so that he offered his plate to me, which I ‘gracefully’ accepted with a mouth full of chicken.
An arm wrapped around his waist and pulled Draco into a warm embrace, back against chest. A hand moves from his neck to his forehead, and Draco feels his head gently laid down on Harry’s shoulder, facing towards his neck, the sight so familiar his chest contracted and finally loosened. Slowly his breathing returned to normal, the fog cleared from his mind and as he opened his eyes he could see well enough, the light from the sunrise gently filtering through the trees.
My self-imposed one drink rule was broken roughly 12 minutes into our outing, with Blaise buying the second round for the table. Hermione and Ron got the round after that, and soon we were sharing stories and gossiping like a bunch of teenagers, talking about what teachers we thought were having an affair with who, and what ghosts were secretly pining one another. Weasley swore that he had seen the Bloody Baron chat up with miserable-looking lady from a painting in the 4th floor corridor, and Potter reduced the table to hooting laughter with how Tomas and Finnigan had been awkwardly caught making out by a scandalised Headmistress McGonagall in a nightgown and waving a mug of hot chocolate indignantly as Peeves made his appearance and starting singing a rude version of A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love by Celestina Warbeck.
It was Christmas Eve when Voldemort had returned to the Manor and tortured Draco and his family out of anger, anger at letting Harry escape once more when his snake Nagini had failed to trap Harry and, presumably, Hermione, at Godric’s Hollow.
“How? Hermione can’t have done it wrong” Ron said, sounding almost offended at the possibility of Hermione not being amazing, but she just rolled her eyes.
“And that’s why you love us so much!” Blaise said. He walked up to me and caught me in a bear hug. “I hope your date goes well Draco, we would wait up to hear all about it but I’d rather sleep soundly through the night.”
Harry barely was able to contain his distrust to the boy, but seeing how forgiven his husband was towards the boy that had caused him to lose his voice endeared Harry to no end. Shacklebolt had even granted the pair a full 3 months fully paid leave for them to get used to their new reality. Harry, though, suspected it was a simple bribe for the pair to not sue the Ministry for health and safety negligence.
“Pansy! You’re supposed to help me choose clothes, not my underwear I can choose that myself!” I snapped at her.
Because of course he was going with Harry. Now they had found each other there was no way Harry was going anywhere without Draco.
“Draco, when you’re ready to order you go to the counter and order there. Do you know what you want?” he asked me again.
Harry guffawed behind me as I straightened with indignation. “But Sir, I’m no longer part of Slytherin.”
“We don’t need to go to the Three Broomsticks, we could go to the Hogs Head, or even go somewhere else, maybe to the Leaky, or even this place called The Horntail down in Edinburgh, have you been? It’s a really quite nice, and quite nice, or we don’t have to go out at all we could just –“
“I mean I don’t know if I am gay.” He mumbled quietly. He seemed quite dejected, which actually pissed me off a bit.
Draco was trying very hard not to break apart as Hermione held him tightly. What the fuck had he done?! Not only had he publicly declared his allegiance to Harry Potter – in front of Voldemort’s strongest supporters, mind you, who were also his FAMILY
Harry seemed to understand and took pity on me. “In case you’re wondering what the chili meter is, when you choose what you want to eat you can make it as spicy as you want. But you don’t really like spicy, do you?”
Trying my best to not wake Harry, I Banished my pyjamas off of myself, opting to stay in my boxers too – if he was in his I might as well be comfortable, right? The brush of magic seemed to make him shiver, and I froze for a few seconds to make sure he hadn’t woken up. When all he did was snuggle me tighter, I held my breath and cast a gentle cleaning charm over my sweaty body. I watched in awe as Harry groaned slightly and slid even close to me.
Harry frowned. “We haven’t talked in over a year” he said, though he actually didn’t seem sure of himself as he said it.
“You” I blurted. I took a hasty sip of tea and coughed to avoid choking to death. “I mean you got to hear about my pitiful coming-out story, it’s only fair that I hear yours.”
But after several months I, Draco Malfoy, couldn’t pretend to be miserable anymore. The hate that I had expected to be on the receiving end never came. Yes, sometimes an insult was thrown my way, a whispered “Death Eater scum” heard from a dark corner, but nothing too creative, nothing worth remembering. I didn’t care to remember unoriginal insults; they were far too boring to keep track.
“OK let me finish my drink and we can go” I said, smiling at him. I only had about half of my drink left, so I took the only reasonable action I could think of and chugged the thing down. Potter’s quiet chuckle made my stomach flip in a way that all the Firewhiskey I had drunk so far couldn’t. He was looking at me and I felt myself blush. There was something in his eyes, could it possibly be –
I started drifting back into fantasy land, where Potter and I did unspeakable things in the men’s room when I felt real-life Potter nudge me with his knee under the table. Holding back a happy sigh I looked at him questioningly.
Talking about being ignorant, my father’s face bloomed to mind. “My father used to tell me elaborate stories in which the muggles were always the bad monsters. I believed that all muggles were evil, and they would kill wizards if they knew we existed. He was particularly fond of retelling witch hunt stories, muggles were always so cruel in those.”
because we couldn’t stop giggling. Harry couldn’t contain his laughter as I told him how it took a very confused and worried third year to mumble “your age” to the door for it to finally open.
We locked gazes and for a while we just stared into each other’s eyes. I felt like I was floating, yet tethered to this bed by his emerald eyes.
Harry stopped walking again, and held my hand firmly so I would stop. He looked at me, and pulled me into a strong hug. I couldn’t stop the tears from falling then, so I hugged Harry and buried my face in his neck so he wouldn’t see.
I sniffed a bit and pulled a handkerchief out of my pocket, separating fully from Harry so I could blow my nose. “I’m sorry” I mumbled.
He laughed and blushed. “Yes, well, he really was the only guy I’ve been with. And I don’t mean been with, like in that way you know? Er, yeah, we just kissed.” He was scratching the back of his head, clearly uncomfortable and I felt rather bad for wanting to know literally everything else.
The 8th years had their own common room in their own tower. As we were now considered adults, we each had our own room, we didn’t have a curfew and we were allowed to leave the castle at our leisure – as long as we didn’t leave overnight without notifying the headmistress.
It was nearly a month after the accident occurred. An intern in Draco’s department decided that they were capable of brewing, unsupervised, a potion for his mother’s chest infection. Harry had reluctantly agreed that the end result would have cured the infection – though by killing the mother.
We looked at each other for a while, and I honestly could barely even remember why I had come to see Harry. 10 minutes ago it seemed imperative that I come to see him, but by then my mouth was dry and my mind blank.
“Oh, wow” Harry whispered, his eyes snapping open and looking at Draco as if seeing him for the first time. “
I didn’t think I would get this far so I asked the first thing that came to mind. “You mentioned that both you and the Weaslette weren’t straight, is that true?”
Harry came back a few minutes later with two cups of tea, a milky one with two sugars for Draco, and one with just a dash of milk with no sugar for himself. He put down the milky one in front of Draco and pretended to gag. “There’s your piss, love.”
“Holy shit Draco” Harry groaned into Draco’s throat. “I can’t believe… I’m so glad I found you again.”
“Can you come in already, Merlin it’s cold out there” he smiled at me as I quickly went into the room and closed the door behind me, a bit too loudly, my brain helpfully let me know. I stood by the door, still staring at him, not knowing what to do.
“I didn’t want you to be killed.” He instead said simply. Harry’s eyes glimmered with a feeling Draco couldn’t quite tell and he had to look away, their eye contact becoming too intense. He stood up and stretched his back, feeling it pop, before he turned once more towards Harry and saw him looking at him still. He raised his eyebrow in a silent question, not sure if he should talk.
“I was such an idiot, believing everything. So stupid” I could feel tears burn my eyes but I didn’t let them fall, I deserved the pain. “I should have questioned him, should have ignored him or something, I was so stupid…”
We sat in silence again. Merlin, what was I thinking, coming here at midnight and just staring at Harry like a fucking weirdo? I was about to get up and run to my room when he reached over and grabbed my hand.
We passed the gates and headed into the village further and Harry said “we’re going to a little town not too far from here, a muggle town. Is that ok with you?”
Linda laughed as she took Harry’s hand “Oh, I’m sure you two would manage.” She gave both Draco and Harry a twinkling look. “You two can already communicate so much without words, I’ve hardly ever seen a couple quite like you.”
“The first time? So how many men have there been Potter?” I teased him, hoping my jealousy didn’t show through.
They started grinding against each other ruthlessly, the room filling with the sweet sound of Harry’s moans. Harry grabbed Draco’s arse cheeks in his hands and squeezed them before flipping them over once more, so he was on top again.
I stared down to the ground and didn’t reply. Harry just pulled me into a hug, holding me tightly. “It’s not your fault, Draco. None of it was” he whispered into my ear. “Don’t blame yourself for your parents’ mistakes, they’re not yours to pay for.”
“That sounds great guys, but I need to finish my translation” I said, before popping broccoli in my mouth.
Harry grinned as Draco twisted his body slightly so both his legs came up on the sofa and he rested his feet on Harry’s lap. “I don’t need sugar in my tea, I’m sweet enough thank-you-very-much.” He said, wiggling his eyebrows at his husband as he automatically started rubbing Draco’s feet.
Panting, Harry lifted off Draco and took in the glorious sight of his flustered husband. His silver/gold hair was ruffled and a blush had made its way to his ears. His pupils had practically swallowed the silver of his eyes and he stared at Harry reproachfully.
Harry kept a gentle, teasing suction on Draco’s cock as he slowly fingered him, a second one soon joining in with the first. He teased Draco’s slit with his tongue at the same time as he found Draco’s prostrate which made Draco’s entire body jerk.
“Well, here’s the Malfoy you owl-ordered Potter” he said sarcastically and finally let me go. “Be good you two, and I want you both back by 9!”
He just laughed. “I’ll remember that for tonight then, I’ll make sure there’s plenty of fancy wine for my poncy prat. And I’ll just be kind of there.”
Harry brought Malfoy to a small clearing in the middle of a forest where a small tent had been set up. Harry quickly let go of Malfoy’s arm and squeezed his wand in his hand, unsure of how to proceed. Malfoy had been his nemesis for 7 years! Why had he been helping Harry and his friends escape Voldemort? Because harry knew for sure that Voldemort was on his way, the way his scar had burnt in the Manor had come with a swooping feeling of elation that Harry definitely did not feel at the time. Was this a ploy to get everyone relaxed and comfortable before Malfoy called Voldemort here? Was he hoping that Harry would be asleep, so that Voldemort could kill him easier?
Harry added a third finger and Draco started fucking himself back onto Harry’s hand, making Harry groan around his tip and suck his entire length into his mouth and throat.
I told Harry about my life after my mother and I had been cleared of all charges, how he didn’t feel safe walking outside by himself. Quietly, I told him about that time I had gone to Diagon Alley by myself to get a set of books I had been dying to read, only to be surrounding by what I could only describe as a mob, who ambushed me, surrounded me and yelled insults and threats. I admitted to Harry what I had refused to explain to my mother, the reasons why my chest and back had been covered in bruises and half-healed cuts for weeks because one of my attackers knew a spell that would slow the healing.
It took me a second to process that information. “Wait, what do you mean about finding out you were a wizard?”
By instinct Draco had erected walls in his mind to protect those memories, to keep them safe until he was alone and able to study them.
He got out of bed and a pang went through my groin as I saw his boxers cling tightly to his arse. He walked to his desk and prepared us both cups of tea whilst I stood by the door still, drinking in the sight of him.
“Now that I can do” I replied and grabbing him by the arm we carried on walking to the village, our friends ahead of us and lost in their own couple-world.
We must have looked ridiculous, both standing way too close and grinning together like idiots, but I didn’t care. I was going on a date – with Harry James FUCKING Potter!!”
It had been an odd night – a really fucking weird evening. Not only had he attacked some of the Dark Lord’s strongest supporters, publicly declaring his allegiance to Harry Potter, but he had also left his mother behind. His chest constricted with a pang of anxiety and he couldn’t help a sob escaping, his lungs working at double, triple speed to supply oxygen to his brain. The walls started closing in, the weight of a cement block on his chest barely allowing him to breathe, all he could think of was his mother, what he had done to her, how she might
We stood in silence for a while, drinking our tea and stealing glances at each other. If I wasn’t so nervous it would have been rather cute.
I glanced at him and noticed how his hand was dangling by his side. Feeling a courage I’ve never had before, I reached out and grabbed his hand, giving it a tiny squeeze. His eyes met mine and he smiled, giving my hand an answering squeeze.
Held in the warmth of Harry’s arms and listening to his breath as it steadied I was lulled into sleep.
“Thank you, Weasley King,” Draco replied with a smirk, earning a shove from Ron and a giggle from Hermione. He looked towards the woods and asked, “is it safe to go for a walk?”
“I know what you mean” he finally said after a while, looking at the ground as he walked. “You know, before I came to Hogwarts, I went to a muggle primary school, and there was this kid who everyone thought was gay, I think his name was Mike. Anyways, he used to get picked on quite a bit in school. Other kids would call him ‘fag’, they would throw things at him and just torment him. My cousin Dudley was awful to him, and he would tell my uncle about the ‘pranks’ he would play on Mike. And my stupid uncle would encourage him! He would laugh at Dudley’s bullying, he used to say that ‘homos shouldn’t be allowed in public’ and that they got what they deserved.” He sounded so sad and bitter it broke my heart.
“So you’ve been waiting all this time for me to come along?” I really hoped I sounded as casual as him.
Hermione and Weasley were already halfway to the portrait, but Potter stood waiting for me to catch up. Smiling, I joined him, and together we walked down to the great hall chatting about schoolwork and the latest gossip.
“I thought we were going to be more subtle around them my love? I know they’re dying to shag but we don’t have to make them feel uncomfortable about it.” And with that my other best mate Blaise joined us, proving to me once and for all why I had felt the need to expand my group of friends away from wretched Slytherins. Now don’t get me wrong, I love being (having been?) a Slytherin, but Merlin what a bunch of self-serving twats. I hate my friends.
In an instant his gut fluttered, memories stirring in the back of his mind. He felt like he had forgotten something really important, something
Harry realised with shock that Hermione was sobbing as she hugged Malfoy to herself, squeezing him so hard Harry was shocked to see Malfoy still standing. Clearly whatever feeling had taken Hermione over was reciprocated though, as Malfoy hugged her back and lifted her in his arms in an almost possessive hug.
“Potter, take my son and GO!” She said loudly. She went to Draco and gave him a last, desperate hug.
Draco’s eyes narrowing would have sent a lesser man running to the hills, but not Harry. With a grin he leant down to Draco’s mouth and covered it with his own, kissing him fiercely as he pushed into Draco in one, long stroke. When he was fully inserted, he paused to let Draco get used to being so filled.
“Father made it very clear that my unnatural tendencies, as he put it, should not get in the way of me fulfilling my duty. He said that under no circumstances am I allowed to pursue any unnatural relationships, and he has vowed to find me a wife by the summer. He believes he can ‘cure’ me, you see.” My throat started burning and I stopped myself from talking so I wouldn’t cry.
“Indeed. Can’t discount any blackmail material.” I gave him my most Malfoy-ish smirk I could muster and he laughed.
“Be careful my love. I will keep you safe, I promise.” She whispered. She gave her only son a kiss on the brow and shoved him towards Potter.
Linda signed her farewells to Draco and was let out by Harry. Harry came back into the living room to see Draco rub his eyes with exhaustion, slumped back onto the sofa.
I scoffed slightly and tried to hide my smile “We’ll be seeing each other soon, we’ve got Charms in…” I cast a quick Tempus and swore. “2 minutes, fuck I need to go.” I ran out of the door, forgetting to put any clothes on and went to my room, leaving Harry with his mouth hanging open.
I ground myself harder against Harry and whimpered with need. He licked his way to my ear and tugged the lobe with his teeth, gently soothing it with his tongue. “Gods Draco… you’re beautiful, so beautiful…” I moaned and gripped his hair tighter still, keeping him there. “You feel amazing, I need you, I want you so bad…”
“So, Potter, you still don’t like it when Slytherin beats Gryffindor?” I asked cockily, looking at my nails as if I was above this conversation.
I gave Harry a gently kiss to the corner of his mouth and separated slightly to straighten my clothes. “We always have dinner together, remember?” I smiled mischievously at him.
Dean visibly relaxed, and picked Griphook up gently, following Harry into the tent where Harry was happy to hide for the rest of the night.
Harry looked back on his and Draco’s history as he watched Draco sleep. It was never easy for them at first, their similar character traits making them prone to quick arguments. But with time and help from both their sets of friends, they got to understand each other in a way that neither had ever encountered and things moved quickly from there. Within a year they were living together, and by their third anniversary they were married. Both had changed a lot since they were kids, though their rivalry still existed, only now it was handled with love and laughter, not sneers and insults.
He remembered when earlier at the pub, Harry had whispered to Draco if he wanted to head back, just to him. And before that, when we had walked together to the village. Did Harry hang back on purpose to walk with me? Or was I really desperate enough to hope so? I smothered my face in my pillow. I definitely was a bit drunk, but clearly not drunk enough to stop thinking.
With a final touch of the fanciest pomade I owned to my hair, I turned and faced Pansy and Blaise. I had asked them both for help in choosing what to wear, though in retrospect I shouldn’t have bothered. Pansy had taken literally all my clothes out of my wardrobe and thrown them across my room – there was a large pile on my bed, a larger one still on my desk, and several piles on my floor. Blaise though was not even paying attention to us, instead he was going through my stuff as if he was looking for something more valuable than life itself. His general nosiness used to annoy the fuck out of me, but after several years of suffering him as a roommate I had gotten used to it.
