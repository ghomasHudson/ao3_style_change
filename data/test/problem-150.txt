Harry considered Neville’s words. He was right, getting involved with the Ministry would cause a lot of unwanted attention from the public, and as Neville had pointed out, the wand was now technically his if he’d won it from Malfoy. The Ministry couldn’t argue with that. He wasn’t withholding evidence if it was his wand now, right? Also Harry thought about Ron, who knew about this wand situation, but evidently hadn’t told his higher-ups about its true whereabouts, so Harry felt a little more at ease knowing Ron didn’t think it was necessary for Harry to be outed as the true owner, either.
The thought of Malfoy only slightly ruined the festive spirit for Harry. Now that he had the wand safe in his possession, he could relax. There was no way he could get it. The small possibility that his home may be being broken into at any given time still lingered, but Harry tried to ignore the concern that rose in his chest when he thought about it. The memory of Malfoy pinning him down on his bed would occasionally seep into Harry's thoughts too, particularly after a few wines, which Harry didn't appreciate.
They both got up from the desk, and McGonagall walked Harry to the door. They stood looking at each other, Harry standing a couple of inches taller than the older witch. She smiled gently at him, and put a hand on his arm.
Harry nodded, looking at the floor. He assumed Malfoy had nodded too, because the last thing the professor said before angrily striding back into the castle was,
Harry proceeded to set up a cosy little cove in front of the window - he transfigured his hard desk chair into a comfy, chintzy one, complete with blankets and extra puffy feather pillows, then went downstairs and made himself a rich, steaming hot chocolate, another plate of custard creams appearing alongside it. He grabbed a book, and then reluctantly some homework from his desk. He may as well try and get some of that done while he was sitting there. Once he had everything set up nicely, he made himself comfortable in his chair, making sure he had the clearest possible view from his position, and looked out over the lake. The wintery weather made the surface look even more glassy, and the occasional ripples hinted at the life that thrived below. The windows of Hagrid's hut were still glowing with lights, the yellow gleam of them stretching along the lawn, before fading into greyish darkness. Harry could see the frost on the grass sparkling sharply, the blades of grass around it resembling glinting needles in the moonlight. Harry looked up and saw that it was once again a full moon, meaning a whole month had passed since he last saw the figure. Speculative, Harry looked at his watch, its glass face glinting in the candlelight that doused Harry’s room in dim, warm light. The contrast between inside of Harry’s room and out there in the cold silver night was palpable. His watch read 9.34pm. It would be another half an hour before his past self had seen the figure previously, so Harry busied himself with some transfiguration homework.
Draco closed his eyes and let his misery wash over him, bringing momentary feeling back into his limbs. It was a horrible feeling, like poison running through him, making his whole body tense and sting. He took a few steps into the house, and his footsteps echoed horribly. He didn’t think, but found himself walking towards the library instinctively. A warm memory of himself on his mother's lap in front of a roaring fire. Whispered French words telling tales of brave wizards bubbled around his brain. He found himself in front of the empty dark hearth and put a hand on the freezing stone. The fire was unlit, but when he closed his eyes he could almost feel the memory of the flames warming the skin there. For a moment it was comforting, but the feeling was almost instantly extinguished by another wave of misery. Draco opened his eyes and dropped his hand to his side, wet eyes looking around the cold room. The daylight that shone through the windows was grey, washing the scene with a monochrome light, the dust particles reflecting the dull light unpleasantly, like a mausoleum that had been entered for the first time in years.
“Lucius Malfoy, Known previously for his significant influence at the Ministry Of Magic, is now due to stand trial for his crimes as a Death Eater during You Know Who’s reign of terror. He is currently being held in a high security cell in Azkaban, while his Wife, Narcissa, (left) and son, Draco, (right) are at their home in Wiltshire under Auror supervision. It is yet unclear whether they too will receive trials for their part in the atrocities. Lucius Malfoy will stand trial on the 17th of September, and the Wizengamot encourages any witnesses of Lucius Malfoy's crimes to please come forward to give a statement.”
“Are Master Harry and Master Draco finished with their teas, Sirs?” Kreacher appeared, making the two boys jump and snap their heads round at him, startled at the sudden appearance of the elf. Harry breathed, his heart pounding in his ears, and he looked at Malfoy, who’d broken the eye contact and yet another blush exploded onto his face.
Harry got the last button open, revealing Draco’s pale chest. He ran his hands over it, toying with Draco’s raised nipples, making the other arch his back into his touch.
“You do. I heard you telling Longbottom about it in the Library the other day.” Harry’s mind flashed back to that memory of seeing Draco in the library, the feathered quill brushing along his pink lip, their momentary eye contact, and Malfoy getting up to leave, then telling Neville about the wand. Harry cursed himself for not being more careful, for not checking for any prying eyes or ears. He tightened his grip on his own wand, still concealed in his pocket, his body only half facing Malfoy in the doorway. Harry's chest heaved with a deep breath, and he saw Draco’s eyes flicker over it momentarily before returning his gaze to his eyes.
And so, with a huge smile and a wave of his giant hand, which sent a gust that lifted Harry's hair and stung his eyes, Hagrid turned and walked out of the paved courtyard, and down towards his hut on the side of the sparkling, still lake.
After looking in each other's rooms and admiring the views out of their respective windows, Harry’s being the only one with a Lake view, eliciting many murmurs of envy from the others, the boys went back downstairs to join the girls in pursuit of snooping around their tower. Harry, who was now exhausted, told them to go on without him. He lingered on the small landing for a moment, feeling happier than he had been in months. As he turned to re-enter his own room, he glanced at the door of the one room they had not entered. Upon it, the golden initials “D.M” glimmered in the candle light. Harry paused, hand tingling on his own door handle, the thought of having to share a dormitory with Draco Malfoy lingering in his mind. His absence at the feast raised curiosity within Harry, but he quickly rid himself of the thought, and reminded himself that this year, he'd promised McGonagall that all would be well, no more fighting, no more rivalry, which also included no more being suspicious of Draco Malfoy. He pushed his way into his room and the solid door clicked shut behind him, marking the end of his first day of his final year at Hogwarts.
Hands now free, Harry tugged Malfoy by his belt loops and pressed his hips reciprocally into the other boys’, the pressure sending jolts of pleasure through his core. He heard Malfoy moaning into his mouth at the friction, and bit hungrily at his lip, eliciting a gasp and then a low growl, which he could feel reverberating in his own mouth, making Harry dizzy with lust. Kissing fervently, Harry's fingers unlocked themselves from Malfoy’s belt loops and push their way between the two boys’ flush bodies to finger Draco’s trouser buttons. As he ripped open the top buttons he felt Draco growing harder underneath the tight material, his own body instantly responding with a dizzying rush of blood. But as suddenly as it had started, Malfoy tore himself off Harry, their lips separated, and the warmth of Draco quickly diminished from Harry’s touch.
Harry and Draco walked through the grand entrance doors and into the cold, quiet castle. Harry would usually feel slightly uneasy walking through this place when it was so empty like this, but today it just felt peaceful. The warm feeling of having been bonded to Draco lingered over him, for the first time in a long time, he felt truly safe.
“Well...with good behaviour and regular counselling there’s a possibility it will be shorter than what they’ve agreed on.” Draco looked at her, seriously.
Suddenly Malfoy was pressing his hips forward, making a small moan escape Harry, quickly cut of by Draco's lips crashing hard into his. Harry's brain exploded with heat and a buzzing noise filled his ears, as he moved his mouth against the blonde’s, kissing him so desperately that all logical reason completely vanished. Draco's fists moved from Harry's shirt to his dark hair, grabbing handfuls of it painfully.
“You have something of mine.” Draco took another step, fully entering Harry's dimly lit room, casting a shadow behind him into the hall.
Harry slid into his comfy bed, and decided he wasn't going to tell Ron about Draco's evening swim in the Great Lake. After all, Ron had said to report back to him if he saw anything suspicious. What Harry had witnessed, he concluded, as he turned out the lights and curled up in bed, wasn't anything suspicious at all. The only thing he’d seen was a broken boy, trying to find some sort of feeling in a sea of numbness he’d sunken into.
“Malfoy. You will return immediately to the Slytherin common room and inform Professor Slughorn of the changes. Potter. You will stay here and clean up this courtyard until It has been returned to it’s original condition. Do you both understand me?”
“A weeks detention, both of you, and I swear, if I see you two so much as look at each other again, I will send you home, immediately. Do you understand me?”
“I really am glad you came back, Potter. I think you made the right choice by doing so.” Harry gave her a small smile in return.
“Malfoy...” he said cautiously, and stepped towards him slowly, like he was approaching a wild animal. He reached a hand forward and Malfoy looked at it, before leaning back and touching the table behind him.
But before Harry could ask, Kreacher turned around and paced off intently, leaving the room. Harry followed.
“What is that?” Malfoy said sharply. Burt before Harry could answer, he heard a familiar voice shouting his name from across the grounds. Hagrid was lumbering towards him.
“You promise me that you’re not putting anyone’s lives at risk, and that you aren’t being pressured or blackmailed by anyone like last time?” Harry asked. Malfoy rolled his eyes, but remained collected. He considered Harry for a moment, and then replied.
“Magic bond? Potter you bloody idiot I’m not trying to make it fucking worse.” Malfoy was standing now, gesturing with his hands in frustration. One came up to rub his eyes, and Draco grimaced. Harry stared at him, feeling confused.
“Was gonna make myself a cuppa if you fancied it. It's a bit early, I know, but I can't get used to these bleedin’ beds. I’d worn my old one in nicely over the years, you know?”
Harry considered this. He remembered how dark and murky it was in the Lake, and how inconceivably massive it was under the surface. He personally thought it would be pretty easy to go missing down there, but if this was unusual for the Mer-people, then maybe something really wasn't right.
“We’ve always been in each other's pain, don’t you think?” Malfoy rolled his eyes and slapped Harry’s hand away, a small smile escaping his lips. Harry grinned.
“No I DON’T!” Malfoy shouted and lurched forward, shoving Harry backwards and making him stumble, hitting the door behind him. Harry reached for his wand but Malfoy was on him too fast, grabbing his wrists and pressing them between their chests.
“I’ll be ok, Draco. Trust me, I promise everything is going to be ok.” She smiled, but the smile didn't make it to her eyes and Draco felt his heart break in his chest.
He and Ron took oversized seats in front of the fire, and Hagrid handed them giant steaming mugs of tea, just how they both liked them. Harry breathed in the steam, and saw his glasses fog over.
Feeling a little more satisfied, Harry finished packing, but left out one more day's worth of clothes and essentials. He’d owl Ron, telling him he would be arriving on Saturday instead, Mrs Weasley surely wouldn’t mind. And tonight he would watch the lake once more, dutifully, to make sure Malfoy was safe.
Under the headline, a sullen, broken looking Mr Malfoy stands next to his wife and son, even paler than usual under the bright flashes of cameras. He doesn't move. If it weren't for all the flash bulbs going off, illuminating their faces occasionally, you'd think it was a muggle photograph, the Malfoy’s stood so still. Harry found this unnerving, but his hatred for Lucius Malfoy prevented him from feeling sorry for him. His eyes wandered over to Narcissa, still somehow striking as always even with the look of misery etched on her face, and then to Draco Malfoy, who's expression made Harry's arm hair stand on end. He looked terrible. His eyes laid deep and hooded in their sockets, and his cheekbones were more defined than Harry remembered them being. His blonde hair was longer, and uncharacteristically unkempt. Harry began to read the article underneath the photo.
“I…” Malfoy covered his flushed face with his hands, rubbed his eyes, then hissed loudly, pulling his hands away from his face after evidently catching his fingers in the gash on his forehead. He looked at the blood on his hand, and then stretched out his arm, showing it meaningfully to Harry.
The room, to Harry's astonishment, was not at all what he had imagined the room would produce for someone requiring it for duelling. He was expecting something more along the lines of the D.A classroom they'd made in 5th year, spacious and with high ceilings, but this room had a roaring fireplace with squashy sofas in front of it, decorative adornments placed carefully around the medium sized room, and a friendly, relaxed feel about it. Taken aback, Harry froze. Perhaps Malfoy wasn't here? Maybe someone else had found the room, requiring it for some other purpose?
“Oh not too bad, mostly bin tidyin’ this place up a bit after... well y’know. Was a bi’ messy like.” Harry thought this was the understatement of the century, but smiled and nodded at the larger man. He looked around the courtyard and raised his eyebrows, impressed. The castle was practically rubble the last time he saw it, but it had been thoughtfully rebuilt to its former glory.
Turning back into the room, Harry noticed Kreacher busying himself, fussing with bedsheets and pretending to be hard at work. Harry rolled his eyes.
Harry coughed, eyes stinging as he stumbled out of his fireplace into Grimmauld Place. He’d used too much floo powder in his haste to get home and now his eyes were watering, blinding him from the excess smoke the floo had produced, along with the horrible sensation of taking the floo network, which he never had really got used to.
Harry reached for his wand and turned the paper over with the tip. The underside of the note was blank. Harry's pulse quickened and he felt fresh sweat staining his shirt. Hastily, he quickly incedio’d the parchment until it had vanished completely, and wafted the resulting smoke away hastily. A moment later, a bony set of shoulders and a pin-like head stuck themselves out between two bookcases and glared at Harry through narrow eyes. Harry sat up straight and tried to look innocent.
“When the Ministry hears you’re going back there Harry they’ll have my arse for it, they’ll reckon I encouraged you to go back so, for the record, I told you that you were barmy and going back is a massive waste of time, got it?”
“C’mon then, its bloody freezin’. Let’s go back inside, you can tell me all about your dark wizard catchin’ Ron, and i'll crack out the fire whiskey.”
He looked up at Ron grinning, but his smile faltered when he saw the twisted expression on Ron's face.
“I hoped you might pay me a visit Potter. Please, take a seat. There are biscuits in that tin there, please help yourself.” Harry glanced once more over his shoulder at the portrait of Dumbledore, who was now snoozing, or at least pretending to, in his painted chair, before stepping forward and taking the seat opposite McGonagall. He picked up his tea, which has just finished adding milk to itself, just to Harry's liking, and a custard cream from the biscuit tin.
McGonagall looked at him, eyes wide and face serious. He nodded, and looked over at Malfoy instinctively, before something stung him, like a slap in the face, and made his head whip back towards McGonagall, who’s wand was pointed directly at him. Harry’s lifted his arm, hand cupping his stung cheek, and hissed in pain. He heard Malfoy laugh cruelly, but another resonating spark of magic echoed around the yard, and he was silenced, evidently struck with the same stinging jinx.
“That doesn’t mean to say this year will be easy. NEWT’s are still extremely difficult qualifications, and will require your full attention and effort.” Harry smiled. If there was anyone who could make Harry feel like an ordinary student, it was McGonagall.
“I understand, Potter. I cannot imagine what it has been like for you for the last few months. I really am glad you have decided to finish your education this year. I also think you'll find your last year at Hogwarts a much needed break from… the public.” The Headmistress took a sip of tea, and gave Harry a meaningful look over the rim of the cup. Images of his own face on the covers of countless wizarding newspapers and magazines flashed before Harry's memory, and a surge of appreciation for the witch warmed within him.
He was sitting in the Library, the winter sun streaming through the glass windows into the great room of towering bookshelves. Harry held his quill between his fingers, and tilted his head to the side, thinking about what to write next. He lifted his gaze, searching for a distraction in the room from the monotonous task, when his eyes found him. Draco was sat on a desk three rows away, his left side facing Harry, a ray of sunlight illuminating him from behind, casting a shadow that stretched towards Harry. Harry blinked, and watched Draco, who was hunched over some papers, right hand twirling a black feathered quill, his left in a fist on his bent knee. Draco’s eyes darted over his paper, his eyebrows occasionally creasing. The light haloed Draco’s blonde hair, which had grown longer, starting to fall into his face. He blinked, a strand falling into his vision, before he reached up and tucked it unconsciously behind his ear, revealing to Harry his striking cheekbones and angled jaw. Harry swallowed. Draco sat like that for a minute, before tilting his quill towards his lips, and brushing the feather across the bottom one thoughtfully. Harry shifted in his seat a little, suddenly warm. Draco's head tilted, and Harry saw his eyes flicker up, black pupils locking with his own.
The rumbling ceased, so suddenly it startled Harry. He looked around, but the stillness lasted just a split second. The water around Malfoy exploded, launching him into the air. But he wasn't alone. Bodies, hundreds of writhing, flapping flailing limbs and tails were pushing Malfoy up, a cascade of water streaming down them. Harry was frozen in terror- they looked like… but how? Harry saw arms and heads, but no legs. Instead the bodies had tails. They were mer-people. But not the mer-people like Harry had seen in the lake before. These were skeletal, hollow eyed, rotting bodies. These were Inferi.
“You know you can ask me for anything, anytime Neville. I mean that. You’re a great friend.” Neville smiled warmly up at Harry.
Draco pushed his arms forward into a breaststroke and kicked off, swimming into the lake further. He swam gracefully, appearing unconcerned with the freezing temperature, and eventually stopped, treading water about 10 metres from the shore. Harry saw Draco, his hair damp at the base of his neck and the collar of his submerged shirt poking above the surface, turn over, his chest rising above the water, and his pale face staring up to the moon. His eyes fluttered closed, and he floated on the surface, his arms spread like an offering, illuminated by the silvery glow. Harry watched, entranced, staring at the boy in the lake. He saw how the muscles of Malfoy’s chest were exposed through the wet shirt stuck against it, and his angular face highlighted by the glittering rays of moonlight. Harry slowly took his seat again, eyes transfixed on the floating boy below him. Harry felt a concerned confusion rush through him as he watched Malfoy. For one, it was incredibly cold, it couldn’t be far from freezing, and second, there was the issue of the lake, and whatever was happening within its depths. Malfoy would have no idea of its dangers. Harrys fist gripped at the armchair, short nails digging into the material, feelings conflicting in his mind. What the hell was Malfoy playing at? Going for a swim in the lake late at night? And with no magic? Did he have a death wish? Harry thought about his odd behaviour over the last few weeks and gulped. He had been so unconcerned, emphatic and just… so alone. Harry hadn’t seen him talking to anyone. Actually, he was pretty sure the only person Malfoy had actually communicated with since returning was himself. And he hadn’t seemed bothered by it. He’d given up.
“We don’t have much time. This was only what they sent to collect me. I’m not sure how many there are now.”
A pained yell and a crash made Harry jolt awake, his chest heaving in half conscious fear. He fumbled next to him, grabbing his spindly glasses and shoving them roughly onto his face, trapping a few strands of hair between his face and the lenses. He rubbed his face and listened. He hadn't been having a nightmare had he? Harry searched his foggy memory of the dream, coming across only calm snippets of water and moonlight.
“That’s what you’ve been trying to do, isn’t it. It’s the lake. Whatever is happening inside it, you’re making it happen.” Harrys brain was whirring.
“Kreacher, can you fetch it please?” Harry said, expression painfully set in a forced smile. Without another word, Kreacher bowed, and disappeared with a crack, reappearing seconds later with a long black wand clutched between his two small fists. Harry leaned down and took the wand, and held it up in his right hand, examining it in the sunlight from the window. It was shinier than he remembered it. Cleaner. He imagined Kreacher had probably restored and polished the thing.
“The Malfoy’s, as you just mentioned, have been in custody ever since the attack on Hogwarts. Malfoy will be returning to Hogwarts wandless, and hopefully on his best behaviour, as he awaits trial for his crimes. I have been assured the boy will cause no trouble, and the reason I am telling you this is to ask you to do the same.”
What had Malfoy been up to last night? Why had he been so late? And was it him in the cloak down at the Lake?
“I told you not to follow me, Potter.” Harry finished the healing charm and looked up at Malfoy, their faces only a few inches apart. Malfoy was still covered in his own blood. He was shivering slightly, and Harry realised how cold he must be, practically naked on the side of the freezing lake.
Harry watched, perplexed, as the other boy ignored the food entirely, and turned back towards the spiral staircase. Harry wanted Malfoy to carry on, stay there, say something else. A yearning to hear his voice thrummed through Harry, a weird need that, now that had had a taste of, he now needed more. It was a strange feeling, an odd desperation Harry didn't quite understand.
“What the fuck are you doing?” Malfoy demanded, his chest heaving, red faced and bloody lipped. Harrys blood.
Draco's eyes glided down Harry’s form, taking in his arched torso, down to his flannel pyjama bottoms, legs spread over him, and back up again, settling on Harry's mouth, and a flush of heat engulfed Harry, now overtly aware of the predicament he found himself in, Pinning Draco Malfoy down on his bed. Harry felt a blossom of heat in his stomach. What the hell was wrong with him?
“Anyway, Harry, shouldn't you focus on your studies instead of rekindling an old obsession over Draco Malfoy?” she raised an eyebrow at him and he felt the flush rise from his neck up his face.
“POTTER!” Malfoy yelled, and Harry saw him, sweating and terrified, looking back towards him. Harry turned and saw a huge wave - bodies and water all tumbling together towards him. Harry didn't move. This was mad, and there was no way of knowing if this was going to work. Harry closed his eyes, and was engulfed in it, and just before his head went under, he saw Malfoy sprinting towards him. He took a last breath and then everything went dark.
Finally Malfoy broke their staring match and swept away, walking out of sight behind a bookshelf. Harry breathed out, and leant forward over his parchment. His heart hammered against his chest, the adrenaline slowly wearing off. Bloody hell. He hadn't anticipated that seeing Malfoy again would elicit such a strong urge inside him. He couldn't stay here. He needed to get this energy out, needed to go outside at least, get some air, why was is so damn hot?
Harry felt himself about to disagree with Neville, but stopped, considering his words. This wasn't the first time he'd heard someone defend Malfoy, and Harry had started to feel more sympathetic towards the boy, to his own utter surprise.
“We need to split up!” shouted Harry, seeing the Inferi closing in. Malfoy needed to draw them away.
“Merlin- bloody- owl- ERROL!” Harry spluttered, straightening his glasses and seeing a grey lump on the table, carrying a white lump, presumably the morning paper.
These were some of the questions bouncing around Harry's brain for the rest of the day he'd had such an early start to. Harry blamed it on the lack of sleep, but he felt utterly disconcerted with this new situation he'd been confronted with. Draco Malfoy was up to something. Of course, Harry had already considered the possibility he was making a big deal out of nothing, given Malfoy and his past,- but he was not exactly behaving normally, at least in Harry’s opinion. Malfoy was uncharacteristically well behaved; he was never late, didn't cause disruptions, wasn't making jokes or comments about anything, he wasn't even asking questions. Harry thought it was entirely not in Draco’s character and it was making him very suspicious. He was being too good. Too quiet. Harry could only derive that he was therefore hiding something. Harry ignored the tugging feeling in his stomach when he thought about how broken and vulnerable Malfoy had looked when he’d seen him. Someone who looks like they didn't seem capable of being up to anything evil. But all the other things he'd seen and heard about Malfoy still made him suspicious, regardless of Malfoy’s appearance. He spoke to Ginny about it after classes that evening, once again in front of a huge stack of homework, across from the common room fireplace. He asked her if she had also noticed his odd behaviour, and she frowned at him.
“Harry grinned at his best friend, and allowed himself to feel the elation he’d had when he read his letter. He was going back to Hogwarts.
“Come on, lets get some warm clothes on. I’m freezing.” Harry said, linking his arm with Draco’s, and heading towards the castle.
“Ahh, well it wasn't jus’ me, I had a load of ‘elp. The centaurs came up to ‘elp, an’ a load of witches and wizards from Hogsmeade.  The other teachers too o’course, and even the Mur-people in The Lake did their bit. That’s bin ‘orrible though, the Lake. All sorts of stuff’s bin washin’ up on the shore. Some ruddy Death Eater scum even managed to go and murder our Giant Squid.”
“Poor bloke. Have you heard about his Dad? Azkaban for life. Not that I feel sorry for him, he deserves everything he’s got for what he did. But Malfoy, I dunno. Sometimes I just feel like he got caught up in the whole Death Eater business. His dad being who he was, you know, didn’t seem like he had much of a choice.”
Harry enveloped himself in his invisibility cloak as he stepped through the portrait hole. Even though he knew he could easily sneak unnoticed around the castle these days, he didn't want to take any chances. This was not something he was going to risk missing.
Malfoy’s flush drained from his face immediately, and his eyes widened. He sat up and looked at Harry. A few moments of silence passed and Harry decided to take that as confirmation of his suspicions. He felt like an explanation was probably necessary.
“At the Battle of Hogwarts, one of His plans to defeat the Order was using the Inferi. The task to enchant the mer-people in the lake into Inferi was left to my mother, but I took the task on myself, as I didn’t think she’d survive the process. I don’t know how much you know about how that works, Potter but it’s not exactly an easy process. It’s a curse. I had to come down here and perform this sort of ritual, and I created a bond with myself and the Inferi in the lake. As long as I am alive, the Inferi stay alive. And they keep growing. At the battle, I was too much of a coward to use them. But the bond still exists. The whole time I was home I feared the Inferi would take over the lake, hurt people, and I would be exposed as the one who had cursed it.  That’s why I started coming down to the lake at night. I was hoping the Inferi would recognise me as their Master and want to kill me to be released from the curse. But it didn't work. Every time I went in the lake I was hoping one would pull me under. I didn't know what I was doing, I just knew the Inferi had to kill me themselves, but without my wand I had no way of summoning them.” Malfoy paused and looked out towards the lake. Harry followed his gaze, settling on the bodies on the shore. Malfoy inhaled, and carried on with his story.
The leaves of the trees that stood at the base of the mountains were speckled with silver light, thinning as the hills rose into vertical peaks, the rock faces shining like marble with the dewy condensation that lay upon them. Touching the velvety sky, the mountains faded into a smattering of glittering stars. It was a mostly clear night, constellations visible for Harry to gaze upon, only slightly darkened by some clouds that threatened rain coming in from the east. The full moon hung gracefully in the sky, too massive to be real.  Its light shone so brightly onto the Lake that its reflection glowed with just as much intensity, sparkling on the wet surface. Harry got up from the bed and rested his forehead on the glass window to see the lake more clearly. It really was magnificent, even more awe inspiring when he considered its danger. Harry was always wary of it, but respected and sort of admired its hazardousness, in the same way as he admired the Forbidden Forest. They weren't just habitats containing dangerous creatures, they were living, breathing parts of Hogwarts, with their own personalities and secrets. As Harry contemplated this, he saw from the corner of his window a black, cloaked figure approach the edge of the Lake, and sit down on a boulder by the shore. Harry stared at the hooded figure, perplexed. That wasn't Hagrid was it? He glanced over to the hut that stood the furthest end of the Lake, but it was shadowed, windows unlit, and the smoke seeping from the chimney was but a thin wisp.
“Calm down, calm down. I think from Malfoy's explanation he was indeed forced to perform this curse. I would say, after all he has been through, he needs no more punishment.” Replied Kingsley, and Harry stared at him. His dark eyes glistened, and he nodded once at Harry.
Harry tentatively stepped into the office. With a glance around, he noticed it looked slightly different, but wholly welcoming. Red drapes hung from the ceiling, and tartan cushions decorated the furniture. There were fewer magical instruments than when Dumbledore had resided here, but the atmosphere was very much still alive with magic. Against the furthest wall, a roaring fire was burning in the hearth, with an enormous teapot brewing itself within the flames, steam pouring out of the spout. Plenty of books lined the shelves surrounding it, the flicker of flames from the fire reflecting off their shiny leather spines. Harry turned his head inwards, and smiled when he saw the Headmasters’ portraits; some snoozing, some cheerfully waving at him. Harry's eyes found Dumbledore’s for a second, which glinted at Harry over half-moon spectacles.
How the hell had he got in here? Harry looked around quickly, to see Kreacher reappear in the archway leading out to the kitchen. He had a vacant smile on his face. Harry cursed inwardly at the elf. Of course Kreacher would have let Malfoy in. He was a member of the ancient House of Black. Harry couldn’t believe he hadn’t warned Kreacher not to let anybody in while he was away. He'd left in such a hurry, this was his fault. Harry couldn't tell if Malfoy had cast 'imperio' the elf or if he was just that old and thick that he didn’t realise Malfoy was an enemy.
“Neville, hey, everything good?” Harry asked, forcing a smile at him. Neville reached for the seat next to Harry and sat down in it. Harry kept his eyes on Neville, urging himself to focus on him, rather than the image of Malfoy and the quill now scorched into his mind. Harry straightened up, willing his body temperature to return to normal.
The burning corpses of the defeated Inferi had started to wash ashore, and Harry looked at them. Harry noticed a long object floating among them. It was Malfoy's wand, he must have dropped it when he passed out. Harry picked it up, feeling the magic closed within him with the magic of his own wand. He had an idea.
They finally reached the Hogwarts grounds, Harry a little out of breath and a lot warmer from the exercise. They crossed the lawn and walked along the edge of the Forbidden Forest until they saw the Lake and Hagrid’s Hut come into view. Harry had felt a little guilty for not having gone to visit Hagrid over the last 2 months, only seeing him in passing at meals and in the corridors- he’d been incredibly busy with studying, so felt much better now that he had a reason to pay him a visit. Hagrid would be really happy to see him, and with the added bonus of Ron too, he knew Hagrid would be thrilled.
Hermione had demanded at breakfast one morning. Harry had just sent a first years’ quill and parchment flying across the Great Hall ‘by accident’ when he’d asked for his autograph. Harry looked incredulously at her, her bushy hair bristling with accusations, before sighing and looking dejectedly into his cereal. If he told her exactly how he was feeling she’d think he was going mad. How could he say he missed fighting with Malfoy without sounding like a masochistic maniac?
“Ouch! Not so fast, bloody hell.” Ron said, passing the detector into his other hand and shaking out his catching hand in pain. He held up the object in front of him, and it made a series of strange buzzing and clicking noises, which Ron listened to intently. Harry watched this interaction felling rather envious. Ron had learned so many things Harry had no clue about. It was impressive, but Harry couldn’t help feeling like he was missing out. A few moments later, Ron pocketed the thing and looked up apologetically at Hagrid.
“I think you should just do what you think is right, Neville. Stick to your instincts. There’s a reason McGonagall made you Head Boy, she trusts those instincts to make the right decision.” Harry nodded encouragingly, and felt at ease when the corner of Neville’s mouth curled into a smile and he nodded too.
“You probably want to keep a low profile, and being Head Boy of Hogwarts isn’t exactly ideal for such endeavours.”
“I have it, Sir. Please don’t be angry, I’d found it under the bed you see. I thought you might have forgotten about it.  I held on to it because, well, Master Draco is a member of the ancient Black family, and to have something of his so close to Kreacher…” Harry set down his teacup quickly, making a wave of tea spill over the rim onto the table. He was extremely annoyed he’d been looking for hours and Kreacher had it the whole time, but he tried to remain calm.
A few moments passed, Harry’s breathing finally returning to normal. He shrugged off his backpack, which slumped open on the pebbles in front of him. Harry glanced down, and a glimmer of red caught his eye. Harry frowned and reached in, pulling out a small, snitch - like object. It was the dark detector. A rush of adrenaline pulsed through Harry, who fumbled with it for a second. Damn it, how did this thing work? He turned it over in his hands, until he spotted a small key like protrusion on its underside. Harry grasped it, turning it experimentally. It felt like a wind up mechanism as it slipped slightly when he loosened his grip, so harry wound the key until it would go no further. He paused, and remember the image of Ron whispering into his one a few months ago. Feeling a bit stupid, but knowing he had no other ideas, he brought the dark detector to his lips and whispered “find out whatever is in that lake.” Almost immediately the detector’s wings started flapping like a dragonfly’s, and forced its way out of Harry’s grip. He grimaced as he watched the object pelt towards the lake, preying Draco wouldn’t see it, but as soon as it reached the shore it dived, and disappeared into the water with the tiniest of splashes. Harry relaxed, Draco hadn’t noticed.
“‘Arry I couldn't tell ye. He just was floatin’ there on the surface. Very sad, they reckon he was here since the founders built the place. Its not just that though, It's very strange actually. The Mer-people’ve been tellin’ me some of their lot bin goin’ missin’, even now. But I’ve not found nothin’ yet that explains it. I offered to ‘ave the Mer-people moved to a lake nearby, and tha’ we could protect it for ‘em, but they’re havin’ none of it. Stubborn beings, ‘Arry. Course, you’d know all abou’ that.”
Harry moaned openly into Draco's mouth and he felt Draco’s thighs sliding under his open legs. He pulled himself up by Malfoy’s collar and straddled him, pushing his tongue deeper into the blondes hot mouth. Moments later he felt two hands pushing themselves up under his thin t-shirt, and short nails digging into the damp flesh of his back, making him gasp. Fuck, he needed more. He needed…
Malfoy was definitely up to something. His desperate attack on Harry to get his wand back seemed highly indicative of the fact that he was, indeed, up to no good. Harry sat up and looked over to his window and searched the blackness, seeing nothing but an orange reflection of the interior of his room, and his own face. Whatever Malfoy was up to, He was going to find out.
“Didn’t bloody send me a letter though, charming! When is he coming? How did he manage to get permission?”
Harry groaned. He could feel the ornate handle of the door digging into the small of his back. He shifted his hips under Malfoy’s weight to try and relieve the pressure. Malfoy looked down at Harry, watched him moving under him, and then suddenly pushed himself away. Harry watched as a flush crawled up his cheeks before he held his head in his hands, and sank into a nearby armchair. Harry felt his heart pounding and he watched the blonde. He was hunched over himself, breathing heavily, his shoulder blades poking through his white shirt, reminding Harry of the sight of him swimming in the lake, his shirt clinging to his body as he went. Harry blinked and felt a flush of his own tingling in his cheeks. He couldn’t believe Malfoy of all people could make him feel like this. The stupid, dangerous git.
Harry swelled with excitement, and looked across the table at Ginny, who was eyeing the parchment curiously, chewing own a mouthful of breakfast.
Harry frowned and pushed back his dark hair. After a few moments, he leaned back into the chair and sighed, thinking about the picture of the Malfoy’s he had seen in the prophet a few days ago. Draco did look dejected, and miserable, and without his wand Harry didn't really think he was much of a threat to the students of Hogwarts anymore. Plus, coming back to Hogwarts would mean there were plenty of eyes on him to keep him in shape if he ever did step out of line. McGonagall cleared her throat.
The days went by quickly. The lessons flew by uneventfully, and Harry tried his very best to concentrate on taking it all in. He shared all of them with Ginny, so made the most of her help, as Hermione wasn’t around to copy from or explain things to him. Ginny, luckily, was also very clever, and they helped each other with classwork. He missed Ron desperately, and Hogwarts really wasn’t the same without him, but Harry just tried to remember how happy Ron was being part of the Auror's, and that made him feel a little better.
Harry thought back to him trying to sneak a wand into Hogwarts. There must be something more to that right? Why would he do something like that? He must be up to something, he must have something he was meaning to do.
“Malfoy?” Harry interrupted. “I read in the Prophet he was being held with his mother in Malfoy Manor.”
Harry wasn't the only one staring in some lessons, particularly the practical ones. The new Transfiguration Professor had given them the particularly difficult task of transforming a desk into a Dalmatian, and seeing as Malfoy no longer possessed a wand, he could not participate. Instead, he sat at his table, quiet as ever, taking notes, copying from a textbook and paying absolutely no attention to the chaos going on around him. Even when Dean managed to transform his table into a raging half-desk half-dog monstrosity, causing panic and screams from around the room, Draco didn't even turn to look. This unwittingly frustrated Harry so much that he messed up some of his spells on purpose, just to try and make Malfoy turn around. Nothing worked however, and the blonde remained un-phased in his own unbothered bubble, much to Harry’s frustration.
The new common room was brilliant. A new wing had been erected on the south side of the castle, and at the top of it, on the 4th floor, a marvellous residence for the 8th years. It was guarded by a marble statue of an embracing couple, who, when given the password, would mournfully separate from each other, revealing a stone archway leading into the common room. It was just as cosy as the Gryffindor common room, but with an aura of maturity - there were no house colours, the walls were either stone or panelled wood, decorated with various historic artefacts from the long, rich history of the School. Old black and white photographs of quidditch matches, the players zooming in and out of the frames, moving portraits of notable alumni of the school, and, Harry's favourite piece in the room, a giant, colourful tapestry of the four founding members of Hogwarts, all intricately sewn with glittering threads to make a wonderful centrepiece over the enormous fireplace. Around a corner Harry was pleased to see McGonagall had thought to include a small dining area. He appreciated her forethought that some occupants may not feel all too keen on the idea of going to the Great Hall for meals every day. Two spiral staircases lead to the boys and girls rooms, but instead of a shared room and washroom for all of them, the top of the staircases led to circular landings with doors leading off from it, each with initials stamped on at eye level in gold. Harry had climbed the staircase of the boys tower, found the door with H.P inscribed upon it, and gripped the handle. A warm tingling sensation passed through his fingers as he grasped it, and Harry presumed this was some sort of magical security measure that recognised Harry trying to enter his own room. He imagined that someone other than himself trying to enter would have an entirely different and more unpleasant sensation pass through their hand.
“This is a dark detector. Pretty standard bit of Auror kit. you tell it to fly off and it does a little survey of the area. See its wings there? They pick up on traces of dark magic. Helps us find objects that have a strong magical aura.” Ron whispered something unintelligible, and tapped the little object with his wand and it sprung into the air, wings vibrating madly. Ron gestured his wand forward, pointing over the lake, and off it went. It was fast, almost the speed of the snitch, and just as agile. It flew across the surface of the lake, suddenly stopping every now and again and darting over a patch of lake, to then race off in another direction. Harry kept his eyes on it for as long as he could, the object familiar yet different, and he imagined himself flying over the lake on his broomstick, chasing it as it zoomed inches above the rippling water. After a few minutes, the dark detector returned, and Ron caught it as it flew rapidly back towards him.
They both arrived at the boundary where the Hogwarts wards stopped, and apperating could be performed. Harry gave Ron a sad smile, which was returned, and they embraced in a long hug, patting each other's thickly-coated backs.
“It’s our newest dark detector model. I saw you liked the last one, so thought I’d give you our latest version. This one can go underwater and all!” Ron said while eyeing the object himself. Harry turned it in the morning light, admiring the bug-like design. the body of it looked more sleek, less clunky than the one Ron had used in Hogwarts. This ones’ wings were sleeker too, smoother. Harry also noticed a small red light, like that of a camcorder, emitting from the front of the body, like one large bug eye.
It looked as if a bomb had gone off in the room. Harry looked around, bewildered, trying to remember if this really was the way he'd left it. Any piece of furniture that had storage had been emptied, drawers hung from their compartments, shelves were bare, and the floor was strewn with their entrails. Harry knew he'd searched the place, but was this really how he'd left it?
“What kind of duelling space do you call this Malfoy? Forget how to use the Room of Requirement?” Harry mocked. Malfoy sneered and gripped his want tighter.
“A drink, Master?” Kreacher croaked, his bulbous eyes looking up at Harry expectantly. Harry looked down at the old house elf and reluctantly nodded, to which the elf vanished, reappearing moments later with a tray piled with custard creams and a large floral teapot, steam seeping from its spout. He lugged the tray onto a side table, and Harry collapsed into a chair in front of it, exhausted. He’d been searching for what felt like hours. He felt a stab of guilt as he realised that he had lost Malfoy’s wand. How could he be so careless? That was a part of Malfoy, a cherished object he’d be given as a child. Harry watched Kreacher pour out a cup of tea for him, hands shaking slightly, and frowned. Kreacher was looking old. His big eyes were yellowed, the beginning of cloudy cataracts starting to appear over his pupils. Another pang of guilt struck Harry for how he'd mistreated Kreacher in the past.
He followed what he thought might be dark droplets of water left along the flagstones, until he came to a door. Pointing his wand up the doorframe, he saw in glittering monochrome the initials D.M inscribed upon the wooden door. Harry blinked and paused momentarily, before leaning in and concentrating with all his might to focus on hearing something, anything at all, before the sound of a twisting door handle behind him made him jump out of his skin. He spun around, his wand outstretched, to find a squinting Seamus Finnegan emerging from his room, a hand raised in front of his face, blocking Harry’s wand light.
This criminal act does not bode well for the young Malfoy. We tried to reach out to his Father, Lucius Malfoy, who was found guilty of his crimes only a few days ago, but we were denied access to the top-security wing of Azkaban.”
“I think you're going to be the best Head Boy and Girl Hogwarts has ever seen.” Harry said simply. Like McGonagall had said, Neville and Ginny had done an outstanding job of protecting Hogwarts whilst under the rule of the Carrow's, and Harry thought this was the perfect way to recognise all they did for the school during its darkest days. Neville's face relaxed, and he allowed himself a grin.
“I don’t know. You just- were standing there, I saw your face and it just… I didn't think, I just did what you said.” Malfoy looked annoyed. Harry felt uncomfortable, but almost immediately he felt a low rumble beneath him.
He saw Malfoy lift his head, his blonde hair falling messily in his eyes, which were glinting slightly. Harry took a deep breath and willed himself to ignore the heat rising in his chest.
“You know, when I came in and saw the state of this house I decided not to bother searching. For you to have made this awful building even more unbearable by tearing it apart I thought the activity rather pointless. You’d have either found my wand or lost it completely, considering the state of the place.” Malfoy finished his sentence by gesturing his teacup around the library. Harry admitted, looking round at the mess, it would’ve been pretty obvious to Malfoy when he entered that Harry had done everything in his power to find the wand. Harry fixed his gaze back at Malfoy. His eyes were oddly puffy, with big bags under them and the whites of his eyes were stained with red blossoms. Malfoy had been crying. Not even his snide remarks could cover up the pain that was etched onto his face. It made Harry itch.
“C'mon Harry, that potions essay is due tomorrow. you can have a look at mine if you want. Don’t waste any of your thoughts on that heartless rag.” Harry raised an eyebrow at her, surprised by her mean spirit. Ginny looked down at the dark wet trail Malfoy had left in his wake.
“If you were supposed to die then why did you fight when I revived you?” Harry said. Malfoy’s jaw tightened and he looked away from Harry.
“And why on earth would I give it to you? What do you need it for?” Harry said, shifting his weight onto his back foot, both hands now deep in his pyjama bottoms, the waistband slipping a little further down his hips. He could see Draco eyeing them, and a pleased little twist erupted within him, knowing he was starting to irritate the other boy.
One afternoon, Harry was sat alone in the library struggling to write his potions essay. It was spring, and extremely hot for so early in the season, the sun beating down on Harry through the tall glass windows between the bookcases. Harry’s foot tapped irritably, and he turned his quill in the hand that wasn't holding the weight of his head in its palm. It was too hot. Harry's clothes were clinging to his body, even wearing just a thin shirt, he could feel his sweat making the too-tight material stick to his skin. His glasses slipped down his quickly moistening face, and he pushed them back up with the end of his feathered quill. He read over the sentence he’d written, and after reading it over and over again without taking in any of the meaning, he slammed his quill down on the wooden desk and leaned back in his chair, the hand he was leaning on reaching up and tangling in his damp hair. He felt a bead of sweat roll down the underside of his chin and down his neck as he stretched his head back, before the sound of clattering dropped books made him tilt his head towards the noise. He blinked.
“Listen Draco.” She said in a whisper. “They made me a deal. If I come here, you go free. They’ve dropped your charges in exchange for my imprisonment. Shh, don’t argue with me Draco. This is the only way. You’re free, Draco. Are you listening to me?” Narcissa eyes darted desperately between Draco’s but all he could do was stand there with his mouth half open, wordless.
Harry considered this. It was true, they must have countless charges against Malfoy already, but Hermione had said in her letter to consider “Doing something about it.”
After the sorting ceremony and the always incredible feast, (Harry hadn't realised how much he'd missed treacle tart, and proceeded to have 4 helpings.) Harry and the other 8th years went to their new common room. He beamed as he watched his friends take in the new scenery, all oohing and ahhing at the incredible collection of history the room was museum to. Here and there he heard comparisons to the old dormitories (“well the library isn't exactly as vast as the one in Ravenclaw tower…” “he fireplace in Gryffindor was double the size of this one!”) but on the whole it seemed everyone was satisfied with the new living arrangements, especially with the addition of the new private bedrooms. Harry quickly learned that his guess about the door handles was correct, when a screech of pain was heard from the boys landing. The other boys ran up the stairs and found Seamus on his knees in front of one of the doors, one hand wrapped around the other.
Harry quickly ducked as the stinging jinx flew past his head, singeing the ends of the long strands of his messy black hair. Harry was in the middle of a heated duel with Malfoy in the Hogwarts courtyard, and they'd managed to draw in quite the crowd during the short space of time they'd been fighting. Harry straightened up and aimed his wand directly at the blonde’s chest, who was stood across from him, side stepping towards the fountain, before yelling ‘Flipendo!’ And watching with glee as Malfoy was thrown backwards, crashing heavily into some courtyard bushes.
The Giant Squid knew he was going to die. He could sense it, a large, dark pulsating energy was hiding deep in the Lake that wished very much to break out and consume everything in its path. The Squid had been keeping it at bay for a while, pushing back against it, but he knew that soon it would grow too powerful. He had been the guardian of the Black Lake for centuries; he had seen thousands of witches and wizards come and go from Hogwarts, had witnessed wars and battles time after time, both wizarding and muggle. But now, something has changed. The vibrations in the lake was the first sign. His intuition felt a shift in the nature of the water. From the moment The Battle of Hogwarts had ended, the Lake was still, and the Squid knew something was wrong. He spent his final weeks holding back this darkness from the rest of the Lake, trying to protect its inhabitants from the inevitable, until one day, on a moonlit night in August, the darkness engulfed the Squid. He always knew he would die protecting his home, but to be defeated so soon was his only regret. With his last breath, the Giant Squid pushed it back as hard as he could. He knew it wasn't enough. He closed his eyes, and slowly but surely, he let go, and it swallowed him. He felt himself rise, and just before the Squid gave himself over, he breached the surface of the Lake, and looked up at the moon one last time. The Giant Squid floated quietly on the black mirror, and Death took him, finally.
“Potter.” The word escaped Malfoy’s lips and landed on Harry's ears. Potter. It was gentle, careful. He was testing the name on his tongue like a toe dipped in cold water.
Harry was about to turn and head right down there himself, before he noticed Malfoy flip over, chest twisting to reveal his angular back, and saw him swim towards the shore. Harry breathed out, relieved, and watched Malfoy swim, his shoulder blades flexing under his wet shirt as his arms moved in a breast stroke. Eventually, now within his depth, Malfoy straightened up and waded, his body then pale legs emerging as he stepped free from the wet grip of the black lake. His soaked shirt clung to his body as he walked back to the boulder, at which he paused, spread his hands on the flat rock surface and hung his head. He stayed like that for a while, hunched over as if in pain, tiny wisps of cloudy breath rising from beneath his damp hair. Harry stood leaning on the glass, his own breath condensing in a fog against the pane.
“Those creatures were supposed to kill me, Potter. You’ve got no idea..” Malfoy hissed and clutched at his side. Harry quickly knelt down beside him and cast a spell over the injury. A broken rib Harry suspected. Malfoy watched as Harry focused on fixing the bone. Harry felt his gaze and tried not to pay attention to it. Harry felt the soft breaths against his hair from above him. Malfoy spoke again in a small voice that made Harry’s neck hair stand on end.
“Well then, Mr Malfoy. I expect to see you back here in January for the beginning of term. I expect you’ll be returning in the same manner?” McGonagall aimed her last statement at the two Aurors. Malfoy just remained still, eyes now downcast.
“‘Arry! Arry are you alrigh’? Arry!” Hagrid ran towards him with impressive speed, taking only a few seconds to reach them.
Harry shifted in his seat uncomfortably. He didn't need to be reminded that he was being constantly watched, stared at, and scrutinised. Coming back to Hogwarts was supposed to be an escape from all that, but now, he realised, eyes will most definitely still be on him. He looked up at McGonagall.
Draco Malfoy was stood two rows away, staring at him, a pile of books at his feet. He too looked irritated and hot. A flush blossomed over his pale cheeks, and his hair was curling slightly in the humidity. He looked furious. They locked eyes and Harry's stomach twisted oddly. Malfoy’s pupils were blown, his chest rising and falling visibly, the top 3 buttons of his half tucked in shirt exposing the gleaming skin of it. Harry formed a fist in his hand on the desk and Malfoy’s mouth tightened. There were too many people around. Harry knew that if they acted up and started a fight right now they’d both certainly be expelled. Instead, they just stared at each other, hungrily. Draco licked his lips, and Harry swallowed. He knew Draco was as desperate as he was to get his hands on him and to beat the living daylights out of each other.
“Only if you tell me what’s going on. I promise I will give it back if you tell me.” Harry reasoned. Malfoy rolled his eyes.
Draco was sat at the small table, one hand holding a steaming cup near his lips, the other one the armrest of the ornate chair he was sat in. He watched Harry walk in through his eyelashes. Harry held his gaze tensely as he stepped in, keeping his distance from the other boy. Last time they were in a room together, things hadn't ended well. He tightened his grip around his concealed wand.
“Yeah. It’s a pretty good fit actually. Saved my life during the War.” Hermione's words echoed in his head. “Maybe you should do something about it.” Something clicked in Harry’s brain. She hadn’t meant for him to snitch on the Malfoy’s. She’d meant the exact opposite. Technically the Malfoy’s had saved him 3 times, she meant for him to defend them.
sounded like Kreacher clamouring, and then the smallest of voices thanking him. A voice that Harry would recognise anywhere. Harry drew himself up and reached instinctively for his wand in his back pocket. He waited a few moments, his heart pounding, and then stepped forward, cautiously into the room.
“It is if people's lives are in danger.” Harry said, biting his lip after saying the words. He had no evidence that whatever Malfoy was up to could be dangerous, but he had more than a small suspicion that, knowing Malfoy, it was definitely a possibility. Malfoy was still, his fists at his side, and he stared at Harry, eyes darting between his own. His lips were parted, the bottom quivering slightly, the look of anger melting into fear. Harry swallowed and felt himself go slightly colder.
Harry lay on his bed, bewildered in the silence that engulfed the room. What the fuck had just happened? There was so much he needed to process, so much new information, but his mind was throbbing, a haze hanging over him. All he could think about was how Malfoy had felt underneath him, how his implied words made Harry weak. Harry had the upper hand, he was about to get the truth out of Malfoy, he was so close, and then - the image of Malfoy, wrists tied to the posts of his bed, pounded in Harry's mind, a lump catching in his throat. No. God no. Not Malfoy. He’d just attacked him for gods sake, he'd had him at knife point. Harry flopped down onto his back and pressed the heels of his palms into his eyes. What the hell was wrong with him? Harry tried to concentrate, to think about what he’d just learned. Malfoy had tried to get his wand back from Harry, and Harry had told him he had it, just not in Hogwarts. Harry knew it was somewhere in Grimmauld Place, and now he’d definitely have to find it, keep it within his possession from now on. It wasn't safe there anymore. Malfoy knew that was his home, and considering his Black family bloodline, Malfoy probably wouldn’t find getting inside the house very difficult if he attempted to break in and steal it. He’d have to go tomorrow to be safe. Malfoy had also let slip that the Auror's were coming to get him in the morning, but did not say where they were taking him. There was no guarantee he'd be under supervision for the whole of the Christmas Holidays however, so getting to Grimmauld Place and finding the wand was even more urgent. He’d go tomorrow morning, as soon as he'd seen Malfoy had been taken away. Mrs Weasley wouldn’t mind if he didn't arrive until a bit later on in the day.
with a flick of her wrist, the giant teapot floated gently towards her, and poured steaming amber liquid into their teacups.
Harry lifted his cup and blew on the black liquid, steam clouding his glasses, before a deafening SCREECH made his whole body lurch, spilling scorching coffee into his crotch. As he stood up, searing pain flashing over him, something large and feathered collided with him, sending the coffee cup flying, smashing against the wall, and Harry stumbling, only just managing to grip the kitchen counter rather than fall flat on his arse.
“Nonsense m’boy! A few minutes of lateness never rusted a cauldron. Come, take a seat. Now as I was saying…” Slughorn continued lecturing, and Harry looked around the cramped potions room, his stomach dropping when he saw where the only vacant space was. Trying not to let his contempt spill over to his demeanour, Harry approached the seat, slung his bag on the counter and sat in the stool next to Draco Malfoy. He glanced at him tentatively and waited, but Malfoy did not react. His grey eyes remained very much fixed on Slughorn, his quill in his slender hand taking notes occasionally. He was ignoring Harry entirely. Slightly relieved, but still unnerved, Harry pulled out his own note taking equipment. The lesson contained no practical element today, to Harry’s relief. The idea of having to talk to Malfoy made his heart skip unpleasantly, so he thanked Merlin that this was just a theoretical lesson. However, Harry did feel a little bit hot, overly aware and self conscious sat next to the blonde. It was extremely unusual, seeing someone who was once so full of derision and spite, insults ready at any moment to be hurled at the nearest victim, be so quiet and withdrawn. Harry was anticipating that at any moment he would hear a whispered insult in his ear, or a sharp prod of a quill between his ribs, but nothing ever came. It was highly unsettling, and by the end of the lesson, Harry was thoroughly disconcerted. On one hand, he was happy he didn't have to make unwanted conversation with the boy, especially as he knew he'd have to be polite and non-confrontational as he promised McGonagall, but on the other hand he was put at a slight unease that Malfoy hadn't said something, anything at all, or given him any indication that he was even aware that he was sat next to Harry for the entire lesson. When the bell chimed, Malfoy swiftly packed up and turned to leave. Harry watched him do so with vague confusion, and as he left, looked at the empty space Malfoy had been sat in. there was an air about it that didn't sit well in Harry’s stomach. It wasn't like Harry cared about how Malfoy was feeling, he hated the git after all. This was surely exactly what Harry had wanted from Draco for the whole of the last 6 years of his life - for him to leave him alone. So why did he feel so uneasy?
The mermaids swam in their frames, watching the two of them splashing around in the water. It was rare for them to ever see anybody in here, let alone two people. They watched and smiled, occasionally looking out of the window to the outside, where they saw the lake, stretching for what seemed like miles, as black as night, which was finally moving again at last.
“Also, do you think I’d be dumb enough to leave it at Hogwarts over the Holidays?” Harry said, knowing full well the wand wasn't here at all. His statement made Malfoy's eyes dart around the room once more. But then his gaze settled on Harry's broad, imposing figure, considered him for a moment, and then frowned.
“HEAD GIRL!” Ginny shrieked as she held the unfolded parchment McGonagall had slipped in front of her just seconds earlier.
“Scorgify.” Harry muttered, and some of the blood over Malfoy’s face was wiped away. Harry never really had perfected that spell. Immediately Malfoy lurched forward.
He grabbed a tea towel and pressed it over his crotch, and awkwardly grabbed his wand, casting 'reparo' and 'scourgify' on the mug and the wasted contents splattered around the kitchen. He returned to his seat and prodded Errol with the end of his wand, waking him up with a start.
“I’m not telling you anything until you tell me what you’re doing, Malfoy. I know you’re up to something. You’ve been acting strange all year.” Harry said, looking down through strands of hair at the flushed face beneath him. He ran his eyes over Draco, who’s eyes were wide and lips parted, startled from having been overpowered and pinned down. Moments later however, Draco's expression settled into a sneer. Harry’s stomach jolted at the sight.
Draco Malfoy stepped into the archway of the common room entrance, stony faced, and completely drenched. His blonde hair was damp, his angular face shining with slick rainwater. Harry watched as Malfoy moved into the common room, dripping water on the flagstone floor. His grey, sunken eyes scanned the room ruefully, careful to avoid direct eye contact, until his gaze eventually found the boys’ dormitory staircase, and without a single word or acknowledgement to any of the inhabitants of the common room, all of whom were now staring silently at the very damp Malfoy, he swiftly crossed the room, ascended the spiral staircase and eventually disappeared from sight. Harry exhaled, and looked at Ginny meaningfully. The fire beside her seemed to have died down a little.
“What's the point? You're wasting your time coming back here, you’ll be behind bars before the NEWT’s even start.” Silence. Harry continued, louder, frustrated.
“Potions essays and Transfiguration theory is a breeze compared to what we had to put up with last year. Plus, Head Girl responsibilities are putting way more pressure on me than homework. I actually quite enjoy doing homework now.”
“What is it master is looking for? Perhaps Kreacher can be of assistance.” Kreacher said, blinking up at Harry. Harry strongly doubted this, Kreacher didn't really do much housekeeping in his old age, but Harry decided to indulge him anyway.
“Has his behaviour been satisfactory Headmistress?” The taller of the two inquired, a bald, lined wizard, that Harry found slightly terrifying.
They both gratefully accepted the invitation and when he stepped inside, the warmth hit Harry like a engulfing wave. He looked around at the familiar room, and unravelled the scarf from around his neck. He always felt safe in Hagrid’s hut, Only the Weasley’s Burrow could top the cosy homeliness he always felt here.
The now familiar sound of marble on marble indicated someone was entering the common room, and Harry glanced over his shoulder automatically, before a cold chill froze him on the spot.
Ron yawned and dropped into a chair opposite Harry's unoccupied seat and pulled the newspaper towards him, spinning it round to face him.
“How many bloody times- Merlin, Potter I don’t need your help! I know exactly what’s going on in that lake and there’s nothing you can do to help!” Malfoys mouth snapped shut, and he blinked, eyes darting down away from Harry’s. Harry felt his pulse quicken.
“What do you think I should do? I don’t want Malfoy to have it, but I feel bad keeping it if they’ve suspected him of concealing it when he hasn’t. But on the other hand, if I gave it to the Ministry…”
Harry thanked Neville, and squeezed his shoulder as he got up from his spot in the library, feeling a little guilty that he hadn't listened to Neville's' problem more carefully, now that Neville had helped him with his own issue.
“I didn’t know it was you at first, you had your cloak on. But after that, well, I knew something funny was happening in there so I thought the figure I’d seen could be behind it. So I watched the lake. My room has a view of the whole east shore. I can see… everything.” Harry dropped his gaze as another scarlet blush appeared on Draco’s cheeks. Harry felt uncomfortably hot, feeling a sweat forming down his back, making his shirt stick grossly to his skin, his body reacting to his own embarrassing confession.
Harry trailed off, his sentence abandoned when he looked back up at Malfoy. He was looking at Harry's lips, eyes wandering over them then down Harry’s bare chest to his pyjama bottoms, which Harry realised with a jolt were hanging very loosely on his hips. “Uh..” Harry breathed, stupidly.
“Shit!” Harry hissed. Trickles of crimson blood oozed out of his index finger and thumb as he touched the edge of the paper, dripping red circles onto its surface. Harry’s heart hammered once again. It was Malfoy’s self invented charm. He looked down at the paper eagerly and saw writing emerge onto it in an elegant black script. Harry laughed humourlessly as he realised Draco had also charmed it so that only blood could reveal the message. That was some dark magic.
“You’ll do what?” Malfoys eyes glinted, dangerously. “Tie me up and keep me here until I confess? I think the Auror's would have a few questions if they found me bound to Harry Potter's four-poster when they came to get me tomorrow morning. Your reputation as a do-no-wrong hero might be slightly tarnished.” Harry's gut dropped at the mental image Malfoy had just created and it clouded his mind, and before he could react, Malfoy had lurched forward, pushed Harry to his side and jumped up, grabbing the dagger in the process, and leapt towards the door. Harry landed on his back, hearing his wand clatter on the floor down the back of the bed frame, out of reach. He lifted himself onto his elbows and watched Malfoy from between his open knees, whose arm was outstretched, dagger pointed at him as he stood in the darkened doorway. Malfoy narrowed his eyes and flicked his hair out of his face.
“Yep. It was pretty late. I was only awake because…” Harry remembered the nightmare and shivered. “I woke up from a bad dream.” Ron nodded, understanding painting his face.
“We are enemies. Remember? We hate each other. I hate you! I always have! We...” Malfoy trailed off, and looked at Harry, bewildered. Harry just stared back, getting his own breathing back to normal.
Harry swung his bag over his shoulder and copied Draco’s hurried exit of Grimmauld Place, slamming the door shut and jumping down the steps onto the street. Picturing Hogsmeade, he turned, the image of Malfoy staining his destination in his mind.
“There MUST be another way!” He shouted into the other boys face. Malfoy looked at him, confusion and fear etched onto his face at Harry’s outburst. Harry picked up Malfoy’s wand and thrust it into the others hand, and held it there as he felt each other's magic pulsing between each other. Malfoy sat up, moving in closer into Harry.
“Enough, Potter.” Malfoy cut over him, looking up at him through strands of white hair. There was an edge to his voice. Harry stared at him, confusion creasing his brow.
“Minister, I don’t think either of us really know what happened. I think I have an idea…” the minister held up his hand, and Harry fell quiet. No one spoke for a minute, but Ron and the Aurors gave each other meaningful looks, which made Harry feel slightly uneasy. A squeeze from Malfoy’s had reassured him though, and he looked back at Ron, who gave him a mournful look.
Harry’s hands were getting so sore with paper cuts that he promised himself that the next time he saw Malfoy, he was going to pay for it. But Malfoy had seen him first, sending a tripping spell his way in the corridors, resulting in Harry flying into a group of second years, who had screamed as Harry's now broad, 18 year old form knocked a good 4 of them over. Harry had lost it at that point, and turned to find Malfoy doubled over with laughter, which quickly changed to a nasty grin as he saw Harry get up off the floor and pull out his wand. A few spells later, they were battling fiercely.
“An explanation indeed, Potter. We received the signal from your dark detector and it was off the charts. We came as soon as we could. What on earth has happened here?”
“Thanks for taking care of it, Kreacher. I’m really glad you found it.” Harry said, and left the room, quickly getting back downstairs. He entered the front room, and grabbed his rucksack from the leather sofa.
“Hand.” Potter ordered, softly, as best he could with a cork between his teeth, and looked at Malfoy’s now fisted hand encouragingly. Malfoy looked suspiciously at the vial, and then at Harry, and then at his outstretched hand, before giving in with a soft exhale and reaching towards him, his fist opening to reveal the glowing ‘H.P’ burned into his flesh. Harry reached for his hand, cupping his slender fingers, sliding his palm along the underside of Draco's hand until he reached his slim wrist, wrapping his fingers easily around the circumference of it. Malfoy was colder than he’d expected, but he could feel the pulse of his heartbeat under his fingertips. The intimate contact made Harry’s skin prickle, and he hoped Malfoy couldn't feel how his body temperature had suddenly spiked. He avoided Malfoy’s gaze and concentrated on the wound, trying not to think about how close they were. The closest they’d ever been.
To which an enormous jet of water, like that from a fire hose, erupted from his wand. Harry wasn't quite anticipating the sheer power of it, evidently intensified by his fury, and was thrown backwards himself, hitting a stone wall and smashing his head against it, seeing stars. The jet of water pummelled Draco, who was holding his hands up over his head uselessly, before he came to his senses and created a huge shield, exploding the water away from him, further soaking the onlooking crowd, who shrank further away from the pair as the battle became more turbulent. White hair and uniform dripping, shirt translucent and sticking to his heaving chest, Draco laughed. Harry ceased the water spell and pushed himself off the wall, running at Draco. He was losing strength and his head was pounding but he needed to shut the bastard up. A fist connected with Draco's jaw before the other boy had time to even register Harry pelting towards him, and Harry followed him down as they fell heavily to the floor. A mad struggle ensued, before Draco pulled an arm free and collided it with Harry's nose, which spurted hot red liquid onto the pavestones and down Harry's face. Draco grabbed the front of Harry’s shirt with both fists and pushed him over onto his back, at which point Harry kicked out from underneath him, bucking the blond off-balance to land heavily on top of Harry. Nose to nose, they struggled with each other for a moment before Harry caught Malfoy’s left wrist with his free hand and yanked it awkwardly behind Malfoy’s own back, eliciting a yell of pain and forcing Malfoy forward, head butting Harry painfully as the side of his head collided with his own. He was half way through trying to heave Malfoy to the ground before a loud BANG made his head snap to the side.
“Incendio!” Malfoy shouted, and the 3 or 4 Inferi now closing in were sent flying back, screaming louder at the flames. Harry was about to thank Malfoy but he didn't have time, they were already half surrounded again. Shooting jet after jet of flame, Harry and Malfoy stood back to back, trying to hold their ground. After only seconds however, bigger and bigger waves threatened to crush them almost instantly. The lake seemed to swell and expand, Draco and Harry were having to constantly move up the shore to avoid getting engulfed by the sea of bodies and water. The Inferi seemed to have control over the liquid; a great wall of water had risen slowly, now taller than both of them, looming over the pair threatening to crash down on them at any moment.
“Then I’d say its yours. If the Ministry can’t prove he’s hidden it I wouldn’t feel guilty about not handing it in. The law is a bit messed up when it comes to wands so I doubt they’ll take it much further. Seriously Harry, I wouldn’t tell them anything.”
“Tea, Potter?” Harry tore his eyes from the painting of Dumbledore and looked at McGonagall. She was sitting at her polished desk, dressed in black robes and a witches’ hat, with her arm gesturing towards a pair of china cups on the desk. To Harry’s relief, she was smiling.
“Yes, you were right about that. But what on earth could a wandless Malfoy be realistically getting up to in Hogwarts these days? The war is over Harry. The danger is gone, there's nothing more Malfoy could do even if he wanted to. He's a sad, powerless ex-Death Eater who's just keeping his head above the surface Harry. I really don't think there's any more to it.” Ginny continued to scratch away at her parchment. Harry frowned into the roaring fire. She was right of course, but something still didn’t sit right with him. Even if Ginny was correct, and Malfoy wasn't actually getting up to anything, he still didn't like the fact he was being so… dull. That's something Malfoy just wasn't. He was arrogant, annoying, condescending. Now he was just… apathetic. Malfoy didn't even look concerned about his fate any more. He looked helpless, broken. and that scared Harry far more than any way Malfoy had behave before.
Harry loosened his grip around his wand. Seeing Draco like this made some part of his annoying brain a bit slow. Was he actually feeling sorry for Draco Malfoy? He sighed, and took a step towards Malfoy, taking his hands out of his pockets, and rubbed his eyes.
Harry jerked his shoulders, trying to get free, but Malfoy just pressed himself harder against him, this time bringing his hips forward to also trap Harry's lower half in place. Harry struggled against him, pointlessly. Malfoy laughed, and Harry felt his hot breath against his face, stinging in the places where his skin had evidently broken, exposing damp, raw flesh.
Malfoy looked from side to side and paused, before undoing his cloak entirely, and letting it fall onto the boulder behind him. He unbuckled his belt and let his trousers fall too. Harry frowned, a hot flush of confusion and embarrassment engulfing him. What on earth was Malfoy doing?
Harry yelled suddenly, pulling out his wand and sending the spell hurling towards Malfoy, who expertly blocked it, and almost instantly countered it with a wordless spell of a huge jet of yellow sparks. Harry dived out of the way, sending a wordless spell of his own back at Draco on his way down, which caught his shoulder and sent him staggering sideways. Harry yelled in triumph and got back to his feet, steadying himself against the back of a nearby sofa. Wordless magic from Malfoy? He was impressed. Nothing he couldn't handle though. He sent a hex speeding at Draco, who was also firing a spell, and the two jets of magic collided with a bang, sending red hot sparks showering across the room. Harry yelled a shout of excited glee and sent another spell whizzing towards Draco. Spell after spell, hex after hex zipped maniacally through the room, destroying the peaceful environment, turning it into the battlefield they had so desired. The two boys danced around each other, testing each others abilities, occasionally landing a spell which would send the other skidding across the wooden floor, earning the other a moment to take a breath, or laugh with victorious derision. Harry had started to sweat, and could feel a few parts of his body getting sore, and his jeans start to stick uncomfortably, but he kept going. This was exactly what he needed, and when he could make out Malfoy through the sparks and smoke of the battle, he saw him mirrored with the same flushed grin and tangled hair as himself. Panting heavily, Harry sent some more jinxes ringing, a few catching ornaments around the cosy room, obliterating them into pieces, sending bits of glass, pottery and wood slashing like razors through the air.
Harry felt his limbs getting scalded and grazed by the various spells and flying debris, but he didn't care. This felt amazing. The two boys started to get closer together as their magic started to wane and weaken after relentless battling. Harry could feel it draining out of him, his spells getting less and less explosive, less destructive. As Harry blocked a sizzle of red sparks from Malfoy's wand he noticed the other boy was getting less powerful now too, and looked just about as dishevelled as he felt.
“The Daily Prophet will have an absolute ball if you start telling stories about Malfoy no one else has heard. Don’t you think the ministry has enough evidence to put Lucius Malfoy in Azkaban for the rest of his sodding life already? I know what kind of charges they already have Harry. They're just doing this for the media fanfare. Get dirt on Malfoy to take the attention away from the fact the entire Ministry got infiltrated by Death Eaters. I’d leave it mate, honestly.”
Legs emerged from beneath the cloak, shoes touching the pebbles of the shore under which the boulder sat. The figure shifted, and Harry saw with bemusement as it toed off the shoes, revealing sock clad feet. The figure stood up, and reached for the hood of its cloak. Harry held his breath as the hood pulled back, and revealed a white blonde head, shining in the moonlight.
The realisation hit him like a brick wall. The misery inside him hardened into fear. There really was no other way now. He could finally end all of this once and for all. And now with his mother in Azkaban, there was no other option, no one to turn to and ask for help.
“Cast the bonding spell, the spell I cast when I cursed the lake.” Harry thought about the ball of fire he had been pulled into.
Harry turned around, and grabbed the door handle, yanking it open and walked out of the room towards the fireplace across the hall. He came to his belongings, coated in a thin layer of soot from the floo, and pulled open his rucksack, feeling around for the object. He closed his fist around the wand and pulled it out, looking at the black wood carefully, feeling the magic vibrate quietly under his fingertips. He liked this wand. It was a good match for him, slightly less chaotic than his own, the magic that flowed through him was more subdued, but with a lethal edge that harry had learned to wield during the war. His own wand was more full, bouncy and chaotic. This was Malfoy’s wand, after all. Harry wondered if that was how Malfoy felt his own magic within him. Sharp and deadly, rather than a ball of soft energy that Harry felt. He’d liked how his magic entwined with this wand, it was like it focused it in a different way.
Draco stood as still as a statue in the entrance. He was on his own. The Aurors had seen him inside, and then disappeared. He couldn’t feel his legs, so he couldn't walk, not that he wanted to. This place meant nothing to him without his mother here. There was no point in it.
“Merlin- Harry what in the world…” But Harry cut him off with a crushing kiss. Only for a moment did Malfoy resist, but Harry felt his shoulders soften under his arms, and he reciprocated the kiss, bringing his own arms around Harry. Harry pulled away and gave Malfoy a small smile. He looked up at the embracing couple.
“Infractus” Malfoy said, and with even more reluctance than usual, the couple broke apart, revealing the corridor to the common room. Harry and Draco stepped through holding hands. They reached the common room, where a fire lit itself in the hearth. A couple of fluffy towels were stacked conveniently on the dining table, along with two bath robes. Harry suddenly had an idea.
“...was meant to be returning to his education at Hogwarts, until magical law enforcement detected a concealed wand in his possession.
Harry pointed Draco’s wand at the boy, and sent a revival spell at him. Draco jolted and his eyes opened blearily. Harry noticed the piercing blue was back.
“DRACO!” he half spluttered into the air, looking around madly for the blonde. His eyes fell on the shore, and found a blurred body sprawled on the pebbles. Harry swam madly towards it, eventually feeling the shore and ran out of the water, his clothes clinging like ice frozen to his skin. He collapsed in front of the body and took Draco’s face between his hands. He was as cold as ice. He couldn't feel the pulse of magic he had felt before. Please, no. Harry begged. He was sure, for a second in the fire, they had done it. But he looked into the blank eyes of Draco, and his hope was extinguished as fast as the flames had disappeared around them.
“Oh right yea, Merry Christmas. yea I suppose I will be heading home then, can’t believe its come round so fast.”
Harry stood, and eyed the other boy, lingering in the doorway. His brain whirred. Malfoy looked unsure, a frown creasing his brows. His eyes were still darting around the room, searching. Searching for what?
Harry's brow creased and he stood up again, unconsciously, pressing his hand against the pane. He needed to go down there, drag him out. He was going to get sick, the stupid git. He needed to go get him, shake some sense into him.
Malfoy wasn't at dinner that evening, just as he'd also missed the previous evening meal the day before. Harry deduced this was to be the norm for Malfoy - he’d noticed all of the other 8th years were present in the Great Hall, so Malfoy would have the whole common room to himself at that moment. Harry chewed on a chicken thigh thoughtfully, picturing the pointy blond dining all alone in the room, before dropping the greasy bone onto his plate and pushing the bench out from under his knees, jostling the other two inhabitants either side of him. Neville peered up at him.
“Well… yea. I didn't tell you that on purpose. Didn't want you to be put off using it. You've always been bloody useless at asking for help, mate.” Harry laughed, and Ron grinned guiltily. Harry’s laughter died down, and he stepped towards Ron, putting a hand on his arm.
Draco Malfoy was standing in front of him, on the last step of the staircase, one hand resting on the stone of the archway, and the other deep in the pocket of a pair of black trousers. His white school shirt stretched across his torso, his. sleeves rolled to the elbow. Draco wore a look of mild surprise on his shadowed face, and to Harry's utter astonishment, he was staring right at him, his grey eyes glittering under dark lids, his blonde hair messy. Neither of them said anything for a moment and just stared at each other. It was a heavy stare and Harry lapped up every second of eye contact. Harry could see Malfoy's eyes also drinking him in. He'd not actually seen him yet, had he? Malfoy stared at Harry as if he'd never seen him before, eyes working over his entire body, head to toe. Harry shivered at the intrusion, feeling his eyes on his skin. A few moments ago Harry was ready to say anything, to aim questions and accusations, but now he felt at a complete loss for words. What did he want to say again?
“Malfoy’s wand. I have it. I completely forgot until McGonagall reminded me at the beginning of term. I won it from him during the war.” Harry frowned as he spoke. Harry felt angry with himself for not thinking about the implications that could have had on Malfoy.
“Cedric told me about it during the Triwizard Tournament. This is where I discovered the clue about the lake. The golden eggs, remember?” Malfoy nodded, entranced. He approached the edge of the bath, and he squatted down and touched one of the taps, a green jewel adorning the top. Malfoy turned the handle, and a bubbling green stream of water came pouring out of it, and a minty smell filled the air. Draco smiled up at Harry, eyes glimmering with wonder, reminding Harry of a small child. It made his heart ache. Steam started to fog the room, dulling the bright colours of the stained glass. Harry felt a strange twist of sadness looking at the mermaids in the glass. He didn't know where this guilt was coming from and a crease formed in his brow. He looked at Malfoy, who too was looking at the mermaids. He looked pale, and Harry approached him and took his hand. The feeling of guilt washed away when Malfoy looked into his eyes. Harry couldn't help the chuckle that escaped him.
A few days went by, and Harry’s life suddenly became much less interesting. There were no insults, no jinxed parchment, no tripping hexes or brawls in the corridor. Harry hadn’t seen the blonde since the courtyard incident, and although a part of him was relieved to not have to see his stupid sneer all the time, another part of him was getting restless. This year had been strange, having had come back to Hogwarts after the war and everyone treating him like some kind of hero. It was uncomfortable. But fighting with Draco was normal, grounding, and helped Harry get out the emotions that he just couldn't articulate in any other way than fighting. And now that he’d lost the only thing that was letting him feel normal, he was more pent up and frustrated than ever.
Harry blinked, taken aback. Of course, she was right. He’d completely forgotten he still had it. Harry tried to remember where he had stored it, but couldn't for the life of him remember where it was. He was a little bit blurry on the events that happened immediately after defeating the most powerful dark wizard of all time, it seemed.
Harry Potter was sat at the Weasley’s enormous, old dining table, with the Daily Prophet laid flat on its surface in front of him. He read silently, as if in a trance, eyes skimming across the words and pictures like pebbles on water, trying to find the article that Hermione had mentioned in the letter he had received from her earlier that morning. Harry turned the page, and saw in its centre what he’d been looking for.
“Ron, you never told me the dark detector sent signals to the ministry.” Harry said. Ron looked slightly sheepish.
The Auror's fingers dug deeper into Draco's arm, short nails stinging painfully. He didn’t understand why he’d been squeezing so hard, it's not like he could do anything if he escaped. Draco frowned and tried not to think of the inevitable bruise which was likely blooming over his white skin.
Harry stood across from Malfoy in the library as the shared this joint realisation. They looked at each other, mirroring the others sadness. Two boys, both whose mothers’ had put themselves in harm's way to save their only child. Whatever Malfoy was trying to do, he was doing it for her. He hadn’t thought about anything else all year, whatever he'd been trying to do. Harry saw that now. This desperation, this will to carry on, it was clearer than ever to Harry. It's why he'd kept his distance, been on his best behaviour, hadn't even looked at him. He didn’t want to get distracted. But Harry had been the last thing in the way, the last obstacle for him to overcome, and once again, Harry had put himself between Malfoy and his goal, whatever it was. And once again, he was desperate.
“Hmm… well, there is a possibility dark magic might be involved, if you’ve got no idea. Shall we go take a look at the Lake?”
“So, What brings me the pleasure of this visit? I ‘bin expecting to see you soon Harry, but Ron?” Hagrid sat down with his own mug and sipped at it, looking with raised eyebrows at Ron.
“Oh, I can't believe it Harry. Mums going to be so pleased!” Ginny threw herself into Harrys’ chest, winding him, and he embraced the Weasley, struggling to breathe. Over her shoulder he saw McGonagall give a little smirk, then drink from her goblet. Harry grinned and pulled away from Ginny and instinctively looked across the table at Neville, who also clutched a piece of parchment in his hands. However, his face was contorted with confusion rather than joy.
He opened the door to a reasonably sized room, and saw a classic Hogwarts four poster bed with scarlet bedding standing centrally against the back wall. a dark wooden wardrobe stood on the furthest wall from him with a small door leading off to what Harry assumed was a private bathroom. A simple desk and bookcase filled the nearest wall. A pair of red and gold curtains was hanging closed opposite the bed, a thin slither of light filtering through the small gap, showcasing swirling particles of dust rising in the spotlight.  Harry stepped forwards towards the window, pulled the curtains apart, and his eyes widened.
Malfoy blinked and looked up at him, jaw tightening, evidently restless of this weird interaction, and quickly pulled his wrist from Harry's grip, clutching it to his chest defensively, looking away from Harry. Harry waited, but Malfoy said nothing. He sighed and turned back into his room, rolling his eyes when he knew he was out of Malfoy’s line of sight.
Draco swallowed, and flexed his fists against Harrys chest, and Harry felt their breaths mingle together between their very, very close faces. Harry looked down at Draco's lips, which were red and beaten, and blinked.
“She gave up her life to save mine.” He said, and looked back up, glimmering eyes locking with Harry’s. He felt a sudden cold run over him as he realised what Malfoy had just said. What he had alluded to, intentional or not. Harry couldn’t help the gush of understanding and empathy he had for Malfoy. Sure his mother wasn't dead, but being in Azkaban is as close to death as one living will ever get. A life sentence there is a fate worse than death. A fate she had chosen to protect her son.
“Well I got your letter and thought it seemed a bit odd, so thought I’d swing by and ask you more about what's happening. Honestly though, its been so busy at work it was nice to just have an excuse to come here and relax for a day.” Ron admitted, and smiled guiltily. Hagrid laughed heartily.
The unpleasant feeling only intensified as the weeks went by. Harry had also noticed himself constantly looking out for Malfoy, hoping he’d see a blonde head bobbing along a corridor or in the Great Hall. Sometimes he would get a glimpse of white and something would rush through him like a hot flash of adrenaline. One time, he’d actually found him, and watched Malfoy eat lunch in the Great Hall, the ball of heat in his stomach growing bigger and bigger as he watched the other boy moodily pick at his food, his sleeves rolled up and his white hair flopping over his creased brow, before a stinging sensation broke out over his face and he looked up to the teachers table to see McGonagall looking at him with a raised brow. Harry looked at her guilty and rubbed his face, urging the stinging away, and went back to eating, keeping his eyes down, the image of Malfoy pounding in his head like a virus.
“This room works just fine.” Harry breathed, popping several buttons open. “You just didn't know that what you actually wanted from me wasn't a duel.”
“Running away Potter?” Harry looked over his shoulder into the room and saw Malfoy emerge from a shadowy spot, pointing his wand directly at Harry. Harry swallowed, and turned around to face Malfoy, his furthest hand reaching casually into his pocket where he'd stored his wand.
“...you think I should?” Neville finished, looking eagerly into Harry’s face. Harry found himself brushing his quill against his bottom lip, eyes unfocused, before looking up at Neville, humming in false thoughtfulness, and dropping his quill hastily.
“Sorry mate, didn't think.” Harry got up quickly and pointed his wand at the stain on Ron’s pyjamas and muttered “Scourgify” to which the ink disappeared completely.
Malfoy whispered menacingly into Harry's ear, his hot breath tickling Harry's hair, sending a shiver down his ribs and into the pit of his stomach.
Malfoy turned back to the staircase and ascended the shadowy spiral until he was out of sight entirely. Harry waited until he heard a latch close on the landing before he too reluctantly ascended the staircase. He reached his door, and barged in, closing the door behind him and collapsed onto his back on his four poster, arms slung above his head. A deeply unsettling feeling growled in his stomach. That wasn't the Malfoy he knew anymore. This new Malfoy was uncertain, closed off. Harry didn't like it at all. Harry lifted his hands to his face, pressing the heels of his palms into his eyes, trying to repress the image of the blonde pounding in his head.
“When I saw you go under I just… something broke in me. Somehow I knew I needed to do it.” Malfoy breathed.
“Well, maybe I could use your ‘elp. I’m flummoxed, really, I got no clue what’s causin’ the disappearances. At first I thought it migh’ be the grindylows, autumn is matin’ season like, so they do act up a bit, but they've not hurt the mer-people before. So then I thought it might be something to do with these new creatures I was introducin’…” Hagrid explained to them all his theories, but as Hagrid's explanations got vaguer and vaguer, Harry started to think Hagrid really didn’t have a clue. He strongly doubted things like “Separation withdrawal from the Giant Squid” was causing mermaids to go missing. Harry looked at Ron, and he raised an eyebrow in response. “All I know is, once the Giant Squid died, the mermaids started disappearin’. That’s the only thing I know for sure.”
Harry pulled his knitted scarf up over his chin and nuzzled his face into it. It was bloody freezing for November. Hogsmeade was topped with a thin layer of white frost, which even by lunch time, was still present over every surface. It was beautiful, Harry admitted, but the only redeeming factor of the biting cold he was currently enduring. He raised his arm, shaking his sleeve back to reveal the face of his gold watch. The hands read 1.15pm. Late. Harry rolled his eyes and re-enveloped his cold hand back into his sleeve by shaking the cuff over his wrist and crossing his arms tightly. Of course Ron was late. Harry stood waiting outside the Hogs Head, watching as the many witches, wizards and Hogwarts students bustled up and down the street. Eventually he heard a CRACK in the distance, and glanced up the street, seeing his best friend emerge from behind a group of students.
“I thought you would be Head Boy, Harry. I… I cant believe McGonagall actually chose me.” Harry felt his face go hot, but hoped the deep orange light of the Great Hall camouflaged his embarrassment.
Harry looked at the parchment in his hands. This letter that came every year for him had miraculously appeared for him again for the eighth year. Of course he was going back. He’d had countless offers of jobs from all over the Ministry, the Aurors, Curse Breakers, even the Department of Mysteries had owl’d him. But none of that seemed even remotely appealing to Harry anymore.
Harry’s pulse quickened as he watched. He’d been right. Malfoy was up to something. Of course he was. Harry internally shook himself for ever doubting his instincts.
“Maybe what, Potter?” Malfoy stood up suddenly, slamming his teacup on the table, making the whole thing rattle.
“THAT. IS. ENOUGH!” Headmistress McGonagall rushed out through the swinging front doors into the courtyard, cloak billowing heavily behind her. She looked furious. She rushed towards them and spelled them unforgivingly apart, sending the two flying in opposite directions across the courtyard, both skidding harshly to a stop.
“You think too much. I’ve always just thought they were annoying.” The eyes of the stone statue seemed to look down at Harry, irritated.
“Ow!” Harry reached a hand to the back of his head, as something had just crashed into it, and was tangling itself madly into his mess of hair. Harry leaned back and tugged the hysterical object free, and looked at it. It was the dark detector, its lights were flashing and it was making a high pitched squeaking noise, and its whole body was shaking as if it was scared.
“Shhh Ginny, you’ll scare the first years.” Harry grinned as he watched her freckled face fill with pure joy. They were sat at the Gryffindor table, the evening sun bathing the Great Hall in an orange glow, waiting for the first years to arrive for the sorting ceremony. The sun trickled in through the windows, the last warm light of the day, and shone onto Ginny’s body, setting her orange hair aflame.
Harry sat at the large gnarled kitchen table nursing a steaming mug of coffee, feeling the festive mixture of hungover and over - fed. It wasn't an unpleasant feeling, but he knew it was time for him to return to Grimmauld Place. He should really check to see if the house was ok, and then get to tidying it. He groaned and tried not to think of the utter state he had left it in before coming to The Burrow.
“Bloody hell Harry, what are you doing up? I thought I heard someone out here. lower your wand, would you?” Seamus said in a whisper. Harry straightened up immediately and did as Seamus asked, feeling flustered and embarrassed. Had Seamus seen him trying to eavesdrop on Malfoy? Seamus blinked a couple of times, giving Harry a curious look before asking,
“Oh good. You’re still alive.” Harry said, and untied the paper from the bird’s leg. He pressed the towel into his crotch some more, dabbing at the dark stains that looked more than a tad incriminating.
“Malfoy.” Harry heard himself say. Malfoy blew on the liquid in his cup and took a sip, without breaking his eye contact with Harry.
“Quick, turn off the taps!” They both scrambled around the bath, hurriedly turning taps and laughing as the water flooded the room. Once they were all off, Harry stood still and looked at Draco from over the bubbles. He grinned. Malfoy’s cheeks went a little pink. Without a word Harry grabbed the back of his shirt and pulled the damp thing over his head, and chucked it aside. He watched Malfoy watching him. Malfoy folded his arms and raised his brow. Harry’s grin widened and he undid his jeans, pulling the wet denim down and kicking them off. Malfoy didn't move.
“The Ministry.” they clinked their drinks together, the rich red colour of the port swirling around both glasses. Harry leaned back in his chair and watched the rest of the Weasley’s open their gifts.
Harry knew hatred. Hatred was slow, scary and cruel. This, whatever this was, was not born from hatred. Harry laughed at how obvious it was now. He sank to the floor, and chuckled himself into a stupor. He looked up at Malfoy through blurry eyes and cracked glasses, and his laughter doubled when he saw the dumbstruck look on Malfoy's face.
“It must be a side effect of the curse. We have to endure each others pain while we are alive.” Harry thought about this, but couldn't quite determine how he felt about it. On one hand, he felt bad for having to share his own pain with Malfoy, but at the same time he was glad that he could help Malfoy bear the burden of his own. He let go of Draco’s hand and reached up to his face, running it along the soft cheek down to the crook of his neck. He smiled.
“You think you can help everyone don’t you? You think you can just go around, saving people, winning wars and avenging the dead?” Malfoy looked furious. His hands were in fists at his side, his shoulders tensed.
McGonagall nodded, and the Aurors stepped to either side of Draco, the tall bald wizard guiding him towards the exit. Harry looked at McGonagall, her eyes wide watching Malfoy being frog marched out. She let out a small sigh, and turned, walking back into the Great Hall. Harry quietly followed the 3 men out of the front doors, into the courtyard, and lingered under the archway, watching Malfoy and the two men descend down the long path, until they were out of sight. A few moments later, Harry heard a distant CRACK, and saw a flock of blackbirds erupt like spilling ink from a bony tree in the distance. Malfoy had gone. It was time for him to disappear too.
He turned Malfoy’s wand in his hand, before holding it out towards him. The other boy looked at Harry, but did not move.
They climbed the steep path back up to the castle side by side, while Ron filled Harry in on everything he’d been up to since Harry’ d left for Hogwarts 2 months ago. Harry listened as Ron explained enthusiastically about tracking down Death Eaters, undoing curses and confiscating dark objects from questionable wizards. Harry was seriously impressed. Ron sounded like he’d really come along, he’d obviously learned so much from the other Auror's and Shacklebolt - He was on almost every single raid they’d been on, and even taken down a couple of Death Eaters himself.
He blinked rapidly and rubbed his eyes under his glasses as he straightened himself. The dark room slowly came into focus, he made out walls, the floor, the doorway...
“I won it from you, fair and square. It answers to me now, It’s mine.” Harry insisted, trying to sound authoritative. That’s what Neville had said after all, it was his now. Malfoy ran his tongue across his lips.
“We can explain everything.” Harry said, before looking at Kingsley, who had just arrived at the edge of the group. He looked furious.
“Well that's settled then. Mr Longbottom and Miss Weasley will be informed at the beginning of tonight's feast.” McGonagall returned her now empty cup to its saucer. Harry sensed that the conversation was coming to an end, so drank the remains of his own tea and copied her action.
Startled, he whipped his head towards the voice, which was emitting from a confused looking Neville, standing beside him. Harry ran his hand through his hair and blinked up at the other boy. Neville looked at Harry, then his eyes darted over to Malfoy, then back again. Harry cleared his throat.
Harry kicked around in the water, and resurfaced, opening his eyes and taking in the grey cold scene before him.
“I did not come back to Hogwarts to fight with you. I'm tired of fighting. I’m here awaiting my fate Potter. Sorry if that bothers you but I had no choice.” Malfoy didn't look at Harry as he said this, just stared at the floor. Harry was silenced, and couldn't do anything except stare at the head of the blond that stood across from him. He tried to say something, but nothing came out. Was this really all Malfoy was? No secrets, no motives, nothing? Just apathy, waiting, hopelessly?
Harry noticed an orange glow emitting from the fireplace, and saw, between hectic kisses and desperate hands reaching for forbidden places, the fire had re-lit itself in the hearth. It was like the Room of Requirement approved, and Harry buzzed with pleasure and contentment. The room knew, before either of them, this was exactly what it was needed for.
“Uh..” Harry said stupidly, before he saw Malfoy push past the elf into the hallway. Harry chased after him.
The rumble became louder and louder, until harry felt the ground shaking under his feet. He looked up at Malfoy, who was still in the lake unmoving, and felt an overwhelming sense of fear. What was going on?
Sprinting, Harry launched himself into the potions classroom, earning the response of almost every head in the class turning to look at him.
As he swiftly paced down moving staircases and along wide corridors, the moonlight glimmered on the castle walls, breaking occasionally for the torches glowing orange in their brackets. Harry's heart was beating fast, and his mind was racing with all the different hexes and spells he had learnt over the years. He didn't want to kill Malfoy, obviously, just fight with him, relieve some tension, and maybe put him in the hospital wing for a few days. Harry grinned, and rounded the corner to the 7th floor corridor, to see a doorway visible in the low light. Malfoy must already be inside. Harry stopped for a moment in front of it and looked around him, checking the coast was clear. Seeing nothing except still darkness, he pulled off the cloak and balled it up into a smaller than possible bundle and shoved it deep into the back pocket of his stiff denim jeans. He straightened his threadbare t-shirt, pushed back his hair and opened the heavy wooden door.
Harry frowned as he watched the boy go deeper into the lake until it reached his armpits, with only his wand hand held above the rippling surface. He stopped, and looked around him, his head turned from side to side, up and down the shore. As he rotated himself around to look behind him, Harry shrunk further into the shadows of the boulder, heart pounding. He was sure Draco had seen him for a second there. He grimaced, and looked slowly back to the lake, but Draco once again had his back to him. He gripped his wand, and Harry watched as he lowered it until the tip just grazed the water. A few moments of stillness, and then-
“Mr Malfoy has attempted to bring a stolen wand into Hogwarts, but as he is under investigation for his crimes involving You Know Who, he is not permitted to carry a wand. We were already on guard as he was wandless on arrest, and suspicious that he’d hidden it to avoid confiscation. Malfoy was detained and questioned this week about the incident, and continues to insist he has no idea of the location of his own wand.” - R. Lewis, Senior detective in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.
Ginny then exploded into conversation with Neville about their newly appointed statuses, so Harry looked around the hall, leaving them to revel in the good news. He recognised nearly all of the faces at the tables now, except some of the youngest students. They all recognised him too by the looks of it, many of them pointing and whispering, some waving and giggling. Harry politely smiled as he looked around, pretending he didn't mind the attention. Glancing over to the Slytherin table, he wasn't surprised to see there were only around half as many students sat on that table than the other houses. He suddenly remembered what McGonagall had said about Draco Malfoy, and quickly scanned the length of the table for a white blond head, but to no avail. Malfoy wasn’t there. Harry exhaled, and turned back around to face the other Gryffindor's.
“No. You have to just let me die Harry. Even if we killed every last Inferi, the curse would still be active, and more will be made. As long as I am alive, so is the curse.”
“They'll do a great job.” Harry looked at the reflection of the fire on the side of his teacup and thought about Ginny. They had called off their relationship when Harry had told her he felt her more as a sister than a lover. She had taken it extremely well, which made Harry think maybe she was having the same feelings too, but had been too afraid to voice them after all Harry had been through. He still loved her very much, and couldn't wait to see her face when she found out she had been chosen for Head Girl.
Harry, realising how much trouble he could get in if he was caught out of bed after curfew, hastily turned back towards the door, until a voice from across the room made him pause.
A clanging sound emitted from the other side of the gate, and a metal door swung open from the right hand wall. An Auror stepped through, leading a blonde figure behind him, who Draco recognised immediately.
Harry got to his feet instantly. Malfoy had been released? Dread filled his chest as he realised what that meant. He looked around desperately, trying to find a quill and ink, but there was nothing, so he hurriedly transfigured a nearby bread knife into a muggle pen and grabbed the Daily Prophet, rifling through it to find the emptiest space. He scrawled a note for the Weasley’s thanking them and apologising for not saying goodbye, and tore it from the paper, slapping it down in the centre of the table. He chucked the coffee-soaked towel into the sink, and hurried into the living room where his case and rucksack stood in front of the huge fireplace. Harry grabbed a handful of green powder from the flower pot, said “12 Grimmauld Place”, and threw the powder into the hearth. He grabbed his things, and without even a backwards glance, stepped into the roaring green flames.
“I’m not sure what made me do it, but the thought of you being killed by something I created was just...” Malfoy trailed off and frowned, then looked up at Harry.
“Thank you, Harry Potter, the mer-people have no words to describe how grateful we are for your help. We had no idea just how dark and twisted our home had become, nor the true scale of the number of our kind who were taken by this curse. You have done our people a great service, Mr Potter.” the mer-man bowed his head, and Harry could only mirror the gesture. It wasn’t worth trying to explain it was actually Malfoy who had saved the lake. Kingsley cleared his throat.
“I always hated this statue. When I was forced to come back here it felt like it was mocking me, making them separate for you to walk through. It was like it was trying to show me just how much my actions and my involvement with the Death Eaters had torn people's lives apart, for me to walk forward. And then, once you're out of the picture, they come back together, happy again at last, now that the bad guy is out of the way.” Harry looked at Malfoy, and then, not being able to help himself, threw his arms around him, sending the blonde stumbling backwards.
How have you been? Hope Hogwarts isn't too boring without me. That’s why I’m writing to you actually. It's about Hogwarts, Hagrid sent me an owl not too long ago asking how I was, and he said something funny was going on with the Lake, Mer-people gone missing or something, and the Giant Squid carked it? I was gutted about that, remember when Seamus fell in and the Squid rescued him? Anyway, I thought that was a good enough excuse to come and visit! I know it's probably nothing that Hagrid can’t handle himself, but I’ve convinced Shacklebolt to let me go just in case it's caused by something dark leftover from the Battle. I’m coming this Saturday at 1, Flooing into Hogsmeade, fancy coming to meet me at the Hog’s Head?
Bloody hell. He’d barely slept. Harry glanced back into his dark room, and knowing that he would never get back to sleep now and wake up in time for classes, closed its door and followed Seamus down into the common room for a very early cup of tea, attempting to leave all thoughts of Malfoy and the Lake on the dormitory landing.
“Unsettlingly so.” McGonagall said, not attempting to hide her concern. Harry was relieved to see that he was not the only one who’d been unnerved by Draco’s initial quietness, but now he’d seen beneath Draco’s façade.
“Accio Malfoys wand.” He heard a small splash and something hard smacked into his shoulder. Harry reached behind him and picked up the black wooden wand. He waited. Suddenly a surge of the magic he was so used to now sparked through his hand up his arm, and pierced his heat with a warm, sharp jolt. Malfoy sat up, coughing and spluttering, and Harry’s face broke into a huge grin.
A torn piece of paper floated underneath Harry's nose, making him jump. It landed gently on top of his essay, and Harry looked up to try and identify the sender. His eyes scanned the book cases, but no one was there. He blinked back down at the blank parchment and reached to turn it over.
The two of them stepped up to the broad wooden door of Hagrid’s home, and Harry knocked on it loudly, to which several booming barks emitted from inside the hut. Ron and Harry smiled at each other. Heavy footsteps sounded from behind the door, before it swung inwards, revealing a curious looking Hagrid peering down at them. His expression split into an enormous grin of recognition as his eyes flitted between them.
Harry knew he had to go, leave right this instant. Harry looked around the room, and haphazardly grabbed his bag. What else did he need? Thoughts whizzed around his brain but nothing seemed to land. The only thing he could hear pounding in his head was ‘Malfoy. Protect Malfoy’ over and over again.
Harry appeared with a pop at the top of Hogsmeade, only slightly losing his balance on the steep incline. He had decided against taking the Hogwarts Express to school now that he was a fully legal wizard, and could apparate close enough to the school. It also meant he wouldn’t have to deal with the crowds of people clamouring over him like every other time he stepped out into the public wizarding community.
He lurched forward, hand outstretched, running towards the gate which his mother was trapped behind, but a sudden blast of electricity made him withdraw his hands with a shout of pain before he could reach the metal, and a shimmer of magic rippled across the space in front of him. Draco’s chest heaved as he stared at his mother through the bars. He had never seen her look this dishevelled. Her hair was down, the usual blonde curls absent. Instead her hair fell matte and dull. Her usually piercing eyes were clouded, and the lines of her face were deep. Malfoy felt a lump rise in his throat and he blinked through the tears that were threatening to spill out. He wanted so badly to reach out to her, hold her in his arms as he had done so many times before and tell her everything was going to be ok. He couldn’t stand seeing her like this. He felt his heart break.
“I need it.” He said, a little louder. His chin was raised, and he looked at Harry with a meaningful glare. Harry's pulse quickened a little. This was the most fight he'd seen from Malfoy all year. If only he could make it last longer, get the real Malfoy to emerge through this strange veiled version of himself.
The next day Harry woke early, just after dawn, and dressed quickly in the morning sunbeams that filtered in though his bedroom window. Malfoy hadn’t said when the Auror's would be coming to take him away, so he thought it a good idea to rise early, just in case. Grabbing his wand and pulling on his invisibility cloak, he left his room quietly, and made his way down through the chilly castle corridors to the empty entrance hall, where the great wooden doors stood firmly shut. Harry looked around into the Great Hall, and saw at the edge of the Gryffindor house table Professor McGonagall standing alongside two taller cloaked figures, talking inaudibly. Harry watched them for a bit from underneath his invisibility cloak, until he heard the bell tower chime. The three adults gave each other significant looks, and McGonagall strode towards the entrance, making Harry flatten himself against a wall near a suit of armour.
“I don’t! I mean, I do, but not here- It’s not here.”  Harry said, desperately. Malfoy froze, a flash of panic in his eyes.
Harry looked at the window next to the mantlepiece, watching the rain thrum against the glass. He pondered for a moment about what Malfoy could’ve been doing for the last 7 days, but was quickly brought back to the room by a swat on his arm.
“Come get it then.” Harry said. There were a few more seconds of stillness, until eventually Malfoy slowly stepped forwards, closing the gap between him and Harry until he was in front of him, staring at his wand between them. Harry’s hand shook slightly as Malfoy slowly reached up, fingers brushing Harry’s slightly as he took the handle, magic tingling between their hands as the wand was passed from wizard to wizard. Malfoy took a breath in at the sensation, and his eyes widened as he lifted his wand up in front of him, looking at it, drinking it in. Harry knew that feeling, to finally be reunited with your wand- it had felt like a lost limb when his was broken. He watched Malfoy, watched a small smile creep across his face revealing white teeth, accentuating his already angular face, lighting up his eyes. Harry’s stomach twisted and turned and he begged for the sensation to stop. Malfoy had looked pale, withered, but now somehow he looked warmer, radiant. The power of magic. He looked at Harry, running his tongue over his lips and considering him for a moment, eyes running over his body, making Harry feel exposed and way too close to the other boy. For a moment Harry wondered what Draco was thinking. It looked as if he was half tempted to hug Harry, or hex him, Harry couldn't tell. They both looked intensely at one another, neither of them knowing exactly what to do next. Something inside Harry urged him to reach out to him, feel his magic against his skin again, something about it gnawed away at Harry's insides having felt it in that moment. Being this close to Malfoy wasn't good for him, it was dangerous, but god he wanted it. He looked at Malfoy’s neck, pale and soft, it was so close, all he'd have to do was to reach his hand up, push it forwards and up into the blonde hair…
“You should've stayed home, kept Narcissa company, seeing as your good for nothing Father isn't there to-”
“No! Mother- Mum!” Draco said, losing his composure, and the vice like grip of the Auror's hand was suddenly around his bruised arm again, tugging him away. He watched, breathless and with the pain of a dagger stabbing his chest as his mother shrank before him, his neck twisting unnaturally over his shoulder to see her for as long as he could. He blinked, feeling tears rolling down his cheeks and off his chin. Before they hit the floor there was a loud crack, vanishing Draco and the Auror from sight, leaving behind 2 dark teardrop stains on the stone floor.
“...can see the damage its ‘ad on the shore an’ all.. Ah, Harry, Ron, Minister! Glad your'e all ‘ere, I just managed to get ‘old of the mer-people, this is one of them seniors, Dale, and he's representing the mer-people.” Harry watched as Dale rose slightly from the water, glistening skin and muscle revealing itself from the darkness.
Draco opened his palm and looked down at the mark on it. The burn was still visible, H.P branded into his skin. It was time to get his wand back, and reclaim himself.
“I thought I was keeping you safe.” Harry said, defensively. Malfoy stared up at Harry angrily again.
“We will hold them off until then, Malfoy lets go!” Harry grabbed Draco’s hand and strode towards the lake.
“Yea, Christmas.” With a final wave goodbye, Harry watched as Ron turned on the spot, and disappeared from sight with an ear-splitting CRACK. The empty space where he stood was dark, glimmering with moonlight and traces of magic.
They came even closer, and Harry looked into Malfoy's burning eyes, passion still seething on his face. Malfoy made an obvious swing of his wand arm, evidently about to cast another spell, but Harry quickly disarmed him, instinctively, and sent Malfoy's wand spinning high into the air behind him and it clattered on the floor among the debris. He looked at Harry furiously, pausing for a millisecond, then pounced forwards, swinging his fist into Harry's wand arm, the contact making Harry growl in pain and drop his wand. Malfoy took Harry by the front of his shirt and shoved him backwards, stumbling with him until Harry's back hit a wall painfully. Harry tried to grab the back of Draco, but Malfoy pinned his shoulders down heavily with his forearms. Malfoy leaned in to the side of Harry's head.
“Potter.” Harry paused at hearing his name escape Malfoy’s lips, and turned to face him. He’d stepped into the room, just slightly, one foot inside the threshold.
The house elf appeared suddenly in front of him, wearing a tea towel over his shoulder and carrying a steaming pot of tea.
“Hogwarts… well, I got a job haven’t I? I don't need to do NEWT’s. And neither do you Harry, everyone wants you in the Ministry.”
The lack of any sign of Malfoy going for his usual trip to the lake disconcerted Harry. What reason would Malfoy have to interrupt his routine? Especially now as the majority of the inhabitants of Hogwarts had left, and sneaking out would be much easier than usual? Harry watched, and thought, a frown creasing his eyebrows. Maybe Malfoy had left earlier in the day, having been escorted by Auror's, perhaps. Harry guessed it wouldn’t be too outrageous to assume they didn’t want Malfoy getting the Hogwarts Express back with all the other students. Now that Harry thought about it, that could be the only explanation, and actually made a lot of sense. He’d come here under Auror supervision, of course they’d take him away in the same manner. Harry sighed, annoyed at himself for staying under the false hope of seeing Malfoy again. Not hope, he corrected himself. He was just looking out for him. Nothing more. Harry couldn’t help feeling slightly disappointed as he got up from his seat, and stretched, his muscles burning pleasantly as he moved, de-stiffening as he removed himself from his watch-out. He paced over to his bed in the darkened room, tired clouds blossoming in his brain and making his mind hazy. Draco’s pale body swam through his thoughts as he pulled open his duvet and slid into the cool bed, his naked torso sinking into the soft furnishings. His eyes fluttered shut as he imagined Draco’s ever lengthening hair falling over his eyes, which looked up at Harry through dark lashes, and something in Harry fluttered oddly. He didn't have time to question it however, because a thick wave of sleep crashed over him, and he was unconscious within seconds of his head hitting the pillow.
“There must be another way. You were forced into this Malfoy, you can’t die because of this.” Harrys voice was raised. This wasn't fair. Malfoy wasn't trying to hurt anyone, he was trying to fix this. The low rumble was getting louder, and Harry started to panic. Draco didn't move. Harry fell onto the ground before Malfoy and grabbed his shoulders.
“We can dispose of them ourselves. I have arranged some of our men to transport the dead to our burial grounds to be identified and put to rest. Please do not feel this duty is yours to burden.” Kingsley nodded and looked back to his team of Aurors.
“Do me a favour then Harry, I know it's probably nothing, just a rogue curfew-breaking student probably, but just keep an eye out? Even if it's just for the next few days, and let me know if you see anything suspicious.”
Harry looked at her unconvinced. She crossed her legs and tucked a strand of orange hair behind her ear. The light from the fire beside them flickered against her pale skin. Even though they were not dating anymore, Harry found it hard not to be impressed by the soft glow of her prettiness.
“You were watching me from your bedroom every night like some personal lifeguard?” Draco scoffed again and shook his head, disbelief painting his features.
The rest of the day passed in a haze for Harry. He didn't sit next to Malfoy in any of his other classes they had together, but he was consistently ignored by him regardless of where in the room they were both located. He found himself paying less and less attention to the lessons, and more and more attention focused on the blonde as the day went on. Malfoy looked only slightly less dishevelled in person that he did in the pictures Harry had seen in the papers. His hair had grown unruly, falling in strands over his ears and down the back of his neck. There was a gauntness about his face - reminding Harry of Sirius when he’d just escaped Azkaban. Harry wondered if Malfoy had been to Azkaban yet, whether this was just a general trait of those who’d been there. Harry also considered this might just be Malfoy getting older, losing the boyish roundness and inheriting the Black family bone structure. It was strange to think that the Malfoy’s were related to the Blacks, but Draco’s face described the family line perfectly through his cheekbones. They were particularly noticeable during their Herbology lesson, where a ray of sun had filtered through the glass ceiling of Greenhouse One and struck Draco directly on the corner of his face, putting his cheek into sharp relief against the bone, his hair also glowing as if from within. In this moment Harry realised he was staring at Malfoy, and hastily looked away. Why was he just sitting there, every lesson? Why did he seem so… broken? Harry had anticipated him being moody, argumentative, full of anger, but this Malfoy just looked and acted as if he'd given up. And for some reason, this did not please Harry as he thought it would have, it just made him sad. Malfoy was once full of spirit, albeit a pretty unpleasant, mean spirit, but now he was acting like a dementor had already sucked his soul out of him.
A crumpled figure knelt before him, head bent, obscured by a hooded cloak, with one slim arm clutching the other in what looked like an agonised embrace. As Harry's wand light illuminated the figure its head slowly raised up to make grievous eye contact with Harry. Harry blanched.
“Swear to me you won't let them take you.” Harry stopped and looked at Draco seriously. He wasn't going to be tricked into Draco sacrificing himself. Malfoy said nothing, but before Harry could push the point further, something cold and slimy had wrapped around his leg. He let go of Draco’s hand, and felt a warm feeling he hadn't noticed was there leaving his body. He looked down. The Inferi had crawled out of the water, dragged themselves along the shore by their bony arms and one was crawling up Harry’s leg.
“Merlin, Harry, how did I not know about this place?” Malfoy said, gazing around the room. Harry walked over to the taps and leaned over, turning the faucets so that water spilled out of each of them, all the different colours and smells swirling together in the bottom of the pool.
On Christmas morning gifts were exchanged excitedly, and after Harry had opened his usual collection of knitted garments and baked goods, Ron passed him a small box with a red ribbon adorning it. Harry looked up at him quizzically.
“Good. now. I Just wanted to inform you of a few things before you get started. Obviously you are my first choice as Head Boy-” Harry’s choke interrupted McGonagall’s sentence, and he quickly gulped at his tea to clear his throat.
“Sorry Hermione I just… I’m struggling at the moment. I think I need to be alone. Sorry.” Harry got up from the table and strode out of The Great Hall, without looking back at Hermione. She would never relate to how he was feeling. Harry thought the war might have just broken him. Why did he need some sort of conflict To feel normal? He frowned as he considered the illogical nature of it all. A pit of something churned in his stomach, uncomfortably.
“Wake up. Draco wake up.” Harry spoke, gentle but desperate. Everything around him was silent. Not even a breeze. Harry leaned over Draco and felt hopeless. He pressed his forehead against his chest and felt a sob escape his lips. The sobs came as freely and as painful as he'd ever felt. He was sure this would work. Harry lifted his head and a thought crossed his mind, and a small flame of hope relit itself in his chest. Malfoy had sacrificed himself, yes, but Harry was still alive.
“You’re too late. We defeated them, there’s no danger. And will you please not point your wand at Draco, he’s the one who broke the curse.” Harry aimed his last statement at the bald wizard. The Auror did not move. Ron, having recovered his breath, stood back up, and looked incredulously at the blonde.
“Harry! And - Ron, Cripes what’re you doin' back at Hogwarts? Oh, come in come in, get down, Fang, you must both be freezin’! Come in, sit by the fire and ill make yer both a cuppa.”
Christmas at the Burrow was as good as Harry had always known. Warm fires roared through the topsy-turvy house, laughs and chatter constantly echoed through the rooms, and he enjoyed spectacular home cooked food from Mrs Weasley. It was cosy but chaotic all at once, and Harry noted how this combination had always been unique to the Weasley household. Harry spend the days mostly in front of the sitting room fire, stroking Hermione’s cat with one hand (She had left in in the care of the Weasley’s while she was away, much to Ron’s annoyance) and nursing a glass of wine or another festive beverage in the other, trying his best to stay out of Mrs Weasley’s way after unsuccessfully offering his help. Mrs Weasley had looked utterly offended when Harry had mentioned helping, so Harry decided his politeness wasn't appreciated and resigned himself to a comfy spot, somewhat relieved.
The view from his bedroom window was breathtaking. He could see all the way down into the grounds. There was Hagrid's Hut, sat squat on the lawn, oozing blueish woodsmoke from the chimney, and the Great Lake lay glimmering before him in the afternoon light. He could see along the whole eastern shore of it, the tiny waves crashing into the border of pebbles that surrounded the vast body of water. He imagined himself late at night, watching through his window from his bed as the giant squid came up for air in the moonlight, but then remembered dejectedly about what Hagrid had told him earlier that day about it having been killed after the battle. He scanned the shore of the Lake to see if anything had been washed up like Hagrid had mentioned, but saw nothing but thousands of pebbles and boulders, and the occasional splash of water on the rocks. He turned away from the window and looked happily into his cosy room. He flopped onto the bed and breathed in the smell of the fresh, yet slightly musty sheets. He was home, at last.
Harry opened his eyes slightly and saw a pile of cushions surrounding them. Harry smirked into Draco's kiss and leaned his whole body weight onto Draco, making the pair fall back into the soft cushions. Harry pulled off him momentarily and Draco eyed around him, raising an eyebrow at the new addition of several pillows. He looked up at Harry, who grinned down at Draco, straightening up slightly to fully straddle him and tear impatiently at the rest of Draco’s shirt buttons that were stiff with sweat.
“You’re ability to squeeze yourself into everyone’s affairs is utterly unbearable Potter, it is none of your fucking business what may or may not be going on.”
“I think you'll find the last time I was suspicious of Malfoy it turned out that I was right. He was up to something, remember?” Harry mirrored her eyebrow raise, and Ginny sighed and leaned back into the comfy cushions of the sofa.
Not a single movement. Not a single sound. Not a flicker of a shadow or a distant echo to indicate there had ever been anything more than complete stillness here. Nothing to suggest this had once held a family, however unhappy it was.
McGonagall bellowed in her thick Scottish accent. Harry shot a glance at Draco, who was on his side leaning on one arm, breathing heavily, completely soaked with water and Harry's blood. His wet hair fell over his eyes, and he sneered up at McGonagall. Harry grimaced seeing his own blood smeared across Draco’s face. Draco ran his tongue over his bottom lip and retracted it, tasting Harry’s blood. He looked at Harry, and shot him a dangerous smirk through tendrils of wet hair. Harry felt a weight in his stomach and spat out some of the blood that had pooled around his own mouth, maintaining eye contact with Draco.
A figure, cloaked and unrecognisable, slipped into Harry’s vision, emerging into the window frame from the bottom right corner, evidently having come from the castle. Harry started, and leaned closer to the window, his heart beat quickening. No way. He watched as the figure repeated the journey they had made the last time Harry had seen them, and sat back down on the same boulder as before. Harry looked up into the sky, the clear night showing off the beautiful constellations of the stars up above. Harry looked back down. It wouldn’t rain this time. Maybe he’d get more time to watch the figure and work out what on earth he was doing, or even who it was.
“Ron, I just remembered, I don’t know if its really important but I saw someone a while back go down to the lakeside late at night - I watched them from my bedroom window, I have a view of the lake from up there, and I happened to spot someone - they were sat there for ages, not moving, until it started raining and left.” Harry paused, considering if he should tell Ron about his suspicion that its was Malfoy, but decided against it. He didn’t need telling from a second Weasley that he was probably jumping to conclusions. Ron raised an eyebrow.
Hogwarts Board of Governors has decided to offer all students who did not complete their N.E.W.T studies last year an additional year of study to complete their magical education and sit their examinations. Students who accept this offer should send their reply with the owl delivering this letter. If you do decide to return, attached is a list of supplies and books you will need depending on which subjects you decided to study in your 6th year. Term starts as usual on September 1st. All 8th year students will have a shared living space, separate from their house common rooms. As adults, we expect mutual respect and cooperation with the other students from different houses during your final stay at Hogwarts.
“Feel sick.” Harry mumbled through a mouth stuffed with chicken. He swallowed, wiped his lips with the back of his sleeve and climbed over the bench, ignoring the baffled faces of his friends looking up to see him rapidly exit the Great Hall. He wasn't exactly sure what he was doing, but the last 2 days of Draco Malfoy pointedly ignoring his entire existence and acting like a ghost had lit a fire of burning curiosity inside of him, which he couldn't figure out how to extinguish. He wanted Malfoy to do something. Say something at least. And getting him on his own seemed like the only way of doing it.
Harry turned back into his bedroom and spelled on some of the dim lights. Harry suddenly remembered with a lurch of panic his view of the lake, but as he looked at the window he was relieved to see the light in the room made it pretty much impossible to see outside. Harry, relieved, and thanking himself internally for having tidied his room earlier, strode over to his trunk, rummaging through its haphazardly packed contents until he heard a glass clink, and pulled out a handful of vials. He searched the labels for the one that read, in Hermione’s perfect cursive, ‘Dittany.” He saw in his peripheral Malfoy slowly getting to his feet, and stepping cautiously into the light of Harry's room. He remained silent, and Harry looked up to see Draco eyeing into the room, expression unreadable. Harry felt himself getting slightly warm, the impossible truth of Malfoy, Draco bloody Malfoy, entering his room. What was he thinking? The absurdity of it all made Harry's stomach churn. Harry tried to focus on the task at hand. Malfoy had tried to get into Harry's room. He must have thought he'd gone home for Christmas. What on earth could Malfoy be up to trying to get in here? And now Harry was acting as if nothing had happened. Finding the correct vial, Harry vowed to get the truth out of Malfoy.
Harry ran up the moving staircases 2 at a time until he got to the floor of the dormitories, and strode down the corridor, until he came to the statue of the embracing couple.
The three of them stood in a line, facing the still lake at its shore. There was a cold breeze, making the edge of the water lap at the pebbles and dirt that bordered the body of water, but the surface remained still like glass. Harry stared out into the vastness and felt a bit stupid. How were they going to find out if there was any dark magic in the lake? He glanced over his shoulder at Ron, who was rummaging in his coat pockets, eventually pulling out his wand, and a small object Harry didn’t recognise. Ron noticed Harry’s intrigue and held it up for him to see clearly. It looked a bit like a snitch, but it was silver, and had a flatter body and dragonfly-like wings.
“You’re going to pay for that one, Potter.” Malfoy said in a familiar drawl, which made Harry’s heart skip a beat, and adrenaline run through his body. Malfoy started to undress quickly, and Harry deciding this was a good time for a head start, swam in the opposite direction. He heard a huge splash, and the wave engulfed him from behind. A second later, he felt two arms wrap around his shoulders and pull him under the water. Water filled his ears, and air escaped his lips, the sound of the underwater wrestling match making a strange distorted bubble of noise. His feet touched the base of the pool, and he pushed up, forcing them both through the water and above the surface, he took a deep breath and pulled Malfoy in front of him, and they both burst into fits of laughter, their hair wet and tangled and covered in bubbles.
“A wise choice, I whole-heartedly agree. I have already decided Head Girl will be Ginny Weasley. Those two were a great testament to the school during the dark times.”
Ron stalked into the kitchen, black ink splattered all up his left pyjama leg. He looked exhausted, and annoyed.
“But..” Neville's eyes scanned the page, back and forth, and then flickered upwards to connect with Harry’s.
“Harry!” Ron jogged the remaining distance between them and slammed into Harry, tipping him off balance in a crushing hug. Harry wobbled on his feet and laughed, a plume of cloudy breath rising above them. Ron pushed Harry out of the hug and looked at him grinning. “Missed you, Mate.”
Ron gave a last wave to Harry, before hurrying after the Aurors back up the hill towards the exit of the Hogwarts grounds. Hagrid was deep in conversation with a couple of mer-people, and Harry knew he wouldn't mind if he and Draco slipped away too.
“I have some dittany in my trunk, that sorted out Seamus last time. Well, it didn't get rid of it straight away, but it stopped the orange glow at least.” Harry paused for a second, considering the boy beneath him, wondering if he was about to make a huge mistake.
Harry looked at the parchment - it was half full of words in an untidy scrawl, and a long line of ink trailed from the last written letter.
“Same goes for you pal. Any time. Oh! By the way, Merry Christmas Harry. I guess you’ll be heading home this weekend too.” Harry paused and looked at his watch, the two inner circles revealing the date to be 20/12. Crikey. It was the Christmas Holidays soon and Harry hadn’t even realised. He’d been so busy with NEWT preparation, homework, and...
Something large and brown suddenly swooped in through the open kitchen window, dropped two envelopes on top of the newspaper, hooted, and perched itself delicately over the fireplace next to the Weasley’s floo powder pot. The boys picked up the envelopes.
‘S’fine. It was a rubbish report anyway, can't do anything the morning after a raid. What did you need my stationary for?”
Harry stepped towards the blonde, pocketing his wand and uncorking the dittany with his teeth. Malfoy’s gaze drifted back to Harry, watching his actions, uncertainty painting his face. He watched as Harry stretched out his hand holding the dittany, and held out his other, now wandless hand, gesturing for Malfoy’s injured hand with flicking fingers.
“Give. Me. My. Wand. Potter.” Draco said in a growl between heavy breaths. The sharp point dug deeper into the soft curve of Harry's neck, making him stretch his head back and push his face into the sheets. Harry cursed himself for letting his guard down. What the hell had he been thinking? The point of Draco’s dagger was starting to sting significantly, and he felt sharp nails digging into the skin of his chest from Draco's other hand.
“Accio clothes.” Harry muttered, and the folded clothes on the boulder flew over to him. He unfolded the cloak and held it out. Malfoy eyed it, as if to deny it, but took it reluctantly and pulled it over his naked shoulders. Harry sat back, and looked at Malfoy.
“Well can I just make something very clear. The only way you can help me, Potter, is by giving me back my fucking wand.”
“Just a little thing from us at the Ministry. I reckon its a bribe for you to join the team, but don’t think of it like that.” Ron said. Harry chuckled, slightly disbelieving the fact the Aurors had decided to get him a Christmas present. Harry pulled the end of the ribbon, watched it unravel, then lifted the lid. He reached inside and pulled out the small object, recognition dawning over him.
“Right!” Malfoy immediately blasted a hole through the Inferi in front of him and ran along the shore. The effect was immediate; the Inferi moved like one in his direction, only the ones directly surrounding Harry stayed to kill him. Harry blasted them away and chased after the herd, and tried to think of a plan. He cast his mind back to the cave with Dumbledore. They couldn't even be defeated by Dumbledore; he'd only managed to hold them off in order for them to escape. What could he possibly do to break the curse entirely? Harry sent fire jets at the Inferi as he desperately reached all corners of his memory for anything to do with dark curses. The Inferi were alive because Draco was alive, but to break the curse, something in Malfoy had to be sacrificed. This felt familiar, and the beginnings of an idea were forming in Harry’s mind.
“I know, but Malfoy didn't have-” he was cut off once again when he heard a high pitched scream, and they all looked towards the lake. One by one, slimy, scaly heads were appearing above the surface of the water. All of which started screaming when their mouths breached the air. The sound was unbearable, and got louder and louder with every head joining the chorus.
Filled with a renewed energy from spending time with Ron and Hagrid, Harry returned to his dorm happily, and checked the clock on his wall. He would keep his word to Ron, and stay up late tonight, just in case the cloak figure returned to the lake. After today's inconclusive detective session however, Harry doubted very much they were connected to the mystery of the lake. Even so, Harry was wide awake, and didn’t really mind spending his evening looking out over the stunning grounds from his warm bedroom.
The orange evening glow shone in through Harry's window, illuminating his trunk which was open at the foot of his bed. Harry was working his way around the room, picking things up, considering them, then either putting them back down or tossing them into his trunk. He came over to his desk, now completely buried under mounds of papers, and got to organising it. Piles for things to keep, stuff to throw away, and stuff to take back home. He came across a letter, turning it over to scan the handwriting. It was Hermione’s. Harry went to toss it into his trunk, but hesitated, and instead pulled the letter out of its torn envelope, and unfolded it. It was nice seeing Hermione’s handwriting. His eyes scanned the parchment and came to rest on Malfoy’s name, neatly written and capitalised. Hermione had implied he should consider defending him and his mother, as they’d both saved his life. Not so long ago Harry had thought this was absurd. But now, having seen Malfoy in the flesh, seeing how defeated he was, hearing Neville’s opinion, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea after all.
“Ah. There you are.” Harry followed McGonagall’s gaze up the corridor and saw Malfoy, stony faced and cloaked, pacing quietly towards the four of them. He wasn't carrying any luggage, except for a leather satchel which hung from his shoulder.
“Can Kreacher fetch master a drink? A nice cup of tea for Mister Potter?” Harry ignored the house elf as he rummaged through the dresser of his bedroom in Grimmauld Place. Where the hell had he put the bloody thing? He’d already torn apart the front room, searched the shelves of the library and gone through every single piece of furniture in his bedroom. It was nowhere to be found. Harry yanked open the last drawer of the dresser, revealing a pair of old shoes, some parchment, and a battered tin sewing kit. Frustrated, he slammed the drawer shut. Why couldn't he have actually tried to organise this place before he’d rushed back to Hogwarts? He’d managed to cancel all the magical spells and wards in the house with help from Ron and a couple of curse breakers, so why couldn't he have found the time to at least try and sort out all his possessions? It wasn't like he owned much. Harry stretched his neck side to side irritably.
“‘Arry?” A familiar booming voice brought Harry out of his thoughts, and he turned around, a grin appearing across his face.
“Your mother, she… took a life sentence so you could go free.” Harry said, eyes on Malfoy, who’s own eyes quickly darted to the floor.
“What am I doing?” Announced Harry. “You're the one who started it! You kissed me!” Harry panted, leaning heavily on the wall behind him. He stared perplexed at the blonde, who stood before him, looking furious, his trousers half opened. Harry couldn't help the jolt of lust that rain through his groin looking at the dishevelled blonde. He finally understood why fighting with Malfoy had felt so good.
A huge pulse of energy rippled outwards from Malfoy, the water forming in waves emitting from his body. There was a deep, bass-y thud, and a wall of heat hit Harry, making his eyes water. Harry’s grip tightened on the boulder. A few moments later, all was still again. Harry stared, waiting. What had Malfoy done? He was still stood in the lake, still as always. Harry didn't move.
He stopped when he reached the three visible wizards, looking up at the tall bald man, expression blank. However, Harry didn't fail to notice Draco's hand tighten slightly on the strap of his satchel. Harry smirked.
“Alright Aurors, let's get a move on. We might even still get in another raid if we hurry up!” Kingsley bellowed.
“I don’t know about you Malfoy but I normally take off my clothes when I have a bath.” Harry looked seriously at Malfoy, before pulling down his boxers, kicking them aside and in one swift move, jumped with an echoing “whoop” into the bubbles. A huge splash later, Harry resurfaced, the warm water burning his skin in the best way. He squinted and rubbed his eyes under his glasses, and saw Malfoy, completely soaked from Harry's entry into the bath. He laughed at the sight of a furious, soaked Malfoy. It was uncontrollable. He could feel Malfoy’s annoyance pounding in his chest but that only made it funnier. Harry swam to the side of the pool and rested his head on his chin, looking up at the other boy. He smiled innocently as his laughter died down.
He flicked through the paper absently. The news had been very quiet over Christmas, so he wasn't expecting anything interesting. He turned the pages, until a photograph of a familiar blonde boy made his heart race and his temperature rise.
“I am extremely pleased you chose to return to Hogwarts, Harry. I was certain I would get no reply from you, and find out you had taken a job at the Auror Office. I wonder why you have chosen to come back here, rather than pursue that path? As I recall, that was the only thing you were interested in as a career choice.” The Professor eyed Harry over her glasses, but in a kind, almost motherly way. Harry took a sip of tea and thought about what he wanted to say.
“Um, ok then. A wand, I’m looking for a wand. I brought it back here after… you know. When I moved in.” Harry said.
“Why am I alive?” Harry blinked, and turned around. Malfoy stiffly pulled himself onto one elbow and looked seriously at Harry. Harry didn't know what to say.
Harry decided not to wait up to hear when Malfoy returned. If it was anything like last time he'd be waiting a while. It was probably quite a task getting back into Hogwarts unnoticed without any magic, which is probably why the return journey was so lengthy, Harry thought. The issue of what to tell Ron churned in his brain as he undressed, preparing for bed. He caught a glimpse of himself in the wardrobe mirror as he pulled on his flannel pyjama bottoms. He looked at his bare shoulders, and how they flexed with more muscle than Malfoy’s had done when Harry had seen him emerge from the lake. Harry thought about how both of them had changed so much from the scrawny, immature boys they’d once been, how they were now fully grown adults, with a hell of a lot more history than Harry had anticipated they’d have at this age.
“I did want that, Professor, until I actually spent months chasing and fighting dark wizards. I think I've had enough of that, at least for the time being.” Harry paused, and bit on his custard cream. He didn't know what else to say. He didn't really want to tell her all the reasons, like the fear, the self doubt, the need for feeling like he belonged. However, looking up at McGonagall and seeing her serious face soften, he got the feeling she knew what he meant.
“YOU DID IT!” Harry bellowed, and grabbed Malfoy’s wand arm, thrusting the wand into his hand once more. The magic exploded between them like an electric shock, and Malfoy’s eyes opened, looking at the wand, then up at Harry. He searched his face for a moment, before throwing himself into Harry and kissing him, knocking Harry backwards onto the shore. Harry pulled Malfoy closer and felt the heat between them warm his whole body, deepening the kiss as if it was all that mattered in the world. Everything he wanted to say, he said in this kiss. He felt Malfoy’s breath tracing his features, their bodies fitting perfectly together despite the cold damp clothes separating their skin which Harry longed to be removed. Malfoy pulled back, his pupils blown, a look of pure relief on his pointed features.
“Never mind. Kreacher, just… Find Hagrid. I think he's away for the holidays but you’re good at finding people- find him just like you found Mundungus. Tell him to go to Hogwarts, and tell him Harry says the lake is more dangerous than we thought. Go! Now!” Harry gestured Kreacher away with his hands. Kreacher blinked, the old house elf looked confused, but he eventually bowed, and vanished once more.
“Baths ready!” He announced, and saw the huge bubbles rising from the floor, threatening to topple over both of them. Harry yelped when he felt his socks getting damp.
Malfoy moved his wand free hand to rest on the surface of the water, as if feeling it for vibrations. Harry felt something. He looked around him as a low rumble started to become audible. The vibration slowly grew stronger, and Harry watched in bewilderment as the pebbles on the shore clacked against one another, the low rumble now accompanied with the pebble’s chorus of noise.
“We’re here.” The Auror halted and finally released his grip on Draco's arm. Draco rubbed it, and flexed his shoulder while he took in his surroundings.
“I'm guessing it means if one of us dies, the other dies too.” Harry said, simply, looking back at Ron. “I think we will manage.” Harry smiled at Ron, who was now shaking his head, like he couldn't comprehend what Harry was saying. Kingsley stepped forward, and placed a large hand on Ron’s shoulder. Ron looked up at him mournfully. Kingsley gave him a small smile, and Ron sighed, looking down at his feet. Harry felt he could explain everything later over a tall glass of fire whiskey. Harry looked at the bald wizard, who still had his wand pointed at Malfoy.
“Malfoy, look. If you just told me what’s going on, maybe I could help-” Suddenly all the wind was knocked out of his lungs and he was launched backwards, until his calves hit the bed frame painfully and his back slammed down onto his sheets. A sudden intrusion of a cold sharp point was against his throat and a very heavy weight was on his hips, trapping him. Harry blinked through watering eyes to see Malfoy straddling him, pinning Harry's arms painfully down at his sides with his knees. Malfoy’s face was hovering inches over his, his hard fast breaths warm against Harry's cheek.
“I need you to go to Hogwarts. Find McGonagall…” but the words died as he spoke them. If Malfoy really had done something terrible and she found out, he would be expelled from Hogwarts. Possibly even incriminated for his involvement. Harry shook his head. Harry couldn’t allow that to happen.
“Somebody had to win.” Harry retorted, spluttering slightly, realising his mouth was starting to taste of blood again. Malfoy pulled his head back slowly and looked intensely at Harry, and Harry at him. He noticed Malfoy had a pretty deep cut severing his eyebrow that was oozing dark red blood into his hair, which was dishevelled and curling, sticking to his brow where the blood soaked it, and his face, neck and top of his exposed chest were gleaming with sweat. Malfoy was pressing hard on Harry's body still, and grinned, maintaining his eye contact with Harry.
“You read correctly, Potter. However, his Mother insisted on him returning to Hogwarts as he is still entitled to finish his education, just as you are.”
This is what they did to each other, Harry thought. How can one person make you feel all of that passion out of hatred? It just wasn't possible.
“As much as I enjoyed this little play fight Potter, I must now insist you stay the fuck away from me. Unless of course, you decide to do what is right and return to me what’s mine.” Draco's expression settled into a dark, warning look, and he disappeared behind the wall. Harry heard him opening his door and almost immediately heard it slam shut again.
“Look at this. They're asking for evidence against the Malfoy’s. I wanted to write a letter to the department of Magical Law Enforcement.”
“I said not even a look. Gentlemen. You are now to proceed with the rest of the year as if the other doesn’t exist. I will amend your class schedules accordingly so you will no longer have any lessons together. This has gone far enough.” McGonagall shot icy glances at each of them.
It was still very early in the morning, Harry had wanted to set off before most people were up and about, and in plenty of time of the other students arriving. He also wanted to talk to McGonagall before everything got underway. He felt like he owed it to her, and thank her for allowing him to return. Harry began the long walk up to the castle from Hogsmeade, first passing the shops and pubs of the high street, then ascending the winding path up towards the castle, which he eventually saw looming above him as he reached the top of the hill. It stood as grand as ever before him, the tall towers and spires stretching into the sky, and at the base of it, the Black Lake glimmered in the morning sunlight, stiller than Harry had seen it in a long time. It looked almost like a mirror, with shadows of life hidden deep beneath its glassy surface. Harry continued on until he reached the courtyard, and stopped in front of the old castle doors. They looked the same as they always had, but on closer inspection Harry could see the cracks and scars they had acquired during the Battle of Hogwarts, the legacy of spells and debris that pummelled the castle evident on its old surface. Harry reached out a hand and felt the ridges of the wood, remembering everything that happened that night. He hadn't been back since, and felt a pang of guilt for not being here for the restoration.
