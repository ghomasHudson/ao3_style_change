“Draco?”
“I’m not a fucking woman,” Draco snapped.
“I do,” Harry answers, picking up the mug and hiding his smile behind it while his heart performs painful summersaults in his chest. They lapse into an awkward silence. Draco is clearly embarrassed by his suggestion that they would do this again, though Harry isn’t really clear on why that is. Because he would very much like to do it again. Lots of times. He would go so far as to say that he would be very happy to do Draco exclusively for the foreseeable future. He might even be open to dinner dates and other such things. But Draco’s embarrassment makes him doubt the likelihood of any of this happening. Maybe he has changed his mind. Maybe he has only said the things he said in the heat of the moment. Maybe… But his thoughts are interrupted when Scorpius walks into the kitchen.
“Can you just come over here and let me be mean to you?” Draco asked, making big eyes at Harry.
As if classes by themselves weren’t hard enough, every eighth-year student has to help in the reconstruction of the castle. So, he basically spends his whole day either in class or outside helping Longbottom and Professor Sprout fixing up the greenhouses. His evenings and more often than not his nights are spent in the library studying.
I just thought a shorter update was better than none. (Work is killing me, but I still wanted to update)
Granger doesn’t return the next day. It is Luna Lovegood who comes into the art room just after his measly lunch. He is hungry and irritable and what he really doesn’t need is to feel like a piece of shit for having been part of the crowd that held Lovegood in his basement. Lovegood, however, doesn’t acknowledge that they have any kind of bad history between the two of them.
He realizes with a start that he is nowhere near the library and groans at his own stupidity. He has been so lost in thought that he has apparently walked straight past his destination. Looking around, he isn’t quite sure where he is. There are almost no portraits on the walls and the torches seem to be farther in between because the light seems dimmer here than in the rest of the castle. For a second, he wonders if he should feel scared right now. The castle isn’t fully restored yet and there could be residual dark magic lurking behind every corner, especially in the lesser used parts of the castle. He contemplates turning around and heading back to wherever he came from, but that’s when he hears it.
His eyes travel to Potter’s cock, that lies heavy and leaking on his flat stomach. It looks painfully hard, the head almost purple in colour, like he has been hard for days.
“We kissed and I thought, this is it, this is what has been missing,” he continues bitterly. “And when he asked me if he could fuck me, I said yes, and it went downhill from there. He perfunctorily prepared me and let’s just stick with I didn’t enjoy myself very much even before my ex-wife walked in on us.”
As time goes by, Draco often skips group therapy and paints instead. He still has to suffer through his one on one sessions, though. And lately Therapist Schmendrick has taken to telling him all kinds of stuff. Draco might be mute momentarily, but he isn’t an idiot. He sees through Schmendrick who is obviously trying to annoy him into speaking. He also doubts Schmendrick’s abilities as a mind healer for surely it is evident that Draco will speak as soon as there is something that needs saying. Even though, he doesn’t know how long exactly he has been here, he knows that it is not good that he still refuses to communicate with the outside world. After all, he is not stupid. He knows he should probably make a bigger effort, but it can hardly be his fault that, even after the war, the English language hasn’t evolved enough to supply the words he needs to express himself. There simply are no words to describe what he has been through. What he has seen and done, what has been done to him. But he also remains sure that words will come, when there is something worth commenting on. So, he doesn’t worry, even when he can tell that Schmendrick worries.
Today is different, though. He feels like he is making progress. He has one regular visitor and even though they do not talk per se, they communicate on some level and that has to count for something. Just yesterday Potter reacted to his little gestures and shifts in expression just as if Draco was actually answering him. He also doesn’t zone out as much as he used to during his therapy sessions. Although he wishes he would. Because, damn, therapy is stupid and especially so, when your theraprat doesn’t know what to do with you anymore.
“Ew! Ron? Really Draco!? Ew! Just… ew,” Potter splutters and after a few moments he breaks out into incredulous laughter. The corners of Draco’s mouth twitch a little, but he struggles to remain stern-faced.
“Aunty Hermione?” Al called through the floo.
“No! I need to knot someone, not be knotted. It’s not right. I have proved myself,” he whispers, new tears falling down his cheeks.
, he thinks bitterly,
“Let me go, Draco, please,” he begs, voice high with panic.
Potter says stuff like “Oh, that one is cool.” or “I like this one.” but Draco shakes his head every time. Let Potter think that the clothes aren’t up to his standards, he thinks. Unfortunately, Potter sees straight through him, and how exactly the otherwise thick git does it is beyond him, because after a while he says, “We’ll take them all.” Draco grabs his arm again, looking at him pleadingly and shaking his head.
“Of course, you are. What have I ever done worth mentioning? Threw a couple of
“We do not have to do this. I can take you back to St. Mungo’s now,” he says and Draco knows that he would follow through without blinking an eye. He wouldn’t even complain. But he can also see that Harry is disappointed. Not at him, but he has wished for Draco to go with him and the thought of going alone is disappointing. So, before he even knows it, he shakes his head.
“So? To what do I owe the pleasure?” she asked.
The next day Potter doesn’t show up and even though it is dull, Draco is glad because Potter sure as hell isn’t the only one who is pissed off. How dare the Prat insinuate that he doesn’t care about his recovery? Of course, he cares. He wants to get out of JTW, he really does, but he just isn’t ready yet. And if Potter cared at all about him, the way he so often likes to claim, then he wouldn’t pressure Draco, then he would accept that healing takes time. He is able to leave this part of their conversation behind pretty quickly.
Instead, he retreats into himself, into a distant memory of an afternoon spent in the Manor gardens, the last summer everything was fine. They had just caught word of Barty Crouch Jr. fleeing his prison and his father had been in an exuberant mood. He had gifted his wife with a new diamond necklace and his son with a new racing broom. They sat outside, eating sandwiches, laughing, talking, taking the broom for a spin. Even his mother had tried and he remembers wiping tears of laughter from his eyes as she awkwardly climbed onto the broom, both legs on one side and hovered about three feet above ground. It was probably the most fun she had had and the most she had let go of the etiquette governing her life since she had been a child. They had been happy then. He chooses to remember them like that.
“No, I didn’t!” But he did, didn’t he? He saw Scorpius in the mirror and as soon as he saw that white blond hair his mind had gone straight to the gutter, conjuring up all the filthy things he would like to do to him. Except he didn’t want to do them to Scorpius, he wanted to do them to Malfoy. And, of course, that is the moment that his mind decides to not so gently remind him of Malfoy’s current state of undress, which his cock definitely takes an interest in, if the sudden tightness of his trousers is anything to go by.
“Not all change is bad. It’s going to be different and you’re going to be a great father,” Draco said.
When the door opens and Potter steps inside, he freezes in the doorframe for a second. “Fuck, Draco,” he croaks and quickly closes the door behind himself. Draco has pulled his shirt up, so that Potter can see his chest and stomach and lets one hand travel down, past his nipples, squeezing one of them lightly, his breath hitching, while his other hand is still on his cock. With every stroke he pulls the foreskin taut over the swollen head of his cock and little beads of precome run down the shaft. He flicks his thumb over one of them unsure whether to use it as extra lubrication or, well fuck it all to hell why not, he raises his thumb to his mouth and tastes it, his eyes never leaving Potter’s. He can see him swallowing and palming at his crotch. Draco takes his cock back into his hand, while the other still travels lower and when he arrives at his cock he switches hands and lets the well-lubricated hand that he has formerly been stroking himself with wander down towards his entrance. He circles the firm rim of muscles for a few seconds, before he pushes one finger inside himself.
They had reconnected roughly two years after the war. Immediately after the trials, facing no charges thanks to Harry’s testimony, Draco had left the country. He had travelled all over Europe for a year and then gone to New Zealand. They ran into each other when Draco had been visiting his parents for a couple of weeks before heading to the States. Harry had been getting coffee at a new place on Diagon when he spotted a bright blond head of hair that could only belong to one person. He had burned the roof of his mouth, too distracted to be careful of his hot beverage. By the time they stood face-to-face, Harry was coughing and his eyes were watering. He must have been so attractive.
Lucius winked. He threw his cane across the room where it landed just so and hung itself on a hat rack. He began to sing, “OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH,” and an uncontrollable smile began to creep up Harry’s lips as he watched.
“You saved me,” Harry said, hushing him with a finger to his lips.  A single tear rolled from his eye. “Thank you.”
Harry and Ron were chowing down on spotted dick and treacle tart when Ron brought up what had happened in class. “Oi! I right reckon I be aces about you hafin’ sex wif blokes, but of all the barmy trouser-snake ticklers, you ought to go wif MALFOY?!”
“Okay… well, umm, well… Professor Trelawney thinks that I have the Sign of the Chode, but I don’t want my first time to suck!” whispered Harry.
Harry’s face went stern. “Trelawney said me having sex could lead to - not one, but
For sure, I swore that I’d break down your door
She breathed deeply and collected herself. “A Blowgart is a shapeshifting creature that takes the form of whoever the observer wants to blow or be blown by.”
“Now Draco, I can’t.” Lucius said sternly.
“Totally!” Harry agreed. They high-fived and laughed at the idea of Neville ever having sex (or mysteriously becoming hot) for nearly twenty minutes. When Harry finally caught his breath, he said, “Well, I guess there’s nothing to worry about then.”
“Don’t you dare foot-fellate that student, you harlequin!!!”
“I’ll have you know that the accidental spell where he swapped his ass with his elbow was an honest mistake!” Harry ejaculated. “And anyway, why are your feet like that?”
Harry was too busy playing with his Tamagotchi to notice what Lousy Lucius was saying.
A frenzied clone of Draco Malfoy sprang out from the canvas bag and lunged for Harry’s meat puppet. Gasps broke out across the room.
Draco bowed his head, ashamed, and marched his Buck Beak slippers to his bombastic bed. “Yes father!” he called.  Then, he looked at Harry and whispered, “I’m sorry, he becomes cockney when he’s tired.”
I’ll fuck up his face worse than Voldemort’s stitch,
A lone clap came from Neville which immediately stopped after he realized no one else was clapping. Peeves dropped a ghostly mic and floated away.
“Well, you communicated then, if that’s better with you.” She crosses her arms in front of her chest and looks at him.
“I love you more,” Draco answered.
Draco doesn’t know how long they have been sitting in the closet, when he hears footsteps approach on the other side of the door. He tenses for a second, but Potter murmurs, “I’ve got you.” And Draco believes him. The door swings open and although he cannot see him, he knows it is Schmendrick.
“N-no,” Draco stammers and Harry has to take a second to compose himself, for he doesn’t want the smile that has spread across his face to be audible when he speaks, lest it might scare Draco off.
“I am sure,” he said, smiling softly at Harry. Of course he was sure. He had known that Harry secretly wanted to name the baby James or Lily, because he had rejected each and every name that Draco had brought forth and had been either reluctant to share his own suggestions or brought forth names that were so outrageous that he must have known that Draco would reject them on the spot.
The degree to which Malfoy is equally turned on and embarrassed by what he is asking of Harry, combined with his inability to say it out loud, makes Harry wonder. He pulls him even closer, so that his bum rests at the very edge of the bed and guides his feet up, so that they are resting on his shoulders. He whispers a wandless cleaning spell, that nearly makes Malfoy jump out of his skin. Then he spreads Malfoy’s cheeks gently and looks at his pink hole tensing up, just as the rest of his body, as Harry softly blows on it. Well, certainly that can’t be true, can it? It would be far too good to be true, but he asks anyway.
He is glad when Theo suddenly says, “So, Quidditch anyone?” and shoots his former house mate a grateful glance. Most of the occupants of the table get up enthusiastically. Only Harry stays behind by his side.
“I’m so sorry,” Potter says reaching out for him. He stumbles back, evading his touch. He is glad in that moment that he has put his pants back on. Potter looks ridiculous. He notices it even when this strange emotion clutches at his chest.
“It’s going to be fine, Harry,” Draco answered with fond exasperation in his voice. With the pressure on his bladder gone his outlook on life was way brighter than it had been five minutes ago. He looked up at Harry, who had started to pace back and forth along Draco’s side of the bed.
“Sush,” Harry makes, sending Scorpius off into another fit of giggles. Urgh, drunk children, Harry thinks. Although, at 21 Scorpius certainly isn’t a child anymore, however much Harry feels like he is.
By some miracle, enough conscious thought returns to him at the sight of the state that Potter is in that he manages to keep himself from tackling the other boy to the ground and ripping his clothes from his body. A voice inside his brain growls at him to do it anyway, to sink his cock between Potter’s cheeks, to stretch, to bite, to own. It would be so easy. He can see that Potter wouldn’t be able to fight him off, but maybe he has really changed, because he just kneels before Potter and gazes at him, making a conscious effort to let his outstretched arms fall back to his sides. It is harder than anything he has done in his life.
“He’s so small. How will we manage not to break him?” Harry asked no one in particular.
“Well, we could be other things at some point in the future.”
“Kind of alright? You came for about a minute straight there,” Draco replies.
He realises that Harry has not been wrong when he said that Mr Weasley is a great cook and soon the mountain becomes smaller and smaller. Unfortunately, just as soon he is stuffed and struggling to clear his plate in an effort to not be impolite. Most of the others have already pushed their plates away from themselves, clearly indicating that they have finished eating. Draco wishes he could just do the same, but he doesn’t want Mrs Weasley thinking that he would turn up his nose at her cooking, which must be very much in line with her view of his character, so he soldiers on. Everybody is looking at him by now and he feels beyond uncomfortable, because not only does his stomach feel like it might explode at any moment, but also is he the sole centre of attention.
“Pick me up at seven, the address is 12, Grimmauld Place.” He leaves Draco’s flat, deciding to walk, enjoying the crisp late-morning air on his way home.
When Potter realizes that Draco has stopped fighting him, he lightens his grip a little, but he keeps whispering in Draco’s ear and rocking him. They sit like this for a long time. Potter eventually shuts up, but he doesn’t show any signs that he is going to let go of Draco. At some point, he calms down a little, the sobbing ceases, but the tears keep falling silently now. He rests his head on Potter’s arm, which must be soaked by now.
A couple of days go by and Potter doesn’t return. Draco doesn’t know how often Longbottom visits his parents. Considering that they haven’t been able to be real parents to him and that he cannot really have any memories of them of the time they were still able to, he thinks that Longbottom probably won’t visit too often. He takes comfort in that. Every day that the Prat doesn’t show up at breakfast, he breathes a sigh of relief.
Finally, he makes to leave. Draco is relieved when he gets up from his chair and rights his clothes.
“You said, ‘First of all,’ so I’m guessing that there’s at least a second, if not a third and fourth,” Harry mocked. Draco elbowed him softly, too tired to give Harry what he really deserved.
“The thing where you touch that spot,” Harry tries to clarify, blushing in embarrassment while looking into Draco’s eyes, unwilling to back down from the unspoken challenge.
“Yes to that,” Harry answers and the smile is audible in his voice. They don’t speak for a while. Both of them dazed by the intensity of what they have just experienced. Draco absentmindedly begins to caress Harry again and the other boy hums contentedly as he snuggles deeper into the embrace.
“I just…,” he begins his sentence and breaks off which as Draco has noticed is a tell-tale sign that he is nervous about something. “I thought that knotting me meant something,” he continues in a rush.
“Oh, you’re so full of it, stupid wanker,” Potter growls and slaps Draco’s shoulder. But when he sees Draco snickering quietly, his lips begin to twitch as well. He gets up and pulls Draco with him. They stand face to face and the moment their eyes lock, all the mirth is swept away in a wave of misery. Draco’s eyes fill with tears again and he slumps forward against Potter. He scoops Draco up as if he weighed nothing and with the quality of the food at JTW that might just be the case. He contemplates resistance, but he has no strength left for that, so he just lets it happen.
The next chapter is definitely going to be the last!
They keep this game of Draco locking himself in the bathroom or Draco ignoring Potter in some other way up, until the day of the questioning. Potter comes by early that day, but Draco is already sitting in his room ready to go. He has paid special attention to his hair today and has put on his best clothes. Thank god, Potter has taken him shopping this one time, otherwise he would have looked like a total nut job.
“I’m going to show you something cool tomorrow,” he says. Draco looks up, into Potter’s eyes and they share a warm, open smile.
But all of that lay in the past, he thought, as his gaze fell to the right side of the bed where Harry lay sprawled on his stomach. Draco’s face rearranged itself into a contented smile as he regarded his husband of roughly one and a half years. His hair was even more of a disaster than during the day. It was beyond him how Harry, whose own grandfather had made his fortune with hair potions, didn’t seem to be able to tame this mess. Then again, what would he do, if Harry’s hair were suddenly neat and tidy? He would probably lose him all the time, if he wasn’t able to make him out by the atrocious bird’s nest on his head. He reached out to tangle his hands in that thick, soft mess, when—
“Mr Potter, sir, I don’t mean to be rude,” he says and Harry wonders how exactly he still manages to string these kinds of sentences together when he is clearly beyond shit-faced. “Wouldn’t you want to find someone closer to your own age?”
“The real deal?” Harry asked again and quickly made his way around the bed.
“Wow,” says Draco.
“It’s kind of like a memory, without the Pensive. And, of course, it’s not real. It’s real people playing roles, like in the theatre.” He looks at Draco questioningly and Draco nods in confirmation that he has understood what Potter has just told him. Still not convinced that this telly thingy isn’t dangerous.
“I… Luna…,” Harry had stuttered.
“Shit,” he hissed, and his hands flew to his middle. And just like that he knew what had woken him up. His hands rubbed over his swollen stomach, which was suddenly very hard, and he tried to breathe through the pain, just as their midwife Luna had taught him in the weeks and weeks of birthing classes he and Harry had taken. Harry had had to drag him to each and every one of them kicking and screaming, but in this moment, Draco was nothing if not glad to know how to help himself. The pain stopped soon enough and Draco breathed a relieved sigh.
“Okay,” Harry said slowly, apparently not quite trusting where this conversation was going. “You sure?”
make him queasy, so he just skips these parts. Sometimes he lies down after lunch and withdraws into his happy place.
“I’ve got you, love, don’t panic,” he blurts, chest rising and falling quickly as adrenaline courses through his body. Potter struggles against his grip.
“Of course,” Draco answered quickly, avoiding Harry’s eyes.
“I was right about the movie, wasn’t I?” he asks gently and even though Draco knows that he isn’t gloating he has to fight the urge to glare. He nods instead. Potter smiles at him warmly for a few seconds before Draco can see a glint igniting in his eyes.
Talking scares him, though. Writing, however, is something that he could consider. But he definitely is not ready to let someone read his thoughts. He starts to write anyway and when Schmendrick the nosy bugger sees it, he brings by a notebook for him. When Draco nods his thanks, he can see the hopefulness in Schmendrick’s eyes and feels the pressure of it. But he chooses not to think about it any further.
“I don’t know. I just thought of you focused on how I wanted you to take care of me and then you came,” he says almost reluctantly, eyes downcast, refusing to meet Draco’s eyes. His chest contracts painfully for a second and then it feels like something inside him breaks, but instead of more pain, warmth spreads in his chest. He lunges forward, pushing Harry on his back in the process and kisses him deeply. Harry spreads his thighs easily and Draco slips between them. Their cocks, which in all this talking have never wavered, brush together in the sweetest friction, making both of them gasp. “Harry,” Draco moans against his lips at he starts rocking lightly against him again.
He pulls back, wiping his face with the back of his hand and accios his wand from his trousers. He casts a quick cleaning charm on himself, leaving his mouth minty fresh, and pushes Malfoy up on the bed, pleased that he hasn’t recovered from his orgasm yet, still starring at the ceiling a little cross eyed.
“Shhh,” Draco makes again, “stay calm, don’t tense up, try to relax around it.”
Pain was a funny thing, Draco knew. He didn’t lack experience with pain. The thing that always struck him was how it made it absolutely impossible to think about anything at all. That was probably why Draco didn’t even notice when the contractions stopped and he drifted off to sleep again.
“How about those fake Galleons, Hermione? Like those we had in Dumbledore’s Army, with the difference that the Galleon doesn’t deliver messages but contains a tracking charm instead?”
, but it is a cock not a horse and he really doesn’t want to be caught talking to his prick.
When Potter wakes up, Draco is crying. Although, not as violently as yesterday. He cannot seem to stop, no matter how much he may want to. Potter is all over him instantly.
“I’ve got to go, sorry. It was fun talking to you. Do you mind me coming by the next time Neville visits his parents?” Silence. “Oh yeah, forgot about the No-Talking again. Well, then you will either have to suck it up or tell me to go.” He stands flashing a last smug grin in Draco’s direction and leaves the ward.
“Stop crying your little eyes out, Potty! As if you could make me do anything I don’t want to.”
“I was humiliated. But it wasn’t enough for Astoria. She told my parents and threatened to tell the Prophet and, of course, those vultures would have been foaming at the mouth for a chance to print something like ‘Malfoy Heir Likes It Up The Ass’ or something. Well, I had to pay her off heftily. And my parents can’t even look at me, because isn’t is bad enough to have a bent son, does he have to be the bottom as well? Well, newsflash everyone, no one spreads their legs for an ex-Death Eater and who exactly do I have to thank for this one?”
Fucking breathe yourself if it makes you happy.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry yawns deeply and makes to get underneath the blanket, throwing it over Draco as well, before pulling him against his chest again. His eyes begin to droop and with them, apparently, the filter that is supposed to keep him from bursting out with every single thought that runs through his mind, for suddenly he says, “I could be persuaded to spread my legs for an ex-Death Eater.”
When Harry finally returns the next day, he pulls Draco into a tight hug and kisses his temple quickly. It is such a brief and tender touch, yet it makes his chest go tight. He leans into the embrace, however, short it is.
“You act as if you’re the only one who went through something traumatic here,” Potter spits. “I’ve got news for you, you’re not! And I won’t keep on enabling you in your stupid behaviour. Either you start fighting for your recovery or you can rot in here for all I care!” With that said, Potter storms out of his room and slams the door behind himself, leaving behind a furious Draco.
“I won’t come back here, if you don’t stop this.” Draco’s scowl deepens into a glare and Potter steps forward, taking Draco’s face into his hands. “I cannot let you distract yourself from getting better. If my presence is distracting you, if it is preventing or even delaying your recovery then I need to keep away from you. However hard it may be.” He leans in and kisses Draco softly. “I’m going to give you a few days to think things over.” He strokes his thumb over Draco’s lower lip, before he turns around and makes to leave. Before he slips out of the door he says, “It’s up to you.” And then he is gone.
He grabs his cock just a fraction tighter and starts targeting his prostate with every upward stroke, tremors wreck his body at every touch. His orgasm approaches quickly and when it hits him, he arches his back, shooting long stripes of pearly white come across his hands and stomach and probably even floor and chair. Potter’s eyes have found his again and even when the most intense orgasm rips through him Draco doesn’t break eye contact.
Luna had flooed over some time ago, checking on Draco and his progress. According to her, everything was exactly as it should be. Even though Draco’s contractions were painful, there was nothing to worry about.
“I’ve brought food,” she says cheerily and even though he has sworn to himself to keep his distance from her the mention of actual edible food draws him out of his metaphorical lair. It’s only sandwiches, but compared to St. Mungo’s food they are divine.
He tried to help in any way he could, but when Draco stopped ranting and shouting and cursing the day Harry was born, Harry grew frantic. He tried everything, from talking to Draco to offering massages to bringing more pillows to urging him to take the fucking potions already. When Harry tried to wipe his husband’s forehead clean of sweat, Draco flinched.
“Shhh Harry, calm down. I’m going to stop if you want me to,” he says and it is the most painful thing he has ever said. Potter breathes heavily, having noticed that Draco has stopped to move, he relaxes a fraction.
When the door closes behind her, he laughs. She is right, of course, he had deserved to be punched and he is glad that she has interpreted the portrait as what it was intended to be, an apology. Strangely her forgiveness means more to him now that he knows that she hasn’t forgotten what he has done.
He can feel his climax approaching, how his balls are slowly drawing up and how the passage into Potter’s body becomes harder as his cock begins to grow with the beginning of his knot.
Al looked around the slightly cluttered living-room, typically for his aunt every available surface was covered in books, but his aunt was nowhere in sight.
“Can I touch you?” Harry asks, voice rough. Malfoy just nods, apparently not trusting his voice at the moment. Harry reaches out one hand and brushes it against Malfoy’s thigh. Before he has a chance to bite his lip again, a broken moan escapes him and Harry briefly muses that it might just have been the sweetest sound he has ever heard. A sound so open and deliciously filthy that he wants to hear it again, preferably uninterrupted this time. Suddenly, he can imagine himself devoting his life to eliciting this noise from Draco Malfoy again and again for surely, he would never grow tired of it.
“It won’t do a lot of good though,” he says and Draco looks up from his breakfast. He sees emotions flicker across Potter’s face, sadness, grief, maybe even bitterness. “Not that I’m an expert on the topic, not having had a mother myself for most of my life, but they tend to always worry about their children, even when everything is fine.” Apparently, Potter really has his own share of pain and grief to work through and it makes Draco feel somewhat stupid for thinking otherwise, however briefly. Now that he takes in Potter’s appearance he recognizes the telltale signs of a person losing sleep. There are dark circles underneath his eyes, his skin has a greyish tint to it, and there are distinct lines edged into his face that shouldn’t be there for a person who has only just turned nineteen.
“I won’t. Cross my heart and hope to die,” Harry mocked. Draco’s laugh turned into a moan, when Harry let his fingers trail lightly over his cock.
Draco feels what is left of his sanity crumbling. Tears rush to his eyes as he tosses the paper onto the table. Everything is a blur. He stumbles to his feet, looking down onto the table, at the paper and that heinous article. How can this be real?
When the Prat saunters into his room that afternoon it is all he can do to refrain from punching him straight in the face. He figures that it wouldn’t do to punch his
“Then get her here. Harry, please. I need her,” he whined. Harry stepped towards where he was standing in the bathroom, reorganising his hair potions.
“More,” Draco commands and Harry speeds up his thrusts, pushing himself inside as deeply as possible, until he has Draco chanting
“N-no. I don’t need to though,” Harry answers.
❤️❤️❤️
As soon as the cake is set down in front of him, Draco digs in. He hasn’t had anything that delicious in forever. The last time he had been able to really appreciate a desert would have been sometime during fifth year. The moment he puts the first bite of cake into his mouth, a long, satisfied sigh escapes him. And for a short while the world around him ceases to exist and for a pleasant reason for a change. For a few minutes there is only him and the cake, it is like a religious experience. When he finally looks up from his now empty plate, Potter is staring at him, unblinking, jaw slack. Draco frowns and Potter swallows audibly, before he smirks at Draco and pushes his untouched piece of cake towards him. Draco pushes it back, still frowning.
It would have been wise to go to the bathroom half an hour ago, but he had been reluctant to leave the bed. His contractions had returned sometime during the night and, so far, they had been manageable. But now his bladder was about ready to burst and he was scared that if he went now, he might not make it. He hadn’t had a contraction standing up yet and wasn’t entirely sure that he would be able to remain upright. Contractions might be worse standing up. This was his first child, so how was he supposed to know?
“I was just trying to have a wank in privacy!” Harry shouted exasperatedly. He punctuated the sentence with one more guilty stroke.
“Oh that,” she snapped, back to her normal self once again, “I don’t know, probably something with your diet or something. Anyway, you have to promise me you’ll never have sex with anyone - because if you do, there will be dire consequences.” Trelawney glanced at her watch, “Would you look at the time! I’m gonna be late for my lunch date with the Long Island Medium!” She ran out of the room.
“And you, Hermione, are blowing me away with your perfect answers,” said Lupin exuberantly. Hermione blushed and looked down at her book.
Lucius fell to the floor, “FUCK, my HIP, aaaahhhh!” He rolled on the opulent marble floor in pain.
“I love Uncle Willy’s jizzum!” shouted Draco.
Harry gulped so hard he swallowed 10 tonsil stones.
The real Draco ran from his seat to the front of the classroom, pulled out his cock, and dove in front of Harry. The Blowgart immediately latched onto Malfoy’s pork sword and started sucking like a shop vac. The real Malfoy fell to the ground, incapacitated, as he received one of the roughest blowies he had ever gotten. And it was from himself of all people!
.” He looked back towards the class with a bit of a guilty expression. “Oh, you know how it is with the full moon and all.” Everyone looked around confused, “Now, where were we?”
your shit away! Is this what you wanted? You ruined Christmas! ARE YOU HAPPY?”
“Like what?
Luscious Lucius slammed the ceiling with his silver snake cane, which somehow was beginning to look a bit droopy and ill. “OI! You two better not be beatin’ the balloon knot up there! I swear, if I hear just one ovya doin’ the buggery or bumpin’ bullocks, I’ll come right up there! Ya ‘ear?!”
They all smiled at each other as Lissome Lucius leapt and sang around the room.
Tearing through these halls with unimaginable scorn.
Willy un-scrunched his face, which was now the size of a regular macadamia nut. “Yes Lucius, try the chocolate mush, or I’m going to have to ask you to leave.” He smiled, “Also, everyone, you’re all welcome to eat - no need to wait for us.”
He galloped towards Harry, “And finally, Harry! Harry-Willy the perfect pair!” Willy put his lips directly into Harry’s ear and whispered, “By the way, I have an experiment I’ve been working on that I think you’ll find especially tantalizing.”
Shit. Harry’s stomach was in knots as he approached the dirty gym bag containing the Blowgart. It writhed on the ground like a bad omen, reminding him vaguely of Zacharius Smith’s party last weekend.  Harry unzipped it, and slowly, as if easing open a Howler from Molly, pulled wide the flaps.
“Thanks, creepy old man!” Harry said cheerfully, as the man wheeled his knife cart away.
Dobilina looked up and smiled her tiny-tooth smile, “Dobilina has made dinner for everyone!”
“No Draco, The Village People wore them after hours. They’re anything
Harry giggled nervously and muttered, “Hazukashii! (uwu)”
“I showed the Fat Lady my feet,” Draco answered.
Trelawney's face sunk with disappointment. “I’m sorry to have spoiled what I’m sure was building up to be a wonderful, sexual romp, but I just couldn’t let my students be in danger.” She paused as a glistening jewel caught her eye; it was a bit of precum about to drip off of Harry’s dick. “Harry! Whatever you do, don’t let that precum hit the ground,” she splurted.
“I’m just saying,” he sounds apologetic, “You haven’t even gotten used to the Metro lion and every time something unexpected comes up, you jump. There is going to be a lot of that.” Yes, well, it probably would be best to choose another movie, but now he has already glared at Potter and it would be kind of embarrassing to change his mind. He just hopes that the two tons of sweets that they buy next will distract him enough to get through this movie.
He breathes a sigh of relieve when Potter finally returns on Saturday to take him to his mother. They spend a quiet day at the Manor. His mother has one of the house elves come to cut Draco’s hair which admittedly has looked awful for the past couple of weeks. After his haircut he lounges on a small sofa, his head in his mother’s lap while she strokes his hair and he stuffs his face with all the little delicacies the house elves have prepared. There is yet another reason to get out of JTW as soon as possible – food. To eat whatever he likes, whenever he likes and to throw anything resembling the rubbish he is fed at JTW back into the cook’s face.
“Sirius,” Draco said. Harry’s eyes filled with tears that immediately brimmed over. Draco reached out and brushed them away, then leant in and kissed Harry.
“I’m scared,” Potter says and tears well up in his big green eyes again. He is such a mess and for some twisted reason that is what keeps Draco grounded. Also it is fucking hot to see Potter so insecure. He has always been the strong and brave one of the two of them. It might be cruel but Potter being all vulnerable turns him on to no end. He scoots forward, straddling Potter’s lap and taking his face into his hands.
“Draco,” Potter whimpers, “More… I need…”
“Love, calm down,” Draco says, “You can do this. Your body is made for this. You have done so good up until now, you can do this too.” Harry visibly relaxes at the praise, a shiver running through him, and suddenly Draco remembers that being an omega isn’t about sex and knotting only, it is also about submission, about pleasing the alpha.
The door flies open and hits the wall with a loud bang, Schmendrick is running into the room, but Draco doesn’t even notice him, he doesn’t hear him screaming at him, because he is overwhelmed by the desperate need to finally prove that this is not reality. He pinches his arm again, stronger this time than he did in the common room and when he still doesn’t wake up, he scratches his arms, his legs, until he draws blood. The pain, that has been distant so far, because he has been so sure that none of this is actually happening, hits him full force and the sharp distracting discomfort of his nails dragging along his arms and of his hands pulling out strands of his hair, is the last thing anchoring him, as the realization begins to dawn on him that this isn’t a dream after all. Because what is trying to enter his chest is something he has never felt before, something beyond pain, beyond the Cruciatus and it would surely kill him instantaneously if he were to feel it undilutedly.
“So, if I take a step back from work,” Harry began insecurely, “Maybe I could carry her?” The thought of getting Harry pregnant, of thrusting into him, coming inside him and creating another tiny miracle, sent a powerful wave of arousal crashing through Draco, making it hard to breathe. An involuntary groan was ripped from his throat and his formerly half-hard cock jumped in anticipation.
“Are you comfortable? Do you need more pillows?” he asked, and stepped closer to the bed, sitting down on the edge. “Are you hungry? Do you want some water? Or ice chips? In the movies they always have ice chips.” He reached out for Draco, smoothed his hair back with clumsy fingers that made Draco wince. Then, just as quickly as he had sat down, Harry shot up again.
Draco looks down at his breakfast, stirring his porridge listlessly. He knows about Frank and Alice Longbottom. Aunty Bella had never missed an occasion to brag about how she had been the only one whose devotion for the Dark Lord had never wavered. How she had rather spent fourteen years in Azkaban than renouncing her Lord and that she had been glad to take another couple of mudblood lovers down with her on her quest to find Voldemort. Although, she had never called him that, of course. His shoulders tense at the memories, already dreading the night. There is, of course, a reason he doesn’t deal with what has happened, why he doesn’t put in the effort he should to get out of here. The memories he lives through now, in the relative safety of the JTW common room, will visit him again during the night.
“Reliving happy memories?” he quips and they both chuckle quietly, taken back to Harry’s unfortunate outing. But Draco soon sobers before the task at hand. It doesn’t matter that almost all of Harry’s family have seen him in his normal JTW clothes, he still wants to make a good impression. Then again, does it really matter when he has already made the very worst impression he could have made long before he and Harry ever became friendly?
“Yes. Only you,” Harry moans as Draco keeps on stroking his leaking cock.
“Don’t you baby me, you fucking–” He broke off, searching for words, but coming up blank. “Gryffindor,” he finally spat. Harry had the audacity to snort.
“Oh fine,” he relented after a moment. “Scorp and I have a plan and need your help.” The kettle whistled and Hermione poured them each a cup before placing their respective mugs on the table in front of them.
“Just some help getting to the bathroom would be great,” Draco said, and as soon as the contraction had faded for good, he rolled around so that Harry could help him up and towards the bathroom.
He pulls away, kissing a trail from the corner of Draco’s mouth, down to his neck and back again to his mouth. He can tell that Draco is feeling slightly awkward, now that Harry is inside him, not moving but instead kissing and caressing him as if this was something different than a one-time only thing. And Harry, too, wonders about it. The way Draco has melted into him, leaning into his touches, moaned into his mouth, is certainly different than the quick and efficient fucking Harry normally indulges in. Also, he doesn’t make a habit out of rimming people until they come all over themselves. Kissing someone there feels rather too intimate for a one-night stand. But there is something about Malfoy, about their shared history that has him wanting to make this memorable. For Draco, but for himself as well, because he has spent too much time thinking about this.
“You thought you could fuck my innocent –“ This time it’s Harry’s turn to interrupt, “He’s hardly inno–“ But Malfoy isn’t having it. “INNOCENT son,” he bellows, right over what Harry is trying to say. And, dude, he is getting on Harry’s nerves now. It’s like Harry could say anything and he still wouldn’t believe a word he said. For a second, he is tempted to play into that and say something ridiculous just to see what happens, but instead he keeps on arguing.
Suddenly, Draco gasped as another contraction began. This one the most painful so far. “Harry,” he wheezed as he curled in on himself and knocked a couple of towels off the bed. This time Harry was apparently paying better attention, for Draco could hear him sprinting up the stairs and bursting into the room sans chair.
“I know. It’s not going to be much longer.”
“Mr Potter, I cannot tell you what a pleasure it is to have you here,” Schmendrick the boot-licker says. It figures that he wants to suck up to Potter, probably to arrange for some good press for the ward, probably in hope of donations and the like.
For a while, Draco relishes in his reawakened sexuality and enjoys reacquainting himself with his body in that way. But eventually the growing tension between himself and Potter, the constant accidental touches, every whiff he catches of Potter’s cologne, every heated stare and especially Potter’s barely audible, strained groans leave him frustrated and to a certain degree cranky. And since all of this is Potter’s fault, naturally, like so many other things, he doesn’t feel guilty in the least when he starts putting the moves on him, even though Potter has told him that nothing would happen between them as long as Draco wasn’t out of here. He makes a habit out of greeting Potter in various stages of undress and their touches become less accidental. Potter’s groans become more strained and more audible, his bathroom breaks more frequent. Yet he refuses to initiate anything.
The furniture is mismatched, some of it is worn down, but he has a feeling that he has chosen every piece with care. There are a lot of pictures. There is one of his parents on their wedding day, twirling around, laughing at the camera ever so often. There is one of four scruffy teenagers, sitting together, arms thrown over each other’s shoulders. There are the obligatory pictures of Weasley and Granger. One shows them on their wedding day. Granger, especially, looks radiant, almost overwhelmed with happiness. There are pictures of his other friends. Longbottom and a couple of other Gryffindors whose names he cannot remember. One photo shows Potter with his arms around the Weasley girl. An emotion surges through him that he refuses to name and he quickly looks over to the next photo which shows a young blonde woman with hair almost as fair as Draco’s own – Luna Lovegood. He averts his gaze in shame as the image of her locked up in the Manor’s dungeons flashes before his eyes. There is nothing he could ever do to repent for his sins. The pain he has caused will never be redeemed. Who is he even kidding? Why even try to get better? There can never be anything for him in this post-war world. Wizarding society won’t forgive him because, how could they?
Draco nodded and pulled Harry closer.
“Do the thing,” Harry pants, while shamelessly rocking his hips into Draco’s fingers.
“I’m here, baby,” Harry answered, supporting Draco’s head with his left arm and pressed a kiss against his sweaty cheek. “I’ve got you.”
“Kids,” he grumbles under his breath. “Stupid kids. Stupid kids getting drunk. Stupid kids getting drunk in my third favourite club. Stupid kids getting drunk in my third favourite club, trying to pull strangers.”
“I’ve always wondered, if it was soft,” he mutters while running the strands through his fingers. “So soft.”
“How are you an alpha and I’m an omega?” he asks incredulously. He is right, of course. Draco has always been cowardly while Potter has been brave, facing the dangers and threats head on, while Draco had let himself be pushed around like a piece on a chess board.
“Sure. We don’t really need the money, and you haven’t been happy for a while. You could work less, or you could even do something else entirely. And if you never want to work a day in your life again, that would also be fine by me,” Draco declared.
He feels better in a lot of ways. Foremost, he is sleeping the night through. He feels rested and now that Potter has taken to feeding him actual edible food (that has not been prepared in the St. Mungo’s kitchens) he feels strong and healthy and almost human. But he has no control over his life, whatsoever. It bugs him. It’s is so not the Malfoy way. As much as it pains him to admit it, even in the privacy of his own head, Potter is right. He needs to start working on himself. He needs to focus on his recovery.
Draco woke to screaming, coming from downstairs. He sprinted down the three nearby corridors, hopped on his lift, then took three more sets of windy stairs down to the first floor. When he finally arrived at the parlor, he saw Harry being reprimanded by his father.
Harry immediately began scarfing down the mush, until something forced him to pause. “Hang on a second. There’s a toenail in here!” Harry pulled a long, yellow toenail out of his mouth that would make even the Lamisil monsters cringe.
Clickity, clickity, clack went the cane. Slippity, slippity, slap went the patent leather go-go boots.
Draco and Harry stared at each other in shock. Harry broke the silence, “What am I going to do?!”
“What’s worse than death?” Harry asked, his penis bouncing as he spoke.
Tears began to fill her eyes, and they clouded over with prophetic wisdom. “Harry, I’m so sorry. You have the Sign of the Chode.” Draco gasped and sat down at the edge of Harry’s bed shaken.
would ever want to in a million years, so I reckon you’re fine.”
“Just kiss me, you pence-store warlock!” Lucius parted his velvety lips, and Harry inched towards him. When their lips met, it blew away all the other sexiest kisses in history. (
“What are you talking about? You were literally just trying to have sex with me.”
“Potter! Do you understand what you’ve done? These were some of the most collectible Boggart Babies™ on the market! Do you even know what that means?” Draco scooped up and cradled the plush remains in his arms and glared at Harry.
Dobilina stood up and stated in a calm tone, “Dobilina doesn’t like it when family fights.” She then left to bring the chocolate mush from the kitchen.
Harry jumped off the edge of the destructive machine Draco somehow called a bed and sat next to him. He pulled Draco’s drippy, snotty face toward him and whispered, “Draco, it’ll be okay. Things are just things - we’ll always be able to replace them. I’m just glad you didn’t get hurt. And plus, didn’t a bunch of people think those things would be worth money one day, and they wound up being worth nothing?”
They appear in front of a posh apartment building in the centre of London. The Malfoys must be as loaded as they have ever been if that is where the youngest family member lives. James shares a tiny flat with three roommates while finishing his master’s degree. Al isn’t doing much better, often crashing at his parents’ when he is tired of his mouldy flat. Lily is in her last year of Hogwarts, so at least one of his kids isn’t worrying about making ends meet. He and Ginny both feel that the kids need to make it on their own. Especially, since they both didn’t have a lot during their respective childhoods. They help the boys, of course, whenever any of them is in real need of money. But they seem to be content with their lives just the way they are.
On the third day he begins to consider that he might be able to work harder for his recovery after all. Maybe Potter was right, maybe he really is trying to distract himself because he is scared. But the question that comes to his mind now is, is it really worth it now that Potter has left him? So far, Potter – no, let’s face it – Harry has been what he has been imagining as a life after JTW. He has thought that Harry would be there with him. Would he want to be there now? Has he given up on Draco?
“Er, yes, we need you,” Harry had repeated.
“What was I supposed to do? You didn’t even communicate with me, you weren’t getting any better. You were barely even interacting with me,” he suddenly explodes. He looks Draco in the eye, chest heaving, jutting his chin forward just the tiniest fraction and any hope of an apology that Draco might have had vanishes.
“Oh, don’t play coy with me, Potter! You wanted to fuck him,” Malfoy snaps.
“I thought you wanted to see your mother,” he says and then proceeds to throw a bag at him and snaps, “Change!” When Draco steps out of the changing room, Potter gives him a thorough once over. “Don’t you look nice,” he says teasingly. Draco blushes and when he looks up, he notices the assistant giving him the stink-eye.
“Shut up!”
“Well, I’m sorry I made you do this against your will,” Harry said, sounding hurt still.
“Do you want to watch another?” Draco nods enthusiastically. Harry shows him different tapes and he chooses one. This film isn’t as happy as the last one and Draco finds himself crying through half of it. Potter doesn’t comment and the few times that he looks up at him his eyes are suspiciously glassy as well. When the second movie is over as well, Draco feels mortified when he sees the wet patch where he has cried into Potter’s shirt. But he doesn’t comment. Instead he feeds him sandwiches in the basement kitchen.
“Zip it, Potter,” he growls, glaring at Harry. Then he addresses his son, “Go to your room, Scorpius. Get some sleep. We’ll talk about this in the morning.” His tone doesn’t leave any room for discussion and consequently Scorpius doesn’t raise an argument but just gets off the floor quietly. Before he steps into his room, he mutters a quiet “Good night!” and they can basically hear him snoring about three seconds later.
When they arrive home that day, Draco hands Potter his hat back. His hair stands out in every direction just like Potter’s from being crushed underneath it. He runs his fingers through it in an attempt to straighten it out, but to no avail. He would need a hair brush or comb for that. So, he gives up quickly. Potter reaches out and tucks one strand of hair behind his ear.
“Git.”
“I… how… how do you know I’m gay?” he half stutters, half blurts out. And before Draco knows what is happening an undignified snort leaves him and his lips twitch. Surely, this is the most ridiculous situation he has ever witnessed. It is the closest he has come to laughing in years.
Draco learns about his living situation, how the Prat has inherited the Black estate and is trying to make the place inhabitable. Draco remembers visiting the place, before he was of Hogwarts age. Even then the house had been gloomy and it is hard to imagine how bad it has become after being empty for such a long time. He even remembers the old house elf that, according to Potter, has got even worse. But through everything that Potter tells him he cannot help but feel that it is an awfully big project to remodel such a large house by himself. Especially when he’s still struggling with overcoming emotional trauma.
Potter is clearly oblivious to what is going on with Draco, at least if his expression is anything to go by. “Hi Draco,” he says innocently, “What’s going on?” His glare deepens and he holds up the letter that is slightly crumpled in his right fist.
And then they are gloriously naked on Harry’s sofa, bodies sliding against each other, each touch sending sparks of electricity through Draco’s body. He spreads his legs widely, willing Harry to understand what he wants without having to actually speak the words.
Suddenly, Potter pushes his chair back violently. The sound of wood scraping along tiles is loud in the small café. Several heads turn towards them when Potter says, “Stop that, Draco!” He glares at Draco, gets up from his chair and walks away funnily towards the restrooms. Draco probably would have laughed, if he wasn’t painfully hard himself. Like so many times before when he has been with Potter. His frustration is slowly reaching its boiling point.
“I’m stronger than you?”
“Dray?” Potter tries. Scowl.
“No,” Potter denies.
“Look, Malfoy, I’m not gonna lie. I was at the club to pull, but –“ Yet Malfoy, obviously, isn’t interested in what he has to say for he cuts him right off.
“N-no,” Harry stutters.
“Well then, eat up,” Potter says with a big smile on his face. But Draco cannot stomach another bite. He is nervous now, fidgeting in his seat, looking at his reflection in a spoon and flinching.
One day, they are sitting together in a restaurant eating pizza, when Potter says, “How would you feel about visiting your mother?” Draco’s head shoots up from his pizza and immediately his eyes fill with tears. He doesn’t know what to think, how to act or where to look. Potter reaches over the table and grabs his hand.
“Sorry, pregnancy brain.”
For a moment he doubts his decision to not go into crisis when he steps into the bathroom and looks at himself in the mirror. Forty-seven isn’t exactly old for a wizard, not comparable to how old forty-seven is for a Muggle. But still, he has crow’s feet and the skin around his eyes looks a little saggy. Maybe he should have listened to Fleur and started moisturizing but he really couldn’t be bothered. He is starting to grey around the temples, no honestly, who is he even trying to kid, he isn’t starting to grey, he has started a good while ago. He can only hope that whoever he sets his eyes on tonight is buying into the whole salt and pepper shit.
“Don’t make me do that again,” he says icily, “I feel like a fucking perpetrator.” Draco reaches out a hand, but Potter flinches back, glaring at him. And while he has felt contented just a few seconds ago, he feels wrecked with guilt now.
“You little shits,” Harry says without heat, unable to keep the smile off his face as he snaps out of his recollection. Scorpius is right they have hit it off. He hasn’t been this relaxed in a long time, because he hasn’t had sex like that in a really, really long time.
“I know that you were shit-scared during that time. I know that there was no way for you to do anything differently. The Dark Lord was just as cruel to his followers as he was to his enemies.” He feels the tears brimming over and quickly wipes at his cheeks to hide them from her. But Lovegood just gives him a sympathetic look and doesn’t comment any further.
“Speaking of Harry,” she continues as if that was a natural continuation of the conversation. “I’m glad he found you.” He shoots her a disbelieving look.
“Come on. Just give it a try. If you hate it, I’ll never ask again.” Well, he’s going to believe that one when he sees it. But then Harry gives him that look. He looks disappointed, like he really wants for Draco to come with him. Underneath it, however, Draco thinks he can spot something else, compassion and probably also respect. Harry is going to accept whatever he is going to decide. If he doesn’t agree to come today, he is probably going to ask again and there probably will be a certain amount of pressure, but in the end, Harry is going to accept his decision. It feels nice to know that. And suddenly he nods. His fucking traitorous head nods. Just like that. He is going to the Burrow. To have lunch. On Sunday. Wait. What day is it today?
“Can’t I just visit my favourite aunty, when I feel like it?” Al answered innocently and is only met with an incredulously lifted eyebrow.
“Oh, is that me?” she coos. He nods.
And so began the year in which Harry tried to convince Draco to stay and Draco just couldn’t. The idea of Harry breaking his heart was unbearable to Draco. He needed to get away when everything became too much and Harry tried time and time again to convince Draco that he was it for him, but Draco couldn’t believe him, because they had hated each other, because Harry had been the hero and Draco the villain, and he was just scared. Sometimes Draco would stay for a month and Harry would think that they were finally good, but then the fighting would start. Draco would contradict him in everything, pick fights wherever he could and when Harry called him out on his behaviour, Draco would remind him that this couldn’t work. Then came the silence and a couple of days later Draco would be gone again.
And then one day he realises that he is nearing fifty. It’s official. He isn’t in his mid-forties anymore. He is definitely nearing fifty. Getting old.
and every cell in his body begins to tighten with the force of his impending release. Taking one hand off the bed, he wraps his hand around Draco’s cock and starts stroking him in time with his thrusts.
“Can I join you?” He nods again and then proceeds to gather his painting materials adding an extra canvas and easel for her. While she paints a happy abstract painting, full of different shades of yellow and orange, he sets to paint another portrait. They are mostly silent while they work and after about two and a half hours, Lovegood drops her brush and looks over at Draco again.
paid attention in those classes (like
“I –,” he breaks off, rubbing his shaking hands over his sweaty face. “I want a family, but –,” he breaks off again, unable to voice his thoughts.
He cleans himself off with a tissue and steps into his pants and walks over to Potter. While Draco’s breathing has almost returned to normal by now, Potter hasn’t recovered by one inch. He positions himself directly in front of Potter, their eyes lock and Draco reaches forward for the fly of Potter’s pants. Potter tries to step back, but only manages to hit his head on the door. Draco smirks, while he unbuttons the other man’s trousers and then lets them drop to pool around Potter’s ankles. He goes for his boxers next, careful not to touch Potter’s cock that is just as hard and leaking as Draco’s own had been a few minutes earlier.
“Yeah?”
“Doesn’t mean we can’t start practicing. Now move.” And Harry did.
“Well, I’m not sure if he will need to eat again this week,” Harry quips and laughs, when he sees Draco’s pained face.
“Oh god, Draco,” breathes Potter next to him. Draco pumps his finger in and out a couple of times before he speaks again.
He breathes a sigh of relief, when finally, the alarm falls silent, but nearly chokes on it, when he sees a figure emerging from one of the rooms. A sleep rumpled Malfoy makes his way towards the entrance, cursing under his breath. He is dressed in nothing but a flimsy dressing gown, pulling the belt into a knot in the front as he approaches Harry and Scorpius, of whom he is still unaware. He stops dead when he spots Harry, who is still struggling to keep Scorpius upright.
“Wow, that is beautiful. You’re flattering me.” She winks at him, but he shakes his head, because he hasn’t flattered her. She has grown up to be quite beautiful, even though her eyes are still a little large for her face. He gestures from her to the painting.
“Oh Draco, it’s a little boy,” crooned Luna, as she held the pink-skinned, wailing infant up for them to see.
Then she addressed Harry, “Now is not the time for hurt feelings, Harry. Go downstairs, drink a glass of water, gather yourself, and then come back. We need you.”
“Why, Potter? Haven’t I done enough to redeem myself? Why do you still have to humiliate me at every turn? Why can’t you just leave me the hell alone? And why do you have to drag my son into this?” Malfoy rants, exasperation clear in his voice.
“What are you two doing out here? Come in, come in. Food’s already on the table,” Mrs Weasley’s voice booms from the open door. They are ushered into a cluttered kitchen. In the middle of the room stands a large dining table, laden with food which smells, just as Harry has promised, delicious. They are greeted by calls of “Finally!” and “Can we eat now? I’m starving.” and Harry only says, “Well, it’s nice to see you too.” He pulls out one of the mismatched chairs for Draco to sit down in and then sits next to him.
“Like?”
“I’m not letting anything happen to you.”
“Shhh,” he makes before he even has a chance to think about it. Granger looks at him, eyes perfectly round.
Luna threw Harry a look that told him it was time for Draco to push again. Harry nodded and said, “Come on, Malfoy, show me how much stronger you are than me.” But Draco shook his head again.
“But before that you wanted to fuck him, didn’t you, Potter? You thought about it, didn’t you? Having him. So young and inexperienced. I bet you got so hard thinking about it,” he taunts and Harry blushes furiously. Because on the one hand, Malfoy is kind of right, he has wanted to fuck him, he has started to fantasize about him the moment he laid eyes on him, except he started fantasizing about his father not him. And why do he and his father need to look so much alike? It’s fucking confusing.
“Are you okay?” Potter asks, when he enters. Draco nods. What bad is going to happen to him today? Nothing, that’s what. He is going to go there and he is going to keep his mouth shut just as he has for the past months and that is going to be it. No need to worry about any of it. But Potter seems nervous and that in turn makes Draco’s stomach clench. He refuses to show any of it. So, he doesn’t take Potter’s hand when they make their way towards the Apparition Point. He doesn’t take Potter’s hand when they step into the Atrium at the Ministry either. Neither does he take Potter’s hand when they make it to the interrogation room at the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. He does, however, take his hand when the Head of the department and two members of the Wizengamot calmly explain that Draco is going to be questioned under Veritaserum.
Despite the war Draco has managed to kiss the odd guy, and girl for that matter, but it had never felt like this. He is hard instantly, painfully so, and his hands wander over Potter’s body, from his hair to his back, to his stomach and back to his arse, he feels that this is very much mutual. He grabs Potter’s hips and pulls him close, grinding into him and eliciting the sweetest moans that shoot sparks up and down his spine. He is surprised at his body’s reaction to this frantic snogging and rutting. Lately, he has felt so broken, so governed by his dark thoughts, that he has assumed that his body wouldn’t function this way anymore. But this is bliss. Suddenly, there seems to be something else, besides the dark that has been looming over him for the past months. He feels ready to lose himself in this new sensation, to leave behind his demons in order to do this. All day, every day.
“Are you okay?” he demanded, chest heaving. Draco shook his head once, clenching his teeth as he tried to keep quiet through the gruelling pain.
“How does it feel,” he asks.
Draco was dead on his feet. Entertaining a house full of sugar-crazed toddlers was a lot of things, but above all it was exhausting. He breathed a long sigh when, finally, the last plates were back in the cupboard and all the countertops were wiped clean.
“Draco?” Harry said, obviously struggling to keep calm. Despite the pain, Draco managed to squeeze his hand reassuringly. “Okay,” Harry whispered, “We’re doing this. Breathe with me.” And then he did. After a couple of seconds Draco copied him. Together they breathed through the contraction, which turned out to be a lot more manageable this way. When the pain faded and Draco was finally able to relax again, he said, “Thank you.”
When he takes a step forward, the world around him tilts slightly, making him sway and Harry is by his side immediately. Before he even knows what is happening, he is swooped up and carried towards St. Mungo’s. He hates and loves it when Harry does that. For one thing it is incredibly hot that Harry is able to carry him so effortlessly, but on the other hand it is also kind of annoying being the damsel in distress.
Deciding that he cannot take it anymore and that he has been patient enough now, his hands fly to the buttons of his shirt and he begins to undo them.
“Thank you for coming today. It really meant a lot to me.” He kisses the top of Draco’s head. Draco feels so comfortable in his arms, the thought of having to let Harry go in just a few hours depresses him. He wants this. He wants Harry to be there, he wants to come home to him, hear his stories, banter, bicker and everything else as well. He knows what he has to do to get that. He has to start working for his recovery and with Harry by his side it feels like a manageable task.
When he turns towards Malfoy he goes from hard as a fucking tree trunk to flaccid in 0.2 seconds. This is not Draco Malfoy he has been lusting after just now. It is Scorpius. Best friend to his own son Al and so young that even without the connection he would have been able to deduct that he is old enough to be his father. Harry would do a lot of things, kinky things, but fucking his son’s best friend or anybody that young is not one of them.
He took the bottle and gently ran the nipple along the baby’s lips until he latched on without any further problems and started suckling.
Harry walks over to him and rubs soothing circles into the small of his back. He tries to breathe the nausea away and after a while the urgent need to vomit recedes and he straightens again.
“I do, Harry. I love you,” he repeats softly. And that is when the floodgates open and the tears begin to fall.
“Harry and Draco?” he asked thoughtfully. “Sounds just crazy enough to work.”
“No.” Draco’s answer comes promptly and Harry might have breathed a sigh of relieve if he didn’t have the distinct feeling that there was more to come. “I needed to know,” Draco continues, “I needed to know, if I have thrown everything away on a fluke or if there is something there. If I am really into that.”
,” he said, imitating Harry’s voice. “
“You wish, Potter,” Draco replied, and pushed.
Before he made his way to the bathroom to prepare for bed he quickly looked into the room opposite James’s. Two little beds stood there, only separated by a small night stand. A beautiful night light that projected moving stars onto the wall and tinged the whole room with a soft blue light made two tiny heads visible on the pillows. One was just as blond as Draco’s and the other the same messy black as Harry’s. If the twins weren’t sleeping soundly, one would have been able to see Scorpius’s grey eyes and pointy chin that made him a miniature version of his father. One would also be able to see Albus’s green eyes and knobby knees that made him a carbon copy of his other father.
“Yes, Draco,” Harry whines, “Yes.”
“Answer the question, Harry,” he purrs while he keeps up his torture.
At one point, the sobs stop and even the tears dry, but the feeling of having been violated doesn’t go away. He feels empty, scrubbed raw, as if every last one of his secrets has been cleaned out of him with a steel brush. Harry strokes his hair, when he looks up at him and their eyes lock, he knows what he needs and he knows that Harry won’t deny him today. He leans forward and presses his lips to Harry’s. Harry stiffens instantly and pulls back.
“Inside me, Draco. Touch that spot inside me. Please,” Harry begs and how could Draco deny him when he begged so prettily. “Oh… Draco…nnngh,” Harry moans, his eyes rolling into the back of his skull. Soon his fingers aren’t enough anymore. Harry’s omega craves Draco’s knot and Harry begins to whine in frustration.
“Do what you said earlier,” is all he manages and even though half of his face is hidden beneath his arm, he can still see him blush furiously.
“Clearly,” says Schmendrick. Draco feels his muscles rearranging his face into a frown. Was that sarcasm? He would have been able to detect it, if he was in the room with Schmendrick, Potter, however, handicapped as he is, isn’t able to detect it.
They fall silent again because what exactly does a person say after a story like that? He could, of course, say he is sorry again, but Draco probably doesn’t want to hear that. So, he blurts out the first thing that comes to his mind.
“I know,” Harry answered sadly.
“Is that any way to speak to the father of your unborn son on the eve of his birth?” Draco feigned outrage, drawing another laugh from his husband. His panic was successfully averted.
“How are you doing here?” comes Potter’s voice and it effectively rips Draco out of the onslaught of memories that threaten to consume him. He doesn’t answer.
“I’m sorry, Draco,” he pants, “I want to, Merlin knows I do. But I can’t.” Draco begins to struggle against Potter’s grip on his shoulders. He feels hot embarrassment and all he can think of is to flee this situation. His eyes dart across the room, looking anywhere but at Potter as he struggles to get the Prat’s hands off himself. But Potter doesn’t budge. He doesn’t let him go, instead he shakes him softly. “Look at me, Draco,” he demands. And although he wants to do nothing less, his eyes lock with Potter’s. He steps closer to Draco again; his hands wander to Draco’s hair and he gently pulls him forward until their foreheads touch. “I can’t take advantage of you like this. When you are feeling better, I will gladly do nothing else for as long as you let me. But right now, you have to focus on yourself.” Fucking Gryffindor. He leans in for another tender and way too short kiss before he says, “And now excuse me, I have to use the facilities to take care of some business.” Draco snorts as Potter awkwardly rights his pants and exits the room.
“You want to give it to me?” she asks and he nods again. “Thank you, Draco. It really is beautiful.” He smiles at her thankfully. Even though, he has been crying just a few hours ago, her visit has really helped him. He feels better about himself now. Not good, but better.
“Get dressed, I’m taking you back to St. Mungo’s,” he says, not looking at Draco when he speaks. Draco does as he is told. What else is he supposed to do?
When he is back in the chair opposite of him, Weasley starts a monologue that he has probably memorized for the occasion.
“You didn’t come?” he asks, feeling inconsiderate and stupid at the question.
“Look, she told me to send a Patronus if anything were to happen or if your contractions were about five minutes apart,” he told Draco.
“You will have to be more specific. I’m touching a lot of spots right now,” he whispers as his fingers keep pumping in and out of Harry’s body.
He makes some effort to follow his mother’s trial and when he hears the verdict, three years of house arrest, he zones out. His mother is safe, there is nothing he can do for his father. No matter how much it pains him to think of him in Azkaban, it is because of his choices that they are where they are and that he will end up there.
“No, I don’t want them. I don’t want to be all hazy.” He hated not being in control of himself. It was just one of the many quirks that the war had given him. He never drank more than one or two glasses, partly because he knew that he had a predisposition for addiction and partly because the lack of control scared him off. Drugs were out of the question, of course. The same was true for different calming and pain-relieving potions, because they made him drowsy. Cigarettes, however, were a very different story. He had smoked like a chimney since the middle of sixth year, but that lay in the past now, of course. He had smoked his last pack all in one day, the day that he and Harry had decided to try to conceive roughly a year ago. He had done nothing else that day but sit in the garden in the unseasonably warm September sun and smoke a big pack, naming every cigarette and making teary goodbyes.
“Come on! I thought about treating you to piece of cake. Schmendrick tells me, sugar helps with the withdrawal and there’s a lovely Muggle café a few blocks from here,” he rambles. At the words cake and Muggle Draco’s eyes light up and he is met by a relieved, toothy smile from Potter.
“Yes, yes anything,” Harry replied hastily, nodding his head quickly.
“Are you going to come for me like a good omega?” Draco asks.
“What is it? I’m– this is– Potter, this is killing me. Do you know how much self-control it takes for me to have this conversation with you? In about five minutes my alpha is going to take over and then there is no way of knowing what I might do. Let’s get on with it before I lose control, before I hurt you,” he rants or whines, a distinction Draco is no longer able to make.
“What do we do now? Are you going to knot me again? Because I know I have been kind of a wuss about it, but turns out it’s quite alright,” he says after a couple more minutes of kissing and groping. Draco snorts.
“You’re going to stop when I ask you to,” he says. It is not a question. It is as if Harry is sure that Draco will. Draco just hopes that he can live up to it. “And I want to see you,” Harry continues.
“Well, from what I’ve read it seems that your heat will drag on to up to a week. You will feel like you did when I found you, worse possibly, but it is going to go away on its own at some point. You don’t need me to get through this,” he recounts the facts, stressing that Harry can do this on his own if he so desires.
He breathes heavily, feeling almost self-conscious until he sees Potter’s hand snaking towards the door handle. He shakes his head at him. The bastard is not going to run off to the loo now. He has brought this on himself, he could have come together with Draco, buried inside his arse to the hilt, but he has chosen not to. So, tough luck.
“Luna, wait,” Harry had called out and followed her out of the bedroom. “We need you,” he added as soon as they were alone and out of earshot.
“I’m close, Harry,” he warns and immediately Harry’s body tenses, but instead of pulling away he nods jerkily.
He wishes Potter and the theraprat would leave him alone. The times when he hurt people, when he was a threat are maybe not long over but they do lie in the past nonetheless. All he wants is to be left in peace. He doesn’t want to harm anyone, he doesn’t want to talk (obviously) and he most certainly doesn’t want company. So, why in the name of Merlin does he keep bothering him? Surely, he has better things to do. Shaking hands, kissing babies, cutting ribbons, that kind of crap.
“Why do you know all this?” Potter asks and Draco shrugs. “I read,” he answers shortly. All this talking is becoming too much, when he is trapped in this confined space with an omega in heat and this scent that has his cock leaking and his fingers itching to grab the other boy.
Luna had apparently left the room at some point, because she was now holding a bottle out for Draco to feed his son for the very first time. “You don’t have to worry about that. Babies are more resilient than you might think,” she said.
Harry and Draco stared at their son while he fed and Luna quickly and efficiently brought the room back into its normal tidy state. She settled into the armchair, shoving Draco’s neatly folded clothes to the side, and watched them silently until the baby finished.
Draco had answered in the most confusing manner possible, by saying, “This can’t happen, Potter,” and kissing him passionately, painfully, desperately, before he took his Portkey and was gone. For another six months, or so Harry had expected.
“Don’t stop, Draco,” Harry breathes. Harry’s rhythmic clenching and his renewed effort to thrust into him, have his balls tightening again, his muscled slowly tensing as if they were preparing for another orgasm, when Draco knows full well that it isn’t possible not when only minutes have passed since his last orgasm. But suddenly it rips through him. He comes hard, spurting into Harry, who has gone limb in his arms. Draco gasps, overwhelmed by the sudden and unexpected sensation.
“Oh god! Have you had sex?” she screeches at about the volume of a roaring dragon.
“Oh, and you’re the expert now, are you?” Draco spat. “I want the fucking midwife I hired to help me deliver this child to fucking get her arse over here and DO HER FUCKING JOB.”
“What?”
“He’s not wrong though, is he?” Harry asks, heat flooding his face instantly. They have breached the topic of repeating last night just a few moments ago, or rather they have briefly touched upon something that could have turned into the topic of them repeating last night, and Draco hasn’t sounded too eager then. So, maybe he is lining himself up to be shot down.
“Huh?”
“Everything hurts, I feel so hot, every inch of my body is itching like crazy. What is happening to me?” he repeats. Draco sits down in front of Potter cross-legged, even when his cock is painfully constricted by his trousers, even when he is hazy with lust.
“Yes, you are,” Draco argues, his voice is husky and strained. It takes all of his self-control not to grab the other boy and have his way with him, when his cock and at least sixty percent of his brain are telling him to.
He grabs Potter’s hand and wraps it around his cock, because if Potter refuses to touch him he sure as hell isn’t going to touch Potter. Let him get a taste of his own medicine. Potter’s breath hitches and he begins stroking himself immediately. Draco looks down at Potter’s cock, his own cock stirring with interest again, when he sees the head of it appear and then disappear again between the tight ring that Potter has formed with his fingers. He looks up into Potter’s eyes and he strokes his hands through his hair. Potter leans into the touch, his eyes fluttering closed. After a few seconds of stroking Potter’s surprisingly soft hair, he lets his hands roam under his shirt, flicking over his nipples. Potter whimpers and lets his head fall to Draco’s shoulder. It doesn’t take long until Potter’s movements become erratic. He stiffens suddenly and just as he starts gushing come into his fist, he whimpers, “Oh God, Draco.”
“As much as I know that you wouldn’t do that, I swear to you that I am going to hinder you from locking our son up in a closet,” he answered. For a moment, Harry looked like he would start listing more things that he might do wrong, but then he snapped his mouth shut, pulled Draco close, and kissed him. Draco pulled back a fraction and continued, “I’m also not going to allow you to order him to do any excessive amount of house or garden work. You won’t be allowed to install bars in his window, except on the off chance that he is a girl after all.”
They fell quiet and Draco used the time to quickly take stock of his body. He was surprised to find that Harry’s massage had really done wonders for him.
“I’ll leave you a couple of pain-relieving potions that I recommend. We wouldn’t want Draco to tire himself out before the big showdown,” she had said, winking at Harry, and laid a small package on the bathroom counter.
Before he even has a chance to consider it, let alone process anything that Weasley has just said, his head moves to nod without his permission. He barely notices Weasley setting up the chess board and by the time he is able to form anything resembling a clear thought they are already half way through the first game. He loses dismally but by the second game he puts up more of a fight and by the third he begins to enjoy having to use his head for something else than stuffing food into.
“No, I’m exhausted. It hurts. I don’t want to keep going. I want to stop now,” Draco answered.
“You remember I said that, do you?” He blushes even deeper.
“What is wrong with you, Potter?” he asks, but there is no heat in his voice only genuine amusement.
“Bed without supper will not be an acceptable punishment. And the only cat flaps that you will be allowed to install will be for actual cats or kneazles.”
After three weeks’ worth of visits from Potter’s friends Draco cannot take it anymore. He takes a piece of parchment and scribbles down a note.
“I can’t stop calling you Potter. It’s my thing,” he jokes earning himself a shove in return. “No, seriously. I have put some time into pronouncing it perfectly. You have to really mean the consonants and you have to kind of pull up your upper–“ He is silenced by another kiss.
“You’re right,” Draco said. Harry immediately recoiled, but Draco shot his hand out and pulled him close. “In the highly unlikely case that several of our lives are at stake at the same time, you are probably going to plead with the Healers to save my life, whereas I am going to tell them to save my son’s life over mine. However, I would also tell them to save yours over mine.”
“You haven’t either, Draco!” the Prat says in a gentle tone that doesn’t fool Draco. Because, of course, he has. Potter rattles on, “Anyway, he has proposed to Ginny last week. I could never have pulled something like that off. So, I guess I should be happy for her.”
witty.
Fortunately, after about thirty minutes Schmendrick’s owl returns with a new roll of parchment tied to its leg. He scratches the owl’s head before he unties the parchment with shaky hands.
James had strong magic. It wasn’t much of a surprise, considering who his father was, and Draco had been happy to see the first signs of it as early as nine months after his birth, when James had been lying in his crib one morning, apparently bored, and made the little Quidditch players in the mobile above his bed fly around. Now it sometimes was quite the hassle. Just last week, James, who had been over-excited because he was allowed to choose the decorations for his party, had exploded a priceless Malfoy heirloom vase. It had been butt-ugly, so Draco wasn’t too put out, but it had been quite some work to get all the shards out of the wall and the surrounding furniture. Not to mention what might have happened if anyone had been standing near the damn thing.
As soon as they are seated, everyone starts loading up their plates with food, not paying any attention to the new addition to their Sunday lunches. Silence falls over the table, only interrupted by the odd “Can you pass this?” or “Can you pass that?”, and Draco uses his chance while everybody is occupied to let his gaze wander and take in with whom exactly he is dining today. There is Granger and her Weasley and fuck, the sheer number of Weasleys makes it necessary to call them by their first names, doesn’t it? So, there is Hermione and Ronald, sitting opposite of him and Harry. Then there is the oldest Weasley, Bill, the one who has been attacked by Greyback, his scars still looking grisly. Next to him is his wife, who if possible looks even more beautiful than she did back in his fourth year. Next to her sits George, the remaining twin. Seeing him makes him nearly gasp with surprise. He would have thought that he couldn’t be arsed to show up when he had lost of his brother which must have been… well, worse than Draco could ever imagine probably. He feels the distinct urge to kick Harry for lying, because George hasn’t been to see him at JTW. Ginevra and Theodore are there as well, but he isn’t really sure what to make off that. Should he be glad that there is another Slytherin there or should he be on the lookout because he is sitting next to Harry and she is not? Then there are Mr and Mrs Weasley, of course, and he immediately notices that Mrs Weasley has obviously lost a lot of weight after the war probably while mourning all of their losses. He also notices that she isn’t digging in with the same vigour that all the others are showing, but pushing her food around her plate glancing at her family from time to time. He isn’t fast enough in averting his gaze, because suddenly she catches his eyes.
“Mr Malfoy is in no condition to consent to anything at the moment. I was very fine with you taking him out, because it clearly helped his recovery. He has gotten way better since you have been visiting. Before you came by it had been one year of zero progress and look where we’re at now. But that, of course, doesn’t mean that sex should be a part of your interactions with Mr Malfoy.”
The part, however, where Potter accused him of acting as if he were the only one who has suffered through a traumatic experience, stings. And it stings probably because no matter how badly he wants to deny it Potter has something resembling a point. It has been a while since he has noticed anything about Potter that gave anything away about how he is dealing with all of this. He remembers how gruff Potter looked at the very beginning, during the first months of his visits. But somewhere along the line Potter has either started looking better or Draco has stopped noticing. He tries to conjure up Potter before his mind’s eye. How has he looked the last time he has seen him? Have the dark circles under his eyes disappeared? Has he looked less drawn and more rested? For the life of him, he cannot say.
“What’s wrong,” Harry asks, immediately concerned, and Draco just takes his hand and puts it on his stomach, throwing a suffering look at Harry who opts for a mock-stricken look.
“But it’s hard,” Draco whined.
“I know, Draco,” Harry said soothingly. “But I’m here. We went to all these birthing classes,we know how to do this.” He stepped further into the room until he stood right in front of Draco. He reached out towards him and pulled him close. “I’m here,” he repeated.
“Good morning,” he says cheerfully, giving both of them a cheeky smile. The nerve of him, Harry thinks in half-hearted outrage. He has got him laid, so how much indignation is really appropriate?
Potter closes the door and instead of walking further into the room he leans against it. “So, has Hermione given you the ‘Harry is more fragile than you think he is’ speech?” he asks without further greeting. Draco nods. He grunts, annoyed. “Well yes, that has happened once or twice. I guessed as much when Ron asked me if we were ‘shagging’.” He uses air quotes to indicate that this isn’t his wording. He looks grim and suddenly it hits Draco that Potter knows exactly what is going to happen now. His suspicions are confirmed when Potter says, “So, I guess this,” he makes a circular gesture with one hand, “isn’t going to continue, is it?”
“I-is that g-good?” Despite himself, Draco snorts quietly. What else could it be?
“You sure?” he asks, throwing Draco an uncertain look. Draco merely nods because he doesn’t want to keep Harry from participating in what seems to be a Sunday tradition. Harry smiles at him radiantly and bounds off the chair towards the door calling out, “Prepare to get your asses whipped, you sorry losers!”
When Malfoy is naked he sits on the edge of the bed so that he is facing Harry. He spreads his legs, presenting Harry with his swollen cock. “Strip,” he says and takes his erection into his hand, stroking himself leisurely. “Slowly.” Harry complies, just as turned on by following Malfoy’s orders as he has been by Malfoy obeying his command. He opens the buttons of his shirt one by one, then loosens the cuffs, before letting it drop to the floor.
“Merlin, yes, Potter, please,” he whines and without further ado he licks one broad swipe along the crack. Draco’s whole body twitches at the sudden sensation. But instead of giving Draco time to get used to the sensation, Harry grabs his cheeks greedily, pulling him closer still, and starts licking and sucking Draco with abandon. Just as he has hoped Draco makes the most delicious noises and when he pushes his tongue past the ring of muscles he hears the electrifying broken moan again that surely could make him come by itself.
“You said I would be finished once I held him in my arms,” Draco replied petulantly.
Potter interrupts his thoughts by nudging him gently and pointing to some sort of black box that is situated on a board, facing the sofa.
“I just… I thought… we’re doing a pretty good job with the kids, aren’t we?”
“How?” Potter asks, “Have you done this before?” Draco shakes his head angling his head to kiss the other boy again, but Potter pulls farther back and even though he could easily overpower him in his state, he lets him hold onto the pretence that he has any sort of control over the situation.
“Of course I do. I agreed to ruin this God-given body to fulfil your lifelong dream of having a family even though you are as bent as a corkscrew.”
Ten minutes later they leave for the shop. Draco is surprised to find it actually half way decent. The assistant obviously knows Potter and doesn’t seem to be amused about him being there with another man. When he glares at Draco, he barely suppresses a snort. He might be a teeny tiny bit depressed and may have a touch of PTSD, but the smirk he flashes towards the assistant can simply not be helped.
“Yes,” Harry answers. “I want to push myself inside you. And don’t get me wrong, it is still going to hurt. I’m big, Draco.” He winks at the other man, who sucks in an audible breath. “You are going to feel every inch of me, every vein. You’re going to feel my pulse, every beat. And I’m not going to give you time to adjust either. I’m going to fuck you deep and slow and hard and you are going to beg for more, because that’s how much you’re going to like it.”
When he walks out of his room, Potter laughs at him and he is suddenly vividly reminded why he went with the byname the Prat in his head for such a long time.
He huffed angrily and turned on his back, knowing full well that within minutes the weight of his belly pressing on his spine would make this position unbearable as well. He managed approximately five minutes before he had to turn again, this time towards Harry. When he looked over, he saw Harry blinking at him.
Probably the worst thing about being pregnant was the near constant need to pee. He felt like he had been doing nothing else but run to the toilet every twenty minutes for the past six months or so. Obviously, that was an exaggeration, but still, it was annoying.
“No,” he breathed, and Harry tensed, because he knew that if Draco refused to keep pushing they would get into some serious trouble. “He’s going to have your atrocious hair.”
“Yes, please Draco, I want… I need,” he begs almost incoherent.
“If you must. But only when I’m wearing clothes and not during my heat,” Harry negotiates.
“I couldn’t help but notice that he responds to you.” Fucking therapist, what a fucking prat. Theraprat. Draco smiles to himself slightly, he may be silent but he is still
“I love you.”
“You wanted to make a good impression, didn’t you?” Harry inquires, smile audible in his voice, and Draco hides his face in the crook of his neck in shame. He is sure though that Harry is able to feel the heat of his blush.
“Well,” he begins, “Al and I thought that you two could hit it off, so Al talked Mr Potter into a midlife crisis and I made him take me home before he could prove to himself that he still has it in him to pull someone at a club. You know the rest.” He shrugs again, a smug grin on his face.
Harry leaves him for a couple of minutes to speak to Schmendrick and then they’re off. The sunshine on his face, the wind in his hair, Harry’s hand in his left and a kebab in his right are glorious. Harry has picked up pretty quickly that Draco has no desire to spend any more time indoors and so they walk through a nearby park, find a bench overlooking a small pond and eat in companionable silence. That is all they do the first day.
He had handled his divorce in a similarly reasonable way. Even when it had been followed by his great bisexual awakening. By pulling different guys in different bars every night for four months straight, until he felt like there couldn’t be a gay or bisexual wizard or Muggle left in London that he hadn’t shagged. He had had to make up for lost time. And don’t forget the firewhiskey. Because it had been there. It may come as a surprise that his children hadn’t been his biggest fans during that time. But they came around eventually.
When Potter the Prat enters the room, he breaks through Draco’s haze, because of course he does. Potter has always gotten under his skin. Draco turns on him and starts to throw punches at the other man. He lands two or three before the Prat catches him by the wrists and quickly turns him around, so that Draco’s back is pressed against Potter’s chest. Draco uses the hold that Potter has on his upper body to kick at everything and anything within his reach.
“So, Hermione wants me to be the bigger man. And Harry too, off course. I am though, literally. I’m taller than you. That should count for something.” Draco rolls his eyes. Weasley ignores it. “I’m going to do the whole manly thing. Build a house, father a child, plant a tree, all that rot. So, as far as I’m concerned, I am the bigger man. Very secure in my manhood, I am.” He smirks at Draco. “Of course, that’s not what Hermione is talking about. She wants me to be friendly and what not. She wants me to accept that you and Harry are an item. Can’t really say that’s a surprise. He has always been kind of stuck on you. And now that he has finally admitted that he is gay, it makes a whole lot more sense. Ginny tells me you’re quite good looking. I don’t notice such crap, but if she says so, I guess it must be true. Well, better you than me, right? That would have been awkward. Harry fancying me instead of you.” He snorts.
“Harry Potter is such a fuckin’ bitch,
Everyone looked at each other, and Peeves went on:
Not afraid to show-show,
“I’m sorry sir,” Harry muttered.
“We just have to prevent you from having sex, that shouldn’t be too hard - especially for you, Potter.”
“Now Draco, it hasn’t been decided yet. It was merely a suggestion,” Lucius said, trying to calm him down.
A door just beyond the gate began to creak open, a purple boot stepping just beyond the threshold. A curly haired man who happened to look exactly like the late Gene Wilder began slowly limping towards the gate, cane in hand.
Everyone stepped through the gate. Willy Wonka shot up and ran to Lonesome Lucius and gave him a big hug and a smucho on his cheek. Laborious Lucius stood uncomfortably stiff. “Okay, I have reached my threshold of human contact for the next ten days, please cease this juvenile behavior at once.”
Peeves held up a finger and shot Harry a murderous glance. “I wasn’t done, you little git.”
Willy petted Dobilina’s long blonde hair and said, “Oh, where was I? Oh yes, those eyes. Well, anyway, as you can imagine, this kind of relationship isn’t very accepted in the Wizarding World. Sometimes, Dobilina and I stay up late together, talking about how it’s as if our world is being written by a casually racist T.E.R.F. who says strange things on Twitter.”
Willy scrunched up his face to the size of a large pistachio. “You take that back! I knew you were a hateful person, but I never expected such hateful words to cum from your thicc, delectable lips!”
Upon seeing the lady house elf, Lucius immediately sneered, ground his teeth, and swallowed the stray tooth bits that cracked off. He was about to shout, but Narcissa punched him in the right testicle.
Hermione ecstatically raised her hand.
Draco smiled, scooting on his butt back to Harry, his feet extended in front of him. Just when he was close enough, toes outstretched salaciously, Professor Trelawney busted down the door and rushed in.
“Well, seeing as we don’t really have any other options, I guess we’ll have to,” Lucius said, defeated.
Willy released his embrace, moving towards Narcissa. “Oh, my sweet, supple Narcissa! You look ravishing.” He kissed her ring, sucking the gem directly out of the center. Narcissa giggled like a grown school woman.
Instead, he fell flat on his face and laid there for a bit.
long ago; however, Draco’s feet had never been seen uncovered in public before this moment, and they were
“I know! Sorry!  Ugh, I’ve gotta talk to Professor Trelawney stat!” Fighting his baser urges, Harry zipped up his pants and booked it to her office.
deaths, like the butterfly affect or something.  Like if you go back in time and change one thing, then everything else goes completely awry - unless you have a Time Turner.  Then the regular rules go right out the window.  Anyway, that’s what me having sex will be like.”
Harry entered Draco’s room first, and as usual, Draco wasn’t far from his behind. The walls were covered with posters of manly British Wrestlers like Twisty Teeth Todd and Bulging Bullocks Ballanski. Almost every square inch of the room leaked testosterone - every inch except for one corner. That corner had shelves neatly arranged with an assortment of stuffed animals.
Suddenly…. BANG BANG BANG.
The Malfoys and Harry all sat scrunched together on a cut-in-half couch, as Willy sat in front of them on a halved recliner. Willy began to speak, “Now, I’m going to introduce you all to someone who is very special to me. I wish I didn’t have to preface with this, but I’d really appreciate it if you all could be as polite as possible, because I really do love her. Also, she’s smokin’ hawt.”
“I fell down the stairs,” Harry replied meekly.
Lackadaisical Lucius walked up to the lock and unsheathed his wandy thing from his caney thing, aimed it at the lock on the gate, and commanded, “
Harry gathered himself and covered his whomping willow with the ripped sleeve of his robe. “Well,” he nervously swallowed, “Dumbledore told me he never wears anything under his robes and that underwear constricts all the magic.”
“Lord Voldemort give me the strength…” Lusciously Thicc Lucius muttered under his breath.
had nothing on this.)
“How can you be so sure of that?”
“Oh no, it looks like you tore your robe again,” Draco whispered mischievously to Harry’s large penis. Immediately, it shot up, uppercutting Draco in the chin and sending him flying 3 feet back onto his butt. “You’ve got one strong cock,” he commented, impressed.
She glanced solemnly at Harry, hardly able to keep eye contact, “It means you’re destined for bad sex! Also, your cum tastes like stale Doritos.”
Dobilina smiled. “Dobilina’s intuition, she guesses.”
“Works every time,” Lupin said, proud of himself. “Now you see, the only way to stop a Blowgart is to think about the thing that turns you off the most. For me, that thing is Rowan Atkinson - but for you all, it can be anything.”
“Well,” Draco said, “We have many.”
Frustrated, Harry knew he couldn’t stop now. He kept up his rhythm as quietly as he could. However, Draco’s shoes squeaked nearer and nearer, singing out the chorus of My Fair Lady now. “Why is he coming so close?” Harry wondered right before Draco threw open the broken stall door and lunged down, butt-first.
Harry was miserable as he sat through the duration of Potions, his buttcheek skin clinging to his stool. No one could look at him - except for Draco, that is - who Harry kept catching glancing back. What made things even worse was that he could not get Draco’s perfect feet out of his head! He wanted to lick every crevice (or whatever else feet people like to do with feet).

A cold sweat began to develop on Harry’s brow, “What does that mean?”
Ron’s eyes widened, “Quite a sticky wicket we got us here, right so.”

Yeah, the Voldemort stuff was bad and all - but that seemed like a “tomorrow” sort of problem.  After all, procrastination had worked really well for him during the Triwizard Tournament, so there was no point in trying new things.

Draco came around the corner in front, stepping down into the dungeon as Harry came down on his right. Their fiery gazes met in the middle, but instead of completing their daily ritual like always,
