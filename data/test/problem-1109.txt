Hogwarts had changed, he realised. It wasn’t a bad change. The walls stayed the same, the same cracks, but the people had all changed. Harry noticed he didn’t feel a daunting feeling or fear or jealousy. This, looking upon a happy Hagrid teaching a united class, with a hippogriff by his side, it felt like things would be okay.
The table just laughed it off, and Harry tried not to feel jealous of what they had. He knew he had it once too, in the 5 year void in his mind. Malfoy came into his mind, in glimpses of smiles from breakfast, or quick looks of concern during dinner.
He so desperately wanted it back. His memories, his life, his smiles, the connections. How it could’ve all just gone, Harry didn’t know. Hadn’t Harry suffered enough in his life? He died and came back just for this?
Harry slowly got up. He sat on the floor next to the table and faced Malfoy heaving on the kitchen floor.
The flowers that dotted the patches of grass around the trees were new. Weeds of different colours, existing in beauty where no one could tell them they couldn’t be. Harry sat in the shade of the tree, looking at the lake, watching its ripples, the castle in the distance.
Before Harry could spend more time thinking about that new and scary observation, the door opened. Ron walked out, Kingsley following suit.
“Yeah, ‘course.” Harry took a swing of his beer. “Actually, I’ve been meaning to ask, how did you all meet? Again, I mean.”
A few minutes into the diagnostics, Ron and Hermione came rushing in. Concern and worry on their faces. For the first time since he woke, Harry realised they all looked slightly different. Older. More mature. It was probably nothing, but Harry felt that discomfort in the bottom of his stomach.
“Yeah, and Harry went straight for the treacle tart, didn’t he?” Neville added from the dinner table.
“It’s okay, Ma-Draco and I left a little early anyways,” Harry smiled, hoping no one caught the slip up.
It would explain why Malfoy didn’t run or hide when Harry’s magic exploded just then. There was no other explanation for it. No matter how close you were, a sudden surge of magic would surprise anyone.
During Malfoy’s apprenticeship, his research began to expand into the world of muggle science, in particular to biochemistry. That’s why there were many muggle science books on the shelves. He found ways to make potions a little easier to brew, last longer, and act faster. It took him a long time to do so, but he gained the confidence to tell his teacher, who gave him the confidence boost Malfoy needed to open shop.
Kingsley looked at him oddly for a second before closing the door behind him. “Let’s do some physical checks.”
“No, Harry.” Malfoy looked back at the papers and began shuffling them faster than before. “We’ve had this conversation countless times before but you don’t remember, so I’m going to tell you for the first time again. I support your career choice, Harry. I love how passionate you are about it, but... There are other ways to help the world and save people.”
Kingsley stood up slowly, mirroring Harry’s stance but with a gentle kindness in it. “You’re not mentally ready to get back on the field. You need a change of perspective, it’s what almost got you killed.”
“I know what you’re doing, by the way.” Neville’s voice shot right through Harry, and all the guilt, fear, and jealousy rose up like bubbling lava.
He quickly got ready, changing into some decent clothes that hadn’t been slept in for hours on end. He ran down the stairs, and drank a tall glass of water.
while he… well, he had almost nothing but the friends and family he knew would never leave him. It should be enough, right? So why did Harry still feel so jealous of everyone, even himself.
In record time, Malfoy walked in with two plates, bacon and eggs galore for his day off. Harry knew Malfoy deserved it, the time off. He’d been stressed with increasing sales, masking it with a proud smile.
Harry couldn’t feel anything. It was as if his entire body had shut down. He couldn’t feel his heart beating, or his breathing. There was no feel of bile bubbling in his stomach, nor the jealousy that had been his motivation for so long.
Harry nodded in response, and felt the anger turn into a slow simmer. He sighed, and tried to control himself. Nothing made sense. None of it made sense. This unknown Malfoy, the unknown Harry of before, this unknown Hermione, Ron, Isolt. It was all unknown.
It wasn’t the answer Hermione was looking for, and Harry wasn’t ready to give that answer yet, but he wasn’t lying either.
They made it to the apparition point. Harry could hear children playing and screaming in the park just a few metres away. For a split second, he thought of Teddy, and how much he’d enjoy running around with them.
“Hmm.” Teddy looked at him like he was analysing his every move. Then he looked at the cards. “Let’s keep playing, I’m going to win.”
The three of them just stood there, a counter between them. The mix of emotions were simmering low in his chest, and he thought of what he could do besides run.
Grabbing his wand, given back to him at some point by a faceless person, he cast an Incendio, and watched as each printed sentence burned. There were still a million copies, but at least it wasn’t in the same room as him anymore.
“Greg, give Nott a drink, there should be one more leaf in the cabinet.” Neville said, as he took off his coat.
Before he could even move, he felt a new cleanliness wash over him. It was refreshing and filled with Malfoy’s magic. It lingered for a moment before slowly washing away.
Neville wasn’t taking it though. “They didn’t notice, but I did. Harry, I’ve known you since we were 11, so I know when you’re not thinking right.”
Harry turned as Malfoy finished placing lunch on the table. The food looked absolutely delicious. His stomach rumbled once again, startling Isolt.
Isolt still wasn’t back, Harry realised as he looked over to her corner. The window was still open wide, gusts of air pushed through encouraging Harry to breathe in slowly.
Harry looked up at Malfoy. Malfoy’s tone of voice was so questioning it was almost authoritative. It threw Harry off.
The fight paused in his body. Why wasn’t Malfoy fighting? Or running away? Harry blinked his tears away as his other fist kept clenching.
”You look just like a true Black. Though not quite enough self preservation. What could a sweet little thing like you be doing here?” Bellatrix tittered, enjoying every second. In the darkness, Magdalena could pick out the faces of Dolohov, Rookwood and other Lestrange’s. Merlin she was in trouble.
It was a command rather than a question so Harry nodded slowly, there was something wrong he could feel it. As Harry headed up the stairs he could still feel Vernon’s eyes on him, he was angry at him for something, very angry. What could Harry possibly have done to enrage him so early in the morning? Maybe Dudley bruised his fists on Harry’s nose? Harry tried not to laugh at the thought, it sounded like a plausible explanation knowing his relatives.
The mans head lolled as he fell into a deep slumber and Magdalena sighed in relief. She grasped the thestral by its reigns and stroked her hand across its head. She wished there was more time for her to build up trust with the animal, but time was a very valuable resource to her.
“Well, child, if you are to be seen associating with my household, you must fix your hair at the very least. Good day.” Walburga added, before Maggie pulled Harry up another flight of stairs and into an impossibly large room with a scarily high ceiling, green carpet and three large hoops on either side of it.
“Oh yeah!” Harry said, sitting himself down of the floor, which was surprisingly soft and bouncy. As Harry's fingers tore through the brown paper he looked up at Maggie who was fumbling in a large brown cupboard near them. “Mags? How's this room so massive? It shouldn't be able to fit in your house.”
There was one time where she’d been crying after her parents had gone away again and left her in the care of some distant relatives and Sirius had come to rescue her. She must have only been about six. He sat her on his knee and dried her tears before giving her the biggest and brightest smile.
His hands skimmed on Harry’s strong tights and used them to leverage himself from the floor. Harry muttered a spell under his breath and soon the chair he was sat on transfigured into a loveseat big enough to accommodate both of them.
Harry bent forward, assuming a classic missionary position, holding himself up with a single forearm, placed on the side of Draco's head. Immediately, he found himself with hands in his hair and hungry lips on his own. While they kissed, he had to slow down his pace, because fucking, jerking and kissing his boyfriend simultaneously was too arduous even for him. But, God, if it was not heaven! Kissing Draco was like kissing the ocean. So deep and overwhelming that he could lose himself in it and never return. It was like kissing the Moon, that drew the weaves of the sea like as he attracted his lips with a simple smile. It was like kissing a fallen angel: sinful and blissful.
When Draco woke, it was with dread in his chest. He was up and dressed before Potter had woken. The soft breath coming from the other boy's bed made Draco long to be peaceful like the unconscious savior.
Harry spotted watery boot prints that lead in a straight line towards the back of the house. As Harry followed the trail, he wondered if he could convince Draco to stay his Christmas at Hogwarts, away from this cursed house. Harry was met with another open door and a trampled grass trail that he followed with a quickening pace, the cold making him shiver.
“Cigarettes and calming draught.” Draco choked out when he realized his cigarettes were in his pocket in the pair of pants he had shed by the pool.
“Probably, yes. I erm- it just helps a bit.” Draco hated the croak in his voice and glanced down at his tangled bed sheets.
“Well, then I must insist that you call me Draco.” Draco propped himself up on an elbow, feeling his stomach do somersaults.
If this was how he was feeling now, he was certain he would have to sell the manor. It was a shame for a house such as this one not to stay in the family, or at least that’s what his mother would have said. He looked up at the too-large building and felt vertigo began to sweep through him.
Draco closed his eyes and leaned his head back until he felt Harry’s presence sit down beside him. He watched as Harry gingerly handled Draco’s wounds, wrapping and cleaning each one. The scar tissue of the area would make a healing spell useless, and Draco knew that. Harry plucked the cigarette from between Draco’s lips and vanished it, and then he curled so that he was holding Draco.
Draco had risen from his bed while Harry showered in his bathroom and had begun to make tea in the large and mostly empty kitchen.
"I owe my life to your mother, I was repaying her. How is she?" Potter's face was unreadable, but Draco was certain his wasn't as he felt horror wash across him before he could wipe it off for the neutral disinterest that he was known for.
As Draco approached his childhood home, he felt as though tethers of darkness were latching onto him and pulling down. The sky was lightly spitting down and gave the cold air a foreboding that looked natural for the manor. The grounds were covered in overgrown yellow grass, and any flowers his mother had planted were nothing but crunchy piles of decomposition. The house loomed over him like his father had when he was younger, powerful, and full of hatred.
This time when he pressed the razor into his branded skin and dragged it he took solace in the stinging flesh that he no longer considered his own. Yes, it was Draco’s nerve endings that lit up when he opened the skin, but it was not his; it hadn’t been his for quite some time. Flashes of his marking ceremony took his memory in clutch as he continued his actions. He watched omnipotently, his body writhed as Voldemort’s wand met his skin.
“Yes. I could go back to the manor.” Draco couldn’t piece together why he had asked Harry in the first place, but he figured it had something to do with talking to literally no one else for weeks.
Two years in and they bought a house, they both now saw a therapist of their own and their bad days became less frequent.
“Yes, but dinner is long over, as I’m sure you're aware,”  Draco didn’t like the onslaught of questions coming his way. “Besides, these wondrous little objects do as a fine meal replacement.” Draco allowed more smoke to seep past his lips.
Once he had stuffed his clothes haphazardly into his luggage, he waved his mother's wand to summon a house-elf, before remembering they had freed them all after the trials and he was glad when no one appeared to help him pack. Some of his favorite elves had begged to stay, cried on their knees, but Draco had to look away, disgusted with their loyalty as he presented them each with idiotic little vests that he had spent several weeks sewing by hand. They could only truly be free, far away from here.
Once in their room with the door closed Draco dug around for seconds before finding a cigarette and lighting it, throwing his robe down and falling onto his bed in one fluid motion.
Draco stood in front of Harry, who slowly unbuttoned his shirt. Harry’s eyes were piercing Draco’s soul with the directness of his stare. Harry’s shirt came down and rested at the crooks of his suntanned elbows. Harry offered a crooked smile as Draco took in the wonderful body in front of him.
“Fuck!” and there was hot liquid gliding down Draco’s throat as he swallowed diligently before pulling from Harry’s deflating cock with a pop.
When Draco took his N.E.W.T.s he knew he passed with flying colors, and he was right. Harry whooped and cheered when they got their scores, Draco’s being at the top percentile.
“Stop watching me sleep, I can feel your eyes burning my skin!” Harry’s deep morning voice complained as he took his pillow from below his head and covered his face with it.
“I forgive you for the past you know, you were just a kid.” Harry's voice had said it but Draco was certain it wasn’t him who spoke it.
“This is the eighth year table, you can sit with Slytherin if you like.” Harry rubbed at the back of his neck as if he felt wrong for leading Draco to the table they sat at.
When the holidays were over and they returned to their normal pace Draco became more trusting of his environment, even going as far as attending classes.
“M-my bedside drawer.” Draco didn’t like talking in this state as more tears stained Harry’s shoulder though, he thought it was the literal least he could do.
The beads of red pursed at the newly puckered skin and he felt satisfied to see his past treated in such a way. Draco was taking control of the thing that controlled him and it brought him endless satisfaction to see that repulsive skull and snake weep blood.
It would be nice, Draco thought, if loving someone and being loved cured people. He would like that, but it wasn’t how the world spun. Draco had never known this to be more true than right then.
“Draco?” His given name drew him from his thoughts with a start, the last person to call him by his name was dead.
“What in the world do you have to be sorry for right now?” Harry’s hushed breath ran over Draco’s ear.
There stood Harry Potter, his tan skin glistening in the morning light, his hair wild, his eyes piercing in Draco’s clothes. The black slacks came up too high on his ankles, and the white button-up strained slightly on his shoulders. Draco had seen pornography less enticing.
“Come off it.” Draco huffed as he gingerly lifted the pillow and was met by emerald eyes that never failed to knock him senseless.
When they had stumbled back into their room after the gift of a pitcher of butterbeer from the elves had been split between them, they were very lightly buzzed.
Draco walked down the long, overgrown pathway to the edge of the pool, thankful that Voldemort had killed the peacocks as they would have come and chased him away.
When they arrived at The Great Hall all heads turned to The Savior and The Death Eater with an array of looks from confusion to disgust. Draco was unsurprised at the reaction while Harry seemed to shuffle uncomfortably for a moment before leading himself and Draco over to a table that claimed no house.
"I- I don't read the prophet." There was a strange shift on his face and for a moment he looked ethereal in a way that made Draco's stomach roll. He could just walk out the door and go back to The Manor. He didn’t need all this. He was rich and could surely afford to miss out on the last year of his education. Yet, he sat down on his bed and began to unpack.
“You smell like lavender, your laugh sounds like a birds song, you are kind, you are smart, the clothes you wear fit you perfectly, your skin is like snow, I can pick you up, you talk in your sleep, you count on your fingers, you hum when you’re pleased, your breath tastes like cream..”
“Isn’t it a little early for a smoke?” Harry questioned, still sitting beside Draco’s fragile form, hand resting on Draco’s shoulder like a plaster over a wound.
Draco thought of all the times he couldn’t find his breath, all the times Snape had slipped him a calming draught, all the times he had collapsed and gasped in various places.
“No, no, I quite think it’s better if I stay here at this point.” Draco thought of the hexes that would be thrown if he were to get up and walk across the hall and shuddered.
“I’m sorry! Oh my Gods! I’m so sorry!” Draco began to remove himself from beneath Harry, who was unmoving.
Without a second thought, Draco rose and walked with his head held high towards his dorm. As soon as he had made it around the corner though, he found himself rather dizzy, leaning against the wall for all the support it could give as his aching body sagged. He was certain he looked a right state with his shaking body being covered in bright red stings and his willowed appearance.
Draco and Harry continued in their pattern for a while, they would have conversations here and there, Draco would smoke cigarettes and cover his dark mark in scar tissue, Harry would go to classes and bring back food from the kitchens, they only woke from nightmares once in a while, and it worked.
Draco felt warmth begin to settle into his bones and he hummed in agreement. Suddenly, his arm was pulled from his side and his eyes shot open. Potter was holding his arm up to his face, the arm covered in self-inflicted carnage. Draco pulled back and shuffled to get in a better position when he realized he was buck naked. It all came back to Draco with startling clarity, the pool, then Harry, now the bath.
Unlocking the barrier between him and his roommate, he was met with emerald eyes looking at him in concern that made him squirm within himself.
When Potter saw he had gotten his attention, he said something that took Draco more back than his name.
Draco thought he might scream but found he lacked the energy. “Everything! Everything’s so wrong! I was so wrong!”
“Yes, I use the bathroom at least three times a day for your information.” It wasn’t Draco’s best come back, he could admit that.
After a year of living together, Draco only smoked one cigarette a day and hadn't harmed himself for months.
Before Draco could even wrap his hands around the brunette’s neck as he so wanted to do, a house-elf appeared between the two with a plate of cheese and assorted fruits, disappearing just as quickly after setting the plate in Draco’s shaking hand, his cig between two fingers on his right hand completely forgotten.
“Oh, thank you, it’s beautiful,” Draco whispered his worlds, eyes unmoving from the delicate flower that sat behind the glass.
Going to take what he hoped to be a soothing shower before an early night, he walked into the en suite bathroom. He shed his clothing in several fluid motions and placed his too expensive soaps. The water sprayed over him like a balm, and he hummed in satisfaction.
Draco had known for a long time that he was gay, he had known it before he knew how to fly a broom. Draco's attraction to men was a fact of life to him, not abnormal until one day his governess had told him he had to have a child.
The buffet, positioned against the wall instead of the Slytherin table, was covered with every conceivable delicacy, from appetizers to desserts, which in his opinion were the most impressive. Towers of shiny candy apples red as blood, that looked simply delicious, profiteroles with green and purple icing, pumpkin pastries, red velvet cupcakes with bats shaped cookies on top and much more.
He just wanted to help. Giving him a way to distract himself from the pain. That’s why he offered the two of them to chaperon the students at the Halloween ball. Harry did not appreciate. He had not seen him so angry in a long time and the fact that all that anger was directed to him was heart-breaking. And as if that was not enough, his stupid defence mechanism was to put on his impassive and icy Malfoy mask, which made Harry only angrier. Being called “an ice-cold hearted prick” was rather hilarious since his insides burned with love for him. Not that Harry knew, since Draco was a coward and did not have the gut to say those word first. Too much at stake. His heart in the first place. Besides, he had never been good at showing vulnerability and his weakness. Malfoy did not have weaknesses. That’s what his father used to say and what he used to believe. Which was absolutely absurd, because, at that very moment, he felt like the softest touch could break him like crystal to the ground.
The sex had been simply godlike. Slow and sensual or hard and passionate, Harry never failed to make him scream, and beg for more. Deliciously hung, Harry fucked with his whole body and mind, leaving Draco, more often than not, limp and incapable of form any sentence with real meaning. And while their performances in the bedroom were, to say the least, impressive, what Draco loved the most were the little things. The secret smiles they shared in the Great Hall, in front of everybody; the furtive touches in the hallways, the way Harry could make him laugh and the other way around. How they would use their first names only when alone, waking up in the same bed, kissing goodnight and good morning. It was incredibly sapless from him, but as a Malfoy, he never had the chance to experience such things. But now, with the Malfoy name fallen in disgrace and his father in Azkaban, he had nobody stopping him from pursuing what he really wanted: being in a sweet tooth-rotting relationship with Harry Potter.
As usual, they did it in the bathroom. It has been a while since the last time. Harry had been away on a mission for some time and when he came back all they could think of was making up for the lost time. Kissing until they had no air in their lungs. Exploring each other’s bodies like the first time. They had never had so much sex, but in their defence, it had been the longest time they had spent away from each other. Two weeks when Draco had to sleep in an empty bed, touching himself as the only way to satisfy his sexual desire. So, as soon as Harry walked through the door, he could not control himself.
“I told you to wear something comfortable and casual.” Stated Harry, sounding resigned but fond at the same time. He arched a blond brow, a grin twisting his lips. “Hello? Have you met me? This is the most casual you’ll ever get from me. Better put your heart at peace, Potter.” He took the helmet Harry was handing him and wore it. He straddled the motorbike and wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist, resting his chin on his shoulder. “Hold tight.” Said Harry, wearing his helmet and starting the engine. And he did just that, holding onto Harry as his life depended on it. As they set off, he tried to concentrate on the feeling of his body against Harry’s and not his fear of that infernal ramshackle. The things he did for love.
After he had asked Narcissa for permission to marry her son and her blessing, which she offered with a humble and warm smile and a kiss on both of his cheeks, he felt appropriate to include Pansy. Calling her just a friend would have been offensive, for Draco she was family, one of the few people who had always stood by his side, even in the dark times. She was the one who had not run away after the war, but had decided to stay, for Draco and to prove that people could change and do better. She was as much of Draco’s soulmate as he was. That was what he had said when she inquired why he was asking for her blessing. He could swear he saw tears in her brown eyes, that she tried to hide since she had a reputation to live up to. Being a cold heart badass witch was a full-time job after all. She offered her help, for which Harry was very grateful, because he wanted to look at his best and he did not exactly have the best fashion taste, and Pansy knew it.
That was why he had proposed a ride for their little date. Harry had been so busy, being Head Auror and all, and he knew he needed those moments where he could feel connected with his family. It was not much, but it was all he could do.
Resigned to his horniness, he let his mind wander at its pleasure. To Potter’s strong arms, his hairy chest, his navel and his big… and fat…cock? Because it was big, right? Or was it not? He stared for a while at the wall. No thought, mind empty.
Feeling his own orgasm building inside his crotch, he gave his all and something more. He bit down on Draco’s shoulder and he felt his ass tighten around him and so the grip in his hair. Draco came with a cry, over Harry’s hand and their stomachs. Harry did not falter and kept fucking into him, still not over the edge, knowing that Draco loved to ride his orgasm until the last spark of pleasure.
They came to a halt on top of a hill, where they could watch the view from above. Harry parked the bike on the side of the road and then they made their way to the very highest. Taking care not to be seen, even if no one was in sight, he summoned the picnic basket Kreacher had prepared for them with all the necessary. After they had laid down the wide red and blue checked blanket, he made himself comfortable.
When their hearts were filled to their content, it was time to fill their hungry bellies. They ate side by side, fingers intertwined, and lips swelled from their long session. While denting his sandwich, Draco could not stop to smile. He would have felt embarrassed if Harry would have not been in the same condition. He wanted to be annoyed with the man for turning him into a lovestruck fool but then decided to embrace the foolishness. It felt too good.
“The last who gets to the showers is a loser?” The grin on the other face was blinding. “Ready, set… go!” They both jumped on their feet and run, their laugh filling the lockers room. No towels around this time to hide Potter’s body away from Draco’s hungry eyes.
Pansy was right, he looked good. With his well-groomed beard and messy curls, he could almost be passed for a model. He was not as tall as one, but heigh was the only thing he lacked, and he knew he compensated in other departments. As was clearly visible by the prominent bulge that his trousers did nothing to conceal. He felt a little bit uneasy to showcase his goods so arrogantly, the only one he wanted to show what he was packing was Draco. But as he imagined the reaction of his lover, he hoped, soon fiancé, he found the boldness he was so in need of. That day he had to be the daring one and gather all the bravery that Gryffindors boasted of so much of.
“You also forgot the pillow marks on your left cheek,” He mused while stroking a thump on the specific area. “And you’re just being dramatic. Your breath doesn’t stink that much.” For that, he deserved a punch. Not too strong, just enough to let him know he was a prat. “Ow!” Laughed Harry, massaging his shoulder, a big contagious toothy smile brightening his whole face. Damn it. It was impossible even to pretend to be mad at him. “You’re such a prat. I don’t know why I put up with you.” He said without a real bite but rolling his eyes for effect anyways.
With every second passing by, Draco felt himself drown in the feeling of having Potter in his mouth. His taste, his smell, his heat, his sounds. They were everything and more, being enough to make his dick hard like never before. He felt drunk with euphoria, and he was sure he was slowly getting addicted to Potter’s cock. His hunger took over and he swallowed another inch, proud of himself for not gagging. “Oh, God…” Whispered in a little growl the man above him, “You’re doing so good Malfoy, but don’t force yourself, I know I could be a little… much.” Since Potter was still able to talk, he had to step up his game.
“You’re like a grumpy kitten when you wake up, you know that?” Harry chuckled amused, wrapping an arm around his waist. Draco wanted to disagree, but all he could manage was a mumbled “fuck off”, which made Harry laugh even louder. The waves of his laughter vibrated through his body and he could feel a sleepy smile forming on his lips. He loved Harry laughter, it was so carefree and sunny, it could light up an entire room. “Well, you’ll have to wait until I’m done. Be good and stay put, all right?” He hummed and felt the body underneath his move slightly, rearranging to accommodate him and the new position. He let Harry go back to work since he was scratching pleasurably his back, with slow and tender movements. If he could purr, he would have done so. Which was an embarrassing thought, because Malfoys were no kitten.
“Ah! I really needed this!” Exclaimed Harry, smile as bright as the sun, running a hand in his flattened hair. The excitement he exuded was palpable and made his heart glad. Seeing Harry happy was a gift on its own, but knowing he helped a little bit, was even better. “Did you enjoy the ride?” Asked the man, eyes wide shining vibrant with energy and life. “Yes, I did. This time I didn’t feel like dying, so it’s an improvement from the last ride.” He joked with a teasing smile, accommodating Harry behind him, who wrapped his arms around his waist. His hands covered Harry’s and he breathed a content smile at the warmth of their bodies pressed together. “Who knows, maybe you’ll be the one doing the driving one day.” “With you pressing against my back? Your crotch touching my ass? I don’t think so. Too distracting. I know for certain I will go off-road the second I start the engine.” He deadpanned.
As they looked into each other eyes, their lips soon met again, as being pulled by an invisible force. The kisses were so heavy with love, that he was getting drunk on them. He could taste tears on Draco’s lips, and he could not tell whose they were. After a while he pulled back, as Draco followed his lips in an adorable attempt to continue the kiss. “Why did you stop?” He inquired breathlessly. Harry smiled pleased by the desire in the other voice. “You have to choose the ring, so I can put it on you.” “Oh, right. I forgot about the rings.” Admitted in a whisper that Harry found so sweet and endearing that his heart throbbed with delight. He showed the rings to him, who looked intently at the two of them. “How come you don’t have the Malfoy family engagement ring? Did mother not want to give it to you?” He asked with a frown that indicated he was worried, and he felt his heart drop and blood go cold. He should have known better to choose by his own the rings. “Actually, I’m the one that refused the ring. I just thought we both needed something new. Something that was just us and nobody else. I’m sorry, I should have known better. If you prefer your family ring I can go back to your mother and ask her-“ His rambling was cut off by a soft kiss.
He gave a good lick from base to head, his tongue flat against the rock-hard shaft, but incredibly smooth. Potter shivered at his action, leaning back and hands in a strong grip on the edges of the bench. It was only the beginning. He wanted to make Potter scream his name while he came from his mouth, see him lost in pleasure, panting and moaning for more. He wanted to make it so good for Potter, blow him out of his fucking mind, that he would fuck his mouth like a beast.
A hand came to hold him at his waist, soothing him with gentle strokes with his thump. Luckily the head was not the largest part of his cock, so it went rather easily in, but after that, it was all thick hard flesh. They both gasped as he lowered another inch. “You’re so big.” “You’re so tight.” They both moaned at the same time and laughed together at the soft silliness of the moment. “We’ve been through this, dear. It’s not me who’s tight, it’s your cock that stupidly big.” His voice came out a little strained but talking while being fucked by a dick as big as Harry’s, was not an easy feature.
Being a working day, the road was desert. The sky was clear, except for a couple of white fluffy clouds floating carefree. It was a rather warm autumn day, and the three’s leaves on the side of the road were tinted with a beautiful palette of warm colours, which seemed to have been carefully chosen by a skilled painter. Browns melted with reds, yellow and orange met in-between, looking almost like burnt caramel.
But running away would have also meant to leave behind so many beautiful things in their life. His mother and the afternoons spent drinking tea in the greenhouse. Pansy and Blaise and the brunch where they would gossip about everyone and everything. The noisy and crowed Weasley lunches and dinners, that he lowkey anticipated every month. His aunt Andromeda and Teddy, the only kid on earth able to melt him with a touch. He loved Teddy so much, but how he could not, when he was such a sweet and smart boy? No, there was too much to lose. Too much that was worth the fight, not only his relationship with Harry. Being brave did not come easy for him, but when you fall in love with a Gryffindor, you learn that courage comes in many forms. And choose to stay was one of them.
“So good, so fucking good for me, love…” He muttered as he was approaching conclusion, his balls rising and his mind going blank. “You fucked me so good, Harry… Come for me, fill me with your come…” Draco mewl into his ear and it was enough to push him over the edge. His body tensed and his cock throbbed inside the warm and tight hole, coming with force and emptying his cum till the last drop. He rode the wave of pleasure through and through, with strong and deep thrusts, embracing the burning feeling in his low abdomen and cock. His body shivered from the intensity of his orgasm and gave up, making him fall, with all his weight, over Draco, who huffed at the impact.
In Harry’s arms, dancing in their kitchen in a world of their own, Draco thought he could not be happier. He was actually overwhelmed by how much love he was feeling at the moment, the bad mood of before completely forgotten. His heart was beating loud and fast, but it always did when he was near Harry. In the early days of their relationship it scared him to death, because he was so dangerously in love with the man that if they would ever break up, he would simply fall in pieces and never recover.
Only after many minutes under the hot stream of water, he realized he was still smiling like a fool. He scowled at the tile wall, scrubbing with energy his armpits. What he was not going to do was spending his time thinking about Potter and his glorious body. But just as he thought formed in his head, images of his toned and virile body flashed in front of his eyes. Damn it. In the last ten minutes, he had broken two of his precious rules. Precious rules that were set for his own mental health: don’t look too much at a naked Potter and don’t think about him naked. While he failed those rules more than he would like to admit, the only consolation was that at least he tried. But he was weak and gay, while Potter was strong and hot. It had been a lost battle since the start.
He was just beginning his second year of teaching, when his rather dull and lonely life was turned upside down by the arrival of Harry Potter, hired as the new Flying instructor, Quidditch referee and coach, called by Headmistress McGonagall herself.
“Wow.” Breathed stunned Harry and it made him chuckle into his neck. “Always so eloquent.” He teased, feeling a tender smile tugging his lips. “It’s not my fault if you rode me stupid.” Bit back his boyfriend, pressing a kiss against his temple. A gesture so simple and innocent, after all they did, but that it made him blush nonetheless.
“Why, thank you, Potter. I’m glad we did it because if not, my next assignment would have been helping old witches cross the streets. And I don’t do old, or witches.” He said feign boredom, but his heart did accelerate at his own words. It seemed he could not help but flirt with the man.
“Good morning, sleeping beauty.” Teased the man, as Draco made his way into the room, walking around the desk and stopping in front of him. Harry looked at him with brows frowned and a curious glint in his eyes. “What?” Without a word, he opened Harry’s arm and straddled his lap, wrapped his arms over his shoulders and nuzzled his face into his neck. Finally, home.
“Now, this is definitely a more suitable setting for what I’ve got in plan for you.” Mused Draco, straddling the man lap, big hands coming to hold his waist. “And what do you have in mind, if I might ask?” Teased Harry, a playful smile ghosting his lips. “Ride you slow and deep. As long as possible.” He saw the man pupils dilate at his words. “I like the sound of that.” The words were whispered against his lips, just before they met in an unhurried kiss. His hands climbed Harry’s body till finding their place in his messy hair, his long finger interlocking in the curls and tugging just slightly. Harry slipped his hands under Draco’s robe and cupped his arse, squeezing his flesh with intent.
With a heavy sigh, and a want for communication, he walked down the stairs. He put on the bare minimum into getting ready to see Kingsley, knowing that his clothes would get sweaty anyway, and left the house.
She passed the law for same sex wizard marriages, and created gateways for squibs to be introduced into the magical world, and for wizards to learn about the muggle. Harry was amazed at how much she’d completed in the 5 years. But at the same time, it was Hermione, filled with determination and courage.
Malfoy had time to spare a glance, but couldn’t wave them off before a scream and a crash echoed through the shop. Harry inwardly cringed and tip toed out the door to where Parkinson and Zabini were waiting patiently.
Hermione, bless her, had started reading into muggle biology textbooks about memory loss and bringing it back. She suggested visiting places he’s been too before with other people, or simply just talking to the people he cared about. Ron smiled at her, and rolled his eyes as he did when Hermione started her neverending information talk.
It wasn’t much at all, but at least it wasn’t a lie. Harry didn’t know how to act like he was in love with Malfoy. But he guessed lying low was the best call. Lara did say we were ‘a secretive lot.’
Malfoy continued moving, adding final touches to the dinner. “You thought a lot of things, Harry.” He smiled gently at Harry, then gestured to the plates. “Can you bring those to the table? I won’t be a moment longer.”
“You can have all those things while still being a mess, you know.” Malfoy countered. “But what I mean is, you were just as much of a mess as he was. Haven’t you noticed?”
Harry had to stay in St Mungo’s for a few weeks longer. His days were filled with spells and diagnostic charms that it all started to meld together. All Tina could do was watch over him and wait for any memories to come through while he was hospitalised.
Then he thought back to Hermione’s words. Words that had somehow gotten even more distant in a time he believed he probably needed it most. He hadn’t thought back to those words in what felt like years, as if those words melded themselves into the memories of before the 5 year void.
Malfoy smiled at the remark. “Yeah, I guess so. Younger us would never have imagined we’d be as civil as we are now.”
She laughed lightly in response. “Teddy’s missed you the most, he never lets go of that plushie now.”
Harry just gave a half hearted smile, and decided to put those words, his own words, in the ‘for later’ pile. He’d analyse his own words later, for now, it was about someone else.
In fact, he stopped doing anything but work. He received letters from the connections of Lia Adwin, and had secure plans for a chat. That was one of the few things that seemed to be moving.
He didn’t like where this conversation was going. He needed to veer it back into a built up memory, so they could laugh about things Harry didn’t remember, talk about experiences, and joke about a life that’s been taken from him.
The trio started talking about whatever they could. From auror missions to meetings with higher ups. It was just a blur for Harry as he ate his delicious fish and chips. Harry still didn’t offer any more than 3 words at a time.
Harry nodded vigorously. They continued to eat lunch in peace, saving a lot of the food for Malfoy. Turns out, the trio didn’t really have much of an appetite after that confrontation.
Harry nodded in understanding. The small area was perfect for studying and thinking. It had the aura of the Hogwarts library but it didn’t make you feel like you were drowning in books.
“We limit the amount of electricity in the house,” Malfoy said, catching Harry staring at the candle chandelier. “Our magic messes with it too much. That’s why we just use it in the living room where all the books are.”
“Congratulations on your wedding, by the way! I am so sorry I don’t remember anything about it.” Harry cringed internally at himself with that fact.
“Harry, you make it out like all you had before was everything,” Malfoy started, talking in a tone of finality. “But back then, when you were living in it, you thought you had
He remembered strategies and protocols being drilled into their brains. Drawn up plans of action, and veteran aurors telling us why each was successful or a failure. How life seemed to be looking up for him, that his future seemed to be coming up and it was.
Harry sighed in relief. Confidentiality is one of the utmost important things working in this department. Lavender, Ron, Harry and everyone working under Kingsley Shacklebolt understood its importance.
Harry’s heart sank a tiny bit and shook his head. “No, no memories have come back at all. It’s frustrating, there’s small things I don’t remember, things I didn’t even know I used to do.”
Not to mention Neville’s words of warning, borderline on a threat, but knowing he meant well. It was difficult and it didn’t make Harry feel any better. He knew he’d probably keep going with it.
“Yeah, Nev. Just wondering, why do we duel so often?” Harry took a sip of the water in front of him.
Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini were not dating, but seemed to be very close. They got along with so many people, easy smiles and cheering of glasses shone through every photo they were in. It was incredible.
Malfoy was scraping the last of the food from the pan onto a plate. The smell of the dish hit him so hard he started salivating. His stomach roared loudly.
Malfoy blinked, then lowered his wand. Harry caught Malfoy’s slightly clenched jaw, and knew the question before it was even going to be asked.
As the students filed out of the hall, led by their Heads and Prefects, Neville and Harry said their goodbyes to the professors. It was brief, but definitely needed as he gave Minerva and Hagrid one last hug.
He wanted to keep fighting, to leave and fight this battle another day. But he was stuck in the snake pit. The vipers slowly wrap around his body, strangling him slowly but surely.
That day he spent at his desk, making sure all the details were ingrained in his head. He only got up for the occasional hit of coffee.
Much too soon, the class was over. As Harry helped the third years pack up the knick knacks from Hagrid’s hippogriff grooming lesson, the students talked to him about the duelling club.
Malfoy never came back after the day Harry first woke up. He started to think maybe he hallucinated him ever being there. But asking about Malfoy made Ron, Hermione, and Tina change the subject almost immediately. It wasn’t like he
The group of students turned their heads away and continued their conversation, unaware or uncaring of Harry’s slight confusion.
Despite all the memories gone, Hogwarts hadn’t changed. The walls still had the same cracks, the same weeds, the same feel as they did before. Hogwarts was still there, seemingly untouched by the lack of his memories. It calmed him.
Somehow, that made Harry feel a little better. Isolt stood proud on Malfoy’s shoulder, unaware of his shirt stain dilemma.
Lastly, there were the books. His favourite books, and a bunch of new books he wanted to read. There was a moment where he stopped, unsure if it was worth it because maybe he had already read that book. Maybe he already disliked it.
When the eagle owl left, Malfoy seemed to release a lot of tension. Like he’d been scared or something with the owl having been there.
He worked quickly and efficiently, and never failed to wish them a good day, even if they were rude or disrespectful. Even with the new influx of customers, Malfoy seemed to work just as he did the first time Harry visited.
“Ah, I was just going to ask what’s for breakfast.” Harry looked over at what looked to be a pancake batter half mixed in the bowl. “Pancakes?”
The kitchen was exactly how he’d imagined it would be. A big bench countertop to accommodate his culinary experiments, a sink that was deep enough for large pots, and cooking utensils hanging next to the window, all jagged and messy. It was the complete opposite of the kitchen he’d grown up with at the Dursleys. This was exactly the way he’d imagined it to be all those years ago. He applauded the Harry he couldn’t remember, he wished he could tell him how proud he was.
Harry tried to breathe normally. He knew a given opportunity when he saw it, and Kingsley handed it to him on a silver plate. Thankful that Kingsley didn’t push him, he gave a small smile. But even so, his brain started caving into itself.
“Because we are not friends anymore, Potter. What’s the last thing you remember of me, hm? Of us?” Parkinson hissed.
“Here’s the floo, Harry. International is on and everything,” Neville led Harry to the corner where the floo is
“Harry…” Neville started, but with one look at Harry’s face, filled with conflict and confusion, he let it go. “Goodbye, it was good to see you again. I’ll beat you the next duel though.”
Harry just kept smiling. Going to Hogwarts was like a breath of fresh air, a well needed hug, and a gentle kiss on his forehead. Hogwarts would forever be his home, and he couldn’t see himself ever not visiting. He guessed that was why he helped with Defense Against the Dark Arts class and duelling clubs.
The healer’s eyebrows furrowed in confusion. “Tina. I’m healer Tina.” She scribbled some notes onto her papers as Harry tried not to look at Hermione who gasped softly.
Harry slowly opened his eyes, and was amazed at how much time he’d spent wallowing in his own sad thoughts. The shadow of the tree was even longer as the sun descended closer to the horizon.
Both Harry and Isolt jump. Isolt spreads her wings to regain balance but they smack Harry’s face. As soft as the feathers are, they do not taste very nice.
How jealous Harry was of his old self, how he knew he’d be a better guest than he was now if only he remembered.
“Oh Merlin, is that tikka masala?” Harry asked as he moved to sit down on the chair opposite Malfoy.
“Oh, I bet Draco went on and on about what a matchmaker he is,” Harry joked, trying to get used to the way Draco felt on his tongue.
“You could start tomorrow, or the day after that. Just make sure it’s within 5 days, and that you let me know at least a day beforehand.”
Harry looked at them and smiled, genuinely smiled. The slow simmer in his chest was controlled, and he knew he had them. That it was successful and that it had worked.
Harry watched as Malfoy picked up his wand and pointed to the corner where the table of candles were.
“Yeah, I probably could.” Harry teased, surprised the animosity he usually had was almost gone. “How’d you start cooking? You don’t need to tell me, you were uncomfortable before but I thought maybe I coul star-”
Harry turned to look at her, gobsmacked. “But I’ve been right he-…” Harry didn’t continue his sentence. He knew it would be a lie.
“Thank you, Harry. They didn’t show it, but they were nervous as all hell to meet you again.” Neville whispered.
Every lunch break, Harry would spend it with Malfoy. Even if the customers only continued growing, even if Malfoy told him to take him and his paparazzi elsewhere, even if more ridiculous headlines popped up. He knew he’d be there again.
Well, to be fair, Harry’s silence and blinking dumbfounded face was completely reasonable. He wasn’t expecting that question, especially when it wasn’t the main focus in many of the writings about himself.
Harry’s fear spiked, but when Teddy quickly moved to hug his legs, it went down just as quickly. Harry carded his fingers through the blue hair. Teddy let go and put both of his hands up. Harry took this to mean he wanted to be carried.
They continued walking down. When they passed another door and Malfoy didn’t note it, Harry stopped. “What about this one?”
But tonight was the grand celebration at the Burrow. No one has contacted him yet except for Ron and Hermione. Molly hasn’t sent an owl, nor has Neville. He wondered if everyone was gonna be there or if some had other plans.
“It was one hell of an experience. Think of it this way,” Ginny looked like she was trying to find the right words. “The both of them were heavily intoxicated, and Celestina Warbeck’s hit single Cauldron Full of Hot Strong Love started playing.”
Through snickers, Malfoy asked, “Merlin, Harry. Do you have an angry erumpent trapped in your stomach?”
Harry knew deep down, that if the auror raid was successful, he’d do everything the same again. He didn’t know anything else but results, that’s what everyone had dug into his mind.
Tina laughed and it echoed down the empty hall. “That’s what you said before. Even without your memories, you’re still you.”
He could feel the back of his eyes start to ache again. He thought he had no more tears left, but here they were, ready for round two.
Malfoy put his food down on the table. It wasn’t completely finished, but he ate more than yesterday. Harry, on the other hand, gripped his bowl tighter.
This was going to be harder than he thought. How had he befriended them before? Were they this guarded when he met them?
Hours passed, and Harry barely got a break to breathe before lunch was finally taken in the cafeteria. Kingsley and healer Tina by his side, talking about Harry’s results.
“Hey, Harry. I’ve been doing great. Hogwarts has been great, oh and guess what,” Neville said with a bright smile.
His throat hurt slightly. Telling stories truly wasn’t his strong point, evident by his constant backtracking and stops in the middle of his sentences. But Kingsley, probably used to it, didn’t care.
Malfoy stepped back, letting Harry be the one to open it. It was a small gesture, but it meant everything.
How Harry had forgotten that, he didn’t know. It was a long time ago, but he always knew that kids were observant. That’s how they grow. They watch, and listen, and learn with every single thing adults do. So of course Teddy knew how to stare down someone, or how to communicate well, it was all things he’d learnt from being around a variety of adults at all times.
He looked back at Hace who paid him no attention, and then to Tatus who seemed to ask him if he was okay. Just how different was Harry with his memories gone? Had he really lost the life he had built from one damn mistake on the field?
His heart fell to the pit of his stomach. Did she know what he was doing? Could she tell? Or was he just that bad at pretending?
“I do a good thing for you, and you think I’m being selfish? I had a feeling you’d react badly to them if you were surrounded by them, so I packed them. Now here you are, throwing it all back to me.” Malfoy’s voice was like a snake’s hiss, and seemed to weave itself into the walls of the house. “You’re the selfish one.”
What Harry realised just then was that the only thing that forgot anything from the past 5 years was his mind. His body still remembered it all.
“Last I heard from her, she was good.” Malfoy sighed. “I forgot you didn’t know. She’s living in France now, and is living her life. We… um. We don’t talk as much as we used to, but when something happens, we send owls. I just thought the worst when I saw the owl, I apologise for not thinking.”
Half an hour or so later, Malfoy and Harry were saying goodbye to each other, wishing each other well for the day ahead. Harry told Malfoy about going to Hogwarts, and Malfoy just said to say hello to McGonagall and Neville when he got there.
“Draco Malfoy speechless, that’s not a sight you see every day.” He walked to him and handed the red roses, while placing a soft kiss to his cheek. “Happy anniversary, love.” “You’re out of your mind, Potter.” He stated with a big smile on his lips, eyes crinkling and a dimple showing. “I’m mad for you. Only you.” Draco’s eyes shined with so much love that his breath was taken away. He kissed him again, this time on those beautiful and tempting lips, tasting earl grey tea and lemon tart. It was slow and deep, Draco wrapped his arms around his neck, bouquet still in hands, and surrendered in his arms.
“I need to apologize too, Draco. I did not mean the things I said. I was just angry, and I regret every single word. I should have talked to you instead of storming away. I promise I’ll try to do better in the future because I’m planning to never let you go.” Draco smirked teasingly. “No need to threaten me, Potter. You could have just simply asked.” Harry’s soft laughter full of joy and he could not help but join in. “You’re a prat, Draco Malfoy.” He said with so much fondness in his voice that Draco’s heart swelled two times its size.
Later, after a shower and an orgasm, they ate breakfast in their bed in nothing but soft bathrobes, feeding each other with goody smiles plastered on their faces. It was domestic, it was romantic. It was perfect. They could not take their eyes off each other.
“Happy anniversary, love.” He whispered over his lips; eyes closed in ecstasy. “Happy anniversary, Harry. Can you believe? Three years have already passed, one of which we’ve been living together, and we still managed to not kill each other.” He opened his eyes and saw the fond smile on his lover. “You sound surprised.” Draco shrugged elegantly. “A little bit. I mean, living with someone it’s not an easy task, there’s always the possibility to clash with the other habits. Morgana knew, how many times I wanted to strangle Pansy when we lived together,” Harry chuckled, remembering how Draco used to vent about his friend. It was what prompted him to ask to live together. It was one of the few times where he achieved to reduce his boyfriend speechless.
“Let’s begin, then.” He took the electric body groomer, of which he was initially terrified, and set a medium length, not too short, just enough to trim a little. Being careful, he trimmed Harry’s pubes. As the dark hair fell to the floor, he could feel his pulse beating a little bit faster, his mouth dry. He loved to worship Harry’s body, both with words and with actions. Harry deserved it. Every single inch of him deserved to be adored and loved, and Draco was more than happy to obligate. Being the one with the privilege to kneel in front of the Saviour of the Wizarding World and watch, touch and love, was all he had ever wanted. It was not about submission; it was about showering Harry with love. Not the shallow and empty way of his adoring fans, but in concrete terms. Not for his name, but for the broken man behind it. Not for his power, but for his heart of gold. Not for his fame and money, but for the simple and loving man he was.
On the other hand, Draco liked to worship his body with soft touches and kisses, exploring every inch of skin at his disposition, making sure to ignore his cock as long as possible. One would have thought it was just out of tenderness, but he knew better. Draco knew it drove him crazy. The little teasing bastard.
Harry slipped a hand from under Draco's thigh, wrapping it around the other’s dripping cock, which had smeared with precum the flat and milky stomach. “Oh, God! Yes, yes! It’s so good, so damn good!” He felt his hole clenching around him, and it made Harry see stars. “God, you’re taking me so well, love… Your arse feels incredible… Always so thigh for me, you were gagging for my cock, weren’t you?” “Yes, yes! Give it to me, Harry! Fuck me into the mattress, I want to feel your fat cock all day today! Until I come home so I can ride you stupid!” Merlin, his mouth. His nasty lovely mouth. It drove him crazy. He fucked him as hard as he could, with deep and precise movements of his hips, hitting every time his sweet spot.
Open as wide as he could, he presented his mouth in offer. Soon the weight of Potter’s cock was once again on his tongue and strong but careful hands on both sides of his head, fingers interlocking with his blond hair. Potter started a little tentative, only thrusting half of his length in his mouth in slow motion, which was not bad since it gave Draco another chance to get used to the intrusion.
“I’m going to give you one thing: the flirting was subtle, it took me a while to catch on, but the staring was not. We’ve spent enough time at Hogwarts staring at each other that I can sense your eyes on me even in a room full of people. So, tell me: there something I can do for you, Malfoy?” He whispered low and deep, his voice slipping on his skin like warm honey. Since when did Potter become so secure of himself? Confidence suited the man. Maybe too much and Draco’s dick seemed to agree.
Potter changed a lot since he joined the Auror training program, the scrawny short boy had blossomed into a handsome strong man. He grew taller, almost reaching Draco’s height, one of the small mercies of his life, cause if Potter would have grown taller than him, he would have been simply too much to handle. Delicious light-dark skin covered solid muscles, achieved through hard work and training. Dark hair covered his wide and strapping chest, dark nipples bounced along with the vigorous movements of his arms. An inviting happy trail obscured his flat stomach, where it was visible a rippling line of abs, disappearing into the dark blue towel wrapped around his slim waist. He never hated a piece of fabric more in his life. He did not have a good view of his legs, but he knew that he possessed thick thighs, that he wished to be smashed with. That would have been a great way to die. Or choking on his dick. That would have been even better.
He was almost about to surrender to his boyfriend, when Draco stopped his administration and popped his dick out of his mouth. Cold uncomfortable air hit his wet skin, but he was curious to see what the men had in mind. Without a word, Draco climbed up his body and pressed their bodies together. Their dicks slid against each other and he felt Draco’s precum wetting his stomach. For some unknown reason, Harry’s heart started to beat faster and his body shivered in anticipation.
As some unknown singer started to sing, something slow, melancholic, he started to put on the makeup for his costume. Looking like a vampire was not a difficult achievement when you were as fair as him, but he did not like to half-arse things. Not to mention that, when you feel down, looking your best could help make you feel better.
It felt divine. The soft walls wrapping around his dick, the hot and pornographic sounds that Draco made, how he was losing himself into pleasure. How sex with Draco could always be so exciting and satisfying, he did not know. Maybe it was their perfect compatibility, or maybe the various kinks they shared, or maybe the fact he was mad in love with the man. Their eyes met, greys thunderous skies filled with desire, passion, lust and adoration. His heart skipped a beat. Pulled by the magnetic gaze,
Draco produced little moans of pleasure, while working up and down his cock, and Merlin knew if it was not the most hot and sexy sound Harry had ever heard. Draco was a demon. A very hot and capable sex demon. There was no other explanation for the way his lover could drip sex only by emitting little sexy noises.
He was not sure where he stood with his colleague. When Draco became professor, Longbottom had already occupied his position for a couple of years. He thought it was essential to apologies to the Gryffindor for the way he had treated him in the past, which had proved to be the right move, as they had managed to maintain a more than jovial professional relationship. With Harry's arrival and the beginning of their relationship, Draco found himself to be more friendly with him. He was not sure if they could call themselves friends, but Draco had to admit that Longbottom was quite clever and humorous. He did not mind spending time with him. Maybe in a little more time, they would call each other friends. His old self would have rather died than becoming friend with a Gryffindor, but at the moment he was also being fucked by one, so there was no room for complaint. Besides, if there was anyone who had learned that the war between the houses of Hogwarts was simply ridiculous, it was a reformed Slytherin Death Eater.
“You’re pardoned. Just because you sang to me, while being almost naked.” As they were now still holding each other loosely and see each other faces, he saw the way Harry’s eyes sparkled at his praise. “Good to know all I have to do to make you forgive me is being naked and sing along to some sappy song. Noted for future references.” “Please, like you don’t know the effect you have on me every time I see you without a shirt.” He huffed out, pinching his boyfriend ass for good measure. “Hey!” Harry laughed out loud, a bright wide smile on his lips, still swollen and shiny by their long kiss.
He turned around, locking eyes with Harry for a quick moment, before kissing him on his chapped plump lips. He soon found himself sprawled out on Harry, who laid down on the blanket, his gloved hands on his hips, holding him close. They kissed languidly, mouths moving slowly and tenderly in a leisure dance where the music was the beat of their own hearts. Their kisses were almost innocent, no heat or lust, just the craving of tasting each other. Enjoying the act for what it was, a demonstration of affection and kind love.
Draco held in a sarcastic comment he would have made years ago about how lucky he was to get a room with the savior, trying his hardest to not just turn around and go home.
Draco knew his feelings could never be reciprocated. Harry Potter was the chosen one and Draco Malfoy was a death eater. It didn’t help that Harry was probably definitely straight.
“I-I’m okay, just- can you grab my blanket for me? I’m freezing.” Harry’s voice was nothing more than a tearful whisper and Draco was instantly doing as he was asked, wrapping the blanket around Harry for good measure.
Draco’s body sagged onto his bed and he placed his hands over his face, rubbings at the stress under his skin.
Now, without the company of his roommate, he felt rather lonely. He loved his friends but with their relationship now completely official he felt himself taking a step back, seeing them together made him happy in the most unfortunate way.
Draco nearly agreed, wanting to agree desperately so that the aching throbs would stop pulsating through his entire body, but just as he was about to open his mouth he was reminded of the blemish on his forearm that he could not hide without his shirt.
Grabbing his shaving cartridge, that went unused due to his inability to grow the smallest splash of facial hair, he kept his gaze distinctly on the brand his forearm held. He placed the cool metal onto the disgusting blemish and idly wondered if his mother felt this way when she slit her own wrist. He had no aim to end his life as his stinging slices slid opposite to hers. It barely struck him, the whacks of his father's cane being an often occurrence had built his pain tolerance early.
They had lunch, and shortly after they prepared for their little adventure. They instructed Kreacher to prepare a picnic basket, for them to summon later on, with sandwiches, some kind of dessert and something to drink. Draco made himself presentable while Harry took care of the motorbike. He dressed up with a pair of grey wool trousers, a dark blue turtleneck, black Chelsea leather boots and matching belt. When he was satisfied with his appearance, he took care of his face, styled his hair, brushed his teeth and put on a little bit of perfume.  He completed his outdoor look with a midnight blue double-breasted coat with a belt, one of his favourites, since emphasized beautifully his narrow waist. The final touch was a pair of black leather gloves, that his mother had gifted him the last winter, to keep his hands sheltered from the wind.
“Well, not everybody owns a magic map of the whole castle. I had to improvise.” He replied softly, feeling a slight blush rising on his face. He embraced himself, searching for some warmth in the cold night air. “You could at least put on a heating charm before doing so. You’re freezing for Merlin’s sake!” And just like that, Draco’s body became warmer and warmer. A wandless spell. Salazar, why had he to be so charming and caring? Why had he to be so perfect? How could Draco resist him when Harry managed to show concern even when mad?
