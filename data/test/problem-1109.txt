“You fucker! You let me practically wank myself to death and you knew they knew it! Oh my god! How can I ever look Hermione in the face again?”
Malfoy grimaced. “Yeah. I hated that part of it, at least before he started to figure out what was going on. I have enough trouble sleeping without reading about somebody whose lack of sleep is driving him slowly insane.”
“I’m planning to make my announcement on the first day of the Assembly’s Veto Session. September first,” said Draco, who also seemed unsteady, like he was trying to shake off whatever had just occurred between them. “Ideally, we’ll have you caught up on everything and settled by then. So…early August? Or, you could come back by the end of July and we could throw you a proper birthday party.” He gave Harry an almost shy smile at the last, and Harry found himself smiling back.
He shrugged, cheeks coloring. “Kind of.”
Harry walked towards Draco, standing directly in front of him. Draco felt overwhelming relief at the sight of his face, of him, alive and well. “It’s good to see you,” Harry said, and pulled him into a tight hug.
wished he did. “No.”
“I don’t get it, mate,” Tony said the next day as they were discussing Ari. “You seemed to get on with him so well. And you can’t deny that you were impressed with some of his ideas.”
“Long time ago,” she said, hitching up her shoulders in another shrug. “I was naïve. I should never have joined up with the Stags. I should have seen what he was doing. It was obvious from the start. He was never subtle. Maybe I did know, a bit. Maybe I just pretended not to.”
“Oops, sorry,” said Dolohov, flicking his wand towards Draco and healing the fracture wordlessly.
Soy un perdedor
“I know!” said Harry.
of money scattered around the edges of the stage, and in-between acts, some poor skinny bloke ran out with a push-broom to collect it all.
to. You’ve been a friend to us. To me. You found us in that slave cellar, and you took us in. You fed us and protected us and if it weren’t for you, I’d have never become a Senweir. I’d never have learned how to wield a broadsword. I’d never have become a hero in any sense of the word. And, incidentally, I didn’t do much in the way of heroic deeds.” He laughed. “I fought my way to the gates with you and then proceeded to drain myself to unconsciousness. Hardly heroic.”
Harry shrugged again. “I’m fine.”
Draco nodded and pulled his cloak off and heard Harry laugh.
Harry’s first phone call had been to Luna, to ask her if she wanted to go with him. He hadn’t spoken to her much since he’d been home, but Luna was the sort of person who didn’t get offended by stuff like that, and with whom it was effortlessly simple to pick up right where you left off. Unfortunately, Luna was in Brazil until February.
The cab brought them to a neighborhood that was lightyears away from the upscale, spotless little corner of London that housed the townhouse. It was full of neon lights and rowdy young people of all different colors and shapes and sizes. A million different smells floated into the open cab windows, unfamiliar cooking spices mixed with industrial-type smells and more human ones. It had a tendency to shift from mouth-watering to positively vile in an instant.
They had the kitchen Wireless on and a Celestina Warbeck song came on and Draco grinned. Harry stood up and went to take the foil off of the lasagna and when he turned back, Draco had his eyes closed and was singing softly:
“The language was a bitch. I knew a little bit of Romanian beforehand, but not nearly enough. And it was hard, yeah, being away from home. But then I met friends there and fell into a routine, and soon enough, I found that I loved it. And I love my work, too, if you can’t tell.”
,” Frankie whispered to Draco.
But Blaise’s magic hadn’t worked on him tonight; Draco was still wide awake. Maybe even more awake than he had been before Blaise had come into his bed. He sighed, pulling his pants back on. He could read. Or journal. He could…try to wank? He’d only just come, but he was a healthy, eighteen-year-old boy – such things were possible.
She stood and brushed off her robes. “I will.” She gazed at him for a moment. “I know the
“Okay,” Potter said quietly.
“Paul can certainly blame you,” said Harry. Paul was the partner, who was not here today.
She let out a soft nicker, a chuff of breath. “Not now!” he cried, putting his hands on Harry. He started gathering Sen, all of it that he could manage to hold, and sent it out in a great tide, and watched as Harry’s flesh drew back together, all the bits of splintered bone and shredded sinew and broken skin mending itself. After, Harry looked whole. Unhurt. But he was not moving, and there was still no breath.
Lawrence was looking back and forth between the two of them, a curious expression on his face. “Ah,” he said, nodding to himself. “I see.”
Potter stared up at the ceiling. “Yeah, except I think she might be right.”
“I’m going to be an Auror. Assuming I do well enough on my NEWTs.”
Blaise smiled. “You don’t. Not anymore.”
“Vernon?” asked Draco calmly. “What’s he doing with them? He’s a Slytherin.”
Malfoy must’ve liked Harry’s enthusiasm, because he was making breathy noises above him, and his hips were moving faster, his cock burrowing itself to the hilt so that Harry could feel the slap of Malfoy’s balls against his skin. And that, too, was incredible, strangely erotic, this idea of Malfoy so deep inside of him, fucking him so well.
“Because I’m asking you,” Weasley said, his blue eyes unwavering.
“But he was never desperate until now,” Pansy said. “So. Do with that what you will.”
Harry and Hermione and Luna visit Aspire
Edwin was looking at him curiously now, a little frown on his face.
She laughed. “Yes, but I don’t look nearly as good in mesh as you do.”
needed to collide with something.
“Since when?” Blaise said. “And I really could use some help. I’m still pants at using half of the symbols and I can’t figure out why.”
, Malfoy?” glares, anyway.
She looked at him with her big blue eyes and sighed. “If I break it off with you, they’ll stick me with someone worse. But, Merlin, I want to get out of this fucking house.” She was still living with her parents, and said it felt like a prison sometimes.
And that thought crested over Harry in a wave of displeasure. Malfoy wasn’t supposed to be concerned about Harry. It was an uncomfortable development, one that made Harry feel hot and embarrassed.
like a crazy person, so there wasn’t much he could do about that.
Draco looked up at him, got somehow even paler, and ran away like a scared rabbit, ducking into the shed.
Bad idea, bad idea, bad idea, bad idea, said a voice in Draco’s head. “Yes,” he said.
Suddenly, Harry was bolting upright, knocking Draco and Alex over.
But what could he say? That he was, without a doubt,
“No! I’m not that fucked up anymore, and I’m not waiting to have this conversation any longer. We’re having it now, or I swear to Merlin I will dislocate your jaw again.”
The next Sunday, Harry went to the Burrow for lunch. Everyone was there, and they played Quidditch in the yard afterward, and Harry went with Molly to the kitchen later to help her with the pudding she was making. Molly fussed over him and told him he needed to cut his hair and apologized a hundred times for Ginny. “It’s okay,” Harry assured her. “It honestly is. It was for the best.” She looked like she disagreed every time, but finally she let it be.
At the last moment, someone sat in the empty chair to Harry’s right, and he looked over and saw Ari. “Hey,” he said. “Long time no see.”
It was cold as a witch’s tit outside, and despite casting a million warming charms over himself, Harry was shivering like mad, and his eyes were watering because of the frigid wind. His tears had made little frozen trails along his face.
She kissed his cheek. “Take care, Harry,” she said.
a bit scary. She seemed fierce and more than a little cautious. She was quieter than the other two, but her ringed eyes seemed to miss nothing.
“Trust her, mate,” Ron said, nodding, shooting a meaningful look at Hermione, which Harry, once again, couldn’t decipher.
(See the end of the chapter for
Teddy was a tiny thing with bright green hair, until later that night when Draco was holding him, and he suddenly became blonde. “Oh, he likes you,” said Andromeda. “He’s taken on your hair.”
Oh, hell. Harry felt tears pricking his eyes. “Well. If anything were to come of it, you’d be the first to know. Okay?”
“I’m saying I want to take this thing with us, whatever it is, more seriously. I don’t want to see anybody else.”
“And I know you think she’s cute.”
“At least I know which guy I like, even though I don’t know how to be with him without making a mess of things. You don’t even know that much.”
Draco let it go. Obviously this was not something Potter wanted to dissect, preferring, as usual, to brood instead.
“Potter, you’re like a puppy, rubbing up against my hand like that,” Malfoy said, laughing.
“I cannot believe you shagged Harry Potter.”
“Okay…” Draco said, waiting for him to expand on this.
Pansy nodded. “That might be better. But enough of that -- why don’t we focus on you for a minute? You’re clearly beside yourself. Why is this so upsetting to you? Did Draco lie to you about it?”
“That’s what you
“Nice,” said Seamus. “You’re buying.”
Lupin summoned glasses of firewhiskey for everyone and held his aloft. Draco was grateful that he hadn’t been excluded from the toast, but also felt a bit like he had no right to raise a glass to his former professor, who hadn’t ever cared for him, and who had once turned him into a bouncing ferret. “Mad-Eye,” Lupin said, and drank deeply.
“We can’t seem to figure out where Draco is,” Astoria said quietly, entering in another text.
“What face?”
“Depends on how you feel. Do you
“I could tell her what she needs to hear,” Draco said, shrugging. “She needs to know that you still want her. So, I’ll tell her that I have feelings for you, but you’re still hung up on her. I’ll say that you won’t give me a chance because you love her so damn much. That’ll do it, if I’m reading this right. And I think I am.”
But they didn’t, they just looked on with curiosity as Frankie hurtled through the gate, and only then did the shouting Queensguard appear on the road that led out of the city. Frankie was laughing now, as they continued down the road, turning around to look at the scene of chaos behind them. “What the fuck was that?” Draco breathed.
Draco smiled, but it was a chilly thing that contained no mirth whatsoever. “No. Not at all.” He cleared his throat, and Harry took a sip of his pint and waited for him to continue. “So, I suppose you want to know why I asked you to come here.”
“Ho! Ho! Ho! To the bottle I go
They slipped through the gates and down the face of the hill, cutting over towards the waterfall path. But then, instead of following it, they turned onto another path that seemed to wind up the next hill. “Where’re we going?” Draco asked.
“Lip-ring,
"Since when?" he asked.
“Yes, you tosser. Of course yes. Who else would I marry? You’re the only person I even like.” That wasn’t true at all. Draco liked and loved a lot of people. But Harry…well, Harry was his favorite.
“I heard,” Harry said. “They’re back to being horses, incidentally. Ever since the battle ended. They’re in the stable.”
Harry flinched. “When? When did this happen last?”
“But –”
“Course,” said Ron, looking at Harry with an expression of pure desperation.
“I hate it,” he said.
Draco was laughing so hard that his belly hurt. Merlin, these idiots. They were ridiculous. He felt a powerful wave of something come over him, even as he wiped tears out the corners of his eyes.
Ron and Hermione were there, too, everyone hugging and saying how incredible that had been, and how proud they were of Draco and Astoria, and Harry still felt like he was hovering outside his body. In a daze, he walked out of the Manor and out the gates, and he thought that Hermione might have been calling after him, but he walked out and apparated home.
it. You’re so talented, Draco.”
“I have to tell Pansy. She’ll be so proud.”
“Your…wait. What?”
He met Draco at the bottom of the stairs and Draco cleared his throat and passed Harry the lilies with a trembling hand. “Those are for you,” he said, his voice unsteady, too.
“You did wonderfully,” said Luna. “You were perfectly adorable and fun to watch.”
Then, on Sunday, Ernie broke and flooed him. Draco happened to be lounging about on the sofa in the black silk pajamas that Ernie liked so much, which was absolutely perfect. “Hey, can I come through?” he asked.
“Lover," she whispers, and closes her eyes.
as we speak,” said Travers, smirking. There was a wicked glint in his eye.
“Well, let me assure you that this is not, in fact, the ballroom,” Draco said, angling his chin up a little. “Now get the fuck out of here.”
“Okay, I think that’s –” Harry began.
Harry wasn’t making pasta, or at least not yet. He
There was a look of resolve in that achingly lovely face, that face that was as familiar to him as his own. And he knew, from more than a decade of experience, that once Potter had made up his mind about something, there would be no changing it.
When Charlie started kissing him, it was easy to let him, easy to give in. It was easy to let Charlie come upstairs, to let Charlie undress him slowly. It was easy, even, to let Charlie fuck him gently, and it was simple, to hold him and kiss him and move beneath him.
When Draco reached Harry’s side, he pulled at him, trying to get Harry to straighten and look at him, but he seemed to hardly be there at all as he moaned in pain, a hand over his scar. “Harry,” he said again.
“They’re aristocratic!”
“Humph. So you say. But you didn’t come to my to-do the other weekend.”
William looked astonished.
“Oh, Potter, you wound me,” said Malfoy, still smirking. “How could you forget our little date?”
. Of course it’ll be okay.”
“And everyone was correct, you berk,” said Pansy, laughing.
“For now,” Draco countered.
The troll started toward them, and Draco panicked and picked up the only things he had on him – his books – and threw them, whacking the troll in the back of the head with one. The troll roared in fury and spun back, then stomped his thick trunk of a leg so hard that it broke the tiles of the floor, sending pieces shooting out in every direction.
“The Bog Beast was an enormous, unformed thing that rose up out of the bog at night, unfurling massive, peaty tentacles, and slithering to the nearby farms to feast. At first it took calves and lambs, and then it was taking full-grown cows and sheep, and then horses, and then children, right from their beds.
sorry. It’s nearly midnight here and I’m just cranky. I shouldn’t have said that. I know how important he was to you, Harry. I’m sorry for minimizing your feelings. I just need for you to move beyond this and make a decision about the Deputy candidacy with a clear head. Because the Harry I know – or at least the Harry I used to know – wouldn’t stand by and let Theodore Nott take over the Ministry.”
“Well…it’s part of the whole thing. We don’t have to if you don’t want to.”
powerful, much to his dismay. His magic was on the stronger side of average, but average nonetheless, although he liked to imagine that he made up for it with knowledge and cleverness. Normally, Draco might say that Potter wielded that sort of mind-blowing level of magic, but here in this world, Potter was defenseless as a lamb.
“Is she hard and, um. I dunno. Sort of cold, like me?”
They passed out after sunrise and had to wake a couple hours later to hastily pack their things and get to the airport. Everyone felt like hell (Dean woke up and vomited all over the floor, and thank Merlin for the ability to disappear things like that) until the man behind the front desk (still, as ever, working tirelessly on his stupid puzzle) offered them some Hangover Potion.
after that night because all the actors quit. The actors quit because the playwright and his lover locked themselves in the changing room after leaving the stage, and cast a billion wards and Muffliatos and privacy charms on the door and didn’t come out for a good hour or so. All the actors’ keys and purses and clothes were locked in the changing room with them so they were stuck there, waiting. Also, they were actors in a community theatre, so they weren’t getting paid anyway.
Oh, god.
Christmas night,
“I’d like to go, too,” Harry said, looking down at Draco. “If that’s okay?”
“It’s a typical marriage,” Draco said. “They seem like they love each other. They were obnoxious about being all over one another when they first were married. Always snogging in public, Daphne sitting on his lap, always touching each other, that sort of thing.”
“Cuthburt,” Farley called.
It was in this way that he came to have seven cats by the time he realized the extent of his cat problem, although, in his defense,  they were ‘his’ to varying degrees.
“How about Blaise?” someone called out.
“I think I wore that to Harry’s debate, didn’t I? Fuck’s sake, I can’t wait until their campaign is over. I’m sick of going to all this shit,” Sarah groused. “Dressing up sucks.”
Harry threw up his hands. “Then talk to her.”
“They usually do makeup about now,” Astoria said, looking at her watch once they were back in the hallway. “We might want to look there.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Lia replied, taking an impressively long swallow of mead from her cup and wiping her mouth with the back of her hand. “Thea and Thera were twins,” she said, her brow furrowing. “They were magic and had a mess of power. Daughters of the Horn, they were called, because of how they tamed a herd of unicorns. They went to different places, had adventures every which way.”
Harry put a hand on Malfoy’s hip and brushed over Malfoy’s ear with his nose. “It really, really is,” he said quietly, and was rewarded with a soft groan from Malfoy.
“I wasn’t!” Draco cried.
,” Lia growled. It was mid-morning, now, and there was a herd of unicorns – eleven in all – wandering around the camp atop the hill. Only, they’d decided to be tricky, and ever since they’d crossed the threshold of the Temporal Door, they’d disguised themselves so that they looked like horses. Lovely horses. Fine horses. But bloody, blasted horses.
Potter couldn’t stop gawking, even as he drank his whiskey, staring at everything over the rim of his glass. “Merlin, you’d think you’ve never been in a gay club before,” Draco said.
Pansy had a cell phone, too, which was convenient.
“Because I fancy you, you dense tit,” Potter said, his face only inches from Draco’s.
“Why in the ever-loving fuck are you so happy?” Pansy asked as she set Draco’s cup in front of him. They were meeting at a muggle coffeeshop near Pansy’s flat to go over details for the Halloween fundraiser, as well as catch up with one another’s lives.
“He’s just over in the next room if you want to try to talk to him.”
Finally, if this all weren’t enough to make it clear that getting romantically involved with Potter was a terrible idea, there was Blaise (who still wasn’t speaking to Draco, but still). Blaise’s silence was hurting Draco’s feelings more than he wanted to admit. And until Draco and Blaise worked through whatever was happening, Draco knew he wasn’t fit to be with anyone else.
Finally, Malfoy seemed content. He sprawled out next to Harry, grinning. “Well, that was fun,” he said.
Nott turned back towards Harry. “
“That just means you’re a whore for ink, Potter,” Malfoy said, laughing.
Draco, feeling shaky, stood and slipped out of the cell, locking the door behind him. He gathered his lantern and made his way back up to the surface, not knowing how to feel. He wasn’t sure if he’d wanted Edwin to acknowledge his transgressions or not. On the one hand, he wanted to believe that everyone was capable of change. On the other, it was almost a relief to think that maybe he and Edwin weren’t the same. Maybe there was a difference, although it was difficult to pinpoint what it was. Was it merely a matter of degree? Or was there something different inside of Draco, some part of him that hadn’t been corrupted, despite everything he’d done?
“We need to get you inside,” she said.
She did.
“Good thing you’ve got yours back, then,” William said, grinning. “That was incredible.”
Harry listened again, and yeah, he sort of could. Suddenly Draco’s hands were at his waist, Draco’s fingers tapping in time to the music against Harry’s skin.
“Would you like to grab lunch with Hermione and me today?” He didn’t even know if Hermione was free, though she probably was. He hoped she was, or he’d feel like quite an idiot.
. It was making him almost delirious with want, over just the opportunity to talk to Draco, to be with him in a pub, to stare at his face, and maybe, just maybe, to let one pint lead to two and two lead to three, and then to lean closer, to speak more intimately. Then to let their thighs brush, their shoulders brush. To reach out and touch Draco’s soft hair. And then to let Draco kiss him, to push him out of the pub, to take him home, to touch him everywhere. To drown in Draco again, let the riptide of feeling rush over him, let it steal his breath and his common sense.
She shrugged. “As though there’s anyone better. You look hot today, by the way. Potter’ll want to snog you silly.”
“I’m not asking you to, Draco.”
She tucked a strand of shining hair behind her ear and swiped a nervous tongue over her pink lips. “Just say it, Harry,” she said.
“Oh, Christ,” breathed Harry, which set Ron off laughing again.
Malfoy leaned back in his chair. “I saw Euri at a club. I was out with Theo and Millicent. Euri was there with Ari and one of Ari’s friends. Euri told me all about your little fight the night before and said I should ask him out.”
Suddenly feeling a thousand times more relaxed, Draco smirked at Blaise. Padma laughed and stood up from the chair. “He’s all yours, Draco,” she said, gesturing. Oh, if only she knew.
“Harry, what do you want me to say?”
Harry had no clue how to do that, but figured he could learn. “Yeah, okay.”
we had that fight. Because of what you said, because you made me feel like you didn’t really care about whatever was between us. You said it was
Harry groaned. “Ugh, not true. It’s just...well, it wasn’t working. It wasn’t either of our faults, probably, but. It had run its course.”
“Yeah, well, I suppose I peaked at seventeen. Been going downhill since then.”
Harry was so nervous as he walked into the coffee shop that he felt dizzy. His hands were damp and clammy, his mouth dry. He felt shaky and unsteady, and wished he’d met Draco for drinks instead, because at least then he’d have the reassuring embrace of alcohol to look forward to.
Harry laughed. Hermione
“Brilliant,” agreed Draco, looking around, unable to keep his face schooled into the bored sneer he’d adopted in the cab.
Instead, he picked up his hoodie and shoved it on over his head and sat at the foot of the bed. “Start talking, then,” he said, putting his hand on Draco’s foot, patting it through the covers. He supposed that was probably okay. It was just a foot, after all.
“I loved being a Gryffindor, don’t get me wrong. It was a great place for me. I just wonder…if we didn’t have the houses, if we were all forced to live alongside each other from day one, maybe we would’ve all been friends a lot earlier.”
Then they were out onto another street, and Frankie pulled at Draco’s hand, tugging him to the left, and then into another house, this one empty, and then out onto another alleyway. She looked left and right, panting.
“Yeah, I know,” Harry said. His cheeks felt hot. What was he supposed to say? That he lusted after Draco constantly and fancied himself in love with him half the time? That they’d kissed, and it had been the best kiss of Harry’s entire life? That Draco’d turned him down immediately afterward and then told him to sleep with Charlie?
Draco stepped forward and brought his mouth to Harry’s again. He tried to imagine that they weren’t here, in this horrible dungeon, that they were together in Harry’s room in the Gryffindor tower, or maybe in Draco’s bed after Harry had snuck in under his cloak. It all seemed to bleed together, then, all those timelines, all those moments. Harry, every single version of him, loving Draco.
“Sure, yes, chemistry. When you two are in the same room, it’s sort of. Well. It’s intense. Like, if sexual tension were gasoline and you lit a match, the whole place would go up in flames immediately. Can you honestly say you’ve never noticed?”
“Oh, alright,” Draco said, holding onto Harry.
James pushed his dark hair away from his freckled face and turned on his best ‘win-over-grownups’ smile. “Hello, Mr. Malfoy. Nice to meet you. Thank you for letting us stay in your home.” He offered his hand.
hug at drop off,” Lily said.
“So what are you saying?” asked Draco.
to do the chastity thing? I mean, blimey, Pans, we’ve not been chaste at all.” They hadn’t, either. Ron had enjoyed telling Harry about their sex life in explicit detail, particularly when Harry was sex-starved. Harry knew way more about Pansy than he’d ever wanted to know, including her love of pegging Ron with a big green dildo strapped between her legs. She was quite a freak.
Potter frowned. “He was a bit of a prat. Don’t like prats.”
“Nope, still just Draco,” Draco said cheerfully.
A patient, long-suffering sigh. “I was saying I actually like Pansy’s idea about inter-house bonding. It’s what we’re supposed to be doing this year, but we really haven’t done it, have we? We’re all still spending all our time with our old housemates to the exclusion of everyone else.”
She reached over and patted his shoulder. “I know your life hasn’t been a walk in the park, either. I can see that.”
He finished, and the creature regarded him, a question in its eyes. “I'll never be able to sleep,” he said to Lia, hating how his voice broke the tranquil silence. It was still dark all around them, several hours from sunrise, probably. “We could head back now, if you want.”
“Harry?”
“No, I don’t…I don’t know. It’s confusing. We’re not together, but…I don’t know, Harry.”
?” she cried, smacking him again. “And you didn’t
“No, you can. I just…”
He hurried around the house and stopped dead in his tracks. Because Al and Lily were playing with Draco Malfoy. A young Draco Malfoy, even younger than the one Harry had met all those years ago on the Hogwarts Express.
“Kerrick will go back to the mountains, wont’ he?” Draco said, which didn’t really address any of it, he knew.
for Ron. He didn’t lust after him, or find himself thinking about him throughout the day. Last night had felt good, and Harry’d enjoyed it, but it hadn’t been earth-shattering. It had been warm and pleasant and a little emotional, simply because he cared about Ron so much, but it hadn’t felt like sex had at first with Ginny. It hadn’t felt like his soul was being knotted together with Ron’s, hadn’t felt like they were falling in love or anything.
And Harry couldn’t do it. He couldn’t stand there and watch Draco seduce Charlie in front of an entire club full of people, couldn’t watch him grind on him and simulate sex and throw his head back wantonly and move through achingly slow body rolls.
“What?” asked Harry, taking it and looking at it like it was an alien lifeform.
He felt Draco stir against him, the hand that was limp and hanging off Harry's chest coming up into his hair and stroking it gently. It felt wonderful.
“Do so! You totally do! Pansy! Does Malfoy not shake his arse a bit when he walks?”
Finally, he spotted him, still dancing with Hermione and Luna.
“Oh, I think I deserve more than that,” Harry said, his voice low, his smile teasing, knowing he was flirting and not really caring. He was wearing Draco’s shirt and Draco was wearing his. It made him stupidly happy.
“I don’t sit around massaging her all day,” Harry said.
“What’s happening?” Harry whispered.
Al and Lily looked on excitedly. “Yes, Daddy, he can apparate. He just – poof! – appeared. Out of nowhere!” Lily exclaimed. “Just like you and mum do!”
“Go ahead and
“Yeah,” Harry said, tucking Draco’s hair behind his ear. “I wanted to before, I just didn’t know…”
“Why have you been acting so weird lately?” Harry asked suddenly, startling a bit, as though he were waking from a trance.
Potter was in a pair of plaid pajama trousers and a thin, white cotton t-shirt. Draco realized he’d never been in Potter’s room. It looked almost like Draco’s, except the trunk at the foot of Potter’s bed was a different color, and he had an oversized pillow with a Gryffindor lion on it instead of a Slytherin throw. There were some books and a pair of jeans on his bed, but Potter pushed them off onto the floor. “There,” he said, gesturing.
Harry winced at his cheerful tone and slipped in through the door. Draco cast a hot air charm and dried him, and then grabbed his shirt, whispered, “I honestly didn’t think I could wait until Saturday,” and tugged him forward and began to kiss him.
!” Draco cried. “Stop!” He looked at his hand and realized he’d dropped his wand into the lake.
“Stop it, it’s none of those things.”
“I honestly never saw anything like that in Euri,” said Harry, thinking over all their moments together. “He was pretty straight-forward.”
Draco groaned. Wonderful. So wonderful that the old Death Eater network was still alive and kicking. Not to mention, the idea that wizarding supremacists were collaborating with one another on an international scale…good god.
Harry’s mind whirled. He hadn’t been coming in late and leaving early. Had he? Maybe he had. Fucking hell. And perhaps Seamus and Ron were fucking with him, filing those complaints, but maybe he had done things to warrant them. “I’m under a lot of stress, Sir,” he said quietly. “But I didn’t write this. I wouldn’t.” He was able to meet Robards’s eyes as he said it, because he truly wouldn’t have written anything like that, normally. Robards wasn’t his favorite person in the world, but he wouldn’t have done it.
“Yes, all right,” he said, realizing that he was fairly well terrified of this man and would probably agree to anything he said.
Draco’s department had been celebrating. That afternoon, Unspeakable Clarke had wrapped up a two-year project that nearly killed him a dozen times, and Hermione and Weasley had gotten engaged the weekend before.
They walked through the frozen night to their hotel – a run-of-the-mill muggle hotel, nothing particularly extravagant – and found their rooms. They were down the hall from each other, but Lisa and Augie and Tony were right here somewhere, too. Harry knew it would be risky to be seen coming out of Draco’s room or vice versa. But he really wanted – needed – to feel Draco pressed against him. And he hated that he needed it. Hated that he needed it because he felt unsure of things again.
Pretty hot, right?
“Yes, yes, okay, the shop sign stays,” Harry said.
Draco frowned. “Don’t say that about yourself.”
“Well, what did
Sam glanced over at her and nodded. “Yeah. We could do that. And what about the Greengrasses’ properties? If Daphne’s involved.”
Draco was shivering beneath him, seemingly unaware of the moans and cries that fell from his lips, lost in his pleasure. “Harry,” he breathed, his back coming up off the bed. “Oh, god, yes. There,
“But, Sir!” Harry cried, outraged.
“Ready?” Charlie asked in his ear.
“Colin.”
“Huh,” he said. It sounded very familiar, like what he and Pansy had been like at Hogwarts, minus the pretending to be dating part. Pansy and Draco had
“I, ah. No, not Pansy. Tried that with Pansy fifth year and it didn’t really work. Because I’m not actually interested in girls, as it turns out.” Draco blinked. Why had he said that? He’d told his friends, but they were his
“Do people find her strange?”
Potter shook his head.
Evangeline laughed. “Only when it comes to my students. And my teachers. And other things…yeah, fine, I’m tough.” She winked at Harry. “Speaking of, I was hoping you could cover Hannah’s classes next week, Draco. She’s out of town. It’s Intermediate Tap on Wednesday at 4:30 and Intro to Ballet on Sunday afternoon.”
thought? “What? No, of course not,” he said, shaking his head. “No.”
He focused, then, on not crying, which occupied him for a while and kept him from thinking about the mad things Draco was saying, and how fucking proud of him Harry was, and how momentous this was and how it changed
Hope still lingers on
“Will you call them?”
They all waved goodbye and then Harry collapsed onto the couch in a heap. “Good god,” he muttered.
Draco turned to the next page. It was a list of questions:
“Can I touch you?”
“Yeah,” said Harry, and he did hurry. He rushed through the crowd of people, looking for a head of white-blond hair.
Harry hurried along the drive, almost running, but he was still quite waterlogged by the time he reached the doors. Draco was there, opening them up, and grinning broadly. “I’m so glad you’re here! Hurry up, you git, you’re soaked -- get
Draco was sworn into office in the lobby of the Ministry of Magic, right in front of the enormous fountain dedicated to the Second Wizarding War. Harry stood nearby and was sworn in soon afterward. They looked at each other through the flashes of the cameras, through the parade of well-wishers, and time seemed to stand still. Draco strode over to Harry and pulled him close, nearly squeezing the breath out of him with his hug. “We did it,” he whispered.
“Oh, stop looking at me like that. Just because things are…
Harry looked at the two of them and felt like an intruder, like he was witnessing something very private.
The stuff they did – the traveling, the writing and the podcasting, the cycling studios and all that – was wonderful, but the thing that mattered was that they were doing them together. And at the end of each day, Harry got to be with Draco, got to hold him and love him and sooth away his hurts and celebrate his victories with him. Draco was his, and that –
Harry made a raspberry sound on the back of his hand.
But no, he’d think about that later. Not now. Now, he just needed to make it back to the barracks.
“Just a little further. Hey, how’d you get your wand to light?”
Thursday, I don't care about you
Draco's mouth felt dry. “You – you want to hang out with us on Friday?”
different once you got past the newfound confidence and swagger and the improved wardrobe and the intimidating hotness. He was still Harry, still the boy who was desperately afraid of revealing himself but lacked the self-control to hold anything back, who was amazed when good things came to him, who grumbled when complimented but flourished when he felt loved. He was still goofy and insightful, blunt and evasive in turns, quick and eager. He still had far too much energy to burn and never stopped moving. He still laughed and angered easily, and he still needed to be held after sex. Or at least he did with Draco. He wondered if Harry’s dozens – hundreds?
and recovering from war trauma. Besides, Ginny always had a crush on him, from the moment she met him. It was different.”
“It might,” said Potter, smiling winningly. “I bet I’d shut right up if you rubbed my feet.”
(Rush, rush) I can feel it, I can feel you all through me
“Yes, but there was no trace of the spell anywhere. I looked through the entire library.”
Draco considered him a moment, and then nodded, briskly, before setting off to his room.
“Um…”
Harry sat there after Malfoy – Draco? – left, feeling like a complete arsehole. He’d done something wrong. He had no idea what he’d done, but he’d done
Tuesday, Wednesday break my heart
“Have you
He was nervous, all of a sudden. If this didn’t work, Potter was going to think he was an absolute joke. He had to do it right; he simply had to. This needed to work.
“She’s lovely.” Draco ran a finger along the bars of the cage. Draco liked owls in general, but this one really was gorgeous, full of fluffy, snow-white feathers. “Come on, we’re this way.”
like this! Ugh, I need to just find someone who adores me no matter what I do. Like what I thought I had with Ernie. Then I won’t ever have to feel like this.” He put his head down on the table atop his hands.
clothes,” Harry said. “That’s, like, the opposite of sexy. I’m literally getting less sexy with each passing moment.”
be nice. If you know what’s good for you,” Potter said, sliding a second finger up Draco’s arse, making him cry out.
Harry sat there, thinking. No, Ron was a notorious flirt. It wasn’t just with him. The hen party, for Godric’s sake, was a perfect example. He was always chatting up girls at bars and things. But…
Draco loved him. He loved him in a way that he never thought he would love anyone, and it was painful and beautiful at the same time. He wanted to wrap Harry up in happiness, in light, in warmth and reassurance. He wanted to rage against all that Harry had lost, against the evil fucker who had taken Harry’s parents, against his own family and the rest who had helped and would keep helping that bastard. He vowed to protect Harry from them, from his own family and from everyone else who wanted to hurt him, who wanted to pick him apart bit by bit until there was nothing left.
“Because you have a full day today and you’ve got to stop blowing off your schedule. Sarah is fully recovered, so there is no reason why you can’t –”
“Hello,” Draco said, after Madam Malkin had pulled a set of robes over Potter’s head. “You’re going to Hogwarts, too?”
“The things we want when we’re ten years old aren’t necessarily the best things for us,” he said, and she tried to smile in return.
After kissing Hermione and Pansy goodbye, Draco and Charlie made their way out into the night. "Where to?" Charlie asked, taking his hand.
“Finite!” yelled Harry, pulling out his wand.
Finally, he broke. He stomped to his room and unlocked his trunk and tried to search through it (quietly, because everyone was asleep in their beds). It was a mess, of course, because Harry was a slob. It was something he’d accepted about himself a long time ago, although he’d made efforts to improve lately because Draco was a
to take a break
“Then this," he said, skimming a thumb over Draco's cheek. "Is officially the best birthday ever.”
And then Draco lost what little remained of his self-control. He spun them so that Harry was underneath him, so that his knees were bracketing Harry’s knees. He kissed Harry harder, and groaned when Harry wrapped a leg around Draco’s calf and rolled his hips so that Draco felt the sweet drag of Harry’s cock against his own.
He turned his hand to clasp hers and felt a warmth blooming in his chest. He did love her, in his way.  “I love you, too.” She nodded and took her hand back, slipping it around her wineglass. “I’m worried about you tomorrow,” he said.
“Good, because this is about all I can handle, I think,” Draco said. “Especially since we’ll be increasing the household by one in, oh, about six-and-a-half-months.”
Draco smiled. “He’s nicer than I was.”
“I should be certain, though, shouldn’t I?” Harry said, grinning. “I mean,
Ari sighed, looking sad. “Well. If it doesn’t work out between you and the boss, gimme a call, okay? I still like you, even though you’ve got more baggage than an airport.”
Draco gaped at him, unable to understand how he could believe this, although clearly he did. “Edwin, you were a threat to his entire organization. You
The narrator in the armchair pales; you can see it even under the stage lights. “Oh, goodness me,” he says. “I didn’t realize you were here, Sir.”
Like punching in a dream breathing life into my nightmare
That was how, fifteen minutes later, Draco found himself climbing the stairs to the Eighth-Year tower with Potter in tow. “None?” Draco was saying. “Thought I told you to come get me if you couldn’t sleep.”
It was him and Draco, of course, in t-shirts and jeans, looking like they’d just woken up, or maybe like they hadn’t been to bed yet. They were in a restaurant of some sort, and Theodore Nott, dark haired and slouching, was across from them, a tight smile on his face. Harry knew Nott was occasionally around back then. Not often, but sometimes. But he didn’t remember ever having breakfast with the guy. And who was taking the photo? A waiter? Had Harry and Draco really met up with
“Good,” he said. “Are you ready to begin?”
“Lord Commander,” Draco said, inclining his head. “Frankie said you wanted to see me.”
Harry’s chest rumbled with a laugh. “Sure, you go tell him that.”
“Wondered what?” asked Draco.
“Anyway” Potter said, “you need to eat more. You’ll be safe, now. Dumbledore will make sure of it. And your parents will be safe. So, you know. Hopefully that’ll mean you have an appetite.”
Draco’s quill sat poised, ready to tabulate the votes.
“But I don’t know how you feel,” Harry went on, chewing his lip again. “If you’re happier here without me. So, you need to tell me, okay? How you feel. If you feel the same…or not.”
They finally reached the barracks and Harry helped Draco onto his straw mattress. Draco blinked up at him and felt Harry’s fingers at his fringe, tucking it back behind his ear. “Goodnight, Draco,” he said, leaning forward and pressing a kiss to his forehead.
Draco frowned. “I’ve thought a lot about that," he said, feeling his throat tighten. "I think he’s trying to keep her safe. He really believes that the Dark Lord is going to win the war. And I think he’s hoping that if he stays loyal, he’ll be able to beg for leniency for my mother. Maybe for me. But certainly for her.”
“Dunno what she’s like these days,” Harry admitted. “In the past, she was definitely looking for love. Never really found it, though. Had a lot of bad luck.”
Seamus shrugged. “I’ve not told anyone besides Dean. But I figured since you were sharing…”
Draco stared at him. “I’m really just trying to get home, honestly. My – my friend Harry and I, we came through a Sacred Door from another world. And we need to get home. I was told you could help me create a door to take us home.”
“Hell if I know,” Harry said, truthfully. “I did think about it, though. You didn’t really talk to all of Felix’s friends, but…they’re really interesting. Kind of quirky, but. I liked them. I liked that they all kind of did the same thing, and could talk about it together.”
“He’s great, yeah,” said Harry.
“What was I to do? I had to find
Draco’s spells hadn’t worked on the shining women, but perhaps…he pointed his wand at Potter. “Stupefy!” he shouted, and to his great relief, Potter stopped. “Levicorpus!” Potter began to lift, his body rising quickly, just as one of the shining women reached out to him. Draco directed him back over to the beach and set him onto the rocks.
Here shall your sweetheart lie,
“One, when is it you think we’re doing this? And two, why Mountains and Manicures?”
Draco scooted away, putting distance between them. “Because you don’t know! You don’t know what I’m like, not really! You think I’m good, but I’m not good Harry, I’m
. “I’m so sorry – for everything. I wish – I wish things were different. I’m so sorry that I can’t – that I –
Sarah looked surprised. “Me? But she’s so, like, scholarly. I’m not at all. And she’s kind of prim, isn’t she?”
“Oh, fine. You know. Markets have been good. Bouncing back over the last two years.”
“Right,” said Malfoy. “Well, James, you’re hungry, yes? Why don’t we get to work on breakfast. What would you like? A fry-up? Crepes? Omelets?”
And besides, she did rather want to see Harry, that silly git. It had been a long time since she’d seen him, but after the war, Harry had been around a lot and Pansy had, despite her best efforts, grown rather fond of him. He could be an utter pillock, but he was a well-meaning one, and, once you got to know him, he was quite fun. Pansy and Draco and Harry and Blaise spent many evenings together during those years at clubs of ill-repute in both muggle and wizarding London. Occasionally, Weasley and Hermione or Daphne or Seamus or Parvati or any number of others would tag along, but Pansy, Draco, Harry, and Blaise were the true club kids of their strange conglomeration of friends.
Augie smiled, and he looked even younger. “Sounds good, Mr. Malfoy. Er, I mean, Draco.”
“Yeah. I’d be his liaison to the different directors and departments. Tony’s Chief of Staff, of course, but he’s going to be doing more of the internal stuff.”
“But you weren’t?”
good. It was such a rush, for someone to get to know you a little, to look you over, and decide you were
“Well, we’ve done it before,” said Dean.
Harry was writhing, a bit, his back lifting up off the loveseat on occasion, and he was being quiet-ish, but he was making little breathy, panting noises, and suddenly Draco’s cock was so hard it hurt.
Al said a clumsy, yet heartfelt prayer and then they all went back inside and made chocolate biscuits. It seemed appropriate.
“Why? It’s nice out here.”
Harry didn’t like when Ron got upset about Hermione’s schedule. “She’s doing important things, Ron,” said Harry.
James’s brown eyes widened. “I
Then everything was a tussle, clothes being yanked off and chucked across the room, buttons popping, Potter’s boxer briefs ripping as Draco tugged at them, mouths kissing and biting and tongues being furiously sucked on. It all sort of blurred together in a drunken whirlwind, and then Potter was above him, slicking up his cock, and bloody hell, of course he had a big, gorgeous cock, the bastard. Life really was unfair sometimes.
He felt a small flash of satisfaction as he saw surprise and downright shock sweep over their faces. “Then who?” Pansy cried.
“Draco and I are done, you know,” Harry said before he could think about it. “Even before this.”
“Yes, of course. Have a good day, Harry.”
“You’re my favorite,” Draco whispered in his ear.
It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true
“I’m going to miss you all so much,” Hermione said, her eyes weirdly shiny.
“Your cock is fucking brilliant, Potter. It is honestly the most beautiful cock of all time and I hate you so much because of it.”
He felt himself waver, so much Sen having been spent. He hadn’t been careful to keep a little inside; he’d used all of it. He collapsed beside Harry, feeling the world waver in and out, and settled into Harry’s still-warm body, and closed his eyes.
Even more depressingly, there were many instances of dragons being raised in a wizarding household and then abandoned when they became too big or too violent. A baby dragon was a delightful, sweet-natured thing (except for the stray bursts of fire), and it was easy to see how a wizard or witch might take one in, thinking he or she could handle it. Then they grew, and their talons came in, and suddenly they needed to be fed a cow every few days to be sated, and then they’d accidentally eaten the family dog. And then the witch or wizard would bring the dragon to the nearest forest and leave it there. It was a sad business, but it cheered Harry to know he might be able to do something about it.
“You’ll do no such thing,” he said, trying to lift her up and push her over the edge.
“I’m afraid I don’t know,” she said, tilting her lovely head. “I haven’t left it in years. Years and years.”
“I don’t hate Potter,” Draco said. “We give each other a hard time. It’s just the nature of our friendship.”
“Weasel, you ginger git!” Draco yelled when he was two or three feet away. “Stop standing there like you left your brain in the bloody lake! Hit the fucking locket!”
“Yeah, of course,” Harry said. “Of course.” He looked over at Charlie, who looked fond and bemused in addition to looking worried. “You probably think I’m a huge creep. After Ginny, and…” he cleared his throat. “February was a little…”
Harry was chewing on his bottom lip. “If it wasn’t a – a
“And what else?” Harry said. Draco realized Harry’s cock was perking back up now, and he was moving again, just a bit.
“Did you listen to the Falcons game yesterday?” you ask him in the kitchen of the house Pansy shares with Blaise and Daphne.  Pansy is your friend now, and she’s his best friend, but he still hates you. You’ve been trying to think of something to say to him for the last half hour, and now here you are, alone with him in the kitchen, and this is the best you’ve managed to come up with.
“No, I would be, certainly,” he admitted. “It’s different when you lived it, I think.”
Harry looked at him, giving him a small smile that didn’t reach his eyes. “Yeah,” he said. “Sure.”
“Oh my god,” whispered Draco, wincing. “So obvious.”
“Yeah, it’s true. Well, sort of. There was something that happened as I was coming back.”
“I want to. I really want to,” Harry said, looking up at him. Charlie was leaning on his forearms, body resting between Harry’s legs, and his shoulders were broad in a mind-numbing way, his muscles rippling as he moved, and Harry could just see the flame from a Hebridean Black shimmering towards the top of his chest. “I want you, Charlie.”
Potter picked up a frog. “This first?” he asked Draco.
Pansy calmed after a moment and began speaking again. “Greyback and Dolohov were talking while you were asleep. They thought I was sleeping, too, so they didn’t keep their voices down. They were saying we might be let out after the raid on Vasseur. If it’s successful.”
kind-hearted.”
“I know,” Hermione said, looking at the floor. “But we couldn’t leave him.”
God, thought Harry. How many lives was this sick notion of blood purity going to ruin before all was said and done? It hurt even its own proponents. Look at Draco, look at this. Lives upended because of some silly notion of superiority, because parents thought their child needed to marry a certain sort in order to reinforce their own bigotry.
William made a face. “I don’t like the thought of that.”
. “Took you long enough,” she said, glancing up at Draco’s face. “What? What happened?”
She put her hand on his forearm and squeezed gently. “You’re such a soft heart. Never would’ve guessed it when I met you.”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Harry said.
, you are a
That was how Draco found himself at the Ministry on Friday, taking an International Portkey to Quebec City, Canada. From there, he would have to take some sort of weird underground wizard train (called the Flash Train) to New York City.
“Harry!” Draco called after him. “Shit.”

“Fine, but you go first.”

They were circling now, possibly to catch their breath, or possibly just being cautious. Draco had no intention of losing this final match.

Daphne seemed to draw herself up straighter. “You mean the husband who keeps fucking
The group wandered over to a nearby wine bar, crowding into a big, circular booth and drinking more. Harry was squished between Draco and Suraj, and let himself lean a little against Draco, pretending all the while that he didn’t notice their closeness, that he had no other choice than to sit like that. It felt better than it should have. Draco was warm and solid and smelled divine, his breath tickling Harry’s shoulder any time he laughed.
“You’re just jealous that all the boys want
Harry grinned. “She’s, um, an interesting person.”
Astoria snatched at Scorpius’s hand. “Ow, Mummy, too tight!” Scorpius cried, and then promptly dissolved into tears. Tony glanced back at them in alarm and Astoria knelt and hugged Scorpius and tried not to scream.
Draco found he couldn’t be quite so happy about it. He didn’t attend the hanging, which took place just outside the palace wall. Instead, he holed up in his rooms and drafted a letter to Edwin’s father, informing him of the results of the trial. William had given Edwin's father notice of it in advance, and even invited him to testify on Edwin’s behalf. He’d declined, saying Edwin was no longer his son. But still, he should know. It seemed like someone ought to care that Edwin was dead, no matter how vile he had been.
Friday morning, Harry’s alarm went off, and he sat up groggily, looking over at Euri, who was sleeping on his stomach, curly hair all mussed. He looked especially young while he slept, quite boyish and innocent. And he’d had Harry’s cock in his mouth last night. Harry felt a weird pang of guilt. God, Hermione was right. He really needed to get over this age thing.
“I can just give you a quick peck,” Harry murmured. “It’s not a big deal.”
“Ugh,” Harry said, putting his head on the table. “How do you know these things?”
He dropped Harry’s hand and curled up onto his side so that he was facing Harry’s stomach, his head shifting against Harry’s very hard cock. He yawned. “Goodnight, Potter,” he said, and fell asleep. Within a minute, he was snoring softly.
He felt an answering laugh rising up in his chest, but he refused to let it out. Instead, he ran. He ran out of the coffee shop, ignoring the stares of the handful of customers that followed him. He ran and kept running until he reached a quiet alley, where he leaned against the wall and panted.
“What about you?” Harry asked, nervous about the answer. “Anybody in your life?”
“Yeah, because he’s a
“Yes, I am!” Harry turned around and called back to her. He then had the distinct pleasure of seeing Draco blush.
“No,” Draco said stubbornly. “Nothing to do with that.” It was true that they had been considered questionable long before Margot took up with the muggle, although that hadn’t helped.
“We’re getting drinks!” Pansy yelled, leaning close to him and pecking him on the cheek.
She giggled. “
way to keep Harry safe. Maybe he’d accidentally stumbled onto the ideal situation.
Two days later, they emerged from the forest rather suddenly. The mammoth trees began to thin, then thin more. Then they were replaced by different trees, ones that were, in comparison, rather unimpressive, common-looking things. The grasses began to grow thicker and longer, and then, suddenly, they were looking down a hill at a town, and behind it, an endless sea.
“You need to forget this,” she said. “We need everyone focused on the task at hand.”
,” Draco whined. “It feels so fucking good.”
Draco ordered a gin and tonic, so Harry got one, too. While they were waiting for the drinks, Harry looked at Draco, who was peering up at the dancers along the second floor. His Adam’s apple was more apparent when he tilted his head back, like it had been that day in the snow. Harry, hardly able to imagine why he shouldn’t, ran his fingertips over it, lightly, just once, before pulling his hand away and feeling himself flush.
“Oh, fucking hell.”
Euri went over the spell and showed Harry how to do it. “That’s fantastic. So I won’t really have to marinate anything anymore. I just do this.”
in that house. Fuck, I shudder to think of it,” said Ron.
“Harry?”
“Oh, girls?” asked Ron, perking up.
“Probably so, yes,” said Malfoy. He walked over to the wall and turned the music up, and a few of the people standing around started bopping around a little, dancing in place.
“I’m going to stay with Draco. I need to talk to him about something,” Harry said. “I’ll transfigure myself a bed of some sort.”
“Well, so do I!” Harry cried. “I wish it had never happened! I don’t want everything to be messed up! I looked all over for him the next day. I wanted to talk about it, to work through it. And he was just gone.”
Harry sighed. “Yeah, I don’t think I’ll go out with him again.”
After work on Friday, Harry and Euri hurried back to Harry’s house. Ron and Hermione were coming over at seven for dinner, so they set about cooking together. Euri was the perfect sous-chef, nimble and quick-fingered and eager to assist.
“I wasn’t going to ask. I like Slytherins just fine.”
“Oh,” said Draco, not wanting to push, but also desperately wanting to know the story there.
Draco reaches Rodderem and meets Kerrick.
Hermione frowned. “What do you mean?”
Harry grinned back at him. “We were so wild back then.”
get out.”
“Yeah. It’s, like, forever away,” he said, sighing.
The second thing he knew about courtship was that there was a lot of talking involved. Draco and Harry made social calls together (with their chaperones, of course) to all their friends and family (there was hardly any family; really it was just Andromeda and Teddy, although Harry counted the Weasleys as family, a bit), went on long walks with Hermione and Pansy trailing behind them, visited each other for tea and occasionally for dinner, and talked all the while.
“So…I’ll see you at work?”
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
“I’m not finished!” Lia screetched, and people quieted, sort of. “You had better be here at sunrise tomorrow morning, like always. And I don’t
And then Sunday, he’d been so weird, hardly meeting Harry’s eyes, refusing to be around him until supper.
The next day, the trees began to thin, and they found themselves coming to a meadow. In the center of it, there was a little thatched cottage, smoke curling up from a chimney. The meadow was covered in wildflowers, except near the cottage, where they could see neat rows of vegetables as well as several fruit trees.
I'm careful but not sure how it goes
“How am I –? You’re embarrassing the shite out of me!” Harry laughed.
“Somewhere posh and muggle, I’m sure. So maybe, like, a nice button-up or something? A blazer? Fuck if I know. I’m horrible at this shit.”
Pansy seemed amused by her new friend. She collected Granger, threading her arm through Granger’s once more, and the two of them began making rounds, ostensibly to help people who were still struggling to figure out their name tag. Draco thought they would probably either end up blurting out the answer, or just cause further confusion, but oh well.  “Does she drink, usually?” he asked.
– what I have with Astoria is healthier than a lot of love matches I’ve seen. We plan to be kind to each other, and so I think it’s a good thing. I truly do.”
with that guy?”
Harry felt his eyes widen. “You want to go to a muggle restaurant?” he asked, feeling like he must’ve heard wrong.
fancy Harry, then why had he done it? Had he just wanted to get off? And if so, hadn’t he been worried about how Draco would feel about the whole thing? Blaise had been his friend, his good friend, and he
“You might need it. Consider it a coping mechanism, should you want one. I’ve already had several.”
Blaise sat up and pulled him in for a hug that seemed both familiar and strange, after a weekend of hugging Harry. “I’m sorry, Draco.”
“But what,” he asked, peering at her.
“Regular sort of friend. She wants nothing more to do with me,” Harry said.
“I’m not obsessing,” Harry protested. “I’m merely relaying some of my observations to you. I can’t help but find it odd that ever since we had that discussion about what happened leading up to our breakup – or whatever! I
“Don’t remind me,” Draco said, grimacing. He felt positively naked without it.
Charlie and Harry kiss. Stuff escalates. There's sex.  /end scene
Harry sighed, hating himself for being such a sap. Why could he not be sextually attracted to someone without starting to develop all these
“I know,” Blaise said. “But the kids.”
“I like floating,” Draco said.
“Oh Salazar, what?” Draco asked, furrowing his brow.
“Yeah, agree,” said Harry, feeling another wave of amazement at how much damn sense Pansy Parkinson was making.
“Good morning. Thank you,” he said, setting a linen napkin on his lap and biting down on a piece of toast that she’d already slathered in butter and blackberry jam for him.
Days passed, as days do. On New Year’s Eve, Hermione declined her glass of champagne and revealed she was pregnant. In February, Ginny and Draco took third place in the competition for doing a sublime cha-cha, and decided to enter another one. In April, word came from Romania that Charlie and Divya were engaged, and also in April, Draco and Ginny won first place in their second competition with a foxtrot. In late July, Hermione had the baby, named Rose, and then in August, Pansy and Luna surprised everyone by moving in together. Blaise married Daphne Greengrass in early September, and the wedding was on the island of Capri. Harry and Draco decided to make a trip of it, and spent a few days in Tuscany before going home. They went on a wine tour, and Harry thought all the wines tasted basically the same. Draco supposed nobody was perfect.
He yanked on her red ponytail gently. “Ok. Think about it. And then do it.”
He found himself flushing again. Damn Pansy. “Er, thanks,” he said, slipping out into the hall.
“Harry’s looking at you,” said Luna, in that same calm, dreamy voice. “You should look over at him, and then I think he’ll ask you dance.”
He went to bed that night in low spirits. He tried to think of positive things. He had a divine new muggle suit to wear to Gringott’s tomorrow; that was a good thing. He was having lunch with Luna, which was, bizarrely, also a good thing. She was a bit mad, but he liked her company. And, of course, he would see Potter at work tomorrow. Seeing Potter would remind him that he had a plan in place. It would also remind him that Harry Potter thought Draco was good enough to fuck. That surely meant there was
Being alone was utter shit.
“Love is not sufficient. It never has been. Stories that claim otherwise are lies. There's always SOMETHING after happily ever after.”
They strolled slowly down the street, looking in windows, people passing everywhere. It was dark now, but the street was crowded and the restaurants were beginning to fill up. It wasn’t very cold, Harry realized. He hardly needed his coat. Draco wasn’t wearing one, and he seemed fine. It felt like spring.
“Yes, very,” said Draco, as he began to move up and down at a leisurely pace. “Imagine if I only loved you, and didn’t even
Potter elbowed him. “You ought to know, Malfoy. You broke half of them.”
“Um, well.” Euri frowned, his soft mouth curving downward. “The whole thing with Draco Malfoy.”
To find Potter, he remembered. But Potter hadn’t been there.
His jeans did feel a bit itchy against his skin. “Sure,” he said. He sat up and realized he’d never showered or anything all day. “Actually, you know what, I should go home. I need to shower. I’m probably disgusting.”
“You always look so hot, though,” Pansy said, nuzzling at her neck for a moment before spritzing herself with perfume.
Both girls squealed.
“Oh,” said Draco, surprised. “Where?”
“Music, too, huh?”
Pansy came later in the day, in time for supper. She sat close to Ron on the Weasley’s comfortable, worn sofa, looking out nervously over the sea of ginger hair and freckles. At first, George refused to speak to her. Harry talked to Pansy while Ron talked to George, and by the time they sat down to eat, George was willing to ask Pansy to please pass the potatoes. Harry supposed it was a start.
They’d found the snitch once, and raced towards it from opposite ends of the pitch. They'd collided rather brutally, and then the snitch had somehow gotten away. Now Harry was back to scanning the ground, high up in the sky, looking for a flash of gold. Malfoy was nearby, circling.
Harry was, frequently. He grimaced.
“Yes, I’m sure he does,” Berold said, his eyes on Draco’s, his expression pointed. He leaned closer. “I’m also sure he’s worried about what this means.”
I've been around, I've settled up
“I hate that we weren’t friends before this year.”
He ignored that because he was not about to engage in this little game with her. “What I don’t understand is
“Obviously, I was jealous.”
touching. Harry’s hands were running up and down his back, and then down over the curve of his arse, and then they were slipping beneath Draco’s pants, seeking more bare skin.
“Has anything else come through since I left?” Kerrick asked one of them.
“Harry,” Draco said, straightening. He grabbed Harry’s wrist. “Don’t.”
Harry was too busy pulling down his pajama trousers to reply.
“Draco only gets that worked up about someone if he fancies them,” said Daphne.
“We’ll come down to greet him in the foyer,” said Draco’s father.
And I know you'll never fold
“You know what your problem is, Weasel?” he pontificated, gesturing broadly.
And he said Draco was being callous, but
He looked back down at Draco, who had his eyes closed now, one hand on Charlie’s shaft and the other palming his own hard cock. He was kneeling between Charlie’s legs, his lovely arse up in the air. Harry crawled over to him and tugged at him for a moment, and his mouth made a pop as he pulled it off Charlie’s cock to kiss Harry wetly, and then Harry brought his own mouth down to suck Charlie for a moment and Charlie cried out, and then Harry kissed Draco again, messy, the taste of Charlie’s precome on both their tongues.
The lift spat him out on Level 9. He was currently working in the Love Chamber, on that silly chest. The bottom drawer was the one Draco was most concerned about. There was something sinister there, something that, when Draco’d run his initial diagnostic on the thing, made his dark mark sting and his stomach heave. He was outside the entry to the chamber, about to go in, when something stopped him.
“Please, Draco –”
Weasley snort-laughed. “Thanks, but no. Think I’ll leave that to Harry.”
“I’m still going in,” said Potter, his chin jutting out. “Chang and Peabody are in there. They might be close by. I need to go in and look for them, at least.”
And that was weird. He shouldn’t want to know about Malfoy, for fuck’s sake. Especially given that Malfoy was probably going to blackmail him in the near future.
“Stop,” Weasley said, putting his hands over his ears. “I do not want to think about my parents ever having sex. Not ever. It was artificial insemination only.”
Things went back to normal after that – sort of. Harry was running around morning, noon and night, attending things Draco couldn’t, raising money, doing rounds with the press. He and Draco saw each other at the weekly campaign meetings, and occasionally at events, but they hadn’t spoken since that night at Harry’s. Draco was angry, that much was obvious, and Harry thought he could take that anger and fuck himself with it. Pansy started coming out with Harry and Sarah on a regular basis, but she didn’t bring up Draco. It was like they were all pretending the whole thing had never happened.
you?”
? Harry imagined some wizened, desperate old woman cackling away as she clutched his stolen cat.
How did I not know this about you?”
Harry looked up sharply, and a line appeared between his brows. “What? No, of course not.”
The fourth morning, they camped close to the Emerald Sea, hidden inside an old, hollowed-out farmhouse. As soon as dusk settled, they would cover the remaining mile or so and then launch the boat. Draco assumed he would never sleep, because he was so anxious. But he’d slept horribly so far, and he was exhausted. Somehow, mercifully, he passed out the moment he spread out on his cloak under the sunshine.
“Yes,” says the blonde man. “And that seemed impossible. So, even though they still loved each other, they broke up, thinking that it would be better to start fresh after the two years were over, rather than run their relationship into the ground until they were both miserable.”
Will poked his head in, and Harry wondered if he was just waiting for Draco outside the door. He looked at Harry’s feet. “What size?”
“Tomorrow, maybe,” Draco said. He was already sporting a rather painful erection – he’d seen Potter in a towel again that morning.
Draco suddenly didn’t want to leave, not even for a minute. Blaise was out there, somewhere, and he didn’t want to run into him. “Usually wear pants, but just not…not in here,” Draco said.
“I don’t like it,” said Draco.
The minutes tick by with unbearable slowness. You drown yourself in whiskey and champagne. You go outside into the freezing cold air to cool off your heated blood and consider just picking a direction and running until you collapse.
She took his hand, limp with sleep (for once), and thought about how much she loved him. Because she did, and she probably always would.
“Do you think we’re ever going to get out of here?” asked Potter. Draco was taking first watch, so Potter was in his sleeping bag, hands behind his head. His brows were drawn together and he was frowning. Draco was beginning to think this was his default expression.
“I just
touch you, you bint,” Malfoy huffed before taking a sip of wine. “I give you back rubs all the damn time.”
“Sorry, my little delicate flower,” Draco said, putting his hands over her ears.
Draco did roll his eyes then. “It’s fine,” he said. “Now, I’m trying to decide whether I want you to fuck Harry or suck his cock.”
Five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes
She shook her head vehemently. “No. You didn’t create them. They already existed.”
“What does that entail, exactly?” Harry asked, slightly frightened.
!” Draco gave him one more shove for good measure.
“Nobody told me.”
I get knocked down, but I get up again
wanted, only it was all buried under so many other things he could hardly make it out.
Harry smiled at that, rather shyly, and Draco pulled him closer. They began to kiss with an almost bruising tenderness, slow and deep and gentle. Draco tugged at Harry’s y-fronts, desperately wanting them gone.
Harry sat up, dizzy and confused, his head still smarting. “What?”
William nodded. “There are eight, four pairs. One pair for morning, one for mid-day, one for evening, and one for darkest night.”
That was odd. Daphne had never loved Blaise’s mother, and the feeling was mutual. And as far as Astoria knew, the elder Mrs. Zabini wasn’t the babysitting type. “Do you know where Daphne went?”
“Oh, nonsense,” said Harry. “Everyone can nap. It’s a universal thing. Naps are glorious.”
Potter pushed his glasses up and shoved himself off the wall with his shoulder. If he didn’t have such nice shoulders, all of it would be easier. If he didn’t have such nice shoulders and arms. And his abs, if they were worse, that would help. And really, the whole face, that needed to be uglier. It would help, too, if his eyes weren’t so bright, if the color of them didn’t haunt Draco behind his closed lids every night when he tried to fall asleep wrapped up with Stephen or whomever else he happened to be dating.
Draco cast, and he felt it hit his skin, and some of the pain went away. “Well?” he asked.
“Fuck off,” Draco said, more roughly than he’d intended. The very notion was making him feel very strange and floaty. Heat was spreading over his cheeks, tingling down his chest. He ought to be able to laugh this off, go along with the joke instead of making a thing of it.
“That we have to date now? Or get married? No, Ron. It doesn’t mean that.”
“Strange like how?” Potter asked, his eyebrows going up in the middle, his face anxious, worried.
“Which means they don’t hate each other that much. But they still don’t live together. But they
don’t want to marry you. But if I do fall in love, rest assured it won’t be with you.”
“I don’t
Potter was sitting up and looking around, confused. “Malfoy?” he called.
Harry didn’t actually tell anyone he was Malfoy’s boyfriend. He did, however, say that he was an old school friend, which was also a lie. “Oh, we just
“She wasn’t that involved, though, I suppose. With the war. Certainly didn’t smuggle a parade of Death Eaters into Hogwarts.”
“Good. I’ll go over everything with her, then, before he’s discharged.”
“Macallan single-malt, neat. Nothing too fancy.”
Harry blinked down at the boy. “Erm.”
“Oh, er. Sure, yeah. We can.” Harry paused. “Are you okay?” He looked Draco over, worried by something in his voice. He knew people sometimes were slipped things in clubs and he felt his heart speed up at the thought that somebody might have done that to Draco. “You don’t feel woozy or anything, do you?”
Draco looked down at Harry’s absurdly hard, leaking cock. “I think you definitely can,” he said.
Draco felt himself gasp and took himself in hand as he envisioned Harry’s eyes dark with desire, his lips pink and swollen.
when Potter waltzed into the room, clad only in a towel. His eyes flickered over to Draco. “Morning,” he said.
Draco’s eyes caught his, and Harry curled a hand around the back of Draco’s neck. He was hot, his skin damp. He took Draco’s wrist and brought his hand to his waist, and there they were again, too close and not close enough, Draco’s eyes filling the world, everything narrowing to that moment, to the aching thing between them.
“On occasion, we must do things we don’t want to do,” Snape said, his mouth quirking. “Sometimes that means risking our lives or endangering those we love. And sometimes it means cohabitating with Weasleys.”
“I take it we’re going to be ordering out for dinner?” Ron said jovially, practically screaming to be heard above the sound of the alarm. He looked around. “Where’s Euri?”
“Shut up, wanker,” said Harry, laughing. He pulled them over to where Ron and Hermione were sitting and squeezed into the seats they’d saved.
“Be careful, mate.”
“I want to stay with my mother,” Draco said.
Pansy considered him, her hazel eyes sharp as tacks, before starting in on a second coat of polish. “I don’t know, to tell you the truth. He hasn’t talked to me about it in quite a while. It’s a shit situation, though, so I hope not. Draco deserves better.” She chewed on a corner of her red-painted lip. “If you’re concerned, you ought to ask him.”
, Harry thought. “Yeah,” he said.
“I thought you
They’d either die here, or they’d eventually go back home, and Draco knew that whatever their relationship was here – friendship, possibly a bit of mutual attraction – it would disappear the moment they crossed back into their own world. This place was a lie. It wasn’t real, not at all.
“Come here,” he said, gesturing.
He stared at the doors after they left.
They stepped out on the other side and Pansy stood there, grinning for a moment, and Draco was about to ask her whether she was having a stroke when a dozen or so people popped out of the kitchen and yelled “Surprise!”
Nether one of them moved for a time. They were covered in sweat and come, and after a while, Draco realized that Harry was sobbing into his neck. He tightened his grip on him and waited.
And the cottage…
“Well, I assumed you’d be going!” Hermione exclaimed.  “Since you said you’d help plan!”
“What’re you doing here already?” he asked. “My watch isn’t up yet, is it?”
He felt himself grin. “Haven’t worn glasses in quite a while. Not since I moved to Chicago.”
, been interested in any bloke before. Even now, thinking of kissing anybody else, like you, or Zabini, or whoever, it feels, like, kind of gross? But not Seamus. That doesn’t feel gross.”
“Mm, yes, lofty goal indeed,” Draco said, pouring it into two shining crystal glasses and adding a big square of ice to each. “Here you are, sir.” He handed Harry a glass. “To many more days of dancing not terribly.”
many sparks,” Harry said, laughing and putting his hand on the small of Draco’s back. He leaned close to Draco’s ear. “What do you think they’re doing in there? And do we have time to sneak away and do the same thing?”
“Fuck off,” Ron said. He was smiling broadly, and wasn’t looking at Harry’s body like he had taken to doing the last few months. He was just normal. He was just Ron.
It hadn’t been easy to convince the members of the Wizengamot to spare Malfoy. Harry had to pull a few strings, issue a few threats, and spend some of the (considerable) political capitol he possessed in the aftermath of the war. His methods had been a bit underhanded and not strictly legal, but he’d done it.  And he didn’t regret it. In fact, privately, he thought it was one of the only things he’d ever done that he was unreservedly proud of.
He approached the nearest counter where a witch in a Department of Magical Transportation uniform was seated underneath a sign that read, “HELP DESK”.
Draco had never felt less like sleeping. This was absurd. It was definitely not going to work.
“And I’m sorry you’re

“I would love to say yes, because you look like cake. But I don’t want to leave, so. I
It hit Draco fully, that Laurel was gone. It had seemed surreal in the throne room, with the relief he’d felt over Harry waking up, and with all of them afraid that they were going to be ambushed by more Queensguard any moment. But here, in the quiet tunnel, he felt it. His eyes were hot. He tried to wipe at them but the sticky stuff was in the way.
Draco mulled this over. He, of course, knew all about the pull of purse-strings when it came to one’s parents. But then where did that leave him? “That’s not going to change any time soon. You won’t ever be free to be with me, not really.”
“H-he is?” Pansy managed. “Where is he? Why hasn’t he contacted me?”
“We ought to try getting this thing off of Draco,” Frankie said, touching it again.
“Oh my God,” said Sarah.
“She was given to Prince Henry. He was supposed to rule after his father, yes. Only, she never married him. He put her aside to marry an Etherean girl and she married his cousin, Godwin.” William looked tired talking about it. “And then Henry and his Etherean bride were killed, and then Godwin took ill, and soon it was just Otrea sitting on the throne and my brothers and I – the only other source of royal blood – were hiding in Rodderem.”
She was calming down a bit, her sobs easing into the occasional shuddering gasp. “Okay,” she said. “Okay. I love you too, and I will forever, even if we never ever get back together. I’ll always love you, Harry. I’ll always care about you forever…”
“Why were you in the bathroom?” he asked. “I looked everywhere for you, you know. Couldn’t find you.”
There was the last line in the note, though, that sparked hope in his chest, pure and hot.
really fucking cold. His teeth were chattering. “Can we still sleep together? Or are you going to be all weird, now?”
The side of Draco’s face was pressed against the rug, his eyes closed tightly, mouth open, hair mussed. Harry kissed his cheek, the side of his nose, his ear. “I wish I could be inside you forever,” he whispered, making Draco groan and grind his hips against the rug.
Harry crawled up over his leanly muscled body, letting his skin drag along Malfoy’s, painfully aware of Malfoy’s cock bobbing and hot against him, and kissed him hard when he reached his mouth, wanting to bruise his lips, his throat, his pale, perfect skin.
me, you arsehole!” Draco ground out.
“Silly?” she said.
Harry tried not to laugh. “You should probably forgive him. But, yeah. When you get your feelings hurt, it’s hard to let it go sometimes.”
“Ari’s not as much like that,” said Pansy.
, she called it, which was stupid, because it was obviously not an animal) to point at things, and an hour and a half later, Draco had lots of good muggle ideas about how to sleep better. He wished he’d brought parchment to write it all down, but he thought he'd remember most of it.
Finally, he looked back up at Harry’s face. “But I’m assuming you’d prefer to be clean when we meet up with your friends.”
of Potions. If you don’t follow the recipe in Potions, it doesn’t turn out.”
“It’s okay,” Charlie said, waving it off. “So what happened? Why were you walking around in the rain?” He scooted over to the tub and took the little cup there and poured water over Harry’s head, then grabbed a bottle of shampoo and put a dallop into his hand and began to massage it into Harry’s hair. Harry sighed and relaxed into the feeling of Charlie’s hands.
. There would be a fuckload of dirty towels.

dancing nearby. “Why is everyone disappearing all of a sudden?” asked Ginny.
“Oh my god,” Potter said, still laughing. “Will you chill out, please? Merlin, Malfoy, you think I make stupid assumptions about
Draco chuckled and then settled onto his back to gaze up into the blue sky. He wanted to think of Harry for a moment, without all the fear and worry intruding, but it was almost impossible – he was so afraid. He forced himself to remember one evening – maybe his favorite, of all those stolen evenings they’d shared – on Harry’s hill.
“Oh my god,” Harry whispered. He sat. “Calm down,
“A week might not do it,” Harry said.
Charlie couldn’t keep his eyes off of him.
Draco whipped his head back to face him. “What? Why on earth would you say that?”
Laurel grinned. “Not all of us.”
Harry sucked in a breath. “Yeah, okay,” he said, but the mood was dampened. “So, what’s up with you, anyway? What’s going on?”
Draco reached out and touched Harry’s cheek. There was stubble there. “You’re okay,” he said, and his voice broke and he began crying in earnest.
“Oh, absolutely,” said Malfoy. “I’m going to hang onto that memory for years to come. I’ll tell my grandchildren about it someday, about that time that Harry Potter tried to impress me using wandless sex magic.” He nipped at Harry’s neck, and Harry thought he could probably get hard again if this continued.
His come was all over Harry’s cock and if he hadn’t just had an orgasm, just the feel of it and the thought of it would’ve made him come all over again. And it did make Harry come a moment later. Draco decided that watching Harry come was something he wanted to do forever. His eyes, which had been shut tight, opened up for a moment, a brilliant green flash, and his lips parted in a wordless cry before his eyes shut again and his head fell back as his hips gave a final set of jerky thrusts and his cock spilled over their bellies.
“I think I know how I might do that,” said Draco, sliding Harry’s pants down.
He tried not to wince as he thought of all the times he had called her a Mudblood, teased her for her hair, or her teeth, or for the way she always had her hand up in class. Of everyone, he might have been the cruelest to Hermione, and it shamed him to his core. “Take your time,” he said. “All the time you need. There’s no rush.”
“What the fuck?” he cried. “You promised! You promised you wouldn’t put yourself in danger for no reason!”
“I’m not going to take your word for it, no offense. I prefer to form my own opinion. And I’m not saying that I've figured you out now, after this one day. You could still be a great big arsehole for all I know. Probably you are,” he said, chuckling. “But I’m fairly certain what I thought before was wrong. And…I’d like to find out. Who you are, I mean.”
Harry thought about it. Nobody’d really ever asked him that question. “Not really,” he said. “I kind of don’t care. I mean, I know men and women are different, obviously, but I find them equally attractive in different ways. Sex with men and women is different too, but both kinds can be incredible. It just depends on the person. If I’m attracted to someone, then it doesn’t matter
Except Blaise, he supposed. Blaise really had seen a lot by this age.
For the rest of the day, though, Harry noticed him looking curiously at Lucas, and when Lucas, who was in charge of supper that night, set down a plate in front of Charlie, their hands brushed, and Lucas flushed crimson and he was almost certain Charlie noticed.
“Sure,” said Harry.
When Draco came to, he was sitting on a hard chair in a small room with bare concrete on the floor and dirty brick walls, a single fluorescent light buzzing overhead and flickering. He quickly realized that his legs were tied to a chair, and his arms were bound together behind it. His shoulders ached because of how his arms were positioned, but his head was so much worse. It was throbbing, the pressure at the back of his skull almost unbearable, and every time the light flickered darker and then brighter, Draco cried out because it hurt so much.
“Yes, Potter. It’s a club. I’d like to dance.”
“What about your opponent?” asked Sarah. “Theo Nott.”
Because things were getting messier and messier. That was why. Despite Draco’s determination to not go around snogging Potter anymore (he didn't count tonight, no, he didn't, because it was a
She nodded. “Next time maybe we should go to yours and you can make everyone lunch.”
“I want to suck your cock. Can I do that?”

this would happen. I knew it would turn everything upside down.” Harry took another sip of tea and let it warm his insides, which just now felt cold in Draco’s air conditioning. “I can’t lose
“Christ, we’re never going to sleep,” he said, leaning over to kiss Draco gently, letting his fingers brush over the curve of Draco’s jaw.
“Too busy humping me in the face to talk much,” said Harry. He started laughing uproariously and soon they were all losing it, laughing so hard they couldn’t breathe.
I was!” Draco cried, stomping away, trying to put distance between them. He was definitely losing the battle against blushing. His cheeks felt like they were burning. “You are the
Draco nodded. “A bit quiet, compared to some areas. Lots of shopping and coffee shops, though. Plenty of book stores.”
Draco nodded. Suddenly, he found he was exhausted. Still a bit cold, but so tired he was ready to pass out. “Yes, that’s fine,” he said. “My skin hurts, by the way. Where it touched me. Can you take a look?”
“Didn’t realize you let your friend pound you, too,” said a voice from behind him.
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
“You hellbeast,” Draco said, and muttered a spell. Harry’s socks disappeared and Draco smirked. “I’ve been practicing,” he said.
Another karkadan was in its place, and another.
“And just how would you know
Malfoy’s eyes narrowed. “You did.”
“I – I dunno,” Harry said.
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
She smiled. “All right, then. Harry. I hear you’ve taken good care of my Draco this year. I admit I was surprised to hear of your newfound friendship, but glad. Goodness knows, we’ve had some trying months.”
They made camp one night inside the trunk of a dead tree. It was large enough to accommodate them both as well as a cheerful fire. They spent their days talking mostly about the things they saw, and, increasingly, about what they would do if it turned out there were no other people in this world at all, because it certainly seemed like there might not be. But that night, Potter was in a nosy mood, and was pestering Draco about Astoria again.
“Dunno. Jelly-legs jinx? Stinging hex? Levicorpus? Cold-blooded murder?”
Potter shook his head, looking terrified.
"Right?"
“I’m not talking to you about this anymore, Blaise. You’re not being rational,” Draco said, collecting his shower things.
Harry was actually really fucking hungry, having accidentally skipped lunch, but he didn’t want to be mean about it. He flicked his wand at the food and turned off the burners. “How about the counter?” he asked, turning around and grinning at Ari.
Ron turned a little pink. “No, we do. We definitely have plans.”
“How the fuck should I know?”
“Yes,” Draco said. “Have a good night, then.”
He had no idea what he was doing in general.
Potter’s chest was rising and falling fast; he was out of breath, too. His skin was hot; Draco could feel it through his t-shirt.
And now Draco had driven a…well, if not an outright lie, than an
In the terrifying face of a future tongue
“See?” said Draco again. “It’s fine.”
Scorpius was at their feet in a miniature tuxedo, wowing everyone who said hello to him with his manners and his shy smile. Draco couldn’t have been prouder of him. Out of this entire mess with Astoria, Scorpius was the thing he couldn’t regret. It was almost worth it, all of this bullshit, because his son existed.
Draco, having a questionable sense of propriety at the best of times, did. Potter looked much the same as ever, and almost exactly the same as he had in the other timeline, the one where Draco had slept with him in the Gryffindor tower every night. His shoulders were broad, his arms wrapped in wiry muscle. He was on the thin side, with knobby knees. There was a small patch of dark hair on his chest, and a little trail running from his bellybutton down to his pants. He was, as ever, the most beautiful thing in the world. “Well?” he said.

All in all, the first inter-house unity party was a raging success.
Pansy giggled at the mispronunciation. “Well, I suppose I’m not surprised. You
“True,” he said, leaning against her kitchen counter. “Remember that fight we had over my sunhat in Positano the summer after the war?”
Blaise sighed. “What I’m offering you is
“Niran,” the man said.
“Um, yes,” he said, not sure what she was getting at. Sometimes, he looked at Hermione and could practically
Draco started laughing; he couldn’t help it. “Just had to bring that up, did you?”
The man smiled. “Yeah, he is, I think. Free. The thing that’s holding him, he wants it to be there. He wants to be trapped. The thing, by the way, is meant to represent Achilles.”
Potter stood and rubbed underneath his glasses with his fist. “Ugh,” he said. He folded his arms across his chest and huffed. “Okay, yeah. Yeah. I’ll bring some things.”
Thankfully, it was pandemonium around them because the cast had just come back out for the curtain call. After a moment, Draco pulled away and appeared to collect himself, and then everybody was practically running out of the theatre like it was on fire.
“I know,” Harry said, scowling. “It’s all I can do to keep from punching him in the face. I can’t believe Draco puts up with all his shit.”
“The Regency, I think. You remember that place?” Harry said. He’d spent a while trying to remember, and it hit him suddenly the other night as he was trying to drift off to sleep. “Kind of a dive, but good breakfast food?”
“It’s always been easy to get around all that,” said Draco. “Political ties?” He flipped through the contents of the file without looking too closely, except to memorize the face of the man whose life he was going to utterly destroy if he could help it at all.
“Oh, welcome back, then,” said Harry. Charlie’s presence had a bit of a calming effect on him, as usual. Charlie was always so happy and relaxed that it was hard not to feel the same way around him.
He was sweating by the time that cage came down, and he ran over to Harry, spelling open the door to the cage, threading his arms around Harry’s waist and pulling him out to look at him, while Berold ran to William.
“And yes, you deserve to be with someone who is proud of you.”
“I think I just might,” she said.
Harry nodded, knowing he did need to get a move on. “So, um.” He cleared his throat. “What – what now?”
“Well, comes with the territory, doesn’t it? We
“I can’t. Literally,” he said simply.
Harry kicked at him under the table and Draco kicked him back and then leaned his leg against Harry’s. They stared at each other for a moment, grinning like idiots. Harry found it difficult to look away, but finally he did, and Draco moved his leg. “So,” Draco said. “You want to know some top-secret information?”
Euri nodded. “My family spent summers just outside of Vezelay, in Burgundy. My parents like wine. It’s just sort of an inherited interest, I guess?”
Potter smiled again, and Draco marveled that he’d made that happen twice, now. Potter had a disturbingly nice smile, sort of crooked and sweet. “You’re bragging about being more fit than
And everything was still so fresh. He hated that it still felt so raw and new, hated that the pain of this loss reverberated through every part of his body, just as it had the first time, when Harry’d left for America. He’d never thought anything could hurt like that again, had thought that it hit him that way because he’d been so young and impressionable. He was wrong: it hurt just as much this time around, and maybe even more. He yearned for the days to pass so he would stop feeling so gutted. He needed time to do its fucking job and heal this stupid hole in his heart.
“Bet you won’t be complaining when I’m licking your –”
“I am. And I’m sorry I took up with Dean so fast, too. I didn’t mean to, it just…I thought that if I had someone else, it would be easier, you know. To not be with you anymore.”
“What?” asked Harry.
“Hey,” said Charlie, nudging his shoulder with his own. “There you are. I’ve been looking for you.”
Someone asked how I pick the songs at the start of each chapter. For this fic, I've had a pretty good idea of where I want the chapters to go before I begin, so I find a song that expresses the feel and sentiment of that chapter, and then listen to it on repeat while I write. So for some insight into my mood and process, give these songs a listen while you're reading if you're so inclined.
“Yes,” Draco said.

“It was supposed to be revenge. I never really wanted to get back together. I was too angry with you at first to consider forgiving you. And now…now I just don’t think it’s the right thing. For either of us.”
“Because Michael was here?” Draco asked softly.
Harry’s heart felt like it was cracking open, like everything he’d kept hidden inside it over the past few months, over the past year, was coming out in a rush. He pressed his face into Malfoy’s hand and felt himself choking on sobs, hardly able to breathe or think or be aware of anything but Malfoy, his sturdy presence, his soft hand, his fierce words.
“I think you might need to make peace with her before she’s willing to help us,” Kerrick said. “If it comes to that.”

They went out once more that week, to the Leaky again, and although there wasn’t an Ernie or Katie sighting, they did see Hannah and her girlfriends. Draco imagined that would get back to Ernie quickly. They went with Blaise and Pansy to dinner at a tapas place off Diagon on Saturday, and saw Finch-Fletchly there with his girlfriend. He spent the evening glaring daggers at Draco, which felt like a small victory. No reason to glare at your friend’s ex if your friend was completely over it.
is going to buy them gifts for their third wedding.
There was a set of stairs before him. Had he gone down stairs in his quest to find the loo? Yes, he thought he probably had. So now he would go up. He went up, and nothing looked familiar. He leaned his head against the wall, cursing the size of the Manor. He imagined that he was truly lost, lost forever, that he was going to die here in this quiet, deserted hallway, and then laughed at the notion that this house was so fucking big that nobody would even notice his body for, like, years. That’d be funny, kind of.
“Never thought I’d see the day,” Malfoy murmured.
“So,” Draco echoed. “Well, this is unexpected. And bizarre. But alright, I like Hermione. Can’t quite picture her clubbing, though. And I distinctly do
“Ugh, Harry, don’t be like that.”
It would all be fine, he told himself. Nothing had changed, not really. His life was exactly the same as it had ever been. Potter was vaguely disgusted by him despite the obvious attraction between them, and that was nothing new. Absolutely nothing was different than it had been yesterday or the day before or even ten years before that.
Oh, those were so good. He could practically taste them on his tongue, dry and sweet and crisp all at once, with an almost spicy smell to them. They were beautiful, too – golden-skinned, with a soft pink flush across the face. He closed his eyes and imagined how it would be to bite into one. “So good,” he murmured.
Visions of Gideon, visions of Gideon
“We could put a curse on him if you’d like. I know a wonderful one that’s perfect for ex-lovers.” Suddenly, she frowned. “Although, you shouldn’t cast it if you think you’d ever want to get back together with him.”
“You’re leaving that in the hall?” Harry couldn’t help but ask. Not that he minded; he was just curious.
“Of course,” Will said, all business now that he wasn’t drooling all over Draco. He let Harry in and looked over the things in Draco’s hands. “These are for him?” he asked. Draco nodded. Will sighed. “I’ll see if I can find anything else.”
Harry got out and toweled himself off and put on pajamas. He walked back out and Draco was waiting there with a toothbrush in a plastic package. “Thought you could use this,” he said, almost shyly.
“That’s fucked, Malfoy.”
Maybe someday he’d stop being such a dummy and work up the nerve to say it.
Big Ham continued. “Back then, unicorns were still wild. They shied away from men, hiding in the deepest part of the forest, allowing only brief glimpses of themselves to the gentle-hearted.
The car was a big SUV, black, with a driver. Another man joined them, a man who turned out to be Michael, the one who was like Malfoy but cheaper, according to Melanie who ran the private rooms. He did look a bit like Malfoy, although it looked as though his hair was dyed to achieve the white-blond color. And he was even younger; he barely looked like he was out of his teen years. He was a little shorter and bulkier, too. Harry wanted to go back to the club and point out that if he’d been hoping for Malfoy and had gotten Michael, he would’ve been sorely disappointed. Perhaps Michael shouldn’t be touted as a Malfoy-alternative.
“You honestly don’t care that it’s the worst idea of all time?”
“What?” he said, knocking his shoulder against hers. “You’re not cold at all. And hard only in the sense that you refuse to rest until you accomplish what you set out to accomplish. Which isn’t a bad thing, in my opinion.”
“Ah, right,” said Millie, rolling her eyes.  She gave them a wave and closed the door behind her.
For the first time, it answered:
She smiled wickedly up at Malfoy. “Exactly.”
amusing.”
. Touch me, Harry. Fucking
They were quiet for a moment, and then Potter’s hand was on his arm, warm and solid. “What the fuck would I do if you died? I’d be here all by myself.”
here – if the whole system of magic and the source of magic were fundamentally different – then perhaps his training was interfering with his ability to utilize the magic available here, rather than helping. He supposed the same could be true of Potter; he’d have to discuss that with him soon.
Shit.
They were running as fast as they could now, and Draco was silently cursing his lack of physical exercise since the war. He’d hardly done anything besides walk to and from work (he lived in a flat not too far from the Ministry) and huddle up at his desk. Probably wasn’t good for his cardiovascular health.
Her mother dropped a can of corn onto her foot and started hollering. “I think I broke it! I think I broke my toe!”
Scorpius shook his head.
Potter moved closer, so close that Draco might’ve closed the gap between them with one more small step. They looked at one another for a moment, and Draco could feel something shimmering in the air between them, a sort of heat, a magnetic attraction. His body, which had felt weary and slow only a moment before seemed to wake up in a rush, his pulse fluttering with anticipation. He found himself leaning forward without meaning to, his eyes flickering down to Potter’s mouth for a moment, only to find, when they moved back up to his eyes – a soft green, now, like the leaves that were so slow to bud this year – that he was doing the same.
All this, just so she could see the house he’d built for her in some godforsaken corner of Maine, where she’d be bored and cold and miserable. Linda was a sun-bunny, much happier with a pina colada in her hand and a jaunty straw hat perched on her head than she would be in a cabin in the goddamned woods.
Harry was an idiot.
“You must be hungry!” said Hermione rather frantically. “You two should go to dinner, shouldn’t you?”
“You wouldn’t dare,” Harry said, still laughing.
Ron smiled. “I can tell, you git. You act like I don’t know you inside and out.”
Draco prided himself on his ability to solve puzzles. To make connections and to think through problems. And he had the strangest feeling that the dream had been given to him on purpose. Yes, that could be in his head, but he went with it. Because maybe it wasn’t just in his head.
“Oh, erm.”
Scorpius nodded. “Oh yes! It’s probably fifteen miles away, at most.”
shit,” Draco pointed out. A logical objection, he thought.
“I think that might be the firewhiskey you’re feeling, Hermione,” Malfoy drawled. Hermione smacked at him good-naturedly.
That was a very horrible sort of hope to cling to.
“Not sure. He wasn’t in the hospital when we arrived, so they’ve had to fetch him, I imagine.”
“Besides,” said Draco, “you and I have quite a lot of work to do.” Ginny had been promoted to head coach of the Harpies and was going to be traveling often, so Lily was going to be living full-time with Harry and Draco for the next two years before she, too, boarded the train to Hogwarts. Draco was going to tutor her, and she was also going to help him in the shop. He’d taken to calling her his assistant, which she loved.
“You thought I was mad.”
So, this was wonderful. Harry was definitely going to be sleeping with Ari, Draco just knew it. And Draco was going to have to watch their romance unfold right in front of his eyes. Fucking fabulous.
“Yes. If you want to.”
“I’m not going in with you. I’m going back to the village and staying with the guys.”
, his eyes tracking Malfoy across the Quidditch pitch, in the Great Hall, along the corridors of the castle.
“I’m laughing at you, Potter. Hardy har har. I find you amusing.”
Malfoy groaned and arched up against Harry’s hand, and then shoved him hard, throwing him off. He was stronger than Harry’d expected, and Harry flew off the couch and whacked his head against the coffee table with a loud crack. “Ouch!” he cried, touching fingertips to the sore spot. “Goddamnit, Malfoy!”
Malfoy’s arm was slung over Harry’s shoulders. He slid out from under it and sat up slowly, carefully. Malfoy was lying on his side, his knees pulled up tightly, like he was making himself as small as possible. His face was gentled with sleep, his lips parted softly. They were bright pink, like perhaps they were chapped. He looked so fucking young; innocent.
One major difference, was, obviously, that Ernie was gone. For good, this time. He didn’t stop by, and Draco didn’t seek him out. It was really and truly over, and Draco found that he was okay with that. Even without Potter to distract him, he could see that Ernie hadn’t been the right one for him. He still wasn’t sure that Potter was correct in thinking that you needed to be stupidly in love with someone to marry them, but he thought you probably needed more in the way of passionate feelings than what he’d had for Ernie.
It comes and goes in waves
– I think about you all the time.” He squeezed his eyes closed and tried to stave off an orgasm again, made his mind perfectly blank for a moment and stilled. When he was able to move again, he kissed Draco hard. “I want you. I only want you. I want you. I’ve dreamt of it. I’ve thought about fucking you so many times and I – oh
“I don’t know. They’ve all gotten so hot,” said Harry forlornly.
to bloody pub night!
“I know. But it’s what I want. All spring and summer I was doing some serious thinking, about this thing with us, and about you.”
“We’ll be ruined, Harry. If there’s a divorce scandal during this, we’ll never make it past the primary, and I don’t care if it’s not my fault. I could paint her in as negative a light as possible, and it would still sink us.” He was speaking in a tired monotone, like someone who had resigned himself to his fate.
The solicitor looked rather alarmed at Draco’s harsh proclamation, but he only nodded, gave Draco’s shoulder one final pat, and slipped out the door at the rear of the courtroom.
Draco nodded.
“Mm. I don’t know. Maybe we’re both lucky,” Draco said, reaching up into Potter’s hair and tugging. “Something in your hair,” he said, even though there hadn’t been. It was just an excuse to touch it, something Draco had always wanted to do.
shagging him, and all the time he spent fantasizing about Draco and wanking and staring at his bracelet in anticipation, waiting for Draco to start wanking, he found himself constantly on edge. He was wanking more than he ever had in his entire life, and that was counting his teenage years. Knowing that Draco would know made it particularly delicious. He would’ve been embarrassed, except Draco was wanking all the time, too.
Draco didn’t want to parse through how that made him feel. “Ugh, you ought to be coming with me, you cow,” Draco said, not for the first time.
“Good,” said Harry, moving closer. “Because I like you, too.”
“Not if you’re on the throne. He respects you. He came here because of his discussion with you. He would help you, I think.”
But he wanted to know why Blaise had done it, wanted to know the truth. If he’d actually fancied Harry, then Draco suspected he would’ve noticed, since he'd watched Harry like a hawk, back then, and tended to despise anyone who flirted with him or so much as looked at him. And if Blaise
He woke up hungover and moped about the castle while everyone else went to Hogsmeade. He cried some more, like the little bitch that he was, and then rode his broom around in the cold for a while.
Suzanne Collins,
“Since what?”
Draco left, and only then realized he had forgotten to crow about Ernie’s Sunday visit, which had been half the reason he’d wanted to talk to Potter in the first place.
“Oh,” she said, eyebrows going up. “Um, yes, please. That would be lovely. Thank you. I’ll have the chana masala.” She pulled up a neat little purse and went to unzip it.
Ron blushed furiously. “Hm?”
Fight fear for the selfish pain, it was worth it every time
She nodded, and then they were alone in the room. Draco walked past Harry and shut the door gently. “Hello,” he said.
Despite being horrendously turned on, Draco laughed. “You’re an idiot,” he said, feeling fond.
wanted that.
Pansy made a face. “Ugh.
“Er, no. We never did.”
Draco wanted to ride towards Septerra right this moment, sword in hand. “What is our plan?” asked Berold, sitting heavily in one of the chairs, his shoulders slumped.
He nodded, wrapping his arms around himself. It made her think of how he was in sixth and seventh year, so thin and vulnerable, always folding in on himself, arms cradling his own body, or curled up into a ball on the Common Room sofa, like he was trying to disappear. “Did you sleep with him?” she asked.
“No, I understand,” Draco said, trying not to let his irritation over Harry’s less-than-enthusiastic reaction get the best of him. “I get it; that thing’s been driving you mad. Listen, Pansy wants to take me out to celebrate tonight at the Leaky. You can join us. We can talk more about it then, okay?”
By nine, Harry’s house was packed to the gills, and it was a completely bizarre combination of Hogwarts alumni, with literally nothing in common save their alma mater and the fact that they were all on a mission to drink themselves into oblivion. Harry wondered what the fuck he’d gotten himself into, and decided to hell with it, and downed another glass of firewhiskey.
“You are welcome to come along and try to talk me into this mad plan of yours. Or you’re welcome to leave in an hour. Your choice. But at this point, my answer is no.”
Harry wondered again whether he’d done something wrong. But he’d wondered that last time, and he hadn’t. He considered trying to talk to Malfoy about it again, but he was shite at talking.
“Yes,” she said, resolutely. “And if it doesn’t work, well, I’ll take comfort in the fact that somewhere out there, there is a different Hermione who is perfectly happy and very much alive and about to marry Ron Sodding Weasley.”
“Still amazing,” Harry said. “Admit it. You thought it was cool, too.”
Harry couldn’t get it out of his head.
“But you’ve been in bed for days, and where’s your sling?” Blaise asked.
Draco'd just returned home to find Pansy waiting for him with wine (yay) and advice (boo). He was too tired for lectures and advice. He was always tired by Friday after a long week busting his arse at his job at Gringotts, where he managed the investments of several high-profile family offices. After the war, finding a job hadn't been easy, but the goblins weren't as opposed to hiring former Death Eaters as the rest of the wizarding world, particularly when those former Death Eaters had spent their first few post-war years earning a degree in finance from a muggle university.
Draco heard tapping on his bedroom window late that night while he was waiting for sleep to find him. He opened it and found an unfamiliar Barred Owl waiting patiently for him. He untied the envelope from the owl’s leg and thanked it. But the owl lingered, obviously waiting for him to do something. He walked to the small desk across the room and picked up a letter opener, carefully separating the flap, and scanned the message.
He’d taken Draco’s hand again after the hug, and, as they walked through the vast lobby, he was just holding it. Just holding it, in front of everyone, and wasn’t that a revelation? That he could, and he was, and Draco was letting him?
“That was
It was the bobcat. Or,
“Yes,” Euri said emphatically.
Now, though, it was a big cat, sleek and elegant and muscled. A bobcat, shimmery blue, except for the green-gold of its eyes.
“We’re not mortal enemies,” Draco said, rolling his eyes. “Or, at least, not in my mind. Nott might say otherwise.”
Draco seemed certain that Zacharias Smith was the culprit, and as far as Harry could tell, that was because Zach had touched Harry’s cock and it pissed Draco off. The truth was, Zach had eased off his creepy behavior in the year before Harry left England, and he’d also started dating some bloke who worked with him at Gringotts. Harry knew he’d needed to admit to everyone that Zach was a possibility, but he didn’t truly think Zach was capable of all of this.
knows that you fancy each other. Sweet Merlin,
Weasley buried his head in his hands and Harry laughed.
When he finally finished and made his way to the sitting room, he found Astoria sprawled out on the couch, Blaise fast asleep, leaning against it. Her hand was close to his hair, and she looked peaceful. Draco spread a blanket over her and then threw one over Blaise’s legs. Then he went upstairs to bed.
“But you enjoy taking the piss out of him so much. I wouldn’t want to deprive you, Malfoy.”
As they talked, several things became clear. First of all, they weren’t going to easily find anyone to help them create a Sacred Door to return them to the real world. According to William, there was only one man who had that ability. His name was Kerrick, and he was one of the Etherean leaders who lived (of course) in the mountains near the Hidden City, whatever-the-hell that was.
Also, there were mojitos. Mojitos were so delicious, and it was hard to know that you were getting hammered when you were drinking them until it was too late.
“Okay,” said Pansy, looking around. “Harry. Truth or dare.”
“You’re beautiful,” Harry whispered. “Perfect. God, I love this. I don’t –” He buried his head in the back of his neck again, willing his throat to stop feeling so full.
She’d stared at him, her mouth open.
“I’d like to come again. You got me all worked up and…you know, we’re just out of sync today. That’s never happened before, but I suppose you couldn’t help it, what with me biting my lip and all. But if you could just –”
And I see it
“I hadn’t really thought about it, but…sure. I could.”
Draco nodded. “I can, and it all sounds so incredible. I mean, what little witch or wizard doesn't want to work with dragons when they grow up? And here you are actually doing it. Sorry, by the way, that I can’t tell you too much in return. You know how Mysteries is.”
“You don’t like sterile water? What in the world are you talking about?” asked Draco. “You’d rather have bacteria swimming in it?”
Hermione was shaking her head, still chuckling. “Well, this has been the most surreal conversation of my life, Draco, and I say that as someone who has had hundreds of conversations about defeating the forces of evil, waging a new wizarding war, and destroying a nose-less, undead dark wizard.”
“Yeah, we really should. Although, I have to tell you, it was easier to be like that when I didn’t see much of you. Lately, it seems like we’re always around each other.” Draco didn’t point out that it was Harry who had come to their table at the pub when Charlie was there, and Harry who had shown up unannounced at his house. “Sometimes…sometimes I don’t know quite how to be with you, Draco. I don’t know what to say, or how to act.”
“He is,” Frankie agreed.
Draco knew, as Harry finished answering the last question, that the next step in their campaign – presenting their ideas to the faculty and trying to recruit them – was going to be a lot more challenging. And then the last part – reaching out to alumni – would be more difficult still. But he also felt like they were ready for it. They’d managed to unite nearly the whole school behind SASS. It wasn’t a foregone conclusion – to be sure, they might still fail -- but Draco thought they stood a real chance at making actual change.
To heal my heart and drown my woe”
, and just
She nodded tightly, then fixed a nasty expression on her face and gave him the finger before walking away.
They left at dusk, Dormond hurrying down the quiet road ahead of them to scout. The night was cold, and Draco wrapped his black cloak around himself tightly as he rode. Thankfully, Circe was warm, almost hot, and he clung to her, feeling grateful.
Harry looked through the plexiglass window to the room where Malfoy was gathered with all the kiddies. He was passing out little top hats and tiaras. He’d taken off the baggy sweatpants and trainers and was wearing ballet shoes and black leggings that showed a
, Potter inside him, and he had no idea how any of it was possible, but it was
“I’m doing this because I care about him, and he deserves to be happy,” Draco said, the answer coming to him with surprising ease. “He’s happy with you. So I figured I’d tell you, because I think you still feel the same about him.”
If he had, though, they were being extremely quiet.
Later, Harry had the pleasure of watching Malfoy cook breakfast in trackies and a t-shirt. He was like Harry, surprisingly, no recipes, just sort of eyeballing everything, even the crepes, which were delicious.
ever since the war ended, holding the lift for him if they found themselves in the lobby at the same time or making small talk with him at Ministry events.
The sun was already up as they sat in bed, listening, quite against their will, to Hermione and Ron in the throes of passion (audible despite multiple Muffliatos). Harry turned to Draco. “You were going to sit there arguing with me about putting my clothes on until you froze to death. I know you’re stubborn, but that seemed a bit extreme.”
“But you still watch porn with threesomes and everything.”
“Poor Jack,” echoed Ron. “Indiana Jones or Forrest Gump next?”
“I’ve learned that waiting is the most difficult bit, and I want to get used to the feeling, knowing that you’re with me, even when you’re not by my side.”
Tony started nodding, and Draco had gone pale. “That makes sense, I guess,” Tony said. “Kind of like he deserves to be happy?”
Harry turned, and sure enough, there was a bar set up in the middle of the bathroom, with two very hot bartenders, one boy and one girl. The girl had on a bikini top and billowy pants, and the boy had on no shirt. “Madness,” breathed Harry. Utter madness. On one side of the bathroom were urinals, and on the side closer to Harry were stalls. Harry couldn’t help but notice that some of the stalls contained two sets of feet.
Like Draco had been, the first time. Merlin, he’d been such an unforgivable bully. No wonder Potter had hated him.
Nothing to do but pay attention. Be part of the conversation. Stop being such a twat.
Just as he was turning away, he heard, “Draco?” in a soft, hopeful voice.
Harry felt his stomach dip at the words, aching in anticipation, and then Malfoy was lifting up and positioning himself above Harry. Harry could hardly breathe as he felt Malfoy take him in hand and line him up against his hole. Malfoy looked at Harry as he very deliberately lowered himself onto Harry’s cock, and when Harry’s eyes closed at the sensation ripping through him, Malfoy grabbed his chin. “Look at me,” he said, his voice low and soft. ”I don’t want you to forget, even for a moment, who it is making you feel this way.”
“What if he says he doesn’t mind?”
And that was not a good thing, because while Blaise was clearly at least a tiny bit gay, he still wanted everyone to think he wasn’t. In fact, Blaise had begun officially dating Padma Patil in October. Surprisingly, this did not stop Blaise from coming into Draco’s bed on the nights he wasn’t with Padma, which made Draco feel both offended and relieved.
Pansy resumed her jumping. “Oh, yay! I’ll be good, I promise! I’ll be so nice you won’t even think it’s me! I’m going to wear that blue dress, you know, the one with the tennis skirt?”
“You really like it, huh?”
“I wasn’t going to tell you I had feelings for Draco, not when you and I had
“Don’t apologize. It’s brill,” mumbled Ron. “Can I…I’m moving up here.” He got back onto the couch and put a pillow onto Harry’s lap and laid down on his stomach, his head turned towards the screen. “Proceed, my good sir.”
“Harry, calm down,” Draco said, squeezing him tightly. "We’ll order out. It’ll be fine.”
“Long story,” said Draco, grinning.
“She’s not home yet,” said Sarah.
Harry pretended to scowl at him. “People like milky tea, Draco. It’s not just me.”
Potter was eying up a bloke on the dance floor nearby who had soft pink hair. “Pink-haired one’s rather pretty,” Draco said as he leaned against the bar next to Potter.
. He had befriended Potter to get back at Ernie. And while it seemed to Katie like this was costing him a lot, it was, in actuality, costing him nothing.
“Could I…honestly, I’d love your number.”
“Please, Ron!” begged Hermione.
“You two are at it early,” Blaise said, sauntering into the room in a towel.
“Because it is specific to your world. But Sen is different. It is the energy of creation, the thing that created all the worlds and sustains them. It can be accessed in every world, through every Door. Do you understand?”
that Pansy minds them. I like that she gives me shit. I like that she fights to have more of me. Is that weird?”
“So, you’re going to go be an artist next year, is that what I’m sensing?” asked Draco after taking a thoughtful sip.
“Well, invite them along!” Malfoy said, as though this were obvious.
He turned to Hannah. “Do you know what’s happening?” he asked her.
Troy gave Draco a thumb’s up and disappeared into the crowd.
“Yes. Why?”
“Bra’s fine,” said Padma.
Draco snorted. “Griping about what?”
“No,” Draco said, peering over Harry’s shoulder. “Ours have the sun carved into them, and the chaperones’ bracelets have the moon.” He plucked one of the sun bracelets up. “May I?”
“Is Malfoy going?”
Pansy shrieked. “Oh my god, yes! Yes, Granger!” She was giggling all over herself, too, and after a moment she linked her arm through Granger’s. “Come with me to the bar. I think we
Pansy reached over and patted his hand. “How was it? What happened? Tell me
Harry laughed into the side of Draco’s neck. “I was sort of thinking I could fuck you, but, sure, why not, either way is fine, I s’pose. None of that kinky shit yet, though. Maybe during round two.”
No one could ever know me
This made him feel even worse. “Yes. And I love you, too. Now stop scaring me.”
And then Potter came in, telling Draco to relax, and running his fingers through Draco’s hair, and rubbing his back, and the exhaustion crashed down on him and he slept.
“Okay,” Harry said, and watched Euri deflate when he realized Harry hadn’t said it back. “So what did you want to talk about?”
“I’m not going to hook up with you every time Dean breaks up with you.”
Harry was very much looking forward to Draco’s studio’s spring performance. The one in the fall had been fun, and he knew Draco felt a lot more confident this time around. “I can’t wait. You’re going to kill it.”
Harry nodded, looking a bit bereft. Draco wanted to shake him, because it was his own damn fault that he was going to be alone on Christmas. Instead, he found himself hugging the other boy, and realized it was the first time he’d ever done that. It was nothing special – brief and ordinary – but it was nice all the same.
“Welcome to the wonderful world of jealousy, he thought. For the price of admission, you get a splitting headache, a nearly irresistible urge to commit murder, and an inferiority complex. Yippee.”
Draco and Alex texted back and forth on Thursday and Friday during the day, getting everything organized. Draco surprised himself further by saying he was okay with Alex kissing Harry after all. Weirdly, he trusted Alex. Alex fully understood what this was, and he trusted Alex to act appropriately. He also decided not to dictate who would touch whom or when, because maybe that bloke John had been a little bit right when he’d said it would take all the fun out of things. Draco felt a tiny bit apprehensive as he handed over some of his tightly-grasped control, but he also felt very brave.
“Is there a chance it might?” Laurel asked.
Harry could come, just from this. Just from grinding against Draco with pants on. His body felt tightly coiled and overheated, the ache of his prick almost unberable. “Fuck, Draco,
Hermione didn’t answer. She’d gone silent.
“Why not? You hate me, I hate you. It’s what we do.”
Potter was laughing again. “You going to rub my feet, Malfoy?”
Even if he’d stopped being hers.
things for you, and then you made me feel like an arsehole for feeling them, like I was taking advantage of you. You let me kiss you in my kitchen, you kissed me back like it
, for fuck’s sake.
Feeling somewhat heartened, he stepped out of the office and yelled for Harry to find him something to wear on the goddamned boat.
Echoing of every place that we've called our home
“I’m going back to England. In a month. I’m running for office with him.”
Draco looked around and saw one karkadan dead on the beach. No, two. And one unicorn was sprawled out on its side, silvery blood pouring from a deep wound in its chest. The rest of the unicorns drew together, facing the trees, their eyes trained on the darkness. Finally, one huffed, and they all relaxed. The one that huffed approached the one that had fallen. Draco could almost swear it looked mournful, its gray eyes downcast. It touched its horn to that one’s horn and after a moment, the unicorn that had been lying prone on the ground just…disappeared. Evaporated.
And then, Potter was hurtling into the quiet space, decked out in muggle clothes – trainers and shorts and a t-shirt. His hair was damp with sweat, his face red, and he seemed full of pent-up frustration. Draco realized he’d known that this garden was near Grimmauld Place, and that he’d also known Potter liked to run through it sometimes. He knew because Potter had told him, one of those starlit nights on Harry’s hill.
Malfoy looked over at Harry. “The boy looks disturbingly like you did at that age,” he said quietly.
doing this to make Harry jealous?
He saw a flicker of gold in his peripheral vision, turned, and realized it was coming from the girl behind the counter. She had shining hair the color of honey in sunlight trailing down her back, far brighter and warmer than anything outside. She was lovely, really. He moved towards her instinctively.
“You’re pissed,” Potter said.
I give and I give and I give and you take, give and you take
“Not long,” Harry said, giving him a quick kiss. Draco wanted to bite that kiss off of Harry’s mouth.
Draco smiled back at him, feeling a pull of attraction. He was, admittedly, a bit of a whore for a handsome face, even if his heart did seem to increasingly lie with Potter.
“Because it’s stupid.”
And I know I need to feel relief
“No, but I’ve thought it. A million times, I’ve thought it. And I thought you felt that way, too.”
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday
“You’re mom’s being really nice,” Harry said quietly to Draco. He didn’t expect her to be mean or anything, not really, but he hadn’t expected
Draco made a little choking gasp and yanked Harry close, and Harry felt that he was kind of trembly, too, which made Harry feel less stupid. “Yes,” Draco whispered. “Yes, I’ll marry you, Harry.”
“I wouldn’t marry her until she was fourteen, probably. It’s…well. If it’ll bring peace to the kingdom, then I’ll do it, won’t I?”
“It’s horrible,” agreed Ron.
“You think we’re going to get home?”
“Because if anything had been different, we might not be where we are now. And I want to be here, Harry. I like here.”
“I gave you a hard time about
“What, you don’t think I’m wearing
Draco, unfortunately, knew what it was like to be faced with no good options. Defy the Dark Lord or kill Dumbledore. Endure Aunt Bella’s
“Wait,” Harry said.
Draco returns to a dark place and turns to Harry for help
Draco bit down on a giggle and decided that on second thought, this was rather fun.
“Good. Because you’re my favorite, too,” Harry said, and their next kiss was wet and hot and messy, and Draco was ready to rip Harry’s clothes off right there.
Harry sat, and Draco set about pouring them glasses of wine from the flagon in his room. “Here,” he said, passing one to Harry and then sitting down across from him.
like sex in here.
“He’s my best friend,” Harry said. “Since forever.”
He didn’t know what he was supposed to do with Draco. Go back to being friends? Stop speaking to him? Punch
“Keys!” he heard Berold bark a moment later. Draco heard them as they (presumably) landed in Berold’s hand. “Now where are they? Fairfax and the black-haired man? Where’ve they been taken?”
She nodded a little. “I can believe that.” She began to fiddle with a stone for a moment, and then picked it up and threw it into the lake. The sun was going down fast, the lake lighting up pink. “Dragon, you only like men, yes?”
Now what?
He stared at her, then gave Draco an equally intense once-over. “You’re wizards, aren’t you?”
Professor McGonagall’s eyes widened slightly.
“Your Highness?” Berold asked, looking worried.
It had only been a few days ago that he’d figured out that he was without a date for the party, and that wasn’t going to work for him. God knew he felt anxious about going at all, and going solo would make it a thousand times worse. He was going to be entering Draco’s home, after all, the epicenter of the life he shared with Astoria; Astoria, who’d wrested Draco away from Harry all those years ago. Astoria, who’d plotted against them and
Malfoy had his hands in Harry’s hair and Harry had his hands down by Malfoy’s waist. It felt so good. He wanted nothing more than to drag Malfoy back to his room and continue this there, within the privacy of his curtains. Instead, with one final, quick, closed-mouth kiss, he pulled away. Malfoy didn’t move for half a second; he seemed frozen in place, which Harry took as a good sign. Then he blinked his eyes open and cleared his throat and looked away.
“Holy fucking Christ!” Potter cried when he saw Draco, and he jumped back and covered his cock with his hands. “What the bloody fuck! What the
Charlie didn’t look angry. He looked hurt, a bit. But he also looked like maybe he’d been expecting this, somehow. “I knew, I think. I didn’t want to look too closely at it, but I think I knew.” He took a sip of his coffee and sat back, thinking. “It’s Harry, isn’t it.” He didn’t even phrase it as a question.
“Sure,” Draco said, straightening. He barked out a laugh. “Sure, why not? Let’s take one more spin on the merry-go-round.”
Edwin didn’t look up at Draco, and Draco hurried quickly to the Badgers, sliding in next to Frankie. He wasn’t hungry at all – he thought maybe he would never be hungry again – but he took some food and poked at it.
There was an exhibit that he loved, that was his favorite, called ‘Elements of the Natural’. One of the paintings there had him utterly captivated. It even had a beautiful name: ‘A Tree that Shatters the Dancing’. It was poetry and art, all at once.
Damnit, the hat was taking an exceptionally long time. What in the world was happening? Had it fallen asleep? He had an urge to walk up and slap it off Potter’s head and maybe stomp on it.
“Definitely,” agreed Daphne.
, in fact, dire, and go back a few hours to change the course of events. I could save myself, and Harry.”
“Oh, fuck,” Cassius moaned.
“Brightbrook!” she hollered, in a voice that sounded much too loud for someone so small.
A knock sounded at his door, and Draco froze. “Yes?” he called.
“Hey, sorry,” said Harry. He grabbed his wand from his pocket and then took off his jeans again and came over near the bed, touching his wand close to his ear and wincing. “He only got one in. But it got me in a weird spot. Sort of made my jaw feel off, like my bite’s not right.”
There was something wrong with him. He knew that.
True, the Dark Lord’s goons would try to make his life hell while he was here, but they had half the time anyway, in the original timeline, when they’d all been on the same side. His father would not let them kill him, Draco was almost certain of that.
Harry went off in the direction the house elf had gone, stepping quietly. Pansy’s townhouse was bigger than it looked from the outside; Harry wondered if it had been spelled that way, like Grimmauld Place. To his relief, past a small dining room, he saw a flash of stainless steel. Kitchen. Water. Thank Merlin.
“Sure,” said Potter, licking his own wrist. “This seriously tastes so good.”
“I think so. I’m fairly certain you hate my guts,” Draco said, turning his barstool so he was facing Potter, and then Potter turned his stool, too, so that their knees were touching. Draco remembered his whole world narrowing down to that little point of contact.
“Draco!” cried Harry.
Niran sighed and took his beautiful abs someplace else.
“Hey, you can’t – what would you say?” said Harry, feeling suddenly uneasy.
“You can’t force these things,” offered Marcia.
That coaxed a little smile from him. “Twit,” Malfoy said, finally meeting his eyes.
“Pansy’s got that effect on people. Gets them excited to do things they usually wouldn’t.” He didn’t realize until he said it that it could be just as easily applied to her tryst with Potter.
Pick up the needle, press pause, or turn the radio off
“Bravo, Harry,” said Pansy. “Very impressive turnaround.”
“Hey, Yuppie,” Seamus said to Robbie.
him. Harry thought this couldn’t be emphasized enough.
“I hate that Shacklebolt likes you better than me,” Potter said.
“Pretend it’s me, my mouth,” Draco whispered before leaning over to kiss Harry’s chest and roll his nipple between his fingers. Harry cried out at that, and at the feel of his spit-slicked palm moving up and down his shaft. He imagined it was Draco’s mouth instead, and that had him bucking up against his hand and moaning. “Oh god,” He said. “Yes.”
Kerrick sheathed his sword, looking around and noticing how terrified everyone was. “Ah. Sorry. Didn’t know what to expect when I came through.”
“I figured you didn’t,” said Harry. Part of him was so angry, to think that Ron hadn't been innocent in this, hadn’t been acting unconsciously. That he'd done all this knowingly, despite all the hurt it might cause. And another part of him felt awful for Ron, because he looked fucking miserable sitting there, all hunched over, cradling his tea.
Mr. Potter, aren’t you?”
Harry looked at him, really looked. “Alright, fine,” he said.
And then he’d leave. And Harry would be alone again. He sighed. “You’re an arsehole, you know that?” he asked Sarah.
Apart
“Yes, well, Pansy hates Astoria, in case you haven’t noticed. I love Pans to bits, but she can be a wee bit territorial when it comes to me.”
Hermione came running in then, eyes wide and frantic. “Stop! Stop it, both of you!” she yelled, and then a moment later, burst into tears. At the sight of her, Weasley went limp against the wall, his eyes fixed on her face, his own face slightly bloodied (but probably not as badly as Draco’s). His chest was heaving.
He put on his pajamas and climbed into bed, picking up a book that Hermione had lent him. It was written by a muggle scientist by the name of Stephen Hawking, and it touched on all sorts of interesting concepts related to time and space. For a muggle, the Hawking fellow knew some things.
“Um. No?”
Potter looked over at him with an expression that was incredibly soft. “You’re a good person, too, Draco. And I like you so much. It’s mad, because I never thought…but then, you’re not
Well, Blaise’s house. She forgot sometimes, that Daphne wasn’t there. It seemed like it would be an impossible thing to forget, but she found herself, much too often, waiting to hear Daphne’s footsteps on the stairs, smiling in anticipation of seeing her straighten up from her favorite chair and chide Astoria for not telling her she was coming over.
“So?”
The guy grinned. “Tease, huh?” he asked.
“I – do you want breakfast?” he said, and his voice sounded strange.
Dinner was unexpectedly nice. Despite being almost eight years younger than he was –
“You did? What was it?” Harry asked, laughing.
“You don’t,” she said, giving his hand a squeeze before dropping it and slipping out the door.
She groaned into her pillow. She did not want to see Daphne right now. She didn’t want to see anyone, but especially her sister, who would no doubt give her some speech about how this was all affecting Scorpius, when really, she couldn’t deal with that on top of everything else. She’d worry about Scorpius in the aftermath. Right now, it was difficult enough to merely
Potter searched Draco’s face for one more moment before dropping his gaze. “Yes, alright,” he said. Draco breathed a sigh of relief as Potter made his way towards the door, but he relaxed too soon, because Potter was suddenly turning to face him one last time, looking determined. “It’s not
Potter looked at him for a moment. “No.”
“Yes,” Harry said. “But I do love you. I really, really do.”
“Merciful Merlin!” exclaimed Blaise, putting a hand to his mouth.
“Mm,” said Draco. He was holding his breath, the way he always did when they were done. Five…four…three…two…
What month? The war ended in May, and Draco had turned eighteen in June. Maybe he ought to skip past the trials. Those had been awful, and even if, in this timeline, he wasn’t being tried (he expected he was not), his parents probably still were. He didn’t need to watch them go through that again. September, then. He’d always loved Septembers anyway.
'Pride,' Dad said. 'This person has already wronged you in some way, and now you are the one who has to swallow your pride, give something up, in order to forgive him.”
“I’m having a great time, yeah,” he said. “Thank you so much for going to all this trouble. It was really nice of you.” He looked flustered again, his cheeks pinkish. His shoulders were very broad, and although he wasn’t bulky, his body looked incredibly strong. And his eyes were still rather fetching.
“You’re not wearing pants,” Potter said, his eyes wide, his hands running over every inch of Draco’s skin that was available. “Fuck, that’s hot.”
dragon, child. As you can plainly see.”
!” Harry exclaimed.
Draco sat up and yelped and then fell back against the couch. “Gah!” he cried, blinking out at them. “What –” His voice sound raspy.
Laurel stared at him and then started laughing. “A Sacred – do you mean a Gate? To another world? Oh, Thera, no. That’s the Seventh Pillar - Pinning. I can barely manage the Third Pillar, so trying to master the Seventh would be futile. No, almost no one can create Gates. Kerrick is the only one still living with that ability, I think.”
“If you need to assuage your guilt, do it after you’ve won, okay?”
“Fine, then. Show me, Potter,” Malfoy said. Harry looked over at him, confused, and then realized he was wiggling his toes.
It was another brilliantly blue day, although around the edges of the meadow, Evenwood Forest looked dark and foreboding as ever. Draco noticed that unlike the trees on the hills and the trees they’d passed on the road to Rodderem, these trees were not changing color with the season. “Do they go red or gold? The leaves here?”
“Charlie…” He didn’t want him to leave. Despite everything, he didn’t want to be without Charlie. Was that loneliness? Or something more? “I’ll miss you,” he said finally. “I like when you’re here.”
“Did you ever come like that with Katie?” Draco asked, smirking, his eyes still closed.
So far, all his fresh starts had been early on: first year, then third year. He knew that if he went back to their later years at school, Draco and Harry would have already established some destructive patterns, but he also knew that the war itself had made things ten times worse between them. It had turned boyhood rivalry into deep-seated animosity; ruined any chance for them to trust one another.
It should hurt, shouldn’t it? Harry felt nothing. Well, other than tired. “Good for them,” he said. “That’s good. They’ll be good for each other. It’s really…good.”
“May I?” Draco asked.
, you arsehole,” said Harry.
“Thanks,” said Draco, drifting back towards his room. Potter was gone, thank goodness, and Draco sat back down on his bed and pulled open his Applied Charms Theory textbook. The bed smelled slightly coconut-y. Draco didn’t cast a cleaning charm over it. It was a nice smell, really.
“Oh, right, so many people would mourn the loss of me,” he said bitterly.
She took one more look around the study, perhaps noting that there were fewer knickknacks scattered about than there had been previously. “I love you, Draco,” she said, fixing him with her gaze, almost pleading.
William and Draco lingered after the others had gone to bed, nursing their cups of wine and talking about the battles and glories of the past. “You seem happy,” Draco said during a lull in the conversation.
It wasn’t Polyjuice. Draco wasn’t crazy about taking on someone else’s form, not to mention, it changed the dimensions of you in an awkward way. You never felt quite like it was your actual body.
Not Malfoy.
She kicked at him with her socked foot. “Come on, Malfoy. Spit it out. You’ll feel better.”
“Yeah, but I didn’t really look, because, you know, it felt like I shouldn’t.”
“Difficult. He wasn’t just any old boyfriend to me, you know.”
Harry smiled his crooked smile. “Me too.” Then he leaned over and kissed Draco once, chastely, on the mouth. “You’re still a wanker, though,” he whispered, then disappeared to the other side of the room before Draco could reply.
OneRepublic /
He’d just killed a man. And not even in battle.
. I don’t give a shit what it is.”
“And why did you not tell me this?”
Draco took his hand. “But we’re not apart anymore. Yes, we have to keep this quiet for now, but I have you back, with me. I can look at you, and I can touch you, and I can kiss you.” He leaned forward and pressed a soft kiss to Harry’s lips. “And not too long ago, I thought that was lost to me forever. So I’d say we’re in a much better place than we were before.”
"I wouldn't have. You've been a good friend."
Hermione gave him a look that said he was not fooling her one bit.
“So, you like people who look like you.”
“Slytherins.”
“I believe you,” said Malfoy. “Do you want to show me?”
“It’s okay,” Draco said quietly. “It’s really okay.” He sat still for a moment, then set down his tea on the coffee table, and then scooted closer to Harry. “Come here,” he said, holding an arm up towards Harry.
, you son of a bitch,” she said.
“Oh, sod off. I’d have never told them what my name means if I knew this shite would happen.”
Draco’s stomach fell right out of his body, or at least that’s what it felt like. Or maybe it was more like a hard punch to the gut. One of those. Definitely gut-related. Definitely unpleasant, bordering on painful. “Oh,” he said, his voice light and conversational. “How long’s that been going on, then?”
“I – “ Harry had never hooked up with a stranger. He’d never hooked up with any man besides Seamus, for Merlin’s sake. He didn’t know how he felt about it. In the past, he’d been of the opinion that feelings ought to be involved when it came to sex, but was that still his feeling about it? He’d had sex with Seamus, after all.
“Okay! I see you learned a trick, damnit! Now tell me how you did it!”
“Not really,” Tony said. He shifted onto the balls of his feet, shoving his hands in his pockets. “We have to get going.”
Astoria did it,” Sarah remarked. “I mean, do you think she really did? I can’t imagine it.”
“Get over here, Harry!” she cried, transfiguring her earrings.
“Harry and Draco aren’t supposed to spend extraneous time together, outside of the proscribed visits,” Hermione said.
school, but Sarah didn’t need to know all of those messy details.
“I’ve wanted you all day,” Draco replied, his breath coming fast. “I’ve been aching for you.”
“Erm. Right,” he said, and dashed to the shower.
His first thought was to cower in shame, for thinking about things that he shouldn’t have been thinking about. His second thought was that Draco Malfoy was wearing trackies. Draco Malfoy, who always looked like he’d stepped out of the pages of
“Hm. Well, good for you. Honestly. It’s not an easy thing to admit to one’s self, I’m sure, especially when you have a family and all.”
With Draco, who had a boyfriend and had no plans to end things.
“Are you, now?” Harry murmured, looking up, a teasing smile on his face.
Ron shook his head. “I was thinking of seeing if you or George wanted to go out for a pint or something, but no, not really.”
She laughed and patted his cheek affectionately. “I know. Draco, Draco, Draco. It’s all about Draco.”
“Oh,” Harry said, chuckling. “I s’pose you did. That was a bit twatty, mate.”
Oh god. Oh god.
“I don’t want to get used to it,” he muttered. Merlin knew, he’d seen enough death in the war at home. The last thing he wanted was to be slicing people open here.
Everyone takes a break to celebrate Gimheif
“Oh, wonderful. Just what I wanted this morning,” Harry groused.
? Draco mouthed. Not to mention, the looks Pansy and Granger were exchanging were just plain odd.
What in Merlin’s name was he even doing? So he’d had a dream, and it had been weird. That didn’t mean that the batty girl in Evenwood Forest was actually a thousand-year-old famous Senweir, or that she’d been the one Kerrick was referencing,
“I dunno, why’d you let Voldemort carve that snake and skull into your arm?”
“Oh, right, yes. Thank you for the, er, drinks,” Ron said.
Harry Potter stood on the front step, dressed in the same ratty jeans and t-shirt he’d been wearing at the pub. His hair was a wreck (what else was new?), his expression grim. Draco’s heart began to thud sickeningly at the sight of him.
“Hepnir and Banneth,” William said, coming to sit next to him. “The god and goddess of morning.”
Lia looked at him like he was the world’s biggest moron, and Frankie laughed. “Course he doesn’t know; he’s not from here,” she reminded Lia.
“I don’t know –” began Harry.
Potter’s hand was running gently over Draco’s shoulder and down his arm, then skimming over the back of Draco’s hand. Draco stayed perfectly still as Potter wrapped Draco’s hand in his own warm, calloused one, just for a moment, before returning to his hair. Draco felt a brush of fingertips against his cheek, then, so light it was barely there. A fingertip ran along his eyebrow and then carefully pushed his hair back behind his ear.
“Well, I am sad,” said Hermione, eyes filling a bit as if to prove the point.
“Hm. Well, good luck, whenever you do have a run-in.”
“How do you know?”
Now Ron actually did choke on his toast, and Hermione had to slap him on the back to get it to dislodge. She turned back to Harry when she was done, and, with a very prim expression on her face, asked, “What do you mean, he talked about sex?”
Hand holding was an unusual experience for Draco. In fact, he couldn’t actually remember ever walking around the city holding hands with anyone. Somehow, though, Charlie’s hand didn’t make him feel strange or uncomfortable. It didn’t feel like too much, or too intense. Like all things with Charlie, it seemed casual and spur-of-the-moment. Draco didn’t know for certain, obviously, but Charlie struck him as the type of bloke who took someone’s hand simply because he felt like it, with no real thought to what it meant or how it would be interpreted. It was the complete opposite of Draco’s approach to such things, which was full of strategic evaluations and second-guessing, not to mention a healthy dose of fear. Draco found he quite liked being with someone who was nothing like him in that way.
“Oh,” Draco said, his murder-y rage melting into a glowing feeling that made him want to hug Hermione and buy her expensive presents instead of ruin her hair.
for being such a git.
He didn’t quite know how it had happened, truth be told. Draco usually wasn’t one for making new friends, and he certainly wasn’t one to open up the way he had with Potter. Merlin, Pansy had been his best friend since they’d both been in diapers, and he felt like he kept more from
And then Harry left, because it felt like it would be easier that way. And the whole thing left him feeling quite empty, and unfulfilled, and he fell asleep in his own bed, thinking of Draco Malfoy and his delicate ears and his beautiful hair and how his face had looked when he had said ‘Now…now I’m this.’
for some fucking reason. And then what.”
An image hit him like a ton of bricks, then, of Malfoy spread out on his purple-curtained bed, leanly muscled legs spread open, hand on his cock. Or maybe, no, maybe someone’s mouth on his cock. A bloke, since Malfoy was gay. Harry placed some nameless, generically attractive bloke there in the image, pictured wet, pink lips, and Malfoy’s wet, pink cock, and Malfoy’s unnerving gray eyes looking down at this person, heavy-lidded with lust. And then the eyes shifted, and he was looking straight at Harry.
“Yeah, I guess I was. I’m not a fan of people with big egos, and you never know, with famous people.”
“What about the fact that I want you there?” Draco tried to sound like he wasn’t whining, but it didn’t quite work. Probably because he
“Cellar,” said the man.
After work, he hurried home to tidy up the house and waited out front for Ginny and the kids. He couldn’t seem to locate Stormy again, but maybe that was just how it was going to be now that it was warm outside. There were probably lots of things to chase.
“Rose is in Gryffindor, as we might have guessed, and so is Farrah,” Harry said.
“Think I heard something about that, too. Lot of fuss over nothing, I’m sure.”
She nodded. “Yes, I know these things can take time. Only…you could do worse, you know. If you choose to be with a man, then Harry Potter isn’t a bad candidate. He is well-loved by many people in power. Loved even more by the public. He’ll go far, with his connections, I think. He’ll be influential, like your father –” her voice gave out here, and Draco wanted to take her hand, to comfort her. But it was not how they behaved in his family. He sat by patiently, and eventually, she collected herself, looking him in the eye. “It would be no small thing, to avail yourself of his resources.”
Potter shook his head. “I need to talk to you. Why is every single sixth-year Slytherin passed out in your room?”
you, in the kitchen. If you wanted me too, why didn’t you say so?”
Draco found himself kissing Potter back, and soon he was so swept away that he forgot to argue the point.
Weasley – or Ron, as Draco was trying to think of him, since it became rather confusing to think of him as Weasley when everyone else was also Weasley – liked to look up from whatever game he was playing or magazine he was reading to glare at Draco until he left the room. The twins spent their time making fun of Draco, with one of them beginning the insult and the other finishing. Ginevra was particularly fond of sticking her tongue out at him, and Bill Weasley, who was occasionally around, eyed him with vague suspicion.
, okay? Take my goddamned arm.”
Running from love
“I...yeah. I would,” Harry said, walking to the table and sinking into one of the kitchen chairs. He felt fucking miserable. And he was rather soaked from his impulsive jog out into the rain.
“Kayli,” corrected Harry.
Suddenly, Pansy was there, pulling at him. “We should go,” she said, and her eyes looked strange.
“Um,” said Draco. “Yes. It’s definitely okay.”
“Oh, I’m well-aware that Pansy has an enormous, probably-not-sexual-but-who-knows crush on you at the moment. She won’t shut up about how bloody great you are. That, in and of itself, is annoying.”
?” she asked. And Draco knew what she was really asking: whether he would be able to move on or not.
“You’d do that to your own sister-in-law?” Nott asked, raising an eyebrow at him. “You’d ruin her reputation?”
“You’re mine,” Harry said.
Draco knew there would be plenty he would leave out. Like, all of it. “Yes, fine,” he said. He would make something up. Something scandalous enough that she’d be satisfied.
Potter laughed. “Yeah, that’s it.” He shifted and scratched his head. “No, ah. One was Cedric Diggory.”
“No, but you can guide us through it. You know it best.”
The look on Potter's face nearly broke Draco's heart in two. "And what if
Harry didn’t know quite what to make of that. Probably it was Malfoy trying his best to prepare his son for survival in a post-Voldemort world. Pureblood ideology was very much on the
They’d have gone through the years together, celebrating one anniversary and then another and another, maybe living in Grimmauld Place (but only if Harry had let Draco fix it up to an acceptable degree) or maybe finding a nice cottage somewhere on the coast. Draco’s always wanted to live on the coast. Somewhere like this, where you could hear waves knocking at your doorstep.
“Damn it,” Daphne whispered.
“Is it –
do that were the cruelest.
They didn’t go all the way to the dining room, but stopped in one of the pretty little sitting rooms, this one with two cream-colored loveseats with sage and yellow pillows and two buttery-yellow wingback chairs. There was also a gleaming cabinet against the wall that Draco opened to reveal shining bottles of liquor. “Firewhiskey –
Draco scooted, and patted the bed next to him. “You go here, Harry. I’ll even let you have my best pillow.”
Then, as he finished the last word, it felt like a dam broke in his head, and the pain disappeared instantly and was replaced by a bright light, blinding for a moment, and then it began to dim until it normalized.
“Yeah, thanks,” Charlie said. “Half and half.”

He grinned. “Maybe not, like, right away. In the future, though.”
I think I believe me
“Well, I need something. These tomatoes are probably going to explode all over me. They’re really ripe.”
“Well, I don’t need help! I certainly don’t need
Theo talks to Draco
After the prison visit, Harry put a hand on Draco’s shoulder as he passed by his seat on the bus. “You were brilliant in there,” he said softly.
“But you still did.”
, gin, scotch, a few things that I’ve never heard of, rum…what do you say, Harry?”
“You realize that you were the one who started all of it, don’t you?” Draco snapped before he could help himself. “I offered you my hand, a long time ago, on the train. We could have been friends, you and I. But instead, you threw my kindness back in my face.” Draco was appalled by how fresh that rejection felt, given that it was over a decade old.
Draco, ever susceptible to compliments, felt himself flush. “I wasn’t sure I could do it.”
Her head was in the flames, looking distinctly unhappy. “And just why have you blown us all off
“She’s gone,” Frankie said, and turned away. “Get up. Get him up. We need to go.”
Draco laughed bitterly. “I’m aware. I spent the first eighteen years of my life being a complete horror.”
, replied Draco.
Draco shot Will a knowing look before
Harry suspected this would include pastry. “Yes, please,” he said, scurrying after Mrs. Malfoy’s elegant form. Draco fell into line behind him.
And who can love you like me (nobody)
Malfoy leaned against the counter and crossed his arms. “Yes, I like them,” he said. His hair was falling fetchingly in his eyes, and his posture, though relaxed, was a thousand times more elegant than anything Harry might’ve managed, and Harry was struck again by how beautiful Malfoy had gotten. It was…distracting.
“But that one was so fit!” she cried.
Draco was curled up on the floor, a dusty tapestry covering him, fast asleep. His blond hair was shining in the gloom, his face peaceful, his pointy, stubborn chin relaxed into softness. Harry knelt by his side and watched his chest move up and down, watched his curled fingers twitch once and then become still again. “Draco,” he whispered, reaching out to touch his pale brow. “Draco.”
“No, Troy. I don’t.”
“Erm. I hope so?”
“But the blood…”
She cleared her throat and said nothing.
He knew this to be true. Harry was certainly alone on occasion (e.g., most of the time), and, no, it couldn’t be helped. “Oh, hun,” he said, petting her hair gently, much like he soothed the cats when they got freaked out during a thunderstorm. “You’re a very brave girl. This thing isn’t real, this Slenderman, but mum and I will protect you. And even when we can’t, you’re so brave. And strong.” He put a hand around her bicep. “Look at this, have you been lifting weights?”
The night before they were to take an underground wizard flash train (something unique to America, apparently, that they used instead of floos) to New York City, Harry was lying awake talking to Pansy. There were about six of them to a room, so there was absolutely no privacy, but nobody cared.
They passed the joint back and forth as they talked, and Harry poured them another glass of wine. Soon he began to feel very peaceful and sort of floaty.
Uncertainty stinging clear
Draco’s mind scrambled for a way around this, for an escape, and came up with nothing. He was totally trapped. He dropped his wand.
You should’ve talked to him before inhaling the last couple of glasses of champagne, probably. This will not end well.
“I have not –” Potter hissed.
“Yes,” she said, shaking herself a bit. “I suppose we should. When can we begin, Father Gibb?”
Shaw sighed. “Don’t thank me yet, Mr. Potter. Let’s get her through the next forty-eight hours, and then you can thank me.”
himself. And if he hadn’t been busy trying to compete with Potter, maybe he wouldn’t have needed that. Or maybe he would’ve; who knew? “I don’t know, really,” he said, finally. “What’s the point of thinking about it?”
“You’re not uncomfortable with this? Not at all?”
Draco felt his mouth go up on one side even though he was trying to appear stern. “I suppose it was rather cool.”
attractive. Not as attractive as say, Cedric Diggory was, but then again, few are.” Draco suddenly found that he hardly minded the pounding in his head at the moment. This was
She smiled again. “Evenwood protects me. It would never let you hurt me.”
Ginny nodded and stepped through the entrance into the hallway and waited for Harry to come out. “How’s the rest of your day been?” she asked. She seemed rather nervous, which was unusual for Gin. She may not have been that way when she was younger, but in the past year or so, Ginny had grown into one of the most confident, fearless people Harry’d ever encountered. It was one of the things he loved about her, before.
and there still wasn’t. Maybe it was only Harry, all of it, and there was simply something wrong with him. It would make sense, really. He hadn’t been raised normally. No part of his life had ever been what you’d call conducive to mental health. He’d been trapped in a house with people who despised him until he was eleven. And then he’d had a tyrannical, sadistic madman sharing space in his head for
“What tattoos does Malfoy have on his hips, then? You ought to know, if all this is true.”
Slowly, he realized it had been there all along. He’d just been stupid.
“There’s something I’d like to try, but I think we ought to clear the area first,” Draco said.
Harry laughed. “Hey, you’re going to Daphne’s thing in July, aren’t you?”
