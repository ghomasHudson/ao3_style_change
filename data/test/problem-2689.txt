“Uhm, Professor Slughorn?” Ron piped up as they took their seats at the table with the Amortentia cauldron on it. “I haven’t got a textbook. I didn’t know until this morning that I’d be able to continue with Potions.”
As he bounded down the stairs, he once more revelled in the fact that he didn’t have to be careful to be quiet anymore now that Walburga’s portrait was gone. Narcissa had done him a real favour there.
need a room in your quarters?”
He felt a stab of guilt. No, he didn’t hate the boy that much. He hated James Potter, and he’d hated his carbon copy called Harry Potter, because Harry Potter had forced him to look upon the man who’d taken Lily from him again and again. This past week, however, he’d found himself inexplicably drawn to the boy. None of the irritating little habits he used to display, that were so much like James Potter’s, remained.
Harry threw the book closed with a loud bang and stood, seething.
“I’ll miss you, too,” Harry replied, blinking away the wetness in his eyes. “But we’ll see each other soon, promise.”
“Now sounds great,” Draco cuts him off.
“I can’t accept this, Narcissa,” he insisted. “It’s too much!”
“Hey there, cub,” said Remus with a wide smile. “How are you holding up?”
She smiled again, then approached him and extended her hand. “Very well, Harry, in that case please call me Narcissa. It’s a pleasure to finally meet you under more friendly circumstances.”
Harry tried, he really did, but his mind would simply not quiet down. Luckily, he somehow managed to suppress any thoughts of Sirius or his father—no, not his father,
from Voldemort? Had the whole world turned upside down now?
“No,” he said softly. “I don’t hate him. But I quite frankly didn’t want to consider the possibility myself, it seemed so absurd. And let’s be honest with ourselves, Potter would rather be an orphan than my son. I can hardly blame him for that. I figured even if, against all odds, it was true, it wouldn’t be something he’d want to know. So I did not bring up the possibility because it is irrelevant that it exists. He has you, Lupin. For all intents and purposes, you’re currently acting as his guardian and father figure.”
“Well done, cub, you’ve won the last ten matches,” Remus praised, rubbing his chest where the stunner had hit him.
There is also something in this chapter relating to the
That made Severus pause. It was true, his position as a spy might one day very well be the only thing standing between Harry’s life and the Dark Lord.
“What are
The first thing Severus became aware of as he woke up was the thrumming pain in his skull. It took considerable effort to force his eyes open. He was in his own bed. That was a good start, even though he couldn’t remember getting there. In fact, his memory of what exactly had happened was rather hazy in general.
Severus thought, almost rolling his eyes.
at the first sign of vulnerability? Because frankly, vulnerability is part of a friendship. What good is friendship if you can’t share your burdens with each other? You can’t run from people every time they get close to you, Severus.”
The seamstress picked up Draco’s robes, adding them to Harry’s pile—and his bill. Draco quickly stepped forward to correct her, “Those are mine, they don’t go on his check.”
Harry’s insides churned. Surely Healers were sworn to help any patient, right? But even if they were, Narcissa was right. Not even Dumbledore could save Severus from Azkaban if they brought him to the hospital with wounds that were clearly inflicted by dark magic practically screaming
It had definitely not been the first time that Harry noticed how attractive the Slytherin Prince was, but it was the first time he actually allowed himself the thought. In the hallways of Hogwarts there were too many witnesses, and usually too much other shit going on for Harry to dwell on the heated glares he exchanged with Draco, to think about the pull he felt towards him, like a magnet. Here, he had literally only worse things to think about, so he chose Draco’s seemingly insatiable and inexplicable need for attention gladly over all the alternatives. It made him feel a little giddy, even, to think that a man like
Taken aback, Harry shrugged mutely. He didn’t particularly care. “Whichever you like, only two of them are occupied,” he mumbled, suddenly feeling awkward.
“I’ll go with him,” said Lupin.
He sneered at her, his voice cold as he answered, “You mean Barty Crouch Junior, the Death Eater who forced me to enter the Triwizard Tournament so I’d end up on that graveyard to be used in Voldemort’s resurrection. Sure, I’ll trust his word without any hesitation whatsoever.”
Draco snorted. “A little,” he agreed. “What’s it like to suddenly be a father?”
“Thank you,” Harry whispered. He leaned in, letting his lips hover above Draco’s, just close enough to lightly brush when Draco smiled. For a moment, Harry relished the tension between them, deliberately waiting to close the distance. As expected, Draco didn’t stand for that tease for long and he pulled him in, moulding their mouths together and drawing a moan from Harry. He would
Alright, I’ll shut up about ADHD again.
As always I hope you liked it and thanks for reading <3
I mentioned this idea of Severus walking in on Remus in the bathtub, because they share a bathroom with two doors, in passing. REALLY only in passing, but Alex latched on to it and made me pinky promise to write it, even if it was just a short filler-chapter. I tried to include some minor plot as well and it somehow turned out a bit more sexual than intended (whops).
“But first: Are there any questions?” Harry asked into the crowd.
Harry’s tone was thoughtful when he replied, “If only I had known, I would’ve—”
After a few beats of silence, Lupin spoke again. “We should go downstairs, Narcissa is preparing dinner.”
Severus groaned again and his eyes fluttered. Harry summoned another healing and Blood-Replenishing potion, feeding him both. Unfocused black eyes were staring back at him.
Draco laughed, inspecting himself in the mirror. Yes, he rather liked the robes, and Harry’s reaction alone would’ve been enough for him to buy them in any case.
“Explain it then,” Harry insisted, his face hard.
“I mean, no, if it was up to me I’d tell the whole world,” Harry said earnestly, and Draco felt like he might explode from joy, “but I somehow doubt people would just accept it that easily. I’m used to nasty rumours about myself, but you’re not. I don’t want anyone to give you a hard time.”
“Because!” Harry half-shouted, jumping to his feet. “Because maybe I’m just so bloody desperate for a family that— Oh I don’t know, it just is.”
“I apologise, I didn’t know it wasn’t supposed to be touched. I’ll tell Kreacher to get Draco his own sweets, and I’ll replace yours, of course,” Narcissa replied smoothly, taking a sip of her coffee.
“Two,” Harry interrupted, surprising Severus. Of course, how silly of him. Harry would have his own list of things to talk about.
Potter didn’t talk to him at dinner. He didn’t talk to him the next day either, or the next. Instead, he ate silently, the tension between him and Severus so thick you could’ve cut the air with a knife. As soon as his plate was empty Potter disappeared immediately after each meal, avoiding to talk to anyone at all—save for Lupin, who had the privilege to be allowed to visit Potter’s room. If Potter was there in the first place.
“What did you do when you were at the Manor?”
It took longer than usual but eventually it worked and tension began to seep out of Harry’s body as he melted into Draco’s arms. They stayed like that for several long minutes, Draco’s hand still rubbing soothing strokes onto Harry’s back. Eventually, Harry pulled back and Draco let him, both of them settling into the couch cushions. Draco took his hand, feeling a strong need to keep some sort of contact, while Harry stared absent-mindedly into the fireplace.
“Do what?”
“Then I will—”
. When Harry got to the part about Voldemort on the back of Quirrell’s head, Draco went uncharacteristically quiet, until he finally walked right up to Harry and pulled him into a tight hug, as if he was afraid that Harry would suddenly drop dead out of nowhere.
Draco nodded. He looked almost hopeful now, despite the fear still lingering in his eyes.
Oh, and if you’re curious as to what I imagine Harry to look like now, think Ben Barnes (with the slightly longer hair, like he looks when people fancast him as young Sirius).
Harry’s smile could’ve replaced the sun.
“Mother! Let me go, you don’t understand.”
“And what are you doing?” Severus asked coldly, glaring at Harry.
“Lord Potter and Lord Black, hm?” he teased, handing the parchment back to Harry. “Quite the titles for an almost-sixteen year old. I see you’ve already stocked up on suitable attire.”
His vaguely positive thoughts about the elf quickly dissipated, however, when Kreacher brought two sets, setting one up in front of Severus, who was still sitting in his armchair. That hadn’t been the idea.
and figure out the plan as he went, only narrowly remembering to grab his wand for light. He all but flew down the stairs, making barely any noise, a skill honed by years of sneaking through the Manor way after his bedtime, ready to dash back to his room at the slightest hint of his parents. Upon reaching the ground floor, he slowed. He’d checked the drawing room upstairs for good measure and it had looked empty, but with Potter that didn’t necessarily mean anything, since he somehow managed to
he saved himself by leaping behind a fallen tree.
The woman looked up from her reading, raising an eyebrow.
Remus looked at her sharply. “Progress?”
Harry’s insides turned to ice. There was only one way to interpret Remus’ words, but that couldn’t be. Absolutely not. No.
“I was afraid,” Harry admitted softly after a short pause. “I was hoping you wouldn’t, and part of me believed you wouldn’t, but I was afraid. Vernon— He used to say that nobody would want me either way, not once they’d see what a freak I am—”
Albus regarded him thoughtfully for a moment, then nodded.
If Harry was to be believed, said bloody reason had apparently been resolved in the long half-hour during which Harry had gone downstairs to fetch a couple of snacks for them. Just a quick break from reading, from studying.
Wordless? Harry, that is really advanced magic! Most people cast spells like that verbally their entire life. How on earth did you manage that so quickly?”
his mind supplied helpfully.
Remus pulled back slowly, holding Harry’s face between his hands. “We haven’t been as close as I’d have liked until now, and I understand that I can’t ever replace Sirius, but I want you to know that I’m always here for you. In fact, I’ll be the one staying with you over the summer. Dumbledore agreed that you’d be safest here for the time being and approved that I be the one watching over you.”
“We have to check on them,” he said firmly, already moving towards the door.
“Earth to Harry,” Ginny called, snapping her fingers in front of his face.
“What?” he asked, trying not to let his irritation bleed into his tone.
For a long time, Remus simply listened to Harry breathe, content to lie there and serve as a living pillow if it made his cub feel safe. Then, he heard soft voices from downstairs. If he hadn’t been in his wolf form, he wouldn’t have understood a single word, but as it was he was easily able to follow the dispute going on down below.
Edit 20.1.2021 - slight adjustment of dialogue and tone, no content changes
Remus took a deep breath. “Harry, both your appearance and your magical signature were charmed to resemble James Potter. Now that these charms were stripped down, the resemblance is gone.”
“Can I just
Draco tilted his head considering that for a second, then shrugged indifferently.
Harry pouted, “Can’t we just do the recap later?”
Frustration bubbled up in him, frustration with Potter, with himself and with the unfairness of Potter’s apparent ability to avoid him. Sulking, he stalked back into his bedroom, right next to Potter’s.
“Why would I need this many variations of a shield charm if a regular Protego does the trick?” he whined.
After a short silence, Narcissa drew a deep breath and levelled her gaze at Harry. “So,” she said, smiling slightly, “I’m guessing you have more than just a couple questions. And, I must be honest, so do I, but those can wait for now. Please, Harry, ask whatever you wish to know.”
“Just my shampoo,” he replied, stirring in the hair until the liquid turned pale purple.
“Thank you, Professor,” said Harry, Draco echoing his words.
“No.”
“Fine, fine.” He took a deep breath, trying to steady himself, and then went on to tell Narcissa everything Severus had said. Not that it had been a lot in the first place.
“Tired,” Harry replied curtly, not looking in Remus’ direction.
“Sure, summon mine too?”
. He was at Grimmauld Place. Not Privet Drive. Draco kept his eyes locked on Harry’s and Harry lost himself in the swirling silver-grey irises. He didn’t know how long they stood there, but eventually, the ringing in his ears subsided and his heart began to slow down.
Blaise arched an eyebrow at him, pointedly looking at the notebook in his hands. Draco held his gaze, keeping his face neutral. It was easier than it had been back at Grimmauld Place. Lying. So much easier. For a moment Draco wondered whether that meant that he didn’t care for Blaise, but he dismissed the thought as quickly as it came. Of course he cared for Blaise, they were best friends. But their dynamic had always included their masks—they both accepted that occasionally lying to each other was just a part of their lives, of their assigned parts to play in society. Their trust was based upon the fact that none of their lies would endager their friendship, and Draco intended to uphold that trust. He’d never lie to Blaise about something that was directly relevant to the two of them.
“Did you by any chance speak about anything else?” he prodded, biting back a grin when Severus rolled his eyes at him.
Hermione blinked at him in barely veiled shock, before shaking herself a little and nodding. “Yes, I suppose I could,” she admitted.
Draco glanced up at him in surprise. “Of course, why would it change anything?”
to protect him from actual, physical abuse. He wanted to dismantle her bone by bone, along with her monstrosity of a husband and disgrace of a son.
, Albus, you can not expect this from me,” Severus retorted, his voice still raised.
Harry dashed ahead, almost toppling over Draco who came running down the stairs as well. Within seconds, the table was clear and Harry cast a strong
Remus hummed, thinking over her words. Social gatherings were not really an option and neither was the rest of her usual networking. You-Know-Who already had too many followers in the Ministry and too many more under the Imperius curse. It was a shame, really, those connections could have been incredibly beneficial to the war effort if Narcissa were—
“Yes, I suppose so,” Remus said thoughtfully.
Nine sixteen.
“Don’t even say it,” Harry interrupted her. “This is not your fault. You wanted the best for me, I was just too scared to bloody well tell him myself.”
that Slughorn treated like that. He glanced over at Blaise Zabini who had also been invited to the Slug Club, but the Slytherin’s face was completely blank.
Harry got up immediately and asked, “Can I help you with anything, Narcissa?”
“What do you want, darling?” Harry’s breath was hot on Draco’s skin as he spoke. “You have to tell me.”
Harry startled a little and hurried to follow Ron and Hermione out of the dungeon classroom.
“That would be much appreciated, thank you.”
He was just about to launch into his explanation when the compartment door opened and Ginny stepped in.
“Father made it possible.”
But it wasn’t just looks. Where Potter had previously been a carbon copy of his father—no, of James Potter—down to the smallest gestures, his entire demeanour had suddenly changed. He still fidgeted, but he did it in a far less disruptive manner now, and he clearly tried to control it. His facial expressions, which had been a mirror image of James’ until now, were much subtler than before; though he still couldn’t hide his emotions completely. The unguarded arrogance Severus associated with Potter’s face was all but gone. In its place, Severus had observed a cautious sort of confidence when Potter had dealt with Narcissa, and a surprisingly intelligent, controlled attitude during their Occlumency lesson.
a vicious little voice in his head hissed. Severus did his best to ignore it.
Also, the actual coolest thing: My best friend and editor/alpha/beta-reader
Harry, who’d broken off mid-sentence at the sudden movement beneath his feet, blinked twice, then shook his head with a smile and continued, “Okay, uh— Where was I? Right — the main purpose of the DA is simple: learning how to defend yourself. With an active war going on, a little extra practice in defensive spells and strategies can’t hurt. Being able to duel properly and holding your own in a fight might very well save your life in the near future.”
“It will also pick up on certain emergencies by itself, like if you fall unconscious. I know it’s a little…unconventional, but I thought it could be useful and—”
Remus drew in a sharp breath and Draco paled significantly at the now unobstructed sight of Severus’ wounds. It looked abhorrent. There was barely an inch of unmarred skin left on his arms and sides, his thighs only marginally better. Harry’s head was swimming and fear threatened to paralyse him.
. He briefly wondered if Potter was using some weird sort of magic to make his insides feel like liquid, but the thought was pushed to the background by the feeling of Potter’s teeth nibbling on his ear.
“Where have you been?” asked Blaise as he handed her the bottle of firewhisky and a glass.
Draco almost answered, only remembering at the last second that he was not supposed to know and would have no good explanation for knowing who Slughorn was. He forced himself to shrug instead.
Severus grimaced. “I know that, I—”
“This isn’t going to be easy,” said Severus softly, “but it’s going to be alright. Just always remember that I am incredibly proud to call you my son, no matter what act I have to put on for the rest of the world.”
Harry startled and spun around. Draco was leaning against the door-frame, grinning at him.
That stung and Harry frowned. He’d thought this kind of thing was behind them.
Harry’s eyes darkened, his tongue darting out to wet his lips. Draco’s resolve wavered. Then Harry gave the tiniest eye-roll and, after getting out of his shoes as well, settled next to Draco and snuggled into his embrace.
As always thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed it!
“Ron’s point was silly though, really. He said that I look nothing like myself anymore—no shit, Sherlock. He insisted that it wasn’t the face, but the clothes, that you’re trying to influence me and turn me into something I’m not. I thought it was kinda funny because half the family actually complimented me on my outfit when they arrived, so you can’t be all that bad of an influence.”
a pain in the arse.”
“I can learn!” Pansy protested, and was about to launch into a rant when a small second-year Ravenclaw interrupted them.
“Where are your glasses?”
He could never be part of their world, because he was a
“You look like you bit into a lemon, Draco,” Blaise said flatly.
he thought wryly. When Blaise was a few steps further down the corridor, Draco turned so the notebook would be shielded from his view if he looked back and moved to open it again—and almost jumped as he felt something touch his arm. A hand wrapped around his wrist, causing him to flinch and instinctively pull away, until his brain finally caught up with the situation.
“Dumbledore thinks I could use my connection to Voldemort to look into
Harry beamed and pulled Draco closer.
“Yes.”
Seventh year, chaser. It made sense, Draco supposed. “Are you still going to play, though?”
Harry stared at her, incredulous.
“Mother is ready,” said Draco without preamble, looking pleadingly at Severus.
He trailed off, face flushing a little. Harry was eyeing the box curiously, clearly intrigued. Draco held his breath as Harry flipped up the clasps to open it—and gasped. The nervousness coiling in Draco’s stomach amplified and he had to hold back from starting to babble.
“How did it go? Please tell me nothing went up in flames, it’s not impossible with Finnegan involved.”
Forcing himself to leave the little bubble Draco and him had created in the Room of Requirement in order to go to breakfast the next morning was probably Harry’s least favourite thing he’d ever done. And he’d bloody well fought Voldemort. Repeatedly.
The memory of the Dark Lord digging into his mind and finding Lily flared up. No, perhaps this was a good thing. He had to compartmentalise anything that could make him vulnerable, and keeping this casual could only aid that endeavour. Severus couldn’t afford to fall in love now—not in the middle of a war with his own son at its centre. With Remus offering companionship and casual sex Severus got the best of both worlds—the safety of emotional detachment and the luxury of satisfied desires.
“That’s what
Severus watched Harry unwrap his presents with increasing nervousness. Books, clothes, fireworks—all perfectly regular gifts. The longer he watched, the more he began to regret his rather extravagant choice of gift. He’d wanted something special, something useful and unique. And he’d found it, there was no denying that his gift met those two conditions, but he doubted his choice all the same. Even Draco’s gift, although definitely also useful and unique, was much less
“Certainly,” Severus agreed in a pleasant tone.
Severus nodded, his eyes full of pity that Draco didn’t want. He could keep his pity, Draco wanted to be with Harry. Really be with Harry, not sneaking around in secluded corridors and empty classrooms. Not that he would mind getting Harry into an empty classroom, but that was supposed to be
Harry nodded and hopped off the platform. “Would everyone please stand in this half of the room?”
“I’ll go get the room ready,” he declared and pushed away from the table before either of his friends could argue and only a couple minutes later he was pacing in front of the wall on the seventh floor, asking for a suitable venue for the DA.
But waiting shouldn’t be too bad, I hope, if I leave you with Part 1 completed.
“Yes,” Severus agreed, “we should.”
He fled to the hidden library, one of the only rooms he still hadn’t shown Draco. Only when his bracelet kept pulsing against his wrist, signalling him that Draco was looking for him, did he leave again to go back to his room. They didn’t talk that night, and though Draco initially tried asking him what had happened, he quickly figured that Harry was not up for a retelling.
It gave Harry some hope. If they were truly Draco’s friends, they’d stand by him even if he publicly turned his back on his father—unless they’d already pledged themselves to Voldemort. Draco had insisted that it was unlikely to happen for his closest friends before they graduated. Blaise Zabini’s mother was neutral and her husbands usually didn’t live long enough to influence Blaise. Pansy Parkinson’s family sympathised with Voldemort, but none of them were actual Death Eaters. Of course, Crabbe and Goyle Senior were Death Eaters—Harry knew as much from the graveyard—but their sons were “too dim to be useful for a mission like that” according to Draco.
Ginny grinned at him, clearly enjoying his embarrassment. He grimaced at her.
Remus’ frown deepened.
when he was rejected without explanation. Draco had been furious with Severus. He’d tried to talk to him, even, but to no avail. His godfather had shut himself away, apparently determined to keep his distance from the rest of Grimmauld Place’s inhabitants, for whatever bloody reason.
Just looking at it made Harry’s head spin.
Narcissa nodded. “Yes, there is. But we’ll make good use of it, I already talked to Harry about repurposing some of the bedrooms.”
Remus nodded. “He is the leader of the Order, he founded it during the First Wizarding War.”
“Alright, alright, slow down, cub,” Remus laughed, as he settled into one of the dark velvet armchairs. “What is so exciting?”
next time.” The smile turned carnal, and even more of his irises was swallowed by black.
Severus downed his firewhisky in one and refilled the tumbler.
The spell was remarkably effective, not only closing the wound but also pulling at least some of the blood back into Severus’ body. Within mere minutes, there was nothing but fine, white scars left of the horrible gashes. When Harry was satisfied, he looked back at Severus’ face, only to see that his eyes were closed again and— Was he still breathing?
perfect?
“Draco already knows about the prophecy,” he said with a grin and gestured for Draco to join him on the couch.
“Yes, but I mean as a teacher.”
“You mean apart from the fact that you’re the most distracted person I know?”
“I will,” he promised.
Harry nodded, grinning widely.
“I guess I learned to tame it,” Harry replied, fighting another wave of laughter.
with Harry much sooner than anticipated. The thought alone made him squirm. While he wasn’t a shy person when it came to sex, he also wasn’t a particularly
about doing—
“Did you run over here?”
She gave him a bright smile. “You’re welcome.”
Draco paused this time to actually think about what Harry was asking. They’d have to tell them eventually, granted that they didn’t decide that this wasn’t working within the week, which Draco seriously doubted would happen considering their past few hours. Or the past few years, even. He liked Harry. He
Draco didn’t retreat immediately as Remus had expected, given his obvious fear of werewolves. Instead he just stood there, staring at them, as if transfixed by what he saw. Harry shifted again, letting out a soft, sleepy noise, and Remus could virtually watch Draco melt.
, but the scars. The scars are fucking disgusting.” He shot Draco an apologetic look. “And I feel bad because you had to see that, but I know it was inevitable. Now that you know you can just…avoid them, I guess. I’m sorry.”
“Many times since we’ve last seen each other,” she replied flatly and Severus rolled his eyes.
how he talked about you. He really wanted to make this work between you, I truly think he did.”
before Draco had spoken about him. Just like Draco had been Malfoy, all the Slytherins had existed only with their surname in Harry’s head—and now they didn’t anymore. He’d have to be careful not to slip up if he ever interacted with any of them; with Draco at least the necessity to call him by his last name was present in Harry’s mind, not so much with the rest of them.
“Gods, you’re beautiful,” he breathed without even thinking about it.
As weird as Luna and the things her father put into this magazine were, they had never once wavered in their support of him. It was not something he would just forget about. Still, when she began to patter about Crumple-Horned Snorkacks, he was glad for Neville’s interruption.
“I thought we could duel, actually,” Harry said. “Demonstrate what the DA is going to be about.”
Hermione raised a questioning eyebrow at Draco and he sighed.
To give you something to look forward to during the potentially extended wait: The next chapter finally introduces Draco's POV ;)
I hope you enjoyed it and as always thanks for reading. <3
There have also been minor changes throughout the fic to fix/unify formatting, correct typos/grammar and in rare occasions adjust the wording a little. Again, no content changes.
“I mean that I understand if—” He trailed off, struggling with himself. “—if you’d rather not touch me again,” he finally whispered. Draco’s heart broke clean in two.
Severus hesitated again, his face twisting in pain and regret.
Severus laughed. “Indeed.”
Hermione’s eyes widened and she bit her lip, looking guilty. “I didn’t mean—”
Draco exhaled audibly, trying to calm his racing heart. Then realisation set in and his heart rate spiked up again, tingles running up his arm from where Harry was touching him through the cloak. He felt a tug on his wrist—Harry wanted Draco to follow him. His heart gave another pathetic little stutter as excitement rushed through him and he allowed the invisible hand to lead him down the corridor of the train.
He forced his attention back to Hermione and replied, “I already told you what he’s like.”
“We picked different ones,” he said, sounding somewhat apologetic.
Remus turned his head back to give him an incredulous look.
He didn’t.
“That was absolutely amazing. You’re amazing,” said Harry breathlessly, snuggling into him.
“I wish. No, I failed too many of my N.E.W.T.s—so I’m retaking them,” Cassius Warrington replied.
Harry released a shaky breath. “Yeah, okay. Alright. This is fine. It’s gonna be fine. It
Draco rolled his eyes so hard that only the whites were visible for a moment. “Fucking— Let me— Come back here!” He pushed against Harry’s grip, but with his arms pinned above his head he was at a disadvantage.
Harry laughed. “I know you, Draco, and that was your worrying face. It’s going to be fine, you’ll see. They just have to see who you really are and they’ll like you in a heartbeat.”
all summer?”
“The position of Defence Against the Dark Arts will be taken over by Professor Snape,” said Albus, sweeping his arm towards Severus.
Alright, alright, I— Kiss the tip again, do what you did before. Taste me.”
For the next two hours they selected outfit after outfit for Harry, had him try it on and then judged whether it was worthy to be purchased or not. It was honestly the most fun Draco had had in years, while Harry, though he seemed to be enjoying himself, looked a little overwhelmed. After they had amassed an incredible collection of clothing for Harry, Draco finally declared their haul complete and released Harry, taking the changing room for himself instead to try on the dress robes he’d chosen. They were midnight blue, with silver ornaments that matched his eyes running along the seams. When he stepped out of the fitting room, he heard Harry inhale sharply and had to suppress a grin. At least he wasn’t the only one admiring his boyfriend.
Severus shook his head. “I started the transformation once, a long time ago. Unfortunately, I never completed it.”
Here’s the second part of that way-too-long chapter that I split in two — which is why we’re still with Draco’s POV.
Potter practically flew out of his chair and whirled around, drawing his wand—where the hell had he been keeping that?—in one fluid motion. Draco narrowly kept himself from flinching, forcing his posture to stay relaxed. If Potter decided to hex him in earnest, he probably wouldn’t stand a chance either way.
“So you know,” Draco said softly, pulling Harry out of his musings.
“It’s amazing, Draco, thank you,” he said softly, his voice a bit breathy.
“How wonderful,” said Luna, “I love the DA. It’s like having friends.”
“Fine.”
“Actually, she’s a few years older than me and has a job at the MMI.”
Her smile widened. Just as she opened her mouth to respond again, Harry appeared seemingly out of nowhere and flopped down on the couch next to Draco, holding a plate with snacks under his nose.
Remus gave Harry an encouraging smile, before addressing Snape. “Would you mind coming back later—”
“What?” he answered, aware that he sounded harsher than Remus deserved. There was a short silence, as if Remus was rethinking what he was about to say.
Even though he was fairly sure none of his current house mates knew about the hidden rooms, he threw the strongest locking charm he knew at the door, along with a silencing charm just for good measure. Breathing deeply, he tried to clear his mind, to sort the millions of jumbled thoughts racing through his brain.
room. It took the full effort of years of practised self-control for Remus to freeze instead of flinch, which would’ve set the bloody water in motion, which could’ve moved the remaining bubbles, which
“Do you want to know more about them? The other spells?” he asked carefully.
Hello everyone!
Leaving Ron and Hermione to find a good spot, he quickly hurried to his room to pick up Sirona. Despite their initial shock—especially on Neville’s part—the Gryffindor boys had quickly accepted her presence in their dorm, much to Harry’s relief. Nevertheless, he didn’t want to risk too many people seeing her outright, so he had refrained from taking her to classes so far. Nevertheless, he had gotten used to her presence in the past month, and he didn’t want to leave her alone all day long. Perhaps he’d keep her with him for the rest of the day.
Severus winced at that.
“You know, I really wish you people could settle on
“Whatever spells he used that made him lose his humanity; it was most likely an intentional change.” Ron paled significantly, but Harry went on undeterred. “There
“Yes,” he mumbled eventually, returning to stand next to the bed. “Yes, that will work.”
Lupin snorted. “We both know that’s a ridiculous accusation. You knew Lily as well as I did, she was as loyal as they come.”
The second transformation was a little more complicated; the addition of another bathroom adjacent to Harry’s room, because Severus doubted that the boy would be happy with having to share with his father. Especially if Draco was around, they’d want privacy.
“Come for me, baby,” whispered Harry.
“You’re expected to be friends with more popular people than us,” Luna deadpanned, eyes still on the Quibbler.
“I get it,” he said softly. “It’s not enough to just sit here, it feels like doing nothing at all. But Narcissa’s idea is perfect, we’ll have to be patient. For now, we should probably let it go, as much as that bothers me. Harry is safe now—or, well, he’s as safe as Harry can get—but he’s never going back there.”
Theoretically, Draco had known what to expect, had felt it clearly beneath his fingers already, and even knew the story behind it. The sight of it still shocked him. Harry’s back was covered in scars; some looking old, pale and faded, others still faintly pink, raising from the surrounding skin. Either these had been absurdly deep, or they couldn’t be older than a year. Slowly, Draco lifted a shaky hand and ran his fingers down Harry’s spine, feeling every bump.
The door opened and Draco twisted his head around so fast that his neck popped. Harry slid inside, breathing deeply and giving Draco a smile that made him feel slightly weak.
“I, er, I didn’t ask,” he said, looking bashful. “I was a little distracted by the whole Lord Potter and Lord Black thing.”
After sending Hedwig on her way, he decided to explore the house.
“They’re invisible,” said Luna matter-of-factly. “They fly into your head and make your brain go fuzzy. Everyone has them sometimes, but you used to be surrounded by them—now you’re not anymore.”
At this point, Draco couldn’t hold back any longer. “Don’t they know
After he was gone, Draco turned to Harry. “What do you want to do until this place gets flooded by red-heads? It’s your birthday, we should do something fun.”
Harry gaped at him. “Are you serious?”
“Double Protean charm,” Harry proclaimed proudly. “I had the idea because of how Muggle cell phones work, and I remembered that Hermione used a Protean charm for our DA galleons last year. The galleons only worked one-way though, so I did some research and found a way to make it work both ways. Then I thought it’d be convenient if the ink changed colour once a message is sent, y’know so we don’t write something and then forget to actually send it over. Oh and I added a privacy charm, you’ll have to imprint your magical signature on yours before you can use it. That way nobody else will be able to read it.”
“It’s almost morning,” Harry said softly. “Narcissa will insist on breakfast.”
“I’m sorry, Harry, but I can not explain this to you, as much as I would like to. All I can say is that I assure you that this has nothing to do with you or your role in this war, and that I promise to reveal information that pertains to you immediately from now on. In fact, I was hoping to begin teaching you myself this year.”
She gently put a hand on his knee, reassuring him, “You can tell me anything, nobody else will hear, and I will not judge you for your fears.”
“Yes, I suppose that could be arranged,” he eventually answered. “Although you would need some sort of adult supervision, unless you would only want to teach younger years than your own. Have your O.W.L. results arrived yet?”
With as much disdain as he could, he went on, “It’s typical, though, that Dumbledore would give Golden Boy his own club. Apparently Saint Potter needs more minions. I bet he couldn’t handle teaching anyone who doesn’t worship the ground he walks on.”

I do hope that was enjoyable and I'd love some comments!
With practiced ease, he presented a complex mind to the Dark Lord, full with secrets, memories and fear of discovery of said secrets. It was all a fabrication, constantly updated to accomodate what the Dark Lord would want or need to see, should he ever decide to take a peak into Severus’ mind—like now. Severus showed him Dumbledore, complaining about difficulties to rally forces for the Order—a real memory, but taken out of context. He showed him complex potions he experimented with—again, real memories, but meaningless. It went on like this for a while, the Dark Lord’s probing and prodding reaching deeper into Severus’ mind, but still contained in his carefully constructed set of misleading truths. It was bound to be over soon, or so Severus hoped at least, as he felt his concentration slowly slip.
She narrowed her eyes at him, glanced down at her textbook, then pressed her lips into a thin line as she stubbornly continued to stir counter-clockwise only.
Snape frowned slightly, then stood and turned to Draco. “Would you mind?” he asked uncharacteristically softly.
—Harry was fairly sure there were fireworks going off, though it was difficult to tell with how colourful it all was. The right-hand window was covered with an equally colourful poster advertising
“Harry looks…well,” Molly admitted somewhat grudgingly. “Better than he usually does, at least, but is he eating enough? He forgets whole meals sometimes unless I remind him.”
“Yes,” he agreed softly.
Harry’s father. Merlin knows how many affairs she had.”
is a Death Eater,” Harry countered.
Harry chuckled and Draco felt the vibration of the sound through his entire body, spreading like the heat from glowing coals, warming him.
Harry was careful to keep his face completely neutral as he learnt about the friendship between his mother and Snape in their early Hogwarts years, their eventual falling out and the alleged goodbye right before she‘d married James; but his insides churned uncomfortably at the implications of it all. Snape himself didn’t say a word and kept his eyes on Remus, his jaw clenched tightly. When Remus finally fell silent, the tension at the table was palpable as everyone’s eyes swivelled to Harry.
“What’s the difference between ‘normal’ spells and healing magic, then?” he asked eventually. “I assumed if it is used for healing it would be healing magic.”
at that, it hadn’t taken him half as long as it should have. Merlin have mercy on him trying to parent that boy. The door opened slowly and Harry’s black-haired head peaked inside. He caught Remus’ eyes and a smile spread on his face. If he had been able to, Remus would’ve rolled his eyes. He also would’ve had to fight pretty hard to suppress a smile. Merlin have mercy on him. Opening the door further, Harry moved to slip inside the room, only to be held back by a pale hand around his wrist.
the boy two days ago, he shouldn’t have been surprised by how different he looked.
Severus laughed again. “They are certainly rather headstrong,” he agreed. “So, Bovin and Bricks? I don’t really see it, but I see neither with anyone else either. I say Yule, if even.”
“I’ll save your plate for later,” Narcissa replied.
—could be his son. He might have a son. He might be a father.
Instinctively, Harry jerked up and flung a locking charm at the door.

Harry gave him a rather weak smile, and Draco wished he could do
Walburga positively beamed. “Why, of course, child, how could I refuse? I will watch over you day and night, my sweet Cissy. No filth will dare speak to you!”
“What happens if you don’t go? Are you risking your position?”
Harry tried to catch his eyes again, but Draco kept his gaze stubbornly on the sheets.
“Explain what to me?”
“You could have said no,” Harry insisted.

Harry didn’t quite know where to start.
return to those green eyes after they’d been depressingly dull, full of sadness and tension for the past week.
“I think this is enough for today,” announced Dumbledore. “We shall continue to practice next time. For now, we must move on to the other purpose for these lessons.”
She shook her head again. “No, I do not. While I did grow up in a pure-blood household, I made certain acquaintances during my school years that thoroughly dismantled any blood-supremacist ideologies I’d picked up at home.”
Harry frowned. He absolutely didn’t feel like sitting at a dinner table in uncomfortable silence with three Slytherins, nor did he fancy spending an hour alone with Snape potentially invading his head.
“Is there a particular reason why you’re refusing to come—”
She gave an irritated huff and kept cutting the bean, trying to get it to release more juice. Harry ignored her and went over to stirring his potion; seven times counter-clockwise, one time clockwise, repeat. His potion turned a pale pink and he heard Hermione make an indignant noise next to him.
“What are you on about?” Draco demanded.
“No, not because of you. Never think that way, Harry!” Remus said heatedly. “Bellatrix killed Sirius, not you.”
He was talking himself into a rage, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. “And what about Potter? He’s your
“Right, but compared to you, my last experience with a man is far further in the past,” Severus argued, his hands wandering to Remus’ chest. “I barely remember the details, so perhaps it would be better if you—”
Nobody will ever dare to touch you again.”
“I recognise two of the covers, I remember studying those books myself, once,” Severus replied, the slightest smile tugging on his lips.
“Remus?”
“What do you mean, mate?” asked Ron, his voice shaking slightly.
Harry didn’t know what to do. He was still holding Narcissa, while at the same time fighting back tears and the impulse to throw himself into Severus’ arms. When Severus moved over to them and hesitantly put his arm around Harry’s shoulders he practically melted into the embrace and tears shot into his eyes, immediately spilling over his cheeks.
“Relax, Draco,” Harry was saying outside the door, “it’s Remus. And the potion is working, he knows who he is, he would never hurt me.”
“No, we’ve tested them a few times already,” said Harry, grinning widely now.
Severus sighed, took a bite, chewed slowly and washed it down with a sip of water before finally speaking up, “The Dark Lord has found a willing recruit at Hogwarts. There’s going to be a Death Eater among the student body, and I don’t know who it is.” Draco sucked in a sharp breath and Harry’s face darkened. “I tried to get him to tell me, pretending that I would help whoever it was, but he refused. He insisted that it would be best if I knew nothing, in case Albus Dumbledore decided to read my mind.” Severus scoffed. “As if Albus would ever resort to the methods of the Dark Lord.”
“How are you feeling?” Remus asked once Severus had a full plate of breakfast in front of him, eyeing him worriedly, despite looking rather worn out himself. Right, it had been the full moon. He took a bite of toast and warmth spread through his stomach, spurring him into eating faster.
Once he was gone, renewed silence fell over the group. Pansy was the one who eventually broke it by saying, “I wonder what he wants Blaise for.”
Draco frowned. He’d forgotten all about Granger and the Weasel.
Remus gave him a small smile and gestured towards the armchairs. Giving Remus another eye-roll, Harry resigned and settled down in one of the dark recliners, facing Remus expectantly.
“Hi Harry,” said Hermione after they’d settled down, “how have you been?” Something in her voice set Harry on edge.
Thanks to
The two could still be rather snarky with each other sometimes, that much was certainly true, but only minutes after some sharp banter, Remus would catch Draco simply staring at Harry as he read his book, as if nothing in the world was more interesting than watching Harry read. Vice versa, Remus had found Harry to consistently stare after Draco whenever he went anywhere.
Severus gave a curt nod, then stood. “I have an errand to run, but I will make sure to be back before then.”
He got off his bed and leisurely made his way down to the kitchen. He wanted sweets. Lupin and Severus were sat at the table talking quietly, glancing up warily when Draco walked in. After plundering the pantry by grabbing the last piece of chocolate, he lazily went back upstairs.
“Don’t be, I know you didn’t mean it. We planned it, for Merlin’s sake! You can’t feel bad every time we have to do this,” said Draco resolutely. “Your acting is getting better.”
Harry’s eyes hardened, and suddenly he looked much older.
Harry’s brows furrowed.
“No, three galleons and seven sickles or put it back where you found it.”
“You have every right to be angry at me for that, to hate me for it, but please don’t make me leave. Ever since I learnt what conclusion the Dark Lord had come to upon hearing that prophecy, I’ve been trying to make up for my mistake of telling him. I swore an oath to Albus to spy and fight for the Order, to do anything it takes to take the Dark Lord down, and I’ve made good on that promise so far. I intend to keep doing so.” A bitter laugh escaped him. “After all these years, I don’t think there’s anything left that would beat the horrible things I’ve already done. I don’t have any reason to refuse anything that Albus asks of me.”
“You’re telling me that Dumbledore sent Malfoy to live
“Can you trust me when I say that
“Thank you, Harry. Where’s Severus?”
His eyes were still bright green, he noted with relief. It was his one connection to his mother and he’d loathe to lose his only resemblance to her. Almost everything else about his face was different, though. Sharper. His cheekbones were high, his jaw was much more pronounced than he remembered. His nose was different, too, although only slightly—maybe a little straighter. He felt like he’d seen that nose before, but he couldn’t pinpoint where. His hair, however, was by far the most pronounced change. Whereas it had been perpetually messy before, it now fell in soft waves, shining deep black.
He felt a faint blush rise on his cheeks at the veiled compliment.
“I will inform Minerva; you have my word.”
“Yes?”
“Good,” Draco huffed.
A knock on the door pulled him out of his thoughts.
Draco was fairly sure he was going insane. How long could it possibly take to get from the headmaster’s office to the seventh floor?
“I’m so sorry, Harry.”
“How about we go back to your room and you tell me about it?” Draco suggested, getting to his feet and pulling Harry up with him. Harry nodded mutely and moved ahead of Draco to open the hidden door.
Harry sank into his spot at the head of the table with a small grin on his face, before whispering something to Draco that made the Slytherin’s neutral mask slip for a second and give way to a flicker of surprise, followed by amusement. Draco seemed much more at ease now that Harry was with him again. Severus could relate to the sentiment—he was glad to stay close to Remus who acted as somewhat of a buffer between him and any potential hostility from former or current students, or from Molly Weasley who was periodically sending him glares that he assumed were supposed to be subtle.
“Absolutely. If you want it as well, of course.”
Draco moaned, trying to latch onto Harry’s neck in return, but Harry still had their hands firmly pressed down to the bed and he moved just too far for Draco to reach. Indignation warred with arousal on Draco’s face for a moment, then he whined, “Harry, please.”
Draco’s hand began to move and Harry had to remind himself to breathe, to stay aware. Relying fully on his experiences from wanking, he started to move as well and Draco let out a broken moan.
be mad at me if I break those wards and come sit with you.”
“Narcissa Malfoy,” Severus replied, watching her reaction closely. Minerva’s face betrayed nothing but mild surprise.
This time Harry managed to laugh as his tension drained away. This was Draco.
Here we are, Part 2 of this story is kicking off! For your convenience, I posted a
of Harry. Heat was pooling low in his abdomen and he felt his pants tighten. Somewhere in the back of his mind a whispering voice was warning him to slow down, to control himself lest he do something that’d ruin it all. He couldn’t focus enough to pay it any heed.
“Yeah, I mean it wasn’t. It isn’t. But the Malfoys—”

Remus nodded in acknowledgement and silence settled over the room again. Narcissa soon rose from the table and began to prepare lunch, calling Kreacher to help her. Severus barely noticed them, however, lost in his own thoughts. His mind kept swirling with hazy images of Harry’s face, the feeling of strong, pure magic pouring over him, driving out the burning pain in his body. He thought he could remember Harry’s voice, calling his name. He wished his memory was clearer.
Neville sighed and put a hand on Luna’s knee. “We
“How does that make any sense? You weren’t even friends when my mother died, and it’s not like you knew I was—” Harry didn’t finish his sentence. Ah, maybe Severus hadn’t thought this through as thoroughly as he had imagined.
Harry’s mood had taken such a drastic turn, Draco had been downright flabbergasted at first when Harry had
“What are you most afraid of could happen?”
“I’m sore, tired and rather hungry, but otherwise I feel surprisingly well. What happened? My memory is somewhat…foggy.”
already!”
“Naturally,” Draco shot back and plopped down onto the sofa next to Harry.
I hope you enjoyed that and again I'd love to hear your thoughts.
“Yes, well, it’s annoying. But we got two vials of Felix Felicis out of his class, so that’s neat.”
“So,” he said, “tell me everything.”
Minerva and Severus had a long-standing tradition of meeting in the staff lounge every Friday evening to have a glass of firewhisky and complain about the students, workload, and occasionally even other staff members or personal matters. Over the years they’d grown quite close, and Severus appreciated the insight his former professor could provide. Perhaps it wouldn’t be so wrong to talk to Minerva about his observations.
“Good thing he’s not Molly then, right?” retorted Harry.
Harry had to stop himself from snorting. Was she
, because I don’t know what to think. I’m kinda growing to like him, and I guess I’ve forgiven him for most of our history, but I’m not sure if any of it is happening for the right reasons. Or what the right reasons even are. And it all confuses me to no end, but I thought I had time to figure it out, except he almost

to have happened, logically.  Perhaps even grammatically. And yet here they are, frozen like statues, mid-argument with their wands half-drawn.
Just as Harry opened his mouth to reply, Ron’s face darkened and he added, “It’s because you were surrounded by Slytherins all summer, they’re far too comfortable with things like that.”
Yeah, he was definitely not leaving this room again. Ever. Or at least not until they went back to Hogwarts. He groaned again.
“Naturally. So, how long?”
“Decent enough. How are you?”
“Hello, Harry,” Severus answered with a smile.
Harry furrowed his brows, then startled when a boy’s head popped up from beneath the seats, facing away from Harry as he said, “What?”
“I’m serious! This isn’t a game, how can we be sure he won’t run to You-Know-Who as soon as he gets the chance? For real, Harry, how can you—”
The sound conjured images that made Draco’s breath hitch. Memories of smooth skin and half-lidded eyes, and it was more instinct than choice to lean down and cover Harry’s mouth with a kiss.
Sirona followed his gaze and hissed appreciatively. “
me to be his father, I won’t turn my back on him again. I’m not saying I’ll be perfect, I’m expecting to make many, many mistakes, but none of them will involve abandoning him on purpose.”
Their faces were only inches apart and Draco was passively aware of the odd symmetry of the situation. Potter’s eyes were scorching and Draco couldn’t look away, as the energy between them seemed to shift drastically. And Potter wasn’t fighting him.
“No! What if they can’t accept it, if they don’t believe that I’m sorry, that I’ve changed—am changing? What if they make you choose?” Draco sat up, pulling his hands away from Harry’s, staring at him with a somewhat frantic expression. “What if it’s them or me?” he whispered, and the mask dropped completely, revealing just how afraid Draco really was.
“Yes, we have in fact,” Severus retorted, his voice going silky like it did when he was reprimanding students. “He inquired about Harry, and whether there were any new revelations regarding his parentage. I told him that the mystery has been solved.”
Snape sighed heavily. “I am aware that our relationship thus far has been…less than ideal. I recognise that I am largely at fault for that, and I wish to apologise for my behaviour in the past, although I do have viable reasons for some of it. If— I do hope to— I never imagined I could be a father, but now that I am I want to live up to that title. If you never see me that way, I’ll understand, but— I— I hope one day you will be willing to listen to all my reasons at least.”
Harry chuckled. He shouldn’t have expected a baby snake to give too elaborate of an answer to that question. Nevertheless, her answer reminded him that feeling good could come from simple things. Things like— He looked up at Draco to find the Slytherin staring at him, his mouth hanging slightly open.
“Two days ago? I was out for two whole days?”
The sound of voices pulled Remus back into the present. Harry must’ve returned. Checking the clock, Remus noted that the three had been gone for over four hours. With a smile, he put away his book and went downstairs.
2. Remus and Severus talking about the nature of their relationship.
Draco watched Potter disappear into the drawing room. Again. He wondered what could possibly be so interesting about it for Potter to repeatedly spend hours on end in there. Not that he cared what Potter was doing, he simply wanted to know what kind of house he lived in. Although his mother had assured him that he’d visited the place as a child, he couldn’t remember a thing about it. He honestly didn’t remember much of his childhood in general. Just bland template memories of the Manor, silent dinners and occasional playdates with Greg and Vince.
“Saturday?”
“Vulnera Sanentur?” he asked, looking for confirmation.
“Alright, alright.” Harry shot him a last smile and disappeared through the open door.
“Shit,” muttered Remus. He reached out to grab his wand and spelled Severus’ shirt, waistcoat and robes on and closed again. “Go.”
Draco kissed him, because
“Oh please, I’ve known you your entire life, Draco. Ever since you met Harry at Hogwarts five years ago, all you talked about was Potter here, Potter there.”
Ron looked aghast. “Of course not!”
figured that the wounds must be cursed, even if not all of them in the same way. There were spells to treat cursed wounds in one of those books I was reading, so I summoned it and started looking for something that might work to remove the residual magic from the cuts. I found a form that did pretty much that, so I tried it and it worked.”
“It’s alright. Really, Mrs— er, Molly. Remus is looking out for me and Narcissa and Draco, too. I
“We thought the
He wasn’t alone anymore. He had a family. He even had an actual father just downstairs, tending to—
The letter from Hermione—besides her understandably shocked reaction at the news about James—informed him of the mountain of homework he’d have to complete over the summer. To his surprise he found himself quite interested in most of it. It was even fun to research some complicated antidote for a potion’s essay, although he’d never have admitted that in front of Snape.
He’d almost made it without encountering anyone, when the door to the smaller bathroom on the third floor opened and he found himself standing right in front of Draco Malfoy. A half-naked Draco Malfoy at that. He’d apparently taken a shower, judging by his still damp hair and the steam that rolled out of the bathroom behind him, as he stood there in nothing but his pyjama bottoms.
Severus eyed the bottle of mint green liquid Draco had given him with mixed feelings. While the boy seemed awfully sure that this concoction was the solution to Severus’ perpetually greasy hair, Severus himself wasn’t sure what to think of it, given that Draco had
mind rather than the other way around.”
“I will continue Transfiguration, Potions, Charms, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, Defence and Herbology,” replied Draco.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, see you later then, Draco, I’m going to dinner,” says Blaise and Draco startles. He’d forgotten Blaise was there.
“Perhaps they will do so more quickly if you do not provide them with such delicious dramatics to begin with. You have found a rather spectacular way to spend time with your father I’ve heard.”
“I suspect Draco took it, he never could help his sweet tooth. Why?”
Hermione cleared her throat and, shooting Ron a warning look, bluntly changed the topic. “I wonder what Dumbledore is going to teach you.”
Severus found himself cursing Lily for her talent with charms. Maybe he would’ve seen, would’ve found out earlier, would’ve had more time with Harry before a full-blown war was upon them.
Severus thought his idea over, muttering under his breath, “Yes, that’ll work. Grimmauld can hold four people, easily. And Narcissa would feel at home. I only have to convince the Order to let them stay—”
“If you’re all quite finished, I’d like to know what you intend to do about this, Albus,” Severus interrupted, unwilling to endure the back and forth any longer. “The boy is obviously changed, but still recognisable. Whoever sees him will realise that he is not James Potter’s son, all they had in common before has disappeared. I do not believe it would be wise to announce this news too widely just yet, especially after what happened at the Ministry.”
They stepped into the shop and Harry felt a little overwhelmed by…everything. The inside was pure mayhem of jumbled sounds, colours and movement. And it was
“Yeah. We’ll do our best, promise,” he said, though his tone was somewhat grudging.
Harry sighed, not feeling particularly inclined to bare all his thoughts to Snape. “I tried to stay focused on my breath, as you told me to, sir,” he said, hoping that maybe Snape would be satisfied with a partial truth.
“You won’t even be able to communicate with each other, or were you planning on sending each other owls across the Great Hall?” Hermione went on undeterred.
Harry nodded. “That’s the assumption, yes.”
“Come on, Ron,” she murmured, giving him a stern look.
He shrugged again. “I don’t think about it too much to be honest.”
Albus cleared his throat and the noise in the hall slowly died down.
in there!” Draco’s voice hissed, sounding surprisingly worried. And angry. Remus turned his ears towards the door, intrigued. He had noticed that the boys had begun to treat each other more civilly, but Draco
“Would I ever not listen to you?” he retorted sweetly.
The tears he’d been trying to hold back spilled over Harry’s face. All he managed was a shaky nod before the first sob escaped his throat and his composure broke.
Severus blinked.
Harry doubled up on the muffling charm before he gave them a brief retelling of the memory and the Legilimency lesson. As expected, Hermione’s reaction to Harry’s success with Legilimency was an exaggerated version of Draco’s: shocked disbelief. It took him fifteen minutes to convince her that he had merely been lucky to know this kind of magic from healing. Eventually, she gave it a rest and started to pick Bob Ogden’s memory apart instead.
Hermione fell silent, looking thoughtful. Harry felt increasingly uncomfortable under her scrutiny and almost breathed a sigh of relief when a knock on the door saved him.
He glared at her. “Did I, really? You know as well as I do that this job was nothing more than a facade when I became a spy. I didn’t really have a choice.”
He flashed Draco a mischievous smile and saw Draco’s expression morph from stunned to almost predatory. The impression was only reinforced by the way Draco prowled across the room and climbed up unto the bed, taking the book out of Harry’s hands and throwing it carelessly on the bedside table, as he came to hover above him.
The memory made his head spin again slightly.

“It’s an invitation to have lunch in compartment C,” he replied, “from a certain Professor Slughorn.” He looked up at the group. “Anyone know who that’s supposed to be?”
The thought kept echoing through his head. After what felt like hours, he pulled away to wipe his face. Cautiously, he glanced over at Severus and found him looking back at him, giving him an uncharacteristically shy smile. The weight that had settled on his chest since the day after his birthday finally lifted, and Harry felt a wide grin spread on his face.
Kreacher bowed again before he disappeared. It didn’t take him long to bring the books Harry had requested, and Harry dismissed him again. He was happier around Narcissa, and Harry was content to let her be the main person to interact with the elf. It suited everyone best.
“No, go on. Speak your mind while we’re at it, because I’d rather not bring the subject up again and again. Say what you have to say,” Harry challenged, opening his arms in invitation.
Harry crouched down next to him, grinning broadly.
Remus smiled and said mischievously, “Leave that to me, cub. Would you like to join, Draco?”

of the stairs to their floor that would warn him if someone passed it. Remus had never been more glad about Severus’ tendency for mild paranoia.
He trailed off and Harry had to laugh. Remus could be such a Ravenclaw sometimes.
“I haven’t quite forgiven you yet,” Remus insisted, and Severus grimaced slightly. A smirk spread on Remus’ face as he added, “But there’s something you could do that might make me forgive you faster.”
like a fucking incantation. He leaned forward, pressing a comparably chaste kiss to those unreasonably soft lips, and something clicked in his mind. Letting out a shaky breath as he drew back, he stared into those green eyes trying to gather his courage.
He scanned the terrain from his little hill. It was almost bigger than the backyard at Grimmauld Place — not that that had been huge to begin with, but it was still baffling to think that they were not actually outside.
speak to you again. That doesn’t mean I’m not furious, but it means I’ll most likely calm down eventually.”
take the last dose before the full moon that night.
Hermione bit her lip and Ron blushed rather furiously.
“Only the robes, don’t worry.”
Draco followed him without any resistance, still a little dazed from all the making out. Only when they were about to reach the third floor—their floor—did Draco’s mind snap back into attention.
Remus sighed heavily.
Despite the somewhat incredulous look on her face, Narcissa didn’t hesitate to comply and began to unbutton Severus’ robes, while Harry continued to visualise the form he was about to cast. It was fairly straightforward. The form was designed to rid wounds of curse-traces that could interfere with conventional healing spells, given that the curse was located in the wound itself and not deeper inside the body. Not a healing form per se, but perfect for their current issue—that the cuts wouldn’t heal because they held residual dark magic.
All his life he’d wanted nothing more than his father’s approval. He’d never even gotten as much as a simple acknowledgement of his impeccable grades.
Slughorn glanced back and forth nervously between them.
When Harry awoke in his new room at Grimmauld Place for the second time, the sun was already high in the sky. He blinked dazedly against the light, groping for his glasses. When he’d finally found them and slid them on, he frowned.
Severus gestured his permission and got out of his chair. It would be impolite to stay seated if he could not offer a seat to his guest. Lupin closed the door behind him as he stepped into the room. He looked tired and worried.
“I can appreciate aesthetics, doesn’t mean I want to bugger him.”
Harry laughed softly, running his free hand up and down Draco’s back as he simply continued to stare in wonder at the man in his arms. Even though Harry never even looked away, when Draco lifted his head again Harry’s breath caught anew and he felt an overwhelming wave of emotion rise in him.
When he returned to the living room, Malfoy stood on the couch with his white socks against its gray cotton. He repositioned a sketch of the moon, tilting his head.
This moment felt like a gentle, delicate thing – something he did not want to let go of yet.
, he had said once.
Harry bit his hand, focusing on the grip.
In the haze of his drunkenness, he let himself want it. His fingers dipped beneath the band of his boxers. He jumped at his own touch, clutching at the sheets. Harry thought of the hand, tight over Malfoy’s shoulder. In that moment, he wanted it to his hand. His lips creating those two love bites. Slowly, he grasped the base of his cock, feeling it throb. Pleasure rushing through his body.
He scrunched his nose at her. Granger was rarely wrong, but this was definitely one of those times. His body could handle a couple of all-nighters. His insomnia sure thought so.
Malfoy said something Harry managed to get the end of. “...flour? I wasn’t lying about the banana bread, you know.”
Ron just laughed and stole the beer in his hands. “Happy Birthday, mate!”
Guilt stabbed at Harry, wanting to take it back. They had an easy time like this, not asking hard questions and pretending things it could be like that forever. “I didn’t mean…”
Potter shrugged helplessly, rubbing at the red mark on his forehead. On his scar. Draco suddenly felt like he crossed a very intimate line.
“Malfoy, what are you doing here?”
And Harry archived that moment in his head, tucking it into the corner of his mind.
Harry, who had closed his eyes to regulate his breathing, opened one at Draco. “Constellations?”
Harry nodded, relieved, willing for the moment to pass.
“Draco.” The name slipped out clumsily.
Parkinson waved back for the both of them.
“If you’re…erm…busy,” Ron coughed. “…‘Mione mentioned something about this but…I didn’t think-”
“What?!” Ron screamed. In the background, dishes crashed together.
Draco scoffed, rose coloring his cheeks, “Haven’t you heard? Gays are dramatic. Keep up.”
When he told Malfoy about it, he gave him a blank stare and shook his head. He left the kitchen and returned with a small, silver key.
“Mate,” Harry said, reflexively, positioning himself in front of Malfoy. “You have a sunburn.”
there before. But there was no mistaking that voice – its distinct rasp had wormed its way into his memory a long time ago.
Draco pulled back, and gave him a blank stare. His lips were red and bruised.
It didn’t hurt as much Harry thought it would. He mostly focused on the feeling of Draco’s hands against his back instead of the vibration.
“What? …Yeah,” Harry replied, re-focusing. “I demand one slice as payment.”
Excited, Harry got up and looked in the big mirror on the wall. Draco held up a smaller mirror, reflecting the image onto the big one.
“Yeah.”
“Merlin, you have so many plants,” he muttered, looking around the apartment. That was accurate. After Hermione had given him one, Neville was inspired to give him another. And then Ron. And Ginny. And Luna. And the rest of his friends until his apartment was filled with little, green plants.
Eying the banana bread, he gestured for Malfoy to sit down while he turned back to the stove. He prepared two omelets, eager to not owe Malfoy anything.
“I just like taking care of things,” Harry explained, because it was true.
For some reason, Harry flushed. “And the non-magic part?”
Well, Malfoy is smoking, exhaling large puffs every now and again. It seemed to ease his fear of heights since his hands no longer clutched at imaginary handholds of the wall. He didn’t even need the wall anymore. They both faced the skyline, rather than each other – shoulders squished together instead of knees. It was better this way, not having to meet Malfoy’s eyes.
“I have a-”
For the last few weeks, breakfast was pitiful thing – mediocre tea, lukewarm from neglect. But today was different; he was going to have
“What?” Harry stammered, feeling caught. “I-I wasn’t looking.”
“I’m sorry,” said another voice. He turned around. It was Potter, dressed in a patchy sweater instead of the Hogwarts robe. They were in the bathroom, mirrors everywhere. Draco’s chest felt wet. He looked down to find the blood coming out of his chest. Potter looked at him, green eyes cold, “Just kidding. Why would anyone want to be your friend?”
“What?”
“We’ve spent every warm morning on your balcony.”
“G’morning, Parkinson,” he mumbled. She offered a wave in return.
“It’s barely begun!” Ron beamed, throwing an arm across Harry’s shoulders. His happiness was infectious.
He ignored the instinct to jump up, “Don’t you have other things to do than sneak up on me?”
Then, Draco was quiet, admiring his work. His finger traced Harry’s shoulder, slowly. “It’s done.”
“It smells good,” Draco said. He placed it in his mouth and
He was wearing a different outfit than the morning - white sneakers, white trousers and a white button-down. It was stupid, even it fit him well. He left the door open behind him, so Harry followed along, suspiciously feeling like he was entering a haunted house.
“What?”
Malfoy had taken the Dark Mark, but that wasn’t what Harry was going to ask. He wanted to ask about the curling rope of scar tissue across his chest.
“Let’s just admit I’m right,” she drawled. Harry marveled at how she looked so put-together in just an oversized jumper and leggings.
Malfoy stiffened.
He was probably in love. (Never mind the consequences). Check.
July was ending. His birthday was coming up, planned to be a joint celebration with Neville. Everyone and their friends were invited.
Surprisingly, he was offered a hand.
with my hair, making banana bread and doing things in a painfully slow way.”
Painstakingly, he made the long journey from his room the kitchen and sat at the table, where everything felt too bright. But the kitchen smelled delicious.
“You do them at home!?”
He tried to remember that it made sense for him to move out. She had the apartment first. He needed to be closer to the Foundation. It was
Harry found his voice. “No! No, I am not!! Doing nothing at all!”
“Are you sure you want me to choose?” Draco looked at him, eagerly. The brightness in his eyes quickly becoming one of Harry’s favorite things.
As Ron described his hangover, Harry stabbed his fork into it, determined not to enjoy it. But, his taste buds betrayed him. The bread melted in his mouth, a complementary combination of sweet and rich. And there were chocolate chips!
“You dream about me?” Malfoy quipped, raising an eyebrow. He did that annoying thing of closing off his face, making it impossible to read.
“I’m done,” he said, shaking the sketchbook, careful to hold the image out of sight.
Malfoy rolled his eyes instead of responding. In silence, they gathered his clothes quickly, placing the baskets side by side. During this time, Harry thought of one thousand reasons that Malfoy should move out, but one stood above the rest.
It took up most of the living room wall, opposite the Floo, filled with moving photos and sketches. Some were connected with red string. According to the years pinned up, they seemed to make up a timeline. Next to them, meticulous notes or printed articles. Harry squinted. The font seemed familiar for some reason. He glanced at the sketches, trying to find the connection. But instead, he was caught by their beauty. The subjects weren’t one thing particularly, but each had the same feel: so precise, lovely and
A snort came from behind him. “Alright there, Potter?”
Their breakup had left him soft and tender. He missed his friend so much it hurt, but they deserved this: to be happy,
“Quite in sync, aren’t we?” she asked.
The silence from the other end of the door was enough of an answer.
“You have a home in others...which is good because we all need our support systems,” she said, gray eyes boring into him. “But how do you feel when you are alone, Harry? Do you feel safe? Loved?”
At the end of the story, Draco snuggled sweetly into his neck. Nothing could compare to the affection that rushed through him.
“A glorified windowsill?”
Their friendship circle had grown within the last few years, surprised at the even amounts of new and old faces. Old faces included Slytherins now, Harry thought, noting the presence of Parkinson and Zabini. He wondered if the silent ban was lifted once he started talking to Malfoy, wondered how much Hermione knew.
“I think I get it,” Harry bit the inside of his cheek. “Everyone expected me to be Auror, doing what I did, for the rest of my life.”
Tears stung at his eyes, an emotion swelling in his heart that got caught in his throat.
“But I didn’t,” he confirmed. “And I love what I do, Skeeter’s opinion be damned.”
The first time he woke up, he was covered in sweat, his mouth dry. There was a glass of water and Sleeping Draught on his bedside table. And in that moment, he was so glad he basically forced Potter to be his roommate. He downed the glass of water, then the draught and was out before his head hit the pillow.
“I can’t do it, okay!?”
“Yes, but balconies have
“Yes, that’s definitely who I am,” she said, her voice lowering an octave. “I am not only super vague, but I have an
“Photography?”
He was also stupidly well-dressed, in a white tee and black joggers.
Harry frowned and helped himself up instead. The helping hand hung awkwardly in the air before returning to the man’s side again.
The rain beat against the concrete of the balcony. A slight breeze sprayed a drizzle of raindrops on Harry’s face. He looked at the city below. It was still beautiful view – the vast expanse of clouds shrouding the city in mist and rain. It would have brought a sense of calm, Harry thinks, if he weren’t already soaked.
And froze.
! Why in Circe, Merlin and Dumbledore’s name do you like it here?”
Something on the table caught Malfoy’s eye. He plopped onto the couch, grabbing it for closer inspection.
He nodded, surprised by how much he meant it. And happily, spent the rest of the time split between staring outside (the moon was full) and staring at Draco. He looked peaceful, no scrunched eyebrows or angry wrinkles, just light in his eyes.
“It’s okay,” Draco said, a brilliant blush on his neck. “Just cold.”
On his left shoulder, there were two deer. A buck and doe chasing each other in circular pattern. The doe eventually paused, letting the buck catch up with her and they began to nuzzle each other.
Draco had a nasty headache the whole day. It started as something small and simply irritating, but gradually grew into a monstrous bitch. By the time he was headed home, he considered seeing a Healer and checking for brain cancer.
Potter grinned, “Can’t have my landlord dying on me.”
wandlessly, but not an
It was going to rain. That’s why he couldn’t run today. Nothing to do with the beers he had at the Burrow last night. He nuzzled into his pillow, sinking into the safety of sleep.
