"That's none of your business, Malfoy," the boy managed to reply. The blush on his cheeks darkened. Draco smirked. "Well, Potter, I-"
Harry was very conflicted. A copy of last week's Daily Prophet was lying on the bedside table in the room he shared with Ron at the Burrow. He had been staying there for only a week. After the war, he went to Grimmauld Place and cried for a solid day. Then, pulling himself together and pushing all thoughts of the war to the dark, dusty corners of his mind, he threw himself into cleaning the old house. He dusted the rooms, cleared out the Doxy infestations, dealt with the numerous boggarts, demolished a spider nest (Ron would have been petrified), found all the Dark Artifacts and dumped them in a spare room to deal with later, and catalogued all the missing heirlooms he could remember (Kreacher helped) so he could confront Mundungus about it later.
"Potter! You had one simple job! What, did you not get enough sleep last night? Is your brain too tired to even complete this simple task? Or are you just that incompetent?" Draco snarled at him. He hadn't noticed the bags under Potter's eyes until that moment, but he realized that what he said might have held some truth.
He glanced at the title: Crown Prince Still Missing: Nationwide Search Goes On. Draco scoffed. The matters of muggles were nothing to him. He faintly recalled, however, that there was no crown prince; the royal family only had daughters. Maybe he was remembering it wrong. In any case, it didn't matter to him.
Blaise and Pansy exchanged helpless looks.
Malfoy cleared his throat. "You're awake," he stated. Harry nodded awkwardly. "Are you feeling better?" Malfoy asked him, sounding strangely concerned. Harry was confused. Why was Malfoy asking him if he was okay when Harry was the one who had attacked him so viciously without reason?
"So why didn't you come over to me? I know you were looking at me a lot, don't deny it," Draco said coolly.
"Fine!" Harry exclaimed. "If you aren't nice to each other, I'll kiss Ron."
——————————————————
"-and so I came here to talk to you because I have no idea what to do." Hermione didn't look the least bit surprised. "Well, did you enjoy it? Or were you uncomfortable?"
Harry narrowed his eyes at him, then glanced at the chessboard. The pieces were oddly quiet, for once not shouting out nonsensical 'advice.' Maybe they sensed the skill of both players involved. Harry once again lifted his eyes to scrutinize Draco's now falsely innocent expression.
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco noticed two familiar figures walking into the Great Hall. He glanced over to see both Potter and the Weasel looking straight at him. The Weasel started snickering and poking Potter, saying something to him and laughing. Draco might have thought they were making fun of him, except that Potter, quite differently from the Weasel, immediately blushed and looked away. How positively interesting.
The door opened. The Auror that had been in charge of making sure he didn't run away came in. His name was something like Kachamba. Kachumbar? Kachamblur? He was a big man, portly, but surprisingly fast. He had his wand out and ready to cast in case Draco decided to make a break for it. "It's time," was all he said, in his oddly squeaky voice that really was not at all suited for an Auror.
"You became an animagus?" the Auror asked.
When Harry asked him to read over the paragraph he had just written, Draco casually rested his arm on the back of Harry's chair and scooted closer, all under the pretense of trying to see what he had written. As he leaned forwards, Harry's breath ghosted over his face, and he suddenly found that the other boy's lips were far too close. Draco's breath caught as he turned, eyes immediately drawn to Harry's. They were greener than any forest he'd ever seen, but the iris was mostly hidden by his dilated pupils. Harry was staring right back at Draco, and Draco's heart raced. Almost without conscious thought, his eyes dropped to stare at those perfectly shaped pink lips. His eyes flickered back up to see that Harry was looking at his lips too. Draco swallowed hard.
"So, you still like girls?" She asked him. Harry nodded. "I just also like blokes too now. I did love Ginny for a bit, but now I just love her like a sister." Hermione smiled. "I'm so happy for you, Harry. Is there anyone in particular who made you realize this?" Harry shifted again. "About that..." he trailed off.
"It is time for us to return," McGonagall said as if reading his mind. "We can await Mr. Malfoy there if you are right; otherwise, we will let the Aurors find him. Put your mind at rest, Mr. Potter, he is no longer in immediate danger."
Narcissa Malfoy
"See?" Draco said. "Eating."
Draco resolved to do as his mother asked of him. He was worried for her. This would be her first year completely alone, so if there was anything he could do to make her feel better, he would do it without reservations.
"Then I hereby declare Lucius Abraxas Malfoy guilty of murder, torture, conspiring with He-who-shall-not-be-named to commit the mass genocide of muggles and muggleborns, and crimes against Wizard-kind. He is hereby sentenced to life in Azkaban and must pay a sum equal to one-quarter his fortune to charities dedicated to rebuilding damages caused by the war. This trial is hereby over. Auror Karachuma, take Mr. Malfoy back to his holding cell, where he may await the results of the trials of his wife and son before being sent to Azkaban."
Their Charms class went by exceedingly slowly. Flitwick was trying to teach them Charm theory, which was highly complex and challenging to master. Draco understood why it might help improve their casting - knowing why something worked always helped him do it better - but a small part of him also thought that waving their wands wildly around without having a clue as to what that did had never yet failed them.
"I...oh sod it. Fuck space." Harry couldn't wait a moment longer. His tipped forwards, and his lips crashed into Draco's, and suddenly Harry found himself kissing Draco Malfoy for the second time ever. Third, if you counted his dream.
Potter did not look at him or his mother. He merely laced his hands together and stood there, waiting for the murmurs to stop. The Chief Warlock looked distinctly uncomfortable, but having already given his permission, he could do nothing but allow Potter to testify. "You may take the stand, Mr. Potter," he said, sighing and rubbing his temples.
Dear Mrs. Malfoy,
"I hate Potter," Draco announced.
Draco had been watching him intently. "I did do something," he accused when he saw Harry's complicated expression. The guilty look that followed was enough to ensure Draco that he was correct. Draco groaned, letting his head fall back. "What did I do? Please tell me!" He begged Harry.
After a few hours, he made his way back to the common room. Casting a quick tempus, he discovered that it was nearly three 'o clock in the morning. He snuck quietly back to his room and chucked the map and cloak in his trunk before falling on top of his bed and immediately succumbing to slumber.
Malfoy just sighed. "You do think that, don't you?" Harry asked angrily. Malfoy appeared startled at his sudden change of attitude.
"What rumors?" Harry asked bewilderedly. He hadn't heard any rumors.
"How can you not know where he is?" Wilson yelled.
"Just forget I said anything," Potter said after a minute of silence. Draco shook himself. "No, Potter, I just...didn't expect that. Thank you." Potter nodded, still looking away, twirling the vial between his fingers. Draco was afraid he would drop it, so he gently plucked it from the other boy's hand, setting it back down on the table. Potter jumped when their fingers brushed together. Draco fought down annoyance at Potter's unwillingness for Draco to touch him, even just a little bit. The rest of the class passed with neither of them looking at the other.
"Harry, what in Merlin's name were you thinking? You could have been seriously hurt! Honestly, if you were going to be this distracted the whole bloody time, I wouldn't have agreed to this." Draco huffed angrily. Harry tried to look apologetic but was very distracted by Draco's lean body stretched out on top of his. Draco continued his rant, scowling at Harry the entire time.
Only a few stragglers meekly raised their hands, undoubtedly only those who thought Lucius Malfoy could somehow punish them from prison.
Harry laughed. "Nothing. It's nothing."
"I will come," McGonagall said, curtly.
The breathing stopped for a moment before Draco heard a whooshing sound that he took to be Harry whipping off his cloak. Draco opened his eyes, smirking in triumph, and turned to see the Gryffindor looking very sheepish and slightly miffed.
Draco rolled his eyes and pulled Pansy away. When they were in a somewhat secluded area of the common room, she gave him a searching look and asked quietly, "Will you be alright?"
"What?" Draco asked suspiciously.
——————————————————
"Tell me, Mr. Malfoy, what class did you have this morning?" Madam Pomfrey asked, and Draco was thankful that she appeared to have believed him. "Potions," he answered quickly. She nodded. "And could you tell me what potion you were working on?"
Malfoy looked up and immediately caught his eye. The grey gaze locked on his for a second, then the Slytherin was looking at anything but him. Harry's scowl deepened. Malfoy was acting suspiciously. Harry decided that today was the day to follow him and see what he was up to. The moment the Slytherin finished eating, Harry turned to Ron and Hermione.
Harry jerked his hand back in surprise. He turned to face Draco. The blond was looking at him blankly, eyes wild and slightly unfocused.
"Could you help Draco over to your dorm? He's a bit more drunk than he usually gets. Could you just help guide him to your room, make sure he lies down? It would be a huge help." Blaise gave him a pleading look, laying it on a bit thick. Damn, Draco would have to get Blaise a fucking fruit basket for that. Though, to be honest, Blaise probably had less than benevolent intentions, Draco thought, eyeing Longbottom.
Potter raised his eyebrow at this. "However glad I am to see that the Ministry is so determined to follow the rules, I must say that this trial would be unfairly judged without my information. It is crucial to the proceedings." He cocked his head, his eyes gaining a calculating look. "The Ministry has a history with unfair trials, I might add. My godfather, Sirius Black, did not even get a trial. And my own trial two years ago was very clearly weighed against me. It would be rather...unfortunate...if the Ministry were to repeat old mistakes."
Harry wasn't entirely sure why Parkinson was sitting down next to him. He would have written it off as coincidence, except that she was looking right at him.
It was the first time they had spoken of the trial since it had ended. Harry recoiled at Malfoy's harsh words. "So you think I was an idiot for defending you? You think I just woke up that morning and decided, 'Oh, you know what, I'm feeling particularly glorious this fine morning! Malfoy's trial is today, you say? Maybe I should go there and spout some nonsense about what a great person he really is!'" Harry said, adopting a high, mocking voice. "Do you think I just go around flippantly change people's fates because I feel like it?" Harry was absolutely furious.
He turned to Pansy. She was smirking at him. He knew exactly what she was so pleased about, but he gave her a look that plainly said, not here. So instead, he asked her, "Who are you with?"
Ron clapped him on the shoulder. "Come on, mate," he said cheerily. "Wouldn't want to miss breakfast!"
God, Potter. From the beginning, the infuriating man had stolen everything that should have been his. The friends, the admirers, the fame, the money, the attention, the adoration, his dream job, and his happiness. They could have shared it, done it all together. If only Potter had taken his hand in first year, everything would have been right. God, he was so pathetic.
"It's possible," the other whispered back, "better try to calm him down before he explodes."
When winter hols finally arrived, it was bittersweet. The last Christmas at Hogwarts and he wouldn't even be there. Harry had been particularly nostalgic the previous few days, smiling wistfully when the snow fell, and Hermione conjured a little blue flame in a jar. Instead of berating a couple of third years that charmed snowballs to hit the windows, he thought of years past and pelted Ron with a snowball of his own. Of course, he spent every available moment with Draco.
Walking home was exceedingly pleasant, which was why he insisted on doing it every day, even though Draco would rather he apparated. Harry whistled as he approached their little house, a two-story brick thing with plenty of room for the three of them.
Draco was impressed. By mentioning his godfather and himself, Potter was calling out the Ministry, in front of a great many witnesses. It would be unwise of them to try and kick him out now. He would have done well in Slytherin. Draco was surprised by the thought that flitted through his head. Potter was a Gryffindor of the highest order; there was no possibility of him being even the slightest bit Slytherin. Draco only wished that Potter hadn't grown quite so clever just as he was about to send them to jail.
A couple of days later, it was Saturday, and the 8th years were particularly excited. McGonagall had given them special permission to go out to Hogsmeade every weekend, and everyone intended to take full advantage of it. Harry, Hermione, and Ron were trudging down to the village. Ron was excited to see his brothers, who had recently bought Zonko's and turned it into a branch of their flourishing business.
Frowning, Harry allowed Draco to pull him towards the Slytherin table, as planned. Draco sat in his usual seat, which, Harry noticed, had one of the only uninterrupted views of where he usually sat. Harry sat next to Draco in Zabini's usual place. That prompted more looks and whispers than walking in with Draco had.
"Why didn't we just say I was sharing your bed?" Harry visibly cringed as he said that, and Draco almost didn't dignify it with a response.
The next morning, Harry woke up entirely exhausted. The nightmares were really too much. He didn't know how much longer he could survive them. Harry resolved to stay in bed until at least lunch.
Harry just scowled at both of them, not even fazed by their confusing manner of speech. The twins glanced at each other.
Harry huffed in annoyance. His eyes landed on the book. "Really, Draco? Transformation Magick for the Transfiguration Master? You hardly qualify as a Transfiguration Master." Draco scowled at him.
Harry cleared his throat and glared at Draco. "Er, yes. I'm supposed to ask you for my present...?" he trailed off questioningly.
Was getting a little bit mouldy.
About fifteen minutes later, someone tapped him on the shoulder. He turned to see Zabini, a very unusually tipsy Neville hanging onto his arm. Neville didn't drink most of the time, so what had happened to make him like this? Zabini looked only slightly annoyed.
Draco was pants at wandless magic, but he could manage a simple Lumos. It was weaker than what he usually achieved with his wand, but it was something. Whatever these dampeners were, they only affected wand magic.
"Righ' then." Hagrid straightened up. "Today, yer goin' to be feedin' these here flobberworms to the baby Horgwallows. They don' need much, a few fer each o' them'll do. Partner up, now. One of yeh will have to hold down the Horgwallow an' open its mouth. The other'll have to feed it the flobberworms one a' a time."
"Hello?" she said. "Yes, I am looking straight at a dragon right now. No, this is not a prank - I'm staring at it right now. It doesn't look like any animal I've seen before. Yes, I took a picture. Of course. Yeah, could you come as soon as possible? It doesn't look dangerous, but who knows. Yeah. Thanks." She said her goodbyes and brought the box back down.
Draco shook his head, an expression of exasperation on his face. "That's not even what I wanted to talk to you about," he protested. "I wanted to give you this." He pulled away from Harry, reaching for his bag and fishing around inside it. He emerged a few seconds later, triumphantly holding an opened envelope. Draco pulled out two pieces of parchment from inside, checking one briefly before handing the other to Harry. "It's from my mother," he clarified, catching Harry's questioning glance. Harry immediately opened the parchment, curiosity burning inside him. Why would Mrs. Malfoy write to him?
Draco scoffed. "Not that the idea of pranking the Gryffindors isn't appealing, but I'm almost positive we're still terrifying Slytherins in the eyes of all the other houses." Just then, a gaggle of 3rd-year girls walked by, whispering. When Draco glanced over at them, they broke into a fit of giggles, then ran away, glancing back at him every so often. Draco turned back to Blaise. "So what's the plan?"
"Again?" Harry asked in disbelief. "How do you always come in at the moment I start changing? Every time I get ready in the room instead of the bathroom, you manage to show up. It's uncanny!"
"Do you think he'll be annoyed that he was forced to teach potions again?" Ron whispered.
Harry looked around at his friends, peacefully comingling with his boyfriend and his friends, even though they had been at each other's throats for years, and thought back to McGonagall's speech at the beginning of the year. They indeed were paragons of house unity, and Harry felt indescribably proud.
Draco was quite enjoying lying on top of Harry. The black-haired boy was very comfortable and quite warm. It was all very nice until the prat decided to flip them over. Draco let out a very un-Malfoyish sound that he would most definitely later deny making. Then, Harry, the absolute tease, had leaned down and whispered, "You won" into his ear. And he had shivered. Shivered. He had lost every ounce of the Malfoy dignity in that moment.
"Why," Paul said, "you're quite right, little Sophia. Maria, I do believe you have a genius in the making right there." Sophia positively beamed with pride. Paul sighed. "Fine, we'll let it go. But we should stay here to make sure it doesn't cause any trouble while it's leaving."
Harry wandered around a bit, already having forgotten the way, and loitered in the halls admiring the decor. The Manor wasn't so bad, at least the parts of it that were unmarred by dark magic and darker memories. Eventually, he bumped into a house elf, who blinked at him in confusion, and Harry asked her to take him to Draco, which she did readily enough. Guest etiquette and all that.
Draco's throat closed up. The man he had been trying to kill had been worried about his soul. He suddenly had the urge to beg forgiveness from the dead headmaster. Harry squeezed his shoulder in sympathy before turning back to his book. Draco shook himself and stared blankly at his empty parchment.
Pansy rolled her eyes. Even Blaise seemed amused. "You do not look the same, darling. First of all, you almost definitely grew a few inches. Second, your hair is longer, and you stopped using so much of that horrid hair gel. And finally...well you just look incredibly hot, believe me. Potter will be positively drooling when he sees you."
"Try," Harry urged. "Ask me something I wouldn't want to tell you. Go on."
"Well she didn't break up with me! It was necessary! Because of the war!"
"I said, thank you!" Malfoy snapped. Then he turned to walk away. Harry was stunned. This was the second time in two days Malfoy had been polite to him. He wondered if the world was going to end, then decided that he hadn't defeated an evil mastermind only for the world to die just months later. Malfoy reached the end of the hallway and turned the corner, leaving Harry standing there alone.
Malfoy cut him off. "I know, Potter. Really, you should have paid more attention to me before. I told you that the Werewolf hairs were dangerous!" Harry blinked in confusion. Malfoy rolled his eyes. "I cannot believe you, Potter. We talked about it only this morning. You attacked me because you touched the vial with the hairs in it, and they caused you to have strong feelings of anger. It's fine, just pay attention next time."
" Goodbye, mother," Draco whispered in his mother's ear. His throat was closing up, so he refrained from saying more. "Goodbye, my love," his mother said, smiling softly. "Please be happy this year, Draco. Be free. Do not worry about anything this time. This is your year to do simply as you wish. Please find your happiness, my dear, so I may be at peace."
Harry flushed and opened his mouth to deny any sort of attractiveness, but Draco kissed him before he could get a word out. "Talking counts as moving," he murmured against his lips. "If you're going to be difficult, then I'll have to resort to thinking about something else."
That night he had one of the worst nightmares yet. He was in Voldemort's head again, seeing through his eyes. He had to watch as everyone he knew was murdered in front of him, seemingly by his own hand. They screamed and tried to run, blaming him for their deaths. And the worst part was the sick, alien satisfaction he felt twisting inside him as each body hit the ground.
On Sunday morning, to Harry and Ron's astonishment, Hermione rushed off, saying Parkinson had enlisted her help in setting up the party. Only, she had called her Pansy, much to their surprise. Harry and Ron had spent the afternoon playing quidditch with Ginny and a couple of others from the Gryffindor house team. After a couple of hours of flying, they trudged back into the common room, chatting and laughing, and went to their respective dorms to change. Afterward, Harry and Ron headed up to the Room of Requirement early, as per Hermione's request.
In the middle of talking about Harry's crush on Draco, which he learned had started sometime in Sixth Year and had been quite obsessive for lack of a better word, the mail arrived. Harry was protesting fiercely while the owls swirled overhead, seeking out the recipients of their cargo. Medium-sized, generic brown-colored owls landed on the tables in front of many students. These were the owls of the Daily Prophet, much less prevalent than before but still frequent visitors of Hogwarts. Harry outright refused to buy the newspaper anymore. While Draco agreed they were ignorant, greedy vultures who published a dishrag that could only loosely be referred to as news, he thought it worthwhile to keep an eye on what nonsense they were coming up with. This morning, he half regretted it. Only half, though, because he was still glad to have some warning.
"Who was it, Draco? Tell me so I can go murder them!" Pansy said in a voice that almost made Draco shiver in fear. It was at times like this that he remembered that Pansy knew just as much about the Dark Arts as he did.
"Mione," Ron finally interrupted. "Please let us eat. I promise I'll pay attention next lesson." Hermione looked a bit upset at being cut off but was placated by Ron's promise. They began to eat, listening to the conversations around them. Neville and Dean were having a discussion about some new plant that apparently ate birds, Lavender was telling Parvati and a very bored Seamus all about the latest and greatest in fashion, and Ginny was talking to some of her fellow 7th years about lessons. Ron looked a bit ill at that.
"You two are insufferable," Parkinson lamented.
"Yes, Potter. I do." Malfoy finally admitted softly. Though the look he gave Harry was pained, his gaze remained steady. "I deserve all this and more. My crimes were not petty. Truth be told, you should have let me go to Azkaban."
Harry realized with a start that if Malfoy went back to find that Harry's bed was empty, he would quickly be able to figure out that Harry had slipped out sometime during his conversation with Pansy. Harry hurried back to the dorm as quietly as possible, slipping in and throwing the cloak and map back into his trunk. He tried to lay down in a similar position to the one he woke up in. He was still, heart racing, as he heard the door open and shut quietly. He heard rustling as Malfoy went back to his bed, then the sounds of the curtain being shut, and finally only the sound of breathing. Harry lay in bed, relieved, thinking about what he had heard.
"Well?" Pansy said, hands on her hips, foot tapping the ground. Draco sighed. "Harry didn't want to leave because... because of reasons that I cannot and will not reveal. So I brought him breakfast, but then he asked me not to leave, so I didn't. He needed me, Pans, I honestly couldn't leave him like that." Pansy looked a bit miffed.
————————————————————————
A dragon? He did not tell me anything about becoming an animagus. Magical creature animagi do tend to run in our family with quite a bit more frequency than many other families. Still, I should have liked to know, and I long to see it. He would make a magnificent dragon, no? I thought so too when I named him for that particular constellation. I wish he had not stayed up quite so many nights, though if that is what saved him, I shall most assuredly not complain. Please do let me know the moment you see him, and I thank you once more for your consideration.
This time Harry really did choke. After a long coughing fit with Ron thumping him on the back, trying to hold back snickers and miserably failing, he finally surfaced, spluttering. Ron was full out laughing now.
Harry sank to the floor, positive that this was where Draco had been kept, but it was too late. He was gone.
"You're welcome," he muttered under his breath and checked the time. Realizing he would be late if he didn't head to class, he took off in the same direction as Malfoy. Nevertheless, he arrived a minute late, sliding into his seat next to Hermione, panting and out of breath. Flitwick gave him a baleful look but continued his lecture, and Hermione gave him a concerned glance. He could tell she wanted to know where he had been, but he looked forwards and feigned interest in the lecture. It was something about the theories of charming something for perpetual motion, and it didn't sound very interesting to Harry. He turned his thoughts back to the fight.
"What do you mean, Pans?" He demanded. She smirked. "Potter and the female Weasley aren't together. I was talking with Loony Lovegood yesterday, and apparently, she and the female Weasley are dating." Draco stared at Pansy.
Harry washed himself off, cleaning away the evidence of his actions. He turned off the water and groped for his towel, grabbing it and drying himself off. He wrapped the towel around his waist and shoved his glasses back on. Of course, he had forgotten his clothes again, so he walked out to retrieve them.
Draco nearly sagged in relief. He pushed himself off of the doorframe and walked over to the furthest bed from Potter's, dumping his stuff on it. He collapsed on the bed and drew the curtains to gain some privacy. He was going to kill Pansy.
Draco made a small noise, and suddenly Harry found himself incapable of thinking. He pulled the blond closer to him with the hand on his neck, reveling in Draco's intoxicating taste. Suddenly, the other boy pulled back.
The man did not take much notice of him, however. He turned and led them to the side, where a dark hallway was barely visible. At the very end, two doors waited for them; they went through the one on the right. Surprisingly, it was pleasant; there was a table set for two, and the light was dimmed to a cozy setting. It was clean, unadorned, and private - perfect for them.
"Are you alright?" He asked carefully. He didn't want to offend Malfoy. Malfoy nodded but didn't look at him. Instead, he mumbled something and inspected his shoes.
Alina waved him off. "A passing affliction," she assured him. "Purebloods can't be homosexual. Besides, I'm absolutely perfect for you. Your parents would be pleased with our bonding."
Draco woke up with a pounding headache. He groaned, burying his head into his pillow. He was seriously regretting drinking so much on a Sunday evening. He could barely even remember anything. His last memory was of Blaise telling him he was going to get Potter.
"No, don't speak yet. You'll say something you'll regret, remember? Just listen to my voice and follow my instructions," she ordered him.
The other person stumbled back and said in a nasty tone, "Watch where you're- oh, it's you, Potter. I should have known. No one else is idiotic enough to walk around without looking where they're going." Malfoy said, rolling his eyes, but it was more of a joke than an insult. Normally, Harry might have smiled or even laughed, but all he felt was a strong wave of rage. Malfoy's face dropped at the expression of anger on Harry's face.
Harry contemplated that. "Okay," he agreed. "It's not terribly exciting," he warned. "Nothing we haven't already done. You just kissed me, and it freaked me out because I liked it. A lot."
Ron looked slightly queasy. "Can we please not talk about Malfoy's prick? It's making me uncomfortable." Harry laughed and Hermione rolled her eyes. She really was the best. Harry didn't know how he would survive if he didn't have her.
"I see no problem with that," Harry said coolly, but Hermione just smirked.
Draco faked offense. "Supposed? I will have you know they are very real and obvious."
Draco almost blushed. If there was one thing he thanked his father for, it was his countless lessons on maintaining the Malfoy Mask. It certainly came in handy now. He coughed. "Potter won't be doing anything of the sort, Pans. Potter's the most heterosexual guy in all of Hogwarts. If anything, he'll be drooling over the Weaslette." He suddenly felt sick.
If I am right, he may return soon. I promise to notify you immediately if he does.
Still, he missed Draco more than he could say. Everyone could tell, too. They all acted extra cheerful around him and tried to distract him with tasks or games. Even Ron asked him to play chess far more than usual - Harry was as terrible at it as always, so it had to be boring for him. As for Molly, well, it was the summer before fifth year all over again, except this time she was trying to distract him from Draco instead of the Order. Arthur dragged Harry into many a conversation about muggle technology, while the twins were ever eager to update their financial partner on the successes of their store. Hermione encouraged Harry to get ahead on schoolwork.
"Not Potter!" A familiar voice drawled next to his ear. Malfoy was standing next to him, looking at the list with a scandalized expression. When he noticed Harry looking, he sneered at him. "This year will be fun, won't it Potter?" Malfoy smirked.
He wondered if Harry was intent on driving him mad. Now that he knew Draco was attracted to him, would he turn around and take advantage of it to torment him? Only a year ago, Draco would not have been surprised if he did. But things were different now. They were friends. Weren't they? Perhaps this was all a ruse designed by Harry and the Weasel to humiliate him. Actually, that made perfect sense. Draco tried to push his bleak thoughts to the back of his mind, but he could still feel them lurking.
Harry put on his defiant face and resolved not to break. It was all the more difficult because part of him wanted Draco to break through his defenses.
————————————————————————
"But, I really hate Potter." Draco clarified.
Only moments later, Pansy hurried in and dropped down beside him, out of breath and looking harried.
"Hurry up, you peasant!"
"Ron, I would watch out if I were you. Draco's Slytherin's prince, after all. He didn't earn that position for nothing." Harry warned his mate without taking his eyes off of Draco, whose face had twisted into that of mock outrage that couldn't quite disguise his pride at his title.
"You're right," Draco said apologetically. "The school was pretty wretched. Are we in Italy? And may I ask why you are the one who is rescuing me?"
Draco gave a sarcastic laugh, which nearly turned into a sob. "You'll have to be more specific, Harry. Did I mean the part about you being difficult? Absolutely. Did I mean the part about wanting you to be able to relax? Of course. Did I mean the part about wanting to take care of you? However embarrassing it is for me to admit, yes, I did. Did I mean-"
Their lips moved in sync, hungry and insatiable. Harry wondered, with increasing awe, why had he wasted a second not kissing Draco when it was so obviously what he had been made to do? He wound a hand into the hair at the nape of Draco's neck, the other pushing against the ground to support his weight.
——————————————————
Harry sighed, but said, "Fine. I'll take him." Blaise nodded in thanks, and said, "You'd better go quickly, last I saw he was threatening to start dancing on the tabletop." Draco cringed. He had no desire to see that.
Harry tore open the paper over the small box and opened it to reveal a slip of paper. "What's this?" he asked, reading it. "Call Miffy for your present? What does that mean?"
He reached down, wrapping his hand around his dick. A couple of firm tugs had him fully hard again, and he increased the pace of his hand with fervor. He thought of Harry, leaning in to kiss him, soft lips and wicked tongue caressing his mouth and neck. Draco groaned softly. His other hand twisted in the sheets, tugging just for the sake of holding on to something. His heels dug into the mattress, his back arched, and he gasped with every breath. Draco squeezed his eyes shut. Harry's lips on his neck, Harry's hands on his body, Harry's tongue in his mouth, Harry's eyes locked on his-
"No, it is not okay! You're wasting away, darling. You've lost nearly ten pounds, and I refuse to let your constant pining turn you into a skeleton!" Now that Harry looked closely, Draco did look a bit thinner than usual. But what did Parkinson mean by pining? Hermione had that look on her face, the one that meant 'I figured out something.' It was the same one she wore in 2nd year before running off to the library and getting petrified.
The moment Harry entered the common room, Hermione knew. She stood while offering platitudes to Ron to prevent him from joining them - Harry or Hermione would always fill him in later, but Ron was never the best at the actual calming Harry down bit. Ron was one of the best friends Harry could ask for, and he knew he would always have Ron's support, but they all knew where each of their strengths lay in their friendship, and they were comfortable with their respective roles.
Draco quickly guzzled down a glass of pumpkin juice and shoved some bacon into his mouth. He grabbed an apple to eat on the way to class. Pansy had clearly already eaten because she didn't take anything, just watched him in disgust.
"At least that way the rest of us will have some," Draco muttered under his breath.
As it were, Draco decided he may as well see how long this madness would endure. Surely not everyone would be fooled into thinking he was royalty?
————————————————————————
"You're a bit young, aren't you?" the man asked suspiciously.
"I know that is what you wish, Your Highness, but you have a responsibility to the kingdom. You cannot renounce your title as you tried a week ago. It is simply not done," the man informed him calmly, removing his dark sunglasses. His face was plain, forgettable, with absolutely no defining features. He had dark hair, dark eyes, and pale skin, but not too pale - he was utterly average in terms of appearances.
"Oh sure, Potter, blame it on the war."
Draco immediately stepped closer. Now that they were in a relationship, Harry was his concern, his to take care of. It was his duty - and his pleasure - to ensure that Harry received all the affection and attention he could provide.
"Harry," a voice whispered. It was dark. Harry turned about, trying to see where the voice was coming from, but he couldn't see a thing. "Harry," it whispered again, more insistently. The voice was familiar. Harry kept looking around in vain. "Potter," it said this time, and now Harry recognized it.
Parkinson was staring at him with a positively nasty look on her face. Harry quickly looked away. He wondered why she was so upset. It looked like she was feeding Malfoy earlier. Maybe she was Malfoy's girlfriend, and she was trying to defend him or something. Harry didn't know why, but that thought made him want to strangle the girl.
He rushed out of the room, Pansy right behind him.
After a moment of recovery, Draco reached for his wand and vanished the mess. He pulled his pajamas back on from where they clung to his thighs. It didn't take long for him to drift off into sleep.
Harry popped up. "So, I'm not attracted to him?" He asked, hopefully. Hermione gave him a scrutinizing look. "I think that's something you'll have to figure out for yourself, Harry," she told him firmly.
A magpie. Draco watched in confusion as the bird gave him what, in his drunken haze, looked awfully like a beaky grin. Then, it let out a single, sharp call, and flew right at him.
"Harry," Hermione said exasperatedly. He jumped. "Yes, 'Mione?" Harry replied guiltily.
Harry shook his head. "You didn't want it, Draco. You didn't want that thing on your arm. That's why I don't have a problem with seeing it, or with touching it. Because you didn't want it to be there. It reminds me that you're not such a bad person." Harry smiled at him. Draco looked taken aback.
"You what?" Harry sounded angrier and angrier by the minute.
They were silent for another moment. "Should we be concerned about that?" Harry asked him. "Oh, definitely. The whole school will know by breakfast," he informed the brunet.
Harry deliberated silently. Finally, he straightened and looked Draco fully in the eyes. "I don't understand how you find me attractive," he stated clearly and firmly, but it was all a facade. His voice had a hint of a tremor, betraying his true feelings. A lot was depending on Draco's answer.
"Go to sleep, Malfoy," he told him softly. Then he left the boy, retreating to the bathroom in the hopes he would be unconscious when he came out.
"I'm not moping," he insisted. "I'm perfectly content today."
Harry nodded. It was good advice, and one should always pay attention to Hermione's ideas.
This was killing him. Through sheer force of will, Harry had managed to keep himself from flooing straight to the Manor for three whole days. Well, that and he disliked the place enough that it was a compelling reason to stay in the warm, comfortable home that was the Burrow.
He took a breath and knocked on the door, hesitantly opening it when Draco yelled to enter.
"Me?" Draco blinked at him. "What about you? How can you speak of them so easily?"
A majority raised their hands.
Soon, the door of the run-down hut banged open, and the half-giant came out, struggling to carry a massive bag of what looked horribly like flobberworms. Potter, the massive idiot, stepped forward to help. The two of them together managed to get the flobberworms out successfully.
“You wanted to see me, sir?”
Draco checked Potter over, subtly, making sure he didn’t go into shock again, before making his way back to their chairs.
Harry did, taking the brown bag with him, and Draco made his way to the sitting room to fetch his record player. He spared one longing look at the boombox, which still held the mysterious mixtape, before selecting a record and floating the record player across the house to the sunroom.
the figure probed, and Draco honestly could not figure out what their aim was. To understand Harry? To get him out of the way? To belittle him?
about it.
He saw his stolen photograph lying next to the now-empty glass, and thanked her again as he stared at the loop of Draco’s joy, his chest filling with warmth.
Draco’s eyes widened, then flicked down to Harry’s lips. Harry hated this feeling, this
Draco’s smile was blinding. He took Harry’s hand in his own and started leading him across the garden, towards the trail that led into the forest.
The stockings covered his feet, sliding up over his knees, ending with a band of black lace in the middle of his thighs. They were held up by the sharp lines of a black garter belt, clipped carefully onto the lace, sitting perfectly on Harry’s narrow hips over delicate black knickers. Draco was mesmerized by the curves of black silk, the contrasting shapes it made on Harry’s radiant, copper skin.
And he was perfectly okay with it. Because he’d certainly never dreamt about seeing his lover in
Harry knit his brows in confusion.
I swear, you know that idiot told me that it was
And then he remembered: he’d been so completely focused on Draco, today, he’d forgotten to go to the Ministry and deposit a fake memory. It was half past midnight, and the Department of Mysteries was now missing a day of “observations.”
“This looks to me like it might be a mind curse,” Malfoy continued, “but we won’t know for sure until we get in there. I’ve certainly never seen anything like it—most silence curses simply remove one’s voicebox, physically. But curses inside the mind tend to leave clues, or marks, like… like breadcrumbs.'' He furrowed his brows, probably realizing how weird that sounded coming from his pureblood mouth. Harry understood, but was surprised by the reference.
“You called me a stinky little weasel thief,” Draco said dazedly as the comment finally registered.
He left the room without looking back, and found the door to the loo right in front of him.
Eventually, Potter gave one look each to Granger and Weasley, as if to say,
“The first one,” Draco said, pointing at the short trail on the chalkboard, “obviously changed your life, was the reason you became who you are. The snake, I think, must have been your first… I’d say
“Mum and I know where the shop is,” she said seriously. “They have them in every size. You can come with us next time we go.” Draco heard Pansy sigh—Camila was
“Oh, you’re going to dance, Harry,” he said, grinning mischievously when Harry’s eyes widened and his head shaking became more frantic. “Absolutely, yes, you are, no arguments—not that you can, anyway. We’ve flown plenty before, and dueled, you’ll have
“The door says
from you! And apparently it got bad enough that he made you a mixtape with
too.”
Timsy immediately popped into the room, with two steaming mugs of hot chocolate topped with homemade marshmallows. Harry had never seen an elf so fast and efficient, like he was in tune with Draco’s every need. His big, round eyes landed on Draco, assessing his current state, and he turned a surprisingly menacing glare on Harry.
“You hurt
Harry hated that he hoped for a hidden smile. He wanted to be around Draco all the time—but not like this. Not smothered in everything he couldn’t say, in his worrisome theories and secrets.
“It’s about fucking time,” Pansy’s soft voice and sharp tongue sounded from Draco’s other side, and he turned his head away from Harry to see his best friend and his mother sharing a transfigured, oversized armchair, with Camila curled up in their laps, fast asleep. Narcissa was blinking herself awake, startled by Pansy’s quiet outburst. How had Draco not even noticed, not even looked—?
He imagined writing a C.V., and snorted.
Harry’s hand tightened unconsciously. “Until you tell me to leave,” he answered. He wasn’t sure if it was true, but it felt right. If, by some miracle, Narcissa returned unharmed, Harry’s job turned out to be perfectly harmless, and everything went back to normal… Harry would stay, useless and creepy, until Draco told him to leave. He could never go back to a normal life without him, after this, no matter how it ended.
“I need the Hall of Prophecy,” he muttered, and the disorienting walls froze suddenly, a door in front of them opening wide, revealing the room featured in many of Harry’s nightmares. Ron raised his eyebrows.
Potter didn’t want to leave the country, gods forbid the Golden Boy shirk his hero duties for a few weeks to heal from a curse. Draco was the only Healer Legilimens in England, and he was sure Potter was quite eager to get back to chasing Dark wizards and generally being Wizarding Britain’s pride and joy.
He unlocked the door to Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place, sighing with relief as he closed it behind him and felt the wards slide into place. He kicked off his boots and made his way up the stairs.
“Ron, seriously,” Harry chided, unwrapping his own sandwich with much more restraint. Ron groaned around his food, rolled his eyes, but thankfully waited until he swallowed it to speak again.
Or maybe just tea with his mum?
the time.”
Harry smiled at her cheek as his nerves settled a little. It was marked with today’s date—he was pretty sure, anyway—so Draco was probably still there.
“But that’s…” Harry huffed, quickly losing steam.
“Yes, I don’t know,” Malfoy flapped his hand impatiently. “She leads a quiet life, alright? She reads and tends to her gardens, she goes to book club on Saturdays and has tea with me on Sundays. It’s been quiet, since—” He stopped himself, shifting uncomfortably in his chair.
“Over and over,” Draco replied, grinning at him. “I’m the best at it. No one writes ‘Harry Potter is a git’ like I can. I’ve had more practice than anyone.”
“Healer,” he greeted, again.
When Harry finally pulled himself together enough to face him again, Malfoy’s smile was blinding. It set Harry’s stomach fluttering, and he thanked the gods his face was already red from laughter and the cold, because his blush would have been entirely too revealing.
“S’alright, we’re so close.” Ron squeezed him hard, patting his back. “We have ‘em running, I just wanted to be absolutely sure—”
He held an empty vial in one hand, his wand in the other, the tip pressed to his temple. His heart pounded in his ribs, and he knew this was his job, it was just observations, seeing all there was to see—it was so boring and dull and harmless—
They finished their meditation, comfortable in their routine, now, and Draco raised his wand, waiting. Harry’s eye contact seemed more intense than usual, but Draco went with it.
The last thing Draco expected to see at this gala was Potter, in his formal robes,
“Of course not, I’m having a lovely time.”
Draco’s breathing was speeding up.
Harry felt like he’d been punched. That was almost exactly what Kingsley had said—and exactly why Harry had agreed to do it. Had he really become a slave to
Ron rolled his eyes. “Yeah, go get him.”
It was still worth it, he thought, even if they never spoke to him again. He’d done the right thing, though it was the hardest fucking thing.
it certainly was. Harry pressed a firm kiss to Draco’s lips, shaking him out of his thoughts. “Draco. You don’t have to hide something like this from me, you’re not—too much. You’re never too much. I
Draco sighed and tossed the parchment onto his desk, adjusting his glasses. He grabbed a sheet of fresh stationery and clicked open a biro to pen a delicate, disappointing letter to his mother.
The door creaked slightly as Draco went inside, taking his warmth and his comforting scent with him. Harry fought the immediate urge to follow him, because his mind was working too hard, trying to figure out how to start
Harry nodded slowly.
“Nightmares or insomnia?” Draco asked, holding up one and two fingers for Harry to use as an answer. Harry hesitated for a moment before holding up one finger. Draco nodded in understanding.

“Parkinson, I smell a breakthrough coming on,” Ron said, making Harry glare at him. “Let’s go for a walk, yeah? Have a break from this minefield of sexual tension?”
himself, right now.
Harry hummed. “It is interesting, sir. There’s so much to see at the Manor. Malfoy is quite a character.”
Was this person a Seer? Were they trying to fulfill a prophecy? Or—and this was a large possibility—were they just crazy? Draco had seen a lot of harm done under the guise of ‘the greater good.’ Some people genuinely believed they were doing the right thing, while doing the worst possible things.
“I’m sorry, Harry,” he whispered, because he had never actually said it to him before, and he needed to. Draco lifted his hands, gently gripping Harry’s wrists, holding him there, ignoring the twisting pain in his gut, which he could now differentiate as the bonds of the Ministry deciding Draco was being
She gasped sharply. The song changed, and her face melted from concern to fear to a fierce glare.
There was one light on in the window of Draco’s sitting room; a bright, singular beacon in a world of darkness. It called him home like nothing else could.
Harry’s lips twitched at the strict, reproachful tone. He rolled his eyes, but did as he was told, plopping himself down at her feet with his back to her knees, watching the images flash on the telly.
Harry sat up as well and mirrored Draco’s position. “You don’t have to mirror me exactly, as long as you’re comfortable, but aware. Now, close your eyes…”
Draco thought irritably, scowling.

—and even in death, Dumbledore was pleasantly surprised when Harry came through it, tethered to life by a mere twist of fate. And then the man practically told him to
“I’m amazed you only got one detention that year, the amount of mischief you got up to,” Draco commented. Harry rolled his eyes.
A faint blush appeared on Narcissa’s high cheekbones. “Oh.”
Potter’s mouth quirked, probably picturing a twitchy, ungraceful Draco Malfoy. He finally deemed his coffee safe to drink, and closed his eyes at the first sip, sighing in satisfaction. Draco smirked, but refrained from saying ‘I told you so.’
is unfinished business. Not a duel.”

Soon enough, Potter put his pen down, and after a great hesitation, handed his notebook to Draco. It only had a couple sentences on it.
“And you trusted her?” Draco prodded. Harry nodded slowly.
Yes I gave Dudley a cute twink boyfriend I have no regrets
Malfoy’s face softened, barely, as if he was unable to keep up the façade for too long these days.
Draco made a strangled little sound next to him, squeezing Harry’s hand hard enough to bruise. Narcissa cleared her throat again, rearranging her expression into something polite and impassive.
Draco picked up Potter’s notebook again, reading the next question, which was simple enough.
“Just in case,” Harry insisted. He shouldered his bag and stood next to the bed. Narcissa was fast asleep, her chest barely rising with shallow breaths. She looked paler than ever.
“He touches his chest,” Parkinson answered hesitantly, demonstrating the movement with the heel of her palm. “The scars, when he’s reminded of you. He doesn’t know he’s doing it, most of the time, the idiot.”
Harry opened his notebook immediately, and began to write.
“But they’re not—”
Harry closed the door quietly behind him with a soft

and pushing aside anything that
Harry continued staring silently at Draco, petrified, while Draco continued checking him over as a Healer, pulling out his wand and casting multiple diagnostic charms, which of course showed Harry to be in perfect health, but with a very elevated heart rate. A lock of his sleek hair fell into his face as he worked, and Harry fixated on it, to avoid staring at anything else.
“You’ve been in love with that git for over a decade, Draco, and you put yourself into a situation where you’d have him all to yourself, where he could get
“You learned that fame is fickle,” he analyzed, “and that it does not ensure loyalty.”
Harry rolled them over and pinned Draco down, which he seemed to be a little relieved by. Draco’s face was flushed and alight with happiness, positively glowing with it.
Harry swallowed, his gaze falling to the scar on Draco’s jaw, following it down to where it disappeared beneath his collar. Draco gripped his chin gently, forcing him to meet his eyes; they could start fires, like this, with only the strike of friction between them. The collision of their gazes had

Then he felt a sharp, mental
——————————————————
"Harry?"
"Don't. If you're apologizing because of what Pansy said earlier, then I would rather you didn't. I am fine." Draco interrupted him rather huffily.
Harry opened his mouth. "Look, Malfoy, I'm really sorry. I don't know why I did that, you didn't deserve it at all. I just felt so angry all of a sudden and-"
"It's really quite entertaining," she went on with quiet amusement. "You see, they very much hate each other, or, at least, they insist they do."
That night, Draco found it very hard to fall asleep. He had a nagging feeling like he had forgotten something essential, but he could not remember for the life of him what it was. He mentally ran through everything that happened during the day, not encountering anything that could remind him of his forgotten task. He tossed and turned, desperately expecting the feeling to go away on its own. He cast about for something else to think of, hoping that would aid him in his effort. Almost of its own will, his mind latched onto Harry.
Harry blushed and looked back down at the book. Then he realized Malfoy was still holding his wrist. He looked over to him.
He finally looked at her, nodding. "I'll be fine. It's no big deal. The worst thing will be if he decides to walk around shirtless."
"Yes?" Harry said, but it sounded more like a question than an answer.
----------------
They headed to the dorm, Draco following close behind. Past-Harry opened the door for them, holding past-Draco's wrist, and dragged him to his bed.
It had never been Ginny's scent in the Amortentia in Sixth Year. Everyone knows how close Parkinson and Draco had been that year; they were around each other all the time. It wouldn't have been improbable for the blond to pick up traces of her smell. Harry was following Draco so much that year that he must have noticed it, even if he didn't identify it.
Draco sighed. He kind of wanted to try growing wings. But he wasn't some reckless Gryffindor with a blatant disregard for instructions. Maybe he would try talons. He closed his eyes again and allowed his mind to zoom in on the talons. They were black, wicked, and menacingly sharp. He grinned in excitement, and his eyes fell on the book once more.
"I was there the night Dumbledore died. I saw as Malfoy prepared to kill him, and didn't. Dumbledore talked to him, urged him to reconsider and join the light side. He offered him and his family a way out. Malfoy lowered his wand, and it was clear that he was about to accept. But then the Carrows and Fenrir Greyback came in, and soon Severus Snape was there. And Malfoy had no choice but to raise his wand again. But Snape beat him to it. Snape was the one to kill Dumbledore because he knew that Malfoy could never do it and because he didn't want Malfoy to be a killer. Snape killed Dumbledore upon Dumbledore's request; it was all planned far in advance. So Malfoy never intended to kill Dumbledore in the end. He had every chance; Dumbledore was quite weak and defenseless, and they were alone for a while before the others arrived. As for becoming a Death Eater, I believe that was the mistake of a young and misguided boy who didn't know what he was getting himself into. There was undoubtedly pressure from his father and Voldemort himself to join. I do not think it can be held against him. Malfoy also saved my life, like his mother. Last year, I was captured by snatchers and brought to Malfoy Manor. Malfoy was brought in to help identify me since he has known me for years. Malfoy did not confirm my identity to the Death Eaters, so Voldemort was not called immediately, and I was later able to escape. Any Death Eater who truly wanted to follow Voldemort would have jumped at the chance to turn me in. And I refuse to believe that Malfoy simply did not recognize me. And as for the torture and harassment of the Hogwarts students...well, Malfoy couldn't have shown regret or signs of unwillingness to follow Voldemort with Death Eaters in the castle. It would have suicide, or at the very least, severe punishment. I believe that Malfoy never wanted any of this and he only did what he had to to keep his family safe, and any more than what was required of him."
"What view?" Harry asked. "I'm nothing to look at." He tried to laugh it off as a joke, but Draco heard the self-consciousness underlying his tone. His eyes snapped up to meet the iconic green ones, and immediately he knew something was off.
Despite his patrician upbringing, Draco's mouth fell open. Under the other man's scrutiny, he hastily shut it. "I am Draco Malfoy, but I am most certainly not the prince, nor royalty of any kind."
Suddenly, Harry understood.
"I should have known, Harry. Who else would be skulking about, invisible, no less, at this time of night?" Draco asked exasperatedly. "But why, may I ask, have you accosted me-" Harry slapped his hand over Draco's mouth quickly and shook his head frantically. The blond glared at him but thankfully remained silent. Only seconds later, they could hear Peeves approaching, singing a song at the top of his lungs, and occasionally cackling. By what they could make out of it, it was quite a sexual little ditty. The off-key voice grew louder and louder before finally fading away.
Harry desperately wanted to wrap Draco in his arms, but he couldn't move. He gave Draco a weak smile instead. "Yeah, Draco. We'll be fine."
Draco smirked, and Harry winced and blushed at his wording. "I didn't mean it like that. I intended to say that you should try visualizing me since I'm right here. You can look at my face or something, then try to recreate it in your mind, and you can see whether you were right or not."
The Chief Warlock gulped. "Then I declare Mrs. Malfoy innocent on all counts. However, since she is still a Death Eater, and married to a convicted Death Eater, she must be monitored to ensure she does not...relapse."
"No, you don't, darling. You hate that he's straight, and you hate that he's hot, and you hate that you're attracted to him, and you hate that you can't sleep because he's right there in the same room, but you most certainly do not hate Potter." Pansy said calmly, buttering her toast.
Harry was skeptical. "You were forced to do a lot of bad things. I wasn't forced." Draco looked annoyed. "Yes, you were. I forced you to defend yourself. Now shut it and just accept that I don't blame you for a single thing." Draco turned around and began to pull his clothes on. Harry stared after him incredulously.
She rolled her eyes. "I'm stuck with Abbot, Bulstrode, and Granger." She shuddered. "Not one out of the lot of them knows a thing about looking decent. They'll suck the fashion sense right out of me!"

Draco had always suspected that Teddy snuck into the forest on occasion to meet with the wolf clan they had met all those years ago, but until tonight he hadn’t had any real evidence. There was still an hour before curfew so he finished his rounds and then went to the entrance hall to wait for his return.

When curfew had passed and still Teddy hadn’t reappeared Draco wondered if he had snuck in one of the side doors. He was about to go check the dorms when he heard a distant howl from outside and an indistinct shout. It wasn’t a shout of terror or pain so Draco stayed where he was and waited for his student to come back inside.

His only answer is Teddy’s noncommittal grunt as he slumps over and proceeds to fall asleep on the table, his blanket doubling as a pillow. Harry cards a hand through the boys hair, still a striking blond from him mentioning Draco earlier, and goes to start making the pancakes.
“Do you think you’ll make it through a story?” Harry asks, only to see Teddy’s eyes close and his breathing leveled out.
Harry waited until he heard the bath running before sharing the rest of his conversation with Draco. “McGonagall thinks that Teddy is able to ‘talk’ to the wolves as a side effect from having a werewolf for a parent. Not many people are willing to get close to known werewolves so there isn’t much documentation or personal writings to go by. She knew Dumbledore could communicate with them, but he always was a little eccentric.”

Besides, they would never do anything that would bring harm to Teddy for the fear of our combined wraths.”

“Nothing, I just came to check and see if Teddy was in bed,” Harry rushes to say, not quite sure why he felt the need to explain himself. Nevertheless, Draco seems to visibly relax after hearing this statement, as he’s probably thinking that Harry is only there to make sure he isn’t corrupting his godson, or something along those lines. Not that Draco would ever do a thing; he obviously loves Teddy to pieces.
Ron quickly begins reviewing the case so far, but Harry mostly tunes him out, already familiar with every aspect of the case. During the week, when Teddy’s at Dromeda’s, Harry either spends his free time renovating or reviewing every detail of the case he is currently working on, hoping to find some hidden clue. So really, saying he's familiar with the case would be an understatement; he could recite every detail in his sleep—backwards.
No, Harry asked Andromeda for her help because she knew exactly how to handle Teddy. She was his main guardian since Tonks and Remus’ deaths, and Harry merely helped whenever he could.

“Malfoy, talk to me in the hall,” Harry says, barely glancing at the blond before storming out of the room.
Teddy jumps back from Draco, grabbing his 'wand' in the process. "I was thinking we could pretend we were wizard cops fighting a bunch of bad guys like you and Harry do at work," Teddy says, striking a defensive pose and pointing his prop at an unseen foe.
“It’s awfully late to be wandering the grounds, isn’t it? Especially with the full moon near, want to tell me what it is you are up to?” Draco stepped out of the shadows catching Teddy off guard. It was never his facial expressions that gave Teddy away, Draco had noticed over the years that his hair always reverted to its natural mousey brown whenever he was caught off guard. Almost like he couldn’t hold onto the morph that he was wearing.
Well, work is definitely going to be awkward tomorrow, Harry thinks as he makes his way to bed.

“Why not? They would be good friends. Draco said so himself.” Teddy is determined. All he needs Uncle Ron to do is convince Harry that Draco’s good now. Then they could be the best of friends and take Teddy to a bunch of really cool places. Maybe they could even be sort of like a family too. Teddy likes that idea best, but for now he needs to focus on making them friends.

Andromeda just hits him on the head and mutters something along the lines of, “You two are oblivious.”
“35 days to be exact. Sorry mate, we have an appointment to taste cakes in about 20 minutes,” Ron apologizes, he isn’t exactly lying either; they do have a cake tasting. It isn’t for another two hours, but Ron is sure he and Hermione can find
Taking a step forward, not willing to back down from the silent challenge in Harry’s eyes, Draco says, voice low, “I was quite aware of my surroundings, and fully conscience of what I was doing last night.”
A couple butterbeers and large bottle of firewhiskey later, a drunk Harry is leading a drunk Malfoy to the fireplace. The alcohol seems to be affecting Draco far more than himself; who knew the blond was such a lightweight?
Or: Draco finally has some alone time; Harry just needs to nip in for a book.
Things couldn't be worse. So much to a quiet year in Hogwarts.
Warily, Harry lances at Teddy and says, “Okay, just make sure he eats his carrots though.”

to occupy their time with. Once all of his things are together, Ron leans down and hugs Teddy, whispering into his ear, “We’ll talk more about on this Sunday when we go to the Burrow for dinner.”
“They are not coming to Godric’s Hollow with us. It’s time for us to get going and you, young man, are in trouble for running off from Draco like that. We will also be discussing this talent of yours for talking to wild creatures.” With that Harry took Teddy’s head and started to lead him back along the path out of the forest.

"Yes, Draco. This is your Aunt Andromeda," Narcissa answered her son without once breaking eye contact with her sister.
Draco Malfoy runs an anonymous sex advice column in the Witch Weekly magazine and gets hundreds of letters asking him for advice on sex, love and relationships. How was he to know that the advice he had given in response to one of those letters would result in Harry Potter showing up at his flat at 6 in the morning?
"Why does he not see Potter that often? I thought he was given to him to take care of after the Battle."
Harry hears a faint rustling sound, probably because Malfoy is on the bed with Teddy, even though there is a perfectly fine stool next to the bookshelf. Harry then hears Draco answer, in a soft and soothing voice he didn’t know the blond had, “Yes...it’s a nice story. I wish my father had let me read it when I was your age. Things may have been much different if he had.”
“I just want to see you happy, Harry,” she says, smiling, taking his arm and with the other hiking up the front of her dress so she doesn’t step on it.
Slightly confused by Malfoy’s odd behavior, Harry quickly dismisses it and says, “Apparently some new clues have cropped up in the case and he needs to go over them with us.”
Summary:
"Why not?"
The first time Harry met him, Teddy was only a month old at most and at first glance Harry was wrapped around the baby's tiny little fingers. It was that moment that Harry vowed to himself that he would always do what was best for Teddy and be the best parental figure he could be. Not long after that Harry had started to renovate a room for the small child, eagerly anticipating the day Teddy would begin staying with him.
Teddy’s head pokes out from under the blankets and he cracks an eye open to look at Harry. “When did you start calling him that?” His voice slurring from sleep.
"I wanna play pretend, but I can't find my play wand," Teddy says. After a few moments of searching, Teddy plops down on the floor and lets out a huff of defeat. Draco watches as an idea flits across Teddy's face and the small boy perks up. "Draco, you could use your magic to find my wand."

Harry finds himself rooted to the spot; Teddy hardly ever makes it completely through his bedtime stories, let alone talks. Harry hears Malfoy hum in acknowledgement, the sort of soft sound a parent makes when addressing their child. Harry knows he’s intruding on a private moment, but can’t bring himself to turn away from the door and whatever secrets may lay behind it on the mind of a certain blond.

As he looked at the pair, Harry felt annoyance bubbling in his chest. For some reason, it irritated him to see how happy Teddy seemed to be as he talked to Draco, arm-waving increasing as he gets more passionate about whatever he was talking about. With their day clearly ruined and Dromeda too upset about the encounter with her sister, Harry decided it would be best if they just left.
Draco nods. A typical toy wand; of course Harry had given Teddy such a tacky thing. Though Draco has to admit it is very smart; if Teddy happened to take it out with him in muggle London, no one would think it odd. All they would think is that Teddy is a small child who is fascinated by stage magic.
Harry looks disbelievingly at the kitten.

His legs are painted in patterned bands, starting from his ankles and ending at his upper thighs. His groin is left unmarked, the pale and empty skin meant to leave no doubt of the Claim once he makes it.

“And what is it you don’t want me to tell your head of house? Are you going to tell me how long you have been making late night visits to the forest?”
Harry chuckles and continues to walk to the kitchen, only stopping to nudge open the kitchen door. He uses his foot to pull out a chair and sets Teddy down on it. Harry presses a kiss to the top of his head and says, “I’m gonna make pancakes, okay?”
Draco didn't want to marry Potter, he really didn't, but he also does want this house and he never seems to be capable of escaping Potter anyway, so if he is already doomed to being married off he might as well decide for himself what he is worth, sign the papers and ignore everything wrong with that plan until physically no longer possible.

The ceremony goes off without a hitch. It’s a typical muggle wedding with the wizarding bonds in place of the traditional muggle vows.

As a reflex from years of enmity, Draco almost says no. He stops himself, however, and ponders, "You know, over the past few months I've gotten to know him better than I have in the past nine years combined. If you’d asked me a few months ago, I probably would have said no...but now I have to say yes. I like Harry. When he's being happy and carefree anyway... which is basically anytime he isn't talking to me."

“That’s probably a smart decision, but still doesn’t explain why you are going to visit so frequently,” Draco warmed their tea and passed Teddy the plate of biscuits.
