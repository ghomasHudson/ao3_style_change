I let my arms disentangle themselves from around my chest, my head tilting down to hide the giddy smile that about threatened to take the whole of my face from the bubbling adrenaline and fearful tinged sensation running amok within the contours of my body.
on my lip, my prick rising higher beneath my pants and my heart hammering away against my chest with a fast fervor.
My unbecoming was a covet that I had tried to shove violently - yes, viciously – into an obsidian chipped space I conjured on behalf of my own comfort.
I let my nails teasingly drag across the span of Harry’s head, scratching with a chastisement as I replied to the Gryffindor in a steady voice.
The silver wisps of the brat’s eyes swept across the second floor in bewilderment, before widening at seeing Caetia, the opal almost moonstone glow of Draco’s savory eyes flashing with a wash of emotions made up of anxiety, panic, ache and anger as he talked with my godfather’s boyfriend.
is who I am. Someone who isn’t good. I’ve always been a morbid boy. My magic, having a mind of its own, gets out of hand. It's sometimes too powerful for my own body to contain and it tries to entice me to do bad shit. I’ve murdered many, and I’ve liked it, fuck, I’ve
The sound of metal whizzing through the air caught my ears, the noise similar to that of someone sharpening a knife with a quick swipe up against the sharpener, fast and barely noticeable by a regular human’s hearing.
Left with only my pair of boots, I slipped those on and did my best to calm the racing jitter of my heart as I made my way out of my room, past the living room and into the kitchen where the smell of Italian sausage, eggs and biscuits wafted around me.
With a snicker, I waved my hand to both my cousin and his boyfriend before shutting the door behind me, sucking in a sharp breath to try and calm the racing of my anxious heart.
I gasped, tripping over my faltering, skittered steps as my right foot splashed rustic, metallic blood all over the bottom of my calves and leather pants when my eyes started to make out the club’s ground level, my head rearing back as if I was violently slapped across the front of my forehead. The light of my fearful rasp of a breath buzzing in my ringing ears as I watched the scene before me.
Perhaps I should numb the pain I feel at the moment regarding Harry. Dancing will surely distract myself from the assassin.
The people around me were shadowed over from the darkened lighting of the stage, obscuring my view of their faces and only allowing me the view of their silhouettes as they sat around the dark lounges they vacated.
The man leaned forward, snatching his hand out to grip a hold of my cheeks between the grime of his thumb and middle finger. My mind was too shocked to send off warning signals to my body to warn me of the man and run. I stood frozen on the spot as the pale figure squeezed the sides of my face hard enough to cause an umfortable, fear tinged, cringe to formulate across my pinched, astounded features.
Deciding to just throw on a black short sleeved rock band T-Shirt with extremely short dark red sleep shorts, I deemed myself ready for bed. Surprisingly, I listened to the band etched out over the front of my shirt and everything fit me perfectly. I’m pretty sure the boxers that I got would fit me fine, though I didn’t wear them since I hated putting on underwear when going to bed.
“Thank you.” I spoke my gratitude as I passed Weasley’s shaking form and walked into the portal without any swarm of nausea flooding my system.
So whenever we worked together on certain cases, he’d help me through the processes of finding our targets and interrogating them, even encouraged the killing, but I would always be the one to execute them.
Before I could whip my head around to see what the hell Harry was doing, I let out a squeal that seemed to ricochet off of the stretching walls of the tunnel, the sound surprised and laced with undercurrent of a heated gasp when I felt warm, large hands, curl themselves beneath the curves of my arse.
Twisting on my heel, I had the intention to yell at Potter for his terrible warning, but stopped in my determination to do so when I turned and found myself staring at the large chest of a rather pale and heavily muscled man.
So the Gryffindor left me to deal with handing Hezian the money over while being expected to sit still and look pretty as I waited for Granger to come and pick me up and bring me over to Harry once he was done with his “work” as Harry informed me to do.
“I’m sorry, but I really can’t. I need to finish this damn project.” I murmured out my words now, my gaze shifting away from Blaise’s so I wouldn’t have to look at his attempt at giving me sad puppy eyes and letting my concentration rear towards the dangling of my Nintendo Switch in my hand.
the effect I had on this dangerous man, a giddy dizziness spreading throughout my limbs at that fact.
“Are you guys two years olds!?” I almost winced at the way my voice pitched high in the face of my shock at the audacity of the two, feeling a blush heat my face in chagrin at being played with so easily.
I feared actually doing as Harry said in front of all these people and giving the person whom everyone thought was my worst enemy a lap dance because he gave me simple orders to.
My body turned jelly like in the limbs as I sagged against the counter while the assassin pressed the hard of his abs against my flat of my stomach, the anxiety seeping from my very pores as my breaths hitched at the press of Harry’s body against my own, the strong meat of his jean clad thigh sluicing between my legs and spreading them apart.
Harry was off of my body in an instant, as if I was some sort of disease he wanted to rid himself of. My own body feeling bereft and cold now.
Deciding to ignore Yevsky and focus all my attention on this cooperative man, I tilted my head and spoke with a voice that was quiet and set into a calm murmur. “Can I enter? I’d like to see the Chamber.”
Father always talked about how I never looked like how a "real man should look like", as he would say.
Snapping out of the confused, curious state of my thoughts, I let out a silent curse at myself, my mouth pulling up into an irritated small sneer as I turned around on the soles of my feet with my wand clutched tight in the fist of my right hand, rearing out of my daze with a heavy shudder at the knowledge that I was carrying around my wand once again.
Shrugging a shoulder carelessly up at Kevera, I tried giving him a blank look as he gave me a shite eating grin when Harry tightened his grip around my waist and flexed his fingers possessively tight into my flesh there, the Gryffindor purposefully displaying his position as more than an “acquaintance” to me in front of Kavera and making me grow hot in the neck and over my face.
The deep timbre of Harry’s voice shuddered like a riotous monsoon down the length of my curving spine, the sound emitting a sinful demand rather than a question.
When Harry had come to me at work in the afternoon today with a declaration that him and I would be having dinner with Hermione and Ron and their kids as a small celebration for everything that’s happened, I hadn’t been prepared for all of Harry's friends from Hogwarts to be here.
The Gryffindor curled his tongue inside of my hole, shoving the appendage further into me as he rolled his tongue in a filthy motion that had my toes curling at the same time I went and rose up on the tips of them. I gasped brokenly, head snapping back so I could stare up at the night sky with a dazed vision.
“I’ll do it.” I rushed my words out in a frantic spew, resisting the need to cower back from the sudden force of Harry’s quiet rage that had come forth in the wake of my outburst, my gaze stuck beneath the all consuming scorch that dripped ruby and jade from the damning calm the assassin’s eyes gave away as he met my attempted defiant stare.
I grew more angered for not allowing myself to be open for once and for showing how affected I was from everything that recently happened. I was in contradiction with myself.
That makes sense. But since I was practically a newcomer, I’m guessing I wouldn’t be liked much here.
as it liked to be called, continued with it's words before I could muster up anything to say in return.
I couldn’t promise myself that I would behave if I were to go out shopping since my mouth had a tendency to run off on its own and I had no plan on getting punished the way Harry had done to me by killing someone to teach me a lesson.
Except … well, what I found myself staring at as once the Stygian of Harry’s profusely powerful and brutal magic trickled away, was surely a scene that could rival a massacre, a genocide, a
The Assassin’s lips were heated, soft yet firm, moving sensually with mine as I whined into his mouth the moment Harry took a handful of my ass and forcefully made me rock my lower half over his own while he pressed his other hand’s palm against the back of my skull to bring me closer to his mouth.
“You’re going to see a lot more of them when we exit this room. And I told you to keep quiet. You speak, they will hear you and
It revealed a room with white polished slate floors and dark navy blue and charcoal grey furniture, the area luxurious in its simplistic shades of colors. A large slanted wall narrowed down to the right that was contained of full glass floor to ceiling windows that overlooked the entire city of Wisixi Podge city. The place looked to be a penthouse that probably was about one hundred levels or so above ground.
Gripping on the ledge of the window, I scrambled my feet up the ivy, winding leaves and shoved my right foot followed along with left foot soon after, into the open space the glass created for me.
Music thrummed along the column of my spine, thumping rhythmically down each vertebrae with a deep baritone from the bass humming like a thunderous turmoil surrounding the entirety of my sweat slick body.
This shit happened in the kind of novels that I’ve read out of pure need of fiction and trying to escape the realities of the world around me.
So Harry regrets what he did. Harry probably didn’t want to remember such a thing because he obviously just wanted to punish me.
With a goofy smile spreading across my features, I lifted my left arm up to wrap it around Harry’s broad muscled and heated back, nuzzling my nose into the top of his head and over his sweaty black locks, taking in the scent of
The assassin must have shown both Ron and Hermione his place during my time with the demon, my absence forcing them to work together in finding me and relighting their friendships once again as I assumed Harry yearned and hoped for. Something good coming out of my captivity at the least.
My heart felt like it was going to go through cardiac arrest at any moment from the force of it pounding furiously against my rib cage, the fear and adrenaline coursing through my veins from my determination in not glancing back behind me to see if Harry was following me or not.
Silence surrounded us, my chest aching to release the air I held within my chest for fear of making any movement of minute motion in case I made a small sound that broke the hush around both Harry and I in this large fucking mansion.
had dropped into the pit of my gut, nestling and festering there to create a play of prickling energy that made my groin embarrassingly throb beneath the contours of my dress.
Pulling on my own indifferent face that I was sure Harry had on his, I chewed on the insides of my cheeks as the assassin responded to Krum’s words.
I wanted to know why Harry was bubbling with this calm anger that only the hue of his hell glowing emerald kissed eyes shown through the dark gleam of his gaze whenever it caught my own stricken, embarrassed one with the eerily serene countenance displayed across the gorgeous features of his face.
The assassin flashed me a devilish grin in return, showing me his clean white teeth and giving me a dimpled smile that made me want to roll around the bed in a fit of giddiness to rid myself of all this overwhelming happiness despite really not wanting to dispel how excited I was.
, tore his assessing beady black eyes from my person to Harry’s, “and if you want to bring along your …
Sirius’s tiny smirk fell from his rugged features to showcase a look of dawning horror and surprise, a sense of perplexion encasing the whole of his face. “No. Let me tell you something, Draco. My godson will have my
Mouth parting, I flicked the tip of my tongue across my bottom lip, anxious and unnerved at the way Potter seemed to take no countenance at the fact that the vampire he was putting under his magic was going to be dead in a second with the way the creature was gargling on the bubbling spit gathering in his broken jaw.
I didn’t know whether Harry and Neville’s given nicknames for me were either an insult or an endearment.
Weasley was a softie when it came to any being of nature. Whether human, or creature, or any odd entities, he’d hesitate. I didn’t think he stuttered in his steps to kill because he cared for such creatures and humans, I think he hesitated because the act of killing personally irked him. The assassin was all about bringing about justice and putting criminals where they belonged, and even having them killed, but he couldn’t do the act. He felt guilt and sickness whenever he had to.
I wouldn’t push Harry on the subject if he didn’t want to talk about it. Of course I’m curious to know how the Golden Boy turned out to be an assassin, but the way the Gryffindor seemed to fall into himself and shut out anyone else made me try to change the subject quickly so I could get Harry back into the
And the magic only made my mind spiral into the depths of something similar to the beginning and end creation of the devil’s damnation.
For one moment I felt such burning agony in my mind, my ears burning and head feeling stuffed full of heat, and then the next, it was gone with the combustion of the Carbonou’s figure splitting itself apart right in front of me.
I’ll just have to find some shirt that could cover my neck from others around me, so as to not gain unwanted attention to the bruise marring my flesh so vividly. And the mark was most likely from my stupid arse getting hurt in the middle of the night as I slept, so it wasn’t much a big deal. But I’d like to cover up the hickey looking bruise to not have questions and assumptions be placed upon my person.
I thought I just hated the man. But it turned out that I was just obsessed with him and was mad at Potter for not having reciprocated a friendship between the two of us at such a young age. I didn’t know it at that time, but I did when I watched Potter, powerful, gorgeous and breathtaking, look down at me as I cried on the bathroom floor. It was then that I knew how far my liking for the man went and how stupid I was for thinking that my craving for Potter’s attention was not what someone who hated the other wanted from their enemy.
behind me, my heart taking one huge slam against my ribcage when I tried to quicken my steps further.
Having signed my name on the paper earlier today after my potions class up in the Gryffindors’ main quarters, rather embarrassingly quick from my inevitable fear of running into a certain specific set of two men that I bloody well feared colliding into, I had come straight to Pansy after and got into my designated outfit for the night.
Harry wouldn’t let anything happen to me, let alone allow someone to come into my room and mark me up without my knowing. Harry’s
“Harry! I know Draco is awake. You better let me in so I can see him!” Hermione’s familiar voice sounded through the door in shrill affronted excitement.
Hell, I never had someone touching me this way. Especially with their own fucking magic. The only pleasure I felt was with my hand on my cock or my fingers desperately shoving in and out of my hungry hole whenever I felt the urge or need to satisfy the burning ache in my gut.
I felt a deep blush form over the expanse of my neck and spread out over my cheeks, the moist part of my mouth leaving hefts of breath as I gave a little bow to the audience in quick succession and darted to the side like my arse was on fire, adrenaline a flood in my system as I tried to look for Granger.
The mansion was so high up on the slope that it’s surroundings were no longer sand from the ocean but pure, forest greens grass, the space around the multiple, intricate buildings covered by brilliant brushes of pastel, soft toned colored flowers and vines that wrapped up and around its frames. A forest was to the left of the large mansion while to the right of it, was the cliff and the ocean below. The large trees stretched on for miles and up another slope to the beginnings of yet another cliff.
I felt my body flood with heat as I watched in awe and infatuation at the spread of Harry’s cupid bow shaped lips, lifting up at the sides to reveal a dirty, cruel, and devilish grin that made my breath pick up in its pace, the Gryffindor’s eyes taking on a darker hue. “Nah, see you later. We’ll bring the money in by tomorrow and Draco will start working on the potion then.”
the plush of my mouth drop open to let the tip of my tongue peak out and drag its wet length up the inner flesh of Harry’s middle finger.
Not wanting to further turn myself into a laughing stock, I scrambled haphazardly off of Harry’s lap only to yelp out loud as right when I had my back turned towards Harry’s front with my right foot hovering just above the floorboards, the heated curl of the assassin’s fingers gripped the small round of my left ankle in a steady heavy hold that made the entirety of my frame break out in a series of violent, warmed shivers, the determined escape that once filtered inside of my person having seized to exist almost immediately from the one touch Harry procured upon me.
Rumors went around that Neville and Harry had experienced something quite tragic during the war and that’s what got them closer together as best friends.
I shifted, rising my lower half the slightest as I inched up his leg and to his upper thigh, to snap down in a rush, creating delicious burning tingles up my spine and back down.
. I had been thinking about what mine and Harry’s relationship was even about and to be honest, I was shy to ask the Gryffindor where we stood in this relationship, but he had already answered my internal questions about what he thought of us with his question about us being romantic partners before i could gain the courage too.
Hezian gave me a small smile, but it wasn’t very calming to my nerves. “You’re here to be protected. Despite you having been a death eater in your life, you haven’t done anything to be considered a danger now. Since you had the unfortunate circumstances in being involved in a large, threatening and death inducing situation with Animadverto, we decided to help you out. I’m assigning someone to have you safe and secure until we kill Animadverto so they won’t come to harm you.”
But my freedom was only limited. The only times I could use my magic was if Zereth was around. I didn’t even try to use it when they weren't here because I was sure the demon would notice right from the start and do something fucked up to me in retaliation for disobeying them.
Pursing my lips, I let out a scoff, reverting my eyes away from the massive man so I could look at the huge door as if it was the most fascinating thing I’ve ever seen. “Just give me the white band … and thank you, for letting me in.”
I could feel the slight wobble of my bottom lip, the tremble in the flesh making me suck it into my mouth so I could clamp my teeth over it and keep myself from looking like the mess that I felt at the moment.
I had to keep my focus steady and intent, letting my magic seep from my pores to swirl around my body as the tattoos on my body that Harry had charmed to hide came forth and seemed to breathe in the very atmosphere that surrounded me at the same time my magic grew by every passing second.
of the elevator as the metallic doors slid open to reveal a floor filled with cubicles, computer, desks and workers hunched over their work area. They were all either scribbling down on a variety of paperwork, typed on their keyboards, or talked animatedly over their assigned business phones.
My breaths quickened significantly as the beating of my heart went rioting against my chest as I felt Harry release my right thigh from his death grip only to feel the slamming heat of his wide palm collide against the low point of my spine. I released a wet gasp from the shocking, delirious part of my lips, the sound shattering against the striking noise of thunder resonating within the mansion.
This only made my anxiety ricochet higher up into my working, convulsing throat as I kept swallowing around a dry mouth as I searched with a crazed hysteria for any object large enough to hide behind or under. But nothing too big resided in this room.
A growl, hungry and feral, sounded in a thunderous and threatening drone out of Harry’s lips that were pulled up into a vicious snarl, all composed structure falling out of place from the single cruel upturn of his mouth. His eyes were shaded and hooded low like a flourescent crimson shade of light that dims from its suspension beneath a narrowed down ceiling, all confined and shrunk down to a callous focus.
I looked towards Granger who looked on towards the vampire with a flex of her jaw, no remorse in those brown of eyes of hers.
I blew the stray strands of my blonde hair out of my peripheral view even though it was a futile attempt with the way I had my head angled down to look at Harry, pursing my lips in ashamed frustration.
Snapping my hands up, I curved my fingers over the wide width of Harry’s shoulders, scraping my nails into the fabric of his shirt and catching his tanned skin beneath as I wiggled in his trap, clawing my fingers into his flesh as I pushed and pulled and flailed my legs about in a panic.
“Deal. Now you need to be taken to a safe location with only the best of my assassins. I think it’d be good if you get reacquainted with one of them first. I’ll be sending you off to where he’ll be then I'm sure he'll take it from there. I’ll contact him to get to you about the money. Have a good day, Mr. Malfoy.” I lurched forward, face pinching into that of a cringe as my mouth popped open to release an annoyed protest when I gave an internal scream at having seen Hezian take his wand out and swish it in my direction, once again apparating my body elsewhere.
this year was a heaven sent for me, I was running low on money from working in a Pygmy Puff pet store and didn't know how long I could go before I would be kicked out of my dingy apartment in Knockturn Alley from not having enough to pay for rent from the amount of money I got from the pet store every other week.
” Harry murmured indifferently, the dark timbre of his voice shooting warmth into my gut and making me produce an unintelligible small sound in the back of my throat as I felt my cheeks grow hot in embarrassment and subtle anger at the audacity of the man.
I stood there, gaping, as sounds of loud moans and luscious screams echoed throughout the whole of the area, bouncing off the pristine granite walls. People, who weren’t in the midst of fucking each other or in the middle of a ‘play’, were walking around bare arse naked or clothed with their partners, some collared and following their owners on their hands and knees or others trailing behind or beside their lover with their heads down or gazes fixated to the front. Many of the submissives that were collared had on cock rings.
Because then I had found myself lying flat on my back across the expanse of Harry’s soft mattress, body having become weightless in a split second before I was put beneath Harry’s hovering body planking over mine and caging me in with his strong arms on either side of my head and his knees locking me in from the sides of my thighs, entrapping me completely.
Well, immature thought here, he pissed me off by simply leaving me alone with people that I don’t even trust.
"N-no".  I rasped out loud my broken words, trying to at least seem like I had some semblance of a conscience left. Harry calling me a by such a derogatory term was supposed to anger me right? I gasped out in rapture despite how wrong this was, because I fucking loved hearing him say such vulgar words and referring me to them.
I sat delicately across the bed, waiting for Harry to speak as his faraway gaze flickered every which way around him. Like he was searching or lost in his own world.
I was going to completely ignore the shiver that encased the entirety of my body from those simple words Harry had just uttered my way, the heavy set of his red green eyes glowing with a certain blood lust and latent predatory arousal as the stern line of his jaw ticked in his strain of holding himself back from doing whatever he wanted to do to me in front of these people.
“Deal.” I breathed out, my hands shaking from where they gripped the counter behind me, trying to give myself a grounding object to keep from falling flat on my arse with how weak my limbs felt whenever I was around Harry.
Krum let out a long sigh then, causing me to blink and turn my head away from Harry’s dark gaze to look back at the Bulgarian. “This club is my house as well. You’re currently underground but, since Harry has said I can’t tell you exactly where you are, I can’t tell you anymore of the place you’re in. I will tell you that this sex club has been running for over three years and is only available to the highest royalties in both muggle and wizard world. They come here specifically to have sex with anyone they want in the most kinkiest, dirtiest form they can imagine. The only rules here is that no one is to hurt someone without consent. This place is stacked with guards. I don’t want you wandering around because, well … you reek of virginity and are too pretty to
“Why did you go and flirt with Cho in the first place?” I questioned, words shaking as I tried to keep the obvious bratty whine from escaping my mouth.
Draco writhe in pleasure pained ecstasy as I shoved my cock and filled that small body of his up to the brim with my juice, cream him until my balls slapped and nestled firmly against the sexy slope of his arse. Until he became my very own meat sock where I could ram myself into him and violate the pure beginnings of his very
“You get drunk off of one shot, Darling. Go take an edible and calm your arse down before getting tipsy.” Pansy yelled back at me in the bemused lull of her tone, snapping her brown gaze back towards my person as she raised her brows in a teasing manner with her smile growing even bigger.
My magic, all of the dark of my own and others that I had soaked into my flesh and bones, had stirred within the confines of my body, jittered against my skin in sparks of heat and frigid sensations that fluctuated with each other in an off and on basis, chaotic in its dark excitement from the action I was pursuing.
I snapped my head back down to openly seethe at the assassin, anger boiling beneath my skin with an irritating itch to claw its way out and flood over Harry. I was panicking at the way my cock made a friction between Harry’s body and my own, plumping up even more by every step Harry took as his side pressed harder against my prick.
put you through it. It’s wrong, it’s immoral and I’m fucked up, Draco. You don’t want me but I will forever fucking
I felt Caetia’s own fingers come up to tap me lightly on the bare skin of my arm, eliciting my wide eyes to snap up and meet Caetia’s fire etched eyes that were narrowed slightly in a look of exasperated yet complacent irritation. “Stop fiddling with your clothes. You look amazing, trust me. Now get out of here before all my hard work on trying to get these clothes to fit you perfectly goes to waste.” The boy’s voice was soft and tinged with a chastising fondness that made me feel floored and erratically thankful.
Thank you to everyone reading this story, it means the world to me as always and I am happy to get kudos and comments. Remember! I have a tumblr for my stories: reimcai.
I jolted from where I was suspended, hard steel cuffs wrapped around my wrists with an uncomfortable heavy weight. I looked up, eyes following the fine shimmer of the chain links above my head to find the ends hooked into the high ceiling above me. I was left dangling above the cemented floor, the tips of my shoe covered toes brushing the barest of an amount against the ground.
My heart kept hammering wildly against my ribcage throughout the whole fiasco, the profuse thumping a deafening echo within my ears as I tried to keep my breathing stable lest my lungs decided to collapse in on themselves the next second from how adrenalized I felt. I was riding on a crazed power high, my gaze not being able to focus on anything long enough for the life of me. My attention span had my eyes going from one thing to the next in a blurring motion.
I felt the strands of my dark hair brush across my temples and the back of my neck in fluttering caresses as I slammed my eyes shut and roared out my release, my cock
I was content in letting Harry plummet my mouth for his taking, sighing lovingly into my mouth as I wiggled restlessly beneath him while I just kept stroking Harry’s nape with my fingers and let the assassin hold my other hand with his against his heart.
Leaning back away from the man, my brows furrowed into a confused drawl, mouth thinning out as I watched the guy before me tilt his lips up into a crazed grin, the black rot of his teeth causing my stomach to lurch as he breathed out his next words to me. “ Let me tell you something …”
The assassin easily lifted me up over his shoulder with his one hand, the action causing his fingers to slip into the torn fabric further and curve around my arse to settle close to the space between my cheeks, eliciting a shudder to run down my spine and a spasm like wiggle of my lower half to
The clear command in Harry’s voice made me go limp in his hold and I couldn’t find it in myself to struggle because I knew that the bastard was stronger than me by a long shot and I wouldn’t get out of his grasp.
I'm so sorry for the wait on the update for this story. But I have so many things going on in my life right now that I barely have much time to work on my stories. I haven't given up on any of them, so please understand that I'm just slow on the updates. Thank you for your patience and your love as well as your continuous support for my work.
The mansion resembled that of dark Victorian mansion, detailed in its granite structure and high floor to ceiling windows on each level of the house’s various connected buildings.
I used to tolerate the color of my eyes when I was younger, when my eyes were just a hazy grey and people didn’t make as much jabs at me for them, but when entering into my fifth year in Hogwarts my eyes became this horrid pale color and everyone made fun of me for them, going as far as calling me a freak of nature.
My back went stiff when my chest collided with someone who was a sliver of space away from my turned figure, breath hitching in my throat when the person I smacked right into looked as pale as the cloudy sky above my head and watched me with hooded black eyes and gaunt like features.
Pansy loved helping choose out my outfits whenever we went out to a party, whether in the muggle or wizarding world. And I always had fun with her when we did so, but with my work cut out for me tonight, I couldn’t have my happy times with Pansy.
Granger’s eyes widened the slightest bit, a flash of daunting surprise shimmering in her brown gaze before she gave me a brilliant smile in return. “Great! I’ll get some pillows and a blanket for you and have Ron put some food away for you. I’m thankful the children are with their grandmother right now so they wouldn’t keep you up all night with their constant bickerings and yapping.”
Right as I turned the knob and took a step forward out into the long hallway, I heard Caetia speak up behind me. “Say yes to drugs and yes to strangers!”
The man watched me with those Stygian eyes of his, black orbs seeming to soak my every thought into his thin, emaciated frame. The chapped line of his lips cracked at the skin as the guy let a huge smile spread across his eerie face. I wasn’t judging him for his appearance, rather, he looked like a man in need of help at most, even if he was spewing out weird shit to me in the middle of the day.
Potter leaned forward, crowding into my space and causing my neck to strain back from having to tilt my head up so I could look at the man towering over me, his muscles moving against the fabric of his shirt and taking the very breath out of my open mouth with his sudden close proximity, threatening and overwhelming. “You follow my orders when I give them. Don’t get in my way. Don’t cause any trouble and don’t try to get yourself killed. You’re a tool for this job so don’t screw up. You’re nothing but a relative piece in this assignment and I don’t want you to cause me anymore of a headache than you already have. Do you understand me?” Potter’s voice was a roughened mumble now, dipping into the pit of my gut and scrambling up my insides with his words.
The mansion was a building that towered high, several levels of floors and windows coveting the whole of the granite, dark grey toned walls of the mansion that had at least three main areas connected to each other in a curving shape. The architecture was made up of Gothic hues with its pointed, intricate designs embedded into the stone like the mansion was built from the hands of one of history’s finest sculptors.
I sort of gawked at the way the square, steel door groaned in protest at being pushed from its place, the rustic appearance of its iron sounding out a series of squeaks and rattling as if the alloy was being moved for the first time after so many years.
The magic seized all at once, the heady sensation of raw power edging away from my subconscious as it left a throbbing prickle of energy in its wake throughout my chest, the hard strain of my muscles loosening as I felt the whole of my body grow lax while I knelt there in a quiet serenity.
Just the scent of cigars and chocolate dipped in warmed milk that specifically attached itself to the Golden Boy indicated that Harry was the one currently pressing me into the counter that wrapped around the whole of the kitchen, the jut of my hip bones jarring against the edged surface as my outstretched arm bent like a noodle in a state of shocked weakness at the single touch from Harry.
It was unearthly how gorgeous the blonde was, to the point that it was overwhelming and all consuming.
“Well you could have told me you were going to dismantle the stupid man before I came popping into the room.” Weasley rolled the blue of his eyes in annoyance although I could still make out the not-so-subtle uneasiness in the narrowed set of his gaze.
“W-Where were you last night?” I wanted to know where the Gryffindor was just to calm my racing heart and the ache in my chest at the unknown thought of Harry having been with someone while I was alone in our guestrooms waiting for him.
I whined when Harry chuckled darkly at the way my hands slipped around both our cocks, my cheeks burning as I breathed out a quaking huff of air in petulation.
as to what I was saying, I spewed out words that I had subconsciously felt but was too scared of saying out loud in fear of Harry’s rejection or reaction.
Most of the Slytherins, those who decided to come back to Hogwarts to finish their last year here including myself, were treated as outcasts, but there were rare occurrences regarding the other houses accepting some of the Slytherins.
A shiver, hot and heavy, trickled its way down the length of my arched back, causing a riotous tremble to shudder throughout the entirety of my body and my thighs to clench around the hard of Harry’s hips.
Harry went by the name “Devin Klarsi”, a man who was a new and upcoming MMA rookie in the U.S. and a wizard all at the same time.
I whipped my hand sideways and down to stare, cheeks reddened with mortification, at Harry grasping my arsecheeks in the span of his hands to carelessly push them up against my bum, the motion fast and filled with an easy strength that caused my stomach to dip ferociously with a flutter of electricity, finding my feet being lifted up and off of the floor, the tips of my toes brushing across the earthy ground.
My prick swung between the spread of my legs and the space created between Harry’s knees as I rigorously trembled from my suspended position.
The Slytherin always liked making me embarrassed just to see me fucking flustered because I never really showed emotions, and he liked seeing my struggle to keep myself from spluttering on the spot. Pansy usually was no help either, mostly often encouraging her boyfriend to make me feel mortified.
The front of my jean clad thighs pressed into the edges of the rounded table when I lost my stance, wiggling about on unsteady legs as I released a gasp of surprise at having the flat of my stomach settle on the table clumsily.
The hard planes of Harry’s abs pressed up against my stomach, his black hair falling into the hooded glow of his brilliant red green gaze that watched me with an unnerving focus.  The veins in his exposed, bronze hued muscled arms were prominent, pecs pressing up against the material of his short sleeved shirt as those lean biceps of his grew taught at the way Harry kept pushing me further into the wall with the flush of his fit frame.
I’m guessing that Harry didn’t want his boss to know about the discovery of my being a conduit for dark magic as well as being part elf and not wanting anyone else to see me practically naked.
“Y-yeah … we really should,” I whispered in a stuttering rasp into the stilted air, mouth popping open to release a shaky pained whine when I felt the length of my prick start to plump up in anticipation and Harry’s cock harden beneath my bum slowly and shockingly so.
My stupid pride and insecurities were getting in the way of what I wanted to do. And that was to follow Harry’s orders and to create a stir around us, to be reckless some more and have everyone know that the wizarding world’s most beloved hero was fucking and in a relation with none other than a renowned ex death eater who was none other than Draco Malfoy, one of the most hated people.
This has got to be one of the longest chapter's I've ever done. I hope you guys read it because a lot of stuff happens and there is tension in the air *maniacal laughter ensues*. I wanted to post this chapter earlier because I couldn't wait.
.” I breathed my words out, rapturous and imploring in my gratitude towards Harry’s words and the way he let himself be vulnerable in his mental state around me, holding me and reassuring my safety, my body pressed languidly against Harry’s chest as I let the now soft breathes escaping my mouth flutter across the shirt the assassin had on.
I stared, my eyes taking in the way the mahogany strands of the boy’s hair ruffled about like downy feathers as he smothered his lips against Harry’s cheek while slinking that short curvy, small frame of his against the assassin’s front and practically tried to stick himself to Harry like he wanted to become the Gryffindor's second skin.
The guys around the table watched avidly as I made my way towards them, steps sure and paced in a steady rhythm as I felt the beating of my heart banging itself haphazardly against my rib cage quiet violently with every step I took towards Neville and Harry.
Dropping my head back, I curled my lips up into an amused sneer, snarling out Draco’s name on the tip of my heavy tongue as the air in my lungs started to boil inside of my chest, soaking in the sensation of Draco’s sleeping body flopping about recklessly across the floor as I used him as my sex toy.
When Zereth flashed me its own grin to match my own, I knew that I had the demon right where I wanted it.
I couldn’t contain the hiss of my irritated response, my tone coming out in a gritted force while I stuck my nose up in the air in a haughty manner to keep anyone from seeing the unsettled shake of my person in nearing Harry and Neville, trying to make myself seem nonplussed in this situation while being watched by others and the two Gryffindors that made me want to sneer like a damn cat at them.
I laughed brokenly once the demon screeched like a dying animal at the way their hand melted away from their forearm, the skin sickeningly pulling apart from his appendage and bone marrow as it disintegrated morbidly from my flames.
So now I found myself sitting in Granger and Weasley’s warm little cottage home, smack dab in the middle of their living room with the scent of pumpkin spice and leather permeating profusely in the air surrounding me.
I could ask Sirius to distract Harry so I could get out of my room without the assassin's knowledge. Sirius owed me that much for using me to get Harry mad.
“Bloody hell!” I screamed out in agitation, my body filling with warmth as I walked even faster across the width of my floor.
.” Neville’s husky, roughened deep voice sunk its way into the depth of my core then, the indifferent timbre creating a spark of electricity to cascade down the flat of my stomach and straight to my groin as he spoke out his own epithet for me.
My gaze lifted up to watch Potter staring down at the trembling vampire, his eyes uninhibited with the shard of crimson red in those green eyes that darkened into a burgundy hue that let his face turn into a stony indifference. I could make out the defined line of his jaw still and tighten from the muscles tensing in his face as he looked carelessly down at the creature lying helpless on the floor beneath the onslaught of Potter’s sinister magic, heavy in the atmosphere and congesting in my throat to the point that my chest constricted with the way my lungs seemed to suffocate under the menacing magic.
Squeezing my eyes shut, I let out a heavy breath, lungs expanding and decompressing in the cage of my ribs as I reached my left hand up to tug the tie loose around my bun and let the mess of my hair tumble down my neck and brush the tired slouch of my shoulders.
When we were done and had everything sorted out, the assassin apparated us using wandless magic this time once he knew it was clear that no one was following us outside of Gringotts.
Everything in my limbs were loosening, even my hole was becoming larger around Harry’s huge, beast of a cock. The agonizing pleasurable ramming of the Gryffindor’s prick consistently going in and out of my hole causing a riot of fire induced sensation inside of my gut.
But I had to behave and not cut off Harry’s head since we had to go out tonight and there were more people here than I had expected.
I swayed in a haze of shocked revulsion, feeling my body lilt sideways in a state of nausea, but Harry seemed to have known how I would react to seeing what he shot since the man had easily nestled me into his side with a fast pull, the solid length of his hard body keeping me up and moving as the heat he radiated drowned over my shivering frame.
Everything went into a splash of moving colors in front of the wide of my eyes, varying dark shades obscuring my view when I felt my body being shifted too fast for my mind to comprehend what was happening in time.
“I’m sorry for messing with you. I just wanted to hear you say I looked good too. You know I don’t want Cho. Only. Want. You,” the Gryffindor explained in a vibrating husk against my wet lips. He bounced me on his thigh at the same time he rubbed his clothed cock against my hip while he created a friction between his thigh and my prick, punctuating his words with a rough thrust of his hips against me in a way that seemed to mock-fuck me.
Peaking out to the side and behind me with a turn of my head as I tracked up the stairs in my move to escape Harry’s catch of my figure, I found Harry  still at the bottom set of the steps, watching me with that teasing, raw grin of his.
So in the midst of my heated panic, in frustration with myself and the unsettling fear of Harry not wanting me after seeing me like
I ran my gaze up to Potter’s face, his features even more harsh and sharper than the last time I saw him, his jaw strong and those cheekbones indefinitely cut like marble, a drip of sweat running down the line of his jaw to the tip of his chin, caressing the smooth, light tanned, bronzed hue of his skin. The provocative curve of his lips were set into a neutral line, cold and detached.
Taking in a sharp breath, I turned to Harry, opening my mouth to tell the assassin to bring me somewhere else right this moment, but a person came barrelling on through smack dab between the two of us in a blur of cherry kiss red lingerie and black leather stiletto boots, interrupting my protesting words as they ran their polished, acrylic nails up the hard torso of Harry’s chest and around his neck like a
There were people surrounding a large round wooden table, cards displayed out on the tables or perched in their hands as they spoke lowly and calmly to each other. Cigarettes, blunts, and cigars either were hanging out the purse of the mens' lips, in their fingers, or resting in ashtrays.
. I wanted to completely monopolize his fragile frame in a scatter of bursting blue, yellow and purple bruises, and sink the edges of my teeth straight into that supple flesh of his until it left an embedding shape of my mouth
I didn’t even get the chance to give Harry a proper “thank you” before he turned on his heel and left me alone in my room to freak out over my desert.
Rolling the bottom of my lip into the quivering of my mouth, I let my teeth scrape over the flesh there with a jabbing bite that resulted into a nervous chew as I was left speechless in the face of Harry’s presence, especially after having
A tiny curl of my mouth grew more into a genuine smile, the space of my exerted cheeks a deep, flushed red from the exercise I just put my body through while my lungs expanded and deflated in quick successions beneath my chest.
“No. Definitely not.” Harry’s thunderous rumble ricocheted off of the walls of Hezian’s office, the tone definite and roughened with certitude.
Now father was in Azkaban and my mother was having fun in her own fake happy life with some wizarding rich husband. I hated staying over at her new boytoy's mansion and having to act all accommodating for the sake of making my mom happy in getting along with her partner.
I cried out when Harry went to bite down on my earlobe with a clamp of his teeth at the exact same time he twisted me around to slam my front against the wall he had been leaning against, the side of my cheek smashing against the surface as I wheezed breathlessly into the night air and tried to regain my balance.
The vampire’s black eyes turned into hateful slits as he snapped his jaw my way and made me visibly cringe at the clink of his teeth smashing together in the space surrounding the front of my face. “Oh you’d be fun to take down. You may be a Malfoy but you look like something that all my vampire friends would take turns fucking. We’ll let you be the slut you were born to be-”
“Maybe not,” Harry groaned agonizingly, a finality to his voice that had me laughing brightly when I was pushed off of the Gryffindor with a thrust of his pelvis and found myself pinned beneath the intimidating man.
Andrew let out a snicker, his mouth curling up in disdain as he peered up at me and away from his workload, the soumd cutting my rant off.
When the singer started in on the pre chorus of the song along with the sudden change in tempo of the electric guitar and heavy thumping of the drums, I had reached the front of the pole once again, glancing out towards the audience in time to catch sight of an all too familiar figure bathed beneath the shadows to obscure their face.
My face was done up by a professional makeup artist the club had for their strip dancers, although my makeup was quite simple with light shades. Gold highlighted the sharp lines of my cheekbones with dark cherry kissed red lip gloss covering my mouth. My eyes were outlined with black eyeliner with precise winged tips at the ends and a mix of  bronze, gold, and the lightest shade of red that faded out to create a smokey, sultry look that created a fresh look over the eyelids.
“Get on.” The Gryffindor’s voice was blunt and rasped with heavy command, his words final and leaving no room for argument as he penetrated my skin with the contrasting colors of his eyes.
A stupid part of me wanted Potter to do that again, the part where my crush lied dormant and hidden for him. This was the first time he was giving me attention despite him treating me like a nuisance for it.
My prick was trying to escape the confines of my jeans and I had to resist the urge to rock my hips back and forth over the meaty clothed flesh of Potter’s thigh, the hand clutching his knee tensing around its biting grasp as I reflexively dug my nails more into Potter’s knee cap in retaliation.
The women that stood behind the bartender counter gave me a purse of her glossy lips, tilting her hips to the side so she could place a hand on the jut of it and give me a narrowed eyed look. “I was informed of you coming for a few minutes. Albon Trisko is in one of the private rooms downstairs, room 399. You’ll find him there. Be quick or Mr. Zabini will get angry.”
Harry gave me a blank expression, defined features set into a harsh lines that shown the extent of his gorgeous structure, low lighting a dimmed halo that seemed to fade away into the blackness of the wall as shadows surrounding seemed to have been tainted from touching the sinister prominence of Harry’s essence.
I was often chained up for most of the time while Zereth was off doing gods knew what. And once the demon would come back, they’d let me go to the bathroom and clean myself up and then force me to kill whoever they deemed worthy to die by my own hands.
, so you won’t need to worry about your appearance because in all honestly, you’re beautiful. Let Harry be a bastard and go have some fun. You don’t
pass up. People here will eat you alive, Little Dove.” Krum’s voice hinted at an exasperation of sorts, as if he was reciting something from his own self created guidebook.
at the sight of the pretty boy’s collarbones and soft shoulders exposed to the purple neon lighting swathing his tempting frame in a colorful prominence.
I was going to kill this man. And there was no denying myself any further that I was going to enjoy it and lose a part of myself in the process. The outcome may be both good and bad.
I could hear the low chatter of the royal members drone throughout the whole room, groups mingling together while others just went at it like animals.
The past two days were just a mess, and my poor mind was trying to keep up with everything. There was too much unanswered questions going on and I needed them answered.
demented source of energy coming from the man fester with my own now, creating a ball of heady power to form in the center of my abdomen that went straight to my cock in a viscious arousal as my mental state felt every pain, sin, and sorrow the man’s magic carried with it.
I looked over at Caetia then. “And I’m guessing Sirius brought you along because he can’t seem to want to get his hands off of you?”
So I chanced a quick glance behind me to see where his attention was focused on instead and saw him chatting it up with Cho Chang of all people.
to help break into the facility with the other agents I’ve assigned, just in case something goes wrong since you’ve got a ton of experience dealing with missions not going the way we wanted them to and accomplishing them regardless.”
I chose to stick my nose up into the air as a sign of petulant ignorance and haughty anger while I went to put distance between Harry and I by striding over to both Hermione, Ron, and their kids with a beatific smile.
I gritted my teeth together, my jaw clamping shut as the muscles there started to strain with how hard I was grinding my teeth together, the irritation and heat flooding my system in time with the sudden rushing pulse of my heart.
With Catia being involved in the conversation, he had simply looked over at his boyfriend and gave Sirius a shit eating grin alongside Hermione, both of them deciding to help me piss Harry off even though they knew they could potentially get murdered by the Assassin himself.
Hell yes, I wanted to have sex. I just felt wrong having sex with someone who was under the influence of a drug basically, but since Harry was self conscious enough to voice his consent to fucking me and it will lead to him calming down, then we were both in the clear of giving permission to have sex on both our ends.
“I waited for you guys for an hour after I gave you specific orders to come here immediately,” Hezian choked out irritatingly, a vein evidently popping out of his forehead from the strain of his annoyance with both Harry and I as he gave us a sharp hawkeye look with the narrow set of his blue eyes.
Following Granger’s gaze, I caught sight of Harry standing absolutely still in the throng of slowly decaying bodies, the Carbonou creatures simply passing him by as if not once noticing the Chosen One that stood impeccably still, green red eyes taking in the state of the room with a malignant calm that was unnerving.
And with learning how to hone my skills to a fine point, I had enough confidence to use my magic the way I wanted to next.
“What makes you think you can order me around-” I yelped out, mouth dropping open to release a scorched whimper when a gust of air, hot and sizzling with pronounce energy skewered into and around me.
Looking up at Hezian from beneath my lashes, I finally replied to his proposition, my heart giving a rather harsh thud against my rib cage as I sucked in a large amount of air to give me enough energy to speak my words. “I’ll give you the money. You stop Animadverto and keep me safe and we’ll have a deal.”
Harry’s magic liked mine because of the purity it held despite the dark magic I was born with, like two sides of a coin, it got the best of both and I was like a meal to it.
Erus tugged my head back viciously, his other hand slamming down into the small of my back at the same time my arsehole quaked with terrifying need and a sudden slicked juice that massaged the inner walls of my hole, warm and tantalizing.
Harry ticked his jaw around my neck, capturing me and holding me hostage in the stabbing maw of his mouth while I writhed across the floor as my body fought itself in its need to run as far away from this avaricious, harsh man or to give into the salacious scorch he induced over and in me.
I missed him. I yearned for my Harry and I couldn’t do anything but try and survive and get to him because it was surely damn near impossible to find me with a powerful demon as my capture.
Blaise had caught her easily, my eyes catching the way his hands seemed to have magnetized themselves to the bum of Pansy’s cheeks with a ferocious grab that bordered on
Did Potter see the mark on my back? The Gryffindor didn’t say anything regarding the emblem branded into my skin so perhaps he didn’t catch sight of it fast enough when he spoke out to me and I turned too quickly around to face him.
Harry gave away a contemplative hum, the undertone a mixture between sick delight and utter adoration.
The illuminate glow of his blood red and dewey green grass eyes were shrouded with a dark undertone in the way he hooded his gaze in a relaxed manner that made him look all the more charismatically tantalizing.
There are too many layers to a single being, it’d take an eternity and more to find out the perspectives of oneself. I have personalities that come and go like it was the changing of seasons, to dark and light and the grey field in between.
I gave a jerky nod in response, my words shaking as I spoke around a trembling pitch. “It’s the word ‘Puffle’”.
My stupid cock was growing harder by each passing minute, the danger and seduction eluding my body to practically purr in dark delight as well as tremble in anxiety at having so quickly been stripped out of my my pants and being left out to the open.
Harry looked like a predator now, waiting me out and slinking back into that relaxed demeanor of his with the sense of an overwhelming focus settled on my person that made me want to run and hide from this man.
I blinked confusingly, turning my head forward in an action to look elsewhere for the man only to jolt backwards atop of Zereth’s mutilated body when that same man reappeared like a fucking ghost in front of me, his imposing strong body bent at the knees casually. He knelt right over the remnants of the demon’s body without a trace of disgust marring his handsome features. The man’s booted feet squished into Zereth’s meaty flesh, the black blood squelching around his shoes as he leaned all his weight on the balls of his feet to near my body.
Sprinting up the stairs as I passed the people who loitered on the steps, I walked my way up to the second level, my breath leaving my lungs when I saw how much space the floor took up, almost the size of at least two ballrooms, but with the same granite taking up the area of the ground, although bathed in purple lighting instead of red this time, the music blaring comfortably in the shrill numbing panic settling heavy in the quivering of my bones.
“Draco and I are going to stay at your place for a few weeks if you don’t mind. I want no one knowing about this, no one that could potentially bring harm.” Harry’s voice was hard and full, drawing out with a low rumble that was sure to come off as a threat and not belonging to someone that was asking a question.
Harry pressed onto me further, making me release a harsh breath as my back curved even more from the man leaning into me, blanketing me and keeping my body warmed.
“What are you laughing about?” I asked through clenched teeth, annoyed at the man for looking so carefree when I felt like I was one minute away from falling apart with everything that’s happened to me recently.
Harry completely ignored my rant by simply throwing his leg up and over the onyx seat of the bike and settling back against it with a roll of his shoulders, the muscles shifting and becoming prominent from beneath the material of his top as it stretched over the taut of his fit back. Harry watched me from under the smooth and silky strands of his tousled ebony locks, the unnerving glow of his jaded and crimson eyes peering at me with a hooded stare that made me feel flayed and picked apart, my body releasing a shudder at the predatory focus Harry procured upon my figure.
“You want me to put on high heels?” My voice came out in stunted horror, the shrill shriek of my tone echoing throughout the glimmering pink colored dressing room that catered to the hired
Stop. I won’t engage in any fights anymore.” I whispered the words, barely audible to my own ears as my mouth moved the smallest amount with forming the letters.
That was the first time I’ve ever heard Harry stutter as if he was in agonized pleasure, the heat rolling off of his body in large waves while he coveted me like I was something to conquer, an exquisite corruption that had my brain fizzling out and losing all sense of logic.
I was hellbent on getting revenge for myself from the continuous mental torture that I had been put through. I had to kill people, albeit not innocent people, but people nonetheless. Against my own will for the sake of my survival. That had my mentality going off the rails of stability.
I darted out my tongue to quickly swipe the tip of it against the plush of my bottom lip in a way to calm myself down. I noticed the man’s caribbean eyes drag down to my mouth at the action and I silently cursed at myself in embarrassment and anger at making the guy think that I was interested with the way he probably thought I purposefully licked my lips to get his attention.
I was set aflame, my cheeks, neck and the insides of my person boiling with fire, when I felt rather than heard Harry’s vibrating, deep voice slink its way up into the space between my thighs and trailed up to my cock, vicious and commanding. “Now.”
along by the lingerie covered flesh of the brown haired boy’s arse and bring him flush up against the long, lean and muscled, rock hard front of his.
“We good now?” Harry asked in that new found voice of his made up character, dripping with an easy low cadence.
Sounds of slickened human meat sloshing around and squicking about with the wiggling of my long fingers that poked and prodded, moved aside, forced in, and plucked out the intestines with a free abandonment only egged me on to keep going. The man became a shaking spazzing mess before me, the way his mouth released a cacophony of silent yells had my hands shoving further inside his stomach as I released a low chuckle from the depth of my chest.
The room was pitch black, but the shadowed silhouette of the person sitting down and facing me was outlined in an intimidating shape.
smell and taste like it.” His voice roughened then, dropping down into a avid drawl that took out the oxygen in my lungs and strangled the empty of them whole, my breaths stilling in my chest as I stuttered out a nervous sigh.
Whenever I’m scared, I tend to be a bitch just to cover up my fear. I remember my mother and father telling me to never let anyone see how much someone affected me because it shows weakness. My go to method was to become a brat to hide whatever hurt or fear I felt.
If it wasn’t for the subtle breaths he took that showed the movements of his chest, someone wouldn’t have known if he were alive or not.
The blue eyed boss appeared in front of me, a sly smirk playing at his lips as he watched me with an eerie focus.
My thoughts were scattered as my gaze caught sight of two familiar figures to the right of my peripheral view, my mouth slowly parting open on an exhale of a heated, stunted breath as I watched
The man mumbled against the skin of my bared throat as the back of my skull thudded against the wall, his hand around the other side of my neck tightening further with a heavy presence.
My mouth opened on reflex and words spewed forth from my mouth before I could comprehend what I was saying. “Stop thinking that I’m w-weak! I can handle whatever you give me, I can
Without further hesitation, I took the first step on the stairs leading down to where I would be staying for the next two weeks.
Weasley and Granger’s place was cozy. The house was compact though, not leaving much empty space but it was … nice. The place was built up of hard wood on the outside and inside, the colors of fall seeming to take up the space, all warm tones and autumn themed.
I let my fingers curl into the rug beneath me, letting out a light yawn as I tried to fight off the sleep that threatened to consume me from how long I’ve stayed up since the beginning trials of making the kock-out potion. It didn’t help that I was in a warm place and felt safe along with the smell of tasty food lingering from the kitchen where Weasley was cooking.
Harry chuckled lowly, the sound brutal in the way it resonated in my bones while he watched me with those green prehnite colored eyes of his. His voice boomed out over the noise of joyous jeers from the men, silencing them in a split second while he watched me. “Everyone get out. Show’s over.”
After the war, many decided to put aside their differences and accept those who genuinely apologized for their wrong doings while some others hated those who were on the Dark Lord’s side although many of his followers had plead their guilty and asked for forgiveness.
Harry shook his head in response to my plea, huffing out a shaky - seemingly nervous - low chuckle as he gave a gentle press of his lips against the space between my shoulder and neck before bringing his head back up so he could gaze down at me with a sheepish sad grin.
When Catia took me to the club, he taught me a few good moves I had surprisingly perfected in a few hours. I wasn’t going to do anything crazy on the pole, mostly shake my arse, swing my hips back and forth in a figure eight motion with my hands occupying themselves with the pole, stroking and gripping. Catia had specifically told me to imagine myself stroking a damn cock and writhing on top of it with the pole. I was so mortified at his speech that I had turned a bright red and Granger started to splutter in a joyous cackle from watching us in the back room with the club’s practice pole.
“It’s the truth. I jacked myself off so much at the thought of your arse back in Hogwarts that my damn wrist was sore for a good solid two months. Granger thought I sprained it. Fucking Weasley just kept laughing like a damn hyena knowing exactly why I practically broke my wrist whenever I winced with every hand coordinated lesson I took in classes.” Harry’s voice came out in a low drawl filled with dark amusement, rumbling beneath the wide set of his fit chest that rose up and down in steady increments.
Somewhere in the depths of my brain, I knew Draco was hiding behind that bunny sneer of his. And that made me feel like I had some sort of kinship with someone who had to carry so much shite inside themselves like myself. I was fascinated by the blonde, and the stupid loyalty he had for his degrading, piss pile of parents that didn’t deserve an ounce of the love that he so fearfully,
I’ve been a b-b-bad boy! Please, pleaseplease! Let me c-come!” I was reduced to this weakened, wanton thing and I couldn’t prevent it, I was too gone in the haze of my seventh heaven.
I started to repeat my affection for him, a chorus of the phrase “I love you" breathing out of my mouth in a tremulous whisper whenever Harry let me up for air for a small moment before diving in once again and murmuring the same thing in response, the curve of a loving smile forming on his mouth pressing against my lips.
Potter slowly raised his dark brows up at me, flinging the knife up into the air with a blurring motion to catch it without any trouble in between his index and middle finger. A hum that rumbled deep in Potter’s chest teased over my gooseflesh as it filled the tensed silence in the air.
My legs dangled a few feet above the ground from Harry’s hold on me, his arm practically a sitting chair for my arse.
The unbridled horror that cascaded into the space of my gut from the look of the demon’s teeth and unsettling large mouth had made me tremble visibly like a scared little kitten, my brain short circuiting in the face of my fear.
Fuck. I liked the sound of his voice splitting apart and trying to find its way back together like a collapsed glass shard, so very
Harry leaned in, thrusting the meat of his thigh up into the valley of my own, creating a raw friction between my cock and the mattress I splayed out over, causing a stricken high moan to escape the fallacy of my lips, body jolting up the bed as the soft of the Gryffindor’s bottom lip brushed feather light at the skin behind my right left ear, his breaths tickking the flesh there.
But before I could let myself focus on the pain too much and let Zereth do something else to me as I was down, I decided to go for another attack.
My eyes became huge at the way the magic seemed to broil along the skin of my body as something hot and toxic slithered down the flat of my stomach in an inky smokey like filter, wrapping itself around my prodding cock with a vicious squeeze.
I started to pick up my pace, my legs now pumping with blood as I decided to lift my calves faster and started to jog down the street with my heart pounding loudly in my ears and my head dissipating into a pit of mindfuckery.
The assassin snapped his teeth suddenly, so very close to my mouth as the smash of his jaw nearing my face like a hungered predator made my heart jump high in my mouth, out of my quivering lips and onto the floor to run away from me.
My body didn’t feel like my own with all that residual, comdemned magic attaching and mingling itself with my own harsh one. I noticed that this unruly sensation was not that of emptiness, but of non existence. As if I was not here, nor there. I had to learn how to adjust to life after the war again, how to create another mask that hid myself away from others. But Draco made me feel alive when I felt like I wasn’t, the thought of him fire started a reaction of wrong and right within my head and it made emotions I stowed away, burst forth.
I also put on my black coat to cover up the switchblade I put in my front pocket just in case I ran into some trouble.
“I saw Harry walk out towards the backyard. Pretty sure he’s wandering about back there and doing gods knows what,” Hezian intoned nonchalantly, his brows rising up in a look of quiet endearment that clearly spelled out the meaning “I know you want your boyfriend and you were using me to get his attention”.
My fingers, the tips of their softened cool flesh, pressed profusely and lightly over the sleek slate of two formatted controls. The hazed glow of the surface I watched with embarrassingly avid interest played a varying shade of downy glints of rays, the tiniest of silver like wisps of pale phosphorescent polish flickering over the bow of my head in continuous strokes.
It held me down easily, forcing my face forward and into the crotch of the disabled man before me, my mouth fumbling over the unconscious wizard’s groin as I shook my head vehemently in an effort to get my face off of the man’s cock.
There was no strength left in me to rock my hips back against Harry’s cock, but the Gryffindor didn’t seem to mind with the way he kept slapping the sides of my thighs with the violent smack of his one hand and kept the other on my hips to drag me back and forth over his cock, the more calm but deep rasping breaths of Harry’s colliding with my own ragged, panting ones echoing throughout the sadistic air around us.
My mouth opened and closed, the purse of my moistened lips flapping soundlessly as the beating of my rapid heart caused the inner workings of my rib cage to rattle with its profound clatter against my chest, causing my throat to close up in on itself and leaving my voice quiet, my mouth speechless.
I didn’t have much enthusiasm to protest, I mean, I figured the boy already knew that I was starting to like all these dressing up situations with the look he gave me when I took the heels away from his hands.
This was good chance for me to explore what I learned just recently as well as feeling that same exhilaration I got whenever I made a new potion that worked and helped others.
The assassin had the same black blood and guts covering his whole fit frame from the Carbonou I assumed he just killed with the way he had his hand outstretched and clutching the very dismantled, lifeless heart that belonged to the shredded creature. The shadowed dark strands of Harry’s hair was a mess of tousled and disheveled locks, gleaming beneath the equally ink like tendrils of the Carbonou’s entrails that coated the Gryffindor’s lean and muscled body.
Harry was already up and out as well, closing the rustic steel door shut as he turned to me, the silvery strands of the moon’s light slinking through the decaying leaves hanging off the tree branches high over our heads and spreading out over Harry’s fit body, the hue of his eyes peering at me through the strand of his unruly, shadowed hair. “Get up, we have to walk a mile and a half from here to get to my motorcycle.” The assassin’s voice was filled with a void, a deep murmur that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up on end in awareness and heat.
I completely ignored her in favor of not turning into a damn tomato in front of my best friend from her very inappropriate words directed towards my person.
“I’ll be with Draco the whole time he’s going to work on that potion and I’ll be with him when he goes to the bank. Don’t worry though, I’ll use glamour to keep my identity hidden,” Harry’s words were straight to the point and without much inflection in his tone as he drawled out slowly to Hezian, watching his boss with uninterest as he kept talking “and I want half of the money you’re getting out of getting rid of Animadverto.”
The Gryffindor’s body looked strung tight, muscles contracting beneath his shirt as he stood rigid, jaw ticking as the veins in his neck stood out in sharp contrast against the smooth light bronze hue of his flesh. With the stage lights flickering across the people before me, I caught the way Harry’s red eyes seemed to pulsate in a vicious gleam, dark and foreboding as his tall powerful body emitted heat like an incoming sun’s flares straight towards my knelt figure as I tried to keep in time with the song and dance despite my attention veered elsewhere.
The man decided to show up and get me about two hours after Potter left my ass in this dark room. I could tell how Weasley and Potter were friends. Both were bastards that gave no regard for other people. Hell, did they not think that maybe I needed to go to the bathroom or drink water for the past two hours where I was left alone with no way out of this godsforsaken room? They’re lucky that I didn’t.
When the long line of his muscled lean body pressed firmly against the arch of back, I gave out a spasm of sorts, breaths coming out faster by each passing moment as a flood of rousing heat went straight down into my groin and the assassin’s chest pushed me into the mattress even more, Erus’ body burning and scorching me whole from where he shrouded me with his presence, dark and deliciously foreboding above me.
I almost broke my neck when I turned to look back towards the assassin, eyes wide and features pinching into a look of astonished fluster as I gaped up at the man who seemed to look somewhat sheepish of his actions.
My heart gave a slam against my rib cage as I watched, transfixed and fidgeting against the magic holding me up, how Harry bore his gaze into my own.
The vampire’s eyes were now rolling to the back of his head, mumbling incoherently around the rabid foul of his sulfur tinged mouth as Potter penetrated his darkened gaze into the man’s decaying body without a worried furrow in his brows.
, you’re mine too, right?” My voice came out barely in a question, but rather in a deceptively innocent confidence as I rolled my hips back in a figure eight motion with reddened cheeks, my bum rubbing along the length of Harry’s growing hard on.
I took an involuntary step back on instinct, body jerking with the need to run, my breaths coming out in shock as I tried to search for any recognition of the “Harry” that I knew, but there was nothing but primal carnal hard edged focus coming from the man before me.
The sight of the mansions were breathtaking in their thorough cream, matte black and, granite or marble appearance.
Of course, the goblins had no clue that the man beside me was Harry, what with his appearance having changed with the glamor spell the Gryffindor cast upon himself to keep his identity hidden as I went to get the money for Hezian to use to get one of his assassins into Animadverto.
If mother knew about my weird infatuation with a harsher play of sex, I would have been carted off to the nearest religious affiliated wizard school so I could be washed off of my filthy fantasies with the teachings of proper and normalized affiliations. Mother would have had her pristine face turn purple if she knew her only child and son was gay and got off on the thought of being fucked until I bled.
The voice that came out of Harry’s mouth was almost demonic in the way it pitched an octave lower than usual, reminding me of the thunderous lull of an incoming storm. “Open your mouth.”
My attention was diverted elsewhere when the crowd of killers parted just the tiniest amount to let a man walk through.
And couldn’t help but start laughing out of the pure insanity that just came out of Harry’s mouth, a bubble of affection and astonished fearful audacity from everything that was
I was dropped onto my weakened my feet in a blurred motion, the people around me seeming to become statues as I stared at how their bodies stopped mid motion in any sort of movement they made, as if they were caught and trapped in a certain time inflection. The music having stopped playing as well.
“Ngh! A-Ah!” Incoherent words were babbling out of my mouth when Harry thrust his two fingers back and forth into the gape of my lips, the motion similar to that of fucking as I was being made to take in the assassins penetrating appendages without protest, the musky taste of his flesh warm and intoxicating on my tongue.
“I’m going to come. I’mcomingI’mcomingI’mcoming!” My voice was shrill, panicked in the shock of my arousal as Harry simply yanked me forward in time with his upward, brutal thrust that slammed so deep into me that the the whole of my body had started to convulse as my hole sucked down over the girth and length of Harry’s dick while the penetrating meat of the assassin’s shoved even
The sound reverberated around the whole of my frame, low and etched in dripping animalistic cruelty that caused me to claw my nails into Harry's jean clad knee, a small gasp leaving my mouth at the sinister, inhumane noise he let out.
Besides, I’m always in potential danger since I was someone who was widely hated. I’m surprised I haven’t been killed yet from all the threats and spiteful looks I endure throughout any normal day of mine.
Potter’s red green eyes illuminated from beneath the strands of his dark hair as he watched me silently, as if challenging me to speak out of turn.
Heat coiled tight in the hollow of my gut, warmth spreading down my thighs to sluice in between and play over the twitching of my groin.
I stood where I was, beside an artistic painting that looked like complete utter shit with its drawing of the French Revolutionary war.
I could ask Harry about whatever I wanted to know, the questions that have been shoved to the far back of my mind that all dealt with Harry finally getting answered. I tried to rid my mind of any questions that involved the assassin because I thought that I would never find out the answers to them.
Harry kept murmuring down incoherent comforting words into the top of my head, his heated mouth pressed against my hair as he kept laying one kiss after another over it softly and repeatedly.
I saw with every human Zereth dumped at my feet the way the demon slouched and breathed deeper and more profound, the subtle quake in their brows as they tried to keep their features from showing the exhaustion plaguing their body when they would unchain me from my shackles and demand me to kill quiet noticeable.
I watched Harry sit across the edge of the silken bed in the room with his knees spread apart in a laze like position, his back hunched over as he tilted his upper torso forward, the stretch of his T-Shirt curving deliciously over every dip of the assassin’s lean muscles, both his elbows resting on his knee caps. Harry’s hair fell forward with the motion, pitch black and disheveled as the tousled locks licked deliciously against the curve of his sharp cheekbones, golden skin humming with ominous power.
After eating and drinking a large amount of water, I had wandered off back into the room I declared my own to look through the shopping bags for some pajamas. The clothes that Granger chose were rather exposing compared to the ones I had at home and different from my regular taste, but I was grateful nonetheless and knew that shopping tomorrow for my own clothes will do me some good.
I … I got off on it, I liked the danger, I liked the fucked up shite because I had some seriously mentally screwed up aspects to myself as well and the knowledge that Harry had the guts to show others, and most specifically
My arousal was slowly going down, the realization about this being such an important aspect of a mission causing me to deter away from the heat that I felt to let me take into serious countenance of the things happening around me. I couldn’t get hot and bothered by Harry even though if I so much as looked at the Gryffindor, my cock would perk right back up in interest. I had to be a professional, like the assassin in front of me. This was all just so new and being around Harry was making the usual composure of mine and my emotions, go haywire.
I was a 23 year old virgin and I didn’t mind it, but being in an area where there was nothing but sex going on around me made me feel like a child in a room full of adults, inexperienced and naive.
Trying to push away the urge to take a quick turn on my heel and start booking it out of this white washed pristine room with no such windows whatsoever, I forced myself to keep my feet rooted where I stood.
And Neville just stared right at me with golden eyes piercing into my narrowed gaze, tossing the bag of drugged gummy foods in his hands with that easy calm grin of his that I wanted to slap off of his striking face.
Looking down at myself with a wriggle to my nose at my glitter induced attire, I wandlessly conjured up my magic to rid myself of the pesky things to once again look as I had before.
It was now my turn to interrupt the twat’s words, my teeth clenching together in irritation and the need to hide away from everyone with how my day’s been going. I wasn’t going to be taking shit from someone right now. Thank fuck my hard on was gone though, being mad and showing my arousal didn’t make me look as bitchy as I would like.
I made the man jolt start back into a subtle state of conscience as I forced a potions spell made up of morphine through his body with my magic, his gaze bleary while he blinked profusely up at me as I stared down at him with a low chuckle leaving my lips.
I raised the tip of my middle finger, precarious and trembling, to press the appendage against the mark over my neck, an exhalation of bewildered uneasiness skating over the cool of my skin.
A keen left my mouth at the filthy words the Gryffindor spoke out loud, him calling me  a “whore” doing nothing but quickening the rush of blood to my perking cock and infusing gas to the fire growing within my quivering chest.
The Gryffindor’s cheeks were tinted with a light flush, as if he had been running for quite some time, heat slipping out of every pore of his flesh in rolling waves like the flares of the sun’s flames.
And when my eyes swept over the tall frame of the Assassin’s, I let out a small whimper of realization to what I just did when I caught sight of Harry’s large bulge pressing against the confines of his jeans.
Frowning back at myself, I twisted on my heel to make a fast walk out of my bathroom to the bag of clothes waiting for me to rummage through.
My magic came to life, some of it slipping passed the glistening sweat of my fingers yanking on Draco’s thigh as I kept fucking into him and felt my cum ooze out of his cherry, abolished hole, the line of my back going rigid as I bared my teeth at the sky and gave a sharp smile at the ceiling of my mansion in the daze of both the power and my coming dancing together with a wild, disturbing presence.
I’ll just have to learn how to work with it's wrong intentions in my own way, just as Harry does with his own dark magic and the others’ he’s collected.
Harry’s eyes followed where my gaze briefly went and his grin widened even more, so depraved and seductive that my brain melted from my skull and pooled around the sprawl of my chest against the ground, disintegrating and leaving me breathless as I went rigid in anticipation for the Gryffindor’s response to my weird mark. “I-I don’t know what that mark is. O-Or who put it on me.” My words were choked out and breathy, hot and bothered all at the same time.
step foot out of this guestroom.” Harry’s response made me whip my head towards him in time to see his back turn to me, the tall of his frame seeming to fill the room as he started towards the living area.
at the quick motion of the assassin’s slapping impact crashing over my pucker and making my front bounce up over the stairs hard enough to drag the perky points of my nipples across the ground, scraping them in a smooth fixation as I let out a breaking gasp at the
I tilted my head back, gritting my teeth together in frustration from hearing the vampire’s screaming and doing what Harry was silently demanding me to do.
When I got about an hour and half into making the “Knockout Potion” as I have so creatively named it, I had
I went to reach for my switchblade in my jeans pocket but halted when I realized that Potter fucking took it from me not a while back.
Flicking the tip of my tongue over the skin of my bottom lip, I started towards the portal, rather warily, as Weasley held it open for me by the swishing rotation of his wand. I could make out the tiny drop of sweat gathering at his forehead.
But Harry didn’t let me keep the thin layer of a mental shield I put up between us right at this moment, because the Gryffindor tightened his hold on the sides of my jaw and sharply dug the blunt of his nails over the curve of my arse cheek and inner thigh with his other hand, making me cry out in frustrated slumbering lust.
It felt like I was floating above my existence, an out of body experience that was consumed by the menacing, Stygian force of harry’s hands and presence.
There was an irritating spew of words that streamed out of Kikue’s mouth, one after another in annoying giddiness that my ears had sheltered out of my head, leaving a muffled murmur in its wake as I ignored the Japanese boy’s hyper chatter and kept the red green hue of my gaze upon Draco’s figure.
Breathing in lungfuls of air, I tried to calm the fast beating of my heart against my rib cage as I watched Granger do a series of thorough spin kicks against a Carnobous’ head with a sickening
Just as I was once scared of losing control of my magic, I was now staring at my lover who had lost control over his own.
The Gryffindor rolled his eyes at me, letting out a “tsk” in reprimand. “I’ve been experimented on with potions before, kind of had to as a test to become an agent here, to see how much your body can handle and how you yourself can get out of the situation the potion put yourself in. So I really don’t mind you testing your potions on me.”
” Harry responded to my scream of his name with the low drawl of dark, heated amusement, not waiting for my reply when I felt another sickening crack of his palm splitting the skin on my right arse cheek that made my back bow down like I was a bundle of string ready to break apart by the swishing blade of a sharp knife, the strike so fucking violent that I could feel the skin of my bum hum with a burning throb and the flesh there tearing apart the slightest bit.
My cum was splattered across the navel of my flat stomach, covering the pristine marble floor in pearly white droplets.
But now I practically had to with my front pressing up against Harry’s hard one, my breaths coming out in fast increments as I moved my body along with the music, rolling and grinding against the man as I circled my hips over him and felt my prick brush up against his abdomen at the same time my arse rubbed along the tops of his thighs.
Letting out a sigh, I flicked my gaze over to the muggle TV plastered to the wall opposite from my bed, the screen large and pitch black, showing the silhouette of my person sitting crisscrossed over my bed.
All this hysteria playing inside of both my mind and body, made me not think twice when I gave Harry a look of offended outrage, any logical thought to keep any emotion masked on my own face thrown out the window when I was dealt with such an
Pushing the flat of my hands across the gloss of the warm floor, I heaved up into a wobbling stand on the weakened limbs of my legs, huffing out an annoyed breath as I twisted my body to the left and started to walk into a small room in the corner of the foyer, somewhat closed off and hidden beneath the shadows dancing in the dark air of the mansion.
And there’s a reason why I wear such a coverage of clothes, the more I didn’t look like Draco Malfoy, the more I wouldn’t be put into danger if anyone noticed me and decided to take their anger out on my person.
Sirius looked like he was in heaven what with the low lidded stare he gazed out towards Catia with as my cousin’s hands wandered teasingly over his boyfriend’s exposed thighs, squeezing and grinning like a damn love sick fool.
Taking a predatory stalk towards my figure with one leisure like step after another, Harry rounded my frame, eyes darkened and his tall and lean muscled body circling me with a sinister observation to stand directly in front of me. Harry lilted his head down so the black tendrils of his hair fell into the glow of his red green eyes that bore down on me, my breath catching in my throat when the man kept my gaze on his penetrating ones from underneath the dark of his black lashes as he bent at the knees and knelt before me.
I harrumphed down at Harry, cheeks filling up with air as I tried to keep hold of my agitation with the Assassin but was failing nonetheless with the undeniable fact that I couldn’t stay irritated at Harry for the life of me.
“How about I bring you along with me on a mission? You can kill the person I’m assigned to exterminate.” Harry’s words made me rear my head back in surprise, my mouth parting open a bit as I stared at the assassin with a befuddled look.
A frown tugging annoyingly at the curve of my lips, I let the flutter of my lashes open and close rapidly as the bright lights of my room beamed down over my sprawled figure laid out haphazardly across the mess of my bed sheets that tangled together with my limbs.
The mark appeared at the end of the trial with the Ministry of Magic regarding my imprisonment in Azkaban.
I kept ducking my head, peering my eyes up through the strands of my unruly hair to check if there was the familiar tall, lean and muscled figure of Harry’s mingling about on this floor, a sense of unease, worry and adrenaline burning itself into my limbs at the thought of running into the Gryffindor.
Pressing my lips together, I decided to ignore the sharp pain sluicing into my stomach at Harry’s answer. The Gryffindor said his answer with a quick quip, as if he didn't want to talk about the reason for my bruise.
The heavy focus of my low lidded gaze flickered from one end of the screen to the next, fingers tapping away in an erratic blur of movement at the smooth crimson buttons of the pitch black Nintendo Switch perched precariously within my energetic hands that hovered over the sleek, mahogany shade of the dining table that I occupied in the early embers of a slow spring seasoned morning.
“I walked into the wrong room, now if you excuse me …” My voice drifted off into a soft exchange of words, about to turn my attention away from both the men and the prying eyes and ears of the other guys surrounding the table only to hear Harry respond and cause my body to grow rigid in hearing his words.
I had no way of getting any information on Potter. I contained no form of magic to help me sneak into places that could have a semblance of history involving the Gryffindor after the war, and consideirng everyone hated my guts, I don’t think I’d be helped either.
was one of the most famous book and magazine publishing companies known in the wizarding world. The fine gold trimmed calligraphy embedded itself above the large, polished red wood doors that were a sharp contrast with the buildings blackened walls. The company already passed its 600th year anniversary and it kept up with its good business deals as well as getting new up-coming authors more exposed to the public eye.
Harry gave me a bland look in return, the sharp set of his features relaxed as he lazily gazed back at me with the glow of his red green eyes from where he had his fit body sprawled out across the couch in the lab once again.
“Fine. I’ll have you come over to test the potion to see what happens here in an hour after I get the concoctions done.” I mumbled my words towards the Gryffindor, turning my attention away from him again as I let him go back to his reading and started to mix and mingle the colorful liquids together and stir them in the directions they’re instructed to be swirled in. Giddy to have my wand back from Harry since he had given me it once we entered the lab with easy trust.
The taste of Harry’s fingers were musky and intoxicating, the appendages spreading the sides of my cheeks out as they flickered over my tongue while he had my mouth in a vice lock to keep me from moving my head any which way, a pathetic whimper ripping itself out of my vocal chords as my hands whipped up to grapple at the width of Harry’s warm wrist and pierce my nails into his tanned flesh there.
I remembered how I fought Zereth and got him on his back long enough for me to take advantage and tear into his guts with my magic. I remembered being so drunk off of my own power high that I had lost myself in the joy of killing the demon and how my resentment towards the suffering I had been forced under by the demon was so large that I could almost
I waved my hands in front of my face, feeling heat broil my cheeks as I dropped my fork in my fit of panic and heard it clatter to the floor with my eyes large and ashamed as I felt the heat of my cock thrum with blood at the pure
” Harry’s voice came out in that low timbre of a tone of his, vibrating the inner workings of my chest as I gasped into Harry’s mouth, my lips falling open as I shivered from the demanding drawl of the assassin’s lips working over my own, impending and dark in the way they forced my mouth open for his to take.
Staring at the envelope in my hand with a small pout to my lips, my brows furrowed as I remembered what Andrew ordered me to do.
!” I was being a little shit with my little outburst, body growing heated as I started to push against Harry in frustration.
Snuggling against the assassin, I felt both of us drop down, my arse now released from Harry’s grip to settle against Erus’ muscles thighs as he went into a sitting position across a cushioned surface that caused our bodies to bounce a little before settling.
And …  he doesn’t want to do anything with me since, for some reason unbeknownst to me, I would end up hurt.
The line of Harry’s mouth tilted up, so very slow and filled with something that I was scared to admit in the own space of my mind, it was
“Well if you tell anyone what happened, you’ll end up just like your father. In Azkaban and dying there. You know the Ministry would love to put you in that place. They won’t believe you so don’t start thinking that you can tell anyone about this. Get back to being a docile, little kitten and don’t go prying into my business. This never happened.” Potter’s words had come out distant and indifferent, low tone turning into a deep subtle threat.
The fact that Harry was calm helped ease the nerves away from my inner turmoil from all the fuckery that just happened.
Harry hummed lowly beneath his breath, the darkened tint of his green eyes bleeding into the red significantly as I felt the Gryffindor’s hands come up to rest on both sides of my hips to twist me like a rag doll around on his lap, making my thighs spread out over each side of his spread legs while I completely faced him now, my chest pressing along his own.
I couldn’t help the startled whimper when the damn man slotted the muscle of his right thigh between my legs, spreading me open and nudging against the sensitive underside of my balls and perking cock. With my cheek pressing into the blankets, I blew out harsh breaths from my pursed mouth, blowing the stray strands of my pale hair away from my widened eyes.
And despite my not wanting to have to do anything else with this secret assassination organization, I didn’t want Harry killing the damn boss of this institute.
Sirius Black stared down at me with a light uptick of his lips, the sharp features of his cheekbones and jawline more prominent than the last time I saw him. The man was as tall as my father was, perhaps a little bit taller, with his broad shoulders and lean and muscled body seeming to fill up the entrance way of my room. Sirius had the curls of dark, smoky black hair falling to his shoulders in wispy curves, mussed and roughened. The steel gray of his eyes were heavy and focused on my person, shadowed and watching in silence.
Harry spoke out once again, the sound of my name hot and heavy like melted brown sugar from the curves of his lips, causing my heart to splutter beneath my chest.  “Take your shoes off, Draco. Don’t want them getting wet now, do we, Princess?”
Without my pride getting in the way of things, my body had moved on it’s own, a yearning having been buried deep inside of my suffering gut finally leaking forth as I shamefully raised my arms up towards the Gryffindor and let out a choking sob as I wiggled my fingers his way in a display of broken neediness that I’ve never shown to anyone in my life, not even my own father and mother.
And the pressure it created shook in its intoxicating power within my mind when a voice that wasn’t my own, ricocheted off of the walls of my head and echoed within my ears, causing me to jolt on the spot where I stood and my eyes to turn into massive saucers of befuddled shock.
My chest rose and fell with air, my person dry heaving abruptly. Planting my trembling hands over the bare skin of my thighs as my breaths scattered from my mouth in a too fast rhythm, my throat let out this high pitched wheeze as the pungent smell of rustic, metallic blood flooded my senses and made my head sway in a tizzy.
He fucked me out, dicking me down and form fitting me to his cock like he was shaping me into his own fleshlight, my arse in pain from the abuse it was being put under while my prostate was weeping from the constant jab upon its heated point while my cum rushed forth and soaked the fabric of my skirt some once again.
A voice boomed from outside of my studio, puncturing through the quiet surrounding me. “Malfoy, open the door.”
I figured out soon why Caetia wanted me to wear a blood red laced thong that he had bought a couple days ago and hadn’t worn yet. If I had worn anything else other than a small scrap of panties, than the tight pants would have shown my underwear and that would have made me look more ridiculous than I already felt. It took about ten minutes for Caetia to convince me to put the underwear on though.
you’d name your bike after a world wide known criminal from a muggle movie and the very embodiment of death itself from Greek myth. Now that we got the name of your bike out of the way, can we find another way to-”
And I laughed as Hermione barreled towards me, shoving Harry away nonchalantly off the bed as if he was a child while he tried getting up and out of the way.
Sucking in my lower lip, I looked up at Harry from beneath my lashes, inhaling a shaky breath to calm myself down as I pushed myself up on the flat of my feet and gave the Gryffindor a soft “Okay” in response.
Harry had simply reached out for my fisted nervous right hand with his own to interlace our fingers together with the hot heavy press of his palm against mine, curling his fingers into my hand and slotting them together perfectly before bringing them both up to press our intertwined hands together over the naked flesh of his chest right above his heart.
Harry moaned lowly, the sound heated and pained it seemed as he watched my head loll to the side with his ominous gaze, a growl rumbling deep in his throat as he released a litany of the the word “fuck” over and over again in darkened awe at my given state.
Who was the one that just talked to me through a weird mind telepathy link? Was it that Carbonou creature?
“Do care to remember if you ever do that monstrosity of a teleportation technique on me again. I don’t appreciate not being warned about my insides getting jostled around like a game of scrabble,
Harry was already powerful enough to do wandless magic at such a young age to transfer his own godfather to another territory without Bellatrix or the other death eaters having known about it. The Gryffindor had fooled everyone into thinking that Sirius was dead with his mourning attitude and somber expressions.
I jerked on the spot when the purring of Harry’s motorcycle died down and left me tingling from its repercussions that started from the curling of my toes and to the tip of my buzzing head.
And Caetia was trying to calm me down enough to encourage my arse to get on the hell out of here and have some fun.
Despite my all knowing justified morality, it seemed I’ve gained a lack of empathy for the demon. It wasn’t a good being. So I didn't have to be good to it and Harry didn’t have to either.
I was absolutely flustered and mussed up from our make out session and the Gryffindor didn’t seem done with me at all.
The next chapter will come out when I catch up with some of my other works in progress, but it won't take forever. I promise. So look forward to the next chapter! Go forth!
What doesn’t make any sense was why the voice speaking inside of my head had warned me about a Sinister coming after me?
“So you want to tell me why you weren’t cuddling me when I first woke up?” I intoned softly, my voice a subtle murmur towards Harry.
“Don’t worry about anything happening to you here. You got two very powerful wizards with you and we wouldn’t put you in any danger. Harry would kill us and we like you despite you being a git sometimes. You can trust us, Draco,” Granger smoothly spoke out, causing my body to grow ridiculously relaxed and fill with appreciation at hearing the redhead’s words.
I would think the man would be jealous with the fact that I found him attractive in his new body but he wasn’t. Instead, he was taking immense pleasure in making me blush ten fold with his fresh look.
Throughout the agonizingly repressed desire to carve Draco inside and out as my own since the war, I had resigned myself to only keeping watch of the pretty blonde. During the late nights of self deprecation of my own unbecoming, my mind often wandered over to the way Kitten’s arse bounced in those tight uniformed trousers. The fabric of those pants stretched obscenely tight over Draco’s oblivious movements, material clinging to the flesh of his perky arse as he walked by me to get to wherever uptight, educational event he had to get to when we were in school.
“Don’t know.” Potter’s answer came out with a sharp husk, causing me to look over at the Gryffindor once again as his face shuttered, as if he was shutting down any walls that were a breadth open, his features shifting into a cold mask.
Harry and I weren't friends. I didn’t know what the assassin and I were. But most of the time, with the way Harry was so cold to me, he didn’t seem like an acquaintance.
Before I knew it, I had suddenly felt the soft drops of my tears fall from my widened eyes and over the black duvet that covered me.
Harry was silent beside me, the warmth of his body radiating towards me like the surface of the heated sun. I couldn’t hear any sound come from the sudden opening of the steel doors, my eyes widening when I took in the black of the whole room that looked to be the size of two mansion like ballrooms, decked out in low lighting like the bulbs that hung above my head in the hallway we recently walked through. Except the lights that made the shimmering obsidian walls and floors of the area were made up fireballs instead, flickering flames that brightened and dimmed the entirety of the room yet lighting the way in a soft, seducing luxury.
Whipping my gaze down the expanse of my form, my mouth parted on a slight intake of a surprised breath.
When I didn’t hear any response, my mouth turned down into a confused frown as I rolled my bottom lip into my mouth so I could scrape the edges of my teeth against the plush of the skin in a restless action.
My body warmed with an entanglement of alarming volatile warmth that spread out over the trembling of my thighs and fear induced hysteria at the way Potter’s body had a relaxed vehemence with his actions.
I waved them off with a swift wiping gesture of my hand as I turned to look out at the city below. “No need to invite me, I’d like some rest anyway. I’ll see you tomorrow, Granger. Now if you two would get out of here, I bid you farewell.”
your mind running a mile a minute. I’ll answer the questions you’ve got once we get out of here, but only if you do as I say now because anytime soon, we’ll be in the same situation we were in just a few minutes ago. So you're going to do as I told you to and follow me out of here.” Harry’s honey slick voice dripped with malicious intent, a demand evident in the contours of his voice as he spoke his last sentence, not sounding like a question at all with the inflection in his words.
My ears were loud in the ringing of my seventh heaven echoing within the hollow of my hearing beating in time with the abnormally fast pulsing of my heart as I was being bounced up and down across the floor with each violent pierce of Harry’s large, burning cock.
The sky above me was encased in wisps of smokey grey films, puffs of cotton ball clouds gathering high above my head as a moistened, warmed breeze swept around the flair of my short skirt, ghosting across my bare legs and shoulders.
The women that literally came out of the dark wall, wore tight black skinny leather pants with high crimson kissed red heels and a laced corset that shown off the voluptuous curves of her tall, model like figure. The sheer material of the corset shown bits and pieces of the skin of her breasts, dusky nipples poking through, exposed and taunting whoever they caught the attention of.
