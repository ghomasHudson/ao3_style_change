He heard the bell chime over the door. Damn. This was the worst time for a customer. He was about to shout that he just needed a few minutes (three minutes and fifty-three seconds, to be exact) when he heard Dai call, “Don’t stop what you’re doing, love, it’s just me!”
"Yes," Draco sighed deeply. This was all so fucked.
“Hello, Mr. Iraklidis,” Draco said as he shook the potioneer’s hand.
“Malfoy,” Harry nodded. “Nice place you have here.” He looked around the shop, took it in.
“Harry,” she said.
“That’s quite a bit of history. Please, can you tell me, how did you feel about Harry when you were in school? How did you become enemies?,” Dr. Ducharme asked, biro poised over her notebook.
Draco sighed. “Well, he and his friends were captured at one point, and were brought to my house. Everyone knew that Harry, Ron, and Hermione were on the run together and, by sheer luck, the death eaters captured them. But Harry was disfigured when they brought him in; his face was swollen, almost unrecognizable. Hermione had hexed him, to try to alter his appearance to protect him. So my aunt wanted me to identify that it was him, that we’d captured Harry Potter, before she called lord fuckface.” He pushed his glasses up, pressed his fingers to his eyes.
Dai had asked Draco to come with him. Draco couldn’t, not yet.
Draco stared at the ceiling, followed the charmed Quidditch player that was flying erratically from where he laid on the woven rug.
Draco opened his mouth to thank him, but instead, he found himself saying, “You know, you wounded me terribly on the Hogwarts Express our first year. I wanted to be your friend. But you rejected me in favor of Weasley.” He smiled, a little sadly. “I suppose it was better for everyone that you did, knowing what a little bastard I was back then, and how I’d do almost anything to please my father. You were right to stay far away.” He paused, twirled his biro. “Especially after what he did to Weasley’s sister second year. I’m not sure he knew that Riddle’s diary would try to murder a little girl, but Lucius was always good at feigning ignorance.” Draco tried for a small smile, but it felt more like a grimace.
“Couldn’t sleep,” he answered as he stubbed his cigarette out in the ashtray on the floor next to the bed. He rolled over to face her, leaned his forehead against hers, stroked his hand up and down her side.
She hadn’t understood.
“Good one, Uncle Harry!,” Teddy yelled when Harry made a triple play, exploding several cards at once. Harry may or may not have boosted the explosion with a wordless firecracker charm.
Three Years Before
When Harry hadn’t come back by midnight, he firecalled Ron and Hermione. Hermione answered, hair pulled back, in sweats and ready for bed. Draco was frantic. He knew something was wrong. Harry wouldn’t just leave. Hermione called for Ron, waved Draco through. Ron caught him when he stumbled into their living room.
Draco ignored the voice that whispered, deep inside: he still lived by Harry's advice.
"Just lamenting the fact that I've gone my whole life without drenching my chips in vinegar. All of those wasted chips. A tragedy," Draco smiled back.
“So you… you had to leave? Without saying anything? Harry… that was. It was cruel.” Draco’s voice cracked.
But then, he always had.
Draco raised an eyebrow. Gone for three years without a word, and all he got was
Got the wind knocked out of him.
He finally looked up. “Fuck me, Harry.”
Draco sat in one of the wingback chairs by the fire. Crossed his legs, plucked at the crease. Held his hand out and accepted the cup from Harry. Took a sip and glared at him, clearly annoyed Harry remembered how he took his coffee. Harry smiled to himself as he took a sip of his own, black and sweet.
He had Draco.
at the table, reducing it to splinters. Blind with fury, he made his way through the ground floor, slashed lines across the walls with his wand, ripped art off the walls, smashed picture frames. He stormed upstairs to their room, shredded the bed, the pillows, the curtains.
He missed his friends, his family. The one he created when he was eleven with Ron and Hermione, and the one he made later, with Draco.
“Sorry, love, I didn’t. What were you saying?,” Harry asked.
He wasn’t surprised the jeweler recognized him. Harry nodded and held out the letter. “I received this from you earlier this evening. I believe it’s a mistake. I didn’t order a ring.”
Maybe it wasn’t a failure. Maybe it was just over.  He nodded stiffly. “OK, then. Forgiving myself. How do we do that?”
"C’mon, Malfoy, I'm not asking you to marry me. And you live in Shadwell, so I know you know about Muggle bars and restaurants. We'd go to one of those, not because I'd be hiding that we were out together, but because who wants the press hounding them on a first date? I wouldn't take anyone to a restaurant in the Wizarding district with me, not until we were actually in a relationship." Harry breathed. He hoped.
He could still breathe.
She studied him for a moment. “Well, then what was the point?”
"Well, I was trying to think of things I'd actively chosen. My life...My life was predestined for a long time. I didn't have a lot of choices. I could only come up with three things. Well, four. But I never got to have the fourth thing."
“Get out,” he whispered, looking down.
He needed to know. To know what it would be like, with Harry. Without the weight of expectations, of fulfilled destinies. To be together as they were. Flawed. Trying their best. Loving each other, despite their bad choices. Because of them.
“I almost owled you a few times. Almost stormed in here, after Ron told me where you worked. But I finally calmed down. Saw reason. Listened to what Ron told me you had said to him. I figured that if you were working and, well, contributing. Maybe that was the best apology I could hope for from you. So, I appreciate the apology, Malfoy. It’s actual years too late, but I accept it. And I do forgive you, even if it’s not my place. I forgave you a long time ago. You made your choices, and you paid for them, more harshly I’d think from your batshit aunt and that crazy noseless fuck than you did from the Wizengamot, if I had to wager a guess. But, well, you seem to be on a better path. And that’s all someone can do.” Harry stuffed his hands back in his pockets and rocked on his heels.
It was almost a relief, in a way, to hear her get mad at him, to stop tip-toeing around him finally, all concerned glances and low murmurs. He looked at her again. Nodded. A mind healer. Moving on. Forgiving himself. Merlin, how? Harry’s words, outside the courtroom, had been his guiding principle for a decade. Your choices define you. It’s not so black and white. He had made better choices. But had he ever forgiven himself for the bad ones? Was Pansy right? Had he thought his best choice, Harry, absolved him from forgiving himself?
She studied him. Stood up and put her coffee on the stool. Walked over to him, invaded his space, pressed her hands to his chest, looked up at him.
Harry was grateful. He was so grateful, every day, that his family, the family he’d created when he’d had none, had forgiven him. He knew now that those relationships were forever; they were unbreakable.
Maybe he didn't want to.
“Come in, my dear boy, let’s go in the back and have a nice chat. Tea?,” he asked as he bustled through a doorway behind the counter.
“I can’t believe you’re asking me to come home with you,” Dai shook his head. “You know how crazy that sounds?”
"What?!," Draco yelped as he sat up. "You told the bloody Sorting Hat—an ancient sentient magical artefact—which house to put you in?"
“What do you want to do for dinner tonight?”
It was awful. Ron and Hermione were horror-struck but calmly competent.
Draco pulled out the chair across from her and sat, crossed his legs. Pulled at the crease of his trousers. Attempted nonchalance.
“I got curry, that OK? Extra naan,” Dai said as he opened the takeaway bag.
He blinked a few more times, shielded his eyes. Looked up.
He fit himself along Draco's side, traced his jaw, looked down into his silver eyes.
Considered his choices.
“I don’t want to hear it, Potter. Whatever self-effacing thing you’re about to say or whatever apology you’re about to give me, I don’t want to hear it. I’d wanted to be friends with you in school, but you had the right read on me from the start. I tortured you for your rejection, and your friends as well. You saw me for what I was, which was a spoilt, nasty child who held a mean grudge. You were always the better man.” Harry opened his mouth again, but Draco plowed on.
He didn’t know if he’d miss her.
He leaned back in, took Dai's face in his hands and kissed him, tasted him. He tasted like vodka and mint, basil and lemon.
Harry couldn’t breathe.
“So you’re planning on staying then?,” Draco asked, eyes narrowed. “Have you seen anyone else?”
“Yes, well, Dobby always was rather meddlesome. He did sneak me sweets, though, when I was being punished. Had to knock his head against the hearth to do it, and I never asked him to, but he always brought a treat to cheer me up.” Draco smiled sadly and looked down at the potion.
His eyes wandered over the imperfections in plaster, the places where the midnight paint had dripped, where the charmed stars sparkled, periwinkle and platinum. He liked this ceiling. It wasn't perfect, but it wasn’t marked with magic gone awry, with a history of—nevermind.
Some love could hurt.
*****
And. A tiny bit of hope. Draco had called him Harry, not Potter.
“What can I do for you?,” he asked, cooly.
Dai had left.
"Left," Draco interrupted again. "He left."
"Good." He paused. "Now, can you start calling me Auror Potter again? I like it when you call me that." Harry's eyes twinkled.
*****
Dai bought him fish tacos and American coffee, craft beer and acai bowls. They laid in bed, wrapped up in each other again, mountain air wafting through the windows, the smell of earth and minerals, oak and dust. Dai was familiar, comforting, beautiful. Draco was happy. But every night, when he drifted off to sleep, he saw bright green eyes behind glasses, a brown hand holding a cup of coffee. A bright smile, just for him.
"So, Draco, if I understand this correctly, you and your partner had been on opposite sides in the war. You were on the wrong side. And he was destined to defeat evil, to win the war, and save everyone. Before that, though, you had both hated each other in school and antagonized one another—"
“I’m sorry, Potter, my mentor isn’t in right now, as I’ve said. I’d be happy to have him look at this when he returns. I’m not sure if you’d be able to—”
“Yes, OK, I see. And how old were you when he saved you? And you saved him. During the war?”
He opened the door.
"But you hated me when we were in school. You especially hated me when we were fourteen; you made all those 'Potter Stinks' badges when I was in the Triwizard tournament. Thanks again for that, by the way. Not like a bloody madman was pulling the strings on that whole fiasco for an entire year,” Harry said, pulling on Draco’s hand.
“I won’t tell him,” he said with a small smile. “As long as you knock off a few hundred galleons, yeah?”
Draco stared at the ceiling. Tried to steady his breath. Inhale for four, hold, exhale for four. Counted, rubbed his hand over the scars on his chest. He catalogued the scuffs and marks on the ceiling. The dark line from a
Harry couldn’t help but stare back.
The bell over the shop door chimed. Draco put a statis spell over the batch of a calming draught he was developing, took off his dragonhide gloves and apron, and removed his goggles. He slipped his waistcoat back on over his shirt, buttoning it as he made his way to the front of the shop. He looked up. Drew up short.
Two years after
” Harry breathed out.
Draco stared at his hand, the one that had just been petting the stag.
" Harry interrupted. His eyes were so green, like a summer field. Draco could get lost in them.
When Draco came home again, heartbroken, it had been hard. Harder than Harry thought it would be.
"Hey, Malfoy," Harry said, softening his voice a bit. "It's OK if you're not interested. I like being around you, working with you. Well, watching you work. And I wondered if maybe I'd like being around you, I don't know. All the time." He shrugged.
He remembered that the entrance to the wizarding area, Piazza della Cerchio, was outside the Uffizi, but couldn’t remember how you got in. He doubted it mattered very much, though; he vaguely remembered that lines defining Muggle and Wizarding society were less rigid in Italy. A Muggle hotel near the Piazza, then.
He couldn’t deal with a broken Draco.
Two Years After
“Hello.” Draco smiled back and handed him his firewhiskey. “Did you hear anything I said, dear?,” he asked as he sat down in the armchair across from Harry’s.
“I didn’t leave because I didn’t want to marry you, Draco. I left because I did,” Harry said, sadly.
“You seem to be placing an adult-level amount of blame on the shoulders of your teenage self. I know it’s quite hard, with hindsight, not to re-examine every bad thing we’ve ever done, to go over how we could have known better, done better, or made better choices. But each of us typically does the best we can with the information we have at the time. Did you make some bad choices? Yes. Were you surrounded by adults who were also making bad choices and encouraging you to do the same? It seems so.” She paused. Draco fidgeted.
“I have to admit, I rather expected a letter or request for a meeting years ago, after you reached out to Ron and Hermione and apologized to them. I was in a bit of a state about it, for a while.” He took his hands out of his pockets, ran them through his hair. “Jesus, Malfoy. You always could get under my skin. I wondered why you apologized to them and not to me. Not after I bloody well testified for you at your trial and gave you your wand back, not to mention saving your sorry arse from that fire. I deserved an apology too. I wanted it. I tried to figure out why you didn’t want to acknowledge the harm done to me, but you could to my best mates,” he huffed.
So he started small. He decided what to eat, every meal, every day. He’d never had to think about it before. House elves had provided meals at both the Manor and Hogwarts. He learned how to shop at Tesco’s, make simple meals.
“Yes, Narcissa, well. Now you’ve seen me. Is there something in particular you want?"
"I'm going to kiss you now," Harry whispered.
“I know,” Draco had sighed shakily. “I know. I’m just going to miss you so much.”
He made his way back to the Leaky so he could apparate to the curry shop near Grimmauld. He felt agitated and wrong. Unworthy and too small. He felt like he was going to jump out of his skin, like his bones were on fire.
Draco inhaled for four, held, exhaled for four. He squared his shoulders, stood up straight. Squeezed Harry’s hand and moved past him. He felt Harry move behind him, over towards Andy, heard him whisper furiously,
Draco walked over to a clean spot on the worktable and exchanged his black-framed glasses for a different pair, ones with different coloured loupes attached, sticking out at all angles. He examined the swirling potion through them. It had medium viscosity but moved on its own, shimmering different colors as it undulated, red and green, gold and purple. Draco hadn’t seen anything like it and, as he held it up to the light, he began lowering the loupes in front of the glasses, in different combinations, studying it carefully.
Draco sighed deeply. “He was famous. He had defeated the Dark Lord as a baby, and everyone knew he would be in my year at Hogwarts. Lucius—my father—wanted me to try to befriend him. Thought that it would be good for the family to have an in with ‘The Boy Who Lived,’” he mimed air quotes. “So I tried to make friends with him on the train to school and, inevitably, fucked it up by making fun of his friend—who, ironically, also became my friend after Harry and I started dating—and he refused to shake my hand. Was a bit of a shit about it, too, frankly, but I rather respect him for it now. He made the right call.”
"Harry," Draco whispered. "Harry, can I?," he tugged at the collar of Harry's leather jacket, the one that had been Sirius's. Harry nodded, and Draco slipped it off his shoulders. Harry reached out and gently pulled at Draco's tan trench coat, letting it fall to the floor. Smiled as he pulled off his own black t-shirt, tossed it to the side. Harry walked Draco back to the bed until his thighs bumped up against it. He cupped Draco's face in his hands again, brought him in for another slow, deep kiss, hissed when Draco traced lines across his back, down his sides, slipped his hands into his waistband again. Everywhere Draco touched lit on fire. Harry was so incredibly, thoroughly turned on. How had he spent so many years without Draco's hands on his body, without his mouth on Harry's? Harry shivered at the thought of more contact, more skin, more. He kissed down Draco's neck, licked across his pulse, down his Adam's apple. Draco tasted sharp, like grey salt, and warm, like honey.
He went back to his flat in Shadwell. He liked being there; it's muggle roots. He painted every room a different shade of blue. Charmed the walls and the ceilings with clouds; birds and stars. He wanted to feel like he was in the sky.
But so did doing the wrong thing.
“Why don’t we go find Teddy, Harry. Give them some privacy,” Andy suggested.
Dr. Ducharme leveled another look at Draco. “A relationship’s success is not dependent on its length. Just because it ended doesn’t mean it failed.”
*****
Three Years After
“I’m just. I’m not surprised. I don’t know what else to tell you.” She set the mug down again. Draco saw that her hands were shaking.
“Why makes you so sure?” Harry was curious.
Dr. Ducharme pursed her lips. “Hmmm, yes. Well, then, you were given a terrible and impossible task, so you didn’t focus on Harry anymore. It was after this that you both saved each other?”
It appeared as though he’d have to try again now.
“I don’t want to make excuses, Weasley. I did terrible things, full stop.”
Before he could think, Harry nodded. Knowlton disappeared through the wall again, and Harry mopped up his face, blew his nose. He was a mess. Draco wanted to marry him. Merlin, Godric, and Salazar too. Draco wanted to
He made the right choice anyway.
Dai was silent, still studying Draco’s face, looking for whatever it was he needed. Draco held his gaze. He knew, after only a few days, to give Dai time. He needed to work through what he wanted to say. Draco could wait as long as it took. Whatever Dai decided. Draco had to ask, no matter the outcome.
He wondered if Draco had moved on. His stomach clenched at the idea that Draco could have someone else, could have a new relationship. He pictured him with someone new, tangled limbs in white sheets. He felt sick. He inhaled his cigarette.
Draco snorted. “No. He had a huge fucking snake that followed him everywhere, and he’d feed people to her. I told you he was fucking dramatic.”
Draco thought about it. “I supposed I did them because I had to.”
“Hey there, bud. How’s it going?,” Harry smiled. Fought the urge to ruffle his hair. It was red and gold today. Harry thought it was odd that Ted had been sporting Gryffindor colors, but he’d been informed, with a teenaged sigh, that they were Iron Man colors, and he had done it for Rose, since it was her birthday and he was her favorite superhero. Harry thought Teddy might have also rolled his eyes while explained it. Harry chose to ignore that.
But Teddy had grown up knowing love. Harry still felt guilty about leaving his godson. Like he’d let Remus and Tonks down. It was fading, but he felt awful about missing so much time. He owled Ted at Hogwarts once a week, now. Even if Teddy didn’t owl him back all the time. He was a teenager, Harry understood. Harry just wanted to let him know he was still here. No matter what.
There was only one other person Harry knew who was that clever. And Hermione had practically fallen off her chair when he'd told her about them. How Draco could identify potions ingredients just by fiddling with the lenses, by sight alone.
He hadn’t expected the mere start of a lecture before Draco practically begged him to leave, on the verge of tears. He looked like he had been crying when he first came out of the backroom. And what had he said? He’d already had his heart broken once today? Harry felt his stomach clench again, jealousy rising like bile. Did Draco have a boyfriend? A...no. He couldn’t let himself go there.
He'd been genuinely shocked when Harry asked him out. Draco never thought that Harry might like him too.
She reminded him of Narcissa.
“You too Jas!” Potter waved slightly and took another sip of his drink. Draco walked her to the door and willed himself not to curse her into the next life.
Both of the meetings weren’t of any interest to Draco and he often found his mind wondering about what Potter was actually asking of him. Was this just a friend thing? Was Draco the only person Potter felt he could trust? He didn’t have a clue and it was just adding to his unnecessary nervousness about the date-that-isn’t-a-date tonight.
“Well I thought that you’d appreciate having the next two weeks free so you could have a proper honeymoon.” This caught Draco’s attention. Honeymoon?
“Of course you wouldn’t like one of the only sophisticated drinks out there.” Potter just ignored him and carried on looking around.
“I had always assumed that you had a brilliant childhood.” Draco admitted, Potter just shook his head again and swallowed his food.
“You could stay for breakfast, I suppose.” He said trying to sound indifferent but Harry saw right through him and smirked. He crawled back on the bed and knelt over Draco. He started to gently wipe Draco’s chest and stomach down and Draco felt his heart swell to about five times the size. Embarrassingly, he felt tears well up in his eyes. He looked down and hoped that Harry hadn't noticed but he felt a gentle hand on his chin and he let his head get tilted back to look Harry in the eyes.
The walk to the lifts had been silent and Potter had ignored everyone that even looked his way. The man usually carried an air of authority but now people were leaping out of his way and almost bowing to him. Draco was sure that he could feel Potter’s magic vibrating off of him and he’d be damned to admit it wasn’t having a certain affect on him.
“It was lovely to meet you Harry! I hope to see you again very soon!” She gave Draco a very meaningful look while still holding a knowing smile on her face.
“Minister now right?” Draco nodded, they would be a bit too early for his liking but he decided to keep his mouth shut for once. Malfoy quickly gathered his notes for Potter to read on the way there. Today had started off so well.
“Ah! I’ve heard a lot about you! I’m Jasmine but everyone calls me Jas.” She knew all about his pathetic infatuation with his boss and had always tried to persuade him to ask Potter out on a date. It had always been refreshing to talk about Potter to someone who didn’t have a clue who he was. But he was now regretting that decision.
“Fuck it… Fine… Me and Ginny broke up on really good terms when she left to go to this intense quidditch training camp thing and since then... every time Wood comes back to London we hook up and then Ron walked in on us having sex on my sofa so he assumed that I was cheating on his sister but since there’s no communication with Ginny and she’s not back for another three months, he doesn’t believe me… and yeah it’s all gone downhill from there.”
“What the fuck!” He turned to see Ron glowering in the doorway.
“Not really, anything that isn’t wine.” Potter called back. Draco snorted as he grabbed his nicest whiskey.
“Piss off.” Draco sighed, not really meaning it. Potter snorted.
Harry Potter was his boyfriend.
Malfoy bowed  “As always, Sir Chosen One.” in which he left and went back to his desk, making sure to firmly close the door behind him. The more distance between the two men, the better. Draco loved to be near that man, he would spend every second possible with him if he could. However, he would rather live out the rest of his days in Azkaban than admit that out loud.
The drinks were poured and they were sitting in Dracos small living room so he decided to just dive straight in.
“I know you’re angry at me but giving me the next two weeks off any assignments is a fucking low move! I said I’m sorry!” Potter’s face went icy.
Potter took a deep breath and his shoulders slumped in defeat. “You busy tonight?” Draco looked up, startled.
Potter rolled his eyes “That’s all you got out of this?”
“I can’t believe I just came in my pants on the floor of my apartment.” Draco was finding this whole situation hilarious. This was not one of the scenarios he had ever imagined getting off with Potter but it was better and hotter than what he could have thought of. Harry rolled off of him and curled into Draco’s chest which he found endearing. He wrapped his arm around Harry and started playing with his hair as he stared at the ceiling and tried to ignore how unpleasant he was starting to feel. The floor wasn’t exactly the most comfortable place to lay. But, Draco would happily lay here for decades if it meant he could hold Harry like this. Harry lifted his head to look at Draco.
Why was this lift taking such a long time?
He shut the door and rested his head against it for a second before daring to ask the next question.
Draco was greeted by Jasmine’s smiling face. Jasmine lived on the floor below and he was good friends with her and her husband, Emir. They often went round each other's place for dinner and they were the closest things to friends that Draco had apart from Blaise and Pansy (and Potter he now supposed).
“Bye Jas!” He called as she waved once more and scurried down the hall to the stairs.
“Have you ever heard of fucking knocking you caveman?” Ron just ignored him and had his eyes set on Harry. Draco was fuming but decided to clear up the mess before it was irreversible.
“No, they were quite well off but honestly they just didn’t like me enough to regularly feed me.” He said it so matter of factly that it actually managed to shock Draco into silence for a few minutes.
“No one’s ever cared for me like that after and…” Harry pulled back to look Draco in the face and brushed his hair behind his ears so he could see better. Draco was hesitant to continue
He should decline Potter and walk away without a second thought.
“Look mate we-” A loud bang (which Draco could only assume was Potter slamming his hand on his desk) cut Weasley off and Draco had to suppress a smile
Potter seemed surprised at that. “You think he’s fit?”
“Oh fuck Harry, please, please, please fuck me Harry.” he moaned, chucking all his self-respect out of the window, throwing his arms out and grasping the sheets in both hands. In return, Harry launched himself up the bed and pulled Draco into a (he almost couldn’t bring himself to think it but) loving kiss as he roughly fucked his way into him. Draco had very conflicting emotions running through his head and he couldn’t bring himself to open his eyes and accept the reality. If this was a dream then he never wanted it to end. He pulled Harry’s hand up to his throat and arched up into his body as he pounded into him. Harry took notice of this and pressed into Draco’s throat, pushing the breath out of his lungs, causing Draco to pant.
They decided to floo back to his place as Draco thought that apparating would do more bad than good to Potter’s emotional state and Draco was determined to avoid any physical contact with him. When they arrived Draco busied himself with getting drinks while Potter looked around his flat. He loved his place and was very proud of what he had done with it. He had moved out of the manor soon after his dad had gone to Azkaban and his mum moved to France. It had been big and lonely and full of horrific memories. This flat was on the border of muggle London and he was actually friends with a muggle couple which he knew would surprise most people who had any preconceived ideas about him.
“Wait, you got married?” Draco had to speak up. Weasley glanced at him but then turned back to Potter.
“So what? I bake sometimes. Piss off Potter!” He snapped. Potter held up his hands in a mock surrender and sat back down on his seat while chuckling and giving Draco a fond look that made his stomach fill with butterflies. Disgusting.
She seemed so excited and Draco was annoyed that he couldn’t find this bloody whisk. He could have accio’d it if he had left her in the other room.
“Of course you need a responsible adult Potter, you’re a child trapped in a man’s body! But I guess being your emotional punch bag is part of the job description at this point. So you’ll pick me up at seven then?” He sneered like it was the most natural thing in the world and hoped and prayed that his cheeks didn’t flush and his voice didn’t betray his nervousness. Potter flashed him a relieved smile and nodded. Draco’s heart fluttered in a disgusting manner and he was surprised that he managed to keep his face stone still. He was a Malfoy. Malfoy’s didn’t get nervous. This was humiliating and degrading and yet another reason to hate Potter… and yet he still didn’t. But Draco made a mental note to go straight to Pansy after work.
“Well I am going to get shitfaced and I need a responsible adult with me and I would prefer it to be you because apparently I don’t actually have any other friends because they’re all shit.” Potter was rambling. When Potter rambles it means he’s nervous. Why was he nervous? Draco was the one who was meant to be nervous! And since when was he considered one of Potters friends?
“Are you ok? I wasn’t too rough was I?” Harry looked so concerned and Draco was so spent and emotionally confused that he started to fully cry. Harry set the flannel down and pulled Draco into a hug while still sitting on his thighs. Draco sniffled and wrapped his arms up around Harry and tried not to think about how embarrassing this was.
“Your day is clear from now and I have plenty of alcohol back at my place, would you care to come and get wasted with me?” Draco’s stomach was twisting with nerves. This was such a bad idea. Blaise would hit him if he found out what was happening. He tried to reason with himself. ‘It’s just a casual few drinks with your boss who is going through a hard time, nothing wrong with that!’ and he tried to forget the fact that he happened to be in love with this man. Potter’s face washed over with relief
“Oh! Hello Head Auror Potter! I am looking forward to your briefing soon Sir.” Draco spluttered out a cough to cover his imminent laughter at Galen’s kiss assing and even Potter had to hide a smirk. He put on his best ‘professional’ voice which Draco found adorably crap
“Yeah, she’s turning nine.” Draco could hear the smile in her voice. He had spent time with Abi when Jasmine was babysitting, they had gone to the park and Drao had pushed the little girl on the swings for hours because of her insistence. He had never had strong paternal feelings, but that short afternoon with the sweet little eight year old had warmed up his icy heart just a little.
“Fuck yes.” They basically raced to the bathroom, leaving a trail of almost ruined clothes throughout Draco’s flat.
“No Potter, it’s a Tuesday, of course I’m not.” He tried to keep the confusion out of his voice. Where the fuck was Potter going with this?
Why was he even considering it?
Harry’s throaty laugh sounded above him as Draco willed his eyes to open.
“Sweet fuck Draco, you’re incredible.” Harry’s voice was shaking and there was sweat beading on his brow. Draco reached up and pulled Harry’s head back by his hair and bit his neck. Harry groaned Draco’s name and he could feel Harry swell and then cum inside of him. Draco wrapped his legs around Harry’s waist as he suckled on his neck, still pulling his hair. Harry was still shallowly thrusting when he collapsed on top of him, trapping Draco’s spent dick between them, causing him to groan from the slightly painful feeling. They both laid there panting, Harry a reassuring weight on top of Draco. Even if he wanted to move, Draco wasn’t sure he could anymore.
“Who was it?” He managed to croak out after a few awkward seconds. Potter looked up briefly and flushed even more red and wouldn’t meet Draco’s eye.
“Of course with you, you idiot.” Harry gently cupped his face and leant down to kiss him lightly. He pulled back after mere seconds and gave Draco a shy grin, wiping the remaining tears away.
“Go.” Potter’s tone left no room for arguments and Weasley accepted his defeat and slowly trudged out of the office. Potter was frozen with his quill in his hand and Draco didn’t like to see the sad look on his face. ‘Screw it’ he thought to himself.
“Hey Draco! Are we like boyfriends now then?” Harry called. Draco couldn’t help but grin as he pulled himself out of bed to get dressed to join Harry in the kitchen.
“Not exactly, he needed a friend and a drink and I have a lot of drink so I invited him over for a chat.” He could feel excitement radiating off her. He knocked over a stack of tupperware and the whisk almost fell on his feet.
“They got married and didn’t even think to tell me.”
Draco snorted indignantly.
“I’d appreciate it if this was never spoken about again.” Draco said matter of factly, sitting down on the other end of the sofa. He quickly swiped his glass off of the table and downed the rest of his drink in one go trying to ignore the look the other man was currently giving him.
“Yeah, I suppose we are boyfriends Harry.” He called back, not even worrying about hiding how happy he was.
“You really need to learn when to put your pretty little mouth to better use sometimes.” Harry muttered as he kissed down Draco’s needy body. He wrapped his hand around his quickly hardening cock as he took Draco’s tip into his mouth. Draco’s body arched into the other man's fondling.
He grabbed two fistfuls of Harry’s hair when the man sucked him all the way down as he slipped a finger inside of him. Harry muttered a spell and Draco’s hole was slick once again. He was still fairly stretched from last night and it burned just in the way he liked as Harry scissored him open.
“Cum in me Harry, please.” His nerves were on fire from overstimulation but he so wanted to be good for Harry, he wanted this to be the best Harry had ever had.
He finally had to confront Potter’s raised eyebrows and amused smile on his face as he looked at Draco and Jasmine standing in the entrance way talking. Draco didn’t need to use legilimency to take a guess at what Potter was thinking.
He continued “I would also like more… from us. Together. If possible.” It was Harry’s turn to sound nervous now.
“We broke up probably about five months ago but he only found out last month. He didn’t exactly find out in a great way and hasn’t been happy with me since.” This was even more intriguing. Draco didn’t regret this idea anymore. Getting Potter drunk and having him spill his secrets was the best thing Draco had ever done.
“Look, it’s a bloody simple question. I need to talk to him and finding out his schedule is kind of your job isn't it?” Malfoy rolled his eyes and made a huge display of pulling himself up from his chair.
“Hi! I’m Harry, Harry Potter.” He gave the woman a charming smile and she shook his hand and turned to look at Draco with her eyebrows raised as she clocked the two glasses of alcohol on the table.
“I clean.” the other man offered. He obviously saw the confusion on Draco's face and elaborated
“I’ve woken up so many times throughout school and realised I had come in my pants because of a dream about you.” This stirred something inside Draco once again. He couldn’t believe that Harry’s school experience had almost exactly mirrored his in that sense.
Draco found himself hesitantly nodding. “Yeah, after the war I found that I had a talent for cooking, especially cakes and pastries. It also helps me calm down whenever I’m feeling anxious or anything.” Potter was nodding along sincerely and Draco found that he didn’t mind telling the other man such personal information. Only Pansy, his mother and Jas and Emir knew about his baking but he found that he was glad Potter knew.
“Great, that sounds great! Perfect even! Thank you! I’ll see you there Sir!” and he almost ran out of the room. Draco quickly found Potter’s eyes and he mouthed a quick “what the fuck was that?”  which caused both of them to burst into spluttered laughter.
“You ready for the briefing then?” Potter sidled up behind Draco as he was making their cups of tea (if you could even call Potter’s that, it was more of a milk and warm water blend with heaps of sugar poured in). Draco’s breath caught in his throat and he had to cough to make sure his voice didn’t come out as a squeak
His brain had stopped functioning to say the least. He felt blood surge to his cock as he imagined the scene that the Weasley was privileged enough to walk in on. He was glad that Potter was still looking at the floor because in trousers as tight as these, it would have been pretty obvious how Draco felt about this situation. He slowly pulled one of his decorative sofa cushions onto his lap and tried to will his brain to say something.
Potter was just about to say something when there was a brisk knock at Draco’s door. Panic flashed through his mind.
“What?” Potter was just being purposefully thick now.
“Draco! I’m so glad you’re home! Oh I’m sorry, I didn’t realise you had a visitor!” She was looking over his shoulder at Potter who Draco was praying had taken his robes off. He gestured for Jasmine to come in and he dared to take a look at Potter and was relieved to see that there were no robes in sight. He kind of wished that he had kept his robes on because the plain clothes underneath hugged Potter’s frame and showed off every curve of his muscles which made it very hard for Draco to breathe. The man in question stood up and offered his hand for Jasmine to shake.
“You told me he was good looking but holy shit Draco, he’s a God!” Her hushed whisper probably still wasn’t quiet enough and Draco had to resist the urge of clapping his hand over her mouth.
“He’s free.” he said, seating himself without so much as a glance in Weasley’s direction.
“Ah hah! Here it is!” He handed her the bulky thing and hoped that she took it as a hint to leave. But in true Jasmine fashion… she didn’t.
“Er, thanks? it’s just going to be the usual case assignment and briefing.” Galen nodded and smiled a little too enthusiastically for what Potter had told him.
“I don’t have to explain anything to you Malfoy. I don’t even know who you think you are parading round the Ministry acting like you’re anything but a glorified Death Eater!”  Draco calmed himself. Weasley was a pitiful state in front of him and was obviously grasping at straws because he’s coming to realise that he’s losing his best friend.
“C’mon, let’s make breakfast.” He bounded off the bed (how this man still had any energy, Draco didn’t know) and gave Draco one last glance before disappearing out of the room. Draco fell back and let himself grin stupidly. He could hear Harry banging around in the kitchen (making a hideous mess, if dinner preparations were anything to go by) and Draco let himself feel hopeful for once. He could get used to life being like this.
“Sof day werenpft that badf.” Potter was trying to recall the briefing to Draco as they were both eating lunch at Potter’s desk. Draco’s face curled up in disgust.
She completely ignored his objection and carried on speaking in the same loud whisper “Draco, what is he doing here? Did you finally ask him out? I thought you worked until 6?”
“Just leave Ron, I’ve got meetings all day and I really don’t want to talk to you right now.” There was a bit more muttering before Weasley came storming out of the office with a nicely placed “fuck you too!” in Draco’s direction before he disappeared from the office. Before Draco could even begin to piece together what had just happened, Potter appeared in the doorway with a stony look on his face.
“You’re fucking amazing Draco.” Harry groaned as he put his hand on his hip (a twisted side of Draco hoped that it would leave a bruise) and upped his pounding. Draco was so close to finishing. Harry must have seen Draco’s reaction to his praise so he smirked and slowed down slightly, to harder, more brutal thrusts. He was hitting Draco’s prostate with every thrust and he couldn’t breathe. It was fucking glorious.
“You really want me to embarrass myself even more don’t you?” Draco snorted, wiping his tears from his face. Harry just offered a small smile in return, letting Draco know that it wasn’t anything like that at all.
He tried to focus on the words in front of him but his mind kept wandering. Malfoy was pissed at himself for the amount of enjoyment he gets out of this job. This was just meant to be a stop over until he could find himself a job working with potions but he fell in love with this position more and more everyday. Why wouldn’t he? He was in control of nearly everything (without having to take any responsibility which was ideal), he got to wear designer suits to work everyday (and look bloody amazing in them, so in a way he couldn’t blame Galen for being creepy)  and - although he would never admit it out loud - he loved working for Potter. He was a man who was in control and he knew that he had power and could handle it well and for the good which Draco had always admired. Some people would say (Blaise for example) that Malfoy was still infatuated with Potter just like he was in his school days but he had never heard anything so preposterous! If Draco was honest with himself (which he rarely was)… who couldn’t fall in love with a man like Potter? You’d have to be dead to not fall in love with him. Also as a big plus, Potter's stature had filled out nicely since school and he now knew that clothes were meant to fit a person's body. Draco had recently spent many a restless night trying not to imagine what Potter would look like stripped of all of his robes. He unfortunately wasn’t actually as much of a git as Draco once thought.
Potter shrugged again and gratefully took his now full glass.
Draco poured him another drink.
“He can probably hear you!” He whispered back, ducking down to look in his cupboard.
“Thank you so much Draco! I’ll pop by tomorrow and return it!” She said looking between Potter and himself again. “Afternoon, of course!” she said with a wink which made Draco blush from head to toe.
Draco shrugged again.  “Well, he’s not 100% my type, a bit on the scrawny side but I can appreciate a good psychique when I see one.” This was a topic Draco could be confident in. Men. Specifically attractive men. Potter seemed taken aback by this. It’s not like they had ever discussed their sexual preferences but Draco didn’t exactly scream heterosexuality if he were honest with himself.
“So… Are you going to tell me what that drama was about today or are you going to leave me guessing?” Potter shrugged and downed his drink in one go.
“Sensitive are we?” He pulled back and yanked Draco’s shirt off before moving his head down to gently bite his nipples. This sent Draco over the edge. He grabbed two handfuls of Harry’s already messy hair causing the other man to groan deeply. Draco moaned loudly as he desperately rutted against the other man's leg. Harry bit down hard as he pinched the other nipple and Draco cried out as he came. His whole body shuddered and he pulled Harry close to him as he tried to gain control of his body once again. He was panting now and could feel the uncomfortable warmth slowly spread in his trousers as the reality of the situation hit him. He would be embarrassed if he wasn’t currently having an out of body experience.
“Do you really need me there?” he said, turning round and facing the slightly (only about two inches but Draco would never let Potter forget it) shorter man who was now leaning against the opposite counter and handed him his cup. He took a sip of his tea and considered.
Harry nodded as he gently nibbled on the side of Draco’s neck. “The second you pulled my hair and made those noises, it was fucking over for me.” Draco laughed and put a hand over his face.
The last eight months had been an interesting few for Draco Malfoy to say the least. Going from house arrest to being the Head Auror’s secretary (who was Harry Potter himself) was a very bizarre turn of events. When he had opened the door of Malfoy Manor all those months ago, to see Potter there with a team of aurors and the Minister of Magic, he never could have guessed that the git would have changed his life so significantly. He had accepted Potter’s proposal (to come and work for him at the Ministry of Magic) with only a hint of nagging suspicion in the back of his mind. He and Potter had more than made up in the time since his trial and that meeting but Malfoy didn’t think they were ‘friends’ as such or even in a position to be able to work together but he highly doubted that this was some elaborate revenge scheme by Potter because surely he wouldn’t have bothered to save Draco from Azkaban if he was just going to throw him back there someday? Even with all his prodding and poking, Potter had never revealed why he specifically requested Draco to be his assistant. He would just usually shrug which infuriated Draco even more.
Yeah… he could definitely get used to that.
Lunch had been quickly finished after the small revelation from Potter so Draco was now trying to copy Potter’s briefing notes into a more elegant script so he would actually be able to read it a couple days from now. The office door slammed open and Draco jumped and his arm knocked the ink all over his neatly translated page.
“Don’t ‘mate’ me you complete twat! I can’t believe this!” The anger in Potter’s voice was slowly melting into sadness and every nerve in Draco’s body was urging him to run into the office and fling a few unforgivables at a certain ginger twat.
“Wait here Draco.” Harry said softly, padding out of the room and over to the bathroom. Draco’s eyes shot open and he watched the other man pad out the room still in his underwear.
“He is so into you Draco!” She was giddy with excitement but he just snorted and shook his head.
“I don’t think that’s entirely true.” Harry raised an eyebrow almost as a challenge.
“Potter you better fucking tell me or so help me I will torture it out of you.” Draco was too invested at this point to have him stop talking. The other man muttered something under his breath and downed the rest of his drink again. Draco caught something but it could have just been his wishful thinking. He pulled on all his willpower to not show how excited he was and to just seem indifferent about it all.
Draco was still caught up on who Potter was having sex with.  “Wood? As in Oliver Wood?”
“That isn’t the first time I’ve come in my pants over you.” Harry grinned
“Do you have a preference for anything?” he called out, he didn’t mind either way because he had plenty of variety when it came to alcohol.
Potter briefly looked over the notes before roughly handing them back to Draco (who found the gesture very rude, for the record). For once, Potter was out-striding Draco who was struggling to keep up even with his considerably longer legs. The tension in the air was so thick that Draco guessed it had to break at some point and knowing Potter and his emotional instability, it would be soon. The second Potter was at a standstill in the lift he turned towards Malfoy and let loose.
“If you don’t stop, I’m going to come in my trousers like I’m still a fucking teenager.” Harry groaned above him but he didn’t even attempt to pull away so Draco reached back up for his mouth while smiling delightedly.
“Is he busy?” A nasally voice interrupter Draco's focus. He looked up from his reading to see one of his least favourite aurors standing there (well second least if you counted that creep Galen before that - the auror who always licked his lips and stared at Draco’s arse during meetings and said inappropriately disgusting things when Potter wasn’t around. Draco would curse him but cursing an auror when he was an ex death eater wouldn’t exactly be a good look).
“You have a meeting with the Minister at 11:00; followed by a meeting with the Foreign Policies Director at 12:30 about the illegal trading of class A beasts; you need to brief the Aurors at 1:45 in the boardroom and then you’re free to finish all the paperwork we all know you get a hard on over.”
It felt like Harry set his skin on fire with every touch. Draco had been with enough men to count on both hands and he had never been touched or felt like this when with someone else before. It had always felt like Draco was going through the motions, both partners wanted to come so that’s what they tried to do. But with Harry… With Harry, they moved together, they wanted to get each other off more than themselves. There was a part of Draco that was mad because of course the best fuck of his life had to come from the Chosen One.
“Wait, Potter, you didn’t know? Why the fuck wouldn’t you tell him?” Draco exclaimed, turning to Harry’s supposed best friend.
“Well, I didn’t really get that much food until I came to Hogwarts so no not really!” Draco stared at his boss incredulously.
“Want to tell me about some of those times in the shower?” Harry’s head shot up as a grin slowly spread on his face.
“Did you?” Draco trailed off, not able to finish that sentence.
“Well the briefing shouldn’t take long so you could get us lunch and I’ll meet you back in my office?” Draco nodded once and hid his face by taking a drink of his too hot tea. Getting lunch was a normal thing, they did it at least three times a week yet today it felt different and that pissed Draco off more than anything. They stood there in a comfortable silence for a few minutes just drinking and waiting for 1:45 to come around. Then it all had to be ruined by Galen walking in. His eyes immediately brightened when he saw Draco and he started to say something but Potter cleared his throat and the creep quickly shut his mouth.
“That’s enough Ron. Have the rest of the week off. Take your paperwork home with you and give it to me next Monday.” Potter’s voice was cold and he was staring at Weasley in such a way that even Draco was slightly scared.
“Jas seems nice.” Potter said almost smugly.
“You know I don’t listen Malfoy and could you send Ron in?” Malfoy mock bowed and ignored the emphasis of the gingers name and the playful glint in potter's eyes.
“Name one thing that is on your schedule for today! You would forget your own name if it wasn’t for me! Also-” He got cut off by Harry pulling his head down to kiss him deeply. Draco moaned and pulled Potter on top of him, both their cocks responding immediately. He could feel the laughter rumbling in the other man's chest but all Draco could focus on was having Potter inside of him again.
Draco rolled his eyes and stifled a laugh “Seriously?” Harry nodded.
“Well, we make quite the domestic pair, don't we Potter?” Harry nodded in return and took Draco’s glass out of his hands and placed it on the table, not breaking eye contact once. Draco could feel the tension in the air and his breathing was getting heavier. He really wanted to kiss Harry Potter. His next move could break their relationship entirely. Draco could be reading everything all wrong and could make it completely awkward by leaning in even more. Potter's eyes flickered down to Draco’s lips which nearly broke his resolve completely.
“So you cook?” Draco looked up, expecting Potter to be taking the piss but he was met with a genuine expression. He must be drunk already.
“What do you mean you didn’t get that much food? Were your muggles poor then?” Potter just shook his head.
“So… You’re not leaving?” Draco called, trying not to sound as hopeful as he felt.
This is such a bad idea.
The sun was the first thing to wake Draco up the next morning. He was aware of a soft snoring next to him and turned to find Harry sleeping peacefully on the other pillow. The sunlight was falling softly across his face, highlighting the stubble on his jaw. Draco resisted the urge to reach out and trace the man's scar that trailed from his hairline to the side of his nose and opted to close his eyes and try to sleep again. His body ached in a good way, like he had run a marathon which he supposed he had when he recalled yesterday's events. They had fucked in the shower, then in the kitchen while they were cooking dinner, then in bed, then in bed again when Harry woke up hard in the middle of the night and Draco soon joined him. Draco was insatiable when it came to Harry, he had years of pining to make up for and he wasn’t going to waste a second now. He didn’t know where they currently stood relationship wise right now but he was just going along for the ride until Harry grew sick of him.
Harry wanted a choice.
Harry stared at the ceiling in the bedroom, arms behind his head, eyes tracing the marks that they’d left; an enthusiastic
Until he saw the—he stopped himself. He couldn’t go there just yet.
Pansy had just left. Draco was stared into the bottom of his wineglass, an unopened bottle sitting next to him. He was trying to decide if he wanted to open it. He was pleasantly numb. Another bottle, and he could force himself to forget. He chose to forget and reached for the wine key, when a bright, shimmering blue light exploded into the kitchen, through the french doors. Draco pushed his stool back so hard it toppled; he fumbled for his wand. Blinked dark spots away from his vision. It was too bright.
He stared at her.
me if I wasn’t doing a good enough job at torture for him. He always let me know that he’d hurt my mother if I didn’t do what he said,” Draco finished, sighed.
Sincerely,
"OK, Draco, we don't have to, but you did say that you blamed yourself for Harry leaving. I feel like maybe we need to talk about why you are taking that on yourself."
Draco just stared at him. He was sorry? That’s it? He pushed his glasses up on his head, pinched the bridge of his nose.
And then he was gone.
Draco Malfoy wanted to protect house elves. Draco missed Dobby.
“My dear Mr. Malfoy, welcome, welcome, come in,” the short, slightly rotund, and balding man ushered him in. He had a thick Greek accent, and the shop smelled like cloves and honey, and the air was warm and dry.
"How long?," Harry asked.
Narcissa reached out, covered his hand with hers. She smiled back.
That pulled Draco up short. Until Harry left, he would have thought that their relationship was incredibly successful. They cared for each other, supported each other. They worked on the potions cases for the DMLE; they were good partners. Harry knew how Draco liked his tea; Draco knew Harry liked Wine Gums and bought them for him whenever he was near an off-license. The sex was amazing. Draco had wanted to marry Harry. He had bought a ring.
Dr. Ducharme continued. “When it came down to it, you couldn’t knowingly hurt someone without being directly threatened. You didn’t kill your headmaster. You didn’t turn over Harry, and you didn’t let your friends try to hurt or kill Harry either. Our work here is for you to learn how to accept that you did your best, to stop torturing yourself, and to forgive yourself, oui?”
Draco smoothed his waistcoat down and stood up straighter. Good posture had been bred into him, quite literally. He walked to the counter and gripped the edge, hoping it would stop his hands from shaking. He tried to say hello. His voice didn’t cooperate.
“Pleasant bloke, eh,” Potter said darkly, eyes narrowed as he followed the attorney’s retreating form.
Harry.
Teddy was lounging on the lawn with Victoire. They were on summer holiday from Hogwarts, both teenagers now, and significantly above it all. They grew up together, hung around with the same crowd at school, so they usually retreated when faced with the younger kids—lamented that they couldn’t perform magic at home.
"Do you ever think about what it would have been like? If we had been friends the whole time?," Harry asked quietly, still tracing Draco's hip. "I think about it sometimes."
Draco really shouldn’t have found it so attractive.
Forgiving Harry was easy. Breaking up with Dai was hard. More difficult than when he’d left for California. Almost as hard as when Harry had left.
Harry was home.
One Year Before
Then not-Harry jammed his hands in his pockets. Rocked back on his heels.
He’d done either the wrong thing or, even worse, nothing at all for most of his life. Draco had ignored his intuition for years, tried to survive. Tried to keep his parents alive. Never thought about right or wrong. He had learned how to ignore the most intrinsic part of himself. He didn’t know how to trust himself. That snake-faced arsehole and his aunt had made sure of that.
Dai looked into his eyes, the way he always did when he was working through something, formulating a response.
Harry couldn't help it. He started to laugh. "Draco, Jesus. You sound like Robards, handing out orders." He flopped back down on the bed, rubbed his hands over his face.
Draco barely spoke to his mother anymore. Usually twice a year, once on his birthday and once on hers. Perfunctory Christmas gifts were owled. They hadn’t seen each other since she’d left the country after their trials. At first, because he couldn’t leave based on the conditions of his parole. Later, because he didn’t want to.
And here as in his life, too, he supposed.
Dr. Ducharme set her notebook aside. “Draco, it seems to me like you were raised a certain way. And you had certain prejudices and were perhaps a bit antagonistic towards Harry when you were young. Then you were inducted into this order, this group of fascists, and you were trying to stay alive and trying to protect your mother, all while only sixteen. So you left Harry alone. And then, when you saw him next, you did your best to protect him, even if you don’t feel like it was enough. And then you tried to save him again, in the hidden room. And then he and his friends saved you. So, it seems to me that, when your lives were literally on the line, you both chose to protect each other in the best ways you could.”
Threw it through the doors.
Harry hopped up and wrapped his arms around both of them, trapping Teddy between him and Draco. Whispered in Draco’s ear, “It went OK, then?”
“I do. I don’t care. Come home with me. You can work with me at Asclepius. You can research Western European herb and plant variations. I’ll take you everywhere; Scotland, Ireland, France. We can go wherever you want. Come home and work with me.” Draco knew it was too fast, too much. He didn’t care.
Draco had held him close this morning, taking in the lines of his nose, his neck, his back. Breathed him in.
They fell back in the hotel bed, wrapped themselves up in each other, whispered hopes, and made plans. Moved together until they came undone, a promise of something new instead of a good-bye.
A stag.
"How do you do that? How do you let it go?," he asked. Draco knew he had trouble forgiving himself. He didn’t even know how to try.
Harry stared at the ceiling. There was a black mark from the
"Yes, because one spends hours and hours charming badges with someone's face on them because they hate them. Not because they have a crush on them and only know how to get that person's attention in the worst way possible," Draco said, smiling a little.
Ottavia was a Regolare, a regular, what the Italians called Muggles. They went to school with both wizards and Regolari—there was no separation here, and interacting with magical society was typical for Italians. To Ottavia, Harry was just a wizard, which didn’t mean all that much to her. He wasn’t The Chosen One; he wasn’t anyone exceptional.
“I’d also like to thank you for inquiring after my skill set and deeming it acceptable to be of service.” Potter opened his mouth to speak again but closed again with a pointed look from Draco.
Dai covered Draco’s hand with his own. He took it, kissed his knuckles. Draco inhaled sharply, tried to forget, to concentrate on what was happening right now, in front of him. Not Brighton, or Grimmauld, or a thousand other places in England. Here.
He desperately hoped he hadn’t broken Draco. Or that someone else hadn’t.
Draco took the day off from running.
Draco always fascinated him. Harry had wanted an excuse to see him, to confront him. Had jumped when presented with one. Hadn’t meant for it to be anything more than just satisfying his curiosity. He’d fallen in love anyway. Never stopped to think about it.
“We were both eighteen.”
“What’s in the bag?,” he asked, trailing kisses across the bare skin, just above the collar of his t-shirt.
Ottavia was from Bologna, which had a long wizarding history, particularly in food. Muggles didn’t invent prosciutto and parmesan; tortellini and bolognese. She had a northern accent and a bit of a chip on her shoulder. He liked that about her too, her need to prove herself as worldly as the other students. He also liked that she liked him. And she liked other people. And sometimes she liked him with other people.
“Yes, but I was still here. You left me here. Alone.” Draco felt himself getting choked up. Dammit. He wouldn’t cry in front of her. Not after all this time.
He looked away from Harry, sat back on his stool, pulled his glasses back down, and continued his examination. Harry was silent, and Draco didn’t prod him.
But Harry could have dinner with Narcissa.
"Yeah," Harry exhaled. "Yeah."
The day of
*****
“What’s the matter?,” Dai asked, turning his head.
“I was wondering if you could help me with this. I’m working on a case—illegal potions ring—and our people couldn’t catalogue this one. They hit it with all the standard spells and tests, yeah? Tried to isolate the ingredients, cast revealing charms, even tested it out on a house elf or two, which I thought was bloody unethical. It seems as though they're a few house elves bound to the spooks in the Department of Mysteries, so there’s not much I can do about that. It didn’t hurt them, thank Christ, but it didn’t tell them anything else either. Figured we’ve hit a brick wall, so I’ve come to you. Do you think you can tell what it is?”
“You left because of me,” Draco interrupted, still rubbing his chest, unable to look at Harry. “I understand very well. Please. I can’t do this today. I need you to leave.”
Draco breathed in for four, held, out for four. “I was. Voldemort gave me a task. My fath—Lucius was in prison; he had failed. The dark lord was angry with my—Lucius, for his failure, and he demanded that I join the Death Eaters as his replacement. So then, when I went back to school, Voldemort… he… he demanded that I kill the headmaster of our school. Before the end of the school year. So. I had to….figure out how to do that,” he trailed off again, the familiar shame creeping.
And then he was gone.
Draco smiled. He loved having a partner in the shop again. It made the days pass quickly, and Dai was an excellent potioneer, knowledgeable in areas that were Draco’s weak spots. He pushed Draco to learn more, do more.
“You were the one who left. If you recall, I was legally prohibited from leaving the country for five years,” he sniffed.
Teddy smiled at him again, polished off the beer. Harry put his arm around his godson. They surveyed the garden, the party still in full swing.
“Probably from eleven to fourteen or fifteen.”
He needed something for himself.
Had it not been for Potter’s testimony.
Draco stood up from the chair in the courtroom, breathing heavy and shaking. It was finally over. He had been sentenced to five years probation, given a small stipend from the depleted Malfoy vaults to find a flat, and directed to find employment and to “make himself a useful member of both Wizarding and Muggle society.” Whatever that meant.
The Ponte Vecchio. He was in Florence, then.
“I just wanted to know,” Harry said as he blotted his face more. “I didn’t know if it was what I thought. But, it is, and now I know, so. Well.” He took a deep breath. “It seems as though your assistant is a bit shit at their job.”
It took his brain a moment to work it out. Harry was here. In Asclepius. Messy black hair, glasses, green eyes.
“OK, just needed a break from Victoire for a minute. She can talk. A lot,” Teddy gave a short laugh.
Harry apparated them into his bedroom at Grimmauld Place, lips still on Draco's, arms wrapped around him. Jesus Christ, he had no idea that kissing someone could be like this, could consume him so thoroughly. Harry needed all of Draco, needed him right now. He pulled back, smiled at Draco again, took in his messy blond hair, his flushed cheeks, his plump lips wet and parted. Stared into his gray eyes, noticed the blue in there, the flecks of gold. Lifted Draco's hand to his mouth again and kissed it, rubbed his thumb along Draco's long fingers, strong and sure from years of preparing potions ingredients, taking notes, twirling biros.
“I know,” Harry said, still grinning. “I know.”
Diagon Alley
And that was all it took.
Harry looked up, startled. He was so focused on the scroll; he’d forgotten Draco was in the room.
“My apologies, again, Mr. Potter. Mr. Malfoy will be so disappointed to know that his surprise was ruined.”
He felt himself flinch, hoped it didn’t show.
"I'm only still upright because you’re holding me," Draco smiled.
Dr. Ducharme encouraged him to go to the conference, to see his old friend and mentor. Draco felt like he could, perhaps, move on. Maybe he was ready. Under Dr. Ducharme's guidance, Draco had grieved. He moved out of Grimmauld, had it warded it to keep everyone but Ron, Hermione, and…him out. Draco knew that if he allowed himself back in, the temptation to get lost there again would be too great.
"I can't possibly be the first person who's asked you out on a date, Malfoy. Tell me you understand what a date is." Draco looked like he was about to jump out of his navy three-piece suit. Harry was enjoying this.
"Harry, I know you’re quite observant, you are an Auror for Merlin's sake, and you did manage to defeat a dark lord at seventeen. Please, please tell me you are not surprised by finding out that yes, I fancied you. Quite a bit." Draco blushed.
It was wrong, this perfect ring. He couldn’t do this.
So he went.
He inhaled for four, held, exhaled for four. He took off his glasses and pressed his palms to his eyes. He didn’t want to ask. He had to ask.
“Now, on a personal matter, I believe I’m, well. I’m years overdue on an apology for every stupid and dangerous thing I did to you and yours whilst at Hogwarts. Beginning with apologizing for the relatively tame—in comparison to what I did later—bullying and goading in our first few years. And then later for...For taking up with my father’s ideals, for taking the Mark. For allowing Death Eaters into Hogwarts, for hurting Ron, and Katie Bell, and Ron’s brother. For fighting on the wrong side. For,” he stumbled here. He always stumbled here. “For Dumbledore. For chasing you into the Room of Requirement and for…for Vince setting that awful fire. Thank you for saving us. I’m not sure I ever managed to do that, either. Say thank you.
“If you could just listen for a moment. Please?” Harry nodded, and Draco continued.
“And, for the love of Circe, tell the goddamn spooks to stop using their house elves as guinea pigs for dangerous potions. They won’t be affected the same way because their magical cores are biologically different from witches and wizards, so it’s not only a wildly unethical practice, it’s also completely useless. Just how stupid is everyone who works at the Ministry?”
Dai rubbed a thumb over his forehead, as if he was trying to smooth the lines there. “Where are you?,” he asked. “Where did you go?”
Harry apparated. He opened his eyes. He looked around.
“Excuse me. What the
Harry watched the chaos from the sidelines. Kids screamed and zoomed around on brooms. Draco was levitating Hugo again, the other kids shouting that they wanted a turn.
He reread it. A ring? A six thousand galleon ring? Harry hadn’t ordered a ring. The jeweler had made a mistake. They should be more careful, he thought. What a terrible way to ruin a surprise. Someone should let them know.
“Nine years of space, Narcissa?,” Harry spat from across the room. He pushed off from the counter and stalked over. “You lied to Voldemort just to find out if Draco was still alive. You risked your life for him, and you saved me so I could finally kill that noseless fuck. Why the hell would you do all of that just to leave him?” Harry stood next to Draco, looming over both of them, seething.
"Yes."
*****
Dai sat up. “Draco, I…what?”
“And then you came in here, and you were curious about me. We worked well together, we finally became friends. And then you asked me on that date, that perfect first date. And it felt like…I felt like: finally. I did so many wrong things. Then I did the right things, and then there was you. And you were, oh god. It felt like everything led me to you. Like you were an ending or a...a reward even. And you liked me. You loved me. That’s what it had all been for. Fuck. It was too much. It was too much for both of us.” Draco looked down, picked at the crease of his trousers.
“Yes, then what changed? Why did you stop antagonizing Harry after taking this Dark Mark?”
After a few more breaths, Ron looked up at him and exhaled fully. His eyes were bright. “Merlin bloody
Harry hid a smile. He knew Draco loved a complicated case. "No joy then?"
Draco unbuttoned his shirt, shrugged it off, and laid down on top of Harry. Harry kissed him again, loving how Draco felt pressed up against him. Lost himself in Draco's warmth and drank in the heady scent of him as their bodies started to move together. Harry rolled them over and kissed down Draco's throat, across his collar bones. He loved how Draco responded, a bit breathless, making small noises. He propped himself on one arm next to Draco, who leaned into him.
“I imperiused a bar owner and cast the cruciatius curse on people in my house.”
He’d come to Florence without thinking about it, but it had been what he needed. Somewhere new, the chance to learn something new. About himself. To get away from being the Saviour and the Auror. To get away from the destiny that hung over his head. That his life, even after Voldemort, had been decided by other people.
Harry took a deep breath and nodded. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you. I’m...I’m happy you have someone.” He hoped it sounded sincere.
He was so much more.
Harry was…he was Harry. He was curious and annoying and poked fun at Draco in a way that made his stomach flutter. He moved all the time, twirled his wand, bounced on the balls of his feet. He was intelligent and observant.
He didn't dignify it with a response.
Draco shifted in his seat. Fuck. He didn’t want to admit to Dr. Ducharme, during his first visit, that he had attempted murder while still underage.
“Are you forgiving me?,” Harry asked, his heart fluttered.
“Hello, Narcissa,” he said. Calm. Cool.
“You are an artist, Harry. Your art, it is heartbreaking. This ex-lover of yours, he is beautiful. But you need to paint something else. You need to make room in your heart and your mind for something else.” She tapped his scar, the same as Draco. “For someone else.” She stood on tiptoe and kissed the corner of his mouth. “Dipingi qualcun altro. Per favore.”
“No, no, it’s OK, I could do with the walk. Curry OK? Chicken vindaloo?” Harry had to get this cleared up. He set his glass down on the coffee table and shoved the scroll in his pocket.
He studied the man in front of him. He certainly looked like Harry, but he wasn’t the Harry he knew, the one he saw in his dreams. The one who appeared in his memories before he could push them away.
Maybe he’d never resolved anything.
Draco thought about the ring that was upstairs, hidden at the back of his sock drawer. Thought about the words he’d had engraved on it.
Draco was scared. Scared of what falling into bed with someone new might mean. He was excited too. And Dai. Dai was beautiful. Opening himself up to someone else, in bed or otherwise, could be part of the process of forgiveness. He knew how to acknowledge the harm done. But now, maybe it was time to acknowledge comfort, healing, pleasure.
After breakfast, he got dressed as always, in a three-piece suit. Today it was light gray wool, crisp white shirt. Draco never wore a tie, but he did fancy socks. Today’s were orange with golden snitches that fluttered. They had been a Christmas present.
Draco looked up, took off his glasses, and pinched the bridge of his nose.
He could deal with him tomorrow. Not today. Not when Dai had left today.
"Oh bloody fuck," Harry sat up. "Oh fuck. Your chest, Draco. The bathroom, what I did, oh fuck, I'm so sorry—"
, a cleaning charm, a mistake. Marks made in love. Harry liked Draco in bed, slightly mussed and undone, snoring lightly in his sleep. Or shaking with pleasure, wrapped in his arms, covering Harry’s lips with his own, breaths mingling. Harry had been so surprised by Draco, by his quiet need to make the right choice, his need to face things head-on. He had fallen in love with Draco too easily; it was almost as if he hadn’t had a choice at all.
To her credit, Dr. Ducharme barely raised an eyebrow at this information. Draco was starting to like her. Even if he felt like he was going to jump out of his skin.
“Nowhere,” Draco tried to smile. Failed.
We’re pleased to inform you that your order is ready for collection. To confirm, our artisans have created a platinum band, size nine, with custom engraving. After the initial deposit of two thousand galleons, the remaining balance is four thousand galleons. Please feel free to come by at your leisure. We look forward to your visit.
Teddy untied the strings and turned the ring out in his hand. Held it up and looked at it. It was gold, warm as a summer sunset. It was a simple band, with words engraved on the inside.
Draco tore his eyes away from the line of Dai’s throat. “Bugger, you distracted me. Go over there right now,” he pointed across the table as he stood up. He only had fifteen seconds before he needed to add the daisy root essence. He concentrated on stirring and, when the timer chimed, he added it. The potion turned bright yellow, precisely what he hoped would happen. He turned the heat down and watched it bubble softly. Draco looked at his notes, marked down the steps, the reaction. Reset the tempus for another hour and cast a protective shield over the cauldron.
“Hmm?,” he responded. He was studying the light lines.
After that first visit, Harry got the spooks to stop using the house elves as potions testers. He'd told Hermione about it, and she'd gone ballistic. It had taken two weeks.
Draco passed Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes twice a day, every day, for over a year before he worked up the courage to go in. He took a late lunch and hoped that the store would be quiet, since all the school-aged children were still at Hogwarts. He knew that George, the surviving twin, still ran the place. But he wanted to speak to Ron.
Ottavia wandered in, dressed in only an oversized grey t-shirt, ripped at the hem, and her knickers, a flash of pink as she walked. Hair piled on top of her head, feet bare, she carried two demitasse cups of coffee. Balanced one on Harry’s rolling art supply cart. Stood just behind him, took a sip of her own coffee.
Harry floated back to the office.
He wiped his paintbrush off and dropped it in a cup of water. Finally picked up the coffee and took a sip, black as night and sweet as love.
Draco shut his mouth and slumped over. Pansy was right, and he knew it. He just didn’t know how to get out of his habits, his rituals. Part of him didn’t want to let them go. It meant letting Harry go. It meant moving on from the pain, the dull ache in his chest. It was a wound that never fully scabbed over; he kept picking at it. Moving on meant Draco had to forgive.
“Missed you,” Dai smiled.
Draco ran his hand through Harry's messy hair.
But he took care, now that he knew how deep they went.
Draco took a deep breath. Now or never, he supposed. Doing the right thing felt awful.
Draco started to ask Potter what he was on about but decided it was probably better not to know. He reached out, and Potter passed him his old hawthorn wand. It was warm from Potter’s hand and started to hum in Draco’s. He remembered how it felt, holding it for the first time in Ollivander’s when he was eleven. How it felt like his magic finally had a place to go, an outlet. He had been blindingly happy. Until he had seen the look on Lucius’s face when he realized his son’s wand had a unicorn hair core. Most Malfoy wands were dragon heartstring, powerful, and amenable to the dark arts. Unicorn hair cores were stable and faithful. Lucius had been red-faced with rage and had stormed out of Ollivander’s, leaving a trembling Draco alone. It, like most memories of his father, was filled with both joy and fear.
“Wait, I want in on this,” Ron joined them, wrapped his arms around the three of them as best he could. They broke apart, smiling. Hermione and Harry’s eyes were bright, like they both were on the verge of tears.
“Hiya, Uncle Harry,” he said, hands shoved in his pockets.
“Yes, I’d rather say it was.” Draco looked back up, a bit taken aback. She was smiling. He tried to smile a little, too.
“Draco, hear me out. It was spectacular, it was thoughtful and meaningful, and I cried when I saw it. I knew how much thought went into it, and I was humbled. Grateful. I was so thankful you wanted to marry me. And I knew. I knew I’d say yes. To you. With or without that bloody amazing ring. And I just. Couldn’t.” Draco’s face fell again, and Harry rushed on.
“Now, back to this potion, Potter, what kind of nitwits do you have working for you at the DMLE? This is very much a transmutation potion, trickier to brew than polyjuice but more effective. You don’t need a bit of organic material of the person you want to disguise yourself as; you merely have to have an image of the visage you wish to mimic. Lasts longer than polyjuice too. No wonder it’s Class Alpha Major restricted.” He handed the vial back to Potter.
Harry headed to the front of the shop.
Oh right, the Patronus.
He wasn’t surprised.
“We could get take-away? Or we could go out?”
Draco nodded.
Harry leaned back again; Draco rubbed his hands down Harry's chest, through the dark hair. Smiled at him, sly. "I thought you said I wouldn't have to stand anymore."
Teddy looked out at the party, where Draco was with their family, considered the scene.
Teddy snorted. “No. But I’ll be Draco’s.”
Harry was more careful now.
“The point?,” he asked.
Draco finally looked up. “What if I don’t feel like I deserve forgiveness?”
Harry looked back at Draco, took in his hopeful smile, his legs casually crossed, drink dangling from his hand.
Harry’s heart sank. He had known, deep down. He knew it was too much, too self-centered, too arrogant to expect Draco to wait for him.
Harry met Ottavia in his life drawing class. She sat next to him, caught his eye, and made a joke about nudity being next to godliness or something like that. He hadn’t followed the story very well; his Italian had still been shit. But she laughed easily, her dark eyes shone, and her hair swung while she drew. He found himself staring at soft curves, the way her black t-shirt stretched over her breasts, how her long aquiline nose scrunched when she didn’t like something. He liked her immediately.
Ron stood by, arms crossed, brow furrowed. Studied Draco. Turned to Hermione. “I reckon it was the parchment, yeah?”
"Draco," Harry said, his voice low. Draco's eyes widened. Harry had never called him Draco out loud before. He liked it. "I can't help it. I want to know more about you. You're interesting. You always did get under my skin," he said, a smile playing at his lips.
Draco shifted uncomfortably. “No.”
“I love you. So much,” Dai said when they broke apart.
Draco went to shove him playfully in his chest, chuckling, and Harry caught his hand. He raised it to his lips, gently kissed his fingers, his knuckles, the spaces between, just as Draco had. He could barely breathe, could barely think. There was only Harry, his black hair, the scar that sliced down his forehead, his glasses, his green eyes. Clear brown skin. His mouth on Draco's hand, his soft lips. It was the single most erotic moment of Draco's life.
“Yeah, but you found it.” Harry grinned at him, that special smile that was only for Draco.
Draco pulled his hand back. “I don’t know how,” he whispered.
“Well, then. How about second chances? And call me Angelos.” Mr. Iraklidis had raised his glass, dark eyes sparkling.
“I will let you say what you need to say, Potter.” Harry winced. He hated that Draco was calling him Potter again. “But first, before there’s any lack of clarity, I need you to know that I’m currently in a relationship. And yesterday…,” he paused, swallowed. “Yesterday, he moved. He got a job offer abroad, one he had to take, and yesterday I had to say goodbye, which was very difficult, even though we are still together. We are doing long-distance, for the time being. It was a sad day for me, and then you appeared. Which is just my fucking luck, typically. So. Now that you are aware of what my state of mind was yesterday, you may proceed.” He sat back, posh as ever, despite how exhausted he looked.
He knew what he had done to them, when he left.
Rose and their cousins were playing, their aunts and uncles keeping an eye on things. Bill and Fleur were there with George, Percy and Audrey, Charlie and his boyfriend, Lamar. Ginny was up on a broom, tossing charmed balloons in the air, exploding them into showers of sparks. Her girlfriend, Rex, was helping. Neville and Luna were by the drinks table, Luna heavily pregnant. Molly and Arthur were at a picnic table, sipping on pink lemonade and vodka sours with Andromeda and Narcissa.
“Lucius did try to throttle me, at the end of second year. After I tricked him into giving Dobby clothes. Dobby stopped him,” Potter grinned.
Harry studied him for a few moments. Finally, he nodded. “OK, Draco, I’ll leave. But I’ll be back tomorrow. I need you...I need to explain to you.”
He knew he was a hypocrite. He’d had his own relationship with Ottavia. She’d known, though. She’d known better than he had, that a part of his heart, a part of himself, was still in England. Maybe most of himself. It wasn’t just Draco he’d left.
Harry raised his eyebrows. “Show off,” he whispered and nudged him. Draco shrugged in mock innocence. They were both turned on by displays of wandless magic. Draco couldn’t help but torture him a little.
Teddy looked him in the eye, serious now. “I see how he looks at you.”
He thought about Sirius. About how he’d told Harry he was going to ask Remus to marry him, the year they lived together at Grimmauld with the Order. He’d sent Harry a letter, excited and nervous, ink blotchy.
It had been so long. He couldn’t hold on to the resentment anymore. Not when she was sitting in front of him, saying things that, while they hurt, Draco could empathize with.
Draco latched on to one part. “A successful relationship? You do realize that my boyfriend, the most famous wizard of all time, did choose to leave me by going out for takeaway curry and never coming home again, right?”
Harry shoved his hands in his pockets, rocked on his heels. "I want to take you out on a date because I like you, you great bloody twit, and I want to get to know you better outside of your place of work. And I want to talk to you about something other than work, probably over dinner. And you're fit, and I wouldn't mind seeing what's under all your three-piece suits, if I'm honest. I can wait on that, though. Dinner and a drink first, yeah? Maybe a good night kiss if you're lucky." Harry waggled his eyebrows suggestively. He hoped.
Draco snorted. “Did you expect me to wait for you, Harry? For me to waste away, hoping you’d change your mind and come back? Stop everyone from worrying so much, to fix everything you broke? I’ll have you know that it took quite a long time for me to put myself back together after you left. I deserve to have someone who makes me happy.”
Draco had seen him in Diagon Alley a few times, coming and going. He was reasonably sure Ron had seen him as well.
“Darling, I know. I know I did, and I can’t tell you how sorry I am. I just needed some space.” She started to reach out, seemed to think better of it. Dropped her hand back on the table.
The Day Of
"Or things your aunt did," Harry smiled. "As much as might feel like it sometimes, it wasn't your fault.”
Dai breathed in, exhaled. “You’re extraordinary. And I can’t believe I’m going to say this but, yes. I’ll go home with you.” Dai smiled, kissed Draco’s hand again.
“Chi desegni?”
"I don't see you in my dreams." Dai deepened the kiss again.
"Think about it, though. We could have been tiny Gryffindors together. You would have shared a dorm with us, and we would have had all our classes together. You and Hermione are both such swots; you'd probably have spent all your time studying together." Harry let his hand drift down towards Draco's hip, traced the skin at the edge of the duvet.
Her eyes narrowed. “He left you, Draco.
He’d been grateful when Draco decided to give him, them, another chance. When Draco went to California, Harry was sure he’d lost him. He’d been sick with it, knew that it was his fault. Hoped anyway.
Sirius chose Harry. Harry would have chosen Sirius if he'd ever had the chance. That still hurt.
“Yep. It’s still a secret, though,” Harry grinned.
“A word, Malfoy,” Potter said.
“Think he’ll say yes?,” Teddy smirked. Jesus Christ, teenagers were brutal.
He’d lived with Aunt Bella.
“Well, yes. I mean. I had taken the Mark—when you joined Voldemort’s band of freaks, the Death Eaters, they literally branded you with a ‘Dark Mark,’” again, he made air quotes. “It was all rather theatrical, and now that I’m saying it out loud, it sounds ridiculous. But, yes, I took the Mark the summer before our sixth year.” He hoped she would drop it.
Draco's hand stilled, tilted his head. "What do you mean you 'chose Gryffindor'? The hat sorted you into Gryffindor."
Harry had taught them to be more careful, too.
Draco looked up. "Not interested? Me? Not interested in you? You have lost your marbles, haven't you, Potter?"
Draco took him in, considered dragging Harry back upstairs, and making them very late. But they couldn’t miss dinner at Andromeda’s. Teddy looked forward to their visits too much.
This person in front of him looked like Harry, but his hair was longer, past his shoulders. He had a proper beard now, and was thinner, almost rangy. Dressed in a ripped black t-shirt and low-slung jeans that appeared to be covered in paint. Why were his clothes covered in paint? This wasn’t Harry; this was just an unkept customer that looked an awful lot like Harry.
He swirled the potion back and forth, lifting and lowering the different loupes along the way, making notes on a piece of parchment with a fine felt tip Sharpie. How wizards still used quills and ink when Muggles had so many different and lovely kinds of writing implements, Draco would never understand. Sometimes wizards made things more difficult for no reason. He supposed it had something to do with how easy magic made almost everything.
Draco wanted his life back. He had wanted his life with Harry back.
Draco stopped holding back his tears.
“I love you. So much.” Draco kissed him again and felt his heart break apart.
Harry cleared his throat. “I was hoping. I was hoping we could talk. If you have a minute. And if. If you’ll speak to me.” He looked nervous.
Harry asked softly, “How does he look at me?”
How was he supposed to talk about this? How do you even say the words out loud?
“I just realized that you’ve been responsible for feeding me lately. I’m sorry, that isn’t your job. I’ll be better about it,” Draco mumbled.
"May I?," Harry asked as he reached up and tapped Draco's glasses. He nodded, and Harry gently removed the black frames, folded the arms. Took Draco's hand and tugged him toward the bed. Harry set Draco's glasses down on his nightstand, placed his own wire-frame pair next to them. He liked how their glasses looked next to each other. It looked domestic, like a tableau of comfort, of home. Of partnership, maybe love. Of family. It was too much to think about.
Then there was the man in their bed. This talented, thoughtful, intense person, who came apart at Harry's touch. Draco, who made better choices because Harry had said it mattered. Draco, who had, by some quirk of fate, chosen Harry. The Chosen One. The last person who had chosen him had also wanted to kill him.
It was a Patronus.
Knowlton scanned the letter and, as he did so, his face fell. “Oh dear, my apologies Mr. Potter. You weren’t meant to be the recipient of this note, as you are not the person who purchased this item. I’m so sorry. I believe my assistant must have made a rather unfortunate mistake.” He put the parchment down on the counter and gave Harry a rueful smile. “I think it’s rather ruined a surprise?”
Harry nodded. Bit his lip. "I promise I won't make this a thing. But. Can I… can I look?," Harry asked softly.
And that was it. All it took was that great, bloody, beautiful stag to jolt him out of his endless sadness and into a blind, all-encompassing rage. He pulled plates out of the cupboards, heaved glasses against the wall. Yanked drawers off their tracks, dumped their contents. Broke chairs, cast a
Sitting at the kitchen table, holding a cup of tea in both hands, was his mother.
Draco felt his stomach rumble. Dai was right; he had completely let the time get away from him. He hadn’t eaten anything since the toast he’d had for breakfast. That Dai had made him. He’d also brought him food yesterday. Was Dai currently responsible for feeding Draco? He frowned.
Fuck Harry, seriously. Draco had been OK before that arsehole had started coming around his shop. And now, his whole life felt like it was ending.
Draco stilled, felt as if he moved at all, if he even breathed, he would cease to exist. It was a trick of the mind. He was sad about Dai, and he somehow conjured an image. This was his magic gone awry. It wasn’t real.
Draco was better than happy.
Two could play at that game.
Harry turned to go. “One more thing, Mr. Potter.” He paused. “The ring. It’s charmed to update. As you grow, as your family grows. The images evolve with you. Mr. Malfoy was quite insistent that it do this. He said something to the effect of ‘you create your family.’”
Harry looked down at the network of white scars that marked Draco's torso. Traced a few of the silvery lines with his fingertips, paused when Draco inhaled, looked back up at him, his heart in his throat.
"I love you, too. So much," Draco whispered back, kissed him.
“Thank you,” Draco said, trying to convey how grateful he was without saying more. He was afraid he might cry.
They’d talked about it, like adults.
Nothing could have kept Harry from consulting with Draco.
Ottavia had pointed it out. It was the first time she’d been in his flat; she wandered about his studio, idly sorted through his sketches, stacked up on the table, pinned to the easel, taped to pieces of cardboard, propped up against the walls.
“I’ll go pick up dinner.”
“Thank you very much for your invitation and your hospitality, Mr. Iraklidis. I don’t mean to be too forward, but, well. I was surprised to receive your owl. I have to ask, why me? I’m assuming you do know my history, my family’s history with the Death Eaters, as my trial ended only a few months ago. I’m not sure why you’d want to hire a felon and former member of a fascist blood-supremacy group.” Draco shifted, crossed his legs. Uncrossed them.
“What was the point of you saving Harry, and of him saving you, if you refuse to forgive yourself? You’ve been a productive member of society; you had a very successful relationship. You can’t live a fulfilling life while still punishing yourself.”
“Hey there, boys,” he said, with a grin.
“I’m OK. Really, Harry. It just doesn’t seem worth holding onto anymore. She’s here. She apologized. Her reasons for leaving...make a certain amount of sense, now that so much time has passed. We can have dinner. See what happens. Can you do that? We can leave if you can’t.” Draco’s eyes searched Harry’s.
He looked over Draco, sleeping on his stomach, face buried in the pillows, white-blond hair just visible above the covers. He wanted to kiss him awake, sink inside him, make Draco shudder with pleasure. It had been years, and Harry still wanted him, wanted to taste him, breathe him in, make Draco his. He never stopped wanting. Could never catch his breath, it seemed. Harry wondered if Draco felt the same way. Wondered if Draco ached, deep in his chest, as Harry did.
Harry smiled and looked down at the figure sprawled next to him. Soft limbs tangled in white sheets, hair the color of mahogany fanned out across the pillow, halfway down her back, one sleepy dark eye looking up at him.
There were words engraved inside. Harry read them and felt his heart crack open. He put the ring back in the box, hands shaking slightly, and set it on the counter.
He turned and walked toward the back room. Looked over his shoulder.
Maybe it had been the right thing.
“Yes, well,” Draco replied. “You do know you left it here, right?”
Draco forced his mouth to form words. “Thank you, Potter. It’s not mine. I work for Mr. Iraklidis, but he’s on a buying trip right now. Might I be of service?” He gripped the edge of the counter, knuckles turning white.
Draco flopped back on the bed; the duvet pushed down below his hips. Harry was getting distracted. "I cannot believe you chose your house."
“Uncle Harry,” he gave him a sly side-eye. “Is this what I think it is?”
It was time.
He grabbed Harry’s hand instinctively, without thinking about it. Harry shifted, moved in in front of Draco, protectively.
Harry laughed. “Yeah, she can.” He passed Teddy his beer bottle. “Here. Don’t let your grandmother or your aunt see.”
"Sickle for your thoughts," Harry tugged on Draco's hand and smiled at him.
“Stop it. I know what you’re going to say. The very best Aurors, in both Britain and abroad, looked for him for months. For
Harry was still here.
“Come home with me?,” Draco asked, softly.
That had to mean something.
Draco snorted. "Fourteen-year-old Draco certainly would have hoped."
And there it was. He gasped, put a hand to his chest. It hurt.
He thought he’d follow Draco anywhere.
Harry thought about it for a second. "I mean, I guess when you put it like that, yeah?"
Three Years After
and stopped Harry from harping on it, practically in the same breath. How he’d agreed with Harry; the Department of Mysteries was unethical in its treatment of house elves.
Draco tried to think of Dai. Of lime and basil, of spring. His shining treasure.
“Potter, I…,” Draco cleared his throat. “I want to thank you for choosing to use Asclepius as your apothecary of choice in this consulting matter. I’m sure Angel—Mr. Iraklidis—will be best pleased when I let him know that the DMLE inquired after our expertise on a particularly troublesome case.”
“Perfect,” he managed to get out.
Harry twirled his wand while Draco pored over a giant textbook. He had a vial of violent blue potion in one hand, his regular black-framed glasses perched on his nose, and the X-Ray specs pushed up on his head. He looked like a bloody mad scientist. Harry tried to breathe evenly.
CW: mild homophobic slur
“Yes, OK, you used both of these Unforgivable Curses under threat of torture and possibly death. And sometimes, your family also participated in these threats. Draco, do you see how traumatic this is for a teenager? For anyone, really. But you were a teenager in a terrible situation, and your life was threatened. Please, tell me how you and your ex-partner saved each other,” she nodded, motioned for him to continue.
Not white, no charmed images.
“We could get takeaway? Or we could go out?,” Draco asked.
“Harry, we need to talk.” Her tone got his attention. He still didn’t look at her, though.
He told her about the Patronus. About the destruction. He drank a bottle of her wine, passed out on her couch. Draco woke up the next day, took a hangover potion, closed the shop for the day, and moved back into his apartment in Shadwell.
"I see a mind healer. Hermione thought I had PTSD after the war. I didn't know what she meant, so I took an online quiz and answered positively to almost all the questions. I had nightmares; I was jumpy and couldn't relax. I'd hear a door slam, and I'd jump a million feet in the air, wand out. I was always on guard and couldn't sleep. Could barely eat. Ginny and I started dating again, and I thought it would help, but she had nightmares too, and mine made hers worse. My magic started to get unstable, and I had a hard time controlling it. I'd accidentally set papers or curtains on fire if I got angry or had an emotional outburst. So Hermione helped me find a mind healer who is a witch, who’s also familiar with Muggle psychiatry and PTSD treatments. She helped treat soldiers who came home from Afghanistan. She helped me. She still helps me." Harry looked at Draco.
Narcissa insisted on making excuses for his father, encouraging Draco to forgive him, to write to him in Azkaban. Draco could never deny the force of her love for very long, so he had. It had been...as expected. Long, vitriolic screeds, listing the ways how Draco had disgraced the Malfoy name, his ancestors. How he’d neglected his duty during the war. How he was a nasty poof who didn’t belong in a pureblood family. Draco sent the letter to his mother, hopeful she would finally see that he needed to let Lucius go.
"Is that a good thing or a bad thing?," Draco asked, lowering his lids.
"Harry—," Draco started. Took a breath, held Harry's hand, kissed his fingertips.
Best to meet it head-on, then, he thought. It seemed Ottavia couldn’t let it go anymore, but she might understand loving more than one person. They invited other people into their bed, less frequently now, but she knew how to share love. “Ottavia, ti amo. I can’t tell you who he is. There’s room for more than one person in my heart,” he said, softly, hoping she’d understand.
Knowlton appeared again and set a small wooden box on the counter between them. A stag and a doe, carved on the lid.
Draco was devastating.
"Well, Potter, seeing as I do have an actual job, and I'm not merely the DMLE's plaything, I'd say two weeks? Maybe three?,” Draco huffed, crossed his arms.
Draco and his attorney waited for the courtroom to clear before making their way to the exit. He was at the door when he felt a hand on his arm. Draco turned and found himself looking directly into specky green eyes.
Draco wanted to believe him.
“Quando ti sogno,” he grinned and pulled her closer.
“Come stai, amore?,” she asked.
Draco paused his examination. He felt a lot more comfortable in his lab, amongst his things. He set the bottle down and pushed the glasses up into his hair. It was now or never.
“May I ask you to clarify what you meant by his ‘large snake’? Was that code for something?,” she asked.
“Darling, you can’t keep this up,” Pansy said.
"Yes, sir, Auror Potter," Draco teased.
Harry felt warm, nodded. “Thanks, Ted.”
“Your young man was exact.” Knowlton took the ring and stowed it in his robes.
“Well. My friend, he wanted to kill Harry, but I said we couldn’t because Voldemort wanted him alive. But I didn’t know if that was true; I just said it. I didn’t want anyone else—Harry—to get hurt. I just wanted my wand back. And then my friend—he was my friend, his name was Vince. He unleashed a deadly fire, and my other friend, Greg, passed out. The fire was eating everything in its path; we were going to die. And then Harry saved me. On a broom, he flew me out of the room, away from the fire. And Ron and Hermione saved my other friend, Greg. I never did get my wand back, that day.” Draco rubbed his hands over his thighs, trying not to fidget. This was hard.
"Come on, Malfoy, you heard me. I'll ask again anyway. Will you go out with me?" Draco squirmed, and Harry grinned even more. This was fun. Draco turned on his stool, faced Harry, silver eyes narrowed.
Draco almost wished he was dead.
Draco paused. “To second chances, then.” He raised his glass. “And please, call me Draco.”
"I antagonized him, mostly. I wanted his attention," Draco interrupted.
Draco loved Dai.
"You’re the best,” Harry said as he kissed Draco on the cheek and grabbed the game.
Dai pushed himself up on his forearms, leaned over, and kissed Draco slowly, with intent. Draco inhaled as Dai pulled back; he smelled like lime and basil, rain and grass. Like spring, Draco thought. Dai had told him that his name meant "shining treasure" in Japanese, which suited him. He was Draco’s bit of gold, of light.
Dai nodded at the tempus. “You only have a few seconds left, babe.”
"Do you know how much I love you?," Harry whispered.
One Year After
Draco pushed the sheets down, straddled Dai's legs, and massaged his back, stroked long lines down his muscles. Dai sighed happily and laid down. Draco loved watching his muscles dance and jump under his touch, loved watching him become pliant and loose under Draco's hands, loved moving his fingers over his back and legs until Dai begged Draco to say the spells, sliding together until they were both slicked with sweat.
Draco broke the kiss, pulled back a little. “Thank you,” he whispered. Thought about the last time someone else had gone to get dinner. He started to push the thought away, but remembered his work with Dr. Ducharme, to embrace all emotions. He tried to lean into it, into the pain of the memory—the fear and anger. The deep sadness, when he had realized what happened.
"You keep calling me Auror Potter, and I'll bring you anywhere you want." Harry raised an eyebrow. Merlin, he was a flirt.
Becoming an Auror had been the easiest and most obvious thing to do after the war, but Harry hadn't really thought about it when he joined. He did it because it was easy, and it felt like... like he owed it to people. He had picked the potions cold cases, after the first one, because of Draco. So it came back to Draco. Sometimes it felt like it always came back to Draco.
It was Draco.
“Why did you think you had to?”
Harry stared at Draco, bent over, his white hair mussed from having various eyewear perched in it, or from Draco running his hands through it absent-mindedly. He didn't wear it slicked back anymore, and it was a bit longer. Floppy. Harry wondered what it would feel like, running his hands through those white strands. Tried to breathe normally.
Draco nodded. "I saw one a few times, as part of my probation. He helped me with breathing exercises for when I got too overwhelmed, to calm down again. Centering yourself, he said."
Draco exhaled. He felt his anger drain away. He understood, in an odd way.
). Scanned the day’s paper. He was looking, as always, for a sign. Anything. An offhand sentence in a political story. A letter to the editor. An ad in the back.
Harry stood outside the door of Asclepius, two coffees in his hands. It was nine o’clock on the dot. If Draco still kept the same habits, he had been at the shop since 8:30, at his worktable in the back. The shop didn’t open for customers until eleven, so Harry hoped they’d have some time to talk. If Draco would talk to him today. He hoped.
They met at a potions conference in Morocco six months ago. Angelos had retired before—before, everything. He moved back to Morocco, a place he considered home far more than Greece or England. Draco hadn’t been abroad since—well, since.
“You could have knocked, you know,” Draco said. He sounded tired, cranky.
He turned back to Draco, ran a hand through his hair. He had wondered how Draco's hair would feel; it was soft and smooth, with a tiny bit of texture.
One year after
Eight years before
Harry's eyebrows shot up. "Did you…did you fancy me while we were at Hogwarts?"
“Do you want to see the ring? It’s quite remarkable,” Knowlton said.
He ran a hand over the table and looked up. The delivery owl was tapping at the french door. He slipped a few knuts into the owl’s pouch and gave her a treat (
Draco tried very hard not to gape. Not only was Potter standing here, in Asclepius and looking very fit, but he was here to ask for Draco’s help on an illegal potions case. One the DMLE and the Department of Mysteries hadn’t been able to solve. Well, it didn’t sound as if the Department of Mysteries had tried to figure anything out, except lend a couple of house elves as test subjects which, Draco agreed, was entirely unethical. And cruel. He thought of Dobby, and Drizzy and Metulo, the other house elves at the Manor. He had loved them, even if it had been unbefitting for a Malfoy. Draco composed himself.
“Is that an invitat—,” Harry cut himself off with a glare from Draco. “Sorry, boyfriend abroad. Apologies.”
"Are you fucking with me, Auror Potter?," Draco arched an eyebrow. Years ago, it would have been a sneer. Draco never sneered anymore, Harry had noticed.
Draco snorted. “Well, there’s one thing it did right. Why are you giving it back?”
“Draco, I’m your mother, and I’d appreciate it if you’d address me as such. I don’t want anything other than to see you. It’s been too long.”
“What did you say?,” slightly sleepy. “I thought I heard you ask me to come to England with you?”
“Yeah, yeah, Malfoy, we can say hello as we pass each other in the halls like bloody first-years. Get out of my shop, now,” he said, although there was no venom behind it.
“What?” Draco blurted out. Malfoy manners crumbled before Potter, it seemed.
"Yes."
“I wanted to know what you wanted to do for dinner.”
He lifted his head and looked at his therapist. Dr. Ducharme was terribly chic for a mind healer, tall and willowy; blond hair pulled back into a chignon at her neck, black layered skirts draped over legs elegantly crossed. A notebook and biro held loosely in her hands.
Alfred Knowlton, Proprietor
Andy sighed and leaned up against the island. “Watch your language, Harry.”
“Seeing if I can identify any of the potion ingredients or magical properties by sight, using lenses I’ve charmed to detect certain identifying factors.” Draco was still peering at the potion, moving the loupes.
Draco felt a hand on his shoulder, winced, physically jerked. He stood up quickly, Harry’s hand fell from his shoulder. Draco pulled his glasses back down and walked away from Harry, to the other side of the room, his back to him.
Harry hadn’t realized he needed to touch someone so much. Draco never seemed to mind, leaned into him, traced his jaw, Harry’s eyebrows, his lips. Begged for more when Harry touched him back. Just one word from Draco, a soft
Harry shifted in his seat. “In my defence, the jeweler asked me if I wanted to see it.”
"Harry, I—," he started.
Harry thought about the boy he'd known at Hogwarts. The arrogant, snide, cruel boy who taunted him and called his friends slurs. Who, later, had done horrible things, had done them without thinking, trying to stay alive. Harry thought about how pale and drawn Draco had looked in sixth year, at the manor, at his trial. Tried to reconcile all the different Dracos he knew in his head: snob, cult member, convicted felon.
Draco walked behind the table, put it between them. Picked up a biro and started to twirl it in his hand. Saw Harry smile at the familiar habit. Made himself stop. Forced himself to make eye contact with Harry, with those familiar green eyes, the ones he’d looked into so often. He felt his heart clench.
Draco turned back to his mother. “I do believe Harry asked a relevant question. I’d be quite interested in hearing the answer. Mother.”
"I'm fairly certain that you're only here to torture me, Potter," he said with a sigh.
“Yeah, well. Maybe saving the world was less scary,” Harry said, wryly.
Draco smiled, kissed his fingers one more time, dropped his hand, and walked back to his desk.
“Yes, well. That ring, Draco. It was stunning. It was...it was the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen. It was thoughtful and perfect. And then. And then the jeweler told me that it was charmed to evolve with us, with our family. And it took my breath away. It broke my heart.”
How could he bear it, wearing that ring?
“What the fuck, Andromeda?,” Harry said, voice low.
One year after
“Oui,” Dr. Ducharme said. “Let’s get started.”
He loved Draco. He couldn’t breathe without him. He couldn’t breathe when he was with Draco, either. Draco was, in Harry’s case, breathtaking at every turn, at every moment. His skin felt hot on the cool white duvet.
It was also Draco.
He could deal with an annoyed Draco, too.
"You OK?," Draco asked.
“Because I was an arrogant, condescending, imperious child who ordered my friends around, idolized my father—who held some deeply problematic views on blood supremacy—and I eventually became part of his fascist cult. I was also incredibly mean-spirited and quite creative in my methods of antagonization. I went for the low blow, every time. I made fun of Harry for being an orphan, for his—our—friend Ron, for his family being poor. I called his—our—other friend, Hermione, a racist slur because she was Muggle-born. I was hateful. I didn’t deserve his friendship, even before I joined the fascist cult.”
“Yes,” Draco breathed.
Potter. Yes, I am interested. In you. OK? I like working with you, and I like being around you, and, for fuck's sake, I would also very much like to see what's under that unfairly attractive coat. What I do not understand, what I cannot even begin to fathom, is why—how—could you possibly be interested in me?" Draco had moved closer to Harry during his mini tirade; he was crowding him now. Harry breathed. He was so close; he could smell Draco. Lemon and thyme, clove and mint.
Closed his eyes. Opened them again.
"Let me get you on your back, Malfoy," Harry teased. "Please?"
“You know, I wasn’t half as cheeky as you when I was your age.” Harry traded the ring pouch for the beer again.
Dai had gone home. He’d known it was coming; they’d agreed that Dai couldn’t turn down the opportunity he’d received. He’d been offered the position of Lead Potioneer at a prestigious potions Academy in Santa Barbara, in the Santa Ynez mountains, where potions ingredients grew spectacularly among the pinot grapes.
“Extra naan?,” Draco called as Harry opened the door.
"Merlin, could you imagine what Lucius would have done? I'm not sure who he would have gone after first—me, the hat, or Dumbledore," Draco laughed. The duvet slipped down even farther. Harry stared at his sharp hip bone, smooth and pale. Felt himself getting aroused.
“So you began dating at twenty-five, then? And you were together for three years, until you were twenty-eight, is that correct?”
“Earth to Potter. Sickle for your thoughts?”
Harry looked up, startled. “Oh. Hi.” He smiled up at Draco. His eyes crinkled and lit up. Like that smile was reserved just for Draco. It made his heart skip a beat every time, even after three years together.
He resented his subconscious for always returning to England, to him. So he chose Ottavia. He chose her laugh and her stories, the way she talked with her hands, on pub nights with their friends, waving her drink in one hand and an MS cigarette in the other. He chose her, and he liked the people she chose. Matthew, the American art history student. Dagmar, the Austrian painter. Harry got to choose too. Lubanzi, the South African footballer. Seo-Yun, the Korean jewelry apprentice.
“I can’t find the exploding snap set!,” Harry called back. Draco could hear him rummaging around upstairs, likely turning the rooms upside down. Draco sighed.
Draco stopped walking and pulled Harry to face him.
He had scheduled check-ins with a parole officer from the Department of Magical Law Enforcement every two weeks. All in all, Draco was grateful. He could have done much worse. And would have.
"I chose Sirius. Even though I never got to live with him, I would have. I wanted to live with him and Remus. And I chose Ron and Hermione. But I suppose I chose them because I chose Gryffindor."
“Draco, what happened?,” he heard Harry ask behind him. He had taken a few steps toward Draco but, blessedly, kept his distance.
Harry had left and taken half of Draco with him.
“Mine?,” Draco was so surprised; the question just fell out of his mouth.
He started to realize that, perhaps, his need for Draco was the problem.
Dai walked in through the door, levitating a crate in front of him and carrying a large paper bag. He set the crate down gently, put his wand in his back pocket, and walked over to the worktable. Leaned down and kissed Draco on his temple.
“This doesn’t mean anything else, Harry. I forgive you. You can still fuck off.”
“Yeah,” she sighed.
"You are a bloody idiot, Harry," Draco said softly, and Harry's heart jumped at hearing him say his name. "Of course, I'll go out with you."
“Fate, Mr. Malfoy.”
Draco exhaled sharply and sat back in his chair. “Bloody fucking unprofessional…,” he muttered.
“OK, OK, old man. Let me up.” Draco struggled to move the toddler off him and sit up so he could get his wand out of his back pocket. He aimed it at Hugo, said “Levicorpus.” The boy rose steadily in the air, his hands out in front of him, pretending to be the Muggle superhero. Draco stood up and floated Hugo out of the bedroom, down the stairs, back to the party. It was Rose’s eighth birthday, superhero-themed. Harry had introduced them to the Muggle movies.
He had done a terrible thing by leaving.
“Cheers,” Harry tipped his coffee at him.
Draco looked over at the sleeping form next to him, straight black hair and smooth skin. Studied the planes of his face, dark eyebrows over closed eyes, framed by long black lashes. Sharp cheekbones, pointed chin. Draco reached out to brush some of the silky hair off his forehead, and was greeted with a sleepy smile as black eyes opened slowly.
Harry pulled his eyes away and broke the seal on the scroll, unfurled it to read.
"Ah, yes, OK, you wanted his attention, and you got it by antagonizing him. And then he hurt you in a bathroom, but then you possibly saved him. He saved you, both in a fire during the battle and from a stricter sentence after the war. Then he came to you for professional help. And you started working together, and you became friends, then started dating. You fell in love. You moved in with him. You were going to propose, but then he disappeared—"
Draco was a revelation.
He was intoxicating.
“Good evening. May I help you?,” he asked.
"You're always in mine," Draco breathed.
He knew, somewhere deep inside, that Harry’s forgiveness had been Draco’s absolution. If he was honest, he liked it. He liked knowing that he somehow had saved the last part of Draco, even as he’d admired him. Harry pushed his glasses up on his forehead, rubbed his face. Crossed the room, sat in the window, lit a cigarette. Filthy habit. He loved it anyway.
Harry wondered when, exactly, it was that he found professional competence to be sexy.
“Like everything you say is interesting to him. Like he’d never get tired of listening to you talk. Like he thinks you’re something precious. Something you need to be careful with.”
He walked into the living room, and his breath hitched.  Draco was at the liquor cabinet, his movements graceful and efficient as he pulled out glasses, conjured ice. He was wearing a black cashmere jumper and finely pressed grey trousers, and, as always, cheeky socks; today’s were purple with green dragons circling his ankles, puffing smoke. Harry couldn’t help but stare at Draco’s sharp profile, black glasses perched on his Aquiline nose, his full lips. He felt undone.
He could confront his mother.
Draco pulled him into a kiss, long and slow. Slipped his tongue into Harry’s mouth, sighed into it. He pulled back and smiled.
Harry paused, threw a smile back at Draco. “Always extra naan.”
And with that, Harry left.
“Ah, OK. And how old were you when you met Harry, when he rejected you?”
“Wondered where my fucking nine-inch apologia was, eh? Felt a bit left out.” Ron offered a half-smile, and Draco took it.
“Always extra naan.” Harry smiled and walked through it.
“Well. I suppose I did alright on my own after all.” He gave her a small smile.
Dragon scales, stars, thorns.
“Yeah. I, uh. I wanted to give you this.” Harry pulled Draco’s wand out of the inside of his suit coat. Potter wore Muggle suits that hung off his skinny frame.
“Hi,” Harry said, still rocking back and forth on his heels.
Draco was unmoored. His mother had fled to France, which was best for everyone, and Lucius was serving a ten-year sentence in Azkaban, which was also best for everyone. Draco suspected Lucius wouldn’t make it out of there alive, not this time, but he couldn’t muster caring one way or another, really. He knew he should have an emotion about his parents, but it took everything he had just to put one foot in front of the other. It was Harry’s words that he heard in his head, like a drumbeat. Your choices define you. It’s not so black and white.
Harry took the handkerchief, wiped his eyes under his glasses, nodded. It was good news. But Harry felt so off-balance, so unmoored. He barely knew why he was crying. His stomach roiled as his eyes leaked.
“An ex-lover?”
“She’s also terribly intimidating.”
Draco bought a ring.
Harry lifted the lid and, nestled in midnight velvet, was a breathtaking, blinding ring. So bright it was almost white and imprinted with intricate, swirling patterns. He lifted the ring and rolled it in his fingers; it was heavy and solid, warm to the touch. He inspected it and realized the carved patterns moved, twisting around the band. Dragon scales, hawthorn branches, holly leaves; a snitch fluttered. The engravings collapsed in on themselves, reformed, in black and silver, white and smoke. As he turned the ring, constellations sparked and faded, the moon phased, a galaxy spun, a broom sped by, lilies bloomed. The flash of a snowy feather, a chess piece, runes, a rosebud, a toy Quidditch player.
Harry thought.
Knowlton huffed, and his mouth turned down. “Quite,” he said. “I’ll be having words with him.”
“Seventeen.”
Knowlton nodded. “Only fair.”
Weasley saw right to the heart of things, didn’t he?
"That is a spectacularly bad idea," Draco said.
“I was sixteen.”
Draco barked out a laugh. He liked that they could joke about the darkness, about Voldemort.
Draco stared at the ceiling, looking for a mark, an imperfection, anything to focus on. It was perfectly smooth and featureless—how Draco felt. His head was tilted back, resting uncomfortably on the back of the overstuffed chair.
Harry walked toward the bridge and wondered why he wound up here. He’d read about Florence in a book about Italian alchemy practices during the Renaissance; Hermione had packed it in that damned beaded bag. It seemed the Medicis had a somewhat surprising amount of wizards in their employ and were obsessed with everlasting life. You didn’t patronize that much art if you weren't preoccupied with immortality. Hermione hoped their obsession extended to Horcruxes, but the Italians, it seemed, were more interested in creating a philosopher’s stone. Galileo had partially succeeded; he created a stone that turned metal into gold, but it hadn’t granted immortality, so he left it with the Medicis and buggered off.
“Boys, I’m so glad you made it.” She wiped her hands on her apron. “Something to drink?”
Harry stared at his chest, wondering what Draco could possibly be embarrassed about. Draco was stunning; he was the most beautiful—realization slammed into him like a fist.
"I can. Your breathing changes when you're caught up in your head," Draco yawned and rolled onto his side, propped his head upon his arm, and tapped his finger to Harry's scar. "Spill, Potter. You don't do well when you're stewing. What are you thinking about?"
"Oh, nothing," Draco smiled.
fuck, Andromeda?,” Harry asked again. Draco appreciated Harry’s commitment to thoroughly antagonizing his aunt, who, it seemed, had invited Narcissa here to torture Draco.
Merlin
Draco put his hand over Harry's, lifted it, and kissed his knuckles. Harry’s breath caught. Draco made eye contact as he kissed each of Harry's fingers, touched his lips to the dips in between, turned his hand over, kissed his palm. Harry could hardly breathe when Draco lifted his hand to his face, pressed Harry's palm to his cheek.
as in these potions previously did not exist—since you've been here. You’ve also improved the side effects of current healing potions, where other people couldn’t. I also learned that you share your work with international potioneers, for free, so they can use your recipes and adapt them based on the materials and ingredients native to their region. I want your help. Not Iraklidis’.”
"What did 'The Chosen One' choose, then?," Draco teased lightly and traced his scar, down through his eyebrow, to his cheekbone.
Draco nodded and turned to leave. He was about to open the door when Weasley called after him. “Harry doesn’t have it in him to hold a grudge, Malfoy. He saved you. He spoke for you. You don’t need to prove anything to him.” Draco hesitated, hand on the doorknob. He nodded at Weasley and left.
He picked up the vial and headed to the back room. He looked over his shoulder and saw Potter still standing in the center of the shop, hands in his pockets, coat shoved behind his arms.
“Draco,” Dr. Ducharme said. "I know it's difficult to think about. But we should perhaps talk about it, oui?"
Then the Patronus had appeared.
“Yeah, yours, ya daft idiot,” Potter’s mouth quirked. “Everyone knows that this shop was middling at best before you started working here. Now it’s one of the premiere apothecaries in the country. Why do you think that is?” His eyes were bright behind his glasses.
He didn’t choose the Dursleys, or to be a wizard, or Hogwarts. He’d chosen Gryffindor by messing about with that bloody hat. He never felt like he chose Ron and Hermione; they had always been there. But he supposed he had.
Weasley uncrossed his arms and rested his hands on the edge of the counter, dropped his head down to stare at the floor for a moment. Draco saw his back rise and fall in a slow rhythm, as if Weasley was also doing a breathing exercise. Draco wasn’t the only one with post-war anxiety. He waited patiently.
She walked out of the room, and Harry watched her leave. He loved the way she walked, on the balls of her feet, hips swinging.
Harry pulled a small pouch out of his pocket, handed it to Teddy, took the beer back.
"Harry. Please don't," Draco breathed.
Dai raised his head, a small line between his eyes, a question.
But he couldn’t bring himself to do anything else.
“So you had no time to antagonize Harry, then. Because you were forced to join a hate group as a sixteen-year-old and then also told to kill your headmaster. Did he threaten you? Coerce you in some way?,” Dr. Ducharme asked.
He was everything Draco had thought he was.
Teddy turned the ring in his fingers, the engraving out loud,
Harry did smile now. Draco always acted like these assessments were going to take forever, like he was putting the department behind by taking two or three weeks to identify a potion they hadn't been able to for months, sometimes years. Draco had no idea how slow bureaucracy moved. Harry found it charming.
“My wand?,” he asked.
“And don’t get me wrong. I missed you, after you left. And then after you sent that Patronus, I hated you. But it got me to a mind healer, finally. And she helped me see that we were both just kids making the best choices we knew how to at the time. And I learned to have compassion for teenage Draco, even though he was an arsehole. And to see that he was scared and alone, and that he did the best he could. I started to forgive him.” Draco paused, sighed.
“Want to see something?,” Harry asked. He hadn’t told anyone what he had planned for later tonight, after he and Draco were home again. He wanted to let someone in on his plans, and he couldn’t think of anyone better to confide in than his godson.
"Yes, another thing we have in common. We both seemed to have outlived our life expectancies," Draco answered drily.
Glass smashed, the wine bottle exploded; burgundy pooled on the floor, shards glinted in the light.
"Yes, well, I rather like it when you call me Draco,
Harry stared up at the cracked ceiling in his bedroom, traced the lines in the plaster with his eyes, one arm folded under his head, cigarette in his free hand. Took a long drag, blew it out, watched the blue-grey smoke dissipate in the early golden light; sunlight slanting through the shutters, Vespas humming, voices drifting up.
Draco smiled. “You don’t have to. We could get it delivered.”
“Come on, then,” Draco said.
Saw his drawings through her eyes.
He started to open his mouth, to protest, to say that Harry could have been taken forcibly, that something could be wrong, but she stilled him with a raised hand, oxblood nails flashing.
Harry’s eyes filled, and he brushed at them with the back of his hand. “I know. I know it was. I didn’t. I didn’t think. I left the jeweler’s, and I thought I was apparating back home. I looked up, and I was in Florence. And there I was, just happy I hadn’t fucking splinched myself because my destination had clearly been fucked. I was standing on the bank of the Arno, staring at the Ponte Vecchio. And… and I could finally breathe. I meant to come home. I did. But then. I didn’t,” he ended rather lamely. Draco looked so sad. He wanted to go to him, hold him. Knew he couldn’t.
) or a new sighting, somewhere on the continent. Black hair. A scar. It never amounted to anything. It was only ghosts.
He looked back at his painting, the long limbs;  twisted, abstract. But you could still see the grey eyes, pale hair—the scars. The composition was different, but it was still him.
“I just wanted to know what you wanted to do for dinner.”
He had wound up in Florence, birthplace of the Renaissance.
Harry smiled a bit sheepishly. "Ah, yeah, well. It nearly didn't. It couldn't decide between Slytherin and Gryffindor. So I asked to be put in Gryffindor."
She’d kissed him goodbye, called him tesoro. He loved her.
Dear Mr. Potter,
He felt the air move next to him, felt the heat of Harry’s body near his. Could smell him; he smelled different, smoke and charcoal.
Watched the pile of socks ignite, spreading to the rug. The flames leaped up as Draco concentrated on holding the spell. He was sweating now, his face orange and red, but he didn't stop. He didn’t stop until the ring melted, until it was just a hunk of molten silver.
Harry’s eyes filled. He had thought, maybe hoped. This was the confirmation he needed.
He frowned.  Faced her fully, wanted to see what this was about. “Sí, completamenter,” he answered, carefully.
“Teddy is Harry’s godson, Narcissa. And we’re in a relationship. And, before this stunt, Andy was my aunt who I used to like spending time with.” Draco shot Andromeda a look across the kitchen, and she gave him a small shrug. Harry glowered behind her, arms crossed, in full fuck-you-I’m-Harry-Potter mode. It felt like the wrong moment for Draco to observe that a pissed-off Harry was an incredibly hot Harry. He turned back to his mother.
Nothing could have prepared him for Draco.
He loved Ottavia; he did. But this had a time limit. He couldn’t stay away from England forever. He’d have to go back. He’d sent Draco that Patronus, knew it had found him. Part of Harry hoped he’d get one back.
“What are you doing here, Malfoy?,” Ron asked, curt.
Six months after his trial ended, he got an owl. A potioneer, Angelos Iraklidis, asked if Draco wanted to apprentice with him. Draco was suspicious. Who would possibly want to employ him? His shop, Asclepius Apothecary, was at the far end of Diagon Alley. It wasn’t terribly promising, but Draco needed a job.
Harry started to unbutton Draco's shirt. He put his hand on Harry's, stopped him.
“Malfoy, I—,” Potter started, and Draco held up his hand.
Draco huffed and stood up. "Merlin
He never did.
“It’s extraordinary,” Harry managed to say, avoiding eye contact with Knowlton.
“Draco, please. I’m. I’m bollocksing this up. I am. I’m sorry. I didn’t. I didn’t leave because I didn’t want to marry you, Draco. I left because. I left because…you. You were too—,”
"I'm teasing you because you seem pretty flustered. But, no, I am not fucking with you. I am asking if you, Draco Malfoy, want to go out on a date with me, Harry Potter. In a distinctly unprofessional capacity, so no need to refer to me as Auror Potter. Unless it turns you on, then we can talk about it." And damn. Draco blushed from the bottom of his neck to the tops of his ears. It was adorable.
Harry nodded. “Sure is.”
He was unknown here.
“It’s none of your business. Please. I’m begging you. For the last shred of my sanity. I need you to leave.” Draco started to choke up, his anger dissipating. Pressed his knuckles to his mouth.
“Yeah. I thought I should return it. It came in handy. Killed Voldemort.” He gave a small smile.
It took his breath away, just like Draco.
He loved Harry.
Morgana and Fae Fine Jewelers
Draco rolled his eyes, “I couldn’t possibly know why.” He turned on his heels, and Harry followed him into the back room. Contempt was good. He could deal with a little contempt.
Harry shrugged as best he could with two large cups of coffee in his hands. “Wanted to see if I could still get in.”
Draco agreed with him. Draco was, wait—
*****
“I’m also very sorry your other brother, Fred, died in the battle. He and George were always very entertaining at school, even if I was loath to admit it. And I always did love this shop. I also apologize for using Peruvian Darkness Powder, purchased here, the night that I let Death Eaters into Hogwarts. I know that I cannot possibly hope for your forgiveness, and really, I’m not sure how much good it would do either of us. But an apology is an acknowledgment of harm, and I want to do that. Acknowledge the harm I’ve done. To you.” Draco petered out. He thought he might pass out, his heart beating so fast. Inhale, hold, exhale.
The partially functioning stone resulted in a line of gold shops stacked on top of each other. On a bridge, of all places. Wizards did have a flair for the dramatic.
Draco leaned in to kiss him again, slipped his tongue into Dai's mouth, nipped his lower lip.
Sometimes though.
Ottavia was a choice he made. Just as he’d chosen to stay in Florence, to enroll in art school. He liked his choices so far, even if all of his drawings looked like the same person, long-limbed, sinewy; sharp features and heavy-lidded eyes.
Draco looked down at his hands, felt himself shrink, and the familiar, sullen feeling of his childhood settled over him. “He wouldn’t shake my hand.”
"Yes," Draco sighed. "Yes, it's very much OK. It's just. I don't want you to have a...crisis of conscience, or whatever. I don't want you to feel bad when you—," Draco trailed off, motioning to his torso, still covered by his shirt. Harry had only managed to get two buttons undone before Draco had stopped him.
"Well, next time, maybe don't fight me so much on the finer points of street food, yeah?" Harry's eyes were sparkling behind his glasses, and he tugged Draco closer.
“Oh.”
“Tell me more,” she said.
"Are you good?," Draco asked quietly, running his hands up Harry's back, sending shivers down his spine.
"Depends on how far you take it," Harry raised an eyebrow.
he'd cast wandlessly last night, after they'd accidentally broken the headboard. He thought about casting scourgify on the mark to remove it, but Harry liked thinking about how they’d damaged the headboard. It had been rather fun; he wouldn't mind trying to break it again.
Nine years before
Draco talked to Hermione about him, once, about a month after the searches had stopped. It became clear that, in Harry’s absence, the friendship that had developed between Draco and Ron and Hermione had its limits. He had taken part of Draco with him, but he’d also taken parts of his two best friends. Draco knew there were depths to Harry’s relationship with Ron and Hermione that were unknowable to him. He went to her.
"Everything OK?," Harry asked, concerned. "Is this OK?"
One year after
“Come on, then,” Draco said.
Harry had fallen for Draco, so hard and so fast, he hadn’t ever stopped to think about it. He had seen someone trying to better himself, had seen this person he hated so much, who had done so much damage, take Harry’s advice, and honestly try to live by it every day. Draco was a walking embodiment of all the things Harry had hoped for after the war: a new start, a way forward, a life full of choices. But, for Harry, Draco had also felt inevitable. Like their mirrored histories were, in fact, two halves of the same coin. Like Harry hadn’t had a choice at all. And Draco was going to ask a question he’d have to answer.
Draco nodded, gave him a small smile. “Thank you for being you,” he whispered.
Footsteps thundered down two flights of stairs, and Harry jogged into the sitting room, perfectly disheveled.
He headed to the door, grabbed Sirius’s jacket.
“Love you too, HJ.” Draco kissed the top of her head.
He left the house. Their house. He went to work at Asclepius Apothecary, his now. He brewed potions. He fulfilled orders. He spoke with clients. He ate lunch. He could never remember what he ate. He closed up. He went home. Their home. He stared at the fire. He drank firewhiskey. He ate dinner. He could never remember what he had. He thought about black hair, green eyes, brown hands on pale skin. He thought about the last time he saw him.
“You never sleep,” she said, smiling, as she reached out to trace his scar. She was the only person he had let do that since…since Draco. Harry pushed the thought aside.
"It seems the more likely scenario is that you would have wound up with me in Slytherin," Draco said, a wicked grin on his face, as he shifted closer to Harry. The duvet slipped down further.
“Ewww, stop it, Uncle Harry. Kissing is gross.” Teddy tried to escape.
“Andromeda invited me for dinner, dear. She thought it might be nice to get together, as a family. She says that you and Harry come here often.”
He was back where he belonged.
Draco wasn’t surprised.
“But why are you here? In England.” He was going to need to be specific.
Dr. Ducharme studied him. “Would you say that Harry is also alive because of you?”
One year after
“Draco,” the stern tone was edging back into Pansy’s voice. “I know you thought that Harry loving you was some sort of path to redemption. That if Harry could forgive you, it meant that you wouldn’t have to do it yourself. You need to forgive yourself. For you. He couldn’t save you. And he can’t destroy you. You are better than this, Draco. You are a fucking dragon. Get your shit together.”
“Earth to Potter. Sickle for your thoughts?”
So he stayed. He tried not to think about what he was doing to Draco. To Ron and Hermione, and little Rose. To Teddy and Andromeda. The Weasleys, Ginny; Luna and Neville. He was pleasantly surprised to discover he didn't much give a fuck about what he was doing to his colleagues at the DMLE. Or to Kingsley, for that matter. He knew they’d probably sent out search parties for him. But he also knew they wouldn’t find him. Italian wizards were nothing if not discreet. Too much time hiding in plain sight from the Catholics had given them a particular perspicacity for blending in.
Back at the house, trainers left in the foyer. To the kitchen for coffee—tea was for the afternoon, coffee was for the morning—and toast, buttered with jam. His seat at the table, warm wood with light polish, pockmarks and stains. Each mark, another story. Sometimes he’d go through each one here too, a history of them. Most days he didn’t anymore.
“Acknowledgement of harm,” Potter interrupted. “I do speak to Ron and Hermione, you know,” he said, pointedly.
“And, as you can see, I’m fully recovered from that poisoned wine or whatever the fuck it was, although the real person responsible for saving my sorry arse that day was Harry. One of about fifty times he’s done so. So. Yeah. OK. Thank you for acknowledging…harm done. I reckon you did quite a bit of that.” He let out another breath. “Didn’t seem like your heart was in it at the end, though, yeah?” Ron raised an eyebrow.
“Yes,” Harry breathed. “Yes. I’m staying. But I haven’t seen anyone else. I needed to see you first.”
Dai searched his eyes, Draco’s hand still in his. “You’re serious?,” he asked.
Draco was inevitable.
Draco grinned. “Really?”
It was a history of them, a history of Harry’s family. It was Sirius, Remus, his parents. It was Ron and Hermione, Rose. It was Andromeda and Teddy. Hedwig.
"Come home with me. You won't have to stand anymore," Harry whispered as he planted small kisses on Draco's jawline, the corner of his mouth.
“What exactly do you want me to say, Potter?,” he saw Harry wince at the use of his surname.
“Extra naan?,” Draco called as Harry opened the door.
Draco sank down onto his stool, put his head in his hands. “I don’t want to understand. I’ve already had my heart broken once today. I cannot stand this. I can’t,” he said through his fingers as he pressed them to his eyes.
Draco sat up and put a hand on Harry's chest to still him. "See, you great bloody twit, this is exactly what I didn't want to happen. Having a meltdown about scars that are almost a decade old isn't sexy, Potter. Pull yourself together," he said softly, his tone gentle.
Do you think that if something happened to him, they wouldn’t have found him? He left, Draco. Of his own accord. You need to let him go.”
him. How was Harry ever meant to live his whole life with Draco, without being able to breathe, with needing him so much all the damn time?
He had known he hurt Draco. Hearing about it stung, though. And he didn’t like the idea of someone else having Draco. His Draco. God, he was still so beautiful. But Harry could breathe around him. Didn’t feel like he was drowning, pulled into the raging blue. Took it as a good sign.
Dai huffed. “I can feel you frown. What is it?”
Harry would have done anything to protect Draco, even from Narcissa. Harry knew Draco’s moods, his feelings; he’d do anything to make sure he was OK. Narcissa had saved Harry for Draco. But now Harry would save Draco from everyone. His fierce need to protect Draco, to make him safe, it was overwhelming. It needed air. Harry didn’t have any to give it.
“Oh.” Dinner. Not a ring, then.
Something new.
He hadn’t resolved it.
She frowned. “How can you love a stranger and me?”
Harry stopped thinking.
"Well, how would I know if you're interested in me? You didn't ask me out, and, as far as I can tell, you haven't said yes yet. I have no idea if you're interested." Harry knew he sounded petulant, but he couldn't help it. He was used to Draco being contrary. But if Draco said no, it was going to hurt. More than he’d thought.
Draco liked working with Harry. The potions Harry brought him were always tricky, sometimes dangerous. He liked isolating the ingredients, defining the potion's magical properties, working backward to see what had stumped the (rather ineffective, in Draco's opinion) potions masters at the DMLE. He'd felt proud that Harry had chosen him, had made him an official consultant.
Ten years before
Mr. Iraklidis smiled. “Ah, yes. You see, I was once in a spot of trouble as a young man, and someone gave me a second chance. I read about your trial, and Mr. Potter’s testimony. I was reminded of my own poor choices and of the person who helped me. I thought that, perhaps, it was my time to pay it forward. I also heard that you were quite a good potions student at Hogwarts, so it seems as if it is moíra.”
Draco drank his wine. He knew Pansy was right. He was living in limbo. Circe, even the bloody house felt like it was holding its breath half the time, and the gloom had settled in again since Harry had been gone. He’d told Draco that Grimmauld Place had brightened up, seemed to glow and feel lighter once Draco had moved in. Almost as if it was happy. Harry had joked that the “Noble and Most Ancient House of Black” was finally glad to have one of its own living in it again. Draco liked that idea; it made it seem like they were family. The house, Teddy, Andromeda. Draco had liked it all. Liked being part of Harry’s found family.
After six months of searching, the consensus was that Harry had left. Didn’t want to be found. Ron kept mulling it over like it was a problem he could solve, but, to Draco’s surprise, Hermione had been...resigned. Almost as if she knew something like this was going to happen. She stopped researching. She let it go. She let him go.
Andy was at the stove stirring a pot of something, and looked up when Narcissa cleared her throat. Andy noticed them, frozen on the kitchen threshold. Had the audacity to smile at them.
Art had been a refuge. Harry didn’t think he was particularly good at it, but he liked the mess you had to make when creating something. How you had to keep working at it, how you had to make things that were terrible to be able to make something beautiful. How you could change your mind halfway through; start over, make something new. How you could feel something, deep inside you, and make other people see it too.
“And yes, watching Cedric die just because… because he was fair and wanted to tie for the win. It was horrible. It was the worst thing that had happened to me until that point, which, fuck. Worse things did happen. It was awful. It was a war. We were kids. It wasn't your fault, and it wasn't my fault. Even if it feels like we could have done something different, we didn't, we couldn't. Don't apologize to me for things your father, or Voldemort or—"
He took a long drag of his cigarette, looked back at his painting.
Dai smiled at Draco every morning like it was an easy thing to do. Draco supposed that, for Dai, it was. He let his fingers card through Dai's hair, trail down his back, playfully tap the dimples right above his arse.
Dai studied him some more. “You’re not,” he said simply. Pulled back, walked to the table.
“Let me stop you there, Draco, please. For one moment. Which Unforgivable Curses did you use on people?”
“So. You’re not wrong. I didn’t mean to. I didn’t mean to use you as...a sort of panacea. I just. I had wanted to be your friend, when we were eleven. And then I was your enemy. And then I couldn’t…I couldn’t hurt you, when it came down to it, during the war. I didn’t want to. I never did. A part of me, back then, a part of me wished that you would save me too. And then you did, from the fire and then again, from the Wizengamot.
The convention was in Essaouira, bright white and blue, sandy and windswept. Broad beaches to the west; Acacia trees to the east, artisans shaped the mottled wood into trinkets for tourists. He met up with Angelos, tanned and wrinkled, to drink his mint tea and go over new potions methods; to update ingredients purveyors. They'd walked along the beach, Angelos smoking brown cigarillos, Draco getting color on his cheeks, freckles sprinkling across his nose. Afternoons spent in cafes, taking notes, arguing good-naturedly—did you add aconite to the headache draught before or after the moonstone? Watching football on the telly in the cafe, cheering with the other men.
Wondered what else he could create.
a whispered
Draco couldn’t help but think it was just for him.
“Tell me again what happened, Draco. Did he say anything else?” Hermione was intent.
Draco let out a big exhale. “I really hate to say this, but. It makes sense. It makes a lot of sense.” He leaned back in his chair again, grabbed the coffee.
“Draco, I—,” Harry started. Draco held up a hand to stop him.
An arm slipped around Draco’s waist. He turned to Hermione, drew her in. She leaned her head on his shoulder.
“The same person also told me that the world isn’t divided into good people and Death Eaters. It’s not so black and white.”
Draco pulled back and looked into Harry’s eyes. Harry could drown in those pools of grey, deep as an ocean.
“Yes,” Draco said. “I’m not sure what an exact timeline really has to do with this…” he trailed off.
He felt no good and alone, and he knew.
“Hello, Draco. My love.” She gave him a small simile.
Today was Saturday.
Florence was a city of delights. Harry was happy. He pushed aside thoughts of silver skies and mist, grey eyes, a pale torso—a dim bed, a pale throat that smelled of lemon and thyme, clove and mint. Ottavia smelled like charcoal and tobacco, roses and smoke. She was dark and comfortable, and Harry could lose himself in her hair, her soft body, the way she gasped “non fermarti,”
He didn’t think it could break again.
Harry took the wine glass out of Ottavia’s hand and led her to his bed. He could answer any questions she asked him there. He couldn’t answer anything else.
Two Years Before
“No,” Harry said. “No, I’m sorry, Draco, I can’t. I can’t leave until you understand.”
Potter was still silent, and Draco hazarded a glance in his direction. He had a grim expression on his face, bordering on a scowl. But as a person with a semi-permanent frown, Draco knew that Harry could just be thinking. He figured he’d find out either way, regardless.
Harry took a deep breath. Finally took his hands out of his pockets. “I saw the ring,” he said, softly.
"Only if you're lucky," Draco winked.
“That he is,” Harry nodded. “Thank you. I’ll be off.”
“I’d like to apologize to you, Weas- ah, Ron. If I may call you Ron...” Draco hesitated, but Weasley’s eyes just narrowed further, so he plowed on. “I understand that my actions toward you in school were abhorrent, and I want to apologize for goading you, and making fun of your family, and for generally being a little prick. Until the time I went from prick to full cult initiate, when I escalated my behavior from terrible to dangerous. I’d also like to apologize for you getting hurt during my rather pathetic attempt to, ah,” he stumbled a bit. “Dumbledore. And for letting Death Eaters into Hogwarts, and for my part in your brother getting hurt that night.
“Yeah, I’ve seen you around,” Ron answered gruffly. “I don’t see how we could possibly have anything to talk about, though, Malfoy, so why don’t you just tell me why you’re here. The sooner I know what you want, the sooner I can tell you to bugger off, yeah?”
“Well, now all you have to do is work up the nerve to ask Draco to marry you.”
Draco looked at his attorney, who shrugged. “You’re free and no longer my problem.” He strode off.
Draco understood.
Draco touched his arm. Harry looked down, and Draco gave him a small smile. “Harry, I’ve got this. Thank you.” Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Draco just squeezed his arm and nodded. “It’s OK. I promise.”
Ron snorted. “Don’t I bloody half well know it. OK, Malfoy, you’ve said your piece to me. Who’s next on your apology world tour, eh? Let me give you a clue: if it’s not Harry, it better fucking well be.”
“Yes, I understand, but how exactly would you characterize our relationship as ‘successful’ when one half of it left like a thief in the night?,” Draco felt his blood start to boil again. That fucking stag.
He got up, went to the bathroom, took a slash, brushed his teeth with a stupid Muggle toothbrush, two full minutes, for what. Got his running kit on. He needed to run every day, no matter the weather. Forty minutes, four miles, no exceptions. It helped clear his head, get rid of the ghosts. As much he ever really could.
Draco pulled back so he could look into Harry's eyes, those green depths.
at me? Merlin, Godric, and Salazar too. I never thought I'd live to see it. Never thought I'd live to see much, but certainly not this," Harry said, mock-serious.
Draco stared at her. She stared back, face politely blank and a little expectant. Fuck, why had he agreed with Pansy?
"Might I inquire as to why, exactly, you'd like to go on a date? With me?" Harry was pretty sure Draco had been aiming for sounding dignified, but it came off almost shy.
“You berk,” Draco said and kissed him on the mouth, for real this time.
“And why did you do these things?”
Draco stilled. "What?"
Dai had set the paper bag down on the table between the wingback chairs and emptied the crate, full to the brim with plant specimens. He laid them out on the second worktable they’d added for Dai. It was a veritable indoor garden; clippings and seedlings under UV light charms, larger plants and trees stacked in the back, near the windows, tools and notebooks scattered throughout. Draco loved it.
Slowly, Draco found himself looking forward to his visits, his coffees, his questions. The same as he had, before.
Draco walked to the back counter and tried to calm his nerves. His parole-mandated mind healer had taught him breathing exercises for his anxiety—in for four, hold, out for four. He saw a red-haired man with a beard emerge from the back room, a stack of boxes in his arms. He put them down on the counter and looked up. Narrowed eyes, tense shoulders. Ron, then. Draco remembered that body language, coiled and ready to strike, as he had hurled insults at Weasley at school. He looked good, though. As tall as Draco but broader through the shoulders and torso with a rather luxurious beard. Draco thought it suited him very well. Hid his weak chin, too.
