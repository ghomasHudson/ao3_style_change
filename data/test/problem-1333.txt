They’ve taken turns washing and scrubbing away the blood from the night before. Draco watches the way sweat and water drip down Potter’s back, and can see very clearly that under his henley he’s lean with muscle. His gaze lingers just a tad longer when Potter turns so his back is facing Draco, and he sees the tattoo. The harsh black words put there against his will indicating that his blood type is O negative and considered a universal donor. Draco wonders what Potter has done to get to where he is now. He wants to know everything about him; wants to know if he’s also dreamed of seeing his loved ones again.
He looks up and catches the wrench Ginny tosses to him and slams it down hard, narrowly missing the blood bag’s head. Pain blossoms in his skull as he’s headbutted hard. When his vision focuses he sees that the blood bag is falling backwards helplessly, dragged across the sand by the Wives who pull hard on the chain still tied to his muzzle. Draco stands and grabs the blood bag by the muzzle and whirls him hard against the water tank.
* * *
He climbs off and walks with Potter until they see which tires are embedded in the mud. The others are already awake, climbing out of the Rig. Luna wanders off and Draco watches her, notices the way she is staring out into the distance, into nothingness.
“Hope. A new home.”
Her embrace is soft and tight.
The Rig then rams into the Gigahorse and the momentum knocks Draco and the war boy both off the vehicle but Harry is there, grabbing onto Draco as he hoists himself against the window by the driver’s seat and moves forward, harpoon in his other hand. Harry spares a glance down just as the war boy dies instantly, his body crushed by the wheels.
“An Imperator who lets their guard down next to their own Rig?” a voice says right next to his ear and Draco bristles. Something about the voice tugs on feelings long buried deep in his chest.
“Do you remember?” Potter asks. He looks about the gallery room instead, avoiding Draco's gaze.
“Enough,” Draco says. “I’m saving your life. You wouldn’t survive one second out here.”
“Can’t let my guests go hungry in the middle of the night,” Draco explains. “Especially after a good fuck.”
“What if you’re not back before the engines have cooled?”
Playfully scoffing at Potter she instead hands him her empty champagne glass.
Harry laughs, “Yeah, that too. You stayed after to help though, you and Pansy.”
“I’m sorry,” Pansy says the following morning. She climbs on the motorcycle behind Draco and leans her head against his back and wraps her arms around his waist. “I really thought he would come with us.”
Draco arrives in London at 12:45 on a Wednesday. The first thing he does after he checks into his hotel is visit the National Portrait Gallery. He’s been away two years and luckily his trip back coincides with catching the very last days of a traveling exhibition that first opened in Madrid.
He walks to the War Rig and opens the door and climbs inside. The other war boys and lancers get into position. Immortan Lucius appears not a second too late. Draco looks up and watches him, sees the way he points down to the stragglers of the Citadel as if they are vermin. He can hear all too clearly the disappointment in his father’s voice. Lucius stares down at them all, his blond hair wild, thin and frayed blowing in the wind. His white robes dotted with metal pins and other trinkets he’s stolen and claimed for his own, and of course, the large belt that holds the metal brand of the Citadel: a skull with a snake coming out of its open mouth.
“I’m sure you will find something,” his mother answers and goes back to her book. Draco knows then that the conversation is over. He turns and leaves and swears that he sees the faintest hint of a smile on his mother’s face.
He practically has to kick his aunt out of the kitchen afterward. She lingers and wants to help clean up, but Draco waves her off, and has magic starting all the work. He cleans the wine glasses by hand though, that’s something he’s content to do himself every time.
There’s a knock and Draco turns and Potter is there because of course there is nowhere in this forsaken estate that he can hide for any longer than five minutes.
Harry doesn’t see what gets pulled out. All that he cares about is catching Draco, pulling him back to safety.
“I’m not sure what you mean,” he says, eyeing Ginny suspiciously.
He leans his forehead against Harry’s and catches the little sighs pouring out of him with every thrust. Draco loves him so much, wants Harry like this all the time. He wants to be close to Harry in every way.
Draco taps his wand against his arm and rethinks a few things. Mainly the position of the wreaths wrapping around the staircase. It's a bit much, he decides. With the flick of his wand, he rearranges it. He decided to take the day off and work about the house preparing to receive his family for Christmas. He's managed this year to not fuck up and bring in the tree without knocking things over. He's set all the ornament boxes on the drawing table.
He catches up to them and Draco can see the rage on Lucius’ face. The result of having what’s most precious to him stolen. Lucius doesn’t hesitate in aiming his favorite hand cannon at Draco. Suddenly Padma is there with Draco, standing in front of him, using herself as a shield and Lucius falters. Potter takes the opportunity to drive the Rig up next to Lucius’s vehicle, the Gigahorse. Draco and Potter take aim but it's no use. As long as there are war boys around, they will always throw themselves in the line of fire for their Immortan.
“Your fight’s with me,” he says and raises his fist.
“What does it feel like now?” Draco asks though a frail part of him knows the answer already.
Hope. It feels daft now and slowly spills out of him as if he’s been stabbed. They’re looking at him with such remorse and pity in their eyes that he can’t handle it. He pulls free and walks. He can hear the faint calls of his name, but he can’t turn around, he just keeps going. He’s not wearing his brace, but it doesn’t matter. When he feels his leg start to shake he lets himself fall onto his knees, lips trembling.
Draco meets his eyes and he smiles.
“Pray tell what you have been up to, Potter?”
In the morning Draco wakes and he takes his time getting dressed. Today is his last day at the Citadel. There is no room for error even though a storm is thrumming inside him, wrecking his nerves. Everything he’s worked hard for has come to this moment. Today he escapes. He greets his lieutenants and when they hand him the steering wheel, he holds on tight until his knuckles are white.
“Draco, it’s perfect,” Harry says and reaches for one of the grapes.
“She died,” Blaise answers, their eyes dull with grief. “A week after she got here. Her injuries were too severe. We tried everything, we really did.”
Out on the balcony, the only light is coming from the candles in the hallway. In the moonlight, Pansy looks divine even though she’s got hours and hours of dancing under her belt. She sways a little with her steps and he takes her hand and helps her lean against the railing.
“How many did you save?”
He places something in Draco’s hand and it’s small. It sits in his palm, red as blood with small green leaves at one end.
“Is that your name?” Draco then asks, pointing towards the patch instead.
Ginny is on the other side and when she sees Draco, she exclaims and throws herself at him. He wraps his arms around Ginny and hugs her back. He’s missed her.
“I have to tell you something,” Draco starts and winces as soon as he says it. Merlin, he really should have practiced this beforehand.
“For you? Always.” Draco says, lips ghosting over Harry’s neck, “I want to hear you.”
He waits for a reaction at the mention of family but Potter doesn’t say anything.
Harry feels hands clasp his and he leans into Draco. He freezes when Draco starts to wheeze. His hands move all across Draco’s body and he grimaces when his hand slides messily against the blood drenching his shirt and belts. Hermione comes to sit in front of Draco, her hands reaching for his face.
Harry’s eyes are dark when he leans off the door. “Bed,” he nearly growls.
Draco’s friendship with Hermione is one that he doesn’t take for granted. He returned to Hogwarts for his eighth year along with Blaise and Pansy and found out that Hermione, too, had returned. Weasley and Potter remained in London to start their Auror training at the Ministry.
Her laugh is vicious and ugly. And she’s fast, catching his fist easily. The punch to his jaw is hard and hurts like hell. He loses his balance and falls back.
Draco takes his time and starts pushing back in, letting Harry get used to him before gently pulling back. He wants to be good for Harry so he waits until he feels Harry relax more into it, getting used to Draco, and gods, it’s everything. Harry’s legs wrap around his waist, crowding him.
The question doesn’t throw him off, but it does send him down a spiral of what-ifs. He thinks of what he’s missed out on if he did and finds regret settling deep in the pit of his stomach.
Draco looks up at him. “We go back?”
“Want you inside of me,” Harry breathes against his lips, “Please?”
“Merlin, Potter, I’m only thorough when I’m pissed out of my wits. Once you get me going on my work, I can’t seem to shut up.”
Draco, confused, looks at his aunt and then Potter is coming through the door as well and fuck. He walks out the door again before Draco can think of what to say.
He looks back out to the Rig and watches as the rest of the Wives and Vuvalini make their way across. Bellatrix moves to follow them but Minerva slams on the brakes and creates some distance between the two vehicles. Harry watches as Poppy looks at the Rig, at Minerva, and lifts her arm out as if grasping something and pulls it back close to her chest. The Rig violently swerves and flips over. The last thing Harry sees is Bellatrix’s body go under the wheels. What’s left of the Pass crumbles into dust, fire, and smoke.
“I’ll be fine,” Draco sighs. “Just really need you.”
“Does it matter?” he replies, voice rough and right next to his ear and Draco shivers. Then he’s off Draco.
“Cut these, would you please?” he says, pushing the cutting board full of limes. He tries not to stare, but can’t help himself. Potter works with such finesse. He watches the way his fingers hold the knife and notices then that he’s rolled his sleeves up to reveal his forearms.
The thing about decorating the tree is that Teddy loves doing it by hand. Draco helps wrap the lights with Potter as Teddy stands off to the side and directs them. It becomes rather endearing actually with Teddy telling them which ornament goes where. The tree this year is a gorgeous lush pine that he picked from the village with the help of Pietro, his neighbor.
The next time Harry comes back from patrol, he barely has enough time to see Draco before he’s being called away to council.
He knows his lips are red and can feel Draco’s gaze on him, hot and fierce. Instead Draco pulls his hand back and takes a bite of his own. Harry watches him, with a warm smile on his face. Draco’s eyes widen as he chews. Harry lifts a finger and swipes a droplet of juice at the corner of his mouth.
“And what’s that?” Draco asks, though he thinks he knows the answer. He can see it in Potter’s eyes: the briefest glimpse of tenderness.
“Did you ever think of me?” he finds himself asking when he pulls off Harry’s cock with a wet pop. He has to know.
“Are you alright?” Ginny asks Potter, looking down at his hand. “I can heal your wound if you would like me to.”
“Wasn’t nearly fast enough. For her, I mean. She got away in the end.” Potter says and there’s bitterness in his voice.
The other war boys surrounding him yell at him and call him a traitor, but their threats soon turn into screams when Draco turns the steering wheel a little to the left and rams them into a swirling vortex. He watches as the vehicles get tossed up and explode in a cloud of fire and smoke, the storm lightning making vivid silhouettes of the bodies flying in the air. He barely has time to swerve to the right when one vehicle falls out of the sky and lands in front of him in an explosion of dust. He knows he’s got one more on his tail.
Harry then reaches for him. Draco closes his eyes when he feels Harry’s hand on the back of his head, lightly pulling until their foreheads touch. Though Draco had been the one to initiate it many moons ago, he had soon learned to keep his distance. The first time Harry had initiated it, though, Draco was too stunned to say anything. The shock was all over his face and he couldn’t stop staring even after Harry closed his eyes. A clear sign that he felt safe, here with Draco like this. And this is what Harry loves the most about Draco—the easy silence that falls between them every time they’re together. His touch says everything.
Smoke starts to rise from the hood of the radiators of the Rig. They could be on verge of overheating the engine at any second. They need to do something fast.
He rummages through the compartment again until he pulls a tubing string and two needles. The rest of them watch him work and he quietly thanks Hermione when she helps him pull back his own sleeve so that he can slide the needle into his arm.
Potter is practically in his space now and he’s so close. He grabs at the collar of Potter’s sweater, pulling him close until he’s flush against him. He can smell Potter, the hint of cedarwood mixed with the soap Draco keeps in the guest bathroom; the smell of Harry.
“Was that....?” he starts, raising an eyebrow.
“What about home?”
He stands to the side and watches the way Potter’s brow furrows as he reads further deeper into the description of the piece. When he’s done, Draco hears the soft intake of breath and he takes Potter’s hand and presses a candy into his palm. Potter looks at him with sad somber eyes.
“Hear that, Draco? My wife is looking for me. Do get home in one piece, alright? See you at New Years,” she says before leaving.
“The nightmares,” Luna asks him one day. “They’re not as loud anymore, are they?”
“You’ll see,” she says with a small smile, “Hold out your hand.”
Draco collapses in his arms, his back to Harry’s chest. Through the open hatch, Harry sees the corpse of Immortan Lucius fall from the driver’s seat. His jaw is missing. Pansy moves and takes control of the vehicle. Draco sags in his arms and Harry cradles him close.
“Well, there is the issue in that I wasn’t expecting him so I certainly don’t have a Christmas present for him,” he finds himself admitting. And it’s true. He hasn’t the faintest idea of what to do. He doesn’t even know if he should be thinking if Potter has gotten anything for him either.
“I’ve forgotten what it’s like to be around others,” Potter says after, quietly. He looks down at his hands. “Being with you made me feel something I didn’t think I had in me anymore.”
“I don’t know if I would have,” he answers truthfully. He needed that small push, a small leap of faith. He thinks that he needed to come back one more time to finally realize it. And he feels so selfish about it. But this time, it feels right. Draco has missed him. “I think there was a part of me that was afraid it wasn’t going to be the same. Five years is a long time, Harry.”
“I don’t know, is there something you’re not telling me?” she asks quietly before greeting Potter. Pansy in particular got along with Potter far more than Draco could have ever imagined. It wasn't weird anymore, seeing his friends with Potter's friends. He looked at them with a warm feeling in his chest and moved on.
Harry reaches for his plate of buttered toast and takes a bite and goes back to reading his book.
At the same time there’s screaming behind him and when Draco turns, he’s too late.
He can’t meet Potter in the eyes, not yet when he’s so afraid of what this might mean.
“Hm?” Harry says, looking up from the book he’s been reading, one eye closed.
“The bog,” Luna then says. “With all the crows. That was your home, wasn’t it?”
“Some days are better than others. I'm happier, though. Being Head Auror wasn't turning out to be the way I had thought it would.” Potter says. "Thanks for asking by the way. About how I'm doing. People ask me what I'm going to do instead of asking how I'm doing."
The sharp pain at his side comes from nowhere and Draco screams. Pain sparks from his ribs and spreads down his spine and he gasps. He turns and sees a dagger buried deep at his side. Tears well up at how much it hurts and he starts to feel weak. His vision blurs and dark spots start to dance in the corners of his vision. His grip on Potter starts to slip but he holds on. There’s worry in Potter’s eyes as if he knows something’s wrong. Potter then leans up and finally latches onto the bars of the truck and Draco lets him go.
He can feel Potter’s eyes watching him as he works and finds it oddly comforting. Teddy shows up not too long after, practically bursting at the seams wanting to go outside and play in the snow. And who is Draco to deny him that? He’s working on buttoning up Teddy’s winter coat when Potter reaches for his jacket from the coat rack.
Pleasure rushes over him in waves, warm and sweet. He lets himself come, crying out into Harry’s neck, stills his hips, burying himself deep in Harry, and fills him up with warmth.
He carefully thinks about what to say next. He’s thought about it before but also because he knows that a few others are listening in. In the end, he aims for a lighter response which for the most part calms everyone’s curiosity.
Knowing he’s being watched, Draco slowly moves and starts the sequence to start the Rig. He reaches in between his legs under his seat until he pulls out a file and hands it out to Potter.
Luna gives Draco a sideways glance before she picks up the water hose and starts walking. The metal beads in her pale hair shine bright, her hair wild and long. She holds out the hose and he takes it from her, turns the lever and aims it directly into his face. Water splashes into his face as he gets his fill like a thirsty dog.
“Pansy,” Luna says, voice lowered, “Is that just the wind or is it some furious vexation?”
“Show off,” Draco murmurs and reaches for the lube he keeps on the bedside table.
“7,000 days,” he says, unable to hold back the genuine joy in his voice, “plus the ones I don’t remember.”
As usual, he has an escort led by one of his lieutenants, Ace. Assigned to protect the War Rig but most especially the supply they ran. He’s never failed Draco. They bring along a couple of pursuit vehicles with lancers to make sure they don't get raided by the other clans that cross over into their territory. Nothing Draco can’t handle.
Draco suddenly feels strung open as if he’s missing out on something. He knows that Pansy and Potter get along better these days after having worked together at the Ministry. From the sounds of it that friendship went far deeper than he imagined.
“Well, I didn’t,” Ginny replies and presses her forehead against Luna’s and the Wives hug each other.
“It’s practically unguarded.” Pansy says behind him. “All the war boys are out here looking for us. All that’s left are sick war pups and half-lives anyway, too sick to fight.”
“I already have plans for lunch,” Draco admits and watches the way Potter nods, trying to cool his expression. “With my mother, you see,” he adds. “But, I was planning on going to the Tate Modern afterward if you wanted to come with me? And then maybe we can get dinner?”
“A little war won’t kill you,” Draco mutters to himself. It’s obviously not what they wanted to hear but Draco has other plans. And places to be. Specifically on the other side of this Pass. He’s close to unhooking the guzzoline pod when there’s a sound.
She turns and beckons to the door. “I don’t know why he always insists on helping when I am perfectly capable of carrying my own things,” she muses. Then she looks at Draco and her smile is warm. “Draco, dear, I’m so sorry we’re late. We had a bit of a late start. And we brought Harry with us. I do hope that’s okay.”
“Don’t,” Blaise says then, shaking their head. The long metal earrings adorning their ears clink together. “Every one of us had our own battles to fight. Your path was different. What’s important is that it brought you back to us.”
Draco takes off his blazer and carefully folds it next to the leather-bound notebook. His Christmas present from Harry. He keeps it at his side always.
Harry is utterly helpless so he only groans his response. Then he’s being pushed down again and he relaxes his throat, taking Draco deeper and it’s fucking perfect. His own cock is hard, flushed rubbing painfully against his pants.
Potter doesn’t wait for Draco and starts walking. Draco watches him leave until he sees nothing but fog.
He’s looking at Draco, through the metal muzzle, his eyes narrowed against the gust of wind and sand. Just then, Draco feels the Rig jostle forward, his body jerking with momentum. Someone’s behind him, ramming into the Rig.
“Remember me?” Draco says to Lucius and slams the harpoon inside. He lets go of the cable and it coils against the wheels and it snaps, pulling the harpoon back hard. There’s blood and a horrible sound.
“You have to mean it, boy,” she says with a mouth full of blood and rotten teeth. “Killing me won’t bring him back.”
The study is one of his favorite rooms of the house. It also has a splendid view of the Arno and he redid the window seats after moving in, making it cozier. He sets aside the papers scattered all over his desk and with a wave of his wand, he transfigures the table into a comfortable twin-sized bed.
Draco leans forward and soft lips are there to catch his and it’s everything. Kissing Harry again after all this time, so easy and so familiar. His heart thrums against his ribcage and he sighs when Harry bites his lower lip before running a tentative tongue over it. Nothing was ever shy between them. This time, Draco takes what Harry was always willing to offer.
“No,” Draco then admits, turning to Potter and watching him. Potter and art have always had such a soft spot in his heart. Draco is glad he can share this with him. “I didn’t want to push you away.”
“My name,” Harry says, “Say it again.”
The pain takes a second to set in, his mind too slow to register how it happens, only that there's something warm and hot on his back. He blinks, eyes readjusting to the moonlight shining down at him. He’s on the ground. The snarl that follows is deafening.
“You’re shameless,” Harry sighs, resting his head against the door and thrusts into Draco’s hand.
“Patience is a virtue,” Draco murmurs.
Harry comes with a cry, untouched and all over himself. Draco’s thrusts become erratic when he feels Harry clench down hard on his cock, riding his orgasm. He leans down to kiss Harry through the last of the aftershocks of pleasure. He’s breathing hard, he’s so close, and suddenly Harry’s hands are on his face, pulling him close. His lips slide across Draco’s cheek, murmuring his name and sweet nothings, breath hot. Telling Draco he’s
“You’ve made a lovely home here,” Potter says later. Everyone else has retired to bed.
“My turn,” Draco then says and pulls Harry off his cock. He gasps and licks his lips. He lets himself fall back on the bed and pulls his own pants down his hips. Draco slides out of his shirt and lets it fall around his waist, neither of them mind. All they can focus on is the feeling once Draco straddles him. He grinds up against Draco and it feels amazing.
One down three more to go.
When Draco climbs inside the Rig, Potter is there with a rifle already waiting and he takes it. They say nothing, only look at each other in acknowledgement before Draco sees the bikes over Potter’s shoulder and aims.
Draco looks around, searching. “There are so few of you left...” he muses. “Is everyone back home?”
He eventually finds an empty bench to sit on in the middle of a gallery room with Victorian portraits, and takes out his notebook. He flips through the pages, past dozens of sketch drawings and notes. He likes to write notes to preserve and cherish the memory of his visit. He returns to his hotel later that night and skips out on dinner just for the sake of catching up on sleep. He wakes early the following morning and orders room service and sits by the window. He eats his toast with marmalade, licking butter off his fingers, and drinks his tea. He knows he should send word to his mother that he’s arrived, but he’s not due back at the Manor until Sunday.
“I wish everyone would stop calling me that.”
He’s clearing the sand off the front of the hood of the Rig when he hears the screams. Alarmed, he slowly walks around the Rig until he sees them huddled together. The water hose now long forgotten at their feet, spitting out water. They stopped after the storm to clear the sand off the Rig and their clothes. He follows their line of sight and in the distance he sees a figure approaching them. His eyes widen when he recognizes them and sees that they’re carrying a body over their shoulders.
“I just got here and now you have to leave,” Harry says, not caring if he sounds like he’s complaining because he is.
“The earth was too sick. We couldn’t plant anything,” Pomona explains. “And your mother, Draco...”
“What? Of course, I have. I just wasn’t sure if that’s what you wanted. I mean, if you still do or if you don’t anymore that’s perfectly fine. I—” Draco stops and breathes because he’s doing the thing again. “I just wasn’t sure anymore. If you still wanted me.”
to Draco, makes his cock ache. Having Harry on his bed once more overwhelms him. That they’re doing this.
“Hi,” Potter then says, ducking his head and smiling sheepishly. “Surprise?”
“So you’ve thought about it then? About us, I mean,” Potter looks at Draco, eyes full of hope. With that same expression that Draco could never find the will to say no to before. He finds that years later, he still can’t. He lets himself have this and lets his fingers slide into Potter’s.
Twenty minutes into their drive, it’s now or never. Draco turns the steering wheel and diverts the Rig off the main road.
They hear screams and see two werewolves on the roof of the Rig, trying to get inside. He watches as one tears into the metal roof of the Rig and easily pulls back the metal like torn fabric. Draco can’t run. He tries, but it falls flat, his leg locking in place. It’s enough to make him dizzy. Potter tries to reload his pistol but he drops a bullet. His blood soaked hands are shaking and he curses under his breath.
“Here,” Draco says, reaching for Potter’s coat, “There’s a coat rack just over here.”
When his mother arrives, Draco notices she doesn't look all that surprised at seeing Potter in her son’s kitchen. What surprises Draco most of all though is that she comes up to him for a hug and then places her hands on his cheeks, and presses a small kiss on top of his head.
“It’s a fruit. It’s called a strawberry.”
“Look at me,” Draco says and his heart swells tenfold when Harry opens his eyes. Eyes like wonder, full of love stare back at him and it overwhelms him. He leans down to catch Harry’s lips in a kiss until Harry breaks the kiss to groan.
“Do you want that thing off your face?”
Still, this was the Citadel.
“Sleeping next to someone you trust does that to you. Makes you feel safe even if they come back around.” She looks at Harry with a knowing look that makes him feel as if she can read his thoughts and see into him.
“Are you hurt, Potter? You’re bleeding,” Luna says. There’s blood all over the right side of his face, hair wet and sticking to his forehead. Draco wants to step forward and brush Potter’s hair back.
“Then the sooner we get the Rig out of the mud, the faster we get out of here,” Draco says. “Padma, put up the wards.”
He steals a moment to admire Harry like this, looking so at peace and so content. His linen shirt is open with two buttons undone and some of his chest hair peeks out. His sleeves rolled up to his forearms.
Potter takes over and drives while Draco works on some repairs under the Rig. If any one of them had planned on getting some sleep, it’s now all lost. He spends the rest of the early morning getting lost in the mundane work of repairs. The engines are still overworked from earlier and doing this keeps his mind off what just happened. His leg still hurts like hell, but he presses on. He turns a flashlight on and focuses on what needs to be done.
“What?” the person next to him says, and they take off the scarf wrapped around their head, pulls down their goggles and Draco looks into Hermione Granger’s eyes.
“Happy Christmas, Harry,” he says and lets himself sleep too.
He leans forward and gently presses his lips to Draco’s forehead.
Potter comes back around with the rifle and aims for the search light. He misses.
“I’ll make my own way,” Potter eventually says, voice quiet.
“Here,” Draco says and he slowly pulls out and they both hiss at the loss of contact. He runs a hand through his hair before reaching over for a pillow, lightly taps Harry’s hips, and settles the pillow underneath.
“Why is he even coming? He just tried to kill you,” she says, voice so sure and aware of the fact that Potter is sitting right there. Draco slightly smiles at her straightforwardness, though. She’s never been shy or one to hold back.
“You said a few vehicles in pursuit. Three war parties was not part of the deal!”
Draco takes another bite.
He pointedly avoids looking at the door until his aunt is hugging him and giving a kiss on the cheek. She brings him back to the present.
“Harry,” he tells Draco. “My name is Harry.”
He’s heard of house magic of course and knows that some ancestral homes become sentient. He’s curious and wants to know more but suddenly there’s a growl so loud and so deep and Draco feels it. He’s awake now and looks at Harry quizzically.
“I daresay that Teddy might even make league before he’s out of Hogwarts,” Draco murmurs.
“I’m sorry,” Draco says, smiling and wraps his arms around Harry and hugs him tight. He’ll never get over how perfectly Draco fits in his arms. “Rest now, you’re home.”
“Don’t move,” Draco says to Pansy. He looks for Potter but he’s nowhere to be seen, possibly on the opposite side of the Rig.
* * *
“Makes getting up early all worth it. And I guess my fiancée does have some amazing ideas,” Blaise agrees.
“No unnecessary killing!” he hears Padma shout.
“He misses you, you know that right?” Pansy then says, tone turning somber and quiet.
“My stomach? Er, yeah. Mhm,” Harry looks anywhere but at Draco, suddenly embarrassed.
“Don’t let go,” he whispers to Potter, voice haggard. “Not yet.”
Potter sets the empty champagne glass on the table.
His hands tremble as he turns on the Rig, pushing on the engine switch. The engine roars to life and it settles his nerves, hearing the familiar sound. He lets out a shaky breath, shivering when he pulls on the horn, signaling their departure. The remaining war boys and Death Eaters clear a path for the Rig, kicking and pushing the stragglers off the main road.
Draco watches from the hood of the Rig, knowing exactly what Ginny’s about to do. She waits again for his permission before she takes his hand and starts running her fingers over the open gash. She whispers words, in a language he doesn’t understand, and Draco watches the way Potter’s eyes widen. The gash on his wound closes up until it’s scabbed over, still red and tender.
“Silencing charms?”
. Draco wants to taste him so badly.
“I’m sorry,” Draco says, leaning down and pressing a kiss to his forehead. “I didn’t mean to wake you. I just wanted to get some water.”
* * *
“I’ve been through worse,” the blood bag says and Draco believes him.
“That’s not his blood,” Draco answers for him. Potter holds out a steering wheel and Draco takes it, a small grin pulling at his lips.
“Yes, anything,” Draco says and kisses Harry again. He reaches down, grips Harry at the base of his cock and feels a thrill when Harry moans against his lips. Eventually, he sits back up and starts working on unbuttoning the rest of his shirt when with another flick of Harry’s hand, Draco’s shirt and pants are gone.
They both catch their breath and eventually Draco gets up, hissing when his cock slides out of Harry. Knowing that Harry is spent, he walks over to his wand and casts a cleaning charm on them both. He climbs back into bed and lets himself get pulled into Harry’s arms. His lips tingle and throb but he still turns to kiss Harry, as if to remind himself that this is quite real. Their noses bump and teeth clatter when Harry laughs and Draco tries to shut him up.
He relaxes his throat, letting Harry fuck into his mouth, and feels his jaw start to strain. It’s a good kind of pain. One that he’s missed. He meets Harry’s eyes, staring back at him as he bobs his head.
“That was—” Draco says at the same time.
“I don’t like this place,” Pansy says next to them. “It doesn’t feel right.”
Draco makes himself useful and lifts the pistol, levels his aim and waits for the perfect shot. One werewolf falls over onto the sand, dead. There’s only one left and it jumps off the Rig and starts running towards a search light, far in the distance from where they came.
“Something the matter?” he feigns, shuffling out of his trench coat.
“It’s me,” Draco finds himself saying though he feels his heart at his throat. The look of shock followed by recognition on her face does something to his resolve. Hermione gasps and she leans in, pressing her forehead against his and she laughs and he smiles,
“We’re going to the Green Place,” she tells the blood bag. She holds out the bolt cutters and he takes them, finally freeing himself. He throws the bolt cutters and climbs inside the Rig.
"You just never mentioned it, is all," Draco says to his mother when he pries. Since when? For how long?
“More,” Harry begs, nodding feverishly when Draco adds a third finger. He mouths at Harry’s navel, leaves kisses on the taut skin, the pubic hair that pools at his groin, and pointedly avoids his cock. He kisses the inside of Harry’s thigh and feels a thrill when Harry rocks back against his hand, clenching hard. Harry’s hands coming up to fit through Draco’s hair in complete desperation.
He spares a glance down at the driver’s seat and sees Minerva at the wheel. She looks up at him. “Hurry! We’re almost at the Pass.”
“Put down the wine, mother,” Draco later says, offering his hand to his mother. She looks at him, surprised. “Dance with me.”
“Honestly? I think it’s incredible.”
“There’s a bathroom just down the hall to your right. If you need anything, just let me know.”
“Flattery gets you nowhere.”
When he presses on Harry’s prostate, Harry arches off the bed, hands grabbing at the sheets, and his thighs start to tremble.
found you? What exactly was your plan?” he finds himself asking, curious.
“So why did you stay? Why come with us?”
He’s so focused that he misses the fact that he’s no longer alone.
The truck he’s driving is threatening to burst at any second and when Harry looks behind, he can see the large clouds of smoke coming from the enormous gas tank. He needs to get off before he’s engulfed in flames. From the window he sees Ginny and she’s looking straight at him.
He looks across to Potter who has also gone completely still, holding the water container in his hands. He slowly moves, climbing down the Rig until he feels the solid ground under his boots. There’s no time to get the guns in the Rig, opening the door would be loud enough. Out of the corner of his eye he can see Luna and Ginny, huddled and slowly backing into the side of the Rig. Pansy is at the front, her arms spread in front them.
“Nightmares?”
Together with the help of Blaise's assistant, they help him dress. Blaise also designed the robes for his wedding party. They are a gorgeous mixture of dark green fabrics. Blaise’s own robes are double-lined with black and a pale grey, soft and fine. He wears a muggle suit that’s fitted to perfection. He looks incredible and Draco can’t keep the smile off his face.
He helps Draco undress, fingers softly pulling his pants down his hips until his cock springs free. His eyes trail down Draco’s body and his hands move over his legs, thighs, and then his knees. He leans down and presses a soft kiss to the side of his left knee, mouth lightly tracing the marred skin before sliding up to the inside of his thigh.
Draco doesn’t respond but he gives her hand a gentle squeeze.
“Yeah,” Harry breathes, gasping softly when Draco wraps his other hand around his cock and gives him a firm stroke, thumb softly grazing over the head.
“Alright, alright,” Harry says with red swollen lips and Draco holds back the need to run his fingers over those lips.
Draco reaches for Potter like a lifeline and catches him by the leg before he falls off the Rig completely. He grits his teeth at the sudden weight pulling him down. Potter looks up at him with surprise. Out of the corner of his eye, he can see Luna and Ginny hold Potter by the other leg. There’s a pursuit vehicle in between the Rig and polecat truck and they press on the gas, speeding to ram into the Rig and Potter. Draco turns the steering wheel a little to the left so that the Rig crushes the vehicle against the truck instead. It goes up in an explosion of flames, the metal crushing under immense pressure.
When Draco comes back he feels their bed tip with his weight. Harry shuffles back to make room.
“Get inside!” Draco yells at them, voice cutting off with a choke as he’s lifted off the ground. A clawed hand closes around his throat with a pressure he’s never felt before, and for a second his vision darkens. He’s slammed against the water tank of the Rig, the air torn out of his heaving lungs. He lifts the pistol and fires, closing his eyes and feeling something warm and wet splatter across his face.
“You were nowhere near being subtle. In fact, I daresay you’ve gotten worse since school,” Draco says and grins when he sees the tips of Potter’s ears go pink.
“Circe, Harry, of course. Who do you take me for? The last thing I want is my family to hear us,” he says as he finishes the last of the charms and drops his wand on the vanity table. He reaches for Harry’s trousers and starts undoing the buttons. He barely gets the zipper down when he slides his hands down Harry’s pants and touches his cock, already hard and wanting. Harry hisses when he feels Draco’s fingers close around his cock to give a lazy stroke from tip to bollocks.
“Dead. Laid him to rest in the South. Death Eaters murdered him. We just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. I found the same scouting party a few months later, led by a woman in black. I couldn’t kill her, but I blinded her in one eye.”
A cough. Followed by a weak gasp.
Blaise moves about opening the wine bottle while Draco leans against the counter and looks at the spread across the kitchen island. Just about every possible hors d'oeuvre and pastry sits perfectly in trays and tier stands.
“Yes, I’m-I’m close,” Harry gasps as he cards his fingers through Draco’s hair. Draco wants this to last, but he knows he's close too, has been nearing the edge with each snap of his hips.
“Still hurts like hell,” she admits.
Harry gets some leverage as he plants his feet flat against the bed, pulls Draco up and fucks into him hard and steady. Draco sobs and falls forward. He rests a hand against the bed, next to Harry’s head.
“I have more bedding in a linen closet. I dare say it’s not incredible, but only a fool would say they've had a bad night’s sleep on my transfigured beds. Do make yourself at home,” He looks so satisfied with his work and smiles when Potter laughs.
Draco’s other hand—pale and thin but so beautiful—covers his and Harry stills. He looks up and Draco’s looking at him and he’s saying something.
His profound appreciation for muggle art and art, in general, became a renewed curiosity after the war when he moved to Florence. He stands in front of portrait paintings that take him back to the days when he first walked these halls. He walks into a new room, a part of a new site-specific creation. Every surface and corner of the gallery room is covered in a brilliant and deep cobalt blue. The centerpiece in this room is a large portrait of a Black woman. Gold, blue, and black are the dominant hues along the painting.
“It could be with him,” she answers. “I see the way you two look at each other every time you’re in the same room, it’s rather sickening and lovely. But then I want to knock both of your heads against a brick wall because you’re both so thickheaded. Honestly, you men.”
He gets up, stumbles just a little, and glares at the lot of them when they cheer him on. He goes about setting new glasses on a tray, hands going on autopilot. He decides to make something with gin.
“Bolt cutters,” the blood bag says then, and with a flick of the wrist he’s pointing the gun towards Padma. With his other hand he lifts the chain that’s connected to the back of his muzzle.
“Fuck, fuck,” Draco gasps, and Harry fucking preens. He feels like he could choke at any second but then Draco is pulling him up and Harry relaxes, opens his throat and just lets himself be used.
He catches Potter’s gaze lingering on his own scars, too. The harsh and jagged lines across his chest his loving aunt put there.
“Well,” Potter sighs and runs a hand through his hair. “I left the Auror’s last spring.”
“Anything I can do to help?”
He wraps the throw blanket around himself and opens the window to let the owl in. He takes the envelope tied to their foot and reaches for the bowl of treats he keeps by the window. The owl chirps as they eat and Draco settles back in front of the fireplace. He turns over the envelope addressed to him and he smiles when he recognizes the scrawny print.
“I made a deal for safe passage through the Canyons. Though I’m supposed to be alone. That was the deal.”
* * *
“How is this possible?” Potter asks.
“The savior of the world can't stop himself from helping said world,” Draco teases. He brings a chocolate-covered strawberry to his mouth and takes a bite. Potter watches him, eyes dropping to Draco’s mouth.
“I’m known to be a lot of fun,” Draco then says and preens when Potter looks away, flushed.
“I don’t like him already,” Fleur says.
“You remembered?” Draco asks, stopping short of taking a bite out of a tart.
He hears shuffling and he can tell Potter has sat next to him. They stay there in comfortable silence. Draco doesn’t know why exactly Potter is here, but he appreciates the gesture all the same.
“We’re the only ones left,” Hermione says.
“Harsh,” Draco agrees. “But not entirely false.”
He meets Potter at the door right as he moves to walk in and they both startle each other. He’s wearing a dark peacoat with a thick wool scarf wrapped around his neck. It’s freezing out, a bitter wind pierces through and Draco hugs his sweater close.
Blaise looks older too, their eyes sharp and watching Draco with familiarity. He pulls away from Hermione and walks towards Blaise, reaches forward and cards his fingers through theirs. When he blinks, he feels tears fall down his cheek. “I never thought I’d see any of you again. But I had hoped.”
what Potter means. “Point taken. And thank you.”
The Riders put up a good fight, chasing after them to collect the cost, trying to steer them off road. It’s here where Draco really finds out what it’s like to have a co-pilot, someone who is on the same wavelength as him, someone who just
Several hours later once he’s in his room, the alarm sounds.
What had started out as a blind date with hushed voices over dinner, had turned into long evenings of drinking and conversations. Draco had heard all about it because Blaise couldn’t keep it to himself, promising to Floo Draco the moment he got home. He had never seen Blaise so happy before. The wedding is taking place at the Zabini estate, which Draco had only been to a few times to celebrate some New Years when they were still in school.
“I’m serious!” Potter says, laughing when Draco narrows his eyes. “It’s fantastic. What you do, I mean. Andromeda sometimes brings in a copy of your column whenever she comes over for tea. Though she doesn’t know that by then I’ve already read it. She’s been helping with translating.”
The letter arrives on a Sunday morning. Draco is sitting in front of the fireplace and he’s got two notebooks out and an array of papers. He may be in a bit of a frenzy. There’s a light peck at the window then and he looks up, confused at seeing an owl he doesn’t recognize.
Draco smirks because he knows
At the end of the hall, Draco spots a corner that has a giant pile of candy wrapped in different colors of cellophane.
“I resigned this morning,” he says, folding the newspaper on his lap. “I’m moving back to England. And before you say anything, I’ve been wanting to do this for a while. Now that the Biennale has opened, I can move on and I won’t have any regrets. I do love writing and I can do that from anywhere. I want us to be together. For real this time. I can still keep my house here and we can visit whenever we want but,” he says, hopeful and so afraid at the same time. “I want to come back. To you.”
“Move, Draco,” Harry says and he doesn’t have to be told twice. He settles his hands on either side of Harry’s head and starts rolling his hips, biting his lip with each thrust. It feels amazing, it’s perfect. The heat around his cock is almost unbearable. Harry’s hands are on his arse, kneading and pulling him as if to get his cock in deeper.
It’s not that this holiday is weird, it’s that because it’s going so well that Draco finds it weird. Potter tries to help in any way that he can and Draco is used to that because that’s who Potter is. That’s what scares Draco the most. The fact that having Potter back here suddenly feels right and not strange at all.
“We’ve started doing scouts this far out,” she explains, “sometimes Death Eaters make patrols and we’ve had no choice but to assume anyone that isn’t us wants us dead. When we saw the Rig in the distance, we didn’t know what to expect.”
Draco grins because Potter has settled on looking at something over his shoulder as if it’s the most interesting thing. Potter is bold most of the time, knowing that he’s nervous now trying to ask Draco out is, well. Some things never change. Despite everything they’ve been through, somehow they still find ways to amuse one another like they’re meeting for the first time again.
“Ah, yes, me,” Draco says dryly, rolling his eyes. “Clearly you had no plan. I saved your life that day. They would have bled you dry. I don’t blame you,” he then adds quietly. “For wanting to kill my aunt.”
He watches Draco and doesn’t say anything. Draco sighs and reaches for the door handle, not caring that he’s now got the gun pointed to his head. “We can either wait here or go through the Canyons with a head start. You know we won’t survive if we stay here. He’ll kill us both.”
“One fuel pod of guzzoline just like you asked!” he shouts. His voice echoes along the Canyon. Silence. Blood rushes through his ears, his heart slamming against his ribs with nervousness.
“Just a nudge,” he says and he’s right. That burst of guzzoline is enough to give the Rig a significant speed boost, just enough to avoid getting their tires spiked.
Harry shakes his head.
Then, Draco's mind betrays him and he's reminded of mornings in Florence, of the feeling of waking up with Potter in his arms. He remembers the feel of Potter’s hands in his hair while they sat out in the fields with Florence on the horizon. He's reminded of how beautiful Potter looked sitting at the windowsill of his bedroom. He's reminded of how the morning sunlight shined off him so beautifully, a view of the Arno behind him.
He knows that if there’s anyone who can understand how he feels, it’s Draco.
“Here you can decorate all you want,” Teddy tells Potter. “Right, Draco?”
Draco climbs on the bed, crawls over to Harry, and gives himself a moment to have this. He trails his eyes over Harry. He’s put on some muscle since the last time they were together and it shows on his arms and legs and it does
He’s watching Harry, the way he furrows his brow and his mouth hangs open in a silent moan. He leans down, kisses Harry’s nose. “You okay?”
Many late nights were spent in this kitchen. It had become a safe space to talk about what they would do with their lives after the war ended. Blaise had been the one to encourage Draco to leave England. His mother and Pansy had asked him to reconsider, but they knew that they need only ask once before realizing that Draco had made up his mind.
They don’t talk about the last time Potter was here, though. A part of Draco wonders if it’s because it’s in the past and thus not worth bringing up. Potter has given him no sign, and they might have slept together but it was only once and nothing came of it. So far things haven’t crashed and burned. So Draco keeps his thoughts to himself and keeps those memories close to his heart.
At that, Draco remembers. He had stayed with Pans to help clean up. The two of them managed to find a way to stay for another two hours just sitting in the living room, trying to sober up.
At that moment, some of their friends walk into the kitchen, keen on eating the rest of the treats. Potter gets up from the table and Draco misses him already.
“How I managed any of it without you is beyond me,” Harry admits.
It’s a lovely Sunday morning with Florence on the horizon and Draco looks at it with a longing in his heart. So much has happened here. They’ve decided to have a picnic last minute to join Teddy to watch him play while Aunt Andromeda and his mother head into town to do some shopping.
When the sun comes up he trades places with Potter again. After a few hours of silence, he hears muttering and sees Potter twitch in his sleep. He wakes, violently shaking, his fist raised as if ready to defend himself. A nightmare. Draco knows the signs all too well. He doesn’t move. He keeps still and waits until Potter’s eyes land on him and he recognizes what he sees, waits until Potter knows that he is safe.
Draco nods, solemnly because he knows what exactly Potter is referring to. He doesn’t know the exact details but it wasn’t a secret either, the neglect and abuse Potter experienced as a child.
Poppy stands at their side, her grey hair trimmed short. “From where did you come?”
His knees burn, the hot sand bleeding through his pants, but it’s all that keeps him grounded as he cries and
When Padma has him distracted, Draco takes his chance. He tackles the blood bag to the sand. They wrestle for the gun and eventually Draco wins again. He moves the barrel of the gun so that it’s directly under the blood bag’s chin. He doesn’t hesitate—pulls the trigger and it misfires with a pathetic sizzle. Draco frowns, confused before meeting the blood bag’s and he’s smiling at Draco. The next thing he feels is pain in his jaw and he’s on his back, eyes blinking back the scorching sun, his own hands reaching to grab onto anything.
“So,” Blaise begins then, sitting on the arm of the sofa, “meet anyone worthwhile yet?”
“Not on purpose,” Potter says also at the same time.
“If I’m reading into this wrong then tell me. Please, I just have to know.”
even if half of it wont make sense. He’s free because of Draco and they’ve made it this far together.
He wonders if Potter remembers these moments as much as he does. He allows himself to have this one thing if only for a night. Come tomorrow, things will go back to the way they’ve been.
It takes a while for the memory to joggle something in him, and when it finally clicks, he looks up at Potter, stunned. “That was you? The ambush attack on the Death Eaters in the hills past the Bullet Farm, that was you?”
“Wow,” Draco says after he swallows. “What is this?”
“We agreed,” Padma tells him again, eyes hard on him as she puts her hand over his.
smiles for what seems like the first time in ages.
Later before they settle in for the night, he finds Potter again. He doesn’t plead, doesn’t think it’ll work that way, but finds himself wanting to nonetheless.
Instead, Draco turns to leave but not before looking back one last time. The blood bag is now laying on his stomach, his shirt pulled up revealing his back. He’s still looking at Draco.
“My mother was born there. She was stolen and given as a gift to Lucius,” Draco looks down at his hands, scrubbed clean from dirt, grease and blood.
“We go back the same way we came,” Potter continues, “Through the Canyon. We can decouple the tanker at the Pass and close it off behind us.”
Startled, he almost drops the knife he’s using and whirls around. “Circe, Potter, don’t blame me if you get yourself stabbed next time you sneak up on someone holding a knife.”
Draco walks back to the Rig and finds Potter already on the opposite side, reaching for the engine plates on the hood. They work together in silence. They dig through the mud with cold hands and dig in the steel plates next to the wheels. Pansy climbs inside the Rig and starts revving the engine, pressing on the gas. After a few tries and pushing, the Rig rides on the plates and pulls itself out of the mud.
“Not with your cock,” Harry says, his hands on Draco’s chest, wanting to touch everywhere. “God... forgot how good this feels. How you feel. ‘M not gonna last.”
“You haven’t been back since we got it done, haven’t you?” Blaise says, watching him.
“Heads up!” Ace eventually yells to the others on top of the Rig. “This is not a supply run!”
Draco averts his gaze and walks away.
Harry leans back on the bed and lets out a soft sigh. His hips start to rock down on Draco’s fingers shamelessly, trying to get more. He fucks Harry like this for a while, so sweetly and without rush. He crooks his fingers and rubs trying to look for that sweet spot. He watches the way Harry’s cock leaks precome at the tip, lazily leaving a trail on his happy trail. He leans down over Harry’s neck and kisses him there, on his collarbone. He loves the bittersweet taste of his sweat mixed in with soap. He continues laying kisses down Harry’s chest, moving to mouth at one nipple, softly biting it the same time he twists his fingers.
He means to stand but freezes when he feels something sharp and cold against his throat. He can’t turn around. He sees Potter, sees that his eyes are hard and focused on something behind him. Potter slowly starts to raise his hands in the air.
Harry arches off the bed and moves to rest his hands flat against the headboard. He spreads his legs wide as Draco leans up and starts fucking him, hard and fast.
“I thought you weren’t arriving until tomorrow!” she says, pulling back after kissing him on each cheek. Draco’s very aware that Potter is watching them but he doesn’t dare look at him, couldn’t bring himself to.
By the time they go through two bottles of firewhiskey, Draco is perfectly content to melt into the couch. He feels a lightness to himself and giddy. One of the house cats, Phoebe, has climbed into his lap and lightly nips his fingers for pets. Pansy sits next to him and Potter sits on the floor between her legs. She lazily runs a hand through Potter’s hair all the while having a perfectly normal conversation with Ron about Ministry work.
He stands and sees Bellatrix on the floor, cackling as she pulls the knife out from her chest, blood pooling and soaking her robes.
"Perfect," Draco then murmurs. "You can take some more, can't you?"
“Draco,” Potter says softly, “I have wanted you in any way that I could. In every single way, you could offer.”
Ginny pulls back and then hugs Potter, giving him a kiss on each cheek as well.
“I want to... I need, please,” Harry breathes out, “Please.”
Potter beams. “Lead the way.”
It’s the blood bag from last night.
“Not bad,” he breathes out harshly, feeling sand between his teeth when he bites down a groan. “For a blood bag.”
“Go to him. I’ve got this,” Hermione says.
“Don’t tell me that I’m wrong?”
Draco feels laid threadbare. He feels his chest tighten at also learning that his aunt also reads his work. It's not that he is afraid of this fact, it's that he wants to know more. If there is a single thing that Draco takes pride in, it's his writing. And he feels hopeful that he can share this with his family and those closest to him. Being nominated as a curator for the upcoming Wizarding Biennale was a bonus.
Draco makes his way to the kitchen to catch up with Blaise. The first thing he notices is the extended space next to the kitchen. A conservatory expansion was rebuilt to form an open dining room and sitting area. The last time Draco had been here, there had been floor plans and prints laying across a small rugged dining table. The idea of extending the kitchen had been Ginny’s and was a mere idea then. Now it has become a reality.
Draco drops a sugar cube into his tea and gently stirs his spoon. Mindful of the lapful of Harry, he takes a drink and sets the cup to his right. He eyes the rest of the picnic spread on the blanket with a sense of satisfaction. There’s a slight breeze and he moves his hand to his hat, careful to not let it get blown away in the air. The sun hangs high in the air, beaming down on them.
“Let me,” Draco softly says. He takes it and reloads the clip with finesse.
“You know me, Blaise, I am after all very hard to please and hard to keep.”
“It’s worth remembering,” Potter says, so close and watching Draco. “I haven’t forgotten,” he continues, voice low. “I left a part of myself here, with you.”
The ongoing exhibition celebrates the work of contemporary and conceptual artists. One art piece spans most of the wall space in one room. It features panels of black cutout silhouetted figures across a vast white canvas. In adjourned rooms, small to medium framed drawings hang on the wall in a tight intricate space. They draw a crowd of visitors who take turns to stand in front of the paintings to be able to read and see the details.
Draco rolls his eyes and pulls Potter inside, “Good grief, come inside already.”
The silence after grows thick and heavy and Draco feels a deep pit of despair twist in his heart.
“Sleep,” Draco murmurs, voice tickling the nape of his neck and Harry shivers. “Stop thinking so much. Unless you want me to help you take your mind off things for a while.”
They settle into a comfortable silence as they eat. Draco offers the platter of the frost-covered cakes while Potter pushes forward the bowl of fruits.
“We’re not going back,” Pansy says, arms stretched out in front of the Wives. She stands in front of them, unafraid. Draco has always admired that about Pansy.
“How do you know this ‘Green Place’ even exists?” Potter asks him after a while.
“Come on,” Hermione whispers to Draco, crying. “Stay with us.”
“This could change everything,” Potter says as he eyes his hand.
“It’s got everything you need. As long as you’re not afraid of heights,” Luna says, eyes bright behind Fleur.
This, Draco, briefly thinks, is what he’s been missing out on. This is what he’s wanted for months, years, perhaps all along. He runs a hand through Harry’s hair and his heart bursts at how familiar this all feels. He idly remembers how Harry had felt under him, what he tasted like. It feels like no time has passed at all. Draco can’t stop kissing Harry back. Suddenly, Harry breaks the kiss to softly mouth at Draco’s jaw, his neck, the base of his throat, teeth softly grazing his skin before sucking.
“Yeah,” Harry says, trying to relax, trying to hide the fact that he’s blushing, “It’s just been a while.”
“He wants us to go back from where we came,” Pansy says. She eyes Potter, curiously. “I thought you weren’t insane anymore?”
“This isn’t a secret,” Potter states. Draco shakes his head.
Instead, he takes Harry’s hand and leads them out of the kitchen and up the stairs. It’s late and his blood is thrumming alive in his ears because Harry is holding onto his hand, tight and so sure. When they reach his bedroom, Draco shoves Harry against the door. He remembers to lock the door.
“What about your knee?” Harry says, lovingly running his hand across Draco’s knee, fingers touching the hard ridges of tissue.
Hermione drops the knife and Draco feels the whiplash of emotions and memories flood back to him of better days when they were younger. She looks older, of course she would, they are no longer children. The red markings around her eyes and cheekbones feel familiar and Draco thinks, tries to remember what they mean. Leader of Vuvalini, Guardian of the Many Mothers. There are hard lines around her eyes and her hair is wild, barely held together by a tie and loose braids, peppered with dust as it blows in the wind.
“Lay him down,” Hermione says and Harry lifts Draco, hating the way he protests, weak and barely conscious.
“Beautiful,” Harry whispers.
Potter nods, “I know. That was how I felt with Grimmauld Place.”
“My home isn’t here, Pans,” Draco says, voice soft. He turns and looks out into the night. They have this conversation every time. And every time it manages to bring Draco profound sadness to realize he’s missed more than he thought.
“Hey! Stay with me.”
Potter carries Teddy on his shoulders as he lets him put the star at the top and then they’re done. With the flick of his wand, the lights go on and Draco turns and finds Potter smiling at him.
“Whatever you want,” Draco says in a daze.
“You can touch me, you know,” Draco then says, drawing in a breath as he starts moving his hips. He’s intent on keeping his word: making Harry feel good. At a particularly hard roll of his hips, Harry arches back. He knows he should be watching, wants to watch the way Draco fucks himself so beautifully on his cock, the way his body quivers and shakes. Draco bites his lips and slides his hands down Harry’s chest. It’s almost enough to make Harry come but he can’t. Not yet. He feels his body strung high, his arms straining from where he’s clutching the sheets. He wants to savour this, every twitch of Draco’s hips, every moan Draco doesn’t hold in.
“Only when I’m cross because I can’t get what I want,” he says.
Fenrir and his pack. Werewolves who were once men but have now lost all of their humanity. Radiation poisoned their bodies and distorted their skin and bones. They only exist to hunt, and survive on the mere scraps of whatever they could find out in the Wasteland. This far East, far from the Citadel, anything is fair game. Draco turns his head just slightly and sees that Pansy is being circled by two werewolves. She’s biting her lip so hard that blood has started to drip down her chin. A drop falls at the same time the werewolf growls in front of her, snapping its teeth. He hears a choked cry. It’s Pansy. Something horrible twists inside Draco. Something a lot like fear.
Sharing food and eating with Harry had become second nature, something he cherished. Just the simple joy of sharing a meal. That was something that remained a constant between them throughout the years. He’s not the best cook and neither is Harry but they try their best to serve each other. There was something about sharing a new meal with someone that was so intimate.
Draco looks at Potter. “Redemption.”
He falls back inside and hands the rifle to Pansy who’s already there, waiting, “Reload the clip.”
“Not nearly enough to make life perfect.” Draco says and there’s a profound bitterness to his voice. To Lucius it was always about what they could do with the Wives, a means to exploit their power. It was never about what the Wives could possibly want.
“Most of everyone being Harry, darling.”
Draco isn’t sure how much of a head start he has before Lucius finds out his Wives are gone, but he keeps driving. There’s no turning back now. In the far distance he can see the Canyons. Not too long after, one of the war boys spots scouts from the Rockies.
In the next moment, there’s a blow so close to his head that he hears ringing and the deafened shout of his name. He doesn’t know, can’t recognize whose voice it is. All that he can focus on is the fact that there is now a limp carcass crushing him. He grunts, the weight of it pinning him hard and heavy. When his vision clears, he looks around and sees Potter on his back. Potter pushes a werewolf back with a kick just before teeth snap closed over the space where his throat was mere seconds before.
On the dance floor, Draco spots Blaise dancing with Molly Weasley. She laughs, full of life and love, as Blaise leads her across the floor with a smile, twirling her with finesse. He was always the more gifted dancer between himself and Pansy. Ginny watches them from her table, teary-eyed and so happy. She’s got her hand in Potter’s who sits next to her.
They spend the rest of the afternoon going from gallery to gallery. Draco points out the new works on display and Potter tries to keep up. He knows that these details aren’t for everyone. They walk past large sculptures in one room. They resemble home hallways and doors made out of colorful hand-sewn sheer polyester fabric.
To his left he sees Blaise on a motorcycle with Fleur. A lancer tries to throw a harpoon at Draco but Blaise is faster, their carbine rifle loud and precise. He watches as the driver stills, blood spilling from their head and the car swerves away.
“And you?”
The rest of the dinner goes without incident. Every so often his eyes meet Potter’s and he feels pinned. There’s warmth in those eyes and it reminds him of hot summer fields and heather purple sunsets.
Harry’s cock lies against his stomach, hard and red and,
“Will you be staying long after the wedding? We do miss you so.”
“I was trying to be subtle,” Potter says sheepishly as if remembering that day is rather embarrassing. Because it was then. “I don’t think I succeeded though.”
Distracted, he misses when the elbow slams into his side and loses his grip. He feels blood pool in his mouth as he’s punched and dragged across the hot sand. The need to protect, to keep the Wives safe keeps him going despite the agonizing pain he still feels in his leg.
Draco finds that he doesn’t want to lie to Potter. Somehow talking about it with him feels right, as if he would understand. A road warrior like himself. Running away from the Citadel and taking the Wives with him had felt just, as if he was righting a wrong. He’s done things he isn’t proud of. All done in Lucius’ name.
This is the only thing Harry has - his identity - the only thing he could call his own. This is his choice. He holds onto Draco as he waits for his own blood to flow through his veins. He waits for Draco to wake up again.
