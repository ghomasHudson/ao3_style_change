to help complete this life I have and make it ours. I’m not a frightened, depressed kid anymore. I’m a strong, independent man, and that’s better, because it means I can be a partner. I’m still far from perfect, I’m still impatient and particular and sulky and a whole host of other things. But if you want to try with me, I’m all in, Harry.”
Draco remembered the day he’d told the goblins where to stick their job, walked out the front doors of Gringotts, whipped around, and gave the building a proud two fingered salute. B.J. and Pansy had applauded and Draco gave them each a gracious bow in turn. He laughed, feeling lighter than he had in possibly his entire life. B.J. threw an arm around his shoulder and mussed his hair as Draco swatted at him and Pansy laughed.
Draco chuckled and turned his gaze back to Harry, who was now visibly fidgeting, one hand in his pocket, the other running through his hair.
“I was hungry, I’d been hearing great things about this place’s brunch so I thought I’d check it out. Trust me, if I had any idea you worked here I’d have eaten cold takeaway.” Harry started walking again.
. Not this time. Draco could reject him if he wanted, and that would be okay. It would gut him, but he’d know he had made his thoughts and intentions clear. He would at least have the satisfaction of knowing he’d done all he could. He took a steadying breath and prepared to turn around.
They'd hurt each other enough. They needed this wound to heal. No matter how much he wanted to, he’d never contact Draco Malfoy again.
Harry visibly bristled, but the other man didn’t seem to notice. “Goldstein,” he said with a curt nod.
People were chatting amiably and finishing their plates when it was decided it was time to get game night going. They did pub nights, they went out to clubs and in smaller groups to the cinema, but game night was everybody's favourite. It was always held the second Saturday of the month at 6 by standing invitation. Draco would make a wide array of incredible food, and depending on how many people came, they’d play cards or board games, or in the case of a turnout like tonight, a large group game. Patrick and Garrett were the most outspoken of the bunch and always had very strong, and somehow very opposite, ideas for what they should play. Sometimes Draco thought they just liked to argue so they could enjoy the victory when one of them won. There had been some very creative bets and challenges in the past to determine who got to decide. For the most part, nobody really cared; it was just fun watching them duke it out. Tonight, it seemed, it was an arm wrestle for either charades or Pictionary.
“Yep.” Draco said as he took another sip from his drink, consolidated the remaining appetizers onto one plate and cleared the unnecessary dishes.
Draco had said that he’d been depressed, hurt and afraid that he didn’t mean anything to Harry, but how could he have possibly thought that? If he was telling the truth, then what he’d done was wrong, but Harry certainly had no right to ask this of him. Strip himself bare and hand over his most vulnerable memories to someone that had hurt him? He should be allowed to bury them and let them go.
“Can’t just what?” He asked looking up, something feral and angry glinting in his eyes. “Walk into your territory and begin messing with your things?”
He looked as beautiful as ever, both hands in the pockets of his rich black trousers, and Merlin, he was wearing that green button-up...
Draco raised a cool eyebrow, even though inside his stomach was in knots. “Yes, that’s what I said, Potter. Did I stutter, or did something happen to your hearing during today's obstacle course? Did you not protect yourself when you saw the mandrakes?”
“Ah ah ah! NO!” she said as Draco opened his mouth to speak.  “You can whinge all you want Draco Malfoy, but I’ve been watching you self destruct for 7 fucking years. I have had it. I thought I’d give you time to figure it out. I thought that Harry would be able to help you. For a while, you seemed to be getting better even, but now you’ve gone and chucked it. So I don’t care what you do to fix it, but we are going to fix it. I will not answer my door in the middle of the night to find you bleeding and sobbing in the arms of a stranger ever again. You scared the crap out of me last night. Thank goodness you picked a good one to screw up with, because it could have been a lot worse, do you realize that? Anybody else might have left you there, you could have been injured far more severely than you were, and you were so out of it you could have been taken advantage of. The way you showed up last night, you didn’t even look like you cared much either way.” Her eyes hardened, “Well I do, and this is going to stop. Do I make myself clear?”
It's the night of Draco's birthday. Will Harry be there? How will Draco react? Can our boys get it together long enough to maybe make this work?
“Oh, hold still you baby, your hair looks ridiculous. Besides, it’s technically my face I’m touching so calm yourself.”
Harry followed and saw Narcissa Malfoy enter through the doors to what must be the main house of Malfoy Manor, just as Tilly deposited a full service on the table in front of him.
Narcissa suddenly looked more human than Harry had ever seen her, her shoulders relaxed, her expression softened, and the pretense she always wore around her like a cloak was suddenly gone. She took a sip and crossed her ankles.
This was enough. It had to be enough. They were toxic to each other. They had tried. They had failed. He wanted, but he couldn’t have him anymore…too much had happened.
People started to turn and pay attention as the woman continued to shout. “A likely story! I know what your father did! I know who you are! If only Harry Potter were here! He’d deal with the likes of you!”
They made their way down the street to a little restaurant they loved, called Hudson’s. It was the kind of place that felt trendy and comfortable all at once.Usually they sat outside on the quaint little patio, but as they approached, Draco said, “Inside please, my head hurts and the sun is killing me.”
“It wasn’t, actually.” Harry kissed him on the cheek and Draco looked relieved when Harry took a position next to him and began to give him some tips.
“Fuck yes!  That’s right Draco, tell me who this arse belongs to now.” He grunted and reached between them to grip Draco’s leaking cock.
Draco nodded, taking a moment to look Harry over. Gone were the days of ratty, oversized hand-me-downs and general unkemptness. This Harry looked stunning in denims that fit like they were made for him and an emerald green button-down that made his eyes practically glow. It was unbuttoned a bit at the top, the sleeves rolled up, showing off his tanned muscular forearms. His hair was still a bit wild, but with a windswept roguish charm that practically begged Draco to pin him up against the nearest surface and run his fingers through it.
“Can you cook at all? Nothing fancy, but we just lost a line cook. It’s mostly just chopping, stirring, sautéing, etc... pay’s decent, but the hours suck”
. He began to laugh maniacally as he collapsed to the ground. He could hear Neville consoling Harry in the distance. Oh god...Harry was crying...He’d never heard Harry cry before...What had he done?
It was Draco’s turn to fidget, but she continued, “He never really said much, I didn’t know why, but he was just different, content in a way he’d never had the luxury to be before. So, I’m sorry and you’re right; it isn’t my place, and I wouldn’t even ask if you’d seemed at all the way Ron and Neville seem to think you are. But you’re different too now, aren’t you?”
Laurie giggled as he pulled Harry into another sloppy kiss. “Alright, I can take a hint. Goodnight gorgeous, I’ll see you tomorrow.”
Draco couldn’t help it; B.J. was right. He was one lucky son of a bitch. He wished he wasn’t gay. He could marry her and be happy forever. But he knew she was hoping to marry for love one day and he would never get in the way of that. He smiled at her. “I’m sorry, Pans. I love you.”
“But how can I ever be good enough for him? I mean look at me. Look at my life. What do I even have to offer?”
Silence hung in the air, till Draco finally said, “She’s a good woman, she really loves you. You’re lucky.”
Draco had woken that morning wrapped in Harry’s arms, with one long tan leg thrown over his, fully enveloped in the other man like a cocoon. He didn’t remember Harry being like that before. They cuddled occasionally and they’d wake up close sometimes, but not like this. Draco looked back and thought that maybe it was him then too. He’d shift away once Harry fell asleep, afraid to become too accustomed to the presence of someone he thought he couldn’t keep in the bed beside him. But now when they slept they were always touching, always close, as if their time apart made them determined to hold on this time, constantly needing reassurance of the other’s presence.
Harry smiled back and took Draco’s hand. “Yeah, well, it’s just we never really do anything like this so I wanted it to be nice.”
“Look at you,” Draco winked. “It seems you aren’t a total heathen after all, and here I thought you weren’t paying attention.”
Draco deflated. He looked away and said simply, “I love him. I’m in love with him. I think I always will be.” He refused to meet her gaze. “Can I go now?”
“God, that had to have been the worst meal we’ve ever been served here,” Draco said as he flopped onto his cot. “Do you think they’re trying to test us? See who can survive the best on either food poisoning or starvation?”
“Fuck!” Draco gasped as a hand opened his flies, snaked its way into his trousers, and wrapped itself around his already hard cock.
a horrifying crapfest. Along the wall directly behind the host stand were stoves and cooktops at which a team of people rushed about scrambling, frying, chopping, mixing, and grilling. A flustered man he presumed to be the brunch chef, was flailing about this way and that, people were bumping into each other; it looked like utter chaos. The blond TV chef would be appalled but it felt like the perfect metaphor for his life. Pansy grabbed his hand and dragged him along as the waitress led them to their table.
There’s a whoosh and Draco steps through the Floo. “We caught him. Idiot got nabbed before he even made it down the street. I told you I could’ve-”
Several hours passed before Harry came back to him and collected him like he was picking up a child from daycare.
“Stop grinning to yourself like an idiot. People will begin to take you for a Hufflepuff, darling” Pansy said as she and Blaise entered.
Draco wanted to scream. He downed the rest of his drink and looked over at Potter and his friends. They were happy, carefree, and Harry, that bastard, didn’t even notice he was missing. Fuck it. If they thought he was a piece of shit who didn’t give a fuck about anybody, then he’d be one. At least he was good for something. Fuck Harry. So what if he might feel a little angry or upset if he found out. He could take any one of them home. Tonight, Draco was going to be a regular guy getting what he wanted from a handsome stranger.
“I’m enjoying an evening with my friends.” She smiled. “Harry looks like he could use a hand.” She chuckled.
They sat in silence for a moment, Harry still mesmerised  by Draco’s home, till Draco finally said, “This isn’t a trap is it? You aren’t going to call the aurors are you?” Draco smirked “Because B.J. will testify that you came here first.”
“I’m not moping Hermione!” Harry said to the tiny flame in the shape of Hermione sitting in the centre of a stylish lantern on his counter. It had been a rather clever invention of hers. She had noticed that with an overwhelming number of wizarding youths moving into urban flats that didn’t have fireplaces, there was a growing communication problem. This mobile lantern enabled Floo could be moved about the flat, and it was an especially convenient way for young wizards and witches to stay in touch with more traditional wizards, who couldn’t (or wouldn’t) adapt to muggle technology. Harry secretly thought the main reason she’d created it was to keep Molly from continuously popping up unannounced after she and Ron had gotten married, but Harry kept that notion to himself.
He Apparated to a safe point near the bowling alley and all but ran for the front doors. He was immediately struck by the murmurs of conversation throughout the building, the deep thrum of balls rolling down the lanes and the loud clatter of pins tumbling over. The place was crowded and his heart was pounding as he thrust himself deeper into the room, searching for that distinctive white-blond hair. Then he saw it, down near the end. He began to head towards it when he froze. Draco was sitting in some guy’s lap, one arm draped around his shoulder laughing as he leaned in to kiss him. He was too late.
Harry nods, “Merlin, for so long. I’m tired of waiting, so shut up and tell me what you want today,” He says, pushing Draco onto the bed and crawling on top of him, “schoolboy rivals or just had a fight after dinner?”
He felt like he was being X-rayed, but he refused to crumble. “Well, as pleasant as it is to have a nice coffee in the morning, may I ask why you wanted to have this little chat?”
“How did you even figure out where I live, let alone how to get through my wards?” Harry asked, desperately stomping down the flare of jealousy that surged through him at B.J.’s admission.
“Actually,” B.J. said as he took the seat beside Draco. “Your charming friend here is cleverer than you give her credit for. She and I had a long talk about you last night after we tucked you in. I think I can help, and I’d like to if you’ll let me.”
“Sorry, I’ve been a bit distracted, I’d really thought…” He shook his head. “Never mind. Let’s make this the best birthday you’ve ever had.” He lifted his glass. “To you.”
Draco felt a rush of emotion. As he looked into Harry’s hopeful green eyes, his breath caught and he stuttered, “I...I missed you too. I never got to apologise for what I did to you. I tried but back then you didn’t want...Look, there’s no excuse for what I did, and I hurt you so badly. I never meant to do that, I wasn’t thinking…or maybe I was...but I never meant to hurt you. I’m sorry.”
From the other side of the kitchen island, Patrick howled with laughter. “I told you you couldn’t sneak one past him!”
Harry had just moved in last week. They’d had a few squabbles over some of Harry’s tackier items. Harry had gotten frustrated and exclaimed, “What’s so awful about it?!”
Narcissa looked up at her son. “But maybe we could find a nice...boy...for you. If that’s what you want.”
Draco began to cry again and B.J. pulled him close. “Shh...it’s ok. We all do at some point in our lives.”
B.J. stepped out and Harry closed the door behind him. He could hardly believe it. He was being given a second chance. Maybe he could make this work, maybe they could do this.
It isn’t long before the bell rings and Harry answers to…not Avery. ‘Shit,’ he thinks, as the stranger walks into the flat like he owns the place.
They were standing close together, forehead to forehead, eyes closed and Draco whispered. “Are you sure Harry? I don’t want to do this if you aren’t sure. Please don’t do this to me and not mean it.”
“I wouldn’t be where I am now if it hadn’t, and I will never regret that. The man you knew was no kind of partner. Not really. You’d never have been happy with him long-term. But...” Draco swallowed. “But don’t think I didn’t love you.”
He would have been tempted to skip the shower, but he was covered in Phillips’ blood and sweaty from the day. He showered quickly but thoroughly, then hopped out and grabbed the outfit Hermione had picked for him: soft brown leather boots, fitted olive trousers, a white v-neck t-shirt and an unbuttoned, sapphire collared shirt with the sleeves rolled up. It was all a little tighter than anything he’d ever worn in his life and he felt a little on display, but Hermione had insisted that that was rather the point.
Draco’s mind began to wander. He thought, not for the first time, that he was unbelievably blessed to be surrounded by these vibrant, loving people. He’d never really had a family, not like this, not one he could just let his guard down around. Here, he could just be himself without having to worry that anything he said or did could later be used against him. As Pansy walked past him to take her turn, he reflected that he’d never thought he’d see
Draco looked up at him. He looked tired, resigned, nothing like the laughing Draco he’d heard through the door earlier. Harry was about to take back his request. He had no right. Then Draco finished his drink and silently took the Pensieve from Harry. He set it on the table, took a seat, leaning forward with his head in his hands. His hair fell down past his eyes as he took a soft breath. He stared thoughtfully into the empty basin, presumably selecting which memories to include.
“I couldn’t get you out of my head.” He unzipped Harry’s flies and kissed his way back down his neck and up to the other ear.
“Is that so?” B.J. raised an eyebrow. “Well to quote another classic, how ‘bout you and I get out of here? And by out of here I mean into that alley and see if we can keep each other entertained for a few?”
Goldstein looked disappointed but polite, “Oh? Well, that’s a shame but I should have known, gorgeous thing like you. We never seem to meet at the right time. Maybe someday, if that doesn’t work out. You’ll have to introduce me sometime.”
Harry shrugged and let out a nervous laugh. “I don’t really know actually. It just seemed like something to say.”
“No, but I couldn’t let her wait around all morning for you layabouts to turn up. You know she gets hangry now that she’s pregnant. Tell her to eat up, there’s lots of protein and iron in that. It’ll do her good.”
The night air hit Draco like a rush of freedom, his heart was pounding in his chest. He took a deep breath and suddenly arms captured him around the waist from behind and a wicked voice whispered in his ear, “Hey there, stranger.”
He closed his eyes, he could see it like it was yesterday -- Draco in the early mornings, his wide, gorgeous grey eyes just rousing from sleep, his soft smile, his perfect pale skin slightly flushed pink. He remembered how the sheets would rustle against his tall, slim body, the feel of his legs tangled in Harry’s as he nuzzled gently into Harry’s neck. He wanted that man in his arms again. He could no longer push aside just how badly he wanted --
Draco knew it was wrong of him and he was prepared to meet a very protective, very pissed off Granger. He ordered his coffee and wished he could make it Irish.
“Yeah, just let me wrap a few things up and make sure Lila’s got things covered, I can probably join you for a little bit. Where’s everyone else?”
Draco couldn’t believe he had him. He was back. He wanted this. He wanted them. For the first time since that night a year ago, he had a warm, moaning, pliant Harry Potter pressed against him. His fingers were running through that gorgeous raven hair, his hand was gripping that firm arse, and his lips were pulling those sounds out of the man he’d thought he’d lost. He pulled back and Harry’s lips blindly moved to follow him. Draco put up a finger to stop him as he leaned in to whisper, “Would you like to come back to my place?”
B.J. raised his eyebrows his tantrum, “I’m sorry, but I don’t pity you-- I don’t give a shit about you. But I
Harry felt rooted to the spot. He kept his eyes fixed on Draco, terrified that once he let him out of his sight, he’d disappear again. Harry couldn’t bear the thought of Draco being so close and slipping through his fingers again. He looked into Draco’s eyes and—
“Yeah, yeah,” Draco laughed as he shouted down the street after the last of the departing bunch. “See you at game night, idiots!” He turned back, laughter fading to a gentle smile as he approached Harry and cleared his throat. He reached out a hand. “Thanks for coming. It was really nice to see you again.”
At first he was disoriented by the flashing lights and the loud beat. He shook his head and tried to find Draco amidst the writhing bodies pressed all around, but as he searched, the first thing he saw was himself. He was laughing and dancing. God he looked hot; he looked positively like sex on legs. Is that the way he looked when he danced? It should be illegal. Then he remembered, he saw the world around him the way it appeared to Draco. He looked to his left and caught sight of the blond, drink halfway to his lips, suddenly frozen. He looked both aroused and frightened at the same time.
he said, so when he kept bringing you along we tried to be nice to you. But you just sat there. Stiff and cold as ice. Immovable, staring off into the distance.
“You dropped your beer and you went a bit funny for a second there,” Cy said, putting a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Are you okay?”
He tore off his trainee robes and threw on a navy coloured jumper. “Nothing fancy is it? Sorry, I didn’t have time to get ready properly.”
that you and I don’t have the best track record when it comes to making level-headed and solid decisions. I was simply correcting a mistake.”’
“Come inside me baby, make me yours.” Harry gave one final thrust as Draco bit his shoulder and clenched around his prick.
care about Draco. I’m not sure you even deserve him if you’re going to sit here and give up. But I’m here because that daft bastard is so in love with you that he can’t see straight, and as big of an arse I may seem to you, I just want my best mate to be happy. Draco is incredible. And make no mistake, if you don’t do something about your “feelings” someday soon someone is going to figure out how to make him forget all about you. And mark my words, when it happens I’m going to be right there cheering them on. So this is your shot, Potter. Take my advice or don’t. But if you do, you’d better be prepared to work at that relationship.
Harry was perfectly still. His eyes were locked on Draco, his jaw tight, expression cold and unreadable.
Harry hadn’t known what to expect from Draco’s friends. He’d seen photos, but it was nothing like being in the middle of this lively, playful family. He was beginning to get a glimpse of what it must have felt like for Draco all those times at the club, being the odd man out in the midst of a group already so bonded to each other. It was a bit overwhelming and exceptionally intimidating. Harry didn’t even have the added burden of history and baggage with this group. Well, that wasn’t entirely true. He felt the careful scrutiny of B.J., Pansy and Blaise everywhere he went. Their hackles were up and they were ready to pounce if he made a false move. Draco seemed to sense Harry’s discomfort however, and returned to his side, bringing along a jovial dark-haired man.
“You have GOT to be kidding me! You’re dating this piece of shit again? I’d heard you’d finally gotten some sense and chucked him!”
Harry stepped forward and kissed him. Draco’s lips were soft and warm and Harry felt giddy. He felt Draco’s hands run up from his hips to his chest, gently pushing him away slightly. Harry’s heart plummeted.
“Fuck, Draco. Christ, you’re so good, so tight, yeah fuck me back, that’s it baby, take it, take my cock…” Draco started to touch himself but B.J. slapped his hand away. He wrapped one arm around Draco’s chest, the other around his prick and whispered in his ear, “Uh-uh baby, that’s mine for now too, I’m afraid.” He began pumping Draco’s dick in time with each thrust into his hole. Draco keened at the exquisite feeling of being taken. And then he heard it.
He was supposed to be putting his emotions back in a box. But somehow his brain failed to tell that to his hands, as one reached up and into Harry’s hair and the other snaked down, to his arse, pulling their hips together and grinding against him. Harry made a low moan, deepening the kiss and squeezing Draco’s arse as he pushed his hard length against Draco’s. Draco’s brain finally caught up and sent off the warning signal, he pushed back, holding an arm out and separating them by at least 3 feet.
“Hey!” Cy shouted from his seat at the dining room table, “How come B.J. gets to be in the kitchen!”
when they invade my flat and I’m so indifferent to the game, I spend the afternoon making them food.”
“Hey, I may have just been on the pull, but I’m not such a bastard I’m gonna leave a crying, bleeding man alone in an alley with his cock out.” B.J. said “You might want to see to that by the way.”
Draco, looked away, biting his lip and willing his erection to go away. He needed to get himself back under control. “No, you shouldn’t have.”
Draco heard another thunk and several wet noises along with the rustling of fabric. There was a deep moan and... Dear Morgana, he'd rather suffer the Dementor’s kiss. He pulled his blankets over his head and prayed that they
He crawled on top of him, pressing their erections together as he licked from Harry’s collarbone to his ear in one long, slow swipe. Draco kissed and sucked on his earlobe as he snaked a hand down to Harry’s trousers, unbuckled the belt and pulled it through the loops, tossing it to the side.
“Besides, I’m not complaining. The food’s surprisingly good here and I never say no to an extra hour and a half at the bar.” He took a sip of his drink and winked. “It always makes the game more fun.”
The room went silent and somewhere distantly he heard the bright echoing tinkle of a beer bottle hitting the ground. Time slowed as the man turned around and the world narrowed to two emerald green eyes that found his and examined him sheepishly. He swallowed, unable to process what was happening. All he could see was that open face and that shy smile. Harry looked gorgeous, like something out of a magazine. He’d never seen him look so—
Draco had to hand it to the muggles. There was something deeply satisfying at the end of the day to just turn your brain off and watch other peoples’ lives fly past. He especially liked that blond man who shouted at people and called them morons for not being able to accomplish the basic task of chopping, measuring and heating ingredients to the proper temperature.
Then he saw it. Anthony Goldstein had clearly been hitting on him. Of course this stuck out in Draco’s mind.
“Because, for one, you’re dating fucking Laurie. Who is gorgeous, and not former Death Eater scum, which means that he’s better than me in at least two aspects, probably more. And second, because there is no possible way you could want this in the long term and I…”
He looked around. His flat was fine, functional...sofa here, telly there, a fridge full of cold takeaway. True he had jumpers, trainers, napkins, and abandoned glasses  strewn about the place but it’s not like there was anyone to impress.
Fuck no. He knew where he was and he didn’t want to see this. Draco was looking for a lighter and that arsehole showed up. This must be that day.  Harry could see it from the instant he walked outside. Draco took the light and smiled. He had to see how much this man wanted him, and he just stood there chatting away. Harry was fucking livid. He didn’t want to see the next part; he was about to pull out of the Pensieve, when Draco put out his cigarette and walked back inside.
Draco’s chest collided with Harry’s in a ‘wumph’ of air, and suddenly he was being deeply, and thoroughly kissed.
Cy turned away from the match, smirking. “Do you think we should tell them we could theoretically do both?”
“Another time Laurie.” Draco heard fumbling at the door handle, and suddenly light from the hallway flooded the room as Harry and Laurie spilled through the door disheveled and thoroughly debauched. “Fuck!”
The years had been kind to Lee. He was no longer the short, smirking, kid with a microphone, his face had refined itself till it was all sharp angles you could practically cut yourself on, not to mention he’d grown taller and broader. The bloke looked like a bloody supermodel. If he was honest with himself, he’d always liked Lee. Sure, he was a twat to the Slytherin team in his match commentary, but Draco had to admit he was always clever and quick on his feet, and he would have been bloody hilarious if the jokes weren’t at Draco’s expense. The things he could have done with him had he been in Slytherin. Harry could be happy with someone like Lee.
“Let him finish what? Okay fine, B.J., you’ve summed it up perfectly. My life sucks, I have nowhere to go and everybody hates me and apparently the only person that ever taught me what love was supposed to feel like was always going to leave anyway. But you think you can fix me? Great. I just don’t know where I can begin, honestly. What I need is a good defence, because I feel like the worlds biggest arsehole. I keep failing and failing and it feels like, just when I think I can’t fuck up any harder, I find a way. I frankly don’t see the point in any of this.”
Harry had gone to hell and back and somehow had come out the other end able to laugh. One afternoon they had been out flying together, there was a light drizzle, and when Harry attempted a Wronski Feint, he slid off his broom and into a mud puddle. Draco rushed over to help only to find Potter laughing. He had asked him then how he did it, how he could still laugh so easily.
Dave, and we took a vote. You’re mental,” Draco said. “Oh, and you better take whatever Fosters you don’t drink with you. Last time I had about 15 cans clogging up my fridge for weeks till it occurred Patrick to hand them out to the homeless.”
“Fuck in my own eyes. I need to be redeemed in the eyes of Harry Potter. He’s all I’ve ever known of love in this world. But you can’t help me do that, can you?”
Draco squawked as he nearly tumbled to the ground. “Some Prince Charming you turned out to be!” Draco laughed as he took the seat Cy had just vacated.
The room erupted in laughter just as Pansy opened the front door, “What’d I miss?” she said as the room cheered her arrival.
“Merlin, Potter, you are going to be the death of me,” Draco said running his fingers through Harry's hair and gripping his skull. “Nghhh...Stop it.”
“Merlin, Potter! What is taking you so long!” comes the real Draco’s irritated shout from the other side of the door. “I know you didn’t sick up. First, because I didn’t hear you, and second, because I am positive a taste delicious.”
He’d only done this maybe twice before. How was that possible? How had he not been compelled to wake up every morning and put his mouth on this cock He hummed as he wrung moans and desperate cries from Draco. He felt fingers firmly gripping his head and he shuddered.
They were back in Harry’s flat again. He looked over and saw the wreckage of tikki masala, butter chicken, samosas, and garlic naan on the coffee table. Draco snuggled against his chest as they watched Gordon Ramsay’s Hell’s Kitchen.
“True, but this way I can enjoy it knowing my grandmother isn’t rolling over in her grave with the copy of
Hey all!  Hope you liked it! A bit short this week ;) but it was a natural ending place for this segment. See you next Sunday!  Feel free to give me your thoughts! Or Not! Just grateful you are here. <3
“Hey, are you ok? I waved at you from the door and called to tell you the check was paid, but I guess you didn’t hear me.”
The day after that brunch a year ago, B.J. had set to work on what he called Draco’s “normal human education". First, they needed to go to Diagon to get a Muggle birth certificate, passport and other documentation. He had considered changing his legal Muggle name to Black in order to make him more difficult to find, but Pansy had quickly squashed that idea, saying that that was tantamount to hiding. This was about resurrecting Draco Malfoy in all his glory, not burying him.
“You know, the last time you two were together, you never did bother to come around and spend time with us.” She nodded her head to include Blaise as well. “But then again, we also never got a chance to really get to know each other after all our past shit. So, for Draco’s sake, let’s try this one more time. Hi, I’m Pansy, and this is my friend Blaise. Nice to meet you.”
“I don’t know what they’re complaining about, they’re just going to start inventing rules halfway through.” Pansy lifted her drink to her lips and watched amused as their banter continued.
“Yep. Okay, let’s get the rest of these people fed.” With that, Draco got back to work. He could feel his friends’ eyes on him. He looked up and saw that they obviously didn’t know if they should disturb him or not. He shook his head and gave a small smile. Cy arrived with their giant pile of bacon and Draco gave them a little salute and a wink before grabbing a new pan and beginning a fresh batch of bananas.
Draco seemed incapable of speech as he tried to impale himself deeper on Harry’s cock. He wrapped his arms around Harry and buried his face in his neck as he choked out, “Yes, baby, fuck I love your big cock. I want you.” He began sucking and kissing a spot at the junction of neck and shoulder, anchoring himself against Harry as he drove into him mercilessly.
This is a song fic based on Criminal by Fiona Apple. I'd like to thank my brilliant Alpha/Beta/friend
Harry gasped as he crawled on top of Draco. He looked into those trusting, soft grey eyes and stroked his cheek with the back of his knuckles. “God, you are so beautiful Draco.’
“If you’re satisfied, can you go now, please?” Draco asked quietly, never drawing his gaze away from the window.
am apparently supposed to put back together again. Even though you now have some insight into what Draco was going through back then, and how he’s grown and worked to improve himself as a result, you still can’t be arsed to put forth even a
Harry’s eyes hardened, his jaw tightened and he clenched his fists. He looked as if he was ready to snap. “Do you know what I thought at the club when I turned around and found you gone? I lost my fucking mind. I thought you must have been kidnapped. Everyone told me to just forget it, that you’d probably just gone home or wandered off. But all I could think was, no, not my Draco, not after tonight, not after that kiss, not after he finally gave himself to me. I blamed myself for making you go on a date in public, worried someone had retaliated and I had been selfish when it was my job to protect you. I had just gotten everything I wanted and I was terrified I’d find you dead or in hospital.” Harry’s eyes flashed and he spat. “Well, I wish I had, because it turns out I was right the first time. You are a cold, selfish, manipulative bastard, Draco Malfoy.”
Draco chuckled to himself as he added a candied strawberry to the top of each strawberry cheesecake cupcake, grabbed his drink and carried them into the living room. Everyone was gathered around a very frustrated looking Patrick, who was pointing wildly at what he’d drawn. In Cy’s defence it did appear to be the backside of a person and then a clock. Patrick was pointing to the clock’s arm and gesturing in a circular motion…maybe something about time?
It wasn’t his fault that Harry had walked into his restaurant. Sure, he knew he shouldn’t have pursued him, but in that moment he hardly knew what he was doing. He was so overwhelmed by emotion that his body had seemed to move on its own. Despite his desperate attempts to purge himself of all his feelings of want for the man, there still remained a single thread, a vine rooted in his heart constantly reaching and searching for the nourishment Draco denied it. But when he saw Harry, that vine latched onto him as if he were the sun, blossoming and growing, sending pulses of emotion directly to Draco’s very core. When Harry walked away, he took with him the light and that neglected bit of Draco’s soul pulled him as surely and swiftly as a fish on a line.
“Draco, this is all so unhealthy! No wonder your self-worth is down the shitter, there was literally only one bright spot in your life.”
“Yes sir.” B.J. winked and took the plate over to the table Hermione, Ron and Neville were seated at.
They stumbled upon landing and Draco took advantage of their lack of balance to push Harry backwards onto his bed. Harry looked up at him with glazed, wanting eyes.
In that moment Draco could see again the man from those days after the battle, the leader, the hero.
“Are you going to do better this time?” Harry was startled by Pansy who had just slithered up next to him.
“11:45 is hardly morning, Harry.” Draco smirked at him as he spooned some fruit and granola onto a cup of yogurt.
Hope you all enjoyed this weeks chapter! Chapter four will be up March 17th! Comments and Kudos welcome and adored! Thanks for reading!  Also bonus points to people who
And with that, she left the bedroom without a backward glance, cherry blossom dressing gown billowing behind her as she headed to the bathroom to get ready. When Pans was like this, it was best to just board the train. If you didn’t, you were either going to end up under it, or tied to the caboose and dragged down the tracks behind it. He sat up and was greeted by a knife-sharp pain in his skull. He felt like he really
“Oh, thank god,” Harry crushes their mouths together in a fierce, hungry kiss. Desperate hands grasping as they begin to explore every inch of each other.
“God, you’re thick. You're not even asking the right questions.” B.J. just rolled his eyes and sipped his tea. He walked past Harry into the living room, making himself comfortable on the sofa and placing his feet on the coffee table. “You don’t mind, do you?” he asked, eyeing the empty carton of chinese and the papers strewn about. “God, I can’t imagine Draco living in this shithole. No wonder he was miserable.”
Garret leapt up, sweeping his hair into a short ponytail. “I’ll be on Cy’s team, and if we win, I get to pick the game next 5 game nights.”
, order a pizza. and eat ice cream out of the tub in their pyjamas. Normally, the idea of eating crap and watching his favourite movie would be appealing, but today he just wanted to have a glass of wine and be alone. It was quiet in his flat. He realised how rarely he was ever in it alone. He usually had people over, or he was only there long enough to eat and grab a bite before heading off somewhere. He liked the peaceful calm that had settled in around him now, and while part of him wished it could be accompanied by the pad of bare feet coming down the hall to give him a kiss and welcome him home, he knew he had to shake that off.
Harry let go and pulled away as if Draco was a live wire and he’d been shocked. He put his hands in the air in a gesture of submission. “I’m off! I’m off! Waffles please!”
What a day, Draco thought as he shut the door to his flat behind him. Pans had wanted to come home with him, insisting they just put on
“Well, you're getting better at antidotes, and if they keep serving meals like that, Merlin knows you’ll need them.” Draco rolled over and looked at Harry. “So, whose turn is it to pick the card game for the night?”
Harry hated it when Draco smoked. Not only was it bad for him, but afterwards he tasted like an ashtray and his hair lost that soft citrusy scent he loved. He especially loved it when he was on top of the other man, his nose buried in Draco’s neck as he—Harry stopped that train of thought. He mustn't get ahead of himself. Draco still wasn’t his yet. For all he knew this was as far as he was going to get, and he needed to be okay with that.
“Thank you, Tilly,” Narcissa said warmly as the empty shell of Draco’s father stared at them blankly from across the table.
who was a great help when I was stressed and trying to get this ready for ya'll on time. And as always to the best beta and punctuation wrangler I know,
“Yeah, yeah ‘Mi. Got it. I’ll try and be around soon. I just haven’t really been in the mood, okay?”
Not anymore, he thought, remembering the smile on Draco’s face as he laughed at Hudson’s, how sparkling and alive he’d looked in the photos with his friends.
A grin spread across her face. “I knew you’d say that. That’s why I enlisted some help. Hey!” She waved at someone behind Draco. “You can come over now.” Draco turned around and saw a man he hadn’t noticed before sitting alone with his back to them. He stood up, grabbed his drink, and turned to walk over to their table. It was B.J.
and you have the balls to sit there, calm as you please, like you don’t see why I am upset you FUCKING ARSEHOLE!”
“After everything I did to keep him safe, he just TOLD you? He had no idea what you’d do or who you’d tell! That fucking idiot!”
Harry obediently lifted his hands in a gesture of submission. “I’m sorry, I got carried away. I shouldn’t have done that.”
Harry smiled, chest still heaving, softening prick still buried inside Draco. “I think I may have some idea.”
He liked this. Here in Potter’s flat he felt safe. It was more of a home than anywhere else had been in a long time. He didn’t know what he was going to do when the day inevitably came that he no longer had it to come home to. But for now, there was curry, and telly, and the scent of Potter’s stupid jumpers as he snuggled against him on the sofa.
“Harry, we’re talking in circles. I’m sorry. You will never know how much I regret what I did to you. The second I saw your face, I would have given anything to take it back. In some ways though, I’m glad it happened.”
“Hmm?” Draco sat with his back against the wall, knees drawn up, face buried in a training manual, and unstyled hair falling into his eyes as he read.
Harry’s voice grew quieter and he looked away, “And then, that night walking from the restaurant, you kissed me. And do you know what I thought?” Harry laughed mirthlessly and Draco’s heart ached, “I thought yes, there it is. There he is. I took him to dinner, and it was okay, and I was so nervous, but it was still perfect. And when you kissed me, it took my breath away. It was nothing like it had ever been before. You were bright, and bold and I felt like I was on fire. I had finally broken through. I thought, I have all of him now; he wants me, and he’s all mine. I looked you in the eye and you looked so desperate and beautiful, and I thought, finally, he’s all with me. I felt like I’d won the lottery. Little did I know that I should have been careful what I wished for.”
and he looked at me like I was deranged, explaining that he thought I knew. That YOU had put in a request to switch rooms last week, as well as a request for a NEW FUCKING PARTNER, and that you had been informed that it was approved TWO DAYS AGO! None of this, by the way, did you think was information you should discuss or share with
“I want you, Harry Potter.” Draco reached down and swiftly yanked trousers and pants to Harry’s knees in one quick tug, settling himself between Harry’s legs. He looked down at his stiff, leaking cock and back up into Harry’s eyes. He kissed the insides of Harry’s thighs, and licked the sensitive junction between leg and groin. Placing his hands on Harry’s knees, he spread his legs wider, exposing and opening Harry as he slowly nosed up his cock.
“Don’t you?” Draco laughed. “Honestly, this is so ridiculous. To think, I thought when I was accepted into the training academy, that I might actually be taken seriously, but NO apparently I still need looking after—”
Thank you all SO much for being here. I've been a reader/lurker in the fanfic community for 17 years and I NEVER thought I'd be able to write anything of my own. All your love and encouragement means the world to me. Also high five to anyone who spent their mornings playing MarioKart64. I ALWAYS play as toad, If I can't be toad, I don't play. I use his lightweight as an advantage in several places, but my brother always uses it to knock me around, because he's the worst.
This was all too much. He paced back and forth before finally deciding to sit on the couch. Draco had looked happy and content both times Harry had walked back into his life recently, and as soon as he had seen Harry, that happiness had been replaced with sadness, regret, and pain. It didn’t matter what Harry wanted anymore.
“How was lunch with your mum?” He turned around and saw himself with an arm wrapped posessively around Draco’s waist as they approached the building.
“Here, we’re throwing him a birthday party.” He shifted his weight to the side to reach into his back pocket. He handed him an invitation covered with brightly coloured bowling pins, a bowling ball, and a hand-sketched cartoon of Draco winking.
“No.” His voice cut with the sharp finality of a guillotine. “You lost the right to speak to me the moment I saw his hands on you. The
Harry stopped, looked him in the eye and said, “Because in the end we won, we are surrounded by love and we live in the world we fought for. If I crumbled, I would dishonour the people that died to get us here.”
And then Harry laughed and said, “Besides some things are just funny”. He flung some mud into Draco’s white blond hair and before he could even register his shock, Potter was back on his broom, flying towards the trees.
It had been 5 years since he was acquitted and people were no less angry at him now than they were the day he walked out of the Ministry a free man. After his trial, he’d had to adjust the Manor’s wards to refuse all incoming owls to stop the howlers. For most people, this would be an inconvenience, but since there was really nobody left that would want to send he and his mother mail anyway, it didn’t much matter. Now for the most part he tried to avoid all wizarding communities. This wasn’t foolproof given the amount of wizarding youth living in muggle London, but it was something.
Pansy held up her hand wiggling her fingers, “Oh, it’s bowling night, love. I trimmed my nails this morning.” Her fingernails were short but still a deep shimmery red. She reached under her seat and pulled out a cherry red bag that had the words ‘Ball Buster’ embroidered on the front and pulled out her ruby red glittered bowling ball. “Be warned, I don’t like to lose.” She turned, “Cy? Will your team be needing a Queen?”
Draco smiled, “Look, I was just about to grab a drink and then go back to my friends. Would you care to join me?”
B.J. appeared behind him as if from nowhere and leaned an arm on Harry’s shoulder, “Really? Do tell,” he said, wiggling his eyebrows conspiratorially.
She nuzzled against him. “I dunno, die probably.” She sighed. ”Just promise me you’ll get better. I don’t know who the bloke that’s been walking around in your clothes for the past 7 years is, but I want my Draco back. He was amazing.”
Harry looked up with bright eyes, amazed that this was happening. “No.” He shook his head earnestly. “I’ll be there.”
“Draco?” Harry’s voice was so sincere and concerned. Hearing his given name for the first time from those lips made one of the walls Draco had worked so hard to build between him and the world crumble.
B.J. didn’t know or care about his past, he just liked what he saw. Suddenly, blue eyes looked up and caught his and that smile was directed at him. Goldstein’s words echoed around and around in his head—
Inside...Harry...Stupid Harry who was too good for his own good. That beautiful man who thought that the world could change because he wanted it to. Who thought that he could wash Draco clean and that somehow he’d be worthy. He’d figure it out soon enough and then where would Draco be? Alone in his cold Manor. A prison of his entire life’s making. And when that day came, he wouldn’t even have the memory of this one person that wanted him like he was any other bloke standing outside a club. Who didn’t flinch at the name Malfoy. Besides, even if Harry knew, would he really even care? He might be a little upset, sure, but what was Draco in the end to him really, when he could pick anyone he wanted?
Harry looked up and rubbed the back of his neck with his hand and sighed. “I wanted to wish you a happy birthday. And I wanted to say I’m sorry about taking off like that the other day, I was a coward and I’m sorry. And I’m sorry about what happened between us...before. I didn’t know how you felt, and I wish I had, and I’m such an idiot for not seeing it or asking when I felt something was off and I…I just wanted to see you. I miss you Draco.”
Harry bolted up and quickly lubed himself up. He ran his prick up and down along Draco’s crack, gently pushing and teasing at Draco’s entrance. He looked down in awe at the wanton, writhing blond below him, begging for his cock.
“Earned what?“ He turned on the kettle, “I ought to charge you rent for the nights you spend kipped on my couch. Not to mention, these are
Harry nodded and headed off to find the loo. No sooner was he out of earshot than Goldstein rounded on Draco, poking a finger in his chest hard enough to bruise. “Now you listen to me, you murderous piece of shit.” Draco blanched. “I don’t know what your game is, or what you’re after chasing a man who is obviously too good for you. We all know you don’t give a fuck about anyone but yourself. Do you think I forgot what it was like living in the Room of Requirement like a refugee while you and your cronies swanned around the castle helping your twisted master? Because I don’t. Potter may buy your brainwashed, terrified, abused child act, but frankly the rest of us don’t give a shit if it’s true or not. You belong in Azkaban. Or better yet an empty fucking shell. I hear that’s how your mummy got old Lucius back. Nothing more than a blank, lifeless zombie she has to feed twice a day. Heard it broke dear ol’ mum’s heart and she hasn’t been seen or heard outside since. Harry’ll figure out what you are soon enough, once he’s had his fill of that pretty arse of yours. Glad you’re good for
Cy flinched. “Ughh how are you so chipper...it’s disgusting. Draco, will you please punch them? I would, but my head hurts.”
“Get your hand out of there Cy, or I will cut it off!” He whipped around and whapped him on the hand with a mixing spoon just as Cy was about to pick some bacon off of his bacon, truffle, and 5 cheese macaroni and cheese.
“You know, I think I can still make a betrothal for you with a lovely girl from the Greengrass family. Our name would benefit them and there are two sisters. We still have enough for a relatively decent dowry, we could get you and a wife started in great-grandmother’s estate in France—”
He walked to the bar, ordered a double scotch, and threw it back in one gulp. Then he ordered another and leaned back against the bar. Hell if he was going to go over there and feel like an outcast. He’d rather stay right here and just be an anonymous bloke at the bar.
He has spent at least an hour a day trying not to focus on this arse ever since Malfoy became the divisions Unspeakables liaison. Why now - as he’s about to face a dangerous criminal - is this arse his sole focus...
Anthony turned to Ron and Hermione. “What? And you’re just okay with this? You’re just going to let your best friend be taken in by this gold digging, opportunistic—!”
“Nah,” B.J. said as he leaned back in his chair and took a swig of his beer, “This is more fun, looks like Garrett’s gonna burst a blood vessel.”
“Besides, aren’t you supposed to meet Laurie soon? You’d better get cleaned up or she probably won’t let you take her to bed tonight.”
I hope you enjoyed this weeks chapter, as always, I'd love to hear your thoughts :)  but just you being here is more than enough.
Harry smiled warmly and held out his hand. Draco reached a shaky hand out and took it. Potter’s grip tightened and pulled him up. “Well, a nice walk will do you some good.”
“Thank you Harry, I really appreciate it. But I think it’s best that I study and train on my own, so that when I graduate training nobody thinks it was because I had the help of the ‘Golden Boy’.”
“No!” Draco had shouted. “You know what, fine! If this is your wagon wheel coffee table and it makes you happy, we can keep it. But I will not be writing my name in my books so we can figure out whose is whose in a break-up, because you aren’t ever allowed to move out!”
How could this be happening? He was only an hour and a half late. Draco didn’t even know he was coming, so he couldn’t be upset about that. Why had B.J. asked him here if Draco had his sights set on another bloke? Was he trying to punish Harry? Humiliate him? No. He’d seemed sincere. He’d said that Draco still loved him, still wanted him.
didn’t…” Harry shoved his hand into his hair, gripping the strands hard. He wanted so desperately to scream right now.
“Draco, stop.” A surprisingly strong hand grabbed his upper arm and twisted him around just outside the café.
“Ok, two,” B.J. smiled indulgently “But, from what I gathered during your barely coherent rambling last night, you lived in constant fear that all that was going to fall apart. Well I hate to tell you this, but it was. It always was.”
Then he looked down and realised he was still in his pants and a vest. At least they were boxer briefs, he thought.
“Oh Blaise! Don’t be a baby, we’re here to celebrate the grand occasion that is my birth, give it a shot. It’s fun.” Draco smiled.
“I think this lot have just about had it for the evening.” Harry turned and looked at Luna. “Is someone getting you home tonight?”
Alone with Harry were the only times he actually believed he was allowed to be happy. The rest of the world was certainly quick to remind him that the happiness won by the war didn’t belong to people like him. But they were right, weren’t they? And yet here he was, dragged along and sweating in the middle of a hot, overpacked muggle club with Harry’s friends. They of course knew and only the knowledge that they would never do anything to hurt Harry made him feel relatively safe when he was forced to accompany Harry on these outings.
“Yeah, good, okay. I’ll do that now. Can you do me a favour and fill a plate with bacon and send it out to them?”
“Yes, I’m sure who ever it is will be blinded by your beauty and run for the hills. Answer the fucking door. I have a headache.”
Fuck. Slowly he dragged himself up and put on his denims. He threw on his rumpled sweater and pushed up the sleeves. It wasn’t like
Harry gasped as Laurie broke the kiss. “Ok. Good,” he said, nervously running his fingers through his hair. “That’s good then.” Harry turned to Draco who had repositioned himself against the wall on his cot, knees up and face into his book. “I guess I’ll see you later Draco.”
“Not today. I’m sorry.” He added sugar, stirring vigorously with one hand as he grabbed and bit into a scone with the other.
“Yes, fucking B.J., the man with his arm around you in Diagon the day you quit? A few fucking weeks after…that night. Merlin, you didn’t waste any time did you? The man I saw doting on you at brunch? The man I caught you fucking? THAT B.J., your boyfriend, ring a bell? God I should have fucking known…” He paced away, nearly growling.
“Yes it does. Your face is doing it right now.” Potter raised an eyebrow and looked at him challengingly. “What did you really want to be?”
He turned and began wiping down his station and making sure everything was clean and stocked enough for him to take a quick break during the brief lull they were having.
“OH NO YOU DON’T!” Harry shouted as he grabbed a fleeing Draco’s wrist and spun him back in. “And here I was, thinking you were the smart one. When really you're an idiot.”
“How? I’m alone in the world, Pans. You’re all I have. I used to have him. Even his friends were forced to tolerate me, but now it’s all gone. It’s just you and me. Muggles are the only people that don’t despise me and I can’t even fit in with them! I mean, can you imagine?! I would be so lost in their world. So now I’m stuck here in the middle. And as much as I love you, that’s just not enough.”
It had been a bit awkward at first when Hermione and Ron had figured out exactly how Draco had met B.J., but as was her nature she swiftly put the issue to rest when she realised just what B.J. had done for Harry and Draco. Neville had been a bit harder to convince, particularly since the first time B.J. had shown up to meet them, Harry had neglected to prepare him as Draco had asked. Draco honestly couldn’t blame him after what he’d seen. But B.J. was B.J.; he was nearly impossible to hate and Neville eventually found himself rather fond of his no-nonsense charm. It didn’t hurt that B.J.’s sister Caroline had moved to the states to study Native American plant magic and that he put them in touch. From what Draco understood, they were slowly becoming rather smitten with each other, taking several international portkeys a month to visit one another.
Harry flinched, a flurry of emotions rolling in the pit of his stomach. He ran a hand through his hair – he wanted to say something, anything to Draco to let him know that he understood now.
“This is all your fault,” he said turning to Cy. “I swear to god, you’re the only person I’ve ever met that gets better at bowling the drunker he gets.”
Harry moaned and nodded eagerly. Draco took a quick look up and down the street, then Apparated them directly into his bedroom.
Amani and Dave began to clear the coffee table, while B.J. grabbed Blaise and got him to help pull some chairs into the main room.
Potter walked into their tiny shoebox of a room, rucksack slung over his shoulder, looking oddly sheepish. “So, I guess we’re meant to bunk together.”
“You think I had something to do with this?” Potter’s face turned red, green eyes flashing. “Merlin, Malfoy! Get over yourself! You aren’t the center of the bloody universe! I’m no more pleased about this than you are!”
This is a song fic based on Criminal by Fiona Apple. I'd like to thank my brilliant Alpha/Beta/friend
“Because it’s the only food I’ve ever tried to cook that fights back!” There was a hiss and a pop followed by a yelp from Draco as grease spat from the pan onto his hand. He was also cooking a pot of beans and slicing tomatoes as he stared at another pan that presumably was frying eggs.
“You have got to be fucking kidding me,” Neville said. His usually genial voice pitched low and deadly. “I told him. We all fucking told him to cut you loose. But he refused. Do you have any idea how worried he’s been looking for you? Practically tore the fucking place apart! He swore he needed to keep you safe. He was about to call the fucking Aurors, swore there was no way you’d leave without him voluntarily and that there were people out there that wanted to hurt you. Well I don’t know about then, but there are fucking now!”
It was a drowsy Thursday morning and B.J. was winning at Mario Kart.They were supposed to be adults, but here they were, yelling at each other because B.J. used Donkey Kong to shove Toad into the water while making a turn on the Royal Raceway and it had cost Draco the Star Cup.
Draco’s mouth went dry. He stared at the man and exhaled. He was fit, tall, slender but well-muscled. He had a stubbled chin that gave the air of a man who was carefree and didn’t make plans. His eyes were bright and his mouth was curved in a mischievous smile. He looked at Draco and he didn’t see the liar, the arrogant racist child he had been, the attempted murderer, the prison sentence he had narrowly avoided. He saw a cute 20-something blond with a nice arse. Something he could never be to those people inside.
“Oh darling.” Pansy placed her hand on his, her thumb rubbing gently caressing the back of his hand “We’re going to fix it. I promise, my love.”
else I wasn’t getting. There was more Draco in there I couldn’t reach, and I wanted to more than anything.”
Draco could hardly believe this was his life. He thought back to the man he was a year ago and he hardly recognised him; that man never would have imagined any of this was possible.
Harry lost it as his rhythm began to falter. “MINE!” He could feel Draco beginning to tip over the edge. “Come for me baby, come on my cock!” Draco stilled as his back arched and he shot pearly streams of come all over his chest.
“Oh please! I think you just peaked early. I hear that’s a problem of yours.” Cy stuck out his tongue.
“Great, just great. And this is the person you think I need to go to for guidance, Pansy?” Draco was starting to get frustrated now.
Tilly bowed low as two house-elves levitated Lucius Malfoy into the room and deposited him into the chair opposite Narcissa.
As he kissed Harry, Laurie opened his eyes and looked directly at Draco with an intense gaze that clearly said, ‘
“I love you too.” Harry smiled and smoothed Draco’s hair from his face. “I think I knew the day you smacked me with a pillow for snoring, and said you were not murdering me ‘as a kindness’, then gave me breakfast in a napkin since I overslept, then called me an idiot, then hit me in the face with my robes and told me that if I was late people would think you murdered me so I needed to show up for ‘proof of life’. You could have left, and gone to class, but that was you caring. And after years of smothering by Hermione and Molly, I liked the way you said I love you.“
When he looked over at Draco, his heart clenched. Draco was curled up on the sofa, his hair falling across his forehead, and legs pulled up to his chest. A tumbler of scotch is clenched in his right hand as he stared blankly out the window.
“Ah! Something we have in common! Good man. This one drives me nuts, do you have any idea how many times I’ve tried to explain the concept of off sides to him? I swear, I’ve left little napkins with diagrams in half the pubs in Britain and this one still just shrugs his shoulders and picks a team to support at random based on which one he thinks has the fittest blokes. It’s embarrassing to be seen with him! ”
Draco continues altering the color, cut and fit of his clothing ‘til it meets with his approval. Then, he reaches towards Harry’s face.
His arms were pinned above his head as B.J. began licking and sucking on the side of Draco’s neck. He heard himself moan as he heard B.J. murmur, “God I was hoping you’d be here tonight.” Teeth came up to nip his earlobe while one hand went down to cup at his crotch through his denims. “I’ve been thinking about you all week, you gorgeous bastard.”
. After the shite you’ve put each other through you both will. But if you don’t take this chance now, don’t you dare show your face ever again. Because next time, we won’t be having this nice little “chat”. I am getting too old for this shit. Do you understand me?”
“You’re getting better at that,” said Garrett as he and Amani walked in from the living room. “Have you been practising?”
So a few things for you folks that have been reading along. Can you spot the reference I've made for Draco's restaurant and the coffee shop down the street? Also, there have been lyrics from the song this fic was written about peppered in in each chapter. I hope you enjoyed them and that they weren't too obnoxious. ;) Join us next week for the resolution of some of this angst... All my love!
That night, as he crawled into bed next to Pansy, he reached out and pulled her close. He kissed her forehead and rested his chin on top of her head. “I’m sorry I’ve been such a shitty friend, and I’m sorry I scared you. What would I do without you, Pans?”
Draco unbuckled his own trousers as he began to work Harry’s shaft in earnest. He kicked off his shoes and stood, divesting himself of the rest of his clothing and stripping Harry from the waist down. “God, take off your shirt. I need to see all of you.”
“Tell me about it.” Draco exhaled, watching the white tendrils curl up toward the street lamp. He took another soothing lungful and closed his eyes.
Harry stood holding the Pensieve in outstretched arms, wondering what Draco would do. He knew it was unfair of him to ask. He should have walked away. This should all have been over a year ago, and yet it never seemed far from his mind.
Harry and Draco chuckled, and Draco gestured for him to join the party, “Go, sit, I need to wrap up here.”
“Draco, I broke up with Laurie. I only agreed to go out with him in the first place because I was spending so much time with you and I thought... well I thought there was no way you could ever feel for me what I was feeling for you. I mean Merlin Draco! Have you met you? You are so unbelievably intelligent, and clever, and so surprisingly funny.” Harry smiled nervously. “When I was assigned to be your bunkmate I thought it would be the worst hell imaginable, but it turned out it was easy. You are the only person besides Ron and Hermione and my immediate Weasley family to see me for me. You aren’t in awe of me. You’re just… you. And as it turns out, what you are is still very frequently an areshole. But I honestly don’t care, because I’ve found that you make my days brighter, you make me better at training, you keep me level when I’m being ridiculous. Draco, I thought you saw that.”
“If I knew where to start, maybe.” Draco looked thoughtful. “I don’t know, maybe not. It’s like potions in a way, but I’d be lost in that world.” He smiled. ”What would you do if you lived as a muggle?”
“No…” Harry looked a bit panicked and wouldn’t meet Draco’s eye. “I can’t because I won’t be here. I’m headed out for a bit.”
Harry laughed, “You’d better not be toying with me, Malfoy.” He whipped him down an alley, pulled him close and Apparated them home.
“Stop whining Potter! I thought you’d be happy having a room to yourself. Now you can do whatever you like in it without anyone in your way. Much more private. One good thing about Martin, he may be an imbecile but he doesn’t—”
Draco groaned, “Ahhh, I want you to make me come and I...hmmm…FUCK...I want you...want you to fuck me...make me feel good...make me forget…”
to know. All this time what had hurt was that he couldn’t believe that what he’d felt for Draco was a lie, that someone could create such a callously convincing mockery of open, easy vulnerability and safety, of tender, gentle, easy intimacy, of love and home. He couldn’t believe he’d been wrong all those months. But then, that night, it seemed one moment Draco was on him, passionate and wanting, and then Harry had turned his back for what felt like a second and then found him getting fucked by a stranger in an alley by a skip. He could never reconcile those two things with the same man, and if he’d been that wrong once, how could he ever trust his feelings and instincts again?
“You fucking bastard. I see the way that guy looks at you. He’s just as protective as I was. He loves you just like I did and you would just do this to him too. You piece of shit.”
Draco was an adult, and somehow he was spending his off mornings playing a 10 year old video game with his best friend.
at ease in a world like this either, but she thrived here. She was still catty and domineering, but here she was more open. As he looked at his year, he thought that despite its shit start, 27 had turned out to be one of the best years of his life. He couldn’t imagine needing anything else.
They continued down the street, slowly beginning to hear the chatter and the rumble of the club ahead. As they made their way inside, Harry immediately began to scan the room for his friends. The second he spotted them, he took off like a shot, leaving Draco alone, presumably to go and fetch them some drinks like an errand boy, Draco thought bitterly. He watched as Potter rushed into the throng and was immediately leapt upon by Lee Jordan. Literally leapt upon. Lee jumped at him, wrapped his arms and legs around Harry and squealed in excitement. Harry laughed good naturedly and set him down.
He worked his way up through the ranks and was now the sous chef at Hudson’s. He loved every minute of it. Not to mention once his talent had been recognised, he was put in charge of brunch. Every Saturday and Sunday morning, the kitchen was his. He ran a clean, organised, efficient service, and every week people flocked to Hudson’s for its tantalising, creative and exquisitely prepared specials. B.J. used to joke that he should go on one of those competitive cooking shows he was so obsessed with. It was funny at first, but now he was actually considering it. It could be fun, not to mention it played to Draco’s highly competitive nature.
“Yeah, I live just a few blocks away actually,” Harry said, looking a little flustered by the sudden whirlwind of attention.
Luckily, even after almost 8 months nobody had yet caught wind that Draco was in a relationship of sorts with Harry Potter. They weren’t exactly hiding it per se, just being highly discreet. After 5 years, most of the Pottermania had died down,partly due to the fact that Harry rarely did anything interesting these days. But if they caught wind that Harry Potter was seeing Draco Malfoy, he wondered if the world would ever get over it. He suspected there’d be lynch mobs forming in the street. Imagine, their precious Chosen One degrading himself by choosing to be with the likes of him.
“Want to play hearts?” Harry reached towards their shared nightstand. “I can grab the cards. It’s my turn to pick the game so—”
“I got a couple mates in from out of town for the next couple weeks. Should be here next week if you change your mind.” B.J. winked, took another drag and leaned back.
“Sorry I’m a little late, love,” the stranger says setting his bag down, rummaging through it and pulling out a vial. “Just be a tick.”
“Oh please, he says that now, but he’s never complaining when I use the time I save not watching the game to play likeable gay wingman and chat him up to the girls he points out
Draco stared, a little uncomfortable seeing B.J. in broad daylight at his favourite restaurant with his best friend the morning after they’d...well after he’d seen...It didn’t matter: there was no way this could work. “Well, that’s very nice of you,” he said, not quite able to meet B.J’s eyes. “But my life is really complicated and…”
“Ughhhhhhhhhh! You are Draco Malfoy, for god’s sake!” Pansy was exasperated. “First of all, have you seen you? You are stunningly gorgeous. When you are confident, people stop and stare when you walk down the street. You are ridiculously intelligent. You were the second smartest student in our year; you outstripped even the Ravenclaws on marks. You are hilarious and playful. I don’t think Potter appreciated it much at the time since all your jokes were aimed at him, but you used to have the common room in stitches. Draco, when we were young, before this war stole everything from you, all of Slytherin wanted to either be you or fuck you. I would give anything to have that Draco back.”
Draco had asked him to leave. That was it. Harry knew he was awful at expressing his emotions, and in the past, so was Draco. But talking to the man now, he could see how much Draco has changed-- how open he seemed. If Draco had wanted him back, if he had wanted things between them to be different -- he would have said something. Harry knows he’s doing the right thing. He respecting Draco’s wishes.
It will probably be a couple of months because I want to get the bulk of it done so I can release on a timely schedule :) Plus I am going to be writing a collab Drarry based on Indiana Jones. If any of that appeals to you subscribe and check it out :) Comments and Kudos are cherished and appreciated, but just your presence reading this is an honor in and of itself.
“Of course I do darling, he’s the gentleman you had sex with last night. I’ll give you this, you have good taste. He likes you, and he’s as worried about you as I am. He’s agreed to help us fix you.”
“What, for extra spell practice? I told you if you were going to set up that group that I would join you—”
Draco re-entered the club, rolling down his sleeves as he walked back towards the rest of the group. Harry was now occupied holding up what seemed to be a heavily intoxicated, rambling Parvati Patil and looking rather amused and sheepish. Great. Draco sank back down and stared at his drink. He tossed it back and wished just for a moment that he could belong here. Greg never went anywhere anymore, not since...he shook his head. Blaise was always flitting in and out of the country, not a care in the world. He still saw Pans regularly but two people in a club does not a party make.
He turned slowly and looked at her. He didn’t see malice or contempt, only honest concern. He resumed his seat and waited for her to continue.
A few hours and several drinks later Draco, Blaise, Pansy and B.J. were the only ones left. Pansy put on
He grabbed Draco by the collar and slammed him against the wall, his skull smacking against it with a loud crack.
What had he expected? Damnit. There was a reason he had shoved this all down and hidden it away. He had been so proud of himself, of his life, and now he felt waves of shame and self-hatred rolling over him and threatening to drag him back out to sea. No, he thought, he couldn’t go back there.  Fuck, he wanted a cigarette. Stupid Pansy had made both he and B.J. quit. He pushed himself off the wall and walked back toward Hudson’s. With each step, he tried to shove Harry back into that box in his soul he hid him in. With each step, he tried to re-amputate all of his longing to be loved by a partner, his yearning to have someone who would always be by his side, on his team. Well, he just didn’t and he wouldn’t. That’s all there was to it. Time to move forward. He opened the door and stepped into Hudson’s.
“We’re having a bit of an existential job crisis here, our little Draco needs work and he’s not sure where to start.”
Draco smiled looking back on it. Despite the challenges they’d faced, they kept working to make it last. It would, Draco was sure of it now. In fact, he already had the ring. He’d bought it months ago; all he needed was the right time to give it to Harry.
Draco curled away and began to sob in earnest, pulling himself into a tighter ball. He needed to stay down. Just stay here till everything went away.
been hit by a train. Then he remembered why, and he felt like letting someone actually do it. Merlin, what the fuck was he supposed to do now? He had thrown away the only thing he had left. What was the point anymore?
Draco whipped off his apron and rushed after him. Once outside, he saw Harry walking briskly toward what Draco knew was the nearest safe Apparition point. He didn’t even know what he was doing or what he expected to happen. He only knew that this man pulled at him like gravity and now that he’d seen him, he couldn’t just let him walk off.
, the best support system/Alpha/beta/friend ever. And as always to the best beta and punctuation wrangler I know, she makes my words shine
! So when Laurie made it clear that he was interested, I was so wound up and frustrated, I just wanted to get you out of my system and move on for the sake of our friendship. But then, even that went wrong,because you were pulling away from me. I felt like I lost you and I didn’t know why. It was killing me, and the more Laurie pushed and tried to be my boyfriend and get me into bed, the more wrong it felt and I just… I couldn’t anymore. So I broke up with him and I came to our room last night and you were gone. I thought you were just out training or something, you’d been avoiding me so I didn’t think anything of it. It wasn’t until this morning when you still weren’t there that I noticed your things were gone that I panicked.”
“I’ve been thinking about you.” Draco popped the button of his denims with one hand and slid the other into his pants, cupping the soft bare skin of Harry’s arse.
Hermione didn’t even bat an eyelash. “Don’t flatter yourself, you aren’t slick enough to be the devil. Just tell me the truth.”
Draco looked around his flat at the chaos and decided he didn’t remember when he had been happier. His world was exploding with life, color, laughter and mayhem.
“Harry! What the…” Then Neville rounded the corner. He quickly assessed the situation, and his eyes hardened, his face turning red. Draco no longer saw the easygoing, huggable botanist. Neville transformed before his eyes into the general that stood up to Voldemort in the final battle.
Merlin, he thought as he tuned her out. He peered into the bottom of a plain white mug. It only had a little brown tint from the dregs of this mornings (maybe yesterday’s?) tea. He blew in it to make sure there wasn’t any dust just in case and squinted. It looked okay so he put his teabag in the cup and waited for the water to boil.
B.J. smiled softly. “Draco’s my best mate. I’d do anything to make him happy. He thinks you’re it. Me? I’m a bit harder to convince.” He chuckled. “I just hope you feel the same.”
Harry could feel all of the tension melt from Draco, his whole body relaxed, only to be swiftly replaced with a surge of something entirely different.
“OH. MY. GOD.” Harry looked at him as if seeing him truly for the first time in weeks. “This is about Laurie. How did I not see it? I’m such an idiot. When you feel afraid you tuck your knees up on your bed.”
There was a loud clatter of pins from the next lane followed by an explosion of shouts from Patrick’s team.
“You what? I don’t really give a shit.” Harry whirled around, his eyes blazing, “And why should I? I don’t even fucking know you. I thought I knew you when you were a teenager: a spoiled, evil jackass who liked hurting people.” Harry spat, “I thought I knew you a year ago, a manipulated child who became a man and was a funny, surprisingly sensitive lover.” Harry ran a hand through his messy hair looking frustrated, “But even then, I knew I wasn’t getting the whole picture. I knew there was
“I know,” B.J. said with a nod. “He still loves you, the idiot. He loves you enough to relive those painful memories because he is still wracked with guilt about what he did to you and he thinks he owes you.  But then you just fuck off and leave without a word to him. Is that how you show love mate, because you suck at it. But now that you’ve spilled your guts to me, I have to ask again -- what’s the fucking plan here? Are you just going to disappear forever?”
I'd love to hear your thoughts if you'd like to share them. I hope you aren't too disappointed by the lack of an ending this week. Also, I think I should address that Draco made a mistake that was his own fault. He admits to that. Harry made some mistakes that hurt Draco. These boys were idiots in an unhealthy relationship. But I think maybe, just maybe there is something that can be salvaged if they can get their heads out of their own asses.
. But if he doesn’t, don’t worry, he has friends that care about him who will be more than happy to show him what you really are. You’re a criminal and you deserve to suffer for your sins.” Goldstein spat at Dracos feet, and with that he was gone.
I take full responsibility for that. He didn’t know I had a boyfriend, he was just on the pull, but he cleaned me up got us a cab and brought me to Pans. He could have left me half-naked and bleeding in the street. Oh! By the way I spent a couple months sleeping in her bed, I see her naked constantly! B.J. sleeps here a couple nights a week because we’re friends and we enjoy each others company. Intimacy between people you love doesn’t equate a sexual partnership, you judgemental prat. I’ve learned a lot about love in the past year. B.J. and Pansy loved me enough to notice how broken I was, how hurt and unhealthy and fucked up I was. It only took him one day to notice what you ignored for six months. I didn’t think you fucking cared. I thought I was a pretty toy to you.”
He heard frantic steps. Then green eyes and a shock of raven hair rounded the corner and froze. Harry looked like he’d been physically struck. He looked down to where B.J.’s cock disappeared inside Draco, and then trailed up to meet Draco’s eyes. For just a moment, Draco could see disbelief, horror, anger, betrayal, and anguish all warring in those green depths. Then Harry suddenly disappeared back around the corner. Draco could hear retching and Neville shouting, “Harry! Harry! Are you okay, mate?”
Draco pulled Harry up and their mouths melted together. He couldn’t believe this was his life, he had a career, a family, and soon a husband. He felt like he’d finally been redeemed for all his past sins, better than that,  he had all he’d ever need of love.
B.J. rolled his eyes. “It wasn’t that hard. Not too long ago Draco and I were stumbling to the tube from a pub near here-- Greg’s or Graham’s or something. Anyway, we got to this street and Draco suddenly became extremely quiet and sober, so I asked him what was wrong. From there, I just looked for your name on the bell. Even so, I’m sure Blaise knows who to bribe find your address. As to your wards, God, no wonder there’s so few of you compared to the Muggle population. You haven’t keyed your words to keep out Muggles, genius. After that, all I had to do was knock on the door and you let me in. For someone so concerned with security, you didn’t even check to see who was on the other side of the door before opening it.”
Draco handed him a glass as Dave made space for his beer and soda and prepared to make his signature shandy. If you could call Fosters and Sprite a shandy.
It was unbelievable how she could make him feel like the world’s biggest arsehole, and at the same time loved and precious.
This all looked different than he remembered it, Harry thought. Draco was lying down on the bed with his legs spread wide, and he saw himself crawling on top of him. He saw himself reaching for lube and asking if he could put himself inside. He saw Draco nodding yes. Once he was in and moving, he watched Draco’s legs wrap around Harry’s waist, his hand clutching his back, the other tangled in his hair and his face buried in Harry’s neck and he was whimpering as Harry took him. “Yes, please, please, take me, I want you, fuck I want you.”
“Yes well, thank you for stopping by. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to use the men’s room and then Draco and I have plans.”
He was on the pavement outside...was this Angelo’s? He saw himself and Draco waiting for a table. Draco looked sweet. A bit frightened, but pleased. He followed them to the table. He watched himself look like a lovestruck idiot. How could he look that goofy?
“Draco! I don’t hear you getting ready! Seven minutes, god damnit, or I'm going to come in there, Petrificus you, and dress you myself. You decide.”
“Potter! Table for two! Right this way please.” They were led to an intimate little table and handed their menus and a wine list.
Harry’s smile was infectious, and Draco almost started to feel better as he was led out of the restaurant, till he turned and saw Goldstein’s narrowed eyes following them. He mustn’t forget. He was trash. He had no right to this.
“...AND you certainly haven’t been tidying! Merlin Harry! It looks like a bomb went off in there! Look, I’m not trying to nag you, it’s just...”
Everything was still and silent as he looked into those cool blue eyes, and then the kettle began shrieking behind him
The sound must have alerted the rest of the world, because suddenly it all came rushing back into focus, Lila beside him stooping to pick up the pan, clearly alarmed by his sudden immobility. The disruption in the kitchen also caught the attention of his friends and B.J. stood to go to him, “Draco are you—”
He walked to the kitchen and uncorked a bottle of pinot noir. He poured himself a glass, grabbed the bottle and headed to the bathroom. He turned on the taps; the idea of a nice bath with his wine seemed like just the thing to help him shut down his mind so he could reboot the old Draco and soothe the aching need-monster within him back into dormancy.
Then he recalled Draco’s flat. How tidy it was, how much it looked like a home. Draco’s flat had photos of friends, area rugs, and that weird trophy thing in the corner. Draco had cords from his game console attached to his TV, he had coats his friends had forgotten slung on his coat hook, a fridge full of ingredients, and actual homemade food that
“Oh fuck!” Draco’s hands flew to his mouth. “I’m sorry, forget I said that, I should check on Lila—“
But had he spent too long feeling justified in his hatred towards Draco? Had he really ignored the pain and worry Draco carried on his shoulders for the length of their relationship? Harry fisted his fingers through hair and threw himself onto the nearest armchair.
Harry looked confused and dismayed. Then something shifted. He stood up a little taller, took a deep breath and said, “Right.”
Anthony turned, having obviously not noticed or cared who Harry’s companion was and his expression soured. “Malfoy.” He nodded curtly.
“Poor baby,” she said in a mocking tone as she gently patted his face, “Maybe next time don’t be a gigantic idiot and get the crap beaten out of you.”
B.J. burst out into laughter. “I told you the classics always work.” And then he kissed him. B.J.’s kiss was sinful and decadent, but there was still a hint of laughter bubbling up between them. He tasted of whiskey and cigarettes and he smelled of cotton and leather. He felt himself being slowly guided backward till they were in the alley, and Draco was pushed up against a wall.
“Aaaanyway...,” B.J. said, “What Pansy was trying to say is, Draco, you aren’t complete right now. You don’t have a life of your own to be proud of. You don’t love yourself. How is anybody supposed to be in relationship with half of a person? Yes, your partner is there for you when you stumble or feel broken. But Draco, you haven’t even been trying to be someone strong enough to be there for him as an equal partner. You need to cleanse yourself of all these lies that society has taught you to believe about yourself.”
“So,” B.J. said, “ I need you to take him out of the equation for a minute. Because to quote RuPaul ‘Honey, if you can’t love yourself, how in the hell you gonna love somebody else?’ Pansy and I have made a list.”
Harry rubbed the back of his neck. He could not believe the words that were about to come out of his mouth. “Can we...er...can we go shopping?”
“Oh good, Granger’s here. If we’re all going to that gala together, I need to discuss what she’s wearing, it wouldn’t do to clash. Ta, love.”
Pansy spoke to the waitress while Draco looked around at all the happy carefree people eating and laughing as if today
he said. We wanted to like you, Malfoy. We really did, because for a year we saw the smile Harry had slowly lost in the war come back to him. So we tried Malfoy. But you, are fucking DONE NOW.”
He lifted his drink in their direction, “Rock, paper, scissors for it. I don’t play favourites, boys!” He turned back to B.J.
“Shut up.” Draco pulled him down into a fiery kiss, wrapping his legs around Harry and pulling him as deep inside him as he could get. He wrapped one arm around his waist, pressing his body flush to Harry’s and cupped Harry’s face with his other hand. Draco kissed him deeply and passionately.
“Okay boys and girls. play nice or you can’t have any cupcakes,” Draco said as he set the plate down on the coffee table. Cy dove at them eagerly as Draco took the pen from him. “Now, how ‘bout I show you all how it’s done.”
“Harry, is that you? Last time I saw you was what...March? We have to stop running into each other like this.”
Draco nodded and B.J. pushed himself in slowly with a low groan. He put his hands on Draco’s hips and stilled when he bottomed out, breathing heavily into his ear.
And there it was. That dull stab he could never quite be rid of. Maybe he needed another drink. He looked over at the bar and was trying to decide if he should go himself, or play the birthday card and send someone, when he spotted the most delectible arse he’d seen in a long time. It was round, and firm, clad in tight green trousers. He’d not wanted anyone since Harry, not remotely, but that arse should be illegal. His eyes trailed up to a trim waist and muscled arms attached to broad shoulders. Merlin, if he wanted to, he’d bet that bloke could lift him up and fuck him against a wall. He snorted as he reached for Cy’s beer and took a sip,
