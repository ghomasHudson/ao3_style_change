“I do not!” Draco fairly yelled, before clamping down on his words, instead whispering so furiously it was nearly a hiss. “I do not talk about Potter all the time! What a thing to say!”
The mere thought brought a flush to his cheeks and he finally tore his gaze away from Harry’s. The motion seemed to bring Harry back to reality too and he carefully set Draco on his feet.
“What’s going on with you?” He demanded, thrusting the crumpled up letter into his satchel. “You’re acting very odd, like Potter and his friends when they’re up to something. Really, it’s a sign of how low standards have fallen at this school that none of the professors even seem to blink an eye at any of their antics. ‘Course, it’s all Potter’s fault, mincing about, charming the wands off everyone with his stupid scar. Everyone is falling over themselves to lick his boots just because he somehow managed not to die when he was a baby. Merlin, that’s a statement that can be applied to literally every other student at this school, but no! Not a single bad word against their precious Potter. He just has to bat his green eyes,” Draco’s insides swooped a bit at the thought of their brilliant emerald depths but he quickly pushed past the thought, not daring to linger any longer for fear that he would get carried down a train of thought that would only end in heartache. “And, and everyone comes running!” He finished lamely, stumbling over the words as he furiously tried to push any fantastical thoughts of Potter running to him far back where they couldn’t hurt him. He glanced over at Crabbe and Goyle, hoping they wouldn’t notice the faint blush staining his cheeks and if they did, that they would simply chalk it up to his passionate hatred of the Boy Who Lived and Drove Draco Mad With His Mussed Hair. Damn.
“What did you say, Ron?”
Draco was saying goodbye to the gorgeous guy, smiling at him, holding his hand. Draco said something, and the guy laughed loud enough for Harry to hear it clearly. Harry watched, his soul tying itself into twisted knots as he saw the guy lean in as if to kiss Draco.
“In your dreams.” Hermione scoffed, opening her textbook. Ron looked as though he wanted to say something else, but a stern look from McGonagall made him rethink it. They spent the rest of the class in silence.
“Oh, Merlin, finally!” Pansy groaned, flinging herself back against the common room couch. “So, when’s the wedding? I’m your maid of honour, right?”
“I might not be in love with Christoffer, but at least he likes me. And that is more than I can say for you. So stop. Just stop.” Draco finished, yanking his hand out of Harry’s.
“Malfoy?” He exclaimed, unable to believe his eyes. But sure enough, there was the Slytherin, scowling up at him, usually immaculate hair tossled from sleep and sticking straight up from his head with the static from the pillow. Harry’s pillow!
“I said, ask Potter-” Draco gestured frantically for Goyle to stop speaking as he caught a glimpse of an all-too familiar trio turning into the corridor.
, startling them both.
Draco smirked. “If you lay a single hex on me, you’ll have far more to worry about than just losing a few house points. Professor Snape said that he won’t stand for any nonsense and I do rather think that he might consider cursing another student to be nonsense.”
It was Draco’s own fault really for getting carried away by the moment, when the dance obviously had been nothing more than Potter’s further way of humiliating him after the first incident. Pathetic, he thought bitterly. Pathetic that he so easily was swayed by Potter’s unconscious charm when all the other boy was trying to do was embarrass him. They were enemies after all and Draco would do well to remember that and push aside any more foolish notions about dances or meaningful glances that really could only hold dislike.
“I danced with him.” Harry informed Ron.
Before he could stop himself, Harry found himself standing over them, his fists clenched so hard that the nails were biting into the soft flesh of his hand. Matching their volume, his voice shaking with anger, he managed to choke out: “Shut up. You have no idea what you’re talking about.”
Draco watched them go until Harry’s dark head disappeared inside Hogwarts. Sighing, he bent down to pick up his scarf, brushing the snow off of it before wrapping it around his neck.
Draco quickly strode away from Harry Potter, heart thundering loudly in his ears. There had been a moment back there, when he had his arms around Potter and managed to finally get the other boy to look up from his feet when he had thought there might have been . . . something. A glimmer swimming below the surface of Potter’s heady green gaze that had flashed into existence as he looked up at Draco. A faint smile had slipped onto the Gryffindor’s face and he had seemed to press closer to Draco, every point of contact between them burning with a sort of wonderful agony brought on by their proximity. And when the song had come to an end, Draco could have sworn that Potter had held onto him for a moment longer than necessary, causing his breath to hitch and a thousand wild daydreams to spring back to life, brought on by a false sense of security that was mercilessly shattered a moment later by Potter’s very clear rejection.
“See?” Harry croaked, focusing even harder on his feet. “I told you I could prove it.”
“It’s winter.” Harry said defensively. He breathed in the familiar scent of Draco. The mint, the aftershave. So what if he noticed what Draco smelled like.
As they moved out of earshot, Ron let out a contented sigh. Hopefully the pair of them would be less frustrating now that he’d forced them out into the open. Really, if you thought about it, one could say that he had saved them not once, but twice.
Weasley was glaring at him furiously, already looking as though he had planned at least five different ways to murder Draco.
“Yeah, Ron,” Potter said soothingly, holding back his friend, who had just reached for his wand. “It’s just one night. Besides, you know what McGonagall will say if you attack him. She’ll probably deduct points from her own house.”
“It’s hot, isn’t it?” Hermione said, leaning over and fixing Ron’s frill for him. “Viktor’s just gone to get some drinks.”
Crabbe nodded firmly.
“I still don’t understand why you did it.” Ron whispered over their cauldron in Potions the next day. “You’d think that hearing upper years mock Malfoy would be the highlight of your year, but you had to go running off to save him.”
A half hour later, all the boys were in their pajamas and getting into bed.
“I doubt
Harry watched as Draco took another step. There was a patch of ice between them, and Draco stepped onto it. Harry saw Draco’s feet go out from under him and he began to move towards him as he fell. Propelled by instinct more than logic.
As the students at the desks around him rose, Harry joined them, hastily gathering books from the desk and starting towards the door while Hermione called after him to wait up. He ignored her. If he waited for Hermione, he'd be there all day.
Harry couldn’t stand it anymore. Through the whole speech, he had been finding it increasingly difficult to breath, watching Draco intently as the other boy's shoulders seemed to cave in a little with each word. By the time this last person had stopped speaking, Draco looked tiny, hunched over his plate. Before the insults could start up again, Harry rose to his feet, propelled by a surge of protective fury that grasped at his heart like a vice. Scanning the table he spotted the speakers, identifying them as several upper years that he didn’t know very well.
But like it or not, Potter and his two friends were getting closer by the moment and Draco shuddered at the thought of them overhearing this conversation, so he summoned every last fragment of his patience and pasted a smile on his face.
“Come to kick it over, Potter?” Draco sneered, as he drew closer.
There was the nausea again. Harry wanted to correct it, to explain himself, but instead he found himself watching the back of Draco’s head, as he walked away from Harry. Legs shaking, Harry skulked back over to Ron who was sitting alone now. Apparently he’d had the same luck as Harry this evening. Padma had abandoned him, Hermione was dancing with Krum again, and Ron looked as miserable as Harry felt. He started to complain to Harry as soon as Harry sat down.
That evening, Harry cornered a first-year Slytherin in the corridor to ask about Draco. It seemed he was fine, just sleeping off the day's excitement in his dorm. Harry, not quite sure of what he was doing, bribed the first year with promises of homework help to have her smuggle something to Draco. He had a feeling a get well gift wouldn’t be well received in person.
“He looks scared,” Hermione whispered, watching as Draco gave one sleeping kneazle a wide berth and gingerly stepped over another one in his path.
The smile faded from Draco’s face. “I guess not,” he said. “Goodnight, Potter.”
Draco stared coolly back. “Oh, for Merlin’s sake, Weasley, it’s one bloody night!”
to be tying it all together.
Harry wasn’t jealous of Pansy. He didn’t have any reason to be. He didn’t like Draco, and Draco didn’t like him, so neither of them could possibly be jealous. Nevertheless, Harry decided he would keep an eye on the couple. That way if they were dancing too close, or tried to sneak off somewhere, he could get them in trouble. He was pretty sure he had spotted Filch lurking by the entrance, periodically yelling at students who tried to sneak out of the hall past him.
“Thank you,” Draco said softly, eyes closely fixated on Harry’s face.
“Hmm? Oh, I’m fine, Ron.” Harry responded, finally turning to face him. “I gave myself a paper cut this morning, but other than that-”
He and Crabbe and Goyle had skipped the end of Astronomy to set the scene up, faking stomach aches that had to be immediately taken to the hospital wing, so he fervently hoped that Professor Sinistra did not happen to walk past them.
Harry elbowed Ron. He could almost see the internal battle this statement had caused. Eventually, pride won out and Draco rose to his feet. “I’ll hold it.” He said.
They were both so caught up in the discussion that they didn’t notice a third figure creeping up on them. Dumbledore stealthily intruded on the conversation, listening in until he realized what they were talking about. “Kiss? What kiss?” He
Harry felt his stomach knot itself as he watched the boy lean back on the table, propping himself up and saying something to Draco. Harry couldn’t hear them from this distance, but it was pretty clear what was happening. The boy even had the audacity to reach out and touch Draco’s perfect hair. It was just a light touch, but the way Draco stepped back, visibly flustered, even from a distance, made Harry want to scream. He thought, for a moment, that Draco turned to look for him, hesitating. He must have imagined it, for in the next instant, Draco had stepped back towards the guy with fresh resolve.
Pansy was nowhere in sight, and the hall was nearly empty now. With one last apologetic glance at Ron, Harry made his move. He wasn’t sure what he was going to say, but decided against saying anything rude or sarcastic when he saw the look on Draco’s face. He looked pensive and sad.
“Keep it down, Potter!” Malfoy hissed, glancing at the other beds furtively to check that their occupants were still asleep.
cold under his palms and his mouth felt
“What?” Draco snapped, eyes narrowing. “Something’s going on. For Salazar’s sake, say something!”
Draco looked dazed. He let Harry look him over, clinging to his arm when Harry helped him to his feet. By now several professors had run over to join them, and McGonagall was busy fussing over Ron while Snape hovered next to Draco looking anxious and a little lost. Eventually he seemed to remember where he was, and curtly escorted Draco to the hospital wing, leaving Harry to trail behind at a distance.
“I- I need more foxglove, Professor.”
Draco did nothing, simply staring back, the eye connection oddly comforting.
“Ridiculous,” he said firmly, turning to move on down the hallway. “I do no such thing.”
It was one of those rare days when Harry woke up and could almost smell snow in the air. Rolling out of bed with far more vigour than usual, he threw himself at the window and looked outside, drinking in the sight of the Hogwarts’ grounds covered in a layer of crisp white. Piling on layers and dragging Ron out from under his warm covers, Harry set off to breakfast with great expectations for the day ahead.
“Well, you’ll never have to put up with my terrible dancing again.” Harry said, hoping that Draco would correct him. He’d tell him that he didn’t mind the terrible dancing, no matter how crushed his toes might be by the end of the night.
As Draco disappeared under a barrage of fur, Harry could hear Hagrid shout: “Not again!” He could hear howls of laughter from the Gryffindors, and cries of dismay from the Slytherins. Harry turned to Ron, to find him laughing so hard that tears ran down his cheeks.
“Who knows?” Ron said darkly. “I wouldn’t put it past him to do it on purpose just so he could get to you. Honestly, Harry, it’s for your own protection! If he’s being poked and prodded, then he’ll be too preoccupied to come after you!”
“Now, listen, I don’t know where the two of you got such ideas, but we are not going to discuss them anymore until we are in private, do you understand?”
Malfoy hesitated, staring down at Harry with something unreadable in his stormy eyes, before following suit.
“I noticed you were missing yours’, so . . . ” Harry shrugged, his explanation trailing off.
Harry tuned back out as Hermione and Ron began to argue. He looked back towards the spot where he had last seen Draco and Pansy. Pansy was alone now, and Harry scanned the room, anxiously trying to spot Draco in the crowd. He finally caught sight of him over by the refreshment table, next to Krum who was getting Hermione’s drink.
“I haven’t got a date yet either.” Ron said, sympathetically. “Hermione?”
Draco’s blood was boiling now, although whether from Goyle’s patronizing or Potter’s ever-increasing proximity, he dared not contemplate.
Draco even shot occasional coy glances at Christoffer and was certain that, as the night was winding down, that if he wanted to, he could end the evening with a Yuletide kiss from a boy who was undoubtedly attractive, clever, and seemed genuinely interested in Draco. If only he could stop thinking about another boy who also possessed the first two points but not the crucial third.
Hurriedly swallowing his mouthful of toast, Ron glanced around the table for Harry. Maybe the near death experience had damaged Malfoy enough for him to mistake Ron’s ginger hair for Harry’s black hair. Harry was nowhere in sight.
“Yes,” he said shortly, setting his goblet down with a dull ‘thud’.
Ron let out an exasperated sigh. “Harry, you can’t pretend something isn’t going on. You’re not even trying to be subtle.”
The crowd around Harry had been shouting, crying out at the sight. Suddenly they went very quiet, the atmosphere shifting. They seemed to be collectively holding their breath as a figure appeared above Draco, somebody carefully climbing over the side of the stairs to reach him. Harry held his breath with them, watching as his best friend joined Draco on the precipice, cautiously holding on to the outside of the railing at an angle that allowed them to help Draco.
Harry picked up the ingredient list for the first time during that class. “Foxglove. He’s missing foxglove. Do we have extra?”
And then Harry did something that if he had even thought of it before that evening, he would have labeled as sacrilege. He leaned in, much as Draco’s dance partner had done earlier. Only this time, Draco didn’t lean away. He moved towards Harry, closing the distance between them. His hand reached up, his fingers tangled in Harry’s hair, his soft lips pressed into Harry’s own. Harry found himself worrying about his own lips. Was he pressing back too hard? Too light? Were they chapped?
“You have no right to say such horrible things about a person when you don’t really know them at all,” Harry continued, eyes blazing as he stepped closer to the Gryffindors, who were staring at him, mouths gaping with the same surprise that was coursing through Draco.
Even Crabbe and Goyle were keeping their distance, the first decision of theirs that Draco would ever classify as ‘wise’.
“If you’re not going to be pleasant, please leave,” Draco said sharply.
As the stairs came into sight, Harry could hear shouts of shock and dismay from the Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs around him. Stopping beside Neville he looked up the stairs to where the other boy was pointing. There was somebody clinging to the railing, far over their heads. Some unfortunate soul had lost their footing, and was swinging over open air, dangling above a horrible drop. It took Harry a moment to realize who it was, but when he spotted the head of pale blonde hair, he knew it couldn't be anyone else. Draco Malfoy was about to fall to his death.
“Shut up, Ron,” Harry said. “Hermione’s right. It’s not funny.”
Inside the dorm, Malfoy was already dressed in his uniform, and knotting his tie with expert hands. Harry felt an odd pang seeing Malfoy’s hair tamed from its adorable bedhead and coiffed back as properly as always.
“Thank you, Professor.” Harry retrieved the foxglove as quickly as possible, then made his way back to Ron, clutching it to his chest. He waited until Snape wasn’t watching him anymore, then darted over to Draco’s cauldron.
Disgusted by the vile memories his dress-robes conjured, Draco turned away from the mirror, fixing his cuff-links on and ruffling back his hair carelessly. It’s not like he was actually trying to impress anyone, least of all Pansy, who nevertheless squealed with delight when he came downstairs, clapping her hands as she took in his elegant charcoal robes, which clashed spectacularly with her garishly frilly orange dress.
” Harry corrected, blushing very becomingly, which only tightened the nervous knots tying themselves in Draco’s stomach.
“I know.” Harry said, so quietly that it was barely audible to his own ears.
“You’ll have to ask Snape for it.”
“Nothing!” Harry finally said, turning to the snowman, hesitating a moment before kicking it over, the compact snowballs breaking into lopsided pieces around Draco’s scarf.
Harry glanced up at the desk where Snape was sitting, watching them all intently as if hoping to catch them making a mistake. He glanced at Draco one last time. He was underneath a desk, having joined Crabbe and Goyle in searching the surrounding area for their missing ingredient. Bracing himself, Harry stood.
Draco shifted onto his side, tucking an arm underneath the cool pillow, and yawning, the muted waves of sleep almost upon him. To his surprise, he found himself staring into Potter’s bright green eyes. The other boy blushed, glancing away for a moment.
“Don’t patronize me.” Draco snarled.
“That would show the git!” Ron crowed eagerly. “And if he so much as says a word, we can go to McGonagall and say he’s being ungrateful and bothering us!”
“And I really, really want to kiss you,” Harry whispered, watching him hopefully.
Harry had half expected Ron to be waiting for him outside the door, but of course, it was too much to expect that he would have finished the test early. Hanging back by the door, Harry let the crowd of other students file past him, deciding he should wait for Hermione after all. He was about to poke his head back in the door to check on her when a commotion from further down the hall drew his attention. The group of students that had just departed from the classroom had reached the staircase and something happening further up the stairs was causing a great deal of distress. Throwing a guilty glance over his shoulder at the room where Hermione was no doubt engaging their professor in a horrible discussion on ancient runes, Harry started off towards the staircase.
Harry turned his attentions back to Draco after that. He didn’t even notice when Parvati got up to dance with a Beauxbatons student. He didn’t notice that she never came back to sit with him either. The next thing he was conscious of other than Draco was a strangled noise from Ron.
Ron snorted dismissively, falling back on his own bed.
When breakfast was finally done, the three of them set off, vying with crowds of classmates to be the first out the door. To make the first steps into the snow, and to mark it as their own. Harry managed to duck under a taller Gryffindor, sidestep a group of Ravenclaws, and tumbled out the door before anyone else. The feeling of his boots sinking into the snow was just as satisfying as he had imagined it would be. With shouts and whoops of childish joy, he and his friends set off, throwing snowballs, slipping on icy patches, and not minding the cold.
will deter Malfoy,” Ron said, frowning at the creatures. “He won’t be scared of a bunch of cats.”
Harry would have protested, but the next thing he knew, Draco’s arm was around his waist and they were moving and he didn’t have time to do anything at all. Harry was terrified, more scared than he had been during the opening dance. He kept his gaze on his feet, staunchly avoiding Draco’s beautiful eyes.
As for Malfoy, he was gaping at Harry, hands still clutching at his tie, half way through knotting it.
“I’ll set a Tempus so we can get back upstairs before the others wake up,” Harry assured him.
The other boy avoided his gaze, a faint pink tinging his cheeks as he focused on pulling on his robes.
“And I don’t want to ignore it,” Harry continued, speaking directly to Malfoy now. “And I don’t think that you do either, really.”
“You’re mad.” Ron whispered after him.
“Do you understand?” Harry demanded again, after the Gryffindors formulated no response.
After an hour of this, the three of them sank down breathlessly in the snow, letting the cold and damp seep up through their cloaks.
It had seemed so different from anything Draco had ever said to him before. In fact, Harry couldn’t recall a single insult in the babble he had just had directed at him. If Harry’s legs weren’t so shaky, he might have run after Draco. To make sure he hadn’t been possessed or poisoned, if for no other reason. Something must have happened to incite such drivel.
“Did you see Dean?” Ron asked, once he recovered his breath enough to get the words out. “I got him in the side of the head with a snowball earlier, and he couldn’t see straight to get me back.”
“What in Merlin’s soggy trousers was that?” Ron said, once he regained his voice. He had been trying to speak since Draco disappeared from sight, but had been unable to do anything but sputter. “Harry?”
“Fine,” she said, slumping forward to rest her chin in her hands. “So how is ‘Potter’s saviour complex’ advantageous to you?”
Harry lapsed into silence for the rest of the ball, allowing Ron to continue his tirade. He watched Draco, hoping that another opportunity would arise for Harry to ask him to dance. He had no such luck. Draco seemed to have a full dance card, dancing with the same guy again and again. Every time he was free, Pansy would get to him before Harry could. It was torture, watching Draco and being unable to dance with him again. The phantom sensation of Draco’s arm around his waist left Harry breathless and frustrated.
Draco looked up, startled. “Potter.”
Propping his pillow against one arm of the couch, Harry curled up on one side, gesturing for Malfoy to do the same.
“I want to wake up beside you again and curl up with you on couches--”
So this was how it was going to be. Back to cool steady enmity like last night never happened. Like they hadn’t slept curled up against each other for most of the night. Like their sleepy civility had never existed.
“I’m afraid that you shall have to share with the other houses,” Snape said sympathetically, looking as though he truly did feel sorry for them. “There is a list by dormitory with your new assigned sleeping spots tacked up outside the Great Hall. Your hosts have already been warned by their heads of house to be welcoming, however if you still have any trouble, come directly to me and I shall sort them out.”
Draco eyed the approaching dark-haired figure frantically. “Goyle, no. Just-”
“Good morning, Draco.” Harry said, smiling at him. “How are you?”
Draco frowned at him. “What are you thanking me for? For putting up with your terrible footwork?”
And they all lived happily ever after,
By now, the commotion was beginning to draw a crowd. Harry pushed through to the front, shoving people aside to get as close as his shaking legs would permit him. There was no way he could get to Draco without a broom, no way he could conjure up a spell to save him when his whole body was rebelling against him. He doubted he could even remember his own name, let alone a complex spell to carry Draco safely to him.
Crabbe and Goyle exchanged glances, before sighing in a fashion that was almost - pitying? Salazar, no.
Before dozens of watchful eyes, Ron caught hold of Draco’s arm. With a great strain, he pulled the other boy up to meet him, helping him to clamber back over the side of the bannister, where they both collapsed on the stone steps. As they reached safety, a huge, roaring, cheer went up below them. The crowd relaxed, and Harry did too. Legs still shaking, he managed to push himself into motion, and took off at a run up the stairs. He dropped to the ground beside them both and folded them into a hug.
“Oh, Draco, you look so handsome,” she gushed appreciatively, before spinning around to prompt his own comments on her appearance.
“He liked me.” Draco said.
Snape let out a long-suffering sigh. “It appears that the magical bonds strengthening the window out to the lake have weakened and water has been seeping through. It’s going to take a day or two to repair them.”
So when the day of the Yule Ball arrived, Draco had his entire dormitory to himself to slowly go through the well-practiced motions of clothing himself in the dress-robes he usually wore for fancy dinners his mother held at the Manor, dinners where he was expected to be charming and witty and to be the model of a perfect son who would someday make a perfect husband to one of their friends’ perfect pureblood daughters, with whom he was expected to breed perfect pureblood children.
Slytherins seemed to have a different approach to building snowmen than Gryffindors. Harry had built snowmen with his friends before, and it was a lot of yelling and laughing, falling over, dropping bits, and eventually ending up with a slightly lopsided, but impressively large construction. Slytherins on the other hand, seemed to hand out roles and to take it far too seriously. Harry could see Crabbe and Goyle rolling a base, while Pansy Parkinson made them stop periodically so that she could measure it. Draco was standing nearby, and though Harry couldn’t make out what he was saying, it was obvious that he was directing the others.
Draco’s eyes widened as Harry approached. He nodded a hello, and pretended to be busy with the arrangement of drinks on the refreshment table. “Malfoy.” Harry said, trying desperately to figure out what he should say. They hadn’t actually spoken since the incident. His mind scrambling, Harry said the first thing that he thought of that actually resembled an English sentence. “Saw you dancing. Can’t get a better partner than that? He had two left feet.”
“What?”
Ron couldn’t contain himself any longer. Here was Draco Malfoy fussing over Harry Potter’s papercut, while Harry just let him do it. They were both idiots. “Well.” He said, setting down the piece of toast he had been clutching. “I can see I’m not needed here. I’ll leave you two to it.”
The dull sound of a Tempus charm rang in Draco’s ears and he rolled over, intending to shove his pillow over his head, but instead suddenly falling. Tangled in his duvet, pillow slipping down on top of him, Draco found himself on the cold, hard floor of the Gryffindor Common room, looking up at the couch where Potter was still sound asleep, even through the piercing alarm.
Harry had never been particularly religious, but he found himself praying. Whether it was to God, Merlin or the ghost of Salazar Slytherin, he wasn’t sure. Unable to move his eyes from Draco as he grasped desperately at the side of the staircase, Harry sent a silent promise to whoever might be listening. If Draco didn’t die, he’d tell him. He’d tell him everything.
Dean looked thoroughly flummoxed, while Neville glanced confusedly between everyone, as though he weren’t entirely sure that he wasn’t still dreaming. Seamus slept on, unbothered by the commotion.
“He was better than you, Potter,” Draco sneered. “You wouldn’t be able to keep up with me.” He bit rather viciously into a chocolate frog, as if to punctuate the words.
“That’s good.” Harry said, still beaming at Malfoy. They stood staring at each other for a moment while Ron wished he could sink into the ground and escape. Maybe he wouldn’t have to tell Malfoy why he had saved him. Harry wasn’t being particularly subtle.
Draco watched as Harry stepped back from the chastened students and glanced across the Hall to meet Draco’s eyes. Draco swallowed, before nodding slightly. Harry dipped his head in response, then sat back down between his friends.
“Pansy!”
It was their first class with Hagrid since Malfoy’s incident, and Harry felt sure that Draco would have to behave himself this time. He’d be too scared to interact with the creatures. No matter how much he had milked his wound, the fact remained that he had gotten hurt and was unlikely to invite another injury. Harry was somewhat disappointed upon arriving in class to discover that there wasn’t another hippogriff. Instead, Hagrid had a bunch of kneazles that could only have been described as a hoard. The massive quantity of them lay spread out all around the students.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Harry said quickly, pulse racing nervously.
Weasley continued to frown. Draco held his breath, wondering if he should reach for his own wand.
“Why, are you scared, Malfoy?” Ron asked. “You wouldn’t want to be scratched by a kitty-cat, would you?”
“Bloody hell, do you think Malfoy was confessing his love to you?” Ron said, eyes wide. “I mean, that’s what that sounded like, right? That can’t be it.” Ron’s voice reached a higher pitch as he wheeled frantically to Hermione. “That’s not what just happened, right? Right? It wasn’t!”
Draco fought the urge to squeeze his eyes shut as he fell, instead reaching his hands out, hoping to catch himself. He braced for impact with the hard, frozen surface, already wincing at the pain to come, when suddenly he stopped moving, his fall abruptly broken.
“Serves him right,” Ron replied. “He shouldn’t have been fooling about last class.”
“Well, someone had to save him.” Ron said, hiding his shaking hands behind his back. “You were out of range.”
“Oh.” Malfoy said, sounding rather crestfallen. Ron wondered if perhaps he should have said Harry after all, but he was saved from it when Harry himself took a seat beside him.
“No. You put all of ours in because you were distracted thinking about his beautiful blue eyes.” Ron said, sounding utterly exhausted with Harry.
“Harry, what are you doing?” Ron yelped, as Harry stepped directly on his feet. All of the concentration he’d had when he’d danced with Draco was gone.
“You saved me. I’m in your debt.” Malfoy said, not meeting Ron’s eyes. “May I ask you something?”
“Albus!” McGonagall exclaimed, “How long have you been there?”
“Fine! So what’s the plan?”
The same nauseous tingle crept up through Harry’s midriff to engulf his heart. He was spared from having to respond by Ron’s strangled: “What? Who the hell are you going with?”
“Help! Help!” Draco screamed. Where was Harry Potter when you actually needed him?
“Happy Yule, Draco.”
And so Draco attempted to focus on Christoffer, laughing when he made a joke and even coming up with a few of his own witticisms. He tried to ask polite questions about his family, and apologized when he slipped off into thought and missed one of Christoffer’s own questions about Draco, something which occurred far more often than Draco liked to admit. Although he liked to admit even less that the thoughts he was slipping into always seemed to circulate around a certain messy haired Gryffindor.
“Thank you for the dance,” the boy said. “It’s not every day that one is able to dance with a pure-blood heir. It has been an honour.”
Ron ignored him. “What do you have in mind?”
“What the hell?” Pansy whispered.
The fire had burned out to glowing coals and the morning air was cold against Draco’s skin. Wrapping his duvet around his shoulders, and sparing one last glance down at Potter, whose face was so peacefully handsome in sleep, Draco made his way back up to the dormitory.
“We haven’t danced into anything yet,” Draco said, “and you miraculously haven’t stepped on my toes either. Perhaps you’re a better dancer than I gave you credit for.”
Harry sat upright, biting back a curse at the pain crawling across his ribs, sure to leave a bruise in its wake. He fumbled for his glasses.
“From the Slytherins? Unlikely.” Ron snorted, turning to follow Harry. He nearly collided with him, because Harry had not moved far from the snowman. He was frozen in his tracks, watching an approaching figure.
Swallowing hard, he lowered himself over the railing as he heard the classroom door open. Clinging to the bars, arm muscles already burning with the exertion of holding his entire body weight, he peered up to watch for Harry to come out of the classroom, whereupon Draco would begin screaming for help in his most rescuable fashion. Harry would have to come dashing over and pull Draco up. The motion would throw him into Harry’s arms and the contact would send that delightfully painful jolt through his stomach that was just like . . . like . . .
“You did. And this isn’t the first time. There was that day when you caught him in the snow.”
Harry glared at Draco one last time, before stalking off towards the castle, Granger and Weasley following behind him.
“Oh yes, that’s definitely it!” Pansy said loudly, rolling her eyes.
Draco allowed himself to cling to Harry’s shoulders one moment longer than necessary, before forcing himself to pull away before he did something even more embarrassing.
“Did you see?” Minerva McGonagall asked excitedly, clutching at the collar of her emerald robes.
“I’m not. I- truly I never meant to. Draco, I like you too.” Harry sputtered, trying to get the words out. “I really, really like you. I’m sorry, I’m an idiot, I should have said something sooner.”
Draco carefully chopped up the foxglove, sprinkling it into his cauldron just in time, while his mind carefully sorted over what had just happened. What had been happening for the past couple weeks. Why did Harry keep paying attention to him? Something underlying
“Thank you, Ron.” He breathed, pulling away from them to ensure that Draco was unhurt.
“And would you believe it, he just writes to me out of the blue, mere weeks before Christmas break, saying that I have to stay at school, without even giving a semblance of a reason?” Draco spat, clenching the scrawled over parchment so tightly that a slight rip snaked over one side. “Well?” He prompted, looking to his friends for some sort of reaction.
Draco was still on the ground searching for the missing foxglove and growing more and more frustrated by the sound of it. Harry could hear him growling at Crabbe and Goyle for their carelessness. Holding the slightly crushed purple flowers out, Harry tapped Draco on the shoulder.
“Draco?” He finally managed, getting to his feet with as much dignity as he could muster, which, given that he
Harry’s eyes slowly fluttered open. The sun was only just starting to creep over the horizon and the room was still mostly dark. Luxuriating in the realization that he still had a few hours of sleep, Harry turned over, curling into the warmth of his bed.
THE END.
“Saved me for…?” Malfoy sputtered.
Draco whirled around, wand out, hand shaking nearly as quickly as his heart. “What did you just say?”
He wasn’t quite sure why, but the name seemed right.
“Yes, do, and let’s put this whole thing behind us!” Harry said enthusiastically, gathering up his bedding and stumbling back up the stairs.
“Tell him?” Harry gasped.
The two of them took off again, kicking up clouds of white as Ron tried to avenge himself. Harry, still exhausted, sat back and watched. It didn’t seem as if Ron was going to have any luck. Harry watched just long enough to see Hermione land a solid hit with a snowball, before his attention drifted elsewhere. There was a crowd of Slytherins building a snowman nearby, and Harry found that more interesting than watching Ron lose a snowball fight.
Today's class had been particularly unpleasant. Harry usually had Ron to distract him from the mind numbing curriculum, but today, Ron had been forced to make up a test for McGonagall. An entirely unfair predicament as the original test had only been missed because Ron had been suffering from a migraine. Harry couldn't wait to get out the door so that he could find Ron. It was no use complaining to Hermione about classwork, she'd only give him a lecture on why he should appreciate assignments. Ron would sympathize.
“What do you mean?” Ron asked interestedly, sitting up.
“Get on with it.” Ron said, grabbing a very confused Hermione by the arm and pulling her after him. They exited the Great Hall, Hermione trying to piece it together as they went. As they left, Ron just caught the beginning of what Harry was saying:
Draco turned to see Christoffer, the Durmstrang boy he had been dancing with earlier, lounging casually beside the table, hands tucked into his pockets and friendly curiosity in his dark eyes. He had pretty eyes, Draco admitted, although green was far more attractive than brown.
Shocked, Draco glanced up to see Harry Potter staring at him, their noses barely two inches apart as the Gryffindor wrapped his arms more firmly around Draco’s middle, holding him above the ice. Automatically, Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck, barely breathing as he stared up into his green eyes. His glasses were smudged with melted snowflakes, but even with the obstruction, his beautiful eyes shone through.
“In love?” Harry asked, shakily. “You were in love with me? Oh, Merlin, Draco. I’m so sorry.”
“Please, Professor?” Harry asked, suddenly wishing he hadn’t felt the need to be a hero over something so stupid. “I’d like to learn how to brew the potion properly.”
Harry sucked in a breath, summoning his Gryffindor courage. “It’s true.”
Harry reached out, grabbing at Draco’s trembling hand. He held onto it tightly, unsure if he had heard Draco correctly. Draco liked him, but he, Harry, had been such an utter fool that he had somehow misconstrued the entire thing.
Harry wasn’t sure what had gotten into him, but he found himself agreeing with Hermione. Something about the anxious look on Draco’s face inspired pity in him. It was short-lived, however, as Draco spoiled it by sneering at Harry as he took a seat.
“I’ve figured out why Potter keeps interacting with me!” Draco announced excitedly, looking around at his gathered friends.
“We better get going,” he simply replied, clenching his jaw reflexively. Merlin, he could barely remember why he’d agreed to this. The upcoming evening was sure to be nothing less than pure hell.
“What?” Draco sputtered, after his coughing fit had died down. “You can’t be serious.”
“Merlin, white was not a good choice for him.” Parvati said. “He looks more washed out than usual.”
“Guess we have to give him props for that,” Dean said reluctantly.
“I think he’s missing an ingredient.” Harry said.
“I’m going to dance with him again.” Harry said firmly, as if he could make it happen through sheer conviction. “Just wait and see.”
“Do you need something, Potter?” He snapped, noticing that Harry still hadn’t moved. “Because if you don’t mind, I’m rather busy with my potion. You might consider being concerned with your own. Merlin knows you need to more than me.”
“What about just now?” Crabbe timidly suggested, wincing under the quelling glare Draco shot his way.
Hagrid began the lesson shortly afterwards, and Harry quickly forgot about Draco as he listened to Hagrid’s awkward explanation of kneazle mating rituals. It wasn’t until Hagrid was explaining ministry classifications to them that Harry was reminded of Draco and his newfound fear of magical creatures.
“Mates, don’t this,” Harry said. “It’s not his fault that his dormitory is being repaired and he has to bunk with us.”
“Was that Harry Potter you were dancing with?”
“He was terrible.” Harry wasn’t sure what he was doing, but there was something cathartic about bad mouthing that horrible, attractive guy who had swept Draco off his feet.
Just as Harry began to relax again, he spotted a boy heading in Draco’s direction. A tall, muscular boy, in dress robes with a Durmstrang crest on his sleeve. Harry would have assumed that the boy was one of Krum’s friends, making his way over to say hello. But the boy didn’t stop to talk to Krum, instead he made his way over to Draco.
“Evidently you can’t.” Draco spat at him. He gripped Harry’s right hand and placed it on his shoulder. “You’d better let me lead.”
“I wanted to say thank you.” Malfoy responded, sounding rather as though he didn’t want to.
“Perfectly, Minerva.” Severus Snape replied, “If I hadn’t seen, that would make hiding behind a tree to watch the interaction much stranger.”
Draco spun around, shocked to hear Harry’s voice echoing across the Great Hall; not to join the others in their taunts, but in defense of him!
“Merlin, Hermione! I don’t know!”
Only his bed didn’t usually respond to this action by elbowing him in the face.
“I think,” Snape frowned, “that it was young Mr. Malfoy who made the first move.”
“Why are we looking at a Slytherin snowman?” Ron asked, poking at the scarf.
“Thank you.” Draco’s voice was soft. He sounded nervous, but happy, and the fact that he was enjoying the encounter twisted the knife in Harry’s heart. Harry half wanted to step in, the stand protectively in front of Draco and to ask if this boy was bothering him. The other half was torn between wanting to run away, and wanting to leave Draco alone. He sounded genuinely happy, and Harry didn’t want to take that away from him.
“Couch!” Ron gasped, eyes widening with the realization.
For a moment, Harry thought Draco was going to lean the rest of the way to meet the other boy’s lips. Relief flooded through him as Draco turned instead, twisting away from the other boy who frowned and planted a kiss on Draco’s hand instead before walking away.
“What does he want from me?” Harry responded, ignoring his friend’s question.
“Sweet Salazar!” Pansy cried. “Draco, what madness is this?”
“It can’t be too obvious or he’ll know we did something,” Dean reasoned, getting out his wand and hovering it over the mattress. “But there’s this spell that Fred and George used to do that would make your mattress feel unforgivably lumpy every time you just drifted off to sleep. It would be so uncomfortable that you would wake up as soon as you fell asleep, so you’d be awake all night!”
“Hey, what about we do a little test, to, you know, keep him in line?” Dean said, grinning as he wandered across the room towards the new bed.
They shrugged, expressions blank. Draco suppressed a groan, raking an exasperated hand through his hair. “Honestly, you two, any sort of response will do!”
“I don’t buy it.” Ron responded, fishing whatever Harry had just put in out with the tip of his wand. “Watch what you’re doing, Harry.”
“You clearly don’t like me, so stop toying with me. I’m done with this, done with you.” Draco spat. “I’ve found someone who actually likes me, so maybe I have a chance at being happy now. Why can’t you just stop meddling and leave me be?”
“Can I help you?” Ron asked.
Salazar help him.
Harry was tempted to fall back into the pattern of trading barbs, it felt normal and correct. It was what they were supposed to be doing. But he had more important things to address now. If he didn’t confront this thing head on, he could look forward to more gorgeous guys pursuing Draco, more jealous nausea, more painful confusion. “Who was that boy.” He asked.
Dean nodded solemnly, waving his wand over the bedspread and muttering something just as the sound of sharp footsteps echoed outside the door.
If Harry had been able to look away, he would have taken a moment to collect himself. Instead, he stayed there, watching, absorbing the sight and wanting to melt away more than he had ever wanted anything in his life. Finally, the last, torturously slow notes of the song faded away. The boy took Draco’s arm and led him back to the refreshments table. Harry waited, his breath catching in his throat, praying that the boy would walk away.
“Welcome, students of Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang, to what I believe will be a simply marvelous evening! And, here to kick off our festivities, are our Triwizard champions!”
“Never at the rate they’re going.” She responded, as Snape made a hasty exit. After all, he had better things to do than listen to his coworkers discuss student gossip. Although he had to admit, he was a little bit proud of Harry and Draco for figuring things out. Well, mostly Draco. Harry was, after all, still a Potter.
“Bloody hell!” He hissed, cradling his head in his hands. “Goyle, you numbskull, what the fuck did you do that for? I could have died!”
Draco nodded, leaning on Harry while he tried to get his bearings. As soon as he had calmed down, he hastily withdrew his hand from Harry’s. Harry expected him to say something rude, but he didn’t. He remained very silent while Hagrid escorted him up to the hospital wing. Hagrid seemed almost more rattled, gibbering on about how he couldn’t believe the kind of luck it would take to have something like this happen twice in a row.
But neither boy even looked up, instead focused on nudging each other in a manner they obviously thought was discreet.
Harry watched as Hagrid lowered the kneazle into Draco’s arms. Draco stood very still as if afraid to move. The kneazle stared up at him, blinking slowly, then it turned, very deliberately, and yowled. The other kneazles, roused from slumber rose in unison and took off at a run towards Draco.
The group of them moved away after that, leaving their snowman standing alone. Harry, unable to help himself, got to his feet and made his way over. He wasn’t sure why, but he felt a need to see it up close. Ron and Hermione rejoined him at that point, and walked with him, Ron loudly complaining that Hermione had broken his nose. Harry glanced at him quickly, and once he had ascertained that Ron was fine, continued to ignore him.
Draco’s heart was pounding furiously, although whether it was from the adrenaline brought on by his near fall or Harry’s achingly close proximity, he didn’t like to venture a guess.
“What?” Draco stared at her, frowning in confusion. “No, Pansy, for once we’re not talking about my unrequited love for Potter, although that will come into it in a minute. We’re talking about his saviour complex! See, I’ve figured out that’s what’s been happening! Every time he comes over to me, it’s because he’s trying to save me from something! First it was the ice, and then the Great Hall, and earlier today in Potions, he gave me the foxglove that Goyle misplaced!”
“Why did you do it?”
Harry had just spent the entirety of a very boring class watching Hermione scribbling notes with her quill so hard that he thought the tip might break. He hadn’t taken many notes himself, and was left with a sheet of paper that was mainly covered in tiny drawings of snakes. He crumpled it up and shoved it in his pocket as class ended.
“What?” Malfoy asked, glancing down at him in confusion.
Ron followed him, still muttering about Malfoy. “I swear, if he so much as turns up his nose at one thing!”
Harry nodded, extending his hand, watching as Draco’s pale, slender fingers folded into Harry’s own. His hand fit perfectly in Harry’s, and all the dizzying nausea that had come with seeing him dance with the boy was gone, swept away by Draco’s proximity.
After the incident in the snow, Harry had been avoiding the subject of Draco Malfoy at all costs. It was becoming impossible to ignore the fact that he had a crush, and the last thing he needed was for Ron or Hermione to comment on the incident. As much as Harry relished the idea of being Draco’s Knight in Shining Armor, it was not a reputation that he currently wanted to have.
“Who, Krum? Don’t tell me you’ve fallen for him too.” Ron said, angrily watching Hermione and Krum waltz past.
Resigned to the inevitable pain that would follow, Draco watched as Potter steadily steered his partner across the dance floor, not particularly skilled, but endearingly earnest in his attempt. He was more focused on his footwork than on his partner, something Draco took far too much enjoyment from before he sternly reminded himself of the incident, heart twinging.
He stepped towards him, feeling impossibly underdressed in his pajamas next to the other boy’s full uniform.
“Harry?” Parvati said, jabbing him in the shoulder. “Have you been listening to me at all?”
“What the hell, Malfoy?” Potter said, his tone oddly soft, as though he was saying “Do you love me?”, a comparison Draco hastily shoved to the side, for fear that yet again he would speak aloud his thoughts and he didn’t think that even he wanted to know what his answer would be to such a question.
“I really am sorry,” Harry said sincerely, stepping so close to Draco’s side that if he just leaned over to the left a bit their arms would be pressed together.
“Well it behaves like a cat,” Ron said. “Here comes Malfoy now. Let’s see if he can find a way to get injured this time.”
“Nonsense. This is a wonderful achievement.” Dumbledore responded, quite seriously. “Now, Minerva, we really must talk about Mr. Weasley and Ms. Granger. When can we expect that to be resolved?”
A list of things that he had been too stupid to tell Draco attacked Harry like Cornish pixies, pinching and poking at his soul with sharp jabs. Harry had never told him he was sorry for all the cruel things he’d said, though they had mainly been in retaliation. Harry had never told him that he liked him, though Draco hadn’t given him much of a chance. Harry had never told Draco that he would do anything for him. Though that couldn’t be true because here they were, and he was unable to save him. Draco would die, and Harry would be left with a list of unspoken truths. Things that he should have said before it was too late.
Malfoy hesitated, gaze flashing briefly towards the bed that had been conjured for him. “Nothing,” he finally said, sitting up and moving to slide out from underneath the covers. “Sorry to disturb you, Potter.”
The rest of the Slytherins gathered outside the entrance to their dormitory grumbled in complaint. They had always known nothing good would come of having only a pane of glass between them and the giant squid’s home.
So Draco just stood there, breath slowly slipping away from him as he was swallowed by Potter’s green gaze, as words slowly began to spin out of his mouth in an almost dream-like haze. “I was wondering, well, you see, what I want is, well, what I’ve actually wanted for a very long time, odd as though it may seem, and believe me, I have tried to make it seem less odd, but it really never won’t be, because it’s you and me, and you’re, well, you, and I’m definitely me, although maybe perhaps not at this minute, even though I always feel the most myself when I’m around you, Potter, which is why I want you to come to the Yule Ball with me, so we can be around each other without killing each other for once and I can just stand there and look at you without feeling guilty and my insides being twisted up in knots, except they probably still will be, because you’re gorgeous and I’m- oh, shit,” Draco faltered, whispering the ending obscenity to himself as he realized that he had speaking aloud for the past minute and that, yes, that frozen look on Potter’s beautiful face was because he had heard absolutely everything Draco had just said.
“Understand, I’m only doing this to prove to you that I can dance.” Harry said, as he led Draco onto the dance floor. A slow song started up, and Harry fumbled, struggling to remember where he should put his hands.
“Ron, c’mon! You’re worrying too much!” Harry pleaded, ignoring the strange burble of excitement that had appeared in his stomach at the thought of Malfoy sleeping so close to him. Perfect hair spread out against his pillow. He probably looked like an angel.
Harry grumbled an apology, sneaking a glance over his shoulder at Draco. Draco was focused on his potion, stirring it while Crabbe and Goyle hunted the surrounding desks for something.
“Leave it alone.” Harry responded. The snowman was even more impressive up close. Maybe the Slytherins had the right idea with their approach.
They danced mostly in silence, which made Harry anxious. He wasn’t sure if he should attempt to fill the void, to make Draco laugh as the boy from earlier had, or if he should just savour the moment. By the end of the dance, he had only trod on Draco’s foot once, and he had managed not to topple over, so he decided that he should count the dance as a success.
Draco felt extremely odd, being privy to such a jovial scene. The Gryffindors laughed and chatted as they slipped under their covers, as though he wasn’t even there. Only Potter made something of an effort to talk to him, directing him to the bathroom where he could get changed and brush his teeth. At least, that’s what Draco thought he was saying, as at the time he had been rather distracted by the sight of Potter in pajama pants and an oversized cotton t-shirt. He was disgusted by the sloppiness, is what he told himself, pushing back any thoughts of how comfortable it would feel to lean his head against Potter’s shoulder.
There wasn't much to hear about two adults so young they were barely old enough. Did his father like Quidditch? How did Frank meet Alice? Was she as beautiful as in the photos? Was she as smart as everyone said?
"Ernie Macmillan is out there!"
"Mhm," Draco says.
Draco snorts rolling his eyes. Neville is unfazed and doesn't leave. "I'll go to my room," he says, throwing his coat over his shoulder. Neville takes his arm and keeps his gaze on him.
"What the fuck are you talking about?"
"Do you want to come in for a beer? I invite you,” Harry says with that bright smile he get when he won a Quidditch match and someone told him (usually a teacher) that maybe one day he would be as great as his father.
"Right! What round do you want? Number seven on the menu is the most requested."
Hogsmede's new bar that had been talked about so much lately was in fact an LGBT bar that you could only enter through a booth behind Hog's Head. Neville had been itching to go since he first heard from him, but Draco would never agree to go to a gay bar with him since he was still "closeted" and highly doubted that Harry, a straight man, would be interested, anyway.
"My mother came to invite her and her mother to tea when my father went on long trips. Once she almost convinced me to get a piercing."
Draco mumbles how much curse hits his head, but the disturbance seems to stab everything he has left so he takes a deep breath until the heart resumes its initial rhythm. Turn his head where Neville came out just a few seconds ago and look at Harry Potter next to him again. His mouth is open with a string of drool falling down one side and his hair is more disheveled than normal. It's gross disgust and looks like any hobo he might find himself in the knockturn alley around every corner. If he been here a week and a half, that means the game is next week. He's no longer disturbed because there seems to be nothing he can do at this point other than wait for Pomfrey to let him go, but considering that he has been unconscious for more than two days he sees it as impossible no matter how much he does.
Harry shrugs. "And you would have been fully entitled, Malfoy. But I was more concerned about not ruining the little breakthrough I had made with you to be honest."
The Hufflepuff team gathers in a large circle around both professors. The weather was too horrible to be outside, especially for a Quidditch practice, but since Slytherin was suspended until February for his mischief with Felix Felicis, Draco had to do something during his afternoons not to freak out with boredom, and if anyone came To win this match, he preferred it to be Hufflepuff and not Gryffindor. Now that Potter was in command it wasn't certain that they would take a leading role on the house cup marker. McGonagall might have Dumbledore fever.
"Good game, Neville." Harry reaches his side putting his left hand on Neville's shoulder and waving his right hand in greeting.
"Shut the fuck up, Draco." Draco leans back in his chair and snaps a cup of tea that arrives right at the table next to him.
"No, I'm-"
"This is what happens when you teach potions."
"I've known him since we were eleven years old, he would never cheat, I know."
"We have everything sorted out, professor." Fresia McKinnon shrugs. She's the captain, competitive by nature, from whom she would least expect so much trust, but perhaps she should trust the instinct of his students, they were no fools.
The four walk in the direction of Hog's Head, but enter an alley where they find a fence that has on the facade the portrait of two women looking into each other's eyes. Ernie mutters a password and the wall opens allowing them to pass. Draco can make out multi-colored lights coming out of an entrance at the other end of the small room. An elf receives them and hands them an envelope. Ernie thanks him and guides everyone inside the place.
"No, maybe I was going to check the ingredients in my office, for the rest of the week or start ordering concoctions with Hagrid, really who knows, I'm doing my best to leave the weekends off."
"Do you have any idea what your sister might have?"
Two hours later the round of drinks is almost over and his head is spinning, but he doesn't want to stop, not for now, at least. Maybe when he started throwing up or when he couldn't stand up it would be a good idea, but for now... no. He was having fun, even with Harry who could be funny and he looked cute with a red nose tip and watery eyes.
"Thank you for- for helping me and for the potion, I wanted to send a letter as soon as possible, but you know, exam season."
, bright red and all, and sang Happy Birthday to her in all the Macbeth Witches style."
I hope if someone read this they liked it, and I always appreciate a bit of criticism to improve. English isn't my mother tongue so I apologize for any mistakes.
Thirty laps seems to be enough that morning when the chilly wind begins to chill his toes and he decides it's best to go back inside for breakfast. His belly is roaring like he's eaten a mountain lion and he walks into the castle with a smile, until Harry pulls him by the arm into the dining room preventing Neville from going to his room to change. Lots of glances cover him and his face flushes completely.
"Silence!" Draco yells red with fury. His hands tremble and if it weren't for the strange lighting the others would have noticed his watery eyes. "I want ... I'm sorry, director. I can retire?"
"I wore this all my years as a student, loyalty is screwed up for me right now." Harry nods with a smile, extending the robe to his partner. Even he can hear the nervous giggles from the closest girls at the Slytherin table.
Why did he turn to Draco Malfoy, the potions professor he knew not as a jerk who liked to make his life miserable but as a professor no more than two months ago? Why him and not Neville? Why not his ex-girlfriend who came out as a pansexual in the Quidditch finals in Ireland and who was the talk of gossip in all the wizarding journals?
This was all fucking shit.
Neville gives Draco his best serial killer look.
"Evan, let's go soon!" Evelyn Wolff appears pulling the blond boy away. "Gilbert Clearwater is hitting Jeremy McKinley and Michael Henderson-"
Connor and Evan step back after sharing a quick glance. Teddy stays in place without realizing that his teammates backed away.
"Oh, It's okay." Harry nods.
"A wonderful morning for a game, don't you think, professor?" McGonagall arrives next to him. Not surprised to see her there, she was a Gryffindor head and a huge Quidditch enthusiast. Maybe she'll give the magic points to Gryffindor if the world really wants to kick his ass.
"Yes, it was!"
"Now what did you do Hav?" Evan raises his head between his peers with a smile that Draco wouldn't describe as a good omen, mainly because Haven being late for a rehearsal this excited couldn't mean anything good.
He asks nothing to go wrong and everything will go to hell.
With uncertain steps Draco goes to the couch where Harry's sitting and sits on his legs, letting his knees rest on the couch and placing his greatest weight on Potter's knees.
"I don't know if she's my face, or my body, or my smell." He raises an arm to his nose to smell himself. "Maybe I still smell like my grandmother's perfume, I know that's why no one approached me before the sixth year, Shit! Ginny told me, and I ignored her, I deserve all this misery."
"Don't talk to me like that, asshole," he bluffs. "Tell me how long I've been here because I need to leave as soon as possible."
"Neville said it bothered you that Ron was here."
"My parents will kill me. My- my sister would be ashamed of me if she... knew."
A couple of movements and spells with his wand and green streamers decorate the fireplace in front of them, an enormous green tree completely decorated and other things that make the place look more in keeping with the dates.
"Uh." Draco didn't expect that. Clears his throat and looks away... embarrassed? "Yeah, thanks, well... they played well too."
"Kirley Duke's guitar solo far outperforms Heathcote Barbary's," says Neville, clapping his hands across the table.
The woman watches him as if he were a strange creature. "We cannot expel them unless there is visible physical violence, Professor Malfoy."
"Fuck it, I want to go out." Draco twists around staggering in the attempt, Potter is there to hold him just in time. And he pulls him away. "Leave me alone, Potter."
But Harry turns to him at that moment, neither of them move and they are at a dangerous distance that he cannot break because like the fire in the middle of winter it's mesmerizing and those emerald eyes that shine like crystals invite him and Draco wants, really wants to touch those thick lashes that fall majestically, as pretty as Granger's or Pansy's when she was putting on makeup with her mother's cosmetics.
"Lily? She was a beast, especially when it came to James "look at him, he's an idiot, I wish he would stop following me" and then he would entangle her feet with a spell."
Neville opens the door, the noise hits them abruptly. Harry's startled by the sudden appearance, but Draco doesn't even laugh when he sees him jump in place.
"Oh, go to hell."
"Good." He nods satisfied. "Now come on, my next class has almost started."
Draco wrinkles his nose. "McGonagall said she'll take care of them. She asked me to go to rest."
"Hey, are you busy?" He question. Neville shrugs and no, he really isn't doing anything more than ignoring one of his friends. "I finished my last class and didn't want to go back to my room."
They all go back to their rooms amid murmurs and curses that they think Draco can't hear, but he does. And his words are so silly that they don't even bother him. Lives a life as an Ex-Death Eater and he've heard worse than "blood traitor."
"I needed to time with myself, it's been the eighteen most screwed up hours of my life," he groans. "At least, the romantic one."
Children laugh preparing the spoons to finish the potion. Draco closes his eyes with force praying for no one to explode anything and that nobody is wrong because otherwise they would have to bathe in dragon mucus.
And then it marked him forever.
"I won't even tell you I told you," he says with a humorous look, "but yeah, I told you." Neville mutters something that sounds like go to hell, but ignores it. "Go to my living room after the second hour and I'll make you something."
