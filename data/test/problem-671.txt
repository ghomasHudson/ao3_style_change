His voice was cold, void of emotion. “I didn’t think things could get worse. This makes things so much worse.”
His eyes filled with sympathy. It wasn’t a look she was used to seeing on his face. Usually they just joked around and teased each other. It felt like she was seeing a new side of him. “Shit, Pans, I’m so sorry.”
“Bloody hell these chairs are uncomfortable,” Draco complained. “They give my arse pins and needles.”
"Fine Potter. I don't really care." What had his panties in a twist? Harry wondered to himself. He made eye contact with Pansy who mouthed, tell you later.
He burst into Slytherin common room and his housemates immediately crowded around them. After ten or so minutes of having passed around the broom Harry went to sit with his friends by the fire.
“To take a shower.” Draco got down two mugs from the cabinet and set the kettle over the burner to boil.
The food was good and the music was even better. Later on in the night when his feet hurt and his cheeks were sore from laughing and smiling so much he went to get him and Pansy drinks. There was nothing alcoholic of course but there was a bowl of punch at a table with goblets nearby.
After numerous tries only Draco, out of the four of them, had been successful in fully transforming the owl into opera glasses. Harry’s still had owl eyes for lenses, Pansy’s still had talons and Theo’s were feathered. It was hard going a whole class without joking around with Draco and smiling at him.  There’d been one moment where they made eye contact when Harry had nearly completely succeeded, the sole flaw being that the lenses were tinted yellow, and he’d looked up to Draco in excitement. When he’d looked into the other boys eyes they were full of pride and Harry’s chest had swelled with happiness before reality caught up to him and he’d hastily looked away.
He looked worried, how brown creased. “This might not be my place so you know I’m sorry if this is intrusive but you looked upset reading that letter down in the common room.”
“What? What is it woman?” Theo looked at Pansy with wide eyes as he held his wand at the tip of the joint between his lips.
Draco was sitting up in bed, reading a book, but he looked up when Harry spoke to him. “Er- This summer? I think? I’m not totally sure. Why?”
“Why didn’t you tell me you could talk to snakes?” Draco asked. He wasn’t sure how he felt that Harry had kept such a big secret from him.
“Shut up, Pansy.” Draco looked at Harry, suddenly looking very timid. “Well Potter, do you like it?”
Draco sunk further into the pillows he had propped up behind him to support his back while he’d been reading. “I’m not sure,” he confessed, voice barely above a whisper.
Draco tried to keep his eyes away from Harry but they kept wandering. “This game is boring, let's play something else.” He racked his brain. “Never have I ever?”
That year for the Holidays Pansy came up to Malfoy Manor with them. It was nice to be around friends, he needed their presence to distract him from all the bad things going on. The Malfoy’s always went over the top with decorations, trees with differently colour schemed ornaments to match nearly every room, plenty of good food and Harry made sure to watch out for the enchanted mistletoe.
"Oh shut up you two." Pansy sipped at her tea and tossed her curtain of long black hair over her shoulder. "You bicker like an old married couple."
Harry nodded and glanced over in Draco's direction. His face was twisted up into a sour expression. Harry wanted to ask what was wrong but not with Blaise still around.
His nightmares however left him tired every morning, he never felt well rested anymore and his face had started to look sickly pale. One night he woke with a scream. He rolled out of bed, his sheets damp with his sweat. Pacing the room Harry tried to calm himself down. “It’s only a nightmare, it’s only a nightmare, it isn’t real.” But he couldn’t get the big black dog, Black’s screaming face (that seemed to be unavoidable at the front of every copy of the Daily Prophet) or his mother’s begging voice out of is head.
“Been a bit boring. Tonight ought’a be interesting though, eh?” The boy said, an impish grin on his face.
“I’d fuck her,” Theo grinned, making Harry crack up harder so he leaned into Draco’s shoulder. Part of Draco wanted to push him away for being so crude but another part liked having Harry pressed up against his side, found the pressure reassuring.
“I think we should sleep on it,” offered Pansy. “Talk about it more tomorrow when we all have clear heads.”
Harry ended up receiving a joke set of wizards chess from Theo, a hair potion from Blaise (“to at least attempt to tame that birds nest you call hair,” Blaise told him), a Chudley Cannons jersey from Ron and from Hermione he got a talking diary that says, “Do it today or later you’ll pay!” From Sirius and Remus Harry received “Practical Defense Magic and its Use Against The Dark Arts” and a luxey eagle quill and bottle green dress robes from the Malfoys.
Once they were mostly hidden behind the greenhouses, Harry mounted his broomstick. He hadn't actually had a class yet since his first one had been cancelled due to rain. Draco however hadn't stopped talking about Quidditch and riding a broom and Harry figured he had the general gist of it. He managed to kick off the ground well enough, as did Draco seconds later. Harry's stomach flipped around at first as he adjusted to the new sensation of not having his feet planted to the ground. It wasn't long before excitement washed away his nerves and he pulled the front of his broom up to go higher.
Harry’s face was close enough that Draco could feel each exhalation on his face. The other boy always looked so peaceful when he slept. Innocent. Trying to be quiet and careful, Draco started to untangle their legs because he desperately had to use the lavatory. The motion must’ve woken Harry though because the next thing Draco knew the other boy was squinting up at him.
Unable to deal with this at the moment Harry sped up so they wouldn’t have to walk to class together. If Draco wanted to be a baby, fine. Let him.
The night of the Malfoy Christmas party the three of them all fell into Draco’s bed, tipsy and exhausted. The drapes had been pulled closed and the room was full of a warm glow, created by the countless candles lit on every flat surface.
He pulled his hand out from between hers and wrapped his arms around himself. “But what do I tell my parents?”
A couple times Harry saw Draco dancing with Claudette, spinning her around on the dance floor so her dress twirled up. When this happened he’d pull Pansy closer and whisper something funny in her ear.
Pansy pulled back from Theo and pulled Harry and Draco into an equally tight embrace. “It’s so good to see my boys! I’ve missed you all so much, the summer felt so long being apart from you all for so many weeks. Blaise and Adam are already inside, c’mon in.”
Little did Harry know but the way he himself was looking made Draco’s insides liquify. It was evident, so crystal clear, much much they meant to one another.
“Can’t we just stay in bed five more minutes?” Harry moaned pitifully, pulling the duvet up to his chin.
Draco couldn’t figure out what Harry was avoiding him for. What did he have to be upset about? Was he actually homophobic? He’d said he didn’t care that Draco was gay but that didn’t seem to be true. Draco had thought their friendship was stronger than that, surely this couldn’t be the end for them.
Narcissa looked away from the girl and back to Dumbledore. “Where are they. I demand to see them at once.”
“I’m coming. End of discussion. What’s the plan?” Harry sucked on the inside of his cheek. He hadn’t gotten that far. “Of course you don’t have one.” Draco rolled his eyes and scoffed.  “Good thing I already do.”
They continued bickering about Lockharts teaching qualifications until they reached the landing where the Gryffindor’s would go up the stairway to their dormitory and the Slytherin’s would go down. “Hey Harry,” Ron said. Draco watched his friend turn to face the redhead. “You’re playing Ravenclaw in a couple weeks, right?”
"Would you like to?" Draco offered. Harry's eyes left the rolling fields and turned to him. He nodded. "There are four of them. Four houses. In your first year you get sorted. You stay in that house for your seven years of schooling. In a way your house is like your team. You can win and lose points, you're tight with them, it's where you make all your closest friends." Draco knew he was rambling, probably not making much sense, the way Harry's piercing green eyes watched him made him nervous. "But anyway, the four houses, they all stand for certain values-"
“I’m gonna sneak down to the green houses to see if there’s anything I can get high off of in there,” said Theodore, pushing off from the sofa and heading out of the common room. “I’ll see y’all at dinner.”
Harry surged forward and before Blaise could restrain him again he pounced on the other boy. It was mostly because Aldrich wasn't expecting it that Harry managed to get in a good blow. His knuckles throbbed and Harry swore loudly. However, this didn't hold him back from attempting to throw another punch at Aldrich when he came at him. But before he could the other boy slugged him in the stomach and the air was knocked out of Harry's lungs. As he stumbled back adrenaline started coursing through his veins and a steely calm settled over him. Harry straightened up and swung his fist at Aldrich. His fist slammed into the boy's face and he heard a satisfying crack.
Professor McGonagall looked sick. “Ginevra Weasley.” Beside him Ron made a gagging noise, Harry clamped a hand over his mouth, but it seemed the Professors were  so absorbed in their conversation that they hadn’t heard.
Theo pulled back and stared at Pansy, giving into one more kiss, before he booked it in the direction of his own class. Harry and Blaise laughed. Just then there was a commotion in front of them. Pansy’s ex, Aldrich, materialized out of the swarm of buzzing students. Pansy’s face soured the moment she saw him and Harry’s heart sunk. The look on Aldrich’s face was full of intention.
Theo was particularly miserable to be around for the last week of summer. He spent the days by himself instead of with them, wandering aimlessly around the house, sulking, leaving rooms when others came in.
“Fine,” Harry grumbled, already missing the feel of Draco wrapped around him. “I just have to get my coat from the dorms.”
Harry snorted as he laughed and cried at the same time. “Yeah, who’d have thought?” He said, self deprecating, rolling his eyes at himself.
“Hey, Draco, look at me,” Pansy says, small fingers at his chin gently turn his face towards hers. He can’t help but meet her eyes and that just makes this harder. Her eyes are full of so much sympathy and understanding. Draco doesn’t understand that because she doesn’t even know what’s going on. He’s terrified because what if he tells her and she never looks at him like that ever again. What if he tells her and her expression changes to disgust, what if he tells her and she never looks at him without anything except contempt ever again.
Harry watched him out of the corner of his eye the whole night, while he and Pansy made rounds together (talking to powerful influential witches and wizards), all throughout dinner, all the way up until the party was over and they headed up to bed.
Harry was incredibly grumpy and the school year at barely begun. First the Dementors had attacked the train and he’d embarrassingly fainted, thank goodness Professor Lupin had been there to help. Divination was a joke, Professor Trelawney had already decided he was going to die as his tea leaves had shown the figure of what the woman had called the Grim. What shook Harry up most about this was that the Grim was the shape of a big black dog, like the one he’d seen when he’d run away… but no. It couldn’t be. Trelawney was bat crazy, that’s what everyone said. Even Hermione. Then Professor Lupin hadn’t let him partake in his class, the only one Harry was genuinely interested in, dismissing the Boggart for him. (Though Harry had forgiven him after Lupin had explained that he’d thought the Boggart would turn into Lord Voldemort) Despite this Defence Against the Dark Arts was his favorite class and Professor Lupin was his favourite teacher. He was passionate and clever.
Theo shrank into himself. “Sorry, that’s just what everyone’s saying in the great hall.” He turned to Harry. “We don’t care if you are by the way. It’d be pretty cool actually.”
Seeing this Pansy huffed and grit her teeth but kept her mouth shut. To soothe her Harry kissed her forehead. Pansy lifted her legs and put them over Harry’s. like they’d done since pretty much first year.
He’d thought he’d meant something to Draco. He’d thought maybe the other boy had felt at least a fraction for him of what he felt for Draco. Apparently not.
“Shhh!” Harry hushed him aggressively and squeezed his eyes shut. Not two seconds later the infirmary doors burst open and a the sound of numerous pairs of scuffling feet could be heard. Draco kept his head down but his eyes open, Harry peeked open an eye and they shared a look of confusion.
“That’s the one.” Draco tried not to let his deep annoyance and frustration with his best friend show, gritting his teeth through his forced smile.
That was enough to make Draco close his book all the way. Harry wasn’t sure why that made him so happy to have Draco’s full and undivided attention. “My brand?”
so that's all of second year in one chapter. it's longer than the last few chapters by a lot because it's one long chapter instead of split up. do you guys prefer shorter chapters more frequently or longer chapters slightly less often?
“Ah! Tu parle français? Ton accent est charmant!” (ah! you speak french? your accent is lovely!) the girl exclaimed. Harry had no idea what she was saying whatsoever but her whole face lit up as her and Draco blathered on for the rest of the meal.
Harry chuckled and leaned back against the rug. Close enough that his leg touched Draco’s. He liked that the other boy didn’t pull away. It was probably just because of the whiskey, Harry reasoned.
Harry vaguely remembered hearing Draco mention them. "It's a position in Quidditch, right?  Chase something called a snitch? A little gold ball or something?"
Harry shook his head. “It doesn’t make up for anything because witches and wizards who aren’t purebloods aren’t lacking. Look at Hermione for example, both her parents are muggles and she’s a better student than any of us.”
He felt a tug of arousal in his stomach and closed his eyes, willing it to go away. Harry looked up and made eye contact with Draco. Panic spiked through his chest and he stood, throwing down his cards, he muttered something about being sick before leaving his friends to stare after him.
“Pardon?” His breathing was shallow, was Griffin getting closer? He couldn’t remember ever being this close to another person's face.
Harry ran his fingers through his boyfriend’s silky soft hair. “You know I’m going to need it back for our game tomorrow.”
“If you come back inside with me now I’ll get Dobby to make us treacle tart,” Draco said, stamping his feet to try and warm them up.
“That’s not his job though, is it? To have soft hair and smile?” Blaise frowned. “His job is to teach us.”
When he woke up Harry wasn’t in bed. Panic swelled in Draco’s gut but settled back down when he saw Harry standing in the middle of the room.
Harry had never spent much time in the library at the manor but he remembered Draco showing it to him a couple years ago and sometimes he’d go with Draco to fetch another book he wanted to read. When he got there the door was open a couple inches. He pushed it open the rest of the way but saw nothing. Harry was about to start searching the first floor when he heard a faint thump from up above. When he started up the stairs and began to hear other sounds. Sounds he recognized and that filled him with a looming sense of dread but he had to see for himself.
Narcissa had just finished removing her lightweight fur lined coat when she turned to face her son. “Calm down, I did darling.” From the folds of her robes she produced a corked bottle. “You can ingest it or spread it on the area but according to the witch I bought it from doing both will result in a more rapid healing.”
The Yule Ball was a splendid affair. Everything was of the theme of a shimmering magical snowfall in the Great Hall. Glittering white crystal icicles hung from the ceiling, sparkling white lights draped around columns, glowing orbs hung in mid air.
“It could take us ages to find though,” Hermione argued. “Who knows how many attacks there will have been by then.”
The first brush of their lips was gentle, hesitant. Harry gasped softly, his mouth fell open, lips parting. Draco’s tongue dragged across his lower lip and heat blossomed in Harry’s chest. Their kissing grew deeper and deeper, sending delicious shudders through him. He tasted like rain and salty tears. Goosebumps broke out across his skin. Harry gave himself up to Draco’s hot opening lips. The way he kissed drove every last thought from Harry’s head.
Harry nodded. That made sense. And besides, wisdom? Courage? Harry didn't feel like he had much of either of those qualities. "Yeah, sounds alright."
“My head is spinning.” Draco leaned back completely and lay down on the floor. He grunted and pulled a shoddy looking gift, at least compared to the others they'd so far unwrapped, out from under his head. “What’s this, it’s got you name on it Harry?”
“I think my poor mother nearly had a heart attack when both of you came down in your boxers,” Draco told them, looking at Harry, an affectionate glint in his eyes.
Students and teachers were gathering, staring at them, whispering and pointing at the message on the wall behind them.
Scorching hot jealousy burned through his chest every time he remembered the sight. It was all he could think about. Griffin using his body to press Draco up against the bookshelf, Griffins hands up Draco’s shirt, Griffins lips on Draco’s neck, on his lips.
“Is there anything you’re excited to get?” Harry asked him when they were almost done and Draco still hadn’t shown a sliver of happiness about a single gift.
Harry made to turn away. "You too, Mister Potter. That thumb of yours looks to me like it's broken.” Her voice softened, “And Miss Parkinson?” McGonagall hesitated. “Come with me"
Harry crossed his arms across his chest protectively, feeling vulnerable. “It’s ridiculous. I have to get over him.”
He turned to see Draco apparently doing the same thing as him, getting drinks. But when he saw Draco he froze, there was red lipstick marks all over his face. Something burned in his gut.
“I can’t believe I passed Divination,” Blaise said, following. “I barely did the homework for that class it was utter rubbish.”
“I would have borrowed sweats if you’d leant them to me!” Harry protested. Pansy lifted the end of her duvet and Harry shifted over so his lower half was warm.
She raised her face from the floor, eyes glistening. “No, I do, of course I do. It’s Theodore fucking Nott. How could I not like him back?!”
Draco rolled his eyes at his friends but got up from where he was sitting. “Fine. If it’ll make you quit your bitching and moaning. Let’s go.”
Pansy startled and looked up from the letter, her head whipping around. Theodore was leaning on the back of the chair, his chin propped on his folded arms. Hurriedly she shoved her parents letters out of sight. To look at him she had to twist around in her chair.
“First of all, stop waving your arms around I can’t paint them when you’re gesturing weirdo. Secondly, I do not have a bad bitch vibe.”
Pain wrenched through him as the tears in Draco’s eyes fell. “You know I am, Draco. Why would you think I’m not?’
If you’re disappointed I suppose I understand. Not about my homosexuality but because your son is not the person you thought he was. The last fifteen years you’ve raised someone who isn’t exactly who you thought him to be.
“I’m not glaring.” Harry turned his eyes down to his mashed potatoes and angrily shoved a forkful into his mouth.
Griffin chuckled, it was a nice sound. “There’s no need to be polite. I know my mother gets carried away and rambles sometimes.”
He curled his fingers into his bed cover, fisting the sheets. “I don’t know yet okay! Please just stop!” He exploded. He couldn’t help it. All the bottling up he’d done, that he had to continue to do, it was too much. “You can’t tell me for sure that he’d accept this part of me and I can’t lose him. So until I’m sure, no, I probably won’t tell him.”
Harry’s mood was greatly improved when he received a Firebolt for Christmas. Draco was weird about it at first, especially as they ruled out all the possible people it could have been from. (Most certainly not the Dursleys, not Dumbledore, he wouldn’t spend hundreds of Galleons on Harry and not Professor Lupin, if he’d had that much money he’d probably spend it on better robes)
Refusing to be put off by the teasing Draco countered, “Hey handsome.” When he went to close the compartment door Harry sat up all the way.
Draco wasn’t sure how to reply. “We’ll get through it. You will. I’m here for you, I’m always here for you.”
“Definitely not. I think you’ll be extraordinary.” Harry stared at him. “As a teacher,” Draco added. “Extraordinary as a teacher.”
“No, but it can travel through the pipes.” They all sat in a stunned silence as they absorbed the information.
Harry grinned and winked before dashing down to the slytherin dormitory. He couldn’t help the mad grin on his face as he whipped around corners and took the stairs two at a time. Draco made him entirely too happy.
He pushed his boyfriend away before things could escalate in front of their friends. “Stop making everyone stand around and take your turn,” he said with no real bite behind his words. Harry winked, a smug look on his face that sent a thrill through Draco.
“Cheer up, Harry,” Pansy told him, throwing her legs up over his. “What’s that?” she asked, pointing out the train window. Draco got up and opened it and a little owl flew in, landing in Harry’s lap. There was a letter addressed to him in the birds talons. Taking it and ripping it open he read:
Harry had his back to Draco when he walked in but he turned at the sound of the door opening. Harry’s eyes went round at the sight of him, his mouth fell into a small o. He was dressed in his quidditch jersey, the sleeves pushed to his elbows, dark jeans and converse. His damp hair was a mess. The sight of him made Draco’s heart hurt.
“Au moins tu as l’air bonne dedans, beau gosse.” (roughly translated : at least you look hot in it, hunk)
She watched as they hauled their trunks up into the train as they disappeared out of her line of sight. Little did she know that she would be seeing them sooner than expected.
Harry opened his eyes and made eye contact with Pansy. He knew without having to ask that Draco had also come out to her. It wasn’t their place to say anything though.
Things had been awful between them ever since Harry had caught him making out with Griffin pushed up against a bookshelf in the library. He’d tried to go after Harry but the other boy had gone to the guest room and bolted the door shut, refusing to talk to him. Since then Draco had tried numerous times to explain but Harry was never alone and he only ever talked to him indirectly when the others were around. It was infuriating.
Harry’s brow creased as he rubbed the back of his neck and winced. “Because I’m not pureblood? Because I’m not top of the class like you? I don’t know there are so many reasons.”
Harry bemed as McGonagall removed the hat from his head. The Slytherin table had erupted from their seats, cheers echoed through the Great Hall as Harry joined his housemates.
There were more attacks. Nearly headless Nick, a Hogwarts ghost, and a student, Justin Finch-Fletchley, the boy who’d cried out at Harry in the great hall when the whole of Hogwarts had realised that Harry was a Parselmouth.
Harry roared with laughter. “This is too good,” he said once he’d calmed down enough to talk, putting down Hedwig and his trunk he wiped a tear from the corner of his eye.
He averts his eyes from hers. His eyes catch on a moving photo Harry has beside his bed of the three of them. They’re laughing. What if Pansy tells Harry? What if Harry’s disgusted? But he can’t just not tell them anymore. They’re his best friends.
Just as Harry was losing hope with both the Anti-Dementor lessons things started to look up just a bit.
“Muggles are so funny,” Draco said to Harry. “They strap these pieces of wood to their feet and launch themselves down snow-covered mountains because they claim that it’s fun. You know, some strap both feet to one piece of wood. What’s the name for that again?”
She spotted Dumbledore standing at the end of the hall, outside the doors of the infirmary with a young girl with long balck hair who looked to be around Harry and Draco’s age.
Theo met her stare, face blank, scanning hers to see how serious she was. Then his face split into an impish grin. “Can they be yellow?”
“Trust me, I don’t like it either,” Harry said, “but he’s got a plan which is more than we can say. Now come on we’ve got to hurry. We don’t have much time.”
Draco wouldn’t let Harry be taken out of his eyesight even once he was settled in a bed and Madam Pomfrey reassured him Harry would be fine. He was reminded of the end of First Year when Harry had been brought in after defeating the Dark Lord and Draco had spent hours sitting with him until he’d woken up. Now they were back in the infirmary and Harry was unconscious again, Draco in a chair at his bedside. That’s where he fell asleep.
The next couple weeks were a whirlwind of classes and making out with Pansy. He and draco weren’t exactly fighting but they weren’t really talking either. He got a letter from Sirius which brightened his mood but whenever he saw Draco with Claudette he got angry all over again. Hormones. It was just shifting hormones. Teenage boys typically got angry over stupid stuff because of testosterone and shit, right?
“Parselmouth.” Draco heard the word repeated through the great hall. He couldn’t take it anymore. He stood from his spot at the Slytherin table and walked down between the tables until he’d reached Harry. Snagging his hand he pulled the other boy from the great hall and down to the Slytherin dorms.
Draco looked out the window. This was exactly the reason why he’d wanted to find another compartment, this conversation. Well, the displays of affection as well but he really didn’t want to be here while they talked about the progression of their relationship.
“Fuck you,” Theo muttered, filling his glass and taking a shot. “Never have I ever had a crush on a teacher.”
Draco dropped his quill, clenched his hands into fists and squeezed his eyes shut. No. The thought of them being that revolted by him was too painful. He was their son. Their only son. His father bragged about him to family friends and colleagues and teased him with affection in his eyes. They had inside jokes and made faces at each other behind his mother's back when she was going off and not looking at them. His mother gave the best hugs and spoke of him with such pride to guests. She soothingly stroked his hair back from his face when he was stressed or sick and gossiped with him about her pompous self-absorbed ‘friends’. They went out for family dinners and had tea and brunch and cocktail parties together. They played polo and board games and had puzzle nights.
There was another knock and Draco’s door and they startled apart. “Guests will be here soon!” His mother called out.
Harry turned to see the girl enter in a deep red gown a tight bodice that accentuated her curves and modest neckline. Her jewellery was big and shiny with large black gemstones glistening at their centres. Her dark hair was swept back in a high ponytail. Claudette had rouge on her cheeks, making them look flushed, and red lipstick.
Draco nodded and looked away, using Harry’s gift to him as an excuse to avoid eye contact. Butterflies gathered in harry’s stomach. What if Draco didn’t like what he’d gotten him? How could he possibly top the things Draco had gotten him? He honestly didn’t think it was possible. But then Draco was opening the gift and smiling up at him and the butterflies in Harry’s stomach doubled.
Then she was kissing him. It felt....wet. Warm. This was his first. He’d always worried it would be gross and sticky or that he wouldn’t know what to do. This was nice. The music and the way their lips moved against each other lulled him into a fuzzy state and he lost track of everything else.
“It was pretty alright,” Blaise said, sinking into his seat and opening a thick, leather bound book.
“You read one letter. There were quite a few others you didn’t read and without them you’ve missed a lot and jumped to assumptions that are quite incorrect. I wrote back Clemonte saying I was flattered but didn’t feel the same way. Did you read the letter where he wrote back saying if I’d only give him a chance he was sure he could make me fall for him? Or the one where I wrote back saying I’d already fallen for someone else?”
“It’s for his own good.” Narcissa watched her boys laughing.  “Surely you want what’s best for Harry.”
“Have you replaced Draco with Weasley?” When Harry didn’t answer she tried a different approach. “You’re going to have to forgive him at some point,” Pansy sighed, slouching into a plush sofa by the fire. It was late and there was no one else in the common room.
Pansy laughed wetly as tears slipped down her cheeks. “You know Theodore I’m here for you too. I know I’m just the uptight bossy bitch who goes off on you about getting high but I care about you being happy too.” She pulled him into a hug and wrapped her arms around his shoulders, firm beneath her touch. He held on to her tightly and Pansy closed her eyes. Theodore was a steady comforting presence and she felt more solidly anchored now, breathing in his weirdly comforting blend of lemony fresh shampoo and cigarette smoke clinging to his clothes, than she had in a long time.
She cupped his face in her hands, pushing his hair out of his eyes. “Don’t be sorry, silly! Why would you be sorry?”
Mrs Malfoy gazes at him, perplexed before a look of determination settles across her features. “It’s alright, darling, we’ll get that taken care of. As soon as Dobby is done with the treacle tart we’ll send him to buy you some.” Harry tried to protest but Mrs Malfoy wouldn’t hear it.
Nectarine juice trickled into Draco’s palm and Harry stared as the other boy finished the fruit before proceeding to lick the juice from his lips and palm then sucking on each of his sticky fingers.
Harry stared at the parchment a bit longer but still didn’t understand. Were they pulling his leg? “I don’t get it. It’s just a bit of old parchment.”
“See you!” Harry turned to face Draco as they made their way to charms. “Hey, what’s new and interesting?”
Harry thought he might be sick as the fat little man groveled at Black and Lupin’s feet. He began to shake when Pettigrew approached him and his friends, trying to win their sympathy. He was disgusted and almost didn’t stop Black when  he stepped forward to kill Pettigrew. But he did, and he told them they could take the shrivelled excuse of a man to the Dementors to receive the kiss, have his soul sucked from his body.
Harry crawled in first, sliding over to one end, and Draco followed, taking the other end. The smell of Draco surrounded him immediately. He pulled the duvet up higher and stretched his legs, with a satisfied sigh. Harry took a deep breath, exhaling slowly. He was already starting to feel much calmer.
He watched Harry’s face shift around as he came to the same realisation Draco had a moment previously. The process of realisation was interesting to watch unfold. Draco decided to end the other boys misery and turned around from his mirror to face him.
“The what now?” asked Harry. The girl asking was obviously from Beauxbatons. Her french accent was thick and he’d never once in his life heard of the dish she’d asked him to pass.
Harry didn’t want to but when Draco was putting on that voice and looking at him that way he couldn’t help but blush. “You’re ridiculous.”
Even after all that, to cap it all off, Harry fainted when the Dementors interfered during the first Quidditch match. It would have been bad enough, fainting in front of everyone because of the Dementors, if only his broom hadn’t blown away in the storm and been smashed into a dozen bits of wood and twig, totally unrepairable. He’d also seen the silhouette of an enormous shaggy balck dog imprinted against the sky at the top of the Quidditch stands. This was the second time he’d seen the Grim. And the sound of his mothers begging voice haunted him. The sound of her begging Voldemort not to kill him. His nightmares were worse than ever.
They both leapt from their chairs, letting the blankets they’d had wrapped around them fall to the snow covered balcony. Snow flew. Sometime later, Draco pushed himself up off the ground, where he’d collapsed exhausted. “I’m going to go make some hot chocolate. Want some?”
“You can’t go back to bed here, I’m not letting you sleep in these sheets. Come on,” Draco said to Harry, turning to leave the room. Too tired to argue, Harry followed, wearily. His eyes itched he was so sleep deprived.
Draco shook his head and kept going in the direction of the dining room. When they reached the end of the hall they nearly ran into Pansy who was walking with Blaise, who both automatically caught on that they were fighting.
the one that's 20k words long so strap in for a long one. go to the bathroom, grab a snack, don't start it if it's too late and you have to wake up early. kissing statues, truth or dare, cuff links, two original characters, jealousy, confessions and a gratuitous nectarine scene
“Alright, alright, calm down, Pans.” Theo put away the plastic bag and took out a carton of cigarettes instead.
annoyed because i can't figure out how to keep the italics i applied to certain sentences when i write the chapters in google docs -_-
Draco shook his head as if he were being forced to converse with a stubborn two year old asking ridiculous questions. Harry changed into the bottle green dress robes and looked at himself from all angles in a large mirror. He picked at his sleeves and frowned. Trudging to Draco’s room down the hall he knocked on the door. Without waiting for an answer he walked in.
“Fuck.” Harry rubbed at his eyes and tear stained cheeks, his glasses getting in the way. He hated the look in her eyes. The pity.
“No one,” Draco answered too quickly for it to be believable. Harry didn’t want to push him though because the topic seemed to be making Draco uncomfortable. The other boys didn’t seem to care, or maybe they just didn’t notice his discomfort in the first place.
“Has the headcount come back yet? The Head boys and girls of each house did attendance did they not? Who did the monster take?” asked Madam Pomfrey.
Harry attempted to think of all the reasons he shouldn’t like Draco but instead all his brain seemed to want to do was the opposite, come up with all the reasons he did like Draco. It went a little something like this : his stupidly soft hair, his sharp witty sarcastic comebacks, he speaks french and it’s hot, his sleepy smiles when it’s late at night, the way his laugh sounds when he’s just woken up, he gets cuddly when he’s sleepy and it’s ridiculously cute, his need to give random expensive gifts out of the blue for no reason other than he just wants to, the way he looks in a suit or dress robes makes him an unfair amount of handsome, he was brilliantly smart and even the way they bickered. The list was endless.
When Timothy and Gabriel, the last of Harry’s teammates, left the change room Draco caught the door as it was closing and slipped through, impatient with waiting.
Draco wanted to argue that it was actually because it was the colour of Harry’s eyes but kept his mouth shut. He didn’t need to go exposing himself like that, even if imagining the looks on his friends faces made him think maybe it would be worth it. “Truth or dare, Zabini?”
Draco had never had so much trouble writing a letter before in his entire life. He’d restarted it more times than he wanted to acknowledge. He stared down at the blank parchment, quill hovering. Draco genuinely had no clue how his parents would respond to the news, making him almost not want to write the letter at all. What they didn’t know wouldn’t hurt them, and in turn hurt him, right?
Harry’s expression hardened. “Someone got taken down into the chamber and we’re going to get them out.”
Harry avoided Draco for the rest of the Winter Break as much as possible. He berated himself because deep down he knew he had no reason to be upset with Draco. The other boy hadn’t done anything wrong. The only problem was that every time they were in the same room together it made it even harder to not imagine Draco and the Clemonte boy sucking face. The memory made him unreasonably angry, made him want to break something. So Harry avoided Draco. Pansy asked him one time if he wanted to talk about what was wrong but Harry had insisted everything was fine.
“What are you going to do to him?” Ron demanded from the bed, his face twisted in pain from his probably broken leg.
“Now here we have something different,” Harry whispered to Pansy. They’d reached two massive, intricately carved gold doors with potted plants on either side of the doors.
He liked Draco. He, Harry James Potter, liked Draco. Draco Malfoy. He groaned loudly. This could only end in disaster. He tried to think of something, anything else. However, his brain was noncompliant.
Of course actions spoke louder than words so while the letters were a good start Harry was really waiting to see if Draco’s behavior would change. Harry hoped it would. He didn’t want to be angry with his best friend anymore.
Draco felt a flutter of pride in his chest at his best friends skill but crushed it promptly.  Harry had been avoiding him for, what was it now? Had it really been almost two months?
But Harry started back down the way they’d come. Draco pinched the bridge of his nose and huffed a sigh before chasing after his apparently mad best friend. They retraced their steps the way they came until Harry made a turn down a corridor on the second floor. The corridor was full of water, from an unused girls bathroom, Draco realised. Not looking where he was going, Draco walked into Harry. He was about to give Harry an earful for stopping so suddenly when he looked up and saw why. On the wall in a dripping red substance that looked an awful lot like blood, a message was written : "THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED. ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE. '' But what was even more terrifying was Mrs Norris, who looked like she was dead, was hanging by her tail from a torch bracket.
Pansy laughs, but it doesn’t sound malicious. He looks up at her, confused. “I kind of thought so,” she says, smiling softly, her face full of so much warmth it makes something in Draco’s chest throb with relief. She pulls him into a hug and he squeezes back, sinking into her embrace.
The night of the Malfoy Christmas dinner party Draco was almost ready when there was a knock at his bedroom door. He was only a little surprised to see Harry standing on the other side.
The noise level in the compartment got even louder as Theo and Harry guffawed and Pansy demanded an explanation. The sick feeling returned to Draco’s stomach.
“You seem eager.” She wasn’t really in the mood to do nails right now. She mostly just wanted to have to evening to wallow in self pity. Maybe a distraction was what she needed right now though? Not only that but despite his pot habits Pansy found that for some irrational reason she had a soft spot for Theodore. He often got on her nerves but he was rather charismatic and they’d known each other for ages.
“There’s no reason for you to sleep on a sofa, it’s big enough for both of us,” he said, stopping in front of the bed. “We’re best friends and as long as you don’t kick or talk in your sleep I don’t mind sharing.”
Draco knew that technically what Harry was saying was right but he didn’t like talking about blood purity because his whole childhood he’d been taught that purebloods were superior to other witches and wizards whose lineage was tainted with muggle blood. It made him feel uneasy, having everything he’d been taught corrected.
After the last month and a half of writing letters back and forth, Harry and Draco were back to normal. Things had been tense between them for awhile, even after defeating Voldemort/Tom Riddle together at the end of second year, because of their difference in opinion when it came to the importance of a witch or wizards blood status. Harry knew that Draco had been brought up his whole childhood being taught that witches and wizards with a pure magical bloodline were superior to those with muggle blood mixed into their lineage. Harry had also learned over the last two years of being best friends with the boy that Draco was a proud individual who had a hard time admitting that he was wrong. That was why Harry had believed Draco when he’d written to Harry acknowledging and apologizing for his close mindedness.
“I can’t like him! He’s my best friend!” She stared at him, expression blank. “Things would change between us!” Panic was rising up in him, he wiped at his forehead suddenly feeling hot. “Besides, I can’t tell him. He doesn’t like me back.”
Pansy paused whatever she was doing to Harry’s face to remove her bra (without removing her shirt and pulling it through her sleeve) and hand it over to Theo.
“We just got back from Zürich, Switzerland and my dumb ass decided not to wear sunscreen while we were there because I thought I was too good for it.”
His ears had instantly filled with the sound of the stands erupting with cheers. When he landed he was instantly swarmed by his teammates and pulled into a rib crushing embrace. He was so proud that all their hard work had paid off.
“Oh not you, Draco dear. I know you know what a skincare routine is but none of our other clueless friends do.”
As he pulled out the scarf a flurry of parchment came with it. Harry knelt and meant to shove the parchment back but the writing on it wasn’t Draco’s familiar neat cursive and it made him pause. He glanced over the parchment and quickly realized it was a letter. From Griffin Clemonte. His smile fell and his face hardened as he read it.
The next thing he knew he was bursting out through the barrier and staring at the gleaming Hogwarts Express. He couldn't help but be impressed. His attention was dragged away from the gleaming scarlet train when his Father clapped a hand across his back.
Draco averted his gaze and put down the powder before he turned from his reflection. His eyes danced around the room, then met Harry’s. “Didn’t we talk about this last year?” His voice had lost it’s chilly undertone.
Harry and Draco had shared an amused look. It was so like Pansy to wear outfits based off her mood regardless of the weather.
“You’re all nasty.” Blaise mimed vomiting. “Anyway, I wouldn’t recommend getting with her. I’d say the only one with any hope is Harry.”
For all our sakes, Pansy, Harry begged her in his head, please say it would be weird. Theo was staring daggers out the window and Harry worried he might shatter the glass.
After that Harry had someone managed to convince Professor Lupin to give him Anti-Dementor lessons starting the next term. With this promise he felt much more reassured, he couldn’t continue fainting because of the Dementors. It was embarrassing and inconvenient because no one else seemed to be as affected by them as he was.
“Shut up! Shut up for a minute!” Draco pressed the heels of his hands to his eyes, which were squeezed shut. “He’s not Slytherin’s heir.”
Harry started to protest but then he looked down at his hand to see that, sure enough, his right thumb was swollen and bruised.
Pansy tucked her hair behind her ears and pursed her lips, thinking. “This is why you guys aren’t talking right now isn’t it? That kiss?”
Harry picked up his sports bag from the bench and his broom that had been propped up against the wall. He shouldered passed Draco,  “Later-”
Harry and Draco waited in silence as the sounds of someone taking the camera from Creevey and opening it filled the room. Then came the sound of a small explosion. No photo than, Draco assumed.
“Maybe?” Harry wished Theo would just pull his shit together and ask Pansy out but then he thought that would be a bit hypocritical considering how long he’d gone without telling Draco how he felt. So he kept his mouth shut. He really didn’t have the time to be worrying about Pansy and Theo’s love lives. What he should have been thinking about was his appointment with Dumbledore that evening.
Harry was about to reply when he heard something. Frightened voices. “Hold on, do you hear that?” Up ahead there was hushed whispering. The boys sped up and peeked around the corner. Harry’s heart stopped beating in his chest. The first time there’d been an attack there’d been writing on the walls warning the school that the chamber had been reopened. Now there was another message. Harry read and reread it. He was having trouble breathing.
The second he made it to is room he slid down to the floor, back against the door. He buried his hands in his arms crossed over his knees.
"Aldrich called Pansy a slut, Professor!" Lavender Brown exclaimed, stepping forward from the crowd of gathered students at the scene.
They were well into their classes by now and fall wind danced through their hair and rippled through their clothes. They were out on the Quidditch grounds at lunch with a pair of broomsticks, sneaking around trying not to get caught since technically first years weren't supposed to ride broomsticks outside of classes.
It was nothing like kissing Pansy. Sure, it was still wet and warm but where Pansy was all soft skin and curves Draco was firm and tall. This was everything. Draco pulled back enough to lick at his jaw and kiss the tender skin of his neck. Harry moaned and felt the curve of Draco’s mouth as he smiled against Harry’s neck.
Two weeks before Christmas break there’d been another Hogsmeade trip, to everyone’s delight except Harry’s. That’s when Ron’s older brothers, mischievous twins of Hogwarts had pulled him aside.
“You really probably shouldn't miss classes,” Harry said, rubbing at his eyes. Merlin, he felt drained.
Blaise snorted as he chewed on a pumpkin pasty. “Lavender Brown is nutty though, she’s all into that Divination stuff.”
“Maybe in a little while it’ll go away? Merlin, I don’t know, this is so inconvenient,” Draco moaned, bringing a pillow over his face and resisting the urge to scream into it.
As they headed back, the sun lowered in the sky behind them, revealing inky indigo sky with shining stars. Draco could hear Theo tripping over his own feet all the way down the hill.
“You’ll read it for me first right?” Harry asked Draco. “Because we both love Pansy but we both know she knows fuck all about herbology.”
They all sat in pensive silence, none of them wanting to voice the other possibility. The possibility that Voldemort might get to him. Harry couldn’t meet the eyes of his friends. His insides were churning as he thought about his meetings with Dumbledore. They’d started in the fall, few and far apart. However, as the year had progressed they’d become more constant. Excuses had been hard to find. There were only so many detentions from McGonagall he could pretend to get, only so many extra Quidditch meetings he could make up. The things they’d been talking about, he and the old school master haunted his waking thoughts. The dark past of Tom Riddle and his transition into the Dark Lord he was today. His mind was awake and spinning all the time now. Full with thoughts about Horcruxes. He would have to tell his friends eventually. He would have to go after them. He and Dumbledore. Wouldn’t they? The old man hadn’t actually told him his plan yet but something would have to be done, soon. Harry already missed this. Missed Hogwarts, missed his friends, missed this calm before the storm. It might have been an uneasy time but the storm hadn’t struck yet. Harry knew that when it did there would be no calm for a long time after.
Harry walked out of the bathroom, wiped the corner of his mouth with the back of his palm, just finished brushing his teeth. He could see Draco out of the corner of his eye, already in bed, reading. Coming around to his side of the bed he chucked his (piss coloured) shirt to some far end of the room and shoved his pants down, letting them drop to the floor. Harry was in the middle of crawling under the covers when he froze, glancing up at Draco, doing a double take.
Draco shook his head as he went to work, cutting up and shredding ingredients. "You don't. It makes you stop hiccuping you idiot."
The air was crisp and the sun was nice, it was a fine day for Quidditch. He watched from above as his teammates roughed up Ravenclaw and scored again. The stands screamed and rumbled thunderously loud. Even from here, so high up,  Harry could see his friends. They were all decked out. Even Draco had face paint on. Slytherin was ahead by two scores but Harry knew that could change at any moment. Just then he spotted something gleaming out of the corner of his eye. Without thinking Harry swooped after the snitch. He lived for the thrill that ran through him when he next to free fell, with nothing supporting him but his broom. Wind whistled through his hair, pushing it back from his face as he dove. They were right up next to the stand, down near the base and nearing the ground fast. He knew Ravenclaws seeker was following him, gaining speed. He could also hear Lee Jordan making announcements to the crowd, but ignored the words.
While Adam was helping Pansy into a light summer jacket Harry overheard Blaise speak to Theo. “What was that about?” he whispered between his teeth.
Harry brushed her long hair back from her face. “I’m so sorry. If there’s anything I can do to make anything easier please promise you’ll let me know ?”
“Is that gel in your hair, Nott?” Draco asked. Harry squinted and sure enough Theo’s hair had a sheen to it, swept back in a way he’d never had it before.
Harry blinked hard, making himself look away. Turning to Pansy, feeling grumpy for seemingly no reason in particular, he grumbled, “Since when can Draco speak french?”
“Grow up-” Draco stopped talking the moment they entered the sitting room and saw that there were guests. Plural. There were multiple strangers.
What made him even more upset was that Pansy and Draco agreed! They all thought it was sent from Sirius Black as an attempt to jinx or hex him. To be fair it was probably the only half logical explanation as to where the broom came from but that didn’t mean Harry couldn’t be upset.
Theo laughed at their faces. “Well, yeah, I was trying to get someone to ask about it on the way to Hogwarts on the train but none of you did.”
“Nothing, Minerva. This has gone on for too long. The students must be sent home and the school must be shut down.”
Dinner was a semi awkward affair. The actual meal portion, the eating, was all fine and well. After however, was a slightly different matter.
“Well that’s unfortunate,” Blake said. “It feels weird to ask you on a date if you don't remember me at all. What do you think?”
It was a few nights before the third task and it was safe to say that Harry was stressed. He felt like he was going to come out of his skin. It was late and he was exhausted and he wanted to sleep so badly but couldn’t for the life of him. Harry had been irritated the last few days because he only managed to fall asleep hours past his roomates when it was as Blaise usually called the hours “the ass crack of dawn”. Ready to smother himself with a pillow a desperate idea came to mind. Theo, of course it had been Theo, had told him about how jerking off could help lower stress and relax. He’d heard the other boys do it behind their hangings some nights when they forgot a silencing charm. It didn’t seem like there was all that much to it.
“Yeah, now we can practice together.” Harry sat with his anxiety that Draco wouldn’t like it as the other boy only continued to stare at the broom, saying nothing.
He waved his hand in a dismissive gesture. “Don’t be sorry. I know you see me as an annoying git who you nag about not getting high but I’m always here for you, Pans.” He chuckled and Pansy’s cheeks warmed. “I know that sounds kinda cheesy but I’ve known you for what feels like forever and I want you to be happy. “ He peered at her from under his eyelashes, bashfully.
It was the anticipation that made him most anxious as he walked straight at the seemingly solid wall that would lead him to platform 9 and 3/4, not what lay beyond it. Draco told himself he wasn't anxious about a year spent away from home. He wasn't anxious about the sorting, or his housemates, the classes, or the teachers.
Around what was probably an hour later the common room was mostly empty. Pansy had thrown her legs over Harry's. He had protested at first but she had won in the end.
“Dunno,” said Harry. “ It’s probably something else that’s bothering him. I’ll go talk to him.” He pushed up from the sofa, meaning to follow after his friend.
“No. Pansy- please just stop? Don’t get my hopes up. If he liked me why was he making out with Clemonte? I just- I’ll get over it. I just need time.”
Harry spoke over him, “He wants you to come up to his villa in Italy for the summer! Do you know why? Well, that’s a dumb question of course you do. You’ve read the letter. You know he wants to court you. Do you think he’s already sat down for lunch with your father to as for your hand in marriage? Do you think he’s gone to tea with your mother to pick out the-”
Pansy snorted and Harry shook his head, lips pressed together tightly. "Thanks Malfoy I'm honoured," he scoffed.
Draco paused, seeming to consider his answer. With a soft sigh he said, “My parents went into hiding.”
Harry was trying to figure out if this was some sort of joke. “Who in their right mind decided Gilderoy Lockhart should be a Professor?’
“Okay, so Harry we were just talking. Who do you think the hottest girl in our year is?” Theo asked, tossing him a pack of sherbert lemons.
The night ended up being great fun because they had a few cups of eggnog, as they were making their rounds and talking to all the guests who’d come to the party, before they realised it contained alcohol. At this point they wandered up to Draco’s room to crash because they were feeling a mixture of tipsy and sleepy.
Pansy rolled her eyes but there was a smirk on her lips that told Harry she wasn’t disappointed with the attention.
“Why are you still avoiding me?” Draco’s voice cracked and something in Harry broke with it. But he couldn’t do this or he’d say something he’d regret saying.
“Draco, Mrs Clemonte will be coming for dinner this evening. She wanted to catch up during the holidays but since she couldn’t make the Christmas dinner due to her catching a terrible cold she wrote a letter saying she wanted to come over to this evening's dinner. It’s awfully last minute, I know, it’s lucky we didn’t already have plans,” he heard Mrs Malfoy say. “Please let your friends know not to come down to the dining room in their underwear for this meal.” Harry grimaced. He debated going in and apologizing.
Saying goodbye to her boys at the station was incredibly hard for Narcissa. Harder than saying goodbye at the start of the school year because now she had two boys to say goodbye to. Harry had somehow wormed his way into her heart. He was a sarcastic, charming young man and she liked the way he made Draco loosen up a bit. The memory of walking in on them curled up together in their silk pyjamas and wrapped in cloaks and surrounded by christmas gifts came to the forefront of her mind. She’d spotted the eggnog and whiskey sitting, mostly empty, on one of her good wooden tables with no coatsters but had found that she wasn’t upset because the sight of her little boy so comfortable with another person made her, as a mother, happier than she’d thought it would.
Pansy, Blaise and Theo had joined them, coming to Malfoy Manor for the last few days before they went back to Hogwarts. It was great to see all his friends, Harry just wished they were as passionate about Quidditch as they were about croquet. He and Draco had tried getting them all on broomsticks to practice before the school year started but, other than Draco, they just couldn’t get into it. Hence, why they were playing croquet.
Draco watched as Harry rounded the corner, laughing at something Cedric Diggory was telling him. Jealousy flashed through him. He mentally berated himself. Harry was allowed to talk to other people. He had to stop being weird.
For the rest of lunch Flint would throw the apple and Harry would race after it and bring it back. It was Flint who tired first. "Merlin's hairy balls Potter how are you still going? My arm is aching." But the other boy was giving him an appreciative look. "Do you know much about quidditch Potter?"
“My gifts first!” Theo said as he got up from the sofa, dragging his duvet behind him, to where he bent over by the tree and turned around, arms full of similarly shaped and sized gifts.
Really, it isn’t news so much as I have known what I’m about to share for some time. I suppose the reason I didn’t tell you sooner was because I was scared of the way you would both react.
One night things were getting more heated than usual. Pansy had helped Harry out of his shirt and her own blouse was unbuttoned and slipping off her shoulder. She sat in his lap, cupping his face with her small delicate hands. Her cheeks were flushed a dark pink and his chest lifted and fell rapidly. But when he felt Pansy’s hands move to unbutton his pants panic like he’d never felt before surged through him.
Draco held the bottle up to the light and looked at it through the glass. “It looks goopy,” he said, grimacing.
The Hogwarts staff and students were all in a state of fear. Fear, is an interesting emotion. It makes individuals do and say things that under any other circumstance they likely wouldn’t. It was a rainy evening when the news of yet another attack, another dual petrification. Harry cursed himself for agreeing to put off telling the teachers. A girl from Ravenclaw and Hermione.
"Granger." Draco repeated the girls name. "That's not a wizards name I've heard before. Who are your parents?"
“You know,” Pansy said, sighing as she lay down beside Harry. “You and Draco, I don’t know what I’d do without you.”
“It really isn’t a problem Mr Malfoy. Usually I do all the chores for my Aunt and Uncle so this is really no big deal.”
“Pans…” She was a mess, dark black hair in her face, nose all pink and runny. Harry squished into the armchair beside her and pulled her into a bone crushing hug.
“I’m spending the summer with my Aunt in Greece,” Pansy said, lips pursed and eyes averted as she rooted around in a side bag and pulled out a magazine to look at. Harry thought she seemed a little off and the look he shared with Draco confirmed that he thought the same thing. He didn’t want to address it in front of Theo and Blaise though.
Harry stopped packing long enough to glare at the other boy. “I’m actually serious. What if they decide they don’t want you to be friends with me anymore?”
“We went to our place in Italy for most of July, visited a cousin in Monaco, couple weeks in Spain, few days in Poland-”
Harry took a sip of water from the cup on his bedside table, ice cold water slid down his throat. When he turned back around Draco was slipping on his eye mask.
“Merlin, get off my back! It’s not like you’re my fucking girlfriend!” Pansy’s hands curled into fists and her face flashed tomato red before her expression hardened. Theo paled, looking like he regretted the words the instant they’d left his mouth. But it was too late to take them back. “Pans, I’m sor-”
“Yeah, like imagine your doing a girl, or she’s sucking you off or something. Whatever gets you off.”
The Malfoy’s shared a puzzled look but didn’t try to argue with him any further on the matter. Over the rest of the winter break Harry ended up managing to corral a very unwilling and stubborn Draco into helping Dobby prepare a few of their meals.
It was a wonder they didn’t miss the train. Between Draco’s stupidly long morning skin routine, Theo’s sudden realisation that he’d fallen asleep before packing the night before and Harry’s trouble getting Hedwig settled in her cage.
Inside the envelope was a second piece of parchment. He read it, re-read it, a huge grin spread across his face.
They all ended up gathered in the same sitting room as the night before. All of them were still in their pyjamas even though it was mid afternoon. Pansy had a blanket wrapped around her shoulders to stay warm and Theo had a duvet pulled over his head.
“This is the inside gardens. My mother's got a bit of a statue collection in there- not very interesting-”
Pansy skipped back to the bed and rejoined them. “Do you think thirteen is too young to take shots.”
He leaned against the compartment door frame. Harry didn’t miss the way Theo tensed up. “Blake Westenhaver. I’m in seventh year, Ravenclaw,” the older boy smiled. He was good looking with a sharp jawline and long brown hair that he kept having to push back from his face. Whenever he did this the silver rings on his fingers flashed.
They were all sitting in the empty common room, the rest of the Slytherins had gone home, when Pansy snapped, "Theodore, you shouldn't smoke that shit."
“Theodore, you know we aren’t allowed snakes!” Pansy hissed. “Cats, owls rats and toads. That’s it.” She shuddered. “Though I don’t see why you’d want either of the last two. That red headed boy from Gryffindor, the Weasley’s got a rat and Neville’s got a toad. They’re both hideous. The pets and their owners.” Pansy shook her head. “Anyway, the point is, snakes aren’t allowed.”
“Don’t think about it that way.” Harry poured himself a little more eggnog and whiskey. As disorienting as it was having almost no depth perception or balance anymore the alcohol filled him with a bubbly warmth.
Draco and Griffin left the room together and Harry shoved down the ugly feelings rising up in his chest. There was no reason to be feeling this way.
As they continued their walk to the Slytherin dorms Harry and Draco fell behind the other three. Harry was smirking and running a hand through his hair when he tensed up all of a sudden and froze in his tracks. Draco stopped with him.
“He drank unicorn blood, we saw in the forest, enough to stay rooted in this world-” The Parkinson girl was rambling and Narcissa didn’t know what to make of half of what she was saying.
Students stepped aside for a furious looking Professor McGonagall. "Why is it that you've both decided that it's acceptable to beat one another to death?!" She seethed.
When he opened his eyes again the grief had hardened to something cold. He was no longer crying. Something in him was aching. Harry stared at the veil his godfather had fallen into. “It hurts,” he whispered, barely able to get the words out. “Why does it physically hurt?”
Before them stood Harry Potter. The jagged scar, that just as legend whispered, appearing in the form of a lighting bolt beneath his rumpled black hair confirmed it. This boy's name was known by every witch and wizard there was. This boy with his tattered clothes and crooked glasses was as legendary as Albus Dumbledore himself, and for something he likely didn't even remember. He had brought the downfall of perhaps the most wicked wizard in all of history. And here he stood before her, asking for help.
“You know, Harry,” Draco started, indecisive whether telling his best mate was a good idea. But then, he’d never kept secrets from Harry. He rubbed at the back of his neck. “Fudge has told my father that he was out at Azkaban the night he escaped. That the guards told Fudge Black had been talking in his sleep, saying the same words: “He’s at Hogwarts… he’s at Hogwarts.” Black is mad, totally deranged, but… some think he’s after you. They think Black’s motive is to murder you to bring back the Dark Lord. He lost everything the night you stopped the Dark Lord and he’s had twelve years to marinate in that ugly loathing…”
“Yes, Griffin’s been studying the subject, he thinks he’ll go into a related field when he gets out of school. The issue is that there’s limited resources on the finer details.”
“Yes, of course, come in Potter. Shut the door behind you.” Draco stood in front of his mirror and finished with putting the gel in his hair.
Harry felt rejuvenated. It’d been awhile since he’d felt so awake in class. “Why, he seems to be a good teacher? Kinda intense but the guy’s brilliant?”
“I’m not going to be murdered,” Harry said, hard and cold. The memory of the looming black dog with glowing yellow eyes from the night he’d run away from the Dursleys washed over him.
His stomach did feel a bit queasy, but he wasn’t about to admit that. “Nice sunburn, Malfoy,” Harry tried to hold back the massive grin that threatened to split across his face but it was just so good to see his best friend again and he couldn’t help it. Not to mention Draco really did look comedically red from too much sun. “Careful when we go back to Hogwarts they don’t hang you up thinking you’re a Gryffindor banner,” he teased.
“Pansy’s told me all about you guys.” Adam’s eyes fixed on Theodore and he smiled. It didn’t reach his eyes. He extended his hand, palm down. Most people wouldn’t have noted the significance in the way Adam had extended his hand, palm down, but Draco had given Harry a quick history of handshaking and the different ways you could go about it a couple years ago. Adam was trying to establish his dominance.
Blake raised an eyebrow. “Is that so? I’m a chaser on the Ravenclaw quidditch team. We almost won against you last year. You must remember me at least a bit from that.”
Draco knew the library at the manor was impressive. It was three floors full of row upon row of floor to ceiling bookshelves full of books.
“Never liked that prick,” Theo said happily to Harry, Draco and Blaise. “Their relationship would have never worked anyway, long distance would have been too much since he goes to school in America. Pansy told me herself, that’s why they broke up.” Theo smiled broadly. “Long distance.” He said the last words the way one might say ‘Free Firebolt’ or ‘No Homework.’ The three of them watched as Theo jogged back to the manor to grab Pany’s trunk from her and carry it to the car from her.
Harry tried to stop crying but it was no use. Everytime he blinked more tears flowed down his face. It felt unstoppable. It made him feel pathetic and cry more.
Draco’s hand went to his back where it rubbed circles, but he remained quiet, knowing there wasn’t anything he could say that could make up for the loss of the hope of that future he knew Harry had hoped for, to get away from his awful relatives.
Harry nibbled gently at Draco’s neck in that way he knew drove the other boy crazy. Draco swore and dug his fingers into Harry’s skin a little harder. Harry grinned against Draco’s skin at how responsive the other boy was to even the slightest touch. “Would it be so bad if they did?”
He listened, shocked, as Lupin told him about how as students at Hogwarts his father, James, his godfather, Sirius and their friend, Pete, had all become illegal Animagi to keep him company during his transformations. A stag, a dog and a rat.
“Ah, who cares about that. Everyone hates that dumb cat and no one much liked Creevey either. He was such a sniveling little git, always trying to get pictures of-”
“Yes, the Weird Sisters are known for their over the top performances,” Draco agreed, hugging Theo back when the other boy embraced him.
“Do you hear what  you’re saying at all?” Draco demanded, his anger rising up. “It would not be cool. Everyone probably thinks it was Harry who’s been petrified Mrs Norris and Creevey.”
"You first Draco, wait for us on the other side," his mother told him, laying a gentle hand on his shoulder. He observed his parents, gone was the look of shock, replaced by steady calculation. Nodding, he followed his mothers instructions and leaned into his trolley.
“You know my friends,” he’d finally introduced them all to his mother when they’d come up the last week of the summer before third year.
“So you’ve all heard about the escape of Sirius Black, right?” said Theodore as Harry took a swing at his ball. He completely missed and ended up uprooting the little white gate instead.
“That is the question isn’t it?’ Dumbledore answered Draco with a question. Draco hated when people did that.
The first encounter Harry has with Dobby he almost wets his pants. Draco had just finished showing Harry the rest of the manor when they walked into a fourth living room (“Draco, under what circumstances is having four bloody living rooms necessary?”), this one had green, silver and earth toned colour scheme.
I have no idea what we’ll do about custody. I’m staying in this manor in Italy. It’d be good to see you this summer I guess.
Harry blinked and looked down at the double queens at the top of the pile. He looked at his own hand and with slightly shaky hands picked out the double kings he had.
Harry sighed and leaned against his mallet for support. “Here we go again,” he said to Draco, leaning in so only the other boy would hear.
She sighed, in frustration, wiping away her tears. “Your relationship was inevitable. Your love is the kind written in the stars, Harry.”
"Nah, he was fine,” She huffed. “Much better than Jeoffrey. He can't hold an intellectual conversation for shit though."
The next thing Draco knew he was closing his eyes and leaning in. The kiss was hot and fast and desperate. Griffin pushed Draco’s back up against the shelf and Draco thought his heart might burst from his chest. He, Draco Lucius Malfoy, was kissing a boy. A boy was kissing him.
Harry sat back, pulling out of arm's reach, and tried to calm down but he was so worked up. It had come over him so fast, the overwhelming rush. “I’m so stupid. I don’t know how I just figured it out.”
Harry rolled his eyes, pursed his lips. Then an amused look entered his eyes. making Draco feel uneasy, and Harry smirked. “You know what’s really fucking hot?”
Harry took the gift, confused. Unwrapping it he unfurled a cloak. A note fluttered to the ground. Harry picked it up but all it said, in looping cursive, was 'use it well'.
"Of the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land, there is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk, known also as the King of Serpents. This snake, which may reach gigantic size, and live many hundreds of years, is born from a chicken's egg, hatched beneath a toad. Its methods of killing are most wondrous, for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs, the Basilisk has a murderous stare, and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall suffer instant death. Spiders flee before the Basilisk, for it is their mortal enemy, and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster, which is fatal to it."
Narcissa stared down at the eleven year old boy, with his ridiculous round glasses and whirlwind shock black hair. “Oh, Harry, you’re welcome at the manor anytime, alright?” She pulled him in for another hug. “See you boys!”
Black considered this, his hallowed face looking for skeleton like than ever as he glared at Pettigrew. Finally, he nodded in agreement.
Draco glanced up from the table and made eye contact with Griffin. It was heated and charged. This meal ought to be interesting.
They wandered the castle together, not talking, for quite awhile. They passed paintings and crossed moving staircases, stood in front of stained glass windows and checked out knights and statues for any new hidden secret passageways. After the tears were gone from Pansy’s face and her brows weren’t furrowed, nor her lips pressed in a hard line Harry said, "How are things going with Aldrich?"
“You must be Mrs Malfoy,” the young girl smiled up at her. “I’m Pansy Parkinson.” Ah, yes, Narcissa recognised Mauricius and Laurel Parkinson’s features mixed together in the girls face.
Draco smiled warmly at him and wrapped his arms around Harry. “Thank you,” he mumbled into Harry’s shoulder. Harry clung to Draco. “Of course. You’re my best mate, you know that?”
Harry looked away and crossed his arms tight across his chest. Draco was really going to make him spell it out. “Because I want it to be me,” he mumbled.
“Never have I ever learned how to play a musical instrument,” said Harry. The rest of his friends took a shot. “All of you?”
Harry wanted nothing more than to stay in bed, buried in the sheets. His bladder and gurgling stomach however wouldn’t allow that. He thought that maybe after breakfast he could get away without any of his friends noticing. This turned out to be wishful thinking as Pansy convinced them all to play cards in the living room, sitting on the floor around a wooden coffee table. Harry wasn’t really in the mood but he couldn’t get away from them without having to answer a number of questions he wouldn’t be able to lie well enough to be convincing.
“Harry, darling, it’s just too painful. Besides, I have to write the same essay but all my things are up in my rooms.” Pansy stood and pushed in her chair.
Fred gasped dramatically, like Harry had mortally offended him. “Just a piece of parchment he says!”
"I thought it was obvious." She sighed and sat up. "You're like his best mate, Harry. I think he's worried you might ditch him for someone else."
“Oh, alright,” Hermione sighed. “But we have to do something soon, before there’s another attack.” They all agreed, nodding glumly.
“Come now, Mister Malfoy, let’s get him to the hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey will be able to help him.”
Turned out he’d bought them all a bottle of their favourite liquor. Scotch for Draco, Whiskey for Blaise, Tequila for Harry and Krupnik (a polish honey vodka) for each of them.
Today’s quidditch match had been the most intense one Harry had ever played. Gryffindor and Slytherin had been neck in neck the entire time. There’d been a world’s worth of weight on his shoulders to catch the snitch and win the game for slytherin. His teammates were counting on him, he couldn’t let them down. Adrenaline had surged through Harry when he’d felt his fingers slip around and clasp the snitch. Relief had swept through him and he hadn’t been able to stop smiling. He knew he must have looked mad.
“Yes, that’s all fine and well,” Draco said. “Dobby, make us some treacle tart and tell us when you’re done. When you are find me mother. She wants you to buy Harry some winter boots.”
“Late night?” A voice drawled. Whirling around he saw Draco who was sitting up in bed, arms stretched out. A pop came when the boy cracked his back. Harry winced at the sound. Draco’s usually carefully coiffed hair was all over the place and he had the urge to smooth it back.
They then moved on to Pansy’s gifts. Harry opened the gift, tearing off the poorly wrapped wrapping paper, to reveal a box containing a weird sisters shirt and a collection of vividly coloured face masks.
“Yes, of course Miss Pansy Parkinson, Dobby will be back in a minute!” With that he popped away, not for a moment questioning the strange request.
“You’re a genius, Granger,” Pansy admitted. “You might really be the brightest witch of our age like they say.”
“I know. I’m glad you have such good friends. Not just Harry but Pansy too. You can have her up next year if you’d like?” She offered, hopefully.
“It’s another attack,” Dumbledore answered. “He’s been petrified.” Draco’s heart stopped in his chest and Harry’s eyes widened. Who? Who’d been petrified?
He checked the golden ticket Hagrid had given him once again. It hadn't changed since the last time he'd looked, which had been minutes ago. Only what he saw still didn't add up. The ticket told him he should be waiting at a platform 9 and 3/4. Craning his neck Harry spotted a platform 9 and a platform 10, however nothing in between.
"Of course. So you have no idea about houses...or just magic at all?" Draco was shocked. Magic was such a tremendous and important part of his life, he couldn't imagine not knowing about it. Harry just shrugged his shoulders. Draco couldn't believe it. The famous Harry Potter didn't know anything at all about himself or the world he was from.
“You boys have fun outside?” Mrs Malfoy asks, peering around the doorway of the sitting room, when they come in.
So what if he was getting less and less sleep now that he slept in the guest room alone every night?
“One-Two-THREE!” A flash of blue left both of their wands and the five of them watched in horror as Ron’s rat writhed madly before there was another flash came and then like a fast forward video the rat transformed. First a head shot out, then limbs, and before long a short grubby man was standing before them where Scabbers had once been. He had discoloured pale skin, a balding scalp with little hair and ugly yellowed front teeth.
“I don’t know. Maybe. Those are both good ideas.” Harry didn’t want his friends to think he didn’t appreciate their help but neither of those ideas really stuck with him.
“Let’s play a game,” Theo said when they’d found their way, some of them stumbling more than others, back to Draco’s room.
Griffin raised his eyebrows at Draco but stepped through. The other boy’s mouth dropped open “Whoa.”
“You’re a parselmouth Harry. You can talk to snakes so it would make sense that you’d  hear the Basalisk before it killed.”
“You know you’re safe while you’re at Hogwarts though, right, Harry?” Pansy rested a hand on his shoulder, he supposed in an attempt to comfort him. Right now though all he felt was a cold displacement. “ I mean Dumbledore is a very powerful wizard. He’ll protect you.”
Narcissa quickly gathered her wits and smiled warmly at him, even while her insides were squirming. Barely capable of seeing straight from anxiety she said, "Yes, of course, come along, darling."
“Give me the rat,” Lupin said to Harry in a calm and collected voice. But his eyes were filled with something hard.
“You sure you don’t want us to wait, Potter?” Gabriel asked. He and Timothy stood with their brooms in hand and bags over their shoulders.
“I found the letter,” Harry confessed, sitting up. Draco switched on the bedside light and squinted at Harry, eyes adjusting. Harry was pushing his glasses onto his face. “When I was going through your trunk to find your scarf for you. It was an accident, I shouldn’t have read it, but I found the letter from Clemonte.”
“Well I certainly don’t want you to get sick,” his mother tsked. “You’re downright wretched and more demanding than ever when you are and it’s miserable for everyone around you.”
Draco licked his lips and nodded. “Okay, but hold on a sec. You’re all sweaty.” Harry blinked through the darkness and watched Draco rummage through his wardrobe. He returned a few seconds later with a large, soft t shirt and boxers. Draco turned for Harry to change so he’d at least have semi privacy, but it was so dark it’s not like he’d have been able to see anything.
To his horror when Hermione found out she went to McGonagall who demanded to have the broom stripped down. To Harry’s understanding Ron was already in a foul mood with Hermione since her new cat, Crookshanks, had according to Ron, had it out for Scabbers, his rat since she got him before the school year started. Now Ron was barely talking to her (“How could she go to McGonagall...does she understand… the Firebolt is only the best broom there is!...have it stripped…Is she mad?!)
Pansy shook her head, her chin high as she refused to look at Theo. “What did you do this summer, Blaise?”
“I don’t know,” Hermione said, hesitantly. “Have you read his books? He seems awfully smart in them.”
“What are you talking about?” Harry looked around at all the scared faces watching him. “I was telling the snake to leave her alone.” The great hall was utterly silent.
“It’s not like I broke your heart, Aldrich, move along,” Pansy said. Heads started to turn, students trying to see what the fuss was all about.
Theo was cackling over two naked women to the left and Pansy was pointing at a very buff looking man. Harry laughed. Everything was funny, he found, when you were on your way to being very drunk. Merlin, he was hammered. He’d for sure consumed more than his fair share of the vodka. He would the next morning blame his following actions on just that but in the moment he wasn’t thinking much at all as he approached the buff statue and wrapped his arms around the statues neck and started making out with it.
Draco stood in the doorway of the dorm room, unable to move from where he was frozen staring. “Why, pray tell, are you doing push ups on the floor of our dormitory?”
She sat at the end of Harry’s bed. “You’re mother is in Dumbledore’s office giving him an earful,” she told them.
“I was just suggesting, darling.” Draco nodded but didn’t say anything else as he left his mother i the kitchen and ascended the stairs to his room. He could hear the shower running from the bathroom attached to Harry’s as he passed. Reaching his own room he walked into the bathroom and turned the shower faucet to start the water running. Stripping of his clothes, Draco stared into the mirror at his pale skin, pale hair, pale grey eyes. Soon the heat from the water had steamed up bathroom mirror so he could no longer see himself, just a fuzzy pale figure. With a sigh he stepped away from his reflection and into the boiling hot water.
“Eh, I mean it was mutual so it’s not really a big deal.” Theo shrugged and took out a plastic bag from his leather side bag that he carted around everywhere. “Just neither of us were really feeling it anymore.”
“Oh, Harry, you’re so wonderful.” She rested her cheek on his shoulder. “You’ve always been such a sweetheart. I’m shocked you don’t already have a date to the Yule Ball. I thought for sure you’d have one weeks ago. I thought I would too but that's a whole other matter.” She sniffled, nose still blocked up. Harry wished he had some tissues on him.
“I still think it’s hot,” Harry said, going back to writing his essay, as if what he’d just said wasn’t giving Draco a cross between an aneurysm and a heart attack.
“It sounds stupid, but none of it really means anything. It’s all just items that can easily be replaced.”
It was the long stretch before the Holiday Break when the teachers were all assigning work. Draco, Pansy and Harry had managed to snag a plush sofa by the fire to do their homework. At least that's what Draco was doing. Harry and Pansy lay sprawled out on the same sofa (their legs together and heads at opposite ends), basking in the warmth radiating out from the flickering flames. He was watching Draco do his work, gnawing on his lip, eyes narrowed in concentration. What little light lit the room reflected off Draco's blond hair and was absorbed by his pale skin. Harry found himself wanting to paint it or take a picture. But he wasn't good at art and he didn't have a camera so he was trying to commit the details to memory.
“Harry-” but he was already turning away and rushing down the stairs. He had to get out of the library.
Hoping maybe he was just sleepy, Harry took a shower. When he got out he changed into a pair of fresh boxers and the same sweater Draco had let him borrow from the evening of truth or dare. He’d kind of stolen it and made it his own. He didn’t usually wear a top to bed anymore, choosing to sleep without one, but he didn’t want to make Draco uncomfortable since they shared a bed. He’d taken the cue of wearing a top from Draco who slept in boxers and a baggy tshirt.
Harry found himself instinctually wanting to turn to Draco to ask for his opinion but when he did he found his best mate instead preoccupied with a handful of giggling french girls.
So he was going to make Draco spell it out for him. Merlin, it was like Harry was being purposely oblivious and thick headed. “I mean you, you dumbass.”
Harry quickly filled two goblets with punch. As he was walking away, he heard Draco saying something else but pretended to not hear and kept walking away. When he got back to Pansy he gave her one of the goblets, both of them downed the contents quickly before they returned to the dancefloor. Harry had never tried to dance a feeling away before but tonight he tried. There was an ugly overwhelming feeling spreading through him and he blamed it on Claudette. Everything had been fine before she showed up. But Draco was happy. That was what was most important. So he had to get rid of the cold ugly feeling she made him feel.
“Shut up, Potter,” Draco said, but there was no venom behind his words. “Mother, I thought you said you would pick me up a potion or healing lotion while you were out?”
There was still one thing that didn’t make sense though. “But the Basalisk can’t be in the walls,” said Draco.
Draco kicked Harry playfully and he kicked him back. They went back and forth like this for awhile as Theo and Blaise got a game of Exploding Snap started. Harry ended up with his head leaned against the compartment window wall, watching Draco watching him, with his feet pinned between both of Draco’s.
“I-” Pansy cleared her throat. “-I just have to hold it down so it sticks better,” she explained to Theodore.
Claudette laughed and rolled onto her back on the bed. Draco chewed his lip, not really sure how to respond to that. Claudette sat back up, all the way this time and pulled her legs under her so they were crossed. She reached out to Draco and looked him in the eye. “I know.”
“I didn't kill your parents,” Black said. Harry was about to yell that he might as well have killed them by betraying them to Voldemort when Draco stepped forward.
With so little time to spare before the train departed the station the group of them had to settle for the compartment at the very end of the train. It already had an occupant, a young looking man, despite already having grey flecked hair, with shabby robes. He was fast asleep up against the window.
Harry finished up his letter to his godfather and Remus before dashing down the hallway after Draco to tag along to his room, which was only a few halls from the guest room Harry’s things were in. Even though they’d been sharing a room for most of the Winter Break most of Harry’s clothes were still in a guest room so none of their friends got suspicious.
Theo happily took off his striped orange, red and turquoise jumper and pulled on Blaise’s dark one. “I feel so broody now.”
Draco scrambled to sit up. “I’m not- Potter isn’t my- Harry and I aren’t dating!”  He couldn’t figure out why she would think that.
The second semester of the school year was even crazier than the first. Harry was busy with Dumbledore’s Army, a group of students who actually wanted to learn how to defend themselves against the slowly but surely spreading darkness that was growing in the wizarding world, and trying to avoid all his friends who tended to nag him about studying for his OWLs. His main priority though was avoiding Draco. It filled him with guilt but seeing the other boy just made him feel even worse.
Blaise snorted and flipped to the next page of his book. “Merlin, Draco, we get it. You’re proud to be in Slytherin,” he said, tone dry and sarcastic.
“Oh dear boy!” Mrs Clemonte bustled forward and clasped Harry’s hands in her own. Draco drew some satisfaction from the surprised look on Harry’s face. “It’s so nice to meet you!”
“Dumbledore,” she addressed the old withered man. “What in Merlin’s name is going on. Where are my boys?”
The next day Harry suggested they go for a hike. Draco wasn’t really the outdoorsy type but he would have ripped his own eyeballs out if Harry had asked him to so evidently they ended up going on the hike. Before they left, when they’d been waiting in the entry hall for Theo to hurry his ass up, Draco had turned to Pansy who was zipping up a pair of tall boots.
“They tried to convince Dumbledore but the old man refused, said you had to go to Hogwarts,” Draco explained, shrugging, “and I’m not leaving without you.”
"It's good to meet you," Pansy said. Gregory helped her with her trunk. Once the others had heaved their luggage into the overhead shelves they settled into the remaining empty seats. Pansy, who sat beside Harry, asked, "Are you all expecting to make it into Slytherin?"
Draco watched Harry carefully. The other boy sat down across from Draco and sighed. "Everyone seems to think I'm some...hero."
“Oh, for Merlin’s sake you two,” Pansy snapped. “Would you stop for just two seconds with your incessant bickering!”
Harry ran a hand through his hair, he was annoyed about how much he cared for Draco’s well being even now. “Draco, you could get hurt-”
“You hang out with Megan at all?” Harry asked Theo. Megan Jones was the girl Theo had asked to the Yule Ball and fooled around with the year before.
Once it was just him and Pansy he asked the question that had been nagging him at the back of his mind all night. "So what was up with Draco? Why was he acting so weird, he seemed a bit better at the end there but still."
“It’s alright,” Pansy said in a soothing voice, resting a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Madam Hooch is coming now.” Sure enough when Draco glanced up Madam Hooch was standing over them. She knelt down next to Harry, across from Draco.
“Get started. If we start now we should finish before dinner, usually when it’s just me it takes me into tomorrow.”
"Mind if we join you?" A girl with glossy black hair up at the front of the group asked. "Everywhere else is full."
Draco pulled a face. “You’ve defeated Voldemort, what? three times now? You can handle some Dementors.”
“Er- because the french have that greeting where you kiss each others cheeks? And just about all the girls I’ve met from Beauxbatons wore lipstick?”
Draco’s cheeks were flushed pink but Harry figured it was from the alcohol. “Mother would probably be so upset if she knew I took her fancy expensive liquor,” Draco hummed, stroking Harry’s hair back from his forehead. Harry closed his eyes again and sunk further into the mattress. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt so relaxed.
The first time Harry experienced Draco’s tendency to spend money on lavish gifts ike it was no big deal was soon after the rumours about Harry dueling Terence, Slytherin’s current seeker, for his spot on their houses Quidditch team.
Draco’s face scrunched up. “Don’t be ridiculous, Darling. It’s not as if she does the gardening or cleaning herself. She must have house elves.”
“Don’t be a git,” Draco snapped. “You definitely aren’t getting enough if the size of your eyebags is anything to go by.”
I’m writing to share some news. I wish the following contents of this letter could be shared in person, however, I thought about waiting until the summer but decided I couldn’t wait any longer.
Harry put his arm around Draco’s shoulders. Like a friend would. “Well thank you, Draco darling. That’s very sweet of you.”
“Liar, I saw you hit it twice. Blaise you saw that too, right?” Pansy demanded. Harry and Draco shared a laugh over the alarmed look on Blaise’s face upon being addressed by a fired up Pansy. She whirled on them, “And what are you two giggling about? If you’d stop flirting for two seconds, Draco, you would know it’s your turn.”
Ah, yes, Draco remembered Mrs Clemonte. She talked faster than most could keep up with, Draco remembered many parties just sitting there as the woman gabbed on and on for hours by herself with only a nod or shake of the head as satisfactory response before she was off again. It was a tad exhausting but she’d inherited more than a small fortune and was incredibly influential and while yes, maybe it was a bit tiresome she was a pleasant woman.
“I only got one fuck for that necklace I bought you! You’re the bore,” Aldrich snapped. And so did Harry, he surged forward but Blaise yanked him back by the collar of his shirt.
“No, I mean, I don’t know for sure but he’s very open about people and their differences and treating everyone the same blah blah blah.” Draco pulled at his hair in frustration. Of course he had to be gay and of course he had to fall for the one person he couldn’t.
How are you guys doing? I hope you're all still staying connected to friends and family through facetime. I know it's really hard, it's weird not going to school and even weirder being cooped up inside with family for so long. We're all doing our best but it's okay if you're not your best most productive self every day<3
“At least we’re doing it in a safe environment with friends,” Draco mused. “Besides, we’re only tipsy, it’s not like we’re drunk.”
Harry shrugged, self conscious. “Well, I don’t know, but someone has to right? We’re not learning anything from Umbridge so-”
“I really just wanted to thank you Mrs Malfoy for letting me stay over for Christmas,” Harry said, turning to face her.
“Yeah, they were extra. You’re extra. It made sense.” Harry shrugged, he knew he was instigating now but couldn’t help himself.
Draco spun around and started pacing. Harry hated when Draco started pacing. He hated watching him go back and forth, back and forth. How did it not make Draco dizzy? Just watching him do it made Harry’s head spin. “I can’t believe they’re actually making you do this. It’s obscene. You aren’t old enough!”
“You promise to write to us over the summer?” Pansy said to Harry as they disembarked the Hogwarts Express at the station.
A million emotions had overwhelmed him all at once. His shock quickly turning to guilt and frustration when Draco had tried to confront him about why he’d had been avoiding him the last two months. He’d tried to leave the change room but Draco had grabbed his wrist so he couldn’t walk away. The warmth of his skin sent shivers down Harry’s spine. Harry turned to pull his hand back and was forced to face him. Draco’s face was paler than usual, dark bags beneath his eyes, rain slicked hood pulled up over his head, he looked awful. Harry couldn’t look away. Seeing Draco this miserable made him feel as if there were shards of glass being torn through his gut.
“No,” Draco said miserably. “Harry’s too good a person. He wouldn’t treat me any differently. But it’s so much easier now, when I’m still able to pretend that I have a chance.”
“Why not?” Pansy demanded. “How could Dumbledore be alright with Harry staying with his Aunt and Uncle but not be okay with Harry spending the summer with you?”
Just then new footsteps echoed from the other side of the corridor. “My apologies for my tardiness,” said Lochhart. “What have I missed?”
“I did not eavesdrop…” Except he totally had. “ I waited for you and overheard your loud blathering.”
But he couldn’t not tell them. He’d always gotten along with his parents and they’d always been able to work out their differences in the past.
The crushed look on Draco’s face had filled him with guilt. But even if he stopped avoiding his best friend how could he explain to him why he’d been avoiding him in the first place? How could Harry ever tell him he was attracted to him. The simple answer was that he couldn’t.
“Maybe so.” He could tell she was unconvinced, that she knew he was just trying to convince himself. “Maybe not. Either way, I am with you, no matter what.”
“Merlin, tu pourrais être l'amour de ma vie,” Draco grumbled. “Même si ton souffle est vraiment horrible les matins.” (Merlin, you could be the love of my life. Even if your breath really is awful in the mornings)
“Well I think we have a few books in our library on the matter. Draco could you take Griffin and show him?” Mrs Malfoy asked her son.
Harry nodded robotically. Draco noticed his friends discomfort. “They’re also placing guards from Azkaban around the schools perimeter as an extra precaution.”
“Where are we going?” he yawned. Draco was silent up ahead, they turned a corner and headed down the a green torch lit hallway. The small flickering eerie green flames flickered. The windows on the wall opposite still had their drapes pulled back and moonlight created shadows with the gnarled tree branches against the stone wall and on the statues faces. Harry looked away and sped up to catch up with Draco who pushed open the door at the end of the hall. The pale, blond boy looked to Harry, waiting for him to go through first.
“I’ve seen you staring at Miles Bletchley after Quidditch games, which I understand, his ass does look fine in those pants. You also got quite flustered that time that blond sixth year what’s-his-name-Arlenwoods asked you about the new common room password. There was also the time-”
Tiny glasses came shooting through the air towards them. Theo lined them up and filled them. “Alright, go ahead, Harry.”
“He’s just so annoying!” Pansy exploded. “He’s been picking meaningless fights with me for months. We’ve always bickered but this has been different. So many snide side comments. He’s just so angry with me all the time!”
“I was just going to get Dobby to make us some treacle tart,” Draco told his mother, hanging his coat.
Pansy rose to her feet and gave Harry a long hard look. “Don’t let this be what drives you two apart. Best friends are supposed to get through thick and thin together.”
“Who’s that tosser?” Theo muttered. Harry followed his line of sight and assumed he was glaring at the boy snogging Pansy.
“Your idea to use a chicken was really good,” Harry admitted to Draco, begrudgingly. They weren’t exactly fighting anymore but Harry wasn’t ready to go back to the way things were before.
He hears the door open and violently startles. Draco wipes at his face fast, but he knows it’s no use. His eyes are probably red from crying. He looks up to see Pansy’s worried face. At least it isn’t any of the boys.
“Don’t be silly, Potter. You can just use some of mine.” Draco opened the drawer of his vanity table and selected a pair. “Here, these match your eyes.” He reached for Harry’s sleeves and kept his eyes down on the cufflinks, they really were a very pretty emerald, so he wouldn’t look up at Harry even though he could have put them on in his sleep. “I can’t believe you forgot the reason you came to my room in the first place,” he chuckled as he finished.
"It's going to read my mind?!" Harry demanded with wide eyes, he ran a hand through his messy black hair. Draco wondered if it was as soft as it looked.
With no warning the snitch stopped in mid air and just as Harry’s fingers slide around it a player in green slammed into him. Both of them tumbled to the ground.
i think i prefer writing longer chapters less frequently though (they feel more satisfying to post) hope y'all don't mind. i have most of the rest of this story mapped out and i'm super excited for what's to come! enjoy
Harry thought he saw Theo’s cheeks flush pink as he hugged her back but was distracted by Draco’s hand sliding into his own. He glanced up at his boyfriend's face, affection flooding through him. The porch light was harsh but Draco still looked good, his sharp features appeared even more striking than usual.
“So the missus is coming for dinner tonight?” They turned a corner and Harry nearly knocked down what looked like a very expensive vase. Looking up, Harry saw that the whole hallway on both sides was full of oil portraits of who Harry assumed to be Draco’s ancestors. All the witches and wizards were scowling and had very sharp features. It was a very long hallway.
"Snape says we get to test it at the end of the class." Draco seemed genuinely encompassed and interested in this. The other boys definitely had more motivation academically, particularly in potions, than Harry felt he himself had.
But he started to squirm in his seat when after some time they still hadn't returned. Unable to listen to Mrs Clemonte any longer he excused himself, saying he felt light headed and wanted to lay down. With that he bid his friends goodnight and ascended the stairs, in the direction of the library instead of his room. He had to check on Draco. There was a part of him that had to know if the other boy was alright.
“When are we ever going to need to transform an owl into opera glasses?” grumbed Theo, turning around to face Harry and Pansy.
"Because a boy named Neville seems to have lost- hold on! You're Harry Potter! I've read all about you. I'm Hermione Granger."
The next morning Harry, Pansy and Draco woke up with headaches and surprisingly good friendship bracelets around their wrists. Harry was also missing a sock on his right foot.
They watched Adam storm away, heading in the direction of the manor. Pansy turned away and took her turn, a fierce calculating look in her eyes. Her ball followed Harry’s right through the gate and struck Harry’s ball, sending it way off course.
Draco planted one last firm kiss on Harry’s lips. Harry closed his eyes and tried to wrap his arms around Draco to draw him closer to him. However, the other boy was already stepping away, grinning, as he bent over to pick up his coat from the floor where he’d dropped it earlier to better occupy his hands with the ever so important task of gripping Harry’s hips.  “We’re not ditching. Pansy would be pissed. Let’s go.”
“My mother and father will expect me to make some rounds and talk to people since we’re hosting but if you want I can do it fast and then excuse myself and we could, I don’t know, play some wizards chest?”
“Hello Draco darling,” his mother addressed him with a pointed stare. “You remember Mrs Clemonte and her son Griffin?“
“He’s trying to teach me how to produce a patronus.” At Draco’s expression of enthusiasm Harry went on, “I haven’t had much luck so far though so don’t get all excited.”
“I didn’t know it was anything out of the ordinary,” Harry confessed, and Draco believed him. “Besides,” Harry went on, “I’ve only done it once before when I set a boa constrictor on my cousin at the zoo.” Draco raised his eyebrows at his best mate. “What? It’s not like I did it on purpose!”
He sighed. Okay, this was the less chill part he’d been expecting. Harry was still sitting here though instead of storming away and he hadn’t thrown anything or yelled yet so this situation was already better than three fourths of the scenarios he’d imagined would take place. “Why are you being weird, Potter?”
“No no no no no.” Draco buried his head in his hands, between his knees. He couldn’t like Harry and he told Claudette as much.
"I didn't know. About your mother I mean." On the inside Draco was beating himself up. He'd never had many friends growing up. Surely he couldn't mess this up so early on.
"Yes, you'll want to get a good compartment before they're all taken." His Mother nodded. He hugged her and was about to turn away with his trolley when he noticed that Harry was still just awkwardly standing there.
“Clearly you don’t! You can’t clear the pile after matching your five with the five I just played! Four players need to play all four of the same card before the pile is cleared!”
Pansy rolled her eyes at him, hitting him playfully before hopping off the bed. She fished around in her bag for a minute before pulling out a couple Galleons. “Dobby!” The house elf popped into the room at being summoned and Pansy startled. “You frightened me!” she giggled, then she tried to make a serious face to hide her tipsiness.
“There he is,” Draco said, having just spotted him. Harry was standing alone on the platform with his trolley loaded with Hedwig and his trunk. Draco watched as Pansy ran and tackled `their friend. Harry stumbled and nearly toppled over but somehow managed to stay upright. He hugged Pansy back.
“Come on, Pansy.” They found McGonagall who wanted them to stand at the Great Hall entrance with the rest of the competitors.
Harry obliged and tried not to squirm too much as Pansy used her teeth to pull his left sock off. She made it look really easy.
That's when he saw them. He picked them out from the crowd easily. They stood out among others in the train station with their white blonde hair and sharpe features. They looked impossibly regal in dark sleek clothes, not a single hair out of place. They walked with their noses up, the young boy pushed his trolley before him and his parents followed close behind. Harry's eyes landed on the owl and trunk the boys trolley carried and his hope soared.
"Harry you looked charming in your robes," said Pansy out of nowhere. "The tie really brings out your eyes."
“I did! Many times actually!” Draco exclaimed loudly, waving his arms around in the air wildly, startling a group of first years who promptly scurried off to their dorm. “My father will hear about this,” he started muttering under his breath to himself as he stalked toward their dormitory. “I’ll go write them a letter now. The ministry has to listen to reason…”
“We know something’s going on.” Pansy crossed her arms across her chest. “ If you don’t tell us we’re going to have to tell Mrs Malfoy.”
Disbelief crashed over him as his heart fell to his feet and time stopped. All the giddy happiness he’d felt earlier was gone, replaced by something much darker.
“And you’re a bore.” There was a small crowd starting to gather and Harry’s gut started to roil. This was going to get really ugly really fast.
By now there was a large crowd up students surrounding them, watching the scene play out from a safe distance. Aldrich’s face twisted and he spat at Harry's feet. The other boy reached for his pocket and it was only then, through his rage that Harry remembered his wand. As both of them drew their wands and were about to fire off spells a loud voice thundered, "EXPELLIARMUS!" Both Harry and Aldrich’s wands flew out of their hands.
“Is it from… did you get it for me?” Harry felt quite speechless as he tore away the brown paper to reveal the latest and highly coveted magical items in Hogwarts, a Nimbus 2000. “Draco, you didn’t?’
“I don’t think I like girls at all,” he confessed, twisting the coloured, string friendship bracelets from Harry and Pansy on his wrist.
“Ah, yes, well- well I’ll just be up in my room. Preparing.” And with that he turned on his heel and left in a hurry.
“You can’t buy me you nasty mother fucker! You don’t buy a girl some jewellery, or anything for that matter, and then expect her to kiss your ass.”
Malfoy Manor was beautiful in the winter. Then, Harry had never seen it at any other time of the year, he was sure it looked just as incredible no matter the season. Harry stared wide eyed at the way the snow coated the manor. It was an old building with arches and spires and balcony railings. He loved the old architecture. Loved walking among the snow dusted  shrubs and trees in the sprawling gardens.
A loud groan came from Theo’s bed, signalling his conscious state. The boy shoved back his hangings and stumbled to the bathroom. The sound of urine hitting the water could be heard as Theo had so thoughtfully left the bathroom door open.
“Yes, we know mother,” Draco started to pull his trunk from the trolley to get it onto the waiting Hogwarts express. Narcissa didn’t mean to embarrass him in front of Harry, she’d just miss him so much and didn’t want to let him go even though she knew she had to.
Harry dropped his trunk to the floor and placed Hedwig's cage down beside it. She hooted and flapped her wings restlessly.
“What, so are you just never going to talk to him again?” Harry sat in stony silence. He didn’t have an answer for that, he didn’t know what he was going to do yet. “He’s your best friend!”
I’ve been trying to think of what the best way to tell you is. Upon much thought and contemplation, I've come to the conclusion that instead of beating around the bush, I'll tell you out right, plainly, as it is.
“You moron!” Draco sat up, pushing back the covers, his book falling aside. “Of course I understand. It’s because I understand that I stayed behind. How could you think I’d ever leave you?”
Just then Theo made his entrance. “Ah, you must be the lovely Mrs Clemonte I’ve heard so much about!”
He lay in bed, motionless, as he caught his breath. Harry felt totally drained and let himself sink heavily into the sheets, relaxing completely. Then the reality of what had just happened dawned on him. He’d just come at the thought of his best friend. Panic seized him and ruined his ability to marinate in the wonderful feeling he’d just achieved. It’s because we have such a close friendship, Harry tried to reason with himself.
“Vodka? Seriously Theodore?” Pansy rolled her eyes at him. Harry wasn’t sure what else they’d been expecting.
“I’ll go tell her brothers now,” Minerva McGonagall was saying, solemnly. “They’re all in Gryffindor.”
“Can we get started with the presents already.” Blaise grunted, evidently very much not a morning person.
He watched the tension ease from Draco’s posture. Harry picked up the second gift in the small pile and unwrapped a cashmere sweater.
“There’s something I should probably tell you,” he told her, consciously trying to relax his posture.
“Not at all.” Walking back into the chalet through a sliding glass door, the boys shook off the snow that clung to their coats.
Bursting through the common room entrance he almost knocked down a pair of second years. “Sorry!” he blurted, not bothering to so much as slow down on his way to his dorm.
“Oooo!” Harry exclaimed and held up a thick cloak. It was emerald green with silver trim. “This is rather posh.”
“Malfoy. Draco Malfoy. Et s'il vous plaît, le plaisir est tout pour moi.” (Malfoy. Draco Malfoy. And please, the pleasure is all mine.)
Draco beamed and held out his hand. "So it's decided then. From Slytherin, together, we'll rise to greatness. Friends?"
Then most frightening of all, Sirius Black had attacked the Fat Lady at the entrance of the Gryffindor common room. Hermione and Draco figured he’d thought Harry was in Gryffindor because that’s what James and Lily had been sorted into. After this the school talked of little else besides the attack and Sirius Black’s brilliance at first being able to escape Azkaban and then his ability to get into Hogwarts even with the Dementors stationed outside and Dumbledore’s presence.
“I would never say that.” He could tell Griffin was about to make another witty retort so he said, “Here we are,” and pushed open the large library double doors.
“If I tell you I won’t be able to get more candid ones like this in future.” Harry flipped to the back of the album and saw that there were some blank pages to keep adding.
When Draco woke the next morning, it was to a strange sensation. His legs were tangled with Harry’s and the other boy had his arm draped around Draco’s midsection. This was fine. Everything was fine. Best friends cuddled all the time. Slowly, to not wake Harry, Draco pushed his eye mask up onto his forehead so he could see.
As the Quidditch match got closer and closer Harry knew he should buy a new broom, as it was likely he wouldn’t get his Firebolt back before the match even with Marcus Flint nagging Professor McGonagall. He and Ron would go to her after every Transfiguration class but she still wouldn’t let him have it back, each time saying there was this or that hex or curse that Professor Flitwick suspected.
“Are you high, Theodore?” Pansy licked her lips and raised her eyebrows, giving him an unimpressed look. Draco noticed she’d completely ignored his comment about not calling him Theodore.
“Be my guest,” Theodore said, sitting up and making more room for them, gesturing to the space around him. “And call me Theo, or Nott. Only my mother, bless her heart, calls me Theodore.”
What, you’re seriously contemplating this? I’m surprised. I thought the automatic answer would be Pansy since she’s the girl,” said Theo. “You’d kiss one of us guys?
A thought occurred to him as his hand pumped himself. Theo told him that masturbation was usually better while fantasising.
Draco had gotten pissy like this last year when Harry had told him he thought his ability to speak fluent french was hot. “What, because it sounds gay?”
Draco swept him into a tight embrace. Harry went limp in his arms and squeezed his eyes shut as the grief tore through him.
Harry and Draco sat across from one another at the long wooden table in the Slytherin common room one winter afternoon, trying to get through another bloody long essay set by McGonagall. The atmosphere in the room was one of excitement. The winter break was fast approaching and that meant so was the Yule Ball. Harry couldn’t understand what the fuss was about. It was just a bit of food and dancing. Why everyone was so worked up about putting stuffy clothes on was beyond him. He told Draco as much and the other boy chuckled warmly.
“Malfoy, please, don’t be so ridiculous.” Harry rolled his eyes. “It’s not like you’ve been traipsing through the forbidden forest. Your shoes aren’t covered in mud. Besides, it takes a flick of a wand to get rid of any small dirt you do get on the sheets.”
Harry was distracted from the actual words coming out of Draco’s mouth as his attention was actually currently mostly fixed on how the red and gold trimmed robes Draco was wearing brought out the pale pink blush his face had turned. When he didn’t answer Draco’s eyes wandered to meet his in the mirror’s reflection and Harry pulled himself together enough to string a sentence together. “I look stupid in these.” Harry held out his arms so Draco could see how dumb he looked in the dress robes.
His mother’s eyes looked sad and Draco felt bad for pushing her like this. “I know, love. At least Harry’s here, right? You two are very close.”
“Mother is that you?” called out Draco’s familiar voice. He appeared at the top of the staircase, one hand on the banister. “You look green, Potter. First time apparating?”
“Alright, well I’ll see you around, Potter,” Diggory said waving. Stupid smile. Stupid hair. Draco had better hair than that didn’t he?
He ticked them off on his fingers. “Creevey’s a muggleborn, Fletchley’s a muggleborn, Grangers’s a muggleborn and Clearwater, that girl from Ravenclaw who was attacked is muggleborn or half blood as well because she isn’t a pureblood.”
"We're making a hiccoughing potion," Draco told him, running his finger down a list of ingredients in his textbook. Harry studied his face. Draco was bitting his lower pale pink lip in concentration. Before Harry could look away Draco glanced over at him with those steely grey eyes.
“Don’t say that yet. You don’t know what’s going to happen over the next few years.” When Harry didn’t say anything else Draco went on, “That was really clever what you did. Summoning your Firebolt, for Black to fly away on.”
Draco rolled his eyes and headed for the stairs, he’d almost reached the bottom of the staircase when he hesitated and turned around. “Did you get Harry gifts this year as well?”
“Because you’re all sweaty, Potter, and the silk pyjamas are expensive. Besides, you’ll be less hot in these.” Harry knew Draco was trying to tease him but he could still hear the worried note in his voice. “Come on, get in bed already,” Draco said, yawning.
Pansy glanced up into his face. Her breath caught. They were rather close. So close that she could see the way the green in his eyes mixed with the brown. So close she could have counted all of his freckles. So close the urge to press her lips to his dark pink ones was stronger than ever.
Ron’s eyes went to the cloak in Harry’s arms. “Is that-” Harry draped the cloak over the three of and Ron was looking at Harry, mouth wide. “It’s an invisibility cloak, isn’t it? Where’d you get it Harry?”
Harry grimaced and squeezed his arms tightly around Draco’s middle, making the squirmy boy wriggle. “See, it sounds really cute what you’re saying but for all I know you could be telling me I stink.”
This isn’t a phase, though I have in the past wished that it was. I used to beg any higher power, if there was one, to be straight. Merlin knows my life would be a much easier one if I could choose to like girls. I’ve tried to ignore this part of me, hoping that with time maybe it would go away. However, it has not. And with this time a different outcome has come about. I used to be revolted by this part of me. Before that I was in denial that it was even true. With time though I have accepted it. I will not creep around in shame. I will not be weighed down by guilt about a part of me that I cannot change or control.
And then there was the matter that every time he closed his eyes he found that the memory of Draco swapping spit with Clemonte was tattooed to the inside of his eyelids. The problem was that even with his eyes open the memory seemed to be at the forefront of his mind. It drove him crazy that no matter how he tried to distract himself his thoughts always went back to that unpleasant image. It made him even crazier that he couldn’t figure out why. It was stupid. Beyond stupid. Perhaps the stupidest thing ever. He reasoned with himself that it made sense that he felt protective. Draco was his best friend. But why was he angry? Why was he jealous?
Then footsteps started to echo down the hall. Everyone was going down to the great hall for the Halloween great feast. He wanted to pull Harry away so no one would see them at the scene of the crime but it was too late. Kids were already starting to round the corner.
They’d found it. Harry stared engraving of the snake in the girls bathroom on the second floor. He had to tell someone. He raced to go find Ron but students were streaming through the halls. What was going on? Then he realised it was dinner time. Going with the flow of students he walked into the great hall and spotted Ron immediately, not that it was hard with his shock of red hair. Walking as fast as he thought he could without being suspicious Harry went to Ron.
“Boys, this is Adam. Adam these are the boys,” Pansy said, introducing them. “Draco, Harry, you’ve already met Blaise, and Theodore.”
It was weird not having him there to talk to, sitting beside other people in class and panicking every time they so much as made eye contact.
The girl wiped away at her eyes quickly, trying, Harry suspected, to hide that she’d been crying. “Oh, it’s nothing!”
They’d gone on to tell Harry about how they’d acquired it years back from Filch’s office then blown Harry’s mind, showing him how to get the map to reveal all of Hogwarts, secret passageways and all (“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good!” “See that there Harry? That’s a passageway that’ll get you right into Hogsmeade.” “Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs. We owe them so much.” “Make sure you wipe it when you’re done” “Or else anyone can read it.” “Just tap it again and say ‘Mischief managed’.”)
Draco was baffled when the previously inconsolable Theo came out from the manor to play the next round with them. Draco wasn’t sure what had flipped the switch but gone was the Theo who’d been completely impossible to spend any time with and now he laughed cheerful and smiled brightly. The group of them finally caught up properly (“You did what?!” “Oh, don’t look at me like that, Theodore.” “You went to a nudists beach?!” “Mhmm”).
Harry laughed because he really hadn't expected to be making friends so fast. Giddiness swelled in his chest. He promptly shook Draco's hand. Harry's hand was warm. Draco thought his fingers were long and narrow compared to the other boys. They looked into each other's eyes. Draco was taken back by just how green Harry's were.
“Just dandy,” Harry replied, rolling his eyes. “Must of the summer I was up in my room pretending I didn’t exist. Yourself?”
Harry woke up the next morning in nothing but his underwear. When he crawled out of bed he saw his clothes strewn around the room. It’d been really late the night before when he’d finally extracted himself from Pansy and stumbled, half asleep, to the dormitory.
