Harry pauses, “when I was fighting Voldemort?”
He doesn't respond to Harry's words immediately, eyes unfocused. And there’s a beat, a pause, a breath, and Malfoy's mouth opens.
, seems to skyrocket. He throws them easy smiles, shoulders relaxed as the school seems to breathe in tune with him. Two years ago, the girls’ eyes would’ve felt like danger, like they burned holes in his skin, but now, he relishes in it. All it means is he’s safe, he’s cherished, he’s
“I'm a kid too, Malfoy.”
Draco nods immediately, “Yes sir,” he hitches his bag even higher, nails digging into the leather.
Harry slices his finger with the knife and blood begins to leak from the shallow wound. Ron glances over at him before tossing the recently chopped beetroots into the cauldron. Wincing, Harry picks up his wand and touches it to his finger, closing the wound with a quick spell. It’s then he realizes that the roots he’d been cutting his knife were bloodied, and then thrown into the cauldron. He leans over the cauldron, face above the fumes as if to see the roots thrown in. He breathes into the pot. Harry feels almost responsible for what happens next.
“Potter. Harry. I need the pain to stop. I need, I need, I need you to save my parents, Harry. They can’t die. They’ll die if you don’t save them.”
“I’ve been looking for you all day. I didn’t think you’d be here.”
the first defense session
i know it’s been a while, but i’m here! not fully back, but here’s a slightly longer than chapter than usual to make up for my short absence!
“I know,” Draco smiles, “I love you just as much.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Draco says, refusing to look at his friend
Burying his head in his hands for what feels like the fifth time today, Draco imagines a Potions tutoring class with Potter at the other end of the table. He pulls memories from past Potions lessons and sees Potter blowing both himself, and Draco up. Draco scraps any idea of hands-on potions making. Then he imagines trying to teach Potter the basics, as Draco had learned as a child. He can only see Potter whining and throwing a fit. Scrapped.
There are two steaming bowls on the dinner table, and the music has been turned down. Harry Styles plays softly in the background. Draco’s sitting at the table already, bobbing his head to music and typing on his phone. He doesn’t glance up when Harry gets to the table and continues to rapidly type out some message. There’s no need for any theatrics, they’ve been together long enough for Harry to dig into the food as Draco types.
“Ignore that,” she says, “so, tell me, how is it going?” Her hands are folded carefully in lap, but the wide smile on her is beyond suspicious.
Harry shrugs, “I think we’re done for the day. See you, see you whenever.”
The first tutoring lesson is difficult. Potter comes late, swaggering in with windswept hair and love bites crawling up his neck, fueling the fire sitting in Draco’s chest. He can’t pinpoint the center of his emotions but chalks it up to pure jealousy, jealousy that Potter was able to bounce back from everything and revered by all.
“Neville didn’t have confidence in his spells. You don’t either, Malfoy.” Harry says, crossing his arms over his broad chest. “It’s an easy fix, though. Just practice.”
The castle begs for Harry Potter to save their lonely boy, the magic cracked and broken at the thought of one more lost student.
Harry looks back and forth, and back and forth between the two, and groans in defeat.
Malfoy’s quiet.
“Malfoy, let’s go,” Weasley calls, gesturing for the other to join him at the mat. Draco trudges over, he didn’t think he’d had a single conversation with Weasley since the year began.
He sees Malfoy at the edge. Malfoy. Malfoy. Malfoy?
“You’d be dead. Again.”
“Yes, I get it! My eggnog isn’t the best, but that’s why we bought extra from the store. Shush.” Harry laughs at Draco, and a warm feeling passes through Draco as Harry smiles.
Draco’s eyes glitter as he dances with his amazing partner. They both smell like gingerbread batter, the dried batter on their clothes. The apartment smells like Christmas, the large green tree shines in the corner of the house room and stockings hang beside it. Draco tells Harry later that he wished he could’ve take a photo of his life at that moment. That he'd never been so lucky.
Potter looks at him and looks back down at this potions book, the scribbles reminding him of Snape’s old textbook from sixth year. He says so.
, you’ll have to let me do the same for you.”
“Malfoy’s not an arse anymore,” Harry groans. “Well, he is, but not all the time. And now I’m tutoring him in Defense, and he’s supposed to be tutoring me in Potions, but he’s not doing a great job. And it’s not an issue for me to be around him
“You’re probably right,” Harry says, laughing a little. He waves to her and leaves the common room, waving to a few giggling girls in the corner. They blow him kisses, and he mimes catching them, pressing them to his heart. The girls squeal as he exits the room, and Harry has to hold in another laugh when he hears Hermione’s groan.
favorite activity. Although he was terrific at Charms, at Transfiguration, and at Potions, since the end of the war, Draco couldn’t get a hold on any spells in Defense Against the Dark Arts. (he presumed it was because Draco could never have any defense against the dark arts, it was too prominent in his bones) (Pansy promised he was wrong).
this is the first of many parts. because the chapters are short, i may think about combining the whole story into one long chapter to make it easier.
“Argh!”
“Piss off. No way.”
has to teach him? That was unacceptable.
Harry swings his legs over the side of the bed, feet planting on the floor. Getting up from bed seems to get harder every day, as if the loss of his other half sets in deeper as time passes. As if the missing limb of his body is aching in phantom pain, and the pain is chronic.
The answer seems obvious, as Malfoy sways on the edge of the tower.
She nods and smiles, “I guess I leave you
Draco raises his eyebrows at her and watches as she tunes back into her novel, obviously dismissing the older boy. He’s got no want to go to the Quidditch pitch and find out what’s going on, so he heads up to his dormitory. Being alone wasn’t one of Draco’s favorite activities (having spent too much time alone in the Manor), but the always gurgling water of the Lake, and the churning of the pipes down in the dungeons were a comforting sound, lulling him to sleep.
“Who’s… where did this come from?” Potter is excitedly flipping through the pages, the fun notes in the margins intriguing him. Draco doesn’t respond, turning back to his own book instead.
It took two weeks for Harry to realize that there wasn’t a lack of girls pining after him. Every corner he turned, there was another girl, big eyes watching his every move.
“Ok! I’m mixing the gingerbread cookies and they’ll be done in an hour, there’s eggnog in the fridge—”
Pansy smirks a little, “why of course we can.”
drop some comments to let me know what you think <3, i think i’d scream if you did so.
Draco looks up at Harry with watery eyes, “You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me.”
“I’ll do it. Let’s, let’s go Malfoy.” Vargas nods triumphantly, and turns back to grading, an obvious dismissal. Draco lets out an angry groan and stalks out of the room, Potter at his heels.
“I’ll take him!” Pansy cries softly, wrapping a manicured hand around Draco’s bicep. He keeps one hand on his nose as it aches, and shoots an angry look at Weasley. The other student raises his hands, “Hey! It’s not my fault. I didn’t know you were this
out of line. A third condition had been added yesterday; he must tutor Harry Potter. None of the NEWTS she’d listed in their meeting included Defense, and Draco is sure to remind Professor Vargas.
“You’re late.”
Harry’s biggest fears? Losing even more memories.
Potter had been healed by Pomfrey and sent back to class, and looks excited to be in the one class he excels at.
Draco nods, not deigning to reply. Sitting up, Pansy leaves a chaste kiss on his forehead, sweeping back his hair. She leaves the room with a sad smile, letting her best friend stew in his own thoughts.
“Of course not. You have mine, tosser.”
“Harry.”
“What?” Draco’s head snaps up, and he stares at Potter, jaw askew, “Snape… had a what?”
“It’s probably broken. Go down to the hospital wing,” Vargas waves a hand in Draco's direction, staunching the blood flow. Draco feels the class’s eyes upon him, Pansy chewing her lip in worry, and Blaise’s bemusement.
Ginny bursts into more laughter, and so does Harry, the irony of the situation hitting them both. Entangling their fingers, Harry places their hands on his stomach and sighs.“Thanks, Gin.”
Draco falls back on his bed, letting out a deep sigh. “Pansy, I’m so tired. Why are we
“Harry! Harry!” She’s chasing him through the hall, waving his forgotten glasses in the air. He spins around and sees the girl a few feet away from him, out of breath.
“You’ll… help me. For nothing in return?”
“That’s, that’s not your wand,” he says. Malfoy rolls his eyes and sneers.
“I… ”
This week it’s Sophie Roper, a pretty Gryffindor girl. She’s tall, almost taller than Harry (he had a growth spurt this past summer, just a couple inches). She’s got this beautiful blonde hair, always tied back, the few stray strands framing her usually smiling face.
Ginny pats the seat beside her, eyes bright from laughter. Settling down in the seat, Harry leans a head on Ginny’s shoulder, and she wraps an arm around him, their easy embrace a constant in Harry’s year. Even though they’d broken up, Harry can always count on Ginny to be
Harry was stubborn. He didn’t
“Well, I’ve got to get to Slughorn’s classroom. Thanks for everything!”
“Hey. Li? Su Li? Is that you?” Harry watched as the pretty girl in the back of the bookstacks stood from her cross-legged position, her face obscured by a sheet of dark hair. She pushes back the strands and smiles toothily at Harry, albeit a little taken aback that he’s spoken to her. Harry Potter had always been
“Merlin, Pansy, that was embarrassing,” he mutters.
Harry gags, and Draco shoots him a dirty look.
“Mr. Potter! What have you done?” Slughorn exclaims as he hurries over, wand out of his robes, and points it at Harry. He makes a few slashing movements with it, and the boiling liquid vanishes from Harry's face, leaving only burn marks. The ruined skin sits above Harry’s cheekbones and around his lips, dug into his cheeks and forehead, the skin red and tender. his brown skin is wrinkled and already itchy.
Malfoy pulls a face, “what an observation. I had no idea,” he spits, already tired of Harry’s company.
Harry loves his boyfriend, he does. He loves him with every fiber of his being, but some days are harder than others. He's tired. Too tired to listen to Draco chat about his day, to listen to him ask questions about Harry's day, to hear the politics of the city and the problems they may face in the upcoming year.
“What’s wrong, you tosser?” Ginny says, ruffling some of Harry’s hair. He lets out a content sigh.
Harry flips through girls like he’s trying to check off the Hogwarts student roster. But he’s kind about it, he’s never been anything but. Every girl knows that if Harry Potter approaches them, they get his memorizing attention for as long as they can keep it. The girls try hard, they try oh so hard, but Harry’s on top of the world, nothing can keep his attention (except for Ginny Weasley, of course, her smiles leave him with stars in his eyes).
Harry Potter looks upward, his eyes searching for lightning in the sky, a phenomenon only in the world outside of Hogwarts. His eyes catch onto a shadow atop the astronomy tower. A lone figure lined in black, standing at the very edge of the tower, bright white hair clear against the darkness of his background.
She quirks a smile at him, laughing, “I’ve just gone through
Slumping his shoulders, Draco tilts his head back, facing the ceiling, “yes, well. I’m not exactly sure why I did that.”
He slips into the Gryffindor common room, ignoring Hermione’s bewildered look at his return. Harry runs up the stairs and into his dormitory, flapping a hand at Ron, who looks like he’s just woken up from a nap. Throwing open his trunk, Harry sticks his hand inside, searching for the wand.
“Harry’s fine,” he says, smiling, trying to put the girl at ease, “what are you reading?”
Breakfast is easy without Draco. They almost never ate the first meal of the day together. Draco would leave the house earlier than Harry, grabbing a cup of coffee from the cafe around the corner, and Harry would eat a bowl of oatmeal and leave half an hour later.
broken yesterday. How did that even happen?”
She grabs Harry's arm & bag and takes him towards the door. Harry glances back and sees Ron watching him worriedly, Ginny giggling with her seventh-year friends, and the Slytherins not even looking his way, save for Malfoy. Malfoy watches him with wide eyes, skin remarkably paler than usual, but as soon as they make eye contact, Malfoy glances away. Harry's confused but turns back to Hermione, listening to her berate him as she drags him out into the halls. Nothing’s changed. Six years of potions blunders, of Hermione's berating, and then he’d gone and died, and still, nothing has changed. not a single thing. He hates it.
And then Harry has an idea. Draco’s mixing batter for the cookies and Harry grabs the wooden spoon from him. It drips batter on the floor and Draco sputters at Harry.
“How did he defeat the Dark Lord if he can’t even make a simple potion?” Pansy whispers harshly at his side. She continues to mutter in Draco’s ear as he chops his own beetroots. He rolls his eyes at her, “You’re just jealous because he won’t speak to you after you botched your apology.”
Malfoy nods violently, “when else would I have? When have
At the end of it all, Harry’s come to the simple conclusion, “It’s like Neville.”
And the older teenager turns slightly, tears streaming down his cheeks, but a wry smile on his pretty face. His robes are open, but with no shirt inside, revealing the ropey scars left by Harry in the bathroom.
“Well,” Harry says, wryly, “join the club.”
draco’s vitriol is still a little shocking
“That’s hogwash,” Potter narrows his eyes, “This is a two-way street. If you want to tutor
“When’s our first session?” Harry calls at Malfoy’s back but doesn’t receive an answer. Jogging after Malfoy, Harry repeats himself, “when?”
Ron snorts, “Of course I can. You used to look at him with disgust every day. At least, until he volunteered to tutor you. That’s strange, by the way. So why would you have given his wand back? And Harry, accio the damn wand, you’re a wizard.”
Slipping out of the library, Draco heads for the dungeons, his thoughts scrambled by the sight of Potter. He bursts into the Slytherin common room, the eerie quiet of it unsettling him. There is a lone girl in the corner, head buried in some thick tome. Draco doesn’t remember her name. Before Draco even has time to open his mouth, the young girl, who’s a fourth year, Draco’s sure of that much, says, “everyone’s down at the pitch.”
At the end of their hour, Malfoy looks close to collapsing, his magic
exercise,” and winks at him. The two teens burst into laughter as the rest of the hall watches them laugh.
“Sorry. I was… with a friend.” Potter’s ears flush slightly. He'd like to appear nonchalant, but his body seems to give him away.
“Hey! Hold the doors!” Harry watches Ron leap forward and shove the college shuttle door open so the tall boy yelling on the other side has time to jump on. It works. The other boy hops on board, his feet landing solidly on the grimy floor, until the bus lurches and he goes flying forward as well. This time Harry comes to the blond’s rescue, grabbing his arm and jerking him backwards, the two of them falling into another seat. The blond boy lands on Harry’s lap and scrambles forward, anxious to get out of the position. In Harry’s haste to get the boy off, Harry shoves him and he goes tumbling forward once again, this time without someone to catch him. The tall boy ends up on the floor, finally, and he looks up at Harry and Ron. The three of them burst out laughing. Harry’s still a little red from having this strange boy in his lap and the boy’s blonde hair is everywhere, after being thrown around the shuttle. The driver hasn’t even flinched. That brings another round of laughter. Harry lends the boy a hand in standing back up, and he quickly sits beside Harry, a smile on his pretty face.
“Nope, I don’t want to hear it,” he says, “Malfoy, I’m going to be honest with you here. You’re not going to pass your Defense NEWT at the rate you’re going right now.”
“Fine. Alright. Friday, 6 pm.”
Draco asks tiredly, “why won’t you just let me die?”
Harry's impulsive and once again forgets that not all people can be saved. He watches as the swatch of platinum hair tips off the side of the tower, and Harry lunges forward, no logical thought in his head except to save this boy. and he jumps off the edge of the tower, hurtling through the air.
“Bloody hell, Harry, don’t die on me now,” Ron murmurs in Harry's ear, prompting a smile from the struggling boy.
leave a kudos or a comment! it would make my day (or my week honestly). <3333
“I think the castle told me you were here. I looked up, and I just saw you. Maybe you could come down and greet me? Like a man?”
Dinner is the most difficult. Mondays and Wednesdays, Harry was in charge of coming home earlier and making dinner; Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays were usually Draco’s responsibility. They’d come home and make dinner or maybe buy it from a cheap restaurant on their street; each night treated like a date. Draco would laugh at his eccentric meals, recipes found from the depths of the internet. And Harry would fall a little bit more in love with Draco as he cooked (and baked!) foods that reminded Harry of home (of Hogwarts).
“Argh,” Draco groans as he is thrown forward from the force of Weasley’s spell interacting with his own.
Ginny slaps the back of his head, “Get to the point!” She says, laughing a little.
“Harry, there’s truly nothing you can do. Malfoy here has offered to tutor you, and I am happy to have you learn,” Slughorn advises gently.
“Are you going to tell me why you’re standing there?” Harry pushes, his mind scrambling for a solution. He could send a patronus to McGonagall, but that would spook Malfoy, and Harry decides against it, once again taking the weight of the world onto his own shoulders.
Harry laughs too. He hadn’t meant to go off on a tangent, but it seems that Malfoy brings out something in him. Settling back into Ginny’s arms, he says, “His presence isn’t disgusting anymore. And I’m not sure what to do about that.”
“Do the first part,” Draco replies, “but I don’t need you messing up my food!” He laughs a little at that and turns back to the kitchen. Harry doesn’t watch after Draco, instead walking to the shower.
But Harry pushes past the cloudy exhaustion at the front of his mind and pushes open the crusty apartment door. The strumming of guitar and loud bass meets his ears, the Arctic Monkey’s “Arabella” playing in the background of his apartment. He sees his boyfriend perched on the kitchen island and behind him, a completely clean kitchen. Some days Draco has bursts of energy and goes around cleaning and organizing the apartment (those days are the best for Harry's mental state). A steaming bowl of pasta sits on the counter beside Draco, obviously waiting for Harry. His boyfriend rapidly types on his phone, head bobbing to the rock music all around him. Draco swings his legs to the beat, the swishy fabric of the plaid pajamas he wears following. Draco reaches up to tuck a loose strand of hair behind his ear, and Harry sees Draco’s standard chipped nail polish. Draco paints his nails every week, but they seem to chip a few hours in, leaving him with perpetually old looking nails. This time, they’re a dark orange, contrasting with his pale skin tone. Draco looks up as Harry enters the apartment, a smile gracing his aristocratic features.
The day only seems to get worse, dueling the foremost task in Defense, Draco's
“Professor Slughorn, you needed something…?” Harry trails off as he sees Malfoy perched on a wooden stool.
Harry kisses Draco on the forehead, “Nothing to apologize for, my love. Let’s visit your friends this weekend?”
“Not sure. Might’ve burned in,” Potter pauses, “in the Fiendfyre.”
Harry feels an iota of shame and resigns himself to an even worse scolding from Madam Pomfrey.
Harry nods at her and stands, “Thanks ‘Mione. Don’t know what I’d do without you.”
“Yes,” he agrees, nodding. His head turns back to the clouds.
Holding up his hands, Harry says, “wait here. I’ll be right back!” Malfoy crosses his arms and glares. Harry jogs out of the empty classroom, feet hitting the ground as he goes.
“Come down, Malfoy.”
Draco leaves Harry in the entrance to the apartment, taking Harry’s things with him to their singular bedroom.
Malfoy glances off to the side, “Everything,” he mutters. “I can’t even cast a defense spell..”
“And what would I do without you, my love?”
the first session...
Malfoy stares at the boy in front of him and nods lightly.
“It’s going to be fine ‘Mione, right? It’ll be fine, right?” Harry says, rubbing his palms on his jeans.
the hero? But Harry was simply a powerful eighth year, terrifyingly terrible at Potions, and unmatched in Defense. Some days he was ordinary, and other days he felt like the most important person in the wizarding world.
Slowly, Malfoy reaches down to pick up the wand, and whispers, “Lumos.” The tip of the wand shines, almost blindingly. A smile breaks across Malfoy’s face, and he holds the wand close, cradling the wood to his chest.
first three chapters are un-beta'ed
Draco pulls a face and lets out a long sigh. He throws up his hands.
And then Harry blinks and he’s back in his crappy apartment, standing in the entrance to the room, work bag still hung on his shoulder, and kitchen counter dirty. There’s no music and it seems as if the apartment hasn’t been cleaned in months. He had been lucky. He’d been so lucky. And then he was unlucky, and it was all gone in a minute. A quiet, meek voice on the phone telling him of Draco’s passing, of his agonizing death, of the love of Harry’s life leaving his side too early. And he can’t help but remember the days he’d come and find someone waiting for him, someone who cared enough to ask about his day. Now he comes home to an empty apartment, peeling wallpaper, and the smell of days old pizza from inside the fridge
“This is still boring,” Potter mutters, and Draco rolls his eyes, ignoring him.
“Alright. So, er, what do you struggle with most during Defense?” Harry questions, his wand hanging loosely in his fingers.
beta’ed by
“Potter! Harry? How are you?” she says, hands clutching the fat book in her hands.
Draco wants to know when his time is. He wants to know when the pain will stop, he wants to know when the angry letters from his weak father will stop, he wants to know when the pleading letters from his strong mother will stop, he wants to know when it will
“Why aren’t you reading?” Draco asks, turning towards Potter.
“Piss off,” Malfoy mutters, and raises his wand at Harry’s face. Coming to a sudden realization, Harry pauses.
to meet other girls. He didn’t
Draco flinches and turns back to his notes. “Read your textbook.”
“Well, I’m not sure I can answer that,” she says. “But I know that you’ve enough skills to be alright in the world outside of this dusty castle.” She smiles and bumps his shoulder with hers, “and if you don’t, the Muggle world won’t know what’s about to hit them.”
“You read,” Draco responds flippantly, and buries himself in his own Potions book, attempting to prepare for the next day’s material. Potter is quiet, and out of the corner of Draco’s eye, he sees the other boy frowning into the book. A few minutes pass, and while Draco’s highlighting sections in his textbook, it seems as if Potter hasn’t read a single word. Draco can hear Potter muttering under his breath, but the other student hasn’t flipped a single page.
Harry rubs Draco’s back as he cries, whispers soothing words to Draco, letting him get all the tears out. They aren’t criers, but when they do, their other half is always there to support them through it all. Draco gasps a little in an attempt to control himself, and he sits up, his grey eyes red-rimmed.
He’s dissolving. He doesn’t realize it, but everyone else does. There is nothing they can do. Draco was his life line, his life force, his sun. Without Draco, it’s all Harry could do to wilt in his absence.
of our lives,” he corrects, “can we
It loved all its students, some more than the other, but today, it was grieving, and could not bear to lose another student widely beloved by the castle's magic. A few wisps of magic reach out, alerting another, another beloved student, one who the castle’s heart beat for.
“I… I was just asking?”
“Only if you can,” Blaise reminds, dragging his knuckles through Draco’s platinum hair, ruffling the thin strands.
“Looking for Malfoy’s wand. I never gave it back,” he turns to look at Ron, “can you believe that?”
“Didn’t you have Potions with him yesterday?”
“Oh, okay,” My phone interrupts us. It’s Pansy.
“Okay fine whatever Hermione, can you just leave us alone for now please.” She looked about to sob again but lifted her chin and said
“Is he single?”
“Wait, you mean you’re not taking a pregnancy potion?” Draco sits up straight and widens his eyes.
I see her pants are wet too now and I unfreeze and run to the floo. There is no answer at his office and then I remember that Hermione said he had been called out. I call head auror Robards and tell him what’s happened. He tells me he will try to get hold of Ron but it may take a while. So I tell him to send Ron straight to st mungos. Hermione wants her baby born in the hospital, whereas Draco still hasn’t decided.
“Oh merlin, are you okay?” I ask him, a little panicked.
“Please Harry. Fuck me please.” Wow he must really be gone if he’s speaking like this. I finish undoing his trousers and then take off his pants. His dick is lovely. It’s in a bed of fine white blonde hair and I can't wait any longer, I need to taste it. I bend down and lick a long strip from the bottom to the top. Draco moans loudly and thrusts up again. This time I’m not holding his hips but there’s nothing there for him to thrust into. I do it once more before I move further down. He spreads his legs further apart for me so I can see everything. I slowly lick below his balls and then latch on to his hole. He moans loudly again while calling my name. I can tell he loves this so i carry on licking it. Then I point my tongue and harden it while stabbing it into his hole. He goes crazy at this, moaning and thrusting and clenching. At this point I’m thrusting into the bed but can’t help it. I eventually remove my tongue and look up to see if he’s okay. We are both sweating and he looks absolutely shaggable.
I’ll be with you shortly.
“Yes.” He says through tears and now I’m starting to tear up. “I didn’t think my proposal would look like this. Me in my towel, 5 months pregnant, and no ring.” He burst out laughing which I join in with.
“Oh and she said we shouldn’t really tell anyone until the 12 week mark has passed, just in case...just in case anything happens.” He hugs up to me then and looks upset. Then I remember something.
“Yes.”
“Tomorrow, then,” he says to Weasley, who nods.
We carry on down the road, passed a beautiful church and towards the edge of the village. The houses get fewer and bigger. Then we pull into a driveway of a colonial-style mansion. It’s breathtaking, even down to the roses around the door. Picture-book perfect.
“No. I told you, I don’t sleep with anyone, except you when you’re stupefied with drink.” His voice is reprimanding.
He kissed my hand again and places it back in my lap. He climbs out of the car, comes around to my side, and opens the passenger-side door. Why do I feel suddenly bereft? A lump forms in my throat. I must not let him see me like this. Fixing a smile on my face, I clamber out of the car and head up the path to the nearest alleyway, knowing I have to face Pansy, dreading facing Pansy. I turn and gaze at him midway. Chin up, Malfoy. I chide myself.
“Yes.” He’s serious now.
“Dray, what’s wrong?”
“No clue. Said he’d be here. How’s baby Fred? Who’ve you left him with this time?” I ask both George and Angelina.
I blow Pansy a kiss and head out the door to find professor Mcgonagall. Even though we are adults now, we still have to inform Mcgonagall on our comings and goings, for safety or some shit.
“He’s been tired constantly. Any magic is draining him. He’s eating weird things. And he’s still always throwing up.” I tell her for him but he just frowns at me.
Until then, sleep well, baby.
Issues
He gets up suddenly and gives Leo to me. “Get on with the decorations.” He says and rushes inside.
“Thanks for trying to be quiet Molly. We really appreciate it.” I tell her and she kisses my cheek. We all get sat down and Draco passes Leo to Molly.
“Go ahead Harry. Thanks by the way. Would you like to stay for tea?”
Morning came soon enough and I was the first to wake for once. I looked over to Draco and put my arm around his stomach. He was so beautiful and pale it reminded me of snowflakes. I don’t know how long I was staring at him when he eventually fluttered his eyes open.
“Don’t say that again. Especially in this house.” Draco says and then picks him up. “Now, how do you like your room?”
“Excuse me,” I hear him murmur. He continues towards me and smiles briefly at Pansy.
Suddenly, the room erupts into applause as Miss Pansy Parkinson takes the stage. McGonagall sits, and Pansy tosses her lovely long hair behind her as she places her parchment on the lectern. It took Pansy years to grow her hair out from the bob her parents insisted on.
“I have never had any muggle blood transfusions. Does that answer your question?”
“Merlin, Harry. Is she okay? Is Ron there yet?” Draco asks me, sounding panicked.
“No - I’ll do this on my own, thank you very much.” I snap at him, pulling the duvet up to my chin.
“How about something stronger?” He says back. “I think we are going to need it.”
“No Draco, it's fine. You can’t watch over me all the time and if you want to leave one day then you can’t think all about me, you need to think of yourself.”
“It’s a completely over-the-top gift. I can’t accept it, especially now.” I grin at Pansy, and she nods.
Draco was better at this than I thought he would be and finished the windows in no time. I get down off the ladder and admire his handwork.
“Draco,” he whispers. “What are you doing to me?”
“Shall we sit?” I said to Draco and led him over to the sofa in the corner of the room. It was an old but comfy sofa and as soon as you sat down, you would instantly slide into the middle. So me, Draco and baby Lucy were all squished in together. She was sat on Draco’s knee facing us and laughing at the funny faces he was making. He really was good with kids and I’ve never really noticed before.
He frowns. “You’d think I’d coerce you into something you don't want to do, and then pretend that I have a legal hold over you?”
“Yes. She will.”
“What’s he like?” Potter says softly.
“Just so you know, I can run quite fast, and I can apparate out even faster." He winks at me.
Let me know if you’re okay.
Harry was hungry once.
I fall through the floo into Andromeda’s sitting room. I’m instantly assaulted by screaming cries. I lookup and see a messy, tired looking andromeda trying to shush a screaming Teddy.
Holy shit! They must be worth a fortune and I immediately know who they are from. Pansy is reading from over my shoulder.
“Yeah I’m starving, can we go soon.” I laugh and help him up.
Weasley nods at me.
“It means you cannot disclose anything about us. Anything, to anyone.”
“Hey babe, you coming in the water?” I ask Draco, sitting up.
“I hope so.”
I head up to the nursery and look in the cot. All I see is an empty bag though. Fucks sake Ron!
“Thank you Hermione, as is your daughter.” He smiles at the baby again and then at Hermione.
“A man can dream, Draco.” He leans over me and grasps my chin. “Wednesday?” he murmurs, and he kisses me lightly on my lips.
Harry Potter
No acts involving medical instruments.
“Teddy! You're not supposed to say that word! It’s very naughty.” I tell him off.
“Ravenclaw?” Ginny looks back from Nia to Harry. I laugh and nod.
“You okay?”
“Good guess little sister.” He says and writes it on our side of the white board.
I go back into Hermione and she is moaning loudly in pain.
“Me.” He says simply.
“Did pansy, I mean, Miss Parkinson, explain what the interview was for?”
“I don't remember reading about nipple clamps in the Bible. Perhaps you were taught from a modern translation.”
Harry Potter
“I did, but it only works some of the time healer Bell said. And she said apparation will definitely cause sickness in very bad cases, apparently like mine. I’m okay through, let's get our home started.” He takes my hand and pulls me into the house this time.
“Go?” He can’t hide his surprise.
“I know nothing about wine, Harry. I’m sure it will be fine.” My voice is soft and hesitant. My heart is beating wildly and I want to run. This is seriously rich and I have no clue what I’m doing here. Oh yes, I want to be in Harry Potter's bed.

“You still talk to her regularly?” I can’t keep the shock out of my voice.
Our three youngest come in from the kitchen then, to see their brothers and sister. There is Phoenix who is 10. We think he’s a gryffindor too. He has Draco’s hair and his grey eyes. Then there is Orion, who is 7 and obsessed with exploring. He’s definity a ravenclaw. Me and Draco have agreed on that since he was 2. He has my hair and Draco’s eyes. And then there is 3 year old Ophelia. Our little hufflepuff. She has my mother's ginger hair and Draco’s eyes. The twins look the spitting image of Leo with their blonde hair and green eyes. And Lily has my black hair but straight like Draco’s with my green eyes.
“No.” He shakes his head and smiles indulgently at me. “She’s a very good friend.”
15.21: Discipline - please see clause 15.5 above.
This place is such a mess, I don’t even know where the wipes are. I look in the nursery and they aren’t there so I go into our room. They are in the Moses basket, no wonder I didn’t pick them up. I also pick up his tiny dragon teddy I got him just before he was born. He loves the thing already.
“I’m sorry, I was overtaken by events.”
“Suck it Weasley!” Draco shouts. Ron just sits there and stares at the board.
Next time I come up the stairs is with Katie in tow. Draco is having another contraction and I rush to him to hold his hand.
When I resurface I go straight for him but stop as soon as I see his face.
“Dray, why didn't you text me last night?” She’s angry.
“Sure.” I try to sound disinterested.
“What do you say to that, Mr Malfoy?”
Holy fuck….why has Severus picked today to be so observant and actually comment on things?
He leads me through the hallway and into the kitchen, where Luna and Lily are chatting while getting more alcohol. Pigtails is nowhere to be seen.
“That’s if you want to stay.” he adds. I glance up at him, trying to recover my equilibrium. His expression is unreadable. It’s so frustrating.
“Bye Teddy, be good for uncle Harry.”
“Sounds good, I've got to get back to work now. I’ll just grab your food.”

If the Dominant so requires, the Submissive shall wear during the Term any adornments the Dominant shall require, in the presence of the Dominant and at any other time the Dominant deems fit.
“I do love you.” He whispers with his cheek pressed against mine and our arms around each other. I chuckle and say the only thing I’m thinking.
I nod, and he gives my hand another reassuring squeeze.
I refer to my email dated May 24, sent at 1:27 and the definition contained therein.
“Wednesday.” he confirms, and he leans forward and kisses me softly. Something changes while he’s kissing me; his lips grow more urgent against mine, his hand moves up from my chin and he’s holding the side of my head, his other hand on the other side. His breathing accelerates. He deepens the kiss, leaning into me. I put my hands on his arms. I want to run them through his hair, but I resist, knowing that he won’t like it. He leans his forehead against mine, his eyes closed, his voice strained.
“Yes mistress Tonks.” It still hurts to hear that name.
“Good evening, Mr Malfoy.” He says.
“Eclectic taste, Mr Malfoy,” he murmurs, and he paces towards me like a panther until he’s standing in front of me. His gaze so intense it takes my breath away.
“Okay, let's have a look shall we? If you can lie down on your back and spread your legs please.” He does as told without so much as a blush. He must really be tired and in pain.
“That’s it?” Potter asks.
"Rolf is a lovely young man and a great friend to Luna. They like all the same things and have been inseparable since they met. He is the grandson of Newt Scamander, the person who wrote Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find them." Lily provides us with the information. I smile at Luna and just know that she will end up marrying the guy, even if it takes a while for them both to realise it. Even though I don't know her well, and don't know Rolf at all, I can see it in her eyes and he blush and her smile. We all go back to eating.
“I’d better go rescue Sev, or Harry. I don't know which. You haven't heard the last of this, Pansy Parkinson!” I glare at her.
“We have a termite problem Teddy. But as soon as we have cleared them out, you are welcome to come.” Draco says for me. He talks so easily, I’m grateful one of us can.
“I will be back in a minute.”
“Blaise Zabini, are you trying to get me drunk?” I lift my eyebrow at him and then burst out laughing. “Because it is definitely working.”
Hope everyone is still enjoying this. Three more chapter to go after this one. Thank you for all the kudos and comments, they have really kept me going. X
Mr Potter returns.

“What for?”
Draco Malfoy
“Yes maybe the colour, but it is starting to be just as messy as yours.” Draco says then. We all laugh and Teddy changes his hair colour from blue to black. I wink at him and scruff it up.
“Hey! You’ve always said you believe my gut instincts.” I shouted across desks.
15.6    In training and in the administration of discipline the Dominant shall ensure that no permanent marks are made upon the Submissive’s body nor any injuries incurred that may require medical attention.
“You are so dramatic.” He kisses me on the cheek. “I still love you though. And you are very kind to help Hermione by looking after crookshanks. They don’t get a lot of time to themselves nowadays.” He was putting the ointment on now but looked far away.
“Nia, how did you survive so long on your own?” I ask her next.
“You, please.”
“Why did you use a cable tie?”
He gives me a wicked grin, the effects of which travel all the way to my cock.
“Okay are you ready?” I have to ask.
He grins at me.
“I feel different. Sore.” I confess.
It’s been a hard day for both of us. Hopefully tomorrow will be better.
“Well i just had to do something and then i came straight here. I practically ran here actually.” I tried to comfort.
“Oh Harry I’m so sorry.” Hermione says and hugs me.
“Not to worry Harry. I’m sure she can make time for you.”
“Because I want to do this with you, very much.”
“I wanted to do something nice for you for once.” He says and lines his hips up with mine. He obviously wants to top tonight and I am fine with that. It isn’t often Draco prefers to top but when he does the sex is always great.
“Yeah i remember, and you nearly had one yourself just from seeing me.” I laughed a bit harder and looked over to Draco. He looked like he was remembering and started to smile and laugh a bit.
“Oh I just thought you would be tired, love.” I wrap my arm around him and give him a kiss on the cheek.
This chapter is set in the past and is quite sad. X
May 25 22:01
“Your company or your company?” I smirk at him, trying to change the subject.
The day drags at the pub. We aren’t very busy and it’s a slow day. The summer season is starting so everyone wants to be outside. It starts to get a bit busier during a dinner rush though. All the spare time I’ve had has given me time to think.
“You’re right sorry. You and Katie know best, you just worried me a bit. But you are right and this should be together.” He kissed my cheek lightly.
“Not full time. Just, say, Friday evening through Sunday. We have to talk about all that, negotiate. If you want to do this.” He adds, his voice quiet and hesitant.
“Good.”
CEO, Potter Enterprises Holding, Inc.
All of a sudden the air shifts in the room and then every single thing in the room, including me and him, is floating a few feet off the ground. I turn wide eyed to him and realise he has done this wandlessly and wordlessly. He has done it without so much as blinking. Wow.
“Just to apologise, you know - for Friday.”
“How about the flower park Teddy?” I ask him.
Dear Mr Malfoy,
“Leo is too young Teddy, but I can push you while he watches.” Draco says and Teddy nods. I get Leo out his pram and hold him in my arms so Teddy thinks he’s watching, but he’s fast asleep anyway.
“So at 11 weeks you might feel a bit hungrier. You will start showing, which I see you already have.” He really has started to show properly now, it’s quite noticeable. I don’t know how longs he’s going to be able to hide this. “You will still be tired, probably through the pregnancy. But your sickness should at least reduce in the next couple of weeks, which is good news. Do you have any questions?”
“Yes, you could easily, but I don't want you to.”
He’s no gentleman. He has my boxers.
“How about you?”
“Draco, I’m going to cum in your mouth.” his breathy tone is warning. “If you don't want me to, stop now.” He thrusts his hips again, his eyes wide, wary, and filled with salacious need - need for me. Need for my mouth….oh fuck.
“Have you ever hurt anyone?”
“Harry? Is it okay if I get the rest of Draco’s boxes? Then at least that’s done.” Nia offers kindly.
“You don’t get that privilege anymore Dragon.” He turns back around and shoves a pillow at me.
“You okay love?” Ron asks Hermione. She nods and gets up to give him a kiss. Then she comes over and gently takes Rose from Draco.
More fireworks go off then and we look up. We keep hold of each other and watch the display. There are babies everywhere and a huge congratulations, there's dummies and bottles and prams, and cots and teddy’s everywhere.
“Shall I give you a tour of the grounds?” he asks me quite openly.
“Have you done that before?”
“Wait, keep rubbing. I think I can feel little chéri moving!” He says excitedly. I place my hand back but can’t feel anything.
Oh! Turning to face him, I’m shocked to find he has his erection firmly in his grasp. My mouth drops open.
“Ah.” I groan.
“The R8.”
Hermione opens the door and gives me a strange look as if to say ‘what the hell are you doing here looking so gloomy when you should be celebrating with Draco’. I guess me and Hermione could read each other too.
“Yes, Pansy.”
“Looks good, doesn’t it?” Harry murmurs.
We all finish our drink and I ask Nia more questions. Then I tell Nia we are starting on the next room and she is welcome to stay. She says she wants to help clean and so we all get started on the office room.
“Yeah. It’s just these stupid hormones are going crazy. It doesn’t help with a baby sat on my knee.” He starts crying then and I don’t know what to do. He never cries in front of people, what if they work out he’s pregnant, or think I've upset him.
“Where’s Ron?!” Hermione cries out then. She’s clearly in pain and exhausted.
“No thank you.” I frown and stare down at my tea.
“You invest in manufacturing with muggles. Why, specifically?” I ask and glance back at him. Why is he making me so uncomfortable and what's with the staring.
“Can I feel?” He asks innocently.
“That’ll be Blaise.”
“Thanks.”
“But you went behind my back. And anyway, my mother doesn’t know what I have going on. And as a matter of fact I am busy next Friday. So no I won't be joining you.” He gets up and goes over to the drinks cabinet. Why is he making such a fuss about this, and Narcissa swore he had nothing planned. Why was he trying to get out of this?
“Hi,” he says. “How are you feeling?” His eyes are alight with amusement.
“Because I’m going to spank you and then fuck you.”
“I suppose it does, well done.” I tell him.
The room had seemed to freeze when Katie had walked in, but now I could hear Draco’s breathing getting heavier and heavier. I turn round, facing away from Katie, and take his face in my hands.
“Yes please Harry.” Hermione says and then Molly stands up.
“Bye.” I give her a heartfelt smile and then she is gone.
“Yes please. I worked on it last night over in Millie's room. I’ll go fetch it. And yes, I’d love some tea.” Pansy races out of the kitchen.
“Why can’t you explain now?”
“Keep still.” he orders, his voice soft but urgent, and strokes up once more and releases. Before I can complain, he has inserted two fingers into me and has instantly found my prostate. He rubs his fingers around and around it and the effect is mind blowing. All my energy concentrating on this one small space inside my body. I moan.
“Pushover.” He says under his breath which makes me laugh. “Healer bell said we can find out the sex when I’m about 18 weeks gone, but…”
He stops and gazes down at me, his expression unfathomable.
“Harry james potter, I swear to merlin. You never listen to me!”  Before he can say anything else, I shove the box at him.

“You work fast.” I tell him while going to pick my own paintbrush up.
“I was in the area,” he says as way of explanation. “I thought I’d get a drink and maybe something to eat. It’s great to see you again Mr Malfoy.” His voice is warm and slightly husky.
“OMG guys! That’s fantastic!” She pressed her ear to the dragon to listen more closely.
“Blaise! Great to see you...and alcohol.” I stare lustily at the firewhiskey in his hand. He chuckles and pulls me into a hug. He is a lot taller and muscular than me and I am suddenly wrapped around entirely by him. Blaise is a fellow slytherin and is also gay, so we clicked instantly. Also our fathers know each other and have gotten back in touch since we became close. Blaise stayed on at Hogwarts university too but he does engineering, although his real passion is photography. He mainly does wizard photos but with a push from Pansy he has been developing his skills with muggle cameras. The pictures don’t move but they can be just as beautiful.
“Should we go down?”
“Greenhouse!”
“Yeah. He screamed at me, Hermione. He was so angry, like we were back in Hogwarts. He just never wants to take the next step with us and I don’t think I can carry on like this. We never see each other and it's so shit!” Great now I’m tearing up thinking of losing Draco. I wipe my eyes and look at her. “Maybe this whole house thing was a mistake.”
“Please pass me my joggers.”
“We start by going inside.” I take his hand and quickly pull him along. He tries to hold back and dig his heels in but with all my auror training I am far stronger and he knows this by now so gives up quickly and lets me drag him through our front door.
“What do you want, Draco?”
I hadn’t even realised Hermione had got up and walked over to fix my tie until she had her hands on it. “You’re smiling Harry.” She said while smiling up at me. “You really like him don’t you?”
“How would you like your eggs?” I ask tartly. He smiles.
“I’ve really enjoyed this weekend.” I murmur. He narrows his eyes at me again.
“No love! Never take it off again.” He blushes and kisses my cheek while whispering.
“Yeah sounds great!” I give him a kiss on the cheek and grab my bag.
“I think you’ve seen too much.” He chuckles slyly. He sits astride me again, pulls my t-shirt up, and I think he’s going to take it off me, but he rolls it up to my neck and then pulls it up over my head so he can see my mouth and my nose, but it covers my eyes. And because it’s folded over, I cannot see a thing through it.
Suddenly, he sits up and pulls his boxers off and throws them to the floor. His cock springs free. Holy shit…. He reaches over to the bedside table and grabs a foil packet, and then moves between my legs, spreading them farther apart. He kneels up and pulls a condom onto his considerable length and lubes it up. Oh no...will it? How?
I decide now is a good time to step out, so I leave quietly. Just as I’m at the door a hand on my shoulder turns me around. And then Ron is hugging me with a death grip.
“You don't think very highly of me, do you?”
“Surely Hermione gave you a schedule for him?” Draco asks as we peek our heads around the door, to see crookshanks curled up sleeping exactly where Draco told him to stay.
Ron must have asked the same because he follows me while Hermione stays with Draco. She is a lot bigger now but still smaller than Draco, which was confirmed when she was measured.
“My mother liked you.” he says dryly.
Suddenly there is a pop of apparition behind us and I spin around going for my wand. But it’s just a worried looking Andy and a crying Teddy.
“Right, ask Blaise about the shoot, we both know he’ll do anything for you, and call Potter to see if he will do Hogwarts.” I roll my eyes at her again for making a dig about Blaise….again.
“What?”
“No, I’ve never left the UK.”
“I thought you said you were going to see him on Wednesday?”
Holy shit. He grabs my left foot, bends my knee, and brings my foot to his mouth. Watching and assessing my every reaction, he tenderly kisses each toe, then bites each one of them softly on the pads. When he reaches my little toe, he botes harder, and I convulse, whimpering. He glides his tongue up my instep - and I can no longer watch him. It’s too erotic. I’m going to combust. I squeeze my eyes shut and try to absorb and manage all the sensations he’s creating. He kisses my ankle and trails kisses up my calf to my knee, stopping just above. He then starts on my right food, repeating the whole, seductive, mind-blowing process.
“I haven't looked at my laptop today, or my phone.” Crap, has he been trying to call? I try my distraction technique that’s so effective on Pansy. “That was a great speech.”
“Hey. You’re not being a pain,” he raised a pointy eyebrow at me for saying that, “you’re not! I swear. In fact I find it funny and kind of adorable.” I laugh sweetly at him.
We’ve still got a couple of hours before we need to be at st mungos so if Draco’s still asleep I’m going to leave him for another hour. I head up the stairs and can’t hear anything so he probably is still asleep. I pop my head around the bedroom door but he’s not there. So I checked the bathroom but no luck there either. There’s a chance I could have missed him downstairs though. I check a few rooms on the way down including the library but there’s no sign of him. I get downstairs and head through to the kitchen, which is empty but the back door is slightly ajar. I released the breath I didn’t realise I was holding and set off outside. Draco’s lying on a blanket on the grass with a warming charm over him. He looks so peaceful, just staring at the sky, I decide to not disturb him and just watch him for now. After about five minutes Draco signs and turns his head slightly to look at me.
Draco licks the back of my ear and thrusts his hips forward. I fall forward a bit and save myself on the door, where I’ve just hung my coat.
“I wish I could, but me and Nia are really busy.” I tell her and hug her and Fred.
“Merlin, are you okay?” He leans on one hand and uses his other to push some strands of hair out my eyes. He moves his fingers from my hair down my face and brushes my lower lip. My breath hitches and I have a very non discrete bulge in my pants which I hope he doesn’t notice.
“Definitely.” He says and we head out. I write Nia a little note on the door before we leave, just in case she wants to talk. I tell her we will be back tomorrow and would love to see her again. I don’t know if she will see it or even if she will still be here in the morning but I hope she is.
“I know uncle Harry, and I love you and uncle Draco too. Goodnight.” He says with a yawn and turns over. I shut the door and head downstairs to collect Draco.
May 23 17:53
Suddenly we are tilting and the front wheel is off the ground. I think he’s trying to do a trick to impress me but I just close my eyes and hide my face in his shoulder. Please don’t die, please don’t die, please don’t die. This is all I can think for the next few minutes until Harry's voice brings me back and I realise that the ride isn't as bumpy anymore but the wind is turning my fingers to ice.
“She didn’t even hear me.” He says and turns to go into the kitchen.
“Yeah!” We walk the long way around to the pond. Through the trees and past the flowers.
Internet! I don't have access to a computer, only Pansy’s laptop, and I couldn’t use the school's ones, not for this sort of ‘research’ surely.
“That one there,” he says and points to a nice sized, two story house with a small gate and hedges surrounding the front garden, “that was my parents first house. They loved it here but needed a bigger house when Luna came along. So they got one built at the edge of the village.”
This house is gonna be it for us. It’s either going to make us or break us, and as we walk through the wonky front door to see what lies beyond, I think to myself, this may break us after all. The past couple of weeks have been quite tense. Draco’s been in a pissy mood and I’ve had to work overtime, which is probably why he’s in a pissy mood but I can't help it, it's my job. I told him when we got into this relationship, 3 years ago, that I took my job very seriously and it was very demanding being an auror. I thought he understood that and it has worked well up until last month. He started complaining that i was never home for tea and that he hardly saw me, with him leaving early to get to his potions store and me getting home late. He asked me how I expected to raise a family like this, which thus caused one of our biggest fights in a while. He doesn’t understand what it means to me to be an auror and catch the bad guys and keep people safe. I need it and he doesn’t understand that. He avoided me for 2 weeks, and because we don’t live together that made it possible for him to avoid me. That’s when I started thinking about a home and living together. If I’d known I’d end up buying this place then I would have hit myself across the head and told myself it was a bad idea.
“So Nia, you seem a lot better than yesterday. How are you taking it all?” I ask her in a friendly voice. I don’t want her to close up again like yesterday.
“Very well. Tea?”
“So you have any idea how much I want you, Draco Malfoy?” he whispers. My breath hitches. I cannot take my eyes off his. He reaches up and gently runs his fingers down my cheek to my chin.
“Thanks a lot Kreacher.” With that, I gave him a quick nod and went to fetch my clothes. I heard him disapparate and quickly jumped in the shower. It was one of the quickest showers I’ve ever had and when i got out i spelled myself dry including my hair which I don’t usually do as it leaves it more of a mess than towel drying it. I try to tame it with a couple of spells and some gel but that’s as good as I will get it. I finish getting dressed and head to the kitchen to get the bottle of wine I bought for tonight. I grab it and turn around quickly to head to the floo when I nearly slam into Draco and drop the bottle of wine. It smashes all over the newly cleaned floor.
To distract myself from the anxiety that blooms in my belly, I start doing what I told Pansy I would be doing - packing up my room. I begin by shrinking my books and putting them in my trunk. By nine, I’ve heard nothing.
I glance up at him and he is his usual polite, slightly distant self. How confusing can he get? We come to a stop in a deserted alleyway and he turns to me. For a moment I think he might kiss me again. He looks at me with those intense green eyes and the air around us changes. But instead he takes my hand in his and I feel the familiar pull of apparation.
“You can leave anytime. The motorbike is on standby to take you whenever you want to go; you can stay the night and go home in the morning. It’s fine whatever you decide.”
“No! You think I wouldn't tell you if the baby was born, silly.” I tickle him and put him down. “He’s on bed rest until the baby is born. Do you want to go see him?” He nods and I take his hand. “You coming Andy?” I turn and ask her.
“What are you doing for work in London?”
“Yeah, you did good for that kid mate.” Ron says to me. “You’ll be an expert with yours.”
“Love you too, Mother. Do say hello to father for me won’t you, and tell him I hope he gets better fast.” I try to keep the venom out of my words but I see my Mother flinch and regret it immediately.
“Draco, so help me. Where the fuck are you?!”
“Come on then. But shush, uncle Dracos asleep.” I lie back down and Draco rolls back over to cuddle me. Then Teddy cuddles up to me on the other side and I fall back to sleep quickly.
“Okay, if your friend would like to step away from you while I do the spell.” I release her hand and step back. As soon as it’s done I step back in.
When I glance up he is staring at me and leaning against the doorway with one hand on the wall next to the elevator. As smug as ever. Although he is very very good looking, and this is very very unnerving.
I glare at him.
“Finally!” I throw my hands up. “You know I need a shower too, right?” I ask him sarcastically.
I look up and he cocks his head to he side.
He opens the door, and I head out. My mind is whirling. All the professors, and Pansy, stare at me as I walk hastily past them.
Decided to add two chapters today, so enjoy! X
“Trust me?” he breathes.
“Mrs Potter,” I murmur.
“... So now they all know he’s pregnant and Ron just walked off and Draco’s locked me out.” I tell her, she is awfully quiet so I look up and she looks pale. “Are you okay Narcissa?”
“You’re right. I do. In life you use what you know, Draco. Doesn't change how much I want you. Here. Now.”
Exercise:
“So you wanna live here?” I ask him. He grins at me through the tears.
“Oh….baby…..that feels so good.” he murmurs. I suck harder, flicking my tongue across the head of his impressive cock. Wrapping my teeth  behind my lips, I clamp my mouth around him. His breath hisses between his teeth, and he groans.
“Pansy was ill,” I murmur. It’s all I can manage.
“I’ll tell you but you can’t tell anyone else. I’m telling everyone on Sunday at Mollys. We just want this week to ourselves.” They both nod so I carry on. “His name is Leo James Potter.” Hermione starts crying again and Ron hugs her close.
“-shouldn’t be worried Draco. You're in good hands.” Hermione tells him.
“Thanks Katie.”
“So I’m told. I was only 1 when she died, but your daddy knew her. He was best friends with my dad and he told me a bit about them.” I get down to my knees and speak to him.
Can we go through all of these? No fisting. What is suspension? Genital clamps - you have got to be kidding me.

“You are a greedy boy.” he scolds, and his thumb slowly plays with my balls, circling and pressing down.
After everyone has said their goodbyes and left, me and Draco sit on the pouch steps. He rests his head on my shoulder and kisses me.
“Harryyyy…” he moans at me.
He takes a deep breath.
“I’m going to return them to him.”
“Blaise, I love you dearly, you mean so much to me. You’re like the brother I never had. That’s not going to change. You know that.” I hate to let him down, but it’s the truth.
He frowns.
Then for pudding he had outdone himself and made me a homemade treacle tart. This man, who people still call a death eater and a killer years after the war, has done the nicest thing anyone has done for me in a long time. It has taken time and energy and lots of practise, but he did it and he did it for me.
“I’d say he’s completely smitten with you.”
We walk in through the back door and it’s fairly quiet. Me and Draco look at each other and frown. Then Molly comes into the kitchen with a plate of biscuits, humming quietly. She sees us and jumps, causing her to drop the plate. It smashes on the floor and the noise wakes Leo. He starts crying from being startled. Draco’s holding him this time and starts rocking him.
"Yes but, Harry, with the exception of you and this other person ages ago, no one has accidentally time traveled. It took the Unspeakables hundreds of years and cooperation with other Unspeakables around the world to formulate time turners that were safe for public use.
His mum's laugh is so beautiful. Her eyes sparkled as she elbowed his dad, and if he closes his eyes, Harry can almost imagine those same eyes sparkling down at him as a baby. Except, of course he can't. It's fake, just his imagination. She'll never elbow him when he misbehaves at an event, she'll never tell him she loves him. She'll never hug him when he's feeling like this.
Harry shakes his head and settles down in the chair facing Dumbledore’s desk. There are a lot of interesting things to look at in order to avoid the Headmaster’s piercing gaze.
“Yes…”
Draco sighed. "It's not a matter of if he can stay but if he wants to."
Hermione hums. "Could be. Anyway, Madam Pomfrey said she just needs to do one final check on your hand and we can go down to the feast!"
Harry stares up at his friend blearily. His glasses are...somewhere, but Ron's close enough that he can see him fairly clearly.
“Do you believe me?” Harry asked, oblivious.
,” Draco tells him. “Uncle Severus brought it for me this morning, so I can get ahead of the class.”
It's starting to seem like his most boring trip ever when he notices the professor pause in front of an attractive Slytherin boy with dark hair. If his trips have meaning, this interaction has to be the point of this one.
"I am not!"
Harry grins. "And you aren't 25. But I was born in 1980."
She watched him pull on one of the magical cloaks that gave him short brown hair and a full beard and take care of the customer, a man who needed a throat salve for his sick daughter.
"And I definitely said I had a wife?"
“D-Dra-”
The weight over him suddenly disappears as Harry stands up abruptly. “I have to go, I had so much fun to-”
As much as she has tried to repress her knowledge of the magical world, she knows that disappearing babies are abnormal, even among witches and wizards. Lily certainly never disappeared when they were children.
Harry arrives somewhere warm and loud. He's lucky to have landed (appeared?) in an empty space, as the room is packed with unfamiliar people. He hurries to a corner to make sure no one bumps into him, then takes stock. He's got both shoes on and his wand still in his hand, but his tie and school robes are missing. He's not overly worried, though. He's still under the invisibility cloak and his tie and robes will be back in the alcove with his school bag.
"You have no idea how much you've let slip during your visits."
“Well, not very far in the future. The furthest I've traveled into the future was two years or so, and that’s already in my past. But I guess most of my life is in your future.” He runs a hand through his messy hair, messing it up further. “It’s quite confusing.”
He pulls out the journal Hermione gave him last year for Christmas and flips through until he finds the entry he's looking for. He had annotated it since the discussion a few months ago about keeping his belongings as he traveled, so now it reads:
“He clearly wants to be,” Draco grumbled. “I don’t think he’s even noticed that his curse scar is healing now.” He paused, staring at her logs with an unfocused gaze.
"There's no point arguing about it now," Harry points out. "I can't control when or where I travel to, and it's hard enough making sure all my clothes come with me. Though there's a chance I could find out who the Heir of Slytherin is."
“What?”
"I assure you that it is, Mr. Potter. Now would you please return to your dormitories." She casts a nonverbal spell and her books fly up neatly into her arms. With a stern look, she escorts them outside.
"If you did something like that, when you came back everyone would be living in the changed timeline, and you would be the only person to know what was different, if you even bothered to check. It could be something big like people disappearing, but it could also be something small that will eventually change the future, like if in the new timeline you do detention with Snape, but in the old timeline some others have detention, form a bond and create a new friendship. In this timeline that never happened, and maybe they never become friends? There are always consequences, Harry. It's just that we might not see them."
His dad opens his mouth to respond, but his mum elbows him in the side with a grin and gestures towards Dumbledore, who's starting to address everyone.
Harry appears on a crushed stone covered path, surrounded by roses and partially bordered by hedges. He sits up and looks around, pleased at the fresh air and sunshine that now surrounds him.
They continued on until all of the clouds had blown away, leaving just a clear blue sky.
Draco Malfoy is busy practicing writing his letters in his room when he hears a soft popping noise behind him. He looks up, eager to be distracted from the work his tutor has set him. There is a man in odd clothes standing in the middle of his bedroom, his wand drawn and a shimmering shield around him. He doesn't look scary or angry though, and when he sees Draco he drops the shield and puts his wand away with a smile.
"Thank Merlin," Ron breathes. "I thought you'd gotten attacked. But-" He seems to realise that Harry's been crying, and his face grows pale. "What's- What did you see?"
"I'm sure they do, Draco. I just didn't have one growing up. As silly as it is, you and I are the same age."
Somehow, despite the surprise of Dobby and being blocked from Platform 9 ¾ and crashing Mr. Weasley’s Ford Anglia into the Whomping Willow, Harry forgets that his time traveling ability doesn’t show him clues to everything important that’s going to happen.
“You should write this all down, Harry,” Hermione tells him as they enter the Great Hall. “I think your magic is doing this for a reason, and I think your trips may contain important information for your life and your future. Why else would you travel seventy years in the past directly to the man we’ve been trying to find?”
“Harry, we need to go to mine first and get my bag. It’s already packed.” He tells me and I lead her to the floo.
“I’ve never slept with anyone, never had sex in my bed, never flown anyone on Charlie Tango, never introduced anyone to my mother. What are you doing to me?” His eyes burn, their intensity takes my breath away.
“Nooo!” Me and Ginny shout and everyone laughs at us.
His hands are really gripping my hair. I can do this. I push even harder and, in a moment of extraordinary confidence, I bare my teeth. It tips him over the edge. He cries out and stills, and I can feel his warm, salty cum oozing down my throat. I swallow quickly. ugh….I’m not sure about this. But one look at him, and I don't care - he’s come apart in the bath because of me. I sit back and watch him, a triumphant, gloating smile tugging at the corners of my lips. His breathing is ragged. Opening his eyes, he glares at me.
“Um, no I-”. I put my hand in his and we shake. He can’t be over 30 years old and I’m in a daze. As we touch I feel an exhilarating shiver run through me and hastily remove my hand from his, still and even more so embarrassed. I figure it must be the static from my scrape on the floor and blink down at the floor.
We get down and get to work then, finishing the last bits of painting in the kitchen. As we are finishing up, I hear the piano again. I leave Nia to finish her bit and head to the music room to find Draco. He’s sitting at the piano playing like he’s alone in the whole world. I go up to him and take a seat next to him on the bench. He briefly stops, sees me and carries on.
“Not that keen on it.” He just smiles at that.
“Do you have a philosophy? If so, what is it?” I ask him, reading from the parchment again.
“Will I-“ she’s cut off by the sound of apparation.
“Draco, darling, I’m so sorry.” Mother whines into the fireplace.
I stand up and go to the door.
“I just don't.” He reaches over and plants a soft kiss on my forehead. “So, that email was your idea of a joke.”
“Yes.”
He is so controlling. I stare at him and he runs a hand through his hair. He looks frustrated and angry. What’s his problem? Oh right, he has to deal with my drunk arse. I sway a little and he puts his hand on my shoulder to steady me. I feel a bit guilty then and so drink the water, all of it. I may have drunk it too fast though and now feel slightly queasy. I look at him through my drunk idlebrain and nod thoughtfully. He is looking yummy.
“I wasn’t aware I was biting my lip.” I murmur softly.
“What was that about?” Pansy demands, her hands on her hips. She was definitely watching and she knows what I look like when I’m angry. I decide honesty is the policy. She’s looking more intractable than ever.
Dear Mr Malfoy,
While I’m in the shower, the potion works fully and I start to remember everything properly. I didn’t think I had any more tears but I’m crying again now. What am i going to do? Draco won't even talk to me. He hates me, and he’s having my baby. A fucking baby. I’m just standing under the water crying when I hear a knock at the door.
“We had a date.” Draco said timidly and looked embarrassed.
“Oh you mean Hermione. That’s fine because she’s pregnant and she will know not to tell anyone right?”
“I know they are Harry. You’re the best.” He says imitating my words to him this morning. I laugh wetly and turn to hug him. Then I pick Leo up and hug him too. We get up and I don’t feel like letting Leo go yet so I keep hold of him for now, which doesn’t seem to surprise Draco.
15.15    The Submissive shall serve the Dominant in any way the Dominant sees fit and shall endeavour to please the Dominant at all times to the best of his ability.
“I had a cup of tea instead. It was fine. I don’t really know why he asked me.”
“I sent Weasley out to get you another pair and some other things. They are in that bag on the chair.”
She sniffs then and carries on. “But I walk into your new home and I see light and the future. I see children laughing and parents loving. I see family and friends celebrating life.” She chuckles and sobs at the same time. “That’s what a home should be, Harry. Not this prison. Besides, it’s not like you have to sell the place. It will still be yours but just empty of people. The ghosts have taken this place now.” She’s quiet then and I think she may have left so I get up to go after her.
“Well you look very smart if i do say so. Now are you sure you’ve tried everything on this hair of yours?” She tried stroking it down once again as if it was going to work the fifth time. I just laughed and pulled away to look at the clock. It was nearly 5 and he would be here soon.
“Nice to finally meet you Mr and Mrs potter. I’m Draco.” I look at him but he’s looking at the grave in all seriousness. “It was very unfortunate that your grandson was born on the same day you died but things happen for a reason I guess. Would you like to meet him? His name is Leo James Potter, and you’d be the first to meet him.” Draco says and gets Leo out his wrap. He passes him to me and places a thick blanket next to the flowers. I lay Leo down on it and he opens his eyes wide.
“Go away!” I go to slam the door in his face but he stops it with his foot.
Holy fuck!
“Hermione, is this the bag you asked the twat to pack.” I say coming back down the stairs.
“I'll be right back with it babe.” I interrupt.
His long fingers reach around to gently stroke my cock, slowly circling the sensitive head. His breath is soft against my face as he slowly nips me along my jaw.
“Don’t believe a word Pansy says.”
Impatient
“I don’t think it will ever be time for that professor.” She does a little chuckle with me.
“You have no idea. I can't leave Severus for long.” I glance up at Severus and hold my fingers up indicating five minutes. He nods, giving me an okay sign, and I follow Pansy into the corridor through the side door. Harry is talking to McGonagall and two other professors. He looks up when he sees me.
She gets in the taxi and waves goodbye. we sit back down and watch the sun set.
“Don’t call me that! And don’t come in here and pretend everything is fine! Because it's not okay?!” He says glaring at me.
I blanch. Wait what? I hadn’t factored this in as a response. I just shrug because I don’t really know.
“Right we better get in there and say hi”
“Mostly, yes.”
I finally get up the courage to move away and head back downstairs. I promised Teddy I’d come round today. I apparate instead of using the floo because I’m running low on powder and need to save it in case of emergencies. When i get to the front door I’m about to knock when it’s opened by Lottie and then all I see is a flash of bright blue and then I’m tackled.
“How are you andromeda?” I turn to her and ask.
“You….now.” I cry.
“Have you met someone?”
“This is the only sort of relationship I’m interested in.”
If you recall, I was going through this list when I was distracted and bedded by a passing control freak.
“Yes I know, but it’s got Malfoy blood.” She holds a box out to Draco and he unwraps it. I look at him but he just shrugs to say he doesn’t know either. Then he opens it and smiles at his mother.
“Long enough.” He smirked at me and went through the door. Great, I rolled my eyes at him even though he couldn’t see me. I hope he felt that eye roll.
Harry is punctual, of course, and is waiting for me outside The Hog Head when I finish. He doesn’t have his broom with him but then again he had said we weren’t going via brooms. I did have my broom shrunk on my backpack just in case. He smiles at me warmly.
“Oh, isn’t it obvious, Pansy?!” I whirl around to face her.
Mr. DRACO LUCIUS MALFOY of flat 7, green street, London, UK. (“The Submissive”)
“Luna, do you mind coming to grimmauld with me?” I ask her nicely. She jumps up with wide eyes.
“Will I get a wand like you guys?”
“Babe it's okay. Neville wasn’t bothered about the way you look, so you shouldn’t have been either.” I hold his hand and kiss it gently.
I start getting nervous again and my hands get clammy. This isn’t my kind of thing and I hate one-to-one interviews. I much prefer my own company, reading a classic British novel, curled up in a chair. I would much prefer to be doing that right now than being sat her twitching nervously and getting sweaty hands.
*Where RU Dray*
“Well, apart from the NDA, a contract saying what we will and won’t do. I need to know your limits, and you need to know mine. This is consensual, Draco.”
Harry Potter
“What are you two whispering about?” Pansy interjects.
I wake up from the best sleep I’ve had in awhile, part of the reason why is because Draco has been right next to me all night. I haven’t opened my eyes yet but I can feel his warmth against my side and I can hear his shallow but steady breathing and I can smell the ridiculously expensive shampoo he uses.
“You gotta stop calling it that.” I say but love it really.
“Mrs Potter?” he asks.
“We should be in London in less than an hour…. if I floor it.”
My heart leaps and desire pools in my crotch.
I am comfortable and warm and it is quiet. I squint my eyes open….oww. That hurts. The quick glance I had told me I’m not in my room. I don’t know where I am. I peek my eyes open again, with my arm over my face, and see that I’m in a hotel suite. Holy shit. Last night comes back to me and the last thing I remember is Potter. Fuck….am I in Harry Potter’s hotel suite?
your new laptop (on loan)
“I felt the baby moving a few weeks ago.” He whispers and Teddy sucks in a breath and puts both his hands on Draco’s belly.
“So, did you catch the quidditch game, dad?” Theo’s clearly keen to move the conversation on.
“Open it then!” Pansy says excitedly as she heads into the kitchen to grab our celebration champagne.
“Why?” He turns and gazes at me while putting the tea bags away. I blush.
Andrew hesitates, gaping at him. He looks lost. Potter turns his head to look at her and lifts his eyebrow. He blushes at this. Thank Merlin, it’s not just me.
“You. Are. Mine. Cum for me, baby.” he growls.
It’s hard to be around him at the moment. It's hard to be around anyone. Everyone is moving on and rebuilding, but I can’t. So many good people died in that stupid war and it’s not fair that I got to live.
“Oh….my mother never floo’d. Is my father okay?”
I groan.
15.16    The Submissive shall take all measures necessary to maintain his good health and shall request or seek medical attention whenever it is needed, keeping the Dominant informed at all times of any health issues that may arise.
“Yeah I do, I’m on leave at the minute. But I don’t think I’m going back. It’s a lot of stress for Draco as well as me. So from now until you graduate, teaching you is my job.”
“What are your plans after Hogwarts?”
Me and Nia start sorting the bigger things and the food. Then George and Angelina and baby Fred arrive to set up the fireworks.
We say our goodbyes and head back through the floo. And as expected Draco rushes to the bathroom. I head to the bathroom and stand in the doorway and cross my arms.
“Why?”
“He will be fine alone, he seems to only terrorise you when you're around.”
“Just wanted to say I’m going to work and good luck!” She smiles widely and I thank her. She leaves and I look at Draco. He’s been having contractions every 20 to 30 minutes. He looks tired already.
“Would your friends say you’re easy to get to know?” I regret it instantly.
Anyway back to cleaning. I’m gonna start with the kitchen, I think. The dishes need doing and the oven needs cleaning. I should probably clean the cupboards out as well seens I’ve not been eating here. Oh and the floor will need a good clean. I go into the kitchen and start the hot water tap to clean the dishes. I’m doing this by hand otherwise it will be done too quickly and anyway it kind of relaxes me doing it by hand, too much magic puts me on edge and I only really use magic at work.
“Leo.” I repeat, to which he rolls his eyes.
“I knew it!” He slammed his book shut and then did the weirdest thing, he started laughing. “I knew she didn’t just know. And I knew it had to be you.” He laughed again and I joined in this time.
“Ahh that’s why you came round, for a distraction.”she chuckles. I raise my hands and shrug my shoulders as if to say I didn’t know what else to do. Just then Teddy comes running round the corner with a coat and wellies on.
Molly has invited us over for tea again tonight and  we gladly accepted. Cooking is just not on our list of things to do right now. And Ron will be there, so we will try and get Ron and Hermione only at some point and tell him.
“Why can’t I touch you?”
Me and Draco make our way to the sitting room and make ourselves comfortable. Then Teddy walks in pulling a tired looking Andy. She’s probably sad because it’s so close to Teddy’s birthday and she’s remembering Tonks.
“But if he’s still in bed, then he must be ill. He’s never in bed at this time. Harry never sleeps in.”
“Yeah that sounds great! I’ve read all the books Hermione gave me on herbology, I think I’m really going to enjoy it.” She says excitedly.
“I will see you in a bit. Don’t be long or I'll come looking for you myself.”
I know he comes to visit every Halloween but he can’t today unfortunately. You see, his fiancé Draco is giving birth to their son, your grandson. So I decided to come for him this year. I’m sure he’ll be along soon, just wait for him.
I frown. Damn it. I don't even know that I’m doing it.
“Oh dear, I do hope he’s okay Harry.” She looks worried now and I curse myself for telling her about the mediwitch.
I am still panting, trying to slow my breathing, my thumping heart, and my thoughts are in riotous disarray. Wow…...that was astounding. I open my eyes, and he has his forehead pressed against mine, his eyes closed, his breathing ragged. Harry’s eyes flicker open and gaze down at me, dark but soft. He is still inside of me. Leaning down, he gently presses a kiss against my forehead then slowly pulls out of me.
“No.” He sighs but takes a step back.
“My father works in the ministry, as sort of a lawyer, and my mother works in St Mungos. They live in Godric's Hollow.”
“I’ve had enough.”
“Thank you healer Bell.” Draco says and turns to leave.
I’ve worked at the pub in Hogsmeade for 4 years. It’s helping me save for a flat when I move to London with Pansy. I like it there and I get to know a lot of different people.
A frown flits across his face.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Pansy.” He is equally formal with her.
It was dark up here so I cast a lumos and the balcony lit up. I must have made a noise because Draco shouted up.
Harry narrows his eyes.
We get on our brooms and do a few laps while shouting to each other.
“But my daddy isn’t here anymore, so who tells you about your mummy and daddy now?” He looks concerned at that so I pick him up and sit down on the rocking chair with him on my knee. Andy must have slipped out at some point. I think for a moment before answering.
“Where are you going?” I ask her and go after her with the bag.
I know I’m meant to say yes, but I don't trust him. Before I can answer, however, he’s on his feet and holding his hand out to me. I place my hand in his, and I can feel my cock responding to his dark, hungry gaze.
“Of course she can go to her godfathers.” She says with a smile and looks at Draco.
My lips quirk up in a quick, sly smile as I sit and slide into the booth - well, at least he’s asking me.
“Ow shit Hermione!”
“Hi.”
I put the banner down and go in search of the giggling. I follow the sound to the back garden and I take a quiet second to watch. Draco is holding Leo’s hands while he attempts to walk. And every time he falls on his bum, Draco lifts him up to the sky and shouts ‘whoshhh’. It makes Leo giggle every time.
may 23 08:20
“Hey everyone! Ron? Where’s Hermione?” I ask while checking the bar but can only see Seamus. Seamus and Dean were always together lately and me and Draco had our suspicions that they were hooking up secretly. Bout time anyway.
“Yeah, they really needed him apparently.” She says and carries on fluffing up pillows on the window seat. While I am trying to build a cabinet. Hermione scrunches up her face then and holds her stomach. She told me she’s been having false contractions all morning and they will go away soon. She told me they were called Braxton hicks contractions and she had them a few days ago too.
“Mr Potter, this way, sir.”
I take a long sip of wine. I have to keep my wits about me, so I don't chug the whole glass like I want to.
“Draco, do you smoke?”
“Bye Teddy, I’ll come around real soon okay? Bye aunt andromeda.” We all shout bye and I pull Draco through the floo to grimmauld place.
“I’ll get you to work by nine tomorrow.”
I nod. It tastes all the more divine because it’s been in
I go over to Draco just as Fred runs off to chase Hermione's otter.
For the next half an hour he points things out to me and I stare, mesmerised as the views. I hold him tight and feel free. Then he points to a bright light in the distance.
Moving down, I push him into my mouth. He groans again. I can do this. I can fuck him with my mouth. I twirl my tongue around the tip again, and he flexes and raises his hips. His eyes are open now, blistering with heat. His teeth are clenched as he flexes again, pushing his cock further into my mouth. I’m supporting myself on his thighs and I can feel his legs tense beneath my hands. He reaches up and grabs my bun and starts to really move.
“Okay let's go then. Hold on tight to my hand.” I hold my hand out for him and he runs up and grabs it.
“Penny for your thoughts?” Potter says, startling me. He’s hovering our things in the air between us.
I lie panting and spent on the bed, eyes closed as he slowly pulls out of me. He rises immediately and dresses after casting a scourgify on us both. When he’s finally clothed, he climbs back on the bed and gently undoes my bindings and pulls my t-shirt off. I flex my fingers and rub my wrists, smiling at the woven pattern imprinted on my wrists from the tie. He pulls the duvet and quilt over me. I stare up at him completely dazed, and he smirks down at me.
“How did I get so lucky with you?” I ask him and then look at his belly again and kiss it right on the tiny bump. I place my head on his stomach and just stay there for a second. Draco finally relaxes and places his hands in my hair.
“That it has Narcissa, we will see you Saturday.”
*RU OK Dray*
There is a knock at our door then and I get up to answer it. Standing in the doorway looking smug as ever is Blaise Zabini. He looks pleased with himself and holds up a bottle of firewhiskey.
“Why? Bored already?” I hear the sarcasm in his voice. He seems his age right now, in the sky on his motorbike. It makes me smile.
Dear Lily and James Potter
“Oh you mean the old apple orchard? I heard that was up for sale but I didn’t know anyone brave enough to buy it.”
“The Pinot Grigio here is a decent wine. It will go well with the meal, whatever we get.” he says patiently.
“Yes please!” He giggles and carries on playing with his bubble horses. I'll let him have a bit more fun before it comes down to washing his hair.
“Yes.” I breathe. He does it once more, and still again.
“No.”
This is another past chapter.
“No but you are.” He scratches my head in mockery and I pull away from him.
“Yes, he’s staying for dinner. Would you like to stay?”
“Harry? Please tell me what’s wrong, is it Draco?” She asks quietly and I sob a bit louder at the use of his name out loud. She rubs my back soothingly and shushs me.
“You wanna go out with me, AGAIN?”
“What?”
I bite my lip and his expression changes instantly. He looks sternly at me. I reach across and pick up my first-ever oyster. Okay…..here goes nothing. I squirt some lemon juice on it and tip it up. It slips down my throat, all sea water, salt, the sharp tang of citrus, and fleshiness…...ooh. I lick my lips, and he’s watching me intently, his eyes hooded.
“You can sit down, you know.” I told him, coming back into the room.
“Good, things are really good. How are you lot?” I ask her.
My mind drifts back to the afternoon. Given what I understand of his preferences, I think he’s been easy on me.
“Well everyone looks good and healthy. I’ll come again next week, but if you have any problems at all then please call me.” I hug her goodbye.
“Because they know me well.” He gives a wry smile.
“Was he gentle?”
“Please.” I beg, and he finally takes pity on me.
“It’s okay Dray. I’m really sorry for what I said and I want to be there for you and support you through this.” I sob back.
“Okay, stay with her Harry. Tell her I love her and I hope it all goes well. Love you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah same. I guess Teddy’s braver than both of us….maybe he will end up in Gryffindor.” I think about it but stick with my guess. After everything that kid said to me, how can he not be a Hufflepuff. I wonder what ours will turn out to be.
“I’m pregnant! We’re having a baby!”
May 23 17:50
“Hermione… I don’t know what to say.” I kiss her forehead and then the baby’s head.
“You okay babe?”
Me? Mysterious?
“No. It doesn't do it for me at all.”
How can she tell? She’s bluffing, and I can’t talk about this. I’ve signed a fucking agreement.
He narrows his eyes, and then seems to remember himself. Releasing my hand, he takes my elbow and leads me out of the room.
“Mum we’ve discussed this. The baby is going to be a Potter.”
“That explains a great deal.” His lip goes up at the side.
“Ethan, Mum and Dad wanted a word.” Pansy drags Ethan away.
“You like competition?” He asks, I blush.
“Who does, Dray? That broom needs vanishing. That’s old news. Why are you being so coy? Give it up, babes.”
The following day Hermione shows up at exactly 2 o clock, she is always very punctual. Ron is with her and he’s carrying a pet carrier in his right and a bag in his left and with a cat litter tray tucked under his left arm. I can tell as soon as crookshanks knows where he is because he starts jumping around in his carrier. Hermione shushes him and comes over to me with some paper in her hands.
Hope you like it.
“I don’t want to exercise four times a week.”
“I’m going to have a feel inside okay?” She asks and Draco nods and squeezes my hand slightly when Katie starts. He makes a face of discomfort and then it’s done. “Well you are about 9 cm dilated, but the baby isn’t down far enough yet. I think we have another few hours yet. Do you wanna try walking around? It may get the baby down where he’s supposed to be.” Draco sighs at the time he has left and then nods. I help him get up and he holds on to me while we walk around the room.
“No thank you. I think I should go.” I stare down at my hands.
“Draco! For fucks sake! How many times do I have to tell you? You are a total catch and any guy will be lucky to have you.” She’s going to start ranting now.
“You alright mate?” Ron says next to me and gives me a jab with his elbow. I didn’t even see him sit there but I’m glad he did.
The blonde guy at the desk gets up suddenly and approaches. He was on the phone when I arrived and so he looked me up and down and asks, “Mr Malfoy?”.
“I have rules, and I want you to comply with them. They are for your benefit and for my pleasure. If you follow these rules to my satisfaction, I shall reward you. If you don’t, I shall punish you, and you will learn.” He whispers and I glance at the canes as he says this.
It wasn’t a big place and there were only a couple of people in here but it had a nice atmosphere. We head over to the counter where a lovely looking young black waitress stands. She has a brown Afro with blond tips and she is wearing an apron that says her name, Nia. She looks up as we approach and gives us a huge smile.
Carrying on. Hope everyone’s doing okay. Enjoy. X
“I’ve got nothing to compare it to, do I?” I shrug apologetically.
“Ermm…...yes. I have my jacket with everything in. Harry please, I need to tell Pansy. She will worry.” I tell him still very drunk.
“Yeah that’s right, leave your ex-girlfriend with your pregnant boyfriend-sorry fiancé. Good idea Harry.” I know she’s only joking and her and Draco get along well.
Oh shit. I flush. “Ermm….no.”
“Serves you right for turning you back in lesson. Always be prepared Miss Thompson.”
“I thought you were going back to work?” I ask him, but he smiles at me and ignores the question.
“Well like my father said, I had enough food and water for a few weeks. It just kept appearing when I was low. Then one day it was just gone. I walked for a bit, in search of any fruit trees or vegetables. Then I saw a sign for town and followed it. I went past the bakers and saw all these fresh loafs. My mouth was watering but I didn’t have money so I carried on. Next thing I know, there is a warm loaf of bread in my hand. It must have been my magic so I quickly put it in my bag. I know it was stealing but I didn’t mean to and I was young and alone and hungry. Every time I went past somewhere with something I needed inside, they would just appear in my hand or bag. Then when I turned 16, I took my passport and got a job at ‘whipped’. I’ve been there 2 years now.”
“Did you volunteer to do this interview?” He asks, his voice deadly quiet.
“I think I know where she is Ted.” I tell him and lead him to the dining room. He opens the door and suddenly these mini fireworks go off and everyone inside yells ‘surprise!’.
“And you are….” He says in a warm but possibly slightly amused voice. His expression stays impassive and so it’s hard to tell. He looks mainly polite and mildly interested.
“I’m not incapable of getting off the floor you know!”
“You are so...domineering.” I chuckle some more.
“Wingardium Leviosa!” She says perfectly while pointing my spare wand at a leaf. The leaf floats up softly just like the feathers in my first year.
We land at the top of the stairs but not the one leading to the front door, so we must be on the second or higher floor. He leads us to a door at the end of the corridor and produces a key from his pocket. He waves his hand infront of the door and I feel a wave of magic unlocking. Then he uses the key. He takes a deep breath and looks at me.
She’s talking to her parents, who are delighted as ever and greet me warmly. We exchange brief pleasantries, mostly their up and coming holiday to Barbados and about our move.
“I didn’t take anything! I swear Harry! I didn’t do anything!” He’s starting to cry again now but I’m still in shock and don’t know what to say. “Please Ha-Harry. Say something.” He hiccups while crying.
“Adoption or surrogacy?” She asks and I panic at the question. Then I just blurt out surrogacy.
May 24 18:55
“Since I was six.”
Following my more thorough examination of your issues, may I bring to your attention the definition of submissive.
“But whyyy?? I’m having fun, and it's my birthday so I should decide how I spend it.” He says to us. “Pleasseeee.”
“No harry! It’s not you. I told you it’s nothing okay? So just leave it.” He pushes me aside and walks out. From the creaking of the floorboards I can hear, he has walked out the house. I want to follow him but I don’t know if i should. What if he wants to break up? It's all my fault, I pushed and pushed for this and now it's all crumbling. I didn’t even ask him before I made a life decision for us. It's my fault. I made him panic and pushed him and it's all my fault. It’s all my fault. It’s all my fault. It’s all my fault...
“Harry I’m so sorry.” Luna says to me then. I’ve never been angry at Luna before but this is to far.
No activity that involves the use of the unforgivable curses.
“So, is everything okay?” She asked, she has started sweating a little now.
Shit…. I have to deal with Pansy’s persistence and tenacity, and I’m in possession of a signed legal document saying I can’t talk. It’s not a healthy mix.
“It means ‘our heart’.” He smiles and blushes.
“-don’t know how much longer he can go on like this.” Ron whispers.
“Draco’s pregnant?” She says then. Fuck! Oh merlin! Draco is going to kill me, bring me back to life, and fucking kill me again.
“Er….no. Pans - Miss Parkinson - she compiled the questions.”
“No, Draco.” He’s bemused as he shakes his head.
“Do you mind if I record?” I ask him, remembering that I should have probably already asked.
“Uncle Harry?” He sniffs like he’s been crying. “I’m scared, can I sleep with you?” He often did this at grimmauld but I don’t mind.
“Yes, please.”
No acts involving fire play.
By the time we are by the front doors, he still has my hand. He turns to me.
“I’m good actually, thanks for asking. Nah she’s a ravenclaw.” He throws a pillow at her and she laughs harder.
‘Merlin, how did this happen? Why always me?’ I say quietly to the empty corridor.
“Well you didn’t say anything … so..” I say quietly, looking down at my hands.
“We saw your broom in the barn.” I tell her.
“Yes please dear, milk no sugar.” Andy says and sits on the chair.
“Oh dear, Draco, you moved. What am I going to do to you?”
to consider for our meeting;
“We’ll see you soon.” I blow kisses and we Apparate to the burrow.
“Hey.” I get one shoe off and look over my shoulder at him. “What was that all about back there?”
“I’ve given you a great deal to think about, haven't I?”
“It was good sex, not dreadful at all.”
Draco looks at her, then at me and finally lifts his jumper up. And there is it, a very noticeable little bump. “Wow.” Is all Nia can say and then Draco covers back up and walks off.
Your issues
“Yeah, I need a drink. Have we brought any peanut butter with us babe?” Draco asks and head over to our bag of supplies. I frown at him then.
10    The Dominant and Submissive enter into this contract on the commencement date fully aware of its nature and undertake to abide by its conditions without exception.
“Well we don’t know if it’s a boy or girl yet, so it's little cherry for now.” He says stubbornly
“Mr malfoy?” Draco stands up then. “If you’d like to follow me, healer Bell is ready to see you.” They both start walking away and I just sit there. Draco hasn’t asked me to come with him and I haven’t asked to be in there today, so I should just wait here.
With that decided we head back downstairs to collect the cleaning things to start on Nia’s room. Draco still can’t use a lot of magic so he’s still on cleaning duty while I sort the holes in the walls and missing floors.
“Well you were close with all the constellation names Ginny, but you were going to deep in. His name is Leo James Potter.” There are laughs and then awwws from everyone.
“Oh so you don’t think any less of my family then?” I say sarcastically.
“Why?” Teddy asks, in the way all children ask questions that are awkward to answer.
May 23 20:33
“Eventually yes, but while you're learning you can use my spare.” I tell her.
Fuck!
“Thanks Hermione. Yeah okay, i think i just need some sleep, it's been a long day.” I get up and give my friend a hug.
We walked to the big barn doors and opened them rather easily. It did just look like an old dusty barn inside. There was a rusted tractor to one side and some stalls to keep livestock one the other side.
“And the photographer?” He snaps at me.
“Thanks.” I say and am unable to hide the sarcasm in that one word. “Goodbye Mr Potter.” With that I turn around and without giving him a second glance, I walk through the doors and disappear from view.
“No thank you.” I shake my head and he lets go and I head for the table in the corner.
“Yes great.” I say at the same time Draco says, “it was lovely.”
They go off and presumably tell everyone because by the time we get to the present opening, nearly everyone has congratulated us and looked at the ring.
Harry Potter
“Yes.” I whisper after clearing my throat. “And I find you intimidating.” I look down again and blush.
“I’m working today and then tomorrow me and Pans are packing for our move to London. The rest of the week I’m working.” I tell him.
“Hello!  Yep. Where is uncle Draco? Has he had cherry yet?” He says instead of chéri which he has obviously forgotten how to say.
It is just before eight when the Audi turns into the little village. Why Harry insists on driving everywhere, is beyond me. The floo is much quicker, and apparating is even better. We go past a few little cottages and then Harry turns to me.
“I have one last present for everyone, but daddy has to open it.” He smirks at me and hands me an envelope.
“Keep still.” he warns, his breath warm against my skin. Reaching my navel, he dips his tongue inside, and then gently grazes my belly with his teeth, carefully avoiding my cock. My body bows off the bed.
“I can do it.” Draco says in a small voice and takes Fred by the hand. He goes with him and they go and sit next to the flowers by the oak tree on the right.
Mr Potter, stop emailing me, and I can start my assignment.
“Hellos sirs. Mistress Tonks is with Mrs Malfoy and master Edward in the sitting room. Come, come.” She shows us through with a wave. I leave the pram at the front door and carry Leo through.
“What? It’s catchy.” He says to me. “chéri is perfect Teddy, thank you. Do you wanna know a secret?” He whispers to him, to which Teddy jumps down from me and holds Draco’s hand.
“Sorry Harry. He wanted to come with you. Is it okay?” Andy says hesitantly. “I know you have your hand full with the new baby but-“ I hold my hand up stopping her.
“Yeah! We even got to hear little chéri heartbeat, wanna hear?” Before she could answer, Draco had gotten the dragon teddy out and pressed it’s belly. And there it was again, our baby’s heartbeat.
Ron comes through the door with some shopping and Nia follows.
“Good boy.” He says, and I nearly scoff at him. I’m not a child! “I’ll take you back once you have dried your hair. Can’t have you getting ill.” I get up and head to the bedroom, rolling my eyes so that he can't see. Suddenly a thought stops me.
“No thank you aunt andromeda, my stomach is still feeling a bit dodgy.” He says making an excuse. We will be able to tell everyone in about 3 weeks, so it will be okay then and we won't have to make excuses.
There’s an obscenely rich and powerful guy I’ve met and he wants some kind of strange kinky sexual relationship, in which I don't get a say in things. Ha, she’d probably keel over there and then.
“He’s twenty seven. I really am sorry, Dray. I should have briefed you, but I was panicking so much thinking I wouldn’t get anyone to do this interview for me, I forgot.”
The Submissive will ensure he achieves a minimum of seven hours’ sleep a night when he is not with the Dominant.
“Draco dear, I’m the one that should be apologising. It’s good to see you putting on weight and I shouldn’t have made a joke.” She says back to him sincerely.
“Because you’ve given me so much to consider….and I need some distance.”
He lies down on the bed and I come to stand next to him. He grabs my hand and is nearly crushing it.
Harry Potter
“Uncle Harry! Draco! I’m so glad you're here. Grandma’s been sad today. You can cheer her up though.” We look at each other with sad eyes.
“Nice car.” I murmur dryly.
He stops.
The next day I wake up at 12. The party is at 4 so I have plenty of time to get ready. I have a banging headache and go get some sobering potion. I take it and then jump straight in the shower.
“But there is just something about you and I am finding it more and more difficult to stay away. I think you may have already figured that out though.”
“I thought you might.” He says before I can start asking them. Is he laughing at me? I blush once more at the realization, and sit up and square my shoulders in an attempt to look taller and more intimidating. I press start on the recorder, trying to ignore him, and ray my best to look professional.
“Goodbye Mr Potter sir.” I apparate out straight away and back to grimmauld.
“Definitely! I’m boiling.” I help him and we go down to the shore. Rons down here with Teddy building sandcastles.
“Your indecent proposal…..yes, I am. I have issues though.”
“Harry, her name is Pansy.” Theo grumbles.
“Okay. I’m tired Harry.” Whether he’s saying he is physically tired or emotionally tired I don’t know.
“To the end of exams, our new life in London, and excellent results.” We clink glasses and drink.
“Why were you in his bed?” Ron said which I ignored and spoke up.
“Looks good.” Draco says next to me. I turn around to see how far he’s gotten and I’m pleasantly surprised. The room looks totally clean and he’s started painting already.
“Harry are you okay? Are you crying?” Hermione asks from behind the door. I wipe my face and answer her.
THE END.
“No, Draco, I’m not gay…. More like bisexual.” He smirks and I blush again. I can’t believe I just said that out loud!
I’m not that hungry anymore and just want to know what he meant by that. I bit my lip and can feel him staring at me. I squirm under his fierce eyes.
“I wish they were here to see this though, all of them.”  I look to Ron and remember Fred and then to Hermione and remember Remus and Tonks. I remember Dumbledore and Snape, Cedric and Sirius, Hedwig and Dobby, Ted Tonks and Alastor Moody, Lavender and Colin, and the rest of the fallen, and especially mum and Dad.
“Would you like me to come again tomorrow?” I ask him.
“Blaise just got out of line, he was really drunk.” I shrug like this is a regular occurrence, which it isn't. Quite frankly, I remember being kind of scared.
“Thank you guys.” She smiles.
“Ermm...excuse me a moment, Mr Potter.” Potter frowns at me and follows me with his eyes as I turn and head to Greg.
“In a pub.”
“Did I throw up again?” I say quietly, emphasis on the did.
“In very simple terms, I want you to want to please me.” He says softly, his voice hypnotic.
May 26 19:23
He leaves the room, presumably to go to the kitchen. I feel too out of place in this big room by myself and so I follow after him. I lose him for a second but then here glasses clink and follow the noise down some steps and into a large kitchen. This doesn’t look as modern but more like it’s had a splash of paint and been kept clean. It’s nice and very homely. Harry is opening a bottle of wine when he sees me. He has removed his jacket.
Harry turned around to see the blue haired apprentice, Teddy, from the night before.
"If that's true, then what's happening to Harry?" Ron asks. "He's not aging every time he comes back, is he?" He turns to Harry, looking concerned. "Are you?"
Harry’s jaw drops and he looks around himself again, focusing on what he can see through the windows. “Paris? I’ve never been to Paris before.”
friends. I've been trying to find, er, mentions of you in my textbooks, sir," he tells Flamel. "What year is it?" He's hoping that a year and a place will be enough to point Hermione in the right direction.
, Harry tells his body, but his skin hasn't started feeling tight-loose by the time the wand rounds the corner, Professor Snape attached to it.
Harry pushed his glasses up his nose, squinting around the room. “The pans got mad? Does the silverware get angry when it’s not polished properly? I bet the hearth is angry at how dirty it’s gotten. Wizard Malfoy should really hire a cleaner.”
else?"
"I…" He screws his eyes shut to avoid looking at his seemingly normal hands which feel anything but. Maybe if he just sits still and focuses on his breathing, the feeling will pass. He thinks his friends are saying something else but all he can hear is a rushing, staticky sound in his ears.
Harry can only nod.
"Why is it so bad?" Harry demands. "What is wrong with talking to snakes? Listen, if I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin-"
"Nice! Nice!? You would think so. You did it on purpose."
“I won’t,” Harry promises sadly. Draco can’t tell if it’s a lie or not. “I’m sorry, Draco.”
“Que puis-je faire pour vous, mon enfant*?” the older man says.
"No!" Draco combed frantic fingers through his hair, twirling it up into a bun and then letting it fall, over and over. "Do you remember when he first arrived, not that long ago, and he implied that I had stolen Teddy? He's all but said he used to be an apprentice as well, and just imagine for a second you're used to being old, you repeat to yourself that you're safe because you're old, no longer an apprentice. Now you wake up, young again, in the arms of the man you were afraid would capture you all along. I
, not the chimney or the hearth stones or the grate. He ignored the kid openly laughing at him, and hobbled over to sit back down in the chair. Up close he could see a face in the flames, red eyes and blue-white grin. “You knew I was under a mmm- what happened to me. Last night. You said.”
“Of course,” Draco continues, looking down at his school list, “I already have a cauldron, but I suppose I’ll be needing a new one, along with the rest of these. It won’t do to have hand-me-downs like the
Everything is silent for a moment, before the voice whispers, "Lumos," and the unknown man begins to walk, an odd cadence that suggests he might be injured.
“Breakfast?” Teddy said from the other side of the room.
So Harry listens in horror as Tom explains how
"He's taking a nap."
“Oh,” the man says, and stops, running a hand nervously through his messy black hair. “This must be the first time,” he mutters to himself. Draco takes the opportunity to memorize his face and any other defining features, in case he needs to describe him to the Aurors later. His hair is long, longer than Draco’s at any rate, and some pieces stand up like he’s just been out in a wind storm. He wears round, wire-rimmed glasses and his eyes are extra green, just like Harry’s. He's not wearing robes, and his trousers are rough looking and blue. He's wearing house slippers and something that could be a pajama top. It should be very distinctive if the Aurors need to catch him later. Draco feels he could describe him perfectly because-
“Are you Wizard Malfoy?” Harry asked. The man didn’t answer, even as he moved toward Harry, flicking a hand toward him which pushed him and his chair away from the hearth. “Hey!” he wheezed, hands clutched on the arms of the chair as his heart thumped erratically.
“I forbid you from talking about this to anyone else, including Mother and Father,” Draco orders Dobby in his most Father-like voice as soon as Harry pops into his bedroom.
"I could…"
"Oh but it's changing now..."
"Um, about three weeks?"
“Oh bring him in,” the voice said. “Draco should be back by tomorrow morning.”
“I have to go to the library.”
travel?"
There's still time for him to make it back to Herbology before class is over, but Harry feels incredibly drained, and heads back to his dorm instead, still under the invisibility cloak.
Once he stops panicking, Harry realizes that Professor Dumbledore is not participating in these spells. He's watching Harry curiously.
“What? Come on Tom,” he says, abandoning his attempt at lifting Ginny on his own and stepping towards the taller boy urgently. “I might need it, we’ve got to get out of here!”
“We just need to figure out what about that configuration allowed you to travel with your clothes. Oh, and maybe compare the two. Something about circles...oh, I wish there were more books about this subject. Maybe because you’re in a time...loop? Okay.” She moves on to the second outfit, eyeing it critically. “You really need to get clothes that fit, Harry. These jeans look like they could fit two of you.”
Hermione makes a disgusted face at Ron’s lack of manners and Harry grins at both of them. He’s so lucky to have them as friends.
"No, not so helpful, that," Harry says. "I'll tell you about it later. We had loads of help from you, actually. Couldn't have done it without you."
“Dobby?” Harry asks, his eyes wide like Greg’s get when he sees chocolate cake at tea. They’re very green.
"Aha!!" Pansy wolf whistled through the open window. He raised a hand for an air-high five with Pansy. "Now you can finally stop sneaking around! We all
Draco stared at Harry, dumbfounded, then cleared his throat. “We’ll discuss it over dinner.”
“Pans got mad when we- well, just me- when I sometimes let the potions boil over.”
Harry frowned. "You're right. He talked to me over tea until I fell asleep, and when I woke up I was in his bed and he was gone. And he was upset earlier, over nothing. Unless someone said something to him?" He stood up, all righteous indignation, and Pansy had to calm him down.
in trouble. Go lay down, I'll be up soon."
"Good. I expect you to take top marks this year. Events have been put into motion regarding the...education of mudbloods at Hogwarts, and that pesky girl will be taken care of along with the rest. You are, of course, unaware of such measures, isn’t that right, Draco?”
"Maybe his broom will go with him," Ron points out, and receives a glare for his trouble.
“Yeah.”
In the seconds before Harry could turn around, damn his old bones, he pictured all of the objects in the room, trying to determine which one had spoken this time. Was the table sentient too? Something in one of those glass bottles? But no, as he turned he saw a new person who had entered the room. The man turned away as Harry met his gaze, but it was enough to see that he was beautiful. His pale eyes were lined with eyeliner as sharp as his richly embroidered suit and as smooth as the rainbow opals in his earrings and necklace. His white-blond hair framed his cheekbones and swished along his pointy jaw as he turned.
Harry’s entire face lights up as he beams at Draco. “Malfoy? I mean, Draco? This is so-” he looks around the room again. “Sorry, I just wanted to make sure, sometimes I travel to the future, and you could have been your own son for all I know.”
“First time I’m seeing it,” the ungrateful fire demon said.
last time the chamber was opened!"
Ron raises his head. “You were saying?”
That wasn't to say he wasn't still distracting. Draco had to put his potion in a stasis one day because he had been too busy watching (and discreetly laughing) as Harry tried desperately to clean the window. The old man had gone out in Diagon with his bucket and rag, and then immediately returned, only to glance at the window again and hobble outside again. He was smart though, and when he came back he turned the dial black-side down and stepped out into the garden in Wiltshire, and then back again to finally find the corresponding outside of the window in Hogsmeade. Draco outright grinned at Harry when he made an exasperated face as he cleaned the window, but made sure to thank him when he returned, for the window and for leveling out the table leg. It was secretly a relief to no longer feel the table jolt every time he cut his ingredients.
Hermione grins in response.
“Now, what did you boys want to talk about?” she asks kindly, pushing the biscuits towards Harry.
“Why don’t we just stay at home.” He says and lifts an eyebrow. “I’ve got to stay in bed until the baby is born and I do not want to be staying in that minging bed at grimmauld.” He crosses his arms. Now I think about it, I think why not. I shrug and nod.
“This is delicious, incidentally.” He grins at me.
“Do you do this to people or do they do it to you?” I whisper. His mouth quirks up, either amused or relieved. He blinks a couple of times then, considering his answer.
“Draco, you are deliciously sweet. I know.”
“I thought you liked me to clear my plate.”
Of course he did. Is that even legal? Stalker.
Two extra windows and a balcony was added in the end, to make it more light and so she could sit out on the balcony in the summer. The furniture was all arranged nicely so that the bedroom was at one end, with a waist high wall added to give privacy, and the sitting area in the middle with the bathroom through the door at the other end.
“Do you have any interests outside your work?”
“Not at all.” He says, still smiling at Rose.
“I look forward to reading the article, Miss Parkinson.” He smiles and then turns to me. “Will you walk with me, Mr Malfoy?” He asks.
I want to get off this subject and quickly glance at Pansy’s questions.
I stand there, next to the massive table, as he starts pulling things out of the fridge. He takes them over to the surface top and starts to cut up a french baguette.
“You think?” I ask him.
“Draco Malfoy, did you just give me a compliment?”
“Draco please. I was just in shock.” He turns around again and is quietly hissing so nobody can overhear.
He looks up at me with tears running from his eyes and nods his head.
“You aren’t giving anything away, Draco.” He murmurs, exasperated. “Let's go back downstairs where I can concentrate better. It’s very distracting having you in here.” He holds his hand out to me, and now I’m hesitant to take it.
Suddenly the engine starts up and it is really loud. I’m glad for the helmet as it quietens it slightly.
“Can we all say a cheers for Nia - she is finally an honorary witch, having finally passed all her exams.” Everyone claps and cheers and Nia takes a bow. “I believe you have been knighted by the sorting hat?” I ask her, a bit slurry after a few drinks.
He steps through and we head outside.
“If you're going to throw up again, do it here. I've got you.” He has an arm around my shoulders and the other one is moving the hair from my face and stroking me at the same time. I try to push away, because I’m so embarrassed, but he doesn’t budge. And I vomit again….and again. Fuck, this is horrible. I wish it would stop so I can go to sleep. Even when my stomach is empty, I still continue to dry heave. This is appalling and I vow to never drink this much again. Eventually it stops.
When we can see the ducks Teddy runs ahead. He starts feeding them and they follow him around. Me and Draco sit down on the bench and he leans his head on my shoulder.
April 11th.
“Heyyy.” I heard next and look over to Draco. He’s on his side with his head propped in his hand. I chuckle and carry on taking my shoes off.
“Draco, I’ve just sat for two and a half hours listening to all kinds of crap. I would like a drink.”
Harry Potter
“Get into bed.” he says sharply. His voice softens. “I’ll come and lie down with you.” I drop my hand and frown. I don't think I’ve ever touched his torso. He opens a chest of drawers and pulls out a t-shirt and quickly slips it on.
“Fine well, it’s just that you weren’t exactly our first choice to look after him.” I stared at her in disbelief, she was such a snake sometimes but I still loved her.
Harry Potter
He smiles sardonically.
Sev takes my elbow and leads me towards the entrance to the tent.
As we speed along through London, both of us quiet, no doubt inhibited by Weasley’s steady presence in the front. Harry’s mood is almost tangible and seems to shift, the humour dissipating slowly as we head north. He’s brooding, staring out the window, and I know he’s slipping away from me. What is he thinking? I can’t ask him. What can I say in front of Weasley?
I walk quietly towards him, enticed by the sublime, melancholy music. I’m mesmerised, watching his long, skilled fingers as they find and gently press the keys, thinking how the same fingers have expertly handled and caressed my body. I slush and gasp at the memory. He glances up, his unfathomable green eyes bright, his expression unreadable.
I stare at the food overwhelmed by choice and realise I’m actually really hungry. I go for pancakes with lemon juice and a sprinkling of sugar. My favourite.
“Yes well it won't be nice if it gets cold, so eat up.” He says changing the subject but I’m not buying it this time, it was really sweet of him to do this.
I head outside but don’t see anyone, so I go back in and take a wonder through the house. I open the door to the office and stare. Ron and Draco are both in here, laughing and playing chess.
“You should find me intimidating. You’re very honest.” He pauses briefly. “Please don’t look down, I like to see your face.”
“Is Malfoy still here?” I ask her with a frown.
“Pansy, please!” I can’t hide my exasperation.
Good night.
“How’s the article coming along?”
“Come on.” He comes back and takes my hand, pulling me along.
“Yep, this is going to be great fun.”
The next time Leo woke for a bottle, Teddy covered his ears and went back to sleep. But the time after he threw his hand up and sighed. He got out of bed before I could and headed for the door.
“Your aunt and Teddy really want to see you. Are you up for it?” He nods and I guide him back into bed.
I am quaking like a leaf. This is it. Finally, after all this time, I’m going to do it, with none other than Harry Potter. My breath is shallow, and I can't take my eyes off him. He removes his watch and places it on top of a chest of drawers that matched the rest of the room, and removes his jacket placing it on a chair. He is dressed in his white linen shirt and jeans. He is heart-stoppingly beautiful. His black unruly hair is even more of a mess than usual, and his shirt is hanging out - his green eyes bold and dazzling. He steps out of his Converse shoes and reaches down and takes his socks off individually. Harry Potter’s feet….wow…..what is it about naked feet? Turning, he gazes at me, his expression soft.
“Yeah fine, just…. happy.” I tell him while looking at Draco.
“Okay, Draco is going to let you up now but you have to promise not to run.”
“Thank you Harry. It wasn’t planned but I guess that’s just how our life is.” That made me chuckle and agree with her. Ron speaks up then.
“It was quite exquisite, but very sad, such a melancholy melody.”
After a few minutes she looks up.
“Oh, Dray,” she gushes. “He’s just so….everything. And when we….oh….really good.” She can hardly string a sentence together, she’s got it so bad.
The stairs were centered in the middle of the house. So straight across was the first bedroom. It was medium size and had a small en-suite. It was at the back of the house and didn’t need a lot of work done.
This chapter is back in the present. Hope you like it. X
“Pansy, it’s just coffee. Anyway, I won’t be long because in case you forgot, our exams are this week and I need to study.”
Draco takes Teddy in and then moves his hands from his eyes.
“Thank you healer Bell.” Draco says and walks off without a single glance at me.
The beef is delicious and served with roasted sweet potatoes, carrots, parsnips, and green beans. It is even more palatable since Harry managed to retain his good humour for the rest of the meal. I suspect that it’s because I’m eating so heartily. The conversation flows freely among the Potters, warm and caring, gently teasing one another. Over our dessert of lemon syllabub, Luna regales us with her exploits of finding creatures all over France, lapsing into fluent french. We all stare at her, and she stares back puzzled, until Harry tells her in equally fluent French what she’s done, whereupon she bursts into a fit of giggles. She has a very infectious laugh, and soon we’re all in stitches.
An hour later I decide I want to go in the sea.
“We haven’t even discussed it yet sorry. I’m sure you're in the draw though.” I wink at her and she taps the back of my head.  Of course her and Ron are going to be godparents, but I do need to check with Draco.
“Horrid, awful, gruesome.” He declared confidently. But then I saw the smirk just at the side of his mouth and I burst out laughing.
Your new laptop
I decide everyone must be muggle and start to fiddle with the shrunken broom in my pocket as I step into the elevator with a few other people. When I step out of the elevator on the twentieth floor, I am greeted by another desk and another 2 smartly dressed people. Both blonde and both gorgeous. The woman is the one to look at me and smile. She is dressed in black and white and is impeccable. She stands up to greet me. “Mr Malfoy, could you wait here please?” She directs me to one of the leather chairs in the sitting area.
His mouth tightens into that hard line.
“No,” I moan.
“Please, don't stop on my account. It’s very entertaining.” His tone is one of wry amusement.
His lips quirk into a half smile.
“Well, that’s another first.” He eyes me speculatively. “So nothing you want to discuss now? About the contract?”
“Speak for yourself Malfoy.” I shove his shoulder playfully.
He smirks. “Old enough to know better.”
Theo holds forth about his latest building project, a new eco-friendly wizarding community up north. I glance at Pansy, and she’s hanging on every word Theo says, her eyes glowing with lust or love. I haven’t quite worked out which yet. He grins down at her, and it’s as if an unspoken promise passes between them.
“Okay. Thanks Hermione.” She gives me a kiss on the cheek and waves me off through the floo.
“Draco, what is it?”
I’m starving. I head back out to the bedroom. Sleeping beauty is still sleeping, so I leave him and head for the kitchen.
At your hotel at 7:00?
CEO, Potter Enterprises Holding, Inc.
“Good luck, Draco. You seem awfully nervous. Do you want a tonic?”
Just then the floo roared to life and I had to grab crookshanks to stop him racing into it. I was on the floor on my stomach with crookshanks in my hands, which were bloody by now, when I looked up and saw Draco.
“Wednesday.” I whisper.
“Good. Until tomorrow, perhaps.” He turns to leave and then pauses. “Oh and Draco, I’m really glad Miss Parkinson couldn’t do the interview.” He smiles and then heads out, leaving me almost quivering and with a distinct bulge in my pants. I just stood there staring at the door for several minutes before someone shouts over for refills and I shake myself back into work mode.
“Well I was giving birth to your son.” Draco smirks at me but it fades quickly. “I’m sorry love.” He kisses my cheek.
“Draco, should we get some lunch?”
Well, that explains a great deal. And I recall the interview; he really
May 25 23:58
After a few hours we have a break for lunch. We decide to go into town and find a cafe. After about 10 minutes wandering around we come across one. It's cream and mint coloured with big windows and little metals tables and chairs outside to eat. There are bright flowers all along the windowsills on both sides of the door. The sign has fancy writing which reads whipped. That got a giggle out of Draco and made us go inside.
“I love you to Harry. So much. Don’t ever leave me…” he says slowly, falling asleep.
“I know love. But everything that you have done so far proves that you are a better man than your father. I bet he didn’t get up at 3am with you. Or change the worst smelling nappies. Or even cuddle you just because he couldn’t bare to put you down yet. Well, you have done all that.” He smiles and I kiss him again. “Now, let's go and show our baby off.” I smirk and he chuckles.
“Hi.” I murmur as she drags me into the large hall. It’s all dark wood floors and antique rugs with a sweeping staircase to the second floor.
“Why can't the new girl, what’s her name, sign for it?”
“Draco darling! Harry, how are you both?” Narcissa gets up first and we meet in the middle.
“Really good thanks Ron. How are you two?” I ask him and me and draco sit on the bench next to theirs. It is placed at a right angle so we can all see each other.
“JUST, TEDDY DID SOMETHING THAT HIS MUM USED TO DO AND IT HIT ME HARDER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD.” I tell him because I know I will tell him sooner or later anyway, may as well be sooner.
“Well that didn’t take long.” I say to Ron and we make our way back towards our fiancés’.
“Please,” Harry and I speak in unison.
I turn to Draco and glare at him. He just glares straight back and crosses his arms over his chest.
“Yeah, I think I need to push.” I press it before she even answers but I’m glad she says yes.
I lavishly sign on the dotted line of both copies and hand one back to him. I fold the other up and put it in my backpack. I then take another gulp of wine. I am sounding so much braver than I’m actually feeling.
What kind of life did he have before the Potters got hold of him and rescued him?
After about 5 minutes of staring and silence, Katie speaks up.
“I have varied interests, Mr Malfoy. Very varied.” He clarifies and has a touch of a smile playing on his lips. I heat up at his steady gaze. His eyes seem alight with wicked thoughts and I blush again.
Wow….control freakery gone mad. I blink at him, shocked.
Harry Potter
“Merlin, you are such a disciplinarian.” I hiss and cross my arms over my chest like a teenager being told off by their parents.
“Yep. They are my favourite animal.” He declares proudly.
“He has someone with him.”
I flush and stare down at the table.
“How about we just stay right here for now. I’m comfy.” I yawn.
“Thank you, Mr Potter.” The photographer scurries off. I blink from the flash.
May 23 18:02
“It’s okay, it was only an accident and it's all gone now. Bit of magic and nothing happened. Now what animal would you like this week?” His eyes go wide and he cheers up at this question then thinks about it for a minute before answering.
“Nia, we know you’re a witch.” I say calmly to her.
“Oh, please, don’t let this be about money, Draco. Theo said it’s very unusual for Harry to date anyone.”
“Yes! All. To. My. Self.” With each word he plants a kiss on my face and after he says ‘self’ he licks my face right by my ear.
“Do you wanna see your room Teddy?” I ask him as I’m starting up the stairs.
“So you’re not seeing any of them anymore?”
Until very recently. My brain supplies very unhelpfully. NO! I banish the thought and remember the mortifying interview. Are you gay, Mr Potter? I cringe at the memory and shake my head. I know I’ve dreamt about him since but it’s just my subconscious trying to give me nightmares, surely.
I am totally bewildered. Me, self contained? No way. How did I manage that?
“I’m sorry uncle Harry, sorry uncle Draco, sorry Leo.” He says and sulks at his shoes.
“Do you want to come back with me?” I ask. I don't want him to go. I want to prolong our time together.
Draco Malfoy
“I’m not mad at you.”
“Well nobody ever sees him with a date, so I just thought I’d ask.”
Synonyms: 1. Tractable, compliant, pliant, amenable. 2. Passive, resigned, patient, docile, tame, subdued.
The tears are coming heavy now, I haven’t allowed myself to feel this in a long time. But it’s what I need right now.

“Transcription by Bach, but it;s originally an oboe concerto by Alessandro Marcello.”
“Hi Harry.” They say back and continue whispering together. I go through to the kitchen to find Hermione cooking.
“No, Draco, it doesn’t. First, I don’t make love. I fuck….hard. Second, there’s a lot more paperwork to do. And third, you don’t yet know what you're in for. You could still run for the hills. Come, I want to show you my playroom.”
What would you suggest I put into a search engine?
“Wow Draco I didn’t know you could play piano!” Nia comes rushing in. Draco gets distracted and hits the wrong key and stops playing. I chuckle to myself and open my eyes.
“There’s...” Draco trails off as Harry walks to the speaker and turns it on. Mariah Carey blares out of it, as the singer croons about her love. Draco breaks in an ear-splitting grin and Harry reaches his hand out for Draco, singing into the dripping spoon like it’s a mic.
He looks up at Draco and sighs, “I’m trying. It’s just so boring.” Draco leans over, glancing at the Potions book. There are words spilled across the pages, monotonous and, of course, boring. His shoulders slip down and he waves his wand across the book, and suddenly colors appear on the page.
Potter stares at Draco for a few seconds and then flips open Draco’s old textbook, a little more intrigued than before.
“Merlin..” Draco mutters, and creeps away from the back of library, jutting his thumb at Madam Pince to let her know of the fun acts taking place in her library. The strict librarian gives him a tight smile, and hurries off to kick the couple out of the stacks. Pince still hadn’t forgiven him for, well anything, so if Draco has to resort to snitching to win some favor (and some after-hour library time), he regrets nothing.
The first month back at Hogwarts was the worst. Harry didn’t know his place in the castle: was he the hero that every student in the castle looked up to? Was he supposed to be scary? Was he supposed to corral the children? Prove that Dumbledore was right about him? That he
After that, Harry’s confidence around girls,
“Alright then. The library for potions tutoring. Let’s see how this goes,” Harry mutters to himself, prepared to complain to Ron and Hermione in the next few minutes.
who’s harry potter in this world?
Harry wakes up every morning this way. Every morning since Draco died, he forgets for the first few sleepy seconds before his brain begins to function, reaching for the man with whom he’d believed he’d spend the rest of his life with.
Draco’s head is still on Potter, his face floating to the edges of Draco’s mind.
Harry nods, “me neither. But if I’ve got to be around him for hours, alone, the wanker and I have to be civil, don’t we?” Letting out a dramatic sigh, he flops onto Ginny’s lap.
“Is this because you broke up with Ginny?” Su Li asked, her eyes narrowing. Although she’d been shy all her life, the scars on her back had left her with anger and no lack of confidence in her worth.
Malfoy flinches at the mention of Voldemort, the red eyes flashing in his memories.
and so it begins...
Harry smiles at Draco and sits back down, “Let’s eat? We’ll call Pansy and Blaise as soon as we’re done.”
Snorting, Harry responds, “not like it stops me now.”
His hands clutch the broomstick he’d made sure to take as he’d jumped off the tower and Harry leaps onto it, a move he’d perfected over the summer. Harry leans forward on the stick, attempting to go as fast as he can to catch up to the other boy as he falls through the air.
And as Draco was reaching for the last vestiges of his sanity, he hears a quiet shriek and a giggle from one of the bookstacks. There went his sanity. He knows exactly what the students got up to in the Library stacks (excluding himself, of course) and has no want nor need for finding out which student is huddled back there with their partner. Standing, Draco makes for a quick exit, carefully averting his eyes from what he’s sure to find. Unluckily, he hears a gruff voice shush whatever girl made the giggle, and the familiar voice stops him in his tracks. Draco knew all about Harry Potter’s female conquests, but in the stacks? Really? Draco dips his head past the first stack and immediately eyes the couple, pressed up against the dusty History of Magic textbooks. Potter’s face is buried in the girl’s neck, and she arches up, letting out a soft mewling sound, her face recognizable. Draco leaps back, carefully keeping out of sight. Padma Patil claws at Potter’s back, letting out little noises at
“Where’s the textbook now?”
Draco's face twists as he watches Potter shrug and fall into the chair beside him, loose-limbed without a care.
. And I think he’s scared of me, and I had his wand this
The little sparkle in Harry’s eyes when he casts a spell, the lip bite when he struggles with a potion, it was all the little things. It hadn’t started out that way. At first, Potter's fidgets in class and muted groans after a failed spell felt like spiders crawling up Draco's spine; he wanted to swat them away, and when he couldn’t, the anger grew. It was rare that he would speak on these feelings; he feared the wrath of the entire Gryffindor house, not willing to submit himself to anything more than glares and shoulder shoves in the halls.
and a new one! it took me a little longer to write because i lost the thread, but that's alright! it's here. if u left a comment, that would make my day :)
“Sure, Hermione.”
“What?” Harry asks, confused. Malfoy refuses to look at him, his nose stained a pretty,
“You know you’re not slick, right? I know you think I’m obsessed with Potter, but I’m not, you wankers.”
“What?” Harry asks, staring at Malfoy, who looks a little shell shocked.
Shaking his head, Draco focuses on the current situation, suddenly aware of how Blaise and Pansy are manipulating this situation. Both of his best friends are smart, maybe smarter than Draco in a lot of ways, but this time, Draco caught on.
In the end, it took a broken nose and a burnt face to bring the two boys together.
“Pansy? Seriously?” He hisses, jerking his chin at Draco. Draco stares confusedly at the two of them, as Pansy rolls her eyes and plops down beside Draco on his bed.
“Aren’t you?” Blaise asks, attention suddenly caught by Draco. “Isn’t he attractive?”
“So why the sun? I couldn’t see it from the bottom of the tower.” Harry's on a roll, one question answered, why not a few others?
beta’ed by the lovely
Draco nods hurriedly, and slashes his wand, calling out the next offensive spell. Weasley blocks it with ease and shoots back another. Draco stumbles backward, but manages to give a weak defensive spell, Weasley shoots another, and another, expecting Draco to counteract properly because of his skill in charms. Draco cannot. he throws up another Protego, the spell not strong enough to fully defend against Weasley's.
Hogwarts didn’t have rain. But today it was cloudy, the sky was angry, and the castle’s magic was grieving. The castle had loved Sirius Black, his laughs and antics beloved by the magic, a harmony that soaked the tapestries. His loss, coupled with the upcoming slow death of the Headmaster crippled the castle’s love.
When he comes out of the bathroom, the apartment smells of food, and he glances at the bedroom door, making sure it’s shut so the smell doesn’t get into their clothes.
“Yes? I just, I just wanted to talk to you.”
Harry winces, but cannot help but watch as Malfoy turns back to the sky, head raised upwards.
Lunch is harder. Most days they’d pack their own lunches. But, on the days they’d go out and buy lunch, they’d text each other pictures of the delectable food items, hoping for an amusing fit of jealousy from the other. Now, Harry refuses to order food. He eats a simple and bland lunch, rarely leaving the four walls to talk to his colleagues.
No. No. No. He’d been thinking for too long, no no no. The heels of his hands dig into his eyes, as he attempts to stop the tears. It works.Harry sucks in trembling gasps and manages to control himself. He’s sweating in his t-shirt, and he has a feeling the other people in the park are staring at him. He lurches upwards, unbalanced. Deep breaths, he reminds himself, deep breaths. And he manages to control his breathing. His eyes open and he wipes his sweaty palms on his joggers. Exercise is hard these days. He gets through a mile and his head gets foggy and he’s unable to think of anything but Draco. Recently, his mind betrayed him and began attempting to conjure scenes of how Draco died. He knew it wasn’t on impact, that Draco had scrambled for life in the last precious moments, but it hadn’t been enough. The police were kind enough not to give him any of the car crash’s explicit details, but now he was attempting to fill the empty spots in. His worst nightmares were of Draco, and Harry would wake up panting, Draco’s bloody body seared into the back of his eyelids.
“Always catching me at the worst times, huh Potter?”
Hermione sits up from her reclining position on the couch, letting her book fall into her lap.
Harry leans forward, intent on catching Draco before he hits the ground. And then Harry has one hand clutched on the back of Draco's robes. He pulls and pulls, clenching his legs tightly around the broomstick, careful to keep his balance. But Draco is too heavy and both boys fall towards the ground, the broomstick simply slowing the fall.
Harry doesn’t know exactly why, but he understands one thing, “it’s not your time yet.”
And Draco wants to answer now, he wants Potter, Harry, to understand why he wants to throw himself off this godforsaken tower.
“Yeah.”
He glances upward, a look of absolute reverence flooding his face, “thank you.”
There’s no response.
me? Wow.”
an apology: there is very little ‘british slang’ in this fic. i am so american it’s disgusting. if someone whos from anywhere in the u.k. or if you’re super versed in british slang, please comment. i’d absolutely adore for you to go through this, adding slang to make it feel more intune with the harry potter verse.
Mrs. Norris is hanging, incredibly still, there is a pool of standing water beneath her, and there is writing on the wall, in blood: THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED. ENEMIES OF THE HEIR...BEWARE. And worst of all, Harry and his friends are standing there staring at it when what seems like half the student body finds them after the feast.
“Nope!” Harry grins, and Draco gives in and grins back. “So what are you reading?” Harry asks again.
"Who gave it to you?" Ron asks, his fingers running over the cloth in awe.
"Harry?" he asks when he doesn't get a response.
“Er, professor? Ron and Hermione and my Aunt and Uncle already know.”
“Today’s my birthday,” he mumbles. “I’m tired, I don’t wanna talk.”
Draco makes another run for the chair when the snitch moves out of the corner, going towards his bed. Harry outruns him this time, tripping and belly flopping on the bed just before he gets the snitch. Draco laughs at him as he runs around and climbs up on his nightstand to grab it.
"Of course not, Father," Draco hurries to assure, looking his father dead in the eye as stoically as he can.
“Prove it.”
discussing this on the stairs,” Hermione says sternly. Ron rolls his eyes at Harry over her shoulder but goes back up to their room, and they follow.
Harry still looks confused, looking around Draco’s bedroom. “Have I visited you before then?”
Suddenly, all is quiet, and Harry is falling as if the chair has been taken out from under him. And it has - he finds himself lying on the cold stone of an empty corridor, his skin feeling perfectly fine again.
It has the effect he wants; both Potter and Weasley stand up, ready to fight. They’ll never be a match on Crabbe and Goyle though, and they have to know that.
Harry looked around, and indeed many of the students' heads were nodding.
"No no no, love," the man says, swooping in to pick him up.
Afterwards, he packed and headed off, out of town toward a place no one would know him. Preferably, where no one would see the lightning bolt scar on his head and recognize him as another victim of the Lord of the Waste. It was hard on his suddenly-old joints, and more than once he startled when the wind blew his now-white hair into the corners of his vision.
"Whoa. Why is it in Hogwarts then? Why don't you have it? I mean, I guess you wouldn't know," Harry's face heats. Obviously neither of these men know what they're going to be doing so far into the future.
is the unspoken implication. “I’ll just go to bed early tonight.”
"What are we going to do?"
Draco raises an eyebrow. “I was going to play quidditch.”
“No way! You’re from the future! That’s so cool! Who won the last Quidditch World Cup? Father says he’s going to take me to the next one in England. Do you play quidditch? I’m going to be on the house team at Hogwarts when I grow up.”
"My-" Harry's voice cracks. "My parents," he whispers, and he can feel the tears starting up again. He turns away. "I'm sorry I didn't find anything out," he mumbles into his pillow.
"Kinda looks like a guy holding a hat out now," Harry said.
“And Ronald thinks you just went off to the loo without telling us, when I clearly saw him disappear from his chair!” The last part is directed at Ron, who immediately begins arguing back.
"Blimey," Ron breathes. "Time travel."
"Look at this!! Look at it!!"
his father says. But no one has ever apparated into his room before, besides the house elves and Harry, and Harry hasn’t visited in forever. And this stranger is acting like he knows Draco, when Draco has never seen him before in his life.
Most worrying is the sound of a beast snarling, and Harry can all too easily picture its eyes glaring angrily and its jaw snapping. Part of him wants to help whoever is being snarled at, and although he's wandless and in an unknown corridor, he takes a few steps forward. Before he can go too far, he hears a deep voice cursing Hagrid's love of ridiculous creatures and a door clicking closed, silencing the beast.
The next day they were all set up by the time Harry woke up. They had breakfast inside with Pansy, and then went out to their picnic area, a meadow with a stream running next to it, while the manor sat stationary for once. Teddy stopped to turn and wave to Pansy, and saw a tendril of flame wave back.
“In trouble, are you lad?” the gargoyle asks as he steps aside to show the spiral staircase.
"It’d be great if you could travel to the future and find out who it is," Ron says when they get word that Justin Finch-Fletchley is petrified now too.
Draco grins at Harry, hoping he will be distracted by his joke and not mention that he had almost slipped up again and called mudbloods mudbloods in front of Harry. It's pretty much the only rule Harry has ever given him in their time together: Draco can slouch, slurp his soup, dance, make silly faces, and do whatever he wants that his parents never approve of, so he makes an effort not to say 'mudblood' in front of him.
"Harry. You also mentioned that a professor was attempting to retrieve the stone. Do you wish to share your theories with me?"
Draco grins. He tells Harry all about Greg and Vince and Pansy and the snitch cake and the game of ground quidditch they played, and doesn’t notice when he falls asleep cuddled up in Harry’s strong arms.
"It's before curfew, Harry."
Another elf apparates in front of him with the characteristic loud crack.  "Dobby is not being here, Master Draco," she says.
“The belt,” she repeats slowly. “The belt! There’s your other circular object!”
“Get in the other side,” he tells Harry, who chuckles and then slides under the covers on the other side of the bed. They lay there together for a while, staring at the charmed ceiling showing the night sky full of stars.
It turned out that Harry was actually a very good handyman. Draco had been convinced it was just a ruse to stay in the manor, but he had to say he was impressed by all the work Harry had accomplished in organizing the closet. The shelves were level and separated the extra hand soap from the floor cleaning solution and the plumbing supplies, and a whole shelf was dedicated to things Harry must have gotten for his other various projects. The brooms were tucked in the back corner, leaving room for the other bits and bobs that Harry hadn't found a place for yet.
He met her eyes with a little self deprecating smile. “He reverts to his real age when he’s sleeping. His real hair color is black, did you know? He’s- he’s beautiful, and he doesn’t even try, Pans.”
"Oh I've been practicing with Teddy all week," Harry said easily.
"But it's regarding the Philosopher's Stone!"
Whatever they talked about, Teddy was just happy that it meant that Harry was staying.
"Gideon Prewett," one red haired wizard introduces himself, "and my brother Fabian."
"I hope I'm in love with my wife someday. As long as it isn't Pansy." Draco makes a face at the thought.
"So he is?"
"You said there was someone else like me. What happened to them?"
"Hm."
"You look like you're about to keel over. I'm going to make you a cup of tea and you're going back to bed. Wherever you're going can wait."
Harry twitches and makes a face. “I have to go now, but keep an eye out for me, okay Draco?”
"But- it- no one was in the corridors!"
Harry's in the common room with Ron and Hermione, trying to finish up the foot-long charms essay due tomorrow when it happens. His chest starts to itch, and the itching spreads across his skin like a wave. Suddenly the skin on his fingers and toes feels like it's simultaneously too big and too small, and when he looks down at his hands he expects to see - well, something that would explain the feeling. But his hands look the same as they always do, even when he clenches them into fists to stop himself from scratching.
And while Draco can't say he's looking forward to marrying Pansy or being humiliated by Harry in the future, he is proud of being Harry's favourite time travel trip. After all, Harry has been traveling ever since he was younger than Draco, and he's old now!
“Yes.”
“He’s right. Do you think you can tell us what happened now?”
"Are you serious?" Draco had asked, gesturing at the giant mess, but Harry only replied, "I'll clean it up before dinner," without turning around.
“Then how am I supposed to change the future? If everything has already happened in your life, then mine is predetermined, at least up to the point of however old you are, if not longer.”
Dumbledore steeples his hands contemplatively. “May I ask what occurred during these early trips?”
“Yeah, could be,” Harry agrees.
“I’m young!” Harry exclaimed, and hooked his elbow into Teddy’s, turning them around in a dance around the room.
Harry has to admit that in all the conjecture about the meaning of his time travel, he's never considered that it might be trying to trick him.
“Least they’re not charmed holes,” Ron says brightly. “One year Fred and George charmed a few pairs of my socks to grow bigger and bigger holes the closer it got to Christmas so mum would have to buy me new ones as a present.”
“You forget that I know you in the future. At least now I know how you cheated. Alright, I’ll tell you which team caught the snitch, but I’m not telling you the score.
Draco turns his head, almost turns his body, and stares at the other teenager. He watches the other boy watch him like he’s a scared cat.
“Baby, this tastes exactly like your mom’s. I feel like I’m back in your house.”
Lifting his wand, Malfoy carefully casts the spell, the shield shimmering strongly ahead of him. Within a few seconds, however, it seems to shudder and fall as Malfoy loses confidence in his spell. Harry’s interested. He has Malfoy run through spell after spell, each showing the same strength for a few seconds, and then spectacularly failing, even the offensive spells.
Ginny almost chokes on her laughter, and she has to push Harry away from her to fully keel over and laugh. And laugh and laugh. “Merlin, Harry. You’re a lost cause. You’re lucky I’m in love with you, or I’d have smacked you long ago.”
Harry creeps closer to the boy, careful to keep quiet, “I'll tell you why I'd want to jump off the tower, if you tell me.” Harry says suddenly, sure that this exchange of information would tempt bully malfoy.
draco has a crisis about casting a patronus & maybe the beginning of an ever greater crisis.
“Are we talking about Draco’s obsession with Potter, again?” Blaise swings his arm over Draco’s shoulder, his dark skin a beautiful contrast with Draco’s pale complexion.
Flinching, Malfoy falls silent, feeling a little stupid. “Right. Right.”
“What…” Potter trails off as the book seems to explode with colors and words. Draco bites his lip as he sees his notes splash onto the paper. Each of his highlights, underlined words, doodles, and margin notes are all clear for Potter to see. Draco isn’t sure what prompted him to let Potter see it all, but he imagines it has something to do with the saddened sighs that had been coming from the other student. The guilt Draco felt never decreased, sometimes angry words remedied it, but in this situation, it seemed only giving Potter a nudge in the right direction would ease Draco’s pounding skull.
“When I die, I want to see the sun.”
Girls flocked to him (and so did some boys), but Ginny was always in the back of his mind, her smiling face a comfort not always awarded to him. Although they were still on their pre-war/mid-war/post-war break, Harry knew she would always be there for him, would always be the kind eyes that centered him on his worst days. Meanwhile, Ginny was pushing him to date outside of his own head, go out with girls, maybe even some boys, to really
“What?” Draco says, immediately confused. “No, he’s not. He looks like a drowned rat half the time.”
This catches Malfoy's attention, and the boy turns again, just his head this time. His jawline sharpens against the blue sky, and Harry can only see half his face this way, but he continues talking, too scared that Malfoy would turn back around.
leave a comment, maybe a kudos <3
. He can’t tell this to Hermione or Ron, their accusing looks from sixth year flooding back. There’s only one person who he imagines would have a competent answer for him. Or at least an answer as to why Malfoy didn’t seem so
Draco hums noncommittally and tosses a potions book at Potter, “get to reading.”
“Class! Split up, each house in one corner.” The defense professor orders, a tall, scarred man from Spain, his accent thick. Professor Vargas was… difficult. He had little patience for students with attitude, and students with any connection to the Dark Arts, so Draco was immediately branded as his least favorite, and Potter? The favorite.
This time Harry’s taken aback. He hadn’t expected a response like that, rather just a clear answer. Weren’t girls supposed to be easy to talk to? Granted, Hermione never was, but Ginny had always been like refreshing water after a dry day.
Harry’s eyes widen slightly, and the shy smile on Malfoy is a bit unsettling. Harry immediately wants to get rid of it, feeling more comfortable with a sneer.
There’s no response.
“I don’t need the Defense NEWT. It doesn’t matter if I pass or not,” Draco says stubbornly. He hikes his bag further up his shoulder, hand gripped at the strap.
for him, no questions asked.
“Malfoy! I asked you to stay behind today,” Vargas orders from his desk, not glancing up from grading papers. Pansy gives Draco a frown and continues to pack up her things, Blaise already gone to the baths. Draco slumps his shoulders and approaches Vargas’s desk.
understand what she’d said wrong to lose his interest in the moment. Maybe it was the meds from the hospital wing? maybe.
“Dueling forms!” Vargas yells, Draco shifts in position, “go!”

“I’m not being an
She giggles, “it sure was!”
Draco leans forward, ready to grip Harry's hand when a scream reverberates through the tower. It scares Draco and he topples backward, balance lost.
Harry's exhausted. The day has been long and tiring and the hour is late. The sun set not too long ago, and the night sky is now clogged with the smog of the city. Harry steps out of the metro staircase and makes his way home. To the small apartment six floors up, with its big windows, and tiny bathroom; with the dead plants in the corner and the empty plates under the couch; with the always running radio and the growing pile of clothes in the corner. His home. Harry unlocks the building with the first key and begins his trek up the staircase, since the elevator is always broken. His sweaty button-down clings to his back and his dress pants to his thighs. His suit jacket hangs over one shoulder, parallel to his work bag. He’d gone to work early, and is coming home late, the day filled with strenuous meetings and hours of reports and filing. He flicks to the second key on the ring and unlocks the door to his apartment, preparing for the view on the other side.

Harry is successful, however, as the broomstick slows the fall just enough that hitting the ground is not fatal, rather it’s simply just backbreaking (a job for Madam Pomfrey to fix). The two boys slam against the ground, tangled around each other. They pass out instantly from the pain, but they’re alive. They’re alive. The castle and her magic rejoice. And although the year would prove to be innumerably difficult, the two boys are alive, and well enough to breathe enough for each other.
Harry glances back at him, looking at the older teen. He looked worried and out-of-sorts, his nose still red. Harry avoids the question.
Draco stares blankly at Potter. “Severus hated you. How did you get ahold of his book?”
been months since everything went down. And I’m sure he’s trying to move on. I can’t see you two being friends, though.”
“I’m tutoring Potter in Potions,” Draco sighs, “and he’s tutoring me in Defense.”
Pansy lets out a sudden whoop, clapping her hands excitedly until Blaise smacks her arm.
“Ok so we’re going to dive straight into just spells,” Harry says, rubbing his palms against his jeans. “I’m sure you know how to wave a wand.”
Christmas is Draco’s favorite time of the year. He’ll walk through suburban neighborhoods to see the lights twinkle, and starts listening to Christmas music when the calendar hits October. Christmas has always represented the best of Draco’s family, and he harbors a warm feeling for the holiday in his chest. Harry understands Draco’s love for the season, for the day, and he lets Draco plan a day (or season) of joy.
“Shush, Harry,” Hermione interrupts, “Pomfrey’s going to take a look at you. Let’s go. Professor Slughorn, do you mind if I take Harry down to the Hospital Wing?”
“For you, Harry? Always.” Ginny replies. She waves away the young girls sitting at her feet, a collective groan coming from them. “Shhh. I’ll be back later! Go do some work, I’m sure Slughorn’s assigned you some.” She says, shooing the girls away.
“Aren’t you on the quidditch team?” he teases, “out of breath already?”
Hermione reaches over to pat Harry’s knee, “I’m sure if you can approach a girl that’s not Ginny, you can handle a few hours with Malfoy as your student.” She smiles at Harry and picks her book back up. “Now leave, silly. You’ll be late, and Malfoy will whinge about that for hours.”
“And there’s the smack.” Ginny gently smacks his cheek, letting out a peal of giggles after. After taking a few, maybe more than a few, deep breaths, Ginny gets a reign on her laughter. “Well, it
“Malfoy. What, what are you doing?”
Malfoy stares at Harry and shrugs, “alright. And you’re helping me?”
“Are you serious?” Draco hisses at Potter immediately after they leave the Defense classroom. Draco can’t believe his luck. He knew he was bad at Defense, and he knew he couldn’t improve, no matter what Potter or Vargas did. Draco had hoped he could coast through the class, scraping by with the worst of marks, and failing the NEWT, but it seemed in vain.
“Okay. Li & Thomas, Longbottom & Macmillan,” Vargas rattles off pairings, making sure to choose people from different houses. This year, only 16 Eighth years had come back. Some classes, like Potions, they were grouped with the Seventh years, but others, like DADA, it was just them.
Looking away, Potter shrugs. “It was an accident, not like he gave it to me.”  Draco can’t seem to process what Potter’s telling him. Severus had been an extraordinary potioneer, but annotating a potions-making textbook? And letting it fall into Potter’s hands?

“Am I serious? You’re tutoring me in Potions, which, by the way, sounds terrifying, and now you’re being an arse about me tutoring
Draco grabs his hand and snatches the spoon from Harry, throwing it into the sink. Draco puts both of Harry’s hands in his own, and they begin to dance. The music envelops them, and there is almost as much laughter as there is music. Harry dips Draco back and spins him around, and Draco does the same to Harry, almost dropping him as Draco dips him down, his hands splayed out on Harry’s back.
“Listen Potty,” Draco spits, “I can figure it out myself. I’ll tutor you in Potions, but I don’t want your help.” He scowls at Potter and watches the other boy wrack his brain for a sufficient answer.
Draco waits for his name, head tilted as he watches Pansy be paired (with Granger), and then Blaise (with Smith), and finally, “Malfoy and Weasley!” Vargas orders. Draco watches as Weasley groans, and Potter pats him on the back before joining his own partner.
Draco spins to face Potter, minutely shaking his head at the younger student. Potter eyes Draco and then Vargas, glancing back and forth before biting his lip and nodding.
Letting out a shaky breath, Draco refocuses on the book in front of him, circling an ingredient and crossing out the next, listening to Potter breathe as he reads his own textbook.
Harry reaches up to touch it, “Merlin, that hurt,” he says, eyes wide and adrenaline pumping through his veins.
It's easy to forget. He’d blink and the memory was gone, another laugh and smile forgotten. The little wrinkles outside Draco’s eyes, the white scars scattered on Draco’s chest, forming patterns Harry loved to trace with his tongue. But some days, Harry blinks and he can almost hear Draco, can almost feel Draco’s skin under his fingers, can almost see Draco’s scars on his chest. Those days are the worst. Harry comes back and he expects to see Draco beside him, his head thrown back, soaking in the sun, but Draco is never there.
“Well obviously, Harry! A boiling potion exploded in your face! Why can’t you ever be more careful!” Hermione has a worried look on her face, berating him.
. Panting, he says, “I think this is the most I’ve ever used magic.”
Draco narrows his eyes at her, but indulges his friend, “it’s boring. I had him read my potions textbook yesterday…” He’s interrupted by Pansy’s voice.
“Got it!” Harry calls, tossing the hawthorn wand at Malfoy. He doesn’t catch it, letting the wand fall onto the floor before him.
Vargas holds up a hand and levels Draco with a serious gaze, “I seriously don’t doubt you’re a smart kid. You know your stuff, and it’s obvious you’re scared of this class,” Draco opens his mouth to interrupt, glancing surreptitiously back at Potter, but Vargas shakes his head, cutting off any attempt of Draco’s.
“I’m sorry. I’m sorry.” Draco sniffles and rubs his nose.
“Harry, Harry, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you,” the words are whispered and Harry does not hear them, but Draco chants his prayer at the beautiful teen for trying. For trying so hard to catch him, to save him. He’s lost hope, waiting for the ground to hit him, the sun blotted out by the clouds above him, and simply shadows below him.
He’s got two hours until Defense tutoring and Draco is nervous. He’s not sure why, but he thinks it’s got something to do with the fact that Draco is so terrible at Defense. Even the thought of raising his stupid (borrowed from his mom) wand, seems to send a wave of nervous energy through his bones. And he knew he’d done a shit job “tutoring” Potter, but he hasn’t been able to muster anything better. Hopefully, Potter would do the same tonight and relieve Draco of any leftover guilt.
