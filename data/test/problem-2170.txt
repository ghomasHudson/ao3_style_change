“Wonderful,” Draco smirked, “Of course, I imagine we both failed History, as we left before we could take the exam.”
"I'm glad to help," Draco smiled, "And seeing you blush is just a bonus." He laughed at Hadrian's glare and gave him a gentle shove towards the bathroom; "Now, go take your shower and then you need to rest as Severus directed." Hadrian rolled his eyes but entered the bathroom none-the-less and got under the shower.
“Are you alright, Harry?” A soft hand rested on his shoulder, and Harry found himself staring into the warm brown eyes of his ex-wife.
Once the children were all settled in, Lucius raised a protective circle around them so that the adults could talk without having to worry about the children over-hearing, even though they really weren't old enough to understand.
Harry narrowed his eyes further and growled threateningly, but the blonde just laughed, reaching out with one long finger to touch Harry's scar in a way so reminiscent of Voldemort in the graveyard two years ago that Harry whimpered in remembered fear, causing Malfoy's eyes to widen as he dropped his hand and Harry closed his eyes in relief.
"I was wondering about something, Narcissa," Hadrian ventured as they were finishing tea; they being Hadrian, Draco, Lucius, Narcissa and Severus-Tom had left to attend to his Death Eater's, "Sirius mentioned that you have two sisters, but I didn't see Andromeda in any of the memories. Were you not close to her?"
“There’s something missing though,” Harry said a few hours later; the two were sitting side-by-side on the couch again, each sitting facing one another, with one leg on the couch, “Dumbledore has been calling me in for meetings all year, to teach me what I need to know to defeat Voldemort, but all we’ve done is look at memories from the past. I know he never had love growing up, but it seems like Dumbledore is leading up to something big; what if there is more to defeating him than just flooding him with emotions?”
"Get used to it," Tom said with slight amusement, "For I will be doing everything in my power to protect my son from now on.” He paused for a moment, as if debating whether or not to continue, “Speaking of our familial relation, Harry, would you like to have the blood adoptions cancelled? And…you can go back to using your original name, but only if you wish."
Harry closed his eyes and tried to force himself to breathe evenly, but the stinging hexes got worse and he was dying for release. Harry whimpered softly when the vibrations stopped, even as the stinging hex increased. He really hadn’t thought this one through! He wouldn’t even be able to sit tomorrow!
“Yes!” Harry cried, “Come on!” Draco pumped his three fingers in and out of Harry’s hole, making sure to brush against his prostate occasionally, and watched as his lover tried to move his hips and get him to go faster.
"I was going to start on my schoolwork," Hadrian replied, "Then probably go through my trunk and maybe send Neville and Luna a letter. Draco was going to get some books on dragons so that we can learn more about Arden."
"Someone took him as we were leaving the ministry," Narcissa replied, "Draco was unable to locate him. Severus has gone to Hogwarts to see if Dumbledore had anything to do with it."
"Master Draco!" Draco sat up with a groan as Tillie popped in, "You is having guests in the study; should Tillie be bringing them here?"
“Harry, I have been drawn to you ever since we met in Madame Malkin’s,” Draco said seiriously, “I believe that we were always destined to end up together, and we might have been friends if the Dark Lord had not been resurrected. Can you honestly tell me that you don’t feel the same? That you could walk away right now, and never wonder what might have been?”
"I shall mention it to him," Lucius agreed, "Now, if you boys aren't busy it's time for supper;" he led the way downstairs, telling the boys, "Severus has left for the evening to speak with Tom, and they will both return sometime tomorrow. Have you decided on your sleeping arrangements?"
"Make them slaves once we've taken over," Draco suggested, "They can work off their crimes by serving those they have harmed. In fact, we can use that as a cover story for Har-er, I mean Hadrian; when we go back to school we can tell everyone I found him and tricked him into wearing this collar so that now he is my slave and then we will put about that this is how you plan to deal with all of your enemies rather than waste your time killing everyone." Draco loomed extremely pleased with himself, and Hadrian saw that Tom appeared to be taking the suggestion seriously.
“Well, I can read the Parseltongue, of course, but all these symbols…” Hadrian trailed off thoughtfully, “Tom mentioned that Runes and Arithmancy were used to write the books as well; didn’t you take both of those classes?”
“Oh, I made tea bags last night so that we could give the customer’s a free sample,” Luna told him, “This way, people won’t think we’re mean when we tell them they have to go.”
“He is not a stray,” Narcissa said forcefully, “Harry is our son’s friend, and he will be staying with us-permanently.”
“That man,” Pansy fumed, glaring at Harry's back, “Why does he have to make everything so difficult? He is so frustrating!”
"Aw, waiting for me? How sweet," Fred teased as he joined them, shutting the door and setting up some privacy charms before taking a seat next to his brother, "Okay, so you want to tell us what's going on Harry? And why you're suddenly friends with the mini-Malfoy? And why you look different."
"I warned you Potter," Draco drawled as Harry slowly sat up, "That collar binds you to my family; if you attack one of us then it will cause you pain-now that you are here it also binds you to Malfoy lands unless I give you permission to leave or remove the collar." At that last part Harry's ears perked up, only to droop again when Malfoy laughed at him, "Oh no Potter, I have no intention of removing that collar, not yet anyway. Now, we still need to get inside so we can talk, but we definitely don't want a repeat of this little stunt, so..."
"Look, I really would feel more comfortable in my own bed," Hadrian explained, "Also, I have never really had my own room before-I mean, I slept in Dudley's broken toy room, but it was never mine; I want my own room!" He paused, then added, “Besides, it’s not like we would stop hanging out just because I have my own bedroom; I don’t know about you, but I tend to get bored very quickly when I’m by myself all the time.”
“Perhaps they are dating,” Draco suggested, “Come on; let’s get ready for dinner; Severus is coming over tonight, I believe.”
“Well, after my parents were killed, my aunt Petunia and her husband Vernon took me in,” Harry began, making himself comfortable on the loveseat, “I’m not really sure why they did it though, because they’ve always resented me being there. The Dursley’s don’t like magic or anything abnormal; I didn’t even know I was a wizard until my eleventh birthday…”
“I just wanted to speak to you about this evening,” Narcissa said, “This supper is very important, as I am sure you already know.”
"I believe you too," James said, "Dumbledore has been acting very strange, and the way he stuck up for Peter…if you need our help, the Marauder's stand behind you 100%!" Sirius and Remus nodded their agreement.
"He won't be in any danger," Lucius began, "However Draco will want him close by otherwise he will be in great distress. Most Veela do not find their mate until after both have turned sixteen, however in the few cases where they find and recognize each other early, they needed to be together to prevent mental anguish for the Veela. I am not sure exactly what will happen however, as each relationship between a Veela and their mate is different. The only thing I know for certain is that Draco will require Hadrian to be near him, and he will be possessive. The need will diminish after a time, but the amount of time is also different for each couple."
I have been trying to get in touch with you since early this afternoon, but you have not responded; I do hope you have not been injured. It is of utmost importance that you contact me or return to Hogwarts as soon as you are able; the note that I received last night was from Harry Potter, and I believe he may be in trouble and need our assistance. You are the only one I can fully trust with this Severus, so please respond promptly; if you are injured or in danger Fawkes can bring you to me.
Thirty minutes later Hadrian had finished drying off and dressed in a comfortable pair of jeans and a soft T-shirt that he had found in his closet; he thought he recognized the clothes from the shopping trip earlier, but he couldn't be sure. Once he was dressed Hadrian hesitated before opening the door to Draco's room, both eager and uncomfortable at the thought of seeing Draco half-dressed again.
"I had no idea," George replied, equally awe-struck, "A miniature French Sentinel; the full-size dragon is very protective of his-well, we call it an owner, but you can never truly own a dragon. They choose a witch or wizard to bond with though, which is why French Sentinels are the only full-size dragons that it is legal to own, for lack of a better word. Miniature dragons are a different story-it's legal to own any type of miniature dragon as long as it is purchased from a licensed pet shop or breeder-but they are also very rare. "
“I was wondering if you would show up,” Snape sneered at him, “Well? Sit down Potter. The sooner we get this over with, the sooner I can get you out of my office.”
"If you do well during the week then you will have your weekends free," Lucius replied, "and you will have more time to yourselves once you complete your schoolwork."
“Yes, because having a picnic in the gardens is such hard work,” Hadrian laughed as he walked towards the door, “Come on prat; let’s go.”
"I think Arden is a good name," Draco replied, looking down at the dragon he asked, "What do you think?" The dragon looked up at him with wide blue eyes and nuzzled his hand.
The feeling of cool air against his skin drew a sharp hiss from Hadrian, and then Draco was trailing his lips down across his collarbone; Draco used one hand to prop himself up a little, while he trailed the other one further down his Mates' body, his fingers gently brushing against Hadrian's cock, which had begun stirring interestedly.
“This one also has more protections on it,” Draco informed him, handing over the instructions the twins had provided.
Albus smiled to himself; he would be able to get Harry back on the right side if he shared the information about the Horcruxes. If need be, he could alter Harry's memory as well-just enough to make him forget about what Harry had overheard the other night. Albus had spent many years cultivating the boys Gryffindor nature, even going as far as to ensure he became friends with young Ronald; he made sure Hagrid told him how evil Slytherins were, and the naïve boy had fallen for it. Once he had Harry back in his grasp it wouldn't be too hard to turn him away from the Malfoy's, and then his plan would be back on track and he, Albus Dumbledore, would once again be heralded as the savior of the Wizarding World-the defender of the Greater Good.
"Will you two stop being so cryptic and tell me what's going on?" Harry demanded, earning himself a glare from Voldemort, “What? You’re obviously talking about me, or something that concerns me, and so I think I have a right to know what it is! Or, are you going to be like
“Well, I suppose you can take the fun way,” Draco said, then leaned in to whisper, “But you have to aim for Uncle Harry, deal?”
“Not going to happen,” Harry glared at the brunet witch, then looked over her shoulder as the sound of giggling caught his attention; “Luna? I didn’t know you were here. Parkinson, give me some real clothes now.”
Unbeknownst to Harry, his silencing charm did not work as well as he thought it would. Draco Malfoy had been in his bathroom, getting ready for bed, when he heard a muffled moan. Holding himself still, the blond listened for it to come again, and realized that it came from the room next to him-Potter’s room. Draco quickly finished changing into his pajamas and went out into the common room to stand in front of Potter’s door, only to frown when he realized he couldn’t hear the moans anymore. Draco slowly made his way back to the bathroom and stood next to the wall; yes, he could hear the soft moans once more. Should he go get help? No, wait; Potter was speaking.
“Very well,” Draco sighed, “We can spend an hour or so translating the potions journal.” He summoned a quill and some parchment, before reluctantly setting it aside to accept the pen and notebook Hadrian handed to him.
"The elder Mr. Riddle sent a letter early this morning requesting we take some volumes out of the Slytherin vault and give them to Mrs. Malfoy to be transferred to his home at a later time," Griphook informed them; he pulled out an ancient-looking leather-bound book, "I just need to verify your identity first Mr. Riddle, as our contract with Salazar Slytherin states that we can only release his personal effects to his heir; once we release the books to you however you are free to hand them to Mrs. Malfoy for safe-keeping."
“I already explained the situation to them,” Dumbledore said, “There is no need for you to apologize. What happened to Dobby?”
“You’re confused, Harry,” Arthur’s voice was low, and probably meant to be soothing, but Hadrian found it to be condescending instead, “You’ve been exposed to Dark magic due to your time in Malfoy Manor, and I can’t even begin to guess what spells and potions have been used on you. Don’t worry though; Albus will sort this all out. Wait here, and we’ll be back for you soon.”
"I do have a hidden door that opens out into the hallway though," Hadrian added, "It can only be opened from the inside, so that way if someone gets into Draco's room we can still get out."
"I want to speak with you after the party Bella," Tom said as he got to his feet, "We have much to discuss. Now go to the ballroom and wait for us." Bella bowed and left the room, and Draco started to stand up but Hadrian tugged on his arm, keeping him seated.
In the end, it didn’t take long at all before Draco-the teasing bastard-had Harry begging for his lover’s cock. Draco teased him some more as he opened him up with his fingers, before finally withdrawing and undressing. Harry groaned as Draco entered him, and wrapped his legs around Draco’s waist. Evidently done with teasing, Draco started thrusting deep and hard, stealing Harry’s breath away. Sometimes Draco was gentle, and Harry loved it, but there was something about being taken roughly that drove Harry crazy; he was coming, clenching around Draco’s length, without the blond even touching his cock. Draco cursed lowly and followed, kissing and biting at the brunet’s lips as he spilled his seed deep inside his lover.
"Hurts," Hadrian replied in a hoarse voice, and Draco quickly shushed him, not wanting his friend to injure himself further. Draco trailed his fingers up from where they had been tracing the bruises and gently caressed Hadrian's cheek, although the last thing he wanted right now was to be gentle; what he really wanted to do was go after Weasley and hex him until he couldn't stand.
"Was that supposed to be a pick-up line?" Hadrian asked, "Because if so, that was lame; really lame."
After sending letters off to their allies, Narcissa made her way to Lucius’ study, where she found her husband and Tom casting a flurry of spells. After a moment of observation, she realized that the spells were all variations of tracking spells, and spells to identify a magical signature.
“A sleeping potion would probably work better,” Ron said, “Winky would probably even help you with it. Let's wait till after the new year to try that though; in the meantime, you might as well take Blaise for his fitting.”
"I'm afraid that won't do the job anymore," he said sadly, "He has had too much time to recuperate; we have worked very hard to make sure he knew his place in...
"Stop pulling Draco!" Hadrian protested, "Night Narcissa, Lucius! Draco!" He dug his heels in and pulled back hard, but Draco barely even faltered, just tightened his grip and continued to pull Hadrian up to his room, causing the brunet to stumble. "Draco; can we stop now?" Hadrian yanked his arm away once they were in Draco's room and glared at the blond, "What was that all about?"
“I am so going to pay you back for that,” Harry threatened, getting up and canceling the cushioning charm on the floor. Draco responded by blowing Harry a kiss, as Teddy tugged on the brunet’s arm.
“I don’t need any more dancing lessons,” Harry groaned, even as he stood up, “The only time I intend to dance in the future is at my wedding, and then only if I have no other choice. What you’ve taught me already is enough.”
"Okay," Hadrian agreed, "I guess I can live with that; so, now can I call-" Tapping at the window distracted the brunet and he turned to see a familiar snowy owl carrying a letter, “Oh, it's Hedwig!” Hadrian hurried over to let the snowy owl in, "Hey girl; is that from Neville?" He took the letter from her and turned to Draco, "Do you have any owl treats?"
"Tough," Draco retorted, "Someone needs to keep you calm and under control, so we will stay like this as long as we need to." He decided to keep the fact that he was incredibly turned on by the short Gryffindor in front of him a secret; now that Harry had a father, he would need to be careful not to anger the man. Speaking of Harry’s father-
"Okay, here," Draco pulled the cork out of the vial and poured the memories into the pensieve, "Do you want us to leave while you're in the pensieve? It can take a while."
"Yes," Elena nodded, "I will wait fifteen minutes and if you don't come through I will take the children to my parents in America; you and Tom both know how to contact me there." Alice nodded at this and gestured Elena to the fireplace; Alice tossed the Floo powder in for her friend, and then Elena stepped in and stated her destination, disappearing with the twins.
"In just a little while things are going to change," she told the children, "I don't know how different it will be, but I hope that no matter what you stick together, because I sense you will need one another. And no matter what, remember that I love you, and your parents love you; do whatever you must to stay safe." She pressed a kiss to the top of each of the children's foreheads just as the whoosh of the fireplace announced Dumbledore's return; he stepped into the room followed by a tall blonde man.
“I-” Harry hesitated, but realized that he was actually very cold; he hadn’t noticed before, but his teeth were chattering, and he was barely holding on to his wand.
“All done, Harry?” Narcissa asked, and he nodded, “If you call Frost, he can put the gifts away for you; I have assigned Frost and Noelle to you.”
Harry was ashamed to find himself incredibly turned on by the seductive voice whispering in his ear. Whomever was watching him seemed to know what he needed better than Harry himself, and the brunet was having trouble remembering to be mad at the unknown man in front of him. The soft voice-which was vaguely familiar-whispered filthy words, only serving to make Harry harder as the dildo continued to impale him, a half inch at a time.
"Fine," Harry sighed, leaning back into the pillows and closing his eyes so he wouldn't have to look at anyone, "I guess I should start at the beginning, with my family. Okay, so my relatives have never liked me and they neglected me and called me names all throughout my childhood; they told me my parents were worthless and dies in a car accident and also that magic wasn't real, yet whenever anything happened they blamed me and locked me in the cupboard, although they stopped beating me when I was about eight and my accidental magic destroyed the living room."
"Oh, she's perfect!" Molly cooed, and she and Arthur walked off a few paces to fawn over their new daughter. Harry and Draco watched as a Muggle couple was brought in, and Helena suffered the same fate, being blood-adopted to Muggles who had their memories changed to believe that she was always their child.
“You couldn’t have knocked first?” Harry grumbled, “We were kind of busy; I have better things to do than worry about who won a stupid bet.”
“Good job Teddy!” Harry praised, “If you ask nicely, maybe Uncle Draco will let you take the fun way down.”
“Doesn’t matter,” Harry shrugged, “Whatever he wants is fine. If he wants to call off the bet, that’s fine too.”
After supper, the two boys returned to their reading; Draco was going through the books to find more information on the ritual, while Harry, who was determined to avoid thinking about said ritual, was reading a book of wizarding children’s stories that he found in the sitting room.
"I'm sure he'll come up with something believable," Lucius said distractedly as he read through the notebook, "These are Sev's notes on Horcruxes; I gave him a series of books for Christmas a few years ago, and it seems they have a lot of information on things that are considered Dark Arts. Not only that, but it says here that they were written by Godric Gryffindor's grandson Mathias, and Rowena Ravenclaw's grandniece Lorena; they describe Dark Rituals and potions, but they also list ways to reverse them. It seems Mathias and Lorena both created Horcruxes and were trying to develop a way to reunite the soul with its original vessel, but Severus said the potions book and parts of the other books are written in some language he doesn't recognize…"
“Thank you,” Harry whispered in return, leaning in to kiss Daphne on the cheek. She giggled again, and he smiled down at her, then looked up to find burning grey eyes watching his every move. Harry couldn’t stop the flush from returning, so he pushed the thoughts out of his mind instead. He’d talk to Sirius over the summer; he had plenty of time to figure out his feelings.
"Thank you!" Hadrian threw his arms around Draco in a quick hug before rushing over to write the letter, barely registering Draco talking to a house elf. Once Hadrian was done, he gave the letter to Hedwig. "Here girl; take this to Neville for me and be safe." Hedwig gave him an affectionate nip before wheeling out the window.
"My Lord," Severus bowed-he wasn't required to kneel unless there was a meeting-, "What can I do for you?"
After pulling himself out of the stream a disgruntled Harry found himself a clearing where he could lay in the sun until his fur dried. He drifted in and out of sleep for a few hours, until his stomach reminded him that he still hadn't eaten. Stretching, Harry recalled the manor he saw last night, and the turkeys in the yard; he knew it would be dangerous to get that close to other humans-other wizards-but by now he was so hungry that getting caught was only a secondary concern, at most.
"You haven't seemed to mind it too much so far," Draco replied smugly, "In fact, I seem to remember waking up this morning with you-mmph!" Hadrian quickly clapped a hand over Draco's mouth to prevent him from saying anymore.
“Dobby,” he called softly, opening the wardrobe to find the House Elf sitting up, waiting for him, “I know you can’t use your magic, but can you feel magic around us?”
“In your dreams, Malfoy,” Harry spat, turning his back on the blond; he needed to get his reactions under control; this was his worst nightmare! Ever since Malfoy had agreed to a truce between the two of them, Harry had found himself thinking about the blond in a less-than-platonic way. He had always pushed the thoughts aside before, having other things to occupy himself with at school, but if he was going to be locked in a room with Malfoy…Harry didn’t know how he would be able to keep his feelings a secret.
"Very well; I shall leave them be-for now." About this time Draco finally broke the kiss and the party resumed-although he refused to let Hadrian retreat to his own chair. Once all the presents had been opened and the cake was served the guests broke into smaller groups and Draco, Hadrian, Theo and Blaise retired to the small parlor down the hall. Hadrian once again shared a couch with Draco, and Arden lay across their laps, his head resting on Draco's thigh.
"Hey!" Lucius protested, "I told you not to call me that anymore; if you're going to call me Luca then I'm calling you Sev!" The scene faded out again to the sight of Tom Riddle laughing at the two younger boys, and then it faded back in to show the boys (still the same age as the previous memory) sitting out by the lake joined by Lily and another girl with dark hair and the same green eyes; the new girl was wearing the blue and bronze of Ravenclaw.
Once he was free from his bindings, Harry lay down on his cot and began trying to come up with an escape plan. It would have to be before Vernon came home, he knew, and before Dudley came back to the house; he could fight off Petunia if he had to, but there was no way he would be able to fight either his uncle or cousin. If only Petunia would take her friends outside, or even to the kitchen, then Harry could sneak upstairs, grab the important stuff and climb out the window. As if reading his mind, Harry heard Petunia offer to show her friends the garden, which “I just finished getting in order yesterday”, followed by the sound of feminine voices retreating. Harry waited only a few seconds, then quickly opened the cupboard door and made his way upstairs.
"Now, don't be like that Hades," Draco chided, "We both know you like me, and I like you, so why not-"
“Bloody Potter,” he muttered, as he changed for bed, “Always has to muck things up.” Even as he grumbled, however, Draco realized what an opportunity this was; he had never quite forgotten his dreams of becoming friends with Harry Potter and now, thanks to his mother, he finally had a decent chance at making his childhood dreams come true. Already, this was shaping up to be a rather promising Christmas.
"Yeah right," Theo scoffed, "Why would the Hat put you in Slytherin? You're the ultimate Gryffindor-er…no offense Draco." Theo gave Arden a wary look when the dragon growled at him too.
“We’re going to watch Christmas cartoons at the cinema!” Teddy said, “It’s going to be so much fun! Aunt Fleur is bringing Victoire, too! You and Uncle Draco should come!”
“Of course not,” Lucius sneered, “You and I shall go on our own mission; I believe it is time to reclaim any Horcruxes that we can. The diary is gone, unfortunately, but the others should be easy to gather. Nagini is at Riddle Manor?” Tom nodded. “Bellatrix has the cup, the locket is in the cave-wait, no; the locket should be in…Sirius Black’s house. Severus shall have to get that one. The ring?”
"No," Draco shook his head, "from everything I've read I won't be able to use my Allure until after I get my inheritance; perhaps it was just being here, without others to cause problems between us." He wrapped one arm around Hadrian's waist and began stroking his hair with the other.
Then next thing Harry knew, he was being tucked into a warm bed. He murmured his confusion, and a gentle hand brushed the hair away from his face.
Harry thrusted up every time Draco came back down, and the blond moaned, leaning forward to brace himself against Harry’s chest. He moved his hips, trying different angles, until Harry’s cock brushed against his prostate. Draco’s cry of pleasure spurred Harry on, and the brunet did his best-with his limited range of movement-to hit Draco’s prostate on every thrust. The lover’s moved against each other frantically, seeking their completion. Draco tried to slow down and make it last, but they had both been turned on for far too long. Much sooner than he planned, Draco felt himself approaching orgasm, and he clenched his muscles tightly, squeezing Harry’s cock.
The stimulation went on for several minutes before stopping, and Harry stood panting, his cuffed hands gripping onto the chain for support. As his breathing evened out, Harry began to feel uncomfortable. The room was actually very cold, without heating charms from the house elves. His cock ached from being hard, but it wasn’t too bad yet. His wrists were a little sore, and his feet were starting to ache. Well, he could do something about that last part, but it would be a trade-off; Harry had felt that part of being bound was feeling some discomfort, so when he was looking for a way to alleviate the pain the heels would surely cause, he had come up with an idea to make that comfort a double-edged sword. His feet and ankles would get some rest, but he would then face a different type of discomfort.
“I did,” Narcissa smiled, “Come in and sit down.” She indicated for Harry to take the seat next to her on the couch, “Also, feel free to call me Narcissa, or Aunt Cissy, if you like. Tea?”
"Of course," Lucius gave him a warm smile, "I will let him know. I must be off now; Severus and I are going to work on the rune translations. Severus and I will return in time for dinner; I will have my family mirror on hand if you need to contact me Cissa."
“I’m going to watch that cock enter you until you’re stuffed full,” Draco told him, squeezing Potter’s ass cheeks, “I’m going to watch you writhe as it fills you up and the bullet presses against your prostate, bringing you oh-so-close to the edge without you being able to find release. Then, I’m going to cum all over your cock, and make you wank using my cum as lubricant, but you still won’t cum; not until you’re desperate and begging for relief. Would you like that, pet?” Potter let out a quiet whimper in response, followed by a sharp cry of pain as the dildo suddenly pushed in that last inch, fully impaling the bound boy.
"Night Hades," Draco replied, resting his chin on top of Hadrian's head. Draco listened as the other boy's breathing evened out and Hadrian fell asleep; Draco followed soon after and the room was silent.
"Calm down?" Harry exploded, jerking away from Draco; his emerald eyes were blazing with power-magic fueled by anger, hurt and betrayal, "How can I calm down? Are you fucking insane Malfoy? I just found out that my whole life was a fucking lie! Dumbledore stole me from my parents-who are alive! He forced my-he forced Tom to murder children, and murder the Potter's; he literally created Voldemort and put me in danger every day of my life! How can I calm down? Tell me Malfoy! Fucking tell me!" He was screaming by now, glowing tears streaming down his face, and the room was shaking with the force of his magic; Severus and the Dark Lord were being held back by the strong magical barrier that had surrounded the bed. Dark sparks shot out when they tried to break the barrier, knocking the older wizards against the wall, and Draco knew it was up to him to calm the other boy down, and he needed to do it fast-before Harry brought the manor Doreen around them.
"Already done," Severus smirked, "Number one is to restore Tom's sanity, two is to clear Sirius's name and bring him back or find another guardian for Hadrian, and Three is to restore the memories of Bellatrix and her husband; there are of course other things we need to accomplish, but those three should suffice for now."
“No, Potter,” Draco tugged harder on the pillow, “It is after nine, and there is no sense in lying in bed all day. I want breakfast, and you know I can’t eat unless you do as well.” They found that out yesterday, when Draco went into the sitting room before Harry woke up and found that there was a charm preventing him from getting the food; as soon as Harry entered the room, however, the charm broke.
"What are you going to do if the Dark Lord does decide that he needs to get rid of Potter?" Theo asked, "You know the prophesy as well as I do."
"Well, house elves have to be sworn to the head of the family," Draco replied, "because they own the house; the head of the family can then assign house elves to someone else in the family."
"Draco can help as well, now that you mention it," Severus mused, "He can at least help with Arithmancy. That reminds me-during this summer we will be seeing to your education to get you up to the level you should be at, and you will learn-at the very least-the basics of Arithmancy and Runes; if you were planning to take Care of Magical Creatures or Divination again you can forget it."
"Yeah," Hadrian nodded, as he turned to the next page, "but look; Serilia's mom helped them come up with a ritual to be used with the potion Mathias created so that they could restore their souls."
"Are you kidding?" Fred-Draco was almost positive that's who it was-raised his eyebrow, "Have you even noticed the crowd you've drawn?" For the first time Draco looked around and noticed that everyone in Diagon Alley had stopped to watch the fight, "Luckily for you Colin Creevey was here with his parents and he told us what was going on; George is keeping an eye on the store. You sure you're okay mate?" He looked at Hadrian, who nodded but didn't reply, "Okay, but owl me later; for now, I need to get Ronniekins up to the store so we can wait for Mum. Hermione and Ginny-you'd better come with us as well."
“Because,” Draco replied, “Even if we do not bond, it would still benefit you to know how to dance; whomever you eventually marry will certainly expect you to dance at least once, on your wedding day. Okay, that’s enough room; we’ll start without music. Come here.” Draco stood in the middle of the space they had cleared, and Harry joined him; Draco placed one of Harry’s arms around his neck and held the other hand within his own, while Draco’s free hand rested on Harry’s hip.
“Now, remember boys,” Narcissa fixed them with a stern glare, “Harry’s core has begun to adapt to the Faerie Realm, and will have some trouble stabilizing at Hogwarts. It is vital that Draco help your core rebalance; every night would be ideal, but two or three times a week should work. If you miss too many days, Harry will become ill and I shall have to come to the school. Now that Harry’s core is stronger, he should have enough time to get from the Great Hall to his dorm before the lethargy begins to affect him.”
"I will talk to Father about it later," Draco said, "For now you must return to Hogwarts so that Dumbledore doesn't suspect anything; I will call you in a day or so after I receive Father's answer."
"Thank you!" Hadrian called out as he followed George back into the alley, "You don't think fifteen was a lot to pay for some trinkets?" He asked his friend.
“You are my wife’s cousin,” Lucius replied, “No matter what they say of me, you should know that family always comes first. Here.” Lucius took his cloak off, and handed the cloak pin to the man. “This will take you to the cottage. You may make use of anything there, and feel free to send the House Elves out for anything you may need. I will resolve this as quickly as I can. Stay well until then, Cousin.”
“And that’s another thing you have to try and correct,” Lily shook her head, “So much of Dumbledore’s actions need to be undone…I don’t see how you’ll ever be able to right all of his wrongs.”
McGonagall spent an hour going over the rules with them, and Harry had been dismayed to find out that pretty much all of his free time over the next month would have to be spent with his roommates, to encourage them to get to know one another. Harry and Malfoy were assigned to work on all two-person projects together, while Justin and Michael would do the same; group projects would, of course, be completed by the four of them. They were to have at least one roommate with them anytime they left their quarter and on all Hogsmeade visits, and breakfast and supper would be taken in their common room. The common room entrance would be warded so that an alarm would sound if anyone tried to leave on their own without a pass from a professor. Harry felt rather like he was in prison, but wisely kept this comment to himself, simply nodding at his Head of House until she finally left.
“Just because you couldn’t escape doesn’t mean I can’t,” Harry retorted, then called; “Dobby!” After a few seconds, Dobby appeared wearing a tower of hats, one of Ron’s old Christmas sweaters with a pair of shorts that reached his ankles, and a pair of mix-matched socks.
“I hadn’t thought about what he would eat,” Draco confessed, bending down to pick up the dragonling, “Although I suppose he is still too young to hunt for his food. Do you know what is in his food mixture?”
"That's brilliant!" Hadrian beamed, spontaneously hugging the Slytherin, whose cheeks were tinged a slight pink, "Now we just need to figure out the best time-and a way to talk to each other when we're apart."
“I just beat him to the punch,” Harry interrupted, “He told me he couldn’t do it anymore; what else could that mean? Look, it’s not important; I’m not mad at Draco-” Except, he really was angry at the blond; he just didn’t see the point in showing his anger, since it wouldn’t change anything. “I still want to be friends, I just need some time. You’re right though, about the bet. I guess I’ll have to talk to him tomorrow, whether I’m ready or not. Will you-never mind; I’ll send him an owl to arrange the meeting time.”
“Yeah, I need to make sure everything’s ready for today,” Harry agreed, then mock-scowled, “I can’t believe you changed your opening date.”
“Got him!” Harry didn’t recognize the voice belonging to the boy sitting on his chest, but he didn’t really care who it was; he just needed to get away! With that in mind, Harry bucked and twisted; the weight on his chest lifted, allowing Harry to roll over onto his stomach, but two pairs of hands quickly grabbed his arms and pulled him to his feet. Before he could get his balance, Harry was pushed against a tree, and then he grunted as a fist connected with his stomach, even as the harsh tree bark exacerbated the injuries from Vernon’s beating the night before.
Draco set the letter aside and closed his eyes against the pain of losing one of his friends. Vincent may not have been the most intelligent of Draco’s friends, but they had known each other since they were children, and Vincent had always been loyal to him. The Dark Lord had to have known Vincent would never succeed at killing Dumbledore-he knew that Vincent would die completing his task. In fact, he probably counted on it-what better way to punish a parent than by killing their child, their sole heir? Draco shuddered as another thought came to him; Vincent’s fate could have been his. If Lucius hadn’t been able to place most of the blame on Bellatrix for that night in the Department of Mysteries, the Dark Lord might have assigned Draco that task, and Draco could be dead now. Not, he admitted, that he would be foolish enough to touch a cursed necklace with his bare hands, but going up against Dumbledore-whom the Dark Lord himself had never been able to defeat-was nothing short of a death sentence.
It was near midnight on Christmas Eve, and fifteen-year-old Harry Potter was walking through the Hogsmeade side of the Forbidden Forest, trying to talk himself into following the plan he had come up with earlier. Harry should have been at Grimmauld Place with his friends and Sirius, but Umbridge had arrived in Dumbledore’s office before Harry could step through the Floo. She had reluctantly accepted Dumbledore’s authority in allowing the Weasley children to leave early, but then smugly informed them that Harry was not related to the Weasley’s and could not leave without his guardians’ permission. Dumbledore had cheerfully agreed, promising Harry the use of his Floo once he received permission to leave, and then allowed Umbridge to escort Harry back to Gryffindor Tower.
"You may want to talk to Narcissa about removing any artwork that Arden could find offensive," Hadrian suggested, smiling at the bi-play between his boyfriend and the young dragon, "Otherwise he will probably just wait and destroy the art when no one is around to stop him."
“Potter?” Draco would deny it if asked, but he couldn’t help the concern in his voice when he watched Potter sway unsteadily. The brunet’s face was pale, and his hands were shaking severely before he grabbed the edge of the table. Potter was breathing slowly and evenly, but his eyes were closed tight against…what? Pain? Fear? Draco drew his wand, then nearly dropped it when Potter screamed.
“How stupid do you think I am?” Vernon demanded, “You can’t fool me, boy! I gave you the chance to cooperate, but now we’ll do it the hard way.” Harry scooted away from his uncle and got to his feet; he ran for the door, only to discover that it had locked behind him when he entered the room, and a key was needed to open it. Harry spun around, desperate to find another way out, only to have Vernon’s fist catch him in the stomach,
"So, you really have switched sides," Pansy said musingly, "Draco said as much, but I thought he was joking." She tilted her head thoughtfully before smiling and sliding closer to Hadrian. "Well Harry-can I call you Harry?" She didn't wait for a response but continued; "If you have gotten Draco's approval then that means you're practically one of us; I'm sure you don't want to spend all your time cooped up in the manor with him, he can be a very high maintenance friend. If you ever...desire company of a different sort, I would be more than happy to entertain you." She made as if to lay her hand on Hadrian's arm, so he stepped back, shaking his head.
Harry, who had been mostly fine if a little shocked after the events with the Basilisk, started sobbing when he heard Narcissa threaten death if Dumbledore ever placed “her boys” in danger like that again.
"He will pay for what he has done," Narcissa was startled to hear her own thoughts spoken out loud and raised startled eyes to the portrait beside her desk, which was no longer empty.
"You wish," Hadrian retorted, "Alright; I agree-the first person to catch the Snitch gets to claim a forfeit, and I hope you're ready to pay up Malfoy-I've never lost to you before and I don't intend to start now."
“That all depends on what happens during detention,” Harry told him, scowling and flexing his hand. When Malfoy grabbed his hand and looked at it, Harry was too startled to react at first, but then he yanked his hand away. “It isn’t there anymore.”
"That sounds interesting," Hadrian said, "Can I see one of the books?" Severus nodded and handed the Horcrux book over to Hadrian; he flipped it open to the table of contents and Draco stood up so he could read over his shoulder, resting his elbows on Hadrian's shoulders. The two boys read through the book together, flipping through the pages and barely even looking up when Lucius joined them.
“You looked as if you were about to play Gryffindor again,” Draco drawled, “We couldn’t just let you run off on your own. Now, where are we going and why? And don’t argue Potter; we can come with you, or we can body-bind you and return you to the castle.”
Hadrian nodded, and took a few steps closer so that he could get a better look. The dragon was about the size of a kitten, with pale blue opalescent scales, dark blue eyes, translucent wings the same color as the dragon's scales, and a blue gemstone on its forehead. The dragon's body was about ten inches in length, and the tail was half-again the length of its body, making it around fifteen inches long from nose to tail.
"I think…I think she could be brought around too," Harry said, opening his eyes and focusing his attention on Severus, "She is closer to the twins than anyone else, and I know they care about me; they tried to drop hints about Ron, but I didn't want to listen. Ginny is trying to be the daughter Molly wants her to be, but she's really not the sweet little girl she pretends to be at home. It would be easier to get to her at school though; I was going to ask for a re-sort, but maybe I should stay in Gryffindor for a while…"
"Nothing terrible, I promise," Draco said, "Just come here and close your eyes." Hadrian narrowed his eyes suspiciously for a moment before taking a deep breath and closing his eyes just as he felt Draco's free hand come to rest at the back of his neck, and Hadrian suddenly knew what was going to happen.
That, however, was a problem for another time; Harry’s biggest concern right now was making sure his new room was properly warded to make sure no one could walk in on him during any of his self-bondage sessions. Harry had a book on warding that Hermione had given him, and he used it to make sure that no one could enter his room between the hours of eight p.m. and ten a.m. unless he physically opened the door to let them in. A silencing ward was added to the door on top of that, and Harry felt that his room was secure. Now, did he want to try something tonight? He hadn’t had a chance to get a healing potion, so his muscles were still sore from the previous night. Well, maybe if he did something a little less intense it wouldn’t be so bad...and tomorrow was Sunday, so he wouldn’t have to worry about classes either.
"It is tradition," Lucius replied, "However I can see that you are in a mood, so I will give you ten minutes to collect yourself; after that you will return to the ballroom and remain for at least an hour. For every minute past ten I will add ten minutes to the time you must remain at the party, and I will insure that Hadrian sleeps in his own room tonight-is that clear?"
“Right, death to the creator of boot camp,” Harry laughed, hugging Ginny as they prepared to Apparate, “Thanks for all the help, Gin.”
"Wait, so you're saying Ginny isn't really our sister?" Fred demanded, "That's just-" He broke off, shaking his head in denial.
Hadrian sighed-it was just all so confusing! He had always assumed that he would fall in love with a girl-maybe even Ginny (Who wasn't an option anymore even if he was straight, since he found out they are closely related)-and get married, but he honestly hadn't had strong feelings towards any girls except for Cho, and he had been completely turned off by that kiss last year. When Draco had kissed him yesterday however, he had felt...flustered; it was such a brief kiss, but he felt more from that than he had felt with Cho, that's for sure. The lack of tears was definitely a positive improvement.
“I wonder how far you can travel using the mirror,” Hadrian mused, then shrugged, “Well, at least she got away from Brandon; I just hope that her-I mean our-grandfather will really help her.”
Harry felt magic swirling around them, and he leaned forward, resting his upper body on the ground. He felt exposed, and took several deep breaths to calm himself. He felt Draco’s warmth as the blond settled behind him, but he still startled when Draco skimmed his hands up his, Harry’s sides, before settling on his ass. Draco took a few minutes to massage the mounds of flesh until Harry relaxed slightly, and then he pried Harry’s cheeks apart to press his thumb against the furled hole. Harry closed his eyes, focusing on his breathing; he had done this himself when wanking, but only a finger or two, and he was nervous.
"It will be alright," Hadrian said, "At least now I know why I always had such a strong connection to Tom; I've had part of his soul in me since I was a baby. And, since Tom isn't crazy anymore, my scar hasn't been hurting me either. What time are we leaving tomorrow?" Hadrian turned his attention to Narcissa, "I'd like to visit the twins again if I can."
“Soon, lover,” Draco promised, giving Harry’s neck one last lick before pressing a gentle kiss to the corner of his mouth, “Just be patient-I promise it will be worth it.”
"I have two months' worth," Severus replied, "I would recommend leaving half of the bottles here so that you will always have access to the potion; I also made a copy of the instructions which I would like to leave in your potions lab Luca."
"Don't worry," Draco gave him a devilish grin, "I'm sure I'll come up with some way for you to make it up to me. So, are you scared now that we are evenly matched?"
“So demanding,” Draco huffed, linking arms with Hadrian and leading him out of the room, “What did I ever do to deserve such a mate?”
After a few minutes, Draco, spins Harry around so that he is facing the wall and moves the scarf so he can nibble at the skin around Harry’s collar. Draco’s hands slip into Harry’s pockets, which are really just slits in the robes that allow the blond access to Harry’s skin; Draco is able to slide one hand up Harry’s chest under the robe flicking the bells attached to Harry’s nipples, and the other one teases the head of his cock. The hand roaming Harry’s chest holds a wand, and Harry waits in anticipation as the hand trails back down, the wand leaving goosebumps in its wake, until the tip of the wand is pressed against the head of his cock.
“Spoil sport,” Draco pouted for a moment, then smiled again, “It’s okay Harry; I understand that you are repressed-I’ll tell you about my dreams some other time.”
“The bells are charmed to remember this style,” Pansy told him, “When you want to take the bells out, just tap one of them with your wand and say “Bed”. When you want to braid them back into your hair, tap one and say “Braid”. Simple enough, yes?”
"Have you had a chance to look through the books we picked up from Gringott's yesterday?" Hadrian asked Tom.
“This is where those horrid Muggles live,” Narcissa said, “Only…where is their house?” Narcissa frowned, she was hidden in the shadows of Number 6 Privet Drive; she looked at all the nearby houses, and realized that Number 4 was missing. Since Dobby had been able to find the house earlier in the day, the charm must have been applied after they left; Hadrian was quite obviously back with the Muggles, but how to get to him? Dumbledore would have made himself the Secret Keeper, and he was unlikely to share the Secret with anyone who might rescue Hadrian…
The new view was even more amazing than before; they had entered the true North Pole, and it was a vibrant hub of activity. Elves were bustling to-and-fro, carrying toys, papers and building materials. He saw several groups of elves playing in the snow-having snowball fights, building snowmen and ice skating. Brightly colored Christmas lights were everywhere, and there was a Christmas tree in every square. The elves below waved and called out greetings when they saw the sleigh, and Harry marveled at how happy everyone seemed.
Dobby apparated them into the kitchen of a Muggle house; Draco stood still for a moment, but he couldn’t sense anyone in the house.
“Very well,” Draco said, managing to keep his voice casual, “but if I allow that, then you also get a gag afterwards.” Harry quickly nodded, the idea very appealing to him; who knew dressing in girl’s clothes would bring out the pervert in him? “Well then, what are you waiting for?” Draco demanded, discreetly activating a charm before setting the camera down. “On your knees, Potter.” Harry crossed the few steps to where Draco was waiting, and the blond helped him kneel; he still had the heels on, thanks to a cushioning charm Draco had discovered. “And I think your hands belong behind your back, don’t you?”
Mind made up, Draco cast one last look at the injured boy lying on his bed and then ran from the room to access the Floo down the hall, praying that Severus would be able to help.
“Are you really surprised at this point?” Draco asked, “After everything else Dumbledore has done, lying about your conception is rather mild, don’t you think?”
"This is all your fault Malfoy!" Ron screamed, leaping to his feet; Draco noticed that redhead looked quite insane, his eyes were wild, his face was bloody, and he was shaking in anger, "You took Harry from me, and I'm going to kick your fucking ass!" He leapt forward and grabbed Draco's shirt, only to be hit by a red stunner.
“I admit, I thought Father at least would have some complaints,” Draco admitted, wrapping an arm around Harry’s waist and drawing him closer, “I don’t think I’ve ever seen him enjoy himself as much as he did tonight. Did you see his expression when he was reading Teddy’s story?”
Dumbledore had turned his attention to Sirius and Remus now, and was currently altering their memories, along with those of Severus; all three men were unconscious and thus unable to fight back. When he was finished, he placed a portkey on each man’s chest and watched as they disappeared. He surveyed his remaining prisoners-Tom, the Longbottom’s, Narcissa, the three Lestranges and Regulus-thoughtfully, before turning to McGonagall.
"Very well," Narcissa smiled, tilting her head to accept the brush of lips against her cheek, "I will walk you to the Floo. If you boys need me just ask one of the house elves; I should be around the manor all day. Try not to work too hard." The boys stood as Narcissa and Lucius left the dining room, and then Draco turned to the brunet.
“Quite so,” Arthur agreed, “The Weasley’s are forever indebted to you; if you have need of us, you need only ask. Molly has never cared much for portkeys; may we use the Floo?”
“Exactly as planned,” Moody replied, “James and Lily are settled in with Baby Harry, and I altered all of the photographs. I wasn’t able to change to godfather bond, so I had to alter James and Lily’s memories on that as well. The house is under Fidelius with Pettigrew as Secret Keeper, and I had them read the address Pettigrew wrote. Sirius Black arrived right on schedule, and I made sure his memories line up with those of the Potter’s. Everything is ready for your final plan.”
"That would be the best solution for now," Lucius agreed, "However, we must make sure he sees the pensieve memories as soon as he is brought back-or even before then if possible, otherwise he will waste time trying to fight us. Once the Dark-I mean, Tom, returns we can discuss how to go about retrieving Sirius. We need to make a list of our priorities."
"What do you mean by 'punish'?" Hadrian demanded, "Not like the way my-the Muggles punished me? Because I will not put up with that."
“I promised to keep him safe as long as his family did not betray us,” Dumbledore said mildly, “By kidnapping you, they have obviously betrayed us, and so they lost my protection. Harry, do you know what kinds of rituals can be done on the Solstice? I fear the you were taken from school to be a sacrifice for Voldemort.”
“Oh, it was cancelled for the weekend,” Ginny replied, “So I’ll be able to help some more. I thought you would have come in later; didn’t you have a date last night?”
“Very well, we are now allies. Is it true that you killed the basilisk a few years ago?” Harry nodded. “Then, for the debt, you will allow me to harness the corpse for ingredients, and you will promise to try harder in Potions."
At the time, all Harry was aware of was an explosion of lights and noise, which caused him and Draco to break apart, each going for their wand. Harry had found himself unable to move as spells shot through the air, and then someone grabbed his arm and he felt the familiar sensation of travelling by Portkey. Dumbledore had apologized for letting Harry get kidnapped from the school, and promised he would see to it that the ones responsible were punished accordingly. When asked how Dumbledore had found them, Harry found out that he had intercepted Harry’s letter to Professor McGonagall, and used it to track Harry. He then ushered Harry from his office to the infirmary, nattering on about inane things so that Harry couldn’t get a word in edgewise. As soon as they reached the infirmary, Dumbledore had directed Madame Pomfrey to check Harry for spells and potions, and cautioned her not to take anything the boy said too seriously, as he was undoubtedly in shock. Then, before Harry could protest, the headmaster left.
"You are very powerful Tom," Dumbledore was saying, "But I feel you are not using your power to its full potential; you are nearly an adult now and it is time for you to start thinking of your future. How would you like to work at Hogwarts after you graduate? I'm sure you have heard that Headmaster Dippet will be retiring at the end of the year, and I have been chosen to take his place."
“Okay,” he agreed, “I’ll check on her occasionally, and if things get worse we’ll tell someone who can help-if not Tom, then Severus or even the twins.”
“Agreed,” Draco said, “Now, is there anything else in the box?” Hadrian looked back in the box, but it was empty.
“You said that already,” Harry pointed out, “Now help me! I didn’t know-I mean, I thought-” Harry was embarrassed when he burst into tears, but at least it snapped Sirius out of his stupor.
"I believe Luna is a seer," Draco replied, "She has this uncanny ability to know things before others do, and as for her passing information to our enemies...I trust her."
Harry remained in the kitchen with the House Elves until he was sure Draco was gone, then made his way to the floor of the manor that held all the offices. Harry stopped outside of Pansy’s office, hand raised to knock, when the door swung open and a hand reached out to pull him inside the room.
“Color?” Draco asks, and Harry scowls, earning a smirk in return; he really wants to complain, and convince Draco to take him home, but he can’t like to him-he won’t lie to him.
“Not now,” Harry shook his head, “Let’s just…” He trailed off, forcing himself to focus on the scene in front of him; there would be plenty of time later to figure out what all this meant.
"Um, Sev? What are those potions?" Draco ventured uncertainly, and was startled by the anger he saw in his godfather's eyes.
“I suppose,” Harry grumbled, punching his pillow into shape before pulling the covers up, his eyes never leaving his lovers form as Draco got dressed, “Stop by the shop tomorrow, if you get a chance. Mrs. Weasley is making the pastries, and I’ll make sure to save you one.”
I have never been more relieved than I was when Arden showed me his memory of finding you. I am happy to know that you are safe and mostly uninjured, although it pains me that I am unable to rescue you. This is three times now that I have failed you-first when I allowed Weasley to harm you, then letting you get abducted and now being unable to bring you home. I would understand if you decided that I am unworthy of being your Mate; I know your father already feels that way, and I can’t exactly disagree. I can promise, however, that I will not stop searching for a way to rescue you, and I will make certain that those involved in your abduction suffer greatly for their actions.
“Ginny will be here with the kids,” Harry said, “So you can bring Scorpius over, if you want; then the kids can play together while we talk. Say, be here around eleven?”
"You are being difficult," Draco frowned, "You don't have to tell me every detail of everyday-unless you want to, of course. As for injuries, I don't need to know if you get a paper cut or something similar unless you have unusual side effects, but I would like you to tell me if you get knocked off your broom during Quidditch practice or cut yourself with your potions knife. I know that you wind up in a lot of dangerous situations, and you never rely on anyone other than Weasley and Granger for help; even then, you try to go off on your own. Luna told me you wanted to go to the ministry by yourself last year-I want to make sure you are safe."
"Wait; I have something for you too," he said, "Narcissa, do you know what happened to the package that was delivered earlier this morning?"
Christmas Eve finally came, and with it came Andromeda and Teddy, along with Draco’s parents. They had discussed inviting Hermione and the Weasley’s, but they decided that they didn’t want to risk a fight breaking out and ruining Christmas for Teddy. Instead, Harry and Draco were going over to the Burrow the day after Christmas. The small group spent the afternoon decorating gingerbread men and building a gingerbread village. Each person had their own gingerbread house assembled by Harry the night before, and they decorated it with the various sweets on the table. Draco was surprised, and pleased, that his father joined in- and even seemed to enjoy himself. Once the decorating was done, Andromeda took Teddy for a bath, as he had gotten more icing and candy in his hair than on the gingerbread house.
"I'm not friends with him," Hadrian said simply, his arms tightly wrapped around Draco's neck even as the Veela attempted to push him away, "I'm his mate…boyfriend, if you need a simpler way to understand it, and he already apologized to me for everything he's done in the past. He-" Hadrian's words were cut off by a gasp as Draco forcefully pressed their lips together for a moment, before nipping Hadrian's bottom lip and pulling away.
Pushing those thoughts away, Harry lost himself in the kiss; he was vaguely aware that they had an audience, but he couldn’t be bothered to care at the moment. Draco’s lips were warm, and his body was pressed firmly against Harry’s. Arms were wrapped around Harry’s waist-and then he felt the familiar constriction caused by apparation.
"Hmm, that's true," Draco said slowly, before smirking, his brief moment of self-pity over, "I knew he couldn't resist me, not really. So, you think you'll have that set fixed up within a week or two?"
“Last pose is your choice,” Draco informed the brunet, “On the bed, but do you want a blindfold or just to be bound to the bed?” Harry thought about it for a moment before making a decision.
Harry stared blankly at the page as an idea formed in his mind-all he had to do, was start a fight with Draco; the blond would, eventually, write to his mother, and the Malfoy’s and McGonagall would have to see that this plan of theirs would never work. Harry snuck a glance at the blond, who was thoroughly engrossed in his own book, and felt a pang of sadness. In order for this to work, Harry would have to make Draco hate him again; he would lose this friendship they just started, and he would never have a chance to make it into anything more. Well, so be it; Draco deserved more than to be forced into a bond with someone he didn’t love.
Twenty minutes later Hadrian settled into the window seat in Draco's room; he was wearing an old set of Draco's clothing-it looked brand new however-which consisted of a pair of black slacks, a light grey shirt and an emerald-green over-robe. Along with the clothing, Draco had also given him a wand holster that was strapped to his forearm; having never had one before Hadrian amused himself for several minutes flicking his wrist to release the wand from the holster, before looking out onto the gardens below.
"You both look very handsome," she smiled, "We'll have to get you some new clothes Draco; most of the ones you own will be too small for you now. Come sit down." She led the boys over to a love seat and Draco pulled Hadrian to sit down next to him; "The guests will be here soon, but first we have some gifts for you. This is from your father and me." She handed Draco a small envelope and a box elegantly wrapped with dark grey paper and an emerald bow on top.
"That's right," Remus spoke up, smiling softly at Severus, "Tom has made us see that it is unfair for magical children to be raised completely in the Muggle world; when they are finally brought into our world they are confused and at a disadvantage. We want to make it so that all magical children spend at least some time in the wizard world every year, starting at age five, and Muggleborn children without any wizards in their immediate family tree should start attending a summer camp at age seven or eight so that they can learn the basics and our traditions."
“Well, everyone is leaving after dinner tomorrow,” Harry said, “We can use magic to clean after everyone’s gone, and then we’ll have the house to ourselves for the rest of the night, and we don’t have to be at the Burrow until suppertime the following day.”
Harry began struggling in his bonds as he heard something heavy fall to the ground, then Dudley began dragging him over to the corned. A kick to the stomach had Harry feeling too weak to fight as Dudley untied his hands only to re-bind them in front of him, before leaving his room for a moment. Dudley quickly returned, along with Vernon, and Harry soon found himself being lifted off the ground; with Vernon holding Harry, Dudley was able to attach the rope around the brunet’s wrists to something and, as soon as he was secure, Vernon let go. Harry cried out behind his gag as his arms were stretched painfully above his head, his bindings preventing him from falling to the ground. Tilting his head back, Harry saw that he was hanging from the hook that normally held Dudley’s punching bag; his bonds were short enough that he couldn’t touch the floor, and his fruitless struggles simply caused his body to sway.
Severus had doubted his decision to switch sides numerous times over the years, but never more often than in the past twenty-four hours. Last night he had been called into Albus’ office on Order business-namely to discuss Potter and reassure everyone that the brat was safe with his relatives-when the headmaster had received an owl from none other than the wonder brat himself. Upon reading the letter-which Potter had, for some reason, written on Muggle stationary-Albus had immediately ended the meeting and left the office, asking Severus to lock up once everyone had gone.
First, he cleared off a table, throwing all of Arthur’s Muggle junk onto the floor. Then, he used a small hand axe to chop up some of the wooden furniture in the shed and piled it in the hole he had started digging near the back wall. He poured some gasoline on the wood, then used one of the matches to light a rolled-up magazine on fire. He used the magazine to ignite the wood, then stood back and watched until he was certain the fire wouldn’t go out. Finally, Hadrian gathered the aerosol cans and the batteries and placed them in a cloth bag, then threw them on the fire, before quickly ducking behind the table, which he had stood up on its side. He drew a thick quilt over his head just as he heard the first can explode.
"You can't just make everyone who disagrees with you a slave,” Hadrian frowned at Tom, then turned his attention to Draco, “And you stop giving him ideas; you just want an excuse to make me keep wearing the collar," Hadrian accused and Draco grinned.
"Good," Neville replied, "Gran let me set up a greenhouse at home; it doesn't have much in it yet, but I plan to have it full by the time we graduate. She's also started to let me manage my own finances and she seems to trust me more after what happened at the ministry." He cut an uncertain look at Draco, but the blond chose to ignore the reference to the night of his father’s arrest.
As he thought out the scenario, Harry gathered the items he would need and set them, along with the magazine that inspired his latest bondage session, on his desk. He cast the spells he needed, and then began setting up his scene.
“No idea,” Harry replied, “But it can’t be a good thing if she’s threatening me with it. Did you eat today?”
"Really? Hades? The god of the underworld?" Harry-or rather, Hadrian-pouted, "What did I ever do to you? Why not just call me 'Ri?"
It was two hours later when Narcissa and the boys returned, and the three men were shocked when they saw Hadrian.
Harry shook his head and leaned back against the tree. Whomever had lived at the manor must have cancelled the transformation somehow, and…maybe they had done something to Harry’s memory? He had obviously escaped somehow, so maybe he had been tortured or something, and the wizard-if it was a wizard who found him-had wiped his memory as he was escaping? Or, since he wasn’t in as much pain as before-just a headache and some sore muscles-maybe the wizard had helped him, but then erased his memory so Harry couldn’t reveal him? That was a possibility.
Nearly an hour later, Harry was staring at the House Elf in disbelief; he was Lord Voldemort’s son? He had living family, including a mother and a sister? Voldemort was his father? He wasn’t a Potter? Not to mention, Draco Malfoy was a Veela, and Harry was his mate! Harry didn’t even remember Draco, until Dobby mentioned him!
“Severus and his lists!” Lily said, “I remember those from school…James thought I was bad when it came down to finals-until he saw Sev’s study schedule. You have to send him in so we can catch up! Is he seeing anyone right now?”
“I’ll call a House Elf if I get lost,” Hadrian said, as they parted ways at the door to the sunroom, “I’ll see you in a bit.” Hadrian accepted a brief kiss, and then headed for the stairs, while Draco made his way to the library.
Harry stalked silently through the forest in the direction of the manor until he came to the edge of the tree line, where the beginning of the grounds was marked by an imposing iron gate that appeared to go all the way around the property. Harry wasted no time in scaling a tree near the gate and leaping through the branches until he found a spot where he could observe the grounds, while still being concealed from any witches or wizards who might appear.
Hadrian pulled the mirror out last, and watched as it expanded into a full-length mirror. With a sigh, Hadrian propped the mirror up inside the wardrobe and then closed the door; Hadrian didn’t know where his wand was, and he didn’t trust the one Dumbledore provided, so he had no way to activate the mirror. He would just have to wait a few days and see if Arden returned so that he could send Draco a letter.
“It has to do with the letter I forwarded to you,” Narcissa told her, “I can place the tea back under a stasis charm if you would rather view the memories I have for you first.”
The boys quickly dressed for dinner in a pair of casual robes and then headed downstairs, only to be notified by a house elf that they would be dining alone; Severus was with Dumbledore, Lucius was meeting with Tom again, and Narcissa was having dinner with some other Death Eater wives in order to keep up appearances. It was odd to Hadrian, sitting at the dining room table with just himself and Draco, but he just shrugged and sat next to his boyfriend. They ate supper at a leisurely rate, and then went back upstairs where they began looking through the books Tom had given Hadrian. Arden-who had been exploring the manor on his own that day-reappeared when they sat down in the sitting room and immediately climbed on the back of the couch to wrap himself around Draco’s shoulders.
