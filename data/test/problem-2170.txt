Potter groans at the sight.
Their actions were useful, yes, but as time passed, and Draco didn’t reveal anything about his own feelings, Harry’s heart slowly sank like the pebbles in the lake, heavy with rejection. The quiet lull in their dwindling conversations, originally full of expectation, morphed into awkward pauses. Harry stopped visiting Malfoy at the war memorial. A part of him would rather avoid him than pretend to be friends with no other intentions, but he can’t do that, seeing as they’re colleagues.
"Need you in me, Harry, please,
Harry signed it anyway. McGonagall imbued the painting with an Everlasting Charm and hung it at the Entrance Hall, so that it would be the first thing that one would see upon entering the castle.
"I assume you have no need for clothes that don't belong to you," Draco says. At Potter's nod, Draco opens his briefcase and withdraws a few large bags — embellished with Draco’s initials — with extension charms stitched into them. He tosses said clothes into two bags, spells them closed and vanishes them.
"Is there a particular reason that the Draco doll is practically naked?" Draco asks, arching an eyebrow at the doll's tiny Gryffindor-red briefs — the only thing it's wearing.
Harry continues to mumble unintelligibly to himself. He tries to close his eyes, blocking out the horrible scenes crawling around in his mind, but he can’t, because they’re burnt into his very eyes — that jet of green light had happened so fast; Harry didn’t even have time to finish his scream and then Cedric was dead, dead on the ground with his eyes open — Cedric, who was just brimming with life moments before…
He hopes they're not snogging, because he really doesn't want to hear any of that.
At Malfoy's slow shake of his head, Harry swallows, arousal crashing through him at the thought that he'll be Malfoy's first for this too. "Can I, tonight?"
Ron slides a sideways look at Harry. “Yeah, very important. Er, life-and-death issue, you know, his saving people thing,” he fibs. “Yeah. One-way. Ten minutes? Room thirty, Portkey 56317. Right, got it. Bill it to me, yeah? Thanks, Ed, owe you a pint!” Ron closes the connection and repeats the Portkey details to them.
. Their bodies are cloaked in a mist of lust; Potter thrusting hard and fast in Draco's mouth while Draco glides his hands over Potter's skin, squeezing every available area of flesh, finally resting on his arse. When Draco pushes a finger in—
Draco’s cock throbs. He aches to cover the distance between them, climb into Potter’s lap and grind into him while snogging the living daylights out of him. Worse still, he has a feeling that Potter absolutely wouldn’t mind.
He turns his attention back to Potter. Scooting closer, Draco lifts a hand to cradle Potter's jaw. Potter's beam widens, and he tilts his face towards Draco — like a sunflower turning towards the sunlight — to kiss Draco's palm.
...the Harry that Draco is so painfully, hopelessly, irrevocably in love with even after four years.
Well. This is a development — Harry's standing in the middle of the street with his arms full of drunk Malfoy.
"I'm not a challenge, Potter. You're always going on about the next thing you can chase, something new that’s caught your fancy, like how you threw pro Quidditch out of the window when you lost interest," Draco says, unleashing weeks’ worth of pent-up tension and over-thinking. "I'm not a... a Quidditch World Cup you can win, a notch on your fucking bedpost and my arse is not a prize to be obtained. You just want to finish what we started years ago, in the loo at the Leaky."
It’s the one of Draco performing in Mona’s, but Harry has chosen a different point of view compared to his sketch. Instead of watching from the audience, the viewer is behind Draco (Harry blushed when he was drawing Draco’s bum), who has his head tilted back towards the viewer, his side profile visible. A spotlight highlights the playful half-smile on his lips, half-lidded eyes and tousled blond hair.
Draco refuses to meet his eyes, and instead settles for looking at Harry’s
This is when it finally hits him, with an astonishing intensity and clarity that takes him by surprise, that he’s finally at the city that never sleeps, rich in both Muggle and wizarding history, where futures of people — be it actors, artists, singers, restauranteurs and everything else in between — are crafted, where people are reinvented and nothing stays the same.
With the sound of footsteps and muffled voices amplified in the still air of the office, Harry swiftly undoes his own spellwork and returns the safe to its original hiding place. He destroys the ball of light, crouches down right beside the door and huddles beneath the Invisibility Cloak, his wand at the ready.
Malfoy might or might not have changed, he might or might not be implicated heavily in the snake trafficking scheme, but Harry still needs proof because he's here on a case,
“From my training with the Magpies. A few of us wanted to do something different, so we went to Seamus and Dean’s Muggle sports complex — I don’t know if you’ve been there before — and tried out loads of things. I’m not an expert on everything, of course.”
"If that's what you want,
Annoyed with himself, he takes his seat at the faculty table and begins to tuck into his breakfast. He's lucky there's no Defence lesson for the first period of this particular weekday, granting him enough time for a leisurely meal.
Draco pauses in his whisking of egg whites and reaches out to touch a framed photograph of his family in happier times. "If only you could see me now," he murmurs. "I'm not doing something befitting of a Malfoy, but I hope you're proud of me nevertheless. I've got a job doing what I love, friends that care about me, and I'm home."
"Usually top, but fine with both," Harry pulls away to answer and dives back in again, this time nosing at the crook of Malfoy's shoulder, dropping kisses all the way from his earlobe to his collarbone.
George isn't sure what's happening, but there's a gasp from Malfoy.
"The dough," Harry replies. "I think you can take care of the rest."
He turns his chair back towards Harry, who is facing the stove and humming a tune. His eyes roam over Harry’s frame, especially at his shirt stretched over broad shoulders and the tendons shifting under Harry’s forearms as he raises the kettle to pour water into the mugs. Harry turns around, holding two mugs of steaming hot tea. He puts the mugs down. Sighing, he pulls off his foggy glasses and lifts up the hem of his shirt to wipe the condensation away.
“Every artist needs his muse,” Dean adds, grinning.
This time round, he doesn't bother with warming charms, hoping that the blizzard would be cold enough to numb his aching heart.
?" Harry asks, shock frittering his words. He closes the distance between them.
The shadows stretch across the ground, and a gentle breeze coasts over them, rustling their hair. The tempo of the crashing waves is constant and comforting, as reliable as the ticking of the clock, the passing of time. And Harry is lucky, so lucky to be with his special someone right here, at this peaceful place far, far away from everyone else.
"Yes. Chapter Five of my new book," Draco says proudly.
With a pat on his arm, Molly leaves.
"Day one. I wonder if you're missing me or if it's too soon for that. I hope your important meeting went well today, you've been so worried about it."
Draco whimpers and gets on his hands and knees in bed. He trails his right hand down his body, grasping the base of his cock while his other arm stays braced on the bed. He thumps his forehead down on his left arm as he starts to thrust into his hand.
When she's finished, Harry's glad that she seems pleased with his condition. She helps to prop him up to a sitting position with his back against the pillows. He takes stock of his surroundings; he’s in a room similar to those of St. Mungo's in terms of facilities, except it's much smaller and darker here. There are no chairs, as if the patients here do not expect to receive visitors.
He throws his hands up in the air, roars and storms out of Sugarcoated. He dimly notices Hermione passing a handful of coins to Ron, but he's already out the door. With his head full of steam, Harry barges into Sin and barks, "Where's Malfoy? Where the hell is he?"
Harry perks up at once, a delighted smile spreading slowly across his face. "He asked you about it?"
Harry's hand moves south.
Draco's face grows warm and he pulls the covers up to his waist, hiding his semi-erection.
“It was not a love note!”
"Life isn't complicated. It's you humans who make it complicated," Bacon says with such a Hermione-ish air that Harry can't help but laugh.
"Harry," Draco says, his name floating on a faint exhale. Harry looks up to Draco's red-rimmed eyes. "I don't deserve—"
"Of course not!" Draco replies, alarmed. "That doesn't sound healthy at all."
Overwhelmed with emotion, Harry hangs onto every word, chuckling when some of the lyrics reference their time in New York. When the song finishes, Draco launches into his usual introduction.
They walk in an uneasy silence for a while.
Potter brushes the stripper glitter off Draco's eyelids with his thumbs and trails his hands down the sides of his face in a heart-stoppingly intimate manner. And there it is again, that shining, green-eyed intensity that makes Draco's heart flip over like a pancake and does strange things to his insides.
"Would you be free later to join a few of us at the pub? Matt, Jacob and some of the other dancers will finish their shifts anytime now. It's a tradition to buy new strippers a drink," Malfoy asks, nodding at the bartender when he arrives with Malfoy's green cocktail and Harry's Firewhiskey.
“Oh, fuck.” Potter presses the heel of his palm against his cock. “That’s so wrong, but so hot.”
He sits up, grabs the Map and activates it. Pork Chop climbs up his body, peering over his shoulder. Her tail rises to smooth a wrinkle on the parchment. "Still stalking him, I see."
He looks around and spies Potter's Auror uniform draped over the back of a chair, reminding him of the time when Potter and his partner had come to Draco's house to question him about the case. Those scarlet robes had always taken the top spot in Draco's fantasies — years ago, when the
Malfoy lifts his chin and stares at George, incredulous. "I absolutely do not! He is entirely distracting, makes a complete fool of himself and messes everything up!"
“Don’t… become one of them. Please, Draco…” Harry begs. “Promise me that no matter what happens, you won’t take it and become one of them.”
Malfoy's cock twitches. He takes off Harry's glasses and places them on the nightstand. He loves doing that, loves the fact that he's one of the few people close enough to Harry to take them off. Harry tugs his T-shirt and boxers off, and Malfoy stares at his cock with bright and glossy eyes, desire scrawled all over his features.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Why d’you stop counting?” Potter mutters in an accusatory tone. He’s looking straight down at their feet, in fact, most of the time, Draco’s only seen the crown of Potter’s head because he keeps shooting anxious glances at their feet.
Harry gulps and presses the heel of his hand on his crotch.
while he does his homework in the Slytherin dorms; no longer in the Great Hall or in the library because those are places where he risks running into Potter. He tries to forget Potter and the love bites strewn all over his tanned skin, but he can’t, because whenever Draco looks into the mirror, he remembers Potter’s own love bites all over his pale skin like scattershot lipstick marks.
Without thinking, Harry huffs in irritation and casts a Patronus Charm, drawing gasps of admiration from the students when his large stag bursts into life, cantering around him and rearing back on its hind legs.
An awkward silence ensues. Harry wishes for the ground to swallow him up, while Malfoy is staring at him with wide eyes and an open mouth, although there's a rather fetching blush staining his cheeks. Ron is looking expectantly at Harry, an amused grin playing on his lips.
“Yet here we are,” Draco says. Rain is steadily soaking through his clothes, sticking them to his skin, just like how Potter’s stuck on him-
The wan smile fades from Draco's face after the last flare of the Floo, signalling the departure of his friends. He gathers the remains of their drinks — a mug of strong builder's tea for Greg, a glass of red wine for Blaise, and Pansy's cappuccino — and pads to the kitchen.
Draco goes to Potter's iPod and chooses a song. As the music starts, Draco sashays towards Potter. Potter moves as if to touch Draco, but he slaps his hands away.
Instead of looking surprised, like what Draco expected, Potter looks rather pleased with himself. "Didn't know you've been watching me like this.”
Swallowing, Draco gets on his knees and gathers the come on the slit of his cock.
Malfoy goes very still for a split-second before hurtling towards the Floo, his back to Harry. Harry cranes his neck, trying to see whose face is described in the embers, but Harry already has an inkling of who she is. A few hurried words are exchanged, words that Harry cannot hear because Malfoy is speaking too quickly and too softly. The Floo fades away, and when Malfoy turns back, he looks even paler than before.
"He's done nothing wrong! Yes, he's annoying and a pain in the arse, but he's
"Can we start? Or is this therapy all over again?" Potter says, an edge to his voice. His right leg jiggles with suppressed energy, and he’s practically twitching with the desire to get started.
Draco toes off his shoes, pulls off his socks and makes quick work of his trousers and pants while Harry twists open the jar of treacle sauce. Draco moves his hands towards Harry's own jeans, but Harry nudges his hands away. Thrill and excitement, mixed with just a bit of uncertainty, hums in Draco as he looks at the frosted glass wall. Pedestrians won't be able to see the... specifics, but they can definitely catch sight of their figures moving.
Potter shrugs again. “I just finished the second one today. I think I deserve a bit of a break before I start worrying about the third one, eh? I’ll just be bloody glad when this entire thing is over.”
They pass by the Great Hall, and Draco stops in front of the closed doors of the Hall. He looks around. The corridors are deserted, and they didn’t run into anyone; it’s way after curfew. Does he dare? He’s had so many fantasies about shagging in the Great Hall.
"Kinky bastard."
thing, but he tries his best, tilting his face and meeting Malfoy's eyes with an intense look, hoping that he doesn't look like a raccoon.
“Hurry back, you tease.”
Harry inwardly flinches, the sting of rejection and rain-drenched skin from two days ago still fresh in his mind. With leftover hurt and disappointment piercing through him, he nods at Malfoy harshly. “Yeah?”
"At least you would’ve tried." Pansy looks at him for a moment, and then sighs and rolls her eyes. "Men are strange. And they call us women complicated."
"Not now, but soon. I'll get my tart, Ron, just you wait and see," Harry mutters darkly. "I need a strategy." He grabs a clean napkin. He pats his pockets, and when Ron fishes inside his own pockets and pulls out a pen, Harry accepts it gratefully. He uncaps the pen, its point hovering above the napkin as he figures out what to write.
"You're forgetting that I just came after the best blowjob of my life." Hunger flickers in green eyes like lightning on a skyline. "And besides, I told you before, didn't I? That I would
He can’t be sure because someone disfigured the picture with a black marker.
"Goodnight, Harry," he whispers into Harry's chest.
"What?" he squawks.
shield Harry with an umbrella while he himself got drenched?
Harry traces the outline of Draco's face with an unsteady finger.
He wrenches himself back into the present, a present where Harry doesn't exist anymore.
The door swings open. It takes a few seconds for him to match the name to the face, and when he does, it feels as if his heart has stopped entirely.
Credits for Harry's "no one’s gonna ‘couple of blocks’ me anymore!" joke in the second scene goes to Leslie Jones's skit during Saturday Night Live's Weekend Update. Credits for the title goes to Jon Cozart’s “Tourist: A Love Song from Paris”. The heart-wrenching lyrics, along with the video of the song, were an important inspiration to the mood of the fic. "Can't Take My Eyes Off You" is credited to Frankie Valli.
Harry halts at once and lifts his hips straight up, forcing Draco to pull out.
Malfoy ducks his head, smoothing down the front of his robes with a shaky hand. "Yes." He hesitates, and then releases a long, low sigh of defeat. "You know what's the worst part?" he murmurs, eyes midnight with sadness and words trembling with hurt. "I was going to ask you to the Leaving Ball."
It’s finally Saturday.
They settle back into bed, but not before Harry fluffs Draco's pillow and tucks him into the covers. Draco waits until Harry's breathing is constant, and then turns back to face him.
Draco snags a cushion and puts it on his lap. He rests the box on the cushion. He runs his fingers along the four corners of the sleek, silver jewellery box. Each corner has a single rose inscribed on it. The Malfoy crest is embossed on the lid, along with the Malfoy motto —
"I..." Draco sighs. "It's been a long time since I've seen anyone else from my past." He nods at Harry's friends, offering a polite greeting.
!" Harry's voice spirals up to a shout and Draco gasps at the vehemence in his tone. He turns over in bed at once, landing on his hands and knees, sticking his arse up in the air and curving his spine just the way he knows Harry likes. He wraps his hand around his cock again and continues to pump.
Draco reaches for his whisky and brings it up. He swirls it in the glass, noting how Potter stares at his long fingers. Draco lifts the glass to his lips and takes a slow, leisurely sip, regarding Potter over the rim of the glass as he drinks.
"You can't stay. You know too much. Listen
Draco pauses in his work to give Harry his full attention as he talks at length about what he had learnt. He loves watching Harry when he's this excited — the bright, wide smile stretching his mouth, the animated hand gestures and the visible energy thrumming throughout his body.
Harry pats the ground and finds his glasses. He puts them on and rolls onto his belly, facing Malfoy. “You’re taking the piss. You know I can’t play.”
When it finally sinks in that he’s never going to see Draco again, he hangs up and rests his phone on his knee, not caring when it clatters to the ground. It’s chilly, much colder than last time, but he doesn’t care.
Harry hurries to stand beside Oliver.
Harry turns back, his eyes impossibly wide.
"He was a worshipper. You
"I don't know what relationship you have with Mr Malfoy, but I assure you, he is not going back to Azkaban, nor is the Ministry holding him-"
Malfoy doesn't withdraw his hand, and neither does Harry. Before Harry can stop himself, he's stroking Malfoy's warm hand, fingers skimming across his knuckles and over the raised veins. It's a pair of capable hands, blessed with long fingers and he can imagine Malfoy kneading dough, mixing ingredients and decorating pastries. Harry doesn't think he'll particularly mind if those same hands swirl chocolate all over his body, paired with that wicked tongue dipping to lick-
"I mean, if you'd like somewhere quiet. It's rather late, and I don't know many places that're open now. If you're not keen on that, we could go to a... park, or something."
There’s a lull in the conversation, and they both look ahead to the memorial.
“Oh! I almost forgot about them,” Harry exclaims. He beckons for the other owls to join them, and within seconds, five owls of varying species and sizes surround Draco. Humphrey huddles close to Draco’s right shoulder. He nips Draco affectionately on the finger, puffs his chest out and flaps a wing towards Draco (nearly whacking him across the face), as if to tell the other owls,
Draco briefly closes his eyes and exhales. "No, you didn't. Just give me some time to clean up." As he packs his ingredients and Vanishes the mess in his cauldron, he comes to an unsettling realisation: instead of being furious at Potter, he's actually pleased at seeing him after so long. He's vaguely annoyed at Potter for not knocking before entering, but Merlin, how could he be angry at someone wearing a tight white shirt that hugs all of his Quidditch-toned shoulders and muscles in just the right way? Or how his sparkling green eyes peer out from that messy tousle of black hair, tempting Draco to run his fingers through it?
It's too bright for it to be Underground.
Perhaps Malfoy wouldn't mind if they fucked right on this street.
The usual breakfast chatter resumes, and Draco hurriedly picks up his conversation with Aurora, although he can’t stop sneaking glances at the flowers. He waits until the last possible moment to leave for his first class, not wanting the students to see him holding the roses — he’s a professor, for Merlin’s sake, not some bird being courted. He could shrink the roses, but they really are quite lovely; it’d be a shame if they became squashed after unshrinking.
Draco lets out a long, heartfelt sigh.
"No!" Potter cries out, hurrying to him.
Was it all a dream?
He's about to cast a water-repelling charm when an umbrella flares open right on top of him. Harry squints up through glasses smeared with rain.
Potter shakes his head. "Nothing. Looking forward to this Saturday’s game? Think you’ll have lots to write about for the paper."
"You do, Draco. You always make it so good." Harry tucks two fingers under Malfoy's chin. "You know what I need now, yeah?" Anticipation and pleasure circulate in Harry’s bloodstream like a drug. "Give it to me. Give it to me good."
Harry recalls the stricken expression on Malfoy's face in the classroom. He swallows, keeping his tone light and his features neutral. "I dunno, Hermione. I might leave earlier than expected. I might not even stay for the Leaving Ball."
He's never seen Malfoy like this — wild, wanton and a walking wet dream; his trademark control thrown off like a cloak, all because he's thinking of Harry.
Harry didn't find it so bad hanging around a 1.3 metres-long venomous snake with a snarky, sarcastic attitude. Bacon made for amusing company — in fact, it kinda reminded Harry of someone from school...
Draco blinks rain out of his eyes.
Harry jangles the coins in his hand. "I'm paying for it, alright? When have I not paid for my food, you tosser? I want my tart!" he snarls, making a lunge across the counter for it. Malfoy barely has enough time to react, but he does so with the reflexes of a Seeker, snatching it out of Harry's grasp.
"Oh dear. We seem to have some leftover chocolate. Whatever shall we do with it?" Malfoy asks, a playful smile on his lips. In a smooth motion, Harry takes Malfoy's hand at once, coats his fingers in the chocolate, puts it in his mouth and sucks the chocolate off, just like how Malfoy sucked his own fingers off that day in Sin while Harry watched him through the glass.
He was tempted before to blurt out those words, and so close to telling Hermione and Ron about this ephemeral, unfurling romance with Draco, which feels like the world's best kept secret.
Draco raises a hand to shield his eyes from the sunlight sparkling off the Great Lake. He edges a glance towards Potter. Potter's sprawled out like a starfish on the grass, his eyes closed and a sleepy smile on his face. His robe, tie, shoes and socks lay abandoned at his side.
"You got rid of her," he points out, earning a chuckle from Potter.
," Potter exclaims in a ragged breath. Draco collapses beside him, the air heavy with their out-of-sync breathing.
Draco looks down at himself. He’s on his knees, his trousers and pants down to his thighs and his cock is out. He gives a furtive look around, relaxing when they’re alone, except for the chirping of birds.
Already flustered, Harry yelps particularly loudly when Charlie elbows him hard in the ribs.
Harry looks at Malfoy. Sure enough, there's a faint flush on his cheeks, his grey eyes are half-lidded, his plump lips parted as he stares at Harry's mouth. Harry drops his gaze — there's a slight bulge in his trousers.
Harry grabs his sketchbook, and puts pencil to paper. The cacophony of the bar fades away, and his world narrows to his art, Malfoy’s singing and the picture Malfoy paints on stage. It’s the best kind of focus; when Harry forgets about everything else and simply plunges himself into his work. The flow of his strokes are sure and smooth, and the sketch comes together wonderfully, with none of that second-guessing that has plagued him recently.
"Nooo," she whines, that single word emerging in a long, desperate hiss. "Don't take my pork chops away."
“Draco…” There's a hint of a frown between Hermione’s brows.
"We don't have to go back so soon," Harry says at once, sitting up. He hates how hopeful he sounds, but he can't help it. "We could stay until tomorrow morning, wake up together."
"Welcome to the Underground," Kingsley continues. "I'm sure you've heard the rumours."
He can't stop thinking about grey eyes, blond hair and long, elegant fingers, of heated touches, breathy sighs and swirls of pleasure melting into his skin like sugar.
With an unsteady voice, Draco says the spell to unlock the door. As he wanders through the shop with Hermione behind him, the onslaught of memories feels like a stake through his heart.
Ron looks at him and lets out a long-suffering sigh. "Even Mandy, the Welcome Witch at the Ministry reception knows about you mooning over Malfoy like a first-year, let alone us, your best friends. I’ve seen you stare at him so intently until your elbow ends up in your pasta."
Draco was surprised he didn't come roaring in on a bloody dragon.
Until today.
” Ron replied, grinning around a mouthful of warm pudding. He mistook Harry’s frown for disappointment at missing the game and added,
Something tightens in the pit of Harry's belly — the coiling of a nervous, exhilarating energy that is all too familiar — like the sensation right before he dives fast and hard into a Wronski Feint.
“My glasses aren’t for show, y’know,” Potter points out as he sits up, leaning on the leg of the nearest table and squints up at Draco.
Call her interfering, a busybody know-it-all — Hermione doesn't care. She will always act in Harry's best interests, no matter what it takes.
A thought strikes Harry.
?" He pales. "It was difficult enough telling your parents that we were going out! Wait, how about..." He brightens. "How about you propose to me instead?"
"I don't expect things to go back to normal right away, and I know I don’t deserve all of your forgiveness now. I'll give you all the time you need. Just don't shut me out again. Let's work this out, together?" he says.
when Malfoy shoots a stinging jinx and stunning curse in quick succession.
"A lot less bloody dramatic, I'd think!" Harry huffs, shrugging his coat on.
Draco can barely string two words together.
— until he came so hard he saw stars.
"Good morning," Harry says, pocketing his phone. He forces the words out despite the heartache gnawing away inside him. "And goodbye."
"Yeah," Potter says, mirroring Draco’s stance by hunching and leaning on the railing. "It belonged to Sirius Black, my godfather. And Hagrid rode this bike to send me to the Muggle world when I was a baby." He sighs. "After the war, I left our world and spent two years biking around Muggle UK. Travelling, experiencing new things to forget about the old." He slants a look at Draco and whispers, "I think you'd understand."
I’m very grateful to my beta, Mollie, for her invaluable advice and her contribution — the difficult conversation at Brooklyn Bridge — to the fic. I’m not American, but I spent two weeks in New York for a holiday in 2017, and that sparked my own inspiration for this story.
Potter's eyes sparkle at the challenge. He leans forward, his forearms on the table and hands clasped. "Go for it, then."
"He's been acting off the past couple of days," Draco says. "He's started complimenting me and yesterday, he told me he liked my shirt, makes my arms look
He presses his lips together, managing a vague “Maybe.”
Harry withdraws at once.
He heads towards the bedroom and inches the door open. The room is dark, and he can hear Draco’s deep, even breaths. Harry closes the door and retreats to the kitchen to brew himself a cup of tea. He's about to take the plain blue mug from the sink when he spots his old Gryffindor mug. He picks it up and frowns.
Draco flips to the front of the menu and automatically ignores the sandwiches and burgers — he's never really seen Potter pick either choice in the canteen.
Harry recalls the cobblestones and crooked buildings of Diagon Alley, along with its hodgepodge of magical, one-of-a-kind shops. It’s so different from Times Square, with its huge screens, and tall, sleek and rectangular buildings with perfect right angles.
Draco closes his eyes, unsure about where this is going. “What do you want, Harry?”
"Last night?" he continues, frowning at Harry in suspicion. "You came home late last night, and Malfoy’s saying that you ate this tart then. Something must've happened last night, that's why you got two tarts. You blush like that only at the mention of sex—" He breaks off, his gaze skittering all over the place as he tries to figure things out. He follows Harry's gaze towards the counter, then back to the tarts on his tray, which is at the same height as Harry's crotch, so there's no way he could've missed—
"Yes." Draco takes Harry's hand and kisses each knuckle. "When I saw you and the paintings, I knew I had to come back, no matter how long it would take."
"Hey, Ron and Hermione will be there, and Molly and Arthur are brilliant."
“Yeah, he is. But this year hasn’t been good for our friendship — what with the First Task and the Yule Ball and the thing with Hermione.” Potter sighs. “He’s mad at me again, wondering why he’s not the one that was at the bottom of the Lake today.”
Harry is tempted to swallow his offer; he doesn't want to offend Malfoy. They've struck up a tenuous friendship — comfortable, easy conversation during mealtimes, and even going out to the Three Broomsticks for a pint with Charlie once — and he doesn't want to upset this fragile connection between them.
Harry adds his cheers to the mix when the Sorting concludes, with Charlie's whoops being the loudest when Anthony Zabelle is sorted into Gryffindor. A surge of nostalgia overwhelms Harry when Anthony goes to an empty seat at the Gryffindor table — that was Harry, Hermione and Ron's usual spot. He misses his two best friends back in London so much; Ron is working with George at Wheezes, while Hermione is a Healer at Mungo's.
He crosses the room towards his bag and gathers his scattered things, keeping his back turned to Harry.
Their smiles fade as their gaze snags and holds, something promising and expectant pulsing in the air between them. Potter shifts forward, his eyes flickering towards Draco's lips. Draco's heartbeat ramps up, not believing they might—
As always, Harry falls back to the dominant emotion associated with Malfoy — anger; anger at being lied to by Malfoy and his friends, Malfoy not bothering to explain his absence, worrying over him, Malfoy not being upfront about his feelings right from the start because this changes the entire fabric of their relationship... and this roaring, dangerous, frightening jealousy, surfacing like some ugly serpentine monster rising from the depths of the sea — Malfoy kissing old flames in Paris, those long capable fingers smearing chocolate all over tangled limbs in bed...
"When are you going to tell him? All of this pining can’t be good for your heart, you know."
Harry would take offence at that, except for Malfoy's tone — not combative like the words themselves, but rather… wistful, as if he's lost in some memory.
Draco is looking at a huge painting of Hogwarts Castle by Dean Thomas hanging on the wall near the till when the bell at the door tinkles, admitting Ron Weasley. He exchanges cordial nods with Draco and Pansy, and greets Potter warmly with an affectionate clap on the back.
"This doesn't change anything. You're still Scarhead, and I hate you," Malfoy mumbles against his lips. He lifts his head, and Harry sees nothing but sharp grey eyes, kiss-bruised lips and flushed cheeks.
"You're gonna have this for the rest of your life," Harry rasps.
“Were you expecting something for Valentine’s Day, perhaps?” Charlie says mildly around a mouthful of butter dragon biscuit. At Draco’s grumpy look towards the crumbs scattered on his office table, Charlie quickly vanishes them.
There's a similar longing reflected in Harry's eyes, but how could that be? How could Harry ever want him like he wants Harry?
"Fuck me. Take turns next time, but you gotta fuck me tonight. Go slow, it's been a long time.” He grabs the lube, unscrews the lid and looks at Malfoy, who looks adorably dazed at this turn of events. Harry's completely naked, while Malfoy's still wearing his black shirt with all the buttons undone and sleeves rolled up to the elbows. His pants are twisted entirely around his right thigh, exposing his cock that’s so damn ready for Harry. Harry yanks the other man closer by the hem of his shirt and drags his tongue in a single stripe across Malfoy's lips.
“Don’t you fancy him back?” Charlie asks, jolting Draco from his musings.
"Although at times like these, I wonder why I do," Harry mumbles, kicking a parchment ball with his shoe.
Those words are like a bucket of ice water, dousing Draco’s fiery lust. He snarls and shoves Potter’s grabby hands away. Draco quickly rights himself, smoothing his hair and straightening his clothes. “Will you move on to your next challenge when you're finished with me then?” he snaps, frustrated.
Instead of sorrow and destruction, he dreamt of wonder and magic, of home and love.
Malfoy groans into Harry’s neck and pulls Harry’s arse down to rub their cocks together. Oh, the friction, that fucking sweet friction… Harry continues, stammering when Malfoy tangles his fingers in Harry’s hair and ruts faster.
Hermione laughs. "Rather a lot for someone who insisted that you were
"I know," Potter murmurs. "I love you, Draco. Only you. Don’t ever forget that."
Harry manages three short thrusts in quick succession before yanking his cock out of Draco's mouth. Draco raises himself on his knees at once, their gaze snagging in the air. Harry can't look away — how could he look away from the sight of Draco's flushed cheeks, lips pink and wet with saliva and pre-come? Fuck, he's so ready to take Harry's come on him. Harry's brain short-circuits and in just two strokes, he's
Relieved, he takes off his glasses and climbs into bed, gazing at Malfoy's empty bed beside his. Harry rolls over, training his eyes on the door. His body is still warm, and he runs his palms up his chest, relishing the feel of Malfoy's handprints scattered on his skin.
Ron shrugs and spears a sausage. "It didn't go so bad, did it? Malfoy didn't make fun of you, come to think of it."
— kissing as if they haven't been kissed in
"Aren't you tired?" Draco wonders. He's sprawled out in bed, and Potter's on his knees leaning over him, a smirk on his face while he lubes up his prick lazily.
"Harry," Draco murmurs again, his throat thickening with bittersweet emotion.
Potter laughs in a rather self-deprecating manner. He moves closer to Draco until they’re standing side-by-side. When he brushes his shoulder briefly against Draco’s, Draco shivers.
As Draco packs up his files and documents on Harry’s coffee table, he doesn't know why he’s so disappointed.
I told you about it!"
He sinks in especially deep and straightens up, bending Malfoy’s left leg over his own shoulder and resting his right leg on the bed. He continues to thrust, Malfoy’s face crumpling in bliss at the new position. "Harry, there, fuck," he gasps, his eyes rolling back into his head and his toes curling. "No, you missed it, ah, yes, there, right there—"
"Did you think I had any other reason for helping you?" Malfoy asks, looking curious.
"Well, you did call me delicious, if you’d care to remember," Draco says, not keeping the smugness out of his tone.
Harry takes one step away, then another. He runs down the aisle and flees, wanting nothing more than Hermione’s hugs and Ron’s words of understanding.
"What's going on here?"
"Harry," he tries again. The name weighs heavily on his tongue, but it falls easier from his lips this time.
at my job! I'm not going to throw it all away just for a fuck!"
Draco memorises the way Potter's kiss melts, just like the sweetest sugar, into his skin.
...who hugs the door and happily slumps down to the ground.
Draco wishes he was brave enough to wear his heart on his sleeve like Potter. He’s the sort to dip his toe into the water before jumping in.
Frustrated, Draco shakes a fist at the castle and
"Fancy a ride?"
Which means Potter will have to wait until next week to get Draco all to himself.
It's not the first time he's said that, and it won't be the last.
"Fucking
Draco’s gaze lands on Potter's chest, where the top few buttons of his shirt have come undone. There's another tattoo over his heart, and it appears to cover up a red, oval-shaped scar. There's a Snitch inked over the scar. "What is this?" Draco asks.
The world could fall apart any moment and they wouldn’t even notice.
Harry doesn't want to turn around, because what if it's really, truly, too good to be true, if it's not Draco, he wouldn’t know what to—
It's almost midnight in London on a Friday night, and Potter could be home, or out with his friends, or maybe even with another bloke—
"Well, are you finally gonna ask him out then? Time's a-wasting," George says, raising his eyebrows and tapping on his watch.
He eyes the painting for a moment. Sighing, he pushes the easel back, looking at it from another point of view.
Malfoy chuckles. "I knew you would ask me about that. Yes, all faculty have always had the ability to activate the suits of armour, but now, we may animate them wandlessly and non-verbally. Minerva tweaked that after the War. She might have forgotten to teach you. Perhaps you should ask her about it at dinner."
"Well, what's this then? One of your dirty little secrets that I've yet to know about?" Harry had drawled (three years with Draco had significantly improved Harry's drawling technique) and inched a hand closer to the box.
— soft, warm Draco that had melted under Harry’s touch like snow throughout the school year, his glorious kisses an addictive slide of sticky glitter and sugar vanilla on Harry’s lips. No, it was
Yes, it's a beautiful day...
"Mmm, wanna know," Draco mutters, sleep tugging insistently at the edge of his thoughts.
Nevertheless, Grimmauld Place used to be so cluttered, gloomy and foreboding, so it's refreshing to see what Potter's done with the place — bright paint on the walls and light-coloured furnishings.
Malfoy trails another gaze down the length of Harry’s body, his eyes reflecting the desire that Harry feels. Hope flares in Harry's heart, as bright and sudden as a shooting star. Maybe it’s fate that brought them together again. Maybe something can come out of this chance encounter. Harry opens his mouth to speak, but when a woman appears beside Malfoy and loops her arm around his arm in a heart-stoppingly intimate gesture, Harry’s words wilt on his lips.
Harry throws in the towel a week before Valentine’s Day.
"Luna's owl. She's away in Southeast Asia looking for creatures. Bambi likes to visit when she's not around," Harry explains. Draco’s close to making some remark about Luna's choice of owl names, but he's interrupted by a crash when a fluffy great grey owl careens into a large empty pot. Pig rears up, startled by the loud sound.
"We'll still have to question you," Harry says, trying to suppress a spike of anger.
"Sure. I don't have anything else to do anyway," Harry lies, feeling guilty when he thinks about the two unexplored rooms at the back. Well, but forging camaraderie with fellow strippers, especially the club's owner, was terribly important too, wasn't it, for the case?
“Where did you get all of these new ideas from?”
Harry closes the door and looks at the curious expressions on his friends' faces. Hoping that he's not jumping the gun, he takes a deep breath and says, "Looks like I'm coming home after Shanghai."
Harry’s jaw is set and his gaze is alert, his muscles tightening. "Ron, how long for a Portkey to Wiltshire?" he asks, hoping that Ron's colleagues at the Department of Magical Transportation would be able to help.
“Yeah. It’s good. Really, really good,” comes the reply, and he can almost hear the smile in Potter’s voice.
Potter puts on his clothes. "I have another one on my thigh. I don't mind showing it to you, but I… er… don’t want to strip in public." He eyes Draco up and mutters, "Wouldn't mind stripping for you in private though."
Harry releases a tired laugh. When Malfoy presses a kiss on the back of his hand, his heart somersaults at the affectionate gesture.
"Hi. Fancy seeing you here," Harry says, wincing inwardly at the croak of uncertainty in his voice, as if he's some tongue-tied first-year.
"Wow, you must be hungry. That's half of the chips gone," he says, with an easy smile. He ladles out a bowl of minestrone, sighing in happiness at the first sip. He peers up at Draco through his tousled fringe, and Draco suppresses an urge to comb it back with his fingers. "Sorry if I got a bit shirty with you. Wasn't in the best of moods," he admits.
"Why does it spark joy?" Draco asks. He's never seen Potter wear it before, and he wonders if it has some sort of sentimental value.
Secretly pleased, Draco nibbles on the treat, marvelling at the delicate shell and the thick chocolate filling. "Really?"
It's Stripper Dan that's up here, not Auror and Saviour Harry. Cloaked in this web of anonymity, Harry feels the tight knot of anxiety and fear in his stomach loosening. He's Dan-
The ache of homesickness tears Harry's heart apart like a new emotion.
The group erupts into a chorus of cheers and groans at the absolute cheesiness of Potter's line.
Potter is falling apart on top of him, and Draco loves it.
with Sirius Black's name on the cover. The book has seen better days; it's yellowed with age, complete with dog ears and sticky tags peeking out from some pages.
Potter yells, throws his head back and fucks Draco's throat with all the desperation of a man denied every semblance of pleasure for years.
There's a dull thud as Potter winds his arms around the barricade, his biceps flexing 'cause he's clenching his fists on the metal. His head is thrown over the railing, throat exposed and gulping, and the sounds he's making... fuck, that's
Harry hasn’t done this in Parseltongue before, and he’s never used the language with anyone else besides Pork Chop. He’s never rattled off Parseltongue by himself — it’s always a conversation. He opens his mouth, and then closes it.
Draco doesn't need to reply; he's sure the skitter of his eyes to the side has answered the question well enough.
noticed."
“What the-“ Draco rears back, alarmed.
-, a hard bite on his knuckle and he's shooting his load all over Malfoy's living room floor.
Draco shakes his head and rearranges the living room to its previous configuration.
“At long last love has arrived, and I thank God I’m alive,” Malfoy sings, grey eyes sweeping across the room…
Draco was prepared for that. "I am aware of this, so if this project is to take flight, I would welcome suggestions regarding promising Auror recruits from the Heads of the other Houses. Such students would naturally be in my N.E.W.T. classes, and I will gauge their potential and capabilities with equal favour."
pile.
It’s just the two of them now.
Harry asks Pork Chop, who is heating up the kettle.
"Thank you for showing me this. I..." Everything that Harry wants to say
Harry's grin widens.
Potter's eyes flicker to the side when Draco looks up. Potter's been sneaking furtive glances at Draco throughout the entire dinner, his gaze equal parts heated and playful. He returns his gaze to Draco's exposed collarbone, his lips turning up in a smirk.
The crowd is quieter, waiting and watching to see how Harry would deal with having a snake twisting itself all over his body. Would this challenge mess up an otherwise-perfect audition?
Plus, Harry’s got his best mate with him.
"Oh Merlin, I've turned the Golden Boy into a canary." Panicked, Draco begins to pace the lab as he frantically recalls the spells cast on the original Cream.
This time, however, Malfoy squeezes his hand, linking their fingers together, and even though he's still on his side of the bed, it's amazing, how just by this sweet and simple gesture, Harry's heart soars like a bird taking flight. He aches to fold Malfoy up in his arms, kiss his worries away, sweeping them away in the waves of Harry's affection and tenderness, but it's too soon. He's always the one to fall harder and faster in his relationships, and it's no different now. The last thing he wants is to spook Malfoy; he never ever wants a repeat of seven years ago, when his owls to Malfoy returned unopened.
"Dinner, the main meal of the evening? Usually happens after tea?" Malfoy supplies, his smirk widening.
"We're back to that again, huh?" Harry says, dredging up a watery smile. He locks the map up and takes out the bag of Polyjuice pills, with Bacon practically bouncing up and down with excitement by his side. Harry strips down to his underwear, fishes out a half-an-hour pill and swallows it, chasing it down with water. It's not long before the transformation is complete.
He should have known that nothing was easy when it came to Draco Malfoy.
"Wha-" Harry dropped the box and stared, stunned, at the item in his hand. It was medium-sized, running the length from Harry's wrist to elbow. It had Harry's jet-black hair, although it was much neater than the real Harry's usual riotous hair; it wasn't bespectacled, and the green of its wide eyes was a lighter shade than Harry's forest-green eyes. But there was one thing about the doll that was accurate — the lightning bolt-shaped scar on its forehead. It was rather ratty and old — small patches of cotton stuffing were leaking out from its seams and its red robes had faded to pink from sun exposure.
Draco’s own simmering anger comes to a boil at Potter’s flippant manner, a squirm of disappointment twisting his heart. He snaps, pointing at his own chest, "Me? It’s not my bloody fault! You’re the one giving mixed messages, sending presents and courting people when the only thing you’re interested in is a shag!"
Harry sighs. "I mean it. You know I've been talking to Kingsley, and we drafted a rough contract two days ago by owl. I'll be officially employed by the Ministry after N.E.W.T.s and I’ll have my overseas postings then. I could take you along. Go wherever you want to go. Any country. Just the two of us." His words emerge in a hurried rush, and he hates how apparent it is that he's thought about this so much. "We could leave Britain and carve out a new life. Away from everything and everyone,” he says, sweeping an arm out.
"Alright.” Draco heads back to Potter's bedroom. He picks up his clothes from yesterday, casts a cleaning and de-wrinkling charm on them and puts them on. He waits for Potter in the living room and scans Grimmauld Place, which looks so much brighter and cosier compared to the first tidying session roughly three months ago.
It's just past midnight at Serpentes and the club is heaving. Gone are the posh chairs and tables with fancy menus, all cleared at the stroke of midnight to make room for a huge dance floor. This is what Harry's used to — strobe lights, disco balls, throngs of men rubbing up against each other feverishly to the pounding music. Strippers and snakes gyrate not only on the stage, but also on smaller makeshift stages and in cages hanging from the ceiling, the suspensions strengthened by charms.
As much as he
"Yep, an Ashwinder." Harry smiles at the thought of Pork Chop.
"They watch me strip, yes, but only you can touch me," Draco whispers. "Only you, Harry, because I don't want anyone else. You hear me? No one else.
"Mmhmm, yeah, so good—"
So, Malfoy is straight? He certainly wasn't three years ago, when he was begging for Harry to go deeper and faster. Harry snarls, teeth sinking into his lower lip at the recollection of Malfoy beneath him. If that's the case, then Harry was nothing more than a convenient plaything in Malfoy’s rebellious phase. Or is he gay, but denying himself to obey his parents and play happy families?
so hard until Draco's body jerks forward with every thrust.
A dark look passes over Potter's features, and he lets out a thin, reedy laugh. Tension stiffening his shoulders, he jerks his head to the side, shielding his eyes from Draco. "Happy, huh?" Potter remarks, his question rhetorical and his words low.
Draco mixes it up by licking his tongue in circles or in straight strokes around Potter's rim, while he smacks and squeezes his delectable arse every few minutes or so.
Malfoy glances at Marjorie. He squares his shoulders, his voice sharp. “What are you doing here?”
“Perfection,” Draco murmurs. “All of it in me, from here,” he kisses the crown of Potter’s cock, and then the base, “to here.” He peers up at Potter — at the bright green eyes burning with a fiery, single-minded focus. Potter shoves him back on the bed, and grabs the lube. Draco fumbles for a pillow and tucks it under his hips, his arse clenching at the sight of Potter lubing up his thick cock. His breathing quick and shallow, Potter climbs on top of him, and Draco’s legs fall apart in invitation, his arms winding around Potter’s neck. He bucks his hips up, making a noise of impatience as Potter lines himself up.
Draco probably looks equally wrecked.
"Dragon, Charlie's dragon," Horace shouts, already running towards Gryffindor Tower. "Go, Draco, they need you!"
Draco knows that a romance with Potter would never happen, even though they're rather good friends now, two years after the War. Previously, his animosity towards Potter vanished when he returned Draco's wand, and during Potter’s testimony at the Wizengamot, sparing Draco from Azkaban. And then Millicent got together with Neville Longbottom, out of all people, and Draco was dragged to pub nights at the Leaky. Initially, he and Potter tolerated each other’s presence for the sake of Millicent and Longbottom, although he caught Potter hiding a snicker behind his palm whenever Draco drawled out an amusing remark or sardonic joke.
After a few more minutes of conversation, Draco calls for the bill (shooting the waitress a dark look after he caught her winking at Potter) and pays for dinner, waving away Potter's protests.
“Turns you on, doesn’t it? Doing it here?” Draco whispers when Potter hoists himself up to sit on the table. “In twelve hours, this place will be full with your colleagues and friends for lunch, but now it’s just two of us here, on a Sunday night, where I’m gonna blow you—“
Draco doesn't know whether to laugh or cry.
“Harry!” Draco shouts, throwing his head back. “Right there, Harry, right fucking
"Harry
“You know what, Hermione? We can either go out and have fun, or we could stay in and sulk. It’s my birthday, and I’ve got the company of an absolutely stunning lady. Let’s go out, have a fantastic dinner with the best champagne, and then we’ll go dancing. Or anything that you’d want to do. Together, just the both of us. How does that sound?”
It's getting colder, but he doesn't cast a Warming Charm. Perhaps it'll numb the pain in the pieces of his heart.
"Listen to yourself," Malfoy says, leaning forward. "You know the major events of my life, and after that it was just sex—" He raises a hand, silencing Harry, who was close to rebutting. "Sex, and our messy history. That's all we've shared. Is it enough to sustain a relationship? Enough to know that we can be together long-term?"
Potter is just about to straddle him when Draco stops him.
, sending her wand sailing through the air, and into the hand of her partner.
"Go somewhere with an alibi after your set tonight," Harry says lightly, not looking at Malfoy.
Harry munches on a biscuit, watching Draco as he wanders around the living room. "It's wonderful," he murmurs. Draco grazes his fingertips along the clean curtains, looking out of the window and up at the moon, hanging full and round in the night sky. He turns his head, catching Harry's eyes with his own. "As if you've taken something damaged and irredeemable, and given it a new lease of life."
"Your home is fine," Draco says. "Lead the way."
Another hard thrust, his cock grinding against Malfoy's prostate, and Malfoy falls apart underneath him. He comes, shooting all over his own stomach, the force of his orgasm so strong that some of it spurts up to his collarbones. Harry fucks him through it, going even faster, desperately chasing his own climax.
"It's alright, old girl, let's just calm down, it's me, Charlie," he coaxes, his voice melodic and gentle.
In response, she slithers towards Charlie and rests her head on his wrist in a show of comfort. Having been under his care at the sanctuary, she knows how much he feels for the dragons and other smaller reptiles there. He gives her a small smile as he begins to pet her.
His open book beside him, Draco leans back on the trunk, folds his hands in his lap and closes his eyes, feeling entirely at peace with the world. He nudges away thoughts of mounting piles of scrolls waiting to be graded, lesson plans waiting to be implemented, along with his other staff duties. Honestly, if another third-year writes that vampires are found only in Transylvania, he will be
"It's a good day for the park, isn't it, Harry?" Hermione says loudly, angling her head towards Teddy, who brightens at the word
They're at the westernmost point of mainland Europe. It's evening, late enough for the hordes of tourists to have left, but not too late for Harry and Draco to enjoy the scenery. The frothy waves of the North Atlantic Ocean churn and surge against the cliffs, and Harry sighs at the breath-taking view of ocean and sky.
Hogwarts suddenly feels stifling, as suffocating as the outside world, with their flashing cameras and intrusive questions.
Draco expects to feel indignant — he's been grinding away on the dance floor the whole night — but he doesn't feel anything like that at all. Instead, he sits up in curiosity and watches as Potter clicks through songs on his iPod. He chooses one and moves back to Draco, who brazenly pushes himself up against Potter even before the music has started.
Draco shivers at the warm, welcoming touch and snuggles into Harry.
“I brought you something,” Harry says.
Lisbon is beautiful, but he can’t return, because Lisbon will always remind him of this heart-wrenching moment of overwhelming disappointment and crushing sorrow.
“Yeah, you should.”
Draco replaces the teapot on the tray and transfers his flinty stare to the Aurors seated opposite him.
"We've been together for a year and a half, and she's good for me. Good for my family," Malfoy says, and they fall into a strained silence. Harry knows very well about pureblood arrangements from Ron. It's tradition for most pureblood marriages to be a political and economic affair, with some of them being entirely devoid of love.
exactly like how a stripper should, but deep down, he's
Malfoy looks like he hasn't slept a wink.
Fuck it, Harry's never been able to play anything cool.
A wave of pure desire floods Harry’s system.
Draco agrees, and they Apparate to Harry's place. They head straight to the rooftop, towards Draco's favourite spot — the reading nook.
Hermione clears her throat and puts her half-eaten brownie down. "It's been a month since they've opened, and you've never really visited them."
“How are you?” Potter asks, stepping in fully and closing the curtains around them. “I came right over when I knew you were here.” His gaze flickers between Draco’s bed and the adjacent chair. Eventually, he wipes his palms on his pyjama bottoms — Draco’s eyebrows raise at Potter’s bright-red Golden Snitch pyjamas — and sits on the chair.
According to Ron, since Malfoy hadn't been that horrified by Harry's "potato disaster" (as coined by Ron amidst hilarious laughter as he recounted that incident to Hermione), a more composed Harry decides to be more aggressive in his advances.
Harry's heart sinks when he registers the explosive safe.
Draco nods and moves to the side, granting Harry entry. When Draco turns back after locking the door, Harry is standing in the middle of the living room, his eyes roaming around the place. His gaze falls on Draco, and he wipes his hands on his jeans.
"Yes, we will."
Potter’s chortle brings Draco back to the present.
"Did you just call me a…
“Did you know?!” Harry shouts, his words lashing out as sudden and as sharp as a bolt out of the blue. Draco flinches as if Harry had physically struck him. “Did you know that this was gonna happen?! No one believes that Voldemort is back. But you do, don’t you?” He takes a menacing step forward, the wooden boards of the bridge creaking ominously under his feet.
The envelope has not been open.
Draco catches Potter's eye and they share a small, hesitant smile. An atmosphere of anticipation and blossoming potential crackles in the air. Potter jams his hands into his jeans pockets and scuffs the toe of his trainer against the ground. "Any place you have in mind?" When Draco shakes his head, Potter suggests, "Pub food alright? I know a good place. It's near my flat, so Ron, Hermione and I have been there loads of times. Muggle, so no one's gonna bother us."
It's different now — although the school year has officially ended, Draco doesn’t experience the usual sense of closure.
. Feeling absurdly accomplished, he pats the napkin and leans back, linking his fingers behind his head.
"Hmm? No answer?" Draco taunts, picking up the rhythm.
"Page fifteen," Malfoy mutters. Harry glances at the corresponding page on the table—Cleaning Charms. "Excuse me," Malfoy says, kissing him on the temple and disappearing into another room that Harry assumes is the loo.
fluttering on the ground. “And where are Weasley and Granger? Thought you’d…” He stops in his tracks. His face pales, his eyes glaze over, as if he’s imagining something. Malfoy’s right hand rises, as if out of its own accord, to grip the spot on his left forearm where his Dark Mark would be.
All this time, Hermione had been quietly observing and putting two and two together.
However, this year’s class appears to be quite… different.
Harry can see that Malfoy's picking his next words carefully.
“Me too. How you touched me like this.” Malfoy reaches behind and guides Harry’s palms to his arse. Harry groans into his neck as he kneads that gorgeous arse, still as firm and lush as before. “How I touched you like this.” Malfoy frees the bottom of Harry’s shirt from his trousers and trails a heated hand up Harry’s abdomen, fingers grazing the trail of dark hair leading southwards. “Salazar, you’re even fitter now.”
Harry ran into Malfoy on the way to Charlie's. Malfoy was carrying his bags.
But he doesn't think he can do it anymore.
"Let's do it. May the better man win," Harry says, sharing a grin with his best mate as they shake on it. He smooths out the napkin and begins to write.
closer. In response, a thrum of pleasure shivers down Harry's spine. "Welcome to Serpentes," Malfoy murmurs, his voice as light as silk, fingertips grazing the delta of veins under Harry's wrist.
Draco laughs, a cold hard laugh that curls viciously at the corners. "Of course I understand. I've understood this ever since you’ve started working at the Ministry. But faking your own death and hurting everyone that loves you... Hermione, Molly, Arthur, the rest of the Weasleys, me…" He moves back, shaking his head. His words, along with his shunted eyes and the closed expression on his face, cut Harry right down to the bone. "What's the point of saving the world yet again if you hurt the ones that love you the most?"
"D'you top... bottom?" Malfoy can’t even get the words out between kisses.
"If he dies because of old age, I would've accepted it!" Charlie rages. "But they poached him right from under our noses, hurt him and drugged him just to make potions ingredients off of him illegally. We got him back, healed him, but he's still going to—" He breaks off, looking away. "I don't want another earring, Harry," he whispers, broken.
Harry's such a wild little fuck in bed: he releases his fingers from the space between the mattress and the headboard to punch the headboard, and then he's twisting the silk sheets at the tucked corner of the bed with white knuckles and fucking
“No!”
And he’s not going to accept anything less than mind-blowing sex with Potter.
The witch sits up in the reclining chair and studies the half-finished tattoo. She smiles, but she edges a sidelong glance at the tattoo machine. She murmurs something to Potter, who peels off a glove and fiddles with the nearby gramophone. Classical music starts to play, a trick to put nervous clients at ease. He flicks through different songs before choosing one that she likes. Potter nudges his glasses up the bridge of his nose and continues working.
Oliver starts to peel off his Quidditch leathers. "The holidays are almost over. I've got to work them hard before we send them back to the feasts at Hogwarts." He sits across the table from Harry. "They might moan about it, but you've got some good talent. I've got my eye on Reynolds and Baker; reckon I'll offer them a try-out with Puddlemere after they're finished with Hogwarts."
—from the stack and flips through it absently. Draco catches a glimpse of words—
, a sceptical voice rings out in Draco's head.
As Harry pours a glass of water for Malfoy, he wonders why he feels relieved at this revelation.
"You still rub the back of your neck when you're embarrassed. I noticed it dozens of times in Hogwarts — for example, when you were reading gossip about yourself in the
"Despite being a stickler for tradition, it might be prudent to move on with the times," Draco declares, earning a laugh and a wink from Potter.
"Anything?" Malfoy asks, his eyes wide with feigned innocence.
," Malfoy murmurs, his pupils dilated.
Draco spins on his heel and reaches for the doorknob. He stumbles out of Grimmauld Place, into the icy weather with the creeping cold haunting his every step. He closes the door behind him and trudges onwards, his boots sinking into the snow. He winds his scarf around the lower half of his face and bows his head, fists jammed into his pockets.
Swirls of black seep from the edges of the potion, and Draco groans in distress. Now, that is definitely not salvageable. His experiment with Canary Creams will just have to wait.
This thing with Potter had started out as an experiment borne out of convenience — just a bit of fun to take the grind out of the daily humdrum of homework and lessons. Draco had an inkling over summer break that he might be more partial to boys than girls, and then Potter had appeared earlier this school year, all gnashing teeth, bunched-up fists and fiery green eyes. Draco couldn’t help himself; he’d been curious and he’d never kissed anyone before and Potter was a boy and he was
"Right. Goodnight," he says. He lets himself out, leaving Potter snoring with his pet snake curled protectively beside him.
Harry cries, and Malfoy's wand flies out of his hand. But Malfoy merely flicks his fingers lazily, murmuring the counter spell, and his wand hangs, suspended, in mid-air, before hurtling back into his palm in an impressive display of wandless magic and reflexes.
Malfoy brings the second dessert to the forefront. The chocolate praline is shaped in a rectangle, all harsh and sharp right angles, with a single dot of white chocolate in the middle. Harry takes a bite and winces at once at the most bitter dark chocolate he's tasted, the flavour so strong that it feels like it's punched him in the throat. Yet, as Harry swallows the praline, he detects a delicate, gentle sweetness lingering as an aftertaste, chasing the bitterness away.
Draco backs off, his toes curling with discomfort. Usually he'd follow up with
"Alright?" Malfoy asks, his other hand smoothing Harry's hair back in a heart-warmingly tender gesture.
"Good afternoon, Weasley! We're working on getting Draco's prick up Potter's arse! Would you like to join us?" Parkinson shouts by way of greeting, much to Hermione's horror. Ron simply flares bright red all the way to the tips of his ears, opens and closes his mouth wordlessly and flees to the kitchen without a backward glance.
"—tea!” Malfoy finishes with a commiserating groan.
"Don't make me wait until my birthday to see you again," Potter says. "Come and visit me in London in early July." He grins. "I'll make you buttermilk pancakes every morning."
"They're all
Draco lifts his head up. "Thank you," he whispers, his eyes shining.
It's strange how the thought of Malfoy scrubs away some of Harry's weariness.
They scoot backwards to make more space in front of them. Enjoying Potter's attention, Draco raises his wand and articulates another one of his nifty spells, this time to summon every single piece of clothing.
Troubled, Draco looks up and sees Granger and Weasley lounging a distance away, sharing a chaste kiss. They laugh and rest their foreheads together, all frothed up in the summer flings of love.
Draco has carved out a quiet, peaceful career in Hogwarts, and he certainly doesn't need Potter messing things up for him. Besides, why is he decked out in Quidditch gear anyway — flying lessons and Quidditch trials start only two weeks into term.
Malfoy had floundered, his eyes still latched onto Harry's lips. "How dare you kiss me back, Potter?! How dare you..."
"No letters? Well... we can't turn him away now, can we?
After they're finished, Potter goes to the window and glances at Draco. Potter hesitates for a heartbeat, before extending his arm and wiping the condensation from the window with the end of his sleeve.
"Your special treacle sauce?" He asks in a hushed voice.
Draco hasn't even seen the man himself in seven years, yet he has sat through three separate conversations about him; two from Robards and Charlie, and one from Minerva. The Headmistress sought him out soon after he returned, breaking the news that Harry Potter is replacing Madam Hooch as Flying Instructor, although he requested for the name of his classes to be changed to "Quidditch and Muggle Games" to "better reflect the scope" of his lessons.
“Yeah. Nothing’s broken. I’m fine.” Draco squints around the pitch. “The Snitch…”
Marjorie scrunches up her button nose as she recalls. “For two and a half years? He comes in every Thursday. Tuesdays are jazz nights, and they’re really popular.” She pauses, giving him a knowing look that is similar to Hermione’s perceptiveness. “But you’d prefer Thursdays, huh?”
Potter’s hold slackens at once. “I should’ve been gentler with you,” he says in a small voice, and if Draco was a better person, he would’ve taken Potter in his arms and comforted him.
"Is this what you really think of me?" Harry says softly, trying to rein in his own annoyance, because being an Auror has taught Harry that life isn't black or white, good or bad, in fact, it's the exact
Potter stops singing.
"Don't be silly," Draco says. He turns on the tap to rinse the pot. "It's your job, your duty—"
Harry’s mouth waters. Malfoy’s cock is gorgeous — long and curving slightly to the right. He aches to trace his tongue around it, to fill his entire mouth with it. He licks his lips, swallowing his saliva. They’re now naked, save for their unbuttoned shirts.
Potter's eyes widen at the sight of a half-naked Draco in his black jeans, his lips turning up into a slow smile of satisfaction. Draco simply arches a brow in return and sits up in bed.
Harry turns around to face the ocean, and Draco hugs him from the back.
Harry’s eyebrows are still knitted into a frown when he speaks. “I know. I’ve been thinking. If it were me, I…” He trails off and looks out of the window, sighing deeply. The dappled sunlight sifting through passing trees throws ephemeral shadows on Harry’s features. He skewers Draco with a heated gaze, his lip curling in derision. “I can’t erase your entire upbringing and family values, but you aren’t your father, no matter how much you look like, and no matter how sometimes, you want to be like him.”
This time, their kiss is certain and confident. Draco's lips part at once for Potter to deepen the kiss. He wastes no time in wrapping his arms around Draco, his fingers threading through blond strands. Potter's stubble scratches against Draco's cheeks, and Draco skims his palms over Potter's broad chest, a moan escaping his lips. All that time admiring from afar, and now he can finally touch. He winds his arms around Potter's shoulders and squeezes, grinning into the kiss when Potter grunts and hauls him closer.
— his brain supplies helpfully — and er, Harry's always a man of his word.
The dragon is slowly heaving up from the ground, the ropes snapping like strings as she recovers from the barrage of spells. She eyes Charlie's hut with renewed focus. Potter looks down at a hissing Pork Chop, who is glaring at them in disapproval, her jaws clamped around his broom. He snatches it up.
They lapse into an uncomfortable silence after that stilted exchange. Harry wriggles his toes in his shoes, his fingers tightening on his knees. After a moment, Draco clears his throat and picks up the thread of conversation. They talk about Rose — a safe topic. Harry loves the pride radiating from Draco as he talks at length about Rose, pausing every few minutes to stop her from nibbling on the whale and throwing the rattle out from her stroller.
"Eight months, Harry," Draco breaks off to murmur. Harry kisses his jaw, his cheeks and his nose while he talks. "Eight long months, thought of you every day..." Draco's words hitch into a gasp when Harry begins to suck on the side of his neck, just below his earrings. "Didn't want to let myself hope, because what if you've found someone, someone with less baggage and a clearer head—"
Malfoy's smile wilts and falls off entirely when Harry continues his rant.
Harry imagines Malfoy, all alone in his flat, with nothing but his guitar and songs keeping him company, and finds similarities to himself, hunched at his easel at Grimmauld Place, engrossed in a flurry of paintings. Sometimes, he's so caught up in his work that Ron and Hermione have to drag him out for fresh air and food.
Harry shrugs and turns around to the start of the line to replace his cutlery. He looks at the bar, locking eyes with—
Flustered, Malfoy lunges forward and shuts him up with a kiss so intense that Harry forgets his sentence. When they pull apart, Malfoy's eyes glimmer with intent, his control clicking back into place. He drapes himself on top of Harry and shoots him a coquettish wink. Renewed lust fires in Harry's system, and he gazes at Malfoy, his chest heaving and lips parted in anticipation.
Humphrey turns his head towards Draco, shooting him a horrified look.
Potter's about to press his lips onto Draco's shaft, but Draco leans his hips back to dodge Potter's mouth.
Draco sighs, and he's about to say something when Harry puts his palms up and admits, "Yeah, I know what you're gonna say. I could've used my name, but… honestly, I don’t wanna build a business using my fame."
Another beat of silence.
Malfoy frowns in indignation. "Think it's funny, do you?" He points at the other cupboard. "I wonder what's in yours. Bet it's even kinkier, full of whips and chains and… and sexy costumes, I reckon!"
Draco’s jaw clenches, the familiar fire flaring in his bones chasing away his parents’ disapproval. “You’re on!”
…” He promptly threads his fingers through Draco’s hair and rubs his scalp in soothing, circular motions, exactly like how Mother used to do when he was sick.
The minute Charlie got wind of the Care of Magical Creatures vacancy, he took the first Portkey out of Romania into London, Flooed to Hogsmeade and flew to Hogwarts, before charging wildly into one of Minerva's Transfiguration lessons and waving his resume like a madman.
"Coincidentally, it was after the night you fled Hogwarts in that overly dramatic manner." Parkinson taps a finger on her lower lip, pretending to be deep in thought. "You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?"
After that’s all sorted out, Draco breathes a sigh of relief when the last of Slytherin House files out. He's the only one left in the Hall. He checks his watch — fifteen minutes since the start of first period. Add another five to ten minutes of travelling time, which means the latest that they'll be late for would be twenty-five minutes.
Charlie and he are at the shores of the lake on a cool and clear Sunday afternoon. The imposing towers of the castle are to their left, reaching into the blue skies. Faint sunshine peeks out from the edges of white puffball clouds, glimmering on the lake. Mountains stretch into the horizon beyond, the farthest ones obscured by a thick fog. A playful gust of wind glides across Harry’s skin, and he ruffles his hair, irritated.
“These different alternatives sound intriguing.” Potter’s enthusiasm is infectious, and Draco finds himself nodding along with him.
Pansy Parkinson peers around Narcissa, skewering him with a piercing gaze.
It was nightfall at the drawing room of the Manor, the curtains rustling in the breeze and pale moonlight spilling across the floor. Draco was kneeling in front of the Dark Lord, who was twirling his wand and eyeing him with undisguised glee. In the audience were his parents, along with a few Death Eaters. Panic, fear and doubt raged in his bloodstream like an inferno—not because he was afraid of the Marking process, but with this Mark burned on him, it was irrefutable proof that he served the Dark Lord. Should Potter emerge victorious, Draco would have to face the consequences of his actions—Azkaban.
"I want you to watch," he says, his voice hoarse. He coats Draco’s cock with more treacle and dives in again. Draco watches, burning the image of Harry sucking his dripping cock like how he can never forget the memory of Harry riding him last night, his cock pushing into Harry's arse just like how it's pushing into Harry's mouth right now, oh
The song playing on stage ends; the ensuing silence echoes like a death knell.
Malfoy chuckles. "Nothing important. Don't worry, Potter." He drags his fingertips along Harry’s hardening cock. "He's not you."
"Oh, I see." Ron pushes his tray along. "You've complimented his hair, his eyes, his arse, and now his hands. Are you working your way down his body?"
"Yes. Malfoy must be good at what he does," Hermione answers, recalling how Harry had hurled the review in the fireplace and locked himself up in his kitchen afterwards.
He gazes out the window, placing his chin on his palm and grinning. The shops and bistros in the square are bustling, and his favourite store is the bakery below his flat. He wakes up to the scent of freshly baked bread every morning, and yesterday Elena gave him an extra roll.
He turns to Draco, and apparently has put two and two together, for he says, "Calm down. Canary Creams were one of the first few products that Fred and I had worked on in Hogwarts, so I'm sure we can fix it. Just tell me what changes you made."
“What?” Harry starts at the sudden mention of Oliver. He blinks, his confusion vanishing as he gets it. The gossip column of the
George throws his arms up in exasperation.
"Slow. I want it slow this time," Harry orders, his head sinking down on the pillows when Draco fucks his cock all into him.
"Whoa, sorry!" Charlie exclaims, stepping back at once.
Draco could scarcely believe his eyes when he saw his parents' choice of attire for the evening.
Draco sighs and nods happily, squeezing Harry's shoulders.
George rolls his eyes and inwardly asks for the heavens to imbue him with the patience of a saint.
"You know he's doing this purely for the promise of more food," Draco says, rolling his eyes.
Draco wonders as he gazes at Harry’s upturned palms and the hope shimmering in Harry’s request.
Humphrey purrs and catches it in his beak.
“Still the same, Malfoy? Can’t even catch it when it’s right under your nose?”
Instead of words, Potter simply reaches over and covers Draco's hand with his own.
"There's a number you can ring, you know, when you get lost here with the lights off behind closed doors," Malfoy says cryptically and tips his head in the direction of the office that Harry had tried to break into days before. With his eyes boring hard into Harry's, Malfoy reaches for his hand and traces a seven-digit number on his palm.
"Fine, if that's the way you want it!" Harry snarls, and without a backwards glance, storms out of the flat and Apparates home.
Damn, Malfoy is smooth.
Draco would tease him about it, but he's sure he has an equally sappy smile on his own face.
Draco doesn’t know what’s going to happen, but a traitorous part of him doesn’t want anything to happen to Potter. He remembers how his heart had cramped in worry while he watched Potter’s battle with the Horntail. He slumps against the wall, rubbing his fingers on his lips. Potter’s kisses set him on fire and make him feel more alive than anything else, even Quidditch.
Hermione soon falls asleep, the train-tracks of tears drying on her cheeks and her hands clenched on the duvet.
That was when she knew.
"Harry, your elbow is in your pasta."
"You bastard! You utter, fucking prick!" Draco hollers, cradling his jaw in his palm. The metallic tang of blood in his mouth propels him to further heights of fury. He lunges towards Potter, and they're rolling around on the floor in a tangle of punching and kicking limbs.
Kingsley clears his throat. "Serpentes is holding auditions for new strippers this Friday night."
...and their eyes had met.
Rain plops hard on the ground, and gravel crunches under his Italian loafers as Draco groans and increases his pace. When Draco is near, Harry grabs him by the hand, and they laugh and jog past the fields of flowers and sculptures.
Christ, that was what he did before he sucked Harry's cock down his throat, and the way he's lapping at those fingers, like how he licked his come off—
Harry links his fingers behind his head and makes himself comfortable at the bar.
It's a snippet from a Muggle newspaper displaying the timings of a particular movie shown in a London cinema.
His lips tugged up into a dreamy smile, Harry removes his glasses, rests his elbows on the railing of the balcony, lays his head on his arms and closes his eyes. He lets himself drift away with the flawless running notes of the guitar, as fluid and calming as water flowing gently over rocks in a waterfall. When paired with that voice, as smooth and melodic as the guitar itself, well, that’s enough to make Harry weak in the knees. The voice isn’t deep or gruff; it has a light and captivating quality to it, and something about it makes Harry want to curl up in bed and fall asleep to this man serenading him.
Draco’s heart stops for a split second, before thudding in double-quick time. “It’s because Weasley didn’t join the Academy. Your group of friends weren’t there, that’s why you—“
A rising guilt begins to creep into Draco.
The next thirty minutes pass by fairly uneventfully. They throw out Potter's holey socks and T-shirts, despite his protests of "Hey, they're comfortable!" Out goes what Draco likes to call someday clothes — things that people cling to for the day when they finally lose enough weight. "No such thing," Draco says firmly, tossing a pair of tight black jeans. Next goes some of Potter's old Hogwarts clothes — robes, hats, cloaks and school uniforms.
"You called me Harry."
He takes a step away.
Malfoy begins to button his shirt. "Room of Requirement. We obviously can't go to the dorms,” he says briskly.
Pork Chop emerges from the bathroom, a small towel clamped in her jaws. She pauses, and tilts her head at him, as if curious. Draco looks away and retrieves the hangover potions from his pocket, putting them on the table. Potter shivers and fumbles for the duvet. There's a flare in the fireplace; with a fiery breath, the snake has set the hearth on fire. She picks up the towel that she placed on the floor, climbs up to the bed, tips her head towards Potter and looks at Draco expectantly.
With that, he nods at the two Healers flanking Harry and Ron, and exits the room.
Harry sighs and thumps his head on the mattress, his eyes downcast.
Potter’s hands fasten on his hips. “But I’ll hurt you.” Despite his words, he’s already pushing in, oh
"Wanna see the duck, Rose?" Harry settles her on his lap, slides his left arm around her middle and points to the duck with his right hand. "There it is, going to meet his friends," he adds, his finger following the duck, which is flapping its wings and hurrying towards a flock of ducks.
It's as if the rest of the world has fallen away; there's no space in Draco's brain except for Harry.
“Harry, you can’t expect him to have invited you.”
It wasn’t necessarily a terrible way to spend his morning, but it was certainly not the most ideal. Nighttime snow had snaked around some of their protective wards and painted itself upon the carefully concealed flowers and herbs that they grew.
Zabini tapped Parkinson shortly, and she huffed, heading back into the Slytherin common room. Harry felt even more uncomfortable alone in Zabini’s presence.
Oh, absolutely not.
Harry can only hear the bass, a pounding rhythm circling throughout the house and reverberating through every bone in his body. The lights are dim and low, and figures sway back and forth attuned to roaring music that he doesn’t particularly like.
Draco sniffed, holding his head a little higher than before. Defending against anger was easier than sadness. “I don’t think this is working. I’m not the type to give up on things, Harry, but sometimes there are things worth giving up on. Our marriage, our life — this is not what I want anymore.”
“I’ve thought about it, yes.” Draco admits. “My mother raised me on stories about soulmates. It was important, especially in the pure-blood communities.”
Though Harry, insensitively, feels as though it’s a short period of time, he claps along with the rest of the group who seem ecstatic about her statement.
“We debated taking you to St Mungo’s last night,” he offers, eventually.
“No, no!” the shopkeeper said, knitting his brows together. “The user is never
“I don’t want to be stuck in the house all day without anyone. It’s not good for me, surely you can understand that.”
“Hello to you too.”
They’d been spending more time with each other recently without even purposefully meaning to do so. Sometimes, Harry would just show up at Draco’s with takeout and a film recommendation, and he’d simply let him in like it was a normal thing to be doing. Draco would dutifully try to sober up before Harry could take any notice, but it never really worked. Sometimes Draco met him outside work, and they went for long meandering walks in the freezing weather. Somehow, Harry liked that better. When they were both in their right state of mind.
“Oi, you fuckers
Draco pauses, fumbling with a thread loose in the comforter. “I’m not used to this.”
They head out of the bakery and into the busy street. If it’s possible, the Alley has grown more crowded, and people bustle around with their new purchases. Harry directs them to Flourish and Blotts first, because if there’s an easy person to buy a gift for, it has always been Hermione.
“And it worries me that you’re only really sober when we’re in public together,” Harry continues. “Something has to change because I care about you too much to lose you. It would break me.”
Suddenly, Draco pulled back. “We should go.” He spoke softly as if the room had gone quiet. Neither of them had focused much on their food.
Only moments later, Harry was floating four heaped plates of chicken and clementines over to the dinner table. Draco practically had hearts in his eyes at the sight of Harry’s domesticity — which was new.
Around eight in the evening, guests began arriving and Draco was nowhere to be found. Apparently, he had told Ginny he needed some time alone.
“I thought you didn’t have an owl,” Harry says, raising an eyebrow, as Draco follows down the stairs behind him.
“Would you consider yourself a dragon then?” another asked, teasingly poking at his side.
Harry admired his husband for just a moment longer before tearing his eyes away and back to his book. He flipped the page, focusing on the author’s words, an endless stream of consciousness that wasn’t interesting enough for Harry to really invest himself in.
Harry turned on his heel before she could say any more and exited the bakery. He took in air through his lungs as if he’d been holding a breath since before he entered. Something about Madam Odessa had put him off. Even the red velvet cupcake was less enticing than before.
“Yes, we’re clear.”
“I haven’t seen many people since the war,” Harry says, quieter this time.
Harry tries to hold himself back, but he finds himself unable to and wraps his arms around her then and there. They cry together. He wants to get on his knees and apologize to her until he has no voice left at all. But he knows the best he can do for Narcissa is to keep her promise. Harry already knows he will.
“Draco,” Harry says, surprised, moving forward on the bed to sit closer to him. “I didn’t mean to upset you.”
“I’ve only seen you a handful of times,” Harry reasons. He sits up from the headboard, facing Draco head on. “But I would argue those times are worth much more than what you're willing to give them.”
Cold water snaked in tendrils along the length of Harry’s legs. He couldn’t reward himself with a hot and relaxing shower after what he had done.
“Don’t even start.” Harry massages his temples, falling into step beside Ron as they approach the elevators.
Someone coughed from the doorway, and Pansy and Harry pulled apart. He hadn’t realised how close their faces had been until he stood firmly back on the balls of his feet and forced himself to look at the door.
“A few drops will do.”
Draco’s hands moved, bracing against Harry’s firm chest in protest. “You’re drunk,” he said, feeling distinctly inebriated himself. The world spun dizzyingly around him in a swirl and stretch of light against darkness. Harry’s lips parted in invitation.
“I am
, and subsequently Luna. Maybe she’d know what to do about his peculiar situation. He had considered contacting Hermione before, but there was no doubt she would run to Harry and tell him all about it.
Ron catches up with him on the way.
When Draco had moved to Bloomsbury, he was afraid it was going to be too quiet. Something like the life he’d lived in his lonely cottage with Harry, tending to a garden he hardly cared for and surrounded by so much extra life in his plants that it blinded him from his own.
He lets himself be pulled in, breathing in the scent of crushed lavender and root vegetables. She’s presumably been working in the garden.
Before he can find the will within him to argue, Pansy appears in the doorway, her arms crossed over her narrow waist. Draco stares at him like he’s a bit of rubbish on the floor.
“Bed?” Harry asked, his eyes hooded.
“Well, you have to be here too,” Harry points out.
“Everyone
“Draco, we’ve talked about this before, seeing other people is just going to upset you.”
“Oh, er, I’m not really looking for anything else,” Harry started, but the man waved a hand noncommittally.
Draco knew she was entirely too clever for her own good.
They’re small tears that prick gently at the corner where his eyes meet his nose and threaten to run down his face. Harry hates that he notices how expressive, how beautiful Draco looks with bright, watery eyes.
“Oh yeah, don’t worry Draco,” Hermione pipes up. “Harry told us about the whole soulmates thing when he first found out. It’s so lovely to see you two together, we’ve been waiting quite a while—”
“Ginny’s worried about Draco,” Harry said, wishing he could suppress how bitter he sounded.
“I’ve been okay,” Harry said with a small smile, and Draco’s heart squeezed in his chest.
,” Draco says. His face pinches together in a way that Harry has never seen it before.
Harry’s fingers were down Draco’s throat in an instant, seeking out the release of soft fleshy tonsils. Harry felt for a place as far back as he could before pressing down. Draco tensed from underneath him as Harry turned him on his side. He dribbled saliva down the corner of his mouth, but nothing came up that would’ve given Harry any relief.
At the far side of the room, the windows were shuttered, as they always were, and Draco was splayed out on his back. He was still wearing his pants from the night before, green cotton boxers that, despite fitting him years ago, were terribly loose around the hips now.
They sit in silence for a while, Draco on his back, bleary-eyed and focused on his breathing. He seems far too calm, but Harry supposes it must be something in the drug. Pansy has stopped crying, and Theo is holding onto her hand as though it’ll physically hurt him to let go. Draco’s eyes close to sleep, and Harry resists the urge to wake him, if only to know that he’s alive and breathing and alright.
it’s not an ideal situation, but it’s not my fault Malfoy.” He felt his ears go a little red and realized he hadn’t meant to be so defensive.
Clearly, in the past few weeks, Harry had been noticing how compliant Draco had been. How eager he was to do what was asked of him. And Harry, like the ever-positive Gryffindor that he was, had probably decided that Draco was just trying to be nice for once. That he was really trying. Harry probably liked him like this, Draco mused. The real Draco was much snarkier and less accommodating. Nobody liked that.
Harry tucked in, starved from a day’s worth of action. Draco eyed his plate uncomfortably, placing a hand over his stomach. He sipped at his tea, pointedly avoiding eye contact with his food.
He sicked up over the rose bush for reasons apart from the long jump.
?” Malfoy seethed from the steps of the entrance hall. “You could’ve fucking told me.”
Draco looked up, hopeful. “You knew what they meant?”
“I’m not,” Draco said firmly. “I’m a good person. I’ve changed,” he tried, hoping he was convincing his subconscious more than himself.
To match his terrible attitude, Draco looks like hell. There had at least been some life and colour in his face in the morning. But now, Draco seems like a shell of himself, cheekbones cutting sharply through the skin of his face, and blue lips cracked, discoloured and flaking with dry skin. Harry wonders if it was the drug he’d taken the night before, but he couldn’t remember Draco looking so awful at all. In fact, he’d been almost ethereal.
Harry glanced down at the bunch and wondered why. If anything, they reminded him entirely of Draco. They were small and white, and impossibly delicate. He breathed in the scent of warm honey and citrus, enjoying how sweet it made the air around him smell. When Harry broke his gaze from his gift to say thank you, Draco was already gone.
“He finally trusts me as a friend. I don’t want him to think I’m only with him because I want something from him.”
Harry positioned himself to the side, so Malfoy would have to face him. “I have an idea.”
His hands worked mechanically underneath him, setting the kettle to boil and preparing the rest of their breakfast. He set the eggs out on the table, but they were fresh out of their usual country loaf. Draco would be irritable that there was no toast...unless.
Harry did it quickly now, tipping the tiniest bit of liquid into the cup. As usual, it swirled into a deep Oxford blue before returning swiftly to its original state as if it had never been disturbed in the first place.
On the other hand, maybe the voice was trying to help him overcome a debilitating and, frankly, embarrassing fear. Perhaps it was a good thing, after all. Draco took a breath; everything was still.
“Oh, please.” Pansy laughs lightly, before leaning forward to press a soft and gentle kiss to his lips. “At this point, what’s mine is yours.”
“It’ll be fine,” Pansy says, though Harry never trusts her enough because she’s always been an ultimate defender of Narcissa. “She’s not the warmest woman, but she has a good heart.”
, he wants to correct but doesn’t bother.
Draco looks back at him through hooded eyes. He’s wringing his hands together underneath knitted mittens. There’s fear in his expression that makes Harry’s want to wrap him up in a hug and refuse to let go.
After a few hours, they sat down for a rest at one of the benches.
“There’s no need to apologise,” Malfoy says with a wry smile. He perches on the chocolate settee, across from Harry, and a Glencairn glass appears atop the surface of a wooden-bound book. Malfoy swirls the amber liquid around inside, giving it a tentative inhale, before placing it back down on its perch. “Although, I wouldn’t mind an explanation if there’s one you would be willing to offer.”
Draco didn’t bother to argue, and Harry knew his answer.
“Something’s different. You’re different,” Draco stated, working to keep panic from seeping into his tone. His attempt was half-hearted, though, and it was apparent he was worried, terrified, of the person in front of him. Instincts on high alert, Draco desired to put the utmost amount of space between his husband and himself.
“You don’t want what’s best for both of us. You want what’s best for you.”
A beat passes as Harry registers the confession with surprise.
A flickering candle on his bedside temporarily illuminates a sad, torn grimace upon Draco’s mouth. And even then, Harry thinks he still might be the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen.
Harry could kiss her for it if he wasn't so painfully obsessed with someone else at the table.
“Do you know where he is?” Harry asks, feeling his heart thumping away unpleasantly in his ribcage. There are quiet alarm bells going off in his head, and something feels a bit wrong. If anybody would know what Draco was doing after the war, Harry would have bet that it would be his precious mother. Now, he’s not so sure. But if Draco doesn't have her, then who does he have?
“Draco, you know why we can’t do that,” Harry said, struggling to keep his calm.
“So you wanted to go there to get
Harry wept. It was a sob that wracked through his body, but it was silent, pleading. Desperate in a way that Harry never had been before.
Harry’s strong figure parted the gathering crowd and moved towards him like a mirage.
He kissed her cheek, as he usually did, and turned on his heel before more questions were directed his way. It wasn’t as if he could explain how he felt, really. But something felt the slightest bit off, and Draco was going to make it his mission to find out what.
Draco’s gaze grew colder, but it was turning to exasperation rather than pure resentment. Harry could tell. They had reached Downtown Perth, and while it was still quiet, Muggles littered the streets; either heading home from the workday or ducking in and out of quaint shops for forgotten errands. Harry found the sudden crowdedness of the narrow road reminded him a little of Diagon Alley. Though it was definitely less lively, he found it comforting and quite lovely. Draco didn’t seem to mind it either, and Harry watched his eyes flick between people and buildings. There was much to look at after the empty streets they were first greeted by.
Harry let Hermione’s voice bleed into the background as he settled into the familiarity of the whole event. It was only a few times a year that he got together with his friends like this, and he missed it more than anything. He would do whatever it took to get it back, but wasn’t sure how to begin. He would never admit to anyone that he missed the war, because he didn’t. But he missed the camaraderie of it all, the sense of belonging. His Auror position would never fill that void, even if it had done the trick for his friend.
“How do you want me?” Draco exhales, face flushed crimson red.
“Yeah. Knowing him, he wouldn’t have invited me anyway unless he was up to something.”
Harry found himself frightened by the thought that his marriage would continue down a loveless path. He worried even more that neither of them wanted to be unemotional, but were unsure the other was thinking the same thing. A small part of Harry hoped that was the case, because that would mean Draco still cared for him in the way he had before.
“Come sit,” Hermione says into the silence.
“What do you mean?” Harry asked. “I’m right here.”
“He’ll come when he’s ready, Draco. You know I can’t force him.” Clove sighed, propping herself up on the edge of the bed. “He’s here every day, though.”
Today was Draco’s twenty-fifth birthday.
“Can’t you feel it?” Draco interrupted, digging his toes deep into the soil and closing his eyes.
Draco turned back, hoisting the desserts up on his waist. There was much to do before the dinner party that evening.
Betrayal flashed through Ron’s eyes, “Like hell, you’re not involved, Harry. You two out here
Draco inhales, heavy and forced, his head limp in Harry’s lap, wetting the fabric of his jeans. Harry runs rough, calloused fingers through his hair until Draco’s breathing is steady. He sniffles against Harry’s leg.
“What are you talking about?” Draco asked his reflection, already fearing the answer.
“Yeah, something like that.”
“It feels like everything in my life, the good and the bad, fall away into nothing. And every worry, hope, or fear I’ve ever had is gone, and it’s just me alone with my high.” Draco inhales and then exhales. “Basically, it feels really fucking good.”
“No, you listen,” Draco interrupts, exasperated. “You thought it was right to tell the two of them before me?”
Hermione cleared her throat uncomfortably. “I think what Ron’s trying to say is that this is something that runs deep within your magic. Wizard cores can only match with a single other core. There is, well there always has been, a person out there who was made specifically for you.”
“You should have stopped,” Draco said, his tone dry. He wasn’t sure he could bring himself to be emotional about the situation. In the moment, he’d focused more on beating the voice than his husband anyway.
“I have never hated anyone in my life more than I hate you at this moment.”
“What’s he reading?” Harry asks the clerk as he’s buying the book.
Draco looks up at him, confusion written into his eyes.
“Where the hell were you last night?” Ron asks. “‘Mione and I popped around your place to see if you wanted to grab a drink.”
The unpredictability of the pain was what made his situation so frightening. At least when he was being tortured, he’d hear the words first and know what was about to happen. Now he’d need to play a guessing game. What would set off the pain, and what wouldn’t? Insulting his husband was an uncrossable line.
“Er, yes, he’s my husband, yes,” Harry said, finding odd words coming out of his mouth before he could stop them.
“Oh,” Harry said stupidly, unsure of what to say. Usually, he was quite good at interacting with family members of the deceased, but something about this death felt foreign and personal at the same time. “I’m sorry to hear that. I wish I could’ve gotten to know her better during those days.”
Their cottage was cosy, unlike any home Harry had been in before. He loved it to bits, and was certain Draco had too when they signed the papers a few years back. Harry had insisted they live just outside London, while Draco was keen on a flat in the heart of the city. But it was their first year of marriage, and they were still so young.
“I just – well, I wanted to know what you meant when we were outside of McGonagall’s office a few weeks ago.” When Draco looked back at him with uncertainty, Harry bit the bullet. “I mean, like, why did you get angry with me? You said this was supposed to be your year. I wasn’t sure what exactly that meant.”
“Alright,” Draco says, his voice short. “If that’s how you really feel.”
“But if it goes balls-up, I’ll be here and so will the rest of us,” Ginny smiles encouragingly.
“Hi everyone,” she says, sitting up taller in her seat. “I’m Ollie, and I’ve been sober for two weeks.”
Pansy swallowed a bite of food, before dabbing at the corner of her mouth with a napkin. She’d always eaten so politely, just like Draco. Harry and Ginny, on the other hand, ate like Weasleys — joyously and brazenly.
“Well, do you know where he is?” Harry asks again, this time more demanding. He can’t believe Narcissa would remain so apathetic about her own son’s disappearance. Let alone her former Death Eater son. Harry finds himself a little furious that the Ministry wouldn’t keep better tabs. “I would think that you would go find him if you didn’t.”
“Are you sure?” he asked diplomatically, praying to God himself that he wouldn’t have to stay behind and help her finish up the endless fieldwork forms that lay on both of their desks.
Before Harry can respond, Seamus is opening the door with a lazy grin plastered upon his soft features. He corrals both Harry and Blaise into a group hug.
Harry stood from the table too but bit back a hot retort. Malfoy seemed sincere in what he said, and it was unfair for Harry to turn down an olive branch. Even if he might argue, it was more of a twig. “You’re right,” he said all too quickly, “I’m just not used to, er, being nice to you, is all.”
“It’s cold out here,” he said conversationally, even though it was clear Harry was in no mood to talk.
“No, Draco. Draco and I are fine. We worked things out. Tell Ginny. I don’t want her to worry about him.” Harry was met with a poorly-hid look of incredulity.
“No.”
The group claps and cheers, and Ollie crushes them both into a painful hug despite her small frame.
“Mr Potter —”
“Pansy and Theo,” Harry supplies.
“Yes, God, he likes you!” Hermione cried, flinging her hands around in the air. “Can’t you see it? And you just left him there like he meant nothing to you, Harry. If someone did that to me, I’d feel so used. You have to go and talk to him.”
Draco, dozing at his side, was breathing softly into a pillow. He’d thrown the comforter from his upper body, which was uncharacteristic of him. It was rare that, even in the throes of sleep, he would let himself lie so visible like that. It was why he locked the door when he bathed. It was why whenever they were naked, it was always in the dark. Always,
Harry gulped, shaking his head. “I didn’t mean to hurt him. I honestly wasn’t thinking.”
“What the fuck,” Theo lifts his head from where it had been face-down in the pillow, creasing red lines across his cheek. “Potter, can’t you see I’m trying to sleep?”
“Why the fuck would you throw away all that hard work?” he had shouted.
A new approach would have to do.
“You sure? I’d be happy to help,” Draco replied, though his face was far from such.
Draco, Theodore Nott, and Pansy Parkinson are arranged in a circle on the large bed. Harry, finding himself drunker than he expects, sits just on the edge for some stability. Draco, with a slender and pale finger, beckons him forward. Harry complies without thought, scooting forward just enough so that he completes the missing link in their circle.
“Harry, I know I just met you, but I love you both,” she grins, pinching Draco’s cheeks. He bats her hands away with fondness.
Harry nodded, leaving silence to fill the room so that Capucine would keep talking.
A porcelain teacup sat lonely on the coffee table, and Harry’s books scattered in a display across its surface. Clearly, he had spent the latter portion of the afternoon working through a new stack. For someone so uninterested in his studies at school, Draco wondered how Harry managed to sit through the monotony of Muggle nonfiction.
After a half hour, Draco and Narcissa emerge from inside. They still seem to be a little awkward around each other, and Harry will have to ask him about their conversation after the ceremony, but this is the reality of life. It’s rare that things can be fixed so quickly, so perfectly. But Narcissa is delighted by the presence of her flower on the ceremony’s archway, and Draco beams back at her. There is always a time to at least try and make things right.
“I mean, he got what he deserved, don’t you think?” Ron laughed, clapping his hands together giddily. “You were only speaking the truth.”
“Good morning,” Draco said, taking a seat.
Draco slowly moved his hand up and lingered on Harry’s for a moment before closing around it. The moment was painfully intimate, and Harry wanted to move in closer, so he did. Draco did too, and for a still second, their faces were inches apart. Harry could have closed the gap in an instant. The air around Draco smelled like peppermint and cloves, and Harry found himself wanting to inhale the captivating scent. He wanted to bury his face in the sharp crook of that long  neck, and just die there.
“Fuck,” Harry breathes, his heart threatening to hammer right through his chest.
“I’m here to pick up a cake?” Harry said after a pause, his statement morphing unintentionally into a question.
He begins down the path and all too quickly arrives at the front door. It opens before he can reach his hand up to knock. A house elf guides him inside and seats him in the formal sitting room. Many people seem to be gathered outside, from what he can see through the window, where the ceremony will take place. Harry wonders why the house elf has guided him here, and he stands from the settee as if a mistake has been made.
Harry turned with surprise, a to-go cup in hand, and a receipt bunched in the other.
,” Draco sighed, and the plate stitched itself back together on the ground. “You could’ve hit me.”
Whatever he cooked, Draco would probably whinge about how it wasn’t good for the waistline.
He never drinks much at all, which is probably why, when he looks down to see an empty cup in his hand, his stomach gives an uncomfortable lurch. The room isn’t spinning quite yet, but Harry is dazed and fuzzy-headed, just at the brink of tipsy and waiting to fall into inebriation. It feels good to let go.
The Minister had called them in on an assignment, and while Harry and Ron were not partners, they were to work together on this particular case for unspecified purposes.
Draco is leaned up against the headboard, and while he still looks sickly and frail, there’s a bit more colour in his cheeks that Harry feels too relieved to see. Draco reaches up, tucking a small strand of blonde hair behind his ear before looking down at his lap. He wears an almost sheepish expression, as though he's embarrassed to be next to him at all. Harry blinks, unsure if he should break their delicate silence and acknowledge the harrowing events of the prior night. But he doesn't want to say something just to say it.  For once, he’d rather be deliberate with his words and make sure he's not doing something to set Draco off.
Harry narrowed his eyes, but curiosity swirled around his magic, making him feel alight with energy and trepidation. He inclined his head, as if to say,
Harry’s breath hitches, as he can’t help but take a moment to stare. It’s the dead of night, too dark outside for any civilised wizard to be awake, but Malfoy is. Charcoal trousers cling perfectly to his slender, yet toned legs. Malfoy has a rich wine-coloured dress shirt French tucked artfully into the hem and opted to leave a good few of the buttons undone. Cobalt blue ink stains detail his hands. Harry’s eyes trail unabashedly over the length of his smooth chest. His voice catches in his throat.
“He hasn’t been home recently?” Harry asks, his brow furrowing.
“Stop,” Draco implored, voice rough with hardened resolve. “Not now. Please, Harry.”
“Cayenne on eggs.” Draco shook his head at Harry’s plate. “I’ll never understand you.”
“Magical core?” Harry wrinkled his nose. “That sounds odd.”
Draco wondered if excusing himself to the toilets was too obvious of an escape.
“Luna asked?” Greg said, and Draco could feel the inquisitive smile across the phone.
“I don’t want you to do this,” Harry says softly.
“I know.” Harry shakes his head. He thinks about the morning. “He hasn’t changed much.”
“Ah,” Draco simpers, clearing his throat as his nonchalant demeanour returns. “A gatecrasher, are you?”
There are no purpled bags under his eyes anymore, no pointy cheekbones protruding sharply from the skin of his cheeks. His eyes don’t look hollow and set too deep into his face, but rather burst with a soft, quiet kind of intensity that only Draco can claim as his. He’s so beautiful, Harry thinks, no matter what he looked like before, or will in the future. But he’s so healthy and happy, and those are the only things Harry really needs in his life.
Draco sucked in a breath, but it was thin and hollow like he hadn’t taken in enough oxygen to make it worthwhile. “We were just talking,” he said, fidgeting in place and presenting Harry with a well-practiced technical truth. Draco’s eyes darted around the stretch of the room, feeling like an animal caged in by a predator with no escape in sight.
But Harry, without realising it, has been waiting for this moment for so long.
He’s too tired, his brain too foggy to think straight when he answers. Closing his eyes, he’s already falling back to sleep.
“Well,” Harry said, placing his palms flat on the table so he wouldn’t worry with his hands.
“You can’t ignore what just happened,” Hermione argues, leaning her hips up against the counter.
He covers his chest with his hands, as though they’ll somehow obscure the raised, colourless tissue that patterns lines down the length of his body. The scars reach down, extending their arms over Draco’s stomach, reaching around his hips, and trail back up to his ribs. They are angrier looking than Harry expects them to be.
He’s bent over the toilet, dry heaving into the bowl. Nothing seems to be coming out, though, and that’s an improvement in Harry’s eyes.
“Pauline Marchand’s killer confessed. He’s being held in the cells now before interrogation. We have him for a couple of hours before the Minister wants him sent to Azkaban. The
“Are you guys together?” Hermione asks, again her voice soft.
“Oh fuck, fuck Harry. Fuck this is so,
“I’m Draco, and this is Harry,” Malfoy said, pointing at Harry, who had crept up quietly next to him.
“Can I have a moment with him, Pansy?” Harry asks.
“I’m not sure I know what you mean.”
They drowned away their sorrows discreetly, finding a collective solace at the bottom of their bottles. Harry had apparently found his in the mystery woman at his side. The pair flirted back and forth as Draco knocked back his third drink and almost shattered it angrily onto the tabletop.
Harry raises an eyebrow. “Am I really the only person who didn’t know he threw those?”
That was the last moment Harry could really remember everything being okay.
“Of course,” Harry says quickly, stepping aside to let Draco enter.
A slight nervousness made its presence known in Draco’s stomach, but he nodded yes anyway. He felt himself twitch underneath his trousers in encouragement. There was no question that he, or something inside of him, wanted this badly.
“You and Draco were doing better —”
“It’s who I am.” Draco shrugs his shoulders.
“I’m so scared, Harry,” Malfoy mumbles gently, life slipping quickly from his grasp. His head is lolling sickeningly to one side.
Still, as much as Harry wants to define things as perfect, they are—and will be for a while—far from it. Draco withdrawing is taxing to the both of them. His changes in mood, bouts of depression, and aching desire to relapse are aspects of the ordeal that Harry did not expect to confront. He would do anything for Draco, but it’s a challenging task to tackle the drug abuse head on.
to deal with this. I want to help him get better.”
Harry looked at him, open-mouthed from across the table, his green eyes fearful. He opened his mouth as if he wanted to speak.
“I don’t think that’s what you are.”
supposed to see your betrothed on his wedding day!”
“I want to speak to Auror Potter...alone.”
“I prefer the yellow,” Harry decides.
“I’m not that drunk, Harry.”.
“Does that bother you?” Draco smiles cruelly, as though he wants Harry to say yes.
Harry couldn’t hide his surprise. “Devotion,” he said softly, entangling his hands in Draco’s, feeling warmth spread between their fingers. The flowers hadn’t made much sense at the time, but Harry felt they did now.
“Wake up,” Harry says again, shaking him gently, but there’s no response.
“Nice to see you too, love. It’s been too long. I’d ask you about work but I don’t think you’re here to talk about it,” Lavender chuckles, swiping a lock of curly blonde out of her eyes.
His reflection was smiling now, smirking down at him in a distinctly Malfoy manner.
If it’s possible, Draco’s expression grows colder and meaner, and Harry wishes he could rewind time and start the entire conversation, or even morning, over again.
“A particularly nasty hex, I suppose,” Harry says, resting his head back into his hands. “Usually, I can block, but I lost my wand out there.”
Draco hums in agreement, and they continue eating their dinner, chattering on about topics that Harry would never find interesting unless spoken from Draco’s lips themselves.
And Draco did. He reached up from his grasp in Harry’s arms and pressed bruising kisses to the corner of his jaw gently. Harry melted pliantly into the touch.
The basement is much more comforting of a room than Harry anticipates it to be. It looks exactly like those Muggle movies: chairs are arranged in a circle, and pastries and beverages sit atop a table to the side.
Harry takes a sip of water from his glass, if only to keep his hands busy.
Maybe it was a trick, an elaborate prank.
“You need me.”
“Ah,” Malfoy replies, knowingly. This time, he takes a sip of the whiskey, holding a hand out to offer it to Harry.
Their conversations were so clinical, and Harry wished he could just reach out and knock some emotion back into Draco. When had apathy become a painful constant?
“I don’t,” he bites out. “I’m just trying to be helpful.”
A part of the potion was almost addictive.
He looked down at himself self-consciously. “We’re going into the Muggle world. I’m wearing what everybody wears.”
“Leave me alone,” Draco said, finding his voice steady and strong at Harry’s mere presence. He could do this.
Draco doesn’t Apparate after he passes the gates, instead opting to head in the direction that Harry knows is near the tube station. He feels distinct amusement at the fact that Draco looks like he’s walking away from a particularly brutal one-night stand, clad in Harry’s oversized flannel pyjama bottoms and all.
Draco took the paper from Lyra and petted her affectionately behind her ears as he went. She followed him to his desk, where he held out a few treats for her taking. She squeaked eagerly and nuzzled into Draco’s knuckles as a thank you.
“Yeah, I am.”
A pained look crosses Draco’s features, and he pulls his knees up to his chest in a way that reminds Harry of how he used to curl up on his bed as a child.
Harry thought he could understand why. The statue in front of him bore a strange resemblance to the man at his side. The other sculptures in the room reflected soft curves and flowing fabrics despite their marble medium. It was what made them so impressive, to begin with. But this one was made up of harsh lines and angular features. His eyes were sharp and focused on the blade at his fingertips, and his body was leaner than the others that saturated the room. The blindingly white marble didn’t help its case either. Harry refused to admit the figure was gorgeous because that would mean admitting someone else was too. He wasn’t ready for that just yet.
“I know,” Harry said, wrapping a rough hand around his small waist. “But you’ve lost so much weight, eating would be good for you.”
“I think bad might be too gentle of a word to explain what happened,” Harry says.
“Look how pretty you are,” Harry said, deliriously high off of the sensation and throbbing heat wrapped around him.
After a moment, he felt Draco’s lean arms wrap around him, smelling familiar cologne. It took many moments, but his breathing slowed as hands ran through his hair gently and habitually. This routine was far too common in the year after the war, but it had been a while since Harry needed to be calmed down like this. A small patch of Draco’s button-down was wet with tears, and he half expected him to yell for ruining a newly pressed shirt. He stiffened instinctively in Draco’s foreign grasp.
“No, you’re not.”
“Let me speak to him first,” Harry says quietly.
“I’m gonna come,” Harry managed to get out, and he fucked Draco faster as if there was nothing more in the world he was meant to do other than this.
“I meant, please call me Harry.” He picked his wand back up. “We’re friends now. At least I consider us friends, and my friends call me Harry.”
Last year, this day was one of Harry’s favourites of the year. He and Ginny had planned an elaborate dinner at The Horseshoe, a trendy restaurant tucked away in one corner of Diagon Alley. It was classy in a way that Draco appreciated, but quiet enough that the group was left unbothered by other diners. Afterward they apparated to Ginny’s, where she hosted them for drinks and cake. The night was filled with love and champagne, and Harry would have lived in that moment forever if he could.
“Luna’s,” Draco replied honestly. There wasn’t any significant use in hiding it; it would be easier to maintain a lie if it was a technical truth. Had Severus told him that? Maybe it was his mother. He couldn’t be bothered to remember.
Harry clambers out of the trapdoor and approaches him as one might slowly inch toward an animal prone to spooking. Carefully, and without much noise at all.
Draco began to interrupt, but Clove regarded him with a stern eye that forced his mouth closed. Narcissa seemed pleased at this.
“Fine,” Harry says. “I don’t really want to talk about it anymore.”
“Blimey Harry,” Ron remarked, uncapping a hangover potion from his drawer and passing it across the stretch of beds. “You look ghastly.”
“Good.” Ginny leaned in and pressed herself into his side for a hug. “I better get going then. I just wanted to make sure you weren’t lying here dead with an AK to the chest or something.”
If he could lock him up in a glass box and keep him safe and protected and untouched there for the rest of eternity, he would.
He taps out a few pink diamond-shaped pills into his palm and holds one out for Harry. He takes it without really thinking twice, examining its figure between his thumb and forefinger.
It was rare that he envied other people, but she and Pansy were the picture-perfect couple amongst their group of friends. Only Ron and Hermione competed for that spot in the nauseatingly domestic haven they’d created. “The Burrow 2.0” was what Draco had called it, as though it were an insult.
A large gash opens across the skin of Draco’s cheek. It looks like a scabbed over wound, torn open by his consistent movements. It’s bleeding little droplets of red down the left side of his face.
“No, thank you,” Harry says quietly, unable to take his eyes off of Draco. “Do you want to eat?”
Draco stared, transfixed by the figure in the mirror, telling him truths he’d pushed aside since the war. Because in many ways, his reflection wasn’t incorrect. He owed Harry everything, including his life. And if it weren’t for Harry, he’d be rotting in Azkaban alongside his father. Maybe rightfully so.
Cannoli would be an unexpected dessert to bring, and not quite something classically warm and cosy during the winter. But Pansy
“Should I check on him?” Theo asks.
Potter, but I stand by my statement. I cannot in good conscience release him back into your care until we’re sure he won’t be of any danger to himself.”
The only solution, although it’s a miserable one, seems to be encouraging Draco to seek help. And before he can even do that, he has to somehow convince Draco that they are close enough for Harry to be trustworthy. Which will be a mission and a half all by itself.
“You what!” Ron shouts, a vein in his forehead pulsing through skin. “Absolutely not, Harry.”
“But–” Harry begins, and Narcissa waves her hand angrily.
Instead, he trudged around the garden in Harry’s work boots that were two sizes too large and lamented his entire existence.
When Harry left for work that morning, he was waved off with a kiss to the forehead and a feeling of unconditional warmth. Butterflies fluttered in his stomach, almost like he was falling in love with Draco all over again.
“What is it?” Harry finally asked when they had both settled on the blanket. Draco had worked to keep his limbs away from the flowers, but Harry had spread out easily crushing a few in the process.
third year, Sirius Black?” A glint in Locke’s eyes told Harry he enjoyed the toying around.
“Your Auror?” Harry asks, raising his eyebrows.
Theo and Pansy burst into laughter, and Harry finds himself a bit horrified by the fact that their strong reactions relieve him.
After a moment, they broke apart. Draco leaned into the soft grass on his back, feeling more comfortable than he’d ever been.
fucking year. A year away from utter madness and from
Harry was seething, and he wasn’t sure why. His indifference from the day before had buried underneath rage and irritation that was clouding any inkling of common sense. He wanted to push Malfoy over like a child. It was even more upsetting to Harry how quickly the roles had shifted back to how they had been before the war. It was rare that Malfoy let go of much of his emotional side anymore, and Harry was startled to see it outside of McGonagall’s office. Even if it were only momentarily. Harry had felt as though somehow, he had the upper hand for a brief instance. It was apparent that he had now lost it.
“What the absolute fuck did you do that for?” Malfoy hissed, leaning across the table toward Harry. It was apparent people were still listening in. The Boy Who Lived yelling at Death Eater would likely make next morning’s headlines if they weren’t careful, Harry thought painfully but pushed away regret. He had gotten Malfoy to speak to him and that’s what mattered.
He spotted Ginny back by Ollivander’s, her arms full with shopping bags .
Harry found his heart rate picking up, and he drummed his fingers nervously against the tabletop. The fact that Draco’s smile was enough to send Harry’s heart into a tizzy was just short of alarming.
“Oh, now you’re happy, aren’t you?” Harry grumbled at her, turning to the kitchen. He commenced his breakfast ritual, cracking eggs into an available frying pan with one hand.
