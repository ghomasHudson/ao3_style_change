“I've always known. It was a real problem for my parents, Father in particular. He wanted me to marry some pure-blooded witch that he would pick for me, have an heir and keep my
Draco looked at him as if he'd grown an extra head. “Teaching you how to kiss.”
When he returned home—belly full and ear talked off—he looked at the hall table, sad that he hadn't had a chance to send his letter yet, when he noticed it had gone. The bowl of owl treats had been disturbed so Harry assumed that his owl had delivered it. Kreacher had probably sorted it out for him. He couldn't do any more than he had already; now all he
“Was that a hint of a compliment? And yes, well done; you beat a schoolboy in a school team during a school match. I'm surprised Puddlemere aren't beating a path to your door.”
“Write him a letter,” Pansy repeated. “He won't see you, or talk to you, but he might read a letter.”
Malfoy had acted normally all day. They'd worked side-by-side, doing what they did best and it was perfectly
“Yes,” Hedwig prompted, trying her utmost to sound calm and collected.
“I only lied when you asked if it was a coincidence.”
“What?” Harry spluttered. “I didn't. Well, I did, but I didn't say anything. I knew how much danger it would put you in. I didn't.”
“I want to say again that I'm glad that you two embraced this odd situation you found yourself in.”
The entire table—apart from Zach, who was looking decidedly confused—burst into laughter. Harry choked on his beer and Draco slapped him on the back.
“That's it. Not too bad, is it?” Glinda chuckled and everyone let out a collective sigh of relief. “Oops! I forgot the most important rule!”
“Why...when...why didn't you just
A clock chimed in the distance, but Draco ignored it as he caught up to Glinda, his partner by his side in a flash.
Draco was still in shock as he walked down to the dining hall for lunch. The house-elves had replaced their bed for singles, so that was something, but not nearly enough. They had, of course, tried to leave, but every time they'd reached the front gate, Glinda, a house-elf or a one of Glinda's assistants would be there to explain how they were stuck until Monday.
It had taken Draco a long time—and manoeuvres that only he could perform—to calm Harry down after Ron had left. Draco had managed to wrestle Harry's wand away from him after Ron and Hermione's faces had popped into the floo a couple of hours later, and Harry had attempted to blast the fireplace into tiny pieces.
They, without ever meaning to, were friends.
Harry had to grab Draco's arms to stop himself falling off the bed. “What?”
A closer look at the dreaded pamphlet had put paid to his usual plan. Draco hadn't thought that the weekend could have any more bad points until he'd spotted the three little words in a jaunty script at the bottom of the description.
With no children there to keep them at home, Harry and Ginny were free to socialise whenever they wanted. Dinner, shopping, pub. They relished in it. It wasn't long before they realised they weren't doing any of these together. They had separate groups of friends: Ginny and her team mates, Harry and his workmates from the Ministry. Which meant more and more evenings spent apart.
“Without further ado, please allow me to unveil a present to Harry Potter, and to all of us. This piece was commissioned by the Ministry and paid for by a very generous donor. Thank you, from all of us, once again, Mr Malfoy.”
“Thanks,” Draco said, obviously ignoring Harry's dig, “you're not looking so bad yourself. How's the café?”
Glinda crouched beside their seats and leant in closer. “I know you might think this might be a laugh and pointless because you're not actually a couple. But, please, do try; I think it might be of benefit to both of you and your professional relationship.”
“Firstly,” Glinda said as they walked into her room. “I see that your partnership might have progressed?”
Fuck it, Draco thought and drifted off to sleep.
Draco smiled. “Sounds like a plan.”
“We like each other.”
“Harry?”
Draco was from the future.
Harry sighed, squeezing Draco's knee. “I don't know. Both?”
Harry shrugged. “I didn't know what you wanted. I thought I'd cover all bases.”
Harry threw the closest thing to hand at her; it wasn’t Harry’s fault that that happened to be a treacle tart.
Harry waited for the last remnants of dizziness to disappear before opening his eyes and looking around the room to find out where he'd be holidaying.
“Well, yes,” Draco said. “We have to...”
It wasn't long before Draco regretted ever suggesting going to the pool. The first problem Draco encountered was down to his lack of magic.
“Good,” Draco replied, moving in for another kiss. “So, so good. Ginny's an idiot.”
Mission Impossible
“You're saying that all of our friends, the wizarding population and Molly bloody Weasley have read what is essentially our sex life, and no one knows you wrote it?”
“Of course, sir. Cash is perfectly fine. Now, let's have a look what we can do for you. Can I get you a cup of tea while we sort it out?”
“What the actual fuck are you talking about, Draco Malfoy?” Pansy had pulled herself up from the floor and was standing with her hands on her hips. “And don't you dare leave one fucking word out.”
Now, if
The headmistress wasted no time in announcing to the school that the next student caught 'living in the past' and 'bullying their fellow students' would be promptly returned home to their parents until they could, and I quote: 'learn how to function in normal society again'. Being present at that speech did make me wonder momentarily if the tales of her in front of the Wizengamot weren't exaggerated at all.
~ ~ ~
As Harry and Ginny approached the middle of the ballroom, Harry spotted something that had him turning around, ready to flee. At the very least he had a strong urge to bang his head repeatedly against something hard and door-shaped.
Harry did as he was asked, bracing himself against the still-cool tiles with his hands, water running down his back. Malfoy started at the nape of Harry's neck, kissing his way down his back. Harry gasped as Malfoy pulled at his arse, opening him up. He could feel the hot water between his cheeks, knowing that he wanted
The upset and shocked look on Potter's face had nothing to do with me removing the Jinx. Nothing at all.
Hedwig shook her head. Fuck it. She was going to enjoy it. It worked, whether she'd been involved or not.
Fuck. The whole world knew—it would have been plastered over the papers; I hadn't exactly been discreet. I gripped Harry tighter.
“Shut up and stop fishing for compliments. You know you're good looking.”
Draco wasn't blind. He knew damn well how good-looking Harry was; he just hadn't
His owl hadn't even returned from delivering his note, when Harry heard a knock at the front door.
“What? No! What are you on about? Oh! No, I meant
counselling? But we're not
Harry unfolded it and scoffed. “Tell me something I don't know! You wear a different pair of shoes every day of the week.”
' —rang in his ears.
“So you're using the drunk card?”
“No, I'm just early.” Zach smiled, but Harry could tell it wasn't a real one. “I wasn't expecting anybody else; I only bought enough takeaway for two.”
“Draco?” he asked, not believing his eyes.
“Okay,” she replied coolly. “This is high season, so the prices are quite expensive. And you would have to pay straight away.”
“Not it!” came the resounding cry from the group.
Draco raised an eyebrow.
Draco coughed and Harry patted him on the back.
It had all started three days ago. Three days of the silent treatment and Harry moping around the house. Harry had persuaded Draco that they
“Order, order! Settle down; I'd like to get this meeting started.”
Harry nodded. “Hermione obviously knows. I was never going to tell anyone I wrote them so no one would ever know it was us. But I am so sorry. Please forgive me and I promise I will never write another book—”
Hedwig had never been more grateful for Harry's habit of not sealing his letters than she was at that minute. The look of suspicion slowly slid from Darius' face as his beak opened in surprise.
Hermione tended to humour Ron as he ranted on about some subject or other. It was usually concerning the 'cheating bastards' in the local Quidditch game or the quality of the Australian wireless programmes, so an 'ah' here and an 'um' there covered it perfectly fine.
“I know,” Harry grumbled, rubbing his sore cheek. “Pansy already told me so this morning. Hermione, where is he?”
They're always here. I get up in the morning, and Hermione is popping in to see if I want to walk with her to work. Ron is owling me after work about the quidditch scores and asking for me out for a pint to discuss them. The Prophet is detailing the latest in the hunt for the rogue Death Eaters and my fellow Aurors are excited and making plans. Molly is popping in with food and details of her friend's single nieces and nephews. I spend too many evenings with her so I don't have to spend another bland evening with the simpering fools she tries to set me up with.
Apologise? For what? Harry couldn't think straight, not with Draco kissing up his neck again.
“What?” Harry said once he'd regained the ability to speak. He completely ignored the pool of tea spreading over the floor.
“Well, it is wine o'clock,” Harry said before wincing. “Nope, that's just bad. This way,” he added, ushering Draco into the kitchen.
Harry thought he'd only been asleep for five minutes, when he was awoken by the unmistakeable sound of his kettle boiling and his bloody biscuit tin being raided. A quick glance at the clock showed that he'd actually been asleep for close to two hours, and Brewin was no longer snuggled on his lap.
Harry decided to floo straight home after work, so he could get himself organised and work out exactly what he was going to say to Draco. He'd just finished making the tea—and putting out Draco's favourite chocolate digestives—when the kitchen door opened with a slam.
“What?” I hoped to Merlin that he hadn't gone sappy on me, talking of eternal love or some crap.
Harry did as he was asked and followed his fellow guests into the dining room. Looking over their faces, Harry was saddened to see the looks of upset and worry. Harry had to wonder who would do such a thing. Naturists weren't perverts; quite the opposite actually. Naturism was about embracing the natural state and enjoying the freedom to be without clothes if one so wished—not as a way of leering at the other guests.
It had worked well for a few years, and Harry was happy with the situation. If there was another thing Harry disliked, it was change. Harry told his friends that this year was no different to any other, but they wouldn't agree. It was special, they said. Something 'big' had to happen. No one would listen to Harry's argument that it wasn't going to happen. It was, they were sure of it.
At first, Harry thought that maybe Ron hadn't heard him correctly—the phone line was full of static, and Ron simply wouldn't stop shouting—but when the next letter arrived Harry's heart jumped. It was a small note, with Ron only saying how happy he was that Harry had found his own 'cuddle bunny' (Harry didn't need to know that much about his friends' relationship) and a small joke about Draco's name, which Harry expected (after all, he'd been joking about it since they were eleven, it would be strange for him to stop now).
Hermione laughed. Harry wanted to take it back and run and hide.
“And I would be thinking about it every single fucking time good old Mervin cut another budget. Me and you fucking right there on his desk.”
“It said—”
“What the fuck are you doing here anyway? And I thought I told you to never come near me again?”
so she sent him to Gerald for him to sort it out. He said that James and Scorpius might as well get their hair done at the same time. But I really think he just wanted to keep them out of trouble and he knows Gerald can handle them.”
Dog loved to watch while Draco put the sparkles up. He loved how passionate Draco was about the tree; how he was such a perfectionist about the placement of the sparkles. He loved the way Draco—hang on.
“That's me. I wrote that book, and all the others in the series. I'm Joshua Starkweather and I write erotic fiction. Well, it's not so much fiction as it's mainly inspired by us. Erotic novels, porn, whatever you want to call it—”

Harry smiled.
It would solve everything. Potter would leave me alone, and I'd no longer feel compelled to smile at his happy little face every time I saw him. Perfect.
“I know, but I couldn't explain myself properly. I
“We're here to support you in your successes and help you realise your hopes for the future,” Draco said. “And some other crap that the girls tried to drum into us.”
A small round of laughter bubbled from around the room, but Draco couldn't join in; his earlier hope was fading fast, and a quick look to Potter told him that he was feeling just as bad. Holding Hands Therapy. It
“So,” Draco said slowly. “How long have you wanted to shag me?”
The small pop of Grenville appearing in the living room had Draco jumping and spilling some of his whisky.
makes you happy then we will stand behind you through it. You will always have a place here, understood? Now I'm going to stop talking before I say happy again.”
It didn't take them long to finalise all the finer details of the divorce. Ginny was making good money from her Quidditch so it was just a matter of who got the house and where the kids went. The house was easy. Ginny loved Grimmauld Place. She'd spent years decorating the house to just how she wanted it—long gone were the house-elf heads and screaming portraits—and Harry didn't really care about it. He instead bought a new house in a nice wizarding area with a lovely park nearby.
“Okay,” Harry said, already scribbling on the parchment. “There.”
Teddy insists that Harry writes his letter to Father Christmas. He has been good, after all.
As Professor McGonagall called for silence, both Harry and Weasley were trying their hardest to get to the Hufflepuff table, with Granger and Finnegan holding on tightly to them, holding them back. Looking to the top table, I noticed McGonagall reading with a, quite frankly, scary look on her face, and I held my hand out, knowing
“Ginny, again?”
Harry shut him up with a kiss. “You talk a good game, Malfoy. Now shut up and—”
to stop doing that. Harry snuggled a little closer and Draco had a vague recollection of something else. Had Harry
to myself.”
Harry laughed, but dutifully dropped his fidgeting hands. “Everything okay out there?”
More drinks were handed out and, thankfully, talk soon returned to the normal bantering and teasing. Mainly about Ron and Hermione's upcoming holiday and just how sunburnt Ron was going to get.
Another couple of minutes passed. “Do you want me to go first?”
“What was that?” Harry asked, grinning. He had his suspicions.
Draco had never had a more awkward breakfast in his life, and that included the time his mother had popped in unexpectedly while he was
Draco poured them both fresh glasses and sat back in his chair. Harry could tell that he was actually interested in hearing what he had to say. Harry wasn't used to it.
“You absolute fucking idiot!”
“Are we all present? I'd like to start the meeting before the castle awakens.”
wanted to grab Harry and go back to their room, but for some unknown reason, his face lit up at Glinda's words and Draco expected him to be jumping up and down in excitement within seconds. Taking Harry's hand, Draco tried to reason with him.
I hadn't realised that my plan had solely consisted of ways to get Potter to undress. It most certainly hadn't been my intention. My plan was to annoy the hell out of Potter and get him to leave me alone. I wanted things to go back to how they should have been, with me and my friends against Potter and his cronies. Not in a 'my blood is better than your blood'-Voldie way, of course, but in a general, good old 'Gryffindor versus Slytherin' way.
I had no idea what I could've done to warrant such abuse. Sure, I'd done some pretty bad things during the war, but I really thought that was all behind me. It had been years since the end of the war, and people were more than accepting of me generally. The gossip pages certainly had no problem in plastering me all over their pages, with not an insult in sight (if you don't count their critique of mine and Harry's latest fight or, less often, my outfits).
“I don't understand,” Draco said, tears shining in the corner of his eye.
—Harry's best friends, after all. He had to try.
to feed himself. Shaking his head to dismiss that, quite frankly, scary, thought, Draco simply said hello to his neighbours and looked at Glinda when she clinked her glass.
I was determined to prove my worth and prove it I did. Just under forty minutes into the game, with Slytherin trailing 70-10, I caught sight of the snitch just to the side of the commentary box, the early winter sun making it sparkle ever so gently, and I went for it.
The waiter nodded and walked away.
Bob tenderly placed a tentacle around Arnold's body to protect him as the rest of BAHAHAHAH ran, hopped or flew at full pelt towards the castle.
“No, P-p-p-Harry—” Draco stopped abruptly.
“Cup of tea?”
“My parents—it's a tricky one. I've told them many times that I don't plan on getting married to some witch they pick for me, and with Lucius in prison, they can't force the idea. Mother will be okay; she'll probably try and take you under her wing and teach you the 'ways of the Malfoys'.”
“Thank you,” Draco said before raising his glass to the Giggly Girls. “We'll take it from here.”
was a favourite refrain.
with Ron in the evening. Harry didn't mind; he had already planned to make himself scarce for the lovebirds to have some privacy.
They'd barely got halfway through the list when Draco finally snapped. His team was useless. One had the spatial awareness of a drunken teenager. Giant was so uncoordinated, Draco seriously worried that he was going to hurt himself or somebody else. Frumpy had the extremely annoying habit of screeching whenever they found something on the list, and once or twice, something that wasn't. Beauty seemed to think that everybody else was there to serve her; he could finally see where the Bear got his troubles from.
was the problem. Draco bloody Malfoy.
Half an hour later, Harry was the proud owner of his very own tea shop. Or, as he preferred it to be called—for it sounded so much more manly—his very own café.
Pansy walked in about half an hour after Draco had left. She took one look at Harry's smiling face and demanded to know what had happened.
“What the pompous git is trying to say is that we discovered an old nondescript apology note written by Mr Longbottom in the Gryffindor common room.” Ignoring Darius' mutters about the state of said room, Hedwig continued. “The previous addressee's name was removed and the note was delivered to Professor Sprout. Mr Longbottom will now be allowed back into Greenhouse Three to attend to his shrubs and the case is closed.”
An idea popped into Draco's head suddenly, and he didn't waste a second in conveying his apologies to the group. No one could dismiss a prior engagement in Swansea with a potential wormroot supplier, after all.
“Thank you, Dean,” Harry said after the applause had died down once more. “It's beautiful, and the title is very fitting. The price we paid for a safe and happy world might have been high, but it
“Umm-hm,” Harry answered before he snuggled into Draco's side and fell asleep.
“Well, yes.” Draco shook his head. “How the bloody hell am I supposed to do it otherwise?”
The silent treatment, turning his back on Draco in bed, refusing to listen to reason—all of it. Harry was like a child when he was in a mood. He would throw a tantrum—there was really no other word for it. He'd throw a tantrum over the silliest things.
Harry nodded and grabbed his robes. He didn't know what the hell was going on, and something told him he didn't want to know.
Draco's voice was tinged with sleep and Harry couldn't help but find it adorable. Harry turned around, still wrapped in Draco's arms, and placed a small kiss on the corner of his mouth.
Harry awoke in much the same way as the previous morning. This time he didn't shy away from Draco, and snuggled closer to the warmth of his body instead. He felt arms tighten around him and a kiss placed into his hair.
Draco smirked and, with a flick of his wand and a whispered, “
My mother, informed by Harry, no doubt, was adamant that I needed to take care of myself and report it, but I placated her by telling her they had stopped. For a time, I thought they had. I hadn't received any for months and no longer needed to look over my shoulder when out and about.
What the fuck?
“No one else I wa— Um, will
“Have a great night,” Ginny said, kissing his cheek. “Go get him.”
When Draco called and cancelled plans with friends during training, they had all asked his the same question. Draco would always have the same answer. He had worked bloody hard, and of course it was bloody worth it. When he had earned his stripes and was out helping people, it would all be worth it.
Draco did know. The therapist his mother had made him visit had told him that his sudden penchant for brightly coloured plastic toys was due to longing for a childhood or something along those lines.
It was everything Harry had expected and more. The feel of Draco's lips on his own was electrifying; the gentleness gave way to passion, and Harry didn't want it to end. Wrapping his arms around Draco, Harry deepened the kiss and gave in when he felt himself being lowered to the ground. Had it been seconds...minutes...hours? Harry didn't know, and he really didn't care.
The dining room was the same as it was at lunch, with the tables set for two, with only Glinda and her staff the exception. That didn't worry Draco, though. He was used to eating with Harry, and for all his bad habits, his table manners were impeccable.
Harry rolled his eyes. Hermione was desperate for him to 'come out' as Joshua.
Oh, yeah. The Hermione 'this is your duty' speech. Why had he not expected it? It was the same thing every time. Harry loved Hermione, but she just didn't understand that Harry just didn't want to go to these boring Ministry events; he didn't like being gawped at like an elephant in the zoo.
The Minister for Magic, having worked with Muggles before, had started adapting a few Muggle ideas for the wizarding world. One of these was the Muggle tradition of placing a blue plaque on the wall of 'houses of interest'. With the new blue plaque attached beside his front door, Harry's house price had shot up and, unsurprisingly, so did the number of actual buyers.
Draco didn't want to make a big deal out of what Harry said because Harry seemed to be in a good mood, but he filed it away—seriously, what child didn't have toys?—to discuss at a later time and started over.
*  Draco would smile, nod, and, with his fingers crossed under his robe sleeves, promise not to 'antagonise, patronise, or in any way wind Potter up.'
Harry was very confused. What him? Who's looking? Did they know? How? “What the f—”
“Draco,” Malfoy said, holding his hand out. “Please, we're supposed to be grown-ups; I think we've proved that we're not the same people we were years ago.”
After agreeing to talk privately, Harry had reluctantly followed Arthur into the garden. He was worried. Arthur had always treated him like one of his sons, but he was fiercely protective of Ginny.  Not knowing what was going to happen, Harry steeled himself and accepted the invitation into Arthur's shed, closing the door behind him.
“It's hot as hell. Hermione, I don't want to hear a lecture about how 'it's fetishising gay people', okay?”
“Can't a wizard have any privacy, love?” Ron asked. “Leave him alone!”
“Good morning,” Draco said as he slipped into the seat beside Harry. “What's going on?”
“You, mainly.”
“I'm so sorry! You'd better go home and get your suit seen to,” Draco said. “You'd don't want it to ruin. You know spells won't help with wine stains.”
Harry laughed as he fixed Draco's drink. Draco always moaned about his job at the Ministry, but Harry knew full well how much he actually enjoyed it. Apparently, the Undersecretary to the Minister for Wizard-Muggle Relations was a thrilling job to have. Harry didn't think that he could cope with working with Hermione, but Draco seemed to love it.
“Are you coming in?” Harry asked as he opened the door to his room.
he was determined to make Draco know he wasn't copying someone else, and he didn't realise the mistake he was making till Draco stilled on his lap and turned to look him in the eyes.
“Okay. Here goes. I'm from the future.”
“When I fire-called that evening as planned, you were out. So I told him to let you know I was coming home for the weekend. He said he would.”
No couple was sitting next to each other. He was placed between Mouse and Frumpy, and Harry was between One and Beauty, all the way at the other end of the table. Looking down at his cutlery, Draco had a strange thought. He didn't
Harry groaned as cheers sounded all around him—including Ron's. People were leaning over each other to pat Harry on the back, and Harry gave Kingsley a look that he hoped showed his irritation. Kingsley must have taken the hint as he cleared his throat and once again called for silence.
“Backs!” Glinda cried. Harry and Draco ignored her.
“Fuck it,” Harry said with a sigh before raising his wand. “
Harry jumped when strong arms wrapped around him from behind, sending soapy bubbles flying all over the small kitchen. “Draco,” he said, relaxing immediately once he recognised the arms holding him. Harry flicked the wireless off and turned in Draco's arms, smiling as he looked at his boyfriend.
“We should go and get dressed for dinner,” Malfoy said, placing his empty glass down and standing up. “I don't particularly fancy dining in nothing but a towel. And I highly doubt anyone else would want to see that either.”
“For what?”
“Ah, I see,” Draco said although he most certainly did not.
“Um, did you want a coffee?”
Harry nodded, unsure if he should try and explain it.
. She just wanted to spend some time with her best friend. Was that too much to ask?
Harry had tried to explain that three weeks of Auror training did not an Auror make, but Draco was having none of it. Harry didn't know if it was because of the consumption of the bottle of champagne and the entire contents of his mini-bar, or if it was simply to shut Draco up, but he finally agreed. On one condition: Draco had to help.
The day I rounded a corner to see Potter and Weasley, of all people, defending a second year against the snide comments of their dipshit of a friend Finnegan, I knew something had changed. Something good.
Harry ignored him, instead focusing on helping Draco with his hand. He ran his wand over the small abrasions, healing them, before kissing each knuckle gently.
Once they were settled in the living room, Harry called Kreacher to get some plates and cutlery for Zach.
Draco was right. Each group was handed a map and a list of items they had to locate. Draco, naturally, assigned himself as the team leader, shouting down the other's objections with a swift, 'Which one of you is a fully trained Auror, then?'  It worked every time.
Pansy held up one finger, and finished reading the page, before looking up at Harry and Draco.
“New balls, please!” Draco called and Harry didn't know whether to laugh or smack him.
Harry broke away from Draco, smiling widely. “I'm kissing my boyfriend. What the hell does it look like I'm doing?”
“I know how to forge a letter; I just thought you'd want to stay and talk. Ah, here are some replies, I think.”
“Yes,” Draco said with a smile. “We're ready to go.”
Draco leaned over and kissed him. “I'll fire-call you all the time. I promise.”
Hermione felt sick. Had she really become
Potter moved closer, and as soon as he uttered, “Sorry,” my wand was out and the little cranes were fluttering around his head. I blushed harder. It was automatic; it was instinctive.
“Right you are; sorry.” Malfoy cleared his throat. “So you now know I'm me; can you lower your wand so I can start again?”
“You really don't know, do you?”
Everyone at the table gaped at Ginny and Theo. Draco silently pushed two more shots in their direction.
The first time you spoke first, I'll never forget. One word.
“You know, Malfoy,” he began, and I really didn't like the smug look on his face or the look of horror on Potter's. “You have spent an awful lot of time and energy on getting Harry undressed in the past few weeks. Even I can tell that you just want a good gawp, so why don't you just ask him out and save us all the drama?”
“Your supposedly intelligent Auror of a boyfriend panicked and fired a bloody powerful Protego at you, knocking you off your feet and banging your head.”
“No, Harry,” Draco said with a sigh. “I'd
“K'Nex? How the bloody hell do you know what K'Nex is, but you've never heard about sunscreen?”
“Now, I want each of you to go off with your partner—out of earshot if you'd prefer—and write something about yourself that the other person doesn't know. It doesn't have to be a secret, but it has to be something important to you. You will then share it with your partner. Remember, nothing you share here can be repeated outside of these grounds. After we've finished, your partner will burn your secret in the bin and, therefore, promise to keep it forever.”
The assembled crowd quietened immediately at the booming voice. He wasn't the official leader; they'd never actually held an election, but seniority prevailed, and Bob chaired the meetings. Official or not, not one of the group wanted to get on his bad side. One swipe of his enormous tentacles would send any one of them flying into the lake, regardless of whether they had wings, or the ability to swim. And Bob did not like to be interrupted. In fact, as many creatures had said—in quiet tones in darkened corridors out of Bob's earshot, of course—it would seem that Bob simply liked the sound of his own voice.
Ron finished by smiling brightly at Hermione. She smiled sweetly in return, but Harry could tell she hadn't missed Ron's slip.
who think that
.” Draco put a big fake smile on his face. He was fooling nobody. “We've been together for a while now. We were keeping it quiet, for obvious reasons, but then Harry thought it time for us to come clean.”
Harry could tell the woman thought she wouldn't be making a huge sale with him; the way she resolutely looked at her computer screen instead whenever Harry tried to make eye contact was clear enough, but her conversation with her colleague on '
Harry gratefully accepted the glass offered to him and sat back to listen to Malfoy talk. If nothing else, it was a bloody good wine.
“Oh, thank Merlin,” Trevor said, attempting a tiny fistbump with Crookshanks' paw (it didn't go well. Trevor was used to such things and carried on happily regardless). “If I had to listen to him moan and mope about those bloody plants and how they
“Ahem,” Neville interjected suddenly, “so was Hawkeye. Also someone without superpowers. Just him and his bow, if you'll recall.”
Draco smiled, nodded, and tried his best to think of an excuse to get out of the Golden Trio's re-bonding exercise.
“Huh?”
“No. I
Harry, obviously finished with the sparkles, came back into the room with a cup of tea and some biscuits. No dog biscuits, though. Dog definitely wanted Draco to come home soon. He hoped Draco had had a day from hell and was just looking for someone to take it out on. Dog pawed at the ribbon tied around his neck and barked at Harry. He deserved it.
“What are the fucking chances?” he asked, flopping his head onto his hands.
As he was finishing writing a note to one of his other employees, the bell above the shop door tinkled and Pansy breezed in.
Harry shrugged. “Panicked,” he said before dissolving into laughter himself.
Harry did, unfortunately, remember him. Six foot of gorgeous with perfectly coiffed hair. Pierre? Pedro? Something beginning with a P anyway. Harry looked down at himself: not even close to six foot and hair that looked like it had never seen a brush. Fuck.
Harry couldn’t wait any longer; he slid down the bed and buried his face between Draco’s arse cheeks.
“Pansy mentioned you liked the belt. Would you like it? Or I have a couple that are similar.”
. And it simply couldn't wait until later; once Harry had his mind set on something, it had to be done, preferably sooner rather than later.
“Come on,” Draco said, taking Harry by the arm and leading him towards the bar. “If we have to be here, we are not staying sober. Come on, Weasley. Let's leave the girls to it.”
Harry did as he was told, and sat up straighter, crossing his legs so Draco could perch opposite him.
“Oh, yes, you are!” Hermione countered. “People are expecting you. You need to be there. This is important. You are
You saw me and smiled and I was lost. I smiled back and one word tumbled out.
perfect excuse for his reaction to Harry and Malfoy. You see, he had assumed Draco was a dog.
“What?” Harry could feel the anger that had hidden itself for months bubbling to the surface. “I didn't fucking cheat. You left me. You wouldn't fucking listen!”
Tinsel. Shiny, sparkly, brilliant tinsel.
Harry let out an audible sigh of relief as the sound of police sirens filled the air, but didn't move back to the manager and the remaining guests. As the sirens got louder—and nearer—the attackers, after aiming a few last kicks at the whimpering man on the floor, ran off into the night.
, you've got a sequel to write.”
Draco baulked. He wasn't a virgin—far from it—but he wasn't expecting
Harry was exhausted by the time he'd finished his letter. Folding it carefully, Harry placed it into an envelope and put it on the hall table, next to the perch, ready for when his owl returned. He just hoped that Draco would read it. He had promised to go to the Burrow for dinner after work, so Harry ran up the stairs to shower and change. Hopefully he would be able to send it off before he left.
Harry's heart warmed as Draco as good as admitted that he was also nervous. Draco gestured to the barman for two more drinks, so Harry took the time to look around the small pub for an empty table. Harry had thought Draco would've booked a table somewhere with menus written in French and prissy waiters. Instead, they had met in a pub Harry was familiar with—it was the same one they usually met in to start off their Friday nights outs. Harry didn't know how to feel about that.
After a leisurely breakfast, a relaxing swim, and more than a couple of chaste snogs, Harry was feeling a lot better. He only had a couple of days left on his holiday, and he intended to enjoy each one of them. Draco had been—
“Because I'm thinking the same thing.”
Exploding juice at breakfast, that was a winner. Potter had had to take his jumper off right there in the Great Hall.
“I knew writing text books wasn't that lucrative. I didn't know what it was you were doing. I never imagined it was this! How could you keep this from me? I could have helped!”
Ron must have noticed as well as he smacked him in the arm. “What's up with you? Surely you've seen these two at it before? You got a problem with it?”
Seamus had come over from Ireland for a visit, and after being assured that a thirty-something divorced father of three wasn't going to look out of place, Harry allowed himself to be dragged to a club.
“Why don't you tell them that you knew I was coming home? How you told me that Harry had gone out and couldn't take my call?”
“It wasn't what it looked like!”
“I was just—”
“Why don't you want to like me?”
“Have you got a Floo I can use, please?”
“What?” I couldn't believe what Weasley was telling me. I couldn't believe someone I knew, someone I spoke to daily could try to kill me. I'd bought her flowers on her birthday for Merlin's sake.
“You two sit there and I'll explain everything.”
“Shit, okay. Wish me luck!” I called as I ran back out into the sweltering heat.
?” he said into Harry's ear.
According to Harry—and reiterated by Granger when she saw my disbelief—the Weasley family were equally pleased that Harry had found someone that made him smile. The Gryffindors tended to leave us alone if we spent time in the Gryffindor tower, which, to be honest, was most of the time, as Gryffindor House just did what they always had done: whatever Granger told them to.
As soon as Harry turned back to the boxes, Dog put his evil plan into action. Moving quicker than if Draco had appeared with a steak, Dog jumped at the tree. Taking a spiky branch in his mouth, Dog wriggled the heavy tree until it toppled over.
“Get pissed without me?” Harry offered.
“Really?”
for not reading the Prophet, so I had no idea what was going on, but from the look of absolute horror on Harry's face as he read the front page, I knew it wasn't going to be good.
Ginny was grumbling under her breath about twats taking liberties, and every couple of minutes stood up, raised her wand and promised to make sure that Zach never had the chance to climb into anybody else's bed. Harry was inclined to let her; Hermione wasn't.
This was supposed to be a short 1-2k PWP from a comment that Wendy made concerning nudist!Harry and Draco. Alas, it was not to be. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I enjoyed writing it.
As Draco finally appeared at the top of the stairs, the front door opened.
Of course, his letters were full of happiness and funny stories, but Hermione knew how well Harry could put on an act. Harry had Molly to feed him and look after his general welfare. She had mentioned in a few of her letters that she had had Harry and Draco—a 'lovely boy so well-mannered', according to Molly—over for dinner, but Harry had no one else. His relationship with Ginny had dissolved completely after the war, and Hermione couldn't see Harry going out and finding himself another girlfriend.
Draco breathed a sigh of relief. He
Hermione was no help at all. She was great at first, trying her best to talk to Draco, but she had finally told Harry—with many apologies—that it was affecting her working relationship with Draco, and that it couldn't continue any longer. As long as they were in Croatia, she wouldn't talk to Draco about anything but work.
An awkward silence followed Glinda's words. Her smile didn't falter, she simply twiddled her thumbs on her lap.
But appearances, as Draco had been repeatedly told, were deceptive. Beauty and Bear's elaborate vehicle lost a wheel halfway down the ramp. Giant and Mouse's enormous offering dropped their egg and was therefore disqualified. Ten and One's creation veered terribly to the right, crashing into the wall and causing another round of insults between the two. But Grumpy and Frumpy's car wasn't only well adorned, it was well-built. It flew down the ramp and drove straight for a good ten feet.
“Right,” Draco said, “squishy. But getting back to the matter at hand, I don't know what Ginny's talking about, to be honest. Your kissing was fine. Good. No problems at all.”
Sliding down off the sofa, Dog covered his eyes with his paws.
“But, but,” Harry spluttered, “what about Captain America?”
, had been the headline—Harry decided to look for a new house. As much as he had tried to make Grimmauld Place liveable again, it simply couldn't be done. Kreacher, surprisingly, had accepted the move easily. Harry thought that the fact that he was seeing a Malfoy had greased the wheels somewhat. As did the constant need for dusting. Harry had discovered that while a great cook, Kreacher disliked dusting with a passionate hatred usually reserved for clothes and SPEW.
Glinda sighed audibly.
“I didn't dislike Harry when we first met. I even bloody asked him to be my friend. Remember?” he added in Harry's direction.
I didn't, but I really didn't want to show myself up. Instead, I asked what I'd wondered since the beginning of term. “Why did you defend us? Why did you stand up for us against the others?”
“No, really,” Harry said, surprised at how calm he was, “which one are you?”
Darius scoffed.
me to apologise—I didn't need to—that he was putting the war behind him and that he'd see me in school.
would get me a copy. Pansy summoned one off a timid looking Ravenclaw and glanced at it quickly, a growl rising in her throat as she, too, moved towards the Hufflepuffs.
“Huh?”
Harry looked up to see Draco barely restraining laughter. “I don't want to shag you!” Harry said quickly.
“But we're going to need more wine,” Harry insisted, beckoning the waiter over.
“Never mind those two; have you seen the time?” Hermione said, pointing at the huge clock. “You're on now.”
“Ah, the dream. Wouldn't need you at all then.”
Theo and Ginny were off on their travels again, so the goodbyes took longer than usual, but eventually, a slightly tipsy Harry managed to get an equally tipsy Draco through the floo and back home.
“Sitting here, acting like nothing ever happened. It's bollocks. And we know it.”
She looked torn between hugging Harry and slapping him. .
It was quite funny—for us anyway—how people discovered that we were drinking together. You'd been talking about this big contract you'd gone for with the Ministry for ages. You'd been so nervous. It would've put your business on the map.
Harry didn't know what to do. He was pretty sure he should be ranting and fighting by now, but, if he was perfectly honest with himself, he just didn't want to. He was on holiday, the weather was glorious and he just couldn't get himself worked up enough to bother. He was well aware that he was naked, and he had been so sure that no one would have discovered his new-found love of naturism but he hadn't felt this peaceful in a long time. A quick glance at Malfoy showed that he too had a bemused look on his face. Harry made a decision.
Harry's hair had never looked so good. In the end, it had taken two bottles of the green goo and a rather drastic haircut, but the results were amazing. Instead of his usual 'wash and go' mop, he now sported a fetching 'shag and go' style. Harry liked it. Pansy had already promised to keep him supplied with the green goo.
Glinda looked slightly taken aback at the vehement response and Draco felt strangely guilty for it. “What's the problem?” she asked.
At the sight of a dripping wet—and bloody hell, Harry appreciated the view—Draco climbing out of the pool with a smirk on his face, Harry knew he hadn't.
“Of course not,” Draco said, smiling. “I'd be pretty offended if you didn't fancy me, to be honest.”
“Zach,” Harry spat, the pieces falling into place. “He was there that day. He must have taken it.”
Whimpering, Dog scampered back.
Harry enjoyed his lunch at Ron and Hermione's. Ginny and Neville popped in as well, and it turned into a nice, pleasant afternoon, with no—or very little—thoughts of Malfoy or his future self. Hermione explained—after berating Harry about running himself into the ground—that she was grateful that he had cried off the night before as it gave her the chance on catching up on some paperwork. Ron had blushed at this, and Harry had the distinct—and very much unwanted—thought that her idea of paperwork was much,
“No, not really. Well, yes, a little. Of what you might do to me.”
Then he'd be dead. Now I'm not saying he didn't save the world—”
This was my glomp for
Writing textbooks was simply gathering information and collating it into words that wouldn't bore children to tears. After all the research he had done with Ron and Hermione in school, it came easy to Harry, and he enjoyed the feeling that the kids in Hogwarts wouldn't be stuck with the terrible books he had had to study from.

“Hulk's a hulk.”
regions. He knew erections were frowned upon on the beach and was usually perfectly okay with that. Draco rubbing cream
“I'm sure you are all desperately hungry, so I'll make this short.”
“Yes, Weasley; I'm sure you have heard of it. I heard you and Brown made quite the spectacle.”
“Yes, well.”
” had them naked where they stood. “I'm perfectly happy where I am,” Draco said with a wink, leaning back against the door.
Draco laughed. “I didn't expect her to be. It isn't her I wanted to see.”
Flopping back down onto the pillow, Harry had flashes of what had actually occurred the previous night. Had Malfoy really claimed to have come from the future? And, Harry thought with a stomach-dropping feeling that had nothing to do with his hangover, had they actually
“It's all over,” Harry told him.
Harry was fuming. He needed to confront that bastard. There was no way—charity match or not—Malfoy was getting away with cheating him to the snitch. His broom had hardly ground to a halt when Harry jumped off, storming into the changing room.
If Harry had had a drink, Draco would have been showered with it. Harry wished he had; the bloody git would deserve it. To just come out with it like that? And how did he know, anyway? What should he do? Lie? Tell the truth? Run for the hills?
Since its inception, BAHAHAHAH had strived to maintain a semblance of peace at Hogwarts. Outside influences (that Voldie fellow that has people scared, for instance) and major conflicts (every member, especially Crookshanks, refused to get involved with Miss Granger and her crusade against house-elves) were out of their jurisdiction, but the day-to-day running of the school, that was the job they had undertaken for themselves.
“So,” Pansy began, “are you ever going to spill the beans on last night?”
After spending his formative years believing that divorce was the worst thing that could happen to a family, Harry was positively shocked to discover the opposite to be true. He was happier than ever; he felt free, as if a weight had been lifted off his chest. The family seemed happy too; no one seemed surprised by the news.
“Hello, Draco.”
And that was the problem. He couldn't tell anyone. Draco hadn't said that he couldn't shout it from the rooftops, but who the bloody hell would believe him? And Malfoy. Harry couldn't even imagine what he would feel about it.
Harry nodded and flopped back onto the bed.
Draco was about to speak up, when Harry pulled him over to their 'usual' seats.
tone that Harry found surprising.
“Away from prying eyes,” Draco said knowingly. He himself had hidden in the Muggle would after the war. It was when he'd started collecting his toys.
Bob's tentacles twitched. “Yes, well. I have faith in your abilities. I'll call another meeting to see how your plans are coming along later in the week. Now, on to other matters. Trevor—”
The trust exercises were one of the sessions that Draco had actually been looking forward to. He'd read about them before: Falling into your partner's arms? Guiding blindfolded partners through mazes? Blindfolded abseiling? Yes, yes, and not for all the Galleons in Gringotts. Not because of Harry—Draco simply wasn't a fan of going down the side of a cliff face with only a rope—no, he trusted Harry with his life, and they were going to show everybody exactly how it was done.
“Welcome,” the man said once everyone was seated. “I'm Barry, and I'll be leading this afternoon's session. In front of you is a Muggle building toy. The aim of this activity is simple: I want you to build a vehicle that will transport these—” Barry walked around the room, handing out eggs to each table. “—down that ramp and along the track.
“No one is to leave here from the moment the course officially starts until Monday, after you have completed the therapy. This is final, barring a medical emergency. You are all bound to follow the course as set out in your itinerary.”
“Did you fancy me?” Harry asked, suddenly very interested in the answer.
The meeting of BAHAHAHAH was in full swing by the time Hedwig and Darius had had enough of a break. Bob tutted and looked dreadfully close to tossing them into the lake when they landed right in front of him.
Harry was cold. He and Draco were huddled behind some bushes, outside the front of the hotel under Disillusionment Charms and Harry's Warming Charm had worn off some time ago. The Muggle policemen milling around made it impossible for him to renew the charm, so Harry simply sidled ever so closer to Draco to steal his warmth.
“Watch your paws,” Harry said quickly, picking Dog up and plopping him on the sofa. “I'll clean this up. Merlin, Draco is going to kill me.”
Zach smiled. “Whenever you are. Hey, can I stay here tonight? I don't fancy going all the way back home.”
“Gorgeous,” Harry repeated, his eyes not leaving Draco's waist. Draco
Draco jumped to his feet and shouted, “I'm gay!”
Draco/Harry, Ron/Hermione
Well, that was certainly how Potter seemed to think of Draco. Draco was incredibly annoyed with Potter on almost a daily basis, but he was tired of fighting all the time. He only wished that Potter could see past their teenage years.
“Dad, Dad! What do you think, Dad?” Lily asked, twirling in front of him. “Good enough?”
“I think I'll put the tinsel on this year. Nice and bright to go with the rest.”
Harry needed more. The feel of Draco's cock inside him, the feel of Draco's fingers digging into his skin. It wasn't enough. He wanted Draco deeper. Harder, faster. Harry pushed himself back as Draco picked up speed. Yes, yes!
I was not ready for the crowds to part for an extremely calm looking Potter to pass. I wasn't ready for Potter to hold his hand out to shake mine with a smile on his face. And I definitely wasn't ready for him to shake my hand, pat me on the shoulder and say, 'Good game, Draco,' before leaving towards the showers.
“I wouldn't mind going to the bar.”
“Harry! What are you doing here? You're supposed to be at work.”
“This morning,” Glinda continued, “will be quite quiet. There's only the one session, then the rest of the morning is yours to spend as you please. Enjoy the rest of your breakfast.”
As they neared the braying group, Harry had to stifle a gasp as he recognised the man lying in a heap. Grumpy Waiter seemed to be trying to protect his face and Harry winced as he caught sight the blood seeping out of his nose. The crowd were jeering at him and Harry had to resist the urge to hex every one stood around the poor man. From the way Draco was growling under his breath, Harry knew he was also struggling. What the fuck should they do?
“Not here, Harry me lad,” Tom called back. “Owled me earlier, Ron did, asking me to keep the usual table for you lot. And to make sure you had a drink the second you got in. On account of it being your birthday an' all.”
“I've had them ages,” Malfoy said, reaching for another Rich Tea. “Do you like them?”
I got my chance on the day of the Slytherin-Gryffindor match. Potter, of course, was seeker for Gryffindor and I couldn't wait to face him. I'd played a lot since returning to school, but I wasn't at my best. I hadn't exactly been practising over the past year, but I suppose Potter had been otherwise occupied as well.
Harry nodded. He would have bet his house on Draco pulling out a pack of his beloved biscuits.
to get to that ball. Harry ignored his team mates' shouts of encouragement as he concentrated on nothing but the Snitch and the man on the broom beside him, also flying expertly towards their shared goal.
A bell chimed suddenly, startling the group. “Ah, I apologise,” Glinda said with a glance at her pocket watch. “We will have to continue this tomorrow, during your private session. Thank you all for joining in today. I think we know what we have to do from here. Now, time for a tea break.”
Harry was suddenly very relieved he hadn't ruffled her hair. Gerald was a hairdresser—a bloody good one, according to Harry's very nearly husband—and Ginny's boyfriend of the last six months. It was actually Draco who had introduced the two of them. The easiness between all of them was a far cry from the awkwardness from a couple of years before.
As Harry closed the door on the final customer of the day, he looked around and smiled. Harry didn't think his life could get any better. He had his café, his friends, a brilliant boyfriend and now his new house. What more could he want?
“Good morning!” Glinda said, much too cheery for first thing in the morning. “I hope you're both well.”
Eventually, and entirely too late, Kingsley's eyes dropped to his desk as he shook his head.
In answer, Harry leaned in and kissed Draco again. Draco curled his hand around Harry's jaw and Harry couldn't think of anywhere he'd rather be.
knocked his full glass of wine over the table. The red wine splashed right down the front of Zach's suit.
It wasn't just bad; it was terrible. Draco knew his mouth was on the large side, so he was mystified as to how Harry consistently missed it. Draco tried to wipe his mouth between almost-mouthfuls, but he had to remember to feed Harry as well and Draco knew he probably had bolognese all over his face.
“Yes.”
? Why did you come
It had been Al's birthday party. Ginny was away, so Harry had offered to host it at his house. Of course, had he known that he'd be stuck with a houseful of rowdy teenage boys, shouting and generally making a mess, he might have taken up Molly's offer of having it at the Burrow.
Harry spent the rest of the day in a daze. He was too late. He'd spent too long—literally—fucking around with Draco, and he'd lost his chance with Malfoy. Harry wanted to smack himself. He wished he had Draco's time travel whatever-it-was so he could go back and fix the whole big mess.
“Harry,” Hermione said, squeezing his hand again, “don't look so scared. I know it must have been difficult to tell me that and I apologise. I wasn't laughing at your... declaration.”
Lunch was a quiet affair for Harry and Draco. They had decided against eating outside, with Draco pleading too much sun for one day. Even with the lotion—and the reapplication that Harry insisted upon after an hour—Draco could feel his skin was a little tight and his nose was red.
mind. He just had to think of something to say. Ignoring the looks of shock on his friends' faces, Harry walked onto the stage.
Harry grinned at the sight of his boyfriend in the doorway, before realisation dawned on him. Horror crept up his spine as he looked down at the bed beside him. Blond hair was all that he could see poking out of the duvet, but it definitely wasn't Draco's hair. Especially as Draco was standing in front of him.
I hadn't slept well, and it showed. Even my mother, who, despite not leaving the house for years, still looked beautiful every day, winced at the sight of me over an unconsumed breakfast. I looked around desperately for Harry, one of my friends or even Helen. I needed someone to speak to; I needed someone to find Harry for me.
“Imagine the drains,” Harry said with a shudder when they were out of earshot.
If anyone knew the ins and outs of who attended school with them, it was Pansy,
—that might have caused a problem.
Professor Flitwick must have read my mind, as the very next class after I'd concocted my plan gave me the very opportunity I'd been looking for to put the plan into action.
“Me too.” Draco had a sudden thought, and not knowing when he would get the chance again, rolled with it. “New question: when did you come out? And why wasn't it plastered all over the Prophet?”
Harry looked aghast as he read. “I've never...I don't hate you. My turn,” he said quietly.
“No,” Pansy replied with a pout. “It’s weird. Usually he Fire-calls me when he gets home after a date.”
“Hedwig?”
“That's for one week. On the sole condition that I tell her every sordid detail. But that's beside the point. How is it a holiday if you have to work? Will you at least be home at the weekends?”
“He really didn’t tell you anything?” he finally asked her.
~ ~ ~
Scoffs and laughs echoed around the group, many not believing what they were hearing. It had to be a joke. It was impossible. Darius thought there was more chance of Mr Malfoy taking tea with Mrs Weasley at the Burrow.
to see that film. Draco, had not particularly given a shit what they saw—he had just wanted to see some stuff blowing up—agreed. Big mistake.
yet; their talk had mainly been about the problems at their hotel.
Two, Malfoy had called him Harry. They had both tried out using first names, but both agreed that it didn't work. They were Malfoy and Potter, always had been and always would be.
Harry quickly ran over to Draco, trying to touch him, but Draco kept moving backwards.
“You know that's not what I meant,” Harry said, elbowing him in the ribs. “I just really,
Huh? Were they that obvious?
Harry blushed more than he had thought possible and hid his head in his hands. “It was early. I had a hangover. The bed is so comfy,” he mumbled.
“Ah, Harry and Draco. You're late; having a little too much fun in your room?” Glinda—and Draco decided he didn't like her much anymore—winked at them, and their fellow guests laughed.
, he's dropped his wand in shock. Malfoy, in turn, obviously startled by Harry's unexpected appearance, had stunned him. By the time Harry came to, Malfoy was talking to Aurors who soon left after establishing what had happened and if Harry was all right.
For the first time since he'd started work at the hospital, Harry was nervous about going into work on Monday morning. The rest of his weekend had passed without incident. He'd had a lovely day at Molly and Arthur's on Sunday with the rest of the family, having one of Molly's huge Sunday dinners. She'd quizzed him, as she did every week, on when he was going to find himself a 'young man and settle down'. Molly assured him, as she did every week, that if Ginny could do it, so could he.
any longer...”
“Thanks, Captain Obvious; I hadn't realised.”
“I'm just going to say it and hope I don't sound like an idiot.”
Harry didn't know quite what to say. Malfoy seemed to be acting as if nothing had happened. “So, um, you, um, you haven't see me all weekend? And where are your glasses?”
It was a magnificent morning, with the sun shining high and bright. There was barely a whisper of wind and all around people talked of nothing but the heat while fanning themselves with the neat little leaflets I'd had printed to accompany the presentation.
“Of course I did! I tried everything to be an Auror. I did all the training; I passed all the tests. I threw my life into getting into the force. And then you were there, throwing insults at me and belittling me at every opportunity. What was I supposed to do?”
He hadn't caught it. Harry was dumbstruck.
At first, it had been easy to ignore Potter's attentions, but I had noticed my reactions had shifted. For example, when I'd try to paste my usual smirk on my face when Potter said hello to me in the hallway, and I'd sometimes simply forget and smile back. Or when I'd laugh accidentally at one of his stories in Charms. I'd cover it up, of course, by making a good snide comment about one of his friends.
It turned out to be one of the nicest mornings Harry had had in a while. After the four of them had ironed out the 'small misunderstanding', Harry was grateful to just have his friends back.
I'm just doing this for Teddy. I feel a bit daft, to be honest. But here goes...
Harry didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Ron simply sat opposite him with a look of utter shock on his face; the corners of his mouth were twitching but he obviously knew better than to laugh at his girlfriend.
It took Harry a second to realise he had his hands held uselessly at his side and he nervously started to slide them up Draco's arms. As the kiss deepened, Harry's hands slid around Draco's back, only for Draco to break away suddenly. Harry jumped back, an apology on the tip of his tongue.
“You know what to do with this stuff?” Harry asked Draco quietly.
Draco thought that Harry had cheated on him. And it pissed Harry off. After his third failed visit to Croatia, Harry decided something: enough was enough. He had tried everything he could. His friends had tried everything they could. If Draco couldn't—wouldn't—listen, then Harry was giving up.
Darius shot her a baleful glare. She was ruining his big moment.
Harry liked to think that he had a lot of friends, and that he would be fine without Ron and Hermione, but the fact was that it wasn't the case. He certainly had a lot of acquaintances—part of the reason why he liked Draco's company was to stop any Tom, Dick, or Wilfred sitting down at his table—but none of his real friends lived nearby. They were living in Australia, teaching at Hogwarts or looking after their nana in Ireland.
“I have some gossip for you,” Draco said casually, taking the steaming mug from Harry and taking a sip. “Apparently, the great Harry Potter is cheating on his gorgeous, rich, well-endowed boyfriend.”
Draco couldn't even think Harry's surname. It was Harry or nothing—or was it? “Git!” he shouted loudly. “Sorry,” he said, “just testing.”
—Ginny had become Draco Malfoy's biggest fan, but after listening to her passionately defending him and telling them how he alone had made Harry truly happy again, he thought he might have made a mistake.
“Ah, I take it you've seen the paper.”
perfect—excuse for his reaction to seeing Harry and Draco on his doorstep, standing so close together that you couldn't get a knut between them.
Harry crossed the room in two strides before engulfing her in a hug. “No, I'm good,” he said. “Let's go get me married.”
Oh, wow. I was just looking through the desk for last year's Christmas cards (Don't judge; I know I should have just sent them last year, but I forgot. They might as well get sent this year. Hermione would be pleased; I'm saving paper) and I found this letter. It's a bit embarrassing, actually. I was such a soppy so and so this time last year. I'm glad I've found it and not anybody else!
Harry noticed the slight blush colouring Draco's cheeks and was sure his own were a matching colour.
I didn't have a clue what he was playing at. Unless it was his evil plan to turn me into a blubbering buffoon who talked about his toilet habits in public, in which case he'd succeeded.
“Of course! And he's just like one of us. He's our age, actually.”
“Yes?”
Hedwig and Darius nodded and took flight. They hadn't got far when they almost fell out of the sky at what they saw. Arnold was running across the grounds as fast as his tiny legs could carry him. The poor little mite looked about ready to drop.
But Harry couldn't get away from him. He was used to seeing Malfoy when they opened or closed their shops, he ran into him at lunch time in the local café, and he was never surprised to find himself sitting at the table next to Malfoy in the pub if he popped in for a pint on the way home.
Harry almost fell off his stool as Pansy stormed into work, slamming the door behind her and throwing her handbag at him.
“Malfoy!” Harry shouted, stomping towards the shower, ripping his gloves off as he walked. He wanted to strangle Malfoy, and his gloves would only get in the way.
A chat over lunch easily turned into a few drinks after work and eventually turned into a regular night out with their extended group of friends. Harry definitely counted his fellow Healer as one of his closest friends. A friend he still called by his surname, but a friend nonetheless.
“Bloody hell,” Draco exclaimed. “It's worse than we thought. They're attacking people now? Are you still up for the plan?”
Draco couldn't believe what a good night he'd had. He'd enjoyed a lovely meal, good conversation and he'd danced stupid dances with Harry until his feet felt like they were going to fall off. He'd had enough, though, and was feeling quite tired. He caught hold of Harry's hand as he moved towards the waiters and pulled him back.
Fumbling with the key, Harry finally got the door open and practically threw Draco inside. And stopped.
Pansy nodded. “I'm sorry, Harry. I promised him. He's still my friend.”
“And what a pretty dress it is,” Ron said, twirling her. Having his own little girl had brought out the best in Ron. Now he was as comfortable with ribbons as he was with broomsticks.
Draco's stomach answered for him, rumbling loudly. Harry laughed and went to dish up the food.
“Turn around,” Malfoy said, an enticing harshness to his voice that Harry couldn't—
Harry was pulled screaming out of his thoughts by the blinding pain that started in his groin and spread throughout his body. Giggly Girl number one had obviously taken offence at being beaten so soundly and hurled a ball in frustration straight at the celebrating pair. Harry hadn't seen the ball coming towards his, well, balls and thus had not been able to avoid the searing pain of a tennis ball hitting him squarely in the groin.
“Yes, well. Doesn't mean she didn't notice you were hot.”
Hermione had a calculating look on her face and Ron simply looked confused. Harry laughed and stood on his tiptoes to survey the crowd. Spotting the object of his search, Harry beckoned Draco over.
The second day, I woke late. Why Blaise didn't wake me, I'll never know, but I had ten minutes to make the choice between facing the stares at breakfast or face Charms on an empty stomach. Walking into the common room, my mind was made up immediately.
It took a few seconds before we both realised the silence that had fallen around us. Almost every witch and wizard in the vicinity were openly gaping, and Ron looked incredibly confused.
Which was how Harry found himself lying in the sun—albeit on their favourite lounger—waiting for Draco to finish getting his frustrations out with a swim. Maybe Draco would forget about last night in his anger?
help.
After a melee of hugs, handshakes and fist bumps, Harry and Draco were finally seated with a pint each, ready for a night that would inevitably include too much alcohol and embarrassing stories.
“You cover your skin with this—”
Harry woke up the next morning with a fuzzy mouth, a pounding head and the nagging thought that something weird had happened the night before. It took him a minute to remember that his hangover wasn't from a night out down the pub, but rather from Malfoy's unannounced turning up with wine. Bastard. He knew damn well that Harry and wine didn't mix well.
From the moment Harry had come running into his shop, waving a note in his hand and happily proclaiming that his fears were unfounded, Draco had thought that he'd had Weasley wrong.
“Are you ready to order, Sirs?”
Harry swivelled his chair around and pulled Draco down onto his lap. “Take my mind off Goblin Wars of the 1500s?”
Harry grinned at her, shouted goodbye to her and Hermione and dragged Draco towards the door. He had a
“I'm getting there; calm down. We arrived at the Ministry—with full back up; the Saviour insisted—just as Smith emerged from an alley, wand drawn. He did manage to shoot off the spell, but Watts managed to tackle him to the ground at the same moment, causing the spell to veer off course.”
“Not expecting to lose. How typical of you.” Malfoy's fingertips gently teased Harry's hole and Harry pushed down, trying to get more. “Luckily for you, I did come prepared.”
“What is it, Boss?” Hedwig knew that while he grumbled at the use of the nickname, Bob secretly loved it. “I haven't heard of any urgent matters.”
Harry forced himself to return Malfoy's smile before running into the bathroom. He felt the need to throw up. Of course he should feel guilty, he berated himself. What the fuck was he doing, running about with some future man and probably ruining any chance he ever had with the man he—realising it to be the truth—actually wanted? How did he ever think that it was a good idea?
“When do you leave?” Harry asked, forcing a smile.
Harry didn't know why he was surprised that his two best friends had obviously conspired to bring him and Draco together. He didn't want to think too much about it; he still wasn't sure he was staying.
Draco didn't understand, but he nodded anyway and gestured outside. “Swim?”
“About what?” Draco asked, genuinely confused. Harry was always doing that, starting a conversation as if Draco had the first clue what he was on about.
“Are you ready, yet?” Harry called up the stairs.
They were obviously romantically involved, if the holding hands and small glances were any indication. And when One smiled at Ten, Draco could see how happy they were. He couldn't figure out what the hell they were doing at the retreat.
“This isn't funny.”
“What?” Harry asked quickly. He was glad he didn't have a drink at this point as it would now be tipped into his lap. Beer and cocks did not mix. Unless...
He knew that it was the same for Potter. On more occasions than Draco could count, Potter had slid in to save him from a stray spell or projectile.
“Harry,” Draco said, pushing his plate away, “are we going to talk before therapy?”
It was actually Ron who finally persuaded him that it was about time he found himself a girlfriend. Well, Ron, being Ron, didn't quite put it like that. It was more along the lines of: 'you can't keep slumming about our place in the evenings; we need some space'.
“Bed?”
Secondly, Harry himself was a mess. He walked around in a daze, not knowing what to think. He felt physically and mentally drained. His mind cycled between embarrassed, confused and just outright hurt.
As Tilly banished the fifth mountain of balled up, scribbled on parchment—I could swear I saw her roll her big, bulbous eyes as she did so—I realised that I couldn't write down what I needed to say to you. I wanted to speak to you in person.
Draco smiled and put the glass of bubbly in Harry's hand. “Of course not!” he said, initiating a toast. “I have no interest in giggling girls, but I do have an interest in fine champagne. Drink up!”
Harry asked himself.
“Darius, you take Arnold to Draco. Just keep an eye on him and listen for anything that may be useful. Both of you. See if you can find out what the bloody hell has happened with them this week.”
Hermione and Draco, party planners extraordinaire, had Pansy's birthday bash sorted before they'd even finished their first cuppa. Harry was extremely happy that he had shown up. He only had to sort out the catering. Blaise, the poor bastard, was tasked with the unappetising job of escorting Pansy's overbearing mother.
“It's as busy as ever,” Harry said, accepting the glass of wine Draco had poured for him. “The old ladies are still rather Hufflepufferish. How's your mother?”
had simply pushed it to the back of his mind.
It pained him to admit it, but Draco knew that there
“Do you want him back?”
“Harry. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.” Draco shifted his chair closer to Harry's and took his hand. “We're going to be gone for six months.”
Harry huffed and puffed until he had the tree back in its original position. “There,” he said, ruffling Dog's ears. “Leave it alone.”
cock it was, then quickly remembered the holiday, the champagne and The Plan. The fact that both he and Draco were fully clothed helped his racing heart calm down considerably.
“We'll do the decorating stuff again,” Harry said. “Apparently, I haven't spent enough time with my boyfriend recently.” Harry winked at Draco. “And Zach? Don't forget to owl the
After one such lesson—and a run down of the inner workings of the Gryffindor boys' dorm habits—I tried to quickly gather my things and leave, when it all came to a head with Potter. I'd spent the lesson being as polite as I could, but he just wouldn't shut up. Before I could escape, though, the git had the bloody nerve to ask if I was going straight to the Great Hall for dinner as we, and I quote, 'Might as well walk down together'.
What the actual fuck was he playing at?
“There it is,” Draco said, and Harry could
spent the weekend with you, of course.”
Harry didn't know what to say. Confused, he simply gaped at Draco and gestured for him to continue.
As Harry slid his hand into position, Draco smiled. “Perfect,” he said, before yawning loudly. “Sorry; I'm just going to close my eyes for a minute before we go down; it's been a long day.”
Once they were both seated and been served with fresh drinks Harry thought for something to say to start the conversation. What did one say to a person they went to school with, had never seen eye to eye with, and hadn't actually seen for three years? Harry refused to think about the fact that he was also naked.
“From the way Draco looked when I saw him,” Pansy said with a cheeky smile, “I don’t think you said the same to him.”
“To Draco!” Ron called, lifting his pint in a toast. “May he have a quiet night,” he added with a solemn nod.
They both stopped talking as they realised what they had said and Harry found himself inexplicably bursting into laughter. Malfoy soon followed.
of time thinking about you. He blamed you for ruining his life. Without his NEWTs, he struggled to find a job, and then you and Harry become the Golden Boys and no one wanted to listen to his little rants any longer. The letters all traced back to him. He met Helen in her local one night and he developed his plan.”
“No.”
Ron raised his glass. “Merlin bless, Joshua Starkweather!”
“By kissing me?”
If Harry had had to guess who it could have been crashing about, Malfoy would have been right at the bottom of the list. But there he was, sitting at Harry's kitchen table, drinking Harry's tea and, worse of all, eating Harry's Rich Tea biscuits. He'd been bloody saving them!
Harry couldn't agree more with his best friend. “You have been working too much.”
After they'd eaten, and Harry had once again cleared up, Harry pulled Draco close to him. “Do the honours?”
Harry woke to a fuzzy head and an empty bed. He never liked waking up on his own, and had been hoping for a round of morning sex. As he felt Draco's side of the bed and realised it was cold, Harry remembered what had transpired the previous night.
Malfoy had decided to become a Healer.
“Know what?” I was well past embarrassment and well on the way to irritation. I just wanted to get out of that dusty room.
“Malfoy!” “Draco!” “TMI!” was shouted from multiple directions.
“My house,” Harry said, quickly holding his hand up and fighting down a blush as Draco raised an eyebrow at his words. “No. I’ll cook.”
Hedwig and Darius breathed a sigh of relief. Bob looked doubtful, which meant they were probably off the hook.
—wrote about their 'true love' and how it had conquered all. Harry was very surprised to walk into the café one morning to see
As Harry opened the shop, and wondered whether Pansy would turn up today—it was a Monday, after all—Harry was startled by the tinkle of the bell above the door. It was too early for customers—the
“Fuck it. You only live once. Twice. Three times. Whatever.” Harry pocketed the brochure and grabbed his coat. It was time to book a holiday.
“Shut up,” Malfoy said, before leaning down to kiss him gently.
“On your first date? I was only joking earlier! Really?”
Draco shook his head. “No, I'm just here until tomorrow. I had to make some reports in person. I have to close up the Zagreb stuff before I move on.”
Dog couldn't resist it. As soon as Harry stood back to admire his handiwork, Dog carefully took the trailing end of the ribbon and ran around the tree, unravelling it. By the time he was done, Dog was wrapped up neater than one of Draco's presents.
. Harry seized his opportunity when Malfoy paused to open another bottle to get a word in.
Harry furrowed his brow in confusion. Forgiven him? For what?
There was only one small blip in the execution of the plan. I originally found a very complicated Trip Jinx that would activate whenever Potter came within two feet of me in the hallways. I was so pleased with myself and couldn't wait to see it in action. Of course, Potter being Potter, nothing went to plan.
missing this.”
where I used to have my breakfast. But it was expected—demanded—of us to follow in the footsteps of our parents. And tough shit if you didn't like it. They were bad guys first and our parents second, as they weren't adverse to a little torturing to get what they wanted. My mother—and Pansy's—did try to protect us, but the bastards didn't mind hurting children, so they didn't think for a second before hurting anyone else.
Harry panicked and ran over to the fireplace, reverently picking the blasted penguin up. “Nope,” he said, putting it back in its box. “You're right, boy. That penguin is no fun.”
Stepping forward, Draco minutely adjusted Harry's bow tie and kissed him quickly on the lips.
“But, anyway, congratulations on becoming the new Boy-Who-Lived. I should warn you; it's a pain the arse.”
A few other members echoed Hedwig's words. Bob silenced them with one small swish of a tentacle.
I'd spoken up at her trial and told the world that I wouldn't have succeeded in killing that noseless bastard without her. Despite this, people ignored her and shunned her in the streets and I didn't like it, but I didn't know how to fix it.
Harry shuddered. “Yeah, no. I'm not scared of her... breasts. It's more like I...”
Dog resisted the urge to rub his paws together in glee as Harry wrestled the fake tree from its box. He sat on his haunches to stop himself from joining in as Harry attempted to assemble the bloody thing.  He needed to be patient. He knew exactly how Draco liked his sparkles and he was going to make damn sure Harry did it wrong.
“Hermione?”
At eight o’clock, Harry Apparated to the entrance of Diagon Alley and took a slow walk to the café. As he neared the shop, his heart started beating fast—the front door was wide open. Drawing his wand, Harry carefully entered the open door.
“Can you fetch Master Harry's wine?”
Harry scoffed. “Bit late for that.”
Darius cleared his throat. There was nothing that had been handed to the two of them that they hadn't cleared up promptly, or at least delegated to someone who could. “Excuse me?” he asked in a manner reminiscent of his owner. “What are you implying? Are you questioning my—” Hedwig pushed him again. “—our abilities?” he finished without skipping a beat. Draco would be proud.
By the time they'd reached the end of the second bottle, Harry and Hermione had migrated to the sofa and Harry felt a lot more relaxed. So, he was at least bisexual, maybe gay; he didn't know for sure. After the blush-inducing recounting of his trip to the club with Seamus, Hermione patted Harry's knee and told him she'd be there for him. She just told him that he needed to talk to Ginny and the children before he started dating, but assured him that no one would be upset by his news.
At the sound of the doorbell, Ron jumped up to answer the door. He and Hermione were still staying with Harry; they had been looking for a place of their own, but hadn't had any luck. The group fell silent, and Harry turned to see the reason why.
Zach looked flustered for a second before he plastered a grin on his face and handed Harry a piece of paper. “The address. I'll Apparate myself, then,” he said before turning and walking straight back out of the door.
of them.
“That
“Is there anything you'd like to discuss before you leave?”
“It was great,” Draco said, trying to decide between the chicken al fredo and the mushroom gnocchi. “Iron Man was bloody brilliant. He's got to be my favourite. I wouldn't mind seeing it again. We'll have to see if the gang would be up for it.”
Harry was sitting at the counter in the café, trying his best to work on the rota for the next week. His mind hadn't been on his job properly, and it was starting to show. He had three waitresses turning up at the same time, and he even had some days when it was just himself working. Pansy had threatened him—with castration, among other things—so he had finally decided to pull his head out of his arse and sort it out.
“Says who?”
“Draco,” Harry said, shock clear in his voice. “What's the matter?”
Draco nodded and held on to Harry tighter. Harry laughed.
No wonder Arnold fainted. Hedwig herself nearly fell off her perch, Darius' wing the only thing stopping her.
The pub was packed by the time Harry and Draco arrived. Harry couldn't see any of their friends.
As much as he was proud of his sales, Harry was slightly worried about what Draco would think of his other job. Draco had mellowed incredibly since they were in school, and wasn't so high and mighty, but he still had an air of pride about him. Finding out his boyfriend wasn't just the respectable author of history textbooks, but peddler of what was basically porn—he might find that difficult to stomach. And that wasn't taking into account that it was
“Ready to go?” Harry asked, bringing Draco out of his happy thoughts. “I still have to pack before the last session. And then we can go home!”
Harry winced. He dreaded to think what Ginny could come up with for her 'big one', but the thought of Molly fussing over him made him grimace. He loved Molly, but she was a force to be reckoned with. She'd been bad enough at his first wedding. As nice as it was to have someone mother him—and he did love it—he was nervous enough without her making it worse.
“Oh, for fuck's sake,” Harry said.
“Morning breath,” Draco whispered.
“Piss off,” he said, laughing.
A very elaborate spell that cause Potter's robes to appear invisible only to himself was a favourite. Watching Potter walking around with all of his robes on at once was hilarious. I could hear him moaning about his robes to his rather confused friends until Granger figured out what was wrong and cancelled the spell.
Hedwig hit him with her wing. “I know, but we need someone to keep an eye on him while we figure something out. Do you have a better idea?”
be needing to look his best. Draco would more than likely want to go somewhere upmarket and Harry didn't want to be feeling out of place. And his own delivery of green goo hadn't arrived yet.
“Sign in, and weigh your wand, and then you can get to wherever it is you're in such a rush to be. It's not as if you're the Minister.”
It all made for a, quite frankly, amazing final year of school. We studied, socialised, played Quidditch and generally enjoyed ourselves and it wasn't long before we were saying goodbye to the castle for the very last time.
Harry couldn't help it. He laughed and hugged him.
“I need a drink.”
“Is there someone else?”
“Because of the tests; were you even listening?”
“Well—” Ginny blushed slightly before straightening her shoulders. “—they're, for lack of a better word, porn. More specifically, gay porn. And quite graphic. Hence, Mum wondering if I knew what felching was.”
“Oh, put your tongue back in, Harry.” Pansy laughed as she put on her apron. “Not like that. You know that I'm not Draco's type.”
company.
“Harry—”
“Oh, shut up, Darius. I think you two,” Hedwig said, pointing with her wing at Pig and Arnold, “should continue the observation while me and Darius—”
Harry decided to walk home from the hospital. Leaving Malfoy at the fireplaces, Harry stepped out into the cool early-evening air. He needed to clear his head.
The group had run out of ideas, so, after a hastily thrown together lunch, had fallen back on the usual plan: getting pissed. Harry couldn't see how it could help; Ron had insisted that it couldn't hurt.
Every time Harry saw an owl, his face lifted, expecting to see a reply from Draco tied to its leg. Every time someone walked into the shop, Harry looked up, expecting it to be Draco. Every time Ron came home, Harry jumped up from his chair, expecting to see Draco walking through the front door. It was to no avail.
Harry almost laughed at that. “No. There is no one but you, Draco Malfoy.”
article.
Harry sighed as he reached for his beer. He was starting to think inviting his best friends out for a drink was a bad idea. He had only wanted to tell them that he had booked a holiday, and to not expect any mail from him for a while. Instead he found himself stuck in a corner of the Leaky—
“Sorry, mate,” Ron said gravely. “We're here for the night. we've been threatened—told—to keep you here by any means necessary.”
A small house-elf popped up and forced cups into each of their hands. “Sirs be wanting milk and sugar?”
Their first attempt was pathetic. The wheels fell off as soon as Harry placed the egg on top, which caused the whole car to fall to pieces. For all his bravado, Draco had never actually built anything with wheels before, and Harry was simply useless.
. He let Malfoy's wet fingers undo all the annoying little buttons on his soaked through Quidditch kit. He let Malfoy strip him completely. He didn't care as his wand clattered to the floor. He certainly didn't care when his pants joined it and Malfoy's hand wrapped around his rapidly hardening cock.
“I don't know. I think so. Maybe. Anyway, what's it to do with you?”
~ ~ ~
I didn't end up going out. You cancelled and then Ron and Hermione cancelled, which made Pansy cancel and then I just couldn't be arsed. Had a rousing game of cards with Mother instead. Don't cancel again.
Harry was so focused on Draco's upper body, that he had nearly missed the part he had been most looking forward to. Draco had obviously taken off his shoes and socks—that must have been when the arms had been flexing, he thought with a happy sigh—as he was now unbuckling his belt.
Darius turned on the poor toad, his wings edging closer to the toad's neck.
Harry's eyes widened and he couldn't help but grab Draco and kiss him hard. After all, it isn't every day your boyfriend
Weasley glared at Harry and he shut up. “As I was saying, you were brought straight here after...afterwards. We didn't know if you were hit, or why you'd gone down. It all happened so fast. Anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself,” he said, taking a seat. “Let's start at the beginning.
As I hid out in the abandoned, dusty room, my mind whirred as I thought about what Weasley had said—had
As she walked off, Draco looked into Harry's eyes. Maybe Glinda had a point. Picking up the pen, Draco wrote.
“Enough!” he bellowed, effectively shutting everybody up. “Hedwig. Find Mr Potter; keep him away from Mr Malfoy, please. I assume your plans are still in place?” Hedwig and Darius shared a look and nodded as one. “I'll organise a meeting in a few days to see what progress you've made. Darius, go to Mr Malfoy. The rest of you, stay and we'll hear about your own cases.”

him. I just wanted to stop feeling like I needed to smile when I saw him.
“Don't worry,” Harry said, earnestly. “I haven't heard them. I was going to suggest Scorpius stay for the night.”
“Just say it; whatever it is.” Harry bit into a Rich Tea, starting to feel a little annoyed at his friend.

Harry thought he would be more nervous as they entered the house, but he wasn’t. He would’ve blamed his new-found confidence on the alcohol, but he knew it wasn’t true. He and Draco had simply clicked, and Harry couldn’t wait to find out exactly how
It was Neville that had had given him an idea on how to fix it. Well, an idea to get Harry and Draco to spend more time together; it would take more than Harry to fix Croatia's problems. Harry had decided to ask Pansy to look after the café for a week, and he was hoping that Draco would take a week off fixing the world's problems.
. “No...” he said, his mind whirring, “he wouldn't.”
“Ta-da!” Harry said with a flourish once Draco clipped the last piece into place.
“Yes, and you live with that elf with the weird name. Next.”
“What are you doing here?” Harry finally asked after what felt like hours of silence.
“Arms!” Glinda called from the other side of the room.
It was a short walk from Grimmauld Place to get into town and Harry found the travel agency without too much trouble. After all, asking four random fellow shoppers and a policeman for directions was a perfectly normal thing to do if you were unfamiliar with an area.
They had opened the wine—which Draco had commended Harry on—while they were eating. Harry hadn't had the heart to tell Draco that he had only picked the wine because the name made him giggle. Somebody who would name their brand 'Elephant on a Tightrope' deserved his business.
Hermione ignored them and threw some Floo powder into the flames. The rest of the group waited in silence for her to finish whatever she was doing.
“Yes, he's been on the bestsellers list for an entire year. His sales have helped our mortgage to be paid off.”
“Zach, hi,” Harry greeted. “I didn't think we were late.”
“Harry!”
Harry pulled Draco to him. “You're an idiot. You should have done this a long time ago.”
You see, Ron had assumed Draco was a dog.
“Bisexual?” Harry said. “Huh.”
“Hmm,” Hermione said, shooting a glare at Ron, “as tactless as Ron can be, he's not wrong. You need to move on and find someone else. I'm not saying you need to find someone to marry right now, but please. Ginny's moved on; it's about time you did the same.”
Draco's face fell. “I have to go away.”
“They are some bloody awful bushes,” Harry suddenly said, jerking his head in the direction of the window to the garden. “And the smell...”
“This is too hard!” he grumbled out loud, swiping a hand over the table and sending the contents flying onto the floor.
Draco silenced him with a kiss. “I know; don't worry. It won't stop me from leaving you with a fantastic memory though.”
“And what about you?” Darius asked, picking up the pygmy puff in his claws. Gently, of course. He didn't want to know what Bob would do if his favourite member got mangled.
“I'll teach you the Patronus Charm.”
They had shifted closer together at some point during the night, and they were still sitting against the wall, cloaked in their charms, talking intently when the sun rose the following morning. Harry had the fleeting wish for the sun to bugger back off; he didn't want the night to end.
“Draco,
fully in place—having his ear talked off by Hermione.

Harry laughed and got his money pouch out. He definitely needed another drink.
“Okay, okay.” Zach held up his hands defensively. “I'll remember that for next time.”
“We do make a great team. Why did you enlist? For me, it was the only job I ever wanted to do.”
Reaching the door to the chapel, Hermione kissed Harry on the cheek before leaving to find her seat. Another door opened, and Harry was overwhelmed at the sight of his almost-husband in his suit. Harry had to admit that puce was now his favourite colour, seeing how it looked against Draco's skin.
I have been a (mostly) good boy this year, and have been told by my friend Teddy that I should let you know and ask for something for Christmas. I've also been asked to remind you that Teddy would very much like a new broom (and not a Cleansweep as he has one of those).
“What else is there to say?” Harry asked, Draco's words not calming him down at all.
Draco shut him up with a kiss. “I know that, you pillock. It's the
“It's Darius and I. It's quite easy to know when to use which. You take out—”
Harry turned on the spot. “I'm going to bed,” he said, deciding that, in his professional opinion, sleep would fix it all.
Draco scoffed.
“You were being a git.”
Three, and this was the big one to Harry, was how Malfoy looked. Harry wasn't blind; he knew Malfoy was attractive. Harry had caught himself staring at him on more than a couple of occasions and he wasn't afraid, to himself at least, to admit it. He'd only seen Malfoy an hour ago, and Harry couldn't believe the difference. For one, he was wearing casual clothes, something that Malfoy swore he'd never be seen dead in. And then there was the other thing, the thing that made Harry's mouth water, something he'd never thought he had a fancy for before.
Harry x
“No, thankfully. The spell went skywards and dissipated. No one was hurt.”
Harry moved forward, taking Draco's cock in one hand, and steadying himself with his other. Bringing the hard cock to his lips, Harry licked the tip before sucking the length fully into his mouth. After only a few moments, Draco was already starting to pant, so Harry pulled off and held his hand out.
Before I could think any more, the door opened and a rather ashamed, and a little upset, looking Potter shuffled in. I could feel my cheeks redden even before Potter opened his mouth. I ran over the words I was going to say in my head.
Harry let out a laugh at his friend before turning his attention back to the man in front of him. “Why? What? How?” was all that he could say.
Harry debated calling in sick the following morning. He hadn't slept well again, and the last thing he wanted to do was listen to Malfoy's tales of his night with Monsieur Nice Hair.
Pansy had come into the shop one day, not long after he had re-opened, hoping to apologise for her actions in the Great Hall before the final battle. She was very insistent and refused to leave until she'd apologised properly. Harry had snapped that if she was truly sorry, she'd get her arse behind the counter and help him out. She truly was, so she did. And she never left. It was a running joke between the two of them that one day, Harry would finally accept her apology and she could go and get a 'proper job'.
“Wait, what?” Ron was paler than normal. “Did you just say—”
The morning after, Harry woke up and figured he had two options. Ignore the fact that he'd discovered kissing men was as—if not more—enjoyable than kissing women, or go and talk to the one person he'd discussed the important stuff with since he was eleven.
“Huh, course,” Harry mumbled, sitting up in bed slightly. “Morning,” he said to Glinda, who had walked in at Harry's agreement.
Harry was gratified to hear the crack in Draco's back as he moved towards the sink. Harry had been worried he was getting old.
“You asked,” Grumpy said with a shrug. “And I don't think it fair to keep the guests in the dark. You should have the choice to leave if you wish.”
“You'll see,” was the only answer Draco gave him.
“Harry was expecting me,” Zach said, confusion clear on his face. “We're supposed to go over the decorating plans for his house. Are you ready to go, Harry?”
Harry barely registered the thunk of the belt hitting his floor, as Draco had moved on to undoing his trousers. Harry's lip darted out to wet his suddenly dry lips as Draco's zip was lowered and the trousers fell to the floor with a simple wiggle of Draco's hips.
The words themselves were innocuous enough—How do you fancy the Cannons match tomorrow? I can score us some tickets; I can meet you for a nice meal afterwards. We haven't done that in a while—but Draco didn't miss the singular 'you' being directed at Harry.
Harry rolled his eyes as Hermione's words went through his mind. She had been adamant that Harry
Draco had been over to the elder Weasleys' house for dinner a couple of times since he and Harry had become a couple, and he had been amazed at the reception he'd received. Yes, there was the initial shock, but once Harry had explained how they had become close, Draco had been readily accepted by them. After a hearty round of good-natured ribbing from Ginny, of course.
“Now that I think about it, I'd better get home and give him something to remember me by.” Draco winked at the group and Harry started choking again.
Quickly changing out of his Healer's robes—horrible, itchy things that they were—Harry threw some jeans and a t shirt on and went to give Brewin some food.
“'I never thought I'd see the day when my little old lady of a mother—a grandmother, at that—is asking me to explain what felching is.”
Some of the more disreputable newspapers and magazines published a couple of rather unflattering rumours about how their relationship had started. There was talk of it just being a 'publicity stunt', and even a few murmurs of something dark that the Malfoy family has orchestrated. Harry took great delight in returning their owls with a few choice words written by his
“Oh,” Harry whispered back, putting his wand away. Harry was at a loss for what to do; should he fight or run for help? His decision was made when another kick was aimed at Grumpy Waiter. “OI!” he shouted, gaining the attention of the attackers.
“Right!” Harry shouted, slamming the door behind him. “Don't you fuckers have your own homes to shower in? Get out, you useless bastards.”
“Of course. You can help me pick out the colours. You
“Please, ladies and gentlemen,” the manager called loudly, “I apologise for the disturbance. If you would like to move towards the other bar, my staff will bring you all some drinks. On the house, of course.”
Draco coloured slightly but snootily stuck his nose in the air. “It was a perfectly good name, if I recall it correctly.”
“Well, I'll just Portkey over there, then. I need to see him. I need to explain.”
“Can you explain?”
Dog slumped. Foiled again. Harry was never normally this hard to torment.
I blinked. “You knew how to get rid of them?”
, but soon they were inundated with requests for quotes or interviews from every newspaper in print. Harry and Draco refused adamantly, but that didn't stop the daily barrage of owls, or the articles.
The members of BAHAHAHAH groaned. They didn't like to be remembered of that particular mission. It had taken five agents and a lot of work to fix the harmony in Gryffindor after that debacle.
. Harry was completely sure that Malfoy hadn't been with him all weekend, which threw up one big question. Exactly who the bloody fuck had been eating all his biscuits?
Harry was struck by a familiarity in the man's voice and as the man turned his head to speak again, Harry nearly fainted. It had him reaching for his towel, anyway.
“He just would've come back at a later time,” Draco assured him and Harry was shocked to realise that he had spoken aloud. “We'll just have to go out again tonight. And have less distractions.”
“Six o'clock?” Harry said with a shrug. “And Pansy?” he added. “What
“Are you serious? Every wizard in the country knows when your birthday is.”
Draco obviously had the same idea as Harry, as he started to climb onto the bed. Harry allowed himself to be pushed back onto the bed as Draco climbed on top of him and leant down to kiss him once more.
“Hi, Harry. Miss me?”
“It...it...it...”
“What?”
Dog rolled his eyes. Why Draco liked Harry was beyond him. He was a numpty. Yeah, he gave good scratches and would walk him for miles, but he was a numpty. But never mind that, he had a plan to put in action.
Harry blushed, and Draco was sure he saw a flash of relief cross his face. “Um, I was going to say, 'I want you...to know that I don't hate you'.”
Harry hadn't said a word since. Draco had tried explaining that he hadn't meant to cuddle him, and didn't know how they ended up like they had, but it was to no avail. Harry just ignored him, his cheeks still the same red they'd been since he'd woken up.
Draco recognised the man speaking from the dining room, but hadn't spoken to him before. He didn't know his name; Draco just thought of him as Baldy.
“I'm only taking the piss,” Draco insisted, throwing his arm around Harry's shoulders. “Harry's got no reason to look anywhere else. I happen to know that his right hand does the job perfectly well.”
“SILENCE!”
Even Darius couldn't keep a straight face at Hedwig's words. She didn't actually believe it herself.
~1700
Moving on, Draco couldn't help but notice the next couple. They were the exact opposite of Ten and One. Beauty and The Bear, Draco thought immediately. She was stunning—gay, straight or alien could see that—and he was as hirsute as he'd seen a man. And that included Old Mr Goyle. Draco's first instinct was that The Bear was Beauty's bodyguard.
“Congratulations,” Fawkes said when the crowd was fully assembled. “Bob tells me that we have Hedwig and Darius to thank for such a successful mission.”
Hermione had been stupidly happy when Harry had told her he booked a holiday, and was determined to find out where he was going. Harry, while not embarrassed by his choice, didn't feel the need to tell her. He'd told her that he was going away for some peace and quiet and didn't want, or expect, any owls.
“Oh.” Draco blushed slightly. “I was ready, so I thought I'd come and...” Draco trailed off and gestured to his drink.
. He knew Draco. He knew that he wasn't a bad person. He knew that he sometimes acted without thinking.
They'd even staged an accident between themselves, hoping that Harry and Draco's worry over their pets would overcome their hatred for one another. All that happened was that Hedwig and Darius found themselves being smothered by Hagrid in his hut while Harry and Draco's friends shouted accusations at one another. Being covered in Fang's drool while they were 'recuperating' only added to their despair.
Draco, too, had confided in Harry that he was out of touch with his own friends. Pansy and Blaise had been pressured into marriage immediately after the war, and were travelling around Europe, enjoying the company of the—in Draco's words—'beautiful people'. Harry took that to mean 'rich'. His other friends from school were either locked up in Azkaban, dead, or simply hiding in disgrace.
“Sorry,” Hermione said, mopping up the spray of Chardonnay from the kitchen table. “What?”
Draco definitely detected a hint of an insult in that, but he ignored it. “I found it on one of my trips to Toys R Us; it's a lot of fun.” Draco tugged on his hand again. “Come on; we're blocking the door.”
over. Finally, thankfully, over. I could've cried with relief myself. We barely had a proper childhood thanks to that noseless bastard, but it was done. Finished. And it was thanks to you.
Harry almost laughed at the easiness between the two of them. When they'd arrived back for the first day of school, the returning 'eighth year' students were given a list of room allocations along with a lecture on starting afresh. They were given promises that spells were in place that meant anything that happened in their rooms would stay there, and were encouraged to talk to one another without the threat of any gossip spreading throughout the school.
“It's me, Draco. Well, us. This—” Harry took the book from Draco. “'—is literally us.”
Pansy looked scandalised before tying on her apron and getting to work. After many more attempts by Pansy to elicit tales of the date, Harry realised something. Something he thought was very important.
“Wait,” Hermione said. “You can't be bringing 'what might have been's into it! Thor is nothing without his hammer.”
“Budge up,” Draco said upon approaching Harry. “If you won't get off the lounger, we'll have to share.”
The pair talked for hours. They discussed their reasons for getting away from the wizarding world—Harry was surprised to discover that Malfoy's reasons were basically the same as his—and how they felt about naturism and their holiday resort in particular. Harry found Malfoy's views on the subject refreshing; gone was the Malfoy he had once known, and in his place Harry was pleased to find a companionable, funny and pleasant man.
In answer, Draco simply handed him his pen. Harry stared at it.
Harry led the way to their usual table, pleased to note as he passed that the windows had already been replaced. He waited until Grumpy Waiter came to serve them before starting to talk. The sight of Grumpy Waiter's black eye caused Harry some measure of surprise.
Draco? Harry couldn't find an answer without hearing from the man himself. There was only one way to find out. He was ready. He needed to talk to Draco.
“I like you.”
Was it even worth it?
“It's about fucking time!” Pansy's shout caused the men to break apart. “No, sorry! Carry on!”
When Draco had left, Harry had taken a second to think before storming into his bedroom, and slamming the door behind him. Zach had woken up and had had the fucking cheek to smile at Harry and wish him good morning. Harry had soon hexed the little bastard until he'd left his house. Harry wasn't in the mood to listen to his reasons for climbing into bed with him.
I was shocked. I knew Harry was working on a big case, but I had no idea that the case was me. And for him to use his status like that—it was unheard of.
“What are you doing here?” Harry asked, wrapping himself more securely in Draco's arms. “I thought you had to work late.”
I did mention to Harry—and Merlin! Calling him Harry took some getting used to—about keeping our relationship a secret, but he wouldn't hear of it. According to his infinite wisdom, people knowing about us would only reiterate the point that we weren't bad, just normal teenagers.
“What can I do?”
Silence reigned as someone—Draco didn't have a clue who—abruptly turned off the wireless. One second stretched into two before all hell broke loose.
“That's not going to happen,” Harry said loudly.
I've said it sarcastically, I've said it to try to get myself out of trouble, I've said it because I've actually felt apologetic. I couldn't count how many times I've said it in my life, nor would I want to.
It was a perfect morning, except for one thing. I felt dreadful. It had been the longest since we'd got together that I'd been without Harry, for a start. Adding the fact that I'd stormed off and refused to see him (my mother and the bloody house-elves insisted on telling me that he'd tried to see me), well, it didn't make for the best of mornings.
“Do what?”
Draco and Harry placed their car at the top of the ramp, and with a whispered 'Good luck', let it go. It sailed down the course, egg securely on board, but it slowed quickly and Draco thought that Grumpy and Frumpy had it in the bag. Draco could hear Harry muttering, 'Come on, come on' under his breath and, sure enough, their car inched past Grumpy and Frumpy's to take first place.
The paper cranes were just one prong of my many layered, well thought out plan. I'd spent quite a long time when I should have been sleeping—who knew nightmares could be so useful?—thinking of new ways to annoy the hell out of Potter.
~ ~ ~
Draco was at his side in a second, and they both gasped as they saw the two boulders lying a couple of feet apart.
“Yes, the bloody reporters were everywhere; I just wanted to be young for a bit, you know?”
“What the fuck, Bob?” Hedwig knew how she looked to the human population, all white feathers and pure beauty, but she had spent the last seven years living with Harry Potter. She wasn't innocent by any stretch of the imagination.
“We'll be fine,” Harry promised him, picking up a plastic wheel.
“No. One is how people see you, and the other is
Indignation spiked inside me and I had no idea why. It
“Good morning!” Glinda cheerfully announced as she entered the room. “I hope you all slept well.”
“Harry, please.”
It was safe to say that Draco had high hopes for dinner. He should have known not to expect too much.
“Oh, you look like you've finished. I'll go and grab myself a chair.”
Draco looked around the room, and saw that some other guests were seeing it as just that. There were small bouts of laughter coming from all tables. Draco was sure that Frumpy was a mother, if the way she opened her mouth every time she tried to feed Grumpy was any indication.
“I’m working today,” Pansy replied, sounding bored and not looking up from
“But, as you know,” Draco said with a smirk on his face, “he's safely in Azkaban where he holds no control over my life. And I hope he stays there for the foreseeable future. I like leading my own life. Yeah, I don't know exactly what I want to do with it, but I like the fact that it
“As Draco pointed out, there are perfectly valid trust-building exercises, but they are mainly for trusting somebody with your physical self. These,” she said, gesturing to the objects in front of her, “are to help trust someone with your heart.”
Draco lifted Harry’s face to his. “Spell?” he asked with a raised eyebrow.
“It would have been hypocritical of me get you back to school, only to make your life hell once you were here. It would have been just plain wrong. I wanted to get back to normal, and I couldn't think of coming back to Hogwarts without you being here.
Draco gasped aloud. His first thought was that Harry was taking the piss out of him, but he knew all of Harry's 'let's make fun of Draco' faces, and he wasn't using any of them.
to see him without his clothes on? Did wanting to smile when you see someone mean you liked them? Did looking out for someone and not wanting them to get hurt mean you fancied them?
Despite his over-indulgence the previous night, Harry awoke early. His head was pounding and his mouth tasted like something had crawled into it overnight and died, but he had a small smile on his face as he thought over yesterday. Stumbling into the bathroom, Harry relieved himself and brushed his teeth before rummaging in his toiletries bag for the hangover potion he had packed
“Bloody hell!” Draco exclaimed. “Look at that.”
Draco and Harry sat opposite one another, so close that Draco could see himself reflected in Harry's glasses. They held hands as they usually did, but Harry's thumbs rubbed across the top of Draco's in a maddeningly gentle way.
“What?” Harry voiced aloud.
vol. 7.0.
Harry, thankfully, remembered the basics of tennis—the scoring and the game structure—from Primary school, so as Tony explained the rules to an elderly couple, Harry scoped out the competition. It might be a bit of fun, but Harry hadn't lost his competitive edge—he wanted to win!
The look of confusion must have been evident on my face as you soon clarified.
He stabbed at his lettuce and glared at Harry opposite him. Harry, for his part, simply sat there and ate his sandwiches without a sound. He hadn't spoken to Draco since they'd gone back to their room for Harry to take his nap. Draco had woken him when the lunch bell chimed, and Harry hadn't even looked at him before dragging him down to the dining room.
“Kingsley gave him free reign. Harry told him flat out that he'd quit otherwise, and he knew the Ministry wouldn't like that.”
“No buts. You must be off. It'll be breakfast soon and I'm sure you have mail to pick up. I'll call a meeting for a few days time to review your progress. Good luck.” With a huge sigh, he sank to the depths of the lake, leaving two unusually flustered owls behind.
It was seeing the look or pure relief on my mother's face when she saw that I was all right. It was, despite all the deaths, despite the sheer exhaustion, seeing the small smiles on people's faces at it finally being over.
The members of BAHAHAHAH dispersed as they  reached the castle doors. The students and teachers might find all of their pets gathered together a little strange, even for a school of magic.  The owls took to the rafters to get a look while the non-flying animals hid in nooks and crannies and between legs. Mrs Norris, of course, didn't bother with that, sauntering right into the centre of things. Bloody show off.
“With work,” Draco clarified. “Hermione has to go to Zagreb next week. She needs me to go with her; we're helping their Ministry to implement the new structure.”
I want the one who makes me smile by just being there. With a simple smile that can light up my world. I want someone who is on my side all the time, but not someone who just bows to me because of my name.
Harry groaned and ripped Draco's cloak from him. “Upstairs. Now.”
This is my fic for the 2014
, and one short interview—including one picture of Harry and Ginny together, post-divorce—and they were left alone.
Harry cut Draco off by leaning forward and kissing him back. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's back, Draco responded by snaking his arms around Harry's waist. Harry never wanted to stop kissing him again.
“Again, he is me. I thought we went through this. And thanks, I think.”
Instead of getting angry, Potter laughed.
Draco grumbled, but the smile underneath his tired face told him that Draco really didn't mind.
“Just for today,” his colleague had answered. “The boss says to show a presence; I don't think he cares much either. Bunch of freaks.”
Band of the Animals of Hogwarts Against Hostility; Any House, Any Human (or BAHAHAHAH, for short).
A murmur rose up in the room, with people looking quite confused at her words.
Harry. And, Merlin, was he shocked when he realised it. Even with their little outburst in therapy, Draco missed him dreadfully. He wanted to laugh with Harry at his teammates' expense. He wanted to do the stupid treasure hunt—and win the bloody thing—with Harry. For fuck's sake, he wanted to hold Harry's hand.
“What?” Harry asked as he noticed everyone looking at him after Zach had left. “What's the matter?”
Harry winced.
“Think the same?” Draco said with a look of pure innocence on his face.
Harry struggled to find words as Malfoy kissed his neck. Merlin he loved to have his neck nibbled on. Harry gripped Malfoy's hair, pushing his head into the crook of his neck. Malfoy bit and sucked as Harry dug his fingers into Malfoy's hair. Harry fully expected Malfoy to bitch about it, but he could cope with that.
“What do you mean?” Draco asked, not sure he wanted the answer.
“They eat that shit up and you know it.” Harry sent a tiny stinging hex at his best friend and publisher. “And it's not Draco.”
had I been so insistent on annoying Potter? It definitely wasn't because I wanted to see him without his clothes. Weasley was way off the mark, there. I didn't
“Potter, what's the matter?”
Draco laughed and Harry drained his glass.
Draco nodded. “That would be nice. See you in the dining room, Harry.”
With the SAS not finding anything tangible they could use to find the writer of the letters, Harry wouldn't leave my side. The SAS were working on a new spell that could detect minute traces of magical signature, but it was still not perfected and I was getting pretty desperate. I wanted them to find the anonymous bastard so Harry would leave me alone for five bloody minutes.
Harry was about to step into the steaming bath when Draco opened the door. “I have a better idea,” he said. “Let me just have a wash and I'll show you.”
“Yes, Harry. I wanted to see you. I wanted to ask you if you fancied going out tonight. Just me and you.”
“That explains the sheen,” Draco interrupted, gesturing to Harry's chest.
“Um, well.” Hedwig stood up straighter and ruffled her feathers. Not that the animals were sorted into houses, but she'd spent more than enough time in Gryffindor to pick up a few traits. “We've been observing the subjects and have a few plans in place. It's much too soon to expect any real results.”
I couldn't bring myself to knock on the door and disturb you. You looked to be having fun with your friends. I didn't want to intrude. Excuses, excuses, I know.
Draco shook his head. Harry just looked confused.
Hermione's eyes took on a strange glint at his words. Harry raised his pint to Ron in thanks and waited for Hermione's next course of action.
“I mean, I don't want to
, and his nights having mind-blowing sex with
The one who will sit with me after work and hear all my stories about old Frank and his straggly dog who desperately needs a bath. The one who will tell me stories of his day while I laugh and refill the wine glasses.
“Come on then, Harry,” Draco said with a small grin, “spill the beans. You're obviously dying to say something.”
Unluckily for me, Professor Slughorn happened to be walking past at that very second. Now, I didn't have my wand out, so no one could prove it was me, but I very quickly removed the Jinx when I was alone. I didn't want to be getting into trouble for causing actual injury.
Today, though, Draco was out—work, he'd heard him moaning about—and Harry had been up in the attic for ages. Teddy wasn't visiting this week and the other animals were up to something. No good, probably. Owl was out flying with her owl friend. She denied it vehemently, but Dog knew they were more than friends. Cat was out doing whatever the hell cats got up to. Dog was just glad he was out. Cats smell. But they were fun to torment.
Love,
“Yes, I do.” Zach looked at Draco once, sneered and gave Harry all of his attention. “How are you?  What are you up to?”
“I told you—I was drunk. It was just a stupid mistake. I just wanted to say sorry.”
“What
I kept my mouth shut and listened, wanting to hear everything, but the questions burned inside me. I was hit with Avada Kedavra. I'd seen my fair share of those cast; it's not something you get up from. I should be dead.
At the end of their heartbreaking talk, all faces turned to Harry and Draco, and Draco blanched.
“No,” Draco murmured, continuing down Harry's chest with his mouth.
“Harry!”
Harry thought as his and Draco first time ran through his head. Not that. Anything but that.
Harry grinned to himself as they walked the last few yards hand in hand, neither one acknowledging the fact.
“Shall we get this over with?” Draco asked, grimacing as he picked up his—Harry's?—knife and fork.
“Oh, get over yourself,” Draco said before Glinda could speak. “This is what you always do. I'd be perfectly happy to just get on with you; I have tried to be your friend. But you have to go and start with the insults. It's getting fucking old.”
“I've been in Wales with Mother and Great Aunt bloody Gwendolene. Potter,” Malfoy said as he studied Harry's results. “Are you sure you're not ill?”
Zach didn't move; he simply stood where he was, looking at Harry.
Harry and Draco sprang apart as the horrendous sound reverberated through them and the unmistakeable noise of thousands of shards of glass falling to the floor echoed in their ears. The two jumped to their feet only to see the shadowy figure fleeing into the dark and the massive front doors of the hotel scattered around the courtyard.
you on about?” Harry repeated.
“No!” Harry stood up. “Are you saying that none of it is your fault?”
was stupid sometimes. The many visits. Draco always sitting next to him in the pub. The talking. The smiles. The touching of Harry's arm. Pansy's eye rolling made sense now.
The only time that Hermione had tried to sit closer to him than she usually did, Ron accused her of being drunk and had taken her straight home to bed.
“Write him a letter.”
“Our lips are sealed,” Ron insisted.
Great, Draco thought, he was talking crap French; he must be drunk.
“In that case,” Draco said, reaching into his bag, “I have a bonus for you. You were awfully close to getting that Snitch, after all.”
There was no way Harry could face going into work. Firstly, he wanted to avoid Draco. Harry still wasn't sure what had happened, and he definitely didn't know
“Sharing a room with Malfoy is one thing.”
Harry/Draco
You smiled. You told me she was doing well. She was enjoying her garden and had taken to completely redoing the Manor. You told me how she was adamant that the Manor be a home again, after being a place of horror during the war.
“Glinda would be horrified.” Draco grabbed two plastic beakers off the sideboard. “But I do like being counter-productive.”
Draco laughed. “You could have just
Glinda stood up straight and adjusted her glasses. “You'll just have to make the best of it. Maybe it will be of help anyway. See you at lunch.”
“What other thing?” I asked, not particularly wanting to hear the answer.
Ignoring Hermione, Harry focussed on Malfoy.
Draco's breath was taken away by the next couple. He was easily a Ten. Thick, dark hair. Bright eyes and a body Draco wanted to do shots off. His gorgeousness was only made more apparent when viewed next to what could only be described as the One stood next to him. Now, Draco was more than aware that he wasn't an expert when it came to finding women attractive, but, Merlin, the poor woman had nothing going for her, looks-wise. Her hair was lank and greasy, she had pockmarks covering her forehead, and the nose. Gah. You could house bats in there.
“Draco,” Harry began, moving to get out of bed.
Harry got up from his chair to grab the holiday brochures off the counter and handed them to Draco. “I want to go on holiday. With you.”
Harry couldn't agree with her more. “Draco?”
“This afternoon,” Glinda said, drawing everyone's attention, “we're going to have a bit of fun. I need you to split into two teams, if you will.”
“When I told Ginny and Ron and Hermione that I
Harry left the hospital and walked home in a daze. So many feelings battled inside him: embarrassment, confusion, hurt,
No, Brewin was soon found to be cuddled on the lap of the person once again drinking his tea and eating his biscuits. Draco bloody Malfoy.
Draco gaped. He couldn't help it. It had been a long time since someone he hadn't known his whole life had called him by his given name, and with a smile, too.
Harry was confused. It was exactly what he'd been looking for; it was exactly what Harry had asked Zach to find for him. Why
“What exactly do you find funny in this situation?”
you were cheating with that confirmed it.”
“Nearly the same way, except I pinned the brochures to the wall and sent a spark at one of them,” Harry admitted, blushing slightly. “When did you get here?”
You told me to call you Draco. We'd gone past the pettiness of our youth. We were grown men and if we wanted to talk to one another, we should use our given names.
At his words, Kingsley gestured to his side and Dean Thomas stepped onto the stage, to cheers and calls from the crowd. Dean winked at Harry before bowing slightly. Harry resisted the urge to poke his tongue out at his friend; he was on stage, after all.
Bollocks. Maybe he and Harry wouldn't do quite as well as Draco had thought.
he shown Harry around all of the crap houses first? That thought went out of his mind when Draco suddenly turned, grabbed Harry by the shoulders and kissed him fully.
Their second attempt was slightly better, as in the wheels stayed on, but the egg rolled straight off its carrier and only Draco's quick reflexes stopped them from having to go to Barry and beg for another egg.
The evening was going fabulously; the drinks were flowing and laughter echoed around the small pub. One thing was missing though, apart from Draco: presents.
“I realised I didn't want Draco. I wanted Malfoy.”
Draco winced. “Yes, but—”
You see, Harry had a secret. He was an author; he wasn't lying about that. And he will crank out the next instalment of what Draco affectionately called his 'children's sleep aids' that was his 'official' job. It's just not what made him happy. Or much money.
I hadn't thought about it for so long, it took me a while to figure it out. I was waking up having had no dreams of doing it. I eagerly awaited Teddy's letters and was grateful for Molly's meals. I still didn't like the statues and the big plaque outside my house, but I could live with it.
“Say you're sorry, and you'll get exactly what you want,” Draco whispered in his ear.
Pansy.
Once the main course was finished—and Draco had to laugh a little at the state of his fellow diners; poor Bear had more food in his beard than the man could have possibly eaten—the desserts came around, thankfully served up individually. Without even looking to Harry for confirmation, Draco grabbed the server.
What felt like several hours later, Harry found himself primped and preened and with Ginny on his arm as they walked into the ballroom. The girls had worked their magic.
“Do you mind if I went? I'm very tired, and could do with some sleep. I still haven't packed.”
“Not hurt?” I repeated, gesturing to the hospital bed. “I beg to differ.”
“Come on, let's go to your room,” Draco said, showing Harry the bottle he'd brought from the table. “I've had enough of this.”
“Well, not
“What about you?”
Harry turned his head and gaped at the sunrise emerging from behind the mountain. “Beautiful,” he murmured at the breathtaking sight. Reaching for Draco's hand, Harry smiled.
Ginny had taught him a rather cool spell for managing the forty nine—Harry hadn't been able to resist counting them—buttons on the robe. Harry had never been more grateful to learn something. The robe set his suit off magnificently. Well, according to Hermione it did anyway.
“This is brilliant!”
“Zach, hi. You know Draco.”
As Harry dried off he faced an even bigger dilemma. To dress, or not to dress? He'd been so comfortable in his nakedness the entire duration of the holiday, both with Draco's presence and without. But was it different now? Had anything changed? His internal questions were answered quickly.
Harry could only nod.
“Do you want a walk?”
happy with you.
“Me? Teach you? How to kiss?”
“That bastard.”
The elderly couple were, well, elderly. The pair of girls were giggly and too concentrated on their gossip to be any real threat. The middle-aged couple looked as if they'd played a few sets in their time; they were the ones to watch. There were also a couple of teenagers and other couples mingling about; Harry didn't even know if they were playing or not.
“Iron Man. How the buggering fuck did you come out of that film thinking Iron Man is the best Avenger?”
I have lots of different people in my life. I have a family in the Weasleys. I have wonderful friends in Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville. I have Teddy and Andromeda. But I'm missing that person. You know, that one.
Before Harry knew what was happening, Draco was leaning into him and kissing him, pushing Harry against the back of the sofa. The angle was awkward and Harry's elbow was digging into Draco's ribs, but with a few subtle shifts, they were flush together and Harry knew that finally—
“What?” Harry shouted at the guard who was now stood in front of him, blocking his way. “I need to see someone.”
It didn't take long to settle back into school life. After all, it was all I had wanted for the past year. I couldn't wait to get back in. There were a few—okay, a
Harry burst out laughing at the absurdity of it all.
“Um...” Pig hid behind Crookshanks. Poking his head around her bushy tail, he squeaked out, “I lost him.”
Harry's head snapped up in shock. “Heal it?”
Harry also knew that it wasn't just Draco at fault. He had started it all, of course, but Harry had finished it. He'd fallen into bed with Draco; he hadn't been forced. He kept it a secret. He continued the charade.
Harry pulled away from Draco to see Zach standing beside the table, chair in hand and a gob-smacked expression on his face.
“He's gone.”
“How about this?” Draco finally said, slipping his fingers between Harry's.
Harry and Draco worked diligently, making sure their egg was secure before building the rest of the car.
“Morning,” Draco said, stifling a yawn and well aware that he hadn't brushed his teeth yet. “Have we missed breakfast?”
“Thanks,” Harry said, grabbing some glasses off of the sideboard and pouring a glass for him and Draco. “Zach, would you like me to open your bottle for you?”
“Oh dear; I apologise.”
Draco was hopeful that Harry would continue the talk from their morning session, but every time Draco tried to introduce the topic, Harry would switch it to something inconsequential, like Quidditch.
Ron grimaced and Harry laughed.
“Pans? Good book?” Draco kissed the cheek Pansy offered up, but she didn't put the book down.
“Holding hands.”
“Oh, really.” Bob's tone was flat, and if Darius didn't know any better, he'd think him amused.
As they walked, Harry's budged Draco gently in the side before entangling their fingers together. Harry loved the feeling of
Harry simply didn't like not knowing what was going to happen. He didn't like blind dates for the same reason. Harry had been set up on blind date after blind date in the recent weeks. No one would—or could—understand why Harry wasn't in a relationship. Harry had tried to tell them that he'd found the perfect man, and that he just needed to pluck up the courage to ask him out. Harry was scared of his man's response. All in all, Harry hated surprises.
“It's not little!”
Harry was confused. It wasn't an attack against the hotel? It was a personal attack against Grumpy Waiter? Harry thought—amongst other things—that he really should have learnt his name.
There was something more pressing that concerned Draco: hiding their night's activities from Glinda. So, as much as Draco would have loved to have a massive full English, he and Harry quickly grabbed some tea and toast and escaped back to their room before Glinda could talk to them. Luckily, they had one of the last morning sessions, and Draco hoped they had plenty of time to fully recover.
“Draco,” Potter said, smiling and nodding to me as he passed. “Have a nice day.”
“But you said...”
A small crowd of early-risers had gathered and were staring in horror and confusion at the mass of floats on the top of the water, all bearing the same word: PERV.
“No.”
Harry had had to hold Draco back from hexing the men. Harry was only doing so to stop himself from hexing them on principle. Law providing was only for people who acted 'normal' apparently. Bigoted bastards.
It took a few weeks of me finding you at your table in the corner after Ron had gone home to Hermione and the kids. It took countless pints and me unceremoniously plopping myself down at your table before you would actually talk to me.
“What?”
“Do you think Kingsley knew about this,” Harry said, sitting next to Draco on his bed and gesturing around the room, “when he sent us here?”
“Oh, yes. That.” Harry blushed and sat back in his chair.
Pansy raised an eyebrow and pointedly looked around the very adult crowd in the bar.
Draco incinerated the notes that had arrived in quick succession after that incident. The look on Harry's face told Draco that it was either the letters or the—damn Harry and his wandless magic—owls themselves. Don't Avada Kedavra the messenger, his mother had always told Draco, and he wisely chose
This was how his kitchen table was now littered with brochure after brochure depicting everywhere from the beautiful beaches in Hawaii to the bustling streets of Barcelona. Harry knew he needed a holiday; he just didn't know
“Glasses? What the bloody fuck are you going on about? Last time I saw you—with my perfect eyesight, thank you very much—you were going home to change your ketchup stained clothes before we went to the bloody pub. Have I missed something?”
Harry was pleased to see—not that he acknowledged it—Draco's look of horror at the waiter's words. The waiter easily popped the cork and poured both Harry and Draco a glass each.
“Bye, Potter!” Malfoy called when the clock struck three. “Wish me luck!”
“You mean, you did,” Harry pointed out, gesturing down at his clothes.
The news that Harry Potter had opened a café had spread like wildfire throughout the wizarding world. Witches and wizards had come from miles around to be served tea by him. Harry had never expected so many customers; he had assumed it would have been just as it was when he was a customer—some shoppers needing a rest and maybe a few regulars. He was very very wrong. As a consequence, he now counted Pansy Parkinson as his most treasured employee, and a very close friend.
Actually, that little fucker Zacharias Smith was the lucky one. I was about thirty seconds away from showing him exactly how 'evil' a Slytherin could be. After all, I'd had plenty of practice.
“I want to keep this between us. It's quite hot, thinking of the world getting turned on by our escapades, but a small part of me wants to see Ron's face when he realises his mother has been doing the same.”
Draco had been gone for two weeks, and Harry was miserable. True to his word, Draco fire-called him at least every other day, but Harry still missed him dreadfully. He hated sleeping alone. Harry had been busy, though; the café was as bustling as ever, and he was getting on well with decorating the house. Harry was determined to have it finished by the time Draco got back home.
“Do you have something to say, Draco?”
“Harry... Wait, what? She hated me. I remember: she actually used the words, 'I hate you.'"
Harry laughed. As he did so, he thought about the one thing missing from the evening: the awkward 'getting to know each other' first-date talk. Harry was so relieved; he never liked that part anyway. He and Draco already knew almost everything about each other. Background, family—although, that wasn't being discussed this evening, if Harry could help it—work, friends. The laughter and teasing were natural parts of their usual nights out. The talking, the laughing—it came easily; it was fantastic.
“The manager thinks it was some kids,” Harry replied, pasting as smile on his face. “Hopefully, he's right. Whoever it was though, I refuse to let them spoil my holiday.”
Draco's sudden burst of laughter stopped Harry in his tracks. “Draco? You okay?”
Harry didn't know what he was doing as he and Draco moved forwards. He knew he couldn't draw his wand on the attackers, but he also knew that he couldn't just leave Grumpy Waiter to the thugs. Harry was well aware of the fact that he wasn't going to win a Muggle fistfight. Well, unless he was fighting Draco, of course.
“You're holding hands,” Glinda said.
“What time is Theo getting here?” Draco asked.
“No. I'm not finished. And you'd better be glad that Hermione had a meeting this morning. You could have had it all back, Harry. What the fuck did you do?”
“I don't cheat, thank you very much, as you well know.”
“Do you fancy a walk to the beach?” Draco finally asked. Harry was pleased to see the twinkle had returned to his eyes. “If you're lucky, I'll top up your sunscreen. The Muggle way.”
Harry and Draco both kissed her cheeks before leaving hand-in-hand. “So, the steps of the Ministry?” Draco asked with a wink.
” Harry mouthed at Draco. Draco shrugged.
Thankfully—or not, depending who you spoke to—we didn't have to deal with Smith any longer. He was expelled the morning of the article. Not only had he flouted McGonagall's 'forget the past; live for the present' rule, it was discovered that he had been sneaking off to London during school time to talk to the reporter, not to mention the Galleons he'd made illicitly.
“As soon as we get out of here. You, me and a Snitch?”
Harry nodded and Draco shrugged again, although he had absolutely no idea what she wanted him to say. Glinda smiled and Draco relaxed slightly.
In an attempt to stem the flow of hate, Harry sent a letter to the editor of the Prophet. Surprisingly, it actually worked. That might have had something to do with Granger's addition of an opening paragraph stating that the letter would be the only correspondence they would ever receive from Harry if they didn't comply with its contents, and Pansy's ending of, what amounted to, 'Fuck off and leave us alone'.
He was slightly out of breath by the time he reached the steps of Gringotts and Harry silently cursed his lack of exercise over the last few months. Harry took his time having his money converted. He didn't usually like to spend a lot of time with the goblins—they still hadn't forgiven him fully for the dragon—but as his only other option was facing the hoards he assumed were waiting for him outside, Harry made small talk with the goblin serving him and asked the dreaded question. There really was no other way; he couldn't go back out into that crowd.
I barely heard the cheers of my house-mates, nor did I feel my team-mates clapping me on the back. My mind was set on one thing: finding Potter and rubbing it right into his smug face. I'd waited years to do that, and nothing was going to stop me. I had my winning speech going over and over again in my mind on a loop. I was ready.
Grasping around, Harry found his wand and turned the water off, quickly drying them both so they wouldn't get cold. Pushing himself to his feet, he held a hand out for Draco.
“Literally?” Hermione shouted, pointing her finger at Harry. “
Potter had just caught up to me on his way to Transfiguration, and with a nod and a genial, 'Draco', his trousers dropped, showing off a rather fetching, obviously new, pair of pants. Potter simply rolled his eyes and pulled his trousers up, but Weasley had other ideas.
We still enjoyed spending time with our circle of friends and soon got used to being the 'It couple'. Whether it was a kiss or a fight, I was never surprised to find our weekend's activities posted on the front pages of the gossip magazines that Pansy always had littered around her living room.
Before Harry could answer, Hermione jumped up from her seat and whistled. Loudly. Everyone instantly stopped and looked towards them. A sinking feeling hit Harry as Hermione said two simple words.
It wasn't a long talk, nor a particularly exciting one. Draco had said: Let's get through this as best we can, and Harry had agreed. They had no other choice, so what else could they do. The rest of the hour was spent peacefully reading. Despite all their differences, they had never had a problem being alone together. Actually, Draco realised, Harry only tended to insult him when there was somebody around to hear it.
“What? I haven't—”
Harry waved Ron and Hermione off as they left for the village, ignoring the pang of jealousy that flared when they happily linked hands. Enough
“I didn't.”
Harry smiled and picked up the cuppa, taking a sip. Harry had to wonder how Draco knew how he took his tea, but then he realised that Pansy’s gossiping probably ran both ways.
“Yeah,” Ginny said, “but no one else was subjected to it, so we don't know. But there's no way Thor would have fallen for it.”
It had only been a few years since Muggle cinema had become the new 'in' thing amongst young witches and wizards, but Harry and Draco—and their assorted friends—took to it with a vigour usually reserved for Quidditch. A Muggleborn had opened one tiny cinema in Diagon Alley, and it turned out to be such a big success, before long they were popping up all over the wizarding world.
Even though she was small in stature, the woman seemed to loom over him as he offered his hand in greeting. She was a mess of contradictions. Draco liked her already.
“There's always time for proper grammar.”
“And you have to go?” Harry asked. He knew the answer already; he just wanted to make sure.
Both Harry and Draco stopped their ranting and looked at Glinda in surprise.
“I don't think so,” Draco said, breaking Harry's thoughts. “So, you're the bastards who think we're all pervs?”
they were.
“No, not like that,” Glinda said, as nobody moved away from their partners. “One partner in each of the teams. We're going on a treasure hunt!”
So, what to do with us? There was talk—fairly terrifying talk—of us all going to prison with our parents, but our salvation finally came—and I shouldn't have been surprised—in the form of Harry Potter and Professor McGonagall.
“Harry.” Draco stood up and made his way over to a shell-shocked Harry. “You are a fucking idiot.”
“And this one?” Hermione shook the papers in her hand. “The people are desperate for more Anthony and Steve.”
Draco knew exactly where his partner was at all times when on a case, and instinctively knew exactly how to work with him. They fired spells in perfect harmony and they moved around each other as if in a choreographed dance.
“I can't do this any more,” he said, looking straight into Draco's eyes. All day he'd been trying to figure out exactly what to say, and his bloody brain decided to just come out with it. Brilliant.
“There's this new writer who has burst on the scene in the states. I picked up a book one afternoon and got hooked. Mum saw one of the books in my bag and wouldn't stop talking about it. I didn't know they were so popular over here and I definitely didn't think my bloody mother would be reading them.”
, be like that again.
“Ah, I thought you'd scrubbed up a little too well.” Draco smirked and undid his jacket. “Gorgeous, then.”
“Although not many of them know that you once spent it handcuffed to a bed in a dingy flat in London after a date with a Muggle went awry. I had weeks of jokes out of that one.”
“Hermione,” Harry whispered into his friend's ear while the others were busy watching Neville down a pint of something green, “I don't want to sound, erm, greedy... but I was just... wondering...”
hadn't been so scared and
finished here.”
“Cold,” he said, hoping Harry bought it.
“Keep caressing,” Glinda called across the room. “Really
“Much. I wouldn't have called you a cheat, anyway. I won the bet, and this was my choice. Live with it.
“Give me a break,” Harry said, laughing. “I didn't have toys as a kid. I don't know what to do.”
Harry woke up on Sunday morning with another pounding head and a need to know what the fuck was going on with Malfoy. They'd spent the night, again, drinking wine and talking. Malfoy, thankfully, bypassed the ins and outs of how he'd travelled in time, and instead had focussed on the major points of trying to get Harry into bed. It was exhausting.
Dear Father Christmas,
Draco's eyebrows rose.
“Hermione sent me home,” he answered. “Apparently, I look like shit and need some sleep.”
The table erupted with laughter, apart from Harry, who was trying to make himself as small as possible in his chair.
“Evidence?” Pansy asked before being shushed by Draco.
“Hmm,” Draco moaned as Harry removed Draco's cloak and started kissing across his neck. “Stop that. You wanted to talk? You go first. Yours looks like good news. I could do with some of that.”
“Not even W—your friends?” Harry smiled at Draco's almost-slip; he'd been doing it all holiday.
, the creepy, unnatural bastard that he was. One would think that he lost all sense of sanity when he lost his nose.
No, the thing that Draco found disappointing was set up along the wall near the kitchen: a bloody buffet. Draco didn't think of himself as a snob—not a huge one anyway—but there was something he found extremely unsettling about buffets. The thought of so many people touching his food was the least of it. Germs, insects, airborne viruses. Eurgh.
Not that he didn't want to go, of course. He didn't, but that was besides the point. He simply wasn't invited.
. And, in my defence, you treated me like a twat right back.”
“I, um, you squeeze too hard!” As he spoke, Harry grabbed Draco's hand. “Like this.”
The Mouse told them all how she hoped the weekend would help The Giant realise that she didn't care if he had two knuts to rub together, she just loved him. The Giant wanted to be sure that she wasn't just rebelling against her father.
Harry let thoughts of Pansy disappear as he thought over the night before. Was it really that great? Harry decided that, yes, it had been that great, and he was going to do everything in his power to make it happen again. Shifting in the sticky sheets, Harry grimaced. Everything in his power would have to wait until after a shower.
“I haven't—”
As Smith was led away by his housemate, holding his red cheek, Harry stood up. If I hadn't been so angry I could've screamed, I might've laughed at Smith trying to hide behind little Irene Howard. Harry ignored him completely and walked over to me, holding his hand out.
food. The small description of dinner on his itinerary intrigued him. He was very much looking forward to a decent meal. Draco loved Grenville, and his ability to organise a wardrobe better than anyone, but his cooking left a
“Thank you,” the bloodied man muttered before the newly-arrived ambulance men pushed Harry and Draco aside.
Zach scrambled up off of the floor. “Ron?”
“Exactly. I thought that if I did that, any feelings for you would just
Not wanting to keep anything from Harry, I showed him the bundle and finally allowed him to at least give them to the Special Auror Squad to look at. Meanwhile, without Helen intercepting my mail, I realised that not only were they a daily occurrence but they were steadily getting more explicit in their hatred.
“Certainly, we can look at that now for you, sir.” The shock was replaced by disbelief on Marie's face. “We can also look into some other resorts, if you'd like. When would you like to go?”
“I didn't write it. Well, I did. But a long time ago. Sit down,” he said, pulling a bottle of wine out of his bag. “I'll crack this open and I'll tell you all about it.”
Harry had never seen Draco looking so nervous. Harry
you.”
“Harry, please,” Hermione's plea brought Harry fully out of his daydream. More's the pity. Harry was having fun in his daydream; undoing the buckle and sliding the belt through the loops of Draco's posh trousers.
“About what?”
Harry gestured for Draco to follow him into the kitchen, not sure what to say. Draco obviously had no such worries. They'd barely made it to the kitchen when Draco started rambling.
Malfoy still had his back to him. Harry tried his best to concentrate on his anger and not the water running over Malfoy's arse. He
All around the hall, the gobsmacked looks of the students and the members of BAHAHAHAH were echoed in even the professors' faces. It certainly hadn't been what anybody—animal or human—had expected to see.

“All I knew about you was what I'd seen in school, and I'd built you up to be this bad man that ran from man to man. I didn't want to put myself in the situation where you

a painting, and it was beautiful. Harry inexplicably found himself blinking back tears as he spotted the faces of the people he, and many others, had lost. His mum and dad, Fred, Tonks, Professor Lupin, Dumbledore. They were all there, along with so many others, many of which he couldn't identify. The plaque at the foot of the painting stated that the piece was called 'The Price'. Harry couldn't think of a more fitting name for it.
myself?”
“Pansy!” he cried on seeing his friend sitting at the counter, flipping through a magazine. “What are you doing here?”
Draco and Potter looked at each other and rolled their eyes. Yeah,
14,327
“Oh no you don't. I need you to know this is real. And that involves you being in full charge of your mental faculties, all right? Tea?”
“That's not really necessary.” Harry tried, knowing it was probably futile as most of the table turned their attention to Pansy.
I was on the team. I just needed to show everybody else.
Watching Harry carefully position the silver ribbon around the tree made Dog bark with laughter. It didn't look too bad, actually (apart from the fact it was now completely out of place against the bright lights and colourful baubles), but Harry's face as he placed it was a picture. His tongue poked out from between his teeth and his eyebrows furrowed as he concentrated so hard.
Draco grinned. “Not much of one. Anyway, I think you may have overreacted a little bit. What I was saying was hardly inflammatory. Personally, I thought it was quite tame.”
“Well, yes. He's Tony Stark, for Merlin's sake. Billionaire genius. Saves the world on a regular basis. Of course he's the best.”
“Shit. Potter. Harry! Wait! Harry!”
“One in thirteen million, three hundred and sixty-five thousand, nine hundred and twenty-five,” Malfoy said with a straight face. “I looked it up: the chances of Harry Potter choosing the same Muggle holiday as me, in the same resort and the same week. And choosing the same lounger.”
Harry and Draco were sat around a table in their usual pub, surrounded by their friends. They were celebrating Harry finally finding a new place to live.
Harry shook his head. “No need,” he said, gesturing to his test results on the counter.
“I saw you. I saw you wrapped around that little bastard.”
But, yes, Draco thought, he fucking would.
“My turn,” Draco growled as he grabbed his wand and climbed onto the bed.
Harry doused the small flame and peeled the brochure off the wall. Drying it with a wave of his wand, Harry reeled back in shock at what he held in his hands.
All thoughts of a nap flew from Dog's mind as he pondered the possibilities. Harry was always so easy to torment, but with the added pressure of the sparkles, it was going to be awesome. Dog's tail wagged happily and he barely even noticed. It was time to have some fun.
“Which, correct me if I'm wrong,” Crookshanks said, towering over Mrs Norris, who skittered back a few inches, “is their
Lily rolled her eyes. “Don't call me that. And Draco said that Albus' hair was an
Harry shrugged and clinked his glass to Draco's. Champagne for a ball in the groin. He could cope with that.
“And I like you.”
In fact, Ron even invited them to the match the following day, and Hermione asked them to meet her for dinner afterwards. Harry was back to thinking that he had the best friends a guy could ask for.
Harry couldn't help the small gasp escaping his lips. “
“In this session,” Glinda continued, ignoring the mutters, “we'll be carrying on from what we did yesterday. But instead of sharing secrets, I would like you to share your hopes and dreams for the future. Your deepest wishes, if you will.”
Harry did the mature thing and stuck his tongue out. Once they were both dressed, Harry grabbed hold of Draco and tried to kiss him.
They were kissing.
Zach had a strange expression on his face. Harry couldn't decide whether it was annoyance, exasperation or anger. When he thought over Zach's recent behaviour, Harry thought it might be all three. He would have to have a talk with him. Zach seemed to be perfectly happy when around Harry, but when anybody else turned up, he'd turn quite sullen.
Draco took Harry's hand and whispered something into his ear that he sincerely hoped his friends didn't hear. Harry kissed Draco hard and soon relaxed back into his seat. Draco knew how to calm Harry down. And if he had to find a bloody Captain America costume to do so, so be it.
the curtain. What could it be? A painting? A plaque? Oh, Merlin.
As soon as Draco walked into the dining room, he noticed that dinner would be different. Instead of tables set for two, there was a long table, set with silverware and glasses, for everyone. The major change was evident when Draco read the names on the little place cards in front of each seat.
“I think we've established that.”
“We knew that someone was stalking you—had it in for you. The threats were credible and they were accelerating. It had to be someone close to you; the letters had too much detail to be from some random crazy.”
Once they'd left the pub, Harry would always go home, say goodnight to Ron, climb into bed and dream of Draco. Harry knew that he wasn't fooling his friends; he knew that they noticed his small grimaces when a man ran his hand down his arm, or the way his smiles didn't reach his eyes. His friends were his friends for a reason; they were just there, keeping him company and trying their best to make him laugh.
“What else?” Hedwig asked, not entirely sure she wanted to hear the answer.
Thoughts of Draco, and the belt, made Harry open the door before that could happen. Harry groaned as he caught sight his three favourite women. Hermione was holding up a three-piece suit, the colour of which he had been repeatedly told 'brought out his eyes'. Ginny had a set of expensive looking robes slung over her arm; Harry was slightly scared of the number of buttons along the front. Pansy was brandishing her wand, a hairbrush and a bottle of green goo. The bottle had a picture of a witch with long sleek locks on the side. Harry was petrified.
“Come on, Draco. You know you're an attractive man. It can't be a surprise that I might like you.” Harry couldn't believe he'd said it. He must be drunk, to be admitting such things.
In pubs and workplaces all over the country, the latest films were the hot topic of conversation. And The Avengers had a whole generation of witches and wizards enthralled.
Darius stood up a little straighter and glared at Hedwig. “I dropped Pig off easily enough, but Miss Parkinson saw me in the Slytherin common room and wanted to smooth my feathers. It would have been rude to ignore her.”
“For reasons you need not know, Professor Dumbledore thought that it was time for the school to unite and for that, he needed Mr Potter and Mr Malfoy to become friendly. It couldn't have gone better. I commend you on your marvellous work.”
“Ah, Draco and Harry, yes?”
“What?”
Harry laughed shakily. “No. No. But Draco, I'm sorry; I'm so sorry. I'll make it up—”
“I just thought... Are you sure you haven't seen me all weekend?”
Draco wriggled free of Harry's grasp and tried to get up without waking him. What he needed was to have a wash and find some medicine for his head. The last thing Draco needed was for Harry to wake up in his arms again.
“No,” Weasley said quickly. “Nothing like that. She wasn't trying to hurt you; she didn't send the letters. She didn't actually know that she was doing anything wrong. You see, she had a secret boyfriend she didn't want anyone to know about. Zacharias Smith.”
“Huh?”
Draco, knowing what to expect this time, was completely prepared for dinner. Harry had suggested a quick swim after the afternoon session, but Draco had declined and instead they settled for a quick walk around the grounds. He and Harry were going to be first to dinner, and that was the end of it. Draco didn't even change his clothes.
Before the rest of the students or teachers could react, a buzz went around the Hall as copies of the Prophet were passed around. Most of the Slytherin students had
“Glinda!” Draco called out, running out of the door.
“Potter?”
Before Draco could do anything else, Harry spoke. “Draco was the first—well, second, if you count Hagrid—wizard I spoke to properly. He was certainly the first person to tell me about wizarding culture. Can you believe I'd never heard about Quidditch?”
All Bets Are Off
“Sorry,” Draco said at a much more normal volume. “Can we have another minute, please?”
“Okay, okay. Did you know that Ginny fancied you in school?”
“No. Yes. I was drunk?” It was a question, not a statement.
The moment Draco woke up, he wished he hadn't. Yes, he'd slept all night, and well, but he felt as if he'd been kicked in the head by a hippogriff. His mouth tasted like something had crawled in during the night and died, and his right arm was numb. As he finally managed to open his eyes, Draco realised why.
? Had Draco visited him as well? Or, Harry thought with horror, had Malfoy just been playing a joke on him all along?
It lasted five days. Five glorious days of seeing Potter's spotted boxers whenever he said my name. You'd have thought that he'd have figured it out, but no. He still said my name, and he still dropped his trousers. Brilliant. And it would have continued if it wasn't for Weasley.
Draco smiled at Grenville. He had tried hard to break him out of the 'Master Draco,' to no avail. He was much too old, and after serving his father for so long, much too well trained. Draco had given up and just humoured the old elf.
Granger—Hermione—she was a lot easier than I ever thought to get along with. I'd always thought her an uptight little witch who knew too much for her own good. She did, of course, know too much, but she used that knowledge to help her friends and I'd never met a more fiercely loyal person before. I grew to like her very much, as did Daphne. Apparently, they had the same problem with their hair or something. I don't know what it was exactly, but they bonded over whatever it was immediately.
“Gah! Cold!”
The door creaked as Draco came back in, his wand obviously hidden in his bunched-up towel.
It was the new found closeness—the closer relationship he shared with Malfoy since Draco had arrived—that stopped Harry from telling Draco to bugger off and asking Malfoy out. He had always thought that one day, he'd bite the bullet and risk asking Malfoy out. But this way, Harry was risking nothing. He was finding out how great it was being in a relationship with Draco without losing his friendship. It might be selfish, but Harry didn't think of it—didn't
“Good point,” Harry said, laughing quietly. “Sorry.”
The next few days passed without incident. Harry didn't purposely seek him out, but if he managed to run into Draco at the pool, well, it would be rude not to talk to him. For hours. And it really wasn't Harry's fault that he and Draco always managed to turn up in the dining hall at the same time. Despite his words to Ron and Hermione, Harry found it was nice to have
Loud chatter broke out as the crowd clamoured over each other to get out of the restaurant. Harry didn't follow, he simply looked at Draco and frowned.
Harry swayed on his feet. “No. But I think I'm drunk.”
Divorce. It was a weird thing to be thinking about on his wedding day, but Harry couldn't help it. He'd grown up thinking it was one of the worst things that could happen in the world. Aunt Petunia always seemed to think so, anyway. She thought it a friendship-ending crime and would take glee in talking nastily about it to anyone who would listen. When Mr and Mrs Perkins from number sixty-three announced their separation, she forbade Dudley from playing with David and encouraged her gossiping cronies to shun the poor woman.
“Who's going to go first?” Harry asked when they had taken seats as far away from the group as they could manage. “Toss a coin?”
~1600
“Hermione, let it go!” Ron said.
“Well, the stake-out was a rousing success.”
“Hey, now, you know the rules. No details about what you two get up to, and I don't tell you about the time Hermione—”
“Are you ever going to tell him? He can't seriously think you make your money writing textbooks.”
Harry refused to look at Hermione. He could only imagine the grin she had on her face.
“Seriously, what am I missing?” Draco asked the group at large. “I was under the impression it was badly written, unrealistic stories simply written to wet the knickers of middle aged women. Sorry, Ginny.”
Hedwig looked at Bob as if he'd grown an extra head. It wasn't that many hours ago that he'd assigned them the extra agents himself.
He trailed off as Draco walked down the stairs and stood beside Harry.
Hermione had a smile on her face as she finally drifted off to sleep that night. Ron was a genius. Harry simply needed to see that they were sorry, it had just been a shock, and that it could be the same as it had been before they'd left. The three of them—what had people (Draco) called them back when they were in school? The Golden Trio—it could,
Harry laughed. “After the war and all that stuff was over, everyone—Ron, Hermione, all his family—assumed that I'd marry Ginny and have little red-headed babies. Well, everyone but Ginny did. She was happily off with Neville and didn't want any babies. And I didn't care. I expected to be upset, but I wasn't.”
Harry stammered out an apology and moved to touch Draco.
“Has Harry Potter finally escaped from the sham relationship he had with Death Eater, Draco Malfoy to find love with another? Your reporter has evidence that indeed he has.”
Draco couldn't help but grin as waiters brought out bottles of wine along with the platters of food. If he was going to have to talk to people other than Harry, he was glad he wouldn't have to do it sober.
Anyway, McGonagall then took over, silencing the uproar with only a stern glare and a twiddle of her glasses (again, I wasn't there) and informed the old wizards and witches that she fully intended to reopen Hogwarts in September, and would need her students back.
Draco was taken aback by Harry's thoughtfulness. Had he been that obvious?
Harry was an idiot—a hopeful idiot, but an idiot nonetheless—to think that people wouldn't care. Optimism meant nothing when faced with judgemental wizards with long memories.
“No, you always call me Malfoy. Draco was different. It wasn't me, not really.”
To say that Draco had been surprised to wake up curled around Harry was an understatement. Thankfully, they were fully dressed and on top of the covers, but that didn't actually help. Harry had woken up a few seconds after Draco, taken note of their body positions and ran to the bathroom. It had not only looked as if Draco had been cuddling him, but also watching him sleep. Just great.
been a long time since he'd followed a naked man anywhere.
“Ow! I don't do it like that. I do it like this.”
Harry nodded his head and sat down. He really could do with seeing Hermione. She always knew what to say. She'd been the first person he talked to when he realised he liked men, after all.
Kissing Draco was better than Harry could have ever had imagined. And kissing him against a wall was so much better than awkward kisses over a pub table. Their noses bumped and their tongues battled and it was fucking fantastic. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's waist and pulled him close. Harry slipped one hand into Draco's hair and deepened the kiss; one leg sliding between Draco's. Gasping, Draco slid his arms down until his hands were resting on Harry's arse.
Harry was torn between screwing his face up in disgust and laughing out loud at the towel rule. It made sense but he really didn't want to think about other people's sweat on the loungers.
“Yes. It's time.”
. He hadn't seen Hermione since Christmas; her workload had been too tough for her to visit him in the recent months. Harry practically ran into the pub, and straight to the table they usually sat at.
Harry fought down a blush as Draco turned towards him and bestowed an even brighter smile on him.
Normal, that is, until she and Ron returned home. Their life was in Australia, after all. Maybe she could persuade Harry to visit them. Once Harry saw what it was like, Hermione was sure, he'd fall in love, just as they had.
“Gay. Me. Maybe. Men kissing men kind of gay. Not the happy kind. Although I am happy. Do people still use gay for happy? Maybe I watch too many old films. Anyway, I—”
“Everyone knows,” Ron continued, “that the Hulk is the best. I mean, come on. He's the bloody Hulk. Pure strength.”
“So,” Harry said, pouring the last of the whisky into their glasses, “have you got a boyfriend who is going to be pissed off that you've been to marriage counselling with another man?”
“Ha, you mean while you were insulting Ron?”
Harry was having a fantastic time in the pool. He had always loved swimming, and swimming in the nude was glorious. It reminded him of the time he had gone in the prefects bath but without the bubbles. And the ghost. The sun was beating down on him and Harry dragged himself out of the cooling water to get a drink. He briefly considered going for his towel but as he looked around at his fellow guests lounging and walking around without a second thought to covering up, Harry relented and walked to the bar naked.
