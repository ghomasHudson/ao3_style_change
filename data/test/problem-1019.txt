"He did," Pansy confirmed.  She paused and stubbed her cigarette out on the floor and offered him her arm.  "Now stop brooding and escort a lady back inside.  I'm dying of thirst, and there's a redhead in there I've got my eye on."
Harry is halfway through bagging up Mrs Morrison's order before she begins her monthly ritual of matchmaker.  It can't be that she's ignorant of his sexual preferences – there isn't a person in Britain unaware of that thanks to the
In truth, Draco didn't need to work.  The Malfoy coffers had made it through the war very much unscathed, and even during Lucius's incarceration, Narcissa had managed the family funds with startling aplomb.  The fact was Draco enjoyed his work.  Yes, initially he'd balked at the idea of gainful employment, but the drive to rebuild the family name had motivated him.  His choices had been limited – with the Ministry being completely out of the question.  But while few would trust a Malfoy with power, many it turned out, would trust him with money.
Draco snapped his attention back to Pansy in surprise.  He'd been so engrossed in his task that he hadn't been listening.
"A few times," Draco said after a moment. "After the war I was like Pansy, wanting to face people down, brazen it out…"
"Why not?"  Harry bristled at the implication of Ron's words.  "He wants to move out and so do I.  So I asked him if he wanted to share a flat.  What's not normal about that?"
"He's a good man, Severus.  It took me a long time to realise it, too long, but now that I do, I'd rather he wasn’t subjected to your tantrums on a daily basis."
Harry carefully Levitated the last of the trunks into the spare room.  As it landed with a soft thud, he let out a sigh of relief.  Whilst magic definitely made these things easier, there was still a certain amount of strain involved – especially with the number of items he'd had to move that afternoon.
To this day, Harry considered it the best decision he ever made.  Not only did it allow him to attend numerous Quidditch games under the guise of work, but it also brought him into daily contact with Draco.
Blaise sank onto one of the leather barstools at the counter.  "Who are you and what have you done with Draco Malfoy?"
"Indeed."  The doors opened and Draco led the way back out into the fresh air.  "But there is an invisible shield around each balcony, so while you'd be able to fly up and away on your broom, nothing would be able to drop – children included."
, but then there was a loud pop, and cold fizzy liquid was spilling all over his torso.  He didn't have a chance to protest before Draco was trailing his tongue through the mess he had created, lapping at Harry's skin, and paying particular attention to his nipples.
Hermione returned the hug and then gave him a stern look. "You'll see me on Tuesday," she said.  "You and Ron."
"You keep trying," Pansy snapped, glare returning. "You're not going to walk away and leave me to clean up your mess. He thinks you don't care, he's
Blaise and Hermione shared a small smile between themselves before looking across the table. "Well, there's only one person I can think of who's ever held Draco's interest for any length of time, and who'd be brave enough to risk his sharp tongue."
"Indeed."  The Malfoys themselves had escaped such punitive punishments, but only because Lucius had been forced to
Pansy's laugh was throaty and utterly unfazed.   "I do indeed, Potter."  She slid off the desk and looked around. "Ah, Baker." She snagged the arm of a passing Auror. "Escort a lady to the holding cells, would you?"
Usually Harry avoided making eye contact with strangers, so he hadn't noticed the glares until Malfoy pointed them out.
"Stop that. And stop sulking, too. Anyone would think Draco had asked you for a kidney, not for the chance to do his job." She turned on the tap and held the kettle under the flow of water. "The job
Fireworks burst to life around them, but all Harry could focus on was the softness of Draco’s lips, the slick tease of his tongue, and the heat radiating off his body where they were pressed together.  There were loud cheers for the fireworks, but Harry was pretty sure the wolf whistle (thank you, Ron) was meant for them.  He had a vague thought that maybe they were making a bit of a spectacle and they should find somewhere a little more private, but then Draco’s hands slid inside his robes, hot against the cool flesh, and Harry really didn’t care anymore.
"It's about bollocks," Ron says from somewhere behind Harry, because naturally they were the first to be split up.
"Kick a man while he's down, why don't you."  Harry turned to Draco again.  "Aren't you going to stick up for me?"
He was nothing if not stubborn when he wanted to be, and Harry was determined not to let this momentum slide. He was going to become friends with Draco Malfoy whether Malfoy liked it or not. Though, to be fair, Malfoy seemed to be pretty receptive to the idea himself. He'd certainly been far more approachable at work recently, even if he had taken great delight in
“That’s true.” Ron spun to face his friend, eyes wide, his mouth already watering at the prospect.  “Can’t believe I didn’t think of it before.”
"Here," Potter murmured quietly.  "Let me."  His voice was soft, and his attention focussed solely on Draco's hand, which he now cradled as if it were something precious.
"Harry's been slaving over a hot stove all afternoon."  Hermione glanced quickly in the direction of the stairs and then turned back to Draco, her expression suddenly serious.  "I'm not asking for details," she said quietly.  "But I need to know that you're serious about this.  I won't let you—"
"Oh." Ron relaxed, visibly relieved, before a frown marred his face moments later. "But hang on, where the hell am I going to find someone daft enough to spend time with Malfoy? Willingly? Never mind that he wouldn't give the time of day to anyone I know."
"Nothing." Harry stabbed the straw viciously into his carton of pumpkin juice. "That's the bloody problem. He just sits there mooning over Pansy Parkinson
"I believe you'll find Draco in the library," Narcissa spoke as the doors swung open heavily. "It is the third door on your left."
"How come Granger lets you keep an elf?"Malfoy asks around a fresh slice of toast – Kreacher had been only too happy to wait on the 'Malfoy boy'.
Normally Harry would have been grateful to hear concern in the voice of his erstwhile rival, but at that point Blaise opened his mouth and Harry realised he'd been given just the opportunity he'd been looking for.
The owl fluttered around the room several times, before coming to land beside Harry's plate.  It held out one leg and eyed Harry's food hopefully.   Harry grinned.
Harry winced. He had considered waking Draco before he left, but he hadn't wanted to give himself time to change his mind.  "At the Ministry."
Potter's smile faded a little and he shrugged.  "I've tried," he said.  "But every time I think of something that I want, something else occurs to me that changes my mind.  It's like every positive has a negative, and I can't decide."
He didn't flush. Wouldn't give her the satisfaction. He just gave her a look that promised dire retribution. "Some of us like to look our best," he replied as loftily as possibly, and didn't miss the considering look that Potter gave him.
"This must come as a very pleasant surprise for you, then."  Draco approaches the till, all lean limbs and stylish clothes.  But it's his expression that gets Harry every time.  A warm smile from Draco Malfoy was unheard of at one time, but in the six months that he's worked for
With a flourish, Kreacher shook out a scroll of parchment.  "Mrs Wheezy was dropping it off earlier.  And was giving Kreacher very strict instructions that you is not to stay in tonight."
"We'll be fine."  Draco gave a curt nod to match his tone and then headed from the room; he was relieved to hear the Floo roar to life behind him.
"Of course I am, Mother.  You know that.  But it is a little unexpected for you to turn up at school, unannounced, on a Thursday evening."
“Ginny.”  Harry smiled – they were far enough from their break up that he could do that without pain now.  “You look lovely.”  And she really did.  The gold in her dress complimented her hair perfectly.  But it was an abstract observation, and he was relieved to feel no attraction remained.
"I should probably go and check on him," Harry said ruefully. "Don't want him having an aneurism or anything." He pulled away from Draco reluctantly, who let him go with matching regret. "I won't be long," he said, and headed off in search of his probably traumatised flatmate.
But silence had never been Draco's strong point, and as it seemed to stretch out ahead of him with no discernable end in sight, he cracked.
After what seemed like an eternity to Harry, Draco let out a soft snort.  "You couldn't afford me," he muttered.  "And don't think that's getting you out of the washing up."
Luna’s smile turned a little smug. “No harm at all.  In fact, I think you should do rather more than just look.”
Malfoy leant back against the windowsill and gave Harry a long, appraising look. "Let's just say I recognised that you needed a firmer hand."
He found himself guided carefully onto the mattress, and then Potter was kneeling over him, lowering his head until their lips met again.  When this time Potter's tongue traced its way along Draco's bottom lip, he didn't hesitate.  Almost sighing into the kiss, he opened his mouth and revelled in the feel of Potter's tongue slick against his own.
"Thank you for clearing that mystery up for me."  Draco held back the eye roll with great restraint, and so allowed a hint of sarcasm to colour his tone as reward.  "I can see perfectly well
Her smile brightened then, turned almost genuine.  “Excellent.  I’m glad we had this little chat.  I’ve no doubt we’ll be seeing a lot more of each other soon.”
lying about the office, he was likely to explode – and say things his mother would make him regret later.
Harry smiled despite himself.  It was nice to be around someone who didn't consider Auror training the be-all and end-all of life – Ron would never understand Harry's hesitancy about the job; not because he didn't want to, he just couldn't get his head around it.
"Leave the boy alone, Molly."   Harry breathed a sigh of relief as Arthur entered the conversation.  He accepted the outstretched hand, and subsequent hearty shake.
tone she'd learnt from his bloody mother. She smoothed one hand over his shoulder, allowing the fabric to run between finger and thumb. "They bring out your eyes," she said. "Don't they, Potter?"
"Didn't you hear what I said?"  Harry ignored the pointed remark, and swept past Draco into his flat.
Hermione opened her mouth and Harry's heart sank – clearly she had no intention of being put off that easily.  But then, Ron slumped onto the bench at Harry's other side and gave an incredibly loud yawn.
Satisfied his momentary lapse of dignity had gone unnoticed, he pulled his shoulders back and settled his robes into place with well-practised fingers.
"What?"  Harry demanded.  He'd heard Malfoy's apologies before, and they hadn't made any difference then either.  Words were cheap and entirely meaningless when he had no intention of changing.
But Malfoy remained unfazed, and dismissed Harry's words with a wave of his hand. "Just remember, you are not to touch her. Not unless I issue an embossed invitation to do so, which believe me, will never happen."
It was said without any expectation of a positive answer, but Harry racked his brain anyway.  He thought firstly of the spare room in George's flat, but dismissed it instantly.  George was making an effort lately, but Harry had a strong suspicion that that room remained the same as it had when Fred left it.  It occurred to Harry that he was rattling around in a big house, which seemed even bigger and more lonely since Ron left.
"Can we change the subject please?" Harry asked sharply, his face flushed.  Just because they were in a Muggle cafe, didn't mean he wanted people overhearing things like that.
She turned to leave and Harry was suddenly conscious of the fact it was just him and Malfoy now, and he racked his brain desperately for something to say.  Malfoy, on the other hand, seemed to have no such qualms.  He picked his pint from the bar and gestured to the empty tables.
“Harry’s pissed because Luna’s seen your cock,” Ginny said and Draco laughed disbelievingly, looking between the three of them.
“I’m still mad at you for not telling,” she mumbled into his shoulder, "but congratulations, dickhead."
“Fucking add another one, don’t prat around, Potter”, Draco hissed, back dipping, so Harry pulled his finger out before working two in, twisting them down until he could feel the throbbing nub of Draco’s prostate. He rubbed the tips of his fingers over it roughly, cock straining at the low groan Draco let out, his head dropping forward so that it hung between his shoulders, exposing the back of his neck where a dark flush was creeping.
It felt like coming home, the way Draco’s mouth parted beneath his, the way his velvety tongue ran along Harry’s bottom lip, groaning softly as Draco curled it around his own. A proper kiss, not a hard, vicious one like before- this was just as desperate, but for completely different reasons.
, Harry!” Ron cried, flinging his arm around Harry’s shoulders to yank him across the bench and into a tight hug. “Bloody brilliant, I can’t believe it!”
,” Harry laughed, choked up but desperate to get it right, “you’re also the reason I get up every morning, you’re the reason my cheeks hurt from laughing every day, you’re the reason I finally know what unconditional love is- to have it, to feel it, and to reciprocate it just as strongly. You’re my person, Draco, and I know you don’t believe in soulmates, but I’m pretty sure you’re mine. I want to spend the rest of my life with you, so what do you say...should we make this permanent?”
“I’m so happy you said yes,” he laughed against Draco’s lips a minute later and Draco half-laughed, half-sobbed, shaking his head.
“Would you like some water, Harry? I’m afraid you’ve gone very red,” Luna said and Harry forced his eyes from Draco to look at her, mind still embarrassingly vacant.
Blaise tapped the side of his nose with a smirk, signalling secrecy, but his gaze slid to a spot behind them. Harry and Draco twisted around to find a ridiculously attractive couple sitting at a small coffee shop table just beyond their wards, bent over it to talk to one another. They appeared to be in their early forties; the man in a tight white shirt, rolled-up sleeves showing off a deep tan. He was holding hands with a woman harry assumed to be his wife, who was clad in skin-tight red dress that matched her tall stiletto heels, her long dark hair shining
“You two have fun tonight, because I know I will,” she said with one last wicked smile before jumping up, brushing grass from her tiny, glittery skirt as she stood. “
Eyes burning, he looked away, blushing slightly under Ron's gaze, which had turned overly sympathetic.
“Is, yes, but they’re not really a reflection of everyone, unfortunately. See those people over there?” He pointed to a group of wardens across the street, laughing together as they had their photo taken.” They’re keeping us safe, ok? And the Muggle police are here somewhere, so they will be too.”
“I’m so very happy for you, Harry,” Luna said, appearing at his side, her face lit up with a gentle kind of happiness only she could radiate. “Your engagement is the second best thing to happen this week, isn’t it, love?” She stood on her tiptoes to kiss Harry on the cheek as Ginny released him with one last squeeze, wiping away what he assumed was pink face paint with her thumb.
he is,” he added with a derisive chuckle when Ron pulled a face that suggested he’d thought about checking the bathroom too.
you. We have so much fun, and I hate that you stay here all alone when you should be celebrating too. You deserve to be a part of it, and I want to share the experience with you. It feels wrong, celebrating love without the person I love the most.’
Still, it wasn’t enough, and Harry’s hands felt empty, aching, the need to touch every part of Draco, to grab and pull and rub almost maddening. Without preamble, he shoved them both under the tight waistband of Draco’s trousers, filling his palms with the taut muscle of Draco’s arse and squeezing roughly, massaging his cheeks in broad circles as he began to nose his way down Draco’s chest, exposed by his open shirt, revelling in the feel of him as if this wasn’t a man he’d fucked a thousand times before. It felt different, somehow,
Inhaling the musky scent of Draco's cologne, he began pressing small, wet kisses to the soft skin under his lips and Draco shifted, sliding a leg in between Harry’s, sighing as their cocks brushed against one another. Harry lifted his head, searching Draco’s shining eyes, and after finding what he was looking for, leant forward, pressing his lips to Draco’s.
Harry chuckled, drawing his attention away from Draco to look at Ron properly.. “Yeah, me too. He owed me though, after this morning.”
It was daft, really- all he’d done was ask Draco a question and put a ring on his finger. Nothing had changed since that morning, or a day prior, or the week previous.
He looked down at his own plain, Muggle suit, brushing off a speck of soot and almost (but not quite) wishing he’d taken Ginny’s advice and come as ‘Sexy Voldemort’.
to ignore the raging situation in his trousers. Draco scoffed, fruity breath tickling Harry’s cheek as he turned his head to glare at him with disdain.
All he received in response was an eye roll, before Draco turned, pressing his back to Harry’s chest. Instinctively Harry’s hands came up to grip his waist, pulling them flush together, gyrating his hips slightly and drawing a low hum from Draco.
“Seen so many…people like us.” Draco’s eyes found his and he smiled, shaking his head in wonderment. “I didn’t know- I didn’t realise- is this what Muggles are like?”
"Speaking of, I’m expecting you to de-glitter mine later on,” he murmured with a wink and Harry’s mouth fell open, frustrated and slightly horny and unable to do anything about it as Draco began to laugh.
He reckoned he should have felt angrier, pondering the thought as he ran his tongue over a tight, pink nipple, humming as Draco arched with a gasp against his mouth, hands now clutching at his hair. He sucked on it absentmindedly, feeling strangely calm, the uncomfortable, prickly feeling gone, sedated now that he had Draco so close. Turning his attention to the other nipple, he lapped at it, still kneading Draco’s arse with a bruising grip, before sliding a finger between his cheeks to pet at his tiny, furled hole.
boring,” he drawled, ducking behind Harry when Pansy threw a kazoo at his head and flipping everyone off as they laughed.
“You’re thinking too hard again- just say what comes to mind. Tell him how you feel. Tell him what you told me five minutes ago!”
“You won’t finish that sentence if you know what’s good for you,” he snapped and she cackled, sliding an arm around Luna’s shoulders.
“Hmm. I am, I suppose.” There was a beat of silence before she looked at him and, despite her flushed cheeks and flyaway hair and glittery face paint, Harry could see that she was. She sighed, looking back at Draco and Luna, slipping her hand into Harry’s and resting her cheek on his shoulder. “I wasn’t sure we’d get here, you know,” she said softly, “either of us. After we ended things and before I discovered the joys of tribadism, I thought that was it- I think after you live through a war, it’s hard to imagine a better future. A brighter one. And now...well, I’ve got a nest-full of feathery kids and you’re about to spend all your money on a wedding for the fussiest man on the planet, so I’d say we did alright, despite everything.”
With that, he tossed Harry’s bottle of pumpkin juice back before striding past them, shimmering slightly as he passed through the wards.
he wouldn't let him get away with such a request without torturing him first- he’d entered with absolutely nothing else on.
Harry had half a mind to check he hadn’t fled out of the bathroom window, or worse, apparated to safety up in Wiltshire.
To Harry’s surprise, Draco blushed, eyes panicked as he looked at Harry before glaring up at Blaise.
“I’ll leave you two lovebirds to it,” Ginny said as Draco excused himself from Luna and Dean, making his way over to them. She left Harry stood all alone, watching her congratulate Draco with a big hug before letting him go and bounding over to join the others. Draco caught Harry’s eye again and before he could blink Draco had all but
Maybe Draco hadn’t counted on confrontation- which was daft, given the typical side effects of the spell- but confrontation was what he was going to get.
Except...Harry’s mouth refused to cooperate. His tongue felt like it was glued to the roof of his mouth, and rather than the “hello, Draco” he’d been planning, all that came out was an undignified “nggggh.”
made it sexy!” Draco insisted, lifting his head, and Harry laughed, unsure if the statement or the half-hearted glare that accompanied it was funnier.
if you don’t propose to that man in the next thirty seconds I will march over there and do it myself,” Ron hissed, gesturing at Draco with his water bottle and channelling so much of Hermione it brought Harry right back down to Earth.
“Fucking hell, I’ll personally be avoiding the both of you until the big day- you’re going to be unbearable.”
anything, it’s just a gift. Here.” Harry pressed the sticker to Draco’s chest, smoothing it down with two fingers. “It’s holographic, so it’ll change colour in the sun. It’s cute!”
after so many years of adamant refusal. In hindsight, gifting his extremely attractive Slytherin boyfriend a pair of extremely tiny shorts was possibly not his smartest idea, but Draco would look gorgeous no matter what he had on and, to be quite honest, the view was fantastic.
Head spinning, he planted his feet more firmly on the ground, arm thrown out to steady himself against the kitchen island. There was no counter spell he could cast, but he willed himself to ignore it, knowing he just needed to get out of the room- some fresh air and a glass of water would help, as long as he avoided Draco at all costs. Simple.
“Fuck. Fuck!' Harry laughed incredulously, scrubbing a hand over his face. "Ok. Yeah, ok. I can do this.”
“Draco Lucius Malfoy,” Harry started, thankful his voice sounded much steadier than he felt, “you are possibly the most infuriating, egotistical, cold-hearted bastard I've ever met. You’ve never learnt how to make my coffee properly, you insist on picking my outfits for me, and you leave hair potions on every available surface but claim
“Yes! I mean yeah, yes, everything’s fine. I’m glad you’re having fun- what were you and Luna shouting about?”
Harry was barely listening, using the opportunity to peel the clingy leather over the curve of his arse, shoving it down to his thighs and spinning him so that they were both stood facing the large mirror above the sink.
“Of course I miss you, you idiot,” he murmured against them, tracing a finger down Draco’s cheek. “I didn’t want you to leave in the first place.”
Draco slid a hand between Harry’s parted legs to fondle his balls, rolling them with the tips of his fingers the way he knew Harry liked, pulling off to run his tongue up the underside of his cock.
, darlings, I really am so pleased for you both- I’ll owl you the wedding binder tomorrow, Draco, after you’ve finished celebrating,” she added with a wink, letting go of Draco’s hand to fluff her fringe. She slid a hand into her bra, adjusting herself so that she was even more on display and running her tongue across her teeth, dabbing at her glittery red lips with the tip of a finger.
“Arsehole,” Harry murmured, kissing him again, realising with a jolt that he’d officially be doing so for the rest of his life. The thought made his stomach clench with a strange kind of joy that only confirmed he’d made the greatest decision of his life, and that really was saying something. He’d never felt elation so strong, felt like he could just float away, his arms wrapped around the man he loved more than he thought possible.
He watched as Draco’s eyes, hooded with desire, fluttered shut, spit-slicked lips parted on a silent cry as Harry nudged his prostate with every thrust of his hips. He didn’t know where to look, torn between watching ecstasy bloom across Draco's face, or watching his own cock as it disappeared again and again between Draco’s wobbling cheeks, his rim pink and swollen where it stretched around Harry.
He stopped speaking when Ron coughed pointedly, lowering his voice. "Do you have any idea how fucking hot you look?”
A single tear rolled down Draco’s cheek as he nodded frantically, reaching down and cupping Harry’s face to urge him up off the ground. Harry wobbled slightly, his brain suddenly turned to mush, steadied when Draco slid both hands into his hair and crushed their lips together in a kiss so fierce it felt like a promise.
“What did he ask? Did he hear us?” Ron asked, eyes following Draco as he began to summon food from the many bags Hermione had packed.
Abruptly, Harry came, too far gone to give a warning; he groaned as he jerked pathetically, stomach muscles rippling, his orgasm so intense he felt like crying for a second time.
Draco huffed a disbelieving laugh, trying to scowl but failing enormously, pressing a trembling hand over his mouth.
Ron just shook his head, taking a bite of the sausage roll, pastry flakes falling and sticking to his fur. “Sorry, mate, I don’t get it. You just look normal. A bit fancier than normal, mind, with the suit and everything—”
He pulled the hot pants out from behind his back, offering them out to Draco, who took them with an air of reluctance- or possibly disgust- that wasn’t all too surprising.
“Yes, we really have,” Draco replied on a yawn, tucking his head more firmly beneath Harry’s chin, who slid an arm around his waist.
child, I’d be worried. Bloody handsome Muggles.” He looked Harry up and down, Hermione’s snort of laughter going unnoticed, his extra fury brows furrowed. “So where’s your cape then?”
He waited for Draco to adjust, pausing for a second longer to admire the way he began to rut back against him, patience clearly wearing thin. Palms sweating, Harry began a steady rhythm, thrusting into Draco over and over and over until they were both groaning loudly.
In his defence, it was impossible to hide, because Draco had situated his leather-clad arse right against Harry’s groin.
Shaking the tension from his shoulders, he scolded himself internally for not getting a bloody grip- he'd faced
Hermione snorted, before promptly dissolving into more tears. "Oh, gosh, I don't- I don't know what's
sinking his teeth into the willowy curve of his neck. The bitter tang of sweat- and underneath, something sweeter, something he recognised- burst across his tongue as he sucked on the soft skin, biting and soothing until Draco began to shift underneath him, moaning softly, head lolling to one side, hips rolling lazily against the thigh Harry had shoved between his legs.
Draco smiled, plucking Harry’s bottom lip with his thumb. “A stupid amount. Merlin, I love you so fucking much.”
“Have you missed it, Draco?" He breathed hotly against his ear, "is that why we’re here? You need it that badly, this is what you’ve been reduced to?”
“Uh, ow?” He grouched and she rolled her eyes, giving his arm a vigorous rub. “And I wanted it to be a surprise, there's no way you could have kept quiet.”
His whole body lit up, nerve endings on fire, cock instantly, painfully hard. The force of it propelled him backwards, arse colliding with the counter behind him, all the air leaving his lungs at once. His skin
“Damn right,” Seamus said, squinting up at them, before poking Dean in the chest. “Why don’t you ever kiss me like that? Do I need sparkly?”
Harry followed his gaze and grinned, watching as Pansy spun Hermione in dizzying circles while Ron clapped a beat.
"I'd listen to Potter if I were you, Weasley.  Just because I've let you take a few liberties, doesn't mean I'm your messenger girl." With that, Pansy gave a toss of her sleek, dark hair, and turned on her heel.
Harry shovelled the porridge into his mouth quick-smart in an effort to buy a little breathing space.  It wasn't that he intended for Ron
It was a very content Draco Malfoy that Flooed home to the Manor at the end of the evening.  Not only had they made progress in identifying Harry's
"She doesn't really know," Harry said. "I mean, she knew I had the camera, of course. But not that I used it as much as I did. I didn't want to share it with anyone."
Eventually, though, Potter pulled away.  He reached out and snagged Draco's wand off the bedside table and cast a well-practised Cleaning Charm.
"Anyway," Malfoy continued, his expression turning a little more serious.  "As I was saying, we do things a little bit differently here than you might be expecting."  He paused, reached into a drawer at the side of him and removed a large binder which he placed on the desk.  "We have numerous properties on our books – both Wizarding and Muggle – which obviously we'll have you look through.  But we will also actively seek out your ideal house.  Some of our most successful sales have been with properties that weren't even on the market at the time."
"Where d'you want this putting?"  he grunted, giving a nod to the large tree he and George were currently manhandling.
Harry was surprised that Snape hadn't recognised his surroundings by now, but he supposed the different perspective and the absence of house-elf heads made all the difference.  "You're at Headquarters, sir; Grimmauld Place."
Feeling a pair of eyes watching him intently at that very moment, Harry turned and made his way back towards the bar.  As he crossed the room, Harry couldn't stop thinking about Draco.  His plan all along had been to ask his friend to dance, to lead him around the dance floor and see if he couldn't find something in Draco's eyes, something that would tell him if he was wasting his time or not.  But after three weeks spent living in such close contact, of seeing Draco every day, sometimes in various stages of undress, Harry wasn't sure he could be that close to Draco without exploding.
Clearly a minute was too long for Draco, because Harry heard footsteps behind him.  He tried to ignore it, and busied himself with filling the kettle, grabbing the mugs, and generally trying to keep his emotions in check.
The flush spread over Harry's face, only it was one of discomfort now. Malfoy was telling the truth, he knew that, but hearing it laid out so starkly illustrated just how rude his behaviour must seem. "I'll be there this Saturday," he said, with just a hint of defiance. "Till the end."
Harry's heart lodged somewhere in his throat – it had been doing that a lot lately. But having Draco in his living room, all mellow and relaxed and softly lit by the firelight, Harry had a feeling it would be there permanently now. "Glad I talked you into it, then?"
Ron finally turned away from the display clutching a small, cellophane wrapped box tightly in his hands.  "I imagine Malfoy's parents just want to make sure he gets himself a wife."
Harry unlooped his scarf and shrugged off his coat. Ignoring Malfoy's glare, he dropped them both of the sofa. "It was hardly a discussion. You ranted on for ten minutes and I said I'd think about it."
As he entered the hallway, Draco could feel himself being watched.  Turning around he found not one, but two pairs of beady eyes watching his every move.  Snape, he was used to; his ex-professor's presence was more of a draw for Draco than a bad thing.  But the amber eyes also watching him were new.
“What?” Draco repeated.  “You’re actually serious about this?  You really want to spend Christmas day eating stodgy pizza, drinking fizzy piss that’s masquerading as lager, and watching het porn with the Weasel?  Can you say the words
Draco could see the uncertainty, the fear of rejection in Harry's eyes, and the stab of guilt at knowing he was responsible was almost crippling.  "Yes," he replied firmly.  "More sure that I've ever been.  I want this; I want you."
When Snape finally descended into slurs about the Marauders, a topic he freely admitting using because of the reaction it got, Harry gave a quick wave of his wand and the red velvet curtains shut instantly.  The Silencing Charm woven into the fabric worked a treat, and from that moment Harry was able to relax in the peace and quiet of his own home.
They stayed like that for a few minutes. Wrapped in each other's arms, kissing languidly, with Potter's hand still firmly down Draco's trousers.
Harry's arms were warm and strong around Draco's waist, holding him firmly against a broad chest.  Their legs were tangled together, feet brushing teasing strokes along each other's calves.  And then there were Harry's lips, pressing the gentlest of kisses to Draco's neck – to that spot behind his ear that made Draco's entire body turn to jelly.
When he had first discovered Draco’s presence on the same floor of the Ministry building as his own offices, Harry had been overrun with mixed emotions.  The two of them had reached a sort of understanding during their last year at Hogwarts - mainly that they ignored each other’s presence whenever possible, and were painfully polite and correct when contact was unavoidable.
to notice the faint smile on Potter's face as he watched, Draco reached for his potions knife and set about shaping his quill into something resembling a point again.
on the bench's surface before seating himself at Harry's side.  "Any luck with the Board of Governors yet?"
"Well, isn't that charming?"  Blaise got slowly to his feet, smile shifting slightly into a smirk.  "I just came to see how your evening went.  Though judging from your expression when you Flooed in, I'd say it fulfilled a few of those furtive schoolboy fantasies of yours."
"In trouble with the boss, Weasley?" Pansy Parkinson perched on the edge of their desk, giving a flash of leg that left Harry unmoved but caused Ron to gulp visibly.
“No,” Draco replied calmly.  “I just have a very good memory.  Remember, I had the bed next to Theo’s at school, and he was never very handy with the Silencing Charms.”
Draco's other brow shot up in surprise at this.  "I don't see why not," he replied measuredly.  "But what happened to Christmas in Italy?"
"Yes, as it happens."  Blaise smirked in a familiar, maddening fashion. "Busy working out the department budgets for the next financial year.  So unless you want me to accidentally drop a nought off the end of yours, you'd better be nice."
"Oh, come on, Draco.  D'you really think he'd do things like that with you if he weren't in the slightest bit interested?  Why don't you just tell him?  What's the worst that could happen?"
"There were so many rooms that neither Mother nor I could bear to use. And being the social pariah's that we were, no decorator with any business sense would touch us. So I decided to do it myself. It was that or go crazy. It was nice to have a purpose at last."
A momentary hush fell over the table as all three occupants processed this piece of news.  Draco couldn’t help but feel sorry for Greg.  Millicent had been Vince’s on-off girlfriend back at Hogwarts, and with his death, she had almost instantly transferred her affections to his best friend.
Malfoy’s expression turned a mixture of pleased and surprised that his remark had been accepted in the right spirit.  Harry was beginning to learn that most of what he thought was sharp jabs were actually just Malfoy teasing, joking with friends.
"No," Hermione said.  "But she is your goddaughter, so it's only fair you share the burden.  Besides, I'm letting you decorate them."
Malfoy rubbed wearily at his face.  "Then ask Weasley.  He was raised with the same traditions, much as he'd like to pretend he wasn't."
Malfoy swaying precariously again when he entered the Floo was enough to make up Harry's mind, and he followed behind. "Budge up."
Draco shook his head and made a strange sort of clucking noise with his tongue.  He did, however, manage to hold back a disparaging remark about
"I thought you'd take the chance to relax, have a bit of fun.  Honestly, Harry, you're eighteen, not eighty.  You should try acting like a kid while you still can."
He spoke so quietly that Harry had to lean in closer to hear. The sentiment expressed was one Harry could well sympathise with. He'd been the object of people's scrutiny since entering the wizarding world, but it never got any easier. So he looked up to see if a well-placed glare could dissuade whoever it was. But as he looked at the situation around them, a smile spread over his face.
Hermione turned to examine the delicate, glass ornaments .  "Those?  They were an early Christmas present from Draco.  Traditional Wizarding ornaments, apparently."
"Oh, I see."  Harry was sure his voice was a little higher than usual – apparently feigning innocence was not his strong suit.  "It's just that you two work together, socialise together... I just thought..."
Pansy shrugged.  "She's never been that keen on it, really – just an excuse to eat, drink, and spend a fortune, she says."
There was an awkward silence between the two of them as the sound of Granger's retreating footsteps echoed away.  Potter made no effort to unpack his belongings or retake his seat, but neither did he bolt for the nearest exit – which was something, Draco supposed.

Harry clenched his teeth and turned around.  He was surprised to find the young girl who worked behind the counter in
spit in his food, but he'd be happier not to have to put it to the test.  Swinging his legs over the side of the bed, Harry buried his feet in a pair of fluffy, red slippers, and tried his hardest not to be distracted by the tiny gold snitches zooming around on their surface.
Draco muttered the words under his breath.  He had no desire for his companion to overhear, or indeed ask any incredibly awkward questions that Draco would
"Where did you say you were going again?"  Harry looked up from the comprehensive list of rules and contact numbers that Hermione had provided.  Honestly, he thought, after five years of helping to raise Teddy, he was more than capable of watching Rose for one night.
"What?" Ron looked at Harry in confusion, words muted by the mouthful of pie he was currently chewing.
"You're a frightful lightweight, aren't you, Draco."  Pansy sipped from her own glass and eyed Draco with amusement.
"I won't."  The words were out of Draco's mouth before he had time to process them, and he was even more surprised to realise that he meant it.  Potter didn't hang around to notice this, though.  He disappeared between the bookshelves leaving a stunned Draco staring at where he'd once sat, wondering what the hell had just happened.
Draco barely had to glance at the menu himself – he'd dined here with Pansy on several occasions.  "They do an excellent filet mignon," he advised, then, turning to the waiter, added, "I'll take mine rare."
It took a few moments for her words to register in Harry's brain, but when they did, his cheeks flushed and he spluttered his outrage.  "Don't be so ridiculous; Malfoy's a bloke."
photographs. Wide-eyed with surprise, Harry stepped closer. Some of them were the old ones, the ones that Malfoy had originally found. But others were simply blank frames, clearly waiting for the arrival of Harry's new creations. Harry had been sceptical of Malfoy's assertion of his talent, but seeing his work displayed like this he couldn't help but feel proud.

a substantial sum in order to avoid imprisonment.  Their coffers, however, were deeper than most.  "Anyway, they had these large, expensive homes to run that they could no longer afford, but no way of removing the burden.  Pure-bloods inherited property – they had no idea how to sell it.  That's where I came in."
Neville paused in his work and looked up at them, one dirty hand shielding his eyes against the sun.  "I don't know about that, Harry.  I heard from Ron you have a house guest."
"Me?" Potter gestured wildly, causing his drink to slosh precariously in his glass.  "How is it my fault?  You're the one who invited us.  And anyway, you said you didn't care."
"Look behind you." Harry nodded slightly and watched as Draco turned round to face the sight of Ron and Pansy apparently trying to devour each other.
The feel of Draco’s warm body pressed up against his had been the perfect start to the day for Harry.  And it had only got better as he and his flatmate exchanged gifts around their stately tree, to a soundtrack of Bing Crosby.  Unashamedly, Harry spent the entire morning fantasising that he and Draco were a proper couple, not just good friends who danced round the edges of romance from time to time.
"And I'm sure that wasn't your case of highly illegal potions we found in the attic of your house, right?"
Pansy, who more than most understood the truth of what those empty beds meant to Draco, was instantly chastised.  "Sorry," she said quickly.  "I didn't mean to..."
"Beef's done," he said, more to himself than anyone else.  Then, oven gloves in place, he removed the joint and set it on the side to rest.
He grunted something that passed, in Kreacher's eyes anyway, for yes, and slumped into one of the few remaining chairs. Malfoy had been struck with a new 'vision' for this room, hence it's continuing resemblance to a building site – and it was driving Harry
Harry had gone quiet as well, though, and when Draco looked closer he noticed a matching flush and a slightly glazed look in Harry's eyes. And all Draco could think about in that moment was how stupid, how fucking stupid he had been to walk away from this, and how nothing on earth would persuade him to do it again.
Having no actual destination in mind, a part of Harry was relieved. The other, more vocal part of him, was still pissed off. "What now? Thought of another way to have a go at me?"
"Draco?  Is that you?"  Pansy tugged the door fully open.  She was, to Draco's infinite relief, fully clothed.  She took one look at Draco's face and turned to George.  "Give us a minute, would you?"
While Harry certainly missed the hectic fun that those gatherings offered, he had to own a slight preference for the more relaxed lunches spent at his best friends' house.
said them, and Hermione had made similar noises about Rose and Hugo, and as much as Harry didn't want to move, hadn't the time for such distractions, he wasn't sure he had very much choice, given the alternatives.
Her tone brooked no argument, and Harry had more sense than to try.  He gave one last longing look at the kitchen – suddenly silver sprinkles didn't seem such a bad prospect after all.
"But what if I need to get hold of you," Harry probed when she elaborated no further.  It wasn't often he got to enjoy a discomfited Hermione.
He smiled lazily, slowly swirling the wine in his glass before taking a sip.  “I invited you,” he said simply.  “If it was left to Harry to observe basic social niceties, you'd still be waiting for your first invitation three years on.”
Of course he didn’t, but that didn’t stop the coil of desire that unfurled in his belly at the thought.
Fortunately, before Harry was forced to answer what was a rather difficult question, Ginny appeared at the end of their table, all shiny red hair and smiles.
"What about Ron?" This wasn't the reaction Harry had expected at all, and stringing coherent sentences together was becoming a bit of an issue.
Harry came to a halt at the end of the path and turned back to glance at the house they'd just exited.  On the face of it, the house was picture-perfect.  The kind of rural idyll only found on the front of chocolate boxes or Christmas cards.
have come that Draco only gives a slight shake of his head.  "Can't keep your head out of the clouds for five minutes.  No wonder you used to drive Severus to distraction."
Harry crossed the room in a few determined strides. He had only seconds to glimpse Draco's wary expression before he crowded him up against the wall and pressed their lips together in a kiss that he hoped said what he didn't have the words for. Apparently it worked, because after a moment of stillness that made Harry's heart sink, Draco was kissing him back. Warm hands sliding up Harry's arms to wrap around his neck.
Harry did, and nodded sharply in reply. There was nothing he disliked more than prodding at memories best left forgotten.
Draco's face broke out into a smile.  "I'm glad you asked that, Harry," he said, and held out his arm.  "Next is my favourite by far."
“Well, no.”  From her tone it sounded like Hermione thought this should be obvious.  “When someone mentions Draco you tend to get a bit…well, like
With that, he reached over and deftly undid Draco's trousers.  Draco opened his mouth, planning to say something incredibly stupid like 'you don't have to', but Potter just shook his head.
"I can't take it anymore."  Pansy Parkinson, architect of this particular scene, flounced into the 8th year boys' dormitory and flung herself down onto one of the beds.
Harry extended one leg under the desk to administer a swift kick and was satisfied to see the wince of pain on Ron's face. Yes, they'd discussed this idea, but Harry hadn't agreed to anything. Not yet. But then Pansy Parkinson, of all people, turned an expression on him that was so hopeful that Harry didn't have the heart to say otherwise. Wishing with every fibre of his being that he could be more of a bastard sometimes, Harry nodded slowly. "Yeah, I'll be there."
Harry raked one hand through his hair distractedly – a tell tale sign of his frustration.  "He just grabbed my wrist to stop me leaving."
"We should probably clean up," Harry suggests after a while.  Because as comfortable as the cuddling is, the mess in his jeans is decidedly not so.
It wasn't that Harry didn't know Malfoy was right – he was digging his heels in on principle now – but still… "Because I have my own bed, in my own house, and I want to sleep there tonight. Besides, her sofa bed makes my back hurt."
"No.  Look, I know he's your father and you love him regardless, but don't expect me to wear your rose-tinted spectacles every time his name crops up.  I'll never forgive him for
The click of the back door heralded company.  Harry closed his eyes and waited for the tongue lashing that was sure to come once Hermione found him.
Narcissa patted his arm and smiled brightly at this.  Draco knew he was laying it on a bit thick and, from the look in her eyes, so did his mother.  But it never hurt to flatter her vanity every once in a while.  Especially since his plans for the evening consisted of squiring his mother and her
"Because he lives in a flat that's approximately the size of a Chocolate Frog card."  Blaise answered for Harry again, his expression and tone tinged with smug satisfaction.
Malfoy, who has surprisingly matched him drink for drink, smiles lazily in return.  "I have my uses."
.  And all his ideas of breaking the news to Ron gently would be shot to hell.  And Harry had plans, tentative though they may be, and he wasn't ready to subject his fledgling ambitions to Hermione's judicious scrutiny just yet.
Hermione dismissed this concern with a wave of her hand.  "I'd be very surprised if Narcissa doesn't at least suspect part of it – mothers just know these things about their children.  And Lucius, well, what's he going to do from a cell in Azkaban?"
Draco pulled back, reluctantly breaking the kiss, and pulled his top the rest of the way off.  Barely had he dropped it on the floor before Potter was back, lips on his, and gentle hands smoothing over his skin, guiding him backwards towards the bed.
The walk back to Gryffindor tower had begun with a spring in his step, but with every passing yard, Harry felt the all too familiar mantle of guilt settle more and more firmly onto his shoulders.  By the time he reached the portrait hole, Harry was scrabbling desperately in his bag for his Cloak.
"Honestly, you two were so caught up in that Romeo and Juliet bullshit you carved out for yourselves, that neither of you realised no one really cared." He pauses then, ensures he has Harry's attention before continuing. "Well, Draco's parents do, but…" Blaise gives a little
," she scoffed.  "You don't fool me, Draco Malfoy.  Five Galleons says you've already got that in a frame on your bedside table."
Not that he thought Harry would mind – especially not with the bottle of wine and Chinese takeaway he came bearing, but considering his hopes for the evening ahead, Draco felt a slightly more formal approach was called for.
Draco pressed another open-mouthed kiss to Harry's throat.  "Don't be silly.  It's  a brilliant idea."  Draco worried the wet flesh slightly with his teeth, causing Harry to whimper softly.  "See," he said smugly.
Harry waited impatiently for the few minutes it took her to return, and was out of his seat as soon as she sat down.  He made his way to the end of the table and stopped by Draco’s chair.  He smiled at his flatmate who stared back at him in surprise.
Harry wasn’t sure who kissed who first.  All he knew was that Draco’s lips were soft and warm, and fitted perfectly against his own in a way that surely meant they belonged together.  Then Draco’s hands were in his hair, and his body was pressed close, and Harry thought that his chest would burst at any moment, such was the force of the emotion he was feeling.
As the kitchen door closed behind him, Harry was pretty sure he could hear Blaise and Pansy begin to tease their friend, but it was all good-natured and Draco was more than capable of holding his own, Harry was certain of that. So he turned his attention to Hermione instead. Who was currently stacking the dirty dishes into a
Draco made a dismissive gesture with his hand.  "It's fine.  I used a Warming Charm on it." He paused then and took a deep breath, aware of the shock his next words could present.  "And it's Draco."
by Harry Potter, was something that Draco filed away for examination later.  For now, what he said was, "Hush, you."
old friends, but the addition of Draco to the group is very definitely a change.  And a very welcome one, to Harry's mind.
"Nothing's anyone's fault today," Ron replied, as he made himself comfortable at his desk once again. "Come on, let's get this paperwork processed. Hermione's the duty law witch today and I don't need to spend another evening listening to the iniquities of the Auror department. That woman really can't leave her work at the office."
Harry looked round the room and could still see several disgruntled occupants watching him and Tom carefully.  "They don't want him here?"
Now Draco was convinced his mother was covering something up – under normal circumstances, she would never willing allude to anything at all related to the war.  "Okay," he replied slowly.  "I'll just fetch my cloak and then we can get going."
"You'd be in pain too if you slept on a fold-up bed like this one."  Blaise gestured in Harry's direction as he spoke, but his attention was on Malfoy.
He arrived home moments later, scarf still wrapped firmly around his neck, and his cheeks flushed from the cold.
Harry shrugged. "I didn't know what else to do. Besides, everyone kept talking about me following in Dad and Sirius's footsteps, and I just…"
Malfoy gave what appeared to be a sad nod.  "I'm afraid so," he confirmed.  "Oh, and his shoulders too, apparently."
Whatever it was his mother wanted was more than worth it for the meal he'd just eaten, Draco mused as he settled his cutlery on the empty plate.  Glaringly vulgar though the colour scheme may be inside, the foot itself was undisputedly exquisite.
“How is your mum?”  Harry might consider his debt repaid, but he would always be grateful to Narcissa for her actions.
Draco’s eyes narrowed and he opened his mouth to give his friend a patented Malfoy tongue-lashing. However, Blaise beat him to it.
The smile was still there and Draco felt the tiniest bit confused – maybe Potter had been at the Firewhisky already.
"I've never been to a Muggle restaurant before," Draco admitted. "Not much of a surprise considering my family, I'm sure."
Draco stared in surprise.  He'd been unsure what to expect this evening, but surely Harry hadn't invited his friends to join them.  "Hermione," he acknowledged with a nod of his head.
Harry didn’t hear Ron’s reply.  Instead he felt his mouth go dry at the sight of Malfoy’s pale skin, and couldn’t help wonder if it was really as soft as it looked.  He swallowed hard.
Draco laughs again, to Harry's relief.  "I'd better go and calm him down."  Draco pushes away from the counter with one last smile.  "Let Neville know I'm here if you see him.  I've got a new contract we need to discuss."
The irritation at being constantly interrupted was plain on Potter's face, yet Granger seemed immune.  Mainly, Draco supposed, because it was an expression she was so used to seeing.
Briefly, Draco considered returning to the Manor, and climbing into his own bed.  But he quickly dismissed that.  Even if Harry was already asleep, Draco could still climb in next to him, snuggle into his warm embrace.
Harry refrained from rolling his eyes with difficulty – this was another conversation they'd gone the rounds of numerous times.  The only thing that stopped Harry from losing his rag was the tightness in his chest that occurred when he realised that Ron was outraged on
Harry held his gaze for as long as he dared – something was shifting between them and he wasn't sure he was ready to put a name to it just yet. "It's a good job one of us did," Harry said eventually, breaking the moment. "Look at them two." He nodded in the direction of Ron and Pansy who were busying trying giant orange hats on each other's heads.
"Well, let's start with the basics."  Draco was determined to make some progress this evening – having Harry Potter on the books was no good for business if he couldn't find him a property.  "You need more space, right?  So how many bedrooms?"
"I guess," Ron replied distractedly – his attention on the display of fudge in front.   "It's dying out nowadays, but the more traditional purebloods – your Malfoys of this world – well, it's quite common amongst them."
It wasn't a topic Harry gave much thought to really.  In fact, he'd only thought of Malfoy in passing since the end of the trials.  But his reaction to this was very definitely relief.  "What changed?"
Draco struggled hard to keep a reign on his rising temper – he didn't want to fall out with Pansy, not about that, and certainly not in the middle of Honeydukes.  "She knows it's not a love match."
"Drink."  Draco held out a small glass vial, and Harry grabbed onto it like a drowning man at a life raft.
nice," Harry offered as they entered the lift.  "And that view was brilliant.  Think you could fly off there?"  Harry smiled hopefully at Draco, seeking assurance he wasn't annoyed.
With a mind to the library's other occupants, and with no desire to be overheard, Draco kept his voice low.  Too low, it seemed, because Potter continued to scratch away at his homework, oblivious to Draco's attention.
Harry nodded in the direction of the portrait at the same time as its occupant released a whispered, "Draco."
Harry's smile feels like it is stuck to his face.  "I'd better get back," he says finally.  And with a quick nod in Blaise's general direction, he scurries out of the room.
It didn't help when he had to lend Malfoy clothes to wear.  In their haste to the pub, the need for clean clothes had been overlooked, and the sight of Malfoy eating breakfast, dressed in Harry's hoodie and too-short  jeans caused a warm twisty sensation in the pit of Harry stomach that he tried hard not to examine.
"Nonsense," Hermione replied briskly, placing Rose onto her godfather's stomach.  "Half the day's gone already."
There was hardly a bare surface or wall left in their flat, such was the extent of Draco's decorations.  Harry had to admit he'd done a good job.  All the colours coordinated; it looked like something out of one of those home magazines that Aunt Petunia had been obsessed with.    Secretly, Harry's favourite part was the large silver star atop their tree.  Made by Teddy Lupin, Harry had been very surprised when Draco consented to use it without even a murmur of protest.  It didn't necessarily match the rest of the decor, and was a little lopsided, but the fact that his godson had made it for him, made Harry love it all the more.
Malfoy laughed.  But it wasn't the genuine warm sound that Harry had come to appreciate over the last few months; it rang a little too hollow for that.
Harry's stomach clenched unpleasantly – again at the mention of Malfoy's name, but this time mainly fearful anticipation of Ron's reaction.  "Don't talk daft," he muttered.
plants in his morning tea, because there's no other possible explanation for the way this conversation is going.  The silly grin now plastered on his face is a further sign that something isn't quite right.
After the war and Harry's defence of Malfoy at trial, the two of them had parted ways on reasonable terms.  Not friends by any stretch of the imagination, but two people matured sufficiently by what had gone before that they were, at the very least, able to hold a civil conversation.
"Weasley's arse."  Malfoy's words were blunt and matter of fact, and were swiftly followed by the sound of Harry choking on his butterbeer.
Parkinson was casually filing her nails when Harry looked.  But she stopped for a moment and raised her eyes to meet his.  "He doesn't bite, you know?  Draco, I mean."
Yet again Draco found himself struck dumb by the difference in Potter.  Draco knew from experience that surviving a war changed people – himself more than most – but for some reason he had expected Potter to remain unaffected.  The little, and oft ignored voice in the back of his mind – the one that sounded suspiciously like a smug version of Pansy – suggested that perhaps Potter had always been this way, and it was only now that Draco was allowing himself to appreciate it.
Harry leant against the wall opposite, his arms crossed defensively.  "It was the right thing to do," he replied, a determined tilt to his chin.
Draco rolled over slowly, cracked open one eye, and then wanted to laugh out loud at his own stupidity.  There, silhouetted against the moonlit window pane, was Harry, only a sheet covering his naked form.
Malfoy's expression changed his mind. He held it firmly on his lap instead. "So how did you get into it anyway?" he asked, keen to divert Malfoy's mind from potential mug rings on the furniture.
The game was okay, though the Canons were mediocre at best, but throughout it all Harry struggled to concentrate on anything but the man beside him. He knew he should be watching the play – he'd paid enough in money
Draco followed his gaze around the flat and nodded.  "We don't all still have our clothes in boxes two months later."
Malfoy's laugh was bitter and something clenched in Harry's chest.  "Maybe you shouldn't then," he said, with a rueful glance at the drink.
"Of course we're happy for you, aren't we, Ron?"  Harry gave his friend a sharp kick under the table and grinned slightly as Ron tried to stifle a yelp.
Harry shook his head emphatically.  His only regret was that he'd waited so long.  "I quit, Draco."  Harry paused for a moment to enjoy the surprise on Draco's face at hearing his first name used, then, to make his point, added, "I dropped out of Auror training."
Harry suspected Malfoy was going for sarcasm, but it came out as much more defensive.  So instead of biting back, he just smiled.  "Well, I am a partner in the business – even if it is a silent one."
Ron had been easy enough to misdirect on the few occasions he'd noticed Harry's appearance, and there was no one else really looking.  But Hermione was back now, and nothing got past her, and Harry resigned himself to another course of Dreamless Sleep if he wanted to avoid the third degree and questions he couldn't, or didn't want, to answer.
Pansy shook her head, a broad grin firmly in place.  "No problem.  I'm just a little surprised, that's all."
Potter smiled awkwardly and rubbed the back of his neck with one hand.  Something, Draco had learnt over his many years of observation, which meant he was feeling distinctly uneasy.
Harry let her hands drop and he gaped in surprise.  "Bridesmaids," he repeated.  "Are you serious?  I'd look terrible in a dress."
Hermione huffs, but soon relents because she really does know how he feels, but, "I haven't had a night out in ages," she says, one hand curled lightly against her stomach. "And your best friend is never home to take me anywhere."
Dessert came next, and as the bowl of plum pudding appeared in front of him, Draco swore he could feel a faint sweat break out on his face.
"Oh," Harry says, though it comes out as more of a croak.  Something has shifted between them and he has no idea what.  Although the crazy fluttering in his stomach seems to have some suggestions on the matter.   With an idea of being polite, he gestures towards the living room, and follows in Draco's footsteps, consciously keeping his eyes up high.
Harry was still staring at Malfoy, though, and had no idea what the interior of his new home looked like. So he tore his gaze away to take in his surroundings.
, but Merlin forbid I should give Pansy the time of day?"  She stabbed rather forcefully at her roast potatoes before adding, "She did a lot less than Malfoy."
“You might want to try being a little more tactful then,” Draco suggested, glancing pointedly at Blaise who was now morosely picking at his stew.
Though it hadn't been his intention when suggesting it, the evening had seemed almost romantic.  The setting sun behind Hampton Court had provided a beautiful backdrop, and Draco had felt his self-control straining to the point where he was on the verge of throwing Harry down on the ground himself - general public be damned.
"This was a bad idea," Draco muttered to himself, reaching for his fourth consecutive glass of punch.
Harry feels sick at these words, because he never meant… He only wanted to keep Draco away from all the crap that went with
was not the answer the occasion called for.  It didn't make it any less true, but he went for the safer option of "in the kitchen" instead.
Draco almost laughed out loud at the look of scepticism on his elf's face as she took in the chaos of his usually immaculate room.  However, Malfoy elves were taught from an early age to hold their tongues, and this one was no exception.  There was a loud crack and then Draco was alone again.
“Yes, Harry, essentials,” Pansy answered, using the tone that Harry was convinced all Slytherins were taught upon Sorting.  “Draco said it was okay for me to join you for Christmas, seeing as my other plans have...fallen through.  So I’ll be stopping in your spare room tonight.”
.  Instantly mortified, Harry pulls away.  He barely pauses to stammer his excuses before fleeing the scene, cheeks aflame.
"But I thought he was the one who broke up with her?"  Draco's brow creased a little in confusion.  "Or at least, that's what Pansy was saying.  She's a terrible gossip, that girl."  Draco finished up with a nervous laugh of his own – he had no desire for Potter to know just how much the goings on in Gryffindor Tower featured in his daily conversations.
It takes a few moments for Harry to realise he still hasn't got an answer to his question.  "Where are we going?" he repeats, and follows up with a sharp tug on their bond.
"I promise anything I learn will remain strictly between us – I have a very firm policy on client confidentiality."
. I know how much this means to you, having him with us, and just…in general, I suppose. I’ve probably never said it, not sober anyway, but you two- you have something, something so different to the rest of us. Me and ‘Mione, we’ve been in love for nearly double the time you’ve been, yet…I don’t know, mate. You seem to get each other more than anyone else does, and you,” he scrubbed a hand over his chin, eyes flicking from Draco to Harry and back, “don’t laugh at me, now, but you two…you
", and another, to the other side, before trailing his lips across his jaw. Draco tilted his neck, giving Harry access, who peppered more tiny kisses down it, each one containing a silent plea.
Draco stopped his rambling with another kiss, and Harry sighed against his lips, the storm raging in his heart now calm. When they broke apart, Draco smiled softly, running his thumb along Harry’s bottom lip, plucking at it affectionately. “I lied before too, I suppose. It really has been rather dreadful, living without your hero cock for this long. Speaking of-” he glanced down, ignoring Harry’s scoff of disbelief, and wrapped a firm hand around him- “I believe we have some unfinished business to attend to.”
“I’m proud of you,” He murmured, nuzzling Draco’s nose with his own, and Draco snorted, eyes sparkling.
for so fucking long he’d made Harry’s blood boil, would end up lounging in Harry’s arms, covered in glitter and smiling so brightly Harry’s heart felt like bursting. Who stole his joggers and gave exceptional head and had agreed, in no uncertain terms, to stay with Harry for the rest of their lives.
“Oh, save it,” Harry snarled, pulling his fingers out to a whimper from Draco, unbuttoning his trousers and hissing with relief as his cock finally sprung free. He eased down the foreskin, conjuring more lube and giving himself a quick stroke, before gripping the base to keep his impending orgasm at bay. The damn spell had him hornier than a teenager, ready to burst after a single touch- he hadn’t felt this desperate for years, and he took hold of his cock in a trembling hand, rubbing the head over Draco’s quivering hole, smearing pre-come between his cheeks.
,” Draco panted as Harry reemerged from under the covers, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.
asking me stupid questions”) before Harry had even unpacked, so they’d been hidden at the bottom of their wardrobe ever since. Now that he’d finally agreed to come, Harry thought it was worth a shot, because despite his current sobriety the thought of seeing Draco’s arse sparkle was still incredibly appealing.
Breaking the kiss, he turned his head to see Ginny aiming a third cocktail sausage and spun them round so that it bounced off Draco’s back, who didn’t seem to care at all; he peppered tiny kisses all over Harry's face, oblivious to the mild disgust they were causing around them as he ground his hips subtly against Harry’s own.
“Fine,” Draco huffed, looking way too put out for someone who’d just had a mindblowing orgasm, “if you won’t give it to me now, we should get out of bed. I refuse to be late to your little event.”
Harry scoffed, dropping into the seat next to him. “No, that colour doesn’t wash you out and yes, you absolutely are. Did you shrink these?” He asked, adjusting himself through the ridiculously tight jeans Draco had picked.
Draco’s eye’s narrowed slightly, raking the length of Harry’s suit-clad body, before he shook his head. “No, I don’t think we do. Care to dance?”
“Don’t remind me.” Draco huffed a soft laugh, absentmindedly stroking Harry’s arm. “So...was this my present?” He asked, looking down at his ring, turning his hand so that it sparkled.
“Oh, for goodness sake, will you leave him alone? He’s only just got here,” Hermione chided, swatting Ron on the arm as she situated herself in between the two of them- or at least tried to, the skirt of her huge satin gown taking up more space than the three of them combined.
Draco watched him as he approached, eyebrows raised, an amused smirk dancing across his lips- although, as he drew closer, Harry could see a slight flicker of anxiety behind his eyes, something few people would pick up on, but was glaringly obvious to him.
“Hey- hey, none of that,” Harry said, cupping Draco’s cheek, “you are absolutely not silly, but I promise you, we’re one hundred percent safe. This is a celebration, and one we’re fully entitled to. Everyone here is on our side. It’s important to be careful, of course, but I promised to look after you, didn’t I? You know you’re safe with me. There’s absolutely nothing to worry about, except maybe Blaise getting so pissed he forgets he’s a wizard, but that’s only happened once.”
"I’ll admit- I haven’t been quite as put together as one might assume,” he murmured, and Harry snorted wetly. “But Potter, I would never—”
“Yeah, I think I’ve got a pretty good idea,” Harry said with a grin, kissing Draco just behind his ear. “You can take charge later if you’d like,” he whispered, “after I’ve de-glittered your-”
, heat coursing through him, desperate to sink his teeth into Draco’s exposed neck, to rip the flimsy shirt straight from his body, to wrap those ridiculously sexy legs around his waist and take him right where they stood. Instead, he stood stock-still, very aware of the twenty or so eyes on them, heart pounding, head spinning, intoxicated.
“No, not planned…I didn’t know where you stood, if you’d even want to talk to me- Merlin, if I’d even want to talk to you. In saying that, I hadn’t forgotten your preference for leather- ” Harry chuckled, eyes drifting shut, arm tightening around him, “- so I suppose it was less planning, more amenability. I think Mother knew what my intentions were though, I dare say better than I did.”
you,” Draco chuckled, walking over and running his free hand though Harry’s hair. He blew his tea before taking a sip, scratching Harry’s scalp lightly. “You’re with me because out of all the different options, I came out on top. Or, well...anyway, my
Harry pulled away for a split second to cup Draco’s face, drawing him back in to kiss him slowly; he leisurely prized Draco’s lips apart with his tongue until he felt Draco melt against him, all tension disappearing as he groaned into Harry’s mouth. The crush of people kept them pressed close together, swaying slightly with the crowd as it moved all around them, yet to his relief no one tried to interrupt.
to wear them, of course, it’s more of a joke than anything, but I thought I’d at least suggest it, or show you, or…”
“Oh.” Harry’s heart fell slightly at the look on Draco’s face, his wide, hopeful smile. “No, my love, not really.”
, rolling his eyes when Harry whooped loudly and started dancing around their bedroom but looking pleased with himself all the same.
His breath hitched at the sight, suddenly ravenous; the sight of Draco alone made him hungry- he wanted to run his tongue up and down his body, taste the droplets of sweat that ran under the collar of his shirt, suck on the delicate skin of his arsehole, leave great big bite marks on his pale, fleshy arse. Instead, he settled for where he could reach, licking a stripe up Draco’s neck, pressing wet kisses across his damp nape, nibbling gently on his earlobe.
Ron leant behind her as she spoke, tapping Harry on the arm and nodding towards the kitchen. Unfortunately, Harry didn’t find out what was so funny about the Wizard of Oz, because they broke away from the group, Hermione’s history lesson soon fading as they moved through the small crowd. The wireless was floating in the corner, amplified and blasting The Weird Sisters’ latest release-
“Yeah, that’s brilliant, Luna,” Harry agreed, feeling embarrassingly overwhelmed when she gave his hand a little squeeze before wandering back to the rest of the group.
Harry had prepared all afternoon for an ambush from his friends, knowing they were getting impatient; he and Draco hadn’t seen each other since that day a few months prior, when Draco had silently packed a bag, cheeks stained with tears, ignoring Harry’s protests. Harry had refused to talk about it since, never a fan of discussing his feelings and not wanting to drag it out. He hadn’t, however, missed the small looks they'd give each other when he brushed them off, or the whispered conversations that would end abruptly when he entered a room, so knew it had only been a matter of time.
costume.” Ron snickered as she ran a finger down the lapel of Harry’s jacket, before she glanced around, clearly looking for someone. “Ginny should be here somewhere, she was just fetching me a drink—”
Harry looked at him incredulously. "Clark Kent. You know, Superman? The glasses?” He gestured to his suit and tie. “Surely you know Superman?”
when you’re together, and after this long, that’s a big deal. I can see how much you love him from a mile away, and he’s no different. I’ll never know how you did it, but Merlin I’m glad you did, because you deserve to be this happy. I’m glad you found someone who can make that happen for you just by...I dunno, just existing, I suppose.”
Clumsily, he shoved two fingers into Draco’s open mouth, who began sucking on them instinctively, cheeks hollowed, eyes shut. But Harry wanted to
“Clearly, Potter,” Draco bit out raggedly, and Harry groaned, throwing his head back, hips snapping frantically, uncontrollable, like a man possessed.
Snorting, Harry gripped him tighter to keep him from collapsing as he cast the subtle charm over Draco’s groin, rubbing his back in gentle circles when he shuddered from the instantaneous effect.
Draco Malfoy in hot pants, however, would surely be imprinted on his eyeballs for the rest of his damn life.
Harry laughed loudly, gently removing Draco’s leg from his waist and placing it on the floor. "Would you stop that?”
“Is this a bad time?” Draco asked with a hint of amusement, looking between them before raising a questioning eyebrow at Harry. “What’s going on?”
you? You really think I’d stoop that low, Potter?” He hissed, eyes blazing. “You think I’m that desperate for your attention, that I’d curse you to get it? Or, what, as well as the complex, you think you’ve been blessed with a hero
“Oh, yes,” Luna interjected, absentmindedly stroking a sprout, “it was really rather horrifying. Quite fitting for All Hallows’ Eve, I suppose, but I just couldn’t bring myself to kiss her.”
it, the gentle curve of it, the soft, perfectly round balls hanging snuggly beneath; wanted to pull it out and run his thumb over the rosy, leaking head he knew the taste of so well; wanted to drop to his knees and go to town in front of everyone he'd ever met.
“So, what’s this about a wedding binder?” Harry asked and to his amusement Draco's cheeks reddened, despite his eye roll.
“Careful, Draco, your crassness is very telling,” he said, expertly catching the bottle of pumpkin juice Draco threw at him, “and while my congratulations were sincere, I actually came over to say goodbye.”
, I just didn't know it at the time. I thought we were going to be together for the rest of our lives, but it just didn’t feel right. Yes, I
They lapsed into contented silence, relishing the afterglow, until Draco turned his head, pressing a kiss under Harry’s jaw. He shifted, fingers hooking through the belt loops in Harry’s now-ruined trousers, and Harry felt his eyes on him.
Both Ginny and Luna looked at him like he was being particularly thick. “Surely you haven’t forgotten the retreat Draco and I attended together last summer?” Luna asked and Harry blanched, gaping at her with horror.
“Two years of marriage and you’ve already stopped snogging? Watch out, Draco, you’d better make the most of it now,” Pansy called, shrieking when Seamus squirted her with his water bottle. Draco chuckled quietly, using his hand to shield his eyes from the sun as he watched Seamus jump up and begin chasing her in circles, using water as ammunition and the rest of their friends as armour. He relaxed back against Harry’s chest, pulling Harry’s arms around his middle- probably to use as a shield in case any water was aimed his way- bare legs stretched out in front of him as he absentmindedly traced a pattern on Harry’s thigh.
“Here, put your hands here,” he mumbled against Draco’s nape, manoeuvring his arms until both hands were planted on either side of the sink, before sliding his own back down Draco’s sides so they rested on his arse. Prising his cheeks apart, his mouth began to water, wanting nothing more than to fall to his knees and bury his tongue between them, but knowing they had no time.
“If I’d known my attendance would get me one of those, I’d have agreed years ago. Was that my present?”
Harry cursed under his breath, feeling ridiculous- despite his efforts, Ron was just as appalling when it came to
Harry’s nose wrinkled, suddenly dreading his next visit to Narcissa; as if breaking her son’s heart a few months prior hadn’t been enough, she now knew about his thing for leather.
“You- before, I felt it, you cast a spell over me, or something, and I thought it was a sex thing, but now it’s gone too far, Draco, now it’s just
“I thought you said Draco was coming?” Ron asked as if reading Harry’s mind, dropping a bottle of water into a familiar rucksack as Harry double knotted his laces for a fourth time.
“Really?” Harry asked, slipping his hand into Draco’s to pull him over to the picnic area, their friends having drifted off at some point during their impromptu snogging session.
He wasn’t stupid, and he knew a lust spell when he felt one (he’d become well acquainted with them after the war when, for a while, it had been difficult to walk down Diagon Alley without ending up with a cursed erection), and the intense tingling feeling shooting up and down his spine- among other places- was a tell-tale sign.
His feet, seemingly guided by his imprecated cock rather than his slightly more rational brain, decided to take control, beginning an awkward shuffle back across the room, away from the sanctuary of salty buffet food and towards the unfairly gorgeous prick in front of him.
With one last glance at Ron, Draco winked at Harry before making his way over to Pansy and Hermione, who were laying down a picnic blanket.
“Give us a twirl, angel-boy!!” Ginny called and Harry glared at all three of them over his shoulder, shuffling this way and that in an attempt to hide Draco from the room.
Harry huffed a laugh, but the look on his face must have told another story because Ron’s own softened and he grasped Harry’s shoulder, giving it a reassuring squeeze. “
you,’ Draco rebuked, swatting her hand away, before catching Harry’s eye as he raised an eyebrow. ‘Ok,
, and he hoped Draco would be so impressed that he couldn't help but say yes. If not, Harry'd spent an awful lot of money and wasn’t entirely sure Draco would let him take the ring back no matter
for it—” Draco whimpered and Harry’s face heated, his inebriated brain finally catching up. He didn’t know what had come over him; Draco’s spell had clearly loosened his tongue, reducing him to a mindless dolt, words tumbling before he could think them through.
Hiding a grin and leaving Hermione to deal with Ron, Harry turned to find Draco leaning against the doorway, watching him fondly. It was ridiculous how the sight of him still made Harry’s heart swoop and stomach flutter all at once, unsure if he wanted to snog the living daylights out of him or paint a picture of his stupidly gorgeous face.
“Make sure you’ve got everything ready, they’ll be arriving any minute,” he instructed, looking at the hot pants as if they’d just insulted his hair before marching past Harry without looking back. Thirty seconds later Harry heard him stomping up the stairs and grinned, thankful that sober him was just as persuasive as drunk him was ambitious.
Following Ron into the kitchen, where he’d already begun devouring a finger sandwich and piling a load of Muggle buffet food onto a paper plate, Harry wondered if Clark Kent hadn't been such a good idea after all.
“You like that?” He growled, the slap of skin on skin unmistakable as it rebounded off the tiled walls, one hand tightening on Draco’s hip, the other still wrapped around his throat.
“Before he leaves again, or disappears into the crowd, do it while everyone is here! That way we can all watch.”
“I’ve always wanted to marry rich, you know that,” he wept, despite the huge smile on his face, running his thumb along Harry’s cheek to catch a tear and ignoring the many still rolling down his own.
Draco looked at him for a second longer, expression unreadable, before he snatched the bottle of nail varnish off the table with one hand, crumpled the hot pants in the other and stood abruptly.
, Harry,” Draco said with a tut, inspecting the small plastic instrument. “Stop acting so surprised, you bought me these damn things”
. Shitting fucking fuck. Ok." Harry inhaled deeply, glancing at Draco as his heart began to pound. "I’m going to do it.”
Harry would have laughed, would have even joined in, normally, except he couldn’t really concentrate on anything other than Draco; couldn’t tear his eyes away from Draco’s face, couldn’t form a thought other than Draco’s name, couldn’t bear the loss of Draco’s lips against his own. It was like he’d been doused with an extra strong love potion, stupidly exhilarated at the mere press of his back against Harry’s chest. He wanted to drag him home and lock the doors, wanted to consummate their engagement in every room of the house, wanted to hold Draco so tightly and make love to him over and over and over again until he knew without a doubt that Harry’s soulmate quip hadn’t been a quip at all.
Yet, oddly, it was a good sort of terrifying- less ‘I might die’ and more 'this is the greatest decision of my life'. It felt good to be walking into something so scary, but with an outcome so brilliant the fear was almost unnecessary.
Ron trailed off and Harry could feel his eyes on the back of his head as he scanned the room, finally landing on Draco, who was leaning casually against the mantlepiece. As if he could feel Harry's eyes on him, his head jerked up and Harry looked away quickly, cheeks heating.
“I think Harry just wants you all to himself, which we understand,” Luna said with a smile, pulling Ginny’s hand into her own. “Come on, honey, I want Pansy to paint my face before we leave.”
“What the fuck just happened?” Draco asked, looking from Blaise to Pansy to Harry with an expression of pure shock. Harry laughed, leaning forward to kiss him on the cheek.
fantastic, despite Harry’s urge to tear the shorts right back off him and fuck him frantically against a great big pride flag.
retreat,” he said, scowling when Draco’s confusion cleared and he laughed, winding his arms around Harry’s neck.
“Harry, I’ve never…” he gasped, stumbling into Harry’s side when he stopped walking to let Draco take it all in. He slipped his arm around Draco’s waist, kissing him on the cheek as Draco turned his head to look behind them.
An hour and multiple butterbeers later, Pansy was painting faces, Hermione was repacking bags and Harry was left wondering just how long it could possibly take for Draco to put on a pair of shorts- he hadn't reappeared him since he’d left the kitchen and in that time Harry'd had the bi flag painted on his cheek in the shape of a little heart, extended his back pocket so that he wouldn't have to take a bag (Hermione had tried handing him a large, hiking rucksack, which he’d adamantly refused), and re-laced his trainers three times, yet there was still no sign of Draco.
“I’m not worried,” Draco said softly, brushing glitter from Harry’s shoulder, “just trying to work out Ronald’s big secret. He looks like he’s about to explode.”
“Got it bad today, huh?” She said with a grin and he scowled, eyes back on Draco. "Blimey, I’m gutted I’m the only one here who hasn’t seen him with his kit off, if this is the reaction he gets with it still
know Superman, we watched it on the television a while ago." She blushed slightly, before adding, "he’s the rather gorgeous man in the cape, remember?”
“Good. As you should be.” His gaze slid from Harry’s to his own fingers resting against Harry’s cheek, happy expression morphing into something more ruminative as he cocked his head.
“A Snidget nest, Harry. They’re very rare birds, and a symbol of great fortune. Oh! That’s good news for your upcoming nuptials, how wonderful.”
It was so ridiculous it was almost unbelievable, and maybe Harry wouldn’t, if his arms hadn’t been wrapped so tightly around Draco’s waist that there was no doubt it was really happening.
“Now, are you going to keep asking daft questions about my trousers, or are we going to go somewhere more…private, like you suggested?” He tilted his head, warm breath ghosting Harry’s cheek, before brushing his lips gently against his ear, which began to tingle. “People are watching, you know, and your dancing is
