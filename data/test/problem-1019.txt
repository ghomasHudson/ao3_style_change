‘That’s not scary,” Blaise said once he saw her, he loomed above them both wrapped in a black cloak from neck to toes, his dark skin was spelled into a blue-grey tinge, his facial features warped into a snarling snouted bat, with thin pointed teeth that protruded down to his chin.
Even now, while teetering on the edge of insanity brought on by his heat, Draco could only think angry thoughts.
“The Malfoy boy?” Shouted someone from the other end of the hall, possibly Yaxley or Rodolphus, having heard Bellatrix. “Bring him to the Lord alive!”
“Mr. Potter, it’s an honour to be speaking with you, sir.”
The morning events haunted Draco, and he couldn’t help but feel glum all day in the Slytherin Common Room.
Dumbledore was sitting in his study, staring into his shimmering reflection inside the pensive.
With great difficulty he wrestled with the purple cock out of view again, blindly rotating it to be positioned at his aching hole. He pressed down on it to test his guess and gasped in shock when the round rubber head bore down on his asshole. He pulled back and repositioned it higher, this time meeting it more gently, and felt the head part the wet lips once more. He nudged it inside a centimetre against his hole before Draco finally felt resistance. His Omega sex couldn’t take the head, it clung to the curve but refused to budge.
“Not much, I only know snippets. He doesn’t give me a lot.”
“What other option do you have?” Lucia asked.
The activity in the common room suddenly died down, and the whoosh of someone approaching from behind cooled down the back of Harry’s exposed neck.
Draco ignored it and continued to sleep.
it came down in a heavy, impenetrable sheet that Draco watched from his bedroom’s window seat. Behind him his clothes were packed in a modestly sized trunk, there was the rushed patter of his parents footsteps running up and down the halls, he could hear the house elves apparating and disapparating erratically to complete whatever tasks they were set to before it was time.
The silver colour seemed to endlessly sparkle, placed underneath the candle lit ceiling of the classroom.
He was laughing.
“Oh my god,” Ron quietly groaned, shaking his head in his hands. “You... take Malfoy to a ball. I’m too young to be rolling in my grave, mate.”
with Muggles?” Sirius barked out a laugh, there was no one around to stare at them.
“No, no - “ Draco said, taking a step forward, puffing his chest out and pointing his nose up indignantly “ - don’t stop on my account. Go on, kitten, you’ve been hissing since I got here, you have something to say? Then say it. I don’t play these games.”
“An insult like no other,” Draco half-said, too busy swiping his hair back into place to give it any serious bite.
“Then I’ll choose who I want to spend my mateship with, I at least deserve that.”
In the smoke, Harry could make out a red light glowing, and growing in intensity, and reacted by thrusting his body to the side, just in time to watch a curse hurl from it. No one was given an opportunity to wonder about its effects, as it slammed a student into the wall - hard enough you could see his chest concave - or its origin, as a legion of masked Death Eaters marched out of the smoulder.
Well then.
She smiled and played delicately with the small linen pouch around her neck. “Oh. Don’t be sorry. I like it here, it’s quiet and the owls are always so funny.”
Harry kept his mouth shut. Ron would never understand what this was, and Harry himself would never really know how to even explain it. There was just a natural fascination that bewitched him, in spite of the way the Slytherin bully had treated Harry and his loved ones for all these years. Just from the way Draco moved, with the calm and deadly precision of a tiger, had Harry go wild. The authority in his presence, even if he was the smallest in the room, could subdue anyone. It made Harry’s unwanted celebrity status feel insignificant, which kept him from flying too close into the sun.
“Well, what’s the first thing you notice when he approaches you?”
“I can’t - “ Draco said meekly. He looked scared and nervous.
“If you need more time, you can stay. I don’t mind the company.” Sirius grinned.
The hall was fully festooned with floating pumpkins, enchanted bats, orange streamers, water snakes, dancing skeletons, and the ceiling’s usual illusion of nightly stars was replaced with glittering spiders. Harry had even suggested they change the House banners, which were now reflecting a more ‘
“I don’t want to be kept in a cage just because people don’t understand me. Ever since I presented people have either been afraid for me or of me. No one seems to give me a straight answer about why I can’t control my magic. All people tell me to do is bond! Bond to Potter! Bond, bond,
Draco flinched like he was prepared to be struck.
As soon as the thought materialised in his head, Lucia looked up as if she had sensed it, blue eyes meeting his.
“He didn’t… have anything to do with that.” Draco admitted. He cast his silver eyes down at his petite, pale hands, turning them back and forth distractedly. Severus could easily imagine the inner conflict his pretty blond head was brewing - debating over how honest he should be, if he was to tell the truth would Snape use this as his opportunity to remove Draco from school. It would practically be giving him the win. Would lying even work? It’s not as if Draco never lied to the man before, but Snape was like a bloodhound, and any slip up was a drop of blood in the grass. There have been many lies Draco had told Severus that were shortly after found out about.
also hey hey hey ya fav boy sirius is back ;) <3 but fear not everyone i can assure u this is and always was going to be a drarry fic so u just get to sit back and see how that eventually unfolds.
“I have told you that I understand your troubles, and that adjusting will be hard. But this didn’t give you the right -
In other words - he felt free.
His nails dug into the padding of his sleeves, reigning-in the emotions that wanted to split his head open and burst out.
“I can’t really explain how… But I lost control of my magic, without a wand or a spell in mind, it just came out of me.”
Draco already had so much to worry about, the last thing he wanted to deal with was the Halloween ball. His heat was coming in three weeks, his Head of House hated his guts, his Alpha was an oaf, and he had to worry about the impending day his Dark Lord sent his evil hoard to Hogwarts to kill and enslave everyone.
” She moaned, now leaning over the table toward the giant cauldron containing the punch, labelled
Draco rarely went up there, he was a little grossed out by the site of dried up rodent bones and owl shit on the straw covered ground. Potter didn’t seem bothered in the slightest, as if he’d been up to visit hundreds of times.
“I was thirteen. I’m okay now, don’t worry
“…Of course,” Draco said, doing his best to avoid letting out a relieved sigh.
“I think that’s the first time you’ve
He was preparing to get up.
“Oh…No. Thank you, but it was the only one of its kind.” Her voice was very delicate.
“What do you mean?” Her golden brow furrowed. Draco tried to read her, to see if there was even the slightest glint of secret understanding. He didn’t want to be on the end of giving away too much information to the wrong people. Her face was just sweetly baffled.
She imagined what he might have said, if things were normal. If he had presented as an Alpha like he was supposed to. Or even as a Betan child. ‘Mother classes are a bore.’ ‘Mother, you would never believe what Potter and his mindless goons said to me this time.’
But despite that feeble moment of peace when he saw their blue-toned uniforms, Draco already had a very bad feeling about today’s class. As they all pooled into the room, his sense of dread amplified when his Head of House snuck a hateful look his way. The question on his mind now was what could Snape possibly do to Draco today that was any worse than yesterday? Draco already knew: a lot. There was a lot the older Alpha could do if he wanted to scare Draco senseless. If he wanted the boy to leave there was a lot more up this sleeve he had yet try.
Seamus stuffed a sausage into his mouth, his cheeks bulged as he loudly spoke: “S’have you lot heard what happened then? Colin’s brother Dennis found out from Hufflepuff that Malfoy hooked up with some poor Fifth Year. Poor kid got expelled just coz the slut couldn’t keep it in his pants.”
liked them.
This probably wasn’t the smartest thing to do, as Sirius was expected to keep Draco under strict supervision. That meant he was was supposed to stay in the house. If it wasn’t the problem surrounding his Omegan magic bursting like a muggle atomic bomb, it was the Death Eaters eager to kill him. But something inside Sirius was telling him that this was the best way to get through to the boy. This was what the man needed to do.
His blond head poked out from the crowd and he began to make his way to the front. He could do this, he dealt with Boggarts before. No wait, his house elves dealt with them. But he’d seen some before, the Manor was too well-maintained to have Boggarts most of the time. He’d read about them, and was part of Lupin’s practical lesson.
Draco made some sort of non-committal grunt in the back of his throat, focusing on the papers he was shuffling into his book bag.
Maybe Harry needed to stop talking, because the look on Draco’s face was not quite so encouraging.
“And…?” Blaise prompted.
“Not a chance,” Draco said flatly.
“I promised I would keep you safe.”
Draco had never walked up to the seventh floor so many times in two months. He was panting, sweating at the armpits and face, all while trying to maintain a comfortable distance from the Alpha behind him, who was also obviously also struggling, but not from exhaustion. Harry had covered his nose and mouth halfway during the trip, possibly to avoid Draco’s post-heat pheromones. His tanned skin was blushing furiously and a sheen of sweat could be seen on his forehead. Unfortunately for Harry, Draco’s stubbornness to lead their walk was an already settled debate.
As soon as Draco Apparated he could hear the antique gramophone playing some sort of Russian ballet music, and could quickly make out the collection of portraits lining the walls, the spindly tables upon which were set delicate looking silver instruments that whirred and emitted small puffs of smoke, the incredible miniature library of books, the oak executive desk, as well as the old Alpha himself sitting comfortably behind it. Lucia was sitting in one of the two chairs in front of Dumbledore’s desk, looking nervous and rubbing her hands together. Draco didn’t need to wait for Dumbledore to say what the sudden meeting was about, he made a guess. He furiously pointed to the other Omega.
It did, but not in the way he was expecting. Instead of bursting open with its thing of nightmares, the larger top cabinet only creaked ajar. It was painfully slow, and from where he stood Draco couldn’t see what was easing the door open.
“Okay. Thank you. You’re right. Anyway, I’ll see you soon. I’ve got to check in with Romilda to see if the band is ready to start, I think most of the students are here now. Dumbledore’ll begin his opening ceremony any minute now.”
He couldn’t believe what he was about to do, and struggled to squash the self-deprecating shame taking over his thoughts.
also also my favourite thing about harry potter is the magic so if i get to talk about magic u damn well are going to see me talk about it whenever i can lmao!!!
Since coming back to Hogwarts Draco had slipped back into the flow of things easily enough, and in a blur it was already Friday the 18th of October. They only had two weeks until the Halloween Ball.
Nearly two months had gone by since she last saw her beloved son. She couldn’t even write letters to him in case they got intercepted by a subservient Death Eater.
of the need.
“You don’t need to know that much, Potter. It’s private.” Draco tried to stand a little taller, his chin could just barely rest on the other’s shoulder if he wanted to - which he didn’t.
Draco tilted his head deliberately. “Did he say what for?”
“Now, now, my dear boy, please.” Dumbledore seemed alarmed - his white eyebrows shot into his hairline, nearly under his lopsided nightcap. “You’re not in trouble. I’m very happy to see that you’re safe, I’m only trying to find answers. You said you were thinking, and then it just happened? Was there a trigger at all? Were you trying to call for the magic?”
Draco swallowed. Maybe he needn’t let it effect his night, after all that smile on the other boy’s face was refusing to waver, and Dumbledore was omniscient when he wanted to be, things would be okay tonight.
“ - I need it to find Lovegood. I needed to… ask her something.”
But the gloom in his expression cleared away fairly quickly, now displaying the second of Draco’s least favourite Potter expressions next to disappointment: suspicion.
He was sprinting up two, sometimes three, stairs at a time. With no place in mind to go, so long as it was as far from the Great Hall as possible. He doesn’t take the time to count how many floors he was leaping through, or how many hall ways he tore down. Eventually he stopped, breathless and bleary eyed, gazing around uselessly in the dark corridor. He stood there long enough to confirm it was abandoned, before ducking into a corner and collapsing
’ came to mind.
The question made Draco’s heart pace quicken — He’d secretly thought about the question before, and recalled that his first heat was on the the 17th of July, and had taken a week of build up before it peaked and was over.
. Get up, c’mon. Now, now!” Draco pulled the boy to his feet and without pausing Harry lunged forward, but still a foot apart, then offered his hand - which Draco considered, then eventually took - and lead the dance.
Before Draco could even touch his wand to the common room’s stone wall, a house elf with a twisted nose and cleft lip Apparated in front of him. The creature was only tall enough to reach Draco’s hip so it had to bend back it’s head painfully far to meet Draco’s eyes.
“You waited for me?” Malfoy said in surprise, whipping around, his expression open, honest, and very confused.
“Are you sure he would even say yes?” Hermione gently pushed.
“It’s not safe to be out there alone, and you’re not immune to yourself Draco. You could really hurt yourself and no one would know.” She rolled up a sleeve of her uniforms jumper, exposing a lumpy knot of scar tissue running around the inner corner of her elbow. “I got this from my third heat. There’s one like this on my right leg too, I nearly lost both of them. Luckily no one got hurt because of me…”
The potion he downed this morning had been somewhat of a relief, but experiencing his first day back at school after everything was still a headache on its own.
also please dont take my drawings as literal interpretations of the story, i just like to illustrate. ;)
“I understand,” Draco said again, his throat seized and the corners of his eyes stung with unshed tears, but his face refused to crack and reveal any emotion. He could do this.
Draco looked as if a thought crossed his mind and he frowned.
keep his body satisfied. Instead, Dumbledore unloads this crackpot tale of an Omega who was so unusually powerful that he takes out an Alpha nearly twice his size, then again nearly taking out the school. He had a line on hand of exceptional Alpha’s willing to mate with him, satisfying a great deal of people and organisations for traditional reasons, but it would also bring relief to his family to know that he was now properly looked after. Not only that, no matter the number of times this proud Omega is told about his horrifying magical curse, that it could either kill himself or others, he still insists on going through this crazy ordeal on his own,
Harry just…stood there. For a while, he didn’t think he was ready to try and look for Draco. He felt unraveled by the sheer dominance he unleashed on the Omega, and he couldn’t help the shame that brewed inside when he realised he’d liked it. He liked putting Draco in his place, of reminding him who’s authority took precedence.
He finally forced his eyes to open, only after he started to feel the fronts of his robes rustle from the miniature storm inside Snape’s study.
“Mr. Malfoy?” Something was shaking him with two small hands on his chest.
“Say it again.”
Draco nodded with a sarcastic smile before pulling the curtain all the way around his twin-sized bed with one quick jerk, ending their conversation.
Once over the threshold of the slope, lo-and-behold Harry Potter there waiting for him in front of the castle’s entrance. He was propped up with his arms crossed against one of the stone pillars up the stairs leading to the grand door, even still several kilometres away Draco couldn’t mistake the height and black mop of hair.
without even the slightest attempt to hide his bitter jealousy, and his grip on Draco tightened.
want it, Blaise?”
“If I’m going to be honest,” He continued, turning slightly around to look back at Harry. Green eyes were boldly staring back.
me: .....
“He’s fine,” she declared after her tests. “Just needs a fresh change of clothes and some shoes.”
“Not really, Luc.” Harry said, looking around the room, there was a tense strain in his jaw. Draco followed his line of sight to see he was looking at nothing in particular, and then they were then introduced to another Ravenclaw Beta girl called Eleanor, a Hufflepuff Beta boy called Augustus, and a Gryffindor Fourth Year Alpha Harry seemed to recognise.
Snape leaned back a little bit, observing him down the length of his nose very carefully. He didn’t say a word, so Draco assumed he had to keep talking.
He would not disturb the boy, regardless of the ever increasing scale of distress.
Now was his chance. He took a breath and slowly started to rise, intending to follow. “I’ll see you guys later…”
Anxious energy was coursing through him from the anticipation of a fight now and it was causing the hairs on his neck and arms to bristle. The tallest of the Alpha boys looked up, and as if he noticed the unease, he smiled, leaning away from the First Year to stalk towards Draco instead.
As soon as they approached the platform, Niffler gently pushed the floating suitcase towards the luggage compartment at the far end of the train, then offering Draco space to climb up the step that lead into one of the corridors.
“The problem is very simple.” Snape declared finally, after two hours of exploring Draco’s mind with impunity. Draco didn’t believe the man needed to stay in there for as long as he was, and mutely grumbled his displeasure as he rubbed his eyes to relieve the new headache forming.
“Okay…Draco… Stop this now.” Snape attempted to say calmly, leaning back into the chair as far as he could, obviously nervous. This wasn’t meant to be a practical exercise.
Draco didn’t really get much say in the matter.
He was recalling images from his dreams of Draco’s mother, he’d see her through Voldemort’s eyes. He knew exactly how he prodded into her mind like an oily knife, spilling in through her skull and consuming ever inch from the inside out. It wasn’t long before she started to look visibly tired from the concentration, it was inevitable. Voldemort was ruthless, tireless, he could stare into her soul unblinkingly for hours if he wanted to.
Sirius could respect boundaries.
This whole thing had been absolute torture, his brain was now tingling with the oncoming threat of a migraine in response to the strain on his body. It was unnatural for an Alpha to deny his purpose this way, and Draco was the most unusual, unnatural Omega Sirius had ever had the (mis)fortune of meeting. All of this wouldn’t have had been necessary if he bonded properly, on the day of his heat, with a worthy Alpha, who could have helped him subdue his magic
“How come?” She leant in close, big brown eyes wide and curious. “Don’t you feel it inside you? That need for an Alpha?”
“Of course. And… thank you…”
Since she stuck her nose where it didn’t belong, since she interfered and condemned him from Hogwarts to spend the week of his impending heat with Sirius in Grimmauld Place. He had to blink away the memories of fucking himself half-conscious on a bludger-sized toy cock, and now, feeling embarrassed, he looked over her again with fresh criticism. She was dressed as some sort of obscure mythical animal he didn’t know the name of - a Chimera, maybe? - it looked like an ugly combination of animal appendages and heads, all lifelessly dangling off her small shoulders in a gruesome way that was customarily perfect for Halloween, and to her word she was coloured in an obnoxiously bright
The sounds that continued on for the rest of the night would root themselves into Sirius’ mind for the rest of his life - moans that would be the inspiration for his deepest sexual fantasies, screams that would haunt his darkest nightmares, and weeps for mercy that would leave him feeling like he was the cruelest, most disturbing man on the planet.
“Hope a teacher doesn’t catch you.” But it was more of an admission of defeat, rather than a rebuttal.
Draco whispered through a small yawn, while he warily dragged himself out of bed. He tried to pat down his wild, bed tossed hair but it seemed fruitless without a spell. “But I’m not... I haven’t...I mean, I knew we’d be doing this just not so soon.” Draco wasn’t showing any symptoms, his neck hadn’t even started to ache yet. He didn’t think his scent had changed much, no Alpha in school was reacting any worse around him than usual. In fact Draco felt perfectly fine, if not better than he had been for the last two and a half months.
“No, Harry… Don’t!” Cried Hermione, finally shutting her book and putting it down beside her plate.
A hand was curling around the side of Draco’s neck, where he burned his hottest, and just stayed still. Draco’s body seized up for the strangle or slap or punch that never came. Potter’s finger tips were just… gently pressing into his skin. It miraculously stopped the flood of power. Draco was somehow capable of breathing again, they were shallow shaky breaths and yet they filled his lungs anyway. Where had he learn to do
The other boy struggled to swallow as he continued. “Not even the worst part. He nearly killed him with a curse once he was done with him. If you ask me I dunno’ why the pompous bastard gets to stay and that Hufflepuff kid gets the boot.”
“—Oh, for the love of—“ Draco interrupted, irresistibly annoyed by Potter’s famously vapid loyalty.
He felt a vibration start in between his hands, but wouldn’t open his eyes yet.
. I would prefer we post-pone any information about his parents until he is bonded to Harry as planned.”
“Draco, stop,” Harry said to him. Draco could hear him, but he wished he couldn’t - the Alpha’s tone was loud enough to cut through the music but he wasn’t shouting, it cooled the burning in him.
I pegged you as the most fanatical about that sort of thing.”
Draco shut his eyes and let the world fall away beneath him; when he finally opened them again, the world rushed back in nauseatingly. He thought back to what had happened - wasn’t bonding to Potter meant to keep his magic under control. Was this just going to get worse? He stole a glance towards the Gryffindor table, and sure enough Potter was sitting on the opposite side which meant he could easily stare across the dining hall at Draco. The blush that filled Draco’s cheeks was unavoidable. Shame, embarrassment, anger, they all churned inside him fighting for dominance.
Albus let out a pained sigh, casting away the vial to its place on a shelf.
also pansy is my absolute baby i love her ok always cracked me up in the books her bullying was so painfully 90's british school girl
“Anytime, Pansy.”
Draco was on the verge of skipping Thursdays classes.
She had the brightest grin on her face, her eyes twinkled in the setting sun’s orange glow.
“Woah… What’s this about?” Potter’s face was flushed red and his eyes look brighter despite the low-lit classroom.
“No.”
A slender, translucent hand lifted high enough to indicate that Bellatrix’s turn to speak was over, and she kicked herself internally for not successfully convincing the Dark Wizard of her idea.
He was ready to feel the fear, and he was ready to perform the task.
“Students, members of the faculty. I’m aware of the rumours that have started to spin and would rather explain the situation myself. Oliver Claudwell has acted in interest against Hogwarts and is hereby expelled.
“No… I’m forgetting the new spells from last month’s classes. It’s best I go back tomorrow.”
Hot tears of shame were now running from the corners of his eyes.
Speaking of the most hated boy in school, Draco suddenly stood, he rose like a king. Harry looked up to the enormous white faced clock above the doors - it was barely 10 minutes into dinner.
Sirius laughed, maybe a little too loudly, because instead of looking shy, Draco deadpanned, looking about as delicate as a prickling cat.
Draco squeezed the plush toy tightly to his chest, its small head bulged as all its stuffing strained inside, the fragile seams looked eager to burst. “No…”
“Why hasn’t Dumbledore asked to speak with me?” Questions about it swirled in his head, distracting him in classes until he was screwing up easy tasks. Was he in trouble? Had the Headmaster been more unhappy with Draco’s demands than he let on? The fear of not-knowing was making each night harder to sleep. The elder Alpha wouldn’t even meet his eye during meal times, not once. It was more unsettling than he’d like to admit.
But, despite his best efforts, he fell asleep.
It was Sirius. Draco could smell him before his brain even needed time to register which name belonged to that voice.
Voldemort laughed, a black, oily sounding thing, then acquitted her betrayal to the Malfoy’s being weak. Merely Alphas pathetically helpless to the charms of an Omega. “You can’t help it, your nature is inherently flawed. Pack of stupid
“Then what’s the difference?” Sirius asked frustratedly, tone getting louder. He was scratching his head, that migraine clawing at the edges of his brain in warning.
Draco sometimes wished he’d gotten the chance to look over his bedroom in the Malfoy Manor one last time, feeling cheated of a nostalgic memory. He struggled to remember his mother’s citrus perfume that could be smelled from her clothes. He missed his father’s lectures about his role as heir, and the way the peacocks would chirp in the early hours of the morning, welcoming the rising sun that climbed over their view of the expansive English property. Grimmauld Place was going to be home away from Hogwarts for a long time to come.
He stopped right in from of her and she looked up in time as she pushed the door open. She opened her mouth in shock but recovered quickly enough.
Draco looked down at that, she was right. He was still in the clothes he wore to the train station, a dark pair of jeans, worn with a mustard jumper and slip-on style leather shoes, his scarf and black peacoat had been cast aside on the other end of the sofa. He’d been experimenting with different styles and colours during his week in Grimmauld, after observing Sirius and the Muggles he’d see on their rare outings. “Oh. Yeah. Whoops.”
“Fine,
Niffler left him at the mouth of the bridge after seeming assured that the Omega wasn’t going to hysterically run off somewhere or throw himself into the lake to drown in some depressed fit. Draco rolled his eyes until they landed on the spot where the small creature once stood - he couldn’t help but feel a little offended, Dumbledore didn’t have an ounce of respect enough to trust that Draco wouldn’t be so weak as to do something like
“Yes…” He finally growled, he shifted sorely in his seat, wincing against the obvious bandages lining his upper body. He was only wearing a loose, exposing black shirt and dirty, blood stained jeans. His clothes always seemed to have blood on them, Narcissa never could find out who’s.
The first thing that met them once the doors magically opened was the sound of waking students filling the corridors, the sight of hundreds of unbrushed heads swarmed the entrance of the Great Hall. Many of them were still in their pyjamas, yawning away the lateness of Friday night. The smell of recently prepared food wafted its way to where Draco and Harry stood in the large foyer, it made Draco’s mouth water and his stomach complained with new vigour - now was not the time be talking with Harry Potter - and he made a move join the hungry hoard, but he was stopped immediately by an unknown resistance. Looking down he identified Harry’s larger hand tethering his own paler, slender hand, successfully rooting him to the spot.
Later That Night
Dumbledore’s voice boomed with the
“We can’t talk about this in private?” Draco reasoned.
Dumbledore glanced towards Professor Snape, who remained cast in shadow in the back of the room, who made neither a confirming or denying gesture. Seeming satisfied, the Headmaster returned his grave expression too Draco. “Then you understand what you must do?”
edit: if you've come back to read this again i've changed the drawing of sirius! i didnt really like it and it wasnt my best so i redid it.
-) at that, but you couldn’t mistake the small smile on his face.
The glow of Draco’s hands receded, and the vibration vanished, leaving behind a faint, dulled pain in loving memory.
Things were still being handled by Draco relatively well, but he was not one to count his winnings too soon. He liked to gloat but he wasn’t stupid. His first class of the morning was none other than Defence against the Dark Arts. This time fortunately with the Ravenclaw Sixth Years.
you’d think five years of Quidditch and the summer holidays spent dragon riding in France would make him capable of trekking seven flights of stairs. “I - huff - need your help.”
And yet… He wouldn’t risk going inside. Unless the boy asked.
“Those are mine!” Luna gasped, struggling to get up from her spot on the floor. She must have been there for a while because she wobbled and had to catch herself with her hands on the grass a couple of times before she could stand. “Give those back, I need those to see the Warblers.”
“I…” Draco needed to do something now.
. He was safest with Sirius, inside his untraceable home. She gripped at the skirts of her deep blue robes and pinched her lips unhappily, why did Draco have to be so difficult? It’d been a week and from what little she could gather from Severus, she knew her boy was refusing to budge.
“Students,” the man droned, he was at the centre of their amphitheatre shaped classroom. His hands were clasped primly behind his back and he stood beside a large grey book cabinet. “We have acquired something rather interesting today. I’m sure all of you, as N.E.W.T level students, have at least heard of this creature before.”
Draco’s eyes opened at that and he reluctantly sat up. His bed curtains were pulled open by the damned elf, who was standing a little too close to be considered polite.
They walk out to the courtyard. It was a warm and sunny day, sometime after 9. Now that he was 17 he didn’t need parent permission to leave the grounds, which wouldn’t have been possible if he presented a year before. He counted his blessings. The whole school was buzzing with activity, everyone wanted to soak up as much of the summer sun in Scotland before winter took its place. Kids were whizzing around on their school brooms, some practiced magic or read books in the open fields.
“Please put whatever’s upsetting you aside and come play with us.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The two of them had just finished eating lunch and were sitting in each other’s company in the dining room, soaking in the afternoon sunlight.
Narcissa was sitting in the Manor’s dinning room, now used to serve as her Dark Lord’s war room.
Harry nodded. Draco was already considering enchanting shadow animals to run across the floor and to fly around the walls and ceiling -
“…Yes, sir.” He responded defeatedly.
He needed to silence the Omega screaming inside him.
reemerging out of a toilet.
Then…
“I’ll catch you guys later, I’m going back to the common room.”
Then he did the one thing he could finally do: curl into a ball. He sobbed into his knees, hiding his face in his arms. It was the only thing he could do that wouldn’t make things worse.
honestly beware, this has some heinous non-con smut and if that makes u queazy i suggest waiting for the next chapter.
“I won’t.” The man said, he sounded so close, like his lips were pressed into the flat plane of the door. “I won’t come inside.”
“Of course…”
He let out a pained cry and felt the first onslaught of fresh tears tumble their way down his hot cheeks.
“Gummy bears,” spat Snape, clearly feeling stupid having to say the password out loud.
Draco didn’t need to be told twice, still a little bit in shock himself, and whirled around out the door.
Harry guided him to a corner in the foyer, their bodies were hidden from view by a statue.
Sirius looked down to ensure his means of teleporting out hadn’t disappeared on him -
Draco has no magic here, he has no voice. He has nothing, and can only throw his arm up to avoid the teeth snapping at his face.
No further explanation, no direction as to where he would be meeting Sirius. No guidance. Nothing.
She only failed to fool him because she couldn’t help herself but care about Draco.
Dumbledore narrowed his eyes. This was clearly non-negotiable.
Occasionally, much to Draco’s displeasure, he and Snape would still make eye contact. Sometimes while he interacted with his friends, sometimes even from across the hall, as Draco topped up his goblet of Eyeball Juice ( - the eyeballs long since shrivelled and unblinking from the corroding levels of spiked booze).
Funny enough Draco realised Harry and Sirius both looked a little similar sometimes.
They had a stand off for a few seconds. Intense, youthful grey eyes against cold, calculating black - the unstoppable force against the immovable object.
Harry had waited, leaning on the lockers nearby the class door.
When he looked up for an answer, there was what Draco could only describe as a sad smile on Sirius’ face, his eyes were lowered and the lines around them from the expression made him look even older. “Never say never. I’m sure I’ll be seeing you again, cousin.”
“Hey - “ Potter started, putting a hand up.
This time they did leave, and Draco could see over his shoulder Luna attempting to pick up the smouldering black lumps out of the grass, piece by piece.
He looked up to see it was Blaise Zabini.
“Wow, really?” Draco asked in disbelief. It was one thing to want to be fucked, but to be proudly displayed? He felt blood fill his cheeks.
“That’s fair. You said you coped okay because you were put on suppressants early like you were supposed to… But that can’t be it, surely? Is there nothing else keeping you from exploding? What have you done that keeps you from needing an Alpha?”
Draco placed a palm over his face and sighed.
“And… thank you,” he finally said, looking to the side to meet Blaise’s dark brown eyes, now molten bronze in the firelight. “But I’m going to try and solve this without an Alpha.”
“I am - Merlin, I would’ve figured things out a little faster if I had more people just telling me what the hell is going on.” He was so close to grabbing a fistful of hay and throwing it at her, but he was frightened of what foul smelling things have touched it first.
Harry looked stunned, but recovered with a laugh, offering a step back in an act of surrender. He seemed very pleased in a drastically short amount of time. “Christ, you’re just as bad as Hermione.”
Sirius snarling in his face.
A vibration, a sound straight out of a cosmic-horror-inspired nightmare, erupted from inside him. Draco couldn’t stop, or control, the energy rapidly building in his core, and only helplessly wrapped his arms around himself, hunched forward in pained submission. He tried to think peaceful thoughts, but anger would rear its powerful head and rip the thought to shreds, which only fuelled its intensity. His hands were starting to glow.
Draco’s hands were shaking. But he was so angry. He was so humiliated. How could he stop?
Slowly, the shadows expanded until it morphed into a cloud black smoke in the air, and three witches jumped out of it.
Kreacher understood and merely said, “As he wishes, Master Draco.”
He was experiencing life on hard mode for the first time.
“Oh - heh - yeah, good. Fine. Thanks. It was different.” Potter mumbled out bashfully.
“How can you believe anything he says?” The Dark Lord whispered angrily, his red eyes narrowed and his slit pupils quivered.
They walk down the series of steps in silence, until they reach the classroom. It’s filled with light-coloured wooden desks, their legs had spiralling plants on them. All around the room hung different types of potted plants and pots, Draco had never seen so many
“Wow,” Harry said beside him.
As soon as they made it to the stone Gargoyle, they were surprised to see it was already standing aside, like it was
Draco stood on a rock at the lakes shore, the stones beneath his bare feet were slimy with moss and algae. He welcomed the soft salty breeze that rustled his hair and clothes.
for God’s sake. Think about your power. Think about your control. Think about your influence on others.”
“Happy? Let’s get out of here, I’m bored of this.”
Harry opened his mouth to respond, but his resigned reply was interrupted by the walls holding the doors exploding forward, spraying rubble towards the crowd inside the Great Hall.
- the pain in his neck ebbed away, then disappeared entirely. It was a simple pleasure, but he couldn’t help but revel in the familiarity. His Omega nature craved for a place that was ‘his’, a safe place; so Draco gave in, going limp and boneless, now relaxed and settled into the soft pillows of his bed.
Draco remembered the vial Luna had given him, the small corked glass tube was hidden somewhere in the front of his suitcase, and he’d managed to scavenge for it.
, remembering who his masters are. You always will, won’t you?” Bellatrix cooed to him, twirling the stolen wand in his face. She seem pleased with Draco’s lack of response, mistaking frozen terror for subdued obedience.
“Yes, sir.” He lied, he had no clue when exactly it would be. He’d only just suffered through his second heat, so enough information was hard to come by. Was his third going to be the most painful? Was it going to happen so quickly and suddenly that he would have no time or preparation to protect himself or others? So far his magic hadn’t made an appearance during both heats, but the chance of it doing so while Draco was in a state of zero personal control was a frightening thought - it would undoubtedly lead to deadly consequences. Dumbledore was willing to risk muggles in London and Sirius twice now, but it didn’t seem like he was willing to offer Draco the courtesy a third time. “I think sometime before Christmas.”
this song is sooooo good!!!! i hope this girl becomes crazy famous !!!!!!!
paint-spell. It was one hell of an eye-sore.
That large, toothy mouth split open. Greyback started to laugh. It rumbled and echoed in the amphitheatre.
Draco stumbled blindly around the Sixth Year boys bedroom, even the underwater glow of the lake wasn’t enough for him to find his wand and slippers. It took him longer than he wanted when he finally palmed the correct spot of his bedside table, he lit a dimmed Lumos to illuminate where his slippers were.
me: .......
“Oh, Harry Potter!” A Ravenclaw girl sitting on a desk gasped, she jumped off and brushed her grey pleated skirt down. “Head Master said you’d be joining us, we weren’t so sure what time - I was a little shy to ask. So nice to meet you.” She rushed up to him. She seemed younger than them, maybe by a year or two. Her hair was like spun gold and tied back in a loose ponytail. She had a light dusting of freckles around the centre of her face, it acted like a spider’s web, ensaring you to gaze fixedly on a pair of deep blue eyes. She seemed very naturally pretty.
“Oh Merlin, how did you know what to do!” He barked, he gestured to the side of his blushing neck. Harry stared at it for a few seconds until he understood, but he might have stared a second longer than he should have because Draco was now covering it with a hand and glowering off to the side in embarrassment. “Ooh… Funny thing about that. I didn’t know it would work. It was in that thing that Luna wrote. The Gibbler?”
He had to give it to Draco, though, the punch was spot on. It was as if he’d been keeping a good eye on Sirius with his punching bag for a while - or did Sirius give him private lessons?
Blaise was sitting on the sofa with her on her other side, already under the covers too. The solemn young man had never looked so relaxed in his life.
” Whispered a voice.
“What am I supposed to tell the kid?” Sirius said in distress, hands clasping at his hair.
omg.... my hands.... theyre burning.😵
? You’d let my family and I die if I wasn’t
The ground could come away from beneath Draco’s feet in that moment and it still wouldn’t have been as sudden and gut-wrenching as the feeling of being told his one freedom was going to be taken away from him. So much for the promise from the old man that he would be given the tools and assistance to handle this himself.
In the Headmaster’s study there was the Headmaster himself, with Slytherin’s Head of House standing cautiously in the shadows.
Snape slapped at his teacher’s desk with his hand, the sound was so loud every student had snapped their head up to attention.
They both started to laugh.
edit: also crap i know harry doesnt find the halfblood prince's book until his 6th year which he hasnt even started yet.... BUT lets just pretend he already had it in his 5th year.... ;-)
The word stumbled out of his gaping mouth, it shocked him so much a hand slammed over it to silence any future sounds in fear it lured unwanted attention.
“You don’t… you only show them.”
How much time did Sirius really spend with Draco?
“Uh…Owen?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Would love to trade places if we could.”
Draco couldn’t wipe away the first tears fast enough, and soon several others escaped through his rapidly swiping finger long enough for Harry to notice.
It was too late to decide now.
He was still laughing, Draco couldn’t concentrate when he was laughing so loudly.
They are. “People can also be interested in what you have to say, there’s not much of a conversation happening between you and these guys.”
also me: don't do it....
Draco wished he could wail, but it would have been impossible to hear through the barrier of his helmet and the howling of wind. All the slender boy could do was make a futile attempt to squeeze the man with his thighs and arms until the ordeal was over, whenever that would be. He could handle a ride on a broom, but something about being so close to the ground, with the alien sounds of the muggle vehicles driving just as fast around them, and the unusual and unpredictable nature of which the motorbike moved had Draco fearing for his life.
“What do you have there?” Cawed a woman, her head popped into view just beside Fenrir’s shoulder, curiously peering down with two pitch-black eyes. Long, tangled black hair framed a thin face, and black robes creeped up the length of a long neck, cutting off just below the jawline. He recognised her then, It was his auntie. “Oh, the traitor! Oh, don’t you look handsome. So
in his life -
.” His Headmaster boomed, this was the first time Draco had truly seen the man frustrated. His pure-white hair was wilder than usual, and his usually immaculate robes were wrinkled from lack of proper spell-care. Everyone looked as if they had flinched from the volume in his voice. “No,” he said again, this time more gentle, swiping his hand once through his beard. “Everyone has to make a sacrifice for the greater good, and this is yours. Please just agree to these terms, and I will make sure you’re taken care of during the whole ordeal. Harry will be good for you.”
“My Lord, forgive me…” She heard herself weep out, she could taste the salt of her tears dilute the metal tang overwhelming her tongue (intact, it seemed). “I feared for my son, but I would never wish to slight you. We have been nothing but faithful, your judgement has always been clarity…” She bowed her head straight to the floor, her forehead burnt from the cool touch of the kitchen tiles. A perfect image of submission, all potential expressions of defiance vaporised in one swift move. She felt her hair pooling around her, curtaining her expression of shame and hiding the shake in her shoulders.
“You can trust me, my Lord, us. All of us here.” Bellatrix had crumbled to her feet, succumbing to the white hot rage in his voice, and planted kisses into his ink black robes. “I would never betray you like the slut Omega and two-faced Malfoy’s - “
“Warblers?” Pansy shrieked with delight, looking around with her hands cupping her eyes, like a pair of imaginary binoculars. “Where?”
“Sure, I can pick him up from the station.”
“Well…Whatever you choose… I hope we can stay friends.”
“-Oof!” Cried Draco as he bumped roughly into a warm, solid chest.
“I see.”
Draco forced with all his might to seal his hands together, to snuff out the ball. The will of power it took sent waves of agonising muscle spasms up his forearms and into his shoulders, but with a final shout he was able to kill it. The wind stopped. The light disappeared, and they were momentarily shrouded in darkness until Snape’s candles re-lit themselves magically.
“I swear on all things good and sweet if some prick leaves me another love note or flower in here I’m going to fill it with spiders,”
“We have given you as much time as we can afford. What if when you experience your heat and the disaster by the lake occurs in your bedroom? Lucia has been kind enough to explain to me that with each heat the consequences can be graver than the last. I don’t believe this time around that you would be able to control your emotions enough in such an unusual state.”
The answer that finally came had Draco’s head spin, and he leant back into the pillows.
“Oh shit…” The Alpha said with alarm, stiffening beside the Omega. He at first tried to wipe the tears away himself, but then amended his strategy to grabbing Draco’s wrist and pulling him away and out of the foyer. Out of semi-public and into a classroom that he double checked was empty.
Snape paused, snarled, and then leant back far enough that he was once again leaning against the open door.
“What - why?” Draco said, voice muffled by the Alpha’s chest.
“How did you do that?” Draco interrupted. He had his hands on his hips and was staring up at Harry expectantly.
“I don’t
Harry waved her goodbye and stared back into the flickering flames, it didn’t seem like Ron would be returning to pick up where he left off.
“And where would you go?”
joining Harry at the stairway on the first floor. Since that Saturday morning, this was the first time they’d spoken all week, Harry seemed determined to keep a respectful distance until it was Draco who approached first.
holy shit im on a roll!!!!
Being mindful was a lot harder than Draco imagined. Nothing seemed harder than trying to avoid your internal contradictions, long-repressed fears, and incessant need for validation while doing nothing but sit still observing your
“Oh hi, Romilda. I didn’t know you were in the club.”
“No,” he said. “She didn’t.”
He shuddered at the thought of spending the rest of his two years being homeschooled by the Alpha Sirius and his house elf Kreacher.
“Sure, I’ll take him.”
He didn’t give anyone a chance to stop him as he shoved past the crowd into the hallway, running as fast as his legs could carry him down the corridor, up and then down flights of stairs, he ran until every breath he could take burnt.
The floating suitcase that had followed them vanished along with the house elf, so without anything to pressingly tend to, Draco made his way up the hillside towards the castle for breakfast. His mouth was already watering at the thought and his belly complained for food.
The two boys could only share a heated glance at each other, both their mouths twisted into an uneasy frown.
“You wouldn’t get it.”
Was it worth it?
It took so much of Sirius to remain in his seat. He gripped his jerking thighs and stared accusingly at his crotch. This was all
He decided…
It was now Friday. The days progressed by easily enough for Draco with any incidents. He knew he was martyred, but he wasn’t exactly bullied either. His house made sure he wasn’t, even though Draco was perfectly fine at holding up on his own. Their help was nice but it really wasn't necessary most of the time. Most people weren’t exactly witty enough to last long as the opposition in a game of insults against Draco, and lest everyone forget that he was one of the most magically gifted students in Hogwarts. He was fine. He shook off the doubt about himself and continued his trek up the stone stairs that led from the dungeons.
They had breakfast, hot tea and sweet baked goods. As they ate Sirius told him what he’d gotten up to - which wasn’t much, he confessed that in reality he’d been pretty bored for most of the start of the new school year.
“Why don’t you want to bond, Draco?” What’s stopping you?
He didn’t get the chance to herd everyone into a different direction because Pike deviated and made his approach, yanking her glasses right off her face.
He was supposed to be meeting Potter on the third floor, a median in the castle between Slytherin house and Gryffindor house. All their classes for the day were over, but he was still in his uniform - it was so Filch knew they would be going to a school organised activity, and not shirking off somewhere they shouldn’t be. It was a shame because he was hoping to get a glimpse of those muggle jeans again, they intrigued him - I mean, how can something so restricting and uncomfortable to the touch really be comfortable? Why did they make… arses look so good.
a port-key that looked like an iron just in arms reach. It was there in case the situation turned deadly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, okay. Thanks.” Draco heard Harry say in response, his heart was too busy beating to the point of a heart attack for the Omega to manage words.
She blinked, then reflected a similar grin back. They were understanding each other perfectly.
“We will tell him nothing.” Dumbledore whispered. He leant in close from his side of the Floo, close enough for Sirius to make out the faint details in his severe frown and furrowed brow. “Draco is still a very active problem, he is too volatile. We’ve successfully kept him happy and peaceful enough to not harm you or himself, and I hope things remain this way for as long as possible while he returns to Hogwarts, but this isn’t a matter of
Her smile looked pinched, but she moved on anyway, and pointed towards the extended floating table and the vast amount of available food.
“It’s not…”
Sirius came back after some time, having to deal with preparing the food on his own while Kreacher was still gone. He also used the opportunity to detour back to his own room to slip into a fresh set of clothes, hiding any evidence of the pre-cum stained pyjama bottoms.
Harry trailed off mid-conversation after that, looking on somewhere over Draco’s head. Draco turned, curious at the new distraction that could interrupt such an important conversation, but felt a cold chill rush through his blood when he finally made out what exactly was so interesting.
It shook harder.
Dumbledore concluded with a few unrelated announcements about the student council looking for volunteers to help with the Halloween ball preparations, something about class times changing, a thank you to the house elves’ hard work. He gave a sweeping gesture to the four tables and hundreds of plates of food appeared out of nothing.
“Uh, something about the theme…?”
The Hufflepuff boy tearing down his pants.
“Sirius? You there? Sirius?” Early morning daylight was creeping into the hall from the stairway windows. “Sirius?”
“No,” said the blonde Ravenclaw girl - Luchia? Lulu? He'd forgotten already - exasperatedly, as if Draco was some child. He narrowed his eyes dangerously at her. “If you had been listening we were assigning duties. We’ll work in pairs to finish the duties quickly. You’ll be with Harry working on decorations, I’ll be with Eleanor on catering. Augustus and Romilda are on entertainment. We’ll meet up Fridays to discuss our progress but I hope you can find the time to do additional work on your part-“
Her laugh was muffled a bit by Draco’s hands cupping her cheeks, he gave her a fierce kiss to the forehead. “You stupid girl, I care so much about you. I want you to like Luna too. She’s actually kind of funny once you have a real conversation with her. Now, are you gonna help me hand these out?”
It must have come undone at some point while she tore at her hair, writhing in pain on the floor. There was still clumps of blonde hair between her fingers as she looked down.
remember this is a drarry story!! so no matter what happens thats the end game ;^)
Headmaster was now calling.
The room was filled with vivid orange light from the setting sun, a view of it sliding behind the Scottish hills could be seen from the large castle windows.
“What like… Drive it?”
“You wouldn’t,” she said, shocked.
He looked at his deep emerald jumper, it was made out of an expensive and rare plant fibre, making the threads look lush like a leaf from a rainforest. It served him well, there wasn’t anything wrong with it and he didn’t need to mess around with its quality by transfiguring it into something else… But he couldn’t help himself.
Draco hated people like that, the only person someone needed to be that senselessly loyal to was Draco himself. “Sparing my parents because he thinks I’m fit!”
“No,” she interrupted. “You haven’t been observing, you’ve been sulking, like a little miserable squib. What is with you? Talk to me, what the hell is the point in moping like this? You literally haven’t moved from that spot since this morning!”
hoards of people flocked to bask in the Alpha’s strong, young allure.
Draco felt a nervous trickle of sweat go down his back. He debated following before he could Disapperate,
“You process things like a sore loser. Look at yourself for god’s sake!” She put one hand on her hip and waved the other in his presence. “You haven’t re-spelled your hair tidy in hours! You still haven’t gotten out of those muggle rags —"
“Or, I could go as the plague you eventually die from.” Draco retorted, voice mild, but he was smiling wide enough to feel a sliver of teeth expose.
He tugged at the royal mantle attached to his shoulders until he heard the popping of undone stitching. With the mantle tossed aside, he got to work loosening his costume’s cravat, but not quite pulling it off yet. He scrubbed at his eyes, attempting to rub away the tell-tale sting.
“You heard me. I was told Friday’s only for this pointless punishment.” Draco crossed his arms and jut a hip out.
The door was pushed open and Draco could make out Lucia’s blonde head peak through for a second, after seeing it was only Draco inside she smiled and walked in, posture relaxed. “Hi Draco, how are you? Oh I see you brought the notes Romilda was telling me about…” She picked one up after putting down her armful of note books and quill pens. “Wow, this looks a little hard. It would be wicked if you pull it off though! Here let me show you what we’re planning - “ She swapped one of Draco’s notes for hers and thrust it into his direction. He charily plucked it from her hand and began to read as she continued to speak. “ - I don’t know if your family ever had this growing up but my family are crazy about Madeira cakes, but we’d do it with almonds and candied pumpkin. I wanted to have the elves help me make a massive one. As big as the Great Hall’s clock, with little dancing skeletons on it. It’s going to be
“How much longer before I have Hogwarts,” he asked, instead of forgiving Bellatrix for her insolence. She trembled in anticipation for the moment he’d cast his wrath-some, god-like red gaze on her - Before anyone could answer him, a quick and loud pounding came from the closed door, followed by a gruff voice.
The table of Death Eaters began to laugh as the Dark Lord’s lipless mouth stretched, resembling a smile.
“Alright,” Sirius said. He called out for Kreacher, who Apparated between them instantly. His glassy, bulging eyes peered at the Omega with intrigue for a few seconds, long enough for Draco to lose the will to keep his legs straight. Like a doll, he dropped lifelessly on the floor, crumbling to his knees. The sudden loud thud of his bone against the floor prophesied painful looking black bruised knees.
Draco felt tears well up in his eyes, and he shakily raised his own hand to give a little wave goodbye in return.
“Perfect, so did I.” Without warning Draco grabbed him by the neck of his shirt and dragged him along the corridor. The taller boy weakly argued and half-walked-half-stumbled after the abrasive Omega. The entirety of the floor felt un-intruded,
He kicked off from his rest on a row of lockers, cruising quickly up to the smaller boy.
“Lucia Madley, Head Witch of the student council and food organiser.” He politely clapped for a moment before extending his hand to her from beside the podium where she took what looked like great effort towards it. Because of her glowing yellow skin, you couldn’t tell if she was blushing. But from her worried and unsure expression, anxious hand gestures, and longing glances towards the stairway leading off the stage, you could tell she was totally out of her element. She only seemed to relax a little when Dumbledore called for Eleanor to the stage next. Then Romilda. Then Augustus. And then Harry - and the roar of the crowd was almost deafening, so much so that Draco wasn’t sure if he was actually deaf once his own name was called, because the Great Hall was suddenly deathly quiet…
“Too right,” Harry agreed, still watching the tall figure retreating away.
Draco humm’d at her in acknowledgment.
“I mean, I wanted to ask you - “
“You speak to all your kings like that?” Draco parried, suddenly worried that his banter was said too harshly, too sarcastically, but Harry only barked out a laugh in response, then slowly dipped down low onto one knee. He drew out his silver sword and leant his unbalanced weight against it point-down, like a knight vowing a pledge. Draco looked around, embarrassment creeping up on him. People were watching them, some looked confused, some looked delighted, some looked
Out from the darkness came Fenrir Greyback, not the Dark Lord. The smell of rot and pure Alpha musk creeped towards Draco from where the werewolf was standing.
Sparing no time to waste, their helmets were enchanted over their heads, and then with a harsh lurch forward they kicked off into the streets. As soon as they were out of site from the main roads, the bike tilted onto its back wheel and launched into the sky.
Lo-and-behold, however, as Harry sat down next to him where Adrian was sitting. He put his hand over Draco’s knee in what he could assume was meant to be comforting.
He had come up with ideas like snakes swimming in water-bubble-balloons, or little demons transfigured from buttons to flutter around blowing fire. His favourite were the shadow animals that would run around the room and up the ceiling, it was the spell he was most excited to see it fully performed in a room after all the hours it took working out the technical issues.
Sirius looked up to observe him for an unusual amount of time before flashing another quick, self-assured smile. “‘Course.”
Moaned Myrtle, hovering around the ceiling. The ghost was filling the loo with a soft, eery weep - Draco rolled his eyes, he could see right through her, both literally and figuratively.
He, along with Pansy and Blaise, made the journey up to the ground floor. He looked down at himself as soon as he reached the final step out of the dungeons, reaching a hand up to stroke the front of his doublet, decorated with detailed embroidery and jewels sewn along the seams. His hand traveled up until it reached his throat, the collar of his doublet high enough to cut close against the edge of his jaw, then to he corrected the fastener of his black royal mantle, which would have traditionally been made of dragon or unicorn hide, then he moved on to his ears, the lobes were weighed down slightly with heavy jewelled earrings, and finally to his hair, which curled up with a flick from the impression of the sharp, wicked-looking silver crown on top of his head. He was the very historically significant, and deadly, Wizard king of the 15th Century, Lord Dominus. Only Blaise got it (which was more than a little disappointing), who went as a vampire for the third year in a row. Pansy had gone in something more risqué, her costume was furry and skin-tight, tan, and covered in
Sirius’ stomach lurched, and his throat was slowly closing in on the words he whispered out. “Do you think she’s dead?”
“I’m fine, leave me.” Draco said, covering his eyes with one hand and used the other to gesture in a swishing motion towards the door.
Potter’s mouth went slack as he stared down at Draco’s wand pressed bruisingly tight into the flesh of his hand, the tan skin taught and going white.
“Okay. On the condition you be my date to the ball. I wanted to do something nice together for once, and maybe… show you off?” Potter was rubbing his neck, it was a wonder how the damned thing wasn’t rubbed raw by now.
or to find Dumbledore and see if things were going to be okay, but the ideas fizzled from his mind as soon as a gauntlet-clad hand placed itself on his shoulder, slowly pulling him around.
The seventeen year old was in better shape than ever, and he was brimming with energy.
(See the end of the chapter for
Without diverging his heated stare, Draco whipped out his wand and wordlessly shot a fire ball at the remaining shards of Luna’s glasses on the floor, burning them in a surge of heat until they couldn’t be recognised, let alone magically repaired. The smell of hot plastic filled his nose and mouth.
(See the end of the chapter for
i wonder how much of the end game you guys can already predict? ;) i think i've just about figured out how i want things to end and this will probably be dragged out to a 20-25 page fic (was originally meant to be a 12 pager!!)
song credit at the beginning:
“The first time I was desperate, lonely, and I wanted to leave that house by any means necessary. I wouldn’t use it as your argument’s saving grace.” Draco’s eyes narrowed to slits.
“No! No, Luna - “ Draco shouldered Potter aside so he could stand directly in front of her “ - I needed to apologise for what happened with Flint. It was…” He struggled for the words, he didn’t really know how to apologise, he just needed this feeling to go away. “…Cruel. Whatever I owe you for the glasses I’ll double it. Triple.”
“I don’t want to lose my freedom,” Draco bit out, sounding closer now, like he’d moved right up to the door.
Draco lifted a hand to stop Harry, sparing him from saying another word.
He lifted a thigh and pushed the purple toy downwards, the side of it ran over his quivering belly until it was flushed side by side with his own reddened cock, dwarfing it. The tip of his penis was weeping just as much as his cunt was hidden behind his balls, and he rutted against the rubber shaft until a layer of syrupy slick clung to it.
Draco wasn’t prepared and sputtered, shoving the boy off of him. “Wh - No - You - You can’t do this you’ll be expelled!”
Sirius also had to admit to himself that in spite of his meek, unassuming appearance, the Omega was ferociously strong. Sirius was no stranger to the smell of fear and pain, the sounds of it, the night of Draco’s heat ensured there was never shortage of either. Besides the one slip up when Draco cried out for Sirius, sometime in middle of the night, he’d recovered from it quickly enough and handled the rest of the situation on his own. It must have been painful, a never-ending hell, his mind likely in a constant war waged against itself. The more Sirius realised just how much Draco was willing to put up with out of pride, the more his fondness grew.
“Why can’t you just be grateful for my help?” Potter snarled, in seconds his hands came up to grab Draco by the wrists, squeezing so tight the sensation of blood pumping was overwhelming in Draco’s reddening hands.
stories of the other Omegas recalling their beginning, but to actually see him… He looked like he barely graced eleven. Draco felt something gouge a piece of his heart. He recognised the novel scent of newly presented gender,
“The one scheduled for four-thirty this morning, sir. Niffler will ready your things. But please wake up.”
Draco nodded frantically at first, but slowed when it quickly made the new ringing in his ears worse. He forced his throat to produce the words. “Yes…Auntie.”
The Alpha was chuckling and in his peripheral Draco watched him come into the room to scoop the toys into his arms, the site of the bundle was lewder than anything Draco had ever seen in his life. “Alright, alright. Was just trying to help, kiddo.”
“Yeah,” Harry agreed, snarling at him. Others at the table were all watching them, straining to hear the conversation.
The rest of them, however, went straight to gorge on the feast lain out on rows of black floating tables across the other side of the Great Hall.
“Everything happened.” Draco said, but shook his head when he realised that didn’t really make sense. “I’ve been given three days to accept being mated by Potter on my heat or I’ll be expelled.”
Harry looked up and gave her a crooked smile, he then shot Ron a look that said he wanted him to leave. Ron did, albeit complaining and with an indignant puff of air from his chest. “Don’t mind him” Harry said loudly, as if trying to speak over Ron’s grumbling, while offering the now vacant chair in front of him. The fire nearby crackled in the moments of quiet and the heat that radiated on Harry’s shins would become more noticeable.
“No…”
Sunday rolled over.
very short chapter this time but i think it was important as a stand alone
He was panting, the two Alphas could only gawk in stunned silence.
Pansy didn’t waste a beat and repaired it with a flick of her wand.
“Harry, wait!” Ron shouted after him, realising where he was going.
“An unbonded Omega wouldn’t be able to resist releasing slick as it’s exposed genitals are presented to an Alpha. You didn’t give up a drop, so despite not completing his mateship Greyback clearly did enough to contain you biologically.” He left the lounge to leave Draco to his own devises, but Draco could only stare after him with open, horrified bewilderment.
It was only more of Draco’s incoherent ramblings, along with the sound of his body rocking back and forth on the bed, the legs creaked too loudly for Sirius’ sensitive ears and he had to stick a finger in one for a second, as if picking an itch.
and thank you all for the comments!!!!! its very appreciated and a huge motivator for the neverending updates
if you guys cant already tell i just really like drawing draco lmao 🤣idk if i started writing this story just so i could use it as an excuse who knows! either way i also really like writing too and its fun to use both as a tool to express the story. also please feel free to give feed back on the story my way - i do have an overall goal im trying to get to but i do change things up when i get inspired by other peoples vision for the story too.
“I’m ready now to do what I have to.” Draco didn’t think he could live through another heat alone. “If my family is saved.”
He squeezed harder, there was a squeaker in its small chest that strained to the point of soundlessness.
All there was left to do was wait - he seemed to be in too much shock to reach for his wand in his back pocket - either until the ground cooled off enough to walk barefooted on, or until the castle realised what had happened and its inhabitants swarmed the scene.
They crossed the bridge between Hogwarts’ grounds and Hogsmeade. Not one villager or storekeep was up yet, everything was shut and every window had their blinds drawn. After crossing through the town, the terminal could finally be made out down a cobblestoned slope, the steam train waiting for them at the platform, awake and pouring clouds of smoke from its chimney.
He looked back down at himself, at his hands. He needed an explanation. He needed answers. How was he able to perform such intense magic without a spell in mind, let alone a wand in hand.
He ignored the high-pitched cries and pleads of the dead-girl as he pushed open the door into the abandoned hallway -
Maybe it was time to talk to her.
“Okay - we need to go…” Draco tried again to salvage the situation.
It was spiked. But not with much, a little cheap fire whiskey. It only left a mild burn at the very tip of his tongue. No doubt something more substantial would make their way in people’s cups later.
The aged Alpha and power warlock’s face could be seen through the fireplace, a bright red glow to his features exaggerated by the Floo fire. He was stuffing tobacco into the chamber of his pipe.
broad jawed mug was still as handsome, even his short-trimmed stubble was sheared in the same angles. His usual golden skin was cast in a red light as his image projected from the flames of the Floo. Draco and Dumbledore were leaning in slightly with bent knees, close enough to feel the heat of the fire tingle their skin. Lucia had been sent away back to Ravenclaw house only ten minutes ago.
“Yes.” Draco said.
There was no way in Hell he could have predicted this heat happening as spontaneously as it did. His journey as a late presenting Omega was endlessly burdened with problems and challenges.
It bowed a little less dramatically that time, then, while still slumped forward, Disapparated out of existence. The crack sounded like an imagined whip on Draco’s back.
He toed a piece of hay aside with his shoe. “I don’t keep a diary for it or anything.” He huffed a laugh to himself.
“I don’t care, he can talk to me tomorrow. I don’t want to see him. Move!”
“I - I - Unbelievable! You’re so rude -“
if you're anything like me your favourite types of fics are when everyone is a dysfunctional mess!
She was also beautiful, you couldn’t help but want to touch her. “Let go!”
Bellatrix only whimpered, deflated.
whoooo boy i feel like this one was an explainy one!
He shut his eyes and concentrated. He thought about the feeling of it oozing out of his skin, the weight of the magic in his hands. The memories he called to mind blinked one by one
Harry quickly managed enough of a grip then on Draco to wrestle his back to the floor completely. He settled on top of him, holding both his two squirming wrists in his own much larger hand.
It was late evening when Harry made his way up the spiralling staircase towards the Headmaster’s office. He was hoping the point of the meeting was to clue Harry as to how Draco was doing, or better yet when he would be back.
He didn’t wait for anyone to respond, only pushed out of his seat without a second to spare. Out of the corner of his eye Draco could see Potter had unmistakably done the same and split from his friends to weave his way to the grand doors.
“Sorry, kitten, never did a trial run of it. Storekeep said it would impress you.” He was looking down dejectedly at pile of glitter on the floor.
a huge inspo for my writing!
Potter took a lungful of air then blew it out to the ceiling before looking back down at Draco.
The bell to end lunchtime rung throughout the school, but being the highest point of the castle the sound in the Owlery was a little faint. “Sorry I couldn’t be of more help,” she brushed her skirt of crumbs and hay. “If it makes you feel any better, an Alpha doesn’t have to be forever.”
“We’re supposed to be meeting in the Great Hall now to set up.” Draco heard Harry say in stead of greeting.
The momentum of force it took Draco to swing his entire body into that punch had him skipping a couple steps forward before he regained his balance. Potter had flown down the hall and divided the newly gathered crowd cleanly in two.
. Draco looked down to see he was standing on the last remaining rock around, the rest of the area around him in a 100 metre radius had reduced into a smoking black desert.
“That’s no fun… Maybe our costumes could match?” He was flirting. Draco couldn’t help but blink mutely for a second - Harry Potter, destroyer of the Dark Lord,
Draco took a sip of the stuff, sampling it.
He scoffed again.
It nodded so hard it’s large radar ears flapped against its wrinkled head, clearly delighted by the acknowledgement from the great Wizard himself. It’s shiny black eyes then finally rotated between the two of them, addressing Draco as well. “Mr Potter, Mr Malfoy, sirs, Headmaster would like to see the two of you before you leave for your dorms.”
“Where’s he going?” Asked Seamus, confused.
Sirius staggered to his feet at that, ear to the door. His eyes wildly darted around the dark hallway, his eyes - having adjusted to it long ago - instinctually looked out for trespassers and potential rivals.
He then plucked his dressing gown from the back of his writing desk’s chair, shouldering it on.
…when Draco bound to Harry Potter. It helped finding Harry likeable over the weeks, give or take a few less than ideal interactions, often fuelled by Harry’s jealously, or his stupidity.
“Ah, ah. For all intents and purposes, if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck then it’s a duck.” He snatched the glasses off Pike’s face, who let out a displeased mewl at his lost prize, and threw them to the ground - Marcus stomped the pointy, bright orange plastic frames into the grass and soil, crushing them into little broken pieces.
“So you did this on purpose!” Snape shouted, stepping forward from his resting point.
He admired the way he looked - his clear skin was a little pink at the cheeks but not in a bad or unattractive way, his nearly white hair was tousled in deliberate loose waves to the side, his straight-cut jeans and cropped hem emerald shirt looked flattering and hugged him in all the right places. He looked expensive, with his fingers decorated in his collection of fine silver rings, several of them studded with green or black gems. He looked like a prize.
also! lemme know if theres a scene you'd wanna see illustrated, ill draw the one with most fan clout. still coming up with some rough sketches as i post this now.
He was hoping he would not have had to come back, but Draco was sadly realising life as an Omega meant your expectations were often ripped from you, and you were left to spiral in the decisions of others who they themselves have decided symbolic ownership of you.
The Alpha snorted, it sounded like a short, unhappy growl at the back of his throat. He bared his teeth briefly before hiding them with his thin lip.
“No,” Her master said, in a ghostly whisper. “We will wait. We still have some time. If it is ready now, as you said, Mr. Yaxley, then we have an upper hand.”
Dumbledore leant back assessingly. “…Yes. ”
Draco gawked at him for a long time.
“What aren’t you telling me?” Draco frowned.
Sirius noticed and propelled himself to his feet, height looming and a little confronting.
It was probably half past seven by the time Draco had retreated from the first floor to make his weary way back to the Slytherin common room in the dungeons. It had
“Coz it was the nice thing to do, Jesus - why do you have to make everything so complicated.
i also have a teeny bit of chapter 24 written (5k i think looking at it) and chapter 25 (2k? 3k??) and i actually think this fic might turn out to be 26 chapters long. the way i write is an absolute head fuck im soo sorry everyone. i was a machine with the updates in the beginning but as soon i started dabbling with plot and making things make some form of sense i started to get lost lol. FORGIVE ME!!!!
He then looked down at his clothes, the same emerald green jumper and grey slacks, he’d never thought about changing it up before, not particularly fussed about impressing Muggles. It’s not like they really knew what tasteful fashion was. Although… He’d grown an enriched appreciation for denim jeans. It wasn’t Muggles he would be meeting either, Sirius was probably waiting for him with that damned motorbike. It could be heard whenever the man was leaving or returning to the house, sometimes it would wake Draco up in the middle of the night.
“Yea, I clearly fucking don’t!”
“Mr. Malfoy, sir, please come with Niffler to the Headmaster’s room.”
“I’m not - “ She tried again.
Draco wasn’t buying it. His eyes narrowed.
What happened next felt sped up ten times normal reality, and every time Harry tried to process and replay the events, to piece together the splintered chaos, it would all rush by too fast to make any sense of it. The attack had caught the school by complete, utter surprise.
Harry stepped in close enough until the air he was breathing out through his nose was rustling the bangs across Draco’s forehead.
Draco allowed the gesture, and let his face be held, but he still averted his eyes - it might have translated as shy, but the truth was he felt more awkward than anything. “Yeah. Something like that. Look… Harry.” Draco said, the name sounding foreign to his ears out-loud. Was this the first time he’d ever said the boy’s first name without a hint of distain or sarcasm? He missed the days before their genders became such pivotal factors to their lives, it was all so simple. “It’s not going to be that long before my heat starts up again…And I…”
He needed
“Do they? Do they really? Yours didn’t, they got together right after high school because it looked good and that’s what people were expecting them to do. Same with mine. Same with Blaise - in the beginning, at least. True love is bullshit, kitten. You know that. It’s stupid and a waste of time. Potter has money and power, what more could you ask for really?”
Bellatrix’s heart hammered in her chest at the excitement after another successful raid of territory. The Death Eaters under her command swarmed the three story mansion overlooking the northern coast. This was now their fourth seize of property today, and it was late into the evening now, by this point this year the Death Eaters were in possession of dozens of secret locations across the English countryside.
Draco slapped both his hands over his ass, horrified by the man’s lack of filter. “Good god, I hate you.”
“I don’t know…I just.” Draco rubbed at his eyes, they were watering up again, he was too exhausted to come up with a good enough lie.
“…I…” He said again, just a whisper.
It’s vitally important that it runs successfully. This is our opportunity to put the students minds at ease even just for a single evening. With everything that has happened we owe it to the children of Hogwarts. You both know more than anyone that Voldemort -“ He ignored Draco’s wince “ - looms nearer. His plot will be complete any month now. We need peace in this school more than ever.”
Ron was smirking like he’d won.
Harry growled.
- what if feeling this rotten would make the Omega attention unbearable? But besides the few dozen glances and intentional brushings of shoulders initiated by Alphas throughout the day, Draco was managing his… condition... relatively well. Although his hand was getting a little sore from the number of times he had to crumble up little love messages, poems, and invitations to clubs or Hogsmeade. Things were no doubt going to get a lot worse after his 4th elective, Defence Against the Dark Arts, which he frustratedly remembered was shared with the Gryffindor Sixth Years and taught by Professor Snape now.
“Never in your life, you miserable old fucking
believe this was all it would take to win Draco over? Pretty little favours? But to Draco's horror - after long days in solitude - it was working. The man had fucking snatched him so hard it left bruises for days. He’d shouted in his face and insulted him in front of people over something Draco couldn’t control. He was an old bastard who, just like Harry, was just biologically succumbed to infatuation over his sex Draco had no choice being.
“Never say never,” Sirius warned over his shoulder, but there was a hint of playfulness in his voice paired with that coy smile.
Draco’s eyes were so large and round, it was a little hypnotic at times if you let yourself fall for their charm.
His mother and father saying goodbye.
“Draco!” Draco was shaken awake at the shoulder by Blaise and Adrian.
The Omega swung around and hurried off, making his escape around the corner and out of view.
ALSO please don't be afraid to say that draco and the gang are straight up BULLIES!!! because they are. they're little shits in the books. that's why i loved them. i was hoping they would get the character development they so sorely deserved but nope... guess it's my job!
Sirius sat hunched on a stool, just outside Draco’s door.
“Wh-huh.” Draco managed out.
Harry only smiled back crookedly, as if he was still a little unsure of himself, but that didn’t stop his brazenness from taking over long enough to switch tactics and to put a hand between Draco’s shoulder blades, now guiding him up the stairs towards the ten metre tall castle doors.
He was going to need to bond to Harry, done properly on the day of his heat. No half-measures, no half-bonds, no exceptions.
A couple of moments passed.
They left without a fuss, and now Draco felt the weight of consequences settle over him.
And then the elf Disapparated, whisking Draco off with it from the dungeons, leaving behind only the echo of a crack of lightning.
fault.
“Oh,” she blushed, but nodded and stepped in. “No it’s okay, I don’t mind…”
He worried himself sick getting out of bed
“What the hell is matter with you?” Blaise scoffed as she de-tangled herself from the quilt.
“No…Go ahead. I’d rather observe,” Draco insisted half-heartedly, turning his head to the side to free his face from her hold, but she wouldn’t budge. Her palms closed firmly into the meat of his cheeks, squashing his face until his lips pursed and he struggled to breathe through his nose. “Ooff—Pansy—“
It was Luna.
When he averted his gaze again to plot how to say things next, a commotion was unfolding nearby the punch bowl that attracted both their attentions, and Draco quickly lost track of his thoughts. A group of Alphas were ganging up on who he recognised to be the Omega First Year, whose face was twisted into an unhappy and frightened glower.
The party had died down by now. It was just Pansy and Draco left to drunkenly cuddle on the sofa. Pansy was resting her head in Draco’s lap, who was running his fingers through her silky jet black hair to clean out the silver streamers. It was straighter than Harry’s, and not as thick. Draco realised just then that he’d never actually run his hands through Harry’s hair before.
Zabini didn’t look effected in the slightest, he looked almost emboldened by the attention. If possible his already perfect posture straightened a centimetre more.
. Draco glowed in the increasing cheers now coming from Slytherin house. Then, he heard the sound of clapping come from behind him, and Draco turned to see Harry broadly bring his hands together in applause.
She blended easily enough into the crowds, despite her striking pattern, as they were absorbed into the crowd of eager students who were still arriving in drones, all dressed or glimmered into their own costumes. The liberal access to magic made imaginations churn out very wayward results. Some students paused as they came in - taking the time to chat with the ghosts or to admire the decorations and dancing shadows swirling around the entrance - giving Draco a moment to see a number of small and giant monsters, creatures with elongated limbs or no appendages at all, or bright coloured skin and hair.
Maybe it was the proximity of being around an unbonded Alpha for so long, but a ache in Draco’s neck was now slowly making itself present and as he reached up to curl his fingers over the tender flesh, he couldn’t help the started flinch and a hiss in distress. This was happening too fast for Draco to respond properly, he staggered back, desperate for some space. If only he could escape the prison of his fiery hot skin.
“But… But can’t I just clean? Something? Anything?” He pleaded.
"You have my word, we will teach you.”
“Oh, Harry! I’ve missed you. How’d you find the Quibbler I gave you?”
“Darling!” Pansy greeted happily, noticing his arrival through the wall, she lifted up part of the quilted blanket beside her as an invitation for the Omega to slip in.
On queue, after the last person had made it off the stage, a swarm of shadow animals rushed to the stage. They glided against the floors and walls, then peeled off like shavings of black paper. They drifted and fluttered into the air weightlessly. Then exactly as Draco had cast, they performed an ornate dance routine against the colourful sources of light. Soon they draw together to create a little picture show of Hogwarts, its founders, and the Pagan Witch history following the epic tradition of Samhain, leading to Halloween. No one asked him to do it, and just because it was a punishment didn’t mean he’d hand in shoddy work. Draco was always proud of his work. And he was a great fan of history.
“No, Pans. Darling - shit - “ Draco dropped his mountain of tabloids to the floor, some of them slid and skid across the polished wood. “Listen to me, Pansy. I’m not upset with you. You piss me the hell off a great deal of times, but Morgana’s promise I would never hate you. A lot’s happened. A lot I’m not ready to talk about, and I’ve been having to deal with it a lot on my own. Lovegood was one of the first people to actually just think of me as a person since this awful summer break. I felt like I owed her, you understand don’t you. It’s like… Remember when you weren’t sure about those green robes to one of my parents functions, you were worried people would make fun of you? You were scared they’d call you a fat lime?”
hope you guys are doing ok right now! keep your hands clean ✌️
“Did she specifically ask you to keep me at Black’s family house?” Draco urged.
“Stop - get up you stupid fool people are
(See the end of the chapter for
When was Draco ever going to stop embarrassing people?
“I don’t speak in riddles, boy. Why did I do
Pansy suddenly materialised in front of him and clasped his face in her fragrant hands.
It ached sharply whenever Draco forced it.
I think i might draw fenrir next for this chap. movie version is fugly as and i love me some bad boy wolf people
“Oh… Nothing special.” Draco said, eyes remaining up, using his wand to reshape a particular web hanging in the ceiling corner.
“Wuh…Hub…Fuh! What the…Ha...Oh oh…”
.” She snapped her teeth with a click.
impatiently waiting for their arrival, and they hurried up the stairs without stopping to question it.
you back to the Common Room this morning. So? What is this, are you an item now or what?”
The pain is otherworldly, but he still can’t scream. The blood spurts across the black soil.
His heart stopped…
And then, it dawned on Draco, this girl was an Omega. He could smell her now the more agitated she got. She must have been on pheromone suppressants for a very long time for Draco to be so blind of it. Potter’s weird behaviour was starting to make sense, and he looked up at the taller boy to find him looking rigid and nervous. How many were there really in this school? Including himself, so far there were three, out of nearly 300 students.
ALSO!! NSFW!! graphic descriptions of ~sexual activity~
And so Draco did. He shut his eyes and opened his clenched fists, palms out. Before his damned birthday, he was on top, not because of some meaningless second gender, but because of his wit and drive.
“No it’s not that.” He could ignore Ron, he couldn’t ignore Harry.
She was sitting by herself under a tree - she was talking to herself. She had on a big pair of orange, sun-shaped glasses and she was wearing a metal contraption on top of her head, it looked like a collage of muggle devises glued together and stacked into a pyramid-shaped hat.
For the last few days the boy had been intentionally trying to forget their after-class meeting from a week ago.
“Oh, I reckoned it’d make things a little more pleasant for you.”
She wasn’t wrong. His deeply conservative family, if forced to make the choice at the end of an active wand, would rather discuss Muggle politics than the goings-on regarding their second gender, especially of an
Her brows knit together and she pouted hard.
“I would’ve thought you’d end up going off with Sirius.”
Harry shrugged, now the one to look embarrassed. “Well… Yeah? I can smell everything off you? What you’ve eaten, who you’ve spoken to…”
He took a self-assuring breath and threw his own school bag down onto the clearest space on the floor, sitting himself delicately down. “So anyway, as I was saying. I need your help.”
“Please do, I’d love to share notes.” She stuffed the mystical bright pink artefact back into her canvas book bag. “So not much time for a strategy, huh?”
. Draco dropped down onto his toes, so he could study her sad eyes. “Please, can I make it up to you some other way then?”
“It was once something fearsome.”
“He’s not completely bonded? What does that mean? How’s he been allowed to go on like that for this long?” There was a sudden shift in his tone, he seemed more alert and agitated, like a poked lion.
he causes harm but
“Maybe you should, I do.” Luna said.
Draco’s Omega body had submitted in seconds. Potter’s snarling mouth was moving, but Draco couldn’t hear and he wasn’t going to give him the satisfaction of reading his lips. He felt powerless, but he wasn’t going to let Potter know that.
“It was the last thing Narcissa told Severus, that was a week ago now. She said she was suspecting the Dark Lord was losing trust in her as each day passed. Every moment together he would spend a great deal of time in her mind, it was only a matter of time before she succumbed to one passing thought of love for her son… or doubt for the Dark. She was very skilled in Legilimency, but not as skilled as Severus. If Voldemort suspected her…Well then.”
Then he heard Pansy scream somewhere in the crowd, he could see her swaying back and forth on Blaise’s shoulders. What she was saying was completely unintelligible - but, whatever the hell she was saying, she was saying it with
“Then why can’t you just fuck off?” Draco spat, spinning around and shoving him roughly at the shoulders, the force of it had the taller boy skidding back a couple of inches, nearly slipping and falling in the crowded entry hall.
hope the writing is coherent enough! just trying to give you the feel of the book while also being as fanficy as possible
Before Harry could bite out a reply, Romilda walked into their conversation. She cleared her throat and waved a hand in front of Harry’s line of site. “Hey, Scar-boy. I wanted to ask you some things about the decorations.”
He put them on and was exaggeratedly swaggering around for an applause from the group, which he got, save from Draco. “Hey check me out in these!”
There was a slight breeze rustling the sheer bed curtains around them, it came from the draft wafting through the dungeon tunnels. Blaise convinced himself that it caused the shiver that ran down his spine and not from the terror of Draco’s quiet rage.
“Forget a minute, I’m going to bed. Spell out the stains from the sofa when you’re done, Mr. Manly-Men.”
As soon as the door was unlocked with a sequence of taps from Sirius’s wand, colourful streamers burst out of two poles pointed directly at the entrance. Hundreds of sparkling string swirled down to Draco’s legs before shooting up in front of him, forming the words ‘
Draco and Harry both took a seat in front of the grand executive desk after a quick exchange of nods to both men.
“I didn’t think you’d be coming back this time,” Harry said,
This must have been the
Neither of them offered a glance to the other, both determined to stare out into the crowd. Draco could easily make out Luna, dressed as a butterfly, with a goblet of punch in her hand, sniffing it with a mystified gaze.
That he would continue to follow Dumbledore’s orders. He sat, quiet as a shadow, and listened out for any signs of magical use.
Draco smiled at him then, a surprised but genuine thing. It made his pale eyes glitter. Sirius wanted to kiss it, to taste the unforgettable sweetness and to revel in another heated moment not unlike that time before the start of school term - the secret kiss in Draco’s bedroom.
He put a hand on his thigh, fingers tracing lines into the cotton, they were comfortable and a classic cut, but they weren’t very striking or note-worthy. After a quick re-visit into his visual memory, he waved his wand over them and the colour rippled from grey to blue, the fabric became more textured and turned into faded denim, the size shrunk a little bit and felt more fitted around the crotch and thighs.
not wanting to misspend what scarce time he had left to solve what was
Dissatisfied, Harry stormed out of the classroom.
also i looked it up they apparently have lockers in hogwarts so thats super cute
“Snape is losing Voldemort’s trust. As far as I know Voldemort has little faith in anyone, even the Malfoy’s have lost all control of the Manor. I predict we will have to engage with wands soon. Having Draco on our side could possibly turn the tide.”
The werewolf did as he was told, and silently stalked into the master study. His imposing two meter figure dwarfed everyone in the room, and he smiled in greeting as he looked around, his mouth and teeth were covered in blood and it ran in stark red lines into his greying beard. His white cotton shirt had a bib of browning blood down to his belly button, there was no guesswork as to what the Alpha might have been instructed to do earlier. He still hadn’t retracted his wolf claws and they stood out imposingly, black and curved like talons, pieces of raw meat still hung by the sinew at the tips of some of them. As if he noticed Bellatrix staring at them, the man lifted his fingers to his mouth and sucked them clean of blood and meat, he was still chewing on a particularly fatty or tough piece when the Dark Lord continued, closing the door after him:
“When will the portal be ready?”
“That’s a little traditional for our oh-so-progressive Headmaster. But that’s not too bad, didn’t you say Potter was good in bed?” Pansy smirked.
song lyrics in the beginning:
The dark Wizard, not man, never a man, was an unstoppable machine, and his fragile alliances was making things difficult for him.
“No - Mr. Malfoy must.” The house elf was determined and stood its ground, its wrinkled skin almost seemed to swallow Draco’s hand whole, so Draco had to pull away in disgust. “You must come.”
. Draco wondered if he already had an Alpha lined up for him.
Harry whirled around to him as if he could sense it, slowly holstering his wand back into his costume’s belt.
“Draco, hi. You look nice,” she said quickly once she deemed him close enough, her voice loud enough for him to hear her while not quite yet crossing the remaining distance.
It wasn’t until later into the night did Sirius jerk back awake. A sound came from Draco’s room, like he’d fallen out of bed - an unmistakably bodily crash followed by a pained groan. For a long time after that no other sounds followed. The smell that crept from the room to meet Sirius was akin to torture, like he was held back from an oasis by a flimsy wooden door.
“Why? Surely you’d be teachers pet more than ever. Head Alpha’s favourite.” Adrian said from a nearby chair, wiping his lip free of spilt liquor.
“Could you tell me what happened?” He was awfully gentle, taking a seat at the foot of the medical cot that Draco was now tucked into. Draco’s eyes cast to Snape who stood by the entrance - his presence like a dark, intimidating shadow.
charm, it echoed, and then was soon followed with silence.
, Sirius thought with a warm feeling in his belly. “He’d performed basic magic with his wand a couple of times again but nothing unusual, no weird behaviours. No spike in emotions, nothing at least to make me think it was serious.”
It’s been a whole week since Draco arrived on Monday morning.
. His parents were willing to ship him away to avoid being murdered by their beloved Dark Lord, instead of just running away with him, the three of them together. Draco couldn’t even picture a reality where his family give up their lives and political power - as one of the most elite and prestigious pure-blooded Wizards in the United Kingdom - just to save him. They loved him, but they could never love him
With a flick of his wrist, Dumbledore’s wand glowed and it casted a charm that started his music machine, which Draco was beginning to pick up meant that the man was likely going to talk about something serious.
“Get up, you lazy queen. We’re going out.” Blaise ordered, throwing Draco a pair of lightweight white robes.
Satisfied, the taller boy opened the map and offered the blank, yellowing parchment up to Draco. “Do you remember?”
“You got pissed? Is that what I smelt off you in Snape’s first class?” Harry couldn’t help but laugh. Draco Bloody Malfoy, pissed on his first day of the semester? He didn’t know him as well as he thought.
“But I know I can figure it out… They’re not giving me enough time. “ That part in the back of Draco’s mind reared its smug head, reminding him that he knew all along that everyone had been right.
“If you really must ask - "
Through the window you could make out the Death Eater sentries standing guard outside, they lined the beache and front garden - Bellatrix knew more were inside the house, and some were sent away to dispose of any muggle or blood-traitor bodies that belonged to this newly acquired location. The sea that lined the boarder of the property whipped and frothed, its water black and shapeless.
Snape had his arms crossed and he was tapping his fingers to his bicep, waiting for an actual answer. His black brow quirked.
song lyrics in the beginning credits:
Severus only watched him go, their eyes met and it was the first real antagonising moment between them since the new term.
“Too much too soon?” Harry said.
Draco was sitting there smugly, served him right for not leaving him alone.
- Well, usually abandoned.
“Right, why are you crying?”
The Professor tapped his wand on his table and he was awarded with hushed silence.
Harry blinked at the sudden shift in tone and mood. He bemusedly reached out and shook the hand the other boy was now offering. Looking as confused by the exchange as he felt, and wordlessly watched Zabini slide from the bench and back to the Slytherin dining table.
“What happened?” The old Alpha scent was like a calming elixir, coercing Draco’s tense muscles to unwind a couple of notches.
“Not in a million lifetimes.”
Draco let go and took a couple of steps back, fortunately for Sirius’ crassness he was able to get a hold of himself.
“I...I...” Draco attempted to speak, but shut his mouth after he fully understood the consequences. He couldn’t afford to speak in case he said something that would make him lose control, he couldn’t afford to lose control, because it would mean he would lose everything.
“…Offer?” Draco sat up at that, not hiding his pained wince as he did.
Draco didn’t need to look at Potter to know he froze where he stood, possibly with a goofy look of abject betrayal etched all over his face.
Snape wasn’t persuaded. “Stop asking so many questions boy, come.”
“ - There has been a change of plans. Headmaster has called a meeting.” Snape interrupted.
Draco squirmed a little, Severus hadn’t let up once and the heat of their chests nearly touching must be getting to the boy. “I dunno’…? Weird? How would you explain breathing to someone who’s only heard it for the first time?”
Ask her what?” His eyes narrowed.
“You owe me an explanation.” She said, her golden eyes burnt like embers, even when her face was cast in shadow.
“Evenin’ Hogwarts, we’re the Hex Girls. Lovely t’make your acquaintances,” whispered a dark haired Witch in red, heard only by the amplification of an oddly bulbous silver wand.
(See the end of the chapter for
Her joints ached from a combination of exhaustion and stress over the worrisome rumours of betrayal amongst their ranks surrounding the Malfoy's. But she wouldn’t get the chance to sleep just yet, even after the confirming nod that their security wards were in place from a Death Eater named Rosier, her Master Voldemort wasn’t ready to call it a night. She saw Rodolphus enter the hallway she was in, and he made a gesture for her to follow him down the corridor into the luxuriously decorated, candle lit master study.
There was a sound of shuffling, of things being moved and knocked over, he heard the sound of what ever Draco drank going down his throat, and the constant stream of moans, curses, and weary, incoherent ramblings. His dog-sensitive ears picked up every single detail, and it predictably sent wave after wave of arousal straight to his cock and balls. He was a simple man, and sounds of an eager, inexperienced Omega could’ve wiped out anyone.
He couldn’t even move, his body frozen and fixated by the insanity of it all.
“Yea, will give these back to you then.”
“They’re everywhere, but you need to know how to look.” Luna said desperately, it was like she could tell she was being made fun of but couldn’t help herself by endeavouring to enlighten others. She cast her bright blue eyes to Draco, searching for sanctuary. Draco averted his gaze.
“Surely you’re going to get it over and done with now—“
“D’you wanna dance, mate?” It was Harry, he had pulled back to bow with a hand behind his back, face twisted and pointed up to expose his green eyes and wide grin. A shadow snake, just one of the many scuttling shadow creatures swarming every surface like a reversed light-show, slithered over Harry’s lightning scar before vanishing away into his hairline.
The night was cold, and, even after changing into his warmer set of night clothes at some point, nothing made a difference to Draco. His body shivered uncontrollably, and the visible skin across his body was lit up by the shine of sweat, only making him colder, it came following the never-ending waves of pain, starting at his inflamed neck. He couldn’t ignore it and time only seemed to make it worse. The symptoms came to him faster than they did the last time, the first time, and a sudden fearful thought crossed Draco’s weary mind: what if the build-up to each heat became briefer and briefer, until he eventually dropped to the floor, incapable of action, until his grotesque biological deed was done? His first heat had taken nearly a week to happen, now he felt like he was on the brink of it, and it hadn’t even been one day yet.
Draco couldn’t imagine the next chance he would be getting from his Headmaster now.
The motorbike growled with a ferocity unlike anything Draco had ever felt before, it vibrated through the fabric of his jeans and shook his thighs so quickly the lines of the stitching blurred. The magically powered vehicle was a glossy black, paired with matching black leather handles and seats, it moved faster than any broom ever could. Draco desperately clung to Sirius who was zipping down crowded muggle roads, which were wide, black, and made of concrete - the speed in which they moved made it difficult to tell what the painted symbols along them meant. In fact, Draco couldn’t make out any physical characteristics of anything that passed them by, everywhere around him was nothing more than streaks of colour.
This was it, he had to finally give in. He couldn’t save his family alone, not without help to control his magic, not without an ally. Like recklessly letting go of a broom while upside down in the air, welcoming danger, the Omega took a deep breath of the Alpha. The proximity made the scent so thick it was like plunging his face into a barrel of fire whiskey, his face burnt from the potency of it, yet Harry still carried the most calming scent of all, and one thing it told Draco was that their partial-bond was still in place, albeit weaker than ever. Despite sleeping together only once, despite the resistance and walls he put up around himself, there was still a small, faint connection, and it was serving its purpose of offering some resemblance of comfort.
also also also i've been going to therapy and so as you can see i've been stealing the language my therapist uses while i write this 🤣
Being the organisers, the student council didn’t have the luxury to arrive fashionably late to the Halloween ball, instead they were expected to be hours early in costume, overseeing final plans and assuring things turned out as arranged.
He forced his sex to open another centimetre.
The stool was the perfect tool to keep Sirius as uncomfortable as possible, to keep himself from dozing off. He also kept himself busy with pointless activities to make the time go by, like counting the balusters of the stairs both leading up and down the first floor,
, right?” He grimly smiled at her at the phrasing.
“Do you mean like… Magic? When you can’t control your magic?” She whispered.
Those left in his group - Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson, Adrian Pucey, Pike Gorgon, Graham Montague, and Marcus Flint - were surrounding Draco as they travelled out of the castle, they were all dressed in pale-coloured, lightweight summer robes. Despite being a half-bonded, pheromone dripping Omega, none of the Alphas in his house dared lay a hand on him. Save for the occasional teasing. There couldn’t be one thing alone attributed to it, as Slytherins were renowned for many things - their unbreakable centuries-long unity, their deep respect of power, and their complex understanding of traditionalism - just to name a few.
Maybe it was the alcohol muddying his brain, or maybe because it was just Pansy… But Draco couldn’t help but stare off into the warm fire and ponder the question seriously.
Harry swayed slightly on his feet.
She looked down again at that, and took a bite out of what looked like a cucumber-only sandwich. “Not really. People are complicated.”
EDIT: no seriously thank u so so much for sticking around and reading this long omg... this story is 86k long now... that's a lot of words to go through :'O we'll pop champagne at the 100k mark!
“No,” his Headmaster said, it didn’t sound like he was even taking him seriously. “I don’t think you can. The situation at the lake had reminded me that if I don’t take action now, it will not only be a costly mistake, but a deadly one. An Alpha is needed to behave as an insulator to your magic, Harry has agreed to performing the mateship with you properly. I need you to agree to this too, Draco, or I will have to ask you to leave Hogwarts.”
A couple of students screamed in horror when Potter lifted his head off the ground - his nose was a little swollen and blood had gushed down over his lips and chin. He looked like an absolute mess with his stunned face and crooked glasses.
“Kiss me. You know I didn’t want it.” He let the venom take over, let the question warp his face into an ugly scowl. “Why did you do it?”
