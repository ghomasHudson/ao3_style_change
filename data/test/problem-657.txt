Draco is funny and witty with an excellent Quidditch arse and even better reflexes. He outflies Harry one out of two and hugs his mum first thing after wins. He's also the sorest loser in the league, with a red-card temper and a mean left hook. Yeah. The whole package, really.
“I didn’t,” Malfoy says under Veritaserum, his eyes half-lidded, a smug smile spreading across his face thick as clotted cream.
Some days, he wakes wheezing, stumbling out of bed. Running, running—worried the old fear’s finally caught up. Scared that he’s returned to his old ways. Sometimes, Harry says, “go back to bed”, like it’s a problem. But mostly, he doesn’t say anything. Mostly, he goes back to bed.
“Yes. Let us burn it.” Both of them rose to their feet and pushed their chairs to the table. Sirius stayed seated. “Do not burn yourselves”, he warned, while Harry and Draco were leaving the dining room. The fire, which consumed every last bit of a part of Draco’s past lightened up the evening sky with a warm red and melted into the departing sun. So, the two young men stood there, in unity, and watched it burn.
I stood in front of the mirror and smiled at the image, which was looking back at me. The simple black jeans with the white blouse and the silver – striped green tie gave me a clean and fresh complexion. My first day at work could begin. While I was putting on my dark black suit and coat I was thinking about how people would react, when they would see me in the ministry for the very first time. How would they react to a death eater in their midst? Former death eater, I corrected myself swiftly.
“That’s quite an important clue, we got from Hermione”, Draco remarked just after I had thought of it. I chuckled. He didn’t even need Legilemens to know, what was boggling my mind. “It would be good though if we didn’t have to go in there on our own”, he continued. His voice was shaky. I totally could understand that, because to be honest, I wouldn’t want to be seen as a traitor by the death eaters either. When it came to punishment, then they for sure weren’t affectionate.
“Harry is my boyfriend and I decided to support the right side”, Draco countered his father, “at least I chose to not be a stuck-up, arrogant, close-minded, and foolish wannabe auror”, he continued. Silence fell over the whole hill. And then everything exploded:
“Find a common ground,” she said. “You two will be seeing a lot this week and from now on. It would be better, I think, if you two started over again.”
“That’s what you get for working in the ministry, Malfoy.” Of course. I should have known the whole fucking time. Weasley. “How dare you attack another witch like that! You’re a coward!”, I shouted, while gripping the handle of my broom tightly, so that my knuckles turned white. My whole body tensed up again. Meanwhile, I had managed to sit on top of my broom again. But I could feel, that I was tired. Too tired to fight him again. Catching a deep breath, I replied shakily: “I know that you have a problem with me, Weasley. But I can’t change that. So, leave us alone. And don’t you dare bring Harry or Hermione into this. They’re my friends – my family.” With that, I turned around to Harry and he nodded. No more words were spoken, as we were leaving Ron and finally making our way to Sirius’ residence.
Draco was walking ahead, while Hermione, Aileen, and I were trailing behind. I could see, that his step was slow but determined. He unwaveringly knew, what he was doing. We trusted him. As we were reaching the hill, we stopped in our tracks abruptly. The trio of death eaters was standing on the other side, but they hadn’t noticed us yet. Everyone was ready. We could hear them talking, but their dialog was unintelligible. We lined up next to each other, now standing – shoulder by shoulder. Aileen and Hermione were in the middle, while Draco and I were standing on the outer sides. We had got each other’s backs.
During the descent of our brooms, I flew closer to Harry. I needed his company right now. As we finally landed in front of the ministry, I could recognize a young woman, who was standing on the front steps of the stately white building. The many windows granted you a bit of an insight into the work other Aurors were doing at the moment. The young woman was meanwhile walking towards us and stopped as she recognized who we were. Her hands had been in her pockets. But by addressing us, she took them out and clapped out of excitement. “Harry and Draco! It’s so good to see you both again!” Granger would never stop being her happy but sometimes a bit knows – it all self. It was good to have her as a friend though. I started to like her more every day. “Good morning, Hermione! How have you and Ron been?” She was still with Weasley? I’m not sure if that was a good idea, I thought while listening to the starting conversation. “I’m fine so far, thank you, Harry. There’s nothing between Ron and me anymore. We broke up”, Hermione replied calmly. She didn’t seem to be phased by this at all. “Good Morning, Hermione”, I finally also greeted her nicely. Her smile grew even bigger. “You both must be cold. We should go inside.” With those words, she turned towards the entrance. However, I was not entirely sure, if I wanted to go inside. But I had to get to work at some point. So, I might as well just get over with it. “Are you coming too, Draco?”, Hermione inquired from the door. She was holding it open for me, expecting me to follow her.
“Hermione, Aileen!”, I screamed. They turned towards me and came running. Both of them looked quite worried. “Is everything alright?”, Aileen asked, as she was bending down to Draco. “Just leave me, - please”, Draco muttered with a strained and tearful voice. He rose to his feet and walked away from us. “Draco, wait", I meant quietly. Why was he walking away now? Was he doing alright? “Harry, leave him, it’s alright”, Remus meant calmly. “Are you two ladies alright?”, he asked Hermione and Aileen. They nodded. “We beat them pretty well.” Aileen seemed to be proud of all of us. “Sounds like we should all get home and get something to drink”, I announced. “And what do we do with all the death eaters, which are still here?”, Hermione asked. “Just leave them here. Voldemort will collect them. We should focus on Bellatrix and Lucius”, I answered. “Absolutely we will do that”, Draco agreed, who had returned unnoticed. I rubbed his back and looked at him. He nodded. “Let’s go home then”, Remus proposed, while extending his arm. We all grabbed either a part of his hand or arm and thus we all disappeared from this horrendously cold place.
“Good morning to you both." Another person walked up to the table and looked at the two friends who had already sat down. Maybe a bit too aggressively the young man put down his teacup and concentrated on the person, who had just entered the room. “Potter….” “You should stop calling me that, darling.” Draco’s corners of his mouth wandered upwards and revealed a huge smile which made Harry’s day every time he saw it on the face of his boyfriend. “You’re up early. What kept you awake that long last night?”, Harry inquired, while taking a seat at the table.
“How was your first day of work today, Draco?” Sirius welcomed us into the house. “I was reminded of why I hate to be anywhere in a close range of Weasley. He gets my blood boiling. A complete abomination for the whole wizarding world.” Wait. What was I saying? Shit. I didn’t mean it that way. My hands were shivering, as I took off my coat and looked at Harry – anxious to know, what he would think of what had just come out of my mouth. Why did I do this? Why did I have to be like this? Maybe Weasley was right and I was like my…. But that couldn’t be. I wasn’t a death eater. Not anymore. I stopped doing that immediately after the Battle. I wasn’t the same person anymore.
Thus, the three of us walked together to the elevators, which lay in the back of the ground floor of the ministry. Harry and I had to get to the first floor, while Hermione stayed here. She was working as an activist for muggles, witches, and elves, which was extensively impressive. It reminded me of our mutual school time, where she would always go on about the rights of muggles, witches, and elves. It was as if she had made her hobby to be her career.
“Pansy did. I couldn’t keep that relationship up, you know? It was just too much with everything going on around us” Draco replied with a long sigh of relief as he remembered the breakup. The letter, which Pansy had written to him. “That letter. She could not say it to my face.” Draco’s lips quivered as he continued: “She couldn’t say it to my face….” “It’s useless to cry over spilled milk, boy”, Sirius added calmly. He did not quite understand, what Draco meant and why that was so important to him. But he could feel his heartache and felt sorry for him.
“Stupefy!” Suddenly, I felt a huge push and before I realized, what just had happened, I was hanging on my broom – holding myself with the other hand. Brilliant. Once again it all depends on me, whether someone dies or not. With that thought, I tried to pull myself up. But my whole weight was pulling me down. I couldn’t hold on for much longer. Come on. You’re a Slytherin. Any cunning ideas on how to not die? I really hated my brain sometimes. With the last of my remaining energy I tried again to pull myself up and this time, I managed to pull myself towards my broom. I wrapped my legs tightly around the broom, while not letting go of Harry’s hand. Why didn’t they attack him too? Who did this in the first place? How about pushing the broom upwards, so that Harry could reach his with his free right hand? That was not even that dumb of an idea, was it? So, I directed my broom upwards. No! Why did he let go? Harry?! My whole body stiffened and I turned around terrified, just to see my boyfriend sitting on his broom – smiling. It was not like, he nearly just died of a cowardly attack. Who was the attacker anyway?
After I had hung my coat on the black coat stand, I took a seat at the desk and started up my laptop. “I made you some tea, love.” Harry must have made the tea in the little kitchen niche, which was laying behind his desk. Fortunately, we had one of those fancy tea cookers – with the Slytherin crest on it – of course. He put the black teacup next to the laptop and I started to smile, as I perceived the smell of Earl Grey tea. “You’re the best, Harry. Thank you so much.” “You looked quite fierce down in the lobby. When you were talking to Ron.” I raised my eyebrows and answered exhaustedly: “Weasley just couldn’t stop himself. He needs to keep his nose out of other people’s business.” Harry nodded and sat down behind his desks. As I started my laptop, the snake on the Slytherin crest twirled and then froze. The crest blinked in shimmery gold and then my desktop appeared. We continued working until the lunch break came around.
“I made some dinner if you both would like anything to eat.” Sirius was already walking towards the kitchen. “Wait. Hold up. Did you cook it? Oh boy, that’s going to be interesting”, Harry teased. “it’s mashed potatoes, beans, and some steak. You can’t really mess that up now, can you?” He cooked my favorite food. What a treasure he was. A smile crept up on my face, while I was following them. The kitchen was rather small but cozy. It consisted of a large wooden table, with two huge and long benches standing on each side of it. No one was sitting at the table, but it was set for three. The smell was astonishing. Sirius happened to be a good cook after all. As I approached the stove, I could smell the buttery mashed potatoes, the beans, which were bubbling in the pot, and the steak, which was seasoned with Sirius’ favorite seasoning mix. I bent down over the different pots and pans and closed my eyes. It smelled so good.
I still didn’t know, who the person in front of us was. No one spoke a word. You could cut the tension with your wand. The person in front of us stepped forward. It looked as if they were joining the death eaters. The gargling of the muddy ground beneath them broke the silence. I could feel the hairs on my arms stand up. Suddenly, the person stopped. From an outsider’s perspective, we looked like two opposing teams of conductors – our batons at the ready. The mark still glowing above us. It was really the only light that lit up the whole hill and gave us some sense of direction. What were we waiting for?
“So this is what it has come to!”, the person announced loudly to the death eaters. Of course, it was Snape. I knew it. The whole bloody time I knew it. I was so focused on the whole atmosphere, that I didn’t focus on his wand. I should have known. My gaze drifted to the right and looked for Draco’s. As our eyes met, he nodded, while his face showed no other expression. There was neither regret nor relief. As we focused ourselves again on the battlefield, Snape was still standing in the middle. But one of the death eaters was facing him.
“I have to shortly finish this report about one of the death eaters the others caught last week. He belongs to a bigger ring. We want to burst it. But we would need more resources for this, which the ministry kindly will not grant us. It’s kind of frustrating actually.” I really wished, we would have more help from the authorities on this, but even after talking to them multiple times, they still would not give us, what we needed to catch these bloody death eaters. I finished the report just in time. My teacup was empty. I must have refilled the cup at least once or twice, while I had been working on this death eater ring. It was a big thing. But luckily I got support from other Aurors, who happened to work on the same floor as Harry and me I.
Meanwhile, Lucius was finished with healing Bellatrix. Both of them got to their feet and turned themselves to us. I could feel the coldness cutting through the air as it eluded them. That nothing froze as they were approaching us, was a mystery in itself. So, they stood before us and looked down upon us. They really did look down upon us. “Well done, Draco”, Lucius was full of sarcasm. I can remember, that he told this to Draco when they left Hogwarts after the battle.
“Can you stop doing that, please?” Draco was standing behind me and practiced with his wand. “Always be prepared. Always.”, he imitated Moody and Snape at the same time. I rolled my eyes and continued observing the landscape around us.
“I mean he’s a pureblood like you. So that shouldn’t be the problem, should it?” Another question from Sirius. I was still gnawing on the first one. “I didn’t mean it that way. I’m sorry, Harry.”, I finally answered, while nearly bursting into tears. This day had been too much. Now everything came bubbling out. All the memories. All the screaming. All the fighting. “It’s okay, honey. I know, that you have had a rough day. Ron really should move on. It’s not like we all make mistakes in our lives”, he replied, while putting his shoes on the shoe rack next to mine. There it was again. The confirmation. The reassurance, which I had never got beforehand. It was given to me so freely. I didn’t have to doubt the validity of the statement. I just knew that he was telling the truth. Because he had never given me a reason to distrust him.
Harry and Draco keep working on the Death eater ring. However, their work leads them to a rather unpleasant reunion. Alongside Harry and Draco, who support each other through this chaos and turmoil, Hermione and Aileen fight and keep them company.
“Crucio!”, Bellatrix screamed hysterically, while I blocked her gruesome attempt to torture me with a flick of my wand. “You got getter over time, Potter”, she remarked as she prepared for her next advance. “Yeah, indeed. Watch this: Sectumsempra!”, I hollered while pushing my wand towards Bellatrix. She actually should have been prepared for this counter but was surprised she stumbled backward and fell. The mud splashed, as Bellatrix dropped to the ground. As I was standing above her, I watched her facial features stiffen. Her whole face was tense. She would not give up this easily. It really worked. She is bleeding. “Potter….”, Bellatrix moaned, as I watched how the blood ran over her belly and dropped into the mud. She would not survive this. “No! How could you dare to do this!” Lucius came running from where he had been fighting Draco. His cloak seemed to hug him, as he kneeled next to Bellatrix and started to close up her gushing wounds.
Harry and I walked into the elevator after we had said goodbye to Hermione. We would see her today at lunch again. Since Harry and I shared an office we reached it after a short walk. As I stepped inside I felt instantly at home. The black laptops on the light wooden desks reminded me, that this was the one place where I felt like I was in my element. This was my place to shine. Weasley could suffocate waiting for me to fail at my job.
Otherwise, grab a blanket, some cookies, or also just something to drink and get ready for a good fight scene.
“What am I thinking? You were the one, who started all of this. Draco didn’t do anything, besides his job. You’re constantly distracting and taunting him. He doesn’t need any of that.” While she was talking, the waitress had brought our lunch. I looked over at her and nodded thankfully at her. She smiled and left again. Was it only me or were Hermione and Weasley constantly fighting over something? “Look, Weasley. If you have a problem with me, then you will just have to live with the fact, that I’m working here now. Also, I’m going to enjoy my lunch – preferably without being interrupted by you.” With those words, I moved away from Weasley and walked to the table. He could really get on my nerves. Without any further commentary, Ron left. The whole tension disappeared out of my body and I sat down to eat my lunch.
"I'd rather stick my dick in Voldemort than you," Harry snarled back. He fell back naked onto crumpled sheets, pulling Draco down with him.
Draco grabbed a fistful of Harry's hair and pulled back. Harry keened, sending a rush of blood straight to Draco's cock. "I'm going to come," Harry choked out, struggling to swallow with his throat exposed.
"You're going to make me do all the work," Harry tries to laugh, but it comes out all croaky and hoarse, his heart rabbiting in his throat. He crawls into Draco's lap and wraps a hand around both of their cocks.
. There was the red one for intruders, and the yellow one for “you seem a bit agitated sir, maybe cool off before handling dangerous equipment?” and the blue one for “DANGER unclassified uncontrolled dark artefact DANGER dark artefact DANGER DARK ARTEFACT!!!!!” The blue alarm was particularly concerning, as it sealed all entrances to the lab to prevent contamination at risk of the researcher’s own life, though a quick survey of the room showed no sign of disturbance. In fact, the only signal the sensors picked up came from Potter himself, right above the left breast pocket of his coat.
Draco Apparates back to his flat that isn't theirs anymore and beats dust off the bed where they used to fuck like they were going to die (because they were). There's a band of white around his finger where the ring had burned. Whatever the antidote did, it didn't work.
"Going through a lover's things in a hunger to know his entire world in your heart." Draco's face flushed. "It's hopelessly intimate."
“This was going to happen sooner or later,” Pansy said when she caught him scuttling down the hall toward the bathroom. When he made no word of response except to clack his claws together, she picked him up and asked, “What are you going to tell Potter?”
On one of the days (though he couldn't say which), Harry itches to get back on the BroomBod. He manages to disconnect it from the network, but then all he has is an ordinary broom—and one that is only fractionally as good as his old Firebolt. The whole thing is so utterly stupid that he nearly smashes the thing to splinters. But he rides it anyway because it's the only broom he has, conjuring a roomful of atmosphere and wishing himself outside instead.
You come to me because you’re weary being good all those hours in the day. In the cool reprieve of darkness, I swallow the blackness in your blood until your eyes bleed blank and the metallic tang of copper fills the night.
Draco swallowed a disbelieving breath. "A celebration? What are we celebrating?" But Pansy had already left to answer the bell.
"It's fascinating how masterfully the world parallels problems we have with our own systems of power. And the mind-reading was
"I knew I recognised you coming out of this house yesterday." Pansy wedged a foot in and squeezed through the door frame. "How long have you been holed up here? Merlin, you've got a lot of shelves." She found her way to the kitchen and put on the kettle, waving a manicured hand under the floral antique to ignite the flame. "Your mum's old thing?"
Ginny chokes. "I was kidding," she says, but she gamely follows him into the living room with her wand out. They take turns Vanishing the ugly square ottoman, the weird geometric art, the tacky antler chandelier. The industrial coat rack, the tentacle-like floor lamps, the marble coffee table. The shelves of dusty medallions, signed Snitches ("maybe I'll keep Gwenog's," Ginny says, squirrelling it away), the ashtrays, even. There isn't a single thing that Harry likes about the place where he lives, so it all disappears to nothing, one after another.
"Shut up," Harry laughs and shoves up onto his elbows. He pulls her hand over his heart. "You feel that? Not a fucking pump. You've murdered me with your lies."
"Uh-huh." Draco lowers his wand and gives the blank wall a curious look. "Closets...is it only closets, or also attics, or cupboards?"
A cruise ship came in today as it always does in July when the wind blows buoyant, and everyone wants a little piece of heaven for themselves. Summers with Nana are blessed, breezy days of linen-hanging and lemon cake after, and no one gets upset when Draco smears icing all over his five-year-old mouth. “It’s good to do things yourself,” Nana says knee-deep in the river behind her cottage. Draco wrings what he can from his corner of tablecloth and takes pleasure in the slick velvet of rock underfoot.
Lunch is after a change of clothes and a rousing round of complaints (“A bow-tie? Really, Dad? Really?”). Narcissa outdoes herself with a summer banquet enjoyed in the greenhouse on picnic blankets over freshly grown grass. Harry takes a bite of biscuit and surveys the snowman on the other side of the glass, wondering if he’s watching them too, like looking into a snow globe made of summer. A sun globe? He ponders on this until Scorpius snugs up against his side, half-asleep, and they take it as their cue to head home.
They both know that Harry was coked out when he hired the wrong decorator, who furnished the place like a museum of poor taste. Whatever. The point is that it looks nothing like it did before. The crown moulding was stripped away and every last house-elf head unmounted. Marble veined with gold replaced dark wood, and floorboards were swept of memories until only cleanly lit corners remained where nightmares used to lurk. Harry doesn't use the rooms enough for comfort to matter. It's only Ginny's third time over in four years—and her last if she rags on him any longer.
Ginny catches Harry staring again and gives him a knowing look. "It's not your fault," she says, patting his hand. "Quidditch arse. Bloody irresistible. Trust me, I know."
The mouth opens and closes in a fluctuating flow of words that compresses through Harry’s vaguely empty mind as though playing through static.
"Yeah," Draco says, blinking. "It's exactly that. Merlin, you're incredible. The voters we've had trouble connecting with—"
Pansy drapes her legs over the booth seats, digging the heels of her stilettos into Ginny's lap. "Ginny and I are going to a concert on Friday. Wanna come?"
"I—" A sob wracked through Harry's chest. "I love you. You. No one else. I'm trying to keep it together because you bloody hate it when I cry. Use your
"Yes," Draco said. He held down the index card with two fingers and wrote down the original publication date: 1996.
Harry looks and finds no room for argument, so he lets Draco pretend that nothing's changed between them as Harry pushes past one stuck door after the next, parading them through the endless hall of empty upstairs bedrooms. Then it's back down the stairs and through the drawing room before they finally stop outside the gym, the only room that Harry's left untouched.
He could go back to Nylon and seduce the bartender. They'd go back to Eltanin's place, where Harry'll confront Draco and get him back, he'd do anything—
"We're not going to the trials anymore," I announced out loud the next morning. "We're going to jerk off instead." A rooster crowed. Or maybe I imagined it; it was bloody dark still. I waited for his chuckle of assent before slipping a hand down our pants.
They say the Imperius Curse is Unforgiveable. I disagree, but you know me. I’ve never done things their way. Their way only got my friends killed, and I’m not going to let that happen anymore. Right, Draco?
," one of them says. Harry can't help but snort. "Didn't know you rode but could've guessed from your thighs," a former hookup texts, appending a smirk emoji in invitation. Harry scrolls down far enough on his notifications that he falls asleep.
"Mr Potter," a feminine voice says from the other end. "This is Stella from BroomBod. We spoke last week about our Star Athletes program?"
Silver. Right, Harry should have expected Eltanin to be difficult. Harry waves his wand and wills the ink silver.
Draco says to meet at the pier, but there’s another hour till sunset, so Harry takes his time walking. Sharp, clean pavement and brow-beaten lawns. The neighbour’s crup, Dean Thomas with his hellos. A swelling pink in the distance, behind the Tesco.
The Pensieve waits, though my feet refuse to move. I wallow around the space of my missing memory. I feel around the edges until my hands bleed raw. But the extraction is clean. Complete.
," Draco says. "Of course, I never win. Ginny never cares about what we watch as long as she can turn it into a drinking game."
Harry's voice is still hoarse from last night, and the smoking makes it worse. "You act tough, but you're not really," he says.
that," Draco growled. "I. Didn't—" he dipped a finger in the lube and pressed in. Harry hissed, his cock jerking against his belly. "Neville—" Draco said.
What is it about Draco that has Harry taking stock of all the nicks in his cabin? He wants to apologise for the faint smell of must, the stale tea. It was like this, even before Harry ran away.
Harry sat down next to Draco and pressed his shoulder against a misty arm. There was that time when they'd been nineteen, and all they required was a soft bed and a pack of condoms. And then there was a week ago, when what Harry required most was to hear Draco's voice again. Alive. But Harry should have known that magic twisted simple desires, monstrous. He was a fool to cheat Death.
“Good afternoon,” Draco says an hour, two, three later, yawning. Harry murmurs incoherence into Draco’s hair, tickling down his neck. They try again in another minute or twenty, staggering out of bed on sleep-legs still swaying to the drowsy rhythms of REM. Harry tilts his head up for a kiss halfway down the hall, and they fall against a slatted square of sun, breathing affection like oxygen.
I led him to the pub. I wanted people to recognize us, so he felt safe. We had three drinks and talked up a whole lot of nonsense about the "good old days" when Voldemort had a firm grip on the world. I went home after and waited a full week before I murdered him.
"You don't waste a second," Malfoy smirks. His fingers cling to the edge of Harry's jeans, slipping to rub against Harry's hip.
"No. I'm sorry, I just need time." Draco looks away. "I shouldn't have come." He stands up. "You won't hate me if I leave, will you?"
“Got to cover the scar somehow,” Harry says. His eyes linger on the scuffed brass doorknob. But he shouldn’t, he knows.
Potter strides forward, the fringes of his chaps swinging and slapping against his thick thighs. He tips his hat at Pansy before turning to Draco and running a sheepish hand against his stubbled cheek. “Err. You texted me? Three cowboy emojis, and then these Apparition coordinates?”
Draco smirked. “You’re drab.” He leaned in, his finger jabbing Harry in the chest.  "Dreary.“ Another jab, another inch closer. "Utterly. Unspectacular."
“And you don’t care that they’re listening to you piss. Watching you chortle at those kneazle vids that Weasley won’t stop sending, despite my repeated requests for him to —”
Potter took him home that day, handing him off to Pansy before Flooing the rest of the way to his own home.
“I’m not sure I should,” Harry said with some reluctance because the drink was very pink, and decorated with a paper umbrella and a juicy bite of pineapple—his favourite. He wouldn’t admit to that most pub nights, but today was his birthday, and he was very, very wasted. He didn’t remember the last time he’d been this sloshed since, well, nearly two months prior, when he and Ron had shown up two weeks too early to Dean’s birthday. Malfoy had been there instead, celebrating his twenty-sixth wearing jeans so tight that Harry swore there was some sticking charm on them that made them impossible to look away from, because why else would Harry’s eyes be glued to them (Ron assured him there wasn’t). Which reminded him—
“No, and thank god for that,” Draco drawled, wincing at his headache. “How did we get home? The last thing I remember is us leaving the party.”
“Uh, I’ll eat it,” Neville said softly. Another change that Harry never realized was that the other sixth-years ate with them again. Neville was sitting between Parvati and Seamus, directly in front of Harry. The Omega looked up at Neville than blushed, “You sure?” he asked.
“Wasn’t your fault mate,” Ron shrugged. “Oh! Hermione!” He jumped up and swelled his chest, “I didn’t write to you about this because I wanted to tell you in public, with Harry as my witness. I’m an—” Ron stopped. His nose twitched and he stared at Hermione. Hermione stared at him. Ron’s face drained and Harry felt like he could see his friend’s soul leave his body. “No,” he whispered. “No—Hermione you! You!”
Draco felt a pain shot through his heart, already here and he was asked to talk about the place he wanted to escape from. Still, it was a common question, right, so he might as well answer it just enough to satisfy his roommate. “California,” he said.
Her eyes widened as they fell on the broomstick in Harry’s right hand. It was his pride and joy, a gift from Sirius, an international standard broomstick. “And I’m still riding a Comet Two Sixty,” Tonks said enviously. “Ah well … let’s go!
“But before that—I’ve been sleeping for a long time, and from what I know, this demon brat’s father likes to pervert everything we’ve done so, does the wedding involves an orgy?” Loki asked.
The sun was giving way to the night sky when Harry’s tears started to slow down, and he heard something hissing around him.
Ron gave him a sharp look, which caused Theo to sigh again, “Believe it or not Weasley, I’m one of the good ones. That stuff they did back then? I wasn’t a part of it… in fact would you believe I had no knowledge of it?”
“False, yes,” the demon nodded. “However, I think I’ll talk more about that later, my sweeties. Come boys, let’s get to class.” Draco and Harry nodded and led Blaise to Basics of Elements, taught by Ms. Samael.
“Your uncles are currently with a special kind of Succubus who’ll make sure they are left impotent if we don’t stop them,” Blaise said. “Now MOVE!”
Uncle Sirius had a thoughtful expression before nodding, “Yeah,” he said, with a slight grin, “had the demon help us cheat for a few exams.”
When the Aurors came for Professor Umbridge, she walked out with them silently, holding her face up in a snobbish matter that reminded Harry of a frog who was able to stick her tongue out at a fly. She did not say a word, however, the school celebrated her dismissal, the students cheering and jumping everywhere and the professors doing nothing to stop them. Professor Dumbledore himself has taken to substitute for the course until they could find a proper teacher for the course after the court date. At first, Harry and Niall were apprehensive of the old man teaching them, however, Dumbledore did not attempt to do anything drastic and kept to the basics of what they should know at their year level.
“I will, you sleep too okay?” Draco asked. Harry nodded and kissed Draco’s cheek. He followed Draco to the door and whispered, “I’ll look over your notes. I’m sure we can find everything we need soon.”
inside him, never to be looked at again. Ron Weasley had a fail-safe method of emotional survival; Just don’t do it. If you looked too closely at your emotions you might start to
Myrtle huffed, letting out a cry. Then she back flipped into one of the stalls, presumably to sulk. They could hear her clearly put-upon sobs loud and clear.
“Stop it, you two” Hermione scolded, and Ginny watched Ron make a silly face behind her back which set of Draco grinning. Hermione whipped around and glared at him and he blushed at being caught “Today” She said pointedly “I thought we’d go over Petrificus Totalus. Then we can go over any homework troubles anyone has”
“Diggory and Chang? Or Krum and his strapping young fellow?” Draco said with disbelief. They all chuckled. The Durmstrang boy could be seen visible shaking off all help given to him, assuring is macho-ness.
“And doesn’t it bother you?” Ginny exclaimed, annoyed at her brothers’ blasé attitude “Him and Hermione have this…secret. Doesn’t it make you jealous”
Harry stared a moment longer at the spider slowly spinning its web, and Hermione watched too. Then he looked at her with a weak smile, “But it should be okay now. It should all work out. Now.”
“Hermione, look!” Harry shouted suddenly, pointing out of the window. Hermione whipped her head around, craning to see. There, through the impeccably clear window, was-
Ron was finishing off the last piece of shortbread (his fifth in the last hour) (“Hermione! Who knew muggles could cook so well
Ginny Weasley was poor. Ginny Weasley was last. Ginny Weasley was a girl. Any number of reasons, but they all boiled down to this; Ginny Weasley was not enough.
“I,” The goblin began, looking baffled. Then his expression cleared out into its usual professional distaste, “Not to worry. Sometimes there’s something that needs to be cleared up ahead and all the carts are stopped. We can keep going now, I’m sure.”
Just like—” But Neville didn’t hear who it was just like, because Harry as storming away from him again, striding down the long corridor.
Harry squeezed her hand, telling her everything was okay. He waited for her words to come with the understanding patience of someone who knew the pain of loosing one’s mother. The person who brought you into the world lost to your world forever.
Harry visibly gulped “Actually,” He said, voice choked before he cleared it and went to go on. Hermione and Ron exchanged bewildered looks. “I wondered if I could ask you a question.”
Tonks’ ability to completely throw the lesson plan and syllabus out of the window on a whim was perfectly represented in what happened when Fleur Delacour knocked on the door a few minutes into their lesson one day in November.
Hermione, who hadn’t noticed him arrive or sit down, looked up at him in surprise. Her hair was frazzled around her ace and Ron guessed she had been tugging at it, the way she did when she was in deep concentration. She looked around wildly at Krum, blinked owlishly at him a few times and then let out a small huff. The sight of her, frizzy hair and all, send odd shivers through his body.
Neville kissed him. He grabbed Harry’s soot stained collar and pulled him upwards, so that he matched the few inches Neville had on him. Then he crushed his mouth to the crazy hero’s, mouth desperate. Harry kissed back, hands wrapping around Neville’s neck.
I wish I could twist the pages. Have him hear me as I call out every desperate command. No, not that way. That way is where the monster thrives. I run my hands across pages that do not feel my touch. I cannot find a door. I cannot find my way out.
"Fine," Harry snaps. He doesn't know why he's putting up with Malfoy when he could've just fucked anyone else in his DMs with no trouble at all.
"I'm thinking of moving. Spend a few years in Australia, Budapest, whatever," Harry says to Hermione the next day over lunch. She's only available for twenty minutes, but her assistant calls in their orders early, so the server brings their food when they sit.
He’s changed, he said. It won’t be like it was. Come over, I’ll show you how. And he’s right. The years passed and we grew out of sync, our skin shed into new people. Things will never be the same. But I can’t help but pretend they are, close my eyes to the gleam of wicked in his eye. Instead, I think, how nice it is, for the devil to spend his afternoon by my side, laughing his borrowed laugh and smiling how Draco used to, when he wasn’t so dead. Trying so hard to be the man I used to love, I nearly love him back.
Six-thirty is too early to be alive, let alone running. Father said that exercise was an unattractive activity that Muggles pursued when they weren't clever enough to plan ahead — look at them, poor pitiful souls, too stupid to Apparate — and isn't that another thing Father got wrong? Because Draco loves the uneven pavement under his trainers, loves the harsh air in his lungs, loves how every step forward is another step back, the past unravelling at his heels.
"You aren't seriously—" Malfoy swallows. "I'm not. I don't want to mix work with whatever we've been doing—" He breathes out slowly, warm against Harry's neck. "You're drunk."
Draco closes his eyes and gives in to the softness of Harry’s mouth. He braces his hands on Harry’s pauldron, wishing it were the warm ridges of collarbone instead. All this useless armour when what Draco craves is the intimacy of chests pressed heart-to-heart.
They move to the living room, with its vast expanses of marble furniture camouflaged against marble walls, and tasteless Warhol portraits hung uncomfortably low. "Like a snobby hotel lobby" was Ron's critique of it the first time he saw it.
“What, I can’t push my hair back too?” I’m trying to sound annoyed, but it’s hard to be when he’s wearing my jumper with the lightning bolt pattern.
Blood. Loyalty. Vengeance. Slytherins act with permanence, as though every cut will scar. Was it Draco's choice when he shed his skin, or did Potter trick him?
It isn’t a big deal (a single sprig of mistletoe hung under the doorframe), but Draco avoids it year after year, edging around it like a taunt even as the faces change around him. This year he’s in the kitchen—flicking wary glances at it like he always does—when he catches on Harry through the other room. Their eyes meet; Harry’s mouth curling, warm as a promise.
Draco bites his lip. "I…I started seeing someone. We're not exclusive, but I'm hopeful..." he trails off.
Harry shoved the book back in its place. "You're doing a lot of work for books you don't even like when you could be out flying with me."
"But Muuuuummmm," Ginny whines, but she's grinning, probably from something her new not-girlfriend texted.
Draco grips his cup tighter, his face turned down to the pavement. "I'm not pretending," he says. "I'm trying to change."
Harry pockets the phone and mixes himself an old fashioned, the same one he always makes, but he can't get himself to drink it. So he goes into the living room where the weed's still left out from last time, and smokes up the room so thick with smog that the ugly shit around him disappears into a white haze, and for a moment, he thinks he's died again. Then he goes to bed.
They order pizza for dinner and sprawl over the bare floors to eat it, their chewing reverberating grotesquely off the empty walls. Ginny eats three slices, then says that she should show herself out. Harry can't think of a single reason she shouldn't, so she grabs a broom and disappears up to the attic, leaving him alone again with nothing else to do except sleep.
Hermione flips her hair back in a calculated display of indifference. She's getting good at that. "I need you around. People will think that we don't care about this country if you run off while I'm still campaigning."
"When you're at the Ministry working till three-am like you are every bloody night. Who the fuck do you think feeds him then? You think food magically—"
"Sometimes," Eltanin says. "Not so much recently. But for weeks before, loads. And even before then. I don't think he deliberately name-dropped you. It would just slip, and he'd look embarrassed."
Harry came home that evening and kissed me on the cheek, his arms heavy over my shoulders. I was still sitting at the desk. He smelled of ink. Or maybe I was smelling myself. Harry had a way of getting me to look beyond my eyes. Taste things again. I could hear the rain on him now, though his jumper remained dry, and soft. And warm.
"I, just. You know. Mums." Hermione blinks back tears, the handkerchief remaining resolutely in her hand, though she can't resist a snort when Parvati starts reading her vows.
"Alright, alright," Harry says. He's in a good mood, and it's got him feeling cavalier. "Draco bloody Malfoy, can you believe that?"
"You're pissed," Malfoy says. His throat is thick with emotion, but Harry can't pinpoint which. It doesn't matter because it's not like Harry cares about Malfoy. And everything's been so
Harry crosses his arms and scowls. "I just hate them, alright? Are you going to follow me to the toilet next and badger me about why I piss?"
“Shut up,” Draco says, his face hot. “You didn’t tell me how it worked. I hate this stupid daydream. Why am I even dressed like barmy old Baba Yaga? Morgan le Fay would’ve been more era-appropriate. Merlin, do wank over evil or —”
"She's a BroomBod exec. You know, the one you slammed the door on not an hour ago? How do you do it? Why does everything you do fuck with my life?"
. I'm going to vomit in your shoe to teach you a lesson." She stood up with an empty plate in her hand. "What are you even going to tell your kids is your grand epic nausea-inducing love story? Daddy One went crazy over a couple of books Daddy Two stole out of spite?" She dropped the plate into the sink, where it began washing itself, before she rounded on Draco. "It still makes absolutely no sense to me why you cared so much about a few stolen books."
Harry cradles the phone against his cheek. His heart has no business beating this fast. He says, “Why don’t you see for yourself?”
Ginny pops a pickle in her mouth. She wipes her fingers on the edge of the linen tablecloth and waits for Harry to continue.
Crackerjack purrs between their legs as they step back out of the Floo. “I’m going to put him to bed,” Harry says again about Scorpius in his arms after Draco yawns over him the first time. Draco blinks slowly, so sweet with his hair mussed that Harry can’t help but pull him in too, his whole family in his arms. “Thanks,” he murmurs against the shell of Draco’s ear, Scorpius’s lashes tickling his cheek. He doesn’t want to let go.
," Draco grumbled. He could find a book by feel. Except this one—but Pansy was wrong. Draco simply didn't
First thing I did when I got home was to throw away the apples from last month and make room for the Muggle ones. The basket had a preservation charm weaved in, but it only lasted a couple of weeks. I tossed in the first apple from a distance, in case it exploded. Nothing happened. Apples were apples, and there was no magic beyond their taste. But I wanted to check.
"Shut up," Draco said. He sat up and pulled Harry by the hair toward his half-hard cock. "Shut up, or I'll make you."
They stood there for a long, terrible moment of realisation with the alarms still sounding off before Potter asked, “What are the prolonged effects of dark artefacts on the human psyche?”
So I was free, my hours mine aside for an hour every Wednesday, when Potter came to check my wand. He was my probationary Auror, of course, and he'd bring me something Muggle with each visit, as though I could turn the bad parts of me good by coating my insides with Diet Coke. Of course, it didn't work.
Harry peers around the bar. It's sleek: turquoise mosaic walls and solid walnut tables, modern chandeliers—the ones that look like used up toilet paper rolls painted black—hanging down from the ceiling. Ron's right, though. There are loads of paps, though Harry didn't notice them coming in. They're like background buzz to him by now. Gnat animagus, the lot of them. But it
Draco said I did a good job, very theatrical, he would have given it an Oscar. He said, "You make a mess of murder."
They'd buried Draco no more than a week ago, and—Harry steadied his breath. "Draco. You know I can't."
Eltanin takes out two sticks of Sobering Gum and hands one to Harry. "Come on," he says. "Chew this and drive me to work in your fancy car. I'll forgive you if you hook me up with the valet."
“Better?” Harry asks. He’s dressed in his Gryffindor Quidditch robes, and his face is as round as when he was eighteen.
"You drive me crazy," Draco says. "I can't—I don't want to have this conversation in a club, half-drunk like this."
“You don’t like it, Harry?” He’s halfway up the ladder, wand out and coaxing the ceiling higher. The chandelier waits, an enormous extravagance twinkling at my feet.
"Merlin, grow up," Draco snips back. "You don't like closets? Fine. No closets." He slashes his wand once, viciously, and the door to the closet door melts back into the wall as though it never existed at all.
When Neville passed, he tipped his hat, but his face didn’t change. I pulled him to the side and asked if he wanted to have a drink. He was taken aback, as we hadn't spoken in years. Still, he acquiesced. The name Harry Potter still held weight, and he couldn’t afford a public condemnation.
"Sounds boring," Harry says because it's true. Draco deserves the best. And Harry doesn't have a big enough ego to think he's the best, but if Draco thinks Harry is incredible but can barely remember what the new guy does for eight hours a day, Harry definitely has him beat.
"You're both bloody lucky I still work here," Dean sighs as he approaches the holding cell. He leers at them between the bars with his arms crossed and his mouth a stern grimace. "Seriously? Again?"
He leaned in and brushed his lips against mine. I pulled him in by the neck, opening up, my entire chest stinging with anticipation. Like counting the seconds before thunder.
"Shouldn't it go first? Seems wasteful to move all the furniture, only to empty a room again to paper it," Harry asks into the air above. He's got to do something about the ceiling; it's far too blank to be the first thing he sees every morning.
," Pansy read down the spine. "How much did it cost you? Fifty Galleons? At this rate, you'll drain your inheritance dry, filling up your bedroom bookcases alone."
They don’t know you like I do. They don’t know about the time you lost your temper when I failed yet again to conjure a Patronus. You said, “Fuck, Draco. We’ve been together five years, and you still can’t think of a single happy memory?”
“No. It makes you sick. You begin wanting things, seeing things that aren’t there — until your eyes swim in lies.” He downs his glass.
Their flat has one of those balconies that's too small to do anything except smoke or holler down at a friend. The street below is clean and well-lit day or night, the pavement fissured from Indian laurels long outgrown their concrete confines.
"Yeah. Okay." Draco clears his throat. It's plain that he doesn't believe Harry. "I can't just come over right now. I'm already taking a risk by calling you from the office loo. But I'll stop by later, okay?"
," Malfoy mocks. "You single-handedly drove customer engagement by three-hundred percent in the last week alone. They can't have you falling off now. You're a literal cash cockatrice."
Harry laughs. "That's a bit much, isn't it? Kindness? I expected an insult from you. Or at least a comment about how I forgot to put them in sleeves because my hand's scalding right now, Merlin."
Hermione says the best way to win an argument is to not care. She did a lot of not caring, running for Minister and changing the world that way. It's too bad my favourite way to win an argument is to blow the brains out of the opposition.
"I like stories," Harry said some weeks later, after he'd completed the herculean feat of finishing three novels. "But I wouldn't trade all the love stories in the world for what we have now."
Ginny pulls a Muffliato on them. "Foreplay," Harry sees her mouth to Pansy, rolling her eyes. Pansy grins.
"We know!" the tall one pipes up. "You did it with Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley and Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood…" the girl rattles off a long list of names from memory so complete that she might as well be reading off Harry's address book.
If Draco’s favourite word is No, then Harry’s favourite word is maybe something like Alright, okay, okay, I’ve got you, I’ll stay.
"Oh, too hard," Draco said, though he was already smiling from the question. What a joy to reflect through all the brilliance he'd ever read!
Eltanin focuses on Harry with the same quiet consideration as he gave the pen. "Draco said you were impressive, but I didn't believe him, to be honest. I was expecting like, heroic Protegos or epic duels with Unforgivables, or something, I don't know, huge. But you really are quite remarkable, aren't you? Imposing in the most innocuous of ways."
Ginny shows up at Nylon with Pansy an hour after Harry. They make a riot of the dance floor, the only two out there this early in the night when the music still echoes in the cavernous warehouse. Harry watches them from the bar, the drink dulling the edge off his thoughts.
“Good morning,” Harry says. His hair is mussed from sleep, his glasses left by the bedside table. Little creases in the corners of his eyes squeeze together in age or joy or both. He drags an arm around Draco’s waist and pulls him in closer, their legs tangled up in seafoam sheets kicked off in the night.
"Merlin, Harry. That's why. You only ever want one thing from me, and that's not fair. I'm not—I'm not going to just have sex with you. I thought I could, but that's not enough for me. I want...I
"It's as good as it ever is," Harry says. There's something disingenuous about the speech, but he can't put why into words.
Harry shrugs, though his face heats in embarrassment. "Yeah. The broom's kind of boring on its own."
“They’re orphans, Potter,” Draco says as though that means something to Harry, being an orphan himself. It doesn’t, of course. Harry used to worry that he doesn’t care how he’s supposed to. But lately, he just considers himself lucky. Here’s Draco in a rundown studio flat, unable to give up his great-grandmother’s silverware. Across town, Hermione is burning the midnight oil on yet another set of hopeless reform bills. Everyone holds onto the past like they owe it their future, but Harry’s discovered the way out.
"I want so badly to, you don't understand. You're amazing." Draco leans his head against Harry's shoulder, the halo of his hair tickling Harry's nose. "You make me want to be bad."
Draco scrunches his face up, making his own list. When he finishes, he says, “Seven, actually.” His face is soft. “I was going to wait until after the wedding, but it’s probably better if I show you now.”
“Don’t wear that,” Draco calls from the doorway. He walks up and slaps Harry’s hand from the cupboard door. “Don’t fucking wear a baseball cap around here, alright? Didn’t you read the handbook?”
In spring they’d grown, but it’s summer now, the days warm and endless, and Draco, tan on the undersides of his arms, on the soles of his feet.
The storm comes like an upended bucket from the heavens, gator-cruel and biting, love it or leave it and nothing in between. Soon, even the blood smells of rain.
"I don't think it's enough," Hermione says. "Even with your speech—sorry. Sorry, I don't mean to belittle what you do for me, and I know how much you hate those things. The Ministry. Politics."
Draco is not a powerful Auror, but he’s known the scent of darkness since childhood and learned better than to chase it up Manor bannisters. But.
"He didn't," I said. I tried but couldn't make sense of his face; it wasn't like I looked at him when I lived in his head.
When Draco awoke in the morning, he found that he was a beetle, and not a particularly dazzling one at that, with a dull black coat and ridged legs so brittle that he almost snapped one trying to get up.
"You're disgusting," a voice says from the kitchen island. Harry jerks up, slice dropped in favour of his wand—but it's only Ginny. She's wearing Adidas joggers and a yellow baby tee with a single daisy embroidered, the shapely contours of her firm abs left explicit to the imagination.
"Who were you with?" Ginny asks, then demands, pushing Harry down and sitting on his chest to bully him into a confession.
Ginny inhales—coughing—then hands the joint back to Harry. "Why the fuck would he know? We're getting a divorce."
We were at his flat the other day when Draco tried to explain to me the shape of the universe. Draco applied for Muggle uni after Hogwarts and got into cosmology that way, so he was thinking about this type of problem all the time. I understood that it was his job, but why dedicate his life to uncovering the formulas to a time and  place he could never go, when he’d barely grown roots on his own planet?
“A birthday cruise?” Draco asks as he mixes and shakes and stirs. Harry leans over the bamboo bar and sticks a pink paper umbrella behind his ear. “They all wanted to,” he says, laughing sheepishly as though, of course, it’s never for him.
They don’t kiss after the Fiendfyre, but Harry wonders if they would’ve if Draco had stayed, said thanks. Saving someone’s life ties you to them, inks their name in your book of cares, so worrying for Draco becomes reflexive, blends into a love that dies with the war. Like an ashwinder, risen from embers only to crumble to dust.
Could this broom double as a sex toy? It's not a bad idea. It wouldn’t take much effort, either: a simple adhesive charm would do the trick. Harry just needs a cock. Maybe he could Accio one, or transfigure one out of a kettlebell…though that would be dangerous if the enchantment breaks. Why bother with plastics when Harry had a cock himself?
“Thing’s scarcely useful now that they’ve got regulations on everything. Can’t cast a Bat-Bogey charm without some low-level Auror showing up at my door. Say,”
"I hate politics," Harry sulks. "I hate you for dragging me back into it." But he doesn't protest further; it's not her fault that half her votes come from people who think she keeps Harry on a short leash. She can't escape Harry's fame. That's the price of his friendship.
"Uh huh," Harry said. Lightning-fast hands came up around Draco's waist, gripping tight before he rolled them over again. “The fuck you’re not.”
No, it's not, Harry wants to protest. Not without you in it. But there's a stubborn glint in Draco's eyes that tells Harry that no matter what he says, there's no convincing Draco otherwise.
Should. Shouldn’t. Those two words passed judgment over every one of my choices. I should’ve befriended Harry. I shouldn’t have lost against him at Quidditch. I should’ve killed Dumbledore. I shouldn’t have led Vince into that room to die. I should’ve taken up my father’s seat at Wizengamot. I shouldn’t have joined the Aurors, and I absolutely shouldn’t have asked Harry to marry me.
They're on the stretch of pavement outside Draco's flat. Draco's wand is out and spelling Harry's hands warm. He wraps protection charms around Harry's kneecaps, smooths the scars over Harry's elbows, heals the blunt-razor knick on Harry's neck, then makes a note to buy him a new one —
Harry’s first case is an armed robbery at Maulfield’s Apothecary that unravels into six months of illegal potions, Muggle gangsters, and goblins. His second case is Draco Malfoy.
I step down from the ladder and wipe my hands over my apron. My hands aren’t dirty, but a grime settles under my nails all the same. From across the counter, two cuts slash down Potter’s cheek in an unbalanced cross. I recognise one, but the other is new, still puffy from a flesh-stitching charm.
Harry sucks off the ugly smile plastered over Malfoy's face. Malfoy tastes sweet and entirely sober, which can't be right because Harry's soaked in wine from dinner.
They return to schedule. Malfoy's thighs are still slick with lube, so Harry ruts between them until he comes with a perfunctory grunt. It doesn't take him any time, though Malfoy lingers longer than he should, fingers brushing down Harry's cheek with tenderness, like they both weren't splattered in cum.
Some nights the moon shines brighter than the sun, and Draco lurches up, drenched in it, as though he drowned in his dreams. He can see the moon from the lonely window in his room, the room in Hangzhou that he took up to get as far from his father as he could.
The first name he gave was Corban Yaxley. He was hiding out in Thailand with a Thai wife and a half-Thai three-year-old son. Mornings, he rode out on his motorbike and got a coffee and a cake at the only bakery in town. He’d sit out on the side of the road and eat the dry cupcake down to the wrapper before wiping off his trousers and crossing the street to the beach resort, where he was the manager. It was easy to snuff him out. All I did was rent a Tuk-Tuk and catch him in the middle of the road. Tire treads down his body, and that was it. Dead.
Harry gives a helpless shrug of his shoulders. He's learned to let Ginny do the talking, and if Dean wants to believe that Harry's "overly powerful, Voldemort-killing" magic threw a magnum of vodka over the more realistic version that it was Ginny who did it, then so be it.
It is six-thirty, the sun a yolk-yellow beacon rising between the trees. Draco laces up his trainers and tugs at his socks before opening the door to the dewy dampness of morning.
I’d scribbled on the back of a used sticky note, one of several dozen piled up on my desk still to do, and I nearly cried trying to remember if I’d done the thing on the sticky after I sent it.
