Potter cleared his throat and rubbed a spot on the back of his neck. “I have found that to be a useful technique, but it’s not all I’m teaching them. Johnson, Puri, care to show Mr. Malfoy what you can do?”
He always felt a bit flustered working with any of the fantasy line of products. He knew every person saw something different when they looked at the packaging. George made no secret of the fact that all his fantasies still revolved around Angelina Johnson, for instance. But Draco couldn't help worrying that Fred and George especially, as the creators of the products, would be able to see what he saw whenever he picked up the Daydream products.
“But that’s not actually the most interesting part of it. Did you know, that’s when Harry became master of the Elder Wand? You were actually master of it before Harry, and that’s why Voldemort couldn’t use it in the end. If Voldemort had disarmed you before Harry did...it might have all gone the other way.”
He swallowed. Maybe this was some Christmas tradition he knew nothing about, or they'd decided to put the kids to bed early and have a very quiet, very dark celebration. He knocked sharply.
She shook the snow off her head. "I don't know if you're hearing me. I don't have a home around here. I live in heaven. I'm an angel."
And kept you safe
Almost before he knew it, Draco’s hand was in the air, moving toward Potter.
“That I’m what?”
He could feel the difference. What moved through him and poured forth wasn’t feeble. It wasn’t weak. It was solid and tangible. It was something real.
Potter reached into his robe and pulled out a wand. No, not just a wand--his wand. “I didn’t know how to give you this.”
“What you told me,” Potter snapped, “Was that me thinking you could like me was a joke. That I’d been naive to listen to the first years and my friends, and that you wanted all of us to stay away from you.”
Once he'd cast spells over both of them to dry their clothes and warm them up, he took in the girl's appearance. "You look like you're dressed for a party. Do you have somewhere you're supposed to be?"
“Okay,” Hermione said. “Second guess. A stag.”
Ron put his hand on her arm, still trying to swallow his laughter. “Harry’s just Harry. He’d think something was caused by a blibbering humdinger before he’d think it was caused by somebody fancying him. Do you want us to talk to him?”
Or he could open his mouth and remove all doubt. “There’s a difference between colliding with me in a match and trailing your hand down my sternum.” He wasn’t sure why he’d said it, except that some part of him revelled in making a bad situation irredeemable. He was too embarrassed to see how the Weasley clan had taken it, but Potter was positively spluttering.
Potter’s head jerked and he rubbed his eyes. “What?”
"I suppose you better run along and tell all your friends the news," Lockhart offered, still smiling so wide that his face looked ready to crack in half. "And wish them a Happy Christmas for me, won't you?"
Oh. Potter was standing now, walking towards him. Draco barely had time to stand before Potter was right there, crowding the space between him and puffing hot breaths on Draco’s collar. “Can I touch you now?”
Draco angled steeply toward the ground and jumped off before his broom came to a halt. Instead of giving the snitch to Hermione, who was tending the ball box rather than participating, he flung it as hard as he could at the ground. The ball stopped inches from the mud and veered away.
Lacey had been a little slower to reach them, but she was beaming just as bright. She lifted her wand. “Expecto Patronum.”
"And by that," Pansy said, "Hermione means they let us hold things while they whipped this up."
"She told me I was doing the best I possibly could, considering. She wasn't even trying to be mean about it. She just knows that you're never going to have the same feelings about me that I do about you."
She smiled. "I know the story. I happen to really like reading, especially stories that make me think about how people are. The Deathly Hallows is a good story for that. Is that related to what you said about feeling like a ghost?"
*** *** ***
It was too dim to see much of Harry’s face, but Draco could see the way his hands were working in and out of fists.
He turned from the main street of Diagon Alley and into the more residential neighborhood behind it. It was mostly shopkeepers and their families living in this particular neighborhood, but when Andromeda had wanted to downsize from her country house, Draco had found this place, and the three of them--Andromeda, Teddy, and Draco, had been living there since.
“For what?”
With every step he took, Draco felt panic pounding in his heart. The Aurors might already be on his tail.
Harry standing this close.
Harry laughed, and this time his lips found their mark.
“What do you think Potter will think of these favors I’ve made?” he asked, tossing one to Pansy. It was an effort to hold back the smug smile.
She wrinkled her nose, disgusted. "Lucius never reproduced, thank Merlin. He's a disgusting criminal, and anyone claiming to be related to him has no place in my house."
Potter went around the classroom, guiding their wandwork and encouraging them to focus on their memories, and Draco watched as student after student cast more realistic looking Patronuses. The best he’d gotten from his wand was a trickle of white smoke. Even Pansy had a wobbly-legged cat circling her wand.
“It is an honor and a privilege beyond what I can acknowledge to welcome all of you to a new year at Hogwarts. Most of you know that we have been through the darkest of days. For those of you who are new to this world, you should know that we look to you as a great hope. There was a time I thought we would never see another class of first years walk through these halls. But here you are. Let it serve as a reminder to all of us that hope can be found, even in the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light.”
"The Muggles. Your relatives. Where are they now? You don't want me to kill them, fine. There are other ways to make life intolerable."
On the afternoon of Christmas Eve, their last-minute strategy session was interrupted by just such a game. And when the snitch glinted in the dying afternoon light, Draco streaked toward it. Potter was closer, he’d easily bump Draco aside and claim the snitch. Still, Draco flattened himself to the borrowed broom, hoping that the head start could carry him.
And then Draco's hands were in Harry's hair and looped behind Harry's back, and even though the first touch still surprised Harry, he reached back. Draco was really pleased with the picture already, but Harry was hoping he could go two for two.
"You're saying that you'd like me to reserve you a job? It's not as though I can wait a year--"
“Fairy lights,” she told the Fat Lady, and stepped into the Common Room without looking back at Ron.
He smiled often enough when he was around Fred and George, trying to prove that he did have a sense of humor. The kids, whether it was Teddy or Zoe or Jamie, always made him laugh. And Potter, of course. He smiled for Potter.
The fireplace lit up with green light, and a head popped up in the grate. "Hello! It's way too loud over there. Can anyone hear me?"
When Potter interrupted Draco’s sleep for the third time, he was standing at Potter’s bedside before the boy woke up. Of course they’d said Neville was supposed to be the one to talk Potter down from these little episodes,  but Neville was snoring. Loudly.
The green eyes widened, then broke contact. “Really?”
Ron cleared his throat. “Listen, I better follow him and see if he’s alright. That was a bit weird. I’m sure Pansy will want to hear about
Potter blinked. “Ron and Hermione? No. They always go snog in the first floor bathroom after dinner.”
Potter cursed. “Figures. Malfoy or…”
There had been little hints, almost guilty mentions, that Draco had already liked Harry, and Harry wanted to know about it. But Draco already felt like he was the one who had fallen harder, and much as Harry wanted to know how long Draco had been waiting, he didn't want to do it while Draco still felt like they were in such different places.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea.”
It was snowing even harder than the night before, but without the wind, the enormous flakes drifted down gracefully, catching the light of the nearby shops and filling the air. Draco took in the scene, shifted the bags of gold in his hands, and felt the corners of his lips pulling back into a smile.
"Five, four, three, two, one! That's it!" Fred shouted, flipping the sign on the door to "CLOSED to YOU, NUMPTIES" and jiggling the lock into place.
“My family has a tradition of playing a friendly Quidditch match every Christmas. Harry’s always captain of one team, and I’m captain of the other. So I heard you were coming to visit for the holidays, and I thought to myself, this year I’m going to win. If there’s one person in the world who wants to beat him as much as I do, it’s you. You’ll be my seeker, won’t you?”
Instead of starving his thoughts, he let them engulf him. Potter holding Draco’s knee in his hands after the Quidditch game. Potter seeing the scars on his chest and looking into Draco’s eyes with the exact expression Draco had imagined a thousand times and never truly expected to see. Potter choosing to sit next to him on the train back to Hogwarts, and the casual warmth where their knees rested against each other.
"If we were," Potter answered, "We wouldn't be doing it in your joke shop. Speaking of which, Malfoy. You really ought to come down and see all this for yourself some time."
The first years’ sorting finished and food appeared before them, but there was still an uneasy quiet over the hall. Several of the first years were crying softly at their table, and even though the Slytherins there were trying to be welcoming, it felt hollow.
"Including you?"
Another Gryffindor piped up. “You did it to get Mr. Potter out of the room, I bet. So you could use your dark magic on us!” She held her wand grimly, pointed towards Draco.
“I wish it was quiet in our room,” Draco growled. Mostly to change the subject, but honestly. The boys he’d shared a room with growing up had their rowdy moments, but it was nothing compared with having Gryffindors traipsing through. “I don’t think anyone ever taught Potter to talk in an inside voice.
"He's still out looking for you," Kingsley intoned from behind him. "I sent a Patronus to track him down, so--"
quit before this kills me."
"That happened one time! You gave up after one try. I know you, Potter. I know you don't give up that easily on anything you actually care about."
Time to make an exit. “I believe Molly wanted us inside for Christmas Eve dinner, and I’ve got to wash up.”
Harry walked across the room to stand next to his body, and the students scrambled to answer the question.
"Is that an actual question? Claire asked, "Or are you just talking to yourself?"
In the Weasley house--he didn’t want to even think the word “Burrow” about a structure that he’d be sleeping in--getting into the bathroom was a minor miracle, and every minute spent therein was at a premium. He’d gone down to scope it out a minute ago, and Hermione, Ginny and Fleur had all be crowded inside, brushing their teeth.
Draco eyed the brown paper package suspiciously. "What's this."
"Mister Potter," McGonagall continued before he could speak. "I have not asked your leave to perform a play in three acts, just to explain my position. I feel that assigning Malfoy the Defense Against the Dark Arts class would be contrary to his natural talents and inclinations."
Harry felt like his feet were flying over the grounds toward the Quidditch stands, and Draco was laughing at his side, huffing as he tried to keep up. "Slow down, Potter."
“Where is he?” Potter’s voice croaked. “Did he-- is he--”
On some level he’d known from the moment Pansy told him that all the eighth-years would be living together that he’d end up far too close to Potter. Why be reasonable when you can force the issue? When the four houses had cleared out, McGonagall addressed the eighth years. Draco tuned her out as she explained the new housing situation. He stared into his cup and his mind drifted to what the Slytherin first years were seeing for the first time. He hoped the dungeons didn’t scare them. He hoped the older kids were playing nice.
When Harry did get around to asking, Draco agreed to the Polyjuice trick, and Slughorn was happy to help Harry out by providing Polyjuice from his stores. Harry has thought switching bodies would be fun and definitely instructive right up until the moment that Draco and he were both standing in their room, wearing each other's clothes and holding their cups. Draco grinned and held his portion high. "To our health." Harry could tell from the  silly ceremony that Draco was putting into it that Draco was feeling nervous about the exchange, too. Maybe he wasn't entirely pants at figuring out how Draco was feeling.
“Oh, the trace is a joke?” Hermione responded, eyebrows rising. “Maybe when you come from a magic family the trace is a joke, but it wasn’t a joke when Harry nearly got expelled. It wasn’t a joke when I sat at home wondering what magic you were practicing while all I could do was read about it.”
“You have the other houses tomorrow, right? I’ll see you then.” It was a ridiculous exit line. They shared a bedroom. Draco kicked himself as he swept out of the room.
“I think I’ll pass,” Draco muttered. He swayed in place. It seemed wrong to be here, intruding on the tail end of their party, when they’d been enjoying themselves. That was the point of not going in the first place.
But Draco couldn't mistake the fondness in Harry's voice as he spoke. When Harry had opened a home for children three years ago, Draco had specifically heard him tell Fred and George, "I've faced down Voldemort. A few kids should be a breeze after that."
Finally, the kids had been bundled home for a Christmas Eve of sipping cocoa and opening gifts donated by customers of the shop. Harry had waved his goodbyes as he was swept out the door in a crowd of admirers. The final customers had been satisfied, and Fred was counting down the seconds until nine, when they were officially closed for the night.
*** *** ***
When all the students were settled, he lifted his chin. "Let's begin with body awareness. Take a few breaths and focus on that breath in your lungs." He tried not to overdo it on the posh, imperious voice. Overdoing it would just as quickly catch the students' attention.
“True. What do you think it means that you’re the one he’s waking up thinking about?”
And Draco could have bristled at that. When he’d first started at the joke shop, he would have. Back then he still thought this was a temporary stop on his journey to something greater. Draco Malfoy wasn’t the kind of person to end up trapped as a shopkeeper for the rest of his life.
"If you've already arrested him, come on through," Harry called. "The party's just begun."
So when Potter didn’t even come to dinner that night, he cleared his throat and pushed the food around on his plate and said, “I’m worried about Potter.”
Draco laughed bitterly. "That's just because you like beating me at things. We can do that any time."
"Well, well, well," a voice called.
This was really good. Harry looked at the expression on Draco's face, which was clearly trying to be calm and collected, but was actually sparking with energy. "But, Headmistress," Draco said before she could shepherd him out the door. "You never mentioned Lacey. If I've got the position, is she going to be staying here?"
He tried to get back to his feet, but he couldn’t step forward. It didn’t matter. He could run--he could search every street in London, and it didn’t mean he’d be able to find the kids who were missing from the home. Even if he did, it wouldn’t fix anything. He’d found Teddy, and it had still been all wrong.
Draco looked the boy in the eyes. “I can see everything you’re thinking right now.”
“Of course.”
Potter turned over so he was facing away from Draco. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Draco didn’t turn around. Why hadn’t he disguised himself? Why had Pansy left him? Why did Weasley have to notice him just when the cashier was glaring at his money?
“You’re not ready to help with this,” Draco answered, holding his wand against his side. So help him, if he got his magic reinstated just to full-body-bind seven first-years and have it taken away again, he was going to snap his own wand in half and start using an umbrella.
The eighth years filed into the Defense classroom same configuration of seats that they’d taken in Potions. Seats that grouped everyone together and left him and Pansy several seats off. He wondered how Potter and Granger knew anything about the defense teacher. Who was even left to teach defense?
When it had first opened, the papers had been full of stories about Harry's Home for Children. About how good and noble he was, to care for the orphans of the war, or squibs or, as he put it "Anyone who needs a family that will love them for just who they are."
And as the train progressed, Draco began to relax as well. Potter wasn’t paying any attention. He wouldn’t notice when Draco let himself melt into the contact instead of pulling away.
He knew what it must say. He knew what most of the gravestones in this cemetery would likely say. But his hand reached out anyway. It moved almost on its own, like an arm that belonged to someone else. He dusted away the snow from the bottom of the stone.
Also welcome to my ongoing internal struggle about teaching, projected onto Harry.
Draco glanced at him. It was important not to smirk. That would be mean. But he could feel bubbles of relief in him, and they might just slip out in something that Potter would misread. “It’s not as if you’re the only one, Potter,”  he yawned. “All this drama over nightmares that we all have after the war.” He closed his trunk and sat on his bed.
“He had a nightmare.”
“They don’t,” Draco said darkly. “Not without qualified nannies.”
“The first years basically sorted it out on their own,” he said. “I was just there.”
I set you right
Draco and McGonagall looked, similarly, like they wished Harry had left that out of the discussion.
In other words, four months earlier, retired author Gilderoy Lockhart had opened a joke shop just down the street, and suddenly his shelves were stocked with everything that had been unique and brilliant about Weasley's Wizard Wheezes. And all at slightly lower prices.
“I’m not planning on letting you win tomorrow."
"Thought that anyone who could figure out the charms ought to have their own crack at making things," Fred muttered. "Didn't exactly foresee that they'd want to settle two shops down and put us out of business."
Pansy looked startled, her hand halfway to her mouth.
April 1, 1979 - May 2, 1998
“She wanted to talk about your trial. She thinks she’s come up with something that they’ll have to listen to, but she wanted to talk to you about it all. Left a note on your bed.”
Potter’s boots touched nimbly down just in front of him. Potter wins again. Just like always.
Draco tightened his grip on his broom. “Of course.”
Someone at the 8th year table frowned. “I feel sorry for the kids. They shouldn’t be forced into that house. Especially if they’re muggle-raised.”
Malfoy startled. He looked around for the mistaken voice and spotted a Slytherin first year looking up at him.
Of course, at that moment there was a commotion on the staircase, and Harry rushed into view seconds before Professor McGonagall. Draco vanished his doe and pocketed his wand.
"I don't like you asking questions about my grandson," Andromeda snarled. "Some death-eater wannabe trying to get information on anyone from the Order who survived? I'm calling the Aurors."
“We can’t fix it if you won’t tell us what went wrong,” Granger pressed.
Harry let his feet carry him away from the celebrants. He'd catch up with Ginny later and tell her what a great game she'd played. He really would this time. But right now he didn't want his bad feelings passing to anybody else, and he found himself sitting back in his Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom. Maybe he could finally mark the students' quizzes. It was actually easier to think about now. There was only a week left, and all of it would be taken up with examinations. And then he'd be done, truly done.
No. Draco had to go find that gold.
Draco waited until Pansy was hurrying after Granger before he rolled his eyes.
“Yes?” Malfoy was feeling too unsteady to have a conversation with anyone right now. But stomping off now wouldn't earn him any points.
Pansy’s face didn’t hold a hint of amusement. In fact, she looked pained. “Maybe he wasn’t being clueless. Maybe he got it, but he didn’t want to get it.”
“We have a plan,” Pansy hissed. “Let’s go.”
"There's really nothing for it," Draco said, and then he pointed his wand at the dubious pile of odds and ends. "Evanesco, Evanesco, Evanesco."
Draco opened his eyes and nearly dropped his wand. The thing before him was graceful and delicate and beautiful and should never have happened.
“Technically correct. I did say those things.”
Draco expected Potter to have him wait after Defense class their first day back, and he wasn't disappointed. Potter handed Draco his wand. “I know you haven’t wanted to take it back. But you should try it this time with your own wand. And if the trial goes to plan next week, maybe you’ll be able to use it more.”
Her white-blonde eyebrows rose in dismay. "Oh no. You musn't talk like that."
But Pansy was a different story. He let her get away with her little joke because she never pushed it any farther. In fact, it was almost like a code.
After the singing, Draco snuck away upstairs. It was meant to be a family time. He didn’t feel unwelcome, exactly. Just unnecessary.
Draco cleared his head. "If you have them here at ten, we can make sure they're all in costume and ready by ten-thirty. We'll have them sing for an hour at a time with half-hour breaks, and you'll be standing next to Santa so the parents can get pictures with Santa and you."
"Weasley," the goblin at the fore of the group interrupted. "You can save your gab. The two of you are months behind on payments for the shop."
“What do you really think of—“ It took Draco a moment to locate the question he really wanted to ask. “Of us coming back.”
Potter frowned. “Everyone’s busy. Trying to fix things. McGonagall’s at the Ministry nearly every day working with them on revising some of the legal policies. There are a lot of posts that need covering. Defense isn’t the only class that--”
He wasn’t surprised to find that the party had been much more focused on beverages than food, and any snacks that had previously been up for grabs were long gone.
"I'm not going to work for them, either. Not next year. I mean, maybe a bit. I'd like to help Hermione get her new department sorted out, and if I can, I'll probably spend some time doing that."
"I don't want to spend my whole life hiding from death. I thought that I would face death when it came, but I tried to face it, and I didn't have the follow through. I couldn't go on. I'm just here like a shadow. And some days it's almost like life. Some days I can actually--I can eat the birthday cake, or whatever. But then night comes, and I remember that no matter how good things are for a second, I'm never going to get away from these nightmares."
"Of course you're the problem," she said, and then, when she caught sight of the expression on his face, she softened. "No. You're not a problem, Harry. You're a good thing. It’s not your fault you’re the way you are, either. But at this point, you are the one responsible for sorting yourself out. And you already knew that.”
“Butterbeer will actually be alcoholic. Like, enough to get the job done.” That was Pansy’s contribution.
“So,” that gleeful, predatory grin was back in Potter’s voice. “You’ve had a crush on me since fourth year.”
“I know I already said you were cracking up, but now you’ve gone round the bend. Little kids can’t learn Occlumency. Most adults can’t learn Occlumency. That’s why it’s not on the bleeding curriculum. You’re the most powerful wizard of our age, and you’re pants at it after studying with an actual teacher who was the best Occlumens alive. You’re trying to drive yourself mad, is that it? You’re determined that the Defense post is going to keep being cursed by driving you absolutely bat-shit insane?”
“Yes. Thoughts. Feelings. Memories. My head is full of them, of course. If you walked in here and found nothing, you would know I have something to hide. I’m not hiding my thoughts, I just don’t keep any of them as pets. They’re all filed away. Neatly.”
"No, that's--I don't mean that I don't want you to be a part of that future. I mean I can't do the building with you, I have to do it myself to know that I can make this work. I don't want you to get me a job and then always feel like I owe you everything I'm ever able to achieve. I messed up, Merlin, I messed up, but I want to know that I'm still able to do something worth doing."
Ginny looked to Draco. “We’ve got this, right?”
No no. Not this. Draco had thought this moment couldn't get worse, but his heart sank even lower. His breath puffed visibly in the air in small, tight gasps. “Mr. Lockhart.”
Potter straightened. “Right. Go ahead.”
"The joke shop that hasn't existed for years?" Claire whispered.
What could he say that wouldn’t scare her more than she had already been scared today? He knew somebody should tell her the truth. She deserved to know. She needed to know, if she was going to keep defending herself from the dark. He wished people had told him more of the truth when he was young enough that it would do him any good. “I don’t know everything about it,” Draco said, hesitantly. “But sometimes when wizards are having really dark thoughts, they turn on themselves and try to hurt themselves. It can happen if a wizard or witch doesn’t believe their magic is a good thing.”
"You had to do it," Draco said.
“No. Just--it looks like a study or a library. There’s books everywhere.”
Draco thought of the way Fred watched him from the corner of his eyes, and his heart sank. He knew the Aurors would never believe him, but he couldn’t even expect the Weasleys to be on his side. He couldn't even remember what had happened, himself.
Ginny pressed her lips together. "First, I asked if he was doing that thing you like during sex."
Draco blanched. “Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom?”
“It makes it easier.” Draco rinsed his mouth out. The bitter taste remained.
That had been back when Draco still wanted to hit the smug grin off of Harry's face. Back when Harry's frequent visits to the joke shop caused Draco to find work in the back room to minimize the awkwardness of the two of them being in the same place for any length of time. They weren't enemies. Not exactly. Draco had done enough in the final Battle of Hogwarts that Potter had officially spoken in Draco's defense at his trial. It was probably the only thing that kept Draco and his parents from living out their days in Azkaban. But they'd been a far cry from friends.
Pansy used her elbow like a knife in his rib. “He means thank you, Professor Hagrid. He’s just nervous.”
“Spiked with Veritaserum,” Potter explained, and Neville dropped the handle.
The quill dropped to the ground, and Harry spun around to see Draco tucking his wand away.
“Malfoy, could you stay a second after class?”
Hermione still looked troubled. “But what if--?
But he was just staring back at Hermione and Ron and Pansy, while Seamus was still trying to figure out how two of his four test subjects preferred Viktor Krum over anyone else at the school. Draco was blushing. It was suspicious.
In fact, he did stay quiet as one by one, the others lost interest and started heading off toward their rooms. Pansy rolled off to bed, and once they’d made it to 100 things, Hermione ended the spell that had been recording their list, and she left. Finnegan and Thomas’s conversation escalated into something that involved their bodies more and their mouths less, and they left. Draco’s mind had been wandering, but he jerked back to the present when Potter said, “Just you and me left.”
Harry gave a short snort of a laugh. Maybe he wasn't good at hiding what a mess he was, but there were plenty of people who had overlooked it. He turned around, and he could see the fury building on Draco's face. Harry turned around properly to face him.
"Will you believe, the goblins said they'd keep a skeleton crew there late tonight just for our deposit. I think they've gotten fond of us!"
"Right, that's why they--"
"That's not what I mean. I mean, it is. It's part of it, because you help me be the person that I want to be in the world, even though sometimes I think I'm going to absolutely lose my mind. But also, I think--oh Merlin. This is the wrong time for this, but I'm going to do it anyway. I'm at least part way towards being in love with you, and I have been for a long time."
Neville hurried over to Potter’s bed, but not before Draco heard Potter muttering the same questions as last night. He swung his legs out of bed and crossed the room. “As you can see, Potter, I’m alive and unhurt. Now whether this was your fear or sets your fears to rest, I don’t know, but that’s the status.”
If the ministry was going to take him, they’d have to catch him first.
“Careful, Mione,” Ron frowned.
Oops. He hadn’t planned to have venom dripping from every word like that, but it was too late, and Pansy had certainly felt the sting.
Right. A portion of the seventh floor that just-so-happened to accommodate eighth year sleeping space when it was needed. Malfoy didn’t ask for details. He knew. It kept him glued to his seat, hands balled into fists, even when Pansy spoke. “Draco. Come on. Let’s walk together.”
“Are you ever going to let me go to lunch?” he snapped.
“You haven’t seen your sidekicks, then?”
Ron sat next to Potter and grabbed Potter’s shoulder urgently. “Harry, I’m sorry. We shouldn’t have ever let them send you back.”
“I did say things were unstable.”
“I can’t get them out of my head,” she whispered. “They’re bad thoughts, and I can’t--”
"I shouldn't have reacted like I did," Harry said. "I know I'm not good at telling you things, and when you didn't tell me something, I acted like you'd slighted me personally."
Draco sighed heavily. “He probably cycles through all the people he tried to save during the war, panicking about all of them. Stop trying to make something  out of this, Pansy.”
“One final guess,” Hermione smiled. “A doe.”
*** *** ***
he directed.
Draco tried to manage words, but he was still reeling from the panic he’d been experiencing and confusion that Weasley was asking him to be on her team for anything.
Draco couldn’t see the man’s face, but the voice seemed familiar. The ministry had found him. Which meant that he existed once again. This was his Diagon Alley, with his joke shop, and his  Teddy, and his Harry Potter.
Draco, for his part, was gratified to be the second-most-obsessed with beating Potter. He showed up for every practice, even if he was the only one there. It was different enough from school Quidditch that Draco didn’t feel constant anxiety while playing. The players were of all different ages, and he hadn’t bribed his way onto the team. Sometimes Potter or members of the other team would come out and practice would devolve into a pick-up game. But Potter had kept his distance from Draco ever since the first night, and the practices were no exception.
Draco slid to the floor next to Sam and Lacey. “You’re upset. It’s hard to do a Patronus when you’re hurt. Can anyone tell me what happened?”
Where was Harry Potter when you needed him? Draco was not built for jumping into freezing water to save foolish muggles, but he couldn’t just stand here and watch someone drown.
Draco blushed a deeper shade of red.
"Oh. You're back. Here to apologize?"
But in his Potter-like manner, he plowed forward. “I just wanted to say that I’m sorry for what I did with the spell. And I can understand why you wouldn’t want me to be anywhere near you after that. I wasn’t sure where my boundaries were. But I will destroy you tomorrow in the match.”
"Hopefully not," Pansy hollered at their backs.
But in the early evening, the Head of the Wizengamot stood and spoke in a reedy voice. “In the matter of Pansy Parkinson versus the Magical Community, we rule that under the guidance of a Ministry approved sponsor, Parkinson may once again use magic at her own discretion.
And then there was a hand on his shoulders. "Harry."
“I have to go,” he interrupted. “Excuse me.”
Potter sobbed and pounded his knuckles on the desk. “It was supposed to be better, now. Than it was for me. Or Riddle.”
“To win?” Draco interrupted. “You think that will make me happy, so I can cast a patronus and you can mark it off on your checklist?”
Ginny wouldn’t allow them to lose focus for long, though, and she had everyone dressed in Quidditch gear, armed with brooms, and standing on the little pitch before noon. She gathered the team--Charlie, herself, and Percy as chasers, George and Molly as beaters, Fleur as the keeper and Draco as the Seeker--into a huddle. “This is all I want for Christmas from any of you,” she said urgently. “I want to win this year.”
And as the cashier suspiciously re-counted the coins, he heard the voices behind him.
She nodded. "Your OWLs results and what I've heard from professors indicate that you have a strong aptitude for Potions. As I've told Harry, it's been an ongoing struggle getting Slughorn to remain through the end of the year. I do hope you won't spend your entire career angling to become a Defense professor."
That night, after Potter’s screams ripped him from sleep. Draco sat upright in bed, not certain what he should do. Get up? Say something? Better to let Neville handle it.
Harry strode around the room, lifting his chin so that he was looking down at everything. "What a mess," he observed in the poshest voice he could manage. "These Gryffindors are always leaving their robes everywhere." He flicked at his own robe, hitching a sneer on this face.
“Dry up, Malfoy. I’m not the one who nearly got myself killed in---” his voice quieted and then just stopped. It still felt too real, too close, for him.
It's Harry's B-day (in real life, not the fic). Happy birthday, Harry! Have a hangover and some therapy.
“And he woke up calling out for you?”
“You didn’t drink.”
"Are you laughing?" Harry wasn't even sure if that would be a good thing or the worst thing of all.
"Sorry, Professor," Hariot interrupted, putting his hand in the air at the same time that he started talking. "No offense, but that's you, isn't it? I mean, none of us have got Death Eaters trying to kill us, so--"
is how they let a criminal like you get so involved with things. Not just the joke shop, either. I don't expect people have ever given much thought to how Potter is always letting a convicted criminal come around his group home."
“Can’t tell if you’re worried for me,” she said, taking a buttered roll hesitantly. “Which is unnecessary. Or jealous, which is typical.”
The answer was everybody, and since that had been Snape’s answer, too, he’d never needed to ask the question.
The moment the words were out of his mouth, the answers were compelled from the other four. “Viktor Krum,” Hermione and Ron said in unison, while Pansy answered, “Oliver Wood, of course.”
Another patron of the Leaky laughed. "You think his wife is waiting too?"
"As faculty. At Hogwarts. It doesn't have to be the Defense position, like you said. I could teach Muggle Studies, although we are going to rename that. I suppose I'd be pretty pants at instructing Transfiguration, but I could give it a try."
Which is how Draco found himself on the train in the same compartment with the golden trio and a weight in his chest like he’d packed his trunk there. Luckily, Pansy was jammed on the seat next to him. She was going home to her mother, but when she’d heard that Draco was going to the Burrow for the Holidays she’d spent about five minutes having a physical conniption.
*** *** ***
Potter made a strangled sound, and Draco eyed him sideways, but Potter’s jaw and eyes were clenched. Draco wondered if it brought back memories of Snape’s death, being here. Potter had seen the whole thing, and hadn’t been able to do anything to save him. For a hero that must be difficult.
Draco startled. He wouldn’t have guessed Potter was paying enough attention to notice that Draco’s glass was still full of the first round.
Draco clenched his jaw. How had he managed to work
“But Molly’s already invited you. She’ll be offended if you don’t come."
Pansy took the lead, and Draco followed behind, struggling to keep his head up when two patrons near the door sent heated scowls toward him. If there had been more of a crowd, maybe they could have melted away. Maybe it had been a mistake to come when there were so few people. He forced himself to keep moving. First stop, school books.
“Ginny,” Harry grinned. “To what do we owe the pleasure?”
“I told you, Granger,” Pansy hissed, “We’ve got restrictions on our magic.”
“I sort of miss Snape,” Neville said gloomily, flipping through his potions textbook.
"This is probably really not the thing to say right now. But I would kill him for that."
“Try to complete a sentence, Potter.”
“Malfoy,” Potter greeted. “Hermione came up looking for you earlier."
Draco was still on the floor, so he helped Lacey to her feet. She was still shivering and bleeding from her nose, but she was also solid and alert. As they made their way down the stairs, Lacey whispered, “Professor Malfoy, what did I do?”
“No!” Potter protested. “Well, I was grinning. I might have been gloating. I just--I was happy. Naively happy, as Malfoy helpfully pointed out.” Potter scuffed his feet on the carpet. “Can I go now?"
Harry surveyed the tiny skeletons of Doxies that had collected at the bottom of the cupboard. "I'm thinking, Draco. You know I'm not the swiftest."
And maybe he would have been able to follow his own advice if Potter hadn’t woken the whole room up a second night in a row, screaming Draco’s name. This time Draco didn’t feel the same layer of disorientation.
He moved his fist up an inch, then down on the table. He gave a tight shake of his head. He didn’t have to see her expression to know she was annoyed as she walked away. The plan was to do all this together, and he was already flaking out on her.
“I don’t think it’s a good idea to let you look into my head."
"Professor Potter?" Harry startled and looked back at the class. "You didn't finish giving the instructions."
"Ghosts aren't people like they were when they were alive. They're just the imprint a soul leaves behind. They can't sleep and can't eat, and all they can do is live in their own history. Ghosts choose to stay like a shadow instead of going on. Instead of dying properly like they're supposed to." He spread his hands in front of himself, waiting for her to see it the way he did. If he wasn't a ghost, he might as well be.
Her eyes flew open, and she grinned at Draco.
betrayed me. And I can't go on only trusting Ron and Hermione the whole rest of my life, but I don't know how to start trusting someone, even someone that I enjoy and I'm proud of and I always want to come to rest against.
Now that he hadn’t expected. “Why?”
"That's not--"
But Potter wasn’t really listening anymore. His face was alight. He’d figured out how to save the Draco-in-distress, and Draco couldn’t talk him out of it.
“I thought it would only be fair to warn you all. I get nightmares. And I know I could just ward the curtains and everything but when I wake up, I’m a bit disoriented, and I need somebody to talk me down. Nev already knows all about it and he’s agreed to help, but it might be disturbing. In the night.”
“It’s not you, it wasn't you. You and George and--” his voice broke, “Fred were the only ones who ever came for me. The adults. Dumbledore and McGonagall and--Merlin,
Sam stood from their desk. “That’s why we can’t have you in here. You did something to Lacey’s mind.”
Draco managed the only words he could force out of his lips. “Why are you touching me, Potter?”
“Hold on, Malfoy!” Neville called. “You’ve got to tell us how you did it!”
Potter was shaping up to be a decent professor. He gave them a syllabus on the second week of class. Draco could agree, from an objective view, that the syllabus covered important things, but as a student he wasn’t looking forward to learning the things on the list with the people in the room. The first unit was about casting Patronuses, which was review for most of the eighth years. They’d been part of the secret club that practiced together while Draco waited outside for a chance to turn them in. He knew the spell, he knew the concept behind it--he’d even tried to cast it a few times. But nothing ever happened for him. Being graded on the spell didn’t improve his work any.
"Well, Mister Potter. Now that's taken care of, do you care to clue us in on your plans?"
Toward Draco. So close that their hips were touching, and their knees. So close that Draco couldn’t pull entirely away. So close that there was plenty of room for Pansy at the other end of the seat. She gaped for a moment too long, and Draco panicked that she was going to say something.
Draco-as-Harry was reading through scenarios where somebody could be using a dark disguise and leading the students through a discussion of how they'd figure out the disguise.
Draco staggered to his feet and started running. He passed his own home--it was mysteriously dark, no candles in the window, and the joke shop, once again boasting the rabbit and the hat on top of the building.
Claire shrugged. “She makes really terrible cookies.”
Harry, as usual, had opted to take a high vantage point and scan the field from there. Draco stayed lower. Even though it might be harder to spot the snitch, there was a chance he’d be closer, and he’d need every advantage he could get on this borrowed broom.
The thrill he got in the center of his chest when Potter scowled at him? The nights he stayed awake in bed planning how he’d come out ahead in his next argument with Potter? The fact that Potter was the first person he thought of whenever he learned a new hex?
But he was the only one reacting with shock. The skin on his left forearm was clean and bare.
"What's wrong with them?" he breathed. "What's wrong with Teddy?"
“You didn’t know? When we were in Malfoy Manor, Harry snatched some wands from Malfoy. And since Harry’d lost his wand, he ended up using Malfoy’s. It was the most loyal to him.”
"I suppose you'll want to run again," Draco huffed, but by the time he'd finished, Harry was already past him and halfway out the door. Draco might complain about running, but he was fast. Harry needed the head start.
Potter’s eyes caught Draco’s, and he hummed. “We’re trying to think of all the ways we’re going to fix the world as grown ups. You know, we’ve already offed Voldemort, so now we can take care of the little things.”
“Room 4: Weasley, Thomas, Boot, and Corner.”
"If Draco's going to be Potions professor, does that mean that you took the job as Defense teacher?"
Happy September 1st/Return to Hogwarts! I really wanted to post today to celebrate, but I'm hoping to post again tomorrow, thereby making this a bonus/beginning of the school year celebration.
Draco snorted. "I didn't actually think that McGonagall would go for that. But it was worth giving it a go."
*Sort of sorry that there's a lot more teaching than Draco in this chapter, but, uh... have some Lacey?
Draco glanced at him, trying to see if this had been Neville’s angle all along, to wait him out.
Draco slipped into his pajama shirt and did up the buttons. Slowly, because his foolish fingers were trembling. He starved one thought, and then another. There was no reason for his fingers to tremble. He didn’t even know what emotion was causing this. Anger? Fear? There was no reason to feel disappointed that Ron had gone  to talk with Potter when he ran out of the room and not stayed to help Malfoy figure out what the hell had just happened. He didn’t want to talk to Weasley about it, anyway.
"Oh this?" the girl looked down at her white dress. "This is just what I was buried in. I didn't have time to pick out anything more appropriate for the occasion."
Pansy and Granger weren’t just exchanging looks, they were leaning across the table to whisper to each other. He stood up. If they wanted to have a private conversation so badly, he could facilitate that. He had studying to do.
Draco traced one tine of his fork through his mashed potatoes. This was the exact conclusion he’d come to. After all the classes they’d taught together and laughing next to each other on broomsticks and touching knees on the damn train, Potter had decided that he didn’t want to hurt Draco. He didn’t want to laugh or goad. He just wanted to explain away Draco’s feelings so he didn’t have to face them.
"Wait!" Fred shouted as Draco strode out the door. "Don't get yourself--"
Draco had been unable to open his eyes. All of the thoughts he’d been scrambling to hide were about Potter.
Pansy’s concern would have disappeared from his mind if it hadn’t been from a letter from his mother later that week.
Draco raised an eyebrow. "This was your idea, Harry. It's purely
There was a shocked silence, and McGonagall leaned back in her seat, looking pleased. "If you'd like to respond now, gentlemen, feel free."
From inside the shop, though, he did have a good view of Harry, shaking hands and striking poses, lifting up little kids to reach the shining baubles on the Christmas tree. Draco tried not to look over too often. He had other things to think about. It was undoubtedly their busiest day of the year. He still got a few looks of disgust or hard elbows from customers, but that didn't stop their money from changing hands. It was impossible to stop for long enough to get a sense of their daily total, but Draco had a feeling that the goblins just might be satisfied with what they had to offer.
As he fell into the rhythm of school, Draco recovered some of his confidence in the classroom, if nowhere else. No Quidditch or orders to sneak Death Eaters into his school left Draco with only the endless loop of his own mind and his textbooks, and he preferred his textbooks.
Draco was right. His words lit up seven kinds of fears and defenses within Harry, but it was what Draco could offer. Had offered. Real. Draco was misty and smeared through Harry's vision, but there was no mistaking the rage.
"Angel, second class," she smiled.
The Headmistress raised one eyebrow. "Professor Slughorn said all your recent work was up to scratch."
“I try. Sometimes it lands.”
“What about the other professors? What did the headmaster say?”
“I knew they shouldn’t have let him play professor. All that power is going to his head. He’s obviously got favorites.”
Potter was in the bedroom when Draco returned after dinner, looking at the pages of a large book. His messy curls were more scattered than usual, and he had a long line of ink on his cheek. Draco watched for a moment before he said anything, and Potter’s head nodded, heavy with sleep.
Draco’s eyes moved slowly, drawn like magnets back to Potter’s face, and not for the first time he realized that he was probably staring at one of the most powerful wizards to ever live. Only this time, his power was--funneling through the students he taught? “Merlin’s--Merlin’s tits, Potter. Do other people know about this?”
And even though it would definitely create a scene, Draco  pressed his lips together, "I suppose you can do that."
When Potter had figured out where he was and who was speaking to him, he blinked up. His eyes looked different without his glasses, and not just because he was squinting. “What’s getting worse?”
There was a moment of even more startled silence before Ron, and then Pansy, and then Hermione started laughing, too.
Potter gaped and turned to watch Draco go. He could feel the four-eyed stare on him all the way out the door, as he grabbed Pansy’s elbow and dragged her out of sight.
"Now, Potter?" Draco breathed, and Harry could hear the disbelief matched by impatience.
Potter spoke up before he could manage anything. “What? That’s not fair, Ginny! I invited him. He should get to be on my team.
“How long have you been staring at that page?”
"Very funny," he muttered. "Of all the dark artifacts I thought I'd find back here--"
Potter snorted. “I couldn't learn it from Snape, I don’t know why I thought I’d be able to learn this way.”
Draco shrugged. The first years were not his concern.
Desperately, he dug into his bag, dropped a random handful of coins on the counter, and started striding toward the door. He tried to keep his chin up, but his head was tipped forward by some cruel trick of gravity.
“Because. I need your help.”
He was startled from his thoughts by a splash in the water, and he leaned over even farther to try to see through the flying snow and swirling water. A head broke the surface, and he heard the shouting over the sounds of the water. "Help!" a voice was shouting. "Someone help!"
“Uhm--the first time I flew on a broom, I s’pose,” Harry answered. “What’s the biggest sporting event you’ve ever been to?”
But they should be confident about this, because they had been making good sales all month, and were keeping them in a well-jinxed safe, and tomorrow they would be able to make at least a really sizable payment, if not every penny they owed.
“Well, the book probably isn’t shouting at you.”
His own hesitations aside, there was no way they actually wanted him around at their holidays. However many Weasleys there were, there was one less because of the war. He wasn’t the right person to fill that vacancy.
"Speaking of the life ahead of you, do you want to return to any of our previous conversations? A few weeks ago, you were thinking a lot about what would come when you were finished with school."
"You can't expect me not to do anything," Draco's voice was tight. He was holding back. All this rage and he was still holding back.
That night, the boys got ready for bed in an exceptionally awkward silence. Draco took his clothes to the bathroom to change. He knew it was odd. Or juvenile. Or something. But the scars—he didn’t want people staring at the scars on his chest. Especially Potter.
So Draco gave Teddy a piggy-back ride to bed and read one (and then one more, and then just one more) picture book to Teddy.
With that, Neville pulled a stack of books out of his bag and settled onto his bed to get some work done. Draco watched with a sense of horror. He opened an inkwell there on his bedspread and settled in with his back against the headboard.
“Is that all it takes to get you to go away?” Draco asked.
With that, Potter was standing in the wide open room of Draco’s mind, this time with far more purpose. He strode over to the bookshelf. “When I look into Mr. Malfoy’s mind, I don’t get a rush of different memories or emotions. It looks like a study, or a library, and all his thoughts are neatly put away.”
“Were you just going to pat me on that back?” Harry was on the edge of laughter. Draco was glad he didn’t sound hopeless and lost at the moment, but not so glad that Harry was laughing at him.
Hermione managed the spell, but before either Ron or Pansy could move to send another patronus to Harry or the nurse, four of the first-years had their Patronuses pelting down the stairs. Sam was staring at the end of their wand, furious. “How come mine isn’t working?"
“I asked what McGonagall said when you talked to her.”
There was scattered laughter, but Draco couldn’t join in. He wanted recognition, but for things that he’d actually done. This had been a fluke, and they were all lucky to have survived.
“I think so,” Granger replied. “Although we’d have to get them to agree that the previous rulings were unfair and ridiculous, which about eighty percent of wizarding law and justice is.”
Harry realized that he'd been quietly panicking since the moment that he realized it was Draco's birthday, and finally he was starting to settle. Finally.
*** *** ***
"That's okay." Claire pressed her finger to one of the bricks at random. It wasn't even one of the bricks that was supposed to trigger the magic. "I can get us in."
“The nightmares all the time, jumping at every sound. Staying up late and scribbling on your papers. Never being around the common room or spending time with Weasley and Granger.”
Pansy grinned. "Does that mean that you--"
Harry must have looked stricken. His face must have been doing a thing, because Draco stumbled over his words.
Regardless, enjoy the sugar quills, share with your friends, and we look forward to hearing from you again soon
"Can," Draco said. "Several other people must have done it before us. Those bones look really old."
But then Draco was already in the room when Harry barged through the door.
"How can you test for potions?" Draco pressed them.
There was a lot of shouting and back pounding and excitement, and then a whistle blew, and everyone turned to watch the teams kick off.
“Okay, back to the list,” Hermione frowned. Even starry-eyed with drinks and veritaserum, Hermione was focused on whatever she’d just chosen as her goal.
Pansy.” The bite was back in his voice, and this time he felt like he needed it. He wasn’t sure how to explain the situation in his own mind, much less share it out loud. But it would be one part the fear of Potter learning things he shouldn’t know, one part the tension of second-guessing everything he said and did, one part a longing for a future when it wouldn’t be like this and one part the inability to imagine such a future.
"I'm going down there," Draco had replied, already untying his apron with sharp motions. "This is a job for a snake." He didn't know exactly what he'd do, but there had to be some combination of knowledge and words that would frighten Lockhart out of this.
Draco focused on the heading of his document, and before too long, he heard Potter’s footsteps retreating. He knew Potter had to pretend that he wanted Draco there. He wasn’t fooled.
Draco looked up at the bartender. "Look, she's lost her marbles, and I'm beginning to think I'm losing mine too. We've got to see Harry Potter. He'll vouch for me. Can you just let us through?"
Flurries of snow blew past the windows of the Defense classroom, obscuring any view of the grounds. Draco pouted in their direction. For the day before the Winter Holidays, Potter had placed a series of curses on packages and given them to the whole class to open. He’d done the same thing for the first years and Draco had been there to make sure kids got unjinxed whenever they missed a spell. But the 8th year Defense class had moved on to some pretty complicated curse and jinx breaking, but he couldn’t seem to do anything correctly. Draco had managed to get his nose jinxed green unwrapping the first package, and Ron had quipped that he looked very festive.
“Feeling honest,” Potter grinned, tilting his cup.
Harry looked at the others. They were the ones who'd actually remembered Draco's birthday and made sure there was something special about it. Hermione had even managed to clue Harry in. They were better friends to Draco than Harry was, but right now Harry wanted nothing more than to get Draco away from them so he could try to make things right.
“Yes, very well, Weasley. I’ll take care of that when I come to it.”
She couldn't seem to figure out what to say, so Harry plowed on. "Do you know the story of the Deathly Hallows? You're not from a magical family, are you? It's one of the stories that some Wizarding kids grow up with, but it's not something they touch on at Hogwarts."
"It's magic. He can speak."
“You were calling for him,” Neville said gently.
At least, that’s what it looked like to Potter.
She looked down the table and smirked triumphantly. “He keeps looking down here with this panic on his face. As if he thinks we’re talking about him.”
Draco winced, then tried to cover it. First of all, who owned up to living in a Burrow? Second, he was learning to tolerate one ginger hanging around at all times, but hanging around eight? Nine? How many Weasleys were there, anyway? He’d snap.
Draco’s irritation fizzled and faded, and Harry took a few steps toward the chair where he was sitting. “You asked about Lacey?”
Draco followed her, and she turned sharply. “Oh,” he said, memory rising in him like a wave of nausea. “This used to be Nocturn Alley.”
Draco raised one eyebrow in an attempt to keep looking cool and aloof. "I actually quite want to know what my birthday present is before I make any more decisions about tonight."
Neville had been correct, however, at guessing the stage the party would be in. Seamus and Dean were making out in the corner, and some of the eighth years had snuck off to more secluded locations for similar activities. Most of the others were flopped on the couches or the floor, swigging what was left in their cups.
Sam nodded, eyes overflowing now with tears.
“Then do you know where all the Galleons I’ve misplaced are?”
“I don’t mean the message, Draco. I mean, doesn’t it seem like a bit much for you to go to all this work to make buttons about how much you “hate” Potter?”
“Twenty galleons? That’s twice the price of…”
A shiver ran over her body. She spasmed, and all her edges faded. “Wh-what’s happening?” she sobbed.
Andromeda looked up from where she was taping up a last package for under the Christmas tree. "Draco. Don't keep Teddy up late. She's going to want to stay up late tomorrow. Read her a story in bed."
Potter shifted. Glanced at the crowd of Weasleys now listening to their argument. “I just thought you wanted--”
Now, as much of an irritation as the party planning was, he knew it was a sign the Fred and George trusted him to do it right. They would find out tomorrow if the trust was merited, but he didn’t have time to stop and worry about that. From the moment the shop opened, he had a thousand things to do. He straightened the garland and corralled the roving mistletoe into the corner. He fed the pygmy puffs and re-arranged the daydream collection, again. People never could seem to keep their hands to themselves when it came to those products.
“I don’t even know if I’m allowed to use that wand,” Draco growled. “I’m registered with this one. They’re keeping track of every spell I do.” Explaining this to Potter rankled.
It wouldn’t be weird now, to put a hand on Harry’s shoulder and say that everything would be okay. At least, it would be significantly less weird than twining the same hand through Harry’s hair and trying to console him that way.
Angry now, Draco splashed water on his face and prepared to return to the dorm. Those imaginary games had felt low-stakes before, but now, with both of them living in the same room, Potter might actually see, might actually have something to say.
He looked back to the twins. George snapped his mouth shut, and a candy bounced off his nose. Fred slid from the counter, adopting his easy smile. "What can I help you gentlepersons with? Looking for some stocking-stuffers for the little ones? Or have you got a security--"
“Who’s the most famous wizard you’ve ever met?”
It didn’t make any difference. Even after Draco followed Harry to their room and crawled into bed, his nerves were far too electrified for sleep.
Draco glanced at the list of tester questions and back to Potter. The questions were innocuous enough, as long as they stuck to them. As long as Potter didn’t try to get fancy.
“McGonagall says it’s Lacey’s choice. But she’s twelve. She’s twelve years old and she almost ripped herself into pieces today. I know I can’t save everyone.” Harry’s voice sounded like a bruise. “But isn’t there anything we can do to protect anyone?"
More points were exchanged, but Ginny was keeping them in the lead. He hummed a few lines of Weasley is Our King to himself. He should make a verse for Ginny. When she went professional it would sweep the nation. They’d sing it at the World Cup one day.
“Honestly, Potter.” His voice sounded false, but there was nothing for it, he had to keep plowing through this. “This is what you get for always listening to your fan club.” Close the book. Gather up the notes. No stopping now. “And first years. They thought I was a death eater a week ago, and now they think, what? That I’m in love with you?” His voice was getting stronger. It was magic. “Of course that makes more sense than the idea that anyone wouldn’t adore the boy savior. What a joke. I’m going somewhere peaceful where I can actually get some studying done.”
When they’d gathered their books, Pansy led the way up front to pay. “That’ll be twenty galleons,” the checker stated, staring Pansy dead in the eyes.
“You’re the one teaching the first years Occlumency.”
Tom chuckled. "Sure. I bet Harry Potter's been waiting all evening for you."
It wasn’t as terrifying, at the moment, to look at Harry’s face. Less frightening than looking at the door they were supposed to walk through. He was wearing an expression Draco had become familiar with over the years. Although what Potter expression hadn’t he memorized?
"Don't. Please don’t say you want to end this." he heard himself saying. It sounded so stupid. Why was he begging Draco Malfoy to keep this alive when he was only making Draco miserable?
Potter knocked his glasses up on his forehead and scrubbed at his eyes. “I don’t want them to know. They’ve spent the past seven years looking after me. Hermione wiped her parents’ memory so she could go searching for the horcruxes with me without getting them involved. They’re happy. And they deserve it.”
The next morning felt surreal, especially sitting in the potion classroom. The spell damage that had happened in the room had been repaired, the informational posters that the Carrows hung removed. Draco traced his finger along the grainy surface of his desk. Pansy, to his left, readied her quills and book. She looked busier with the task than she actually was.
"Seems only fair, since Ron and I got you six years ago."
She started arranging her breakfast plate while Draco studied the little bottle. If this was all an elaborate plot to get Draco to take veritaserum and get him on the stand or drug him and smuggle him off to some undisclosed location, she had done a very thorough job of earning his trust. Draco downed the potion and waited to see if he could feel the effects. Well, it seemed like his heart was beating faster, so there was that.
Draco allowed the smug look to overtake his face. There. Duty done, he’d told the other members of the Golden Trio, and they could handle it from here. He took a large spoonful of potatoes.
“It’s Lacey. She’s got bad thoughts, and we’re trying to help, but something really weird is happening.”
He chanced a glance up to see where Potter was. How had he--Harry had already nosed up to be nearly side-by-side with Draco. Draco inched foreward a bit more. This wasn’t his broom, but he thought he’d gotten used to it during practices. He thought he’d pushed himself during practices, but he could feel the difference now. The snitch hovered feet away from them, and he reached out one arm, pleading
Potter entered. Oh joy. The part where he had to endure consequences for opening his mouth.
"Of course they are. What did you think had happened to them? Are you going to keep running all over town or are you going to get in there?”
“First question, Potter. What’s your fondest childhood memory?”
This was bad. This made it even more important to not get out of bed and face Potter at the moment. Only--he brushed the curtains out of his way and squinted through the darkness. Neville was holding weak wandlight in front of himself and feeling his way across the room.
As the day wore on and Potter was still pointedly avoiding Draco’s gaze at all times, it started to get irritating. During lunch, Pansy sat across the table from him, isolated as they always were from the rest of the class. “Are you going to tell me what happened or do I have to base my opinions off the gossip?”
Harry was looking over Ron’s head at the Slytherin table. “Huh?” Hermione followed his gaze. He was staring at Malfoy, who was showing off some new feature of his Potter Stinks badge to the table.
She liked to say things like, “We just have to make it through this year,” to which Draco had replied, “And then another year, and another. It’s not going to get easier when we’re out of school.” He’d only said it aloud once because of the sadness that had settled onto her face. But the thought weighed heavy on his mind. After this year he was supposed to have some of the restrictions on his magic released. If he was on good behavior. But he’d have to look for some kind of job, and the chances that someone would hire a Death Eater who had to have his wand babysat at all times were slim.
Draco clutched his wand. O-kay. This might need a delicate touch. She looked like she was fifteen or sixteen year old, but maybe she was a witch who'd magic had gone unnoticed and undeveloped, and that could make her dangerous. "So you're an angel, Claire? Do you have--special powers?"
There was silence for so long Draco thought it would snap.
“They’re so--Malfoy, I am sorry. I was sorry as soon as I saw what the spell did. I never meant to hurt you this badly."
Draco’s eyes narrowed at Pansy’s ongoing joke.
“You’re an Occlumens."
"Just curious, hmm. I'll race you to the room. If I get there first, you have to share whatever sugary treats your mom sent you today."
Ha. Who needed Potter’s friends? “No offense, but isn’t it a bit late to be cramming Occlumency? The Dark--Vol--You Know Who is dead, so what’s the hurry?”
Draco accepted the wand. He couldn’t keep denying himself all the things that he wanted. Not when they were so close. His hand closed around the end and he felt warmth. Maybe it was because Potter had been clutching it, or maybe it was because his wand was meant to be with him, and it felt right in his hand.
Oh Merlin, this is what Hermione meant about not saying terrible things. He muttered an apology that seemed to pass, because Ron led them to the telephone booth, demonstrated the phone number, and whisked himself into the ministry. Draco did not say anything about how he’d been to the Ministry dozens of times with his father and knew how to get in just fine, thank you. No Malfoy had been in the building outside of their own trials since the end of the war. He couldn’t know what kind of security precautions they’d put in place against people like him.
"So weird," Draco agreed. "Do you want to see if we can fool our friends in the Great Hall?
Draco and Harry exchanged a look as they sat. That didn't seem like a good start.
Draco stood and took a few steps up the bank, but nearly lost his balance and had to grab onto a rather thorny plant to keep from falling back. "And you didn't think to come up and talk to me? We'd be a lot drier."
Hermione spoke then, firm and finished. “There’s room for everyone at the Burrow. I promise.”
Draco almost never looked right at Harry when he first came into the joke shop. And when he came to visit the home, he was usually busy talking with the kids instead of looking at Harry's face. He didn't have much to compare this moment to. The warmth that flooded his face and the way his eyes came alight. "Draco."
Draco slouched past him, scowling. "Stop being so particular and leave my stuff alone."
“It is,” Pansy gasped. “You grimaced when Hermione guessed it.”
“I just think it’s a bit of a waste paying for a Defense book when you could've written the whole thing yourself.”
Draco shrugged. He wanted to talk this through with Pansy from every angle, but he knew better. Those were thoughts to starve, not feed. “What’s with the sudden interest?
"Harry," Draco snapped, dropping a handful of broken teacup bits into the bin. "I can't believe I even came here. I am still trying so hard, and you're not giving me anything back."
Hagrid looked from Ron to Hermione in a manner that made Hermione very sure they’d been discussing her. “I was looking for you,” she frowned.
Harry grinned. There were good players on the team this year, and without having to worry about the drama of whether or not Harry would be able to complete a match, they were a lot more consistent. "I think they're going to destroy Slytherin,"
Potter reached over and put his glasses on. “I didn’t know I had an audience.” And even though Potter was the one who should feel self-conscious because he was the one unraveling, Draco could tell he was starting to blush. Good thing it was dark.
“Deep breaths, Draco.”
"Freckles are in today, hmm?" Draco asked.
Harry grinned. There was something really excellent about the fact that Draco hadn't gotten distracted by getting a job or Harry's decision. He wanted to know that Lacey was safe. Harry had no idea what they were going to do with a twelve-year-old at Hogwarts all summer, but they could figure that out together.
“Thank you,” he whispered.
“Huh?” Draco realized that Neville and Weasley were laughing their way out the door and it was just Potter and himself.
Draco noticed that Fred didn't say anything.
“Just wanted to rub it in that I can’t cast a Patronus for shit.”
She was transforming. Draco swore, and Sam caught it.
"Except that you're supposed to teach a lesson on Occlumency," Draco pointed out. "So the fact that you don't have much of a grasp on Occlumency or Legilimency could be problem."
"Oh Harry," Hermione looked pleased. A little too pleased. Her eyes were wide, a smile stretched across her face. "You made it for dinner. Draco was worried he wasn't going to see anything of you
Before he was out of earshot, he heard Potter tell McGonagall. “I’ll be waiting in your office. I need to know how we’re going to be sure that Lacey’s safe from now on.”
Draco found himself face-to-face with Ginny, who clapped him on the back, causing him to wince. “That was good flying. If somebody hadn’t smashed into you like a complete oaf, we really would have had it.”
Hermione nodded, not paying Ron much attention anymore. She’d opened the parcel and was skimming a long roll of parchment. “Mmm, well it’s easier to discuss the case if I’m sitting with them.”
Draco hesitated. “At the latest.” He swallowed, fighting the strange weightlessness he felt at the moment, and turned to look back at Potter.
Draco had poked his head out of the back room and said, "Fred and George will be in at eight if you want to come back and whinge then."
"The joke shop is gone too," Claire whispered.
"And it's not even Alana's fault. But she. pukes. everywhere. I have taken her to healers four times to see if there's something wrong, and they said this is normal. How is this normal?"
Hermione set down her muffin, feeling the bite she’d taken turn to stone in her stomach. This again. Why was it so hard for Ron to imagine that anyone could want to take Hermione to a dance?
Draco hadn’t been staring. Just supervising. That was it.
"I've been offered a position on staff at Hogwarts," Draco affirmed, pausing to drag out the suspense. So much for him not wanting to make the announcement. "As the Professor of Potions."
Sam raised a hand. "Most potions wear off after a while. That's what Madame Pomfrey told me. If you don't have daily or even hourly access to the potion you're taking, it won't last."
With the trial over and the prospect of using his old wand for NEWTs, Draco decided to throw himself into studying, a pastime which Hermione approved of greatly and Ron and Pansy had no patience for.
There were, in fact, two Aurors standing in the corner, sipping from cups of cocoa. Draco took a steadying breath and stepped toward them. "I'm ready to go with you," he said. "I don't want to make a scene in front of the kids."
Draco felt like a hornet’s nest that had lived long-dormant in his stomach was being poked by Potter’s words. He tried to let the words slide off him. “I’m not a stray puppy, Potter. I don’t need your charity.”
Draco was feeling distinctly like he should have left the moment the trio had been reunited, but now it would be weird to leave.
Harry’s green-gold eyes were on him, waiting for Draco to say something in response, but this was more than Draco could take. Magic he might be able to learn, but some things were just out of his reach.
He still felt a sick gnawing in his gut, but at least she was saying that Potter was nearby. Whatever was going on, Potter would set it right.
Then let his hand twine through the black curls that he’d been watching for so many years.
"I've just got to get this girl to Harry Potter, and then I'll..." he trailed off. What would he do when he got Claire the help she needed. "I'll face the consequences of  my actions."
"What's going on?" Fred asked, looking from Draco to Potter. "You two conducting secret meetings behind our backs?"
Draco offered some sort of strangled excuse and exited the room with haste.
“Right,” Draco recited. “Teaching all the first years how to cast Patronuses. Teaching the eighth years Auror level defensive and anti-jinx spells. Teaching first years Occlumency.”
Draco managed to get the drawer open, looked inside, and closed it again very quickly.
Claire nodded solemnly. "Don't tell Harry you like him. I don't think he'd listen to me if I did. If he hasn't figured it out from how you behave, he's not going to listen to a child."
There were people in the classroom who would have been mocking Draco if they said that, but not Neville. He really wanted to see.
"You get away from us, And don't show your face around here again," Andromeda shouted, slamming the door.
Draco looked back at the kids. Some of the younger ones hadn't understood what Lockhart was saying, but Jamie looked ready to run after Lockhart and fight. Zoe was clenching the head of her bouquet in two fists.
Andromeda approached and brushed the snowflakes off Draco’s shoulders and head. "Let go of Teddy. You're squeezing him to death."
*** *** ***
Draco had nightmares too. How could he not? How could anyone who lived through all of that not be hit by it from time to time?  Night or day. Conscious or unconscious. But Draco woke up from those dreams like a coiled spring with a vice grip on his blankets. Quiet and breathless until he could force the air back in and out of his lungs.
"Which one of us has seen into their brains? Devon Hariot can't stand you, but to most of the kids in your classes, you're not just the wizard that saved the world from Voldemort, you're the one who teaches them how to protect themselves and take care of their friends."
"Hel--!" The voice was cut off when the head in the water caught a wave to the face. Nothing for it. Draco squeezed his eyes shut and pushed away from the bridge.
Hah. That would go over well with the Ministry. Why doesn’t the Malfoy boy want to Defend Against the Dark Arts? Could it be because he’s still trying to fight for them? No. That wouldn’t do.
"And you think it would make any of it better if you died tonight?" she said. Her voice was softer now, less over-bright and aggressive, and it hit all the harder.
“Professor,” Weasley said, “They saved the day. They all deserve house points.”
Harry finally snapped out of his daze. “Hermione, it’s possible. We have to consider--”
impressive. It's about
Draco leaned against the wall, striking a pose that he hoped looked casual.
That sounded impossible. Harry opened his mouth, forced his mouth to move. "That sounds impossible."
It was unnerving to watch Neville deftly flicking the package this and that way to make sure it was clear. The fact that it was nearly the winter holidays and Draco hadn’t managed to cast a patronus, which apparently all the first years could do, was always somewhere in the back of his well organized mind.
“Well, this is a pretty simple potion, isn’t it?” he asked, deftly stirring the bubotuber pus and lacewing flies in the bottom of the cauldron. “Dice that boomslang skin, would you?”
There was an awkward silence as Draco watched Hermione exit and tried to wrestle his thoughts away from what would happen if Potter and he did get locked in a closet. Maybe he should pretend not to be talking to--
Draco poked at his eggs. He’d remembered very little of the wording, but he had remembered the threat of Azkaban, which weighed on the tip of his wand every time he held it.
“They want us to live in there?”
A First-year in Gryffindor robes skidded into the entrance, looked up, and darted toward Draco, grabbing him by the sleeve. “Professor Malfoy! Professor Malfoy you have to help!” Draco looked down at the figure in the robe.
Clutching his wand in one hand, he waded in.
“How can you work like that?”
Pansy, while she looked considerably better-rested than Draco, had copied her appearance for the day they’d gone to get their school supplies before the term. Her hair was loose and unspelled, her face bare, and her robes common. When they reached the apparition point, Draco reached out and gave Pansy’s hand a quick squeeze. For all her optimism and scheming with Granger behind his back, she was just as anxious as he was.
Silence fell again, as Ron shoveled potatoes into his mouth.
"We're going to be late if we don't leave for the Defense class now," Harry added.
He skidded onto the block, glancing over his shoulder once to see the ministry official still shuffling behind him. Draco wasn't sure why the man hadn't drawn his wand and stunned Draco already, but he was grateful. Just another twenty feet--Draco grabbed the ledge of Potter's picture window, and his heart nearly burst.
Potter was in the middle of pulling off his shirt, and Draco lay back again quickly to protect his thoughts. “Uh, I always thought I’d be an auror, so I could help put away dark wizards.”
"Yep," Harry grinned, rolling his sleeves up. Why did Draco have such long arms? "The good news is that neither of us intended you any harm. But you can see just how easy it is to miss, even with people you see every day."
(See the end of the chapter for
"There. Draco Malfoy, you have never existed."
They strode into the Great Hall, and silence dropped like a curtain, but only for a moment. Then, a swarm of first-years was jumping over their seats and crowding the new pair.
That little outburst got Potter to look over his way, but only for a second, taking in him and the wand, and then turning back to Finnegan.
"That's not--I mean that is important, of course it is. George and Fred are important to me. But I couldn't do this without you. I don't know if you understand that."
The only exception to settling into their same seats was Potter. Instead of taking one of the seats, he lounged on a stool in the front of the room.
Draco always drew the curtains tight around his bed and spelled them so no one could hear any sounds he made in his sleep, but it had never struck him as safe to have a spell that keep any outside noises from getting in. What if there was an emergency?
“Me either.”
“Because Johnson and Puri were the last to get it, and they were finally able to cast.”
“For many years
"When Fred..."
Draco didn't protest when Harry dragged him into the Gryffindor cheering section, even if he did glance around with an irritated expression at some of the banners. Hermione spotted them coming and jumped up, waving her hand. "Oh, Harry, Draco. You made it!"
“Up late marking the eighth years’ essays.” Draco finished. “You’d have less grading to do if you didn’t assign us so much work.” Harry looked at him. “The longer you let it sit, the more likely we’re going to fail the potion, Potter.”
“Every year, Draco.”
“Malfoy!” the feet hurried toward him, and then Potter dropped to his knees. “Malfoy, are you okay?”
He raised an eyebrow at her. Luna and the quidditch players surrounding Ginny looked thoroughly annoyed that he was taking her away. As soon as they'd gotten out of earshot of Ginny's friends, he muttered. "I'm sorry, it's just--Draco."
“I’m not going to walk in there by myself after everyone saw me hanging back with you. They’ll think I’ve murdered you already.” He didn’t ask Potter if he was scared. He didn’t need to.
But he wasn’t completely free from distractions. In the corner across the room, Potter was running one hand through his hair and absently dripping ink on his opposite sleeve. Probably marking the first year’s papers. Draco snorted and trained his eyes back on his own book. Not only had Saint Potter been awarded the job of preparing the eighth year students for their NEWTs, but he’d also been entrusted with the education of the first year students. Other staff members had picked up other classes. Slughorn was working with the second years, McGonagall with the third years, and so on.
“Time is of the essence, Miss Granger,” Dumbledore said seriously. He quickly set pen to parchment and scrawled a note, passing it to Hermione as he stood. “This should allow you to access the restricted book and find the reversal spell. I’m going to speak to a few of the faculty and see about Professor Moody. I hope to see you all well and returned to yourselves tomorrow. And Mister Malfoy, Mister Potter?”
Claire interrupted by pointing upward. "It says magical exterminators on the sign."
"Wait, Draco!" Harry said. "And you, Dawes. Thompson. You've got to wait. They're coming.” Harry caught sight of something out the window and ran to the door, flinging it wide open. "Come on in!"
After the war
Draco blinked, and the storm in his eyes was gone. "So you're not going to take it? I don't want to scare you away from the school. I don't actually want to fight you for the job. Not that I could win, if you wanted it"
Harry resisted the urge to push Draco on this point. He knew the exact moment that he had started liking Draco Malfoy: it had been the beginning of eighth year, and Draco and Neville had walked into the room when everyone else was winding down from their party. Draco had been more rumpled and sleepy than usual, and when someone handed him a glass, he didn't drink any of it. Harry had looked over at him and realized that after all the disgust and anger he'd held for Draco, after all the fear and pity he'd felt when Draco turned out out be a little bit useful and not-entirely-evil during the war, this was what was left. Ever-so-slightly rumpled Draco sitting with Pansy and Hermione on the couch, glowing in the firelight and looking like he was in the midst of a game and hadn't figured out the rules. And Harry had thought: Things could be different now. I want them to be different with him.
The barbed thoughts started. How would Draco make the world better? Rid it of one ex-Death Eater? Everything he touched turned to rust. He’d just have to stay far away from any improvement efforts.
“You’d be surprised.”
“Professor,” piped up one of the Slytherins. “We found her in the hallway, and she was hitting her head again, talking to herself. We stopped and tried to tell her it was just a thought.”
Draco shoved his hands into his pant's pockets, feeling for his identification, or his pay stub from the Weasleys, or--
“Avery Johnson.”
Harry writhed in his chair, and Draco found he couldn’t look away. Harry wasn’t just uncomfortable, he was approaching miserable. “I thought I finally had a reason to believe that Malfoy liked me...back.”
Draco starved a thought. He could dislike Ginny Weasley because she was pushy and had beaten him at Quidditch, but he wasn’t allowed to feel jealous of her. So, no wishing that Potter’s face lit up like that when he walked into a room. No hating her name for sounding sweet in his mouth. None of that.
It was too late, because Harry had just thrown his arms around Draco and pulled him close. "Are you being serious? Can I kiss you?"
Well. There was only one term left. He could hide from Potter for the next five and a half months, and then they’d never have to see each other again. It was the only way forward.
Moments later Draco was checking his cuffs for soot while Pansy eyed the patrons of The Leaky Cauldron. She’d always been the one to confront the stares head-on, while Draco tried to look past everyone in the establishment without lowering his gaze.
The game was a dream. Luna's hilarious commentary had Ron in fits of laughter the whole time, and Ginny was playing chaser, scoring goal after goal on the Slytherin keeper. Draco taught their little cheering section the new song he'd made for Ginny and they listened as the song spread farther each time Ginny scored another goal.
“Um. Take me to her.”
Potter looked ready to ignite, but he kept his voice low and level. “I think we should take Lacey to see Madame Pomfrey. And then I would like to discuss,” he cut himself off and continued in an even lower voice. “I’d like to discuss what caused this to happen.”
"It was a good letter," Draco said slowly, wandering past Harry and trying to open one of the drawers. "It helps to know what you're thinking. I'd say I can't read minds, but I sort of can. I just don't."
Sam put up an enormous fight at being separated from Lacey’s side, but McGonagall’s word still held more power that Draco’s, and Sam was dragged off to the Gryffindor tower, protesting loudly. McGonagall’s eyes slid to Potter. “That one reminds me of someone.”
“Sudden? Draco, you know I’m terribly interested in everything that has to do with the two of you.”
He snorted into his tea. “Why would you do that?”
Potter ignored him throughout dinner and the apparently yearly tradition of listening to Celestina Warbeck’s Christmas special. Fleur complained about the radio program, but it gave Draco an ache in his chest. His mother loved Celestina Warbeck, too. Hermione still passed him a cider and Ron still offered him a pudding. Draco figured that whatever was going on between Potter and himself, they were staying out of it.
Draco gave the girl a second look. Her dress looked clean and new, and her shoes were expensive. If she was lost, or a runaway, it had happened recently. Some poor non-magic family was probably searching frantically for the girl. He cleared his throat. "Is there--what's your name? We should get you back to your family."
"That was a little on the cryptic side," she laughed. "You seem to think about things as what you
"I will never be able to read the story of the Deathly Hallows the same way again. I'm sorry." she cleared her throat. "You chose to keep the cloak. And in the story, that lets the youngest brother hide from death until he's ready to go. It's a good ending."
The bell over the door rang, and Draco glanced up to see several well-dressed goblins making their way inside.
“Fancies you,” Hermione finished, slowly and deliberately. “Which he finally decided he could tell Ron and me during the holidays.”
"Stop," Draco said, rubbing his forehead. "It's not wonderful. It's barely passable."
"They're talking about me," he said. "Not you."
Their eyes met in the mirror, and Potter abruptly ducked toward the door.
Draco read the stone, blinked, and read it again.
Draco steeled himself. It didn’t matter if Harry remembered him, even if Draco felt like he was bleeding from that wound. “Never mind. Forget that. You've been running the home for kids with Luna for years, and I thought that if anyone could help, you could."
"I didn't put a curse on your birthday present, Draco.."
Pansy’s post-war positivity about their classmates wasn’t very realistic. At dinner, the eighth years were shown to a table that sat just below the head table, running the breadth of the room. There weren’t enough students to fill the table, and there were two empty seats between where Pansy and Draco sat facing each other and the eighth year Ravenclaws. They weren’t even the only Slytherin eighth years, but Blaise and Pike and Bulstrode had somehow found seats among the others.
Malfoy nodded and a strangled, “Obviously,” made its way through his lips. “I need to go.” He added quickly, and spun on his heels to find an escape.
There was silence for a long moment. Harry turned off the lights and climbed back into his bed. “Malfoy. Why won’t you teach the eighth years Occlumency? They need it just as much as the first years. Maybe more.”
“Maybe I do. Maybe that’s what makes it worth it. That I can make everyone listen when it’s something like this.”
“What are you doing?” Potter asked, waving his hand at the desk.
Snape had not been a patient man by nature, and years in a job that he was ill suited or ill-prepared for had done nothing to improve his temperament, but he had always shown an extra dose of forbearance with Draco. When Draco had gone to him to learn to control his mind, Snape had been hesitant to teach a fourth year, but he’d seen the value. He’d understood why Draco would need the skills, even if Draco had never explained to him who he wanted to keep secrets from.
Everybody knows better than to ask the "What are you doing after graduation?" question. Come on, Harry.
Draco would rather drive his fork through his eyeball than listen to another song from the sorting hat, but it piped up in its cheery little voice all the same.
Harry gave Draco a good head start before he found Ginny's dot on the map and tracked her down. She was sitting in the sun on the bank of the lake surrounded by friends. All of their faces were angled toward her, watching her gesture wildly as she finished her story. "Um, Gin?" he said. "Can I get a word?"
Most of the goblins turned to shuffle back out the door, but the head goblin took a moment to look Draco over, his lip curling. "You'd already be able to pay the difference if you'd do the smart thing and take out the trash. You bring the galleons to the bank tomorrow when you close, or the shop will be ours before the new year. Lockhart's offering us the whole cost up front so he can open a bookstore." With that, the goblin lurched out.
"I told McGonagall that there would be jobs for me when I wanted them, and that I wanted to take a year off to catch up on my sleep," Harry grinned.
Whatever he was doing differently this time around, the Gryffindor class did not seem to be going well.
Harry's heart thundered as McGonagall turned on him. If she had offered Draco the job, his answer would have been easy.
"Draco. Sorry, I know you're swamped right now. Have you got a minute?"
Suddenly, Potter’s eyes narrowed, and he jumped from his seat, all energy.  “I’m pants at it! I would never be able to teach the first-years--but I bet someone who was really good at Occlumency could.”
“Alright, yes.” Point proven, Potter, no need to have a whole bloody trial.
“Perfect. But I hope you’re not planning on winning by keeping me from sleeping tonight.”
Harry laughed, and finally Draco started unwrapping the gift, untying the brown twine and peeling away the tape at the corners, unfolding the paper gingerly, and then turning over the framed canvas to see the picture that Harry had commissioned from Luna.
She seemed to know he was trying to help, because she didn't fight him off, and soon both of them broke the surface, where she gasped and spluttered. The river had carried them some distance from the bridge, and it was just going to go on carrying them through London unless they got out. Draco nodded toward the shore, the girl nodded grimly, and the two of them thrashed their way out of the current.
“But I wasn’t trying to hurt myself,” she argued. “I wasn’t trying to do anything.” They had reached the first floor landing and turned toward the Hospital Wing.
Draco’s mind was reeling. “You--” he looked at Granger. “He--”
There was laughter and shouting, a Christmas train that kept circling them and showering down bubbles. Teddy was deep in conversation with some of Harry's kids, and Andromeda was embracing Molly.
“I tried to hit you with the Cruciatus,” Draco dismissed.
“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” Potter muttered.
“Let Professor Malfoy through!” Sam shouted, and the crowd parted.
She shrugged. "Apparently not."
The game wrapped up, and after everybody had cheered and sang a last rousing chorus of "Weasley is our King," after Luna had left the announcing booth to run onto the field and ride a victory lap around the field with Ginny, after the Gryffindors had disappeared into the changing room and Harry's friends had joined the slow procession back up to the castle, Hermione turned to him.
There was a small, rushing panic in Harry's chest when she said that, the protests he wanted to make about how many people had lost their lives because of him, and how the world would have been better with them in it. But that didn't negate what Healer Goodnight was saying. He forced himself to nod.
She grinned. “I’m practicing happiness. I want to get better at it.”
When Draco had first come to work for them, he'd thought their childish antics would spell disaster for the store. But that wasn't it. They both worked hard. Yes, he had to come open the store in the morning, which was what came of being the only non-owner employee--but the two of them were often in the workroom until midnight brewing the next big thing.
"No. Aunt Andromeda, it's me. Draco. Lucius's son."
“I am sorry if Draco thought I meant he wasn’t doing a good enough job. He's much more fun to have around than I anticipated. Now, if you don't mind, I've got a story to finish, and you probably have some--I don't know, personal reflection to avoid?"
At the end of class, Potter asked him to stay after again. Draco cut Ron off with a glare before he could make any comments.
*** *** ***
"I'm fine," he snapped. "I just need to--this is all wrong. I'm going to find my family. I'm going to find my family and go to sleep, and when I wake up tomorrow everything's going to be okay."
Harry turned toward Hermione slowly, shocked. “You said something to make us fancy each other! Malfoy and me, that was your fault.”
There seemed to be some kind of gravity holding him in the room, but Draco fought it. He gathered his robes and walked back to the eighth year dorm, his mind cycling from Harry’s startled smile to the hunch of his shoulders and back again.
"Can you just tell Potter that Draco Malfoy is here? I've got a kid in trouble, and I need to talk to him."
He took a hurried step back under the guise of catching a whizzing woofer that had escaped from the child testing it. "Potter," he greeted.
He leaned back to give Draco a more appraising look down his nose. "Potter sent a panicked Patronus to the ministry. There weren't many of us left there by that point, but we've been scouring the streets looking for you."
Draco backed out of the door, heart pounding, but before Andromeda could slam it on him, he caught sight of a little boy standing behind her, and his stomach clenched. He'd never seen Teddy like this. Normally that wasn't a problem, because Teddy was never the same kid two days in a row, but this Teddy looked washed out. His hair wasn't brown or blonde, it was something halfway between. His skin looked too pale. No face sparkles.
Draco followed, eyes trained straight ahead. The other beds were taken, so he quickly maneuvered his chest to the bed closest to the door and began arranging his school supplies and books where they belonged. It didn’t take long, even by his precise demands. By the time he was done, Weasley and the other eighth year boys had entered the room and were looking at him with various degrees of suspicion.
“I’ve got the stirring under control now. You don’t have to keep supervising.”
It wasn't a total disaster of a class, Harry told himself, leaning heavily on the doorframe. Nothing caught fire, and nobody hexed anybody else. Still, as all the students burst out the door at the end of the class, Harry couldn't help but feel like a failure. Maybe one of his teachers had been a disguised Death Eater trying to kill him, but kids still hadn't been trying to skive off Barty Crouch Jr.'s class. Nobody fell asleep when Barty Crouch Jr. was teaching.
Harry ran his fingers through his hair, his signature move for when the kids were driving him crazy. Draco didn't know what he'd done to merit that.
"Dudley--that's the cousin--he was my year at school. He made sure that everyone at school saw me just the way he did. The way his parents taught him to see me. Like a little freak."
“Pansy is still sleeping off the last of the sleeping potion that I would have shared with you if you’d only asked,” Hermione sighed. “Merlin. We’re going to have to go with the whole haunted and misunderstood thing you did at your first set of trials.”
Guilt sparked in her eyes. “No. But Harry’s fine. He--.” She was silent for a moment, thinking. “You are right. He hasn’t been eating. He’s been stressed about the defense class, and--” she stopped short. “Other things. And we haven’t been paying attention.”
At least, he reasoned, he had kept the coat that looked good on him. It would only be this cold and miserable for a few more months. By this time next year, maybe he could afford something warmer.
"What are these supposed to be?" she frowned at the green frocks.
He took a long time getting a quill out of his bag, trying to steady his breathing.
"They said you stole nearly a thousand galleons from the Weasleys, but we knew that couldn't be right. They're right over there."
"Got it!" Harry panted, spotting the edge of the flag under his bed and pouncing. "Let's go."
And Potter was right. Even if it was hard to take him seriously with ink on his face. If they really wanted to defend against the dark--arts or otherwise--the only place to start was in their own minds.
"This is hardly dark, Potter. Honestly, I bet one of those Weasley boys left it here as a joke when they were still at school."

This was. Not what Draco had been expecting at breakfast. Besides, if Granger was trying to discover the limits of their power, why was she doing it with their full knowledge?
Draco pulled his coat around him as he walked back into the bitingly cold night. It was easy for the Weasleys to tell him not to worry. It was hard for him to listen. It might have been easier if he thought the goblins were the only ones who felt like getting rid of him would be taking out the trash.
"Maybe this year," Draco scoffed. "But next year I'm going to be on staff here, and I'm going to be sure that the Slytherin team knows how to play properly."
Potter sank into a chair. Since the common room was empty, he could have seated himself closer to the fire or at least sat across from Draco. Instead, he sat in the chair just next to him, so close that the arms of the chair were touching. So that if Harry put his arm down there, it would brush Draco’s.
Hermione waved away his concerns. “He has a soft spot for misunderstood creatures. You’ll do fine, as long as you don’t make any comments. Drink this."
"Those kids love you, Harry."
He took a few steps toward the door. He felt sick, but he was actually going to make his escape. “Oh, and Potter, tell your--” he stumbled over the word, “your m--muggleborn friend and the Weasel to stay the hell away from me.”
He slammed the loaner wand on the the wand on the desk, furious. Potter was helping everyone but him. It wasn’t as if he thought Potter’s help would make a big difference, but why wasn’t he worth the attention?
"You what? Ginny, we never--you never--I never--"
“I don’t know,” Ron said when they met in the entry hall before dinner. “They don’t look like they’ve been
"Of course I am." Most of the time Draco would be glad not to be recognized everywhere he went as a former Death Eater, but at this point he just wanted to get to Harry and end this terrible day. "Draco Malfoy. Don't you recognize me?" He felt his pocket for his wand, but couldn't find it at the moment. No matter, he had identification that always worked. He raised the sleeve on his left arm, fully prepared for everyone who was crowding around in the Leaky to gasp and recoil.
By half past ten, all of the kids were in a line just outside the door of the shop, and Draco handed each of them a bouquet. "I'm nervous," Holly whispered.
"I can't sit down and be still and try to think through this. It's too--" Harry waved his hands around in the air, still facing the cupboard. "It's too. And you wouldn't like my thoughts. I don't have things sorted out the way you do. You say one thing, and my mind goes off in seven different directions. I can't keep track of what I'm thinking or feeling, and it's a mess trying to share it with you."
Trembling, he tried to count out the Galleons and set them on the table, but all the money in his fist slipped onto the floor with a clatter.
Potter’s eyes had landed on him the moment he walked into the room next to Neville, and they hadn’t dipped away yet.
“I’m sure it’s not your fault, Potter. Your skill as a teacher will be legendary as soon as people figure out what you’ve done with the first years. Sometimes you just get a student who can’t learn.”
Draco looked out the window to make sure that it was still snowing. To make sure that no higher power had heard his inner plea and decided to interfere with Harry.
And how was she going to enforce that? He frowned, already trying to think of how he’d convince her it was something else. Something innocuous. A peacock, maybe. Or a snake.
"What are you trying to do here, Potter?" Draco asked.
“You look fine, Draco. Perfectly coiffed and everything.” Pansy leaned against the doorway with an irritated crease on her forehead. “If we’re doing this, let’s do it now.”
"George lost out to Lockhart," Claire corrected gently. "But I think it was a relief to him. It was really hard for him to run the joke shop when Fred was gone."
Hermione looked up over the cover of her book. “Pansy, it’s our last term at Hogwarts, and for once I don’t believe one of our professors is trying to kill us. You two both have use of your magic again, and Harry seems to be pulling out of his self-destructive nose dive. This is perhaps the only term at Hogwarts I have actually had uninterrupted time for my academics. I am going to study, thank you.”
She wasn’t supposed to leave him.
He stopped on the street abruptly and turned around. He must have been so lost in his thoughts that he walked right past the shop. There was Magical Me and Other Books, and Lockhart's Laughs, and Lockhart’s Ice Cream, which was mercifully not called Lockhart’s Licks.
The school year is coming to a close, but there are so many good things ahead for our favorite magic kids.
Harry was quiet. Draco could not bear to look at him. He should offer some sort of explanation. Or leave. He shouldn’t leave the burden of response on Potter.
Sam wiped a sleeve across their face, smearing tears and other fluids. “She’s outside the Common Room. She won’t go inside. We found her by herself.”
Draco had never talked with Potter at the same time as Ron and Hermione. When they cornered him in the Common Room, Potter with that same brain-fire light coming from his eyes, Draco looked for an escape. He even grabbed his wand. Not that they would hurt him, but his wand would be in hand. He might need to disappear.
“--hear anything I’m saying?”
It was past one when the door finally cracked open and Harry slipped into the room.
A look of resignation settled on Ron’s face, and he served himself a heap of eggs. “What case, Hermione?”
But it didn't fix things. It didn't change the fact that it had been a year, and Harry still couldn't seem to get enough distance from the war to stop having these nightmares. It didn't change the fact that Colin was gone because he'd fought for Harry. It didn't change the fact that Harry was
“That’s excellent!” Hermione cheered. “Will you show us, Draco?”
Harry grinned at him. "I can't believe we just got up to all of that in your future office."
Draco opened his mouth to explain to her why that wouldn't help, but then the bricks disassembled themselves and moved aside. "That's convenient." And odd. It was definitely one point in favor of her being a witch who didn't know about it.
Potter shifted from foot to foot. “Um. I was at Hagrid’s just now, talking to Hermione and Ron, and they said I ought to come talk to you.”
And nearly choked on it when Granger said, “You should tell him that you’re concerned.”
"Wait. Ginny. Please. You told him that he was doing the best he could, under the circumstances?"
And then the words took on shape. “Draco! Draco!”
"Keep them from having whatever they've been drinking until they turn back."
Ron grinned. “Was it a ferret?”
Granger and Pansy’s eyes both narrowed, but Granger was now looking at him in suspicion  while Pansy was looking on with rage on his behalf.
"I didn't want to seem desperate."
“You must have learned Occlumency young, too. You’re a genius at it! Can you imagine, if you were the first person to teach an entire year of Hogwarts students to be Occlumens?”
Harry grinned and tugged on Draco's arm, since he was getting slow. It wasn't just about beating Draco, it was about being a part of the team. It was about the people in the stands, craning their necks and screaming when he did something dangerous on his broom. It was about his favorite thing at Hogwarts, something he was good at that was untouched by all the Dark Arts. But for today it would be enough to be part of the screaming stands, cheering for Gryffindor to take the cup.
Draco knew he had to get to his coat, and wand, and make sure the girl actually got warm. But he took a moment to rub his forehead. This had already been the worst night of his life, and now he'd been interrupted by a
The person who was probably Teddy--today with short blond hair and a pointy chin, looking like a younger brother of Draco-- noticed Draco first. He came running across the room to launch himself at Draco’s legs.
Draco’s mind raced for some kind of out. He tried to make his mouth form a lie, like that it was a different Harry, or to make some kind of joke, or--anything.
Hopefully by the time he made it back to their rooms, everyone would be sleeping. He could get up early the next morning and set about the task of avoiding all of them for the rest of his life.
The different part
Immediately, the doe blinked out of existence.
“Malfoy?”
Was this part of the game? Draco didn’t know how to respond. He should have stayed silent.
As soon as he’d walked to the front of the room, a Gryffindor with giant brown eyes had raised their hand and asked, “Are you actually a Death Eater?” and Draco hadn’t known what to say. He spluttered. He adjusted his robes. He looked desperately to Potter for help.
Draco's arms were wrapped around himself now, less in defiance and more as a protective measure. "You don't touch me."
“When your thoughts get that far, they can be really out of your control. You were--”
Rather than rising to the bait, Granger’s face clouded with confusion. “He’s still hanging onto your wand? Why in the--I told him to owl that back to you eons ago.”
“Merlin, we’ve wasted a lot of time,” Potter grinned.
But Hermione and Ron didn’t look the least bit interested in discussing Viktor. They were both looking at Draco. Hermione’s face was calculating, Ron’s shocked.
There was a glint in her eye, though, and Potter spoke up right away. “It’s spiked.”
Harry felt a wry smile slide into place on his face. "I think what you said was that anybody could do it, so why not you?"
He entered the Great Hall and kept his chin up, gaze unfocused as he marched between the Slytherin and Ravenclaw tables. They were there, ahead, but he didn’t let himself register whether they were looking his way, or what kind of expression they had on their face, or any of it.
“Hah,” Draco scoffed. “They’ve got real trackers on our magic. The trace is a joke.”
After the first rush of people died down and the kids had wound through the crowd with cookies, Ginny blew in through the door, freeing a jar of gold from her robes. “I heard we're taking up a collection. I've been saving this to get a divorce," she grinned. "If I ever decided to get married."
Draco twitched his wand and the fireflies that had been flitting around the quartet dropped to the floor as stones. “Where is she?”
"I didn't even leave you stewing that long," Draco said, amused.
Draco clutched his pajamas to his chest, listening to the shifting of the house and the foots pounding up and down the staircase. He nearly always changed his clothes in the bathroom at Hogwarts, even this late into the year. If he was quite sure that the others were busy in the library, or Potter was in the middle of marking papers in the common room and looked unlikely to shift for the next hour, sometimes Draco would yank his robes off and tear on his silk pajamas in their dorm room.
Granger frowned at her friend. “You didn’t bother to look at who was teaching the class?  You do know about Defense, don’t you?”
"Draco," Claire offered helpfully, "You know that no one lives here, right?"
Draco had had very few real interactions with Ginny Weasley in the past. Playing Quidditch against someone or targeting them as part of a large group didn’t allow much room for individual impressions. But he’d been so certain he disliked her because she was actually cloying and obnoxious. He might have to re-examine that.
Harry smiled, because that was it, wasn't it? Draco could make every argument for himself, but when it came down to people actually choosing him--to anybody else seeing the good in him, it was always a shock. He took one of Draco's hands and squeezed it.
And with a snap of the fingers, the holidays were over, and Draco was boarding the Hogwarts express with the Golden Trio and Ginny Weasley once again. He had somehow been shuffled to the front of their group. Good. He could sit down in a compartment and get out a book right away and pretend to not even notice if the rest of them joined him in the same compartment.  He couldn’t remember how they’d all gotten on the train at the start of the holidays and if Potter and crew had chosen to sit with him or been forced to. But at that point they’d probably felt like they had to sit with him, since they were pressuring him into going to the Weaselys. They weren’t pressuring him into Hogwarts. He was court ordered. So they could sit wherever they wanted. Nevermind that after all those pick up Quidditch games and chess in the evenings it would feel like a slap in the face if they sat somewhere else.
“What did Harry want to talk to you about after class?” Granger asked, as if to get right to the spying.
“I think the Minister would be hard pressed to convince her to get rid of you or your little pet savior, but do you really think she’d miss us? I have transfiguration still, and she hasn’t said my name once this year. She looks right past me like I’m not in the room. She’d be glad of a reason to get rid of us.”
“Of course, sir,” Potter answered quickly. He’d apparently not learned the lesson etched into his arm about not telling lies.
"Merlin, Hermione," Harry snapped. "How do you not understand this? How do you not see this? It's not the teaching, it's the living."
Harry shrugged.
The door opened a fraction, and a house-elf stood in the doorway. "Who is interrupting my Master's celebrations at this hour?"
Draco considered, again, the usefulness of trying to explain to Teddy that most people couldn't change the way Teddy could.
"Right." Harry straightened his shoulders. "We're starting a unit on all kinds of dark disguises today. We've already done some things on transformations, so you should realize that animal transformation is one way to disguise yourself. Of course, there are lots of ways to disguise yourself that have nothing to do with dark or light, but people can use them for all sorts of good or bad reasons and--
Harry gave her a dark look.
Draco opened his mouth, then shut it again, He didn’t know the rules of this game, but that was his fault, for not being there. Right?
Draco noted that this was one of the most miserably awkward moments he had ever participated in. If he apparated to the manor right now, he could certainly claim that he’d done the spell in self defence. Potter was trying to kill him. If he didn’t say something, the Weasleys would all suspect that there’d been something--that Potter had--
The first years filed in, clustered so closely together that most of them kept bumping into the kids in front, who were walking with the slowest of steps. When the whole group had gathered in the hall, McGonagall stood and cleared her throat.
Draco leaned back in his sheets and chuckled. Maybe he should have left Harry feeling afraid to touch him. It was probably the only way he’d be able to best him. “Ginny will be very disappointed in me.”
Potter ruffled one hand through the back of his hair. “Malfoy and I have an unspoken agreement. Specifically, not speaking to each other from now until--well, probably until we die.”
Potter seemed to be choking on his drink. Weasley pounded him on the back several times.
Of course, Harry had also been totally sloshed by that point.
“I can see what you’re scrambling to hide,” Snape said, sounding bored. “The more panicked you are about hiding your secrets, the easier they are to uncover. The more you think about the things you don’t want me to know, the more they become you.
Colors and house--
*** *** ***
It was clear that no one wanted him or Pansy to be in the alley. The rest of the wizarding world didn’t want to see anybody who’d been connected with the Death Eaters. And when it came to Draco and Pansy, the wizards were out for blood. People weren’t happy that the two of them had dodged Azkaban and merely received a strict probation. He knew this because both of them had received quite a few pieces of emphatic mail before the Ministry started filtering everything addressed to their house through the Auror department to check for hexes.
Claire tugged on his arm. "Here, Draco. Let's take a detour."
“Can we--help?” Pansy ventured, frowning.
“I shouldn’t have rammed into you like that. I mean, I know you said not to play easy on you, but that was--I just saw that you were about to catch the snitch before I did, and next thing I knew, I was sending you flying. Or crashing, I guess."
“He’s trying to get some sleep,” Draco called from his bed. “And would like you to shut up, Potter.”
He knocked on the door. He'd been there only a couple of days before, and the house had been decorated for Christmas--there'd been a wreath on the door, and paper ornaments cut out by the children taped to the windows. And all of that was gone. Worse, there was no light coming from the windows.
"Sit down, gentlemen. And I'll thank you to actually listen to what I have to say before you start spouting objections at me."
was like this.
Draco’s veins turned to ice. “Under absolutely no circumstances do I want you to talk to Potter about this or anything else to do with me,” he replied. He knew his voice was clipped and harsh, and he was glad.
The water was such a shock of cold that he almost forgot what he'd jumped in to do. His arms and legs felt locked down to his side, but his hand brushed against something soft and stringy. Hair. He forced his eyes open and caught sight of the girl who'd fallen into the river. Her face was pale and looked nearly green in the strange underwater light, and her hair was waving out from her head along with the current. A thin stream of bubbles escaped her nose.
He explained the process for not-thinking and noticing their own thoughts, but couldn’t shake the look that Sam kept locked on him. When Potter suggested that the students split up and practice, Draco was relieved to slink off to the corner.
After gifts there was the enormous breakfast. Draco opted for the proteins and light carbs that would fuel his Quidditch victory, but most of the Weasely family seemed happy to linger over the breakfast rolls that Mrs. Weasely had baked and double up on servings of hash.
Draco didn’t know how to say it without Ron and Hermione getting worked up, but he wished Pansy would study more too. The two of them didn’t need to do well, they needed to be exceptional. He needed to convince someone that they should hire him despite his dark past because his NEWTs were just that good.
Ron and Pansy and Neville looked over, and Harry turned to Draco.
Ron looked nauseous. “I’m going to find Harry.”
Potter inclined his head in agreement. “But you don’t know it won’t be successful until you try.”
“Pansy,” Draco muttered. “Stop fiddling with your quills.” It was starting to make him crazy.
If Harry wasn’t good enough to go professional, Draco had never stood a chance. But that had been his dream. One of the little pet thoughts that was safe and innocuous enough to feed even when the Dark Lord was sifting through his thoughts.
Potter shifted. “Yeah. A bit.”
Draco thought of his old wand, tucked into the chest at the end of his bed. What was his first non-class spell going to be? He’d clean his teeth with magic tonight. He’d be able to cast an Impervious around his head if it was snowing on their walk home. He would never be able to cast another patronus in front of other living creatures for as long as he lived, but he shouldn’t need to, now.
"But Slughorn--Potions--he thinks--"
Draco felt a swoop roll through his stomach as Granger pouted. “Why’d you tell him?”
He couldn’t think too much about it. He’d hold back, he’d stop himself. He’d remember his promise to never cast the spell again. Draco flipped his wand into position, closed his eyes, and thought of Potter. And Hermione. And Ron. And Pansy. He thought of all the moments that had been unexpectedly full of laughter and warmth this year when he’d thought the rest of this life would be survival.
“What did Harry say?” Hermione asked. “I know that he’s been acting awfully obtuse, but surely this--”
Ron’s words didn’t have the sting they would have once, but Draco was still pouting. Who knew what else the packages would do, and his looks were all he had left.
Merlin. Daydreaming: easier to get away with if you weren't the one teaching.
The boys filed out, and Draco was finally able to take a breath that filled his lungs and let it all the way back out again.
*** *** ***
Harry was so close. He was close enough that Draco could reach out one arm and pull Harry’s shoulders until they leaned against his, until Harry’s head tipped under Draco’s chin. Potter wanted to protect everyone, he just wanted to make sure Potter was alright. So much for starving that thought, it bloomed and demanded Draco’s attention. Think. Not about that. About what to say to Potter.
Draco looked up. It did. And now, peering through the windows, he could see the traps and poisons on the shelves. The disorientation he’d felt earlier flooded back, and he leaned heavily on the doorframe to keep his footing.  "Where’s Potter?"
The doe erupted from his wand, and Sam followed a moment later with their dolphin.
Harry groaned. “There sits a wise man.”
Draco felt his shoulders rise, tightening around his ears. He didn’t want people talking about Snape. Sitting here in the potions classroom was steeped enough in memories of him without anyone actually saying his name.
They were making Veritaserum, which the ministry had been deeply in need of ever since the end of the war. There’d been a lot of it used in the months that followed. Not that this looked Ministry grade. Slughorn swirled the vial suspiciously. “It looks a bit--gloopy. Are you sure you stirred the whole time?”
Zoe looked down at her hands and gasped. "Look what I've done! Mister Draco!"
Potter looked at the wand on the table. “You can always say I’m the one who cast it."
Oh, right. Draco was staring out the window and ignoring the fact that Harry was right here, confessing his sort-of-love. "Uh, yes. The feelings are mutual. All that. But I don't want to create a scene in front of every living person we--"
"Great," Draco surveyed the room. "Now it's who-knows-how-long after midnight, and I'm exhausted, and all of your pawing at me has made this room messier than when we started."
Since yesterday's chapter was a back-to-school bonus, here's your semi-regularly-scheduled update!
Draco wished they would feed the students while they waited for the sorting ceremony to end, but there was nothing to do to occupy his hands, which were damp and clammy, and his mouth, which was way too dry, except sip the pumpkin juice again.
“Harry, you’re doing all you can. You’ve taught them how to protect themselves, and better, how to protect each other. Lacey and the first years had everything they needed because you gave them that. They didn’t need you to be there.”
“You’re short,” she snapped.
“I’m sure that will be convincing. Telling the ministry you cast an unsuccessful Patronus charm. I’m pretty sure they have a record of you casting one of those several years ago, actually.”
Harry paused, but Draco didn’t know what response to give. He let out a breath slowly, that breath and the soft pop of the embers the last sounds in the room.
Right. Harry raised his cup and took a gulp, and Draco mirrored his motions. And then, in a series of horrifying shifts, Draco became Harry's image, and Harry became Draco's.
“Tell her I’m sorry I can’t come. It’s the nicest--it’s beyond nice, though. You’ll enjoy your holiday much more if I’m not around.”
"No," he said again, his voice cracking. “Fred's fine. He's fine."
With that, he actually did leave, and Draco slumped down onto his own bed.
Granger glanced from Pansy to Draco, and Draco felt a surprising surge of gratitude at Granger that this morning felt so normal. Like she was mildly annoyed that he existed, but not because he had a crush on her best friend.
“You know what to do,” Potter whispered, so close to his ear, and Draco nodded, letting out one shaky breath.
“It doesn’t matter,” Harry rushed. “I just thought. Well, we ended all the effects of the spell. I just wondered if there was an explanation for why I kind of--miss him.”
Harry wondered when he'd last gotten a dose of Draco's anger like today. His fingers twitched for his wand, and Draco didn't miss the motion.
"First of all, I have no intention of placing Mister Malfoy in the position as Defense Against the Dark Arts."
“But burning down the school is off the table?”
Sam spun around in their seat, glaring at Hariot. "That's kind of the point of this class, isn't it, Devon? So we learn how to do it before it actually happens to us, because by then it might be too late."
Harry wanted to protest that this had nothing to do with being young, but he said nothing.
As soon as he donned his pyjamas and slipped into bed, a knock came at the door. If it was one of the Weasleys come to guilt him into more togetherness, he was going to flip them down the staircase. “Come in.”
“A book on Occlumency.”
he willed.
“Did anybody else go get help? We need Potter. And Madame Pomfrey. And the Headmistress, if anyone can find her.” Malfoy wasn’t even a professor. He didn’t know how to help a little kid who was about to transform into an obscurial. He’d only heard about it in whispered conversations.
“Holy shit,” Ron breathed.
He laughed. "What are you going to cast, Potter? Riddikulus, to get rid of the nightmare? Or Expelliarmus, so you can take back my wand? Or have you picked up some new hexes to try out on me?
Something about that made Harry's shoulders relax. When he talked to Hermione and Ron about the teaching job, it was about what he wanted, and what he'd be best at, and where he could make the most impact. Draco was the one who knew that all the big questions came down to names. Lacey. Sam. Devon. And all the names that weren't on his rosters yet. The real students that he'd love and fight with next year if he came back.
"Money?" Lockhart's eyebrows drew up in surprise. "No, I don't usually run into large amounts of money on the street. Why do you ask? Have you misplaced a few sickles?"
The bartender's face crinkled with confusion. "Potter? Are you one of our kind?"
This wisdom comes
Draco spit into the sink and watched the water swirl. “About class today. Is the girl--have you spoken to her?”
He started walking across the bridge, because if he didn’t do
The compartment door opened once again, and Pansy’s face appeared. “Thank Merlin I found you. Not everyone seems fond of having me poking my head into their spots. Also, none of you sent me nearly as much post as I requested.” She stowed her bag. “Potter, shove over."
"Potter?’ Draco swallowed. “You know me. Draco Malfoy? We met in Madame Malkin's when we were eleven and always got into rows at school--”
“You--Malfoy, you fancy him?”
Back in the room, Draco folded his clothes and put them away.
"I don't feel well," he managed.
“Since when did Potter have Draco’s wand?” Pansy had missed that side of things, and when Pansy asked where his wand was, Draco had let her think that he lost it during the war. Which, in a way, he had.
“Potter?”
"You did what the adult in the situation had to do. What somebody should have done for you."
She broke off, and looked, panicked, at Draco and Pansy, and Draco couldn’t stop himself--both of the Gryffindors were wearing shocked, horrified expressions, as if he was going to throw a young-Malfoy tantrum at just the mention of Buckbeak’s name.
“I don’t know what Potter has told you about Defense Against the Dark Arts,” he started. Well, at least his voice sounded imperious. The few first-years who hadn’t been looking at him jerked to stare with round eyes. “Probably teaching you that it’s a lot of silly wand-waving and shouting Expelliarmus louder than your enemies.”
Just as he was about to answer, Hermione Granger slid into the seat next to Pansy, and Draco’s mouth clamped shut while his eyes wandered over to inspect Granger for any signs that she was about to hex or otherwise attack him.
The Goblin left behind the desk (no skeletons in sight. Fred would be so disappointed) looked Draco over.
"I died," he said. "Voldemort cast the killing curse on me. There was nothing to protect myself with. I was knocked out, and I went--somewhere else. I should have stayed dead, but I think that because I had all the Deathly Hallows, I didn't. I came back. I had a choice. I told myself I had to come back and make sure Voldemort was taken care of, so I came back."
Potter rubbed the back of his neck. "Are you sure about that? Isn't it a bit much to put me up there with Santa?"
“Good morning.”
“Yes, Hermione, I did manage to catch that news.”
“Come on!” Neville encouraged. “You’ve seen all of ours. I bet yours is really cool.”
“If you insist. Anything for you, Draco.” He laughed at the stricken expression that crossed Draco’s face. “Anything for the joke shop, then.”
“Yeah. I just wanted to say.”
Harry's hands were so twitchy. He had to do something with them so they'd stop reacting like this, drawing Draco's distrustful looks.
“Obviously.” Draco almost laughed. Potter looked so earnest. “That seems like the point.”
No, he thought, as he leaned over the rails of the bridge to stare into the water. This had to be one of the minor bridges of London. But if he jumped from here--if he jumped into water that cold, wearing his boots and peacoat--if he just let himself be carried away, there wouldn’t be any Death Eater connected to the joke shop. There’d be no Death Eater frequenting Harry’s home. There’d still be no gold, but he couldn’t fix that. This was all he could do.
There’s more alike
His attention was jerked back to the great hall when he heard her announce: “Room 3, of boys dormitories, we’ll have Longbottom, Potter, Zabini, and Malfoy.”
Oh, was that all. “Lacey’s still doing alright?”
Granger frowned. “As if the other professors don’t? Anyway, I think Harry tries to be very fair. Are you sure he was trying to rub it in? Maybe he actually wanted to help?
Harry felt like Ginny had slapped him. She was so calm about this, almost business-like, but his heart was thudding. "So I'm the problem?"
Hermione opened her mouth, shocked, but Harry didn't want to stick around, not even to explain that he wasn't quitting the living thing, he just needed a break so he could make sure he was doing it right. This was the right thing to do, he knew this was right, but Hermione always thought she knew better.
Draco opened his mouth, but Hermione cut him off. “Harry, why were you happy when you came to talk to Draco?”
“You’d have to be. You were living with Voldemort. He would have seen your doubts. He wouldn’t have trusted you with--”
Harry’s eyes flicked to Draco’s, challenging and hard. “Yes, Malfoy. Back. I thought it was possible that you felt something for me, and I got excited. Don’t worry, I feel like a fool and I won’t do it again.”
"Are you worried about having enough money?"
But Draco didn't stop. It was only a few more blocks to Potter's house, and if he could just see that the windows were flooded with light and the front room was crowded with the kids who needed Potter, that would be enough.
Draco winced. “I’m right in here. Doing my homework, if they want to see me doing normal person stuff. You could bring through a tour group.”
Now Draco’s head jerked up and his gaze drifted over to the boy on the stool.
“No,” Harry said. And then he reached up fingers curled in hesitancy and pressed them to the scar that ran from Draco’s collarbone to his sternum. There were other scars, a small roadmap of them, but Harry’s fingers lingered on this one.
Draco shot a spell into the drawer, then levitated a paralyzed spider into the wastebasket. "But I'm trying to imagine a future for myself, now. And I know that everything will always be tied to my past. I'm not trying to get out of that. I just want to build a future I can live with. And I shouldn’t have gotten mad at you over not helping. I can't build that future with you."
The game was a comedy. Hermione disliked flying in general, but Angelina and Arthur wanted to include her, so they kept sending the quaffle her way. Ginny didn’t have any of the same compunctions about sharing, but whenever the ball was sent Percy’s way, he covered his face and screamed. Ginny managed to score on Ron twice.
Harry shook his head. "It's at least as exciting as Quidditch. And they're going to start soon, so--"
"Er, yes. Draco and I have been using it to sneak around and...." he trailed off awkwardly, but Dr. Goodnight was already laughing.
Sam cast the spell again, grunting with the effort, but nothing would form for them. “I can’t do it. If Lacey gets hurt it’s going to be all my fault.”
So instead of thinking about the long years ahead that he was supposed to survive—better than the last years, maybe, but still so long—he took deep breaths just like Pansy said.
He wasn't thinking of going anywhere in particular. Panicked thoughts kept crowding out any sense of plan or direction, but when he became aware of his surroundings, his feet had led the way into the middle of a bridge. Not one of the larger, fancier bridges of the city, which were undoubtedly crowded with tourists and couples proposing.
Draco's head snapped to look at Harry. "What?"
“Can you facilitate us into about half as much homework, then?” Draco muttered
Luckily, Potter did most of the work himself. Draco caught his eye the next morning, not meaning to make a big deal of it, just unable to keep from checking that Potter was--alright. But as soon as Potter saw Draco looking, his eyes widened and his head jerked to the left so quickly Draco thought his neck would snap. He could tell that Potter was blushing, though. He couldn’t stop the smirk. There was no way he could
"I can't answer all your questions for you, Harry, but I think I can tell you this: You're alive, Harry. You're so alive, it rubs off on the people around you. All this mess you're feeling--the trouble sleeping and eating and all of the thinking about your past--it's a part of the mess of being alive."
Jameson's eyes were trained on his boots. "Of course you can, Harry. I'll be good, I promise. It's just that I thought I saw wrackspurts hiding on the shelf, and I had to get a better look! There shouldn't be wrackspurts hiding in the joke shop."
Potter slammed the book shut in frustration. “You’re right. This is useless. I couldn’t learn it when it would have saved Sirius’s life, it’s not going to suddenly come to me in time to teach it to the Defense class.”
Red crept upwards from Harry’s collar. “No. I mean, no that’s not all I can say. I don’t think I ever said how sorry I was.” Harry was inching forward, and Draco felt his back pressing against the window frame.
actually thought of Draco's birthday ahead of time, and he'd worried about it. When you were, at heart, a kid that had grown up wearing your cousin's gross hand-me-downs, a kid for whom any gift had felt like a miracle, how did you figure out what to give someone like Draco, who'd been given the best of everything from the moment he was born?
Draco and Harry followed her into the office, and Harry realized that the color had gone from Draco's face.
“Ginny,” Charlie frowned, “You can be on the same team as Harry next year. I think you’re taking this all a bit too seriously.”
“Let’s go to the common room.” Potter’s voice piped up. “The girls wanted to plan some kind of event for later this week.”
Ron shrugged, but Hermione thought her words were finally starting to connect.
He slumped into one of the student’s chairs, and Draco turned around to finish with the tea. When he turned around, Potter’s forehead was planted on the desk. A fat tear plunked down on the wood.
He held his hands up, wandless. All other factors aside, it would be hard to explain using magic on first-years to the ministry. “I didn’t do anything to Lacey. Her own mind was hurting her.” He could recognize that well enough, and he had no doubt there were other kids in the class who at least recognized some part of it. “There are clearly some things in Lacey’s mind that are hard to face, and she might need help with that. But that’s where really defending yourself against the dark arts starts. Besides. I saw what the other first years can do yesterday. I’m not likely to take a whole class of you on, head-to-head.”
"I think I may have hit my head or gotten a bad potion today.”
“Malfoy. I feel like a shitty teacher. You’re doing half the instruction for the first years, but in this class--”
"Ten in the morning. If you can get all fifteen kids ready and out the door by that hour."
“And how many times,” Hermione frowned, her voice rising in pitch and volume, “Do I have to tell you I don’t want to hear you use
"That was weird."
So. He’d change in Ron’s room. It would be fine. Harry was still--somewhere. Somewhere else. He lowered his pajamas onto the bed to free his hands, then tensed and hesitated at the sounds of footsteps in the hall. The footsteps passed by, and he grimaced at his own jumpiness. This should not be a big deal. He stepped out of his trousers and into the comforting excellence of his green and silver pajama pants, then moved to pull his jumper over his head.
“Exactly, Potter. I understand that you like to live on the edge, but some of us prefer routine hours of sleep.”
Draco gathered him up into his arms and lifted him close. "Teddy." All he could feel was the fierce press of his arms squeezing Teddy's currently stick-thin body and the burning in his lungs. "Teddy, you're so beautiful."
"Of course I did. You can't possibly know how it feels that I've already mucked up my prospects forever. I'm touchy about it. I hate talking about it. That doesn't mean I want you to leave me on my own to figure it out."
Potter couldn’t suppress his grin. “Do you know why everyone in the class was cheering when they cast the spell?”
Hermione, as if she’d just noticed Draco’s presence, nodded once. “You can go. We’ve got it from here.”
Draco starved a thought. “I’m fine. I’d be finer if I had less homework and. Better. Sleep. Goodnight, Potter.
One again, Draco was relieved to be able to shake his head no, although now they were too close for comfort. “Nope. Not a stag, either.”
Harry-as-Draco shrugged. "People see what they expect to see."
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’ve got to catch up somehow,” Pansy insisted. She was lying on the couch with her feet on Granger’s lap. Draco had not imagined that outcome. He’d have to ask her about that. Later.
“Now would be a good time,” she said. It felt like pressing her luck to push Ron this far, but if he didn’t say what he was really thinking now, she was going to lose her mind. The jealous angry act did not look good on him.
When the first years had left the classroom, Draco gathered up his scarf and robe, and before he could stop himself, he offered, “It’s impressive you’ve got two of them casting Patronuses already.”
On top of that, I've been really disappointed at the transphobia coming from an author of books that have given so many people powerful lessons about love, empathy, and justice. Every kid deserves to feel safe, cherished, and supported at Hogwarts. For me as a member of the fandom, the incredible fanfic, inclusive to so many different kinds of diversity, gives me a lot of hope. I hope my stories, in tiny ways, make Hogwarts more welcoming.
He turned on his heal and sprinted out of the bank. Or he attempted a sprint and managed to wobble out, still dizzy and disoriented.
“No,” she answered, her lips pressed into a pout, “Not anymore, so that’s not much good to you, I’m afraid. This is where Harry lives. Are we going to talk to him?"
“Please, Professor!” Sam’s face was desperate. They’d seen Lacey troubled before and hadn’t reacted like this.
And Potter did shove over.
Draco's fingers tightened, ever so slightly, on the arms of the chair.
"Hmm?" the girl said. "That was one of your schoolmates, right? The girl who works with Harry at the children's home?"
Here--his footsteps were disturbed here, sliding and scuffing, and it looked like someone else had passed this way, too.
Draco felt his words like a blow to the gut. He'd known that. He'd known that when he first started at the Weasley's shop, that it was better if he stayed out of things. He'd known that when he started living with Teddy and Andromeda. And he'd for certain known it when he started visiting the home. How had he been so stupid as to forget?
Ten points to Slytherin.
And then, off to his right, the glint of midwinter sunlight on a golden wing. Draco couldn’t help it, his first instinct was to glance up to see if Potter had noticed. It was a terrible move as a player, because Potter always had one of his eyes on Draco, and he noticed Draco checking. So much for his advantage. Draco urged his broom down the field. He stretched his long form along the body of the broom, inching as far forward as he could and still maintain balance. A little farther.
They were a tangle of words and laughter and exclamations and frivolous magic spells all the way back to the castle. Pansy spelled her hair to look the way she liked and then spelled Granger’s hair into four different styles and Ron’s hair into four different colors. Draco spelled a snowball to bop Pansy on the head and transfigured several stones into fireflies.
“Third year,” Granger replied automatically. When we were researching the legal case for Buckbeak--”
Draco wondered how, even though every muscle in his body had frozen and he was incapable of looking at Potter at all, he so clearly knew that Potter had a painful, predatory grin on his face. Draco clutched his wand in one hand. Potter had backed him in a corner. Potter knew what happened when he backed Draco into a corner, and he did it anyway.
The cake was delicious, and in between bites, Harry managed to eat an apple. He noticed, distantly, that Draco and he seemed to have reversed roles. Draco took some bites of the cake and made a show of thanking everyone for it, but after that he just picked at everything, and finally Harry got impatient and stood. "See you later," Harry said to the other three, grabbing Draco's hand.
It gave Draco a small measure of satisfaction that Harry’s voice sounded as uncomfortable as he looked. Maybe he felt guilty for mocking Draco now. “Really? Well if you won’t tell them what you said, Potter, I will. He waltzed right up to my table, interrupting my studying no less, and started telling how the whole first year class had a go at me about having the same Patronus as Potter and they’d all decided that I fancied him. And that he asked Weasley and  you, Granger, about it and you told him that he should come and mock my Patronus to my face instead of behind my back.” Steady, Draco. His voice was starting to dip. “So he had a good laugh at me, and I told him that you should all leave me alone.”
Harry downed the rest of whatever was in his glass in a single swig and set it down on the piano.
Dear Draco,
“Me. Pansy. Me.”
Luna was the best at remembering to think about the children's emotional health, even if it was usually couched in language about mythical fantastic beasts. The kids that came to stay with Harry all had slightly different stories. Some of them were orphans of the war--from either side--not lucky enough to have grans and cousins and godfathers to look after them. Some of their parents, like Jamie's and Holly's, were non-magical and disagreed with the fact that their kids were wizards. Some of them, like Zoe, had parents who were convinced they'd had a son and didn’t appreciate it when Zoe explained she was their daughter. And then there were kids like Thom, whose family didn't actually have anything to disagree with him about, since they seemed to function by pretending that he'd never existed. Potter had officially scheduled appointments for the kids with mind healers on a regular basis, but Luna was the best at reminding them to think about it in the in-between times.
Draco held his breath as Lacey and Sam moved the wand together and Lacey choked out, “Expecto Patronum.”
Draco turned around to watch Lockhart pass. He was dressed in red and gold, and surrounded by laughing lackeys.
"What happened to protecting priceless artifacts?" Harry asked.
Draco responded like Draco. His chin lifted a fraction of an inch and his nostrils narrowed, but he gave no other sign that he'd even heard the headmistress. Harry opened his mouth to object. He'd been too quiet before, he hadn't explained to McGonagall just how much of the work Draco actually did with the class. he hadn't told her about how kids stopped Draco in the corridors to thank him, or--
“Hermione,” he continued, trying to keep his voice steady. “Can you get the kids out of here?”
Ron frowned. “Hermione, the first guess was my idea.
“Oh good,” Draco answered. And I’m sure I’m going to hear more about this theory than I want to.”
But then, those were all fantasies. Draco knew what would really happen. Potter wouldn’t care.
"No," Draco whispered. His knees shook, then gave, and he dropped into the snow. "No. no. Fred's not dead. I just saw him at the shop."
For every memory he could think of wanting to grab hold of Draco, there was a matching memory of telling himself no, that it wasn’t the right moment. That he would do it wrong and upset Draco. That he should keep his hands to himself.
“I tried the ice trick,” a Ravenclaw submitted. That explained the pile of ice cubes sitting beside Lacey. Draco could hardly believe they’d remembered the ice trick. He’d told them if the things inside their head felt stronger than anything outside their head, they could use something to anchor them in the physical, like squeezing an ice cube. They’d tried. What could he try that they hadn’t?
So Draco couldn't complain when business picked up again around the holidays. In fact, as the knuts and sickles started to stack up, he’d been the one to suggest a Christmas Eve extravaganza. Music, pictures with Santa, homemade cookies and cocoa.
"I guess we'll see what the Ministry says. Lacey's furious at me."
he told himself. It was okay to think of his history and miss it. He was more than the imprint of the soul. He was standing here now, cheering for Ginny with his friends, and even with everything he missed, the feeling inside of him was more happy than not.
“No I wasn’t,” he snapped. “I was stretching. I’ve been sitting here forever.”
But the shop needed the business, so Draco couldn't complain. Fred and George were geniuses at coming up with new gags and toys. But they were also Gryffindors, and while that shouldn't directly correlate with a complete lack of business acumen, it sometimes did.
Draco put a sticking charm on the portrait and hung in on the wall above his desk. Emotions were still flickering across his face too quickly for Harry to track all of them. A half smile, rapidly blinking eyes, a little huff of a sigh. But when Draco turned around, he nodded. "You did a good job."
Hermione was too immersed to answer, so Pansy piped up. “Draco and I both have our magic usage restricted by the Ministry, and Hermione’s more worked up about it than either of us.”
"You can't just leave something dark and dangerous in the top drawer for someone else to come along and find, Draco."
Harry retched, only partially in play. "Thank Merlin you didn't bring that up. Disgusting." He picked up a saucer covered with pink rosettes from the place where it had landed, miraculously unbroken, on the ground. Did it have some kind of unbreakable spell? Could it be dangerous?
"I'll have you know that we're a well-oiled machine in that house, Draco Malfoy."
Harry’s eyes widened, hands forming into fists. Malfoy took one of his hands, prying it out of the fist and holding onto it. “We’ll fix it, Potter. He’ll be alright. Let’s go chat with your beloved Headmaster, shall we?”
He didn’t feel like eating the eggs, but it would make him seem unaffected. He took a bite and focused on the sensation of chewing. Pansy sat down at his left hand, putting her face far too close to his. “What did he say, Draco?”
“Exactly,” Hermione agreed, flipping a page. “I’m going to file an appeal at the end of next week, so I need to know the precedent. Did you get my note last night?”
"Stop. I'm not--what do you mean I never asked? You got all touchy any time I brought up next year."
Potter’s blush deepened. “I thought it was sort of...obvious. I had all those dreams earlier this year where I woke up calling for you, and then engineered that whole, “help me teach the first years” thing, and then invited you to my mate’s for the holidays. I figured, if you weren’t acknowledging it, it was because you didn’t want anything to do with me.”
She sobbed again. “I’m causing a sc-scene. I’m not supposed to--” her voice broke off as her back arched and Draco’s hand sank into her arm. He pulled back.
Harry shook his head fiercely. "No. Your letter inviting me to teach Defense was the first thing that got me out of my funk last summer. I would never have gotten this far in figuring things out if not for the students. But I think any choice I made right now would be wrong, because I can't make choices right now. And I don't want to end up being a teacher that isn't safe for kids because I made the wrong choice."
There were loud, gasping breaths and then the shift of a mattress as Neville sat on Potter’s bed.
Andromeda had started cold. At first she’d wanted to do everything for Teddy herself and keep Draco at arm’s length. But Draco didn’t have to wear her down--the two year old did that. Eventually she had to start letting Draco feed Teddy and convince Teddy to put on clothes. She still wasn't exactly a burbling font of affection. But she made sure that Draco had something to eat and that he got nearly enough sleep, and that wasn't nothing.
Don’t ruin the party, he told himself. Just listen, just play along.
"The Battle of Hogwarts," he whispered.
The door opened, and Draco tried to pull the sweater back into place, but in his panic it had gotten hung up on his elbow, and he was trapped. The only way out of this was through. Draco pulled the jumper all the way off and held it clutched in one fist. Instead of snatching up his shirt and buttoning it into place, he stood facing Potter and Ron. Waiting.
McGonagall frowned. "If there's a place for you where?"
Gross. Also, useless. “What are you reading, Potter? Or should I ask, which of the books is Pinch going to have to wipe drool out of?”
You said that it scares you, how much time is in front of us. It scares me too. Merlin, I thought I was done. I walked into the forest, and I thought, this is the measure of who I am: every decision I've made so far. Every action I've taken and everything I left undone, and then I died, and it was true. I was done. All the fight was over.
Draco didn’t turn around. “I’m just going to bed. No plots tonight.”
Draco hugged his peacoat tighter to protect himself from the stinging snow. The weather recommended something warmer, but there were two problems with that. One, his black peacoat looked excellent on him. Two, it was the only coat he currently owned.
Fred Weasley.
“Teach it to the Defense class?” Draco echoed. He was losing his disaffected pose, since now he was openly staring. Potter was more cracked than he’d thought. Occlumency had never been taught at Hogwarts, as far as he knew, and certainly not by an overworked student-professor. “Potter, you don’t have to teach Occlumency,” he said slowly. He’d thought Potter wanted to master Occlumency to help with the nightmares. Not this.
Harry managed to get Draco outside the doors of the Great Hall before he spun to look at him. "Well. It's your birthday. What do you want to do?" Harry meant to leave the door open for anything, but he was pretty sure his voice made it clear just what he wanted to do with Draco at this point.
To all the readers who stuck with me though this story: Thank you so much. This year has been--so much for so many people. I abruptly lost my job working with students in March due to Coronavirus shut downs, and not a day goes by that I don't think about the kids in unsafe or unstable situations. That ended up playing a big part in writing this.
Ron interrupted, “That’s the biggest load of--first of all, the first years found him the moment he walked into the castle because they knew he could help.”
A bolt of inspiration struck, and Harry jolted upright. He needed to find Draco.
'I'm thinking too," Draco snapped, "But I'm actually letting you be part of it. I don't have answers, Harry, but all of this that I can, I'm trying to do with you. I can't keep trying to guess the password every time I want to get into your thoughts. Can't you just sit down and talk to me?"
And wizards blue
Hermione frowned, “She must have--” and then broke off, as if she was trying to remember a counterexample. “Alright, but she wouldn’t like the Ministry telling her what to do. Besides, the court designated a period of four years. You leave Hogwarts after this year. There’s not going to be professors telling you what spells to cast then--how do they expect you to do magic?"
I did. It was for the Order. It was for him. It was what I had to do, and he knew I would do anything. He knew I would do anything he asked, and he asked me to keep going back there, and I may hate my Aunt and Uncle but I still--I loved Dumbledore. Even when he did that."
Teaching is hard, especially when you haven't dealt with your own trauma.
“It’s not safe. We need you all to go back to your common rooms so we can help Lacey.”
Johnson puffed his chest. “Professor Potter says we never know when there’s going to be a moment we have to defend against the dark, and that we’ll never really feel ready. But we have to try.”
"No." The idea was almost laughable. If anything, he needed to start thinking about where he wanted to start donating the old gold from the Black family vaults.
"And you'll be glad to know that the ministry has evaluated her sisters, both of whom showed some magical capabilities, and will be keeping a surveillance charm over the house. If they find evidence that the girls are unsafe, they will be removed. Meanwhile they're trying to convince the parents to participate in an educational program for non-magic parents of Wizarding children. The program's only in the developmental stages, but I believe Miss Granger thinks she can help them get that started next year along with all the other things she's getting up to."
And with that, Grager left the Great Hall in a huff.
The sharp edge of the words caught Harry, and he was hit with a memory of Fred and George leaving in a blaze of glory. But he couldn't deny that the pen was more mischief than evil. He put it into a pile on the desk of things that were safe enough to keep.
"It's your birthday gift," Harry grinned. "What, were you expecting it to be wrapped in old socks?"
The trial proceedings--from sitting in the waiting room, to Hermione launching into an impassioned argument that magic was a fundamental characteristic of every witch and wizard and that to restrict the use of magic was to restrict their being and potentially cause irreparable harm to their well-being, to Hagrid’s testimony about being wrongfully expelled from Hogwarts and having his wand snapped for something Tom Riddle had actually done, to Pansy trembling on the stand and explaining that she was falling behind in her classes because she was afraid to practice the spells on her own, to Draco getting up on the stand himself and saying as little as possible to avoid insulting or offending anyone, to the Wizengamot’s discussion of how dangerous and evil he and Pansy might be, to the moment they reached a verdict--took most of the day.
“Agreed,” Draco snapped, trying to ignore the sad twist inside him. He’d never once thought he could really have Potter in the way he wanted him, but it had seemed for a while like they might bump into each other if Pansy and Hermione both wanted to catch up over dinner, or-- “I see no reason for you to force the issue.”
“No circumstances, Granger. None."
Hermione leaned back in her seat, clearly pleased with herself.
Draco clenched his fists in his coat pockets. "I don't know," he muttered. "The kids have lost enough. Especially Teddy. I don't want that for any of them. It would be better--I just wish I'd never been born."
In the dark, with Potter’s voice soft for once, instead of demanding, Draco wanted to be honest  with him. “Alright Potter. You’ve seen everything I’ve done with the first years. You’ve had a chance to practice it. Should I come into your mind and take a look around?”
“And he’s got books here about all sorts of things and people. Look! This is a book on the Weasleys!” Potter picked up the book and found himself unceremoniously dumped out of Draco’s mind.
Pansy nearly attacked him at the table. “What did Potter want?”
Draco was dangerously close to emotions he didn’t want to share. “It doesn’t matter, Potter. So I’m failing Defense. You can’t be expected to teach me happiness. Thanks to Granger they’re not going to chuck me into Azkaban for failing a class. I’ll be just as good a cautionary tale for children with or without the defense skills.”
“Not this one.” There was a hint of a smile on his face.
The kid--Draco didn’t remember his name, but did remember him being an attentive student, balled up his fists and swallowed, looking like he was gathering courage to speak
“We’re not going to beat Potter, anyway,” Charlie laughed. “I’m all for pickup Quidditch, but let everyone enjoy their hols, Gin!”
Draco's mouth dropped open. He hadn't stolen anything, but--they'd definitely given him the money, and now it wasn't here. The goblin's hand was already in the floo powder. He'd floo the Auror's office, and they'd have someone here for him in seconds.
Potter didn’t have nightmares like that. As with everything else, he had to be the center of attention.
“I wish you’d stop deflecting with sarcasm and bitterness every time!” Hermione snapped. “What do you want to hear, Ron? If you want an answer, why not ask the question you actually mean?
“I have three guesses. If I’m wrong about all of them, you don’t have to tell me what your Patronus is, and I promise to defend your position of not doing the spell in front of the class. But you have to answer honestly. “
I’ve sorted you
“What’s Lacey doing?” hissed a Ravenclaw boy.
“I think you changed their mind. But while the first years were going on and on about their new hero, they started asking some--interesting questions about Patronuses.”
Draco looked at Potter to see if any of this was sinking in, and all he could see was that he’d taken the wrong tack. Harry now had the look of someone watching a puppy drown.
"I didn't know if you'd like it," Harry rushed. "It's kind of--I don't know. Maybe it's corny or maybe it's too much or something. But Luna had something like this painted on her ceiling when we went to her house, and I spent a bunch of time thinking about what I should get for someone like you, who's always had the best of everything, and I couldn't think of anything I could pick out that you'd like better than getting it yourself, but I really wanted to get a gift that would mean something, so--there's this."
"Potter," Draco said, waving the house elf aside. "What's going on?"
She shoved a vial into his hand, and he glared at it. “What is this?”
her grandson. But he'd been the wrong Teddy, not the one that Draco read stories with at night. And Harry had been the wrong Harry, not the one who collapsed on the couch next to Draco when he’d finally gotten Maya back into bed. And the street had been the wrong street, not the one that Draco always trudged through in the cold.
Seamus turned around to appeal to a larger audience. “I’m just saying they could make the questions a bit spicier, right? Nothing too incriminating, just something like this, ‘Who do you think is the hottest bloke to ever attend Hogwarts?”
“So you have noticed.”
Draco cleared his throat. It didn’t seem like she was talking about the patronus anymore.
With that, the Head of the Wizengamot pounded his gavel, announcing that they were finished, and swept down from his chair and out of the room.
