Draco heaves a strangled noise. Takes a gulp of air and holds a hand to his heart as he sits back. Harry mirrors his position, sitting back on his haunches. Draco says, as evenly as he can, “I can research a way for severing the bond without hurting us, of course. I am very close to attaining answers about magical core and compatibility with Elle, and I believe if I can apply my research to—”
"Don't lose heart. It's one match, early in the season. Plenty of flying time ahead of you." Coach patted Harry on the shoulder.
Draco forcefully did not encourage that line of thought after their divorce. But when the news is rubbed in his face that Harry is, indeed, trying new things, there’s no point in denying the horrible feelings Draco’s has brewing inside.
“He will go, Draco, he made a promise.” She mused, from where she was perched on the sofa, both cats struggling for a spot on her lap.
"Because the house is that fucked?" Harry asked.
The fight leaves him. His grin falls and his heart feels so heavy. How did that happen? What is he going to do now?
“It was like that when we came in,” Healer Cameron says. Her wand is raised, and there’s a thin layer of sweat on the curve of her forehead. She’s probably the one keeping Elle alive, Draco considers, watching the effort the woman is making.
obtained a photo of him with a man."
"People
"Aha," Draco said. "You feel that?"
Potter looks at Draco’s uncovered forearm, where the fading Dark Mark rests, and then back at Draco’s reddening face.
He shakes his head. “Your curse is feeding on your magic, so the more the magic, the worse it gets. We will take all the precautionary measures to assure your safety. Meaning, from now on, you’re on a strict potions diet for three weeks.” He smiles at Elle, and points at the assembly of vials by her bedside table Draco had organised before he started talking. “This procedure won’t expunge your magic; your core will remain intact. It only means you won’t be able to access it for the duration of the spell. These potions will ensure your body retains some degree of magical affinity. It’s not always clear how full grown wizards behave without magic, so we’ll make sure your body is surrounded by magic, externally rather than internally. Once we take the subject the curse is most interested in from you—your magic—it won’t have space to grow. It’ll stabilise and we’ll be able to lift the curse without having it ravage your magic.”
Draco chuckles. “Yes, like your... Erm, Hagrid.”
thestral--”
“I don’t know. We’ll talk soon and figure out where to go from there.” The words are strained, but he doesn’t care. He lifts her arm straight in front of her. “Hold that up.”
"I don't get it," Harry said finally.
Then, Harry moves on the mattress, turning his face to Draco, his hands tucked between his knees. “I died,” Harry confesses, with a ragged breath. His magic sparks. “I died in the forest, during the Battle of Hogwarts.”
He’s the one who drove them apart, the one to reject their bond and their connection because of petty certainties and cowardly fears. He can’t live with this guilt. But he can’t live without Harry again, either.
“It’s because I love you,” Draco interrupts weakly.
Ruby stalks up to them, meowing like the world is ending. She jumps on the couch, settling on Harry’s thighs as his hand comes up to pet her head distractedly.
“What…? But—”
Draco turns to Elle again, only to find he’s alone.
to make Harry happy.
"Filthy whoreson half-blood! Blackamoor! Sodomite! Catamite! Thief! You dishonour this house with every breath you take!"
Draco must have read between the lines that Harry wanted to learn family stories, including Sirius and added in stories about the Blacks too.
His own grin grows as he cards his fingers through Harry’s hair and pulls him to a kiss, repeating endlessly into his lips:
She rolls her eyes, but doesn’t comment on his remark.
"Don’t give me excuses. I don’t care. I am paying you enough.
“Right, then,” Marvin agrees, nodding and resting back on his chair. “Let’s start.”
“He’s experiencing paralysis. His cognitive functions are minimal.” She eyes Draco warily before turning back to her patient.
"Who is going to follow in your footsteps then?"
"Who said this was a date?" Draco scoffed. "He’s not my ex."
Blaise ignores his question. “Do you want to go home?”
Draco reads, casting Pansy’s words out of his mind. He’s at least thankful his lawyer will deal as an intermediary between him and Harry. He can’t meet Harry again, not when his words are still so fresh, wounding his heart like sharpened knives.
“There’s nothing to tell.”
He lifts the instrument, muscle memory aiding him in positioning it properly and playing the song he knows so well. His music fills the room, louder than the lyrics he now wishes he could forget, awaking memories that will never let him rest.
"I don’t really talk about this and not many people know. But I had a breakdown after my first season. I’m better and I’ve been better since. But I get depressed without something to look forward to. Of course, I could do anything. But I needed to feel like I was going to do something. Everyone gets busy with their lives, and I can’t just hang around and train forever."
Finally, when no one breaks the silence, Draco sighs, falling stiffly on his chair.
Draco looked down at him, mouth pursed unhappily.
Unable to fight his grin, he lets Harry drag him into another round of questions.
Draco’s attention snapped to him, although he said nothing for a long moment.
Harry doesn’t look ashamed, but he averts his gaze from Draco all the same, leaning his hip against the table. “We’ve been tracking the residual dark magic Voldemort left in me, it can be distracting."
"Ah, there's my Rosie-Posie! I found her! I found her!" Ron swept Rose into his arms and kissed her cheeks while she giggled.
"I’m not obsessed. I told you. I like it. Sometimes I wish I had more of the put-together thing you’ve got going on," Harry admitted.
Harry nodded.
“I’m his Healer, and I’ll do everything I can to make sure Harry is better, even if I have to get you away from him.”
"The job will be done even if you think I am a—how did you once put it—'handsome but morally blank, stuck up ex-Death Eater who everyone forgave because he's useful'. My father disagrees with you on the useful part, for whatever that’s worth."
Draco can't bring himself to cast a Patronus now, unable to face the translucent blue stag, and settles to watch as Pansy’s mockingbird slithered its way out of St Mungo's and away—into the Department of Mysteries, where the Hermione spends most of her time  nowadays.
His thoughts, his
Harry laughs lowly. “No. But they think I haven’t noticed.”
He needs help.
"I didn't want the VIP stuff. You wear sunglasses, a hat, and no one knows. Some man spent forty minutes telling me about new flying techniques," Viktor said, sheepish. Harry groaned.
"What does he do now?" There was something nice about just strolling hand-in-hand, with darkness stretching in between bright shop front displays late at night and houses with their curtains drawn and street lights and parked cars.
, he thinks and immediately curses himself, because… Well, Harry never actually left.
Harry was still sheepish. "Yeah. We…yeah I did. He stayed over. It kind of just happened."
"I knew people at Hogwarts," Harry said, somehow trying to wrangle an invite for a sex party over nine years past.
"Yeah, thanks, Neville," Harry said. "How’ve you been? How’s everything?"
right in his own skin and he can’t tell if it’s out of excitement or fear.
Harry’s eyes spark with interest, and a grin slowly creeps across his lips. “You know, I think I’m not that hungry,” he whispers, throwing his arms around Draco’s neck.
He didn’t understand that letting the past go doesn’t mean forgetting. And he sees it when he finally takes down their marriage photo.
Harry is not supposed to be here half an hour early. He’s not supposed to be drinking coffee while looking so out of place.
He has the video recording of their wedding playing on the telly. Harry had insisted on getting that bloody Muggle camera, because
“Divorce.” His own voice is distant, he doesn’t sound like himself. Still, he pushes on, fixing a smile on his lips. “Harry asked for a divorce.”
Draco should have prepared better for this.
He waved at them too, clapped a few of them on the back. They were all great players, too.
Harry almost dropped his glass.
outside of London, really, even if his mother has been living in a somewhat remote location in France, in a house lent by distant relatives. Draco chuckles, remembering the whole amalgam of headlines that has been featuring his name lately.
“What do you mean it’s ours?” Harry is looking around, analysing some wall or another, possibly already imagining the pictures they’ll hang. Maybe some shelves with Draco’s books.
Their lips barely graze—hot and full and magical and
The animal has adapted quickly to their lives, but Draco guesses it must be easy when they have food and a place to eat. And they’ve adapted to her.
“Yeah.” Harry dismisses it with a shrug, his eyes glazed and distant. He tilts his head towards the corridor, as if asking Draco if that’s the way he’s going. What can Draco do if not follow?
“Do you hear it too?” Draco asks.
"It’s my birthday, and if I eat all of Molly’s cake, I’m going to be sick." Harry led him into the kitchen and offered him a slice.
“What do you mean?”
Draco nods, entranced by the curve of Harry’s finger on his mug and the way he’s trying so hard to be civil to a man he used to despise.
"They don't get to take me back now," Draco said. "If they could publicly declare I’m not their son, they don’t get to make private requests for fucking dinner."
"Rosie-Posie, we use gentle touch, yes? You know Crooks doesn’t like his hair being pulled, same as you," Ron said without looking.
Pansy's stunned expression dissolves into something more or less relaxed, but her laughter sounds still a tad hysterical. “You were the first one to say he lost the plot, and it was all graceless gossip.”
"I cry over my parents all the time. I wouldn't worry about that," Pansy said. "Are you ready for this?"
It used to be the most messy and ‘Harry’ room in the house. Large windows covering one wall from the ceiling to the ground, bathing it in light at all times, whether from the warm blinding sun or the cold bluish glow of the moon. Harry had stuffed the walls with shelves, brimming with brushes, inks, art books, pens and the plants Harry said created a lively ambience. Canvases were always scattered around, leaning against each other and on the walls, finished or not. Harry’s works tended to be vibrant and colourful, much like him.
They all laugh, and Harry joined in a little awkwardly. Then Millicent did an impression of a music instructor all of them had shared as kids.
Draco takes it, eyes bright and a disbelieving smile on his lips. “Changed your mind, did you?”
"We'll do the post-mortem tomorrow morning before training," he told Coach. And there was no argument. Everyone handed their gear to staff and Apparated home.
Then a thought struck Harry.
"Yeah, I figured. What's with Miles?" Harry asked. They were walking. From the last time, it seemed unlikely Draco would come home with him, so he wanted to stay out just a little.
?” he enquires, wishing he could say more, pressure her to give him an answer right this instant. But as much as he wants to know what the fuck is going on, Draco’s still a healer and Elle is still his patient.
still makes him feel empty inside. It makes sense. The manor had seemed cold and lonely after the war. Just a dead, empty vessel waiting to be filled again, or to crumble to ashes. He thinks nothing will make it feel as alive as it did once. The house, the grounds, the tree; they had beamed with life, pulsating under the sun, sheltering the Malfoys from the cold, protecting who lived there. It was beautiful. Now it’s just a… blank space.
much to tell. But if Draco says it all out loud, if he tells them everything that happened, it’ll be more real than the still unanswered lawyer’s letter. It will be final.
Stella stepped in, "As our captain, Harry is passionate about Quidditch, and we're very lucky to have him. We won today and that was because of his leadership in the season."
Draco chokes, coughs a few times and recovers before Harry can change his mind. He tries schooling his features into something less eager. He knows better not to ask something of him Harry can’t give. Draco says, “Yes. Of course, I can.”
Harry’s condition worsens after their visit to the forest. He forgets more serious things—the dinner to celebrate Julie’s birthday, their one-year anniversary party, his classes,  feeding Ruby—his magic flares wildly, but it doesn’t respond as easily to Harry when he needs to cast the simplest spell. He asks where Draco got the dragon printed silk pyjamas, though Harry himself had gifted it to him last year. More than once Harry wonders when they adopted a cat. When Granger and Pansy settle in their guest room for a few days before their new flat is done being furbished, Harry welcomes them with a grin, but inquires about their presence to Draco and if they’re dating later in their room, even though the girls have been dating for at least six months.
“How did that happen?” The news conjured a hilarious image.
Harry observed the wide expanse of nothing. He didn’t have many memories of the exterior of the Manor, having only been there twice in his life, and he now wondered what it had been like to grow up with so much space. The property, once overlooked by that sprawling mansion, was nothing but a humongous snowy field dotted with oaks and fir trees, and it made it appear even bigger than Harry remembered. While Harry wasn’t an architect, the potential of such a space made him giddy, and he was eager to dig into the power of the land to see what his magic would come up with. He’d felt similarly about the orphanage, his first project after he quit Auror training and launched his consultation business (
Hermione had been over at Blaise’s so often that Harry should’ve known they’d one day start dating. He hoped their relationship could ease Gin’s guilt over the break-up: Gin had often confided in him that they wished Matteo could spend his time between Gin’s home and his dad’s, but that the change in scenery would upset him when he was younger. Gin had thus taken a step back and chosen to brave the awkwardness of visiting their ex several times a week. It was still odd to imagine Zabini being domestic and discarding his wild ways for a child, though.
An adult Pygmy Puff pawed at Draco’s ankle, and Draco’s expression softened. He took Harry’s left hand, rubbing his thumb on the scar from the glass shard. Because of the provenance of the lantern, the healing spell hadn’t got rid of it. Harry didn’t care; some scars bothered him more than others. This one only reminded him that Draco saved his life that day.
“I don’t understand why no one found it before,” the Pureblood drawled. “That magical aura could’ve been detected by many wizards over the centuries, so did it go dormant? Why did it wake up?”
“Did you tell her?” Draco asks with a frown, reading Astoria’s reassurances about accidental magic. She’d know: she’s an Unspeakable. One sentence stands out:
Kreacher looked ready to claw Draco’s eyes out. “Master Draco doesn’t understand.”
said Noodle, climbing Harry’s leg.
Draco slept for sixty hours as several spells prevented his death. When Harry tells him what cyanide is, he laughs until his ribs ache. The Great Draco Malfoy, killed by a Muggle poison. It’s hysterical. He thinks about Snape, how he would react if he knew his most gifted student didn’t know the name of the substance that makes the stone of some fruits dangerous.
"That’s not possible," Draco said. He started again at the top of the scroll. "Has it always been like this, Harry?"
They were, against all odds, suited to each other.
Harry's blood boiled. For a moment, he didn't care if he was Captain, or for decorum or the match. Buoyed by the chorus of boos from the stadium, he flew up to the head ref on the pitch, dropped off his broom and started yelling. They stopped play.
Draco shakes his head, closes his eyes. “What is going to happen to you?”
Percy took one look at Harry and said to Pansy, "Right, I’ll go for a walk, then." He put on shoes and bolted.
“That was gorgeous, Draco. The way you played and the way you just seemed to connect with the music... It was something I’ve never seen before...” Harry’s hand fell onto Draco’s shoulder. “Your magic was calling to mine. It’s never felt that way before. It was like a magnetic field... And when I allowed it to happen I could feel the music...” Draco let out a breathless laugh. He knew the feeling.
Draco warmed up with some simple dexterity exercises. Shifting, intonation, harmonics, and some scale patterns. He then moved on to bowing technique. Half an hour passed of these more simple ideas, allowing him to connect with the instrument. The magic he did on the instrument allowed it to open up under his fingers, and connect with him on a level that muggles did not have. A magical bond with his instrument. It made playing that much easier, that much more natural. It was a similar bond to that of his wand, in the way that the magic connects with his own to create something more than simply the culmination of the two.
He was surprised to find how much of himself he had hidden from the world. It’s interesting, he had thought, who you can be when nobody expects anything of you. He often reminisced on that idea, the idea of being somebody completely unknown to oneself. Draco often looked in the mirror and didn’t easily recognise who he saw. There was a man in that mirror, a man who had been through too much for one person. There was a man in that mirror who bore much similarity to a young boy named Draco, but this man had been able to move on and become someone. This man in the mirror was not burdened by his past. And yet, Draco thought, the man in the mirror was him.
“Yeah, yeah. Makes sense. I’ll see you then, I guess? Maybe we grab a pint after?” Harry nodded.
“I could get you in, sometime. To the orchestra, I mean. I have season passes to the symphony for free, since I play there often. I’ve got a couple of extras I haven’t a need for since it’s just me.” Harry’s expression changed when Draco said that, his lips curving into a smile.
An hour later and he was done. He set down his instrument, loosening his bow quickly before taking the short walk to his kitchen. It wasn’t much, but it was enough for him to move around to prepare his meals for the week. He found it easiest to prepare everything at once for the week, so he didn’t have to think about it all later. And so he took one of his prepared containers of oats from his refrigerator, and sprinkled some cinnamon on top. He took the book he was reading from his coffee table and sat at his kitchen table, opening to where he had left off. It was a muggle book, written by some author more than half a century prior. It was a science-fiction novel, detailing the journeys of an excited young man who had discovered teleportation. Draco enjoyed the simple things that muggles managed to get excited over and consider fantasy. The reality of his life was that he could disappear and reappear at any spot on the island with ease. With a bit more energy, anywhere in Europe. He delighted in the knowledge that he could perform a task that muggles thought was impossible. It gave him something to be proud of, in the context of being a wizard versus muggle. While his prejudices against muggles had rapidly diminished with his integration into their world, he still found some joy in those kinds of thoughts. Maybe it was his nature.
They settle into a comfortable pattern for the rest of the day. Conversation comes and goes, mostly about unimportant things—Quidditch in the last twelve years, Muggle technology, movies Harry
When Harry asks if he wants a glass of wine to celebrate, Draco merely raises an eyebrow.
Pansy splutters, looks at Draco as she says, “Control your husband,” and struts out with her coffee.
Harry thought hard and yanked a
“Just let me find him,” Draco implores again to the deafening noise of the Forest. The wind whistles around him, cold and cutting; the leaves rustle in a language Draco can’t translate; and whatever creature roams in the darkness, it sounds close. Draco cries, placing one foot in front of the other, forcing his rickety body forward. Just another step, and then one more. He just has to keep pushing. He’d keep walking forever. Draco won’t stop looking for Harry. “Please,” he whinges beseechingly.
“Harry…” Luna came from behind, her reflection matching mine on the mirror. “Are you in need of a hug?”
It started thus: ‘Todd does not like haslet or cold meats for dinner.’ and continued with a series of notes, grocery lists, and recipes with measurements like ‘small tin of flour’ and ‘big spoon’ where there were any measurements at all. Many times, it was a list of ingredients with a title and no direction. His mother had been raised on vegetable soups, Sunday roasts, homemade jams, and sandwiches.
Harry had never had an argument like this before. They understood each other. Draco kept writing Harry and visiting. It almost felt normal, like they had bypassed the fight. They even had sex once when Draco came to check a reference in the house library. Except afterwards, when Harry had almost murmured how he felt, Draco heaved a sigh and got dressed.
"With the amount of magic you expend, you'd find yourself in a Wizarding house within a few years even if you bought Muggle."
“I wish they could see I’ve changed, but I understand they don’t have to, and they might never.” He turns to Potter again, and the way their magic tries to pull each other is maddening. “Still, I will apologise and do everything I can to be better.”
Granger ignores both of them in favor of the previous topic. She snaps a finger in front of Blaise, bringing back his attention, and Harry snorts behind Draco.
"Then Oliver Wood came over from Puddlemere." Draco was clever enough to connect the dots on his own.
"Let it go, all right?" Stella said. Her breath came out in heavy pants. When their eyes met, he could tell she was barely keeping a leash on her own temper.
“No. Just by accident.” Again and again.
“Yeah.”
"They are action novels. Like spy wizards and stuff."
"There’s a portrait of Sirius’s mother behind the curtain. I can’t get rid of her."
Elle hums, nodding slowly, but says nothing else.
You fought my touch and got away, turning your back on me. “You wouldn’t like who I am outside here.”
Coach Raul's face was bright red like he had just finished screaming at someone. Harry didn't doubt it. Coach cared very little about politics. He only cared about the game, so it must have come from over his head. Harry felt his face move through about thirty expressions. "Park will start as Seeker."
Draco takes a deep breath and remembers once again he doesn’t breathe. “Me and Pansy devised a way to bring me back after a few minutes. Enough time to come to you. I knew I’d find you, because I… Harry, I bonded our souls together to find you, and keep you with me.” He presses Harry’s fingers. “My time here is limited. Pansy gave me ten minutes. And Harry… You’re coming back when I am.”
“Never mind,” the red-haired man blurts before leaving again.
So, now, arson seemed like his best bet to deal with it. He hadn’t quite figured out how he would explain it to Coach Raul or his agent Barb, but he could figure that out when he went home to Falmouth.
Like his heart is made of glass, and it’s about to break.
"You’re the expert. What am I doing wrong?" Grace asked. She was young enough Harry felt compelled to answer, correcting her grip a little.
“We can’t keep going on like this, you can’t deal with this on your own,” Harry whispers, hands cupping Draco’s. “I feel it getting closer. I want you to be happy, when I—”
to get lost in yours, though, I ended up focusing on your lips.
Harry raises a brow. “Draco, this is the place we come when we die.” His face is serious, constricted as he fights the words he doesn’t seem able to say. “Are you…?”
Lunch becomes a weekly thing.
He takes comfort in Harry’s promise and believes he’ll be back. He has to believe it. So he does what he can to make it better, to make it right.
it, like he had done with Malfoy Manor’s Tree of Life, my
Stella copied it with her customary flourish. She made it look easy, leaving her hands behind her back to hover. They tried, even shouting pointers at each other, but half of them relied on momentum and speed, and the other half found themselves wobbling, unused to balancing with the shifting of their thighs once they were upside down without their hands. Stella blew her whistle.
“Ruby?”
Harry suspected it was a way of softening the blow, but he didn't care. He liked strategy and Coach wasn't soft enough to let him fuck up to soothe Harry's ego.
"The house misses you. It is lonely. You claimed the house, but you never fully took possession in the way that matters. There is not enough of your magic in here for it to survive, and it is trying to entice you to stay." Draco talked with his hands, punctuating his words with small gestures.
his skin, turning his insides out. It feels right, so, so right to touch Harry. He needs
"Look at this," Draco said after Harry handed him a small, delicate plate with gold-scalloped edges. "It’s a commemorative plate. They’ve fallen out of fashion, but there’s something charming about them, isn’t there?"
--was the worst day of Draco’s life.
"I know Ginny. God, I’m not trying to…" Harry could feel the edge of his mood tipping fast towards something more sad than pensive. But her smile was steady, and she kicked at him again playfully.
He averts his eyes from the screen, the sight of their happiest day is too much to watch, and finishes his letter. His words, though charged with emotion, offer a sincere apology for having left so abruptly and an update on his lawyer’s contact.
, palpable and suffocating. “I’m thinking about a branch of an Alder Tree. They believed this tree possesses the power of protection, the energy to remove dark magic from your life. Can’t you see? If we can do that to Elle, isolate her magic from the dark curse, we can lift the curse and her magic will be intact. And maybe, if it works with Elle, then I can… then I can find a way to get Harry to stay permanently—”
"That’s right," Draco said.
“Not at all.”
Harry chuckles again. “It’s weird to hear you call me Harry.”
“What…?” Harry asks hoarsely.
The bridge’s wooden railing is intersected by small stone pillars, covered in a plethora of shells of varying sizes and forms. Draco skates his hand across the handrail, fingers groping the shells lightly, afraid they might either disappear at his touch or cut with their pointy edges. Nothing happens, as if he’s not touching anything at all.
Three weeks later, Granger finds Draco in the garden of their house. He has a book about ancient curses on his lap, and is sitting under the large canopy of the dogwood tree Longbottom had helped him and Harry plant when they had first moved in.
"The house will take care of it for now," Draco told him as they tried to figure out where Harry was going to put a Goldstein full-size concert piano that had belonged to his mother shipped with a long letter in Russian.
Harry studies him with attentive eyes, curious and dark, but not pitiful. He says, “I’m still sorry I hurt you.”
"Yes," Pansy answered.
“It feels safe around you,” Harry says apropos of nothing, and hands a cup for Draco to dry, who almost drops it on the floor.
Elle closes her eyes, heaving a heavy sigh. “I want to do it,” she whispers. “Even if it doesn’t work.”
“Just give him some space. He’ll come around.” Something in her pointed glance tells him she knows about the letters he sent, but none of them bring it up.
Harry ignored him. He waited until they were up to start slow circles to search. He saw the Snitch hover for a second by Oliver. He dived, almost catching it, when a Bludger blindsided him from where Louis had been and knocked Harry off-course with a loud crack, and his head snapped to the front. The stadium all groaned as one.
"Together?" Stella said with a tsk tsk. "
“I mean, I bought it. And it’s ours. And we’ll be happy here,” he clarifies, watching with amusement as Harry’s jaw falls to the floor. “Will you marry me?”
He’s hurt so many people in the past, and yes, he’s trying to change, but... he doesn’t know if he trusts himself with it.
Draco considered it for a moment, long fingers tapping on the bannister.
Despite the urgency and magic starvation that has taken him since he made the bond with an unconscious Harry, fear clutches his skin, holding him back. If Harry decides he doesn’t like what he sees in Draco today, that’s it, there’s no other hope for him. Everything will be over.
Despite Harry’s reluctance, he accepts Draco’s advice to drop out of college. Given the way he’s been missing classes, he won’t get far, though it’s hard to admit how hard things have become that Harry can’t… live his life like he used to.
His exchanges with his cousin have become somewhat scarce since Harry woke up, and that’s not something he can blame Teddy for. Draco’s the one who’s been avoiding anyone who’s had contact with Harry.
, he tells himself, acknowledging this for the lie it is. He needs to appease his own heart.
Fiona beams behind them. Draco can’t move, can’t speak, and he just watches in awe as Harry himself picks the ring up and slides it to his finger, like the world is right. Like everything will be fine.
, his brain supplies unhelpfully,
"Jan’s dad has a red Ferrari convertible. It has a button, and the top goes down by itself. It goes really fast."
He glances over to the pile of books about magical core and curses on his table, and at the note again.
The alley he Apparates to in Islington is small and dark. The walk to The Red Hart is short, but filled with imaginative scenarios of the
Harry finds him surrounded by those books. Half-lidded eyes are trying to focus on the words he’s reading, their concept being almost entirely lost by his exhausted brain.
"I like the gold," Draco said, tapping his own fingernails. "Also I didn’t think you still wore the glasses." Draco was, of course, wearing his glasses.
"Dinner," Draco said. He was still smiling when he turned to the stairs.
"Beautiful day to fly," Harry answered. They chatted for a moment before Harry kicked off with standard warm-up drills. He worked on a few basic manoeuvres and climbing speed. Grace practised diving again and again, and Harry watched her for a bit.
It’s only once he’s out that the realisation finally dawns on him. It worked. His spell worked. Elle is
"I'm sorry," Pansy said. She was immediately subdued.
“This is between Harry and me. The less you know…”
“I am… I was his husband!”
That’s not cake. Is it
They caught their breath, still gazing at each other, even as Draco leant back slowly and they finally broke apart. Harry’s heart cartwheeled in his chest as he took a moment to admire Draco in a state of dishevelment, the watery winter afternoon sun slanting over his face like a painting meant to show off the artist’s mastery of light. Draco’s eyes didn’t leave Harry.
“You look... better.” She struggles to find the word.
"Percy’s working late with budget negotiations. Where?"
He has to do something.
"I don't know," Draco replied. Draco's shirt was buttoned up wrong. He shoved his hand in his pocket roughly and pushed his hair back from his face with the other.
Draco feels Harry’s fear of being alone, but Harry assures him he’ll be fine.
Harry thought Percy before the war as stuffy and boring. Percy after the war had a glint in his eye, like his restraint was covering for something far more dangerous. There was a time Harry would have bet against Percy. But Harry believed now Percy would throw a punch if he thought that was the only thing George would understand.
In the end, their party gathered at least 200 guests—most of whom were Weasleys from all over the world. It was displayed in all the papers the next morning, but Draco and Harry were far away on their honeymoon, too busy with each other to be bothered about the press' conspiracies about Draco using a love potion on Harry.
“You must be Julie,” Draco barges in, still smiling and pointing at the dark-haired girl. Then, one by one he tries to name them from what Harry has told him over the last few months. “Mark,” he points his chin at the man who just spoke, who nods, and then turns to the other two, who also confirm when Draco says, “Hannah and Elio?”
Harry reached forward, but felt no more resistance than air when he scooped up the cup. He unwrapped the newspaper and let it fall to the floor. It was glazed earthenware, a vivid red. He handed it to Draco, who was able to grasp it without the expected pain.
He’s not sure he’d have kept going if he had got the choice, but he understands Luna’s attachment to the place. Each of them had found their own ways to cope with the wounds of the war. Draco had thought his to be going to the group therapy. But he later found out that being with Harry was healing, too. Luna’s was being there, helping people, and being surrounded by that kind of positive energy that always seemed to beam off her. She’s always loved it in the centre. He remembered thinking that place
Draco nods.
Harry stays frozen in place, eyes almost white, glazed. Draco can’t give in to despair, or he won’t come back.
Draco and Harry both often deal with it with facetious remarks, too afraid to acknowledge what the problem truly means.
Harry wrote to Headmistress McGonagall to see who did the Hogwarts repairs, only to learn Draco Malfoy was responsible for some of the trickier restoration work. Other attempts to find someone else also went poorly.
From the content of Harry’s message and the disgraceful amount of typos, Draco’s half aware of the state he might find his boyfriend (the word has a nice ring to it and he can’t keep the smile off his face) in.
Sometimes, it seemed like Harry’s crush might be reciprocated.
He takes a stool and orders two more glasses of whisky—not his favourite, but he’s pretty much going with whatever Blaise wants tonight. That’s when someone sits by his side.
"I know," Draco said. If that was as close as they could get to talking about it, that was okay. Harry wasn't much good at talking. He pushed Draco's hair aside, brushed his lips against his brow damp with sweat.
Draco is invited to come back. He's not sure if he will, but he promises to think about it. It’s good seeing Marvin again and looking at that part of his past, seeing it's not as bad as his mind paints it to be. But Draco’s not eager to go back to that. This is a closed chapter of his life. He just needs to convince himself that Harry is one too.
"Who said it’s an English name?" Min-woo asked. They all nodded in serious consideration.
“Me too.” Especially when Harry says it like
Draco cannot think about how
He takes a deep breath, and it seems to spark Potter’s curiosity. Potter crosses his arms tightly over his chest and worries his lower lip while staring at Draco.
Then, Harry says, “I’m sorry about your mother,” and Draco almost cries.
Teddy did.
The idea made Harry queasy, although he knew magic involving blood wasn’t always Dark magic.
, he tells himself. Harry isn’t here because he feels sorry for Draco, though that’s what he claims. Draco knows what he feels, he’s had to deal with it for too long. This is probably too much for Harry to handle, he reasons. He shouldn’t force his own feelings on Harry, he just doesn’t know how to stop.
Draco sounded amused when he whispered back, "No you aren't, darling." And then rougher, "You can take it." Harry's response was choked on a long moan.
Pansy greets him with a grin instead of pity this time, and the tightness in his chest loosens a little. She’s not alone, though, and Draco’s eyes are immediately attracted to the familiar figure leaning against his table. Blaise has his hands in his pockets and is carrying a soft smile, looking like everything is right with the world. Draco wishes he had his confidence right now.
So this year, Harry had decided to tackle the problem that was Grimmauld Place.
Harry pulls away, frowning, and murmurs, “It’s not.” But it sounds like a lie.
"Bad game?" Draco asked, standing in the doorway of Harry’s bedroom. He looked like Harry felt. Back in black, again stripped of all adornment, the delicate purple shadows under his eyes like a bruise. The only colour was the runes on his forearm.
Once, Harry had told Draco that what they felt was infinite. No matter where they were, their love would still live inside them, of their hearts, their memories. Their lives were intertwined. They’d be forever living the same moments, again and again, at a point in time.
ran a photo on page two, after ‘Falcons Going to Final’. Harry never read the article. Pansy said she sent it to Millie for the retractions. Barb sent him a card that flashed trailblazer in big sparkly letters. Draco said it was a fine piece of fiction, but "seeing how we haven’t been fucking since we were fourteen, largely inaccurate."
Harry rolls his eyes, but he’s still smiling, so Draco counts that as a victory.
"And keeping the Ancient House of Black alive is important to you, is it?" Harry asked, a bit annoyed. Harry thought if Sirius had to do all of this, he would have just burnt this place to the ground.
He is standing still, his foot tapping the floor anxiously, as Pansy disperses the crowd that has formed there and calls for Hermione.
"It's Draco Malfoy?" Ginny guessed.
It takes a few seconds for the truth to dawn on her and Draco waits for it in silence. Then she’s fuming, eyes wide and cheeks a deep red, contrasting with her pale skin. He wonders if he should not have waited to finally confess. “What?!”
“Yes.”
"No, just saying hello," Draco said. "I heard about your injury." Harry was certain people on other planets had heard of his injury. He had shoved the wireless in a kitchen drawer to stop hearing about it.
"Do you think it was wise to swear at the referee?" Harry looked past this reporter at Pansy. Even she looked pissed off, and somehow that gave Harry the willingness to give an appropriate answer.
"There are two ways forward. We can try to remake the tapestry, or we can store it. Normally, you would have to send this off to a professional. But because I am a blood relation, and the Black tapestry recognises blood, I can do it."
The name seems to escape Harry’s lips so easily he doesn’t even notice it. Not until Draco’s blushing furiously. His eyes widen a bit as he watches Draco rushing out of the room before he can fall to tears in front of Harry.
“What happened?” he asks, moving back a step and pulling the door completely open, heart clenching at the sight. “Weren’t you with the Weasleys?”
The wine glass he’s holding was the one Harry had gotten him after breaking nearly all of Draco’s finer glasses. The material is a bit thick and stretchy, with all the spells Harry had put in it to make sure it wouldn't break like the others.
Draco is divorced. There’s no chance he’ll get Harry back. He’s alone. Again.
beating so fast.
"Get your own." Blaise popped half a biscuit in his mouth and made a face he probably thought made him look like he was seriously considering something. Harry rolled his eyes.
That fucking drawer full of bathing suits Draco never exhibited on his body, because they never got their Caribbean vacation, only screams to him how Harry always asked him to try them on, again and again, in spite of the fact they were never put to use.
“I’m... sorry,” he says, voice cracking and forcing him to start again. “Thank you, but no.”
"Maybe," Draco conceded.
Draco can’t find his voice anymore.
She frowns, eyes moving swiftly across the room until she finally catches sight of Draco standing by her side.
, Pansy had said.
Harry took him to Dishoom because he preferred the Muggle world when it came to things like that. No chance of disruptions, unlikely to be photographed. It was cold but still a nice, ambling walk over.
Harry had a full day with Draco then, parsing through the work plan. Draco went through every step: expansion, purging unwanted furniture, ward stripping, ward building, anchor objects, integration, and settling. Draco built out a work plan that would take longer than six months.
"No," Harry said. "That's not why." They left it at that.
Draco left a long note for Harry detailing the rebuilt wards and requesting a meeting to finalise them, so Harry cleared out some time on his schedule now that training camp was winding down.
had to die if he were to be vanquished.”
Draco just...
Draco doesn’t say as much, but both of them know what’s keeping him awake at night, what’s eating up his energy and wearing down his magic.
“I think I know what happened to your tree,” Granger announces.
"He’s fine."
Where would he go without Harry? What would he do, and who would he be?
"It’s getting late," Draco said. "Thank you for the wine."
“Hello, Harry,” he greets. When Harry only slightly recoils at the sound of his voice, Draco continues. “Thank you for meeting with me. I realize this might be difficult, and...”
"I don’t normally do this with people who work for me," Harry said. Draco gave a surprised bark of laughter.
"On the weekends. We’re barely a league," he said, a little shy.
“I’m fine,” he argues one last time. And then Harry’s words once again echo in his head.
When Pansy bursts into the room, shutting the door behind her, Draco is still paralysed on the floor. It’s not Harry’s magic keeping him still, although the smothering energy threatening to burn the room is disconcerting enough. He’s never done that before. Harry’s never directed his wild, angry, uncontrolled magic towards Draco. Not like this.
"You’ll be home all week then?" Draco asked. He was worrying his bottom lip between his teeth so fiercely, Harry wanted to put his thumb there to stop it.
The season always slowed down in the winter. Even with state-of-the-art climate charm systems and warming benches, it was harder to get fans into seats, and over time, the games dwindled until it almost felt like a mid-season break.
"Wasn’t that also the year you spent in love with Malfoy and Nott?" Adrian asked. He managed to sound scandalised, even though he had draped himself sideways over Miles' lap. Theo looked amused as he drank his wine and ordered food for the table.
Draco sighs with relief, taking a sip of his coffee. The bitterness burns his throat, awakens his body. He closes his eyes, welcoming it with a moan.
"And Hogwarts houses normally run in families," Teddy continued. Draco nodded.
The stabilising dome collapses at the same time as his Stasis spell fades, having nothing to hold on to anymore.
"Dear, we talked about this. You should let Ron help with the food," Arthur said.
Luna was dealing with her own doubts and anxiety, as I dealt with mine. We met in the middle. She understood because she had the same kind of despair, of fear.
"Good to know," Harry said.
The last drawing Harry had made of him.
"Magical house renovations," Harry admitted. Min-woo winced. "Not as bad as it sounds, but it’s taking longer than I would have hoped. At least there’s a professional involved now."
He finds Potter a bit later, after they've put away the chairs. His back is pressed against the exterior wall of the building as he shields himself from the heavy rain falling upon them, a half-burnt cigarette hanging from his fingers and a small grey cat lounging by his feet. He's staring at the sky, and the light coming from the inside frames his body against the darkened street.
"Ah, if you want to be serious, I better put you down," Ron said. He lowered Rose while she shrieked in delight.
"And you do how many of those a day?"
"Tell Stella I said hello," Ginny called.
“You see me almost every week,” Draco argues with no veritable force, but Blaise only laughs, pushing the door, and doesn’t reply.
“I see. Is that why…?” Harry hovers his index finger between them, raising an eyebrow.
"We can sell some of these, right?" He was interested in vintage Snitch (several, James Potter), and even the handwoven Potter family map. He was not interested in teeth (mostly creature, assorted).
"It’s not forever," Harry said instead.
“Yes. It’s beautiful. Does it bother you?”
Harry wasn’t exaggerating when he said the place was empty. The flat looks devoid of life, the only sign of something magical, something as lively as Harry, are the green lit flames in the hearth. Apart from the couch in a stark living room, a lone table floating in the kitchen, and fewer boxes than he’d expected, the only other piece of furniture Harry has is a bed. There’s ample space, though, and Draco bets it’ll be beautiful once Harry seriously considers and works on decorating it.
“Couldn’t you... I thought your mother lived there now?” Harry closes the space between them, sliding an arm around Draco’s waist, almost dislodging Ruby.
“No buts, Draco! We have all, you included, paid too high a price to let our vigilance falter. I shouldn’t have to remind you,
He takes one deep breath, then another, ignoring the way the air stings his lungs like the sharpened edges of daggers.
Draco still doesn’t know what to say, and it seems as if every polite exchange has escaped his grasp. He should probably brew some tea, but he can’t get his feet to move, or his eyes to avert their gaze from Harry’s beautiful figure in his—
"Do you think I can’t write the letter?" Harry asked. He was confused as to Percy’s opposition when he went by Pansy and Percy’s place for dinner. It was tense. They had clearly been arguing right up until the moment Harry rang the doorbell.
To say he’s freaking out about meeting Harry’s Muggle friends from college is putting it mildly. Draco could not focus at work for almost the entire week, his mind providing disastrous scenarios.
It was not. It’s the magic he’s tapped into, awake and electrifying. Malfoy's Crann Bethadh is dead, but he
"You’re not going to replace it with my blood, are you?" Harry asked gruffly. Draco turned away from the wall to search his expression, appraising. He turned back.
“I heard of a place in South America. A small, hidden paradise. And I came here.” Harry’s voice blankets him so softly, Draco can stay here forever. “This is where I stayed longer. Here is where I got my tattoo. It’s a small island on the coast of Brazil. Only fifty souls lived there, but they didn’t seem to mind me that much. At night it felt like I was alone in the universe.”
And then he registers it.
His hand shakily holds his wand, pointing at the mess on the floor. But he’s not really burning anything. He can’t. Even if it feels like fire is the only thing that makes sense. It’s wild and destructive, and he’s sure it will erase everything he knows to be his old life.
It doesn’t work like that. Forgetting is not an option, he realised, hiding in his flat, constantly haunted by memories that turned into nightmares, and then into memories again. A long and distant cry for help no one heard, the burning tip of a wand marring his skin, and his mother’s tears. Draco can never forget and may never forgive himself.
This becomes a routine. After a session, they walk around the neighborhood while Draco rants about his work. He tries not to reveal too much about all the hate he still gets, focusing on more ordinary difficulties, like a particularly hard patient he’s got for the last few weeks, or how distasteful he finds coffee they serve in the cafeteria. Sometimes, they go to a cafe near the centre. Draco always drinks black coffee—a habit he’s picked up from his boss, Healer Cameron—and Potter drinks tea with sugar and more milk than should be allowed, while sketching in his notebook.
Neither of them bring it up again until Draco wraps up his appointment with Elle and he and Harry walk out of the room, leaving the girl resting on the bed.
Draco opens his mouth, ready to object. He’s the one that failed as a son. He didn’t take care of his mother like he should have. He gave up on years of legacy, and he can’t ever be the Malfoy she expects him to be.
Had no memory of--
Harry let Draco’s words rattle around his chest for the rest of the week, and he didn’t like it.
part in each other's lives now. The thought comforts Draco, but it doesn’t seem to have the same effect on Harry.
husband.
He stiffens once Draco walks in. His expression is at ease, though his cheeks are pink and his posture tense. Draco raises an eyebrow, but it's the song on Harry’s phone that gets his attention.
Hermione’s grin brightens when she tells him she and Pansy are talking about having children, and that it’s still premature and they’re not sure how to approach it and are insecure about being mothers—
He looks at his friends, and they’re talking, but all he can hear is an endless array of
Draco blinks at the pie once before staring at Mia’s sympathetically creased lips. Warmth spreads inside his chest. “Yeah, me too. But Harry doesn’t think so right now.”
Harry committed to memory the slow streak of orange and pink in the fading daylight. George left first, saying he had an early start. Then went Percy, Bill until there were only a few of them left. With the remaining people, Harry enjoyed the warm breeze, the company, and the last couple pints in a row he would likely have for a while.
"Can you imagine if Renfrew had caught one of us in the broom closet with a team member when he was Captain?" Harry asked. He snorted, and Stella let out a long laugh.
Draco wishes he could reply with this, but it’d be a lie their souls would pick up instantly. If Harry hadn’t crossed his path, depressed and broken two years after the war, Draco is not sure if they’d have ended up here, if he’d have fallen for him, transforming the obsession of years into something healing and beautiful.
The Hogwarts Express stands beside them on the tracks. It’s so still and silent, Draco doubts for a second that it's really there. There’s no colour to it. The vivid red of the cars that his childish mind worshipped for years is now a pallid grey.
"It’s not that simple," Draco said. His tone was placating as if he was humouring Harry, as if Harry was being unreasonable for not wanting to live in a constant state of surprise with food, artefacts, and Merlin knew what else popping up. Harry gritted his teeth.
Draco looked away. "Ah, no. It would have taken too much time," he murmured.
“Yes!” Pansy agrees animatedly. “Hogwarts always feels like a home to everyone, right?” All of them nod. “It’s because it’s made of our magic, of parts of us. It can sense the needs of those it shelters.”
Harry studies him for a long moment, before he shifts in his chair and gets up. “Not at all. I just came to see my physiotherapist and Elle saw me and called me in.”
Harry laughed. The conversation spiralled out of control again.
Hermione raises a brow, but slowly a shy smile spreads across her face as she perks up a bit.
“What is this?” Pansy’s voice is low, closer now.
“That’s bad for your health,” Draco murmurs, and is granted with a soft grin from Harry.
"Isn’t there a spell?" Harry asked. "The one for distilling." Chances were, Draco remembered this charm too.
"My godfather Sirius Black gave it to me upon his death. It had been his mother’s house. We used it during the war." Draco made another listening noise. "Dumbledore tested it to make sure it had passed to me." Harry said defensively. He disliked the implication that the house wasn’t his. It was his. It was all he had left of his godfather.
to Harry?! What did you do? Why don’t Hermione or I know about it?”
A genuine smile came through. "I’ll show you in the garden."
I wasn’t certain what she meant: her clothes and makeup or going to the party. And no, I wasn’t positive about neither. But I knew she wouldn’t ask further, and that was quite what I needed at that point.
Draco walked to the doorway of his practice room before turning back to face Harry.
Harry was standing half of a meter away from him, and somehow Draco’s instrument was now on the desk. He didn't remember putting it there. Harry looked into Draco’s eyes, and Draco felt wetness on his cheeks. He started to reach up to wipe it away but Harry had beat him to it, closing the distance between them in less than an instant and swiping his thumb over Draco’s cheek with unexpected gentleness. Draco was stunned. He didn’t think Harry even knew what he was doing.
“Uh, yeah. Thanks. I’ll probably just go by myself, but I appreciate the thought, Draco. I’d like to enjoy the music without the pressure of someone else."
Draco didn’t know why he'd even said that. He almost stopped himself mid-sentence to take it back, but then figured it would be better to say it. Harry was a man who had his own interests. He always had. Harry wasn’t interested in him that way, and never had been. If he had, things would have gone differently, and maybe things wouldn't have ended the way they did. Maybe he wouldn't have those scars.
“Don’t get your knickers in a twist, Draco. We’re both adults, aren’t we? Let's move past all that, yeah? I’m already sitting at your table. It’s a bit late for getting upset about past fights between us when we were kids.” Draco nodded and turned to face Harry, leaning against the kitchen counter. He supposed that Harry was right and that maybe getting upset about an old habit wasn’t worth the energy.
“Earl grey is perfect. Leave the bag and put a bit of milk in, as well, please.” Draco nodded. He liked his tea strong as well.
“I have earl grey, black, oolong, and jasmine.” The stranger pulled his hair out of his face, and Draco finally got a good look at him. He was definitely familiar, but Draco could not place him just yet. He’d have to get his name.
“No, I don’t believe so. I saw a quartet, once, at a wedding. But I don’t think that’s the same thing.” Draco released a breath he didn’t realize he was holding.
(See the end of the chapter for
Potter had certainly matured, had filled out his lanky limbs, and was no longer awkward-looking. He was a man, no longer a teenager as he had been the last time they saw each other. Potter had been there at Draco’s trial in front of the Wizengamot, had stood witness and testified in favor of Draco’s innocence. It was probably due to Potter, Draco had long ago accepted, that he hadn’t been sent to Azkaban with his father. Still, Draco thought, why was he here now? Sitting at his kitchen table and having tea with him?
The man waiting outside was someone who looked vaguely familiar, so Draco lowered his wand slightly to his side.
“You really don’t recognize me? I know it’s been years, but I didn’t think I’d changed that much.” He paused, looking Draco over. “I suppose you’ve matured quite a bit. I guess seeing yourself in the mirror every day doesn’t do much justice for the passage of time and its effects.” He chuckled to himself, and Draco grew irritated. This guy had some nerve just acting like Draco should know who he is. He’s entitled, that’s for sure, Draco thought. The stranger spoke again after a few moments, “Merlin, Draco, it’s Harry. Harry Potter.”
“What am I supposed to say, Potter? ‘Thanks for swinging by?’ I never thought I’d have to see you again, you half-wit. That’s a bit of the reason I chose to settle here in muggle London, rather than stay in the realm of which I’d be exposed to you on a basis more often than never.” Draco said the words with a level f harshness that he regretted the moment they left his mouth. He hadn’t meant to fall into the rut of insults. He’d tried to move past that part of himself. But, it seemed, the appearance of Harry Potter had made him fall back into old habits. He caught himself quickly before he could do more damage. He straightened his posture and took a deep breath. “Sorry, Po-Harry. I didn’t mean to lash out. That wasn’t mature of me.” He stood from his place at the table and took Harry’s mug into the kitchen, trying to avoid eye contact. “I just didn’t expect to be met with you anytime soon. Or ever.” He heard Harry chuckle and he glanced back at him
Draco picked up his violin, held the instrument upright for a few moments and inspected it. Everything looked normal, as it always did. He wandlessly summoned both his bow and shoulder rest from their respective places in the room, catching them with practiced ease in one hand. He quickly equipped his shoulder rest, the same one he had bought when he started his private tutoring. He tightened his bow mindlessly, knowing the correct tension of the hair by feeling alone. He brought the violin to his shoulder and rang out on his open strings, tuning them slowly and with more precision than completely necessary. He didn’t need to take time on these things, he had perfect pitch. His brain automatically knew whether the note was flat or sharp, and by the decibel by which it had to adjust. And yet, he tuned for five agonizing minutes. This was how he would dip into his practice for the day. This was how he would encourage himself to do what he knew he’d love himself for later. The specific concerto he’d be performing in less than two days’ time was one that he, in particular, chose for it’s emotional release. When he played, it was cathartic. He didn’t even have to think about phrasing, or fingerings, or dynamics. It simply came to him as naturally as breathing or walking. And playing his instrument was similar to these things, he realized. His emotional release primarily happened when he played. That’s one of the reasons he found himself picking his instrument up more than once a day for the past few weeks. Regardless of his upcoming performance, it was the fact that the fifth anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts was coming up. Five years since that fateful day.
Harry squeezed Draco’s hand before sliding it out of Draco’s loose grasp. Draco was surprised by how he missed the warmth, however brief it had been. Draco gathered himself quickly and moved away from Harry, feeling a heat begin to rise on the back of his neck. He didn’t often feel those kinds of emotions, the kinds that left a tinge of embarrassment with them. He didn’t like it.
“Harry? You’re... You’re quite close, yeah? Your magic’s gone all into mine... I can feel it...” Harry’s eyes were not glazed over, upon closer inspection, as Draco had expected.
“Will you at least say something? The look you’re giving me is kind of creeping me out.” That statement set Draco off.
“Well, things work out how they’re meant to, yeah? I don’t particularly favor women, for one, and it’s a bit difficult to find blokes ‘round here who won’t shit themselves at the idea of a wizard. I’ve had to Obliviate more muggles than I’d care to admit.” Harry looked lost in thought for a moment before coming back into his wits.
Draco definitely hadn’t been expecting that. Once the words had been said and processed in Draco’s brain, it all clicked into place. It was most definitely Harry who sat in front of him, there was no denying that. Once Draco connected the dots, the familiarity was there in the fashion of Potter’s nose and eyes. Those same eyes that helped Draco to identify him in Malfoy Manor all of those years ago.
The instrument almost glared at him. His shoulder rest sat stranded on the stool he often sat at when annotating his sheet music, and his recently-rehaired bow was hanging on a hook at the other end of the room. Taking one look at him, the state of the room, and the placement of the instrument, it would be easy to assume Draco didn’t want to practice. That assumption would be correct.
“So, Harry, do you prefer birds or blokes? Since I’ve already gone and given myself away, I figure it’s fair you do the same.” Draco tried to be casual about the tone with which he asked this question, but he couldn’t deny he was anxious to know the answer. It made his neck start to warm even more, and he clenched his jaw with anticipation of Harry's answer. Harry’s ears took on a slight pink, but he was too far away from Draco for him to notice. He was thankful.
“I swing either way. Remember, I dated Ginny those years ago? I took up a bit of self-exploration afterward and found myself with some faceless bloke in his flat, and ended up liking it more than I anticipated. So, uh, yeah.” Draco nodded, the clench of his jaw relaxing as he turned away from Harry and brought his left hand up to the neck of his instrument. He didn’t know why Harry being a bisexual brought him so much relief. It really wasn’t his business who Harry was shagging, nor was it his business who he was dating. But he found himself wanting to ask these questions. Maybe it was because Harry had brought it up. Draco thought it seemed only fair for a round of questioning on his part if Harry would be surprised that he, Draco Malfoy, was not taken by anybody. Instead of pondering on those thoughts for longer than the 5 seconds he did, he brought his bow to the strings and began to tune his instrument for the second time that day. There was barely a difference from when he had tuned earlier in the morning, but he chose to be deliberate with the twists of the pegs once again.
The stranger seemed shocked by Draco’s response. His eyes widened, and his mouth opened slightly before closing again. He seemed to have the moment of realization that Draco didn’t know who he was. He took five seconds to gather himself -- Draco counted -- and then spoke with a reserved tone.
“It’s still a bit early to be knocking on people’s doors, innit?” Draco said. His tone was casual, but had a tinge of annoyance. The familiar-stranger let out a breathy chuckle, his hair falling into his eyes.
Draco and the familiar-stranger had been sitting in a mostly-comfortable silence for five minutes. Draco had made himself a cup of tea, but it sat on the kitchen table, getting cold, next to his abandoned muggle book. The man was sitting in a relaxed fashion, with a look on his face like he was expecting something. Another five minutes passed before the stranger finished his tea, and set the mug down with a muffled ‘clunk’ on the table, muffled in a way that was intentional via a wandless, wordless charm. Draco didn’t understand the deliberacy in that action. Why muffle the sound of a mug hitting the table? This stranger was even odder than just the fact that he had no reservations of entering someone’s apartment before 10 in the morning, simply because he enjoyed the sounds of classical music. Draco had never had such a strange morning. Finally, after an agonizing wait, the stranger spoke up.
He had to leave that in the past. Harry was simply trying to make amends with someone who had been through a rough time, to sympathize and make nice. Harry had every right to enjoy the music Draco made without wanting anything more. Draco had to accept that.
Draco stepped back once, twice, and tried to pull his magic back into himself. He knew what it was like to share his magic with another thing -- his instrument -- but he had never done it with another person. The feeling was foreign and, while pleasant, not something Draco was particularly interested in continuing. It felt jarring to collect himself that way, to push Harry’s magic out of his own and pull his back into his field. But it felt safer that way. Harry made a sour expression when Draco did that and he took his own steps back, three to be exact. They were five paces apart.
“Yeah, I’m aware. I can feel it, too, yknow... It’s as much mine in yours as yours is in mine...” Draco felt the heat rising on his neck again, and Harry stepped even closer. They were breathing each other’s air now, and Draco could smell the tea on Harry’s breath. He closed his eyes.
“Really? You’d think it’d be an easier bit to accept. I’ve had a couple of shags where a bit of magic was appreciated. But maybe that’s ‘cause I was in a more... niche setting.” Draco was confused by the phrasing Harry chose but brushed it off. He was more concerned about who Harry preferred to shag since he’d already had to expose his own preferences for who he took to bed.
He didn’t know when he had begun to play. All he knew was that by the time he had finished the first movement, he was crying. The tears had started of their own volition around rehearsal marker 5, and had continued until the end. This was often how his practice went, an unknown start and a teary end. He decided to continue, picking up into the second movement with no extra thought. He had to play through the entire thing at least once before he’d allow himself to eat breakfast.
“I s’pose so. I just couldn’t help but be intrigued by the music I heard coming from your residence. It was magical.” Draco inwardly cringed at the choice of words. This man was most certainly a wizard, and a powerful one at that. Draco could feel their magic beginning to intermingle in the small space between them. He looked the stranger over. He seemed to still be in his pyjamas, not unlike Draco. The stranger did, however, not tame his hair before coming to investigate the happenings of his neighbors. Draco scoffed before closing his door enough to undo the chain. He opened the door wider, sliding his wand into his pocket. As much as he wanted to be alone, he was also desperate for the company of anyone. He didn’t often have visitors.
“It’s alright, don’t apologize. I don’t often have the room to let my magic go like that. I’m alone when I play, usually, and when I’m not I’m ‘round muggles. Don’t think more about it.” He gathered himself before turning back, putting on a smile. “I’m glad you enjoyed my playing. I’ve got a recital the day after tomorrow. I’d like to see you there?” Harry seemed surprised by the offer but a smile cracked onto his face.
That's all for now! Thanks for reading, and a new chapter will be up as soon as a write it!
Ah, the inner monologue of the musician. A frustrated one, no less. A recital in one of the largest muggle concert halls in Britain, and yet, here stands Draco Malfoy in his makeshift practice room debating on whether or not he wants to even look at the music for his concerto. It’s not that he needed to look, at this point, it’s that he probably should have it out for the sake of continuity. The principle of the thing, so to speak. He had barely unpacked his instrument - a new-to-him Strad copy that he may or may not have altered with a spell to have just that bit more resonance, to give that extra quality to make it a truer sound to a Strad. He hadn’t the money or reputation for a real Strad, yet. But he’d get there.
He pushed off of the counter and went to stand in front of Harry, looking into the same green eyes he had all those years ago when his fate was no longer in his own hands. He stuck out his hand for Harry to shake, and Harry smiled as he took Draco’s hand in his own. Draco was surprised by how soft Harry’s skin was, how easily their hands slotted together. He had almost expected his own hand to be dwarfed by Harry’s, but it was such that his hand was simply more lithe than Harry’s. Harry had the hands of someone familiar with more laborious work -- Harry was an Auror, of course, his hands would be adept for those things -- and Draco had the hands of a musician. It seemed simple to think, really, but it took Draco by surprise.
Sibelius, Prokofiev, Tchaikovsky, Beethoven, Bach, Rachmaninoff, Mozart, Chopin, Brahms, Debussy. The list continues, as it always does, when one needs to decide what to practice. The muscle-memory of the ways that fingers can glide across the strings of an instrument needs to be consistently sharpened, as all skills do. With music, there is always room to grow. There are always ways in which one can connect and interpret the notes, beyond what the composer may have intended. The notes on the page exist as a starting point, the indications of style more of a suggestion than anything else. Stay within the barriers of the time period, but include your own phrasing and interpretation. A constant paradox of expression, balance, and requirements. Who says one needs to even follow what’s on the page? Most of these men haven’t been alive for centuries.
I hope this is enough tugging on your heartstrings to satisfy. I'm not sure if Harry's magic is the culprit of Draco's feelings, or if it's just Draco...
“So, are you not going to ask what I’m doing here? In muggle London?” Draco was a bit off-put. He figured for some of the same reasons as himself -- to get away from the fast-paced manner of the wizarding world. To get away from expectations. But the stranger seemed like there was more to it.
He was having one of his off days. Those days when everything from his past would sneak up on him and unload it’s baggage right into his vulnerable brain. The days when the scars that curved ever-so-gracefully around his body would stick out more in the mirror, or they’d feel tighter than usual, regardless of how pliant the skin had become. It was one of the days when he’d consider the path he took, and if it was right for him. On this day in particular, he was sure it was right. He didn’t think he’d be allowed to be this successful back in the wizarding sector of Britain, not after who he’d managed to become in those last years of his schooling. He’d managed to disappear after that. He’d managed to make himself into somebody who was successful, and even revered in his community for his talents. He’d always been musically gifted, just never allowed the room to truly flourish. Upon his entrance into the muggle world, he found a private tutor to help him become again-acquainted with the violin; from there, he blossomed. Draco Malfoy had managed to become a well-enough-known violinist in the muggle world to be paid several thousands per performance. It paid the bills, which was what he had initially been after. He had started over, and made a new life. His small flat was enough for him, so long as he had enough room to stretch and be himself.
We were at PRTND again the following week.
at being a Healer, he can’t not be one any longer when he’s so lost about everything else.
selling many things you could imagine and some you wouldn’t. Quite lucrative, apparently. Here is a preliminary list with the last known whereabouts. Anyone with a tick, I’ve already contacted as I focused on furnishings."
Harry closes the distance between them after a beat, the heat of his lips almost there, not really touching Draco. The imprint of contact is enough to have the hair on Draco’s skin standing on end.
Harry’s voice is muffled, but Draco is sure he’d be able to hear it even if they weren’t pressed so close together. “I’m fine here.”
Draco can’t make out what he’s feeling, he can’t make what
Harry looked across the room where Draco and Oliver Wood’s boyfriend Winston latched onto each other to talk about some obscure academic thing that made Harry’s ears buzz like someone had cast a
Harry is immediately by his side again, fingers laced through Draco’s. “You’re not a coward. You may have been in the past, but you’re not now. I know that.”
Draco pointed one long finger at
Though he’s afraid this is still a nightmare, he gropes around on the bed until his fingers take a hold of the warm figure by his side.
But, despite the simple
“Draco?” Pansy calls.
"About me?" Harry repeated. He had heard it all before, he reminded himself. Heckling was as old as Quidditch. He had wondered what they said, but he could guess, and sometimes his guesses were nicer than the shit he heard. League HQ could say whatever they wanted about zero tolerance, but that was if they caught the player.
Just like he loves the mug Draco got for him. He’s so protective of it, Draco doesn’t understand at first why there’s tea under a stasis charm filling it. Harry rarely likes the taste of things under stasis charms.
They ascended a hidden staircase that groaned with age, all the way up to the dusty attic. Harry sneezed three times, and, after opening a window, the house swept the dust all out in a fit of shame.
"My left ankle?"
"Good follow through," said Luc. He lifted Atty’s bruised knuckle to his lips and kissed it. The Healers must have not seen to her yet. She waved him off, though the rest of the locker room catcalled. After his Healer check, Harry did his cooldown on the mat by himself instead of on the stationary bikes with the team.
He turned to Draco for help, for support. He trusts Draco like this.
Draco wears his most casual outfit. It’s been years since he put on those jeans, though, and the memory of Harry devouring him with his eyes whenever he wore them makes Draco now transfigure the piece to something almost entirely different. The new trousers—still jeans, but brighter and ripped—feel wonky as he pulls them on, but they match the coal button-up shirt he wears.
His mind doesn’t quite compute all the meaning behind what he reads, fuzzy and intoxicated, but there’s something oddly compelling about his ancestors’ wedding rituals.
Draco doesn’t ask why Harry is really here with him, though he’s itching to. Harry offers the answer freely when they’re washing the dishes together after dinner.
"Yes, Captain."
"Luna!" Harry said with delight and hugged her. She looked with obvious interest from Draco to Harry, but said nothing beyond ‘hullo’ with two fluttering kisses to Draco’s cheek.
"How’s the post-budget round up, Hermione?" Draco asked.
Right. Ten minutes, Pansy had said. He has ten minutes here to find Harry and bring him home from whatever this place is.
"Thanks Coach," went a mutter around the group. They all headed to the showers, and everyone was quieter than usual. They stripped out of their kits, headed to the Floos or Apparition Point, and went home.
Hermione cries a bit, head shoved against his shoulder. But it doesn’t matter how many times she, Pansy, or Blaise say it’s all going to be alright. Draco is making peace with the fact that nothing is ever going to be right again.
but Draco doesn’t voice that last part.
“Are you looking for something?”
. So he ran, judged by the disapproving stares of the portraits—those left untouched or already repaired.
down Harry’s spine. Who could read a book for six hours without moving a muscle. Who only drank high-quality Earl Grey and called anyone who preferred teabags over loose leaf “heathens”. Malfoy, who ate sweets all day long, was brilliant at Quidditch, always dressed like a prince and walked like a king. Who cut Harry’s potions ingredients properly under the pretence of refusing to get anything but an ‘O’, but not necessarily realising that Harry wasn’t even his partner for that lesson - well, Malfoy.
All of this had happened because of a single wish. Perhaps there had been more to it. What if magic had understood that deep down, Draco didn’t only want to get rid of a house rotten by darkness? That he’d wanted to be happy? What if Vanishing the Manor had been the only way magic could find to force Harry and Draco to spend more time together?
“Sure, sweetheart. Just wait for me.”
“Can’t, or won’t?”
.” The spider scampered, and Harry squeezed Draco’s hand. “You do remember they’re harmless, right?”
“Go in, find that lantern, and bring it back. I suspect the entity needs the light to find a way out. Do nothing else. Make no attempt at purging, or interacting with anything sentient; use your cloak.”
“—and you need a way to pinpoint the country they’re in, at the very least.” Her face lit up, her smile widened. “Once you’re there, though—” she bit her lip and looked at the ceiling, “—I wonder…Ooh, I’ll be right back.”
Oh, yes, that made sense. Harry saw the moment Malfoy’s expression went from disgust to awe, quickly hidden under a mask of indifference. He understood the interest. If a room built by Godric Gryffindor were found, Harry would be excited too. Not Hermione-levels of excitement, but still. He followed Malfoy into the spacious room, glancing at the statues standing in the murky water and thanking Hogwarts for keeping the smell tolerable. He didn’t walk with Malfoy towards the creature, however. No thanks. Instead, he counted the tunnels. It might be wise to set some markers before and during their exploration if they didn’t want to get lost. Who knew if they’d ever find their way back otherwise?
He was wearing ripped jeans, mismatched socks and a green jumper that looked very soft. His skin was just like Harry’s, another reason why Aunt Petunia didn’t like him. Even his eyes were the same! And he seemed very kind.
“Why didn’t you say so earlier?”
They were so different, but that made it all the more interesting. Malfoy was still prickly and haughty because that was just who he was, but he was no longer condescending or cruel. He hadn’t been in a long time, honestly. The biggest fights they’d had since third year were often when Malfoy was genuinely angry, not because he was poking him to see how long it’d take for him to break. Without him, Harry wasn’t sure he’d have appreciated his stay in the Chamber that much.
The fact that Potter had produced two Patroni in this state was nothing short of a miracle. The wand-movement alone—Draco shouldn’t be surprised: it was
“My apologies,” Potter replies with a wry grin. It shouldn't be so damn sexy. It’s unfair. Potter’s whole existence is an injustice.
No teacher catches them, but it’s getting risky, now that most of them are coming back from their winter holidays. They need a completely private place. Draco hasn’t forgotten Harry’s promise: he uses their last few moments of peace, the evening before the return of the Hogwarts Express, to ask him about it with his most innocent expression. Harry is just putting the finishing touches on his Charms homework (yes, he forgot; no, Draco isn’t surprised) when Draco kisses his cheek, marvelling, as always, at the softness of his skin.
Harry tilted his head and crossed his hands on the table. “You forget the neighbours.”
He flushed. That happened too often lately. “It’s just a shock.”
Draco rears back. “What, you think I’m a law-abiding citizen who would follow an arbitrary set of guidelines aimed at keeping roommates out of each other’s bed? I’m shocked, no, I’m wounded, Potter!” He pecks Harry’s lips. “Unless you’ve suddenly decided it’s a bad idea, I do hope to fuck you until you forget your name.” His grin grows and Harry’s face is on fire, then Draco slides off his lap and slouches, the back of his head resting against the wall. “That’d be quite a feat, and maybe it’ll deflate your oversized ego. Imagine the headlines: Harry Potter, Defeated by the Sword of Slytherin.”
Draco doesn’t reply - Harry doesn’t need his opinion right now.
A cigarette holder between his fingers, lounging on a velvet sofa, Draco eyed him from head to toe. “You look abominable this afternoon, Potter.”
“You know I only date you for the scandalous headlines.”
It would have been easy to beg him for forgiveness and thank him. He’d actually planned on doing just that when he arrived at Hogwarts this year. When he’d seen the masses grovelling, praising him, weeping in admiration, though, his brain had suddenly switched tactics. He wouldn’t join these idiots. He was going to annoy Potter.
“I’m sorry it took so long.”
“Do you want this, Potter?”
“He’s a Metamorphmagus.” Draco’s eyes widened. “Your cousin. Andromeda’s grandson.”
The snake even turned around to give him some privacy. There was no way Narnia was a bathroom. But Harry, who was used to the dirty bucket in his cupboard, wasn’t surprised that a toilet would feature so prominently in his dreams.
“Putting my clothes back on to Floo to your quarters if you didn’t show up. Help me? I couldn’t remove my shirt properly earlier anyway. You’ll have to cut it off.”
“And the resort?”
Malfoy raised an elegant eyebrow. “Thank you, Potter. Just wait until you try to make him wash his hair.”
Harry snorted at the nickname and scratched Noodle’s head. “
The glimmer in his eyes is back. “Well, well, well, Potter, how’s your refractory period?”
Unfortunately for Draco, the camel spider lurked near the entrance of their canyon, making him yelp and curse and climb back on his broom to keep his feet off the ground.
Breathless, Draco gives a jerky little nod, and takes Harry’s hand, pulling him towards the house. He steps into the kiddie pool that Harry should have put away a week ago, and by the time they’re in the living room downstairs, Harry is wheezing.
He held out his hand and Draco took it, smiling. “In that case, I give you permission to use my given name.”
“Well, it wasn’t, you utter imbecile. Ever heard of detection charms?”
Harry in an apron, wearing jeans that framed his arse perfectly. Kissing the back of his neck and slipping his hands around his waist, fingers dipping lower, he hummed.
Draco snorts. “Aside from all the sand in my hair, and eating too much calamari, it’s a good day.” He pauses, and exhales slowly. “We should fuck in the car.”
For the fifth time, Draco entered the chamber that his ancestors had built for purposes he didn’t approve of. He did have to thank them, though, for giving him the perfect place to destroy Horcruxes without endangering anyone or anything. A spiral was carved in the rough stone floor, runes etched around it.
“Git.”
“Yeees,” Draco drawled, “but Scorp seems quite convinced of their swimming capabilities and wants a series of bedtime facts on them.”
“Too bad, I don’t know how to make anything else, and don’t say a roast.”
Harry bit his lips so he wouldn’t grin too widely and upset the cranky employee even more.
Draco won’t discover anything today, though. He’s celebrating the end of his exams at Zabini’s house. Harry was invited, and was almost tempted to join — Blaise has a pool, and Harry wants to swim without getting sand in his trunks. Not to mention, watching Draco interact with his friends is entertaining, because he unleashes the Drama™ he excels at. But Harry is also invited somewhere else, and that’s where he’s going.
Draco features heavily in Harry’s dreams, and it isn’t long before Harry has to wash his sheets in the morning like a bloody teenager. His sex drive has always been rather low and since the end of the war, he didn’t touch himself that often, being either tired or loathing his existence too much to care. If he masturbated, it was out of habit, a quick orgasm in the shower, or because it helped him fall asleep. Hermione would probably have a name for his lack of interest, but pigs will fly before he considers talking to anyone about it. Ron is somewhat aware of it, and Harry has no desire to elaborate.
“Why the Chamber and the Basilisk, sir?” he asked, trying to distract himself.
Upon opening the door, Draco thought Potter’s dark green winter cloak was the best piece of clothing the other man owned. “Thanks for coming,” Draco suppressed a wince, aware of the unholy mess around him.
Harry had some idea about that. The association, created during the post-war reconstruction efforts, attached a considerable importance to the appearance of Diagon Alley. Every shopkeeper had a role to play, which meant, at this time of the year, appropriate decorations were required.
Harry pointed at the book. “This says to use your hands.”
“September. She’s great with the spawn, too.”
“I am not asking. Get out.”
When they came down from the high, Potter glanced at their hands. “You know, cum looks a bit like a sea cucumber’s innards.”
Harry rolls his eyes; he can’t wait until Draco is done with his exams, since it means he’ll finally stop complaining about them. It’ll also take some pressure off his shoulders. Potion Masters are a rarity.
Harry stopped, ruffled Draco’s hair (so what if he liked it?) and gave him a quick kiss. “You didn’t think I was going to let you eat that, right?”
, he didn’t date; he’d slept with a few Muggles when he was figuring out what he enjoyed, but he didn’t like one-night stands, so he’d found ways to pleasure himself beyond the usual toys. Milking was, by far, his favourite activity, though it could last for hours and wasn’t suited to a shower stall. He wondered what Malfoy would look like if Harry did it to him. Would he beg for release, or would he relax under Harry’s touch and melt in his arms?
As Christmas approached, the office of H.E.A.L.E.R. conformed to the standards required by the Diagon Alley Storefront Association. However, Dennis Creevey still insisted on fitting Minitree with a bauble and added a dozen Christmas crackers in a basket that nobody would ever see. Warrington was not amused by the young man’s eagerness, because in his enthusiasm, he’d bumped against the wall and unhooked the framed “Rules for Dealing With Abandoned Wardstones” that had been a pain to hang there in the first place. The parchment refused to lay flat.
, for Merlin’s sake. Had the Slytherin not raised his wand, they might not be down there at all, but it was Harry’s fault.
“I didn’t dissociate.” It seems important. No, it is important, and it even brings a small smile to Draco’s lips. It disappears quickly, and Harry wants to ask what’s wrong, but he’s reluctant, just in case it scares him off. Instead, he pretends nothing is odd about them sitting on the floor of what used to be the Malfoy library. “I think my lungs are coated in dust.” As if eager to confirm, his body seizes, and he sneezes violently. Malfoy chuckles. “See? I bet I’m developing five different allergies all at once.”
And they stepped inside.
“Spoilsport!” Lavender Vanished her half cracker. “So, a little bird told me you got a lot more people than you expected for your Malfoy Manor party.”
Malfoy dropped to his knees, undid his tie, and unzipped Harry’s trousers, tugging his pants down and pulling his cock out. There was a wicked gleam in his eyes and his usual smirk now provoked brand new sensations deep into Harry’s guts. Malfoy pressed an open-mouthed kiss on his pelvis, hot breath tickling his skin, then pulled and twisted his fist around him. Harry couldn’t stop staring, awed, and almost dizzy with want.
on himself. As soon as he’s out, bumping shoulders with excited music fans who seem to have multiplied while he was in Flourish and Blotts, he regrets his life choices. Each step he takes brings him closer to the Apparition point, so he counts them all, his breathing shallow as he’s jostled around.
Harry nods, and they keep walking.
“Trust me Draco, sea cucumbers aren’t fascinating enough for a long discussion.”
“I mean, there was a sparkly candle on top, and it’s gone, and I don’t know how.”
He looked outside at the bleak grey skies. The holly tree by the window sagged under the weight of the snow. “You agree, don’t you?” he muttered in a scratchy voice as he spotted a beautiful bird preening its red feathers. Non-magical animals had deserted the Manor and its grove, but magical creatures thrived without the presence of the Dark Lord. The bird looked like a cardinal, but Draco was sure he’d seen it in a Care of Magical Creatures book before. Something about omens of hope.
“Not a good reason to murder you.”
And Potter, as a noble Gryffindor, didn’t mock Draco’s weak Transfiguration abilities. “Show me around? I want to get a feel of the place.”
Triumph flashes in Malfoy’s eyes and Harry wants to slap himself. He forgot they weren’t alone. “I did, I’m sorry.” The kid’s hair is so yellow it hurts to look at. “I’ll put a sickle in the swear jar.”
Helped by another levitating spell cast on his own feet, he grabbed the edge of the hole and hoisted himself up. Malfoy trapped the piece of metal in an enlarged box, heavily warded by none other than Bill Weasley, and Harry brushed away the dust and sand off his kaftan, deeming the car far enough for now. Their various charms still protected them, but they shouldn’t linger for too long. One of the passengers might be a wizard.
Draco had rarely shown himself in such a vulnerable state when someone could see him, yet he broke down again and sobbed his heart out when he spoke about his seventh year. The Carrows forcing children to torture their friends, the monster waiting for him each time he went home. The fear of knowing that Potter had vanished. The panic when he’d been brought to the Manor, the lie he’d told, the punishment he’d been given.
Harry drinks again, and the last drop is like a signal. His heart clenches in his chest, his vision blurs and darkens at the edges. He can’t do this. He shifts in his seat until Ron understands he needs to get up. There are groans of dismay and a line of people stand, including Hermione, who’s frowning but doesn’t ask what Harry’s doing. Harry pretends to head to the loo, yet at the last second, he turns left and exits the pub.
“Potter!”
Wincing, Harry nodded. “Any suggestion?” They couldn’t exactly dig. He took a large gulp of water; Draco made a small noise, so Harry gave him his bottle.
Confused, Draco turns to face him. “What are you doing?”
“Oh! I’m sorry. My name is Hermione Granger, I just found out I was a witch, and it’s so fascinating, and I didn’t expect to see anyone with a book published in the normal world, and I’ve read it as well so I thought maybe I could help you understand it—”
What came out of Harry’s throat was an odd wheezing breath and he nodded. “Yeah, that—that sounds good.”
“Shit.” He gazed, unblinking, at the foggy mirror facing the shower stall. “I’m screwed.”
Harry glanced at Malfoy, recognising the glint of interest in his eyes. “Should we put it back?”
Molly’s hug is next. She berates him for staying away for too long and looks at him with a satisfied nod. “You look great. I was so worried, Harry dear. You’ve always been so skinny. I expect you to take more than one serving today.”
? Draco called for Kreacher again and interrupted him before he could refer to Draco as “Cissa’s graceful baby boy” or some other nonsense. “Keep an eye on Potter. He might hurt himself.”
Before he opened his mouth, Draco squeezed his hip. “We can get out with a lantern. If we can’t grab the one we need, another will do the trick.” Another squeeze, followed by a kiss behind Harry’s left ear. “Come on. You’re the Gryffindor here; don’t be a wuss.”
Harry shrugged, keeping an eye on him. “Somewhere I hoped I’d never see again.”
A mousy young man shook his head, his name popping up in Draco’s mind. Boot, Ravenclaw in his year. “No. We’ll be back to talk to you though, Malfoy.”
He had no idea if he was doing it right, but Slytherin didn’t interrupt, so he asked Malfoy to follow along and took long, deep breaths, telling him to match them. The portrait ultimately helped by redirecting his focus to different senses, and finally, after what felt like hours, Malfoy crumbled, falling to his knees and hiding his face in his hands.
“Have you ever gotten to watch an orchestra play, Harry?” Draco was curious. He didn’t know how much musical exposure Harry had, and he didn't know why he wanted to know. He wanted to, for some inexplicable reason, give Harry the experience of enjoying instrumental music. He figured that maybe it was the musician in him wanting to spread the joy and expression of musicality.
