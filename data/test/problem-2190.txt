The Weasley matriarch gave Draco a sharp smile that made the teenager shiver. "Don't worry, dear," she said in an overly cheery tone. "I'll make them listen!"
"-can see it. We know," the Auror interrupted, finishing the blonde's sentence. Draco let out a sigh before reaching into his pocket, pulling the paper out, and handing the paper over to the man questioning him. The man handed the paper over to McGonagall and the woman flicked her wand over the slip.
know. Teenage pregnancy isn't really a problem here but it is rampant in the Muggle-world, after all." Draco felt his face warm up, causing the woman to laugh even harder. The mother of seven let out a happy sigh, "don't worry, child. I'll help you with little Estella."
The Great Hall was impressive-- to an extent. Although the other children gaped at the levitating candles and the 'open' night sky, Draco merely glanced at the hall and proceeded to examine his trimmed fingernails. Unfortunately for the designer of the Great Hall, the blond aristocrat had witnessed more magnificent sights in the Manor's guest coat closet.
Draco was too busy trying to calm himself down to pay attention to the adults across the table as they all whispered among themselves and slowly left the room one by one. By the time Draco gathered his wits together, the room was completely vacant besides the Weasley matriarch sitting directly across from him. Her round face was marred with a look of guilt and concern. Draco sniffed and glanced around the empty dining room. "Where did they all go?"
If somebody told Draco a day ago that trusting Snape would lead him to getting his life hexed out of him by
him. He saw Blaise and Pansy talking while Theo chimed in occasionally. He saw Vincent and Gregory eating their hearts out while Daphne lectured them to slow down. He saw Millicent--
Draco looked down at the glass of water and then back up at the Weasley matriarch who had a worried look etched onto her plump face.
"The-Boy-Who-Lived is on this train, yes," Daphne snapped back, interrupting Draco's thoughts. "I heard that he's sitting near the end of the train."
Malfoy nodded slowly but did not respond. The inhabitants of the room stared at each other awkwardly, while Mrs. Weasley sat down in her seat and looked at all of them with a strained smile. Mrs. Weasley clapped loudly, causing everyone to jump, “Now, let's start eating! I'm famished!”
“What's this got to do with Dumbledore?” Harry questioned. Hermione rolled her eyes at the interruption.
Draco thought as he gripped the straps of his backpack and began to head inside. However, before he could, Black slapped his hand down on Draco's left shoulder and glared at him.
Draco didn't move until he saw the metal monster leave his sight. Once the contraption was gone, Draco pulled out the slip of paper and read the address again.
"One, it's illegal for a little kid like you to do it," Robert started, earning an insulted gasp from Anthony.
"Why is it so funny?" Gregory Goyle, the brunette, asked with a confused tone. Draco bit his bottom lip in an attempt to control his laughter. Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle were never very smart. Ever since Draco had met them as a young child, the two boys proved themselves again and again to be half-witted fools. Although at times Draco found their senseless talk laughable, majority of the time the blond boy felt an extreme amount of pity for them (not that Draco would admit that out loud though).
“Sorry for being late,” Sirius apologized as him and Malfoy took their seats next to Remus. “Malfoy slept so much, even the baby woke up before him.”
that?" The aristocrat shook his head in disbelief before continuing, "Trelawney said that the beef would be raw!"
"Once you all get broomsticks you can try it! I just wouldn't recommend it," Robert exclaimed as he walked up to the large brown door. The first-years followed behind him but at a slower pace, however, since they were still catching their breaths. "Ask an easy one, knocker," Robert said to the bronze eagle-shaped knocker. "These are newbies."
Draco repressed a shiver as Black continued to speak, “What a perfect little Black he was… unlike me. He was a Slytherin, and he was a strong believer in all things blood purity. He supported the Death Eaters, Voldemort,” Draco couldn't repress a shiver after hearing the Dark Lord's name spoken aloud, “their cause,” Black paused and watched Draco carefully, “he eventually saw the light, though, and tried to back out.”
Draco never hated the rule about first-years not having broomsticks more than he did at that moment.
“No shit,” Ginny said with a snort. Remus gave the girl a warning glare and Ginny ignored it and continued to speak, “you looked like you were about to drop dead this afternoon. You looked like you need a nap.”
understand why she did it... even though he wasn't exactly happy that it happened to him. If he was in the Weasley woman's shoes, he would've done the same thing; if (Merlin forbid) Ron Weasley showed up to the Manor with a babe in his arms, he would want to slip the weasel some Veritaserum too.
"The Dark Lord and his followers visit the Manor on an almost daily basis," Draco found himself saying. His grey eyes widened in shock as he heard himself expose the truth of his situation. The blonde tried to stop himself from continuing but wasn't able to. "I feared for mine and Estella's lives because of how violent they were," Draco said as tears of frustration started to well up in his eyes. "They scare me." The blonde forced himself to finished with a whisper, his voice shaking as it did. All of the adults minus Black, Shacklebolt, and Moody stared at Draco with looks of sympathy. Black and Moody looked intrigued, meanwhile Shacklebolt looked as stiff and professional as he did prior to the aristocrat's answer.
Everyone burst out laughing while the tan girl, Michael Corner, and Draco all rolled their eyes. "No," the knocker grumbled, "The answer is not feces. Somebody else must try now." Anthony frowned while the other first-years thought of the answer.
At the thought of Millicent, Draco hesitantly looked up and glanced towards the Slytherin table... only to see Millicent staring right at him with a slimy smirk on her face. "Bloody hell!" Draco exclaimed as he hastily looked away from his third cousin.
"I do-- Father says it's a crime if I'm not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you'll be in yet?" Draco gave him a small smile, hoping it would hide his distress. What were those voices? Why did they sound so familiar?
Once the Malfoy family arrived at one of the entrances to the Hogwarts Express, they stopped and looked at each other. Lucius grimaced the moment he laid his eyes on his smiling child. "Draco, wipe that smile off your face. You look like a simpering fool," Draco's smile disappeared immediately. He looked up at his father with a frown.
meet," Trelawney corrected. The towheaded child struggled to keep a sneer off his face after the rude interruption. "I foresaw our encounter years ago. My visions told me that an albino child-"
bigger than Draco. She had broad shoulders and would probably tower over Draco if he were to stand up. Draco's thoughts were interrupted by the shorter girl's whining, "Pansy, you are coming with us right now! We need to talk," Daphne grabbed Pansy's arm and pulled the raven-hair girl out of her seat. "I have so much gossip to tell you about-"
The Gryffindors all begrudgingly nodded just as Mrs. Weasley bust through the door with floating dishes surrounding her. As Mrs. Weasley set up the table, Sirius entered the dining room with Malfoy right behind him holding a babbling baby.
Mrs. Weasley gave both twins a look of pure disappointment. “Just… will all of you keep the conversation appropriate? For the babe?” The twins apologized to their mother in tandem before turning back to their food.
"Father, I'm excited, that's all," he explained as other wizarding families rushed by them without care. Narcissa sighed before cupping her son's face with her pale, thin hands.
Draco winced as he heard the screams of his surname. Instead of looking up to see who said his name, the Slytherin quickly glanced down at the toddler in his arm to see her face flushed and scrunched up. She was going to have a fit and Draco knew it was going to be bad.
"Wait," Draco interrupted, his face scrunched up in confusion. The blonde was watching the exchange between the adults, getting more and more confused with every sentence spoken.
"Yeah," a blond boy sitting across from Draco said, "I don't think you have the right to call anybody broody, Michael. Not when you look like that!"
Draco finished the entire glass in under a minute, disregarding any sense of decorum Draco still had in his exhausted state. When he placed the glass down onto the table, he glanced back up to see the two adults staring at him with astonished looks on their faces.
“Can all of you shut up and let me talk?” Hermione demanded. The Weasley siblings quieted down and turned towards Hermione. “Malfoy looked awful, as in he looked tired. He looked absolutely exhausted. If I didn't know any better, Malfoy must've stayed up all night.”
Trelawney is probably my favorite character in this fanfic lol. I know she can actually make prophecies but remember that her powers aren't that strong!! A lot of the shit she says is made up so... I'm going to play around with that concept LOL. Hence, the chapter title.
Black gave Draco an unreadable look before replying, “You don't have to die a Death Eater,” Draco's breathe caught in his throat as Black turned back towards his own room, “Now, go take a nap. You look like you're about to die from exhaustion before anything else.”
ALSO: Should I draw fanart for this fic? Would y'all like that? I'm considering using scenes from this fic to help me practice drawing anatomy LOL! What scenes do you want me to draw? I'm already considering the opening scene of Draco and Estella walking with Draco looking exhausted as fuck lol.
Draco felt a twinge of apprehension before squashing the feeling entirely. Draco turned to his roommates and in an attempt to look unalarmed, he casually (awkwardly) stated, "Lets go to the Great Hall... I'm hungry."
I think I should have the next chapter up by next week but we shall see! I also have another Draco-centric fanfic I'm currently working on (it's about Draco being a seer! Check it out!) and I need to figure out my writing schedule.
"Would've made things a hell of a lot simpler if his croaking old arse was here," Black muttered in annoyance.
For those who aren't familiar with Veritaserum, let me explain why Draco, who has a natural inclination towards Occlumency (even though at this time in the fanfic, he isn't fully trained) was unable to resist it. In the books, they say that when people aren't aware they're under Veritaserum, the potion works better. So, Draco was eventually able to stop himself from talking but at first he couldn't because he didn't know he took Veritaserum. Draco's natural skill in Occlumency becomes a plot point later so I just wanted to explain this scene just in case in the future, people see Draco's Occlumency skills as inconsistent because of this scene.
“Obviously,” Black said. The Gryffindor then raised his eyebrows at the blond. “Are you going to stand in the hallway all day or are you going to enter?”
A sudden voice pierced the room. A voice that Draco recognized. The first year audibly gasped once he made the realization. She is the woman from his dreams; the frail woman who was dying before Draco's very eyes. Trelawney continued the conversation with the mysterious woman, not noticing Draco's silver eyes widening in horror as the blood drained from his face.
Also, for my fellow book readers, I'm planning on having a full redemption arc for Draco. I'm kind of sick and tired of reading fics that blatantly ignore the fact that Draco was a bigoted bully in his youth. Yes, his rude nature can be explained by his upbringing but it's not excusable and I don't want to just gloss over it. It is canon that Draco changes his ways and opinions and in this fic, I want to reflect that! Molly Weasley, Hermione, Lupin, and the Tonk family are going to play huge roles in his redemption so stay tuned!
This is it. This is the moment that he had anticipated since he could even remember. Draco was going to Hogwarts-- today.
While everyone placed food on their plates, Malfoy looked around the table with a frown on his face, “Mrs. Weasley,” the blond said, causing everyone in the room to look at him. “Is there any baby food for-”
All of the voices were interrupted by a loud wail. Draco let out a shaky sigh as he held the frightened girl close to his chest and a rubbed a soothing hand down her back. Draco began shushing into the toddler's ear just like his mother did when Estella threw crying fits back at the Manor... but it didn't work. The blonde could feel the stares on him as he attempted to calm Estella down to no avail. She kept sobbing loudly and Draco didn't know what to do.
"Your eye is like mine, Draco," Draco looked over at his classmates who, like himself, were confused and slightly disturbed by the woman standing before them. "Your eye is like glass as your sight is like fog-"
"Okay first-years, head up to your dormitories," Robert started. "Tomorrow, Professor Flitwick will hand you your schedule, okay?" All of the first-years nodded. "Goodnight then."
Harry shook his head. "No. I remember... It's just that-" Harry stopped himself mid-sentence and then started again, "Okay, for some reason, I dreamt of Malfoy's parents."
?" Snape exclaimed, horrified. Draco timidly summarized the words the Dark Lord said to him during their last meeting— that the Dark Lord for all intents and purposes wanted to fuck him. Snape's usually grey-toned face morphed into a sickly green. His reaction was alarming, to say the least. But at least Draco knew that one male adult figure in his life had his head screwed on straight. When the teenager confided in his father about the same issue, his father was elated and said that this was a 'fantastic opportunity' for Draco.
Draco reached into the bag and tried to find the little food he did pack. "Merlin, where is it?" Draco let out a huff of frustration and continued to push the contents of the bag around in search for food.
The Ravenclaw Prefects led the way to the Ravenclaw Tower with the first-years close behind them. The way there was painful, rather, the way
The two sat in the dining room along with Draco's father, who was presently reading the Daily Prophet. There was a sundry of different foods displayed on the long ebony table before them. Draco took a piece of toast and proceeded to spread jam on it. He looked up at his mother and shrugged. "I guess," the boy answered, his voice nonchalant. Narcissa knew better. She raised her eyebrows at him in disbelief as he continued to take a bite of his toast.
"Yeah, I can tell," the other boy agreed. Draco took a deep breathe, trying to remember what they were talking about earlier.
"You just seemed... bothered, is all," his mother answered, eyeing her son carefully. Draco shrugged.
The hallway was narrow, Draco noted as he squeezed his way through the crowd. Draco was currently on the train trying to navigate his way through (which he found quite hard since what seemed to be London's entire juvenile population was in the train with him). By his side were his massive, leather trunk and his eagle owl, Vyronas-- both charmed by his father to be lighter.
After Trelawney's strange omen, Draco spent his weekend drowning in anticipation. While the rest of Draco's roommates dismissed Trelawney as an "old tart that's slightly off her rocker", Draco found himself unable to ignore Trelawney and her strange statements entirely.
Draco hesitated before answering, "Professor Snape," this answer caused Black and the werewolf to exchange a meaningful look over the male Auror's head, though what the look meant, the teenage aristocrat couldn't tell. Draco gulped before continuing, "I confided in him about... things that were worrying me and he told me to trust him and then handed me a note with this address on it."
Black stood silently and seemed to contemplate the question for a moment before answering, “Regulus officially became a Death Eater when he was only sixteen,” it was as if someone had cast a lightning charm on Draco; the blond stared at Black with wide eyes.
On the second day of school, Draco received a letter from his parents regarding his house. The letter wasn't too feisty but the content still hinted at disappointment, at least if "Draco, I expected you to flourish in Slytherin but I suppose you can perform okay enough in Ravenclaw" was enough to go by. The classes were interesting but the work load was obnoxious (Professor McGonagall had already assigned them a paper!) and the only classes Draco thought he would genuinely enjoy--Potions and Defense Against the Dark Arts-- turned out to be jokes (Potions was only a joke because he shared the class with dimwitted Hufflepuffs. Defense Against the Dark Arts, on the other hand, was a completely different story). By the end of the first week, Draco was exhausted and already missed his stress-free life back at the Manor.
The eleven-year old shook his head in disbelief. His mother was right about the so-called "pre-Hogwarts jitters" she was always rambling about. That dream, whatever it was, must have been caused by his nerves. Draco understood it perfectly... why he would be nervous, that is. In less than two months, he'll be in Hogwarts. Draco would be sorted (into Slytherin, of course) and he would be in classes and he would be the top of his class and he would be-
Draco looked over at the front of the shop to see Madam Malkin squatting in front of a thin boy. The boy's hair was dark and disheveled, he wore clothes that were too big for his small frame, and had large glasses that did nothing to dull the bright green hue in the boy's eyes.
"Who's emo?" the three boys turned to see another first-year with brown hair sitting next to Draco. "Oh," he started, "don't mind me. I'm just enjoying the conversation," he glanced over at the three other boys before his eyes landed on Michael. "Let me guess? He's the emo one, right?"
"So..." Blaise started awkwardly, staring at Draco as he did. The blond had been glaring out the window since he returned to the compartment five minutes prior; meanwhile, the other boys sat there in silence and stared at the blond. Blaise had been the first to break this silence. "I take it as Potter wasn't recruited?"
The name Estella is Latin for "star." I was considering naming her Lyra because I know there's a constellation called Lyra. I also considered Cordelia and Aurora because they're moons but I decided on Estella because I thought the name was super pretty!
"I'm sorry but who are you?" Draco asked with a sneer. Daphne froze in place, her eyes moving slowly until she spotted Draco.
Draco turned to his trunk and his owl's cage immediately. "No, I'll be fine," he replied. Draco looked up at the luggage rack above him, contemplating whether or not he should even attempt at placing his trunk there. After a moment, Draco decided to not even try (sure, Draco's father charmed his things to be lighter but Draco was still a pampered eleven year-old boy! He can barely drag his trunk around with him let alone lift it up onto a rack that's almost two feet taller than him!). The blond boy took his trunk and placed it underneath the seats while placing his owl in the corner of the compartment. The other children moved over, giving Draco the window seat on his left. The whistle of the train sounded as Draco sat down with a huff.
crazy enough I've been working on this chapter since December... how has it already been like 7 months??? time is passing by so fast. so freaky.
Hermione shook her head in disagreement. “No, that baby has to be at least a year or two years old. If that baby was Malfoy's, then why didn't his parents voice their disapproval a year ago?”
Draco shook his head violently as he took his hands off of his mouth. "Gods, no. I got out of there before he could," Draco said. He then felt the push to say more and tried to hold it back but- "but... he would say things. About me. And how he wanted to do things to me. And how he thought I was pretty. And how-" The blonde let out a shriek of frustration before aggressively biting down onto his bottom lip, breaking the supple skin and causing his lip to start bleeding. "What is this? Did you slip me Veritaserum or something?"
Almost all of the children rolled their eyes. Pansy sighed, "Stop being so dramatic. It couldn't have been that bad."
"He thought about her smile. He thought about her thin hair. He thought about the reeking smell of death that exuded from her." -when it goes from 0 to 100 real quick lmaoo.
The plot should start to pick up soon! I'm using the summer before fifth year chapters to set the stage for various plot points and relationships in this fanfic! I hope y'all don't mind the slow start!
"You've heard my voice before," the mysterious woman stated simply. Draco, still shaken from his fit earlier, felt incapable of responding audibly. Instead, he nodded in response whilst glancing around the room in search of the voice's owner. There was no one there besides himself and the Divination's professor. "Sybill... bring him to the table. I want to see him."
well-- at least, not as well as he knew the other children in the compartment. The blond had met Blaise a few time when they were very young but then the black boy moved to Italy with his mother. After that, Draco only saw Blaise yearly-- when the young boy visited England with his mother. Although they hadn't interacted often, the two boys somehow managed to develop a camaraderie between themselves.
"No, little one," the mysterious woman answered. "The crystal ball isn't charmed. Rather, only a select few can communicate like this through the medium of a crystal ball. Those being ones cursed with advanced sight."
"Therefore... My sight..." Draco couldn't bring himself to finish the sentence. His greatest fears were coming true and he didn't want to face the reality of the situation. If he truly was a Seer then all of those awful visions were going to come true one day; Draco couldn't understand most of them but he understood enough to know that the situations in his apparitions weren't good ones.
brooding facial expressions when you have your-- " Draco stopped abruptly, scanning the other boy's appearance. Draco could not believe that this mopey low-born was telling
Draco glanced at the stool before grimacing. "Couldn't they have brought a more decent-looking hat?" On top of the stool sat a shabby pointed wizard's hat. The hat was pitiful; it was patched, frayed, and coated in grime. The hat would have been set aflame before it even entered Wiltshire, let alone the Malfoy Manor.
him? The blond was mortified. Draco's hand shooting down to his side as he tried to control his facial expressions.  "I'd be careful if I were you, Potter," he said slowly. "Unless you're a bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents. They didn't know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraffs like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it'll rub off on you."
With that, the door to the common room opened. Draco's earlier frustrations with the riddle evaporated once he saw the Ravenclaw common room. The room was a large, circular room with arched windows that had blue and bronze silks gracefully hanging off of them. The floor was covered in a midnight blue carpet scattered in stars, which was reflected onto the domed ceiling. The room was furnished with polished wooden tables, chairs, and bookcases. And by the door leading up to the dormitories stood a great white marble statue of Rowena Ravenclaw. As the first years scurried into the room, a soft whistling sound traveled with them. Draco tried not to ogle at the area around him; unlike the Great Hall, the Ravenclaw common room was every bit of impressive to the blond aristocrat. It was peaceful and airy-- a completely different atmosphere than the Manor.
Draco's entire body was shaking now. Tears streamed down his face as he heard himself answer again against his will, "The Dark Lord desired me," Draco started, causing everyone at the table to visibly react with widened eyes and audible gasps. "Sexually. He-" Draco covered his mouth with his hands to stop himself from talking.
"Sorry, Draco," she apologized. Draco nodded at her as he attempted to regain his composure. Pansy cleared her throat and looked over at the compartment to her right before looking back at Draco. "Theodore, Blaise, Greg, and Vincent are already inside."
"We know, dear," she told him. "but there is no reason to make a face. Remember all of the rules of decorum, Draco," the pale woman took her hands away from her son's face before continuing to speak. "many children at your school do not know the rules or simply do not care. Do not be like them, dear. Do not befriend boys and girls with no sense of etiquette."
"No, Blaise, he was not recruited," Draco bit out through gritted teeth. The blond continued to glower out the window as he spoke, "the Weasley maggot decided to brainwash Potter; and Potter," the blond stopped for a dramatic pause. "he did not want to be saved."
Pansy slid the door closed and sat down next to Theo before raising her eyebrows at Draco. "Really?"
“I don't want my calves bulking up,” Draco was surprised to hear Black let out a small breathy laugh in response. Once Black quieted down, the two stared at each other in silence. Draco furrowed his brows in confusion, “And you're here staring at me because…?”
That statement caused Draco to snort. "Hardly!" Draco shook his head before continuing, "You two are overreacting. Its not like I'm leaving to Hogwarts today. We're just going shopping." (For a wand. Shopping for a wand. Draco is getting a wand today).
Draco shivered in horror before he looked over at the platter of overdone beef at the Ravenclaw table. Trelawney wasn't even right about the beef, so Draco doubted she was right about his 'inner eye'. The blonde glanced at the teacher's table where Trelawney was absent before repressing a sigh.
"Oh, this is Vincent Crabbe and this is Gregory Goyle," Draco carelessly said. "And my name's Malfoy, Draco Malfoy."
"Sorry," the girl, Millicent, said-- although she did not sound sorry at all. The big girl smirked at Draco who was still grimacing in embarrassment. "I'm Millicent Bulstrode."
“That's my little brother's room,” Black said with a wistful tone, “Reggie and your mother were quite close.”
That seemed to shut the rude boy up. Draco smirked, turning back to the average boy, "You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there."
That shut Draco up. Draco felt his face heat up again as he looked away from the average boy and at his friends behind him. "Crabbe, Goyle, lets go back to our compartment. I don't want to spend any more time with these plebs," Draco drawled, trying to hide his embarrassment.
"What in the seven hells is going on out here?" An older woman exclaimed. Draco looked up to see the Weasley matriarch alongside all of her children that currently went to Hogwarts, Granger, Potter, and Black all staring at him with looks of shock and confusion. The elder woman regained her composure quickly once she saw the toddler crying in Draco's arms. "Oh dear!" the woman cried out before shoving her way past the teenagers to stand next to Black. "Sirius, put your wand down! And all of you stop gawking! Can't you see that you're stressing the poor babe out?" Black begrudgingly put his wand down as the mother Weasley walked over to Draco and held out her arms. "I can take care of the little angel, love. I have quite the experience in this area!" Draco hesitated for a moment handing Estella over. "There! I'll calm the babe down while you head inside. You look exhausted!"
"Harassing?" Hermione questioned, immediately catching on to Harry's vague description. "In what way?"
"Draco?" the fair-headed boy looked up at his parents, who were sitting across from him. "Draco, dear, are you okay?" Narcissa asked, her eyebrows furrowed. Lucius also looked worried, though to anyone else other than Narcissa and Draco, he would seem impassive.
“You were born a Death Eater,” Black said with an odd look in his eye. He wasn't angry, however. It was almost as if he was sad. Draco frowned and looked up at Black, “whether you like it or not, you will always be a Death Eater regardless of whether you have the mark. Malfoy Senior made sure of that.”
“In good news, Ron,” Ginny started as she tossed an arm around Ron's shoulders, “you're not the only guy in this room who wants a nibble of Malfoy's magic wand! You aren't alone anymore!” The awkward energy clouding the room dispelled quickly after that statement. Both Harry and Ron became red in mortification as they stuttered in their defense, while the twins roared with laughter.
“Ron didn't,” Ginny deadpanned. Ron whipped his head towards the red-headed girl and gave her a vicious glare.
"As I said earlier," Draco started with a sneer, "couldn't they have brought a better hat?" the blond whined, a pout forming on his face. Before Theodore could respond, a rip in the hat opened wide like a mouth-- and the hat began to sing.
If Draco hadn't trained himself to keep vomit down after every instance of the Dark Lord's 'flirting', the blonde would have projectile vomited all over the dining room table. Apparently, he was not alone in his disgust. The purple haired girl wasn't purple haired anymore; with a look of revulsion and a groan of disgust, the girl who Draco now knew as Dora turned her hair bright green. Both Weasley's turned red and covered their faces with their hands. McGonagall looked as though she had never been more disappointed in someone in her entire life. The Auror who had been questioning him looked like he was one minute away from apparating out of the room. And then Mad-Eye-Moody looked like he was about to pummel Black's face in. However, no one's reaction was as interesting as Lupin's— his face was bright red in embarrassment and had his eyes glued to the table in front of him.
"...Are you okay?" Draco blinked and looked up to see the average boy staring at him. The blond boy nodded quickly before clearing his throat.
Junior year of high school happened. Like that's it honestly. I kinda screwed myself over and took seven classes HAH but due to my big ass ego, I didn't drop any classes :)
"Yes, but dear," Narcissa started, "This is the beginning of your Hogwarts journey. You'll receive your books, your robes, your wand, your-"
BASICALLY! I wrote the whole entire chapter last week and I was about to post it last weekend but then I had a "writer's mental breakdown" as I like to call it and deleted all of it LOL RIP. In my defense, this rewritten version is much better lol but really though I didn't like the way I wrote the chapter so I just deleted it all.
But I digress... I decided to just write everything I wanted into my own little (lmao) fanfiction. Hopefully you will enjoy it! Also, the tags and ratings may change as the story progresses because I haven't exactly planned out where this story is going. I just have an idea of what's going to happen. Enjoy!
Ron shook his head in denial, "Nah. If there was, mum would've told me to fuck off and twiddle my thumbs for the day."
Trelawney led Draco to the nearest wooden desk and sat him down on a chair. She then pointed towards the crystal ball in front of him and said, "Look and you shall see."
want to become a Death Eater. While the young aristocrat agreed with the bases of the ideology (purebloods being superior to mudbloods, muggles being a threat to wizarding society, etcetera), he did not agree with the execution— literally... they literally execute people. Murder, torture, and rape were things that Draco, like any normal functioning human being, looked down upon. Unfortunately, his father, his aunt Bellatrix, and his uncle Rodolphus did not share similar sentiments. Draco shivered as he thought about the screams he heard from the Manor's dungeons just a few days ago.
“I'm getting there,” she said with a sharp tone. “Why would Malfoy stay up all night and then end up here? The home-base for the Order?”
The first years all stood in a large huddle at the entrance of the Great Hall. The hall was big, to be blunt. The distance between the entrance to the end of the room seemed light-years away and the ceiling was nonexistent, showcasing the constellations up above. The four grand dining tables placed in the hall were occupied by hundreds of upperclassmen who unabashedly stared at the first years who, also rather unabashedly, admired the scenery around them. Professor McGonagall led the first years to the top of the hall before silently placing a four-legged stool in front of them.
Honestly... I've been wanting to write this story for a while now. I've been searching for a fic just like this one I'm writing but couldn't find it! I couldn't even find anything remotely close to it! (btw if you have a fic like this or idk pls recommend some for me pls!! i am suffering).
Just as Draco thought that, 11 and 13 Grimmauld Place began to move away from each other as another building took up the space in between them. The building was of a darker hue than the two buildings beside it and read 12 Grimmauld Place on a metal plate next to the door. Draco slowly walked up the worn out front steps while Estella fidgeted in his arms. The Slytherin eyed the door to see nothing but a silver knocker in the shape of twisted serpent.
Fred let out a loud sigh, “Fine! I'll just ask him when he comes downstairs. Which by the way,” Fred looked around the dining room where the Weasley siblings, Hermione, Harry, and Remus all sat waiting for supper while Mrs. Weasley prepared dinner in the kitchen. Ever since Remus sat them all down and explained the situation, the Gryffindors have been downstairs, avoiding the Slytherin as much as possible. And by 'explained the situation', Remus explained the bare minimum. Apparently, Malfoy was seeking asylum for him and the baby and was on a strict house arrest at Grimmuald's Place until school started. Remus gave no explanation for the baby or why exactly Malfoy decided to up and escape his home. “Where is the git? Is he not coming down?”
"Uh... yeah," Draco nodded again before changing the topic. "My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street looking at wands," Draco said, trying to sound calm although he was the exact opposite. "Then I'm going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. I don't see why first years can't have their own. I think I'll bully father into getting me one and I'll smuggle it in somehow."
"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted," she said. "Abbott, Hannah!"
Draco looked up at her with a frown, "Bulstrode?" (Bulstrode... as in Violetta Black née Bulstrode... as in...?)
Draco confidentially strutted towards the stool. He (grudgingly) picked up the hat, sat on the stool, and placed the hat on his head. "Hmmm," the hat said into Draco's ear, "a Malfoy... I should put you in Slytherin..." The blond smirked, "but there's so much more than that... I see it," Draco's smirk fell immediately after that statement. Draco frowned as the hat continued, "you possess a lot of knowledge... quite a lot of it actually. How interesting... your curiosity does not seem to cease itself, now does it? I see it now-- you must be... RAVENCLAW!"
Uncomfortable didn't even begin to describe how out of sorts Draco felt with his estranged cousin glowering at him from across the table. After the chaos that ensued earlier, Black and the mother Weasley sent Draco's school mates upstairs and forced Draco to give Black his wand and sit alone in the dining room. Well, Draco was alone at first; for a few minutes, Draco sat silently in the dining room whilst Black was off doing who know's what (Draco realizes later that the man was probably calling backup). Eventually, Black entered the room and sat across from Draco with an angry glint in his eye. While the two pureblooded men sat awkwardly at the dining room table, the Weasley matriarch paced in the kitchen, calmly rocking a still agitated Estella in her arms.
Malfoy nodded in response as the baby in his lap studied the bowl in his hand. Everyone in the room watched as Malfoy dug the spoon into the eggs and lifted the spoon to the baby's mouth. The girl sniffed the food and whined before turning her head away. Malfoy closed his eyes in frustration before opening them to gaze down at the baby. “For a one-year-old, you're really picky,” Malfoy mumbled. Malfoy sighed before putting a cheesy smile on his face and raising the pitch of his voice, “Wow! This food looks really good!” Malfoy said in a faux energetic tone. The Slytherin seemed to forget the other occupants of the dining room as he continued speaking to the toddler in an animated baby voice, “If you don't want it, then it's all mine!” Malfoy then put the spoon in his mouth and grimaced before placing a strained smile over it. “Mmm! So, good!” This seemed to have worked because the then disgusted girl was now reaching out to grab the bowl of food.
Draco forgot about his hunger pains and stared in horror at the sleeping girl in his arms. The blond observed his surroundings and saw that the never ending road was still vacant besides him and his sister. He stopped walking, sat down on the grass next to the pavement, and put Estella down on the grass in front of him. "Estella," Draco said, gently poking her round cheeks. "Estella, wake up," the baby made a noise before slowly opening her eyes. Draco stared into the girl's silver eyes and internally prayed that she wouldn't throw a fit. Thankfully, the toddler remained calm and babbled a few words in baby talk while reaching her arms out to her older brother. "Ba ba ba to you too," Draco murmured with a small smile on his face. The Slytherin placed the dark green backpack in front of him and peered inside. The bag was packed in haste and the interior looked like it; baby clothes and diapers were littered across the bag with no sense of organization. The bag was mainly filled with supplies for Estella, meanwhile Draco only packed an extra pair of undergarments, his favorite potions book, and a dragon plushie from his childhood. The blonde had a feeling that he wasn't going to return home in a very long time and packed accordingly... which meant packing a stuffed animal. Draco would never admit this to anyone but his dragon plushie, Fafnir, meant too much to him and he didn't have it in him to abandon the orange creature in the darkness of the Manor.
"Already?" Theo questioned with an incredulous look on his face. "What gossip could you possibly be discussing? School hasn't even started yet."
Blaise, Pansy, Vincent, Gregory, and even Theodore burst out laughing while Draco blushed in mortification. Daphne, on the other hand, gasped before slapping her friend's arm. "Millicent!"
“Oh! Yes! Accio baby's food!” Mrs. Weasley incanted as a bowl of scrambled eggs, avocado, and steamed peas landed in her hand. She handed Malfoy the bowl as she spoke, “It has been a while since I made baby food. I'll send Kreacher tomorrow to fetch more ingredients!”
"Yes, we just did actually," Hermione answered, pointing at the compartment her and Neville had just left. Draco nodded at Gregory and Vincent before strolling past Hermione and Neville and towards Harry Potter's compartment.
"Draco, go in there and request for her to fit you into your uniform," she demanded. She looked past Draco and Lucius before turning back to them. "I shall be in Ollivanders for the time being."
"Maybe," Lucius answered, "but why would you want go? First years are not allowed to have their own broomsticks, surely you know that?"
Draco thought to himself as he watched Estella chew messily on a banana chunk, spit escaping her mouth and falling onto her chin.
The three boys stared at Draco with an unspoken question. However, Draco did not have to hear it to know what it was. The blond sighed before responding, "My whole entire family has been Slytherins for since--" Draco stopped to think. "well... forever," He ended lamely, a light blush rising to his cheeks.
“FRED!” Mrs. Weasley bellowed while Sirius, Ginny, and George cackled and the rest grimaced with Malfoy looking especially green.
An idea came to Draco-- but if this was the answer, Draco wanted to AK himself. "Is the answer," Draco started, gaining the attention from all of the students around him. "a stick?"
DISCLAIMER: I am and always will be a fan of the Harry Potter series... HOWEVER, I do not support JK Rowling and her disgusting remarks about trans women. Trans women are women. If you disagree, just stop reading. Any bigotry of any kind isn't accepted here. As a woman of color, I'm not going to tolerate that shit! So please leave if you are racist, transphobic, homophobic, islamaphobic, etc.
Molly Weasley frowned. "They are most likely going to let you stay, but in the off-chance that they don't, I will make sure you stay," the redhead said, her voice drenched in determination. "I'm not letting two children, especially one who has suffered as much as yourself, be thrown out into the wild. It's too dangerous!"
Estella... she was the main reason why Draco fled. If Estella wasn't there, the teenager wouldn't have even entertained the thought of abandoning his mother like this. However, Draco felt like he had no choice but to run. The girl was only twelve months old— she was born in the month prior to the Quidditch World Cup. The toddler was so tiny and vulnerable... she had no place being near monsters like Greyback or the Carrows (or even his own father, aunt, uncle, or especially the Dark Lord... but Draco would never say that traitorous thought out loud lest he be put under the Cruciatus Curse for the rest of his life).
The Ravenclaw sighed before following Trelawney's instructions. He placed his elbows on the table and leaned in to get a better look at the crystal ball. At first, all the blonde saw was fog. However, as he continued to gaze into the ball, the fog slowly evaporated to reveal the face of a wrinkled old woman. Her eyes were a dark brown and her hair was brown streaked with strands of grey. Draco already knew her voice and now, he realized, he also recognized her face. "I know you," Draco said, his voice trembly and nervous.
While Lucius Malfoy being part of the Dark Lord's inner circle had some perks, it mostly came with disadvantages. For one, being the sole son of a prominent figure in the Dark Lord's army meant that Draco received more attention from the Dark Lord than he was comfortable with. The Dark Lord had a perverted interest in Draco. Whenever the man was over, he would always call the blonde to the study for a 'talk'. These 'talks' consisted of the Dark Lord leering at the teenager while stroking the head of his pet snake Nagini. Contrary to the name of their meetings, not many words were spoken during these 'talks', but when words were spoken, they mirrored the perverted remarks Carrow and Greyback also gave Draco. However, unlike the other two men, the Dark Lord was flamboyantly vulgar and straight to the point ("I missed having a physical form, little dragon," the Dark Lord once said in a soft tone. "Now, I can appreciate beautiful creatures such as yourself... both visually and physically," Draco's face flushed in mortification at the statement. The Dark Lord smirked as he saw Draco's blush and misinterpreted it as a pleasured response to his perverted implication. "When you receive your dark mark, pretty dragon, I will also gift you with pleasure. A true testament to your evolution into adulthood," Draco didn't bother correcting the older man that he still wouldn't be of age at the time of his scheduled recruitment. Instead, Draco focused on pushing the bile that was quickly building up in his throat down).
EDITED SCENES IN THE FIRST CHAPTER: I made a few edits in the first chapter! I added a portion about Draco being unable to tell Abra the address and figuring out that 12 Grimmauld Place was under the Fidelius Charm. That is a vital edit that I totally forgot to include originally! I also added a small detail about Draco bullying his dad into asking Voldemort to hold off on Draco's recruitment. I mainly added this to emphasize that Lucius didn't ask Voldemort out of concern for Draco but rather because Draco nagged him. Not super important to the general plot but it's important for setting up Lucius' character in this fanfic!
"I was given the location by the Secret Keeper," Draco answered in a soft tone, trying not to distress his baby sister more.
"Can you imagine?" The male Weasley laughed, wiping tears from his eyes. His wife smacked him and gave her husband a frown.
"Yes. I-I don't know why my brain came up with something so horrid! Especially with someone random like Malfoy! I don't know why I dreamt of him at all!" Harry exclaimed in confusion. Hermione bit her bottom lip and gave Harry a sympathetic look. Harry saw the look on Hermione's face and groaned, "Oh bollocks! Not this again!"
Lucius gave his son a small smile-- a smile that most wouldn't have seen. Draco smiled back, though this smile didn't crinkle the corner of his eyes like the last smile had. "Have fun, Draco, but not too much fun," Lucius scolded, his rare smile gone. "I expect you to be first in class."
"Cissy, don't taunt the boy," Lucius said, folding his paper and placing it down on the table in front of him. "He has every right to be excited. After all, my boy is becoming a man today."
Molly Weasley studied Draco with her warm brown eyes. "I'm sure you do," the woman finally said. "My family comes first, as does yours to you, I'm sure," Draco nodded in agreement. "But... you're still a child. And I can tell that you're a caring person beneath all of that pure-blooded snobbery-" Draco gave the woman an affronted look after that statement. "Don't look at me like that! I don't know you, Draco Malfoy, but I do know
Pansy opened the compartment door and stepped inside. Draco felt himself smile as he also stepped inside with alacrity. Inside the compartment sat four young boys whom Draco recognized immediately.
"HA!" Black gave a deep throaty laugh and then slowly, Lupin, the Weasley patriarch, and the purple haired girl began laughing too. Draco watched as half of the adults laughed and the other half gave each other looks of exasperation. "
Everyone was silent. Draco could only hear his own rapid heart beat and his (somewhat) controlled breathing.
“Estella,” Malfoy groaned as more food spilled out of her mouth. “Keep your mouth closed when you eat!”
Malfoy looked up at Harry with furrowed brows, “Estella…? I know you're as dense as a rock, but even you should understand this, Potter.”
“Right,” Harry responded weakly as he turned to look at Hermione, who was staring back at him with her eyes blown wide.
"If I can't help you two in that regard," the woman said before taking one hand off the wheel, grabbing a water bottle from the cup holder next to her, and handing it to Draco. "At least let me offer you two some water. You must be parched from your journey!"
, a list of old wizarding families that were truly pureblooded. Draco felt himself smirk; his family was very high in the food chain, the Greengrass'... not so much. Of course they weren't too low, but in pureblood standards they weren't very high, at least, not compared to the Malfoys.
When Draco left the Manor, it was midnight and now, it was the afternoon. He had been walking for around twelve or thirteen hours at this point and scarcely knew if he was going in the right direction. He only knew that this road led to London because a nice muggle in a muggle monster contraption told him so. That same muggle also offered to take Draco there but the blonde politely declined. As if he was going to step foot in that metal creature. Half a day into the journey and Draco was beginning to regret that decision. He was exhausted, hungry, and in so much pain. His legs were beginning to cramp and his arms hurt from holding Estella for so long. As for Estella, Draco had to change her nappy six times since leaving the Malfoy Manor and felt guilty about leaving the dirty diapers on the grass before moving on with his journey. Draco didn't want to carry those stinky things with him but he also didn't want to taint the earth with them too. The blonde just wished he could vanish them away but he didn't want to risk Death Eaters finding him.
"Since you asked..." the brunette let out a dramatic sigh before continuing, "I heard that we have a celebrity on the train."
The boys all turned to see Pansy in front of an open compartment door. Theo smirked at her, "Harry Potter told Draco to piss off when Draco attempted to make him his friend."
The boy next to Draco, now known as Michael, scoffed, "You know, for a bloke who was really excited to be my friend on the train earlier, you were pretty quick to betray me for little albino over here."
Draco couldn't take it anymore. "Yes?" Draco asked, attempting to hold back a sneer. Trelawney blinked a few times before responding.
As in Draco 'I hate mudbloods because I'm second to one in class' Malfoy?" Hermione said in a mocking tone. Harry let out a loud laugh and threw a pillow at the girl.
"I thought fancy purebloods were supposed to keep it in their pants before marriage, Forge!" - George
The dark-skinned Auror who Draco now knew as Shacklebolt nodded, took a moment to gather his thoughts, and then began talking again. "You said earlier that you confided in Snape over things that were worrying you, yes?" Draco nodded, not liking where this line of questioning was going. "What was worrying you?"
Draco gulped nervously. How can he even answer this? He can't say anything truthful without incriminating his parents and admitting he's gone traitor. And Draco would rather drop dead than discuss the Dark Lord's perverted interest in him. Maybe he could just lie-
"Why, Draco?" Trelawney asked as the airiness of her vanished abruptly. Draco eyed her with a suspicious look. "We will meet again next Monday just after dinner. And don't eat any of the beef-- it is under cooked."
Eventually, Draco was lying down in his new dorm room. His roommates--Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner, and Terry Boot-- were already sleeping while Draco was wide awake, staring up at his ceiling. Draco's whole entire life had changed drastically in just a few hours... and he hoped that it didn't change for the worse.
"This subject matter has been spoken of too many times, Lucius. He is going to Hogwarts," Narcissa concluded, frowning at her husband. "And that's final."
Draco shuddered and immediately went back to staring at his food (and he could've sworn he heard Millicent's evil witch laugh but that was besides the point). "You know," Draco's head shot up to see Terry watching him. "You can still be friends with them. I heard that Slytherins and Gryffindors hate each other, not Ravenclaws and Slytherins."
This statement caused many of the adults to share looks with each other. The Auror kept his eyes on Draco and said, "that's all he did? He didn't tell you anything else?"
. The young Malfoy stared at the blue table cloth in front of him, dreading his parents' reaction to the news. Dreading his school year(s) at Hogwarts. Dreading-
The silence was brutal. Draco scratched his cheek awkwardly and stared back at his cousin before saying, "So-"
Next chapter will be classes, more classes, Halloween, and Trelawney meeting up with Draco 'by chance'. Also there will be a vision next chapter ;))))
"I'm just saying that you can't call the albino an emo when you're an emo!" the blond boy explained, his statement causing Draco furrow his brows in confusion and Michael to do the same but in annoyance.
"Oh yes, father, I know," Draco returned, morphing his face to display an innocent look. "I just wish to... browse. That's all."
BUT here's the next chapter. From now on expect one chapter a month unless I somehow manage to pull my lazy ass to write two lol.
The girl frowned slightly. She eyed the three boys in front of her, "I'm Hermione Granger," she said. "and this is Neville Longbottom."
Remus put down the paper and looked at his watch. “Supper should be starting soon… Sirius said he would grab the two before heading down himself. So, most likely, he'll be down in a few minutes.”
"Hello to you too, Blaise," Draco responded. Blaise was tall for his age; even when all of the children sat down, Draco still had to tilt his head slightly to look up at the other boy. His face was thin and his eyes were of a shockingly light brown, contrasting with his dark skin.
Draco swallowed the last piece of his Cauldron Cake before turning towards Gregory and Vincent. "Greg, Vince, lets go meet Harry Potter," the blond stood up and slid open their compartment door. Draco stopped before leaving and looked over at the two boys. "Well? Are you coming?"
Pansy forced a smile onto her face before quickly changing he subject, "As much as that sucks, Draco, I didn't come here to discuss Potter, I came here to tell you all that we're about to arrive at Hogwarts."
Also since I've been busy with driver's ed and ACT studying, it takes a while to find time to just write. Usually a chapter takes at least a week or more for me atm.
The blond blinked a few times before he took off the hat and quickly walked towards the Ravenclaw table. Slowly, the Ravenclaws began to clap for their new member, who had already sat down next to another first year at the end of the table.
Because you seemed very excited a week ago," Narcissa reminded Draco, smirking as she did. Draco frowned, remembering the high-pitched scream that erupted from his throat after he received his Hogwarts acceptance letter.
"See you in school!" the boys heard the girl's voice but decided to ignore it, instead focusing on the celebrity they were about to meet. Draco slid the compartment door open. He held his breath.
"You are a Malfoy," Lucius' voice was loud and steady. Draco straightened his back in response. "you must show your peers why Malfoys are to be feared and respected."
Silence filled the room. The two stared at each other. Trelawney stared in what seemed to be an analytical gaze, meanwhile Draco stared back in discomfort. The blond licked his bottom lip anxiously before turning his gaze away from the teacher. "You said you wanted to meet me-"
BTW my version of Draco is still gonna be smug and rude but he's gonna be pretty introverted because of all of the visions he has... not that he wants to be but because everyone thinks he's really weird RIP so they avoid him.
Harry let out a sigh and ran a hand through his tangled black locks, "I don't know. They were saying that Malfoy and some girl named Estella went missing?" Harry recounted as he tried to remember the rest of the dream. Suddenly, Harry remembered the reason Malfoy's mother gave for Malfoy's disappearance and blushed. Hermione, being the observant girl she is, noticed the blush immediately and pounced on it.
The average boy frowned slightly at that. Draco assumed it was because he was also upset about first years not being allowed their own brooms and carried on, "Have you got your own broom?" Draco asked.
As Draco fed his sister the banana, he thought back to the events leading up to his and his sister's escape. After the Dark Lord's resurrection, life had gone downhill for Draco. While the Dark Lord and his followers haven't officially moved into the Manor, they might as well have since they were visiting the mansion on an almost daily basis. The Death Eaters never dared to touch Draco due to his father's standing but that didn't stop them from making comments that made Draco very uncomfortable. Fenrir Greyback, while not a Death Eater, constantly made statements about how good Draco smelled and Amycus Carrow also made gross remarks about how he imagined running his hands through Draco's pale locks. However, nothing was worse than the Dark Lord's appraisals.
The towheaded boy searched the train; his eyes squinted and his lips pouted as he attempted to catch sight of his pureblood friends. His search was cut short when he heard a girl's voice screech behind him, "Draco!" the blond turned around to see a raven-haired girl clad in black robes. She was small-- a dainty girl. Her hair was up to her chin, bangs cut neatly, straight across her forehead. Her hazel eyes were wide in excitement. The girl wore a large grin on her face as she waved frantically at Draco. "Come over here, Draco!"
Harry cheeks flushed again as he looked down at a loose thread on the comforter. The teenaged boy picked at the thread before murmuring, "Like... sexually."
The first weekend of the school-year finally arrived and Draco was relieved. He and his roommates wandered around the castle aimlessly, boredom creeping up on them. The castle was like a maze, Draco concluded. It was a well known fact that the staircases moved constantly but Draco and his roommates theorized that some of the rooms moved as well-- at least, it was an excuse for getting lost on the way to Transfiguration so many times.
"They should be arriving any-" Hermione's sentence was cut off by a great silver phoenix flying through the sky and chasing away the hoards of hovering Dementors, "Minute now." Hermione finished lamely as they watched the Dementors being chased away.
Today was one of the days where Hermione had rushed in to join him behind the floor to ceiling brass gates that separated the two sections of the Library. Madam Pince eyed them warily every time they bypassed the
“I’ve been watching him for a while though, I know him, and he knows me. He’s different this year, quieter, more reserved, I think Voldemort being back has changed something in him.” Harry smiled to himself and rubbed the back of his neck, “And he’s incredibly fit and an extremely great kisser.”
Love you all. Thanks for all the Kudos and the comments! I always love getting those little emails :)
“What did you see, Harry?” Sirius’s tone was low, already apologetic even though Harry hadn’t really said very much.
“Murder breaks apart the soul, that’s how a Horcrux is made in the first place. That’s what I did, I murdered someone.”
"No one will think any less of you if you go into Quidditch you know." Draco pointed out. Harry jumped, but blushed.
Snow had fallen over Hogwarts, it blanketed the castle and its grounds with a thick layer of white fluff. Harry was glad for it, it meant that he wasn’t aching to be outside on his broom when he was in the Library with Hermione. They had so much work to do for classes and Hermione had to carve time out of her revision schedule to help him with his research in the restricted section. Harry knew if he was going to get anywhere he would need Hermione. She had an ability to pick up a book and determine whether it was useful or not within five seconds, the same thing took Harry five minutes. Twice a week Hermione would pick through the Restricted Section, pulling out as many books as she could before her free time was up and she needed to go back to her school work. Then Harry would look through those books in much more detail, slowly eliminating them one by one until Hermione was free to pull out another massive stack. Usually they were the only two in the Restricted Section, once or twice a Professor would pass through the dusty shelves for their own personal research, or the more rare occasion of a Seventh year being escorted by Madam Pince to whichever book they had requested.
“Have you narrowed down the search?” She asked as she pulled out her first book of the evening. They had been searching for any mention of widespread memory charms, person, or item specific memory charms, or really just anything that mentioned memory charms at all, in the vague hope that there would be some innocuous sentence that would lead them somewhere new.
“There’s the sword.” Ron pointed at a shelf behind the large desk that stood towards the centre of the room.
“She’ll definitely be with us. You should see the way she looks at Snape, it would almost be funny if it weren’t so serious.” Seamus said with a half smile. Seamus always was the easiest one to crack a grin.
"Fucking Slytherins." Harry muttered. Out of the corner of his eye saw Draco open his mouth to argue, but he quickly snapped it shut again. More than aware that Harry may have a bit of a point there.
"Do you ever stop being a fucking hero Potter? If you expect me to fall to my knees and kiss your feet as thanks for saving my life then you're sorely mistaken."
Another short one I'm afraid. But we're gearing up for a little bit of drama, so hold onto your hats! Haha
The easy mood between them soon dropped, and they stood in silence. Harry was leaning back against the door, he had his arms crossed, and his head was tilted back far enough to be looking at the ceiling. Draco had taken a seat opposite him on top of a crate of practice Quaffles and had settled with his forearms resting against his knees. The sheen of sweat had disappeared from Harry’s forehead, and the redness of Draco’s lips returned to their usual pale pink as the deep flush from his skin faded.
“Open.” Harry said with ease, it had become second nature now to slip into the snake language, they had entered the Chamber of Secrets so often last year that he had become accustomed to it.
"Hello there." Draco said with a smile. He gave her little hand a soft stroke with one finger and she smiled and tried to grab it.
"Alright, it's a date." The American slanted a half smile at him, flashing him with a row of pearly white teeth. Draco faltered at that, he hadn't meant to invite him as a date at all. The man was attractive there was no doubt about that, not too tall, light brown hair that was neatly styled with care, brown eyes, and a nice smile. His robes were clean and while not this season definitely would have been last season, which meant he cared about his appearance but he wasn't obsessed (not like Draco). He was nice. Attractive. But he wasn't Harry Potter. And Draco was so embroiled into this odd
"Think of your happiest memory. And. Cast. The. Spell." He said it slowly and so pointedly that Draco didn’t have it within him to deny Potter again.
“Sirius Black.” Harry took a deep breath and steeled himself as he waited for Sirius to pick up the mirror.
“You know, I hadn’t ever considered what I would actually do after Hogwarts.” Harry peered out of the window next to them and looked over at the lake and the forest below, “Actually living through my teenage years was a bit more of an abstract concept to me.” Draco kicked him under the table, and glared at him.
"I have a room." Potter said and he sounded almost as breathless as Draco. As though Draco was affecting Harry as much as Harry was affecting him.
"You'd be a really good Healer I reckon." Draco didn't respond but Harry saw the way his lips curled up very slightly at the corners. They didn't say anything else for a couple of minutes, Draco was flipping through the information he'd just nabbed from Harry and Harry was busy looking back and forth between his two possible options.
“They’ll be here at sunset. That’s what he said.” The voice in the vision had been so chilling that even remembering it sent a chill down his spine.
Draco hovered overhead for the majority of the game. Every now and then he would shoot over to one side of the pitch, making Summerby believe he had spotted the Snitch, only to start drifting about once he had made it to the other end. Even throughout his strategy of throwing off the opposite Seeker he kept both eyes peeled for the Snitch, he needed to catch it quickly. Being one Chaser down was already starting to take its toll on the overall score. All of the Slytherin plays counted on there being three Chasers to pull them off, so Montague and Pucey were left to figure it out between themselves. Draco watched as goal after goal was scored by the Hufflepuff team. His jaw clenched. Once again he noticed Summerby starting to zone in on one area of the pitch, as though he had seen something, so Draco bent low over his broom and shot straight forward, brushing by the Hufflepuff and knocking him off balance, causing him to lose sight of whatever had caught his eye.
Draco regretted the words the moment they left his mouth. If anyone would have asked him at a later date he would have sworn that he didn't scream in terror as Dementors descended upon them in a tight circle. And he definitely didn't clutch at Potter's bicep as they circled closer and closer, hovering over the ground and towering over them. They were closing in on the two Hogwarts students until they were close enough to reach out and grasp at their clothing. Harry's Patronus joined them after a single moment, pushing the Dementors back as much as possible and pacing in front of Harry to ward them off as much as possible.
"Well then what do I do? We just keep falling into bed together." He stabbed at the fillet with more aggression than was necessarily called for.
“Come on Harry, you can’t possibly think that he’s in his right mind? He brought a giant to a school!”
“Are you even bothered?” Draco asked, as his chest finally pressed fully against Harry’s and Harry’s firm thigh found its way between his own. His mouth hovering only inches away.
“Parseltongue?” Ron suggested. Harry wondered why he hadn’t thought of that before, of course it could only be opened with Parseltongue, and Tom Riddle’s ego was once again foiled. Thinking that no one else could find the Room of Requirement had lost him the Diadem, underestimating their Soulbond had lost him the Cup, and now, forgetting that more than one person could speak Parseltongue, would lose him the Locket.
Hope you all had a lovely Christmas and I mentally toast you all to the end of a truly fucked up year.
"Oh, at least two hours. This is a good cause after all, it’s very important that people see you here."
"I'll just go to his house then." He said stubbornly. But he dropped back down onto the sofa with a huff and continued to stab at the salmon until it disappeared into flakes amongst the lettuce.
“Not yet...I don’t...kn-” Harry stammered as his vision darkened and his balance failed him. The searing hot pain jack-knifing through his forehead was secondary to the hissing voice that had forced its way into his mind.
"Okay." Draco whispered at the end of a breathy exhale. Then almost immediately he was being folded into Potters arms and his mouth was being taken with a ferocity that only came from being denied for an entire evening. Draco felt Potter twist on the spot and then he was being apparated.
Draco’s breath caught in his throat. He knew this memory held information that Harry needed to know, he just wished that Harry had felt comfortable enough to share it with him. Hermione had never let go of his wrist, there had been so much to process that he had forgotten, but the fingernails piercing into his skin were a stark reminder.
Malfoy. By himself. He looked up from the parchment in his hand. The corner of his lips curled upwards in a barely there smile when he saw Harry but when his eyes caught on Hermione his expression steeled once more. He stuffed the parchment into his bag but didn’t attempt to move or walk away. Draco wasn’t entirely sure why he had felt the need to stop in his tracks, he was pretty sure that their brief snogging session had negated the need for a fight or flight response, but he couldn’t be entirely sure how the girl would react and if he was about to be hexed he would rather it not be aimed at his back.
Harry was spreading jam on toast for his breakfast when the owls entered the Hall with that day's post. Harry only needed to glance up at the ridiculous amount of owls streaming through the charmed sky to know that the Quibbler had already made the rounds in some circles. The first owl to land was from Xenophilias Lovegood, holding a rolled up copy of the Quibbler. Harry took it, petted the owls feathers in thanks and waited for it to fly away.
“It was telling me that I had a fractured soul, that it would make my soul whole.” Draco was still and silent behind him. But Harry felt the jump of confusion through his mind, “It said that half of my soul was whole and the other half wasn’t.” Harry paused as he tried to consider those words and what they meant, “But I have no idea what it was talking about.”
“So why does everyone keep telling me how great and amazing my Dad was when he was nothing more than a cocky bully?” When he was nothing more than a magical Dudley Dursley, Harry wanted to say. And that was the crux of it really, wasn’t it? Harry couldn’t stand people being treated that way because he too was once treated that way. He too, was once someone’s punching bag, someone’s victim. He was someone’s Severus Snape. Maybe twenty years from now he’d be standing in front of Dudley's kids telling them how cocky and arrogant their Father had been.
“Why did he tell you anyway? He’s been back for months now, surely he could have told you when he first got back?”
“I thought you couldn’t come up here.” Harry said quietly. He could tell that people wanted to greet him, but he was thankful they were giving him this moment.
Draco and Hermione watched in horror, along with a ghostly Harry, as Dumbledore begged Snape to kill him. To fulfil exactly what the Dark Lord had demanded of him. Dumbledore hadn’t suspected, for a moment, that Snape hadn’t been loyal. He had been playing Dumbledore the whole time and the older wizard hadn’t figured it out at all, or maybe he had? And it just wasn’t important at the time, it seemed that either way Snape needed to kill Dumbledore.
He took hold of the knocker and he knocked twice, sharp and firm. He heard the Potter's before he saw them.
“If this is real then he’d be daft not to.” She smiled at him and then spoke the password to the Fat Lady and led the way into the Common room.
“I just … I needed to ask you something. It’s kind of important.” Harry stalled, he realised that this probably wasn’t the best decision when Sirius looked at him more worried than ever before. Way to go Harry.
"Kids are with Ginny tonight." Potter announced. To any bystander it was a perfectly acceptable conversation, but Draco knew better. The kids are with Ginny, my house is empty, my
That had been the wrong thing to say apparently. Harry’s pupils dilated an almost impossible amount, the green of his irises taken over by the darkness of his pupils. One of Harry’s hands found the hard plane of Draco's hip, while the other wrapped around Draco's wrist to pull his finger away from his chest and slowly tug Draco closer. Draco hadn't realised how hard he had been panting until he was practically chest to chest with Harry and with every inhale he took the front of his body was almost pressed completely against Harry’s. They were tucked almost entirely behind a marble statue and Draco realised how easy it would be for Harry to lean forward and kiss him until they both couldn't remember their own names.
"Yes, please." Harry's hand landed on his lower back to lead him towards the bar and Draco's cheeks flushed as he remembered what those hands had been doing last time they had seen each other.
Your comments fuel me. Thank you all so much for the lovely feedback, I appreciate every single comment and every single Kudos :)
"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have- It's not important, I'll just see you when you're back at work. Sorry." Draco turned from the door, turning his back on the little family that he had no business getting involved with. He couldn't speak to Potter with his children around, that was just inappropriate.
“Well done today.” Harry said finally with a cheerful grin and he nudged Draco’s knee with his own under the table.
“I was. Maybe it knew the Headmaster had abandoned the school? It opened for me last time because there was no assigned Headmaster.”
Hermione sat at the Gryffindor table that dinner time looking immensely pleased with herself. And once again Harry vowed to never get on her bad side. Brightest Witch of her age
“I’ll leave you to it, and I won’t tell Ron just yet, but I’ll be watching you to make sure you’re okay. It’s all a bit sudden though, isn’t it? You’re panting after him already, but you’ve only snogged once.”
Harry pushed against the barrier that was keeping his magic confined once more. He had to save his Soulmate. He wasn’t even giving a thought to the screams in his head, his desire to help Draco overshadowed everything else. He remembered the way Draco's fingers would cradle his jaw as they kissed. He remembered the way his breath would escape in little pants against Harry's mouth. He remembered the long line of his chest and the slender curve of his hips. He remembered every inch of Draco's body and every moment Draco had surrendered it to him. He remembered every single time Draco's bright beautiful soul shone like a beacon through his pale grey eyes. A soul which didn’t belong to a Dementor.
“No. I’ve kept the one with all the origins of Obliviate, I think that might have some use. But apart from that I’m not seeing anything here that applies to what we need.” Harry picked up the two books he had discarded and followed Hermione down the rows so he could slot the two books back into their places.
"You'll never be a Weasley to me, don't be ridiculous. You are and always will be a Granger." Draco's response was always something along those lines and it never failed to make Hermione smile. Which she needed right now, considering she couldn't find that one bloody file that she desperately needed.
Draco didn’t need to examine the room to discover the first important piece of information, he was standing right next to Harry, and it took a second or two of staring at the side of Harry’s head to work out exactly what was going on. At first he wondered if Harry had been there, in the Memory that Dumbledore had extracted but then he realised Harry was also standing on the side-lines, watching a conversation between Dumbledore and Snape just like he and Hermione were. This wasn’t Dumbledore’s memory, this was Harry’s. He met Hermione’s eye to point this out but she was already nodding in understanding without needing him to say a single word.
“Ready?” Draco asked. He looked to Hermione who was already nodding and holding onto his wrist. Without allowing himself a second thought Draco leaned forward and plunged his head into the Pensieve.
“I look a mess. I bet my hair is all over the place, you had your hands all over it.” He pulled out his wand and spelled his hair back to its usual coiffed appearance.
“Oh. Do you want Remus to go?” He asked. His expression was obvious, ‘please don’t make me do this by myself.’
“So what else has been going on?” Sirius asked. And Harry jumped right into telling him about Draco being his Soulmate, about their brief split, about Warrington and his transfer, and how Umbridge had blasted her way into the Room of Requirement. It was nice to talk to him. Harry tried not to think about how much he had missed out on by not having his Mum, his Dad and his Godfather in his life. He had never been able to just sit and chat to an adult. The Dursleys had always preferred him to be as silent as possible, he didn’t even know what Vernon would have done if Harry had tried to sit and talk to him about his school work. Whenever he saw Dumbledore there was always something more pressing to talk about than how he was doing in school. And he would never be able to ignore that Mr Weasley was his best friend's Dad, even though he was sure that he would have sat down with Harry if Harry had requested it.
"Yes of course. A date would be lovely." Draco smiled at him and quickly gave him the information for the Gala.
"And now?" She asked, her voice barely above a whisper. It was rare for Harry to lay his feelings out for her and she was being careful not to ruin the moment that had fallen over them.
.” Harry continued, and Draco stepped closer so that he could watch as the emotions passed across Harry’s face. His hand fell from Hermione’s grip and she took a few steps back to allow him to approach Harry alone.
"Is he a stranger, Dad? Should we shut the door?" James asked as he cranked his head up to look at his Father.
“I think you’d be a fantastic Defence Professor.” Draco shrugged, “But honestly I don’t care either way. Why would I? I'll be just as happy to return home to a fit Quidditch player as I would a fit Auror." Draco flushed at his admission but didn't take it back. Truth be told, it was the first time he had mentioned being with Harry after they finished Hogwarts. Harry grinned in response but didn’t pry into the subject, which Draco was immensely thankful for.
“What spells did you find?” He asked. She smiled at him and began telling him about a simple healing charm that might stop someone from bleeding out if they were hit with a cutting curse, and a spell that would transfigure an inanimate item into a weapon.
“Just went out for a fly, Umbridge made me miss a few practices so I thought I’d let the snitch go a few times.” Harry left out the part where Malfoy had turned up halfway through and had caught the snitch at the opposite side of the stadium to where Harry was flying entirely. Initiating a bit of a competition. And he especially missed out the part where he found himself locked in the broom shed with his tongue in Malfoys mouth. Hermione just nodded at his explanation and dropped the last pillow onto the big pile in the corner of the room.
"I have...A date." Draco replied breathlessly, pausing in the middle to release a pant. He couldn't just disappear on him, that would be so rude and he really was a lovely man.
Draco had barely raised the glass of whiskey to his mouth when he made eye contact with Potter across the room. Draco nodded to him in greeting before turning back to his date and laughing at something he had said, he hadn’t actually caught the joke but the people they were standing with were laughing so Draco assumed it had been something vaguely funny. Draco's hand found it's way back to his date’s arm and he was more than happy to stay that way for most of the evening.
"Drink, Draco?" He asked and they made their way around the dancefloor. Stopping now and them for Draco to cordially introduce his date to his co-workers and other higher-ups in the Ministry.
“How did Dumbledore destroy the rest of them?” Draco asked. Harry realised, fairly horrified, that Dumbledore hadn’t told him. Not once had he mentioned how he had destroyed the ring or the diadem. The diary though, Harry had destroyed that one himself.
Draco reached out with that same long finger and nudged a pamphlet titled Apprenticeships. Harry looked at it for a second before looking up at Draco in confusion. He hadn’t even looked through the information, he’d only grabbed it because it was on the table with all the rest of them.
After that it had been the thrill of it, being able to get away with sneaking out in the middle of a party. Dragging each other up to one of their offices in the Ministry, or to a room in the five star hotel that had hosted the holiday events, or a cleaning closet in one of the Ancient wizarding Manors. It had been months of sneaking around, months of heated gazes flashed to each other across ballroom floors, of subtle innuendos murmured around half deaf 100 year old Witches who thought they were "
"Harry, you were the youngest Seeker in a century. You were born with talent." Draco rolled his eyes.
“I think it’s pretty.” Albus said, while he pushed his broccoli to one side of his plate with a look of distaste.
Harry just laughed again and started to dig in. After a few mouthfuls he looked up and caught the pale grey eyes he had been staring into earlier. Draco was watching him. And suddenly Harry was hyper aware of his still wet hair casually dripping down the back of his neck, and aware that he'd grabbed a shirt that was slightly too tight, so much so that it stretched across his shoulders and arms as he moved. His sudden growth spurt over the summer had made some of his shirts a little too close fitting, Sirius had replaced most of them but he had kept hold one or two of his favourites. Harry blushed at the scrutiny, but sent a quick small smile towards Draco before turning back to Ron.
Ron climbed down the short ladder first, at the bottom he caught Ginny in a hug and did the rounds, shaking hands, slapping people on the back in solidarity. When Harry descended he went right to a very nervous Pansy. Something was wrong there and he had to do right by Draco by checking on his best friend first.
“Do you have a permission slip to enter the Restricted Section?” The Librarian asked him with pursed lips and pinched cheeks as she bore down on him, she was shorter than him but for some reason Draco felt like she was looking down at him.
"France." Draco said honestly. He had apparated into the country that afternoon specially for the Event and hadn't had the chance to get in touch with any of his friends or colleagues. "Oh." Potter said and then after an awkward pause where Draco's hands were still fisted into the material at his shoulders and his legs were still wrapped around Harry's waist, Harry said "Do you want to keep talking about my ex-wife? Or can I fuck you now?"
“Would you think any less of them if you found out that they had made the choice to sacrifice one life to save countless others?” Draco let Harry think on that for a second before continuing with his point, “Because each one has gone through this war before, and each one will have been faced with the same decision as you. And you didn’t just stop him from killing one man, you stopped him from killing all the Witches and Wizards that he would have gone on to torture and kill afterwards.”
“He just, well he could have done anything to me. We were in there for quite a while. We, you know, did THAT," Harry raised his eyebrows a couple of times to get his point across, "But we chatted for a bit too. And I wanted more, he’s the one that stopped us.” Harry stopped them just outside the common room, the fat lady looked down at them in anticipation, “Will you please trust me Hermione. If anything starts to feel shady, I’ll let you know, but I think this is real.”
(Also, the formatting really fucks up when you put italics inside speech marks and I do this a lot. I'm working on the formatting and trying to figure out how to stop it from doing that, so bear with me for the formatting with speech marks and italics because I'm aware it's coming out a little weird)
I await your responses to this new fic and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking this journey with me.
“Right,” Ron’s hands dropped to his side once more, “Obviously, of course there would be spells on it.” He shook his head at his own thoughtlessness, “Do you know how to get past them?”
“Black market?” Ron suggested, “Whoever that RAB was might not have been able to destroy it before You-Know-Who killed them, and their belongings might have been sold off.”
“James, stop feeding your broccoli to the plant.” Draco turned to him and sure enough Harry had caught his son midway through him spearing pieces of broccoli and attempting to flick them into the fern that sat behind his chair. Draco didn’t even know how he had seen it, he was already alternating between feeding himself and feeding the baby, with a fork in each hand.
"I did an interview in Hogsmeade. I thought it would be okay Professor, it was in my own time." Harry feigned innocence, and Hermione had been clever enough to organise it so that it didn't break any of Umbridge's Educational Decrees. Umbridge knew it too.
All it came down to, was Harry not hating him anymore. How could he? Ever since the start of term Draco had withdrawn into himself. He had begun to create distance between him and the other Slytherins, at least as much as he could without tipping anyone off. Other people might not have noticed but Harry had, after four years of watching him Harry knew that something had happened over the summer. Something to change his mind about how great and wonderful Voldemort was. And seeing him today on the Quidditch pitch, holding the snitch over his head in delight at finally out flying ‘Harry Potter’, Harry had to admit that he had maybe fallen just a little bit in love with him.
“Among other things.” Harry muttered as his eyes drifted closed under the physical and emotional onslaught of love that Draco was forcing onto him. Draco chuckled against his skin breathlessly.
"Oh please Draco, you must think me blind." She looked up from her desk and eyed him with a raised eyebrow and pursed lips.
"You know I can't say who." Draco had told many people that he was sleeping with someone on a regular basis, he just hadn't told anyone that said person was Harry fucking Potter.
“Oh dear.” Came Remus’s voice, out of frame but still hanging around in the background. Sirius’s face paled and his jaw clenched. This was not a conversation he had been looking forward to.
“Oh my God.” Hermione panted, “Oh my God. Where have they gone? They’re so stupid. I can’t believe they’d leave like this, what could they possibly have been thinking-” Draco cut her off mid-tirade when he noticed the one item in the room that had been moved.
“No.” Harry said with a thoughtful nod, “How sure are we that this is Dumbledore’s magic?” Harry asked while casting a glance to Ron who was staring at the sword thoughtfully.
“It’s too late to worry about that now.” Hermione interrupted, not wanting to allow Harry to ponder on it for too long, “How did you destroy the Diary?”
They moved quickly through the streets, collecting cowering students from doorways and side streets who were pale and shaking from prolonged exposure to the Dementors. As soon as Ginny's Horse flickered out of sight Luna took point, her large Hare bound about in mid-air and forced the formidable Dementors to flee back to the skies. At the rear of their rapidly growing group were Hermione and Ernie, taking it in turns to push back the encroaching Dementors. On either side were Ron and Seamus. Between them they had created a protective ring around the defenceless students. The defenceless students and Harry. He stared down at his wand uselessly as they walked slowly through the streets. He might as well just throw the damn thing away for all the good it was doing him.
“Fucking Umbridge.” Harry laughed and nodded in agreement, as he pushed passed him into the dorm room. He pulled off his shirt and threw it over his trunk as he went, “I’m gonna head down to the Great Hall, how long are you gonna be?”
“Harry!” Hermione was blushing but she was smiling too. Harry was right, there had been the usual goading from Malfoy, a few insults tossed about, but they hadn’t got into any physical fights so far. The insults were banal, without the cutting edge of Malfoys usual intellect. He seemed to be focusing more on his studies, than on the rivalry between the Slytherins and the Gryffindors.
"What is the meaning of this?!" She shrilled, motioning at the decimation of various breakfast items strewn across the table.
Instead of casting a string of counter spells like he had originally intended, Harry levelled his wand at the glass and recalled the dark magic detection spell that Draco had taught him when they had been searching for the Diadem. Unlike the Diadem, the case containing Gryffindor’s Sword didn’t light up with the tell tale glow of dark magic. That meant no hexes. No curses. No spell with evil intent.
“We didn’t win.” Draco said, trying to shrug off the compliment but flushing under Harry’s scrutiny.
"I-" Potter spun around, leaving his stag to push the Dementors away of its own will. He reached up and cupped Draco's jaw with a pair of strong hands. His palms and his fingertips were calloused and rough, but warm against the cold skin of Draco’s face.
I'm sorry I killed Neville! But I had to kill someone and I couldn't let it be Remus. I couldn't let everyone skip off into the sunset all happy happy haha it was a war after all.
“Yeah,” Sirius said, turning to the side and answering the question from the disembodied voice, “Moony’s here too.” Sirius said to Harry. Oh great, he was going to ruin the day for both of his Dads best friends.
Potter's house was modest, although to Draco most houses were modest. He was far too used to Malfoy Manor with its cavernous ceilings and large ballrooms. Harry's house was actually kind of lovely. From previous visits Draco knew that it had four bedrooms, a full suite bathroom and an en-suite attached to Harry's room. Upstairs each door had the children's names plastered in bright foam letters across the front, the boys’ in greens, blues and reds and Lily's in pinks and purples. The first time he had seen it Draco had commented that it was awfully sexist, what if she liked the colour blue.
Draco looked at him carefully, they were standing facing each other now. In the same position they had been when Draco had entered the house, except now there wasn’t a baby wedged between them in the narrow corridor. Draco’s breath hitched in his throat as he met Harry’s gaze, his eyes still shining as brightly through the lens of his glasses as they did when he wore contacts for special occasions. Draco was close enough to see the hint of grey peeking through his hairline, the very slight sprinkle of salt and pepper throughout his otherwise black beard. This version of Potter was very very new to him. He knew Potter to be dashingly handsome and infuriatingly sexy without even trying. He knew the Potter that could make him moan and make his toes curl in pleasure. He knew sleepy Potter, drunk Potter, just fucked Potter, horny Potter...He didn’t know Dad Potter. He didn’t know the man that he had seen today, the one with a three day beard, the one who can cook, the one who laughs as his child slaps her food covered hands against his arm. He had come with the intention of breaking things off. Of telling Harry that the last time had actually been the last time, because he was getting too old to keep messing around with one and two night stands (eight, nine, ten night stand?), he wanted a future with someone. But Hermione’s words almost seemed to echo through his mind, “
Harry found himself trying to come up with a half answer, anything that would get Draco to back off until he had managed to organise his own mind on the matter. He could feel his body start to twitch, urging him to turn away and leave the room, to leave Draco waiting for an answer until he was ready to give one. But they had already spoken about this. About their mutual penchant for fleeing from their problems rather than facing each other and talking them through. Harry hadn’t realised how far the bad habit had ingrained into him until this moment. He fought against his instinct to run and his instinct to brush Draco off and he crossed the room, passing Draco to sit at the end on their bed.
“He’s expecting Umbridge to get rid of him sooner rather than later, and he wants us to…keep him company…I guess, and teach him English.”
The look that Hermione shot him from across the room made his skin crawl and his stomach roll. That wasn’t a look that said ‘all is well’, that was a look you gave someone when a family member had just died. Draco apologised to the two former Ministry employees and excused himself from their discussion about future policy reform after the war was over. He hoped that Hermione’s problem wouldn’t take too long for them to solve, it was almost lunchtime and he knew he couldn’t be late to this lunch date with Harry. The way he looked when Draco had left the room that morning had worried him to no end. He knew that Harry had watched Dumbledore’s memory, it had gone from standing on the edge of the desk next to the Pensieve, to tucked away in Harry’s bedside drawer. He hadn’t pushed so far because he knew Harry needed space to process, but it had got to the point where he needed answers. He needed to know what had caused this mental rift between them and he needed to know what Harry was thinking of doing. He wanted to be able to help Harry with his problems.
"I don't know what you're talking about." Draco said. But he had frozen, and his fork hovered in mid-air over the fillet of salmon hiding amongst the lettuce of his salad.
Just wanted to say a massive thank you to everyone who's reading this fic and taking the time to kudos or comment. You're all spurring me on to complete my next big project. I appreciate it so much and I celebrate every single hit/kudos/comment/bookmark/subscribe. You're all fantastic <3
“How far along are you?” the third woman, who Draco assumed must be Felicity asked. She had mermaid dyed hair and a daisy chain tattoo around her wrist.
“Second question, did Professor Vector tell you that in fact it was perfectly fine to use the Porrage-Colson formula and you should stop worrying about it?”
“Mm,” Draco nodded, “I think it would be nice, but…” Draco trailed off unsurely, wondering if he would come across as needy or pressuring if he asked for what he truly wanted.
“Don’t you think it’s weird though?” Harry frowned, “The idea of me going out on the pull whilst someone else is carrying my baby? I mean what am I going to do, have a quick fumble with Gabby in the club loos before coming home and crawling into bed with Draco to feed the baby magic?”
“But a whole bunch of people from Fred and George’s year are coming too!” Ron exclaimed. “You know how fit some of Angelina’s friends are. Remember Gabby Baldan? She’s single now.”
Draco had found himself wiping away hot, angry tears as he had balled the letter up in his fist and chucked it into the fire.
Draco could feel the anger threatening to overtake him, bile was rising his throat and his cheeks were damp with sweat or tears, he wasn’t even sure. The hallway started to tip horribly to one side and Draco swayed to keep his balance, inadvertently swinging his wand arm.
“Wait a moment,” Harry frowned, “there’s an otter too, and a Jack Russell…” he look quizzically at Draco. “Draco, have you ever mentioned to Hermione what your patronus is?”
“You look bloody good Draco,” Harry sighed wearily, slapping a hand against his face and letting out a pained groan. “And unfortunately it just makes what I had been planning to ask you now seem like it has some sort of ulterior motive.”
“If you are using that extra half hour to wash then I think the guests would insist upon it,” Hermione huffed but looked amused. “Anyway, Sirius has just cracked open some bottles of aged whisky he found in Grimmauld Place’s wine cellar so I daresay everyone will be nicely distracted if you need even longer.”
“Thanks Mione,” Harry beamed, blowing her an air kiss as he didn’t think the beta would appreciate him actually touching her right now.
“Actually, Ginny kind of already knows, so do Hermione and Ron,” Harry winced slightly as Draco gasped anxiously. “But trust me, they won’t tell
“Oh,” Draco glanced up at Harry who was smiling at him encouragingly. “I…” Draco reached inside his robes to pull out the duplicated photo of his mother. He hadn’t wanted to risk bringing the real thing all the way down to London. He walked over to the counter and proffered it carefully forwards. Olive peered down at the picture before her face lit up.
“I didn’t know that could happen!” Draco exclaimed urgently, making Harry jump as nothing else had been said for the past minute.
“Um,” Harry cleared his throat and fiddled with his glasses for a moment. “Fretterling Fevers are more like an echo of your actual heat,” he said, as if reciting from a text book, Draco could imagine that the alpha probably had done some reading on the matter. He was always telling Draco about odd facts he had learned from omega pregnancy manuals, like Draco should avoid liquorice due to an omega’s fluctuating potassium levels.
The wall tiles were contrastingly cool as Harry leaned his forehead against them, reaching down to squeeze the base of his uncooperative cock. He hissed as the touch brought momentary gratification.
Draco let out a small noise as Harry closed his hand into a fist before sticking out two thick fingers, allowing Draco to guide them into himself. Eventually the strain became too much and Draco collapsed back against the fluffy pillows, sweat dripping down his temple as Harry’s digits breached him.
“And that day you were offered a position at Hogwarts,” Remus breathed out softly, “where Harry Potter would spend eleven years of his life.”
“Careful,” Harry murmured softly as he propped Draco back up in the tub so as to stop him slipping under the water. The omega was undressed, apart from cotton grey briefs and a plain bralette. Harry gently laid a wet flannel on his forehead. Draco whimpered at the touch and as the cold drips of water rolled down his red cheeks.
Draco tried not to gasp as he felt Harry’s thumb begin to rub small circles into his neck as if apologising.
“I still don’t understand why I’m here,” Harry prompted, looking back to a now curious faced McGonagall.
The three of them filtered onto the lawns a few minutes later, walking down towards the Great Lake as quickly as Draco’s state would allow. Draco gasped as they crested over a small mound and saw what was waiting for them. The little grove under the trees had been decorated with balloons and an enchanted banner reading “Happy Eighteenth Draco!” was hovering above a food laden table.
“You w-were in the bathroom,” Draco spoke behind him, the scents of panic and embarrassment filtering through the air. “I thought I had time.”
“I suppose you must be very pleased with yourself,” Venetia announced as Draco attempted to hurry past her. “No wonder you always looked so smug.”
Harry took a gratifyingly long sip of his pint as Ron returned to their table with a family sized packet of crisps and a bottle of pear cider for Hermione. There was a fair crowd in the Hog’s Head that evening and Harry could see Ginny, Dean, Luna and several others coming in from the windy dark outside.
“I guess so,” Ron exhaled wearily, “but have you seen some of these project titles? This is some heavy theory.”
That was probably the wrong thing to say as Draco immediately looked anxiously down at Harry’s still swollen cock.
“Yeah, I guess,” Harry smiled sheepishly. “I was just wondering about all the times you’ve accused me of being closed off. How many instances have I shut someone down who was trying to get close to me, when maybe they just wanted to be friends?”
“Thanks Gin,” Harry replied miserably, tugging on a shirt and shoving his feet into some beat up trainers.
The noise of the bathroom door made Draco still, but he kept his hand where it was, the very tip of his index finger breaching his hole. Harry entered the room, silhouetted at first by the light of the bathroom, but after he turned it off, Draco could see that the alpha was naked.
“Draco,” Severus’ lips finally twitched into a smile as he caught sight of his godson, his face however turned to one of disgust as he regarded the large knitted jumpers that all the men were wearing. “I see pregnancy has driven you to join a cult.”
“Right,” Harry said before calling over the waiter and politely asking for the dishes to be taken away, assuring that he would still pay for them. Harry ordered himself a cappuccino and a slice of banana loaf before looking across to Draco.
Harry shook his head disbelievingly at her, pretty sure that Ginny knew exactly what Draco looked like by now.
Harry was torn from the mental image of a paper, pole dancing praying mantis by a tight squeeze on his arm. He blinked down in surprise to see that Damien was holding on to him.
“I am grateful for the spell’s existence,” Remus concluded, “it saved my adopted son and now it has given me a grandchild but it should end now Severus. You need to destroy the spell, lest it end up in innocent hands again, or worse, calculating hands.”
However, a quick sniff of the air reassured Harry that that was not the case. In fact, there was a strange sweet scent that he couldn’t place.
“Oh fuck, sweetheart,” Harry gasped as Draco moved to suck and nip down Harry’s throat, slender fingers scrabbling at the alpha’s shirt buttons.
“Alright, we’ll meet up with you by the start of the food huts in about an hour and a half?” Harry suggested as the others happily agreed and everybody began to disperse. “Let me know if you get tired or cold,” Harry told Draco as they began to meander down a fairy light lit avenue. The usual grass of the park was carpeted in charmed snow and more flakes were lazily drifting down from the sky.
“A little,” Draco blurted out accidentally before his eyes widened. Harry however, just let out a low laugh, reaching across the table to clasp Draco’s hands in his own.
“You want it harder?” Harry asked, he could feel his voice sounding harsh and rough, his alpha turning wild and possessive. “You want your husband to fuck you harder little one? Make you scream? Make you come so hard all over your naked little body?”
“No,” Draco replied quickly, looking worried. “You’re a good alpha. I’m sorry, I don’t think you’d ever do that.”
Harry gave a small smile before casting another charm to check Draco’s temperature levels. He wasn’t sure how much time passed after that but when Harry opened his eyes again he could feel Draco squirming in his arms.
Draco knew the older beta was probably referring to Draco’s stutter and lisp which were slightly more pronounced today than they usually were around his friends. “I’m okay,” Draco replied truthfully, “I think it’s left over stress from exams, I really wanted to do well.”
“Absolutely,” Harry nodded earnestly, “duelling isn’t about size or sex status. Half the time it’s not even about the strength of your magic. Duelling is speed, control, anticipating and applying knowledge.”
“So good sweetheart,” Harry murmured, caressing Draco’s lithe body before dipping his own face forwards and probing his tongue into Draco’s slicked hole. The omega tensed before shuddering, jerking his hips back in an effort to get his alpha deeper inside him. The blowjob became sloppier as Draco’s lips fell lax, the younger man letting out whining, huffing sounds.
“And sometimes I can’t believe I was actually brave enough to get on the back of that scoundrel’s motorbike. You should have seen him back then, all leather and cocksure grins. Thought he was invincible.”
“He hasn’t actually,” Draco frowned, “we said we would decide when the baby arrived, see what they suited.”
Harry caught the Ogden’s bottle with ease as Seamus laughed tipsily and sent another whizzing through the air towards Ron.
“N-No,” Draco shook his head firmly, wrapping him arms protectively around his stomach. “I haven’t seen my aunt in months.”
“Actually,” Harry swallowed, fidgeting with the sprig of flowers in his button hole. “This house, it’s um, it’s a wedding gift.”
For some reason, Hermione’s words settled uncomfortably in Harry’s gut. His alpha really didn’t like the sound of Draco being far away from him. They hadn’t even sorted out
Harry bit his lip, he knew that omegas liked to be praised by their alphas and it seemed that Draco was particularly affected by it.
In fact, Harry’s views on omegas seemed to be wildly different to the ones Draco had experienced growing up with the Lestranges. Any omega was going to be lucky if Harry became their alpha.
Plus, having the bond bite had finally made the more vocally critical students leave Draco alone, although Harry’s fierce displays of protectiveness had certainly done the trick as well.  Draco knew that most of his peers had believed Harry would never bother to bite him and were now desperately trying to figure out how Draco had achieved it.
“And you wonder why I gave you a P in Potions?” Snape drawled, clearly back to his old self as he regarded Harry with an expression of amused derision. “You realise you will have to pass a Potions proficiency test for your annual Auror license?”
“I think I c-can still fit into them,” Draco nodded. He had actually noticed an entire maternity section along the far wall but obviously hadn’t wanted to say anything to Olive at the time.
“Sorry, that’s something muggle builders do – figured I’d really try to get into the role,” Harry explained. Draco shot him a glare as Harry quickly hurried over to give the omega an apologetic kiss on the forehead.
Harry woke up the next morning to a moving weight on his lap. He groggily cracked open his eyes to see a flash of long red hair.
“It’s alright,” Harry spoke through the hanging fabric, “I’m sure you’ll get the hang of it – what exactly are you trying to do?”
Apparently, Harry had a muggle uncle and aunt in Surrey somewhere, although he had never actually met them.
“It’s beautiful,” Draco replied, closing his eyes and relishing the warmth of the friendly beta and the cold of the snowflakes on his cheeks.
“It feels good,” Harry said breathlessly, carding his own fingers across Draco’s scalp. “Do you think you could try to suck it?”
“Of course,” Harry replied, frowning. “Yeah, I mean I can’t have a kid running around out there that I don’t see. I’ve always wanted children, I just…wasn’t expecting
“Are you alright?” Harry asked in concern before gasping himself and looking down. Translucent milk was dribbling through the gaps in his fingers and running down the back of his hand. “Hey – it’s working!”
“I’m supposing you’ve enjoyed your wedding then,” Hermione remarked dryly, pinching her nose with one hand as Harry carefully extracted Lyra from her.
Harry smiled as he moved out of her way only to see two more students coming in, both with a hefty amount of mud on their faces. The boy was limping whilst the girl helped him along.
Draco whimpered, nodding erratically as his head tipped back, allowing Harry to eagerly mouth at the scar of their bond bite, tracing it with his tongue, tasting cinnamon and apples.
Harry nodded as the two of them began to stroll down the walkway, the odd town whizzing past them through the windows.
The two of them spent the next ten minutes decorating the rest of their globe, Harry brought in a raft of cheeky forest animals, squirrels pelting each other with chestnuts and robins that trilled to the tune of Jingle Bells. Draco crafted a large golden pair of bells, adorned with holly and red ribbons to hang magically above them. He couldn’t believe how wonderful it felt to be with Harry like this, the alpha was so kind and funny and Draco’s inner omega felt totally at peace, so unlike the first few weeks when he had been afraid to even be left alone in a room with the handsome but mysterious man.
“You stink,” Bella pulled a disgusted face, “how can I even think about choosing food when you’re oozing eau de brothel?”
Harry was lying on the hospital bed with Draco carefully tucked into his chest. Harry regretted that his first intimate contact with the younger boy was not whilst they were both awake as they had planned. However, this was necessary in order to calm Draco’s omega and try to mitigate any stress the baby might have endured.
Harry tilted Draco so he was cradled to the side in Harry’s arms, lying him down on the bed so Harry could enjoy the sight of his body in entirety. Draco breathed hard as Harry continued to massage his small prick, his large grey eyes staring at Harry’s face.
“Was,” Harry cleared his throat, not wanting to sound rude but also desperately wanting to just forget all about this and go crawl back into his bed, “was there anything else Professor?”
Harry paused, looking down the corridor towards the Morgana Suite, the lights were clearly lit inside as there was a faint orange glow underneath the door. Harry frowned and padded down the hallway to knock on the door.
“I w-was fifteen two years ago!” Draco gasped. Harry felt his stomach twist with revulsion. Arranged marriages weren’t unusual for omegas, especially within the older purebred families who maintained a traditionalist approach to omega ‘ownership’. However, the idea of a small, lonely Draco being shipped off to some grubby fingered fifty year old made Harry want to throw up.
“June fifth,” a dark and furious voice announced from behind Draco, causing Bella to fall silent and snap her gaze up. Draco squirmed as the pervasive alpha scent of bonfire and cinnamon saturated their area of the café.
“You’re not heading back to Patagonia?” Harry frowned, he could have sworn that was where his godfathers were currently travelling.
“What have you eaten this morning?” Harry asked, picking up his plate and moving to sit next to Draco as the table was now nearly fully vacated.
year.” Harry added, going slightly red in the face. “Look,” Harry rubbed the back of his neck, “are you absolutely sure the baby’s mine? Because I genuinely don’t know any Draco Malfoy and I certainly haven’t gotten anyone pregnant.”
“Yes,” Draco nodded, “where I would like to get married. Somewhere with a stone p-patio, the ones that have balustrades and gardens behind and…” he trailed off.
“Sweetheart, I –“ Harry gasped and Draco could start to feel the older man’s knot forming, a steadily swelling bulb at the base of his shaft. It caught on Draco’s rim, causing him to hiss from overstimulation and turn his head to the side.
“Where would you like to go first?” Harry asked Draco, handing him a beautifully illustrated map of all the event’s facilities and attractions.
“Thank you,” Draco replied, his fingers twitching against the smock’s fabric and bunching it slightly. “I think I s-suit blue.”
“Oi,” Sirius called from the kitchen, “can we come back now? Only I want to get on with the day and you know how ratty Remus gets when his parsnips are overcooked.”
“Good,” Draco smiled, pulling the covers up to his chin and snuggling down in the blankets. Harry always made sure to cast a warming charm on the bed now, which was another reason why he was forgoing a shirt. As an alpha he naturally ran much hotter than Draco did, but the omega ‘s comfort was the natural priority.
Draco always wore quite loose clothes on the upper half of his body, so as to better accommodate his bump. Harry’s mind was suddenly flooded with questions about whether Draco’s presumably previously flat chest had already started to swell?
Draco nodded tentatively, feeling himself slick further, the scent of his own sweetness mixed in with the comforting pool of the nest was causing his head to go fuzzy.
“Yes,” Snape replied, reaching into his robes and bringing out two small vials of colourless liquid. “One is a stabilisation elixir for omegas about to give birth, I found the recipe in an old manuscript but it’s been tried and tested many times.”
“Pregnant or not though,” Ron began through a spray of crumbs, “he’s still an unmated omega and the only one living in the annexe at that.”
In order to facilitate more cohesive unity between wizarding factions, Hogwarts had been one of the first European schools to start offering four year university level programmes once you had finished your now compulsory seventh year. Harry had been pleased to find that nearly all of his friends also decided to stay for the course. Furthermore, the diploma received at the end of it made it easier to gain higher level entry into the most desirable career paths.
Harry stared, open mouthed, as Draco appeared, his arm linked around a very haughty looking Snape. Draco was wearing the pale peach, silk dress from Olive’s along with the necklace that Harry had bought him for Christmas. The lustrous thin fabric clung elegantly to every dip and curve on Draco’s slender body, shimmering with his movements.
“No!” Harry coughed, feeling himself start to blush. “I mean, thank you, that’s good to know,” he added as Nadia raised her eyebrows. “I was actually wondering if you knew where I could buy some omega undergarments, the type specifically for pregnancy lactation.”
His luck was bound to run out sooner or later he supposed. Aunt Bella had already sent Draco several biting letters warning Draco not to come crying back to her when his alpha showed his ‘true colours’.
“Quite brazen of him to bring the omega here,” Muriel scoffed. “You’d think he would have sent the boy away somewhere.”
Harry stared at him in surprise, it wasn’t unheard of for omegas to get knocked up at school but it was pretty unusual. Most likely the omega had forgotten his birth control or perhaps he had just really wanted to become a parent.
The students laughed and a few more offered their congratulations before Harry was finally shooed away by Madam Pomfrey. He wandered back over to Draco’s cubicle and took a seat by the curtains.
“M-My what?” Draco stammered, his heart lurching in his chest as Harry’s eyes widened dramatically and he shuffled round to the front of Draco’s chair, peering between his legs.
“Right,” Harry muttered darkly, pocketing the vials and wholeheartedly reconsidering his stance on letting Snape remain in their lives.
“Plus if they find out that there’s a spell that could get them pregnant with my DNA…” Harry added as Ron’s face turned very pale.
Harry shifted and sure enough, his knot had finally gone down. Very carefully he rolled them back over so he could slip out of Draco’s very reddened and puffy hole. Harry stared in amazement as Draco took a sharp intake of breath, Harry’s own come gushed from Draco’s entrance, spreading across the bed.
Plus, Draco had thought selecting Hogsmeade as a rendezvous point might make his aunt less inclined to be as venomous as she could be in private.
“No,” Harry said firmly, “and we weren’t together when I found out about your pregnancy either so don’t start worrying. Honestly, she only came to see me this morning to chat about you and boast about her being scouted for the Harpies.”
“No, of course!” Harry exclaimed, giving Draco a reassuring smile before backing out through the curtains.
“I’m okay,” Draco replied, it was admittedly rather sweltering for early June and he was wearing pale dungarees over a striped pink, long sleeved T-shirt. “I’d like to change though, can we go back to the annexe first?”
“You are going to have a baby,” Severus stated, although not unkindly, “do you really think you would have time for this?”
Draco couldn’t understand why these women were all being so nice to him. He had thought that everybody in Gaedere House would see him as some sort of gold digging little slut.
Draco laughed as Harry picked up their empty mugs of herbal tea and went to place them over in the kitchen. “I’m telling you, Remus says he had to turn the hose on them all once.”
“You want Daddy to make love to you in our new bedroom? Fill you up with my thick cock, have you ride me right here on the floor?”
“Yes, Padma” Hermione replied sharply as if putting a stopper in that vein of conversation. Draco squirmed slightly, wondering if Harry’s friends resented him for putting the alpha in this situation? Hermione hadn’t shown him any ill will so far.
“Good day Mr. Potter,” Snape smiled again, it was actually becoming a little unnerving, as he turned to stalk out of the herb garden before pausing. “Oh and you may want to check your hair, I believe there are several cockchafers using it as a nest.”
“I’m sorry Harry, but really, where’s that come from?” Hermione snickered, “it’s not like you to have an existential crisis over cottage pie at half six in the afternoon.”
A lot of alphas might be annoyed their omega was paying so much attention to something like Potions work, wanting them to concentrate on more domestic affairs. But Draco didn’t think Harry would be like that, he imagined the alpha smiling down at him proudly, his green eyes twinkling.
After the Wizarding War, where Voldemort had been defeated by the Order of the Phoenix and the courageous sacrifice of James and Lily Potter, it had been decided that higher education should be more encouraged within the magical community. Of course, there had always been institutes and advanced schools that one could graduate to from Hogwarts, but the intake had consistently been rather small.
“What if I don’t want to hear the answer?” Ron frowned. “What if she’s grown out of me and wants to go find some ‘all American’ alpha?”
“I’m serious,” Harry grinned. “When our kid starts wanting galleons for the latest broomstick I’m going to be sending them your way, deal?”
you had a fight in you,” Smith announced, looking inordinately pleased. “I’ve watched you around school you know, for a few years now. You always have this ‘meek and mild’ shtick going on and whilst I guess that’s what pops Potter’s knot, I prefer ‘em a bit more feisty.”
“It’s not,” Harry stated firmly. The alpha reached out his hand and settled it across Draco’s hip bone. Draco could feel a hot flush blossom across his chest. Thankfully, his new nightshirt was high necked and went down to his ankles.
Harry huffed a laugh, “I think you’re forgetting that said seventeen year old is still pregnant with my child.”
Harry frowned as he crept closer, making sure to suppress his own scent to avoid detection. He could smell two strangers, one a beta and the other an alpha.
Harry moved over to the wardrobe, drawing out the fuzzy yellow piece of clothing gifted to Draco by Katie. Once he had passed it to the omega, Draco hurriedly pulled the garment on, wrapping it tightly around his torso.
Sometimes, in the silent darkness of the night, Draco imagined letting the alpha kiss him. Draco had never been kissed before so he didn’t have much reference for his musings apart from a battered romance novel he had stolen from his aunt’s library. Draco was pretty sure it had belonged to his omega mother anyway, as the initials N.B. were inscribed on the front page in curling script.
“Yeah,” Harry grinned as Hermione rolled her eyes and smiled back at him. “It’s been brilliant. Do you reckon the guests will mind if we don’t come down for another half hour or so?”
“Oh,” Draco murmured quietly, his eyes prickling with tears. His baby was always going to be safe, always going to be loved. Draco had been worrying so much for the last three months that his child would grow up like he had, without support. Apart from, of course, what Draco could give them and what Harry would kindly offer. Yet here were about twenty different people vowing to protect and care for his child.
“Oh thank fuck,” Harry groaned, collapsing down onto the floor with relief as Draco crawled into his lap and began peppering the older man’s face with kisses. “Are you sure sweetheart? You’re not just saying that?”
“Ungh,” Draco whined, looking a little like he was in pain. The omega’s fingers gripped tightly onto the edge of the bed. “Y-Yes, I think that’s doing something.”
“Of course little one,” Harry beamed, drawing Draco into a brief hug and whispering, “Happy Birthday love,” in his ear.
“Professor McGonagall reckons people are already going to make assumptions about Draco,” Harry replied awkwardly as Hermione made a noise of agreement. “If I go out there and tell them it was a spell he cast then that’s only going to make them think worse of him.”
“Okay,” Harry laughed, “I get the picture, why don’t you all take a seat and I’m sure you’ll be fixed up in a moment.”
Draco let out another stuttering moan as Harry changed his technique and ran deep groves up beside Draco’s spine. Draco’s breath was loud in the otherwise silent compartment and Harry clenched his teeth every time the omega wriggled in his lap from contentment.
Last night, for some godforsaken reason, Harry had done some reading on omegas, learning that for a male one, an abortion could be pretty intensive operation. Harry wondered how much school the blond boy would miss? If he would stay with his guardians to recover?
Draco had resigned himself to a lonely life and most probably a loveless marriage, but this baby represented something else. He wouldn’t have ever bothered Harry with it, hoping instead to somehow secretly steal away from school, maybe to their French relatives or something. He knew he would make a good parent, Draco often dreamed about having a sweet little baby in his arms, teaching them to read or buying their first cauldron.
“Well at least that’s one of the things I’ve heard people say about me over the years,” Harry shrugged, forcing a cheerful smile. “When I was sixteen a whole article was run in the Prophet about how my parents killed Voldemort but at the last moment he managed to stash his soul away in me so he couldn’t die.”
“Whilst it’s true and I think he’s a good influence on you,” Hermione paused, “you are romanticising slightly. Draco can be just as closed off as you can be – although with him it’s due to his fear and shyness. It’s only once he’s decided someone is safe that he becomes comfortable enough to talk to them.”
“H-Harry,” Draco whispered, his eyes shooting open in horror as he felt his underwear flood with a sudden rush of slick. Draco was frozen in mortification as the sticky substance dripped down the back of his thighs, soaking into the material of the dark maternity jeans he had bought from Olive’s.
After a minute, he carefully fingered the hem of his gown, slipping his hand underneath and gently cupping himself. Draco remembered how different Harry’s touch had been, warmer and rougher skin. He flushed as he recalled the way Harry had massaged his prick, making it stiff and aching. Draco pressed feather light touches to his balls, the scent of alpha was permeating throughout the nest, saturating all the sheets. Draco closed his eyes tightly as he moved a finger back further and found he was already wet and sticky.
“Dennis Creevey says he saw you in the Hospital Wing,” Damien continued, leaning forwards with his eyes scanning Draco critically as if expecting him to start glowing or something. “He heard Madam Pomfrey talking about your
“Just try?” Draco asked, his eyes pleading. Harry huffed, he was never going to be able to say no to anything this omega wanted. God forbid their child inherited Draco’s pout as well.
The evening weather seemed contentedly mild at first, however the barometers were all pointing decidedly to storms. Sure enough, at around eight pm, the faint pitter-patter of rain began to echo on the annexe’s slate roof. The wind picked up quickly afterwards, grabbing fistfuls of droplets and lobbing them against the window panes.
Draco was aware that his own late father Lucius had been rather bitter enemies with Harry’s parents. Everyone knew the Potters had died defending their five year old son from Voldemort, successfully taking down the Dark Lord once and for all. Besides, Draco had also heard from the grapevine that Harry was aiming for the aurors, surely public association with a pregnant omega of ill repute might jeopardise that?
Harry supportively wrapped a strong arm around Draco’s middle, feeling small, cold fingers immediately clutch at him.
It was so silly harbouring a crush on Harry Potter, Draco was sure that most of the school felt the same way. The other omegas certainly did, with Venetia Dawson proclaiming that her family were already in mating talks with the man in question.
“I’m sorry sweetheart. The truth is, I only decided I would quite like a proper ceremony today and when I heard what Bellatrix was saying I wanted to wipe that smug look off her face,” Harry replied, stroking his thumb across the back of Draco’s hand.
Harry went very red when Draco opened the present from him and gasped loudly. It was a glittering topaz necklace, almost identical to the one that Narcissa had been wearing in the photograph Draco had shown him.
Draco beamed at him, taking the plate as their fingers brushed. Harry wasn’t sure if the scent of caramelised apples was coming from the dessert or the omega but he liked to think it was the latter.
Draco sucked in a sharp intake of breath as more slick gushed out of him. Harry groaned as he felt the warm liquid coat the swollen head of his cock, running down his shaft and pooling in his dark thatch of hair.
On the first day at Padfoot’s, Harry had offered to sleep in the guest room but Draco had shyly told him that was unnecessary seeing as they had already shared a bed the night before coming down to London.
Draco’s hand pressed against his stomach a little tighter. Would that even be allowed? Away from the Lestranges and the Sourbolls of the world, would Draco actually be able to have both a baby and a job? Would it matter that much that he wasn’t mated?
know is always trying to look eighteen,” Harry grinned, trying to get Draco to relax. “The outfit looks great, honestly. Probably not warm enough for the current weather but by the time you’ll be able to fit into it again it will be summer right?”
“What do you mean is there a bu-“ Olive began when the mechanical bluebird started singing again. “Oh bother, another customer and Agatha’s gone for early lunch. Okay right, please excuse me boys, oh and Draco,” Olive turned back from where she had been about to descend the stairs. “Try on the blouse combo first, it’s sure to be a knockout.”
“Shit, shit,” Harry swore, he could now also see that Draco had managed to kick down his grey underpants so they were floating in a bedraggled heap on the water’s surface.
“Not sure,” Harry shrugged, “I was thinking of finding somewhere big enough so Draco and the baby could live with me for a while.”
“So underwear was too visible but you still managed to conceal your wand?” Harry asked, raising a thick eyebrow as Draco flushed and bit his lip on a smile. The omega twirled his wrist and Draco’s patronus appeared. An elegant white peacock who seemed to eye Harry rather disdainfully before strutting through the still closed doorway with Draco’s request to ask Katie to bring up spare clothes and leave them outside the room.
“Does he now?” Severus enquired, looking amused again. “Are we to see a complete reversal of societal norms then? Is Potter going to be staying at home eating grapes whilst packing you off to the workhouse?”
Draco ducked back in, eventually fitting more of the shaft in his mouth but quickly choking when he attempted more. Harry gently showed the younger boy how to use his hands as well, suckling beautifully on the tip whilst cool fingers slid up and down Harry’s pulsing shaft.
“No, you’re alright,” Harry replied, plastering on a tight smile that he was pretty sure came across as pained. The girl shrugged before turning to a very eager looking Dean instead. A few minutes later, they were up and heading into the dancing throngs with swaying hips.
“You don’t have to write it if you don’t want to,” Draco huffed, he knew he was acting petulantly and that had never been a good tactic when persuading his godfather of something. But all of Draco’s dreams seemed balanced on a knife’s age and he was terrified of them slipping away.
“It’s a snow globe creator,” she grinned. “Right now it’s blank, but if you go inside you can start designing your own snow globe. When you’re done you can come on out and get a handheld version that’s an exact replica.”
Draco’s breath wavered as he slid his eyes back to Harry, keeping his head angled. Draco opened his mouth before closing it again as if he wasn’t sure what to say.
“I guess, yes,” Draco looked back up at the bed. “I just…it’s not pretty like theirs were.” Draco blushed when he realised that it was embarrassment he was feeling. He just knew if he had attempted to build something like this in the Slytherin dorm he would have been laughed at. Everyone had thought him so uppity they would have probably found his attempt with the columns pretentious, and the fact he couldn’t even get it to work anyway just undermined the whole endeavour.
Draco swallowed thickly, averting his eyes from Harry’s and instead staring at the wiry chest hair that was poking out from the top of the older man’s pyjama shirt.
Over the last few months, Harry had managed to arrange for landscapers to come in and charm the hedges and flowerbeds into full glory. There was even a sizeable pond with a fountain and ducks. Different coloured lilies floated in the water whilst brightly dappled koi fish meandered lazily in the depths, hiding from the August sun under emerald clouds of pondweed.
“I notice you haven’t made a nest yet?” Harry asked, moving over to look at the still very normal looking bed.
“How’s he doing?” Olive asked, coming to sit beside Harry on the sofa and summoning two more mugs of tea.
Draco shuddered, imagining Bella attempting to cuddle with him. Thank Merlin his aunt had such an aversion to touch, Draco didn’t think he had even seen her scent Rodolphus over the years. As for Severus, they just didn’t have that kind of physically close relationship and Draco knew he would probably perish from embarrassment if his godfather ever tried to change that.
Draco had a horrible vision of Harry Potter and Venetia curled up together somewhere in the Alps with mugs of hot cocoa and a fuzzy blanket over the two of them. He sighed despondently, giving his peas a final push for good measure before vanishing his plate and leaving the Great Hall.
Harry smiled contentedly as Draco pulled open his loose hospital gown to reveal a swollen breast with pink nipple. Draco carefully guided Lyra towards the bud before she latched on and happily began to suckle. Draco let out his own sigh of satisfaction, leaning against Harry and pressing a kiss to the alpha’s shoulder.
“Daddy’s got you,” Harry told him as Draco’s fingers scrabbled on the blankets, his hips were being lifted up with the thrusts. Draco’s own turgid prick slapped wetly against the underside of his belly. Draco looked down between his arms, his bump concealing most of what was happening from view but his breasts were bouncing wildly up and down as Harry fucked into him.
Draco squinted to see that the tall alpha was sticking his head in between the pine filled branches.
“Don’t worry about it,” Harry reached out to squeeze Draco’s knee over the blankets, “I honestly was thinking of coming back early anyway. I wasn’t enjoying myself too much.”
“But if you want it prettier then let me help,” Harry stood up decisively and reached for his wand. “We can use magic right?”
“Y-You smell like marzipan,” Draco’s fair eyebrows knitted together and his nose wrinkled up unhappily.
“Let me,” Harry said, grabbing Draco’s wrists in a single hand and noticing the way the omega’s pupils dilated. Harry kept his grip tight whilst undoing his fly with his other hand, opening it up and pushing down his underwear only enough to pull out his thick cock.
“I can’t wait to see them,” Draco sighed, leaning up to kiss Harry’s chin before turning his attention back to Lyra who was giggling at a maniacal looking fairy hovering outside the window.
“You know I had to write an essay on love potion unions last year,” a strawberry blonde girl announced to anyone who was listening, “and apparently any offspring born from them will come out wrong.”
A few minutes later, after managing to collect himself and having used up a fair few sheets of toilet roll as tissues, Draco walked back out to find Harry leaning against the wall, waiting for him. The alpha’s eyes were closed and he had a contented look on his face. Upon hearing Draco, Harry’s green eyes cracked open and he gave the omega a soft smile.
Then of course there had been the incident with Zacharias Smith. It made Harry’s blood boil to even think of it, to remember how the slimy alpha had deigned to lay his hands on Draco. Harry had been certain that Draco would want to go home straight afterwards, that the omega would be horribly shaken by what had happened. Certainly Draco’s scent when he had fallen through the clearing had been a particularly acidic assault on Harry’s nose. However the omega had quickly calmed in Harry’s presence, his heartbeat steadying and his limbs stopping their shaking by the time Harry had picked him up and held him close.
Draco stared at his alpha in surprise, he hadn’t realised they were going to have a proper wedding ceremony as well as a mating. Bellatrix looked between the two of them for a moment before letting out an angry hiss, flying to her feet and storming out of the café.
Professor McGonagall had informed Harry that the Healer from St. Mungo’s would be arriving on Monday to perform the procedure. Information that, quite frankly, Harry could have done without as he had huffed and sent her indignant owl back without a treat.
“Sure, yes, fine, whatever you say,” Seamus replied, clearly desperate not to earn Ginny’s infamous ire.
Currently, Draco was sitting on the big squidgy armchair in the Morgana Suite with his feet tucked underneath him. Harry, Hermione and Ron were spread out across the other pieces of furniture comparing lecture notes.
“Did you dance?” Draco asked, he had never been to a club and had no idea what sort of things happened there.
“Never say no to chocolate,” Harry grinned before giving Draco a quick squeeze. “Do you want anything?”
“I’ve ruined your makeup,” Harry frowned, knowing that was probably the least of his worries right now, “Wait….you love it?”
“Don’t know where he is,” Ginny shrugged, “wasn’t in bed when I came in. Probably trying to smooth things over with Hermione.”
a Magical Metallurgy course offered by Hogwarts. Before Draco had come along, Harry supposed he had perhaps been rather insular with the people he actually interacted with and cared about.
Harry groaned as he turned, still topless and with Ginny in his bed to see Seamus awkwardly standing next to a very shocked looking Draco.
Not for the first time, Harry’s teeth had itched with the desire to sink themselves into Draco’s shoulder, marking him as bonded. Harry felt pangs of possessiveness every time he so much as looked at Draco now. His inner alpha couldn’t understand the problem, the omega was already swollen with Harry’s child, why not go the extra step and claim him?
“Yours, Alpha,” Draco breathed back before letting out a small squeak as Harry reached up to spread the younger boy’s cheeks apart, revealing a light halo of golden hair around his dark pink hole. As Harry drew closer, another thick globule of slick was released, dripping messily down to the sheets.
After going to the toilet and washing his hands, Harry emerged back into the body of the train only to come face to face with a very attractive omega boy. The boy looked like he might be in Sixth or Seventh Year, with curly dark hair and doe-like blue eyes.
Harry waited but no more explanation seemed to be forthcoming. “Um, Draco, I kind of need to know what it is in order to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’,” Harry grinned, crouching down on the floor beside the omega and trying to make himself seem as least intimidating as possible.
“A-Alpha!” Draco cried, his face a wet and blotchy mess as he desperately tried to continue stroking Harry’s cock, his small hands slipping and jerking erratically. Harry growled as Draco stopped moving, right on the edge of Harry’s own orgasm. However, he couldn’t begrudge the younger boy as a second later, Draco screamed hoarsely, slamming himself back onto Harry’s fingers as he came for the second time across the bed sheets.
I do then you are sorely mistaken. I would blame it on the fact that you are still a teenager but then again, I’ve never seen Draco act like this.”
Harry just about stopped himself from pulling a face as he recognised Professor Severus Snape. Advanced Potions was unfortunately a compulsory part of Harry’s mixed arts diploma course. Snape looked, characteristically, like he had swallowed a lemon. Harry wondered what he was meant to have done wrong now? Snape was always trying to pin shit on Harry, despite it normally being Seamus and Dean who were the perpetrators.
“My older sister’s just had her first baby,” the boy announced proudly, “Can you believe I’m an uncle already? Mandy just says that means I get to spoil ‘em rotten and buy them all sorts of things I shouldn’t.”
“Four weeks,” Draco replied, his other hand going to his stomach again as the betas all exchanged knowing smiles.
“Fuck,” Harry grunted, realizing that his imaginary Draco was also still pregnant. A beautiful belly carrying Harry’s seed, ripening with the two of them. It looked so good to Harry’s alpha, the bigger Draco got, the more proof that Harry had filled him properly, bred him just right. Dream Draco was swollen and whimpering, waves of honeyed slick rolling down quivering thighs and pooling at their feet.
Draco tugged at several folded blankets, causing the tower of bedding to collapse around him. He tutted and started picking it all up, brushing off any dust from the floor before piling everything onto the bed. Next, he found himself dragging down Harry’s shirts from their hangers, even rummaging through the older man’s underwear drawer for a handful of clean, folded boxers and briefs.
“Be winter before you know it,” Ron yawned, heaving himself out of bed and gingerly changing into clothes for the day.
“Oh no,” Remus shook his head theatrically “I’m not sure where that goes, maybe on the outside of the appara-“
“I’m not complaining!” Ron’s loud voice came from somewhere down the other end of the ward. Harry grinned and rolled his eyes at Draco. “I was just asking how long it takes to have a baby!”
“The guests right?” Harry nodded sagely as if he was thinking it over. “Perhaps you’re right, maybe we could get the guests to sit on the bikes instead of chairs?”
Harry walked down the gangway towards the toilet, the train was leaning a little from side to side and one of the top windows had fallen open, allowing in a bracing draught until Harry quickly shut it. It was quite far down from their compartment but he had gotten in the habit recently of worrying about Draco getting cold.
The intensity of Draco’s distress at the Winter Wonderland, however, had snapped Harry back to his senses. He had promised Draco he would never take advantage of him and Harry had wrestled his salivating inner alpha back into submission. It didn’t help that Draco had then trusted Harry to carry round the bag containing his soiled clothes for the rest of the day.
Hermione was standing on the other side, with Lyra gurgling contentedly in her arms. Katie was already disappearing down the stairs, having brought up the bag of clothes. She let out a peal of laughter, however, as she glanced back and saw the state Harry’s suit was in. Harry cringed slightly but figured he could probably put up with the inevitable teasing later.
“These were m-my mother’s,” Draco explained excitedly, sitting cross legged on the arm of the sofa next to Harry. Harry quickly averted his eyes as Draco pulled his night gown down over his knees, concealing the flash of pale thigh that had previously been visible.
“Well I think he wanted to go,” Hermione snapped, clearly irritated at only herself, “and he had it in his head that you might take him as a reward or celebration or something.”
The furniture was dark wood and quite a few pieces were South Asian in style with intricate lattice work. Above them, hung industrial light bulbs framed in strange angular wire shades that doubled as contemporary art.
“Then again,” Remus laughed, stirring his wine with a cinnamon bark stick, “I was always uncharacteristically brave whenever I was with your dad or Sirius. Something about their courage was so infectious, as if we could take on the entire world so long as we knew we were in the right.”
“Quite,” Remus smiled. The other man seemed to give up on the socks, casting a charm instead to send them flying into various drawers where they would at least be out of sight. “You know, being a werewolf allows me access to a layer of scents and physical cues that would elude most alphas.”
“You’re choosing studying with a seventeen year old over a night of clubbing and alcoholic debauchery?” Ron looked completely confused. “Mate, I know for certain that both Gabby Baldan and Colum Tidewell had the hots for you and they’re both going to be there, single and imbibing copious amounts of Tequila.”
“I-“ Draco began before looking down at his soup. Right now he didn’t think he could stomach a single thing.
Harry clenched his teeth, moving to take a step forward when he realised that Remus was looking at him. Of course the werewolf had still been able to scent that he was there. Remus held out his hand so as to tell Harry to stay. Snape was still sitting on the bench with his back to Harry, but his shoulders were a tense and shaking line.
“I’m going to cast some cleaning charms on you darling, will you let me?” Harry knew Draco had been nervous about wands pointed at him since the corridor incident.
“That was the day your father graduated,” Remus told Draco, “it was also the day he proposed to Narcissa.”
“Yeah I know,” Harry smiled, “It’s just I’d like to find something nice to wear for the Weasley’s Boxing Day party, so I need to go out anyway. I figured maybe you don’t get much of a chance to?” Harry couldn’t exactly imagine Snape accompanying Draco out for London shopping trips. “There’s some really nice boutiques on Dogrose Lane, it’s just off of Diagon Alley, I think I’ve seen some of this type of stuff in their windows.”
The cylindrical bolster cushions he used to create columns, from which Draco draped sheets and shirts. To avoid collapse, he wound more blankets around the base. It took a great deal of effort but when Draco stepped back to observe his first nesting attempt he found himself frowning. For some reason it looked rudimentary and amateurish. Draco was sure it was silly to think that there was a superior art of nesting but he was getting slightly teary and frustrated as the whole endeavour was starting to highlight his long held insecurities over being a sub-par omega.
“H-Harry?” Draco called out nervously, sure that the alpha must right on the other side. However, there was no answer as Draco looked anxiously around the grove. The way they had come from was also gone now and there was only one path leading out. Draco glanced back at where he had last seen Harry before quickly hurrying down it.
He looked down to his arms when his daughter let out a spit bubbled gurgle. A small hand reached from beneath the swaddling cloth and closed around Harry’s index finger.
Draco whimpered, closing his eyes tightly as a gush of warm slick pulsed stickily from his hole, saturating Harry’s lap. “You’ll always remember this,” Harry promised, nipping at Draco’s lobe, “whenever you walk past this spot, you’ll know it was where you let your alpha knot you so naughtily, with all those people just downstairs.”
“Bother!” Draco exclaimed suddenly.  Harry glanced round to see the younger boy staring petulantly down at some carved pieces of wood and odd metal pins in his hands.  Draco looked so put out that Harry half wanted to laugh but he didn’t think the omega would appreciate that.
“How about we get them all?” Harry smiled indulgently, “We can always wrap up what you don’t eat now and save it for later.”
“Love, yes,” Severus spoke, his voice was soft and almost wistful, “what a terribly powerful thing.” He glanced over at Draco, “and it can lead to such miracles.”
“Don’t s-send me away,” Draco said, looking up at Harry with pleading eyes. “Please. I know I said I d-didn’t want anything but please don’t send me away.”
“Ah,” Harry laughed in understanding as large plates of apple and cherry pastries appeared along with jugs of thick custard.
“Yeah,” Harry nodded awkwardly, wondering if it would be rude to bring his hand up to his nose to try and block it out?
Draco found himself spreading his legs further, pulling his own knees apart as far as they could comfortably go. He wondered if he would remember this with shame, acting so wantonly? Somehow he doubted it, Draco was safe with his alpha and he knew Harry was enjoying the display of desire and arousal.
“Draco’s godfather,” Harry announced, “he normally spends Christmas with Draco but of course this year…”
“Everything’s fine sweetheart,” Harry said firmly, making sure that Draco heard and understood him. “The baby is okay, it’s just you are going to feel a little rotten until we can get this fever down.”
Draco held his breath as a family of tourists came barrelling towards him with their noses in a large map. A moment later, however, he found himself gently but firmly steered out of their way by Harry. Draco felt his inner omega going embarrassingly giddy as Harry held his arm protectively around Draco’s shoulders and manoeuvred them both through the morning shoppers.
Draco jumped as an owl knocked on his window. He hurried over to make sure it hadn’t disturbed his nesting robin before passing it a bit of broken off rice cracker. Draco detached the rolled up scroll from its leg before closing the window again and shivering. It was bitingly cold out and Draco was now only in his thin undershirt.
“Hello Lyra,” Harry smiled, starting as a splash of moisture dropped down onto his baby’s face. He realised a moment later that it had come from him, as another teardrop rolled down his nose. Harry chuckled tiredly at himself, removing his glasses and wiping at his eyes as Lyra made another gurgling noise. “Your poor papa is having a little rest,” Harry told his daughter, “you took your time coming out you know?”
Draco closed his eyes and wished for the health and happiness of his baby, before he shuffled closer and blew as hard as he could. There was a jubilant cheer as Draco blinked to see he had managed to extinguish all of the candles at once. The dragons were now settling down onto the icing and retiring their charm.
“What do you reckon?” Harry asked, leaning down to nudge his nose against Draco’s temple. Draco closed his eyes briefly as he savoured the touch.
Olive laughed and gestured for Harry to join her back on the sofa. “No, you’re right. Normally the omega would be the one to always get pregnant. But I was a difficult birth and Dad refused to go through that again, said that if Mum wanted another kid she could damn well do it herself.”
Harry grimaced as one of Angelina’s beta friends sidled closer to him on the couch, her lips tinted blue and sticky from Sambuca.
“Oh bugger,” Harry said, casting a quick tempus. “Yeah, I’ve got to dash, but before I go, which of these vials is feverfew?” Harry asked, holding up the tubes for Snape to inspect.
“You alright?” Harry asked. “Madam Pomfrey says we should avoid apparition during the third trimester but I read that we’re okay for now.”
Hogwarts champions. One from Seventh Year in the form of Cedric Diggory and the then Sixth Year Harry Potter.
“How is your pregnancy going Draco?” Remus asked kindly picking up a mug that smelled like camomile.
“Yeah, that might be an idea,” Harry nodded before wincing. “I um, I think Remus might be expecting us to go home next week as well actually.”
“Mm,” Draco snuffled before falling quiet. Harry listened to the rise and fall of the younger boy’s body for some time before he too succumbed to sleep.
“I wouldn’t be so sure,” Harry muttered, reaching out to ruffle Draco’s hair, “Katie was onto something -  you do look pretty adorable in that outfit.”
“I know,” Harry bit out, it wasn’t like his friends were saying anything he wasn’t already painfully aware of. He looked at Hermione, “I just couldn’t do it. He wants the baby and if I don’t allow it then I’m the one forcing him to get an abortion. Don’t you think it’s fucked up he can’t control his own body?”
“Venetia Dawson’s been smelling awfully sweet when you’re around,” Seamus grinned with his teeth on display.
Suddenly the door blasted open and Draco let out a small cry of surprise, jerking his head round. Harry was standing in the doorway, absolutely drenched and with a good deal of mud caked to his trousers and even his sleeves.
“I love you too,” Draco replied, mewling at the loss of Harry’s fingers as the alpha repositioned them.
Draco grunted with effort as he reached down, Harry quickly grabbing a pillow to slide under the younger boy to stop him falling back or pitching to the side. Draco wrapped both of his hands around a hairy, dark forearm before tugging the hand back towards his entrance.
“Harry,” Hermione began as a tentative whisper. “I understand you had nothing to do with the spell and that this Draco Malfoy made an honest mistake. But
Healer Sweetbridge had been coordinating with Draco’s godfather regarding the birth and a special area of the Hospital Wing had been set up as per her instructions. Harry knew that when the time came, at least Draco would be in good hands.
“Is he pretty?” Ron asked, earning him another daggered glare from Hermione. Sometimes Harry couldn’t help but think that Ron really did make things more difficult for himself on purpose.
Harry let out a bubble of laughter, “that’s alright, I’m sure they’ll harden up again once we’re off the train.”
“There’s your baby,” she announced happily as she ran her wand over Draco’s exposed stomach, his baggy cashmere sweater rolled up to just below his bralette.
Harry swore above him but didn’t sound angry as Draco moaned, his eyes lolling about in his head. Draco mewled anxiously as Harry pulled out of him, leaving him empty. The orgasm was nowhere near enough, Draco’s body was expecting a knot, to be tied together with his alpha.
“No,” Draco shook his head but looked pleased, “I was worried I wouldn’t…” he trailed off with a blush. “That I fainted t-too early and wouldn’t get to…”
Draco had been guiltily relieved when Ginny had announced she wouldn’t be returning for the rest of the diploma course at Hogwarts. Having signed with the Harpies, she apparently didn’t want to wait too long to make her start in professional quidditch.
“Yeah, it’s me, I’m here little one,” Harry murmured, pressing a small, chaste kiss to the back of Draco’s scalp. He could taste salt on his lips from the omega’s sweat. “I’ve got you.”
The trouble was, he now was in the devastating position of knowing what Draco’s slick smelled like. When Harry had first caught a whiff of that aroma, his mouth had literally watered and he didn’t think his dick had ever been that hard in his life. Poor Draco had been so flustered by the whole affair that at least he hadn’t seemed to notice that Harry had been sporting a considerable stiffy in his jeans. Even just the memory now of that sweet honeydew was enough to get Harry’s shaft thickening with blood and his balls feeling heavy and tight.
“Ah – sweetheart, careful with your teeth,” Harry hissed, quickly squeezing the back of Draco’s neck as the other boy blanched and jerked back.
“I can’t believe you’ve convinced McGonagall to let a seventeen year old pregnant omega come live in Gaedere House,” Ron shook his head as he passed Hermione her drink and cracked open his own bottle of mead.
want in here?” Harry asked, removing his arm from Draco and walking around the globe, inspecting it.
“You look like an angel,” Harry blurted out, wincing as Sirius sniggered before Remus batted him across the head.
“Oh god not a beta,” Damien replied quickly, pulling a face. Harry thought that kind of reaction was a bit harsh but he guessed everybody had preferences. “No, I want an alpha who will properly court me for bonding,” Damien explained. “Someone devastatingly handsome and of the right standing who understands what a catch I am,”
“A-Alpha!” Draco cried as his spine bowed and trembled, little spurts of white droplets splattering from his pink cock across the bottom of his bump.
“Y-Yes thank you,” Draco replied, nervously eyeing the crowds. Bellatrix had never been much of an advocate for Draco getting to go out on day trips and Rodolphus certainly hadn’t offered to chaperone him. Severus had brought Draco to an Edinburgh apothecary once or twice to stock up on potions ingredients but somehow Draco’s aunt had gotten wind of it and that was the last of those excursions.
“I would never tell Draco who he could or couldn’t spend time with,” Harry replied frustratedly. “You’re his godfather and he loves you.”
“I had supposed after hearing what I just told Lupin, that you might prefer me not to be in your future husband’s life,” Snape stated. His voice was grim and resigned rather than challenging, as if Snape had already accepted Harry’s decision.
Over the following weeks, Draco’s interest in the dark, carefree alpha had morphed into a fully blown crush. At night, Draco would imagine what the man’s arms would feel like wrapped around him, Draco’s omega sated and reassured. He would imagine taking Harry’s hand and excitedly showing him the new potions Draco was working on from Uncle Sev’s journal. He wondered if Harry would be impressed?
Without consciously being aware of it, Harry had risen to his feet and crossed over to stand next to Draco, looking down at the omega. Harry could remember students from his year at Hogwarts wearing dresses similar to this at events like the Yule Ball, but none of them had ever looked quite this alluring.
Draco’s eyes darkened and widened, his spit shined lips dropping open. Harry could feel his arousal and desire through the bond, the air throbbing with his needy scent.
“You want to be bonded sooner?” Harry finished, looking at Draco in understanding. Draco nodded, pulling his hands away from Harry’s and fidgeting with the hem of his sweater.
Of course, working out knots on a lower back was several thousand miles removed from offering to rub Draco’s newly swollen breasts, Harry knew that. He glanced back over to Madam Pomfrey, three more bedraggled looking students had seemingly appeared, along with a First Year who couldn’t stop sneezing raisins.
“Sorry,” Harry muttered miserably, staring down at the book on object curse removal that was sat open in his lap. He must have read the same page on curse dipped ink used in manuscript illumination about ten times by now.
He guessed the alpha probably wouldn’t necessarily appreciate that comparison given Draco was still at school.
“They didn’t work for me either,” Damien continued. “Say, Harry, would you walk with me for a bit? It gets awfully boring otherwise and all my friends are back in the compartment playing cards.”
Harry frowned and suppressed his scent as he drew closer. He knew Remus had been aware that Draco’s pregnancy had not been a natural one, but he hadn’t known that Remus had already figured out about Snape’s spell.
Harry stared at the blinking lights of the kebab shop opposite when suddenly a blue wisp of light streaked down the alleyway. A moment later, an otter materialised in front of him, speaking in Hermione’s worried voice.
Draco remembered the Triwizard Tournament. He had been a Third Year at the time and there had been a bit of a kafuffle when the cup had selected
“Harry, there you are,” a tall red-headed man Draco now recognised as Ron Weasley sauntered up to the table before fixing his eyes on Draco. Ron was quickly followed by a couple of other Gaedere students, two of them Draco could smell were alphas.
Draco was wearing pyjamas, they were the set that Harry had found in his own maze present and decided to transfigure so as to fit the omega. Harry hadn’t really liked the idea of Draco walking around the house in one of his usual nightgowns. The trousers and shirt were made of a tartan patterned flannel in chequered squares of dark blue and wine red. Much to Harry’s pleasure, they also looked nice and warm. Although the heating charms at Padfoot’s seemed to be a lot more effective than those in the Gaedere annexe.
“I understand,” Harry smiled, feeling a surge of affection and happiness. He leaned in to kiss Draco on his reddened lips. “We’re together now, always.” Harry glanced down at Draco’s bump, stroking circles over the top of it, “Our family.”
“It’s okay,” Draco replied, nuzzling his face into Harry’s neck and hoping the alpha would temporarily forgive his shamelessness. “The trees brought me back to you.”
“Stop blubbering,” Harry snapped, “I’m sure it will change back in a few hours. Until then, just avoid the penguin feeding area.”
“I think he was waiting for the weekend,” Hermione cleared her throat. “You know they’ve got the Winter Wonderland festival on in Hogsmeade.”
“Are you okay?” Draco asked, attempting to lever himself down from the sill and cross over to the older man.
“I need to get back,” Harry explained, “I don’t know if you’re aware but I’m responsible for an omega at the moment.”
Draco tried not to pull a face as she carefully dabbed the gloop onto his reddened thighs, they were stinging a bit more now but at least the ointment would help.
“Please don’t be,” Harry frowned anxiously, stepping forwards. “I shouldn’t have been so long in the shower,” he added guiltily. Poor Draco had probably been awake and waiting to use the bathroom for ages before giving up and attempting to change in the bedroom.
“Wait,” Harry said quickly, jerking back to Draco and quickly tying the front of his hospital gown together and concealing his previously exposed breasts. Draco smiled shyly at him whilst raising a blond eyebrow.
“It’s not your fault,” Harry frowned.  Olive will have told him there was an omega changing up here. He shouldn’t have come up the stairs in the first place.”
The street was relatively crowded, which wasn’t all that surprising given that it was the weekend. Quite a few heads turned their way once Harry’s recognizable scar was spotted. People were probably also looking as Harry was so clearly a powerful alpha, his scent and stature giving him away. Harry, however, completely ignored everyone as he shot Draco a small, private smile.
