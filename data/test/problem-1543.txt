“The archivist is terrifying.”
Harry awoke with a splitting hangover and, groaning, groped around for his glasses. So tired was he that it took several moments to realize that he was groping something quite other than eyewear.
Harry returned to his apartment, sitting down in his creaky armchair and opening the envelope. There was a single sheet of paper inside, written on in impeccable calligraphy. Harry scoffed, then read:
“Mmm,” Hermione muttered, and Harry could
“It’s bad,” she said.
“Oh,” said Draco, feeling as though he had been punched.
“I don’t follow, Draco,” said Blaise. “Wouldn’t their outsider status make them all the easier to, er, persuade?”
“What’s wrong, Harry?"
“Yes,” said Hermione acidly, “and your presence has always had such a calming effect on their dynamic.”
“That’s probably a great question,” said Amy, “but I didn’t understand a word of it.”
Welcome back! The Plot seems to be here to stay, but don't worry; I have determined not to allow it to take over the story of our boys' interpersonal ineptitude, which, after all, is the true star of this show.
“I thought you had work?’ Tom said to Harry.
“There you are, you great pillock,” said Ginny. Harry groaned again, remembering suddenly and with a stab of pain that Ginny was a
Harry grasped Draco’s hand and knocked. Mrs. Weasley answered.
“Where are we?” Amy demanded.
“What are you going to
Hermione rolled her eyes but didn’t respond. Ron joined them, sliding his plate onto the table and not even pausing to greet them before stuffing his croque monsieur into his mouth.
“I don’t understand,” said Harry. He wanted to say more, but was at a loss.
“Thanks,” said Harry, numb.
Albus rolled his eyes. “We

was.”
For a moment, Draco stilled. Then he reached up and began to stroke Harry’s hair. They were silent for a while.
Draco you’re being rEALLY WEIRD
“To engineer your painless death, of course,” said Pansy. “Your situation is quite hopeless.”
Harry gratefully slumped into a chair. It had been a draining morning, but even a rushed half-hour of lunch with Ron and Hermione could cheer him up immensely. And hopefully dispel the dark cloud of Tom hanging over his head, and get last night’s strange conversation with Draco off his mind.
“Sorry?”
I,” said Hermione. “I sound like your mum? And who was it who waited up for me when I worked late Tuesday, said he was worried sick, then proceeded to serve me
“Won’t it cause problems?” Harry suggested. “You know--with money? I know that matters to you.”
“My cat,” Amy explained shortly.
“No, oh, no, My Lord, I had just—I had merely—wondered about his
“You’re delusional.”
“There we go, pet. You like that? Like having my mark on you?” Harry nodded, and Draco nipped at his neck sharply. “Answer me, love.”
help. He got up and took the coffee to the sink to dump it, smelling the caffeine and chocolate and spice and wishing he could drink it.
“Your boyfriend,” said Albus, slowly and clearly for the hard of hearing, “is the father. Of your son’s boyfriend.”
“All right.” Draco wrapped an arm around Harry’s waist, gripping tightly. “I want to mark my territory in front of the Weasley matron and her brood.”
“All right,” said Draco. And, full of resolve, he turned on his heel and walked away.
If I said "slow burn" at any point in any previous a/n, y'all can feel free to laugh at me.  I'm not patient.  Here's hoping you aren't either, lovelies!
Draco eyed Lump speculatively.
Scorpius tried to say, “yes we can,” but it came out as a sort of squeaking sound.
“Forgive me if I struggle to see a year’s free rent as a bad thing.”
“Get out of my flat, you monstrous tart,” said Draco.
Ron tried to follow his wife’s directions, squinting and staring at Harry and Draco as if trying to see through them. But before he noticed, Ginny gasped.
anybody. I belong to myself, and I will take care of myself. I won’t be under anyone’s power ever again. I swore that to...stop looking at me like that.”
Draco nodded solemnly. “Your dad, James Potter, came from a Pureblood family like mine--well, all right, not like mine, but old and wealthy nonetheless. Your mum was Muggleborn, as I suppose you might have guessed. Those troglodytes were relatives of hers, were they not?”
“They accept
Harry had been in the sitting room for hours when Draco finally stepped out of the fireplace, holding the Crup in his arms. Harry had a firewhisky, which he’d barely sipped, and a magazine, which he’d not even opened. When Draco came, he set them both aside without a thought.
Harry stalled out for a moment. He should probably go. He had work in the morning, and he didn't really know why he was here in the first place. Well, yes he did. He hadn’t felt safe alone. He could have called Hermione perhaps, but she would have taken forever to get there and would Draco have stayed and would Tom have snuck back in and would Harry have had a panic attack in front of Draco’s posh barman? Couldn’t be done. Nor could walking home alone. So he was here.
“This is what it’s come to, then, is it, boy? Whoring yourself out to rich ponces? I told you he’d come to no good, didn’t I, Petunia?”
Harry watched as Amy inched toward the drawer where she kept her pepper spray. But at that moment, Draco muttered some mumbo jumbo and a bunch of birds popped into existence out of thin air. Both stared in shock for a good thirty seconds before Amy pursed her lips.
,” he told it clearly, and the flame reappeared.
“Hi,” said Harry. “Er--Davis, is it?”
“Just around the corner,” said Draco after a few minutes’ trek through the Catacombs.

“You already have my email? How’d you get it?” Harry demanded.
HGW: Just a moment.
“Yes we can,” Ron piped up.
Neville smiled. “Never much of a planner, our Harry.”
“Hmm,” said Harry--said Hari--burrowing his forehead slightly into Sirius’ shoulder. “That’d make a hell of a tattoo.”
“I resent that.”
“We are,” said Sirius. “They’re--friends. Of mine, sure, but what you have to understand--”
“Like it, kid?”
Draco went out to the balcony to smoke, wearing nothing but a pair of Tom’s silk briefs. It was stinking hot, the kind of weather that made all of London smell of exhaust and curry and sweat, and Draco swore if he sniffed deep enough he could smell a ghost of Victorian effluvia wafting off the Thames a few blocks away. He lit his cigarette.
“Luna? Lovegood? Are they courting?” Arthur considered it, then shrugged. “I had no idea. But Luna’s always around, so I suppose they must still be an item.”
Enjoy.
“I’ll thank you to take your hands off my date,” said Draco.
Ginny and Luna are home. Friends showed to drag me to dinner. Recovering well. Hope you got a full English in.
. I mean--I can interfere with a raid here and there, but without being able to--is everyone okay? How’s Beatrice?” Beatrice was Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour’s young daughter, a child that had been in hiding since birth. She was a sunny strawberry blond imp, and a symbol in Potterwatch of everything they were fighting for. Especially in the years since Fleur had died defending her from a Death Eater attack.
“Not?”
of it all before he could decide how to proceed. As Draco paid his bill, he nodded to himself with all the bourgeois determination he could muster (though, admittedly, that was little enough). He was in a desperate situation, so he would do that which was, generally speaking, anathema to him.
“I just...I dunno, it’s stupid.”
“Then thank your little Gryffindor gods I wasn’t there,” Draco had said. “If I’d heard heard the lout speak that way about you, I’m fairly certain I’d have hexed his balls off. Still might, come to think of it.”
Rolf?” Harry asked conversationally, his voice still an invalid’s croak.
Draco was surprised--if Tom wasn’t taking the time to equivocate, he must be truly upset. Draco didn’t recall ever having the power to upset Tom like this before.
“Business interests.”
“What do you mean?”
Two Malfoys toasted each other, while two Potters groaned in synchronized humiliation.
“A good observation, Potter,” Draco murmured, troubled.

“Yes, My Lord,” said Pettigrew, quickly retreating back into the shadows.
“Ron,” Hermione scolded, “there’s no need for that.”
“We didn’t
“I want to know what’s going on!” protested Harry, but it sounded weak even to his own ears. He was so tired.
“You’re too kind.”
“Harry, mate?” squeaked a very red-faced Ron, “You gonna take this?”
Hermione gave him a specially bound copy of

“Oh yes,” Ginny nodded, “Second favorite. Or haven’t you seen Dean Thomas’ latest project with Stuart Semple?”
“He can have that, to a point. Unless the kids need new homes, there isn’t all that much I can do. It’s Hermione he has to worry about.”
“I mean it, Draco.” Harry looked pained. “I really don’t want to be here. I don’t--it’s not fun for me, all right? This is not a
At tea, Minerva caught him staring after the Bloody Baron with a mixture of longing and disgust.
HP: tom stopped by my office today
Harry turned very, very red.
“Now we wait,” said Harry in answer to Draco’s confused look.
“Or a hostage situation.”
I hope I did Hari’s name justice! I saw the idea on that one tumblr post that floated around a few years ago and couldn’t get it out of my head. I did a little research, but I don’t really know what I’m talking about, so if I did something wrong, please let me know so I can fix it!
hate him.”
die, did I?”
“Cheers,” she said. They clinked mugs, then drank.
“No,” he said, and reattached face to pillow.
Harry was irritated. He was going to have to show up to the restaurant. He needed to make the toff--oh, excuse him, the Earl--take his goddamned money back and rein in his self-righteousness.
Finally, the man--Harry--stormed out of the cafe and nearly ran into Draco.
And Draco had to admit to himself that, drama queen though he may be, Tom always knew how to cut him to the quick. Sighing, he stubbed out his cigarette and called Pansy.
Harry blushed.
“I love you two,” he said, “and I’m sorry I made you worry. Luna, Gin, I’m sorry I missed your messages.”
“You shouldn’t believe everything that man tells you.”
THANK YOU for being here today.
“Right!” Sirius jumped up. “Right, I’ll get us something. Any requests?” He turned to Harry. “Any favorites?”
Please type like a human.
Harry sat with a drink in front of him, but didn’t sip it--he wasn’t quite ready to wash that little taste of Malfoy’s blood off his tongue. He hoped the bastard was somewhere licking his wounds, and that he would Floo tomorrow.
“Best not think on it,” Draco agreed. “Doesn’t do to go too deep. Next we’ll be discussing how it is we both became familiar with the plot of
“I don’t have the information you want,” said Harry. “Only--only
“Well?” she asked Harry, “What do you have to say for yourself?”
“I can’t do magic,” he said after a pause.
Harry’s eyes widened in alarm, and even Hagrid was tactful enough to change the subject.
“You’re not wrong,” Harry admitted. “We didn’t exactly have time for breakfast this morning…”
“I miss her,” said Harry. “All of you.”
. He knew one or two people who could probably tease some actual information out of this jargon.
ur as bad as ron
“I thought that was because we were all a bunch of mudbloods and blood traitors?” Hermione asked with no small edge of hostility.
“Were you talking to someone?” he asked. Draco contemplated telling Tom what had just passed. He loved Tom. He didn’t like to hide things from him. But sometimes it was necessary--like, for example, when a storm of temper threatened to ruin a decent night. So Draco decided to keep Harry’s confidence, Lord help him, for the moment.
So Hari headed for the guest room to wake his best friend and--
Harry groaned.
been a nightmare, in fact, but Harry had a fortunate tendency not to remember his dreams. They couldn’t be pleasant. He often woke with a headache from grinding his teeth.
Draco nodded.
“Afraid to speak his name, Potter?” Draco taunted.

“Er,” he said, “there may be...an element of truth…”
“Hmm?”
“Yes sir,” said Harry, still mischievous. He climbed onto the bed and stayed on his hands and knees, looking over his shoulder. “How do you want me?”
From: Draco Malfoy
“No harm done,” said Draco. “I had suspected as much.”
“Don’t change the subject.”
The wall melted away into a high, open archway, revealing a gorgeous entrance hall, all columns and arches in white stone. It was fairly empty, except for a few short men in immaculate suits. Harry supposed these men--guards, were they?--were the goblins Draco had mentioned, what with their pointy ears and such. They were certainly intimidating, height aside.
“One of my better moments,” said Draco, “but you can see my dilemma.”
“Noted,” said Harry.
“Wizards are mortal,” said Sirius to Amy at the same time.
“All right, then. Go on.”
Pettigrew ignored this. “Anyway, I saw Potter looking at the other boys, especially Weasley. In the unlikely event that he has interest in women, it is not an exclusive interest.”
Draco supposed he ought to be glad that Tom chose not to catch him in his office this time.
Harry took a sip of the beer. “For what?”
us,” Ginny grumbled. Beside her, Dean grunted his agreement.
“Simple, at least from my perspective. To spend what I believed would be an enjoyable evening with a person who interested me, and to remove all obstacles to that goal.”
but ur sweet
Rose clapped Al on the back. “Good for you. I’m glad to hear it.”
“I know it’s difficult,” Harry said after a moment. “I understand you never expected your Mum and I to split up—neither did we, really—and then to see me not only with someone else, but with another man. It must be difficult. I get that, I really do.”
“Oh,” said Harry quietly. He cleared his throat a little, then said, more certainly, “green.”
“What the
“Haz,” said Amy, “can you believe you’re dating this nerd?”
“Call for you,” he chirped.
“Er,” said Harry.
“Harry. Harry Potter.”
RGW: im sorry about all this mate. it blows.
They looked at each other.
“Don’ wanna start a fight,” Harry muttered to the cutlery.
When, some twenty minutes later, he hadn’t completed a single line, he opened his email.
“One of these days,” said Draco with a sigh.
“But how?” Sirius asked, voice cracking. “How can it have been secret? Hogwarts, at least--the Book would have had to register magical activity--how--?”
“What was that?” Ron asked as Harry slumped back down into his seat.
“I don’t think so,” said Harry, getting down off the counter and trying to sidle away.
“Not where he eats, but where he is eaten.”
Harry almost laughed in amazement. “Anywhere! You have everything. Stay right where you are.”
“Not without telling me,” said Harry.
Harry ran a hand through his hair. “D’you have to turn everything into an insult?”
“Look, Harry,” said Draco, “Everybody in my fucking world knows your name. But we all thought you were dead.”
Scorpius took a moment to compose himself before heading upstairs to dress. He breathed in, and breathed out. His father loved him. There would be plenty of wine at dinner. It would be all right. He would just tell his father that he was in love with Harry Potter’s son and...oh, Merlin, this was going to be a
This was
“It’s true, Dad,” said Albus. “He’s been doing so well in History of Magic that Professor Binns has actually started remembering his name!”
Surprised and a bit miffed at being interrupted, Harry looked up to find Draco Malfoy standing above him. He could not have been more astonished. Of course Harry knew Draco’s office building was only a few doors down from his, but it might as well have been a world away. Draco was the sort to be reminded by his secretary that he had to attend a three-martini lunch with visiting dignitaries, rather than simply popping over to Pret for a sandwich and cuppa after crying in a cubicle all morning, as Harry had. He looked out of place, too, in his Armani, surrounded by plebs like Harry (who wore discount Burberry at his fanciest, and then only when Hermione bought it for him).
?” Arthur asked, eyes widening.
“Right, well.” Draco cleared his throat. “Harry, as unfortunate as it is that it falls to me to tell you this, I suppose I must. You’re famous.” When neither Harry nor Amy made a move to do anything but stare at him in disbelief, Draco continued. “Wizards and witches live alongside the Muggle world--that’s what we call your world, the one without magic in it. I suppose I should start with that. We’ve got our own government, schools, even a few all-Wizarding villages.”
Hermione winced as Harry got up and left. She hated when he quoted Tom.
“Have we all dined?” Draco asked, placing his knife and fork next to each other meticulously in what Harry supposed was one of those mysterious upper-class rituals meant to send messages to silent servants. “Good. We have more to discuss.”
“No,” said Ron through a mouthful of chips.
“That...doesn’t make me any less worried,” said Harry at last. Draco shrugged.
“Okay, so, I was with Lord Toffington at this posh fucking restaurant--don’t laugh, Amy, I’m in pain--”
“What sort of family,” Luna wondered aloud, “would force a man to choose between
“You talking about him and the Malfoy boy?” he asked Neville, who nodded.
“Thanks,” he finally said. “That’s...good advice, actually.”
“Oh, never mind that. What time are you off?”
“That’s rather rude,” said Draco.
“Terrifying,” said Draco. “But not as terrifying as what I found.”
“You look grim,” Hermione observed, sitting down next to him with her cuppa and obscenely vegetable-ridden sandwich.
“Mr. Potter,” she greeted with detached, ironic professionalism.
“Harry, you
not--”
Harry left Draco--who was possibly his boyfriend, now?--sleeping in his bed, wondering fondly whether the lout had any respect at all for business hours. Survey said no. He briefly considered wearing Draco’s discarded dress shirt to the meeting with Lord Malfoy, but it was a no go: too long in the sleeves, too tight in the chest. Plus, wrinkled. Instead, he dressed in his own clothes, just as he did for a regular work day. Let Lord Malfoy sneer. He probably would, regardless.
“No, My Lord,
“Thank you, My Lord,” said Draco, pleased with the notion.
“Wow,” said Hugo.
“Right, I know, but—”
“My aunt.” Harry tried to wipe his eyes with his sleeve, only to find Draco’s handkerchief was there first. “I’m sorry. I thought...but it was stupid. I was going to run into them eventually. I just…”
“No,” said Ron, with a resigned expression, “it’s definitely about trust.”
“And go where?” Draco asked.
“What you
“I told you, Sirius, that Harry and I met recently,” Draco began, cutting through the thick silence, “but I haven’t told you how.”
“Yes, Father?” Draco shifted in an attempt to get comfortable. He was on his knees in Professor Snape’s office, his head in the fireplace so he could speak with his father.
“I know a lovely restaurant,” Draco assured her. “We should be safe while we’re in public--even Aunt Bella wouldn’t risk a highly visible attack on foreign soil. When it comes to lodgings, though, we should lie low.”

“Resent it all you want. It’s still true.”
“Why don’t you go and see if Errol wants an owl-biscuit in the meantime?” Molly suggested.
“Can’t we just catch them?” Ron demanded. “Doesn’t seem like it should be that hard to take them down, given we have an informant.”
“Your family was on
“It was his intellectual prowess that drew me to him,” Hermione deadpanned.
“This can’t be easy for you,” Harry agreed, but couldn’t muster much sympathy on that count.
“Well then,” Draco sighed in mock-resignation, “what will I be wearing for the rest of my life?”
“--we’re called Potterwatch now,” Sirirus concluded.
,” said Harry feelingly, and swiped the bottle of firewhisky back from Amy.
“Get down!” Draco shouted at the other two as he drew his wand and stood. In the doorway was a woman with wild dark curls and a maniacal gleam in her eye.
Harry did not go into work early the next day. In fact, he went in almost an hour late, hair still drying from his shower, utterly exhausted. He had been at his desk just long enough to do his most pressing paperwork when Kingsley approached.
“I was an infant,” Harry responded, more harshly than he meant to.
“Ah.” Draco seemed surprised, but recovered quickly. “Well, it’s all tied to Wizarding politics, so I suppose you’d have no reason to be aware. Harry is the last of the Potter line, but has not yet had the chance to claim his inheritance, as he was until recently believed to be deceased.”
“Oh?”
“He really did hurt you, didn’t he?”
“I can think of a few reasons,” said Harry.
Draco cringed, remembering the last time Harry and Tom had encountered each other face to face. He nodded slightly, conceding the point, and reached for another cigarette.
“You’re not the one who should be sorry,” said Draco. “What
an interest before.” Draco examined his ghostly reflection in the sleek black elevator ceiling. “I’ve made a grave mistake, Theo. I involved myself in a venture, and now I find myself in need of content knowledge. And you know how I feel about that.”
“And you...haven’t...you can’t…”
“Well.” Aberforth fixed Harry with a freezing stare. “Your man ever try to take over the world?”
Luna, and with her the outcasts.
“Maybe,” agreed Hermione, exasperated.
From: Harry Potter
nephew, boy, and I’ll do what I bloody well like to him!” Vernon roared over Petunia’s shushings and hisses.
“Don’t call her that.”
Harry was delighted that his children were so eager to converse with him, but it had been hard to get a word in edgewise through the whole dinner. Now, however, they were busily tucking into the chocolate cake he’d baked while they unpacked, and it was the time to speak. He swallowed.
“Your what?”
Boyfriend, indeed. Draco vowed not to allow himself to slip up like that again. He could afford a lot, but he couldn’t afford that.
“Sadly,” said Draco, “the scientists at the Malfoy Company labs have yet to invent a reliable method of time travel.”
“Maybe. I’m really surprised by him. And, weird as it is, I find him kind of comforting. We’ve been through a lot of the same things, even if we experienced them differently. I’ve known him a long time. It’s true that it’s only recently that I started to consider that a good thing, but now I do. I like him, Gin. I’m trying not to think too much about it. But what if we could be good for each other?”
Here's a chapter!  I know these take forever, and I'm sorry about that.  Not sorry enough to fix it, though.
“All right, I have to say it,” said Ginny finally. “Saw it coming.” She turned to Harry and pointed from Albus to Scorpius. “Told you so.” Turning to Hermione, she pointed now from Harry to Draco. “
When Harry emerged, Sirius immediately handed him a cup of tea. It smelled nice--definitely not PG Tips--and was in a genuine
“Er?” said Harry, “
“Hari,” Sirius whispered, still holding him close. “H-A-R-I. Your real name. It’s Sanskrit. Means ‘lion.’”
“I’m right here,” said Hari. “You don’t need to talk around me. This Potterwatch— the organization Arthur comes from, yeah? The one you lost touch with, Draco?”
“I have to.”
“Righ’, well. Trog. Mean little one, ‘e was. Always gettin’ into fights with his siblings an’ cousins an’--well, who knows? Aunts, uncles. Ye know what I mean. Had an appetite too, an’ it wouldn’ surprise me if that caused ‘alf the fights.”
“As if stalking isn’t enough? How does he know where you live? Or did he follow me?”
“Harry--” he began, but cut himself off when a shout was heard in the doorway and a jet of bright green light zipped over his shoulder, narrowly missing Amy’s head before blasting a hole in the wall.
“Not like that!” said Harry quickly. “I just mean he’s...er...he’s so much more careful about it, but he’s...dominant.”
“You could be,” said Draco.
Hello there! I am not dead, and neither is this fic! In fact, you'll notice I've finished outlining and now officially know how many chapters there are going to be...unless I change my mind.
“Fuck David Blaine,” the ribbon was corrected to read.
“I don’t believe we’ve met,” he said playfully. “My name is Draco Malfoy.” Hari grinned and shook his hand.
Turning back to the till from the bake case, Harry accidentally elbowed a stack of cardboard cups, knocking it to the floor.
Felt a bit personal to him.
“We’re going to come out to our parents over the holiday.”
Harry smiled wanly. “You can say his name.”
“My first thought is that he wants to avoid complications in the matter of--You-Know-Who.”
“Why did Tom give you the locket?” Draco asked, leaning in slightly, betraying the intensity of his interest.
“All right,” he said at last. “You’ve got me. I’m not one to turn down food.”
Tom did not move to let Harry out. Instead, he touched Harry’s hand where it wrapped around his glass. One touch, and Harry was back in his cupboard. Tom’s words fell like spiders on his head.
“I wonder,” said Lucius, bringing Draco’s attention back to the matter at hand. “You mentioned a failsafe for the plan. Two failsafes, as a matter of fact. What are they?”
So, like any Weasley would, he stayed to observe. Sirius was fighting the results of a neglected Facadio charm. Arthur smiled; he had seen a few of those in his day. Sirius seemed to have forgotten the trick of it, though, judging by the increasingly ridiculous jinxes he was throwing at the animate cupboard.
HGW: Am I wrong?
George narrowed his eyes. “And what do you reckon?”
“Congratulations, Harry” said Percy, whose bureaucratic training seemed to have given him the ability to recover quickly from surprising news.
“And an Oxford toff would know about that, would he?” Tom teased. Draco’s cigarette was nearly gone, and he still hadn’t passed it back.
Stay strong, all! I hope to hear from you with comments, concerns, or, if you like, completely unrelated tangents. I'm trapped indoors, after all, and my roommate will insist on learning the euphonium.
His mobile buzzed. He reached for it hungrily, having been isolated from all cellular service in that steel trap of a records room.
you felt you could tell me, I—”
There was a town car outside Draco’s building. Black, very black, with impenetrable tinted windows. There were two people likely to be in that car, neither of whom Draco wanted to see now, as he stumbled out of his apartment in the heavy late-morning light, sex-addled and seeking brunch. But of the two possibilities, his father was by far the worse prospect.
monster. A hint that there were children at risk was enough to make me overcome my pride and do my job, if only for the afternoon. I managed to get into the records room at our lab, but…” he shrugged helplessly. “Can’t make head nor tail of it. Thus, my appeal to Our Savior and his associated swot.” Draco wrinkled his nose at Ron. “I did
“Houses? Wha--oh, public school, right.” Harry shivered.
“No, Ronald. We’ve been over this. When you have a child, you accept them for who they are. It’s your duty as a parent.”
“Right,” said Harry bemusedly, "sorry."
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry, who in turn rested his head on his boyfriend’s shoulder. Draco was the taller of the two, which suited them well.
“I really won’t,” Harry said. “I’d prefer never to have met you, but forgetting you will have to do. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve a job search to conduct.”
If the discovery that his parents were murdered wizards, followed shortly by an attack on his best friend's apartment by acolytes of the murderer, hadn't been the strangest thing to happen to him tonight, Harry would have expected that the French goblin bank would make the cut.
Fuck off
“Who else would it be?” asked Luna. “Aside from us, and maybe Neville who we know wasn’t involved, who would Harry want to talk about Tom with?”
“Meow,” said Lump, and jumped straight into Sirius’ arms.
Draco laughed a little, somewhere on the edge between nervous and sardonic. “We’re clear. As to whether we can move on?” Draco didn’t answer his own question, but rather moved to sofa, where he picked up a lighter and a pack of cigarettes from the coffee table and lit up.
“Shite,” said Harry.
“And what
Welcome back!  This is where it really gets weird.
They didn’t talk about it. For years, they never talked about it.
Arthur zeroed in on Harry, squinting. “No--is it? It

“My apologies,

“So it would seem,” said Draco wryly.
“It’s all right,” he said lightly. “The curiosity will kill me if I don’t humor him. Watch my sandwich carefully, will you? That woman with the salad looks peckish, I don’t want her getting ideas.” With that Harry got up to follow Draco out of the restaurant, imagining how Ron would grin at his comment and Hermione would don her usual fondly exasperated look.
“Living with Hermione is really getting to you,” Harry observed.
“Hey.” Albus cupped Scorpius’ cheek in his hand. “Look at me. We can do this.”
“Oh, Harry,” said Hermione, making her famous ‘what am I going to do with you?’ face.
“Why not?” Amy demanded.
“You want me to just
Harry rolled over with alacrity, his smile fading into an expression of distant contentment. Draco realized with something of a headrush that he was watching Harry drop again. Without even being touched.
Methinks the lxaihwe;
Amy snorted, knowing his willingness to say such a thing in mixed company was a result of his utter exhaustion.
“I’m sorry to hear that,” said Amy, “but can we save the heavy conversation for after we’ve eaten?”
Lily made a gagging noise. That drew a genuine, if nervous, laugh out of Scorpius. They only used those nicknames in front of people they wanted to annoy.
,” he whispered. Sirius laughed, and even Draco cracked a smile.
“Yes, yes. Well, that is. Okay, first things first. I’m. Ahem. Rather gay.”
Luckily, by the time Harry would normally have come home from work, he was decently dressed in pyjama trousers and an old band tee of Sirius’. He’d had a leisurely time recollecting the previous evening, then showered again, had a cheese toastie, and spent the afternoon napping. He had just now got up, and was puttering about the kitchen making tea. So when the intercom buzzed, he was not in a compromising position, which was good, because it was Ron and Hermione. He let them up.
“Good evening, Mr. Malfoy,” said the goblin behind the desk in French-accented English.
“I trust he can,” agreed Draco, making his manner as easy as he could make it.
“Yes, well, Tom doesn’t give gifts,” said Draco, waving that concern away.
“Fair enough. She does have a distinctive effect.”
“Absolutely not!” said Hermione.
“Right. I have other reasons.”
“Didn’t you?” Harry asked.
“Not going to stab you,” said Harry.
“You’ve said.”
“I’m sure it will,” Harry ground out, “but I need the money. Now, if you’re quite finished pointing out my own poverty to me, I--”
As Vernon rounded on the maitre’d and began shouting at him, Draco quickly ushered Harry away to the loo. Once they were there, Draco lifted Harry so that he was sitting on the counter, then began dabbing at his face with a monogrammed handkerchief. Harry was too much in shock to protest.
“Right,” said Harry nervously, “why don’t I get everybody a drink.”
Sirius snorted. “You didn’t even know if I was alive.”
“I only thought it was a good turn of phrase,” he mumbled.
, Hermione?” Harry asked desperately. “I really
Harry,
, you mean--wait, what have you done to my trousers?”
“I know that,” she responded, rolling her eyes. “You just don’t strike me as the type to want to. You’re not flashy, and you usually hate being given things.”
“Your aunt killed my godfather,” Harry pointed out.
He emerged into the flat’s main living area to find Sirius--his
Harry sipped his drink, watching Draco with an unfathomable look in his eyes.
“Know what?” asked Harry nervously.
So Draco walked to his corner brunch spot while Pettigrew’s car crawled along beside him, dark and skulking as a low-hanging cloud. To Draco’s great relief, Pettigrew ordered nothing but coffee. When it arrived--along with Draco’s desperately needed mimosa--Pettigrew slithered into the conversation indelicately.
“Obviously,” Lucius scoffed, apparently feeling that Harry’s lack of grace excused him from his own usually cool manners.
“Yes, My Lord.” Pettigrew retreated, and Voldemort waved his hand for Draco to go on.
“Well, that’s an entirely inappropriate question to be asking at this hour,” said Draco. “Have you got a spare room, Sirius? I think perhaps we should let them sleep while we catch each other up to speed.”
Hermione would probably warn him that it was self-aggrandizing, but Harry couldn’t help but feel that kids--just,
“All right,” said Tom, “I can see you two are occupied. Harry, I’ll be in touch, all right?” Harry couldn’t react. He could only stare as Tom stood and walked out of the pub.
“Good. Go and wake her, if you would? I’ll start breakfast for all of us.”
“Fuck, let me get that,” he muttered, setting the scone down on the counter so he could crouch down to collect the cups and toss them in the bin. When he stood back up, he was looking into the eyes of a very offended young mother who was covering her sleeping infant’s ears.
“She killed my aunt,” said Draco.
“The reason,” Harry croaked, finally, “is that I’ve missed you more than I would have believed. It’s just been a few days, but—they’re not good days, without you.”
“What was?”
Lord, I should say.”
Draco didn’t hear anything from Harry over the next few days. Amid tense requests for updates on the progress of their plan, Granger was kind enough to assure him that Harry was all right, just throwing himself into his work as a distraction. She even went so far as to say it was “nothing personal.”
“Not to...He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named,” said Harry quickly. “Draco made an unexpected appearance on the balcony.”
Sirius glanced nervously at Hari. “Don’t you think we should ask if he’s ready to--”
Harry stared at Hermione. “You can’t just expect me to roll out of Molly Weasley’s fireplace after two years for a little chat.”
“Harry, mate, I didn’t--”
“Can you make decent tequila appear?” Harry blurted out.
Draco curled his lip. “We have a
no time
“I want to talk to them,” Hari said firmly. “I don’t doubt Amy will want to be with us for that. And neither of us is going anywhere without Lump. So, it’s looking like a family outing, yeah?”
“How, exactly, could I exaggerate this, Draco? The accounts are either frozen or they’re not!”
“No, My Lord,” said Pettigrew hurriedly. “I merely worry that the boy is being irresponsible with your valuable time, My Lord.”
“I--you--” Draco seemed at a loss for words.
, way to Lucius’ cold dead heart--he found himself hovering as Harry distributed goodbye hugs to a grim Ron and a steely Hermione.
“Why d’you think...that is...why’d your mum take me in in the first place?”
any more than they drink bag tea. It’s been bred out of them, like.”
, if that’s what you’re implying,” said Draco.
my friend, probably my best friend--and I hurt you. Used you. I always knew you felt things for me that I didn’t feel for you.”
“You can’t Summon a person,” Harry said.
“The Concern is that you have been associating with a gentleman who has Competing Interests.”
When Harry finally lifted his head, Draco asked, “Why did they call you ‘Potter’? I thought your name was Harold Evans?”
“Thank you,” said Draco primly, sitting gingerly on the one armchair, a hideous orange corduroy monstrosity that Amy had rescued from a curbside. That left Harry and Amy to perch nervously on the sofa (a pink and green paisley, courtesy of Oxfam).
of us. I wasn’t really worried about my diet, either, aside from getting my hands on something to eat in the first place.” All of Sirius’ attention was on Harry now, the stove ignored.
Draco sniffed. “They’re not wrong for it.”
“I think I’ve made the best choice I can,” he said.
Draco’s eyes flashed. “I think you’re mistaking me for yourself, Potter.”
“Well then?” said Draco, “Do you want the photo or not?”
“I’ll have a chat with Dr. Pince,” Theo announced, seemingly immune to the oppressive miasma. “We’ll get the proposals, prospectus, all of that. Even the data, such as it is.” He gave Draco a sympathetic look. “You’ll have a pass to stay as late as you need.”
They went home to Grimmauld Place, dressed for dinner, took one look at each other, and undressed. After showering, dressing again, and feeding the dogs, they arrived at The Burrow only five minutes past the hour.
At his not-a-dinner-date with Draco, Harry runs into some surprising fellow diners and some even more surprising revelations. For example: who knew you were supposed to *sip* wine?
,” said Amy.
“Welcome to the
Harry just smiled and pulled Draco closer. They stood that way for a moment.
“My uncle,” said Harry.
“Is that not perhaps a bit—”
It was incredible how, though they’d only just met, Harry could
“He never learned yours,” said Scorpius’ dad to Mr. Potter.
Draco shook his head. Harry looked into his eyes, and he saw compassion there, but not pity.
Harry had put in his notice with the Head Auror that morning. He couldn’t do it any more—fight, face the bureaucracy, bank on his fame, any of it. His adoptive family hadn’t understood.
“This is about...”
“Make up your mind,” said Draco. “Murderous stalker or caring acquaintance? I need to know if you’re going to stab me or light my cigarette, and the suspense is killing me.”
“Flying broom,” Harry repeated.
Presently Draco finished his conversation and called Harry’s and Amy’s names, gesturing for them to follow him. They took echoing steps through the entrance hall until they found themselves turning a corner into a quieter, lower-ceilinged corridor lined with polished wooden doors. The goblin security guard opened one, spoke in low tones to the goblin--account manager, Harry supposed--inside, and then nodded for them all to enter the office. The room was bare except for a large desk and the chair in which its denizen sat--there weren’t even any chairs for clients. The security goblin shut the door behind them, quietly but with finality.
fuck off
“You’re not fucking,” Tom growled.
“False,” said Harry. “I’m loads of fun.”
“Mate,” said Harry, “you shouldn’t have.”
Harry’s reaction, at the time, had been similar. But later, when he’d gone to his heavily warded “Muggle room” and looked it up online, he’d been--well, he’d been what passed for delighted with him these days.
“Magical tattoo,” said Sirius with a chuckle.
“So…do you not want me to tell him?”
I’m a man who did not sleep last night.
Who are you
“Another?” Draco offered with an arched brow.
, yes? At which point one is free to pursue one’s own desires until business recommences the following day?”
“But, Papa! I have needs!”
“No, Harry,” Dumbledore sighed, “For the fifth time, I do not believe Mr. Malfoy is in league with Tom Riddle any longer.”
Draco held up a single finger, indicating that he was not yet ready to respond. He drained his glass, set it down, and put his head in his hands.
Harry couldn’t help rolling his eyes just a bit at the proud, possessive way Greengrass said Lord Malfoy’s first name, drawling it just as Draco’s lackeys had done his when they were in school. Like it was such a coveted achievement to be cordial with one’s boss.
“Ah. That’s...
“Potter,” Draco answered the phone.
“That’s a shame,” said Draco, “as I’ve planned our entire menu for the evening. Do at least taste the wine.”
“Harry!” She hugged him. “And Draco. It’s nice to meet you. I’m sorry it didn’t happen sooner.” She offered her hand.
Harry continued to watch as Sirius fired away at the now-dodging cupboard. Eventually he started calling out helpful instructions-- “Lower!” and “A little to the left!,” that sort of thing. It began to feel rather like a game, and Harry found it quite absorbing in his exhaustion.
Nothing’s wrong.
and you have no fucking right to it?”
“Shush,” said Hermione.
would be to his taste, Mum.”
“Look, I’m
“Actually,” said Theo with grim humor, “it’s progress.”
“‘Lo, Victoire,” he said to the five-year-old, patting her head as it was the only part of her he could reach without falling over.
As it was rather difficult to live with someone to whom you weren’t speaking, Draco (and Salazar the Crup, cruelly separated from his greyhound companion, Godric) went to stay with his parents at Malfoy Manor. Harry figured this situation would probably support his intention to think things through in a thorough and permanent manner, even if every second that he and Draco (and Salazar and Godric) were on the outs was painful.
wouldn’t do. But Draco had a new way to avoid a Talk with Potter, and so far it had been effective. Time to put it to a further test.
“How do you know?” asked the blond. There was a line forming behind him now. Though somewhat aroused, Harry was also annoyed at the man’s attitude, as well as confused about his apparent interest in Harry. So he pointedly looked over the man’s shoulder.
“I dunno.”
There were touches of dawn light showing through the curtains, and Amy was still asleep. Lump was nowhere to be found. Most likely wandered off in search of food. A good notion, that.
“Malfoy!" He growled, “What are you doing?”
Of course he didn’t. He hadn’t understood what an overwhelming love he had poisoned in Harry--why would he suddenly comprehend what Draco was offering him? Harry felt a sudden and sharp pity.
“Uncle Harry!” Victoire Weasley shot out of the kitchen like a tiny blond comet, and was shortly wrapped around Harry’s legs.
“A Malfoy always corrects his errors,” said Draco, “and I never make enemies if I can help it.”
“He ran to our place,” said Amy, gesturing to herself and the snoring cat. “This was tonight, by the way.”
“Yes,” said Hari, “and cheese. As does Lump.”
“Nah. I’d just sneak in and rescue them. Effective, but not long-term.”
“Indeed,” said Draco. “Stay still, now. I’m going to undress you.”
,” he sobbed into the old man's shoulder.
“Oh, Harry, you
“Harry,” said Eric, “my office, if you please."
“I assume, from your tone, that it wasn’t for a lark?”
“There’s a sign--” Amy cut herself off to make an alarmed squeaking noise. “You just walked right through it!”
“Of course.” Draco went to his bag--which he had deposited on a chair in the front room, Harry not possessing anything so civilized as a rack to hang it on--and retrieved the file. When he returned to the kitchen, he found Hermione already reaching for it, a grim look on her face. He handed it over, and she was immediately absorbed.
“Why indeed,” said Draco mysteriously, giving Harry a fond look.
Harry said nothing, but nodded again, so Draco fell to it, continuing to unbutton Harry’s shirt--and if he was a little rough with the mass-produced monstrosity of a garment, maybe loosening one or two of those buttons, maybe popping a seam as he untucked the shirt from Harry’s trousers--well, who was there to notice it or to blame him? Anyway, he was happy enough to buy a replacement.

Lily gave him a curious look over the top of the

have a type,” Draco remarked.
“Fourteen,” Draco corrected, “During the inter-school triathlon.”
Draco ordered another drink and thought furiously. How was Potter an Interest in any business endeavour of his or Tom’s? Was that just an incredibly oblique threat? Couldn’t be. Tom never made entirely empty threats, even on the rare occasions when he was forced into bluffing. There probably was some venture afoot that would be hindered by Harry’s virtuous scrutiny. And Tom, he supposed, was using that as a wedge to drive between them.
Or, Draco Takes Harry To Lunch
Both were looking at him so intensely--and with matching grey eyes, Harry saw, supposing that was a sign of the family resemblance--that he gave in with a nod, following Sirius to a neat, untouched spare bedroom.
“Sorry--do clothes get cat hair on them?” Draco’s furrowed brow smoothed as a realization came to him. “Of course. Wizarding clothes come charmed against that sort of thing. It’s a bit more advanced than I am in tailoring, but I’m sure we can eventually find someone who can charm your clothes so that the cat’s hair doesn’t stick to them in the first place.”
“No, I mean--” Harry growled in frustration-- “d’you need to go inside and get a plaster?”
“Wha?” Amy grumbled, clutching a still-snoring Lump. Draco had paced to a corner, where he was literally pulling out his hair. Harry watched wide-eyed as Sirius fired a variety of charms at the shouting cupboard, none of which seemed to make an impact.
know this is my work number, Lord Malfoy?”
,” Draco snapped. “There’s no need for evasion, Potter.”
“...standard abusive behavior,” Hermione was muttering. “Really an elaborate form of gaslighting, getting witnesses to claim he meant no harm when…”
“Just come with me,” Draco demanded, leading them to the next tunnel. There was a screech, and Draco and Harry turned to find Amy staring at the walls, clutching her cat.
“I know,” said Harry, dunking his biscuit again.
Amy was beginning to tear up, so she awkwardly held her cat in front of her face to hide that. Harry looked around. Silvertooth appeared vaguely disgusted with the emotional display, while Draco was staring at him with an odd expression.
“It’s okay, Harry,” she said, taking his hand. “It’s okay to say what happened.”
“Y’know,” said Harry, “looking back, I sort of feel like the ferret incident might have been traumatic for Malfoy? Like maybe it wasn’t as funny as we remember?”
sorry. I had no intention to...be a malignant force in your life. I wanted a date with the pretty boy at the till, that’s all.” In his experience, talk of this sort worked well on Muggles. And fuck him if Draco didn’t really, really want this Muggle.
“Your office?”
“Right, sorry.”
But there was more silence.
“Come to dinner with me tonight,” he said.
“That’s all right,” Seamus replied. “We’ll do it for you, mate.”
“I never knew,” added Harry, voice gentler now. “I mean, I could have guessed. I faced enough racist stereotyping growing up. In fact, that’s probably
“Six-thirty,” he said, and walked away.
“Well,” said Draco, eyes lighting up again, “it’s a vastly understudied area, but I like the theory that Muggles can see any magic that is designed for
“That’s hardly the same thing,” Ron objected.
“Theo!” he greeted without so much as clearing his throat first, “How’s my favorite swot?”
“What?” Draco demanded.
“I am happy with him, though,” Harry continued, “and I want you and Scorpius to be happy, too. Even if it makes for a bit of an awkward Christmas.”
When Amy quietened down a bit, he said, “But I don’t understand. I
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Ron scoffed. “Posh types like him don’t have
“Not now, George,” said Angelina to her husband.
“Too right,” said Sirius in a jokingly crisp accent. “It

“Oh for
“Hold on for a mo.” He stopped, and looked Harry and Amy up and down.
“Well, yes, you see,” said Draco smoothly, “I can use this apparent change of heart to my advantage and worm my way into the inner circle of Gryffindors at school. Within a month, I plan to be fucking Dumbledore’s golden boy. This will establish Dumbledore’s trust, while that trust itself will be my in with Potter. You get a crafty intelligencer established amongst people close to Dumbledore, plus renewed funding, and I get the finest arse in—well, in all of Scotland, at least, I think that’s fair to say.”
“Thanks,” said Harry, and leaned against the counter on the other side from Sirius. “Where’s everyone else?”
Three hours of arduous research--aided by a baffled Gerta--had yielded a disturbing result, though one that Draco, on consideration, should probably have expected. It
“This is my only one, so Harry, if you want to take my room--” but Harry and Amy were already climbing into bed together.
Harry wondered where the hickey was. He shrugged.
Harry responded by catching his eye with an open, frank look. “Yes,” he said, “I am.”
“Easy for you to say,” said Harry. “You married a Gryffindor.”
Kingsley burst out laughing. “Harry,” he said, “You’ve been working here three years and you’ve never taken a sick day. You don’t have a visit till Tuesday. We’ll be fine without you for the afternoon.”
They were both silent for a moment, remembering another of the reasons their relationship hadn’t worked.
“You and Draco are moving too fast,” she said, cringing in anticipation of an indignant response that didn’t come.
“Who is it?”
Unfortunately, Mr. Potter was a very friendly man.
“We do,” she said. Ron nodded emphatically.
” and then rapidly descended into sounds Harry could not distinguish. Draco responded in his gorgeous, fluent French and soon had the waiter leading them to a table, chatting rapidly all the while. That is, until he saw Harry and stopped dead, his handsome face turning white.
“All right, we’ve got the dog and the demon. Look, do you want me to do my exercise or not?”
“Obviously,” said Lily.
for us. And then you got up.
their wives’ boyfriends?”
Scorpius didn’t look at his father. Instead, he waved to the Granger-Weasleys—Hugo waved back and Rose winked at him—and turned to lead his father away from the platform. His father put a hand on his shoulder as they walked to the Apparition station, but said nothing until they were back at the Manor’s receiving room. An elf appeared to take the luggage, and Scorpius thanked him.
is going on?”
While they waited to get off the crowded train, Scorpius tapped Al’s shoulder.
“That’s the problem,” said Harry. “I think he’d tell the world to fuck itself. I think he’d kill half of England himself to keep me.”
“Ah.” Father paused to take a sip of his brandy. His face was composed, but the sip was long. When he was done, he merely said, “That casts an interesting light on my news.”
It was at times frightening to see Tom’s great mental capacity at work. His processing speed was intimidating. At one moment he was the picture of innocent bafflement, and the next…

“And I meant what I said before,” replied Harry, raising his voice again. “I won’t prostitute myself, not for anything. And I won’t
“No need.”
Harry woke suddenly, alert, as though from a nightmare. Probably
“I’m going to do some research. There must be some kind of legal recourse here, even if restraining orders are stupidly limited.”
Yes, Harry loved a surprising, an overwhelming number of the living. And now that he had dragged his reeking corpse out of the muck for them--well, he hated them, too.
“Yes it is,” said Luna. “If they don’t accept you, they’re not your family.”
“And you can’t have another copy made...why?” Draco tried.
my children?” Harry asked weakly.
He looked at Draco, who looked as if he’d just had the shock of his life. “What?”
“And, of course, we have the incredible comfort of our two enormous fortunes.”
“Course not,” said Ginny, “but I
It shouldn’t have surprised him that Hermione was the first to catch on, but it did. Somehow all her organized competence shielded her darkness from his memory: the cruelty of the girl, the
“What?” said Harry.
To hide his fashionista's disgust with the whole situation, he leaned in to nibble at Harry’s hip as he slowly pulled the pants down. Not till he felt Harry step out of them entirely did he risk a glance at Harry’s bobbing cock, and then, once that had distracted him thoroughly from all sartorial musings, Harry’s face. Parted lips, glazed eyes. Harry was down. Deep. Almost too deep for the circumstances.
“Oh, Harry,” she said, “You didn’t.”
There were so
“Funnily enough,” said Sirius, “I got that from the young lady’s description.”
“No. Not really. I mean--yeah, some things about it bother me. Being cheated on bothers me. But it doesn’t feel like something Draco did. When I think about it, I’m almost more bothered at the thought of him being with Tom from his perspective. It makes me...I dunno, worry about him.”
“I’m, er.” The waiter blinked. “If this isn’t a hallucination, it’s possible that I’m your godfather. Harry?”
“I bet David Blaine could do that,” she said.
ratatouille, Potter.”
“I can get you a new job,” said Draco. “A better one, so you wouldn’t have to work two.”
“You know what I mean.”
“We all look a little the worse for wear, I think,” Draco mused. “There are a few charms I can use--they freshen clothes, get the wrinkles out, that sort of thing. Would you mind if I used them on you?”
, Hermione?” Harry snapped. The mug in his hand was shaking.
“It would appear not,” Draco agreed with a frown.
“Who exactly
“Thanks.”
Malfoys always make the first move.
Draco went to the side of the bed, letting one hand drift up to stroke Harry’s hair while the other squeezed his hip, thumb pressing into the red spot where his teeth had just been.
“They’re testing out a new drug,” she said slowly. “From what I can tell, it’s supposed to be harmless enough--a new cold medicine. But the concern is that it has narcotic effects, and might create dependency in children or tempt parents to use it as a chemical restraint. Essentially, it’s risky enough that no parent was willing to volunteer their child for the testing with full informed consent. So rather than go back to the drawing board, they’ve been offering cash and luring poor parents in without giving them a full understanding of the dangers involved.”
“I don’t understand,” said Tom, though the flicker in his eyes assured Draco that he did. “How have I hurt you?”
“All right, all right, we’re both clever. Now, are you going to tell me what’s so terribly wrong with the world?”
“I believe I said something about pots and kettles,” Draco responded.
i promise it isn’t you
Draco looked up with watery eyes. “And my p-p-”
“Then I’ll have to pay you back,” said Harry. “It’ll take all year though. Here, I have the first month with me now…”
And he kissed Harry, intensely, spinning him around almost balletically so he was crushed against the wall. Harry definitely hated every moment of it, and if there were choruses of angels singing in his ears and fireworks behind his eyes and stars and birds twittering around his head, that was just the effect of being slammed against a wall unexpectedly, now, wasn’t it?
Sirius laughed a thick, heavy laugh. “It would. Maybe yours can match mine.”
Ginny hugged him. “Forgiven, you sod.”
“Nor does he loan his things,” added Draco, “which brings me back to my question. Why
honestly? idk. there’s a lot going on here
“Because,” Draco said with a shrug, “you’re beautiful. I like beautiful things. I watched you for a while, and you seemed like someone I’d enjoy spending time with.”
“I’m not picky,” said Harry. “Neither is Amy--just, no meat for her.”
Surprise!  New chapter!  I mean, I get that every new chapter is a surprise because the updates are so sporadic...did I mention thanks for sticking with this?
“It’s a good plan, Draco,” said Lucius after his son wrapped up the explanation of his scheme. “I have only one follow-up question.”
“But we should try to present a united front, if only because--” Harry choked a little. “What are we going to do about Tom?”
“Of course it is,” said Hermione quietly.
“Ugh,” said Ginny. “I take it back.” She poured them each another teacup of whisky, and the conversation moved on to some of the less Ron-friendly stories from her time away training. When they were tipsy enough that Harry was capable of being good company, they headed out to join the others for dinner.
Glad to have you here.
Harry gritted his teeth, trying to swallow back the venom that seemed to well in his mouth at hearing Draco call him by his surname as if they were at school again. That was decidedly not what this meeting was about. This meeting was about avoiding pissing Draco off long enough to claim the photograph back so that he could walk away and, god willing, never see the toff or his psychopath fuck buddy ever again.
“I slept in his dormitory for three years,” said Pettigrew.
“I didn’t ask you for advice,” said Draco nastily.
“We prefer the term ‘lover.’”
She didn’t say a word. Just nudged her tartan biscuit tin toward him.
“I’ve known Harry was alive for less than a month,” Draco added. “I haven’t been able to re-establish contact with the Order in the past year or so, and we were under some pressure to exit the country with haste, so I brought him here.”
“Now that we’re all acquainted,” said Draco, “I have a rather irregular request. You have heard of Harry, I presume, Silvertooth?”

“Too right,” said Draco, somewhat weakly.
“It’s not Mum I’m worried about,” Albus told her.
“It’s not about Houses.”
“Right,” said Harry breathlessly.
“What changed?”
“Of course I see why it’s hard on them,” said Neville. “I won’t say it was easy on me, either. You know that, mate. But it’s love. It’s not about choosing, and it’s not about who deserves it.”
“Thank you,” she said, executing a little curtsy as she handed him his coffee. He took a quick gulp, grimacing. He didn’t particularly enjoy the stuff, no matter how it was sweetened, but he did find it more bracing than tea of a morning.
“All right, so his company was fucking irritating, but the wine was expensive but it was free for me, so there I was, not leaving. But then he got to be too much and I decided to get up and leave after all but then I ran into someone--Amy, it’s not funny, look, stop laughing--Amy, it was my uncle!”
“I’m a cheese and pickle man,” said Harry stolidly. “There’s no harm in that.”
“Well,” said Dumbledore. “I do have one idea.” The Headmaster was, in fact, proud of himself for thinking of it. It was an excellent rationalization for why he was unable to tear his eyes off the Malfoy boy.
“I have to agree with Hermione,” said Harry. “I don’t need any further reminders of how stupid I’ve been, thanks.”
Scorpius walked over and sat beside Lily, "I'm glad you're my sister, Lily."
Luna looked at him, "When you turn thirteen, my little star."
Portkey to England, Check.
Scorpius walked over and sat next to Lily. "I don't know how we have the same last name, but it's nice to meet you, Lily"
She looked at him, "Right on time."
The children hugged their fathers and started to leave with the teachers.
“That one took off for Australia right after she found out Harry was pregnant. Refuses to speak to him or the Weasleys. We somehow got her to explain herself to Neville.. and none of it was good. Harry doesn't know, we didn't want to upset him and cause a problem with the pregnacy, and afterwards We simply forgot about it all.”
He backed to the entrance and saw Luna. "Fainted, did they?"
Severus looked at Lily to answer, and she stood  grinning, "Yes. Techinically, we are twins. Born on the same day at the same time. We just weren't born to the same person."
Severus gave her a blank look, "Yes, Lily. Just like that."
Harry grinned, "Kreacher is under protest. He wants Scorp home NOW but knows Scorp needs his education."
My Dear Luna,
Luna looked at them, "It will all become clear, my dears."
He looked around, "Any more surprises today?"
Luna looked at him, "Are they here?"
Draco smiled at him.
"Hopefully, they will have his current address. If not, i may be able to get Neville or Luna to tell me." She thought.
Severus held his side as she spoke.
Harry looked at Draco, "How do you feel about me?"
Harry saw a light enter Draco, startling him.
Working on all my stories as much as I can. I blame Covid!
"Yep!" Scorpius grinned. Lily looked at the building.
"Yep."
"Fidilus Charms" was the response from Harry and Luna.
When Scorpius entered, he saw a man who looked so much like him.
Harry sild a hand over to Draco.
"The truth. I  have always told my son the truth."
Some of the other students noticed, and one of them raised a hand.
She stood and led the man to an open doorway, just visible is a bed.
They instantly appeared at the entrance to Hogsmeade.
Draco looked over the letter, a smile on his face. So his daughter is in his old house. He was glad of it. He knew she could have gone to Griffindor, she was so much like her daddy.
Draco looked at him, "So what's been going on with your life since we last saw each other?"
Sorry to make you wait. Blame Covid for making work insanity.
Severus laughed and she joined in.
“More likely they didn't leave the house much. He only stayed in contact with Blaise and I. Since I had my healer license, I did all his checkups until he went to the hospital.”
She agreed, "You contanct Draco, I'll contact Harry."
“Like I have heard Blaise comment on Harry and Lily.”
Draco nodded, "Same with Lily. I've always told her the truth."
“Well, You never met Scorpius until today, and I've never met Lily. Harry and Draco didn't exactly run in the same circles. I also wasn't sure you were in contact with Draco. He did close himself off from everyone.”
Everyone nodded, accepting this.  Severus smiled.
The two children and adults left through the front doors of Hogwarts.
Severus smiled. "Draco, Scorpius. Come with me."
Dear Draco,
In the other room, Harry and Lily sat facing each other.
Severus smirked, "Draco Malfoy,  it's my pleasure to introduce you to your son, Scorpius  James Malfoy-Potter."
Rent a room at the Leaky Cauldron, Check.
He keyed Draco into the wards relatively quick. "You share blood with Scorpius. Lily is automatically allowed as she is a Potter by blood, even if half of it is Malfoy."
Harry looked at him, "Oh I hope not. Hello, Dragon."
To neither of their surprise, the kids were holding hands as they walked to their class, which was potions with Severus.
Draco clasped it tightly. Severus got up and looked at the time.
The post was read, and an evil grin spread over the man's face.
Severus looked around, "We should get in, children."
Back in England in a small house in Ornery StCatcherpole stood a red-haired man.
Harry smiled, "Same here. If it hadn't been for that bloody war, I think we would have raised those two together."
Draco nodded, "I agree. However, I would rather talk about you and me.. us."
Boom, two more bodies hit the floor. Severus grinned.
She sent a patronus to Severus, which whispered to him Let's reunite a family.
They watched as the twins bonded and spent all their time together, save for sleeping.
He glared around, seeing the mess of a home.
Harry read the letter, and smiled. He missed Luna and her ways. He grabbed parchment and a pen. He hated quills! Quickly, he wrote,
Meanwhile, Severus took Scorpius into the other room.
Filus proceeded to explain how the school worked, the houses and how the children would be sorted. It was fun for Lily to listen to him, but she was insanely curious about the Great Hall. She knew her Papa wanted her in the house that fit her best, but he was privately hoping she would be a Slytherin.
He saw Lily was okay.
"They wanted the same thing, Terminate the pregnancy and marry Astoria. She didn't want the marriage either. I found out she wanted to marry Blaise. I told her to go for it, since I knew Blaise loved her. At least my parents didn't go as far as termination spells and potions."
Lily looked at her fathers, "Yep. I'm glad You and Luna figured it out. Now we just wait."
Draco smiled and hugged his little girl.
Harry looked at Draco, "I'm assuming that's why i couldn't find you either."
He writes back,
The children grew  and on January 1st, their 11th birthdays they received acceptance letters to Hogwarts. Their fathers looked at them, "It's your choice."
The two adults took a deep breath and opened the doors.
Draco looked around, and could see toys all over the place.
Minerva looked at them, “How are the fathers doing?”
The red head saw an owl flying to him, and took the post when the owl landed.
Harry looked at Draco. "I'm surprised Severus and Luna didn't put all this together and talk to each other before now. They must be infected with nargles, to use Luna's phase."
Scorpius walked up to the stool, and the hat immedicately shouted, "Slytherin!"
Draco woke up and looked around.
Your loving
So i'm posting chapters that i have finished. IF i spelled anything wrong, please don't hesitate to let me know. I blame it on overwork.
Severus raised an eyebrow, “Maybe the four of us should sit down so you and Neville can explain.”
Just then, a man stepped into the room.
Good evening, son. All went well. Lily was sorted into my house. She seems to be settling in well. However, something has come up and i need to speak to you. Could you meet me in Hogsmeade at the pub? 8 am if that suits you. It's nothing bad, I just need to speak to you.
Harry nodded. "So.. let's go in and talk."
They all stood up.  Scorpius looked at Draco. "Papa?"
So they each raised their child, taught them magic and everyday things the children could learn in muggle schools.  The children grew up to be happy, well adjusted children. Lily knew her Daddy was out there, but Papa could not find him. Scorpious knew his Papa was out there, but Daddy couldn't find him.  What struck each father as interesting was that each child looked like the parent they had never met. Scorpious had Draco's grey eyes, blond hair and strong jaw. Lily had Harry's black hair, touched with a bit of red. She also had the emerald eyes Draco fell in love with. What struck Draco the most was Lily's love of black dogs and Stags. Harry often claimed he would never understand his son's fascination with snakes and potions.
Severus nodded sagely.
They watched as the Hogwarts platform came into view, and Scorpius saw the half giant, Hagrid.  He ran over and gave the man a hug. Hagrid smiled at the boy, "Alright there, Scorpie?"
"Ok, Luna, myself and the children have to go back to Hogwarts. You tow are reunited. Please, for the love of Albus, don't lose track of each other again!"
Your Godfather
Everyone in the hall started,  two first years with the same last name?
He looked around and saw Draco still passed out cold. "How?"
Draco looked at him, "Back when your daddy was saving the world, my father tried to make me join the opposite side. I didn't want to, which your daddy knew.  People wanted to hurt me because of it."
Draco smiled, "We will have to do the same for you at Malfoy Manor."
"Your parents?"
She looked at the potions in front of her.
Sending them off to bed, he went to his room where a reply from Draco lay on his table in front of the couch. He sat down and read it. Nodding, he went to bed.
He could barely breathe.
"So he won't clean?"
Alberforth pointed to two rooms, side by side. "Savior on the left, Blonde on the right."
Draco hummed, "Wait.. Ginerva is in Azkhaban?"
"Started before he even left for Hogwarts."
Scorpius stared at him, "Lily is my sister?"
Scorpius nodded, "Alright, Hagrid. How's Fang?"
Draco and Harry saw each other, and boom, on the floor again.
Severus rolled his eyes, "Pranks and joke products."
"This is fun."
Love you
Harry looked at him and moved to sit on the couch.
Severus looked confused, "I only knew of Lily. I think Scorpius was concieved the same night and raised by Harry."
To himself, he muttered 'Why did Harry have to get Ginny send to Akazbahn, and why did Hermione leave the country? this is all his fault, he had to get pregnant to Malfoy! He may not have said it to anyone. But anyone can see that kid of his looks like Malfoy!'
Harry was there with apparently their son.
Severus and Luna sat at their respective desks in their classrooms.
Draco smiled at him, "Hello, Love. And why the hell haven't i been able to find you?"
Draco rolled her eyes, "And your friendship with Weasel?"
Draco looked at him, " I looked for him too. Have you met your sister?"
Luna grinned, “I should let Neville know. He's always commented on Draco and Scorpie's similarities.”
At the head table, Minerva McGonagall looked at Servus, "Did Draco have two kids with Harry Potter?"
I'm happy Scorpius is in Slytherin. He takes so much after his papa. The nargles are always around me, you know this. I'm content in their company. I'm curious what the issue is so yes, I will meet you at the pub. You know me too well, my dear friend.
Harry and Draco slowly woke up. So did the children.
Luna looked at him, "If you mean how did we find him? Well, you both sent your kids to Hogwarts, where Severus and I work. We all figured a reunion was in order. If you're talking about him on the floor.. you both fainted like fairy princesses."
Her only thought was If it gets me Harry, it's worth the side effects.
"Are they brother and sister? We've all been wondering since the feast last night."
This set the two into a conversation as the first years crowded around. Lily saw Scorpius and thought he looked like her Papa but dismissed it as a coincidence.  Hagrid called out, "First years, Follow me."
Casting a spell, all her paperwork disappeared from the table.
Luna looked at him, “I don't know. I bet those two are having a good laugh at us about it. Harry must think we are infested with nargles.”
Both children decided to go. And boy, they won't be expecting this!
Draco smiled, "I fell in love that day in Malkin's. It grew over the seven years we were at Hogwarts. Afterward, I focused on Lily. My head was too full of her daddy to even try to date."
Scorpius pouted. Then he looked up, and saw the pub. "Oh Alberforth's place!"
Love,
Draco chuckled.
Luna.
it was the day before everyone was leaving. The seventh years were graduating. Harry looked around and saw all the friends and classmates he knew from the last seven years, except for those who had passed in the war.  He looked around, and saw Draco looking at him. He looked up, then looked back at him. Draco nodded.  After all the testing and packing, the two of them met in the room of requirement. They sat and spoke of their school years, apologized for past hurts and admitted they did make mistakes with each other. Mostly judging based on what they heard, not the person itself.  What followed was a night of passion neither man could forget. The next day, they pretended nothing had happened and went their separate ways.
Filus lead the group inside, toward a stool with a hat on it. He held out a hand and they stopped. He picked up a scroll,  He started naming people in alphabetical order, and the hat would sort them into their houses. When Filus got to the M he called out Malfoy-Potter, Lily. Lily went up to the stool, and the hat called out Slytherin. Scorpius looked confused at her last name. Then Filus did a double take, "Malfoy-Potter, Scorpius"
The kids held the adults hands as the four made their way to the Hog's Head.
The large group of young students followed Hagrid to the boats, where Lily sat in a boat with her friends, and Scorpius sat with a gaggle of redheads.  They introduced themselves as Weasleys. Scorpius looked confused. He knew his uncles Fred and George didn't have kids. He shrugged and watched as they came to an ancient castle. After Hagrid lead everyone to the front doors, A short diminutive man stood there, smiling. "Welcome, First years, to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. My name is Filus. I am your deputy headmaster and charms teacher."
The two nodded in unison, making Severus shake his head. So much like their Daddy.
Luna grinned and nodded.
Luna escorted Lily into the room. Lily saw a man who's face looked so much like hers.
Draco nodded, "What does he know about it?"
Severus looked at her, “And Granger?”
Draco nodded. Scorpius hummed, "Shoulda  thought of that."
Luna took Lily to the door on the left as Severus went to the one on the right.
Severus laughed outright. "It's a good day for them to have headaches, don't you think kids?"
Harry sighed, "Now, we have twins. Granted We each gave birth to one of them. But born the same day at the exact same time? I say they are twins."
Good evening, I hope the nargles are leaving you alone. I write to let you know that your precious boy is in Slytherin with Severus. He says he will watch over Scorpius just like he did you during your years here. I confess i am writing because there is a minor issue I need to speak with you about. Could you please come to the pub in the morning? Let's say 8 am. Knowing your schedule. I miss my first friend.
“True. Harry used a healer from France. He didn't trust anyone here after what the Weasleys put him thorugh.”
