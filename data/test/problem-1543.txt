“Ok.” She was always willing to help him after the past year, and less dramatic. Draco grabbed a broken tile from the ground and transfigured it into a cup, then filled it with spelled it full water. Potter couldn’t hold the cup without it sloshing he was shaking so severely.
Dinner was wonderful and no one talked to him like he had been a Death Eater. Even Professor Sprout talked to him, which hadn’t happened all year. It had never seemed vindictive to Draco, but a conscious effort not to acknowledge his presence.
Harry huffed, gripping his wand a bit more tightly, “Because I re-met you a few days ago and you seem like a nice bloke I’d like to get to know.”
“Oh yes, sorry I burst in on your very busy day. I apologize for taking up any of your precious fucking time. You can stay here with your precious shoes and go fuck yourself.”
“If it helps, all three of us have gone through different times where we’ve been mad at each other. I think it brought us closer together.” Harry elbowed him, “You’ll figure it out.”
“You’re acting like a spoiled child, will I have to take you ever my knee?” Potter asked, waggling his brows.
“As long as he fixes me, I don’t care.” Harry said with a sigh. Hermione was still running her fingers through his hair, it felt wonderful. He wanted to curl up, but he knew that might make him throw up again.
. Then this weird under current of not wanting to be apart from him. Terrified of what Blaise would tell them.
“Tell me what happened Harry.” Draco told him. He gasped again as Winston worked, “Harry look at me.” He tilted his chin, “What happened?”
“Patricia’s hand is still black. It doesn’t seem to be in any pain—or she is very good at hiding it. It moves fine, it’s just numb and black. She used chopsticks today without a problem.”
“No.” Harry said sternly, “I don’t date.” Malfoy looked a little placated after that and Harry let out a breath.
They went through the floo back to Draco’s flat to drop off his bag, then down the steps and into the shop. It was busy on Friday at mid-day. Parkinson and Draco started snipping at each other immediately since one of the part time workers had called in sick and Parkinson was working by herself.
“We both know I wasn’t going to be the smart one in the relationship.” Harry said and Draco smirked, knocking his knee against Potter’s. Harry moved his hand to Draco’s, interlocking their fingers.
Potter snorted, “I had no idea until I was eleven. My family treated me like scum on their shoes. They hardly ever fed me. I would burn food sometimes when I cooked just to get more, otherwise they wouldn’t remember that I do eat three times a day.”
“Take out your wand and say I solemnly swear I am up to no good.” Draco eyed him, but did as he was asked.
“No—right after the war I had trouble sleeping and used it. I didn’t think I was addicted, but Ginny took it away from me. The withdrawal was a nightmare, but apparently I wasn’t ‘that bad’—whatever that means. It fucking sucked. I haven’t touched it since.”
? There she was, Miss Golden Girl herself. He pushed the title aside immediately; he couldn’t call her that anymore. He lost. He needed to assimilate. He gestured to the open compartment and her shoulders relaxed as she sat down. She couldn’t have sat further away from him, but he didn’t take that as an insult. There was a reason why his compartment was open—people were terrified of him. Not without good reason, of course. He had fought for Voldemort. He spent the last three months in Azkaban. No one wanted to be around him. Draco didn’t pay attention to the rustling sounds.
“Keep it in your pants, Potter. We have a date to impress tonight.” Draco replied, straightening his jacket.
“Thank you sir.” Draco said, letting out a breath. He still didn’t feel right. How could Winston say that she had found peace? How did anyone know that? Draco scoffed, grabbing some floo powder before going back home.
Draco opened the bottle of wine as Harry gathered salad ingredients. He apparently made his own dressing he was quite proud of, but didn’t toss it into the salad yet as they had some time before the food was ready.
“We’re having a pity party for Draco. You can only stay if you don’t act like an arse.” Blaise said.
John also gave him a big hug, which was more disconcerting. He was used to the gruff man being emotionally despondent.
“Italian—I could get by in Spanish.” Draco scrunched his nose, “Maybe. My Spanish is a little dicey.”
Potter smiled, “I usually go with my gut. I think you’ll help him as much as he will help you.” Draco nodded, looking back down at his arms.
“Come in.” Harry told the elder auror sternly. Edwards scowled at Blake before walking in after Harry. Harry waved his wand and the door closed behind him. He sat on his chairs again, though he badly wanted to keep the desk between the two of them.
“I was an arse—and I’m sorry. Hermione helped me see that I was being self-righteous. You donate to charities, you do some work pro-bono, you work very hard—so you can buy whatever shoes you want. And even if you didn’t do all that stuff—it’s your money. It’s your life.”
Harry had hardly been home trying to find him. He decided to still take the hour to go to Group with Luna and then go back to work after. Then of course because when it rains it pours, Gary called in sick with the flu so Harry had to take Lily to Group. She didn’t mind, mostly because she loved going over to Luna’s. But it worked out because Harry was going to keep her at Luna’s for the night considering he had no idea what time he was going to get home.
Potter snorted, is piercing green eyes making the pain go away better than any potion, “Well, if anyone knows how to piss me off.”
“I said no—I wanted to be with you. She—she said me telling her about our relationship prompted her to break up with Neville. She felt like she had to in order to be with me.” Harry shook his head, “I didn’t know she had been waiting for me to stop ‘dallying’ for years. I really moved on from her a while ago. I saw her as a friend—and I wouldn’t have lead her on like that for years.” Harry frowned, “She said some cruel things.”
“No. Not once.” She said confidently, “But it is lonely work. You are on your own on this. I work a rotation in sometimes, but there are a lot of hours where you don’t talk to anyone else.” Draco nodded, “And of course, if you’re an absolute idiot you won’t find anything and it will just be a colossal waste of time.”
. If you come to resent your research project—then you won’t be much help.” Harry grinned, “I will respect whatever you choose Draco.”
“Ok fine. I’ll wait a bit—but not too long though, ok? No one likes angst.” That last part hit an unexpected raw emotion.
Draco bobbed his head, he definitely understood that, “I don’t take people at their word. I lived there too long, I learned to question
“Fuck no.” Draco threw a pillow at him as he walked into the closet. Harry’s laughter was cackling as he threw clothes at Draco. It was one of his worn pair of jeans that Draco loved. He pulled them on over his boxers, they were a bit big but not too bad. The t-shirt smelled just like Harry and was softer than any t-shirt Draco had ever owned. He pulled on the grey t-shirt and looked down at the front, “Son of a bitch.”
“Yes. I am ravenous.” Fleur said right as it looked like Bill was going to turn him down. “Vhat? He wants to serve us, we let him.” She plopped down at the table. Draco turned to Harry, who had a small smile on his lips.
him, and nearly everyone in the room told him you’re not worth the grief. And because he’s a fucking idiot, he has decided you are.”
“I know—but—” Potter made a frustrated sound, “I didn’t hear from you and then got a very professionally worded letter. I’m sorry I didn’t understand.”
Harry practically wrapped himself around Draco, like Devil’s Snare. Draco only pretended to struggle a bit before he relaxed.
“Do it Potter, I’m starving.” Draco looked at the oven. Harry laughed, tapping the oven and whispering a spell.
“If McGonagall has her way—which she usually does.” Isaac bit into his pie, groaning a bit, “This is so good—eat.” He encouraged. Draco dipped his fork into his pie, finding he was a bit hungry.
“We’ve lived in the same place three years now—just resigned our lease.” Draco said softly, looking at his hands.
Draco rubbed his hands together, taking a breath like he was going to say something then holding it for a minute, “I’m not trying to be difficult—I just—don’t understand how you changed from our original arrangement of trying to minimize the impact of this bond.”
When his vision started to close and he knew exactly what was about to happen, “Fuck.” He said just before he passed out.
Potter pulled away with a smile on his face, placing a final chaste kiss on Draco’s lips. Draco blushed as Potter scrutinized his face.
“You want him to sit at this table?” Angelina asked, standing up, “He almost killed my best friend! He’s responsible for Bill!”
“Four more hours.” Draco said with a smile, “But I’ll be on call. With the luck we’ve been having, I’m sure I’ll be back in here.”
Harry didn’t question it much, but Draco came out with three books, “This one is the one nearly every witch or wizard gets when they turn thirteen so they are ready.” He puts down in front of Harry a children’s looking book.
. And then when you started seeing him—she really thought now was her time. I wanted to tell Neville, and I wanted to tell Harry.”
“I put extras in the fridge.” Draco grinned brightly, kissing his cheek. Harry had his arm wrapped around Draco’s chair, eating slowly with his left. Draco looked to the wine.
“I know.” Potter’s voice was too calm while Draco was spinning out of control. Every emotion he had bottled up came up to the surface.
“It’s not. It’s only sexual when I’m with you—or with some attractive people I guess. Just gets me in the mood to be randy. Like when I was at the bar and saw Charlie Weasley and came back home and we fucked. But I lied and told you I didn’t find him attractive. You didn’t believe me.”
“Kreacher?” He appeared in an instant, “Can you put my mother’s things in the master bedroom on the third floor.”
Blaise only glared at him, “I couldn’t not say something.” He didn’t apologize, but that wasn’t like Blaise.
.” Draco said with a laugh as Potter pulled off his cloak. Draco shoved him as they walked into the Great Hall. People stared at them as they walked, Draco was instantly aware of the eyes.
“Scotch? Whiskey?” Draco sounded remarkably casual. But Harry knew him a bit better now. He could see the strain. Or perhaps it was Harry sensing him through their bond. He could feel both Draco’s annoyance but also trepidation. It was clear he wanted to make a good impression, for Harry’s sake.
“He has your invisibility cloak.” Malfoy looked impressed, “No wonder why my son hasn’t been caught out after hours.”
hospital that would dispute those facts. The only logical conclusion is that her Father was the abuser.” Draco stared at him while he did it.
Draco cut off the spell, making sure the black goo was contained. Once the nurse nodded to him, he did the spell again. Kapped screamed, but it cut off abruptly as he passed out with the pain of it. The black goo seemed more pitiful this time. Draco saw that Kapped’s hand was nearly clear of black. So he cut off the spell, waited a moment and did it one last time. The last of the black goo seeped from Kapped’s fingertips just as the door opened.
“Rachel, my name is Draco. I’m going to set your arm—ok?” She nodded a bit fast. Draco took his wand over the left arm. The bones weren’t protruding the skin, but it still had a funny angle, “On the count of three—one. Two—” Draco cast the incantation. She gasped and more tears started streaming down her face as she sobbed. Her father pat her back. Draco was getting strange vibes from the father, he was too close to the situation, and he watched Draco too closely.
Draco’s heart nearly stopped, he moved so he was pivoted to face Potter but still holding his hand, “
“Well let me fix you up first.” Draco said, squeezing her hand for a moment before whispering the spells. As Draco was performing spells, he saw a flash of a deep red robe from outside the door, “Rachel?”
“Yes sir.” An auror said with a smile, handing Harry a glass. Draco knew it would be followed. All of the aurors respected Harry too much to say anything.
It was wonderful having Lindsey at Hogwarts for the week. And though he had classes, he spent a lot of his free time with her. She showed Draco how to cook a couple of different things, and of course how to bake. He liked baking a lot more than cooking, but found he enjoyed both.
. It instantly sobered him up as he walked to a cab. He told the driver his address and then they were off.
“Well that’s good, I like the smell of this shampoo.” Draco said, closing his eyes and rinsing the shampoo. They rotated again so Draco could condition his hair and clean his body. It was difficult to do in such a tiny area. And though Harry offered his assistance, Draco thought that was counter productive.
“Harry, Draco, so glad you could make it.” Merlin bless Hermione. She stood up and walked over, elbowing Ron not so subtly. Ron stood up.
“Together!” She said excitedly, moving to grab his arm then stopped herself, “Sorry. I hope you don’t mind—Isaac told me you don’t like to be touched. He only told me cause I’m a bit of a touchy person—you can blame the American in me.” She smiled.
“Look at me and my shoes—and I landed Potter.” Draco pointed out his shoes—very stylish and sensible.
“You’re making me blush.” Draco said with a grin, sipping his drink, “But you’re the best roommate I’ve ever had too.” He kissed her forehead.
“Morning Ted—hello Victoire.” Harry said, his voice scratchy. Victoire sat on a bar stool sipping a cup of coffee looking no worse for the wear. Damn kids and their ability to bounce back so quickly, “When are you two going to tell Bill and Fleur you’re living together?”
“Now, the three boys involved will not be coming back to school for the rest of the year. But some parts of this deliberation are dependent on your input. One, if you’d like to press charges. I will contact the auror office immediately. And if any of them give you grief for your name, I have taught most of the aurors at some point so I am not afraid to call in a few favors.”
I'm on Tumblr as Caedes12. Please come say hello or come chat with me! I write my behind the scenes thoughts.
“It stays the same until I get back.”  Malfoy said with a malicious grin. They walked down the street to a café. It was busy, but not so bad that they couldn’t seat the two of them at a small table in the back by a window.
“That’s why I’m ang—umf!” Potter kissed him back. He kissed like he did everything else. It made Draco’s toes curl at the intensity. Draco took the chance to drag his fingers through Potter’s hair, he had wanted to so many times he wouldn’t let the opportunity pass by. Potter made a small sound of pleasure, moving closer to Draco. The movement made their lips break contact, “This is a terrible idea.”
“Fuck no.” Malfoy shook his head with a grin, “I practically ate nothing but meat for months.” Harry chuckled, smiling at his coffee cup, “My point, I guess, is that if I didn’t talk about Astoria dying, I would be cutting out five years of her life.”
“By my mother’s trial I was already serving my sentence in Azkaban.” Draco told him. Harry held him tightly. Draco couldn’t help his yawn.
Letting him come down a bit, Draco kissed up his stomach, taking his time. There were several scars he wasn’t
Harry flushed bright red, “I just—I don’t know—I don’t want you to think that you’re stuck with me if you don’t—”
“I don’t believe you are of the proper mental capacity to make such a medical decision.” Reison replied, looking a bit haughty. Harry knew exactly what he was doing. He was trying to get Zabini thrown off the case by the medical hospital board, which analyzed cases where the patient wasn’t able to make the decision and either had no family, or the family disagreed on best care.
“You can’t beat yourself up.” Hermione said decidedly, “What’s done is done. Plus, last year you weren’t easy to talk to about
“I was there, and no I didn’t.” Blaise said, “Not that any of this matters—it’s all in the past.” He tried to back away from that ticking bomb, but Pansy seemed intent on exploding.
“I can tell you’re feeling apprehensive, cautious. It’s like you don’t want to hope because it will hurt too much to be let down.”
Draco felt alive as he continued to help heal. Winston knew instantly what had happened, so reiterated that he should be in a bed at the end of seven hours. Draco nodded along, but continued to help.
“I promise I will limit my amount of distracting.” Harry smiled as he pressed his lips against Draco. Draco laughed into the kiss, “Now get some sleep. You need to recover.”
“I heard him yelling at some point—you have to cut him off early or he gets on a roll.” Draco advised.
“I know.” Draco whispered, taking back his glass and having a bolder sip of his whiskey, “I won’t ask you to forgive me. The reasons I have aren’t enough—I stole time from you, and choice. I was terrified and I thought
“My Da—he got tangled up in the law. Went to Azkaban when it still had dementors for six weeks, he straightened up after that!” He said a bit defensively, “There were nice aurors that helped him get a job after he got back, helped my Ma and I when he was gone—it’s why I’m here in the first place.” He blushed.
Draco frowned, “You’re right.” Draco pulled his legs up into himself, “But does he deserve the scrutiny he would be under with me? Assuming he would even want that.”
“This moment? I’m alright.” Draco answered. He pulled his chair a bit away from the fire pit, “Merlin Potter. I didn’t realize you were trying to burn the place down.”
“No. Everyone in Hogsmeade looks like that. And I am wearing casual clothes.” He looked at his slacks and black turtleneck with black cloak.
“Potter.” A stern voice called, Malfoy looked down on him very seriously, “I need you to look at me Potter. Focus.” Harry tried to focus on the form in front of him, eventually looking at his eyes. They were a dark grey, and they were glaring down at him something fierce. Someone was holding his wrist, Harry figured they were taking his pulse. Bright lights moved in front of his eyes, “Focus on the light Potter, follow it.”
.” Harry groaned, “Please don’t stop Draco.” His voice was whining and a little breathless. Draco could hear his hands scrambling to find purchase somewhere. Harry was panting, his body moving as much as he could into Draco’s mouth. Another thrust and Harry was coming into Draco’s throat. Draco gagged a bit as Potter’s cock thrust too deep, but swallowed quickly. Harry’s breath was still quick as Draco kissed up his sex train, pushing up his t-shirt a bit. He kissed below his belly button before crawling up his stomach. Harry kissed him like a deprived man.
“We should get started on dinner—I’m getting hungry.” Potter said, “I have some meat in the fridge.”
“I’ve been better.” Draco said honestly, “It’s—everything is a bit overwhelming. I thought for sure I was going to get expelled.” Isaac let out a breath.
“For your own good is what she argued.” Harry said, “Said the public scrutiny you’d be under isn’t fair. How all my friends would look down on you and you’d never be seen as an equal. Said it would make relations with your parents un-reparable.”
“Why didn’t you?” Isaac asked. Draco couldn’t really come up with a good answer. Isaac waved the marker in his hand, “It’s safe for the skin, do you mind?”
Malfoy did not cover his surprise well, to Harry’s amusement. He choked on the whiskey he was drinking, coughing a bit.
“Yes—I feel great.” Draco assured him, “Well—not great. But well enough for this.” Draco maneuvered Harry so that he was beneath him. After weeks of learning more about Harry’s body, Draco knew how to touch him. Harry’s nipples weren’t that sensitive, but that was alright because there was a spot on his ribs that made him twist. Draco made his way down Harry’s body, mapping out places Harry liked best.
Draco laughed a bit, “Thanks.” He took a bite of his second brownie, and she was right—it did make him feel better.
The two stood up and walked out the door. Potter was sitting on one of the couches, waiting for them. Potter smiled as he came out, standing up. It was strange how quickly the world could melt away when Harry’s green eyes looked into his.
“Want to play a game of chess?” Ron asked Harry, who nodded. They walked over to the chess set, setting it up on the coffee table.
Harry smiled, “Ok.” They kissed again, Draco got to taste the whiskey he had that evening and the undercurrent of maple and musk. He threaded his fingers in Harry’s thick hair.
“Oh yes you do.” Potter said, reaching out to pull him close. Draco managed to dodge one arm, but he only moved closer and launched another attack. Soon Draco was tangled in Potter’s limbs, pressing kisses to every bit of skin he could access. One last kiss was pressed to Draco’s lips before Potter burrowed down into his chest. Draco fell asleep to Potter’s steady breathing.
. And it made him a horrible person. He had never loved anything other than his family, and look where it had gotten him.
“Y-yeah. You helped me fix my arm.” Draco nodded, “I’m going to run some tests, alright? I need you to stay still.”
“There are a few spots that are more sensitive on an Omega.” Draco told him, nearly sounding clinical. His hands dropped to Harry’s waist and Harry couldn’t help but grab his wrist tightly. Draco moved back a bit with a frown, “Did you change your mind—
He talked about how he recognized Harry instantly when he came to the Manor. How he didn’t quite make the decision not to admit to recognizing him until the words were out of his mouth. He hadn’t realized how conflicted he really was about everything until he watched his aunt torture Hermione. He decided he wouldn’t help the war effort anymore. He wouldn’t go against it, but he wouldn’t help either. It wasn’t very brave of him, but it was what he chose.
“It goes without saying—but I just have to say it.” Potter was looking at his mug, “You can’t tell anyone else about this stuff—you can talk to Hermione about it if you want, of course since she was there. Or Ron—not that I think you would do that. Neville I guess too— he knows everything. Just, no one else.”
turned out well. But we’re not done yet. We have to continue down this path, forging past boundaries and reaching across to those we don’t understand. It is understanding tradition and adapting it to fit the current situation. When I was growing up, I had no idea this world existed. To go from being a boy in a cupboard under the stairs to a wizard was a mind-boggling step, I wanted to know everything about the wizarding world. It wasn’t as perfect as what I first thought, but it was still magical—and I do mean that in a figurative sense rather than a literal.” There were some chuckles, “The longer we’re in this world, we forget the awe that we first had when we walked into it. And if we always had it, we don’t understand how overwhelming that first stage is, we get used to the beauty of it all and forget to marvel at it.” Harry smiled, “Let me tell you, refilling alcoholic drinks alone would excite most muggles.” There were chuckles.
Going to group was much easier when he didn’t feel so uneasy around Malfoy anymore. He still wasn’t quite relaxed, but he felt better than he used to. While someone else was talking, Harry volunteered his own thoughts, which was a first. He didn’t share too much, but he felt himself slowly begin to unwind. As soon as he piped up, Malfoy was more talkative as well.
“Oh, Merlin.” Draco groaned, his hips twitching up into Harry’s fist. Harry knew he was leaking all over Draco’s boxer briefs, and he couldn’t help but grind against, “You claiming me with your slick?” Draco asked.
, shirt were done up in the right order. Draco had made him change from the white shirt to an emerald one that was still Draco’s. Draco always liked him in green. It brought out his eyes.
Draco had no clue what Potter was going to talk to him about, but this would have never made the top ten list. He furrowed his brow, trying to think of all the possible reasons Potter could have for apologizing now, “And you’re coming to me three weeks later about this because?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow. Potter flushed angrily, gritting his teeth.
Draco closed his eyes, his throat burning like acid. He knew it, but to hear it confirmed was worse. He opened his eyes and looked down at the sheet.
As soon as the door shut, the weight of grief hit him like a ton of bricks. He couldn’t stand any longer under the bulk of it so he collapsed back into the chair. It had been prickling in the back of his mind like an itch, but now without any distraction it was there again.
There were more positives than negatives, however. Draco sat with friends for every meal, which was a definite improvement over all the other months. He also had Harry in his bed every night. And if that wasn’t a positive, he didn’t know what was. They took their time getting to know each other, getting comfortable. They still hadn’t had penetrative sex, but they had done just about everything else. Multiple times. The only time Draco flinched now when Potter touched him is when he didn’t know it was Potter.
“Mates experience it frequently.” Blaise said thoughtfully, “Most say it diffuses a bit as you get used to the bond.”
“We can find another option.” Ron said. It was a wonderful open door if Harry wanted to step through it.
“If you could enlighten us why you would want to be friends with such a self-absorbed, low life, scum bag—
Draco waved his wand and they came flying over from the opposite counter, “I’m sorry I over reacted.”
He crawled out of bed without thinking and walked into the bathroom. Draco turned on the shower and stepped inside without undressing. He wanted not to feel like this. He wanted to feel
“I’m sure he couldn’t believe his luck.” Draco said acidly, looking down at his hands, “Fuck my feet hurt.” He started to untie his shoes carefully.
“I was just about to go to Green Thumb—want to join me?” Green Thumb was the name of another flower shop. Neville over saw it, though he was rarely in on the day-to-day operations. He used his students’ projects to put into the store if they were good enough.
“No, Charlie Weasley is one of Ron’s older brothers. He lives in Romania and works with dragons. I think he likes them more than people.” He probably thought Harry was just making his way through the Weasley family.
ALSO! I added a little companion piece on my tumblr from Harry's POV. It's brief, but just to entice you :)
“Sounds like it.” Draco said sarcastically, easing Harry down on his bed. The sheets had been changed again and the room cleaned up a bit. It was a small sized room, but it had everything in it Harry wanted out of a room. There was a huge set of windows letting in natural light, it was cozy. Harry thought Malfoy might have a too posh bedroom, but it felt relaxing. He had a natural wood headboard and a fluffy grey comforter that was at the bottom of the bed in case he got cold. The quilt was cream colored, as were the sheets.
“I’m the Golden boy—of course I do.” Harry quipped back with a grin. Draco bit playfully at Harry’s inner thigh.
“Ginny Weasley over here!” The press went nuts, making both Harry and Draco turn around. Ginny had cut her long red hair into a short pixie cut. Draco frowned a bit—it wasn’t that she looked bad, but it was an extreme cut. Harry shook his head.
“Not my first hospital gown.” Draco’s voice was low and teasing, Harry wasn’t quite sure how to handle it.
It took some coordination and planning, but they swapped places. Draco had put his own shampoo and conditioner in the shower, so he grabbed that to wash his hair.
“You’re getting stronger, I can smell it.” Draco told him, his right arm was still wrapped tightly around Harry’s waist, his thumb rubbing in small circles against his rib.
“What are you going to make me?” Harry asked. Draco eyed him up, assessing his caffeine needs. He looked delicious with a towel over his shoulder and sleeves pushed up.
Seventh year was even worse. Torturing first years had been horrible and everyone had looked up to him as a shiny example of how a young Death Eater should act. He talked about challenging the Carrows in subtle ways to protect students, how Snape had encouraged it without explicitly saying so. He talked about how the reality of the Dark Lord in charge was nothing like he had imagined. He wanted a world where wizards were protected, but torturing wizards seemed counter productive. He choked on his words when he was forced to torture Olivander. How seeing Luna in his family dungeon had made him get sick. How he had tried to give them food but had been caught before he got there by his aunt and had been tortured for it.
. He couldn’t quite believe that Potter was there, lying in his bed and letting Draco stroke his cock. It was right in front of him, but he was still having trouble believing it.
Dumbledore’s face turned down, his eyes looked like he just might cry, “I do not know why he does either.”
Draco looked through the amount of alcohol lined up on the counter and shook his head. But he checked all the seals as well since George had just walked through the kitchen. It had been seven weeks since Harry and Draco had moved into Grimmauld Place, and they were finally throwing a House Warming Party.
“Well, she did. And she said that giving me a tape was sort of useless because there wasn’t one thing Ginny could tell me that I didn’t already know. But—she did confirm something that I guessed years ago, but she denied it.” Harry’s heart was pounding. He felt like the world was spinning, but that could have been the alcohol.
“No—probably trying to sell us something.” Sometimes muggles did that—which Draco found obnoxious. How they managed to get through the front door that was supposed to be locked at all times was a mystery to him. Jean walked around the corner to get the door and Draco bit into his sandwich. It was delicious.
“B-but I messed up.” Draco waved his bleeding arm. He couldn’t really see past the tears in his eyes. But his heart hurt from the disappointment in himself. It ached and his stomach flipped over. He just wanted to go under the covers and never come out.
Harry put his head back against the headboard as Draco got him closer. His Adam’s apple bobbed and his breathing increased. It was a bit more difficult to get Harry closer to the edge this time. Draco increased the speed of his hand, flicking his thumb. Harry was nibbling on his lip, his back arched a bit but he immediately corrected it. When his mouth opened, Draco pulled away. Harry let out a few harsh breaths, but his cock bobbed.
“We don’t for a few days yet—but most of our stuff is here.” Draco explained. He walked into the pantry and grabbed crackers.
Draco frowned, “It was one of the worst weeks of my life.” He confessed. It was quiet as Luna stared at him a bit.
“That man is you.” An auror held up the Prophet picture where he had to watch himself kiss a man again.
“I think I’m the opposite. Eh—I dunno actually. Never really thought about what I prefer drunk in a relationship. I like both.”
“Bedroom’s this way.” Harry said when he pulled away. Harry gripped Draco’s hand tightly as they walked into the bedroom.
“We’ve all heard worse of Harry’s love life.” Arthur said, “Molly stopped getting Witch Weekly because of it.”
“I’ll see you again next week.” Patty said with a smile, “I’m going to tell you all about how I talked to Ed about my husband.”
“Bacon is over there—go get my kids will you?” Harry asked. Scorpius grabbed a piece of bacon before running off, “What’s up?”
kisser. And he tasted divine. Harry’s fingers wove through his hair as their tongues fought for dominance. Harry pushed Draco back against the wall, pressing his entire body against Draco’s. Draco let out a slight whimper, which made Harry suddenly aware of himself. He didn’t step back, but he stopped.
“Harry.” Draco whispered his name, “We can’t keep this up.” There was a loud crack of a stone splitting and Harry flushed.
“I will.” Harry nodded, grabbing some floo powder. He was excited to get back to their own nest. George’s apartment smelled lovely, but he wanted to curl up in bed with their smells. He was careful to enunciate Draco’s Flat as he stepped into the floo, feeling the familiar whoosh. He took a deep breath as soon as he entered the flat, centering himself a bit. He didn’t like the floo on a normal day.
“I used to do this too.” She very gently touched one of his self-harm scars. Draco could hardly breathe.
They stayed there for a long time. Until Draco’s fingers got wrinkly, and then even longer. He knew his pajamas were ruined, but he couldn’t bring himself to care.
“It’s your own fault if you haven’t seen a proper fuck before.” Draco said, but his face was as red as Weasley’s hair.
“Well of course she didn’t want to open up to you! Fucking Savior of the Wizarding World. How was she supposed to open up to that? What do you know of abuse? Some bullshit story of living in a cupboard—
“It’s just sensitive—like when you’ve had to pee really bad for a long time and it sort of hurts to go at first.” Harry explained.
Draco couldn’t quite believe his eyes. St. Mungo's Board had approved of his study on werewolves. The board had also approved him keeping hours on the Dark Arts floor. It was perfect. It was everything he had ever wanted. He got a private office off the beaten path, which he was sure was on purpose considering what he was studying but he was not going to complain. He had written a long letter to Aiden, asking for his help. It would all be for nothing if he couldn’t get any werewolves to join the study. Draco detailed all the risks, asking if he knew any friends that were willing to participate as well. If it didn’t work, the Ministry had a registry that Draco could go through but he didn’t want to have to break trust before even meeting a person.
“Draco?” Luna came up to him Monday as he walked to class. She thrust a small charm into his hands. It was a necklace with a cork from a butter beer on the end.
“Absolutely not.” Potter took another bite, “It’s delicious. But obviously in a room full of desserts, I’d grab the—
Draco started fucking him for all he was worth. Watching Potter positively melt beneath him was a privilege. His hair was all over the place and he had started to glisten with sweat. His eyes were sort of glazed over as Draco continued to thrust. Draco bent both legs over Potter, bending him over to hit the sweet spot inside of him.
“Let me put on pajamas.” Potter said, kissing him again before slipping away from him. Potter stripped into his boxers and grabbed his worn-out pajama bottoms. He got back into bed without a shirt. Draco got under the covers and pulled Harry close. The kiss was languid, but fire heated in Draco’s abdomen all the same, “I have a thought.”
“Yes. The brown bag protected it.” Harry told him, placing it on a small table, “Is the wine safe?” Draco was holding a bag with two bottles of wine in it. He placed it down next to the grocery bag.
Draco.” Harry’s green eyes met his and went through him like lightening. Draco’s body curled in pleasure.
Malfoy looked confused, like he wasn’t sure what just happened. Harry grabbed his auror robes, which had been pulled off of him at some point, and walked down the steps.
Harry nodded, “Ok.” He stepped closer into Draco’s chest, tilting his head up to be kissed. Draco easily indulged. He tasted like cannoli.
“He’s alive.” She said. The air left Draco’s lungs and he nearly collapsed. Viktor held him upright, standing up next to him, “He did very well during the procedure. There were a few moments that were touch and go, but he has pulled through. The next twenty-four hours will be critical, but we expect a recovery.” Draco felt like he was going to vomit from the relief, “I would suggest you all go home, get some rest and freshen up so that when he wakes up.”
Draco suddenly understood, “Not feel guilty anymore. I got it. Saint Potter can’t bear to let one person not be an adoring
“I don’t think so—I haven’t looked. But I think I would have known by now. Winston and Sherry were the only other two in the room—and they wouldn’t say anything.”
Victoire laughed, it chimed easily on his ears as she was part Veela. Harry had seen men fall at her feet constantly, though Teddy fell at her feet without the charms, “That would be my recommendation.”
“And I don’t want yours.” Draco ground his teeth, “The only reason I kept the money is because Blaise convinced me to. I was going to send it back—but he told me to keep it. That I deserved
“He graduated top of his class as a Healer and took a specialty in ABO dynamics. They say he is a prodigy to the field and completely reinventing it.” Hermione said.
.” Draco growled into his neck before releasing into him. Harry was coming down off his high, realizing they had just fucked on the counter in the middle of Draco’s store. Before he had time to think about it too much, Draco kissed him again.
Pain radiated throughout his body and he couldn’t move, “So close.” He whispered to himself. So close to finishing school. He didn’t want it to end like this.
“Hey.” Potter’s voice felt like the warm blanket he needed. Harry didn’t ask questions as he sat down next to Draco. He rubbed Draco’s back as Draco continued to draw up his arms. It was quiet, both of them in their own thoughts as they just sat next to each other. Draco felt Harry’s warmth radiating off his body and it felt wonderful just to sit next to someone without any words.
Draco swallowed; fuck if he could just spit it out. Harry already knew anyway. He was only telling Meredith for the first time, and it wasn’t like she hadn’t heard shit like this before. But it still clung to him like tar, weighed him down like he didn’t want to speak. He knew it was better to say his story, to get rid of the weight. He took a sip of tea, just enough to wet his lips, “It was the last Saturday at the end of January—the thirty first. I went to the bathroom. I think I was crying when I got into the tub, but I don’t really remember. I was definitely crying when I had my wand out. I used two
Some throwbacks came into the mix. He had a particularly affinity for the Backstreet Boys. It was one of the first albums he bought while in Hogwarts. He had definitely wanted to be fucked by at least one of them while in school. He loved boy bands in general, never listened to one he didn’t like. But his favorite artist was definitely Britany Spears. He didn’t know if it was because they were both blondes, bonded with being misunderstood, or if he would definitely be an asshole if Potter brought him the diamond from the Titanic. He’d reward him, of course, but only after being a dick.
“My Dad did a horrible thing because I was kidnapped. He feels guilty about it all the time.” She told him, her large eyes staring up at him, “Voldemort had your family from the beginning.”
Draco thought about how much he loved Harry, how much this tattoo meant to him. Draco may have abandonment issues, but he
Harry’s body was tingling with anticipation as he kissed lower. Harry moved Draco’s leg wider, his hands splaying on his inner thighs. Harry kissed the junction between Draco’s thigh and groin, sucking a bit. Draco let out a tiny gasp that was music to Harry’s ears.
Harry found him a few hours later hidden behind books. He had parchment spread out everywhere, taking notes.
“I’m sorry.” He started apologizing, “it’s—touch is—don’t.” He couldn’t quite get the words out; the panic closed his throat before he could.
“Just a little tighter.” Draco said breathlessly. Potter adjusted his grip and Draco moaned, “Yes—just like that—
Ron cleaned him up and put a new diaper on him, “You’re much better at this than Rose.” Rose was nearly a year old.
“I’m a Malfoy. We never get pissed.” He said with a sneer, but he dipped his head and pressed a kiss against Potter’s lips.
“Yes, I remember you spending days in the hospital wing after the hippogriff attack.” Harry didn’t know if he went too far as his top came off. He was surprised when Draco barked a laugh.
“No—and yes.” Draco sat by his feet, “I don’t feel the same as I did. I understand that I’m not a better person than a muggle because I have magic. But I still feel like I could be better than them—just like any half-blood or muggle born. I don’t think I’m better than Granger—or you for that matter. I mean, I might be better in some areas than others. And I could be better than a muggle—but definitely not at driving because I suck at that.” He smiled a bit disparagingly, rubbing his pant leg, “I think they’re good muggles and bad muggles, just like
That night he stood outside, staring out at the stars. He was drinking a butterbeer, remembering all the times the two of them had snuck outside while the family was home. The first time she had given him a hand job was underneath one of the willow trees. Grieving was funny like that. You wanted to remember all the loving and romantic moments, but sometimes all you could think of was the ridiculous ones, the angry moments and the sexy ones. But all those moments made up Ginny, and he didn’t want to forget them.
“That sounds perfect.” Potter answered. Warmth spread through Draco, enough where even his toes felt warm against the floor. The way Potter was looking at him, he never wanted to forget this feeling.
“No, I’m not. Actually I hook up with women more than men. I think she was just feeling a bit insecure after the break up.” Harry admitted, rubbing the back of his neck.
Draco kissed up his neck, reaching with his other hand for the bedside table. He placed a kiss on Harry’s lips before pulling out. Harry cringed at the amount of liquid he felt leave him. A strong cleaning charm was cast over both of them, and Harry was grateful for it. It didn’t clean up as well as doing it by hand, but it was certainly enough so that Draco didn’t have to clean Harry off.
Draco snorted, “No.” He put Harry’s pants on the settee and walked over to his speakers to press play. Classical music came on, “I like something on in the background so it’s not silent.” Draco confessed before crawling back into bed. Harry’s cock was jutting up to his stomach. So eager, but he had no idea what was in store for him.
. He answered nearly every time—except for the one time when Luna had interviewed him for an exclusive in the Quibbler. He was grateful he never presented because it was just one more
.” Harry didn’t want to resort to begging. His mind felt a bit like scrambled eggs, but he still was holding on enough.
“I have no doubt you would run it very well Malfoy.” Potter said with a roll of his eyes, “You are a hard worker. But sometimes money leads to—expectation. And that leads to people
“Shouldn’t you?” Potter called, “Come on through.” Draco stepped through the flames and into the room, stumbling as he did so. He caught it pretty quick, but Potter still had a smile on his face, “How pissed are you?”
Sadness gripped Harry, how could he not have noticed? He reached out and squeezed Lily’s hand, “I’m trying.”
“I’m sort of glad it wasn’t great for you either.” Harry said with a sigh, leaning back a bit, “Sorry if that makes me terrible.”
Draco took a quick shower, and had just enough time to work himself into a bit of a tizzy. He took out his pens and drew a few miscellaneous things on his arm before pulling on his cloak and walking down to meet Lindsey.
“I want him to know it was me. He never took me seriously, I just—I want him to know it was me.” Draco said, turning back to Harry. Weasley had his arm wrapped around Hermione, they both looked concerned. But Harry had his war face on. Draco recognized the stiff jaw and the hard eyes. He forgot just how brilliant Harry looked like this, or maybe he just never saw it as beautiful before. It’s the face Draco saw when he fought Voldemort in the Great Hall or when he yelled at Umbridge.
“Harry!” Hermione greeted him with a smile, “Ron! Harry’s in the floo.” Soon Ron’s head was next to Hermione’s.
“After Fred’s death, I had a bit of a rough time.” George started, and Harry was quiet. George hardly ever spoke of it, “Anytime I passed a mirror—I got upset.” Harry knew enough to think that George was underplaying how upset he got, “So I blocked them all out. I worked in the shop and covered all the mirrors. Because if I didn’t look at myself, it wouldn’t hurt. It worked for a while, but then it got more difficult when I did see myself. If I caught my reflection in a window or water. I hardly ever left places that I knew were
“Your office probably looks very Gryffindor.” Draco said with a pout, sitting closer to Harry than was strictly necessary on the couch.
Potter turned red and still didn’t look up, “It’s a bit different than expected.” He managed to whisper. Draco could barely hear his words because he said them so quietly.
“It is the base for the next several weeks as we transfigure our bodies to have other aquatic features, so if either of you struggle, please come to extra office hours.”
Draco set everything up on two separate plates. Two open face sandwiches with fried dippy eggs, cheese, avocado and fresh salsa, salt and cracked pepper. He put the bacon on the side of each. He put the plates down at the table, sitting in the one remaining chair next to Harry. Harry slid over his sandwich, but he wasn’t sure he was hungry anymore.
“Well—three bottles were diluted—one had a few drops of pure serum. So I’m going to be spilling secrets for another hour and a half at least.”
.” His name was groaned into his neck. The acknowledgment of himself made him come with just the thrusts and the friction of the mattress on his cock. Draco’s thrusts slowed down.
More tears fell down his face, but he didn’t wipe them away this time. He tried to pull his legs tighter again, still staring out the window.
“Twelve eleven.” Draco was running off before she had finished. Dark Arts floor. Perfect. He ran to the elevator, hitting the button a million times before it opened. He jumped in and hit the right floor, slamming the button a hundred times again. The doors opened and he ran down the hall to the right room.
His mental state had gotten better by Christmas, but that is when everything went horribly again. His father, as was arranged at his sentence, could come home for three days. Christmas Eve dinner, his father and mother told Draco he would get married to Astoria. Draco refused and was kicked out of the Manor that same evening. He went over to Blaise’s house and had a very Merry Christmas despite everything.
“I love you Albus.” Harry said, his voice thick with emotion, “I am proud of you. You are unfailingly kind, and I am glad you have a friend like Scorpius who appreciates you. I don’t care that you’re in Slytherin. I know you think I do, but I am proud of you for going into that house. Slytherin house is better for it, just as any house would have been to take you in.”
She shook her head, “They definitely use magic to make that—the way it’s so delicate at the edge like that—you can’t get that in an oven. They probably baked it with their wands.” The pastry had a design popping out of it in the shape of a strawberry. The leaves fluttered a bit. He took her hand and squeezed it gently.
“I’m here.” Blaise walked around the corner. It was always such a shame Blaise was straight, he was delicious looking. Not that Draco really saw Blaise like that—he just knew an attractive man when he saw one.
pin Draco to the floor quickly. Draco retaliated by trying to buck him off. There were a few more elbows thrown in, shoves back and forth and a few grunts of pain. Again Potter managed to pin him down but Draco nailed a solid hit to his ribs.
Harry’s heart fluttered, and he really didn’t want to cry in front of Zabini. He didn’t want to admit to a new symptom. He wanted this to stop.
. Got it? And the bull shit about friends—half our friends are now the same anyway. And yes, there has been a bit of a ‘getting used to us’ curve, but this is only the beginning. And my relationship with my parents was ruined four years ago when they kicked me out of the will. My parents might think otherwise, but I certainly do not. Ok?”
Harry looked down at his tea cup and ate a bite of his scone, “I can’t believe we have not had an argument in over ten minutes.”
If anything, being married to Draco had improved his dancing. Harry was guided along the dance floor.
Draco got more confused when they walked up to an old jar. It was definitely a portkey, “Where are we going?” Draco asked.
“I do.” Draco looked up at her, “And I’m not feeling that way. I feel valued—so many people are here even now. Getting them to bloody well leave me alone is a problem.” He couldn’t resist a bit of a look at Harry. He knew Harry had a rotation of who was supposed to be glued to Draco at all times.
“Open up.” Harry said, and Lily opened her mouth, “I think they’re all still there.” Lily giggled, taking a bite of lasagna. They ate in silence for a bit, “Luna talked to me you know? She said you were worried.”
“Strip to your pants and sit there until I tell you to.” Draco instructed. Harry’s green eyes sparkled as he nodded, pulling off his shirt. Draco loved watching Harry’s shoulder muscles—they were so strong and carved so nicely. He shook his head, not wanting to get distracted. He pulled down the covers of the bed and then pulled out his box of toys. Some of the toys were the ones Harry and Draco bought together. They had used some of them, but Draco had a few more in mind for today. Draco carefully laid each toy out on the settee, but didn’t let Harry see them. And he knew the man was trying to sneak a peak. The toy Draco made obvious were the cuffs.
Harry pressed a kiss on Draco’s lips before sitting up. He looked stunning sprawled out on his bed, his lips swollen and his cock hard. Harry grabbed at Draco’s belt, looking up to him. Draco nodded, so Harry unclasped the belt and pulled off his slacks.
He looked over at the clock and it was a little past three a.m. before he took another bite of lasagna.
It was difficult for Draco to hear Potter’s side of sixth year. It was little comfort knowing Potter had a difficult year as well. He explained horcruxes, how the diary he found second year had been one. He talked about Dumbledore. It was hard to hear the reverence in his tone, but Draco listened. It was even more difficult to listen to what happened that night. How Potter had been there the entire time.
chocolate.” Draco caught the secret stash of chocolate that flew out from a secret compartment. He opened the box and showed it to her, “You can pick two.” Her eyes lit up with excitement. She stared at the box for a moment before picking one that was heart shaped and another that was a milk chocolate square, “Is she allergic to anything?” Draco asked.
“I pulled out the expensive bubbles for you, I’ll have you know.” Harry’s voice sounded heavy, like he had almost fallen asleep.
Draco scrunched his nose before stomping off toward Transfiguration, “I don’t need you to protect me.”
“You fight like a fucking muggle you mudblood bitch.” Pansy said. Draco had both of her hands clutched in his, trying to keep them from hitting his face. She moved down and smashed her head against his nose. Pain exploded through his face, the pinching pain made his eyes water. He could hardly think but he kept trying to keep her away from him and her wand.
“Doing well. Blaise went into business with Neville Longbottom—and their business has taken off. Blaise has more than he knows what to do with. Theo has been doing a bunch of odd things—some business and some others. But he does well for himself too.”
“You know you’re the most important thing on the list of things I am excited to come home for—right?” Harry asked.
” Harry cried out, his tone practically on the verge of panic. He wanted Draco inside of him, moving. Not pulling out. The next thrust was brutal, to remind Harry that he wasn’t going anywhere. Harry twisted under the too sensitive and painful pleasure; he delighted in it. But at the same time he wanted harder and
“I—I planned it.” Draco confessed, his entire body was shaking, “At Blaise’s house—I was drunk and there was no forethought. I just did it. So I thought—I thought it didn’t matter. But when I found out about—about how my parents didn’t care. I thought—everything I did—the
Draco made an exasperated sound before laughing. His head was thrown back against the leather couch, his Adam’s apple bobbed. Harry laughed with him, “And people call
“You don’t want to see.” His mother whispered like she could read his thoughts as she gathered him close to her, kissing his forehead, “You don’t want to see him like that.”
“What happens then?” Harry thought his legs looked way more ridiculous than usual. The weight loss made them look like chicken legs. How had he not noticed how ridiculous he looked?
Draco let out a breath, “He does.” He frowned a bit, trying to find words that wouldn’t offend Potter, “It’s nice, for me, not to have them know what it was like. I told Lindsey what I did—what I believed in—she still wanted to spend the day with me. It’s like because she didn’t see it, it’s not as bad.”
“Coming.” Draco said, smirking a bit as he reached down and grabbed his pants and rummaged around Harry’s drawer for a t-shirt that didn’t have the word Gryffindor on it. He finally grabbed an auror t-shirt and walked out into the main room. Harry and Ron looked like they were in the middle of an intense conversation. Harry had this ridiculous look on his face.
“Did you get out today?” She asked, looking at him. She must have been watching him the entire time behind her hair. It wasn’t fair it was so bushy to conceal her actions, “Of Azkaban.” She clarified when he didn’t say anything.
“Harry’s party. You reminded me of your mum at parties—when we used to go. She just always made sure everyone was having a good time—but always made sure Lucius was happy first. Lucius was a prick about it—but still.” Greg said with a shrug.
“Sorry.” Harry said, blinking a bit to try to wake himself up as he pulled back, “I didn’t mean to—”
Harry laughed, kissing parts of Draco’s face that weren’t covered by his fingers, “We’re telling each other about our problems now—right? That’s what we’ve been talking with Meredith. And now if Lucius comes after me, I’ll know to run away.”
“Good—you have been playing well.” Draco said, she was a chaser for the Harpies. Draco had looked up a few of her stats before he came just in case.
It was about midday, Draco was on the late shift so he was still at home. He was sitting on the couch, flipping through some Healer notes when there was a loud banging at the door. He jumped, grabbing his wand.
“Yeah—when I can move again.” Harry’s grin was nearly feral—Slytherin like—with pride. Draco snorted, “Don’t let it go to your head.”
Ron was quiet for a moment, “It still matters. It is part of who you are.” Harry was shaking with relief and emotion. Ron clapped his arm on his shoulder, “I am sorry I made you feel like you couldn’t tell me. I’m your best mate, and if you couldn’t tell me I’m sure keeping this secret weighed on you.”
Draco relaxed, “Yeah. Growing up there was great. My parents were strict about bed times and tutoring, but otherwise I could really do whatever I wanted. I always had the latest brooms, or the newest toys. I never wanted for anything.”
“Talk to me.” Harry said, pushing back Draco’s hair, “We don’t have to have sex if you’re not ready, we can scale back. Don’t feel like you have to—
“Harry, now is probably a good time to tell him.” Meredith urged. Draco scowled and turned to Harry.
.” Harry replied vehemently. Ron and Hermione started yelling at Blaise. Harry just wanted his wand. He wanted to hex himself for thinking Zabini would help him. He couldn’t believe
“Yeah—nearly got me thrown back in Azkaban. Hermione defended me, so McGonagall happened to lose the letter telling the aurors I broke my parole. I was assured she would not lose the letter again. After everything Hermione did for me, I started calling her Hermione.”
Harry let out a sigh, his stomach feeling a bit wonky again so he leaned back, “I like helping people. Sometimes that means I get money for it. I try to give back.”
It had been a bit of a lonely year, not that it surprised Draco at all. Perhaps that was why he spent so much time watching Potter in the first place. None of Draco’s friends had come back for eighth year. But then again, none of his friends were talking to Draco. They had to distance themselves from the convicted Death Eater. Self-preservation was a thing Draco understood. They also didn’t come back to eighth year because they would be fine with their family money and the limited NEWT education they had gotten the year before. Draco knew for sure now that he was in classes and up to his ears in homework that the year before barely had learning, unless perfecting the
“You haven’t been around.” Draco pointed out before taking a bite of his pancakes. They were delicious.
Draco sobbed into Harry’s shoulder as Harry hauled him close, “That’s different, you were having a nightmare.”
“Guilt mostly.” Draco wasn’t expecting that honest of an answer, and it didn’t look like Potter had expected it either, “Always more people in danger.”
Harry couldn’t help but wrap both arms tightly around Lily. He tried not to let tears come to his eyes, but he couldn’t quite help it.
“Yeah. I started researching up on it today. I’m only halfway through the first book but it’s mostly just garbage. One out of fifteen sentences is useful, so I’ve been transcribing—and mostly ripping out pages to be honest.”
Draco let out a small breath, “We’re recovering. She apologized, and I accepted it. I said I forgave her and I do—but I’m working on implementing it.”
That had Weasley breaking out into a large grin, “She is too good for me.” He turned to Harry, “You really think she’ll say yes?”
“Sit.” Rosmerta ordered. Draco sat down gingerly on a leather chair. He heard a clink of glasses. She plopped down two small low-ball glasses and filled them both generously with whiskey, then slid him a cup. He took it. When she took a sip, he pressed the glass to his lips and took his own small sip. It burned on the way down and tasted disgusting. He wrinkled his nose, setting the glass down.
“Mr. Potter! Of—of course!” He stuttered. Potter laid down a few galleons and paid for everything. The three left in silence, the tension strong in Draco’s shoulders as he pushed through the door first.
It won't always be hunky dory, but I love the fluff for now. I might post again before the week is out. I haven't decided yet.
The thirtieth celebration of the end of the second-wizarding war was a massive success. There were drinks and food everywhere, and nearly everyone was having a good time. Harry had made sure to make it a nice enough event without having too many speeches. No one liked sitting and listening to too many speeches. When Harry made it up on stage as the last of the speeches, the entire room stood up and clapped. He blushed a bit with a smile on his face, rather used to the attention by this point. He still didn’t
“Don’t be an arse George. I’ve lived with Draco for three years.” Hermione said as she shrugged off her jacket, hanging it up on a hook under the table.
“My Mum is one, it’s a muggle thing. They have alarms if their house catches on fire, then it dispatches fire trucks with fire fighters. They help put the fire out, since muggles can’t do it with a wand.”
Draco stared out a bit at the twenty or so students staring back at him, not quite believing what he was hearing, “I-I didn’t know.”
“You can fuck me with your fingers later.” Potter said, using the headboard as leverage to impale himself, “I want your cock.”
Aiden scrunched his nose but nodded, “There’s a lot of stuff they don’t write about in books about werewolves.” He looked to the werewolf books Draco had stacked up neatly on his desk.
Harry grit his teeth, “There is a galleon prize for giving information, I will have the auror office send it over.”
“Your money is no good here.” The cashier said sternly. Draco felt his stomach drop before his face went white. It felt like he might vomit.
after everything. I just don’t know where I fit in.” Albus admitted, his face turned bright red. Harry pulled his son to his chest before he had the chance to wiggle away.
“We’re both different than our Dads.” Albus said, he blushed a bit. Harry looked down for a moment, not sure what to say, “I—I just mean, I don’t know.” Albus huffed, “You don’t know what it’s like at school. Everyone talks about you all the time like they know you.”
“I can’t do it.” Draco didn’t realize he was crying, “Harry please.” A dementor sucked on Harry, using what precious strength he had. Draco looked for Harry’s wand—his hands were covering with blood. It was everywhere—there was so much blood. Draco tried not to think about it, tried to think like a Healer instead of a bystander. Draco put Harry’s wand in his hand.
“I hate it when he says that.” Harry grumbled to Draco before he stepped onto the stage. It was an instant transformation as he stood up taller and looked confident. Harry’s grin was large as he waved at the crowd that was clapping—a few whistles from the Weasley’s. Draco grinned, clapping as Kingsley moved to stand next to him.
“Hm,” Harry rubbed his back, “I see you owning your own shop, eventually. It’d be a small place in Diagon with a great reputation for fine jewelry and protection. But it will have a mellow vibe, so everyone feels welcome. I’ll eventually settle down where I’m not traveling as much, maybe taking a job with the ministry. We’ll have a bunch of kids that love Quidditch too much and are entirely too competitive.” Draco snorted at that.
“I’ll tell you if I’m uncomfortable. I promise.” Harry said. He looked so fucking eager staring up at him, his cock fully hard beneath his boxers. Draco smiled at him, taking off his shoes and socks. Harry was watching his every movement as he unbuckled his belt and then opened his slacks. Draco walked back into the closet and put everything away before coming back out.
“I was surprised with your line of work.” Harry’s first instinct was to scowl, of course Malfoy was surprised. But then of course—no one had really expected him to be a solicitor. Everyone thought he was an action first type of person, going to be an auror. He disappointed many people with his line of work, but he couldn’t regret it.
“Our Lord and savior.” Blaise greeted when he walked into the examination room. Harry and Draco went to his office. The office was empty except for some staff—apparently the remaining staff that Blaise trusted implicitly. Harry still didn’t want anything leaking to the press.
“Yes. I don’t—I haven’t really talked to anyone my age that lost their significant other.” Harry admitted.
Draco felt like he did want those fuckers to pay for what they did to him. His answer to call the aurors was on the tip of his tongue when he thought about the backlash.
A big thank you for all the love I've gotten on this story. I wanted to write a story about sexual assault that was real to me. It's been as difficult for me to write as it has been cathartic. Dealing with one year mark, dealing with telling family, is all very real to me. And I do appreciate people taking the time to comment and saying it's real for them too. It sounds a bit weird to thank people for sharing that, but since this story has aspects very much a part of my life, it means so much more to have someone say that they appreciate my take.
“Not too strong. With her size and stature, that wouldn’t be recommended. This pain med is like the one you can buy in any apothecary— it’s just a bit more concentrated.” Draco told him, handing him the script. Like he would give an eight year old something she could get high off of? Was this guy nuts? The father grunted.
“I’m ok.” Draco told Harry, wanting to pull himself out of bed and go take a shower. He would wait until Harry fell back asleep so he wouldn’t know. A light touch on his arm made him flinch.
“No! You don’t get to beat yourself up!” Lily said, tears rolling down her cheeks. Harry hugged his daughter tightly.
“You haven’t thrown up since potions were in the IV.” Draco said. George slid a bowl full of nuts and another bowl of chips over to them. Harry grabbed them eagerly, even though he just ate.
“Me too.” Draco kissed Harry’s lips, lingering for a bit too long and kissing him once more before pulling back. He ran his fingers through Harry’s hair, messing it up more than it already was, “Always.”
. Draco pulled on his legs as tightly as he could, not quite believing it was happening. The knife seemed to tip as his orgasm burned it’s way through him in the most exquisite pleasure. He was vaguely aware of Harry’s thrusts becoming uneven as Draco continued to come in long ropes all over his stomach. He came so hard Draco was pretty sure there was semen on his shoulder.
“You’re welcome.” Draco replied, pulling out his script pad, “I am giving you a prescription for some pain potions.”
“I’m sorry—I didn’t think it through.” Isaac’s cadence was slow, it calmed Draco down instantly. He relaxed a bit, leaning back against the wall.
Draco frowned, “No—we haven’t gotten that far yet.” He snapped then let out a breath, trying to get rid of his anger.
Draco couldn’t help his grin as Blaise handed him a glass of fire whiskey, “We had a talk this weekend, and we’re going to give it a serious shot.”
Albus laughed, gripping onto Harry a bit tighter before letting go. He wiped away a few errant tears.
Draco felt like there was a fire under his skin, “Use that word again, and you will be out of this flat. Do you understand?”
“You just wanted a chance to get to be the big spoon.” Draco said. Harry kissed behind his ear, but Draco could feel the smile on his lips.
“I am fucking you with my fingers right now.” Potter told him. Draco made an exasperated sound, rocking back and forth on Potter’s fingers, “Is this what you want?”
“Then of course over break I was thrown out of my parents house for not marrying Astoria and I went to Blaise’s. It was a few days later when I got a letter from Father with a lump sum and a declaration that I was thrown out of the will and vaults that I tried to kill myself the first time.” It got easier to tell the story every time he said it, but it was never easy. He was shaking a bit but he didn’t want to put his mug of tea down.
“Jump off me like I’m on fire.” Draco said with a roll of his eyes, finally kissing him back. Harry reached between them, grasping Draco’s cock in his hand. Draco grunted as Harry ran his hand up his length, his thumb over the top.
“I’ll meet with him.” Harry said, and Ron spluttered, “With my luck he won’t be able to get in the door.”
“You’re ok.” Blaise said, moving a bit closer. Harry tensed, but then let out a slow breath as he tried to relax again.
for both teams!” Draco said with a laugh. Draco wouldn’t stop giggling until Harry kissed him quiet. They had been sitting on the couch, flipping through the Sunday paper. Harry had thrown on a pair of jeans and a t-shirt and Draco was in his “casual” khakis and a stolen t-shirt from Harry. Harry climbed into Draco’s lap, kissing him quiet. Draco’s strong arms wrapped around his back, his one hand slipping up underneath his t-shirt and onto his lower back.
. Draco wasn’t sure what he was eating half the time, but he knew he liked it. And the naan, and the rice.
“Or I can go with you.” Potter offered. Draco frowned, looking down at the ground. He didn’t really want to ruin Lindsey’s fun, but he also didn’t want Potter’s charity, “Come on, I swear I’m not bad company.”
“You’re my boyfriend. I’m not taking anyone else.” Harry said soundly. Draco smiled fleetingly. His boyfriend was brave but stupid, and in this instance Draco was grateful for it.
“I was remembering the time I broke this mug.” He told his daughter, who smiled brightly up at him, “Your mother was furious with me.”
“Harry!” Draco called loudly to him. Draco found out the hard way one time not to try to shake Harry awake. He had gotten punched in the jaw. Draco found yelling out to him worked best—helped him keep his distance, “HARRY!” Draco yelled for the fifth time. Harry woke up, his green eyes a bit crazed for a second.
“I am sorry for how I treated you.” Draco countered, “I didn’t—I panicked and I lashed out at you. I’m not saying it’s a good excuse, but it’s the only one I have.”
. Draco’s entire body felt on fire from Potter’s praise, and it just kept pouring out of him. Draco drank up every bit of it, put every ounce he had into fucking Harry’s thighs. He reached around and pulled Harry’s cock, and only then did the praise cease as he came silently. Draco wasn’t too far behind, his hips thrusting of their own accord.
“WHAT?” Harry cried out, looking to him, “It’s not that—Christ—I mean—I do want to be with you but—er—”
She frowned but nodded, looking away from Draco. Draco looked to Harry who squeezed his hand. He was glad Harry was here, but he was also glad Harry was sitting back.
.” His father whispered, holding the rope a bit tighter. His hands were visibly shaking as he looked over the edge, “I can’t—I won’t survive it again.”
“She used to leave her shoes all over the place, it drove me nuts. I’d trip over them all the time and yell at her about it when I came home in the middle of the night on a stake out. But now I miss it—and I don’t at all. It is so
That made Draco back down slightly. Dermtree had almost killed Patricia with his incompetence. Draco’s throat hurt from yelling. Dermtree had a gaggle of people around him, cooing to him that Draco was the big bad wolf.
Draco was excited when more food was set out. He hadn’t wanted anything, but now that it was in front of him, he wanted to eat all of it. Chicken fingers were the most amazing drunk food, in Draco’s opinion. He scarfed up everything he could get his hands on, which was difficult with three other equally as drunk people.
It was good for Draco to help Potter. He suddenly realized how little other people were judging him when he had his own panic attacks. Draco didn’t feel any sort of judgment toward Potter, only empathy and a desire to help, though he wasn’t quite sure what to do. He realized the uneasiness he saw in people before wasn’t judgment, it was caution. They didn’t know how handle the situation, though they wanted to help.
They sat for hours. Daylight turned into night. Molly brought in food, but it went mostly untouched. Draco must have fallen asleep, because next he knew Viktor was nudging him awake. Tension filled Draco’s gut as a Healer walked into the room; he stood on his feet instantly. She looked exhausted, and Draco wondered if her tightly drawn lips were ready to give bad news.
The author, Brigette, went more into detail about the heat she felt sometimes curling beneath her skin. Harry closed his eyes, breathing deep like he did with occlumency. He cleared his mind, listening to his body. The heat was there, brewing deep within him. He knew it was much stronger than what it was before Draco, but he was also a bit frightened of it. This heat is what he was terrified would overwhelm him completely. He went to the bit of the book that explained heat. Draco was right that it was a deeply personal account on what Brigette felt, but it seemed that while it made her a bit insistent—she was still in control.
“Mr. Potter, I need you to take this so you can heal a bit more. Say goodbye to your friends.” Winston stated seriously, though Draco could see his lips twitching upward beneath his mustache.
“Ow!” He cried out, flushed as he turned around to look at Harry. Harry had a smirk on his face, “You’re not supposed to spank me on our anniversary.”
“You’re vitals are excellent—I’m not quite capable of healing you more yet, but I will—” A knock on the door made him turn. Harry pushed open the door with a large white cardboard box and another to-go container full of coffees.
, mate. Don’t scare me like that.” George wiped a tear away. George had also tried to walk into the room, but the tall Alpha hadn’t been able to get close. Probably because Harry felt like the alpha was
. Draco threw back the rest of his drink. He did not find a Weasley attractive. He did not find a Weasley attractive. He did
“If your parents ever talk to me, then I will assure them.” Harry promised, “I grabbed you from a fire pit—this is considerably different.” Harry said.
The article went on to claim the aurors were incompetent but still managed to make it sound like it was a good thing Lucius was able to complete the act. It mentioned that Draco, Harry and Narcissa were all there.
“Me either—want to look at it?” Draco asked tentatively. She nodded, so Draco dropped his bag on the table next to her. He reached into his bag.
“I think you two could be good friends if you both can let the past go. It might not be fair of you to ask of him—but I can.” She shrugged, “Plus, I think I’d like my friends to stop avoiding my flat because you’re here.”
. Because no one remembers the past like us old guys, and no one can look forward to the future like young people. Like my children, who have no idea what it is like to grow up with their life in constant danger, except for when I get particularly angry.” Harry paused for more laughter, “A future where we can disagree on some things, but not make that turn our wands against each other. A future that you are judged by your actions, not whether you are the son of a former Death Eater or son of the Boy Who Lived Twice. Where it is our
“I’ll take care of him.” His mother pulled him toward the small parlor room. She closed the door behind him as Draco stared. He couldn’t quite believe what had happened. Nothing felt real. His head didn’t feel attached to his body. A sickening feeling twisted in his gut almost seemed to anchor him, bring him back to reality.
Draco laughed, “No you don’t.” Harry scowled, which only made Draco laugh harder. He was still holding Harry’s hand though, as they waited for Blaise to walk through the door. There were a few Quidditch magazines on the coffee table, so Harry grabbed one.
“Because Patricia doesn’t know any better!” Draco yelled, “Not her fault she isn’t a healer! Any healer who had fucking been to basic class would have known not to do what you did!”
Draco wasn’t sure why he felt like crying. It wasn’t like this was necessarily a surprise. Of course, he wasn’t going to get a ringing endorsement from Granger. But it still hurt.
Deft hands made short work of Draco’s trousers. Harry sat up a bit to pull them the rest of the way off Draco and threw them aside. Draco wrapped his legs back around Potter’s waist, pulling him flush against him. Draco loved it when Potter just had his jeans on when Draco was naked; there was something so sensual about it. His jeans felt rough against his skin, but it only added to his pleasure.
Draco looked down and watched Harry’s cock right as he began to come. He groaned as cum poured out of the tip and leaked onto the shower tiles. Draco loved watching Potter’s cock twitch between his legs; his strokes slowing down as he finished coming.
“I’m not sure why I’m here.” Potter said, striding away. Draco scowled after him—what the fuck was wrong with wanting nice things? It’s not the
“Professor Flitwick.” Draco looked up from his notes to the professor. He must have stayed a bit too long, he was lost in his own thoughts.
“Neville went through his wild phase a bit back, but he’s been with Hannah for like three years now.”
Draco managed to get home a few minutes before seven. He had a few more things to catch up on before he managed to get home. He wasn’t surprised when Potter wasn’t there, as the man tended to run late. Hermione was there, cleaning the counter.
“No! Didn’t hit Prongs.” Potter said with a smile, “Got awful close, but he moved in time.” The stag shook his antlers a bit.
“Hey Malfoy.” Potter greeted with a small grin, shuffling his feet a bit when Draco came over to the black ink section. Who knew there were so many kinds of black ink? Why was he surprised by this every time?
Something changed between them after that night. They had never talked about the future so concretely before, but somehow planning their future together relaxed them both. Talking about feelings was something Meredith still encouraged. Draco was going to therapy regularly again, wondering why he ever stopped in the first place. He and Harry did some therapy together and some apart, but it definitely helped them navigate their relationship. It was difficult when Draco was too emotional to not to fall back on bad habits, and Harry would stubbornly protect Draco from his own feelings in the name of love. Draco felt like they wouldn’t be making it through this time so easily without her. Not that it had been easy, but it would have been much more difficult without Meredith to guide them.
“No.” Harry’s voice was deep with arousal. Draco kissed his chest, his fingers grasping Harry’s arse with both hands. He squeezed his cheeks sensually and kissed his chest again.
it felt good. His legs shook as he worked himself, his cock spilling precum on his stomach. Just as his toes started to curl, he pulled the vibrator out, tossing it to the side.
“I know.” He smirked a bit, “You have me beat in Arithmancy though—and it’s really anyone’s game in Transfiguration.” Draco had fallen from grace a bit in transfiguration, but he still had a fighting chance.
“She was stunning.” Harry agreed a bit wistfully, closing the album and placing it carefully back on the shelf. It still hurt to think of Ginny, but not like it once did. He had loved Ginny with everything he had, and he still did love her. But he loved Draco too, and fell more and more in love with him every day. There was a picture on the shelf of Harry and Draco’s wedding. It was one of the goofy ones and one of Harry’s favorites. The entire family was in the picture—all the Weasley’s and Malfoy’s parents too. Cissa and Lucius stood stiff while the rest of the family were going a bit crazy. Harry had jumped into Draco’s arms and licked his cheek, Lily was making a funny face, Scorpius was sitting on Albus’s shoulders, George was setting of a firework, Ron’s hair changed blue, Teddy had given himself a pig nose. It was all around pandemonium.
to have a second pair, cleared the prescription then zoomed in the lenses like magnified glasses before handing them to Draco. Draco scrunched his nose, changing the style a bit and placed them on his nose.
Harry frowned, “I don’t really like to talk about it—right after Ginny died. I wanted to be a ghost, to just fade into nothing.” Harry closed his eyes briefly, “She talked about how she would help wake me up to get to work, or feed herself when I forgot to make dinner. There were a few weeks between the time Ginny died and Teddy moved in to help take care of Lily—and I think it was Lily who asked him to move in but I never asked him. Albus thought I was moving on to fast—and she said he wasn’t here for it. He got to run away to Hogwarts, what the fuck did he know?”
They ended up eating dinner in Isaac’s quarters. Draco had only ever seen Snape’s rooms, so he was excited to see Isaac’s. The three of them sat at dinner and ate until Draco was so full he thought he would burst—and then Lindsey brought out tiny pies. Draco laughed until he thought he would split in two. The siblings told lots of stories about growing up. And despite Lindsey’s struggles, she sounded proud of her childhood. Isaac was fifteen years older, so Lindsey mostly remembered how much he bullied her (as big brothers tend to do).
—at least for the moment. He sat back, leaning against the wall and heard the crunch of his diaper as he did. Tears burned and he nearly choked to try to force them down. It was embarrassing. One could have argued that he could use some humbling, but this was humiliating to the extreme.
Draco collapsed on Potter’s back as Potter’s legs fell flat. It was a bit sticky and gross, but Draco was too content to care. Draco moved off to the side and Potter put his head on his shoulder, throwing a leg between his own. It was a bit strange—Draco never thought about holding him like this. He always pictured himself in a more submissive role—but he liked it. Draco squeezed Potter tight just as a cleaning charm went over them.
“Who drew on you?” Isaac asked, pointing at Draco’s arm. He had left his sleeves up without noticing.
Also I'm terribly sorry for the late update. Bit of an emergency this week, so even though this chapter was written I didn't think about updating. Thanks for your patience!
“No. I fell in love with Ginny, so it seemed as if I would only add drama if I announced it. And people—I don’t know—people get weird views on bisexuality. Like that I just want to fuck everyone with legs, or I somehow chose to fall in love with Ginny before a man. Or even worse that I
Draco accio’d the good bottle of firewhiskey he gave Harry for a bet he lost and a few glasses, “I believe this is cause for celebration.” They put the ring away before getting carried away with celebrating, which turned out to be a fantastic idea because all three of them got spectacularly intoxicated.
In late March, work took a turn for the worse. A wizard was repeatedly raping women in Diagon Alley. Harry had been working nearly around the clock trying to capture him with his fellow aurors. It had been awful. Harry had personally sat in with all the interviews, if the victim consented. Most women trusted Harry, but it was still difficult to tell the story at all let alone with a man in the room. Mel was the head auror on the case, she had worked as an auror for nearly twenty years and was worth her weight in gold. The woman was a few stones soaking wet, but she was a fierce auror.
“Where are we?” He asked. Harry didn’t answer as they walked. Another two people walked by and Draco heard them speaking in French. It wasn’t necessarily uncommon in England but—he turned to Harry.
“Not that you cut yourself.” Harry clarified quickly, “I died and I got to choose to come back. But my friends didn’t—Remus, Tonks- F-Fred-” Harry’s voice caught in his throat, “They were better people than I am—they didn’t do the terrible things I did. They deserved the chance that I got—it’s not fair. The guilt of that—sometimes I can’t breathe under the weight of it.” Potter rubbed the scars again, “I
“I think they wanted the story of big Alpha Harry Potter fucking them more than they wanted the reality of just me.” Harry said with a roll of his eyes.
Draco snorted, “Absolutely not.” The music was coming to an end but Harry didn’t want to let Draco go.
“Yes it is fair!” Draco yelled, then let out a breath, “You cut me out of the will—you threw me out on the street! I realize Father made the decision but you
“Yeah you did.” Potter said with a happy sigh as he leaned over Draco to grab his wand on the side table. A quick spell and they were both clean, “Fucked him well and good too.” Draco snorted and Potter kissed him before falling on his back, “I’m not leaving this bed.”
“Finished!” She cried out, smiling. It was absolutely stunning. She took her wand, “You are going to love this part.” She told Draco. She whispered a spell and Draco watched Harry’s skin ripple. The owl moved his head like it was stiff and then shook out its feathers. It opened its beak in a silent hoot—the phoenix on the other side of Harry’s back answer its call.
“Ron came to visit ‘Mione, so whatever they’re doing I don’t want to be apart of” His tone was amused, “And I don’t have a girlfriend.” Potter rocked up his toes with a grin, “I do things by myself, you know.”
“Fred and George helped me escape from here my second year I think? Yeah it was my second year.” Draco thought he might have heard the story, but he kept his mouth shut as he weaved his fingers through Potter’s, “They attached a cable to the car and pulled the bars off the windows. We put everything in the car first so I could jump right in after the noise.”
“Glad you could make the effort to come in Malfoy.” Pope said, “Potter said you were coming here tonight to answer a few questions.”
. There was a picture of a young boy and girl on the front and it was clearly made for someone who is a young teen—not nearly thirty years old.
going to be bruises on his hips. Harry was relentless. The pace was making Draco’s whole body tingle—he wanted to feel
“Yes, I read it.” Harry said, it was a comprehensive article on creatures in the amazon. Their journey had been interesting. The couple had gained a mass following for their fearlessness in going into dangerous environments to find terrifying creatures. Their stories were hilarious and exciting, and Harry was a fan.
“That’s different. They weren’t all together.” Draco informed him as they were walking down the steps out of his flat.
. He managed to gloss over extremely specific details, but he told him everything else. All up to the point where Harry ditched him to be with his friends.
“Draco.” Harry said his name so emotionally that Draco’s whole body tingled. And like the coward he could be sometimes, he didn’t have the courage to look up to see if Harry was just as effected as he was, “Draco.” He whispered his name again like a prayer, a request. Draco gripped Potter’s hips a bit tighter before looking up. As soon as Draco met Harry’s eyes, he knew he wasn’t alone. Harry’s green eyes were wide, his breathing short. Draco crawled up a bit, wrapping his arms underneath Harry to hold him close. The kiss was desperate, Harry’s grip on his back
They still went to a mind Healer. Sometimes together to make sure they were both on the same page, and also separately to help themselves grow. Isaac’s gift for graduation was signing them up with a Mind Healer he recommended in London. It was a bit of an awkward transition to someone different, but Draco was grateful because now Isaac was just a friend. They saw each other regularly, Isaac telling hilarious stories about new Hogwarts student’s shenanigans. But they weren’t as crazy as Draco’s own stories, for which he was grateful.
“It fell out of style the first time the Dark Lord tried to take over.” Draco crossed his arms over his chest, “A Death Eater used it to torture a muggle and the muggle exploded black goo all over him. He died from the resulting goo. Death Eaters like to be messy, but not to their own harm.”
Longbottom smiled, “We have never had any sort of sexual relationship. I’m straight. But I’ve heard the rumors.”
When residency in the hospital started, Draco learned how to do a lot on very little sleep but he loved it. One time after a particularly long shift, he stumbled back into his apartment. Hermione was just pulling on her healers robes for her shift. She scrunched up her nose when she saw him step through the floo.
“You are, I’ll be sure to call you if Potter needs anything.” She nodded fiercely before walking out of the room.
each other. The moment seemed to last a life time. Harry took Draco’s lips with his own, giving him a kiss that was soft and chaste. Draco grunted, thrusting into him again with a bite on Harry’s neck. Harry mewled, feeling warmth burst through out him as the bond wove himself together with Draco. His breathing came up short and he pulled Draco into him as much as he could. Draco had started to come.
