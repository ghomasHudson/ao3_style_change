— utterly ludicrous.’
Draco didn’t give him the chance. He smiled and said, ‘I guess it needs some attention too. Would you let me?’
‘Is it the mob?’
Harry laughed again. The stream rushed, clear and cold, leaves drifting on the current. A bird chirped overhead, flapping its wings across the sky, and Draco leaned back on his hands and closed his eyes, tilting his face to a slanting ray of light.
‘I’d like to dream about you.’
Harry knew he liked boys as much as girls. He’d confessed to Ron and Hermione three years ago that he fancied both Cedric
Before Draco has the chance to respond, Harry shuffles further down, sucking at Draco’s balls gently, then moving even lower. He pushes Draco’s knees high in the air and licks the cleft of his arse.
‘I doubt a

‘Look,’ Rookwood growled, ‘I just don’t think Malfoy’s here. He’d be stupid if he didn’t Disapparate when he heard the dogs.’
‘Would they do that?’
This time Harry couldn’t keep in his laughter. He turned his back to them and pretended to cough.
Harry says, ‘With the right incentive, I might be persuaded to reveal all.’
Everything Draco said was true, and yet Harry persisted. ‘I’ll make sure this place is safe. And if you stay here— When I come back…’ — his heart thudded a little — ‘I can see you.’
Draco returned to his bedroom with a vial of Calming Draught and Potter, who he seemed unable to shake off. Potter even climbed into bed next to him without asking. He resumed his toplessness, though, so Draco felt he shouldn’t complain. If indeed there was something wrong with him, surely Potter’s toplessness could only help.
, of course.’
‘Is this where we had sex?’ Harry said, his eyes wide and hopeful.
Draco wishes Granger would
‘I have to warn you I’m ticklish.’
He didn’t let it stop him, though. No, he was too selfish for that.
‘And I hope you don’t expect me to trust your word, because you’ll be disappointed.’
Heart in his mouth, Harry hurled the handset he’d been holding as far as he could and climbed after Draco to the highest branches that could hold their weight. Hidden behind the leaves, dripping with cold sweat, frozen with terror, Harry watched the wizards’ careful approach.
Harry scuffed the toe of his shoe in the dirt. A plan had formed in his mind, the need to leave, to go and do something. The urgency ran through him, pushing him forward. ‘I’m going to leave. Tonight even.’
‘You don’t have to sound so suspicious, Malfoy. I think of someone we both know and you ask me questions to which I can only reply yes or no. You’ll have to guess who I’m thinking of.’
The raw honesty stirred something inside Harry. Draco’s openness was a far cry from his cryptic statements at the start of their adventure. Harry watched him as the train rumbled on, Draco’s profile lit by the sun, his mouth pursed, and thought of Hagrid’s book of Monsters, revealing its secrets at the stroke of a finger.
They held each other and said nothing. Other sounds than Draco’s breathing returned to Harry, reminding him that it wasn’t just him and Draco in the world: the buzz of insects in the undergrowth and the chirping of birds overhead, the horses’ soft neighs, the distant murmur of the guards by the road as an unseen cart clattered past.
‘And because you liked him.’ Draco darted a sideways glance at Harry before he went back to staring outside.
. And no, she didn’t, because magic can heal a cut before it has a chance to get infected. Dittany also helps.’ Harry dabbed the antiseptic solution onto the cotton ball. ‘This might sting a little.’ Gently, he pressed the cotton on the wound.
. He sucked the rim hard, provoking a whimper, and reached his hand to touch Harry’s cock. A couple of strokes were enough to send him over the edge, shuddering and calling Draco’s name.
Harry tapped the scuffed dark wood of his desk. ‘We’ll wait. The reports say that Lord Lucius's wife dotes on their son. She’s old money, too. Perhaps
about you.’
‘Fine, Potter, let’s play it.’
‘You look unhappy,’ Harry dared to say.
Harry reckoned in Draco-talk this meant “no, I don’t want Voldemort to win.” Perhaps it was a Slytherin thing to never give a clear answer.
Harry had never been more reluctant to leave a place. The urgency of his mission and his team’s fate prickled in him, demanded he leave and head to the town to communicate with London, but he felt as if he’d left a part of him trapped in these stone walls.
Harry gracelessly gulps some champagne, feeling the heat rising from his skin and sweat pooling at the small of his back. Malfoy sprouts some more nonsense about ‘the substructure of critical thinking’ and the witch finally moves on. He turns to Harry and gives him half a shrug.
,’ Esther said proudly as if she’d said
!’ Malfoy snapped.
It sounds like a challenge and Harry decides to meet it. He leans in as well, his face close enough to Malfoy’s that his hair tickles Harry’s face. ‘I can reveal that I deal with objects of unknown provenance that might be Dark. Is that revealing enough?’
‘Sure.’ Harry shut the door behind him, feeling awkward near Draco’s half-nudity.
hate Harry Potter.’
‘You may kiss,’ the priestess smiled.
‘You do realise,’ Harry couldn’t stop himself from adding, ‘that bullying the friends I made wasn’t going to ingratiate you to me?’
Everything Draco does to Harry hurts him. He can’t bear it.
‘No one does, Potter.’
It’s not an insult. The way Draco says it, the quiet ache in his voice, his pinched expression… it sounds almost like he’s hurting.
‘No, um, I’m returning these.’
Malfoy takes a mock bow. ‘At your service.’

? Your parents’ friends?’ Harry scoffed.
He’d meant it as a warning in case Draco didn’t want a mouthful of his spunk, but Draco instead increased the pace of his sucking and added his hand, exploring the base of Harry’s cock and slithering to his balls. And then…
Harry listened. Sound travelled in the wind, but he couldn’t decipher— yes, he heard it then. ‘Dogs?’
‘Go on,’ Mrs Li says.
.’ He deflated as he spoke, his fury turned low, inwards, mixed with despair. ‘I have nothing but
‘They’re for— Never mind. Continue.’
‘Getting there will take us
Draco sits on the bed beside him. ‘Sensei,’ he uses the formal address he hasn’t used in years. ‘You’ve shown me your world when I knew nothing of it. You’ve taught me about kitchen appliances and vinyl records and how to do laundry. You were endlessly kind when I had no one; when I lashed out. I was a feral animal when you found me, and you made me into the man I am today. Now, it’s my turn to show you
Draco raised an eyebrow. ‘How do you know— oh, of course. Well, the spell is useless now. It’ll probably show you’re in the general area and not in, say, Scotland, but that’s about it. It won’t lead them to this place.’
A man in a dark suit opens the door. ‘Tell Mrs Li that Mora is here. I have something she wants.’
‘Not at all. Commandeer anything you want.’ Harry’s voice comes out flirtatious and he coughs to clear it. ‘So, er, do you like art?’
In primary school, Harry had been chased, beaten up, surreptitiously kicked when the teacher wasn’t looking, called names, all because of Dudley. Dudley’s influence, Harry’s ill-fitting school uniform, his isolation: a cocktail that attracted bullies like sugar attracts wasps. At Hogwarts, he’d endured whispers and rumours; the newspaper spreading lies about him — some at Draco’s eager prompting; Draco himself taunting him for being an orphan.
Draco freezes, then shakes his head with a huff of laughter. He resumes laying soft kisses on Harry. ‘You should be a detective.’
‘Ten minutes? McG will be here any moment. Don’t scoff.’
‘You could’ve told me last night, you know,’ Harry said, caressing Draco’s stomach until his palm curled around his cock. Draco gasped with pleasure as Harry stroked him with firm movements. ‘We could’ve had all fucking night.’
‘No!’
A couple of hours later, a hand shook Harry awake. He sat up and fumbled for his glasses, the memory of last night’s wank returning and heating his cheeks as he took in Draco, hair all mussed and face languid from sleep.
, a voice said, and his brain supplied him with unhelpful images of Malfoy wet in the lake, upset, desperate. The brief glimpses of vulnerability shoved hastily under a mask of indifference. The way he bit his bottom lip when hesitating, his enthusiastic ramblings about King Arthur, his eager pretense at being royalty. Images that showed a side of Malfoy other than that of the cold, impenetrable, pureblood tosser. But he shook his head to dispel these memories and got out of bed.
Footsteps. The duvet was lifted. Harry kept his eyes shut, hoping Draco would think he’d sprawled all over Draco’s side in his sleep, and not because Harry’d wanted to smell him in the sheets.
‘You don’t?’
Harry nips the inside of Draco’s thighs and licks at the soft skin where they meet his scrotum. He takes a mock-apologetic expression. ‘Ah. I fear I’m going to disappoint you.’
‘Shut up.’
‘Here.’ Malfoy stretched out his hand, half a chocolate frog in it. ‘I had it in my pocket. Take it.’
bursting through him, every bit of frustration and longing and regret he’d kept hidden inside finding sweet, thunderous release. Grabbing Harry tight, Draco pulled his body flush against him and tilted his face, driving his tongue in deeper. Harry responded eagerly. They kissed for a long time, and every time Harry would attempt to pull back, Draco would pull him back in, kissing him and kissing him until he had enough—and he could never have enough, so he kept kissing Harry, sloppily, wetly, furiously; and he kept pressing Harry against him, hands clutching at his bare shoulders, holding on for dear life.
Harry cleared his throat. ‘I found this parka that might be a little too large for you. But it’ll be warm. And a bomber jacket.’
‘You like that, Potter?’ Draco whispered in his ear. He accompanied his words with a sinuous roll of his hips. The hard length of his cock pressing against Harry’s arse was probably the most delectable thing Harry had experienced in his life. He arched his back, pushing his bum towards Draco, who purred with appreciation.
‘That’s the thing,’ Draco said, his voice breaking. ‘I’m not
Draco’s beside him, awake. The air is thick with lies and half-truths and secrets.
‘I like you, Draco.’ Harry’s eyes are in shadow, his tone careful even if he’s already a little breathless. ‘I like
. Draco was a colleague; a friend, even. They’d been out for drinks once or twice. People were protective of their friends.
Relief flooded through Harry, and he flopped back on the pillow. That owl had made him jumpy. If he carried on like this, he’d have a heart attack before the Dark Lord got a chance to do him in.
‘Admiring your handiwork?’ Draco asked.
Draco had frozen at this display of intimacy. He turned to Pansy again. ‘Sweetie, humour me and tell me: am I friends with Granger?’
Draco had pulled away and held him as Harry, breathing hard, fell on the thick carpet. ‘Let me look after you,’ Draco said again. ‘Leave everything to me. Just let me,’ and Harry said yes, because he would give anything to this man right now.
He didn’t have a chance to elaborate. Cam approached them with a small child in tow. He handed the wand and the silver dagger to Draco. ‘Keep ‘em both tucked in. We see them in your hands for whichever reason, it’ll go badly for you.’
‘Shut up.’
Harry had to fist the sheets, tendons straining, to stop himself from coming immediately. The sensation was so different than a hand. Draco’s mouth was so…
‘When I was little, King Arthur was my favourite. I mean, sure, everyone loves Merlin, but Arthur was a true hero, you know? I devoured everything about him. Him and—’ he paused.
‘That’s not all, though, is it?’ Draco asks. People wouldn’t go to this trouble for a shield, not matter how powerful.
‘There’s something I want to do,’ Draco said.
Malfoy glanced at Harry, who nodded furtively. ‘Yes,’ Malfoy confirmed. Her eager eyes lit up, she opened her mouth to ask something, but Malfoy stopped her in her tracks. ‘I wish I could tell you more, but any details need to remain
‘Are you blushing?’
‘They’re doing blood magic,’ Malfoy said conversationally. ‘I can feel it under my skin. But they don’t have my blood, they’re probably using my parents’, so they won’t be able to track me down.’
Harry’s friends are scattered around the room. They won’t miss him. Just because they came together, doesn’t mean they need to leave together, right? They’re grown-ups. Also, Harry hasn’t had a proper shag in ages, and it’s very clear by Malfoy’s words and expression that that’s where this evening is headed.
Trust the devil to choose his words well. Harry hadn’t felt so aroused so fast in his life, and he’d been a fifteen-year-old boy. The image Draco conjured had his pulse spiking. He flipped them around, pushing Draco against the tree and his thigh between Draco’s legs. Draco moaned, a tantalising smile on his face.
‘I’ve been going around in circles in this bloody forest for
Draco lets out a string of expletives, and Harry chuckles before he bends back down to the dusky pink pucker. Lick, swipe, lap, jab. Around the rim, inside. Harry’s almost out of breath and his position is awkward, his cock dying for some attention, his legs cramping. But nothing matters except rimming Draco to the edge of insanity.
‘Yes, and a silver thread connects your body to the blood. But, not to fret,’ he said. ‘If we’re lucky, the house-elves have cleaned up the mess already. Hopefully, no one will realise it’s
Harry’s breath hitched. ‘I want to,’ he said. ‘I want to be inside you. Is it too—?’
Harry kissed him lightly on the lips and drew the cloak around him. ‘See you at breakfast.’
‘It’s about a witch and her son, who live on a barge. The witch knows she’s dying and she asks the river fairies to raise her son. She sings the lullaby as a goodbye to him, telling him how much she loves him, and also saying how precious he is to convince the faeries to look after him.’
‘Sod off.’
Draco picks it up and turns it in his hands. It’s a Succubus alright.
Draco swallowed. His hands twitched a little and he put them in his pockets. ‘It’s fine. Did you see him? Did you see my parents?’ He circled the bed and sat on the other side.
This time there was no pretense of sleep. This was no “getting carried away”. Harry almost trembled with the force of his desire. He enjoyed being cuddled a little more than he’d like to admit. That feeling of being wholly enveloped in someone else’s warmth and scent. Slotted behind him, Draco rubbed his erection insistently against Harry’s arse, his breath warm on Harry’s neck. Craving more, heart galloping with his daring, Harry pushed down his bottoms and kicked them off. Draco made a keening noise that pleased Harry no end. The movement of the mattress behind him indicated Draco taking off his bottoms too. A moment later, the heat of Draco’s shaft, silky and hard, slid between Harry’s arse cheeks, and Harry almost blanked out from bliss. It felt so… intimate, so exhilarating to be touched there.
‘No.’
Harry took in the sight of him sprawled on the bed, naked and fair, his shoulders and face lightly tanned from the times he’d been allowed on deck, and struggled to remember what they were talking about. He straddled Draco and wrapped his hand around his cock. ‘Pirates vote,’ he said, feeling Draco’s prick grow in his hand. ‘Every important decision we have to make is put on a vote, including who the captain is. I have absolute authority during battles only.’
‘So I’m supposed to trust you with my blood? Thanks, but no thanks.’
Draco hadn’t been in London since the time of the Normans. Saying it was unrecognizable was an understatement. Gas lights lit the busy street where people spilled out of the theatres to call cabs to take them home or to elegant restaurants. Draco hadn’t been around so many humans in centuries, and the delicious aroma of the blood pumping in their veins raised the hair of his neck and sharpened his canines.
‘Hope.’
‘Thank you.’ Draco feels tiny in front of such generosity. ‘I was truly appalling to you in the past, and you — you’re too kind. Thank you.’
‘Please hold hands,’ the priestess said, and Harry clasped the hands of his husband-to-be, who looked thoroughly displeased with Harry — as if it’d been
‘Go on then — if you’re so sure you can deliver me. Press that fucking tattoo on your arm and he’ll come. You’ll be with your parents again. Wouldn’t bet on how long.’
Nariyoshi’s OK. Draco squares his shoulders. Time to do what he came here to do.
‘Not so fast, lads,’ said a gruff voice.
‘What I mean is: surely a device must exist that can be used to trick magical people into thinking we are somewhere we aren’t?’
‘What else is there to know?’
‘Do you think we’ll make it out?’ Draco asked.
‘They can do more than that,’ Draco muttered.
it so much. He wasn’t even supposed to touch Potter.
They spent the day indoors. The rain fell harder by noon, justifying Harry’s decision to stay. He liked the cottage and the women in it more the longer he stayed there. Dawn — tall, grey hair in a bun, brisk — worked with a frightening expediency and hummed while doing it. Her curt manners and her reluctance at having them around didn’t stop her from serving them lunch (tomato and basil soup) in bowls so large that even Hagrid would have a job emptying them. Esther, on the other hand, was a fragile, quiescent thing; a shiny rock around whom the household’s activity flowed and ebbed. Petite, with a pure white bob, and clever brown eyes, she passed her time knitting or watching Antiques Roadshow or taking care of the innumerable potted plants crammed in every nook and corner, watering and whispering at them.
They’d shifted on their sides by now, hands on each other’s pricks. Neither of them had said a word, they hadn’t even kissed; they just breathed hard and touched and
‘It’s all worked out.’ Harry strokes his back. ‘But you two still should move in. The Lis have ties to the mob. Hell, they
Draco stood still, while Harry rummaged in the cupboard and found cotton balls, some iodine, and a selection of plasters. His visits to the primary school’s nurse had given him some idea of the process.
Draco ground his hips, a heavy, delicious weight on Harry’s lap. ‘Do you like this, husband?’ Draco asked, a sly smile on his face as he tortured Harry with hypnotically slow rolls. ‘I wanked so much last night thinking of this.’ He leaned close to Harry’s ear, still keeping the maddening pace. ‘I wanked myself
,’ Harry says, and Draco does.
Draco said, ‘Unless a witness sees me too, the Death Eaters might speculate — correctly if I might add — that I’m still here. They need to know we’re both in Tinworth.
A few turned out to be nine pieces, something close to a hundred and eighty pounds. Malfoy shoved the coins back in his pocket and said carefully, ‘We’re both on the run, Potter. Both going to Tinworth.’
meant.’
Merlin, he kissed him!
‘Don’t let Goyle hear you say that,’ Rookwood chuckled.
Draco’s breathing changed; it sounded shallower and faster as he moved his hand with rather more determination than before. Eyes shut, feigning sleep because it was easier than admitting how much he wanted this, Harry concentrated on the fiery trail of Draco’s touch as his hand stroked Harry’s ribs, his waist, and then,
Potter said yes to his invitation. Draco found it hard to sleep that night.
‘Exactly.’ Malfoy’s mouth latches onto Harry’s neck, his teeth grazing the sensitive skin.
Potter’s smile is a challenge. ‘I can take it.’
‘Flatmate. Boss. Friend. Sensei. Cool uncle type. He’s everything,’ Draco mutters.
‘I think there’s something wrong with my Splinching,’ Draco said. ‘It hurts a lot more today and — well, could you take a look?’
He stayed like that for a long time, listening to the rushing water, until hands circled his waist and a promising erection pressed against his back.
. Two anons asked for:
Harry’s eyes darkened at the sight of Draco pushing one finger inside himself. Lust was written all over his face and Draco bathed in it, as he opened himself up with one, then two fingers. ‘Want to try?’ he asked him.
‘Want to see it?’ Harry asks, picking up another sandwich.
anger.
Mrs Li shrugs. ‘A vampire could do it, too, but they’d vehemently refuse having anything to do with your kind, and we don’t want their species as an enemy. But an Incubus or Succubus was our best bet. We had no hope of finding who the rumoured Incubus was until you strolled into our club.’
‘We will. Thank you for everything.’
‘Perhaps it was a trick of the light,’ Draco said, but Harry knew they both remembered how dark it’d been at the cliff. He didn’t know what to make of this, but shrugged. ‘Let’s go gather some wood from the unfriendly forest— ouch!’
‘Bite me,’ he breathed. ‘Just don’t stop fucking me.’ Harry was too close, he’d been too close for ages, and wanted to come.
is the remedy.
precious blood on our floor.’
‘Riddle’s planning to send half of England’s navy to destroy the pirates. He’s also got a new governor for Port Royal. McNair. A cruel man, who’ll do Riddle’s bidding unquestioningly, according to Draco.’ He bit his lip when he realised what he’d let slip. He might be the captain of the ship after a unanimous vote, but Hermione still intimidated him.
They leaned close, their knees knocking together and their heads bumping. Draco held the wand between them, and Harry turned it gently to the side. ‘I was sure I saw it.’ They rolled the wand a few times and peered carefully, but no flash of white peeked from inside. ‘This is strange,’ Harry said. ‘I’d have sworn—’
‘No. Is that what it feels like?’
Harry glowered at him and, sighing, Malfoy straightened his back and approached the lady. His accent, when he addressed her, was sharp as glass.
When he came out, Malfoy had disappeared. Harry took in the town, the shops, Muggle life chugging along, and the enormity of his current catastrophe hit him. He also felt unexpectedly alone. It was odd; although Malfoy was the last person he wanted to spend time with, there was comfort being with someone who shared his predicament. He dreaded to think how things would've turned out for him had he set out on his own without Ron and Hermione. He’d have gone mad. Harry had never thought consciously before of how much he owed to them for their company, let alone everything else, and his chest ached with how much he missed them.
‘Hey, Hermione,’ he said.
The receptionist in the Atrium sends a memo to Potter, who emerges from the lift five minutes later. ‘Draco! This is—’ Draco’s expression is probably quite eloquent, because he hurries to Draco’s side. ‘What’s wrong?’
Draco swallowed. ‘Sure.’ He tried to pretend he was casual about it, but his voice betrayed him.
Draco’s wary expression darkens with lust when Harry settles between his legs and tugs his boxers off. He raises his hips to help Harry remove them. ‘I do love your mouth on my cock.’
A couple of hours later, nearing the famous Dozmary pool, and just as Harry was about to suggest a break to rest his aching calves and blistered feet, Malfoy turned abruptly behind them.
‘For tracking. It’s an old pureblood spell. Keep a drop of your child’s blood in a glass vial and you’ll find him if he’s ever kidnapped. But a few years ago I destroyed the vial my mother kept. There’s all sorts of dark magic you can do with someone’s blood.’
Harry takes one last sip of the awful cocktail before he pushes it aside. ‘It’s complicated. Now that I’m older, when I realise what it means to put a small child under the stairs… Imagine locking six-year-old Teddy in one! It makes me
‘You almost ruined everything back there with your big mouth,’ Malfoy told him.
. Everything he said that he’d loved—his smile, the way Harry clung to him at night, the taste of his lips, the timbre of his voice—soft and low—when he spoke to Draco, the fact he was willing to laugh at Weasley’s inane jokes—this was all Harry. This Harry.
The word ‘naked’ created a visual that Harry didn’t need right this minute. To cover his face heating up, he stretched his hand. ‘Can I?’
Harry licked his lips, his skin becoming hotter. ‘What brought you to the capital?’
Draco tucks him in and surrenders to an unwelcome but insistent desire; he kisses Potter softly on the lips. ‘Sleep now.’
Harry’s almost startled awake by the shock. He hasn’t seen Malfoy since he was sent to Azkaban, skinny and pointy and in despair, clutching his parents’ hands as the verdict was read, furious tears running down his face. This man is nothing like that boy. He’s relaxed, confident and devastatingly handsome. His sly gaze sparks a fire in Harry’s stomach and his voice sends shivers down Harry’s spine.
‘I’m heading there, too. Want to walk together?’
It sounded dire to Harry, but Draco’s face was set in a grim smile. ‘You said the Dark Lord’s trying to keep it a secret, that he wants me dead, but she suspects. She’s smart, my mother. She wouldn’t tell me to stay away unless she knew it’d be more dangerous for me to return.’
Harry didn’t need to ask for details. ‘Turns out Hagrid isn’t the only one with a herd of tamed Thestrals,’ he murmured.
consequences. A score of other things.’ He exhaled, shoulders slouching. ‘And one — threw a tantrum, I guess.’
Draco whispered, ‘Is sex as good as people say, Harry?’
And then — Harry’s heart sang triumphantly: Draco slipped his hand in Harry’s boxers.
Draco’s expression was gleeful at seeing Dolohov thoroughly flustered because of a humble Muggle device. Despite the terror, Harry shared his glee. ‘Oops. Missed me,’ he said, when Dolohov’s Accio produced no results. ‘But you get points for effort.’
‘You’re mine,’ Harry said, tangling his fingers with Draco’s and thrusting harder. Draco whimpered at the increasing pace, demanding more, and Harry clung on him tighter, driving his prick deep into Draco’s slick arse. He bit at Draco’s neck and snapped his hips hard, eliciting a loud moan from Draco. Harry liked it, so he did it again, and Draco moaned again, chewing on his bottom lip as Harry pounded his arse, his arms wrapped around Harry’s sweaty back.
But he can’t stay silent when the man exits the bathroom late one night, his shirt unbuttoned. Harry’s gaze falls on the scars crisscrossing his thin chest. He can’t fathom what they are. The man pauses, his eyes wary. Harry doesn’t even realise he’s stepped closer. ‘How did this happen?’
‘Nothing at all. Why should it bother me to hear about your
Harry.
‘I mean, he knows about the maniac who killed all those people sixty years ago…’
Malfoy brings the drinks over, heads turning as he passes through the crowd. Seems it’s not only Harry that finds him irresistible to look at.
‘Well, you’ll learn.’
owl,’ Draco said. ‘Melor. The Malfoy owl.’
‘Now, nothing. We sleep. We wake up. We go to work. We make love. Nothing needs to change, Draco.’
Draco had been staring at the TV with a duster in his hands, horror written over his face. Harry turned to see, and his blood chilled. The local news was on, a reporter with coiffed brown hair speaking to the camera in front of a burnt out shop front. ‘…the tragedy has shaken the local community. Beth Cooper and Pauline Seacole were well-liked by…’
Draco helped him up, leaving his hand on Harry’s back.
As they entered through the back door, the smell of meatballs wafted from the kitchen and Harry resolved to make every minute in this cottage count. Even if that included chores. Harry found that he didn’t mind doing chores when they were assigned with a kind smile and followed by hearty meals.
Harry laughed. ‘Something worthy of royalty. Worthy of Fenston.’
Draco glanced at Harry showering a couple of stalls away, his body covered in suds, and dismissed these thoughts as unwelcome remnants of his past life. He had nothing to fear in a world created to satisfy his desires; desires he meant to indulge in as soon as he found himself alone with Harry. With a smile, he closed his eyes and let his mind drift when the sound of his name brought him back to the locker room.
But with Draco absent… Harry slipped his hand inside his boxers to palm his prick. Much more comfortable in bed than in the bathroom. He shuffled to Draco’s pillow and buried his nose in it while his cock twitched in delight. No one else visited his fantasies tonight but Draco naked and sprawled on the bed, his long legs on Harry’s shoulders as Harry grabbed his hips and shoved his—
there it is.
He stands up, pushes his chair, and nods at Draco.
‘No, I didn’t.’ Her gaze is calculating even as her manner remains friendly. ‘I’d like to make you a proposition. A little job you can do for us in exchange for clearing your debt.’
‘You were disappointed.’
He looked up when he finished to see Malfoy stare, dark-eyed and flushed. Malfoy was breathing strangely, the expression on his face undecipherable.
— the immense power of the wand, almost humming as it dealt out punishment to the incompetents. Rookwood and Dolohov, their faces a grimace of agony, suffered their Lord’s displeasure until Voldemort lowered the wand, still furious.
Draco ensures Harry puts some warm clothes on; the house is draughty and he’s already shivering. They descend the stairs, passing the silent, glaring portrait, and Kreacher Scourgifying the evidence of their lovemaking from the wall – Harry goes bright red – and they enter the vast library.
He stared at the wand in his hands. Harry trailed his finger along the crack, certain that it’d been bigger before. ‘It looks like it’s mending itself,’ he said. ‘That’s odd.’
‘I never did anything other than help people.’
Harry steps closer. ‘I can’t get nearer than this—’ he approaches about two feet away ‘—without feeling a vibration that presses right into my brain.’ He glances at Draco. ‘Four of us are working on this. None of us could come as close as you have.’
Draco wanted to gorge himself on Harry’s lips. As Harry ground himself against him, one part of Draco’s mind marvelled at the fact that if this was a timeslip,
‘I’m not Robin Hood,’ Harry protested. ‘Don’t give a fuck about anyone but my crew.
, splits it into three, and spells the luminescent orbs to float through the coloured air. The effect is startlingly similar to a painting Nariyoshi showed Draco once, a starry sky all swirls of blue and purple with bright stars in its midst.
‘In school he did. I remember you glaring at each other from across the Hall. But we’re grown-ups now, Draco. Harry Potter’s a forgiving man. He also bats for both teams. He’ll definitely be open to your… talents.’
. He loathed that he knew the correct word; he resented any reminder of his upbringing, which his brain couldn’t resist dishing out now and again. He glanced at the Elder Wand and his new source of disquietness distracted him: the object of his desire proved
Draco was clutching his watering can tightly, eyes on the floor.

She left, the bell tinkling behind her, and Malfoy turned to Harry. ‘
, a ridiculous name for such a priceless, ancient object; and yet that’s the only way Draco can think of her now. ‘Why Harry?’ he murmurs.
Harry’s expression is unfathomable. He cups Draco’s chin, opens his mouth with his thumb and sinks his prick inside. ‘I’m not sure I can keep silent when you look so beautiful with my cock in your mouth.’ He thrusts deep inside Draco, who relaxes his throat, and takes it.
‘You know the funny thing?’ Draco’s tone revealed no humor. ‘I belong— I

‘No way. They’ll have Disapparated already.’
to do with me,’ Malfoy hissed.

‘That’s not our issue here,’ Potter said, tight-lipped.

Draco shifted at the touch and Harry snatched his hand back. He prayed Draco wouldn’t turn and shout at him as he had every right to. But Draco’s breathing didn’t change, just his position: he settled against Harry’s chest, his arse against Harry’s lap.
‘Thank you, Dawn. It looks lovely.’
‘Has it all gone well?’ Draco asks.
A moment of silence. Harry looked up.
Draco leaned over the device. ‘We’re off to France now, but we wanted to stop and say hi.’ To Harry’s questioning frown, he whispered, ‘Throw him off the scent. Make him go look for us in France.’
‘I hope you’re aware by now how wrong your parents have been, regarding a great deal of things.’
, the Shadow, the Nightmare.
Draco raised his eyebrow. ‘And I suppose losing your wand didn’t bother you much, did it?’
Dawn looked at him with appreciation. ‘No, it isn’t. Not to you, I don’t think.’
‘I’ll stick to the horoscopes for now,’ Draco told her. There was something he didn’t dare say out loud, but he hoped he could say it in writing.
Draco didn’t stop, but Potter caught up with him. They trudged in the muddy path that wound around the misty hills.
? You only use my surname when you’re annoyed with me or…’ —here he leaned close and smiled slyly—‘when you’re deep in my arse.’
‘You still up?’ Draco asked, sliding into bed, bringing with him the scent of the forest. He hesitated for a moment, glancing at the space between them, but Harry shuffled towards him. An invitation. Eyes smiling, Draco snuggled close behind Harry, wrapping his arms around him, pressing his chest on Harry’s back. Warmth bloomed between them, a simple comfort that was enough to dispel the darkness in Harry’s heart.
‘I guess being in a cave isn’t too bad.’
‘And the Mirror moved from a little-visited room to a busy corridor,’ Draco followed his train of thought. ‘It wanted to be seen; to be used by many.' He paused. 'But now the Mirror is going to the Department of Mysteries.’ Draco looked at Dumbledore. ‘It will never be happy.’
He’s spent the last three days considering how to approach Potter. He’s read back issues of the
? OK then.’
They crossed a field until they reached a hedge, and then another. The more hedges they passed, the more distance they put between them and the motorway, the more Harry calmed. His breathing returned to normal. The danger was behind them, but it had been a close call. When they reached the River Camel, flowing among a wooded strip of land, heavy and swollen with the spring rains, they stopped for a bite of bread.
‘It might be fine in a few days,’ he hazarded a guess. He handed it back, and Draco hurried to tuck it in the back of his jeans. ‘You’re so attached to it.’
Harry fumbled for an excuse. ‘I’m worried about my friends, ‘sall.’ Draco scoffed in disbelief, and the sound managed to dredge out the simmering rage and worry that Harry had suppressed these past four days. ‘Last time I saw them, they were being tortured by Death Eaters.’ He pursed his lips after blurting that out, knowing he’d aimed below the belt.
A hunched figure at the corner flinched. Harry hadn’t noticed Malfoy Senior in the shadows, and he was startled at his haggard appearance, the deep lines in his face.
It worked. Harry relaxed and sank back in his arms. ‘I promise I’ll remember next time.’
Dolohov paused, panting with exertion. The three other Death Eaters had fanned out behind him, but they were all ignoring the church. While the dust of the chipped wall was settling, Draco Accioed the walkie-talkie across the square, through the tree branches. They’d hoped no one would see it in the darkness, that they could lead Dolohov on a merry trail, but the rustling leaves gave it away. ‘There!’ The witch cried out, pointing at the oak. ‘Something’s there! At the tree.’
‘I think we can go now,’ Draco said.
An hour later, cranky from being turned out from everywhere, they came across an Oxfam in an alley off the high street.
‘You can’t blame him because the Wizengamot wanted to make an example of you.’
Which is why Harry was royally pissed off when Draco didn’t come to bed early yet again. The clock struck midnight, and half-worried, half-irritated, Harry left the bed to seek him out. Draco wasn’t in the living room nor the kitchen. He wasn’t lurking anywhere in the hallway or near the back door. Glancing through the window, Harry saw no sign of Draco in the back garden. His heart clenching in a whole different way — anticipation, but a different kind of anticipation: one tinged with fear — Harry put shoes on and headed outside.
‘Harry Potter,’ he replies, imitating the bow. ‘I’m sorry for the inconvenience, I think it’s the flu…’
‘His — valet,’ Harry said.
Cam met Harry’s eyes. ‘Shame we despise that noseless cunt.’
Harry and Draco sped up, and the wizard called, ‘Anton! I can see them!’
With a triumphant smile, Draco climbed over Harry’s supine body and pressed his hips flush against his groin. Skin on skin, searing touch. Draco’s hair fell in his face, his expression open like a night flower, surrendering and claiming at the same time, and Harry had never dared to imagine he’d be granted such happiness. Every cell of his body thrummed with heady, untidy joy. He traced Draco’s cheekbone and the corner of his mouth. ‘I like your mouth too,’ he murmured, voice low, feeling desire simmer in his blood. He slipped one finger between Draco’s lips, and Draco sucked it in, a shudder running through him that found an echo in Harry. Harry watched his luminous face, his ruffled hair, his intense gaze as Draco sucked Harry’s finger, and the lust pooling in his stomach stirred. ‘Merlin, I love your mouth,’ Harry said, voice gruff, and rose and kissed Draco.
Draco ignores him. His hair falls on his face, his voice husky. ‘It’ll feel good, I promise. I can give you the orgasm of a
‘Who the fuck was this toff, then?’ the other patients speculate as they gather at the windows, watching the car drive out of sight.
Silence. Harry’s heart drummed. He counted the exposed beams over his head. Five.
‘What is this?’ Malfoy stands in the cupboard with a frown on his face. He mutters something like, ‘The forest makes sense but this…’ but takes a look at Harry, who’s shaking, and stops. Two strides, and he holds Harry. ‘What’s wrong?’
‘Yeah,’ Potter stepped closer, his eyes blazing behind his glasses. ‘See, there’s someone who’s been making my palms sweat, my stomach flip, my lungs gasp for air. Someone whose thought keeps me up at night.’

‘I don’t—’ Harry objected, but Draco interrupted. ‘I’ll make sure he gets some rest.’
They said nothing else for some time, but neither of them seemed able to sleep.

,’ he told him, his voice soft, courtesy of the sip of Calming Draught probably, since Draco tended to be a lot more strung-out near Potter. He itched with the desire to bury his hands in Potter’s hair. Apart from caressing his cheek before, he hadn’t dared to touch him again. ‘But fill me in the last few days, Potter.’
[…] I have a question to ask of you. Have you heard of the Malfoy family? My memory isn’t what it used to be. I’m sure I’ve heard the name before, but I can’t seem to recall where.
Harry’s riveted by the scars, by how cruel they seem and also how incongruous they are to the battle wounds he’s used to seeing. He stretches out his hand. ‘May I?’
‘That’s the idea,’ the man murmurs, seemingly to himself.
When the conversation seemed to be done, Harry retreated to the kitchen as if he’d been there the whole time, ignoring Dawn’s raised eyebrow, his chest constricted. At the sound of Draco’s steps, he walked to the hallway, trying to look casual. Draco’s face was blotched, eyes red-rimmed and puffy. He breathed heavily. He paused when he saw Harry, his face rippling with some emotion Harry could only guess at, and then Draco flung open the door of the mothball-smelling coat cupboard and dragged him inside.
Harry sighed, but stood. They packed the loaf and set off.

They moved into the other ground floor rooms, each one with a few animals sheltering from the cold. Rooms designed for feral kneazles (with a large fireplace and a catnip-scented carpet), and jittery rabbits (with grass instead of flooring and inaccessible to the kneazles) and, in a dark room with a stone floor, a thestral mother with a baby, its skin grey and translucent over glowing bones. Water and feed was available freely and the smell wasn’t as bad as Draco would have thought.
He wasn’t sure who he was punishing that way, but accepting Granger’s suggestion would mean acknowledging the insult done to him by assigning him the horoscopes.
‘What now?’ Draco glanced at Harry with uncertainty. He looked like a pup fearing he’d get kicked to the curb.
‘You dirty little…’
‘I’m guessing,’ Draco drawled, ‘shukar means
They’d reached the potters’ neighbourhood and were riding along streets lined with urns and jugs in a dozen different sizes outside small workshops. The smell of clay wafted through the air. As they followed the angry shouting that came from the plaza where the incident had taken place, Draco turned to Harry. ‘The sea. I miss the sea.’

‘Done.’ He meets the man’s eyes in the mirror. He looks almost unrecognisable without the halo of his hair. His cheekbones and his pointy chin stand in sharper relief — a knife of a face, sharp enough to make Harry bleed. He holds Harry’s gaze, who feels hot from his proximity to the man’s body and the smell of his skin, soap and sweat and
‘How should I know?’ Harry asked, his hands sweating.
Draco has the smaller bedroom of the two, with a view of the tiny square they call a garden. He turns the light on, cringes at the mess, and shoves Potter on the bed. ‘Undress and I’ll get you some food. There’s some T-shirts in that drawer,’ he points to the dresser. Before Draco leaves, he casts a discreet spell over Harry. His vitals are quite low. He adds an extra blanket on the bed.
‘We’ll stay if we can get a lift with your grandson.’ He glanced at Draco to check he agreed, and Draco exhaled and nodded. Harry turned to the two ladies. ‘Thank you. We’ll be very happy to help you with any chores while we’re here.’
‘Imagine.’ Draco’s voice drips with sarcasm.
‘I have parents here,’ Draco said. ‘I’ve met them. They’re the same—’
‘I… I won’t harm you,’ said Draco. His teeth grazed Harry’s skin. Then, his lips latched on Harry’s neck, and he bit down.
So, he took walks, wandering the countryside as February gave way to a wet March. Often he’d visit the Shrieking Shack and stare at the boarded windows and the broken roof. He felt an affinity for the dilapidated building, the perfect image of how he felt inside. Everything was fucked here. Everything was grey and ugly and painful. Students cried over dead relatives. The
‘I bet your father was thrilled to see that game.’
Harry snorts. Draco glares at Nariyoshi’s look of patient understanding. ‘I didn’t accidentally consume any drugs you’re hiding — which I’ll bin the
‘I was one of the lucky ones.’ Harry fishes a photograph from the front pocket of his pyjamas. ‘That’s a few of us before we left for France. See that man? Ron Weasley, my lieutenant. Took a bullet to the head a week before the Somme. He was a good man; a good friend.’
Unless they were looking for something.
‘The portrait,’ she explained. She leaned close. ‘What did you see there, Draco? The Gryffindors said it was exactly like here.’
Heat spread from Harry’s mouth to all his nerve endings, his limbs slack under a wave of desire. He raised his hand to Draco’s neck, stroking the soft fuzz he’d seen in the morning, pressing him close. Draco tilted his head, opened his mouth and Harry mirrored him, sliding his tongue against Draco’s.
The carriage horses neighed, unsettled. The driver shouted something in angry Romanian. Harry had to leave.
Sue’s expression loses her mirth. ‘Let’s cut the dragonshit, shall we? We know everything, Draco — including the illness of your Muggle employer, which drove you to seek quick funds. We know you have no way in hell of raising the money you owe us, which means in a week’s time we’ll have to make an

, or rather something that Draco hasn’t been extorted to do. Fausta asks him for Nariyoshi’s details and hands him a pamphlet with dos and don’ts on how to break the news. Draco browses some of the pages as she speaks.
A different reaction was expected from him, Draco realised, so he raised his voice. ‘What? My
‘Rich, spoiled kid like him. That’s all he has,’ Harry said, unconcerned, as he followed Ron below deck where a poncy and whiny noise reached Harry’s ears.
Harry laughed and pulled him down and he proceeded to show Draco, with his fingers, his mouth and his cock, exactly what their first time was like. They stayed long after night fell, lounging in bed or wrapped in a throw in front of the fire, until starvation made them return to the castle and seek the kitchens.
Harry spoke again in his handset: ‘Hey, Dolohov!’
‘Those tiny, winged creatures that Professor Flitwick used as lights at the Yule Ball?’
Cutting it into pieces, Malfoy scattered it on the shore, attracting all manner of birds. He stood there, wings fluttering around him, as he threw piece after piece in the air and some in the lake, sinking with a

, the more energy you drain out of them. The easier it is to harm them.
Draco turned to face him. He felt a little stunned at their proximity. At the effortlessness of their conversation, the way they fit next to each other like pieces of a puzzle, legs tangled in each other’s and Harry’s hands at his waist. In all his fantasies, their interactions were fraught with aggressiveness; biting and shoving between kisses, lovemaking that resembled a brawl, but now he marvelled at how natural it felt to share his bed with Potter —
Potter, blushing and looking at their joined hands, clearly has no idea that his words are a knife twisting in Draco’s chest. The more besotted Potter is, the worse Draco feels.
dimwitted
Truce or no truce, Draco rubbing his pureblood superiority on Harry grated him. ‘What does that even have to do with the Muggles?’
His face and chest flushed beautifully and Draco’s arousal tugged sharply at his consciousness, making him want
Harry shrugs. ‘Bet he had a good life before that, though.’
Moreover, and more importantly, unlike his heists with Hermione and Ron, Harry and Draco were both appallingly defenceless. One sort-of-working wand between the two of them, a silver knife that neither could throw accurately, and their wits. Meagre resources against merciless wizards with magic wands.
Draco tensed. ‘I know. I don’t expect forgiveness. In the Mirror world, I wasn’t—’
‘We have no time.’ Potter pulled him gently in front of the Mirror. ‘I can’t do this without you. You have to want to go through.’
‘Fuck!’
‘You must hate it.’
He heard Draco’s voice then. ‘Come closer,’ the voice said. ‘Come with me.’
‘Too late.’
Draco laughed. ‘Of course. My horoscopes always come true, you know,’ he said as he leaned in and kissed him.
A low chuckle. Harry looked down. If he ever thought he’d seen Draco smug, he was wrong:
Harry cringed. ‘Do I want to hear what that is?’
They stepped into a narrow hallway and took their muddy shoes off as the door shut behind them. The woman ushered them through a door on the right and into a warm living room, lit only by a table lamp and a roaring fire. Embroidered cushions and a thick, handmade throw covered the burgundy sofas. Sitting by the fire, an elderly woman put down her knitting. ‘Come here so I can see you, lads.’
‘What do we do with him?’
‘I’ll pay it back. Put me down for tomorrow’s game. I’ll win it.’
unobservant.’
Harry didn’t have time to respond. Annie’d left; she returned now to lead them to a pink and green vardo. ‘You can stay the night,’ she said, ‘but it’ll be an early start in the morning.’
Harry didn’t reply to his taunt — if that’s what it was — and glanced at Draco’s shoulder. He winced at the sight of the angry red skin and the swelling surrounding the deep cut.
He gave her an imploring look while she frowned in thought.
It’s fantastic, is what it is. The slap of skin on skin echoes in the dim room, the moans and gasps and hard breathing become louder, and Draco’s relishing in the lushest arse he’s ever had the pleasure of ploughing. Sweat drips down his back, and he shuts his eyes for fear of the telltale black in them alerting Potter of what he is.
‘Do you think they’ll come back?’
. ‘Yes.’
‘Because we get on so well?’
Draco scoffed. ‘You’re so entirely ignorant of basic wizarding customs.’ He’d abandoned his duster on the floor in order to examine a picture of Esther in her youth, wearing a shockingly short skirt, next to a man who Uncle Vernon would describe as a “dandy”.
‘I hope you don’t mind I commandeered the conversation. I sensed you were having some difficulty.’
This time Harry’s name came out of Malfoy’s lips like an exhale, soft and curious, and Harry almost felt goosebumps. ‘You’re welcome. Draco.’
‘Will you let the light go out, for fuck’s sake? It’s too bright.’
‘We know what you are, Draco.’
Draco gave him a withering glance. ‘It’s terribly bad manners to talk with your mouth full, Harry.’
‘Accio Malfoy!’ said the second man.
‘I remember the medals,’ Draco lied, not wanting his Harry to fret; not when things were going so well. ‘But tell me about our—our first kiss.’
Harry watched with bemusement as Draco picked a handful of soil and sprinkled it over the other side of the parchment. ‘What on earth are you doing?’
‘Last chance,’ Harry said.
Draco smiles. It finally starts to sink in: he’s safe, Nariyoshi’s safe, and Harry knows. He knows everything and still wants Draco. ‘A housemate who begs for my cock every night.’
As soon as he’s up, Draco can see something’s wrong. Potter grabs the table, his knees unsteady. His skin is almost as pale as Draco’s.
. Shifting on the bed and ignoring his own hard-on, Harry presses Draco’s perineum, light strokes first before he slides his hand firmly all the way to Draco’s balls and back.
“I really don’t know why I bother,’ Draco said, pushing the parchment aside. He’d been staring at the diagrams for half an hour and could make little sense out of them.
. Not the way he really was.
. Harry had no idea how to feel about that. He could see Draco’s arm out of the duvet, the hateful symbol stark on his pale skin, taunting Harry. A reminder of all that was ugly about their world.
‘Err,’ Harry said, when Draco put a plaster on the cut, ‘I’m going to bed now.’
An hour and a half later, they trudged to the showers, singing
Harry ignored the insults, but the mention of Hogwarts piqued his curiosity. Snape was Headmaster and Malfoy ought to have loved lording it over everyone else with impunity, but his voice betrayed barely contained disgust. ‘How was school?’
knows something’s not right. Not Apparating — that’s made him suspicious. But he thinks it’s because we were looking for something in the moor. Rookwood is going to be searching the area to discover what it might be.’
Malfoy scoffs. ‘You were too unwell for it.’
‘Seeing as I’m an unsavoury character.’ Draco was teasing; no rancour in his voice.
It was a dry day, not particularly warm, and ideal for walking. They found a bridge across the Camel, and passed a cluster of cottages, grazing sheep, a group of tourists on a walking tour to Rough Tor, and a party of pixies, which thankfully ignored them in favour of harassing cattle. Soon the fields and pastures gave way to the desolate expanse of the moor. The windswept, vast space filled Harry with trepidation. They’d be completely exposed, unable to hide if anyone tracked them here.
Harry welcomed the chores, a blissful distraction from what he already thought of as ‘his real life’, and seeing Malfoy fumbling about the Muggle home had him rolling. He shouldn’t have been so amused, not with Dawn narrowing her eyes at Draco’s ignorance of what the fridge was, or his tickling the picture frames to make the people move, and frowning when they didn’t. Draco’s accent might have explained why he didn’t know what a dustpan was for, but it didn’t account for the fact that he stared at the toaster’s plug for a good half a minute, or why he jumped when Harry switched the vacuum cleaner on; a jump that had Esther burst in delighted laughter as she passed them in the hallway, a tiny mint plant in the hand that didn’t clasp the cane.
‘I promise you, the palace won’t forget the kindness you’ve shown me,’ Malfoy told the beaming ladies from the door. Harry shoved him out of the store, his mouth twitching.
Breathing heavily, Malfoy looked up, his face a portrait of fury. ‘That’s mine, you prick,’ he spat, his eyes on the wand.
Harry knew it in his bones that staying here was the only safe choice for Draco; all he had to do was convince him. ‘Why are you so reluctant? Was there a reason you wanted to reach Tinworth, other than it was the nearest magical community to where we landed?’
‘Something wrong?’ Draco asked Potter as they walked to the greenhouses. He’d been unusually quiet.
‘Thank you,
His voice cracked, and his face flooded with pain for a second before a calm, blank expression smoothed his features again. But Harry had seen the depths of the despair in Malfoy’s grey eyes. Harry shared the feeling; it was the kind of despair you feel when you don’t know if you’ll live to see eighteen.
. The bird’s tiny heart fluttered under his touch and Draco was glad to feel warmth spreading over the little bird.
‘Yes.’ Salazar stood immediately, as if he’d also been barely restraining himself until then, and threw some coins on the table.
Harry would be happy to never
Potter sheds his clothing and sits on the table, opening his legs to welcome Draco in. His cock juts long and red and proud, and Draco stares at it. Potter likes it, he can tell by the texture in the air; he likes Draco giving him orders or staring at him while gently stroking his own cock. He likes to be made to wait. Potter’s trembling with the force of his desire, and Draco is tempted to draw the anticipation to breaking point.
Draco’s heart fluttered. ‘You’ll be limping worse tomorrow,’ he breathed at Harry’s ear and was rewarded with a deep blush.
Harry made a mental note never to piss off Dawn. They finished their meal in silence in the darkening kitchen. Draco returned the tray and bid them goodnight. With Esther not around, everyone decided on an early night. Harry helped Dawn with her dishes and stopped by Esther’s room to chat with her a bit.
‘Want some help?’
.’ Draco’s gaze is feral, his mouth a snarl. ‘All my instincts scream to
A frustrated laugh. ‘If you knew…’
‘Draco!’
Leaving them staring at it in bafflement, Harry and Draco bolted away from them. Their steps echoed in the stillness; by the time Harry considered casting a Silencio, it was too late.
he always keeps his promises.’
Her eyes soften. ‘It’s OK, Draco.’ After a brief, poignant pause, she assumes her business-like tone. ‘You’ll need to fill in an application, have a short interview with Fausta, Kingsley’s secretary, and then you may legally talk to Nariyoshi about magic.’ Her smile is encouraging.
‘And you’re walking there?’ Esther asked.
The memory of the Muggles, spellbound and suspended on air, hovered briefly between them. Draco struggled to find words. ‘I— That was—’
Harry had finished his eggs by the time Malfoy sauntered down the stairs, yawning, his hair mussed.
‘You have sauce on your chin.’
‘It’ll always be a home to you, as long as I’m alive. B’ezrat hashem.’
‘You forget I trained as an Auror.’
Malfoy’s voice falls warm on his neck. ‘I can take your darkness, Potter.’
‘You’d gone home.’ Harry keeps his voice even, ensuring there are no accusing tones. ‘How come you knew I had a nightmare?’
‘Where?’ Harry walked further into the trees, eyes darting all around, trying to catch a glimpse of Draco. ‘Where
‘Did something happen to you?’
‘I can’t raise that money in a week,’ Draco says. He can’t raise it in a
Putting all thoughts aside, his scar prickling subtly, a reminder of doom that almost never went away these days, Harry gazed at the empty pillow beside him and wondered where Draco was. He was about to close his eyes, swallowing his disappointment, when the door opened.
. He had a knack of witnessing every cutting indignity, every single embarrassment, every little humiliation that Draco suffered.
It’d keep Draco close to Harry for just a little bit longer.
The book wobbled, rose an inch in the air, and plopped on the floor.
She gave him a wistful smile. ‘You’re not a good liar. But I will hope. And pray for you both to find peace.’
Harry had just about had enough. He set his goblet down. ‘Want to go somewhere more private?’
lay eyes on another mushroom again. ‘D’you want them?’
‘No, I—’ Draco shook his head. ‘Nothing.’ He poured some water onto a ficus and moved to the next plant, but not before casting another look outside. Harry wondered if he was hoping for Melor to appear through the trees — or terrified that Death Eaters would.
‘See, that’s where I’m different. I’d rather bend
They stopped in front of the arched windows facing the oak, and through its branches, the pub. With a precise movement of his wand, Draco broke a dusty glass pane, which fell with a faint clink on the ground. The smell of green leaves rushed in as a cool breeze whistled through the oak. Conversations and laughter drifted from the pub, becoming louder when the door opened. They had to hurry; Draco murmured a spell, and the paper crane sailed across the square and over the heads of the leaving patrons, darting inside.
The relief at being offered a shelter, somewhere warm, somewhere protected, moved Harry deeply. ‘Thank you,’ he said, his heart brimming with gratitude.
‘How thick can you get, Potter? Do you believe we have a say what happens in our house anymore? We live at the pleasure of the Dark Lord. Or not, as the case might be; as you, so helpfully, have witnessed in whatever creepy way you—
Harry picks his wand up and Summons some tissues to wipe his nose. He’s already sniffling, his immune system weakened because of what Draco is.
Malfoy spread open the map on the ground and they both leaned over it. He traced his finger across the routes available to them.
‘Yet.’ Still, Harry handed this glasses to Malfoy and sank briefly under the surface. He rose, shaking his wet hair, and felt Malfoy’s hand on his forearm, pulling him deeper in the reeds, further away from the shore.
. In love, I mean. With you.
‘Does it matter?’
inside her. He wouldn’t be surprised if she became Minister for Magic one day.
‘I might be a little rough with you,’ the dream-Malfoy warns.
On a round table in the middle of the room stands a covered object. Harry flicks his wand and the black velvet rises to reveal the notorious figurine.
. He was simply too weird — too magical — to be left unsupervised, but Harry’s brain provided no immediate solutions as to how to stop this train wreck from happening.

Boot looked at Draco with narrowed eyes, as if Draco had an ulterior motive for being nice, but he accepted his apology. Draco turned to leave, but Boot stopped him. ‘Hey, Malfoy, um… did you see me in there? People are saying all sort of things.’
‘You think I don’t fucking know that?’ Malfoy snarled. The wind whipped his hair around his face, bright even in the darkness. ‘Do you think I don’t know by now what I’ve
Harry had heard of this religion. Uncle Vernon had some choice words to say about it.
‘I wonder how you made it through school,’ Draco continued, ignoring him. He put down the picture frame and picked up a candlestick. ‘Not that your grades were anything to write home about, but even so.’
‘Who?’ Draco asked, face slack in desire.
Harry flicks a sideways glance at him. ‘Perhaps I missed the masterclass in pretentious art talk that Slytherins gave in their common room.’
, and Harry loses himself in ecstasy, his hips erratic, his cock bruising Draco’s throat; a pain Draco welcomes, because he doesn’t
‘Well, it’s a, er, powerful portrait,’ he starts and with some surprise and considerable relief he finds himself interrupted.
Cold contempt met his words. ‘You’re such an arsehole,’ Draco said and stalked away.
Malfoy raises open palms. ‘I know you didn’t,’ he says but it sounds like a lie.
It’s quiet when they’re done. Nariyoshi must have gone to bed. No sound disturbs the peace in the small bedroom but the wind rustling through bare trees outside. Draco places the tray on his desk and feels Potter’s forehead. His colour is better after eating, but he’s warm.
‘I won’t,’ Harry promised, rocking over him. ‘I don’t know how, but I won’t.’
‘Night-blooming jasmine.’ Malfoy smacks his lips after a sip of his mystery vodka. ‘Want a taste?’
‘You look dead on your feet. Go rest and we’ll talk tomorrow. The loft, Dawn, please,’ Esther said and her housekeeper beckoned to them. ‘Come with me.’
‘Truce.’
‘I’m mainly here for Dean.’ Harry points at the artist surrounded by a cluster of people under the infamous
Suppressing his instinct to run out (possibly in the direction of his own cabin for a furious wank), Harry stared outside the window, not that he could see anything but the image of a generous cock that was branded in his brain. Malfoy turned to pick up his breeches and Harry snuck a glance, which resulted in his pressure rising. That arse was a
But he feels merciful. He steps between Potter’s legs, which instantly wrap around him, and kisses him with all the force he can muster. Potter gives as good as he takes. The kiss is positively sinful, deep and messy, while Draco finds Potter’s arsehole and works him open, impatient and ravenous. Potter smells of sweat and sex, his arse is hot and tight, dripping with the lube Draco’s Conjured. Draco swallows each little moan Potter makes with a kiss.
, and Harry switched the channel and they watched; Malfoy in utter thrall. After a few minutes, he leaned towards Harry and whispered, ‘Is this real?’
The man didn’t bother to acknowledge Ron’s outburst. ‘Do you have a name,
‘I’m sure they do,
, son of a Death Eater, who’d taunted Harry for years and who’d willingly joined the most brutal regime Britain had ever known. Harry could picture Mad-Eye Moody rising from the grave to scold him for taking it up with someone who, for all intents and purposes, could well still be a Death Eater.
Harry’s position near the mirror allowed him only a glimpse of Draco’s face, but it was enough to see it now scrunched in pain.
And so mind-numbingly good. Draco, his hand travelling down Harry’s stomach, resumed his slow thrusting. The friction stang a little but with some of Draco’s spit, it became easier.
. An end to his travels with Draco. An end to sharing a bed and waking up next to each other. An end to touching him whenever he wished, as he did now, discreetly slipping his hand in Draco’s. As terrifying as some of their experiences were, he’d miss aspects of these last few days.

‘It’s the
? Is that the best you could come up with?’
‘No.’
Harry barely held back a gasp. Draco kept looking at the duvet and acted as if he hadn’t said anything shocking. Harry had no idea how to respond. He stared at Draco’s bent head, the hair falling in his eyes. ‘I saw

he told himself. Draco is a colleague. Not his partner, but a colleague, nonetheless. This is what people do when their colleagues get abducted.
‘I can make it, Nariyoshi. Don’t get up, please.’ Draco opens his bedroom door and ushers Potter in.
‘So the Shack wants to be a haven?’ he asked.
Nurse Burbage doesn’t call Bob a “dear” any more, but “Sir”.
‘Of course.’
‘To?’
He hated more how much he missed him.
The fact they were meant to leave soon weighed on everyone’s mind. Harry could see it in the wistfulness in Esther’s smile and Dawn’s examining gaze. It was written all over Draco’s face, a sharp longing to stay in the cottage mixed with the abject terror that he’d be found. The appearance of the owl had shaken them both. It brought with it not just a letter but also a tangible reminder that their world was out there, clamouring for their return.
Draco held tight to Harry’s arm. ‘If he doesn’t know They live in these woods, then yes.’
‘Draco!’ Nariyoshi chastises, but Mrs Li stands. ‘He’s right. I’ve kept you to myself for too long. Draco, a word?’
‘Jealous you can’t cast a Lumos this strong, Malfoy?’
‘What kind of question is that?’
Soon, Draco was calling Weasley and Longbottom by their first name, doing his Arithmancy homework with Hermione, practising Quidditch with Hufflepuffs, and having long conversations with Luna Lovegood, who turned out to have the shrewdest mind he’d encountered. Breakfasts were reserved for chatting with Pansy and Blaise, and he relished seeing his friends unencumbered by the melancholy that plagued them in real life. Muggleborns and purebloods studied together, played together and laughed together, and if Draco didn’t get all the Muggle references they threw around, well—he had the rest of his life to learn them.
The polished front door opened to a bright hallway. Chirping and fluttering came from the room on his right. Draco peeked in and let out a stunned gasp.
Draco had to swallow hard at the sight of Harry’s cock, long and beautiful and leaking. ‘Come here,’ he said hoarsely to Harry, who obliged. Back in Draco’s arms, Harry felt solid and warm and
Instead, Harry approached him. ‘This is for you.’
And then his scar split open and he dropped to his knees, crying in pain.
, Ron had said, not that they could seek it tonight. Escaping Death Eaters only to fall off a cliff in the dark didn’t sound like a clever idea.
When he returned to bed, he stayed as far from Draco as he could. Why did Harry have to be seventeen? Nearing seventy, Voldemort probably didn’t have to deal with inconvenient boners, getting in the way of his taking over the world. It was fucking unfair.
‘Bob?’ The man is startled in laughter. It’s short-lived, as if he’s forgotten how to do it. ‘I dare say, I don’t look like a
A few laughed at this. Some spat on the ground.
Sunlight streamed through the curtains they always forgot to shut properly and bathed the bed in translucent ivory tones. Harry buried his face in Draco’s neck, committing the smell of his skin to memory; a talisman to take with him when they would eventually leave this place, and Harry would go back to his mission. If time stopped, this could be Harry’s life: a life of home-cooked meals, kind ladies and verdant, fairy-infested forest. Mundane chores to pass the day and Draco Malfoy in his bed to spend the night. Uncomplicated, unhurried joy. A pang of longing tore through Harry for the life he couldn’t have.
‘This is good,’ Draco agrees, unbuttoning his jeans. He wrestles them off, kicking them to the clay-splattered floor along with his pants, and stands nude and aroused in front of Potter, who promptly falls to his knees and swallows Draco’s cock like a starving man.
A solitary cottage stood on the far shore. With a crack, Rookwood Disapparated and Dolohov performed a Sonorous. ‘Hey, Malfoy Junior,’ he said. ‘Show yourself. Hand over Potter, if you have him. If you come home, all will be forgiven. If you don’t, well… the Master has promised to kill your parents. And you
Harry dares a look, but the corpse has vanished and the blood is gone.
‘People make up all sorts of rumours,’ he says, managing to keep his face neutral.
, Potter. Let’s survive the troll and you can touch whatever you want later.’
The night sounds returned, comforting and familiar: a nightingale singing from a branch above them, the hooting of an owl, the whispering of the wind through the tree leaves. A dog barked; nearby a window creaked open, a child’s voice drifting from inside.
But he restrained himself. His destination was far more enticing than the ephemeral pleasure of feeding from a passer-by. He took out the note and read it again. Then, he hailed a cab.
Potter’s in such ecstasy that the energy pouring from him to feed Draco is sizzling, a live wire. He can’t wait much longer either. With a twist of his hand, a thumb on the wet slit of Potter’s swollen prick, Draco whispers, ‘Come for me, Potter.’ Potter sobs, he literally
Draco
They daren’t take the coast path for fear of coming across magical folk so they walked through fields and grassland until they reached a forest of elms. The foliage provided welcome cover. Harry exhaled with some relief when he crept under the canopy, happy to be less exposed but also alert for the presence of any more of the Fair Folk.
‘This is a little public,’ he murmured against his lips, when Harry rubbed his cock against his, causing him to groan.
‘The figurine?’ Draco speaks with indifference, but inside he’s frozen. He might not necessarily need Mrs Li’s money for Nariyoshi anymore, but he
‘Malfoy?’ Harry turns in wild disbelief, his heart pounding.
Malfoy didn’t reply. He threw the last few pieces of bread in the lake, and turned to stare at the distant cottage. ‘You think those Muggles are really dead?’
Mrs Li laughs. ‘It’s powerful enough to justify
, standing right there, being thoroughly obnoxious,’ he added, because his heart beat frantically, and Harry’s expression had softened and deepened at the same time.
Arguing about it was futile. Harry knew that war was upon them. He’d seen the pillaged villages at the north border. Refugees arrived at the capital every day, bringing word of Emperor Riddle’s atrocities. The sorcerers Riddle had at his disposal exceeded the power of any practitioner of magic in Gryffenland, but the island kingdom of Harry’s betrothed was renowned for their magical knowledge. Stories abounded about underground libraries, built into the rock of the main capital, the shelves brimming with books of arcane spells.
‘Oh, Draco,’ Pansy said, ‘why didn’t you tell me? I thought you were just being odd.’
‘Then you’re awake,’ she shrugged. ‘Are you okay? Harry mentioned something about a stray curse that hit you?’
from the cottage? Were they in Cornwall, perhaps within walking distance to Tinworth, or did they end up in Wales or, Merlin forbid,
In the kitchen, Draco puts the kettle to boil. Nariyoshi took him in and gave him a job despite the fact that Draco had no ID or CV or any other initials that Muggle jobs require. Draco had been out of Azkaban for a few months by then. His mother had just died, his property had been seized long before, his vault emptied, and no one in the magical world would hire an ex-con, especially one whose name was Malfoy.
Draco strode towards the direction of the city, and Harry followed. ‘This is what I mean,’ he said with a gesture that encompassed the station behind them, the small harbour in the distance, the shops nearby. ‘No Death Eater knows anything about Muggle things. Fridges and tellies and, I don’t know, whatever these are.’
Draco stared at him, but nothing else was forthcoming. ‘What were you expecting?’ he asked in the end.
Draco cleared his throat, sitting up stiffly. ‘First, I’d like to offer my apologies, Harry.’ He took on a formal tone, his pronounced posh diction at odds with his white tee and Oxfam parka. ‘Trust me when I say I’m truly sorry for what I said and did at school. All of it.’ Draco held himself rigid, hands interlaced on the table, and Harry wondered if he’d been taught to apologise in this way or if it was the awkwardness of it that had Draco retreat into the manners of his upbringing. ‘You must see, I’d never been rejected before. One hadn’t learned how to deal with not having what one wanted, and that naturally led to feelings of resentment. For the attention you received; your rule-breaking, which bore
, and interrupted Harry's babbling with a long kiss.
. If he’d had any doubts about his sexuality, they’d be gone now. Harry pressed his eyes shut. What was
It sounds so tempting. So
‘The what now?’
‘C’mon,’ Harry nudged Malfoy, ‘we need to get away before he decides to check behind the station.’
Malfoy huffed, cold and contemptuous, his eyes on his aunt’s knife. ‘Will you kill me, Potter?’ he asked, his voice taunting. Malfoy had never been that good of an actor; the trembling of his hands and his shallow breathing belied his uncertainty in Harry’s benevolent nature.
There was one more thing he needed to do before the day was out. After Charms, where Harry sat next to him and rubbed his thigh, making Draco perform the worst he ever had in Charms (‘Mr Malfoy, you seem distracted today!’), Draco visited the Headmistress to allow him to Floo home. Their ability to leave castle during the week, provided they’d obtained permission, was another Eighth Year perk.
He turns left on the twisting side road, under an arch, and then right. The casino’s wards flash neon-bright as he steps through and knocks on the door. He now knows how useless his glamour was. These wards can see through glamours and Polyjuice, Disillusionment and Invisibility Cloaks. No one can hide from the Lis, while they remain hidden from the sight of everyone, except from their clients and those invited by them.
, the voice inside his head whispers. It’s not like this is forever. Not when Draco proves he can’t be trusted. Not when he betrays Potter so thoroughly.
Draco trembles, and Harry grabs his wrist firmly. ‘Don’t run out again. Don’t run out on us.
with.’ He’s so close now that the whole of Draco’s skin burns with barely restrained desire — both his and Potter’s.
‘I’d better change.’ Harry stands. ‘Thanks for the tea.’
,’ Draco gasps.
Harry nods, his expression unreadable.
Harry slid a second finger, increasing the pace and watching Draco as he quivered, looking delectable. Draco was beautiful and sharp and witty; and he was
She arched her lovely eyebrows at the question and frowned in thought. ‘I’m not sure. Never really considered it. Perhaps Hermione will know.’
‘Didn’t hear you. You left me to order and this is what I ordered for you.’
‘Indeed it is. The gold coins have not been found and some speculate that theft was the reason behind the fire. The locals are concerned, especially in regards with another baffling crime: the unusual circumstances surrounding the deaths of John Oakes and Jeremy Stevens at the rental cottage by Dozmary Pool on Sunday evening.’
In Potter’s bed, Draco makes good on his promise. He undresses Potter slowly, he strokes him with feathery, almost-there touches, and he licks him so thoroughly and slowly that Potter’s a quivering mess by the end of it. Then, Draco enters him from behind, holding him tight, pressing their bodies as close as possible, and thrusts deep and slow, whispering praise in Potter’s ear, how lovely and sweet he is, how much he likes to fuck him, until Potter comes with a muffled cry on his sheets. He can’t speak for some time. Draco’s worry that he might have drained him too much turns out to be unfounded. Potter seems in high spirits once he regains his brain function.
‘Your parents are alive.’
‘And I’ll be your Watson,’ Draco says, gasping as Harry reaches lower between his legs. ‘I’ll live with you in a cottage and call myself Bob, and write books about Harry Potter and his adventures.’ His eyes flutter shut as Harry strokes him harder. ‘We’ll live by the coast and take long walks during the day, and at night, you’ll come into my bed —
‘Can’t stand to see the man you almost killed?’
Draco pushed his head under the spray and stopped listening. A lead weight wrapped around his heart, dragging it under the mire of his bottomless regret. He splayed his palm on the tiles, staring at his fingers, and tried to ignore the niggling feeling of being an impostor. A fraud. Tears ran down his cheeks, luckily invisible to everyone else. He wanted nothing more than to be who they thought he was, but he should have known better than to assume the absence of the Mark solved anything. What good was it to have a different past here when he
, that’s all.’ She must notice Draco’s lack of comprehension and continues. ‘It’s the most powerful shield in the world. The right incantation can connect it to a household — any group of people — and it’ll absorb all Dark curses or hexes aimed at the family or tribe. It’s the ultimate protection.’
he prayed.
Harry’s heart beat frantically. If Malfoy did actually try to Summon his lord, then Harry would have to— incapacitate him in some way. His body tensed in anticipation of a fight.
Draco had heard of a pub run by Death Eater sympathisers, but it took some wandering before they found it.
Harry stretched his hand, wordlessly asking for it, and Draco, reluctant, handed it over. Examining it closely, Harry whistled in awe. The crack in the side was almost gone. The wand was knitting itself together; extraordinary.
