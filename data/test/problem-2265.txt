Alex seemed to wrestle with a thought. Something they felt they didn't have the authority or closeness to say. They wanted to get their question out, but it was impossible when their career relied on Harry.
The room was silent again. This time, the silence was uncomfortable. Harry hated that. They had been doing so well. Two weeks of nothing and they had finally managed to make a joke and do something together. He couldn't let their bit of progress be ruined. He tried to think of something else to talk about, something to bring the mood back. His eyes went down to the noodles and he got an idea. “Do you know how to tell when the noodles are ready?”
Demgass cracked a sad smile. “Again, I’m very sorry about this situation. You both deserve so much better.”
Harry was so surprised he nearly dropped a hot pan of eggs onto himself. He looked at Draco with wide eyes while his cheeks and the tops of his exposed shoulders turned red.
In the end, Draco put away the wine and Harry washed the glasses. They made their way down the hall and toward the bedrooms, but before they could say goodnight to each other, Harry gripped the sleeve of Draco’s shirt with flushed cheeks and a downward gaze.
He laid there a bit awkwardly, momentarily distracted by how peaceful the other looked. He gently shook the boy awake. “Draco? Wake up, come on love. It’s Christmas.”
“I regret casting locomotor mortis.” He blinked a few times and tried to stop himself. But there was no way. He finally looked up and let his eyes flicker around to look them all in their eyes. “I wish it had been the killing curse. I wanted to kill him. But if he ever is found dead then it wasn’t me, because if it was, you’d never have found his body in the first place.” As much as they might have wanted to look away from him, they couldn’t. He unnerved them all but was just intriguing enough to hold their full attention.
Harry blinked a few times and worried he might have made a mistake. “Apologies, I was under the impression that Alex went by gender-neutral pronouns.”
“Uh, a little over a year?” Alex sounded incredibly unsure about themself. Nobody was ever interested in them, only about getting the interview over with.
She set a hand on his shoulder and smiled at him. Her eyes sparkling with pride for what he’s done. “I know you won’t. I know you’ll do good things. I’m so proud of you, Draco. Before you leave at the end of the year, stop by the hospital wing. I have a book I’ve been writing. It’s all my medical knowledge in one mostly organized journal. I want you to have it. You’ll need to study it if you want to run the hospital wing one day.”
Draco complied and slowly sank his hips in the rest of the way. He was buzzing with excitement from being surrounded by Harry. He was entirely overwhelmed. He was in awe that he was inside someone as lovely as Harry. It was warm, wet, and it was all his. His back was arched and he was softly panting from the squeeze alone. He’d almost forgotten how good it felt to be inside of someone else. Still, he’d always have a preference for being the one taking it.
“Well, I suppose it started on Friday, when the thing with the Black properties happened.” That got a nod from Ron and Hermione, who knew about the situation in general, although they were unaware of what happened afterwards.
Fourth Year was also when the more extreme pranks began. Lily wrote tirelessly about all the annoying pranks they were involved in.
Something about that made Harry smile. “I suppose it is. Go ahead and taste the sauce, see if it’s any good.” He instructed as he turned the cooker off and went to set the table.
Harry shook his head, a bit annoyed at how often he’s asked this. Just about everyone who flirts with him asks, and given that he’s the ‘chosen one’, a lot of people flirt with him. “Yes, I am.”
Harry looked up and put the journal down, Draco was about to say something else until he saw Harry’s face. His cheeks were blotchy and his eyes were overflowing with tears.
Last was physical touch. Harry tried little things such as holding Draco’s hand while they sat in the common room together, brushing against him while they walked, and of course, he inevitably gave Draco a couple more blowjobs. But that was mostly because he enjoys it just as much as Draco does.
The blonde let a small smirk take over and he leaned forward. “What about me?” He was ever-so-slightly smug about the answer.
Harry shivered from his own aftershocks, as well as the cleaning spell running over somewhere so sensitive. While Draco was sitting back, he couldn’t help but to glance over the bare torso that was finally revealed to him. There was nothing in particular that made it so attractive. But because it was part of Draco, he loved it.
Harry only sipped his hot chocolate. “It’s too early for this.” Really, it was just a lame excuse to try to cope with the way Draco's flirting worked on him.
Draco went from the expectations he had to live up to as a kid, the ideals of his parents that he questioned, the unhesitating wrath of his aunt Bellatrix if he questioned their beliefs, his struggle with his sexuality, how he questioned his own friends, his struggle with his identity, his breakdowns and self-loathing, all the way to the day Harry showed up to court and saved him.
Harry smiled nervously. The smile lasted about two seconds before he gave in. “I was with Hermione in the library. She wanted to do some research.”
“We will now hear from Mr. Potter and Mrs. Granger on behalf of The Cupboard Project.” The Head Warlock announced as the meeting came to order.
That Saturday, Draco went to hang out with his mother. They mostly walked around shops together and spoke about their lives. She was excited to finally hear that Draco and Harry are together, she also insisted that Draco bring Harry along next month. She finalized her plans to make Draco her sole beneficiary and considered talking to Andromeda. She wanted to rekindle their relationship and get to know Teddy. Although her and Andromeda will never see eye-to-eye on everything, they’re sisters, and she wants to have a relationship.
After some small talk with the director, he asked about the sleeping arrangements put in place by the Ministry. After all, it was their idea to send an Auror. Once word got out about Harry’s newest mess, the Ministry had a fit. They assigned Draco to stay in Romania "until further notice", which he knew could imply years. Aurors were typically sent on missions that would last months or years, but with the ability to Floo home, it wasn't that bad. It was only a matter of time before Draco received his first long mission, and here it was.
Draco raised an eyebrow, "Why wait a few days?" Though he didn't say anything about it, he was unsurprised that Harry broke the rules to save dragon eggs.
Draco gave a silent nod before finally saying what he's wanted to for years, “Thanks for speaking at my trail. You saved my arse.”
When his father’s birthday came around on the thirtieth, Harry spoke extensively about him with the Marauders. He wanted to know everything. What his favorite subjects were, when he and Lily started dating, who James dated before Lily, his favorite pranks, his strategies in Quidditch, how he reacted when he found out Lily was pregnant with him.
Draco noticed the change in Harry very quickly. Having their late night conversations invaded by books was something he wasn't quite fond of, “Seems you’ve become quite the Ravenclaw, Harry. Always got your nose in a book.”
The blonde's silence prompted Harry to continue, but he could see the other's lifted spirits. "For starts, I have a lot going on at work. I need to get through a few things before I can give you the attention and time you deserve. I also need to work on myself a bit. I'm not saying I have to fill every hole and pick up every broken piece, that just isn't realistic. I'll never be completely healed and that's okay. I just need to figure out how to leave most of my baggage in the past. I still have bridges to burn. If I were to be with you, I need to be someone who can dedicate more time and energy than what I have, and I need to learn to take care of myself before I can take care of you too."
Neville chuckled, “Oh come on, Ron, you’re good at it too. It just, it makes sense to me. I’ve got a niche for it I suppose.”
Harry looked up at Draco and blushed when the blonde leaned over him to pin his wrists by either side of his head. He instinctively squirmed to see if he could break free. He was stuck. A wave of arousal washed over him and he was hard in his pants.
Draco raised an eyebrow, “Embarrassed, Potter? I know with your fame and status, you think yourself too refined to have such carnal desires. But if I remember correctly, I didn’t even have my hands on you five minutes and you were a horny wreck.”
Draco silently walked over to the bed and laid down beside Harry. He wanted to wrap his arms around the boy, but he didn’t. He wasn’t sure if Harry was interested in him. But all those letters, the poetry, the complements, how close they were, it had to mean something. All those beautiful things that Harry’s told him, they all went rushing through his head. He closed his eyes as his chest tightened, the doubt and uncertainty was killing him.
When counting up the votes secured by Crow and Pansy, there was no doubt that Pawk's bill would pass. But with his department, Harry wasn't so sure. He knew that the attack and the story about to be published would boost it's favor. He also knew that most of the opposition had given up, but he just couldn't help but to worry. Still, he was in no position to try to leverage people to ensure his own votes. Maybe his days of political chess were over. Quite frankly, that didn't upset him. He was unbothered with becoming like Voldemort. He'd used the man's press and political tactics, but managed to get it done without the use of magic. After all that, he was unmoved. He didn't care about the fear and damage he had caused. He didn't care that he doing what the man who killed his parents had done. It meant nothing to him. But that meaninglessness was the only thing that made him uncomfortable. He wanted to be bothered by his own actions, but he just wasn't. He was okay with what he had done and he didn't like that, or at least, he didn't want to be so okay with it. He couldn't be bothered to feel any particular emotion when thinking about what he had done.
“I think I should stick to more vanilla things for now. You know how I like my men ..... tied up and helpless. You’re as wild as a stallion, Harry, and I’d like to break you before I ride you.” He winked as he set his clothes aside, standing naked before Harry. “Undress.”
One day, he approached Draco with a single azalea. It was bright and pink, so he thought Draco might like it since he does like flowers.
Narcissa gave a small smile. She admired how real Lily and James’ love was. She admired how real Draco and Harry’s love is. It was something she knew she’ll never had. She did love Lucius once, and he loved her money and power. She made her mistakes, but she would never let Draco do as she or Lucius did. That mattered more to her than bloodlines or appearance. “You love him. You really love each other. It’s so genuine and true, a lot of people in our old circles never had that. Everyone always married for money and power. Don’t be like us, please. If you really love this boy, I want you to be with him. As long as you love him, I’ll always wish you both the best.”
Harry shifted again, unaware of how seductive the movements of his arse looked to the boy behind him.
"You are, after all, tied up and at my mercy. I could blow your mind and leave you trembling with an orgasm, or, I could keep you up all night until you're crying for release. It's really up to you."
Lunch was grand and fun. Quail eggs, cheeses, caviar, salmon, and wine. For dessert, they had tiramisu, Draco’s only weakness.
His mother had confirmed that only she would be visiting to talk to McGonagall. So Draco was nervous about how she would feel about talking to him instead.
At first, Harry didn’t respond much. He was focused on his breathing. In and out. It took him a moment to realize he was breathing in time to Draco’s finger. He was greatly embarrassed by that. He kept breathing while Draco’s finger went back farther and in deeper. At some point, he realized soft whimpers were dripping from his breaths and he wondered for how long he had been making noise.
Draco nearly melted at the way he felt Harry’s body give in to him. Being let in deeper, it sent a shiver through his body and made him throb in his pants. Harry was letting him in. It was an intoxicating realization. He was overjoyed to receive such an honor.
He took his seat and sighed, trying to figure out how to explain the past few weeks. “Remember those stories in the paper that Harry never corrected, about how he was abused?”
He could say that he’s never loved someone like this, that he’s never felt this way before, or say that he just knows in his heart that he’s in love. But this was different. He knew the very moment he fell in love with Draco. “When I was a kid, I used to imagine what my future might be like. I had a thousand fantasies in my head. That was how I coped with the abuse. I thought of the future. When I realized I probably wouldn’t have a future, it killed me. When I lived anyways, thinking of the future became how I coped with loss. Even when I knew I wanted to teach DADA I still thought of all the hundreds of amazing days I’ll have here. But now, now when I think of the future I only think of one. Spending the rest of my days teaching here,
The blonde gave a sheepish smile and nodded. "I like it well enough." He tilted his head and the corners of his mouth faltered. "Why?" His plan had been to get Harry whiny and desperate, and then to rub up against each other until they finished, but now he got the feeling that things might not go as planned.
One day, Draco bursted into his and Harry’s dorm. His face was red and blotchy, tears were rolling down his cheeks, and he looked a mix of angry and sad.
The blonde rolled his eyes but his face soon tended up from all the pleasure his body was receiving. “If you don’t stop teasing, I won’t ride you.”
With March being halfway over, things were getting stressful in the common room. Only two months left to prepare for N.E.W.T.S and classes were getting harder. Seventh year students with Ministry aspirations, which were most of them, were under more stress than ever. But for Harry and Draco, things were still calm. While their friends studied extensively in their little spot on the couches by the fireplace, Harry and Draco would read at their own leisure and have quiet conversations that usually led to excessive flirting. It was driving their friends up a wall to have to sit there and listen to their mumbling, see their blushes, catch their flirty gazes, and hear their embarrassed giggles.
Harry walked up to the door and hesitated, wondering if maybe he should turn back. His nerves about being turned away were lighting up inside his brain.
Teddy tried to go for the glasses again, but Harry quickly distracted him with one of his toys. A rattle shaped like a wand. Cute.
The first was about the attack, which he dismissed as a standard sort of news. But the second had he and Harry on the cover, with a headline about their relationship.
He messed his hair up a bit again, and then decided to put his hair back in it’s usual formal style. He decided it was best that way.
The blonde's cheeks went pink and he almost seemed to huff, as if protesting his own softness. "I didn't know I did all that."
Exactly two years later and Draco found himself pinned under a Romanian Longhorn with bright violet eyes.
Draco pulled back and cupped Harry’s face. “Look me in my eyes, Potter.” He didn’t. “Harry.” Draco spoke in a firmer tone, but Harry was staring off, beginning to disassociate again. “Harry!”
Then, McGonagall came in, leading a group of about forty first years. Harry supposed most of his classmates who survived the war, and would-be classmates, must have transferred to other schools.
Now, they were so used to just being friends that they were scared to take the next step forward. Again they were complacent with what they had and where they were. They figured it was better to be friends than suffer rejection and ruin what they had. Especially now that the war was over, after all they been through, after all they lost, and how they’d grown together. They figured it was better to just take what they still had.
Draco wanted to be what Harry needed. He wanted to be there if Harry wanted to talk, hold him if he wanted to cry, make him laugh if he wanted to be cheered up, and he would talk all night if Harry wanted a distraction. But he didn’t know how to say it.
Draco raised his eyebrows at the sight and couldn’t help but to grin. “Expect to get undressed today?”
He hurried inside and sat on the sofa, almost fearful of what it might say, but that fear only staled and dissolved within himself. Even though it was the media that inspired the attack against him, he couldn't find himself able to fear what it said anymore. Nothing else could be done to him. It detailed a rumor that had come about Harry's time in Wizengamot, when he was being examined as a suspect. The rumor being that he and Draco were married.
He found them at the bar, though it was only the afternoon. He sat a few seats down from them a got a drink before they noticed him. They greeted him with smiles and a few niceties. After a bit of small talk, he turned the conversation to politics and brought up Pawk.
That statement sent a shiver down Harry’s spine. He wasn’t worried, per se, but he was a bit intimidated. After all, Draco did have much more experience than him. He had no problem with the idea of flirting back, and maybe making it a fun little thing between them, but he knew he wouldn’t be as good as the other. Nevertheless, he was a bit excited to have Draco on the hunt. He wanted to be pursued.
“Bother me?! Please tell me! Harry, you highly overestimate my elegance and grace. I, too, have desires. I have a lot of desires. I want to touch you so bad. Never think you’ll bother me. I don’t care if you run into the hospital wing while I’m treating someone. Tell me!”
“You’re so desperate.” Draco mumbled as he leaned back down and kissed the other side of Harry’s neck.
Draco nodded at Pomfrey and then approached Neville. “What the hell did that bloody idiot do this time?”
After they cleaned up all evidence of their stay, they stood before the Floo with their bags. Draco used his newfound boldness to make a move, just a small one for starts. He set a hand on Harry's shoulder, which is the most physical contact they'd had in their entire relationship. "Thank you, Harry. This really meant a lot to me." He could feel the adoration coming from his own gaze and he didn't even attempt to correct himself. The small flush on Harry's cheeks told him the other could feel it as well.
Now Harry was the one who was surprised. He genuinely didn't expect the conversation to be so serious and formal. He expected some teasing and maybe a bit of messing around, but the fact that Draco took it seriously was strangely flattering. "Oh, well. Uhm. I haven't really done much so, I-I don't know. Uh. Could you go first?"
As they walked to the library they spoke in hushed voices. “So, you and Draco are getting pretty close.”
In reality, he knew where they were. The afterlife that he’s learned about seemed like it would be a good place for them. If you go where you deserve, then they certainly are somewhere good as they died trying to save the world. They deserved the best.
They sounded like proud parents. As they laid together, their words eventually muddled into silent slumber.
“Harry, he’s small-minded. He doesn’t see the big picture, only temporary success and gratification. Not to mention his hubris. He’s too arrogant, and that leads to mistakes.”
Draco scoffed in response. “Blue?! Of course not! They’re green like jade Zinnia with light brown surrounding his pupil and a dark blue limbal ring.”
Harry's grin was the dorkiest thing he'd ever seen, the way his hair was full of snow and stuck in a million directions from the wind bothered him, and his runny nose made Draco want to gag. Some stupid crush didn't change the way he felt about those things, but somehow, he also thought it was weirdly charming. Harry was no Greek god or paragon of male beauty, he was so flawed and he wore each one on his sleeve, and it was charming to Draco because he couldn't dismiss it. Harry's flaws couldn't be overlooked, they demanded attention but they still looked so cute. This was Harry, flawed and free.
He continued to please Draco, and let his other hand begin to roam. He cupped Draco’s cheek and stroked it with the pad of his thumb. His eyes went to the blonde’s pink and plump lips that were taking in and exhaling ragged breaths. He slid his thumb down to play with his lower lip. He drug Draco’s lower lip down and then let it fall back into place. Gorgeous.
“I can’t believe you stood there and let that prat flirt with you.” Draco grumbled as he crawled on top of Harry. “I bet he’d never do this.” He leaned down and pressed a kiss to Harry’s lips. He knew it was selfish of him to want Harry all to himself, but he didn’t care. After all this time of everyone flirting with the one man he wants, he figured he deserved to be selfish.
“But I love it when you’re turned on. The best things happen when you’re turned on. Don’t you remember just a few days ago when you humped my thigh until you came in your pants? We could always do that again.”
“Who gave you the hickey?” Pansy asked with a raised eyebrow and a smirk. She suspected it was Draco. She really wanted it to be Draco. She didn’t care for Harry’s dismissive response and instead, was eager to learn the full truth of the situation.
Harry bit his lip and squirmed as he got a sinister idea. “I really shouldn’t have. I shouldn’t have been so rough. I should have kept you there, trapped in pleasure, the way you sound and move is so breathtaking and sinful. Next time, I won’t make the same mistake. I’ll keep you locked away in hedonism for as long as I can.” His voice was dripping with desire and came out as a slight growl.
Every year he would get a slew of questions in the beginning by students who went ahead and binged the chapter on Harry and the war. He would also receive questions throughout the start of the spring term, when it was actually time for the first years to study the chapter. He didn’t mind answering them, and as repeated questions arose, he made suggestions for an updated version of the textbook.
Harry laid down and his fingers immediately began fiddling with the sheets as he watched Draco look in his trunk for something. He pulled out a book, flipped through it, and then put it back before returning to Harry.
With that, their terror turned into an appreciation that bordered on obsession. They wanted to preserve the bubble that they existed in. So in their afternoon they became inseparable. Draco picked back up on his writing and Harry held him and watched from over his shoulder. His mouth was pressed to the blonde's shoulder and the body in his arms warmed him. Out of pure curiosity, he let a hand reach up to play with Draco's hair. It was soft and his fingers twirled around strands of hair. It was more like a scalp massage in that his fingertips slid through his hair and teased the strands.
Draco shook his head. "That's good, but used. Yuletide, remember?" He thought a moment, playing around with the idea in his head. "What about two acquaintances from Hogwarts who meet a few years later, become friends, and then fall in love?"
The blonde raised an eyebrow before letting a satisfied look settle over his face. “Good with your hands, yea?” He bit his lip, enjoying the way the other turned red and looked away. “That’s what I thought.”
Harry woke up with a groan, stretching and listening to his joints pop. He frowned and twisted, letting out a surprised moan when his lower back popped. A sigh left him as he relaxed and tried to fall back asleep.
Especially when Draco started his unofficial apprenticeship with Madam Pomfrey, he needed a bit of homework help since he had less time to do everything. Harry would also sneak food from meals so that Draco would have something to snack on after he came back from the hospital wing.
“Pansy! Y-You, why-“ Harry cut himself off, completely thrown off by what she said. He had no idea how to respond to such an unexpected confession. He was almost a bit overwhelmed by the fact the most of his friends were willing to sleep with him.
“I didn’t say you were winning.” He sat up and looked indignant at the implication that he was losing.
Draco helped Harry stand and gave McGonagall a sad look. “I should probably take him to the hospital wing for a while.”
Maybe it was because of his confessions, maybe it was because of the way Draco held him, but everything had changed and Harry couldn't resist. He let himself fall into the new feelings and surrender had never felt so sweet.
The words sounded like a demand and Harry turned red. No one had ever said anything like that to him and it turned him on more than he’d like to admit. “Alright then.” He stayed still, unsure of what Draco wanted to do.
"Why don't we start from the beginning, how did you come upon the three eggs and how did you hatch them?" Draco asked as he sat down behind the desk.
Draco smirked through his gasps and he knew exactly what the moan had done to Harry. So he let more out. “So good, Harry. You’re doing so good.” He rolled his hips in time with Harry’s hand.
Harry couldn't help but to crack a smile. "I'd love to." He stood up and mumbled something about changing clothes as he went down the hall.
Arthur read ahead once again, this time with a satisfied smile on his face. “So the goblins've been looking through the old laws to try to figure out what to do with the titles and property, since Voldemort is dead and heirless. Ah, the article brings up how the oaths and laws used by Voldemort are incredibly outdated and haven’t been used in centuries. It mentions that Minister Shacklebolt plans to revisit the old laws and have them dissolved so this can’t happen again.” He read ahead some more, intending to summarize the next section of the article, until he read something that made him go pale.
Draco only smirked, “Jealous that other men have touched my ethereal blonde hair?” He would never let Harry live down his love letter.
He walked away and retreated to his own room, putting on his pajamas and sitting on the edge of his bed. He was exhausted. He laid under his own duvet and curled up into the fetal position, closing his eyes. His own body heat warming the duvet as he slowly fell asleep.
He'll never forget the day that he, a fifteen year old, came along to his parents and told them he was gay. They were fine with it, but that night his father asked him over and over if he was certain that he
Harry's coat and shirt had lifted, getting snow on his lower stomach. He could also feel a little snow in his trousers. "I'm cold and I'm absolute shit at sledding. How do I keep falling and hitting rocks? Why don't you ever fall?"
McGonagall filled in for Harry’s last class, letting the students sit and work on their homework for the period.
“This is so much better than quills!” He exclaimed. “It would’ve made note-taking so much easier if we had these in Hogwarts.”
Ron’s jaw dropped and then his expression slowly changed to a mix of concern and horror, “I haven’t seen you smile since Christmas.” He spoke softly, but it was loud enough that everyone heard it.
They all parted ways in the Station. Ron and Hermione to their house, Luna to meet up with Rolf, Pansy to her new flat, Dean and Seamus to their’s, Neville to find Hannah, and Harry and Draco to their new home.
The meal was simple and he returned to Narcissa with two servings of beans and rice. They ate in silence and a simple spell was used to take care of the dirty dishes.
He only shrugged. “Anything for the man who helped me finally see right.” He said as he adjusted his glasses in reference to the Christmas Eve spell. “I’m glad you like it. Should we get out some plates and start eating?” He wasn’t sure if Draco was hungry or not.
The next day, Draco didn’t even realize he woke up in a different place from where he had fallen asleep. He was unaware until he was getting ready to meet his mother for lunch. As he walked by the couch to go to the Floo, he realized that he had fallen asleep on the couch, but woke up in bed. It was a matter that he decided could wait until later.
Harry smirked and he pulled back a bit and focused his mouth on the first two inches of Draco while his hand jerked off the rest. He brought down his other hand to fondle and squeeze Draco’s balls. He let out a few soft moans to give Draco some vibrations, and could feel the boy shatter in his hands.
They started off sitting next to each other. It was perfectly casual and friendly. But as conversation went on, they got closer and closer. In the end, Draco had his head in Harry’s lap, and Harry was leaned across the couch so his head rested on the armrest while his legs still fell off the couch at his knees. Meanwhile, Draco’s legs hung off the other armrest. It wasn’t exactly romantic, but it was something that signaled they weren’t just casual friends. They were something closer than that.
Draco’s breath was stolen and he gave in to the demand without thought, mindless and obedient to the divine display before him. He let himself move harder and faster inside the boy, the slap of skin getting louder as his gasps were overcome by groans and whines. He could already feel the tingling anticipation of the edge. If not for his mind being clouded by desire, he might have felt embarrassed by how quickly Harry got him there.
“No. This isn’t your fault. This isn’t your fault in the slightest. You couldn't've have known this would happen.” He didn’t want Demgass to feel responsible. In fact, he never even considered that any blame should be placed on the goblin. “This isn’t about the wine anyways, this is about the war. He would’ve found a way to hurt us regardless.” Harry paused a moment, realizing why Demgass had arrived. “You must be in charge of the marital contract, then.”
She raised an eyebrow, but decided not to comment on it. Then she changed her mind and did comment on it, "One day you two might be living together. How are you suppose to live with him while he dresses up nice every day?
Draco relished every sound that came from Harry's room. He heard the ends of his whines start to become shaky as he got closer to the end. The noises then changed to long and low groans, unfiltered and raw. This new sound dripped in pleasure and need. He bit his lip and could tell that Harry was getting close. He shivered at how vocal Harry was. It was a turn on of his to have a loud partner. Hearing Harry drove him mad. He loved how beautiful Harry’s voice became when laced with desperation and pleasure. He blinked in surprise when he realized he was developing quite a problem in his pants.
“You can. You do it on purpose. You’re evil.” He whined, no longer in the mood for serious conversation.
"Then make him the leader of your opposition. With a weak leader, they'll eventually succumb to restlessness and their organization will collapse. In their disorganization, it'll be easier to sway the unsure members to your side" She sighed. "But how?"
They wanted anything but to let their thoughts wander, and Harry desperately needed to be distracted. They didn’t want to be sad, they just wanted to get through the night.
Harry let sounds roll from his lips and thought nothing of them. Meaningless syllables that were heavy with pleasure, occasionally Draco’s name, and a rare swear. His body was done with the pain. All that was left was a slight discomfort and pleasure. “I’m good, Draco. Move.”
“About an hour ago, I learned that those three men are Remus Lupin, Sirius Black, and my father, James Potter.”
She said she ought to go home and retire to bed. The day had worn her out, but she planned to visit Astoria the next morning.
Draco blinked and his expression changed to one of concern. “Hey, it’s alright. We don’t have to do anything you aren’t comfortable with. If I say something that upsets you just tell me to back off. I will and it won’t offend me to say no. Say it any time you want, I won’t be upset.”
Harry took this opportunity to pull out the map and speak to his friends once more. He told them about how he was featured in Witches Weekly as the most desirable bachelor in the UK and Ireland. They congratulated him and Prongs went on about how Harry got his looks from his father, who was so handsome. He also told them all about how he was going to spent his break making Draco his. They all supported him, even Prongs.
Draco was immediately interested as to how Harry was going to contact the dead using a piece of paper.
Harry couldn’t believe it, but for the first time in his life, he was incredibly thankful for something the Ministry had done. They sent him Draco.
“Well it’s true. The cutest boy in school, all mine.” Even though they weren’t enemies, Draco will never stop enjoying the feeling of embarrassing Harry.
Draco bit his lip and hooked his thumbs in the belt-loops of Harry’s dark jeans. He pulled his closer by his hips and tilted his head. “Would you like me to take care of that for you?” He offered.
“You did always have a weak spot for being pampered.” Pansy pointed out with a grin. “But I’m so happy for you. I never thought Harry was so romantic.”
Harry looked up at Draco with a blank expression. “Are you fucking serious? There was entire war damning halfbloods and muggleborns, yet most pureblood families aren't even that.”
They also helped each other study and do homework, anything to pass time together while the sun was still up.
Harry was satisfied with the explanation and went back to looking through his parent’s things. There were a few picture albums, he didn’t look through them. He’s already looked them over multiple times. He just hadn’t brought them out of the vault until now.
“Then we could work at Hogwarts together. Who knows, maybe I’ll become head of the infirmity and be able to sit up with the rest of the staff at banquets.”
Draco decided some light conversation couldn’t hurt. He wanted to get a bit closer to Harry before he brought anything up about the upcoming holidays. “Knowing you and Granger, this new department will come out perfect. She’d never settle for less and you care too much.” His eyes then drifted over to the small writing utensil in Harry’s hand. “What is that?”
His body hit the bed and his mind drifted. He wondered how much truth was in Harry’s defense of him. He wondered if Harry genuinely believed that Draco wasn’t a true Death Eater, if Harry really believed that Draco was just like him and had no choice in his life. Nevertheless, they still did have their history of fighting each other at every chance. Really, Lucius was handing Harry the perfect revenge. He would have Draco trapped in marriage, unable to escape, and he could do anything. Abuse him, beat him, starve him, leave him feeling alone and isolated. Even if Harry went through something similar as a child, even if he made spousal abuse illegal, no one would take his word against Harry's. Starting tomorrow, Harry would have Draco helpless and in his clutches. He could do whatever he wanted to him.
Luna frowned, also tired of their pining. Four years of it really wore everyone down. “We’ve told them before that their feelings are mutual, but they’re doubtful and insecure.”
As they were going to leave the shop, his eye was caught by a flash of silver. He turned and saw a few necklaces. Draco didn't wear jewelry, but something about them made his hand slowly retreat from the handle of the door. He looked on and his body shifted, turning to approach the jewelry. He wasn't sure what he expected to find and he didn't know why he was wasting his time on such a normal present. But nevertheless, he approached.
He took that five minutes to briefly reflect on his life. He gave werewolves rights for Remus, he’s putting a stop to child abuse for Sirius and himself, he’s enforcing the rights of house elves for Dobby, and he’s trying his hardest to make Draco comfortable. Really, Draco wasn’t a problem, it was the influx of laws and amendments that he was having to fight for in Wizengamot. At this point, he knew he only had to hold out for a few more months. It would all pass and Harry would be able to take it easy.
Draco found himself ever more shocked by how good Harry was. They’d done stuff like this before, but Harry had always been a bit nervous about expressing physical affection. The confidence made all the difference between then and now. He let his moans and gasps fall from his lips, knowing the encouragement it gave his lover.
Harry pressed another kiss to the blonde's lips before his impish expression dove into the unmarked neck before him. This was something he knew how to do. Finally, he felt like he had an ounce of control. His lips very briefly explored, feeling the body under him arch while the occasional gasp sounded off above him. Pride flooded his veins and he took on a different technique from the sweet kisses that Draco had used to keep him on edge. He wanted to give something slower and more sensual. With each kiss he let his lips part against Draco's skin to give a soft nip or suck before his lips would slowly close against his skin. There was a focus on the groove where his neck, shoulder, and collarbone met. An occasional breath of hot air left him and made Draco shiver. He teased a bit longer until he heard such a soft and broken groan slip from Draco.
Harry looked up as if he had just been caught doing something naughty. He swallowed and nodded. “Yea, I’m fine.”
Harry squeezed it in his hand and it felt like a bunch of thin things wrapped together. He opened it and a few packets of seeds fell down. He grinned and saw fruits, vegetables, and flowers for various seasons. “Wonderful.” He commented as he looked through them, reading about which season they’re meant to be planted in and organizing them in little stacks. “This is most of the produce I use anyways, it’ll make shopping much cheaper.” He looked up at Draco and seemed to melt in how much he loved the gift. “I never really had an interest in gardening until I started with my apple tree and flowers. But now, I think I’ll enjoy it very much.” Something about growing and caring for living things really helped him remove himself from the war. The destruction of his past and all the rubble in it’s wake was slowly being embraced by the stems and vines of the seeds he’ll sow, and the darkness will bear flowers. He spent quite a while just staring at the seeds before he seemed to regain himself and handed Draco his last present. Six were under the tree, and only a thin one for Harry remained.
The seventh year students were filled with a mix of emotions. Sadness that it was over, excitement for the future, loss for all the missing faces, and joy for having finished.
Alex recognized some of it and made an attempt at finishing the quote. “It’ll make it all the more satisfying to pin you down?”
Luna shared his smile and nodded, "You aren't him. The Golden Boy, The Boy Who Lived, they're dead. Harry is all that remains."
He was learning about all kinds of plants, potions, spells, and charms that could be used to heal different ailments. It was to the point that Madam Pomfrey would ask him what he thought would cure the illnesses and injuries of the different students, Draco tended to guess correctly.
“Well, after the first year we can do it annually. But I was hoping we could start off celebrating month to month.”
“Yes. They also know you risked your life to save people. They also know ..... a little bit about us.” He wasn’t sure how to word it, so he went with that.
“Just for a little bit. It was more of a limbo. I wasn’t anything for a while. I got myself together, and then I came back.”
As his stomach churned, he turned to a favorite of his. A cute little novella about a nobleman who gets whisked away by a pirate. As embarrassed as he was, he couldn’t resist something as cheesy as that. Needless to say, it was easy for him to relate to a character who had a high place in society. He was also never very interested in men like himself. All stuffy and prideful. He was much more interested in more normal men. Men who knew how to have fun, who didn't have to keep up appearances, who weren't so high-maintenance, like a pirate. He wanted to be with a man who was nothing like himself.
Saturday morning came around and Draco was the first one awake, hardly able to sleep with the excitement and anxiety of going to see Teddy. He got up and waited around a moment before becoming restless and deciding he would wake up Harry on his own.
Harry sat up and immediately felt panicked. His first thought being that either Draco was hurt or someone had broken in. “What?” He had pushed himself back into his knees.
He wanted to say that he wasn’t. He wanted to cast a spell. But he couldn’t. Perfectly still and silent, he was trapped.
Saturday morning was anything but peaceful. Draco was pacing around, a thousand worries and scenarios running through his head.
Draco’s smile fell and he blinked in shock. “Can you even see in those?” He never once considered that Harry had slight problems even with his glasses on.
"The Cupboard Project has passed it's preliminary vote." That made most of the room smile. "Mrs. Granger and Mr. Potter, you hereby have twenty days to finish the associated laws before The Cupboard Project will have it's final vote and be presented to the Minister for approval. Wizengamot will reconvene in three days for the preliminary vote on Epione Pawk's anti-discriminatory bill."
Harry’s eyes slowly widened as he realized what that meant. “So all the stuff that Voldemort got from his Death Eaters ..... I now own? Because I killed him?”
“Merlin.” Harry whined, “Well I hope you lot are happy now. I admit it, I might love him.” He still wasn’t completely sure. The feelings have been stirring inside him since October, three months later he still couldn’t say for sure, all he knew was that he wanted Draco.
On the subject of their dream spouse, Seamus revealed he had a pretty solid idea of who he wanted to be with.
It was just some Yaxley relative, a man that Draco might have seen once or twice. It was almost unsatisfying. He wanted it to be someone he knew, someone he could feel betrayed by, someone he could be angry at, someone he could hate. If his own father could be so terrible then why couldn’t everyone else he’d known? Instead, it was a man that even Lucius admitted to having seldom spoken to. He only kept the man’s identity a secret because he felt as if the attacks were some form of justice. He said the traitors deserved to be revealed, they deserve to be attacked. Even his own son.
Harry wasn’t sure when, but somewhere along their kisses, Draco shifted to nearly sit on Harry’s lap. They were so close and he was drowning. All he could smell was that stupid French cologne that the blonde had been using since they were fourteen. Caught in a moment of clarity, he wondered why he remembered that. Why did he remember when Draco first started using that cologne? He's always thought it smelled good, but he didn't think he'd remembered the change. A hand traveling to his waist sent a brief shiver through him and brought him out of his head. He wrapped his own arms around Draco and a soft little gasp left him when Draco pulled away and began moving lower. Somehow, it surprised him.
The improvised lube only worked for so long before it dried it. Not knowing the spell, Harry held up his hand to Draco. “Cast the charm.”
Around the same time, Luna and Rolf were traveling the world with their first son as Magizoologists, Ron was a prominent Auror, Hermione was on the way to becoming the youngest Minister for Magic in history, Neville was apprenticing to eventually run the Herbology department at Hogwarts, and the kids idolized Pansy as a wizard cop who puts away bad people.
“Come on, you know they’re all fine with you.” Harry encouraged but Draco shook his head, “I bullied them.”
They decided to stop after a few good runs. Until they had a better grasp of what they were doing, it was smarter not to meddle or risk their money.
“Mr. Potter, could you please recount the incident involving Draco Malfoy from your perspective?” The Head Warlock asked.
Draco was frozen for a moment before he stepped aside and wordlessly let Harry in. He didn't know that Harry was aware of his sensitivity, but as he thought about it, he can't recall a meal where Harry used very much dairy.
Harry thought a moment, but he soon became a bit determined, “Ballocks, I’ll stay with you over break and we’ll spend Christmas with Teddy.”
They could feel how important the moment was. It really was the rest of their lives and they were both excited for it. They each had their own journeys they had to go through, Draco with his sexuality and Harry with his identity, but they were ready. They had to be.
His bliss was cut off by a sharp sob under him. He looked down and saw Harry was only moments away from cumming.
They looked at few other decorations and Harry found himself a bit overwhelmed when he saw the wizard version of Christmas lights that were meant to be hung around a tree. It was little candles in glass bulbs, meant to rest on the branches. It looked very flammable and it was a nightmare Harry wasn’t willing to deal with. “We should really look into the Muggle alternative for Christmas lights. They’re a lot less dangerous.” Though he hadn’t really told Draco, his house had a bit of electricity.
“Have a seat and tell me what brought you here.” She offered. She obviously knew something was wrong, but it was unlike Harry to beat around the bush like this.
The blonde seemed quite confused for a moment, before realization washed over him. "We're married." He said lamely. He had been trying to figure out why he was let in when he wasn't family.
“You just looked and sounded so beautiful. You were so loud, and you looked like a fucking angel. You were so spread out and shaking, it was perfect. I want to do that every day.”
“Are you suggesting I stoop to your level of beastliness? Ha, I should never.” He spoke although he picked up the pace, making Harry moan out.
It was decided that for now, nobody besides Harry and Draco were to know the true identities of the Marauders, and nobody beyond Ron and Hermione were to know about the map. There were no arguments, and they all found that decision to be for the best.
“Flicking noddles at a wall? You’re certain that’s how you tell if it’s cooked?” She asked as she looked at Draco with a raised eyebrow.
His white tee shirt was filthy, his necklace was still shiny, his leather jacket was tight on his body, black pants fit just as well, and black scuffed up boots. His hair just as dark and messy as the rest of him, his face covered in soot and sweat, and it was decorated with a few new scratches. He was a mess. But his smile was bright and glowing. He smelled like fire, smoke, and ash.
Those words meant more to her than Teddy could comprehend. So she promised him that they would see each other again.
"Then you could write a sequel about the farmer going from dating the big city lawyer, to going back to the country and dating a stable boy!"
“I’m certain he knew.” Narcissa whispered. Her own voice was broken with sadness. “He knew it was too soon to say it.”
The page was sloppy, childish, full of terrible grammar, and plenty of misspelled words. It was adorable.
That alone exhausted Draco. His trial had just finished and now he was stuck at home with a father who probably hates him. Still, he pressed on until mid-June, when he learned the true nature of his oath as a Death Eater. When he asked his father about it, he was told that he didn't need to know because everything he owned was tied to Lucius anyways. He'd lost everything when Lucius took the mark. His father also couldn't stand that Harry ended up keeping some wine. It was meant to be an insult and they all knew it. But Draco also knew Lucius' anger wasn’t really about the wine. It was about everything Harry had ever done. The wine was just an excuse for the way Harry destroyed Voldemort's attempts at a racist utopia.
“Fact is, you’re both daft and clueless. We’re at our wits end with the both of you. If you don’t confess now I’m gonna lose it.” Ron said with a sigh. He was really over it and wanted them together already.
Draco’s expression clouded over with shock. He couldn’t believe someone would do that to a child. Even knowing what he knew about Harry, he never would’ve assumed someone could do that to a kid. He turned back to the sauce, slowly stirring and wishing he hadn’t even tried to have a normal conversation. He should’ve known better. They aren’t normal. They can’t be normal.
That blonde head dropped to kiss and moan against Harry’s neck, enthralled by the way he was finally called lover. The word Harry only used for those he dated, the word no one else would call him. He was Harry’s lover and that felt better than anything their bodies could do. He let out a soft whine and shifted a bit, allowing himself to push even harder onto Harry. His hips grew a bit more frantic and his voice suddenly lost all breathlessness. His noises were guttural and clear, more akin to whines and cries. A sudden bout of clarity came upon him and he realized just how rough their movements had become. It felt so much sweeter.
Harry gave a nod, “Oh, and, uhm, the Ministry is having this ball, thing, for the holidays.” He felt so unbelievably awkward. He meant to ask Draco about the ball weeks ago, but there was never a good time. The subject of Christmas made him remember it, but now he was painfully aware of how couple-y it sounds. “It’s December twentieth. I know you like balls, so, uh, would you like to accompany me?” It sounded far too much like a date for Harry’s liking. “Of course you don’t even have to be there with me, I’m sure you’d like to spend time with Pansy.”
His train of thought rode down memory lane for as long as he could control it, until Harry’s face started reappearing. Suddenly, his thoughts were of all the filthy things he’d done, but with Harry instead of previous lovers. Harry was the one riding him, being ridden, calling out as Draco touched him, sucking Draco off, begging on his knees, pinning Draco to a wall and teasing him until he couldn’t take it anymore. Draco was consumed by his mind’s guesses at what Harry’s moans might sound like, what his body might look like. It was so beautiful and enrapturing. He gasped and focused on the image of the man he’s fallen for.
Hermione, Seamus, and Draco read books. Luna painted, Neville experimented with Herbology and potions, Dean freelanced sports articles for a few newspapers and magazines, and Ron had started working out for his new position as a future Auror. Everyone had hobbies and lives, but Harry was finally relaxed enough to realize he had nothing of his own.
They were left alone until the Aurors arrived. During this, Narcissa scolded him once more, but it hardly lasted five seconds before she shed a few tears and threw her arms around him. "Oh, I'm just happy you're safe. You couldn't have known he'd be in Paris. But I'll be sure that bastard is thrown in Azkaban."
That told Draco all he needed to know. “You just did." He said with a victorious grin. “If you didn’t like him, you would have denied the rumor. Which, by the way, doesn’t exist. I suspected you fancied him on my own, I see the way you look at him when you two talk.”
Draco, on the other hand, was having a quiet celebration. He was finally getting the holidays together like he wanted, and he and Harry were getting closer. He was nearly too excited to sleep. Instead of sleeping he opened up a book, Yuletide, the one about the Hogwarts boys who fall in love. He figured a bit of holiday inspiration couldn’t hurt.
"Oh it's no problem, I know how much you like hot chocolate and it isn't a hard recipe. A nice cup sounded too good to pass up, anyways." He commended as he took a sip, feeling the drink warm his chest like vodka. He held back a shiver as the warmth spread and made him feel even more comfortable around Draco, just like wine.
Harry couldn’t help but to notice how focused Draco was. His eyelids were low, his eyebrows were furrowed, his lower lip was trapped between his teeth, his hands were quick and his fingers elegantly fluttered around with the wrappings. Harry was entranced by how beautiful Draco was. Something about his face when he was concentrated was lovely.
They tried and tried until mid-October. Multiple times a week, every week, pushing romance between the two but still, nothing happened. That’s when they moved on to Plan B, exposing them. They settled on doing it like an intervention.
Narcissa frantically waved Harry over with a wide grin. "He started moving a few minutes ago. Hasn't opened his eyes yet."
Harry rolled his eyes, but it was late, and he was slightly delusional, so he gave in. “Ugh, fine. Since you’re just dying to know.”
He let go of the trunk so the tree couldn’t feel when he was about to make his escape. He stared out at his friends, getting into position and readying to try and outrun the tree. He felt a bit foolish, and part of him knew there was no way to best the tree. He prepared himself for a beating.
“You didn’t, don’t worry about it. But I can tell you’d rather be writing about a hundred other things than some lawsuit about two wizards who are only relevant to one niche audience.”
The day before everyone left for break, he distributed out all the presents amongst his friends. Pansy was a bit surprised that Harry for her something, but she took it with a smile and promised not to open it till Christmas.
Harry’s face was bright red. He tried his best to look displeased but he honestly didn’t mind it. It was just a tad embarrassing. Some small part of him even enjoyed it. He was rarely praised in his life until recently, and somehow it felt meaningless. Until now. “Stop that.”
Harry just shrugged. “I’ve no idea what he’s going on about. Thank you Narcissa, I’d like to think I’m nice.”
Harry let out a soft chuckle. “Why do you do that? You used to say my name so condescendingly, as if it were an insult, as if it was disgusting. But now ..... you made your old arrogance into a joke, you call me by my last name when you flirt with me, it’s .....” He trailed off once more, searching for words. “It’s incredible. Why did you do that?”
“I agree. I know someone who works for the Prophet that I trust to tell the story.” He chewed his lower lip a moment, almost struggling with what he wanted to say. This conversation wasn’t easy in the slightest but he knew they had to have it. “What should we say?” There was a lot that maybe they shouldn’t include. Like the details of their contract, so no one got any bad ideas of how Harry treated Draco.
liked men. From that point on, he was kept away from boys his age while unsupervised. He wasn't allowed any privacy at social gatherings. It was embarrassing and shameful. Hogwarts was the only time he had the chance to be himself and he almost felt bad about how many times he took advantage of it.
No matter what he did or said, Draco couldn’t doubt that his father would be found guilty. But at least he had his own truth. That would have to be enough.
They joked a while longer before Molly had to leave. They hugged and said their goodbyes. Molly wished him the best and left.
He rushed to the Floos and took one home. He saw Draco laying on the sofa, half-asleep with a book in his hands. The blonde looked up and greeted Harry with a small smile. "Hey, how was your day?"
Harry crossed his arms, “Of course not! I wasn’t waxing poetic because I want to have sex with you, I was waxing poetic because you’re beautiful!”
Ron gave a sheepish smile. He then shrugged off his shyness and looked Harry right in the eye. “I’m with Ginny and Neville on this one. If I had to sleep with a guy, or if I liked guys, I’d sleep with you. You’re a looker, Harry. I’m straight but I'm not blind.”
As for the House of Malfoy, Harry had a hard time deciding on what to do with them. Part of him wanted to leave them alone and have no more dealings with them, but by the same token, he wanted to fuck them over. He could take the roof over their heads or the clothes off their backs. He could take everything and leave them with nothing but an empty home. Instead, he settled for a few pieces of furniture. It wasn’t even furniture from the Manor, but some items from other properties that the Malfoy family owned. Harry did, however, decide to take a good portion of the wine cellar, knowing how important it was to Lucius.
She took a mental step back, realizing she had misjudged him. “Sorry.” Up until then she never would have thought she might have a prejudice against Slytherins. But perhaps, she needed to be more careful in how she judged people.
"Lucius Malfoy blackmailed Draco and used that to leverage me. That's how he got us to marry." He was already far past the point of no return. There was no way to go back on what's been said and he knew this, so he relented. He gave in and decided he might as well tell the story. "Would you like me to elaborate?" He offered. Finally, he had removed himself from his passive role of being interrogated under the influence of a potion. He left the passenger's seat and became the driver. This was his story and he was telling it on his own terms. So with what little control he had, he played by his own rules.
That was one of the most horrifying things Draco has ever been told. The more he thought about the journey Harry went through, the worse he felt about his side of the war. “I’m so sorry for everything I put you through.”
The blonde’s thumb rubbed over the back of Harry’s hand, trying to comfort him. “Well if you aren’t happy with it then there’s no point in doing it. You can stick it out for your department and Pawk’s bill, then you can focus on The Cupboard Project, yea?”
"I'd like to chat with Draco, that's all." He spoke in a pleasant voice, though his eyes were not. Draco couldn’t quite name that emotion carried in them but it was something that made his stomach uneasy. It wasn’t unfamiliar. Not at all. It was an expression he hadn’t seen since Hogwarts was nearly wiped off the map.
Harry grinned as they turned in for the night. The stress of Draco’s exams and Harry’s workout of melting metal had them both tired.
He walked in and found his roommate studying for Charms. “I talked to Hannah Abbott. She fancies Neville.”
“No, thank you for believing me.” He didn't feel better because he told Draco or because he let it all out. He felt better because finally, someone listened and believed him. Dear Merlin, someone believed him. Someone heard everything and didn't doubt it. Someone believed him. The feeling that gave him was indescribably valuable. It meant everything to him.
A few months later and it was the sixteenth anniversary of Draco and Harry’s relationship, and their fourteenth wedding anniversary.
Draco listened with a dropped jaw. He spoke up when Harry finished. “Alright, I see the problem here. You’re associating stress with survival. But you don’t need to anymore. You’re alright. No one is trying to kill or hurt you, you’re going to live a peaceful life as a professor at Hogwarts, your home.”
He took a few deep breaths and felt a bit better. “Tell him about me. Tell him all about me. Tell him that he didn’t die for nothing. Tell them that I made sure none of them died for nothing. Tell them that next year, my peers are going to take the Ministry by storm! Tell them that they’re planning to make a series of laws in Remus’ honor that protect the rights of those afflicted with Lycanthropy. Tell him that no one like him can ever be denied a job because of that. Tell Sirius that they’re going to implement a form of child protective services so that no kid can ever be hurt again.” Lily’s journal briefly touched the subject of Sirius’ childhood. “Tell my father that I fought just like he did and that no one else will have to die. Tell him that there will be no more orphans of war. Tell my mother that her siste-“ He cut himself off. His throat closed up at the mention of Petunia.
“I’ll use you Harry.” He slipped a single finger into himself, letting it in halfway before he met resistance. He slowly thrusted to work himself open. “I’ll make myself feel so good.” His pitch dropped and took on a sultry tone as he spoke through his pleasure. “That turns you on, doesn’t it? No expectations, no judgement, no one to impress, just pleasure.” He let his free hand rest on Harry’s chest to steady himself. He bit his lip and teased himself a bit, pulling back to run his fingertip over those sensitive places that sat just inside his rim. His thighs shook and an unsteady groan slipped out of his lips.
They smiled and nodded. "Thank you, Potter. Oh, and uh, you might want to get yourself a copy of Witches Weekly ..... they uhm ..... they just published something about you."
Draco was two seconds away from throwing away all higher thinking and slamming his head against the wall until he could finally rattle something lose in his head. Something that would unclog his brain and allow thoughts to flow. Something to give him some semblance of a way to end the story that had both blessed and plagued the last few months of his life. Though he very much enjoyed his writing, it was as if some part of his mind had already finished the book and was no longer concerned with it, which left the rest of him to stare at the pages in hopes that words would somehow appear in some form of an ending.
Draco was shocked but quickly stood up straight and wrapped his arms around Harry’s shoulders. It was typically himself that initiated things like this. Having Harry take the lead was a very pleasant surprise.
After lunch, as everyone was on their way to their next class, he let them loose. There was only three.
"Of course I did! I got new robes last week when I was with Blaise in Paris.” He sounded so genuinely excited. He’s always loved balls.
He finished his sandwich in silence, watching Draco. Though it would be boring to most people, he thought it was pretty interesting. He started by looking over Draco's shoulder a while and reading it as Draco went along. The characters were wrapped up in a conversation that existed to establish the fact that they were both single and interested in men. The lawyer nursed a single glass of wine through the night while the photographer had a few glasses of whisky, but it's dulled effect showed a tolerance for alcohol. He followed along for a few paragraphs before Draco finally noticed him watching. He flushed pink and raised an eyebrow, "Having fun?"
Headlines were made, and for the first time in two weeks straight, it wasn’t about Draco and Harry. Instead, The Daily Prophet headlined an investigative report on Louis Luther and his involvement with violent crimes against Muggles.
Of course, their description of their time together wasn’t pleasing to their friends. They talked about the jokes, laughs, warmth, Christmas, holding each other, falling asleep together, sweet words, and their crushes on each other.
“Of course I did, Harry. They were the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me. Why would I ever throw them out? They’re beautiful.” He said as he dug through his trunk. He pulled out a black leather-bound journal with the Slytherin symbol on the cover. He opened it up to a bookmarked page and there they were. Every letter Harry had written was pressed into the pages of the journal to keep them all neat and safe.
Next year was gonna bring a lot of change, Harry couldn’t wait. Everyone who died in the war, died for this. He knew that his peers were also aware of this, which is why they planned to rain down upon the Ministry like a tsunami and push for change. Only a few more months before they would storm the Ministry with heavy hands, grounded feet, uncompromising morals, and minds of stone. They were certain to bring in a storm, and Harry was eager to watch.
Harry was writing letters back and forth with his friends. A lot had happened in the last week. Hermione was offered an internship under Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt, Professor Sprout offered Neville a position as her assistant in the Herbology Department, his girlfriend Hannah got herself an interview for a minor position in the Ministry, Ron was accepted into the training program to be an Auror, Pansy was offered a position to train for her dream job in the Improper Uses Of Magic Office, and Dean and Seamus’ applications for the Department Of Magical Sports and Games were approved.
He was escorted down a hallway filled with little offices, and taken into a room where an older goblin was waiting on him. The plaque at the door introduced him as Mr. Demgass.
He kept reading until he heard Draco, “Shit, Harry come on! Transfigurations starts in three minutes.”
A shiver went through Harry and he looked up again. “I-I don’t think I can do this.” His voice was heavy with something and it made the blonde grin.
His eyes widened when he realized he had never cast a cleaning charm on himself. The feeling of a liquid seeping out of his ass warned him of this. “Shit.” He cursed as he quickly cast the spell on himself to prevent any mess. He also cast it on Harry’s cock as a curtesy. It slipped his mind to cast the spell due to his lover’s eagerness to return the orgasm.
Draco nodded and grinned at the other’s eagerness. He watched the man begin pulling his own pants off, soon laying naked on his back in the middle of their bed.
“It wasn’t me.” Draco quickly said, a bit freaked out. Even in a world where magic exists, some things still aren’t normal.
Hannah looked away, looking over her books again. “Depends, who told you?” She pressed on, determined to find the snitch.
"I am not! I'm one hundred sixty-five centimeters tall, exactly! It's perfectly average." He defended.
Harry’s blush spread and he looked away, silently putting sprinkles on his gingerbread house. He was so embarrassed yet so flattered. It was hard for him to even begin to explain the way he felt because he’s never felt this way before. It was so new and exciting. Draco wanted him. Draco physically wanted him, and cared about him, and was interested in him on an emotional level. His lips parted as words hung but never would form. He searched for them as his hands stilled, too focused inside of his mind to bother with the physical world.
