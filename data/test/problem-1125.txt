“The one that vanishes all the persons clothes.” He answered with a sharp smile. The other two looked surprised at first, but then they both grinned and started after Malfoy.
“What makes you think you can just decide that Potter?” He demanded. Harry decided to reason with him before pulling out the big guns.
“Harry! Where have you been?” Hermione called as he approached her and Ron. Harry glanced up at the head table and saw that McGonagall wasn’t there.
“None of this even looks like it’ll fit you.” He added distractedly as he pulled out a pair of baggy jeans with multiple holes. Draco tisked and continued looking.
“Yes. I’ll be your boyfriend.” Harry let out a breathy laugh and they kissed again until Harry felt like his lungs would burst if he didn’t get regular air. They pulled back and tidied each other up.
“Potter.” Draco said, sounding like he was barely holding onto his anger. “Why am I naked?” He demanded. Harry’s eyes widened a bit as he realized how close they were both standing to fit under the cloak. He was grateful he wasn’t the tallest and that they were both rather thin or they may not fit at all.
“Er, no, I’m not.” Harry was slightly worried about where this was going. His heart was hammering. He was only inches from Malfoy’s chest.
Once, earlier in the year Harry had overheard a couple of younger Gryffindors trying to antagonize Malfoy while he was in the library. Malfoy had simply continued working and ignored the ugly words from the younger students. Annoyed, Harry had immediately stormed over and told them off. When he turned around Malfoy had left and Harry felt vaguely disappointed.
“Lead the way.” Draco said sounding unenthusiastic. Harry walked them back up to the 8th year dorms and said the password to let them through the portrait hole. Luckily nearly everyone was eating dinner at the moment so the common room was empty and Harry quickly led Draco across the room to the door that led to the boys dormitories. Harry was pretty sure Draco had been following him because he heard a second pair of steps the whole way, but they had been faint because Draco didn’t even have shoes on and now they were practically nonexistent. It was rather awkward that neither one had spoken the whole way up and Harry jumped when Draco finally spoke.
“Honestly Potter where did these come from? There’s no way any of this would have ever fit you. They can’t possibly be your clothes.”
“G’night.” Harry said as he headed in the direction of the boys dorms. All of the students who had elected to come back to Hogwarts for an 8th year had been moved to their own set of dorms away from the other students. This was mostly because the 8th years had been given some liberties that the younger students didn’t have such as being allowed to leave the school grounds whenever they wished and not actually having a curfew. Seeing as they were all legally adults McGonagall had seen no reason to set such restrictions so long as they were respectful and acted responsibly.
“And we know you know where to find him.” Ron said with finality. Harry slouched back into the couch.
“Right then.” Ron said as he saw them step away from each other. He walked up to Draco and gave a small sigh. “We might as well call a truce too.” He said and extended his hand. Draco looked rather shocked and maybe a tad reluctant, but he hesitantly shook Ron’s hand.
“What do you mean? He’s practically avoiding me at all costs.” He insisted trying not to sound hurt. This seemed to only spur them on.
“Come here.” She said and led them to a couch with Harry in the middle. “We’ve noticed that you two have been paying a lot of attention to each other.” Harry was incredulous.
“I wanted to thank you.” Harry blurted out. “For lying for me. You saved my life.” Narcissa carefully set her tea back on her saucer.
“Thank you for bringing this to my attention Mr. Potter. I assure you I will be taking corrective action and I am certain I will be able to identify the culprits thanks to your handiwork.” Harry grinned at that and thanked the professor before heading back to the 8th year dorms.
“I’m going to go put these away.” Harry told them, clearing his throat. Hermione and Ron made eye contact.
“No one will bother you anywhere else either if I have anything to say about it.” Draco snorted, but secretly loved the protectiveness in his voice.
“Thank you, Potter, but I can get on without your help. You needn’t run to my aid at every opportunity.” He spat sounding rather annoyed. Harry was only incensed by his words.
Harry spotted the Slytherins who had attacked Malfoy sitting in the corner and noticed one of them was holding a camera. Likely ready to catch Malfoy running back in without clothes. Harry kept his face blank despite his boiling rage. There was no need to make a scene right now.
Later that week as Harry was putting away his books from class and getting ready to meet Ron and Hermione for dinner his hand brushed the map in his trunk. He hesitated before deciding to give the map a once over. Malfoy had been showing up at the great hall less and less and it bothered Harry a bit. He wanted to say it was because the git thought he was too good to have meals with everyone else, but he knew that likely wasn’t the case. Locating the familiar dot on the parchment Harry was thrown to find Malfoy was alone in a classroom on the 3rd floor. That was a bit out of the ordinary. Harry frowned and thought about it for a moment. He supposed he could just walk by on his way to the great hall. Just to check on things and make sure nothing odd was going on. It would be fine. He wasn’t obsessing. He decided to stuff his invisibility cloak into his bag and take it with him. If Malfoy was going to try to avoid him then he just wouldn’t let Malfoy see him.
“Hermione, I actually have something I need to do. Any chance you have something I can put food in for later?” She thought for a moment before pulling out her wand and pointing it at a napkin. It transfigured into a takeout container. “Brilliant I’ll have to learn that one.” Harry said as he piled food into it. “Thanks Hermione.” He added as he set off.
“Now that’s over with.” Ron said looking a little relieved when he let go. “Hermione and I are doing homework in the common room, you’re both free to join if you want.” Harry was shocked and grateful for Ron’s seeming acceptance of the situation. It appeared the redhead was maturing after all. Ron started to leave the room and spotted the takeout box of food on Draco’s trunk. He turned to Harry and rose his eyebrows, giving him a knowing look before leaving the room. Harry felt his face heat but couldn’t quite figure out why. He would have to talk to Ron later. Just to clear up… whatever that was.
“Of course.” McGonagall answered sounding deeply concerned. With that Harry launched into what he had witnessed and what he had done to get the other Slytherins and Ravenclaw to leave. He also told her that Draco would be staying in the 8th year dorms from now on. He felt vaguely guilty for running and telling a teacher, but the other students had really taken it too far and something needed to be done to show that you couldn’t just attack other students regardless of what happened during the war. McGonagall agreed completely.
It had been four days since that conversation and while Draco did stay in the 8th year dorms he continued to make himself scarce. He was never seen in the common room and he only stayed in the dorms to sleep. The rest of the time no one was really sure where he went. Aside from Harry, of course, who could be found rather frequently referencing a folded scrap of parchment. He wasn’t even being subtle about checking the map anymore which is why on the 4th morning of Draco avoiding everyone else Harry pulled out the map and checked it while eating breakfast at the Gryffindor table. He heard Hermione sigh on his left and Ron snickered on his right. He ignored them both and continued searching the map. He finally spotted the familiar dot once again in the empty classroom on the 3rd floor. Harry frowned at that. What was in that room that made him keep going there?
"But, Harry, you don't like coff- oh!" George gasped. "So, Ron... Does he know?" Harry nodded his head and sighed. "There's this boy that I really really like and I think he likes me too, and Ron caught us together... He, um, sort of put the cherry on top of this massive cake and it all collapsed," George looked at him eyebrow raised and Harry stared him straight in the eye. "I tried to commit suicide, George. I wasn't in my right mind, Ron had already gone and told me that if I was gay then I should kill myself and I guess I listened to him."
Ginny and Harry headed down to the Great Hall with Hermione and Ron. Luna and Draco went down separately, both in disguise. Ginny and Luna had the same plan as Harry and Draco but Luna didn't know that Harry was also going off with someone else.
"Harry Potter, you're up next." The guard said as Lily came back, and he looked at Harry with disgust. Harry ignored him and headed through the large, metal doors to stand by Sirius. His heart thumped in his chest, feeling as though it may explode even more so now than in his own trial.
"What are you smiling about? You don't deserve to be happy," he scoffed, sneering at Harry. Uncle Vernon looked up and Harry quickly wiped the smile off his face. "Come on Dudley, we're going to teach the boy a lesson." Vernon smirked. Harry tried to run up to his room, but the two whale sized men followed him and pushed him to the ground. As they were beating him, Harry tried to crawl over to his trunk that was set in the corner of his bedroom. With one final hard kick and punch from the two Dursley men, Harry apperated to Kings Cross. He quickly jumped up and casted a glamour on himself, so the marks from recent and previous events wouldn't show.
Harry stopped again and pulled his wand out. This was it, the big reveal. He wiped his glamour away and Hermione burst out crying. "Sometimes, the abuse wouldn't be so bad and sometimes it would be things you would usually go to the hospital for. Broken ribs, too much blood loss. But, magic had to fix most of it. Petunia found the way she liked to do it and did it every time she could,"
Harry looked up and saw Mrs Weasley, staring right back at him. She gestured for him to come and stand by her, so he reluctantly walked over and was engulfed in hugs. He didn't want to look at the body. It was his fault that a Weasley was dead. All they had ever done was protect, feed and love him like their own, and this is how he repays them.
Harry looked at himself in the mirror. On the outside, he seemed perfectly fit and healthy, so he decided it was good enough. Harry climbed out the window, down the pipe and headed down to the end of Privet Drive. When he got there, he held his wand up in his sleeve but saw no one there.
"He told me that you and Malfoy were... in love." He chocked out, and Harry could tell that it was forced out. "No. Draco wasn't in love with me." Harry said emotionlessly. "He left me. Said he was just playing me, making a fool out of me. You were right, I was stupid to fall for him." Ron gaped at him, stopping in the middle of a corridor, before running to catch up with Harry who had kept on walking.
"Hi Draco," said Harry, so softly the addressed boy barely heard. It was the warm butterflies in his stomach that made him turn around. "I just wanted to say that I understand why you did what you did. I'm pathetic and it'd be really easy to toy with my emotions, it was an opportunity you just couldn't pass."
He opened it and read 'Dear Mr Potter due to the events that occurred at Hogwarts, all past 7th year students have been invited back for an 8th year, to learn what they couldn't whilst our school was in the hands of death eaters. School will open again in September due to repairs. If you are interested in coming back, please send an owl before June 14th. Your headmistress, Professor M. McGonagoll.
“You know what I mean, like, together. A couple.” There were only two other people in the common room, and they appeared to be on their way out. Ron kept his voice low, but Harry still felt the need to look around to make sure no one had heard.
Harry sighed as he stared at the dot lingering in the Slytherin dorms. He wondered what the blonde’s problem was. Couldn’t he see that he was only trying to help. That he was trying to resolve the animosity between them. He was still examining the map when Ron came into the dorms. Harry cleared the map and put it away in his trunk. When he turned around Ron was watching him.
Okay, maybe every night, but he had promised to keep an eye on things. Most of the time he found Malfoy in the Slytherin dorms which is where he was tonight.
“You’re wardrobe really is quite horrendous.” Draco informed him as he pulled out a very over sized shirt and tossed it to the side.
“Are you sure?” Harry received a very deadpan look in response. “Alright, but you better actually go up to the dorms. I will write her if I have to.” Draco paled slightly before his ears reddened again and Harry grinned. “I’ll see you later then.” Harry said and walked off to enter the great hall for dinner.
Ron groaned at the news and Hermione elbowed him, but he didn’t really say much else and seemed relatively unbothered so hopefully that was a good sign. Hermione looked thoughtful.
He backed Draco up another step until they were fully in the room and closed the door behind them. As soon as he heard the door snap shut Draco surged forward and pressed Harry against the door, kissing him with new vigor. It was Harry’s turn to moan into the kiss. His hands slid back to Draco’s hips and he followed the waistband to the Slytherin’s back. One hand slid down to cup Draco’s arse the other slid up Draco’s shirt to explore the bare skin of his back. Draco groaned and their lips separated briefly.
“Oh, right you would have been really well off standing in the middle of the hallway in the buff.” Harry shot back heatedly. Draco didn’t seem to have much to say about that. He frowned and looked around them.
“Which is why we’re moving your things to the 8th year dorm where they should have been in the first place.” Draco didn’t seem to know how to respond to that. He seemed torn between the decision to be rude or follow Harry’s lead and be civil. There was silence and then a lot of jumbled words while Draco settled on what to say.
“They’re hand me downs from my cousin. He was rather large and the charms I use wear off after a while.” Harry explained distractedly as he waved his wand and started shrinking the clothes. The spell wasn’t necessarily supposed to be used on clothes which is why it wore off and the clothes never looked like they fit just right, but it did the job of making them more wearable and that was all Harry had needed before. He wore his school robes most of the time anyway. Draco was looking rather confused now.
Harry smiled back and gave a small nod. The conversation turned to lighter topics if a little stilted, but Harry relaxed in his chair a little.
“Um, I will be returning to my dorm and you will be doing whatever it is saviors of the wizarding world do.” Draco insisted.
“You’re one to talk.” Harry said as he held up a pair of briefs. Draco tisked and flicked his wand at the article of clothing. It folded itself and dropped into the trunk. Draco continued his packing, but Harry could see his ears turning red. Once the trunk was all packed Draco tapped it with his wand. It floated up between them and he led it from the room. Harry followed him out and kept an eye on the glaring boil-covered Slytherins in the back of the room. Once they reached the main floor Draco stopped Harry.
“Maybe.” Harry admitted with a small voice as his throat closed and wetness gathered at the corners of his eyes. He tried to get control of himself, but Hermione scooted closer and pulled him into a tight hug. Deep down he knew his friends loved him and would accept him for who he was, but that hadn’t stopped the fear of rejection from eating at him. It didn’t undo the years he’d had to endure his relatives snide remarks whenever they saw the ‘unnatural’ couples on the street. On his other side Ron wrapped his arms around the both of them and held them. Harry was trying to calm down, he really was, but his shoulders started shaking and his breath came shorter without his permission. His friends held him until he stopped shaking. One’s of Ron’s hands was rubbing his arm and Hermione’s made small circles on his back. It grounded him and settled his nerves. His breathing slowly returned to normal and even then, they held him for just a bit longer.
“oh. OH, Yes. Right.” Harry quickly slipped out from under the cloak, but kept his hand curled around the hem. “What are you going to do?” Harry asked.
“We’ll go with you.” Hermione said with a smile. Harry shrugged and started walking out of the great hall with them.
“Yep.” Harry said as he continued walking, leading them down to the Slytherin dorms. Draco hurried to catch up with him.
"Yeah. We're adults now. We can move on. Maybe we'll even get along." The last part of his sentence sounded a little more like a question and it looked like the words took a lot of effort, but Hermione gave Ron an approving nod and he turned his attention back to dinner.
“No time like the present.” Ron said looking just a little smug. Harry couldn’t think of a rebuttal.
Harry's eyes found his parents and he grinned, quickly wiping his eyes and heading over to sit with them by Sirius's seat, where the chains had bound around his wrists and ankles when he sat. A lot of the court were looking at the Potters, some even wiping a few stray tears. "Lily and James Potter's sacrifices will never be forgotten!" A witch called, bouncing in her seat in excitement of seeing the couple. "And yet you raised your hand for our son to be put in Azkaban! You're thanking us when Harry is the one who saved your god damn world and you wanted to shut him away for something that is a part of who he is! Shame on you." James spat and the room went silent as the witch stilled and her face flushed.
A thin man with long scraggly black hair and multiple tattoos stood in front of the desk. "Y- you- you're supposed to be-" Harry choked. "Dead?" Harry's Godfather, Sirius Black replied.
Slughorn opened the doors to the Great Hall and everyone ran in, the girls screaming in delight as they saw the Weird Sisters standing on the stage. They were playing a fast song first, so Harry and Ginny headed to the very front of the stage making sure to be seen together.
"And what I need is for you two boys to stop being such adorable saps and come and join the rest of the party! We're headed back to Grimmauld Place for celebrations, you up for it?" Sirius smiled, turning the corner and causing Draco and Harry to leap apart. "Of course," Harry smiled. "Actually, I think I am going to head back to Malfoy Manor with my mother. For those who don't know about us yet, and that is the majority, I don't think having a Malfoy turn up at the party would be great fun for them." Draco shrugged and Harry pouted. "Now don't give me that look, I will see you tomorrow back at Hogwarts!" Draco chuckled.
MOST CHARACTERS AND SETTINGS AND THINGS BELONG TO J.K. ROWLING (However if you support her views and shit please go away <3)
"How long have you been having to do that?" A voice said and Harry looked up to see Draco. "Uh, every morning for a couple of weeks. They're working, that's why I'm a bit better now." Harry nodded and Draco sat down. "I'm going to Hogsmeade today. Want to come with me?" He asked, pouring himself a glass of apple juice.
"I'm okay," Harry lied. "I mean, Ron and I got into a huge fight about something and now he's left Hogwarts, but I still have some amazing friends! Oh! I almost forgot. I was going to go to McGonogall with this, but since you are my legal guardian I suppose I'll have to tell you." Harry got the letter from the ministry out of his bag and nervously handed it over to Sirius who quickly scim-read it, eyes widening.
"You're so cute, Potter!" Draco grinned, petting Harry. Harry barked in return and curled up in Draco's lap. Silence fell between the boys once more as they watched the moon. Everything was just how it should have been, until a ginger haired boy came strolling up to them.
"Y- you still sleep with a teddy bear?" Draco said, snorting with laughter. "It reminds me of Fred." Ron snapped, but then grinned. "Oh, I'm so proud of you Ron!" Hermione squealed all of a sudden. "Um... thank you?" Ron laughed, raising a brow. "You saw them kiss upfront with absolutely no reaction!" She smiled.
"Look at you two, blushing every other second," Ginny laughed. The four talked for a while, avoiding the topic of a certain ginger haired bastard. That was until, he walked in.
Harry was late to potions that day, and had to quickly jump to his seat next to Hermione before Parvati Patil sat in it. She scoffed at him then took the last seat next to Neville.
A couple of weeks had passed and Draco was banging on the inside of his mind to be free of the curse. He was made to sleep in Pansy's room and Draco saw that Hermione had temporarily moved into Harry's room. "Draco, ready to go down to breakfast?" Pansy asked in that sickening false sweet voice as she took his hand.
"Fine, Potter. I will let you walk free with a mind healer- but mark my words! This does not change a thing about the laws and so long as I am in power, they never will change!" Fudge grunted and stormed away. Harry grinned as a few workers came down to shake his hand. "I thought that you guys think that I was contagious?" Harry questioned. "Oh, no, most of us don't believe that anymore, we all agree with everything you said!" The same mousy looking woman squeaked. "Oh, well thank you... Uh-"
The music started playing again and people went back to dancing. Harry leant his forehead against Draco's and closed his eyes. "I'm happy. Here, right now, in this room, you make me feel special like nobody has before," Harry smiled and looked into Draco's eyes. Draco pushed his lips onto Harry's and wrapped his arms around Harry's neck once again.
"In the Muggle world, Harry, the encanta bond is a myth that is known as soulmates. It's extremely rare and hasn't been seen in thousands of years. And now, I think I've discovered why!" Hermione explained, picking up the newspaper clippings. "It was rumoured that Merlin had the encanta bond with someone, but it doesn't say who. And this paper, says that he was seen sharing 'affection' with a man. I think you can only share the encanta bond in very powerful same sex couples." She finished excitedly, leaving Harry and Draco gobsmacked.
"Who are you? Slughorn asked as Harry was walking back into the party. "You don't go to this school?" Harry put on his best fake American accent and replied "No, sir. My name is Jacob Evans and I go to Illvermorny. Harry Potter invited me here for the party. He told me you throw only the best ones in England! I'm a distant relative of his."
Harry was laid down and Madame Pomfrey fixed his wound. In the Muggle world, she said he would've needed these things called stitches and possibly even surgery. It was really bad.
Lily Potter appeared in the room, smiling warmly until she saw her sister. "You!" She spat. "You horrible, disgusting BITCH! How dare you let that man do such horrid things to my child, how dare YOU do such horrid things to my child!" If Harry thought that McGonagall was scary when she was angry, that was nothing compared to this. "L-Lily, oh my-" Petunia gulped. "I-I-I-"
"Stop there, Potter!" Harry turned around, completely expressionless, just like he had been the past couple of weeks, absolutely emotionless.
Sirius walked away and towards McGonogall's new headmistress office, the one were Albus Dumbledore used to sit. He was about to enter, when a ministry official letter swooped down, telling him that he would have to be put on trial for his innocence. He was allowed three witnesses minimum, to back him up. Would three be enough?
But there was that kiss. Draco kissed Harry first, so surely that counted for something. "Look, there he is now!" Hermione whispered, pointing to the pale blonde boy who had just walked in. "Hermione, I can't ask him now, I'm not prepared!" Harry whisper-yelled as Hermione tried to pry him off his seat.
McGonagall strode across to the other side of the room, her hand over her mouth to stifle her cries. Madame Pomfrey ran over to comfort her, so Draco took the chance to grab Harry's hand in his own. That's when he noticed it.
"Hey!" Harry laughed, and booped Draco's shiny black nose. The two boys sat in silence until Harry started laughing. Draco turned in shock at the sudden outburst but Harry was still chuckling and sort of rolling his eyes. Draco barked as if to say 'What?'
"Good evening all. I have a couple of things to say before we start our well needed feast. As you all know, terrible, terrible events happened at our school in the earlier May, and we suffered horrible losses. We have rebuilt our school, stronger than ever before. Our 8th years who have come back, the north east tower has been devoted to you for your dormitories and common room. All houses will stay in the same tower. You have each been put with one other person to share a room. Our caretaker Filch has asked me to remind you, no supplies from Weasley's Wizard Wheezes or Zonko's joke shop are to be allowed inside the castle. The forbidden forest is still, out of bounds. May the feast commence!"
"Would you like me to talk to her?" Hermione asked. "It's no use. Neville's got her wrapped around his little finger," Ginny sighed. Harry hated seeing her so hurt, she was like his little sister.
The next day, Harry headed down to breakfast early and by himself, leaving a sleeping Draco behind. He sat by himself in the pretty much empty hall, picking up some fruit. Harry had preferred to go by himself at breakfast when hardly anybody was there, because that is when he had to take his potions.
"Snape's dead too, Sirius. And he wasn't bad. Dumbledore ordered him to kill him so Draco's soul would be protected from evil. You probably knew that Snape was in love with my Mum. He asked Voldemort to spare her and when he didn't, Snape became loyal to Dumbledore. He's sort of been helping us all along."
"They're with Mr and Mrs Potter, aren't they? I wouldn't interrupt them if I were you, I heard Lily Evans has quite a bit of a temper!" Draco smirked and Ron gulped. "Come on, Ron. You're pulling on our strings! We know you, you know us. You're the one who found out about us, you found us snogging, didn't you?" Harry grinned, pointing between him and Draco. "Uh..." Ron gulped again.
"You can't honestly expect me to leave with you!" Hermione screeched, her face contorted with a mix of emotions. "You disgust me Ronald Weasley and I can't even look at you without wanting to personally murder you myself. If you hadn't guessed it, I'm through with you. Never expect me to take you back you evil cockroach!" She hissed.
"Oh, Harry. You had us so worried!" Mrs Weasley frowned, giving Harry a hug. "I'm sorry I worried you, Mrs Weasley. There really is no reason to, I'm perfectly fine!" Harry lied, smiling. He heard Hermione scoff and George rolled his eyes but neither of them said anything.
"Sorry Dad," Ron laughed, rolling his eyes. "Yes, sorry Daddy." Draco smirked and Ron did a double take and choke on his died out laughter. "Oh my God, I can't believe I didn't ask you sooner! Harry, are you top or bottom?" Hermione asked, which made Draco stop laughing too.
Ginny came bounding back in with Luna who was looking very confused. "Luuunnnaaaa!" Harry grinned. "Hi Harry! Wow, your head is simply overflowing with wrackspurts!" She smiled, sitting down and taking off her funky glasses. "Hi Luna! We're playing truth or dare, you spin the bottle," Hermione smiled, taking her third drink. It seemed they had an endless supply.
Harry thought back to the year he wrote that song. He had sort of just found out he had some kind of mixed feelings for Malfoy, but didn't have a clue what they meant because he didn't know anything about 'being gay' after living with the Dursley's almost his whole life.
"But, we lost many in the war. Remus and Tonks who got married and had a child, my godson, Teddy. He can change his appearance like Tonks could. He lives with Andromeda. We also lost Colin Creevey, Lavender Brown, Crabbe, Bellatrix, we think that Fenrir Greyback died but we aren't sure."
Harry seemed to be playing his guitar and singing, and when he finished there was applause. "What was that song that you sang to me, in the memory I saw? I really liked it." He said. "La vi en rose," an unfamiliar male voice replied. It seemed somehow distant.
"Now that you've tormented us a little bit, do you mind leaving, we were having a nice morning to ourselves before you came along." Draco smiled sarcastically. "Detention Malfoy! Tuesday night in my office!" Barton snarled then stormed away.
Harry became quite flustered at this gesture and was unsure what to do. "You place your hands on my waist," Draco whispered. Harry did as he was told and everything seemed in place for once.
Harry and Sirius watched memory after memory, bursting into fits of laughter when a new born baby Harry woke up in the middle of the night screaming and a freaked out James ran around the house as a stag, and into pools of tears when James proposed to Lily because it was so beautiful.
Harry finished clearing up and headed upstairs, exhausted. But, when he got there, he found Uncle Vernon sitting on his bed, looking like a beetroot. "I told you boy, to never ruin a meal again, and look what you did. I'm going to get you for this." Knowing what was coming, Harry braced himself, and sure enough. A full blow came to Harry's stomach. He was knocked to the ground and felt the full wrath of Vernon Dursley.
"I have one question for you," Harry said, looking up at Fudge and his companions, narrowing his eyes into an ice cold glare. "If you truly believed that my godfather was guilty, why didn't you let the dementors take him before his trial? Why did you even give him a trial, we all know you didn't last time! It's because there is a part inside all of you that knows he is innocent." Harry nodded and saw Sirius smiling at him from the corner of his eye. They were winning.
Sirius wasn't exactly happy that out of all boys it was Draco Malfoy Harry chose, but he knew that with the way he looked at Harry, Draco would go to the world's end to protect him. Just like he would have done with Remus, if he wasn't such a wimp.
"He's just sort of confirmed my beliefs about where his league was with Voldemort. He definitely was not under any curse after what we've seen him do to his own students." Draco had explained when Harry brought the subject up.
"Good," Hermione sniffled, wiping away her tears. "I talked to Ron earlier," Harry said, changing the subject and putting his shirt back on. "Asked him what he would do if I turned out to be gay. He said he'd never want to see me again. He said he'd want me to get out of his life and basically come back once I'd learned to be 'normal'. Or you know, just kill myself." He sighed, rolling his eyes.
"What is it?" Sirius asked. "Just a silly note from Luna- trying to waste Barton's time, nobody really likes him," Harry was about to bring up the cruciatus curse incident, but then decided against it. "I have to warn you, Harry. Barton made up this lie about being imperiused by the Dark Lord, but I know for a fact him and my brother joined his forces together, completely willingly." Sirius nodded solemnly.
Harry lead Sirius to the eighth year table where the students around then scuttled away. "I can't believe you would do something like that Harry." Sirius sighed, putting a sandwich on his Godsons plate. "It's alright, they need to know-"
He was so thin, he looked like a living corpse. Harry scrunched up his face in disgust, whilst counting every one of his ribs. Cuts and bruises littered Harry's arms, legs and torso. The only thing Harry liked about himself now,  was his hair. It had grown out a bit and gone curly on the top.
"I know that you were forced into getting it. The mark. I don't blame you for anything that happened. You never wanted it, I get it." He said, then started to try and tame his hair. "How did you know?" Draco asked. "That night, on the astronomy tower. I was there. I knew that you wouldn't do it. You looked so scared, by the time all the others had come up you had already lowered your wand. Then when Ron and Hermione and I were captured and I had the stinging jinx, it was clearly me. But you didn't tell. You always looked so scared." Draco just stared at the black haired boy, who wasn't even looking back at him.

"Um, clearly this is a bad time, so I'll come back later. But... Mrs Potter. I would never do anything to hurt Harry again. He's my best friend and I don't care about who he loves, as long as he's happy. On Halloween... there was a kid who changed my childhood and I regret ever listening to him. I'm really sorry and you totally deserve for you to be mad at me, just... Harry's my brother. I love him." Ron shrugged, ears turning pink. He flashed a smile at Harry then walked out shutting the door.
Laughter came from three grown men, one alive and wholesome and two a pearly white colour, floating in their midst. "Dad?" Harry chocked. The laughter stopped. James Potter's eyes welled with tears as his son ran up to him. "Harry, oh my sweet boy! You've grown so much, I sometimes can't believe it. Your Mum and I are so proud of you, we love you so much! We gave Dumbledore a right talking to when he arrived, for putting you in a home with those muggles." He spat.
"I've never told anybody this Harry but... And please don't hate me- I was in love with Remus. As in, the illegal way. Of course I never acted upon it, plus I liked girls too- and I still do, it was just that one boy... And now's he's gone. He'll never know." Harry felt his heart pang with guilt.  "I- I'm sorry, you must think I'm disgusting."
"If you spit it out, I will hex you." Draco said, drawing the spoon away from Harry. Cursing inside his head, Harry slowly chewed the eggs, thinking of a way he could possibly spit them out. But, finally giving up, he swallowed. In that moment, Harry had the sudden urge to throw up, so ran out of the hall, hand over his mouth. He ran to the nearest boys toilets and threw up. He heard the door open and close then a hand rubbing calming circles on his back.
Everything was perfect. Harry danced his woes away with his dream boy and didn't want anything to change. But it did. Ginny pulled Harry and Draco to the side and they gave her questioning looks. "There's been a breakout from Azkaban. Alex, your father, apparently he's out to get you. You need to be careful-" but before she could finish Draco had ran out. "I'm sorry, Harry!" She said in a quick and exasperated voice.
"Really says something when your childhood enemy understands you more than your best friend." Harry sniffed and watched Hermione walk out after Ron. "Are you okay Harry?" Malfoy asked. "What do you bloody think." He snapped, getting up and storming over to his bed. Harry got under the covers, rolled over so he wasn't facing Malfoy's bed and went to sleep.
"I'm so happy for you two!" Sirius beamed as some kids quickly ran past him with squeals. The great hall doors flew open again and some Dementors glided in towards them, the floating candles all extinguishing a suffiecent coldness glooming over them. "No!" Harry shouted. "He's innocent!"
So much had happened on that night days ago, Ron had come back and then Draco had broken up with Harry. His friends knew immediately that something was terribly wrong when he accepted Ron's apology straight away. Their usual Harry would have put up some sort of a fight first.
"What is it Potter, are you okay?" She questioned, jumping up and grabbing her wand from her desk. "I'm alright, I'm okay- I have to see Sirius! It's really important," he explained. McGonogall chuckled slightly then sat back down. "Mr Black has actually just come through my fireplace and I sent him in the direction of the eighth year tower." She smiled, and Harry thanked her then left.
"STOP, STOP!" Harry heard someone yell as the curse broke off again. He was no longer being tortured but his body was still writhing in pain, now in somebody's arms. "Mr Malfoy, first you show up late for my class and then interrupt my demonstration!" Barton snapped.
Harry and Draco met by the fountain, which had been restored to its original state of a witch, wizard, house elf, goblin and centaur. The boys had to resist the temptation to just grab each other for a kiss, or even just a hug!
"Nymphadora Tonks. And a son! Who knew you had it in you Moony. I'm so sorry. If I had found my way back sooner then maybe you wouldn't be... gone." Sirius cried, pained that he couldn't hug his lifelong best friend. "We aren't truly gone, Sirius. You know that." Another voice said from behind him. James.
"Y- you mean you're one of them?" Dudley gasped, his fat fingers pointing towards his cousin and the blonde boy. "Was, Duddeykins, was. I heard of you-know-who's downfall and Bella's death and it made me re-think some things. Of course I still despise that world, don't give me that look Vernon," she spat, turning towards an astonished Mr Dursley.
Harry winced as a knight was knocked down and smashed into pieces, and he shuffled closer to Draco who raised an eyebrow at him. "Harry! Where have you been all day, we were really worried when we couldn't find you, or Malfoy- we thought he had done something to you!"
He had gone to Diagon Alley, sent his letter to McGonagoll and bought his necessary books for the later year. He hadn't gotten any owls from anyone at all during the time they have had off. Harry wasn't surprised either, everyone probably hated him after the war. So many people were lost because of him. His mum, dad, Sirius, Remus, Tonks, Fred, Snape, Hedwig, Dobby, Dumbledore. So many people, all gone because of him.
Hermione and Ginny came into dorm number seven to see if the boys were okay and saw them asleep together on one bed. "Draco?" Ginny whispered, looking at the two. Hermione nodded and levitated Harry onto his own bed in case somebody came in and saw the two.
The week went a lot quicker than Harry's Monday morning, and soon he, Ron and Hermione were all sitting on Ron's bed on a Sunday evening, catching up with each other. Even though Harry was speaking with his two best friends again, he still couldn't get rid of that nagging feeling of guilt. He kept quiet for a while and let Ron ramble on. "Mum's a state. Was her first time getting out of bed to drop us off at the train. We had to call Hermione over to help Ginny cook, because none of us had a hope in hell." Ron chuckled, putting his hand on Hermione's leg.
Harry sat there, dumbfounded. "You might want to make your way to first lesson young man," the librarian said coming round the corner. Harry jumped and got up, slowly making his way to Defence Against the Dark Arts. When he got there, he took his place between Ron and Draco and sat down, getting his books out.
"Hey Gin, I was wondering, do you want to come to the Halloween party with me?" He asked. "I thought you'd never ask," She smiled, and pulled Harry into a long kiss. Harry, reluctantly, kissed back, not wanting to show any suspicion.
There was just one other figure in the courtyard, standing quite close. Draco. Harry looked at the pale blonde boy and didn't struggle as he was pulled into a hug. In fact, Harry just surrendered and burst into tears, sobbing into Draco's top.
"There was no point in you attacking me. Using some spell that Snivellous made up- and it wasn't even perfected! Whoever uses that sectumsempra curse are bloody dark, stupid and foolish wizards! You were foolish! I almost died and you got a small scratch boo fucking hoo."
Mr and Mrs Weasley sat on Harry's bed as well as George and Bill. "Harry, we heard you had an accident and came as soon as Minerva said we could! Ron came home but wouldn't tell us anything," Mrs Weasley smiled and looked Harry worriedly up and down. He was well aware that he didn't have any glamours on.
Dean stared at Luna and blinked slowly. He glanced at Seamus and smiled. "You have my word for it Luna!" He laughed. "Good, because she's mine!" Luna snapped. Dean and Seamus looked at the two girls in shock whilst Ginny blushed furiously at her girlfriends over protectiveness.

"So you're an unregistered, illegal animagus is what you're telling us?" Fudge smirked and Sirius just nodded. "Can our first witness please rise?" Amelia Bones said from next to Fudge, and James stood as Lily and Harry were escorted out. Once they were out of the room with just one ministry official standing guard by them, Harry turned to his mother.
Petunia signed again and stood up. "When you were first left on our doorstep, I was afraid of your powers, I could basically feel the magic radiating from you, so I put a block on your mind. Your magic goes way beyond the limits of a normal wizard, Harry. I know it would have been useful for fighting you-know-who, but I can remove the block now. I just need your wand." Harry hesitated, but then handed over his wand to his aunt's outstretched hand. "Reserare quod mente!" Petunia whispered while pointing the wand at Harry's head, but Harry did not feel any difference. "I don't feel any change?" Harry said, taking back his wand. "It'll take a while, a week or two maybe, but your full powers will be restored."
"Come in Harry, everyone wants to see you. None of this is your fault, nobody blames you for anything." And she walked back inside. Harry knew otherwise. Everything was his fault. If he had never been the stupid 'chosen one' then none of this would have happened.
Sirius and Harry ran out toward the door where Harry had left his parents earlier, only to find that neither were there. Before he could even begin to question their whereabouts, the door slammed open once more and a flood of people ran in and pulled Sirius into piles of hugs and congratulations. Draco slipped in and pulled Harry around the corner, out of sight. Firm in his beliefs that nobody could see them, Draco pulled him in to a long, tight hug. "Congratulations, emerald. You were amazing up there, and from your performance I simply cannot believe that you weren't placed into Slytherin!" He chuckled as Harry pulled back and poked him in the ribs, laughing softly.
Harry opened his eyes again and he was back in the hospital wing, still in Draco's arms and the tears very much real. He quickly sat up and wiped them away, not wanting to make eye contact with Draco. But he didn't have a choice as Draco took Harry's chin and turned his face towards him. "You're ok," Draco smiled, before leaning in and kissing Harry lightly on the lips. They drew apart, Draco clutching Harry's face when Madame Pomfrey came bustling into the room.
Harry couldn't stop staring. He never noticed how beautiful one simple colour could be. The eyes tore away from Harry and he looked around. Memories of last night Came rushing back to him and he felt a stab of guilt. "D- Draco?" Malfoy whipped around at the mention of his first name. "I'm sorry for snapping at you earlier. I know you were only trying to help." Draco smiled, nodded then climbed back into bed. Harry waited for Draco to fall back asleep, before creeping out to the common room. It was three in the morning, but Harry could never go back to sleep after that dream, that nightmare.
"Is that true?" Harry asked. Draco nodded, then grinned. "I had my food brought to me like I was royalty. Felt right at home!" Harry chuckled awkwardly. He had forgotten that Malfoy had had an easy (ish) life, being treated like a prince every day. Draco Malfoy, the ice prince, sitting here with pathetic Potter who tried to kill himself.
"That's brilliant Harry! What is it?" She asked, picking up a book and pretending to show him something as they sat at the a table. "Well, we are going to be wearing costumes, aren't we? So we can just transfigure our faces or something and nobody will know it's us. As for Ginny, I'm going to tell her everything because Ron said she accepts everyone. Then I'll be seen with her for five or ten minutes then go off with Draco!" He beamed.
"I was using your toilet once and found it there. My plan was to flush it down the toilet, but I wanted to confront you on it first," he smirked, looking at Harry's arms. "But now, I just want to give it back. Use it for the greater good." He hissed, then stormed out.
"Name?" She asked lamely, then looked up. "Merlins beard, it's Harry Potter! She quickly looked down her parchment and read "You are in room 7 Mr Potter. My name is Wilma the odd, but you can just call me Wilma." She smiled, and the portrait swung forward. Harry straight away headed for the door that had a big number 7 on it and lay on the bed with a red cover with gold accents.
Harry paused, looking at George who looked heartbroken and sympathetic, then back at Draco. Draco just nodded, signalling Harry to keep talking. "It's okay, you're doing really well." He smiled.
Harry's heart stopped and his insides froze as if he had already been wheeled to Azkaban, surrounded by dementors. "Oh, sure! Just take the Harry Potter to Azkaban as a way to say thank you for winning the war!" Amos Diggory shouted from beside Leonara. "My son may be gone, but Harry here did his best to save all of your lives, and your children! Cedric wouldn't have wanted Harry's ending like this."
"His scar used to hurt when you-know-who was close to him or trying to invade his mind, Minerva told me," Pomfrey agreed, rushing around Harry and checking him with different spells and potions. "We've kept it quiet around school, Potter. We've told people that you had fallen off your broom not being able to see in the night. I suspected with things like this, you don't want anybody to know and that's why you used the glamour?"
They sat next to a couple of Ravenclaws and Harry picked up a couple of grapes. He thought about what Malfoy would say if he was there. In fact, he wouldn't say anything, just pile food onto Harry's plate. Thinking about it now, where was Draco? Harry hadn't seen him since he kind of outed himself last night.
"But I thought they hated each other?" Ginny asked as Hermione shut the door. "Things change," Hermione shrugged. "People change."
"Oh, um- that's alright," Draco replied, a blush creeping daringly onto his face. "Really, Draco- without you Harry would have joined us far too soon. We can't thank you enough." Mrs Potter frowned, glaring at her son.
"Are you alright mate? You look a bit pale," Ron asked. Harry just nodded again, not even looking up at the two. He just stared out of the window, watching the train gather speed. He felt two pairs of eyes watching him carefully, but didn't act upon it.
"Put it this way. What would you do if I turned out to be gay? We've been best friends for eight years, Ron. Surely, you wouldn't just stop being friends with me because I love guys. Hypothetically, of course." Harry asked. Ron looked at him blankly, as if not even thinking about the question he had just asked. Then, he finally spoke up.
"Of course it's my fucking business, he's my boyfriend and quite frankly I don't want him to relapse again because of you! And don't look so surprised Weasel, you know that I am right." Draco pulled the wolf closer to his chest and Harry licked Draco's neck (which was the nearest thing to his wolfy snout), saying that it was alright.
"I, too have some evidence!" Barton cried from the witness stand. He showed the court the photo from Harry and Draco's date the other night and Harry scoffed. "That's a girl," he stated. "Some girl from a lower year in school who had been obsessing over me, so I thought that I would give her what she wanted as well as testing for myself. Look at the delicacy of the hands, that's clearly a female." The court looked at the photo again and all nodded in agreement. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw Draco looking all annoyed and huffy and it just melted Harry's heart. Draco spotted Harry looking and flipped him off while the court were obsessing over the photo. Harry smirked and shrugged, laughing quietly.
"What do you mean I'm right?" Hermione asked. "Barton was a death eater. He was at Malfoy Manor a couple of times. He was apparently under the imperius curse and was never even given the mark. You-know-who thought he was too pathetic to receive his mark." Harry, Ron and Hermione stared at Malfoy in shock. "Close your mouths, your gonna catch flies." Malfoy said, rolling his eyes. "Why would McGonagall hire an ex death eater?" Ron asked. "Only The Dark Lord, Bellatrix, Mother, Father and I knew who he was. He was too cowardly to even show up in the war." Draco said, then left without another word.
"It's okay, I understand. We were all grieving. Nobody had time for me," Harry smiled sadly. "Um, except me!" Draco said. Harry flashed Draco and smile and turned back to George. The ginger haired boy stared at the two curiously, then his eyes landed on their hands clutched together and smirked. "When you say Ron 'caught' you, what did you mean exactly? Is there going to be a little Potter-Malfoy running around?" George snickered.
"He only started getting better when his friends and family were there to help him. Lily finally said yes to being his official girlfriend too and that lifted his spirits. One of the main reasons why he wasn't getting better was because he didn't open up to us and he felt so lonely and depressed, I guess. People had assumed that James and Lily had been a couple for ages, but it was only real when he asked and opened up to her, and she helped him in numerous different ways, like Ginny will help you, Harry, if you let her."
Overwhelmed with pain, Harry passed out but Draco stood up and pinned Barton against the wall by the neck. "You dare hurt Harry again and you'll be dead in a heartbeat." He growled. He picked Harry up over his shoulder and stormed out of the classroom. Barton cleared his throat at the shocked class who were now looking at him in fear.
"Nothing, really. We did share a couple of kisses before the war, but I haven't spoken to her since. It's a little bit awkward if you ask me." Harry chuckled. The only time he had seen her was getting on the train. "Do you still have feelings for her now? I know for sure she does. It's bloody annoying, the only time she speaks to me is about you." Ron said, rolling his eyes.
The common room was almost empty apart from two Gryffindor boys Harry recognised as Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnegan. Harry was about to walk away, when he saw Dean lean in to Seamus and they kissed. "Holy shit." Harry accidentally said The two boys stood up and stared at Harry. Multiple bottles of Fire whiskey scattered the floor around them. It must have been a drunk kiss or something, Harry thought as they ran off into their dorm.
"I'm so sorry!" He chocked as his best friends attempted to out their hands on his shoulders, only for them to fall through. "You have to be strong, Sirius. For Harry. For Teddy. For us." Lupin smiled sadly. "I know," Sirius sniffled. "It's just hard sometimes." James and Remus looked sadly at the only living Marauder. "We know, Pads. We know."
Harry didn't care anymore, in fact he had gotten used to not eating so much, he didn't even want to when he could. Through the break, Harry's beatings just got worse and worse. He could hide during the days seems as Dudley had school and Vernon had work, so it was just him and Petunia, but Harry just did his chores then stayed in his room.
"Go and find him Draco! Tell him that you're in love with me!" She squealed, and Draco obeyed, although the screaming voice in the back of his head told him not to. That voice, not his, sounded so familiar yet Draco couldn't pin a point on it. So as he ran up the steps of the school, Pansy following behind him excitedly, acting like a kid about to be taken to get their first wand, he caught up with Harry and yanked the neck of his robes.
"I came with a note for Potter. Don't know who it's from, so don't ask. Miss lovegood gave it to me and told me I wasn't to look at it and it goes straight to you." Barton drawled and gave Harry a small piece of parchment.
Fred looked at Percy with glee. "You actually are joking Perce... I don't think I've heard you joke since you were.."

"Oh yeah, that's right. Everyone you know just drops dead at your feet." "Ronald, stop!" Hermione gasped. Harry just stood there, processing the words. "Your right. It is my fault." Harry whispered, tears rolling down his face.
Harry smiled and offered his hand out to Draco. "Care for a dance, m'lady?" He asked formally. "Why, of course!" Draco giggled and they walked onto the dance floor. A slow song started playing so Draco put his hands around Harry's neck.
His hair started with black at the roots, then slowly turned blue toward the bottom, but still in his curly mess. His eyes were a deep voilet, matching Draco's eyes. They looked at each other and grinned, then burst out laughing. It was the first time Harry had laughed properly since the war. He was happy, and it was all thanks to the boy stood in front of him.
"So, the more Harry gets better, the more red his heart will get?" Draco asked and Hermione nodded. She then up and left claiming she needed sleep and the boys should too, after all they had class the next day and they needed rest.
Harry blushed ferociously, but didn't make any movement to stop Draco. "Let's eat." Draco whispered and turned around in Harry's lap, leaving a gaping Harry staring at the back of his head. Draco popped a bit of sandwich into Harry's mouth, bringing him back to reality.
“I’m not afraid of those imbeciles.” Draco said defiantly. “I can take care of myself. Why do you even care?”
Harry walked over and stood in front of Draco. He extended his hand. Draco’s lips twitched up at the action and he reached out and shook Harry’s hand. His hand was cool and soft in Harry’s. Right about then is when Ron walked into the room and Harry and Draco released each other’s hands.
“Hm. What’s that spell you mentioned the other day?” The third one asked the girl quietly, another boy around the same age with sandy blond hair and also in Slytherin robes.
“I know, but I expected any room you inhabited to be drenched in Gryffindor colors.” Harry rolled his eyes at that and flipped his trunk open.
“Goodnight Harry.” Hermione replied looking up from where her head was on Ron’s chest to give him a small smile.
“Um.” Draco said. He looked like he was ready to run, but Harry’s hands were still on his hips. Gathering the last scraps of his Gryffindor courage Harry tightened his hands on Draco’s hips. His eyes snapped back to Harry’s and there was confusion on his face mingled with the slightest bit of hope.
“I want you.” Harry said firmly. “I don’t care about what anyone else wants.” He could see the happiness spreading on Draco’s face, but uncertainty was trying to push it back off. Harry leaned in and kissed him again trying to make him understand that this was real, they could have what they wanted, rest of the wizarding world be damned. Draco kissed him back desperately. When they pulled back Draco’s face had cleared. He smiled at Harry.
“I’m just not sure what I want anymore. I thought I had a plan in mind, but after everything that’s happened…” He trailed off not knowing how to explain the conflict in his head.
“I recently had a very similar conversation with Draco.” She informed him. Harry’s eyebrows shot up.
“That’s nice of him.” Was all Ron had to say before returning to his breakfast. Harry had really been expecting a more intense reaction. When he only continued to stare at his best friend in disbelief Ron added, “You should probably open it. Be kind of rude not to.”
A few other times when he checked it he found Malfoy in the library and it was pure coincidence that Harry decided he could use a bit of study time too.
“McGonagall wanted to have a word. Draco Malfoy will be staying with us in the 8th year dorms and she didn’t want any fuss over it so she warned me and asked me to mention it to anyone who may have a problem. She says we’re to leave each other alone and not get into any fights.”
Harry started thinking on the way back to Privet Drive. Now that he could do magic outside of Hogwarts, things could change with the Dursley's he could finally use magic without getting another letter saying he was expelled, he had finished Hogwarts anyway. As soon as they got in, Harry ran up to his room and put his trunk into his wardrobe. He stuck his wand into his pocket and headed downstairs to start on his chores.
"Oh, are all you Weasley's this dumb?" Draco sighed. "Just tell him Harry, he's never going to guess." Harry looked back at George who still looked confused. He took a deep breath and decided to tell the whole truth.
Harry put his hand in his pocket and felt that it wasn't there anymore. "You carry that around? Are you mental! You told me you didn't have it anymore, that you lost it!" Draco growled. "You knew about this and you didn't help! Of course you didn't help, you're a Malfoy. Get off Harry, now, just because you have to share a room doesn't mean you get to act like you and Harry have been best friends since first year," George snarled.
Harry made his way over to the largest pumpkin where he and Draco had planned to meet. But, when he got there, he saw nobody behind it. He looked around, but couldn't see purple hair anywhere. Harry sat down on the floor, blue hair flopping over his eyes and watched others dance.
Harry nodded and said his goodbyes to Sirius before going into the bathroom to clean up his hands. Draco was in there with a towel wrapped around his waist and his wet hair flopping over his forehead. Harry just stared at this beauty in front of him; his hair, his eyes, his lips, his face... His abs. Harry drew in a sharp breath, blushing at his own thoughts.
Harry looked up at Draco questioningly, a slight smirk upon his face. "Yeah. What are you going to do about it?" Harry dared and Draco just smiled and rolled his eyes and kissed his boyfriend, wrapping his arms around Harry's slender waist and keeping him against the tree. The kiss lasted for what felt like an eternity, only stopping once in a while for breaths.
He held out a hand to help Harry up, but Harry misread the gesture and flinched away, trying to get as far away from the other boy as possible. "Potter, let me help you. Tell me who did all that to you and we can fix it." Harry shook his head frantically. Why did Malfoy care so much? Why, after all this time, was he being nice now? "Potter talk to me!" Malfoy now shouted.
"What did you actually smell?" Hermione whispered as the professor moved on to the next successful potion. "Hair product, cologne and green apples," Harry admitted, not even bothering to ask how she knew. "Draco." Hermione nodded, and although it went unnoticed by the them, at the mention of his name, Draco looked over at the two. What Harry didn't know, was that another boy had also lied about what he had smelled, and it had just so happened to be his dorm mate.
"James only told us in the beginning of seventh year. One of the few times I've seen your Dad cry. He told us everything, that he'd been so ill all this time and the potions weren't working. He was scared he was going to die and that's why he was so cocky all the time. He didn't want to show that he was afraid, just like the rest of us are at the worst of times."
Harry and Draco spent the rest of their day inside the fort, not wanting to go to any lessons after the episode with Barton. Harry found it more embarrassing than anything, anyone would expect the boy who lived to not react in such pain he did.

Before Harry could talk, Sirius interrupted him. "Do you mind if we head on over to the Gryffindor tower?" Harry blinked at his Godfather, then nodded. They walked over in silence, and once again, the students fled. "I'm never going to get used to that. People used to run to me when I walked in, not away." Sirius frowned.
"Wait, so you aren't gay anymore?" Ron asked, now purely confused. "I- I don't know. I've only ever had feelings for one boy and that was Malfoy, but now that's done and dusted... I just don't see anybody in that way anymore." Harry shrugged.
Harry looked around and saw Ron and Hermione standing together, holding hands. No doubt they had been together all summer, not even thinking about Harry. "On the train now, all of you else it will leave without you." Mrs Weasley rushed and pushed the four teens onto the train. With a final wave, they went to look for seats. Harry set off and found a compartment, where Hermione and Ron followed him in, Ginny had probably gone to meet some other friends.
So when everybody had left, Harry headed towards the library to gather up some things for his potions essay. He found a book that looked like it would help him and flicked through a few of its pages. "Just a recipe book, helpful!" Harry scoffed and was about to put it back when it fell onto a page that made his heart stop.
"It's alright. I love you and Mum so much, I wish I could've grown up with you. In our home. With a loving family!" Harry cried. Sirius and Remus both came over and Sirius wrapped his arm around Harry, giving him the comfort his father couldn't. "Your going to give a family the love we were never able to give you, Harry." A female voice appeared.
"You know what will make you even more sure of it?" Seamus said in his thick Irish accent then kissed Dean full on the lips. It was Luna's turn to wear shock on her face. "Wait, so only them three are straight?" She asked, pointing at Harry, Hermione and Draco.
That was, until, a certain pale haired, grey eyed boy walked in and sat down. "Potter, I just wanted to say... sorry." He finally said. Harry looked up at Malfoy curiously. "I'm sorry for being such a cruel git to you and your friends all the time through the years. I really mean it. I don't know why I did it to be honest, I guess I don't handle rejection very well," he awkwardly chuckled. Harry just nodded in response and suddenly became very interested in the seat design.
"It was a stag, Draco. I don't know what it means, but I know it means something, so I have to ask you, just this one thing," Harry took a deep breath in and stared into those grey eyes he had always loved to look in. "Will you be my boyfriend... Officially?" Harry spoke, holding that breath and awaiting his answer. Then, Draco started to laugh.
After Ron had heard about Sirius coming back in the Prophet and his soon-to-be trial for innocence, he started to pack his trunk. Nothing else mattered anymore, Harry's life was being pulled together and quite frankly, Ron wanted to be a part of that too. He needed his best friend back.
They danced together, words unnecessary for all their emotions had been translated into dance. They waltzed around the room, falling into perfect step oblivious to everybody else in the room. For now, it was just the two of them.
Harry stared at the anonymous letter, trying to figure out who 'D' could be, before giving up and crawling into bed. Tomorrow would be a Saturday which means Vernon and Dudley would both be home all day. Harry lay there, wondering who could've wrote that letter and what on earth they wanted to talk about.
"Sorry Professor, not in the mood to deflect curses today," Harry shrugged. "Alright then," Barton said to Harry's surprise. "Mr Weasley!"
Harry pocketed the blade and went back inside the hospital wing where Draco was pacing a corner, mumbling curses to himself and Ginny was comforting Hermione once again. "Ron said he's leaving Hogwarts. You don't ever have to even look at him again," Ginny nodded.
"Can you promise me, promise me that it isn't a joke or some foolish way to make fun of me?" Harry spoke. "I promise, cross my heart and swear upon Merlin!" Draco answered defiantly. "How could I pretend to be with someone and build a fort with them, come on, I only do that with the most special people!" He winked and Harry smiled, then gasped.
Harry took the bottle and just turned it to Draco. He didn't even bother to use magic this time. "Harry, that isn't how you-" but the rest of Draco's sentence was muffled by Harry's hand over his mouth. "Truth or dare, Ferret?" Harry grinned, drawing his hand back.
Harry found an empty compartment on the Hogwarts express, and sat in silence. The train didn't have the same happy magic than it did when Harry first boarded it in his 1st year, when he first met Ron and Hermione. Everyone on the train seemed to have someone to sit with, to talk to, to find comfort with. But Harry sat alone. The train headed off and just a little bit into the journey, his compartment door opened. Malfoy stood there, not holding his usual posh posture but looking more broken.
After Petunia left, Harry and Draco stayed seated in the living room of 12 Grimmauld Place sharing a warm embrace, whilst Sirius got ready for his trial. Soon enough, he came in dressed in a nice suit with his hair combed and beard tamed. "Ready Harry?" Sirius asked, nerves forcing his voice to quiver. "No. Are you?" Harry asked, looking up. "No. But it will be fine, I have you and your parents backing me up, I think we'll be okay."
“You’re sure you want that kind of publicity?” Draco asked skeptically. He tried to make light of it, but Harry could tell he meant much more than what the prophet would say about them.
“You shouldn’t thank me. I likely wouldn’t have if Draco hadn’t still been in the school.” There was defiance in her eyes telling him not to argue. To not make her out to be a hero when her intentions had never been to save Harry.
“I um, think I’ll join them to get some work done. Did you want to come down too?” Harry asked tentatively.
As Harry neared the corridor that Malfoy was in he ducked into an alcove and pulled on the invisibility cloak. He checked the map again and saw that Malfoy’s dot was moving out of the room and down the hall. He was debating between leaving it alone and following Malfoy when he heard voices around the corner. He’d been so focused on Malfoy’s dot that he hadn’t noticed three other dots coming up on the hallway as well. Harry rounded the corner to walk past them.
