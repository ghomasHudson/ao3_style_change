,” Teddy pouted, sticking his lower lip out dramatically and letting it tremble. His hair swiftly began to lighten, bleached of all color; amber eyes morphed to hazel, seeming to waver as if unsure of which hue they should settle on. After a moment, Harry huffed out an amused breath.
bottoms for him, after all. Why else but to tempt him with your goods?”

“Yeah…” Harry took a lazy sip of his drink before gazing curiously at Ron. “Y’know, Ron...you never actually told me how you saw Malfoy on a regular basis—with his special

Harry chuckled, “Grab your things, and then we can go.”
that I was about to fuck you.”
Harry wavered, observing the Kneazle as it curled up contentedly in Teddy’s lap. He hadn’t had any other pets or familiars live with him since Hedwig, and hadn’t thought he wanted another one at all. If he had, he certainly never considered having a Kneazle. While he did not dislike the creatures, his experiences with Crookshanks had never endeared the species to him.
Malfoy really was not suited to a warm kitchen.
The remainder of their weekend passed quickly, and it was late when Harry brought Teddy back to Andromeda’s on Sunday evening. Harry and Andromeda made promises to catch up the following Saturday, and with a gentle kiss to Teddy’s forehead, Harry returned home.
“Why are you such an oblivious git?”
“Yes, of course!”
Harry blinked, licking his lips as he attempted to reorient himself. Turning back to Teddy, who watched him inquisitively, Harry smiled shakily.
, hypothetically. But...no. You can’t mean that. That would mean that Draco—“ Harry breathed in sharply. “No, he doesn’t.
Harry blinked, hesitating as he tried to wrap his mind around the fact that he had

“Do you feel better now, Harry?” Teddy interrupted, looking up at him with wide emerald eyes.
“It is,” Draco hummed, failing to hide his mirth.
They shook hands, that was all. Agreed that they could and
Harry sighed, calling out, “I’m in the kitchen, Gin.”
Everything is so
Teddy cried, letting out a high pitched scream of agony. He began to plead between choked sobs, crying out for his cousin.
He was too late.
Malfoy let out a soft sigh, running his fingers through his silky blonde hair as he glanced to the side, not looking at Harry. “Despite the distinct lack of finesse in his argument, Tedward is correct, Potter.”
“Nope!” Ginny quickly thrust her hand forward, resting her index finger against Harry’s lips to prevent him from speaking. “No, you are going to
“Why, what?” Potter questions, fingers pulling at the zip of your trousers, slowly making his way down your body.
An elderly man stood behind a counter at the back of the shop and smiled kindly at them, “Welcome. What companion are you searching for today?”
Draco blinked once, twice, his tongue darting out to wet his lips before speaking hesitantly, “Are you certain?”
He also cursed Ginny. Surely she had jinxed him with her insistence that he
“Mm,” Draco hummed, eyes slanting to look at Harry assessingly. “And why would you want to do that?”
Still standing atop the stool, where he was supposed to be placing crumble over the blackcurrant concoction, Teddy froze as he stared at them.
Reaching for you…
—you land.
“Draco...” Teddy whispered, tugging gently at Malfoy’s finger, clutched in his small fist. “Remember...Nana said to behave.”
Harry watched dumbfounded as Ginny scrambled from the loveseat towards the hearth, reaching for the Floo powder to call Hannah while the rest of them remained seated.
“What?” Harry snapped his gaze back towards Malfoy, who continued to look over Harry’s shoulder, as if he were searching for Teddy. He doubted that Malfoy would have to head to St. Mungo’s so soon, when it was still well within his regular time with Teddy. “Why? Are you on call at St. Mungo’s?”
“No, no, no!” Teddy let go of Draco’s hands and ran behind him, placing his hands on the small of Draco’s back and beginning to
Teddy sniffed, glancing down at the floor dejectedly, “Yes...”

“I would have warned you if you hadn’t bitten me,” he taunted, knocking twice on the front door before pushing it open.
They both startled.
Andromeda’s Parisian nose wrinkled as she grimaced, before giving Teddy one more gentle push out of the room. “I’m afraid toasties will have to wait for Draco’s return. We will eat a proper meal, don’t you worry.”
Harry forward.
As he carefully set Teddy on the floor, both Malfoy and Teddy looked up at Harry at the same moment. Malfoy’s cool gaze faltered, his eyes widening as they slid over Harry’s body. Meanwhile, Teddy’s bright grin trembled, quickly replaced by a quizzical look as his eyes morphed, silver irises staring curiously at his godfather.
What the hell was going on?
Harry felt as if he couldn’t breathe—all of the air in his lungs rushing out of him at once.
This didn’t make any sense.
Harry heard a breath hitch and glanced up.

Fingers wander under your shirt, playing with the hair leading to your groin. They clutch at your hips, pulling you closer. Nails dig into your skin, sharp pricks of pain that bring you back to the surface, if only for a moment.

“Really?” they both asked, voices high with excitement.

Hermione. With a deep inhale, Harry took one peace of torn bread and placed it in his mouth, chewing slowly as he contemplated the table.
“Teddy...” Harry choked out. “Please, talk to me.”
“Er...Teddy,” he coughed, running a hand through his messy hair in an effort to gather his thoughts, “I’m not sure that we can keep him. Andy won’t—”
“You’re so early!” Teddy exclaimed as he pulled away, eyes alight.

“Er...what?” Harry asked.
“I did,” Harry laughed, though it felt strained to his own ears. “You were
Malfoy’s eyes flickered across Harry’s face. They seemed to pause, briefly, near Harry’s lips, but snapped back up to Harry’s eyes so quickly that he could not be sure.
Teddy sniffed softly as he pulled away, offering a shaky smile to his cousin before he turned towards Harry. “Alright. We can go now.”
With a slow, graceful movement, the Kneazle leapt from its perch and strode towards the barrier until it was on the opposite side directly in front of Teddy. Blinking, it sat down, tail wrapping pristinely around its front paws, steady gaze not faltering from Teddy’s own.
Harry blinked his eyes open, disoriented for a moment as the world blurred before him. His fingers twitched, feeling soft flesh, the warm body pressed against his chest squirming at the touch. He grinned, turning his face into Draco’s neck as he wrapped his arm more firmly around the other man, curling against his back.
echoed throughout the room.
“Harry James Potter!” Andromeda hissed, features sharp in her fury. “I will not have you speaking with such foul language in front of Teddy, or towards Draco. What did I tell you the other week?” Behind her, Teddy whined softly, his fingers clutching at her robes.
“Wait, what?” Harry’s heart began thundering against his chest. He leaned forward, placing his hands atop his thighs and digging his nails into them, relishing the sharp prick of pain that reminded him this was real. “What do you mean,

“Nothing,” Harry repeated, furrowing his brows and returning his gaze to the sink. “Everyone else has been busy, is all. And I’ve been doing things around here. It’s fine.”
Draco’s eyes sparkled as he stared at Harry, left cheek dimpling, flush spreading to the tips of his ears. Harry couldn’t help but grin as Draco nodded. “Another time.”
“Because, I...” Harry swallowed, licking his lips nervously before squaring his shoulders. “I like you, Draco. Rather a lot. And I know—I

Hermione coughed softly. “Ginny, I’m not sure if—“
Draco paused—and whether it was because of the desperation in Harry’s voice or the fact that Harry was literally holding him back, Harry did not care.
Harry hastily began to recount what had happened that weekend. Between how suspicious it had been that Malfoy was spending time with Teddy and Andromeda at all—let alone that he had been hand-washing dishes like a

“Isn’t he too young to be flying? He’s not yet six!”

to know?”
Of course, Harry had started arriving earlier than expected, and today would be no different. Harry had every intention of arriving well before lunch, to allow him more time to investigate what Malfoy’s motivation actually was.
Fingers clutch at your hair, your hips, pulling you closer…
“Oh...I thought you’d like him, honestly,” Ron frowned, “I mean...He’s a good bloke, far as I can tell. Besides, I have the feeling he’ll be around a lot more soon.”
“That’s exactly what he

can see.
“...What are you saying, exactly?”
He swept his gaze from Draco, hovering gracefully on the outskirts of the pitch, to Ginny, darting quickly from one group of children to another as she organized the camp.
Malfoy’s sharp face softened as he ran a hand over Teddy’s forehead, brushing the boy’s locks from his forehead in a gesture so adoring that Harry was dumbstruck.
“I know I did, Tedward,” Draco said. His voice was low, soft and apologetic. Harry turned the corner to see Draco kneeling in front of Teddy, one hand resting on the boy’s shoulder, the other smoothing down Teddy’s tangled, curly, turquoise strands. Teddy looked up at him desperately with wet green eyes. “But I am training in the A&E, and I cannot ignore St. Mungo’s when they call me in. Someone is hurt; I have to go and help them. You know that, don’t you?”
Draco chucked quietly, vanishing the flannel and crawling back into bed. He lay down beside Harry, lifting the blankets to cover them both.
“Magizoology is a fascinating area of study,” Hermione nodded contemplatively, deftly ignoring Ginny’s chuckles.
“Will we see you at the Quidditch Camp on Saturday?” Harry asked quietly as Draco took a handful of Floo powder.
“Oh, er...yeah,” Harry’s eyes shifted down the hallway and he ran a hand through his messy hair, fingers catching in the curls, “Er...I got done at Neville’s early and figured I’d drop by, have lunch with you and Teddy before you Floo-ed out.”
“Something dark and cunning?” George snickered, “That’s why you’ve got to keep an eye on him, eh? Always up to something, that deviant...
Teddy’s silver eyes widened as he watched Harry. His calico-colored hair began to lighten, orange hues morphing into a strawberry blond before continuing to bleed of color.
Draco’s lips twitched, his cheek dimpling as his eyes began to sparkle. “That was not what I was questioning, but thank you for the reassurance.”
Harry to see it.
“Ah, and what was the job of the day this time?” Andromeda’s lips curled with amusement, her brown eyes glimmering mischievously.
“What the—? What the fuck are you doing, Malfoy?”
Harry inhaled sharply. The warmth that had spread through him only moments before reignited, molten lava burning through his veins. His heart was thrumming loudly against his chest, and he was sure that Draco and Teddy would be able to hear it, but Draco kept reading
He took a shuddering breath, shaky and unsure, “And Jesse thinks that
“You’re leaving?” Harry asked hesitantly, shifting slightly from one foot to the other.
Harry hummed, ruffling Teddy’s hair as he sprawled across the armchair. Gary meowed at him, jumping onto Teddy’s lap and purring loudly as he settled.
The fire…
With a sharp tug, Harry was pulled from the kitchen. The two of them stumbled into the sitting room, Teddy bouncing on his feet as Harry reached for the Floo powder. His hands were clutching his overnight bag as he vibrated with excitement.
You need it.

“My name is
Harry and Teddy stayed silent in the sitting room, listening to the soft echoes of Malfoy’s footsteps as he walked through the cottage. The front door creaked as it was opened and then shut, a soft
His voice is hoarse, quiet.
Movement behind Draco caught Harry’s attention, and he reluctantly pulled his eyes away, stiffening when he found himself staring directly at Jesse.
“You’re a coward, Potter.”
Andromeda nodded as she stopped in front of him, lifting her thin hand to gently pat his cheek, “Yes, dear. Cissy wanted me to Portkey over as quickly as possible today. There is a charity event this afternoon she wants me to accompany her to, and it requires an early arrival. My only delay in departing was to ensure that you arrived for Teddy.”
“Mm...perhaps not,” Hermione hummed. “It is curious, however, the instances in which Teddy appears to morph without control.”
for the already toned length of Draco’s legs, a crisp white shirt tucked into them. The first few buttons of his shirt were undone, Teddy’s small fist clutching on one lapel and further revealing the tantalizing dip of Draco’s collarbones.
“Yeah...” Harry hesitated as he narrowed his eyes at his friend. He walked over from the booze cupboard, placing two fingers of Firewhisky next to her and handing one to Ron, who sat on the floor next to his girlfriend.

Teddy was laughing delightedly, his head thrown back in mirth as he swayed to the music. His arms were wrapped tightly around Malfoy’s hips, feet settled atop Malfoy’s shoes, as Malfoy guided them across the empty floor.
“Oh, right. Of course,” Harry’s shoulders slumped as he nodded in understanding. He hesitated, taking a deep breath, before quickly saying, “Another time, then.”
everyone to think,” Harry proclaimed, his hands hitting the kitchen table with more force than he’d intended. “He’s sitting around, doing what? Nothing. Turning up at Andy’s home at all hours to corrupt poor Teddy!”
Ron suddenly sat up straight, nearly knocking his glass of wine over in his excitement. “What about Hannah’s café?”
“Yes, I know, but what does that have to do with anything?” he asked, gaze flickering to Ron and Ginny to see if they were as dumbfounded as he felt. They both merely stood there, watching the exchange with obvious amusement.
“Harry—” Draco huffed, rolling his eyes before leaning forward and caging Harry against the wall, hands pressed on either side of his head. “You do realize now that we have been dancing around
He said he did not need it…
Harry’s lips parted on a quiet gasp, his eyes widening slightly as he stared at Malfoy. His stomach flipped, cheeks heating at the sound of his name on Malfoy’s tongue. The tips of Malfoy’s ears and his cheeks were flushed as he quickly looked away, focusing once more on Teddy.
“Right.” Draco nodded hastily. As he strode past, making his way to the steep stairwell and towards Teddy, Draco’s fingers brushed lightly against Harry’s own.
You leave.
“Like us?” Ron asked.
“Mmm...are you quite sure about that, darling?” Ginny asked, her voice dipping low with a sultry smirk. “I mean...you did wear those
As soon as Andromeda was out of sight, Teddy spun and looked excitedly up at Harry. “Can we go now? I want to see Gary!”
Ron cleared his throat and Harry tore his gaze away. Hesitantly, he looked at his friend, flushing with embarrassment as he met Ron’s knowing gaze.
“Teddy? Andy?” He called out, frowning. He had expected to hear activity from the direction of the library, where Teddy liked to practise morphing with Malfoy, or the kitchen, where Teddy liked to watch Malfoy prepare lunch—and the image of Malfoy cooking was something Harry couldn’t possibly fathom, so he hastily pushed it from his mind.
Draco swallowed, the
He must think the cooling charms were malfunctioning as well, Harry thought as he chewed at the inside of his cheek and looked away once more.
The children continued flying, Teddy included, preoccupied with the Quidditch Camp, while Harry stared at the border of the pitch.
“Of course,” Malfoy nodded, standing in one graceful movement, his lean body towering over the table. “Mother will surely be looking forward to your arrival. Do you need any assistance with your luggage?’
Malfoy was focused on Teddy, brows furrowed in contemplation and eyes narrowed as he considered the child. If he were anyone but Malfoy, Harry would think that he looked suspicious. But surely Malfoy wouldn’t be suspicious of Teddy...if anything, he was teaching Teddy his devious ways...right?
“So what?” He frowned, flummoxed by Ginny’s amusement. “You already know he’s a metamorphmagus.” He turned back towards Ron and Hermione for support, since they had all
The following weekend, Harry made sure to Apparate to Andromeda’s well before he was expected to pick up Teddy. He had never seen Malfoy there before, but had since realized he may have simply missed Malfoy’s visits to the cottage.
A soft sigh escaped Harry’s lips as he leaned back against the cool tile wall, shivering at the contrast from the steam of the water pouring over him.
“Alright,” Harry agreed slowly, eyes flickering towards Draco. His lips were parted, lower lip plump from where he must have been biting at it. “Er...whenever you’re free, Draco. I’ll adjust the wards so that you can Apparate or Floo in whenever you’re free.”
“It’s delightful to have you join us early. Teddy and I were just deciding which vegetables we would use for today’s luncheon,” Andromeda nodded towards the vegetation in front of her, “Teddy thinks we should use fresh tomatoes in our pasta. I am of the opinion that we should experiment with aubergine. What are your thoughts?”
…but not just
“Draco!” Teddy launched himself at his cousin, wrapping his arms tightly around the man’s neck, much as he had to Harry mere minutes before. A noise huffed from Malfoy—Harry would call it a chuckle, if it were from anyone else—as he lifted Teddy into the air.
“Anyway, how is Teddy doing, Harry?” Ron asked, stirring the stew before raising a spoonful to taste.
He wanted this every night. Teddy—at Grimmauld place—curled against Draco’s side at the end of the night as Draco read him a bedtime story.
His voice is hushed, but deadly—echoing in your ears with the violence of a wildfire. His thumb rubs circles against your mark.
“Alright, we’ll go see Draco.”

Proof of
“Why?”
Teddy’s eyes flared, morphing quickly between amber, emerald, and molten silver before settling to a stormy grey, a thin circle of green enveloping his pupils. His fists clenched together, resting on his hips as he glared up at Harry.
Harry inhaled sharply. His shocking dismissal from the Aurors had not been private, but rather had been splashed across the papers, as everyone speculated on how The Chosen One refused to follow orders and always jumped to conclusions. That had been three years ago, however, and since then his endeavors had been kept quiet. Jumping from one job to another, Harry’s inadequacies were well known to those close to him, but kept from the gossip columns. That Malfoy knew of them could only mean he had forced Harry’s secrets from someone he trusted—Andromeda and Teddy.
, not with Ginny looking at him like that. Harry spared a quick glance at Ron and Hermione, who just watched him quietly, before turning back to Ginny.
, of all people.
“I don’t know, mate,” Ron hesitated, chewing on his lip, “You know I’m not a fan of the ferret, but I don’t think you need to worry about this. His record is clean, it’d come across my desk if he did anything.”
Malfoy inhaled sharply, his cheeks beginning to flush. Aglow with guilt, Harry thought, as he stared at the rosy blush.
Harry groaned, reaching weakly for the vial that Kreacher held out to him. “Thanks, Kreacher.”
to bring Teddy to Draco, and Harry couldn’t regret his decision. Even disregarding Draco’s training as a Healer and the fact that Teddy had asked for him, Draco’s response was reason enough. Rushing into the room, frantic and disheveled, yet calm and soothing when healing Teddy, Draco had been extraordinary.
“Er...” Harry blinked, recalling what he had said and realizing that yes, he
Your fingers dig into his sides, marking him—
Harry huffed a quick laugh, relaxing in his seat. Relieved that Andromeda was not worried that Teddy had been hurt while in his care, he reached once more for his tea. “Yeah, he was. Teddy wouldn’t let me heal him—only wanted Draco. And Draco was brilliant!”
“Yes, I just...” Harry took a deep breath, trying to calm himself, before spitting out, “He’s such a

“Yeah, and maybe I’m the bloody Queen of England,” Harry scoffed, crossing his arms as he leaned back in his chair, “They’re not his

“Turn over,” Draco growled.
You raise your gaze, looking through the smokey window of the door—past the flames consuming the glass—until they catch…
“Fine...” Harry chewed at his lip, glancing out of the window above the sink to gaze out at his garden as he gathered himself. “You were right...okay?”
You whisper, “I’m sorry…”
Malfoy quirked one brow towards Harry—a question, though Harry had no clue what. He merely rolled his eyes and shrugged in response. Malfoy’s lips twitched in what Harry might have thought was amusement had it been on anyone else, before he turned his gaze from Harry and focused on Teddy.
Ginny threw her head back and laughed, “Of course, darling! Come along, let’s fly!”
You look down your body and grimace.
Harry bit at his lips, trying to stop himself from teasing Malfoy for his flushed face, when his eyes caught on a streak of flour across Malfoy’s left cheekbone. It was a thick, white line, standing out starkly against the blush spreading across Malfoy’s sharp features.
“Oh, no. I think it’s time for bed,” Harry chuckled, standing up from where he was sprawled on the ground.
Quietly, Harry made his way through the front door. He passed the drawing room and smiled fondly as he met Andromeda’s eyes. She sat in a chair overlooking the front window, an easel propped in front of her as she painted. Andromeda’s eyes glimmered as she nodded towards the sitting room, where the music was coming from. Harry nodded, understanding that Teddy was surely in the adjacent room.
” Teddy shook his head with a snicker, arms wrapped securely around George’s neck as he squirmed around to look back at Harry, “Harry, tell him!”
Teddy’s voice echoed from the hallway, high and frantic.
Hesitantly, Harry raised his eyes to Malfoy, curious if the other man thought this was as strange as Harry did.
“I know!” he cried.
around you!” Ginny laughed, “What, do you think Nev hasn’t told me what that means?”
Harry turned to look back at Teddy sitting quietly on the ground, gazing up at Harry with bright silver eyes. Gary sat primly next to him, watching Harry intently.
Ginny blushed, freckles disappearing as her cheeks reddened, and she looked away. “Well, we met at the Gala for St. Mungo’s. The healers have been so helpful to the  Harpies—you know, whenever we were injured during a match and needed rehabilitation—and we attended to offer our support. All of the Quidditch teams were invited.”
Harry stormed down the hallway. He could hear Andromeda’s voice call his name behind him but was too focused on confronting Malfoy to stop. The doors to the library were closed, but a sudden peal of laughter echoed out. Harry hesitated for a moment—that was Teddy laughing, he knew, so perhaps nothing bad was happening—before shrugging it off, pushing open the doors and stepping inside.
—that would mean that...
The room was silent for a moment as Andromeda charmed the pot to pour two cups of tea. “Milk and sugar?” she asked softly, not waiting for a response before a two cubes of sugar floated from the bowl, dropping into the cups of tea, followed by a splash of milk.
Fuck.
Slowly, his fingers dropped lower, brushing over his hardening cock. He dipped one finger beneath his foreskin before tugging it towards the base of his cock, indulging in a leisurely wank. His breath shuddered and Harry groaned, letting his mind drift as he reveled in the pleasure building at the base of his spine.
Your head rolls against the shoulder. Muffled voices echo in the distance; the bass thrums beneath your skin.
Harry doubted it was truly a tradition, but whenever Kreacher began to go on about a
“It’s done,” you growl, reaching for his neck and pulling him close, biting at his lips.
“Come on, now, Draco,” a cold voice whispers in your ear. Fingers press firmly against your throat, pushing you back until your head rests against a shoulder.
“Draco—” Harry stuttered “—wait.”
“Is it done?” He asks, sharp brows quirked and he licks his lips, eyes roaming over your body as you make your way towards him.
Harry swore under his breath, swinging his legs over his broom and shooting into the air, making his way towards where the children were beginning to fly basic drills around the pitch.
So Malfoy wasn’t
“I have to try.”
“I’m saving you.”
A soft gasp escaped Teddy’s lips as he approached the Kneazles, his brown eyes wide and flickering between all of the creatures in front of him.
“Teddy! Are you alright? What’s wrong? Where are you hurt?” he asked frantically, hands hovering shakily over Teddy’s body as it curled into itself.
No, of course not. That was impossible.
“Wh—no! There’s nothing weird about that,” Harry shook his head jerkily as he looked between his friends. “You know that he’s been working on his morphing with Draco. He still has trouble controlling it, is all.”

Harry wanted to say something suave, something that would make Draco fall apart, trembling with desire. He wanted to say something that would make him seem
“Draco is my cousin, of course,” Luna smiled lazily at Harry, head tilting slowly as she watched him. “We often spend time together. Why wouldn’t I know what is important to him?”
“I’m sorry, Teddy. But you know that Andy doesn’t want any Kneazles at home.”
Desperate.
“Er...okay,” Harry mumbled. Draco spun around and stormed down the hallway. He was only gone for a few moments before the welcomewitch scurried down the hallway. She barely spared a glance at him before entering Teddy’s room.
Teddy heaved a dramatic sigh, flinging his arms over his head, and Harry could not stop himself from snickering. Teddy had certainly developed a flair for the dramatic, and Harry suspected he learned it from his cousin.

Harry snorted, astonished that his godson had been
Malfoy startled at the noise, speedily disentangling himself and shoving off of Harry, leaving him laying on the ground, dazed and confused.
The glass is lifted to your lips once more, fingers wrapping around your throat.
Before long, they had a stack of bacon and cheese toasties, ready to be devoured. There was a pot in the corner of the hob, a lid sealed tight around it, steam slowly curling around its lip.
Harry licked his lips nervously, blinking as he swallowed, trying to think of something to say, when suddenly a delicate cough sounded from across the room.
“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you, but I thought it was rather obvious! I mean, we weren’t exactly hiding anything at the camp this weekend,” Ginny exclaimed, leaning back in her chair and throwing her hands to her sides.
arrived nearly two hours before he regularly did, well within Malfoy’s appointed time with Teddy.
Teddy was trying to strengthen his familial bonds...he wanted to instinctively make him happy? But what did that have anything to do with him morphing into a miniature version of Draco—or a miniature version of
And yet, just as he began to doubt—
If anything, though, Ginny’s grin sharpened even more in her obvious delight. “Wonderful. Alright, then, Harry. I’ll bet that you don’t last one week working at Hannah’s.”
Draco hummed softly, tilting his head to one side as he observed Harry for a moment more before turning back to Teddy.
You smirk, “Yeah.”
Harry stood still, watching as the flames dwindled, until there was nothing more than embers glowing in the dark.
In the soft evening light, Draco’s porcelain skin glowed, lit from within. His cheeks were flushed, the smattering of freckles across his nose standing out. Long, graceful fingers caressed the top of Teddy’s head, voice fading as quiet snores became evident, indicating that Teddy had at last fallen asleep.
In the quiet of the garden, birds singing above them, Harry took a moment to savor this. He focused first on Teddy’s hand, small and hidden, clasped gently within his own. Then, to Draco’s porcelain skin; a stark contrast against Harry’s own rich tone. Harry breathed in, rubbing his thumb over Draco’s hand, watching reverently as the delicate skin pulled beneath his own.
Harry’s gaze flickered to his side to observe the man, raising an eyebrow suspiciously. They had come in to
Andromeda had been right.
“Yes,” Harry snapped, “Or...maybe. I don’t know! He’s probably teaching Teddy to morph so he can manipulate people and get what he wants, instead of working for it. That would be just like him!”
Harry pushed himself from his chair, striding over to the sink and thrusting his hands back into the water to resume washing the dishes. He could not afford to think that he had a chance. Even if Draco was not with Jesse—even if he were unattached to

Malfoy furrowed his brows, tilting his head to stare at Harry as if he thought he were an idiot. Which...yes, Malfoy often seemed to think Harry was an idiot, if their shared history said anything. But Harry didn’t understand why he looked like that
“You…you
“Wait, what?” Harry spun around to look closer at his room. All of his clothes, normally strewn haphazardly throughout the space, were gone. “Kreacher, I said I would be right out. Not to wash my clothes! I have to go to Andy’s, what am I going to wear?”
Harry cleared his throat awkwardly, reaching to his side and grabbing Ron’s arm to start pulling him away. While he would not mind watching a lovers quarrel—and its disastrous end—he was not keen on sticking around to see the potentially
to want an heir? You’re a fucking pureblood!”
Draco’s nostrils flared and he inhaled shakily. Harry watched as Draco’s sharp Adam’s apple bobbed when he swallowed. After a moment, he inclined his head in a subtle nod.
The grin that split Teddy’s face was so exuberant and radiant, so full of joy, it
Their lips crashed together, sharp and biting, and it
Harry paused, letting the door slam shut, separating him from Draco and Teddy momentarily. He took a deep breath and clenched his fists, letting the pain of his nails digging into his palms pull him back into reality, away from the fantasy of having
Your hands tremble, grasping at worn cloth, firm muscle hidden beneath.
Resolved to his fate, Harry reached for the parcel and walked back to his bed. Hesitantly, he opened the package, revealing the dreaded contents.
Harry chuckled, flying low so that he hovered beside Teddy. “Of course. Whenever you’re ready.”
Harry nodded frantically, pressing his arse against Draco’s hips. “I’d be better if you’d just get
“Alright,” Teddy nodded, lifting himself to wrap his arms around Malfoy and burrowing his head against the man’s neck. “I’ll miss you.”
“So then...why are you telling me?” Harry asked, glancing to his side to see if Luna and Ron were as confused as he was. They seemed to be following along perfectly.

. It’s just...” Ginny hesitated, wrinkling her nose as she decided whether or not to proceed. After a moment, she whispered, “He doesn’t want to see Draco hurt.”
me,” you gasp, helpless as Potter clutches at your groin.
Harry could feel his lips split in a wide grin as Draco flushed and looked away. He chuckled softly and turned back to Teddy.
A soft sigh escaped from Draco’s lips, his eyes rolling in exasperation despite the telltale dimple. Fingers tangled in Harry’s curls, pulling him forward, lips meeting in a languid kiss, before Draco broke away and brushed a wild curl away from Harry’s forehead.

“Er...are you okay?” Harry asked hesitantly as Draco approached.
Draco chuckled, raising an amused eyebrow as he looked over at Harry. “Yes, Harry. Can we go now?”
“And getting along means that you are now calling him
…this isn’t
“Toasties!” Teddy shouted eagerly and turned back towards the hob, disregarding the absurdity of Harry’s outfit. “Since Draco couldn’t help the other week.”
“Er...what?” he asked, feeling his cheeks flush under the intense gaze focused on him.
about this, then it is about damn time we—”
Teddy stood atop a wooden stool so that he could see the contents sizzling on the hob, a wooden spatula clutched in his hand, while Malfoy stood next to him, one pale hand gently resting against Teddy’s back, stabilizing him as the boy swayed with his exuberant gestures.
“What the—” Draco scrambled above Harry, knees straddling Harry’s hips and hands framing his head as he looked around, eyes wide. Harry bit his lip to keep from laughing as Draco observed the room, realization slowly dawning across his face. His gaze slid over Harry’s form, trapped beneath him, eyes heating as he drawled, “Harry...did you just Apparate us to your bedroom—? No, to your
“Alright, Tedward,” Malfoy murmured. He rested his hands gently on Teddy’s arms, eyes focused on the enthusiastic boy. “Are you ready?”
Malfoy stared off to the side for a moment before his lips trembled, pulling into a shaky smile as a huff of laughter escaped his lips. “Well then, Potter. I suppose that is all we have to discuss, isn’t it? If you’d excuse me, I shall be returning to my dilapidated manor promptly to reflect upon all of the ruins I have left behind me.”
Teddy squealed excitedly and clapped his hands. He spun around and wrapped his arms around one of Draco’s legs in a tight hug. “You did it, Draco!”
“Excuse me?” Malfoy questioned, his voice cold as he turned to stare at Harry. “Precisely what do you mean, Potter?”
He was beginning to think that he would not be content with any career. Everything felt like a chore, or a favor that he was fulfilling for his friends, or something that he was expected to do as
, you beg.
“Nana—“ Teddy hesitated, shifting nervously between the two adults.
him! He was telling Teddy they would work on morphing into...
Harry watched as his godson scampered off to pick out the best Kneazle beds, food, and toys for his new companion. He still did not understand how he had so quickly gone from Fortescue’s Ice Cream to purchasing a Kneazle, or how Teddy had suddenly gotten
“I suspect that Teddy has the same pack bond that werewolves have—recognizing those who he is close to as family and pack,” Hermione began excitedly, “His strongest bonds would likely be to Andy, Harry and Malfoy. Then he may have lesser bonds to others he is close to—”
“No...” Harry said slowly, frowning as he stared at the other man. “I don’t know why you know. Why else would I ask?”
It was no use.
A rosy blush quickly spread across Malfoy’s cheeks and the tips of his ears as he looked back down to his own lunch. Harry smirked with his victory, pleased that he had annoyed Malfoy so much that the other man could not look at him any longer.
“I don’t know what you want with them yet. I don’t know what you’re trying to do. But mark my words, I’m going to find out,” Harry hissed, leaning forward once more.
Harry hesitated, remembering when he had last seen George at the pub earlier that week, before he had stormed out. He hadn’t spoken to him since then, and even though he didn’t think George would hold a grudge against his temper, Harry didn’t relish the idea of encountering his friend just yet.
swept onto the pitch. It shimmered, light twisting until it assumed a corporeal form—a crow. It circled Draco’s head before settling on the ground in front of him.
Teddy looked up at Harry with wide amber eyes, pale blonde hair the very image of his cousin’s.
“Oh darling, you know that you need not to worry about tardiness when it comes to your obligations,” Andromeda soothed, smiling softly at her nephew.

You lose yourselves.

“Like what?” Ginny asked.
That wasn’t happening.
“Er...Just for the record, I’m pretty sure he learned his dramatics from you,” Harry mumbled in an attempt to break the stilted silence.
Trust a Slytherin and a prankster to teach his godson how to bend the rules.
“Draco, nothing is—“
Will he really be back?
“How are you feeling, Tedward?” Draco asked quietly, staring at the boy with concern written plainly across his face.
as Draco stepped from the fire.
“What happened!?” Ginny snapped, her voice high and shaky.
Draco blinked, stiffening. “Uh—”
Just to make sure that he was okay, of course.
Draco grinned smugly. “Yes, well. We’ve come to an accord, of sorts.”
For how explosive their initial collision was, it rapidly calmed. Desperation morphed into tenderness, lips slowing as they dragged against one another. Harry drew his hand up Draco’s firm back until his fingers tangled in silky hair. He tugged gently, a deep moan vibrating from the man’s throat before Draco pressed forward, pushing Harry backwards until he felt the solid wall of the sitting room against his back. Harry rested his hands against Draco’s hips, grasping at the sharp bones protruding above the seam of his trousers. His fingers dipped beneath the fabric, searching for the warmth of Draco’s skin.
Almost immediately, Teddy’s eyes shifted back to their deep brown as he focused on George. He held the Pygmy Puff gently to his chest, stroking the top of its round body.
“Er...yes,” Harry nodded shakily. He shot a glance towards Malfoy, whose eyes were lowered, cheeks flushed as he refused to meet anyone’s gaze.

Teddy stood stiffly at the threshold of the room, amber eyes bright as he stared at them. Slowly, he turned to focus on Draco.
" he groans, back arching wantonly, pressing against you.
“You’re manipulating them,” Harry blurted, snapping his eyes back up to Malfoy’s. If Malfoy seemed stiff before, he was a statue now, face frozen as he stared back at Harry, shoulders tight and back straight against the shelf he was leaning against.
“Teddy, I—”
On the front page of the Society section was an image of Malfoy, dressed primly in well-fitted robes. His eyes sparkled, a smile pulling at his lips as he gracefully lifted a flute of champagne and took a slow sip, eyes roaming lazily around what must have been a ballroom, the location of some gala or fancy soirée.
With an exasperated sigh, Malfoy rolled his eyes towards the ceiling before locking his eyes with Harry’s and slowly, but clearly, mouthing the word
“Er...what?”
Your mind begins to clear…
Hermione had suggested that he make a list of all of the careers he would be interested in. He had already crossed out Auror, DADA professor, snake breeder, glass blower, herbologist, and barista. Next on the list was
“Oh yes,
Harry lunged forward, cutting Draco off as he slotted their mouths together. He ran his hands across Draco’s firm back, clenching at the shirt stretched tightly across broad shoulders.
“Well...I know you normally spend time with Teddy until after lunch. Isn’t this cutting into that time?” Harry faltered, wondering why he even

And yet…
Teddy parted his lips, preparing to speak, but before he could Gary let out an alarmed hiss. The Kneazle scrambled away, claws drawn, in an attempt to escape from the shocking morph. In his determination to withdraw from Teddy’s reptilian appearance, Gary’s claws swiped at Teddy’s face, four deep gouges tearing at his face.

Harry smiled serenely, relaxing against the door frame, and charming two of the mugs to set themselves on the bedside table.
“Alright, Teddy. Why is the waltz so important for wizards to know?” he asked, smiling as he indulged his godson.
so long as he had this.
, do you hear yourself mate?” Ron huffed, rolling his eyes so dramatically that his head followed the movement.
“I should have known you would keep this in your bedside table, Potter.” Draco placed a quick kiss to Harry’s shoulders before wet fingers rubbed at his rim. The tip of one finger dipped into him and Harry gasped, pushing back against the pressure. He bit at the pillow, trying desperately to quiet his groans, fingers clutching at his bedsheets, as Draco added another finger, and then a third.
Teddy’s screams stuttered as he tried to catch his breath. Silver eyes blinked, blurry with tears as they gazed up at Harry. “Hurts—” Teddy sobbed, “—D-Draco!”
In the act of
Draco slowly turned his head to Harry, raising an eyebrow before drawling, “I am certain I have no idea what you are referring to.”
Andromeda’s lips twitched, as if she were holding back a laugh. Humming, she stood gracefully and made her way towards Harry. As she reached him, Andromeda gently grasped his hands between her own and pressed a soft kiss to one cheek and then the other.
impossible...
Harry frowned, throwing a brief glance towards Malfoy to see if he was paying attention. He didn’t need Malfoy knowing about his personal business, after all. “Yes, just helping Neville get everything set up before he opens. I told Teddy he could come with me soon to see it, and—“
“Wonderful,” Andromeda interjected before Harry could respond, “Now, why don’t we all adjourn in the sitting room for tea before preparing luncheon?”
Teddy whined, “But Draco—“
Teddy eagerly waved back, although Harry hesitated before lifting his own hand, his eyes lingering on Jesse before turning away.
Harry blinked, uncomprehending. Malfoy worked at St. Mungo’s...as a Healer? It certainly explained how readily he was able to soothe Teddy and why he had dittany so close at hand. But...it was
. And most of the students didn’t even dance for it!”
Draco hesitated before lifting his own pale fingers and gently wrapping them around Harry’s.
Harry relaxed in relief at Andromeda’s words. If Teddy was with his cousin, he would be fine—it was family, after all, not bloody Mal—
“Er...” Harry cleared his throat, smiling sheepishly. “Good morning, Teddy. Did you sleep well?”
“No!” Teddy cried. His hands trembled at his sides, fists clenching sporadically, “Take it back!”
He had thanked Rosmerta for the opportunity at the end of his shift the previous evening, but was confident in his decision that working at the Hogsmeade pub was
Well...
he could
“Surely, Master Harry has clean clothes in his wardrobe,” Kreacher grumbled, slowly making his way to the door, “Master Harry’s blood traitor friend brought him clothes while he was washing. Kreacher did not touch it.”
Painstakingly, Harry made his way inside, following the light coming from the kitchen. Teddy’s excited voice was accompanied by Andromeda’s and Malfoy’s softer tones as their conversation filled the room. He paused just outside, taking one last deep breath before crossing the threshold.
Harry felt like he must be in an alternate universe. There was no other logical explanation for why Malfoy was comforting Teddy, tending to his wounds, speaking softly with reassuring caresses.
Malfoy’s face softened and flushed slightly. The color suited him, Harry couldn’t help but think, adding some life to his porcelain skin, before he quickly shook his head and took a step towards Malfoy.
He had just dropped Teddy back off at Andromeda’s an hour earlier, before Hermione and Ron Floo-ed into his sitting room. They hadn’t seen much of each other recently, and all of them would be busy the following week with Wizengamot cases, Auror patrols, and the start of another new job, so they had agreed to spend Sunday evening together at Grimmauld.
“I was not!” Harry spat. “I was just watching him. He was always up to something at Hogwarts! And it’s a good thing I did, too, because I was
was all about, someone stepped beside him.
“Harry!” Hermione exclaimed, pushing herself from where she had leaned against the side of the Burrow. “Teddy has the genes of a were, whether or not he himself is a werewolf.”
Draco’s eyes met his, silver irises glowing in the dim light of the fire, a heat blazing so brightly that his gaze warmed Harry more than the hearth ever could.
“Yes, of course,” Harry nodded, grinning at Teddy’s enthusiasm. He could not deny that the display had been beautiful. And yet, despite the evident beauty and grace of the waltz that Teddy and Malfoy had just danced, Harry could not help but question, “But...why learn how to
Harry drew a deep breath of air into his lungs, wincing as he slowly stretched on the floor, testing his movements making sure that he hadn’t broken anything when they fell. Feeling nothing more than what would surely be a rather brilliant bruise come morning, he sat up, grimacing at the ache of movement.
Malfoy’s face was relaxed, looking content and happy as he watched Teddy, silver eyes sparkling with adoration. He chuckled, twirling them around the room to the graceful rhythm of the music.
Harry grimaced. He could not deny that he hadn’t been the best dancer in fourth year—nor was he now, nearly a decade later—but he couldn’t admit that to Malfoy.
Draco huffed a gentle laugh, running his fingers through Teddy’s curly blond hair. “Of course I will.” Silver eyes glanced towards Harry, a question hidden beneath the wary gaze.
Teddy! A Kneazle is a huge responsibility, not a present to get on his good side!”
Harry was not sure why he was suddenly so concerned about Malfoy leaving, when surely it would only benefit Harry and provide him with more time alone with his godson. And yet, he also recognized that he
it has cooked.”
“Well, would you look at that?” The elderly man nodded with approval. “It looks like this little one has claimed you.”
Teddy sniffed loudly, his heels hitting the cupboard as he swung his legs repeatedly, looking between Malfoy and Harry.
That was...technically correct.
They walked towards the sitting room in comfortable silence. Harry strode to the hearth, reaching for the Floo powder and presenting it to Draco.
“Yes.” Andromeda nodded curtly, crossing her arms under her chest as her sharp eyes bore into Harry. “Draco had no obligations aside from Teddy this morning, and yet shortly after you arrive, he hurries off. Why?”
To Andromeda.
“Yeah!” Teddy’s voice exclaimed loudly. Harry could envision Teddy, shuffling around as he tried to contain his excitement in his small body. “Okay, let me try another.”
Harry stared in dismay at the contents—or lack thereof—of his wardrobe. All of his clothes were gone, save for a wrapped parcel. There was a piece of parchment folded delicately on top. Picking it up, Harry frowned as he read its contents.
Ron and Ginny both snorted. Hermione blinked a couple of times and hummed.
“Wait,” Harry froze in place. Teddy didn’t have many cousins. In fact, Harry could only think of one. “Which cousin?”
“Potter,” Malfoy nodded curtly, sparing a quick glance of acknowledgment towards him before turning back to the crumble on the counter.
Ron choked on his Firewhisky, coughing hoarsely as he cleared his throat. He looked over at Harry, waving a hand in front of him as his eyes teared, “Sorry, sorry. Went down the wrong way, mate. Go on.”
Draco cleared his throat softly, and Harry looked up at the polite noise. Draco was gazing blankly to the side of Harry, at the exit to the sitting room, refusing to meet his eyes. His jaw twitched, as if he were clenching his teeth together.
“Of course. How could I forget?” Malfoy nodded, gently squeezing Teddy’s hand, before he looked back at Harry, raising one eyebrow and offering a smirk. “Thank you for your generous apology, Potter. In accordance to form, I accept.”
“Draco! I’m ready!”
, alright!?” Harry suddenly yelled, throwing his hands in the air and flinging bubbles from the soapy water into the air. “I bloody well
“No, certainly not,” Andromeda agreed, setting a hand gently on Teddy’s shoulder, “I am sure Draco momentarily forgot himself. Although, wizards often do when confronted when they least expect it.” Andromeda’s steady gaze settled onto Harry, one eyebrow raised in accusation.
Why would Draco want to be with someone who lived in an old, shambly home? Someone who had an unfriendly house elf and a stubborn Kneazle. Draco was a bloody
There was nothing to be embarrassed about.
Andromeda heaved a deep breath, letting it out on a soft sigh. “Harry...you do know how dear you are to me, don’t you?”
“Alright,” Harry repeated, turning to face Malfoy directly, “If Teddy says you can show me why the waltz is so important...then why not?”
Molly’s voice called out from inside, letting them know brunch was ready. Ginny and Ron pushed at each other as they hurried inside, Harry hesitating where he stood.
“Okay...?” Harry frowned.
He groans, long fingers grasping at your hips, silver eyes heavy with
Hermione took a deep breath before steepling her fingers, much like he imagined she did before calmly eviscerating a witness on cross-examination at the Wizengamot. Harry suddenly felt like he was on trial.

“He’s fine.”
Teddy pouted unsuccessfully at Malfoy before turning his gaze. Heaving in a deep breath, Teddy jumped from the stool to stand directly in front of Harry. “Harry,
The worn fabric beneath your body—a chaise lounge that must have at one point been at the height of fashion—scratches at your skin.
She smiled kindly, reaching forward and grasping both of his hands between her own. “Perhaps. You, Andromeda...and Draco. I think that you are his pack.” Hermione stood on her tip-toes, pressing a soft kiss upon his cheek. “He wants you to be happy, Harry. That’s all. So instinctively, he is trying to make that happen.”
Harry whimpered as Draco pulled away, but quickly forgot about it when Draco pressed the head of his cock firmly against Harry’s entrance. The resistance lasted for a mere moment before Harry relaxed, allowing Draco to sink into him.
Harry swallowed thickly, running his fingers nervously through his messy curls. “So, did you...er, that is...did you want to stay over?”
what he was meant to be doing with his life. The fact that he had lasted for even less time at Rosmerta’s than at Hannah’s was something that he was determined not to reveal to anyone.
The window creaked as Kreacher pushed it open, offering a burnt piece of bacon to the owl.
“Shut it, Gin!”
There had been multiple occasions when, upon Harry’s arrival, Andromeda had informed him that Teddy was busy cleaning his room or finishing a project, but
Harry cleared his throat, coughing lightly, “Er...yes?”
Draco pulled away, and Harry whined at the loss. A hand stroked up the center of his back, fingers squeezing at the base of his neck soothingly.
. Harry shifted, pulling his knees towards his chest and lifting his arse in the air. Draco did not falter—following his every movement as he ate Harry out, fingers digging into his hips.
“Not that it should be any concern of yours,” Malfoy huffed, turning back to the sink and the task in front of him, “but I was spending the morning with my aunt and cousin, as I do every Saturday.”
Gracefully, Malfoy stood, his lean body towering over Teddy, hand still resting gently atop his head.
Harry nodded to himself, convinced that he was doing the right thing by continuing to observe Malfoy. It was all for Teddy’s safety, and he could not be too cautious.
The gasoline bursts into flames, a fiery hell exploding forward until it envelopes the golden statue, all consuming.
He wants all of it.
Teddy giggled, squirming in Harry’s arms in a weak effort to escape his grasp. He wriggled down, eventually making his way out of Harry’s arms and skipping back towards Malfoy and the stool he had abandoned.

“Malfoy would be better at that—he cooks with you, doesn’t he? Why don’t you ask him?” Harry questioned, proud of himself for smoothly bringing up Malfoy’s involvement. He turned to look at Andromeda once more, only to see her gazing at him intently. Harry immediately focused on his mental shields. He still wasn’t sure whether or not Andromeda had any particular skill in legilimency, but looking at her now he did
“Yes!” Teddy clutched his fists together, jumping up and down in his excitement.
“You will?” Harry asked curiously, though he immediately regretted it when Draco sent a chilly glare his way.
“Yes,” Ginny said quickly, cocking her head inquisitively.

Cool fingers wrap around your wrist, pulling your hand to a firm chest. You focus on how it expands—inhales and exhales—breathing.
“Wait!” Harry squeezed his eyes shut, holding a hand up in an effort to prevent Ginny from continuing. “No, we aren’t talking about me. We’re talking about you and Jesse. If he...Ginny, if he is seeing
“You sure did,” George agreed, chuckling as he lowered Teddy back to the ground.
“Harry,” she began, frowning at Ron before turning to focus on Harry, “I don’t mean to sound...disbelieving. But why, exactly, do you think that Malfoy is up to something? He hasn’t done anything suspicious since the war. In fact, he’s been rather...decent, as far as I am aware.”
“I’m ready!” Teddy yelled, sliding into the kitchen, arms windmilling about in an effort to keep himself upright. “Can we go see Gary, now?”
“Harry!” Teddy squealed, scrambling up and running towards Harry. Without hesitation, Harry knelt down, enveloping Teddy in his arms as he ran into him, laughing as they fell to the ground with the force of Teddy’s embrace.

Perhaps his friends had a point—not the correct one, of course, but there was no doubt that Teddy’s features were
Teddy waved excitedly at Harry, cherubic cheeks flushed in his delight, before darting towards Draco, saying something that made the man throw his head back and laugh.
“Oh?” Andromeda questioned, raising a sculpted eyebrow as her gaze sharpened on him.
“Well...” Teddy stuttered. “I didn’t want to be

“What do you want?” Draco whispered into Harry’s ear, suckling at the lobe. “Harry...tell me what you want...”

. Teddy sobbed quietly, a loud hiccup breaking his cries.
“Harry?”
You can’t.
Harry froze.
“I-I won’t,” he stuttered.
“Oh, Tedward,” Draco pursed his lips, the corners tugging in an attempt at a smile. He lifted one hand to brush Teddy’s chestnut brown curls from his forehead. “It’s alright. I’ll have you healed up before you know it. Don’t you worry.”
Ginny choked, coughing loudly as she stared at Harry with wide eyes, “
Malfoy was helping Teddy learn how to control his metamorphmagi abilities. Why else would he do that other than to mold Teddy into a mini-Malfoy, to instill his own pureblood biases into Harry’s innocent godson?
“If I win, you’ll wear those jogging bottoms that Dean so thoughtfully gifted me last Christmas. You’ll wear them to Andromeda’s.”
“That doesn’t matter! They’d be
You know there will be a mark.
“Alright, Kreacher, I’ll be back later with Teddy!” Harry called out. He could hear the elf grumbling in the distance, and laughed under his breath before heading into the sitting room and Floo-ing directly to Andromeda’s cottage.
“Alright, Tedward. Are you ready?” Draco asked slowly, his voice soft. It was deep, smooth as honey, a comforting blanket wrapped around them all.
“Of course, dear.” Andromeda smiled at Harry, eyes twinkling. “Have a wonderful weekend.”
Andromeda hummed, smiling knowingly, “Isn’t he just?”
Harry shifted below him, turning to lay on his stomach, arms folded beneath a pillow and legs spread. He rolled his hips, gasping at the friction of his cock rubbing against smooth sheets.
Teddy squirmed where he sat, giggling. “Do you want to see?”
“Of course I did,” Draco said sharply, “It was merely a bruise, Potter.”
Draco hummed against his throat, tilting his hips forward so that Harry could feel the thick girth of him against his hips. Harry shuddered, his body arching into Draco’s as his hands roamed lower, caressing Draco’s sides. He gripped sharp hip bones, and without a second thought, twisted them into the disorienting spin of Apparition.
something.
The shop was surprisingly quiet for a Sunday morning, with only a few customers perusing the products and laughing delightedly at what they found.  Teddy let out an excited yell and ran forward, his hair morphing to a bright Weasley-red, when he saw George standing by a display of Wildfire Whiz-Bangs.
He’s the only one who has ever loved you.
Draco was waiting in front of the hearth, eyes roaming over the room, still wearing his lime green Healer's robes.
“Great!” Teddy exclaimed, smiling brightly. He reached out to grasp Harry’s hand and began to tug him towards the kitchen.
A cool breeze caresses your skin. The violent flames flicker, dying down until they are nothing but embers, their heat radiating a warmth that wraps around you like a blanket.
“No, Andy!” Harry spared a quick glance at Andromeda’s furious face before glaring back at Malfoy, who remained still. His pale face was frozen, unmoved by Harry’s accusations, only his stormy grey eyes showing any hint of emotion as they roared with life.
Harry furrowed his brows, “Okay...so, basically, Teddy has some magical bond with Andy, Draco and me...?”
“Was he, now?” Andromeda’s eyes glinted with what Harry thought must have been amusement as she looked between the two men.
“‘Morning,” Harry whispered, placing a line of kisses along Draco’s spine.

“Gary!” Teddy cried excitedly as the Kneazle disappeared through the doorway.
“Er...good morning, Andy,” Harry mumbled, nodding curtly.

Hermione shook her head softly, mumbling something about
“Er...well, like I said. Ginny won a bet and...you know,” Harry shrugged awkwardly, gesturing to his apparel.
Harry froze, staring blankly at Malfoy. He had been certain that he was being discreet. He hadn’t followed Malfoy around like he had in sixth year; he had only asked a few questions, arrived a little early on Saturdays.
Harry snorted, clenching his fists, “Nothing I should
Harry instinctively pulled his broom to a halt. He snapped his head around just in time to watch as Teddy took a sharp turn around the bed of lilies, his training broom tilting precariously to the side.
“Does he even know?”
Malfoy stood before him, calmly gazing at Harry, looking as if he had no care in the world, baring the spark in his mercurial eyes, his clenched fists shaking at his side.
Harry smiled softly, holding Teddy’s hand gently in his own as he bent down to pick up the forgotten training broom. He looked around for his own broom before remembering it had snapped in the collision with Draco earlier, and the debris had already been vanished by the volunteers.
What is going on?
Ginny sighed heavily beside him, “Alright, fine. Shall I tell you about my week, then?” Without waiting for Harry to respond, Ginny continued. “Well! The Quidditch Camp was such a success that we have decided to make it a regular event.”
!” Harry spat. “Whatever you’re up to Malfoy, it ends now. You’ve clearly bewitched Andy and Teddy. You’re manipulating them, slithering into their lives and forcing their trust only to abandon them, and
Tripping as he stepped across the threshold, Harry took a deep breath, eyes focused on the fry-up that Kreacher was preparing for him. He groaned loudly as he sat at the table, staring hungrily at the cure to his still queasy stomach.
Malfoy furrowed his brows. His intense silver gaze roamed Harry’s body, and Harry felt goose-pimples erupt across his skin under the onslaught. His cheeks began to heat, and Harry’s eyes flickered to look at Teddy, who was happily adding more crumble than necessary over the blackcurrant tin.
Malfoy huffed loudly, rolling his eyes once more as he turned to fix the blackcurrant crumble that Teddy had dug into, though Harry swore he saw the other man’s lips twitch in what might have been a smile.
“Sure. Yes, right...” Turning around, Harry reached for the refrigerator, bending to grab the produce and meats they needed. He could feel the cloth of the bottoms pulling taught around his arse. A choked gasp sounded behind him, followed closely by a squeak.
Harry’s breath caught in his throat, lips parting as his eyes flickered across Andromeda’s face. Her smile was soft, loving, as she watched him. But her eyes were firm, a threat hidden within their depths.
His eyes are bright, vibrant. Glowing in the light of the club.
He was met with nothing but silence.
Biting his lip, Harry tilted his head back until it rested against the shower wall. He closed his eyes, imagining what it would be like to have a partner standing next to him under the heat of the shower...
Harry offered a soft smile towards his godson. Just as he was about to say that they should start lunch—they didn’t need Malfoy, after all—Andromeda placed both her hands securely on Teddy’s shoulders and ushered him towards the sitting room.
Working as a cook for Rosmerta had not gone as well as he had hoped it would. His back ached from standing over the stove all week, cooking orders that had to adhere

. Harry rarely remembered to shave in the mornings and couldn’t hold down a job.
“You’re going to that, then?” Ron asked.
“Potter—” Harry stiffened, hating the sound of his surname on Draco’s lips after only a few weeks of going without it. After a moment, Draco whispered, “Why, exactly, do you think that Jesse doesn’t like you?”
Draco was dressed pristinely in flying gear. Tight cream trousers, molded exquisitely to Draco’s form, led down to knee-high leather boots. A loose white shirt, nearly translucent and billowing from his body, was tucked neatly into his trousers, held in place by a thin leather belt. The shirt was open at the front, revealing the tantalizing line of his collarbones, the dip of his throat.
Damn Ronald and his bloody competence as an Auror.
“Weird?” Harry spluttered. “What on earth are you talking about?”
“Oh, did you?” she questioned, the corners of her lips curling in an amused smile.
ingredients for their meal, Harry took a moment to gather his bearings. She moved around the kitchen as if she had not just scolded Harry with the ferocity of a dragon, humming softly to herself.
“Er...mate. Does any of that sound
“Well?” Malfoy folded his arms across his chest, narrowing his eyes as he glared down at Harry. “Precisely what is wrong with a waltz, Potter?”
Malfoy’s gaze snapped to Harry, silver eyes wide with astonishment, “What?”
“I did! So Draco showed him how. After we finished my lessons, of course!” Teddy reached for Andromeda’s hand, clutching it in his own as he turned to look back at Harry and Malfoy, amber eyes sparkling with mischief.
up to anything. But if something happens, all of you are going to feel like shite for not believing me.”
“What a wonderful meal. The crumble, especially, was delectable. Marvelous job, darlings,” She nodded slowly, once to Malfoy and then to Teddy, each of whom smiled back with their thanks. “I must be off now. Narcissa has a full weekend schedule planned, and I mustn’t be late.”
Malfoy’s gaze shifted to meet Harry’s own, and Harry stiffened. He had only just said he
“Well, what do you know? They are!” Ginny gasped dramatically as Teddy ran towards her.
“Mhm,” Ginny sucked on her lower lip and nodded slowly, “But if we do this, we’re going to need some staff to help, is the thing. Not just volunteers.”
A deep chuckle echoed throughout the room as the shopkeeper grinned widely, “Oh, don’t you worry, son.”
“Mmm...I would not be so sure about that.”
Andromeda huffed, rolling her eyes toward the ceiling before turning back to her meal.
You freeze, fingers twitching against the fabric that they are held against.
“Yes?” Draco asked, tilting his head to the side and lifting one eyebrow as he gazed across the room at Harry.
with Ginny.
Harry groaned, arching against Draco at one particularly long thrust, cocks dragging against each other. He couldn’t think beyond the pleasure coursing through his body, beyond the heat of Draco caging him in. He whined, “
Harry frowned as he watched Andromeda leave, pondering her departing smile. She acted as if she knew something.
Teddy took a shuddering breath, lips wobbling with his sobs. He opened his eyes and focused quickly on Malfoy. Letting out a pitiful gasp, Teddy stumbled towards his cousin
Harry smiled fondly down at his godson, “We are.”
In the pleasure…
“Do you think that Gary missed me, Harry?” he asked, jumping from his seat to begin clearing the table.
But the early mornings and angry customers and scalding burns when he fumbled with the drinks was something that Harry was glad to be rid of. He had helped at Hannah’s café the past three days, and after an angry customer—Karen, if he remembered correctly—had thrown her drink at him because he had
He did not understand why, suddenly, he felt so nervous—why his heart was thrumming so loudly within his chest.
You see them, standing right in front of you…
“Thank you, darling. Have a wonderful weekend with Harry. I will see you upon my return.” She placed a soft kiss to Teddy’s forehead before he skipped over to Malfoy.
Harry and Teddy both sat up—though Teddy nearly
Draco barked a sharp laugh, limbs tangling with Harry’s as they rolled around on the bed, snickering as they each tried to pin the other down.
Malfoy ran his hand soothingly through Teddy’s turquoise hair, fingers tangling in the messy strands. “It’s okay, darling,” he whispered, “I’ve got you. Let’s go get you healed, shall we?”
“What?” He blinked, confused.
“I didn’t mean it like you thought—like it sounded,” Harry started slowly, quietly. He looked down at their intertwined hands, mesmerized by bronzed skin pressed against porcelain. “I just meant that...he doesn’t like me. Jesse, I mean.” Draco tensed and began to pull away, but Harry tightened his hold. “Which is fine! I don’t mind! It only matters because
In the passion
“I was going to ask—before you so
“Are you sure that he’s healed enough for this?” he asked, keeping his eyes on Teddy, who was introducing himself to the other children.
Heaving out a sigh, Harry focused on the window overlooking the gardens as Teddy’s turquoise head ran past, a peal of laughter echoing into the kitchen as his godson played.
Water licking at your sides as someone moves behind you, holding you against a solid chest.
“Potter...” Malfoy’s throat worked with a strained swallow, and Harry watched as his Adam’s apple dipped with the movement, a bright flush making its way up Malfoy’s neck. “Your

always right, is that it? You save the Wizarding World and anything you say, goes?”
“Oh!” Harry breathed, hands falling from his hips as his lips parted in shock. “Are you...really?”
As he entered the small room, Harry leaned against the door, closing it with a soft
Harry gaped between the two of them. He felt like he was in an alternate universe. Nothing made sense.
“Yes, ma’am,” Harry murmured, shifting back on his heels as if it could help distance him from Andromeda’s ire. She appraised him for a moment before nodding her head once and turning towards the kitchen cupboards.
from the floor above them that indicated Teddy rushing through his bedtime routine.
beneath her breath. Ron let out a slow sigh, lifting his wine to his lips to take a long sip while watching Harry.
“What?” he spluttered. “No! Of course not.”
Harry’s tongue darted out to wet his lips, which suddenly felt too dry to speak. Draco inhaled sharply at the movement, a soft rosy hue spreading across his cheeks.
“Wait,
“W-what?” Harry stuttered, his eyes widening at the sudden accusation. “What do you mean?”
Harry winced, biting at his lip as he recalled exactly what had happened. He set his cup beside him, straightening where he sat, “Er...everything was fine, of course. But Teddy might have taken a...well, a short fall.”
“Fuck...er, yes Kreacher, I’ll be right out!” Harry stumbled, swearing beneath his breath as he finished washing quickly, roughly lathering shampoo in his hair and rinsing it before hopping out of the shower. He reached for his towel and wrapped it around his waist before stepping back into his bedroom.
Why would he, after all? There is not reason for him to return. Not when he could find so much better than you.
Their eyes caught, and Harry could feel his cheeks begin to heat. He licked his lips, swallowing thickly, breathing out a quiet, “Hey.”
Draco laughed, running his fingers fondly through Teddy’s messy hair. “Then I will see you this evening.” He turned, grasping a handful of Floo powder in one hand and tossing it into the hearth. With one last glance towards Harry, Draco stepped into the flames and with a
You frown…
You fall into one another.
, Gary scratching him, and then
“Articulate as ever, Potter,” Malfoy reached for the dessert on the counter, deftly spreading the crumble evenly throughout the tin and fixing any damage that Teddy had done to it.
The room was silent in the aftermath of Teddy’s enthusiastic visit, Draco sitting stiffly with his back against the headboard, staring at the door. He blinked lazily, eyes shifting to look at Harry.
“Damnit, Potter!” Malfoy groaned as he began to untangle himself from Harry’s limbs, “You have no more skill than you did in fourth year! No wonder you think the waltz is outdated, you have two bloody left feet!”
correct in his assumptions this time.
“Well,” Hermione exhaled slowly, tilting her head as she peered at him, “did you ask him what he was doing there?”
“No!” Teddy shook his head, biting his bottom lip as he pulled away from Andromeda’s hold, reaching out until his small hand enveloped Malfoy’s. “You have to say you’re sorry, Harry. You have to say you’re sorry to Draco.”
him. He didn’t understand how Ron and Hermione weren’t comprehending the dire situation.
Harry moaned around Draco, closing his eyes and letting him lose himself in the heaviness of Draco’s cock against his tongue, the breathy sounds of Draco’s pleasure.
Harry and Teddy both turned to look at Draco, who stood stiffly between them, eyes wide. Draco looked between the two of them, before his eyes settled onto Harry’s own.
You make your way up his body, fingers tugging at your own clothes as you whisper a simple spell, preparing yourself.
Beer sloshed over the rim of his pint as Harry slammed it back onto the table. The noise of the bar was distant in the protection of the modified
Harry huffed, his nostrils flaring as he took a jolted step back. His eyes ran down the length of the man before him, taking in the lean lines of him, adorned in sleek trousers and a sharp shirt.
“What kind of a man would I be, Harry, if I did not teach my own dear cousin how to fly?” Draco smirked, one sharp canine pressing on his bottom lip in what Harry was
“Oh,” he whispered. His voice sounded hoarse—slow—as if he were dragging himself through molasses. He swallowed thickly, found himself taking a halting step towards the other man. “Well...I suppose, then, if—”
“I told you…”
“Must you eat like a Neanderthal, Potter? Surely you know how to eat with some manners,” Malfoy sneered as he gracefully took his knife and fork in hand, cutting a delicate triangle from his toasty before dipping it into his steaming soup.
Harry’s eyes widened as he took in Ginny’s smug look, Ron choking back laughter behind him.
Harry paused, thinking back to the camp— watching Jesse from across the pitch, arms resting tenderly on Ginny’s arm, and Ginny gazing up at him with sparkling eyes and flushed cheeks. He had thought they were flirting...and they
“Fuck, no!” Harry jolted forward, eyes frantic as he waved his hands dismissively in front of himself. “Draco,

Draco huffed, rolling his eyes so thoroughly that his head followed the movement. “Yes, Harry. He is

In the pulse of the lights.
“I fell,” Teddy interjected softly, bright green eyes staring up at Malfoy, beginning to fill with tears once again. “I couldn’t keep my grip, I turned too fast.”
“Nothing,” He shrugged, turning back to focus on the dirty dishes. He rinsed his mug, placing it to his side to dry, before reaching for his dinner plate.
around, speeding towards Teddy as if his godson were the snitch in a championship game—everything on the line.
“No, not really,” Harry shrugged, not taking any offense. He did like creatures, but certainly not with the passion that Luna did, or Hagrid. He’d rather his care be put towards those he loved, like Teddy.
Of course he did.
Draco laughed brightly, snorting when Harry flung a hand out and hit him in the chest.
Time seems to still, if only for a moment, before I smirk and raise my glass.

with him will kill you.
The soft evening light reflected brilliantly off of the two blond heads, a blanket of calm embracing them, and Harry thought he could stay like this forever. It felt right, the domesticity of it.
“Well,” George chuckled, tilting his head and smirking across the table, “This isn’t exactly the first time you’ve been preoccupied with Malfoy, is it?”
Ron had returned his gaze to Harry, finally ignoring the activities outside of the window. Hermione bit at her lip, head tilted slightly in contemplation as she stared across the table at Harry.
Ron and Hermione stared at him across from their table littered with Auror and Wizengamot case files. They exchanged a glance, before Ron looked determinedly out of the window and took a sip of his tea. Hermione inhaled deeply and carefully setting her cup in front of her.
Hermione waved a hand in front of her, as if dismissing her rambling and reminding herself to get back on track, “Anyway, the case itself is irrelevant.”
. And not like they did at Hogwarts, either. Almost like they’re...Merlin, like they’re friends. Like it’s a
Draco’s gaze lifted, bright eyes meeting Harry’s own.
Harry swallowed thickly, his throat suddenly dry.
“Excellent,” Harry grinned broadly, “So, what are you doing?”
The kitchen was silent, neither of them moving, before Ginny quietly asked, “About what?”
“Harry—”
“Okay,” Teddy sighed, wrapping his arms around Malfoy for a quick hug, “I love you. See you soon.”
Marking you.
“Well, then. It’s just you and me, Ted!” Harry grinned quickly, pushing aside any lingering confusion. “What do you say we go see Ginny and the Harpies practice?”
I feel your eyes on me, watching as I walk away.
“Harry, they’re all like this. You
Somewhat reluctantly, Harry whispered, “I should...Teddy—”
Teddy jumped off of Malfoy’s feet with a wide grin, turning towards Harry. “Isn’t it marvelous?”
I can’t help but sneer into my glass, breathing in the bitter scent of liquor, letting it burn. I can’t help but scoff at the sheer hilarity of what is happening.
There hadn’t been any reason
“Okay!” Teddy skipped his way out of the kitchen, clambering up the stairs to grab his overnight bag.
Instantly, Malfoy’s eyes narrowed, his pupils dilating as he stared at Harry. His lips turned up in a familiar sneer as he huffed out a hoarse laugh, “You wish, Potter.”
Andromeda delicately cleared her throat, throwing a smug glance Harry’s way, before she summoned her things and strode to the hearth.
As Harry raised his eyes, he met Hermione’s, watching him inquisitively from across the kitchen. She offered a soft smile, to which he shrugged, before Ron spun from the stove. Bright red oven mitts adorned his hands, firmly grasping the steaming pot of stew, a grin splitting his lips.
Draco strode past him, fingers brushing against his own, and Harry faltered before turning to watch as Draco turned the corner, disappearing from sight.
Draco grinned, brushing a stray curl from Teddy’s forehead. He whispered something that made Teddy giggle, his own dimple appearing on his otherwise smooth cheek. Draco lifted his eyes to meet Harry’s, and Harry’s breath caught in his throat. He forgot about any pain that he was in as he stared into molten silver irises, warm and radiant in the sunlight.
“I’ll be back soon.”
You can’t leave—you can’t survive without him.
“Hello?”
“Since me,” Harry interrupted, smiling fondly at Ginny. “I’ll be there. Don’t worry.”
They don’t know what I know.
Harry stared between the two of them. Where Teddy stood firm, sure in his proclamation, Malfoy stared down at the boy in wonder. He looked just as shocked as Harry felt.
Alone.
“Master called?” Kreacher asked hoarsely.
Harry grimaced, glancing again at the consequences of his bet with Ginny.
would do this. If you’d help to run the Quidditch Camps.”
Teddy bounced in place before hopping after the man. Harry paused, watching his godson for a moment before slowly following. He had a sudden feeling that, whatever was happening here, he would not get out of it.
“Go on, then.” Teddy encouraged, looking between the two men beside him.
Hands began to linger, hips rolling against one another, and before long Draco’s thighs tightened around Harry’s waist with such force that he flipped them, pressing Harry firmly into the sheets. Draco ran his hands up Harry’s arms, fingers grasping at his wrists and holding them against the pillows.

“I’m afraid not,” Malfoy grimaced, eyes flickering briefly on Harry before settling firmly on Andromeda again. “I have been called in Tuesday. However, I believe that I will be able to join you and Tedward on Wednesday for lunch.”
‘Mione. Do you really think Malfoy would consider a blood traitor and a hybrid ‘family’?”
Malfoy’s pale cheeks were flushed once more, and he was sucking at his lower lip, hooded eyes lowered. Harry would swear that the man was looking at his jogging bottoms, but this was
Your voice quivers, deep but insecure. You’ve never…
“It just doesn’t make any sense!”
“I just...well, we talked, is all. We’re both going to be a big part of Teddy’s life, you know?” He lifted one shoulder in a clumsy shrug before straightening and facing his friends directly. “After Teddy got upset the other weekend and yelled at me, I guess I just—we just—we should get along, is all. For Teddy.”
Harry inhaled sharply as he was pulled into Malfoy’s hard body. He glanced down, staring at the pale fingers that held him firmly, swallowing thickly at the heat that reverberated from the other man’s body. He had always thought that Malfoy would be cool to the touch, but as soon as they were close, the warmth that encompassed Harry made small beads of sweat begin to form, dripping slowly down his lower back. He bit his lip.
It didn’t make any sense.
He did not know what else to do, not when Teddy wouldn’t let Harry try to heal him. He felt helpless, unable to do anything more than murmuring soft words of love and encouragement, promising that Draco would be there soon.
“Well, it’s not like I didn’t
Harry narrowed his eyes as he shoved a mouthful of eggs into his mouth. He focused on chewing for a moment, before mumbling, “They’re not blood traitors.”
and let me talk, Harry James.”
“No, no, no, you do
Harry groaned, running his hands through his tousled hair as he glared at the ceiling. He had been so sure that Malfoy had been up to something. It had been the only thing that made sense. And yet, Harry could recognize that it was possible he may have been not
“You’re okay.”
That would mean that Harry had a chance.
Draco breathed in sharply as Harry’s thumb ran over his nipple, and Harry quickly looked up, sharp grey eyes staring back at him.
A sniffle sounded, followed closely by Teddy’s choked voice, “I know. But you’ll be back next week, right Draco? You can’t forget.”
“Yes, Nana!”
“That’s better. Now, Draco—” Teddy tugged lightly on Malfoy’s hand “—you have to accept Harry’s apology. That’s how this works, right Nana?” He turned inquiring eyes up to Andromeda, standing next to Harry with a soft smile curling at her lips.
“Of course,” Draco breathed, left cheek dimpling as his lips curled in a soft smile.
Malfoy tilted his head, crossing his arms as he leaned back against the counter. His bright eyes slowly ran down Harry’s body before lazily making their way back up to stare resolutely into Harry’s own.
“Have you noticed anything peculiar about when he morphs? Any particular emotions he is experiencing, perhaps, or commonly adopted features?”
Harry startled at the sound of his name on Malfoy’s lips. Inhaling sharply, he turned to look at the other man, whose shoulders were stiff where he knelt before Teddy.

“That’s nearly a
“I’m sorry, Tedward. I must finish my shift in the A&E. But I will see you later in the week, once your Nana returns from her visit to France. How does that sound?”
Harry grimaced, glancing towards the doors to the sitting room, wishing that someone would burst through and break the sudden tension building in the room.
Harry stood, riveted as he watched them make their goodbyes. Despite having seen how gentle he was with the boy before, the comfort with which Malfoy displayed such casual affection towards Teddy was still a surprise, entirely unexpected from Harry’s previous views of who Malfoy was.
“Draco—“ Potter starts, reaching towards you, but you push him away, scrambling off of the couch until your back is pressesd securely against the wall, where you can look Potter directly in the eye.
The ring on your finger doesn’t mean anything.
Draco studied Harry curiously for a moment before tilting his head in acknowledgement. “Very well. I will owl prior to any visit. Thank you for the invitation.”
“You are a natural. And I’m sure that Draco teaching you to fly behind my back didn’t hurt.” Harry smirked, glancing slyly down at Teddy, watching in amusement as a dark blush began to spread across his cheeks.
. Harry couldn’t picture the man not only helping those in need, but voluntarily agreeing to wear the ghastly green Healer’s robes.
“Okay...” Teddy sighed, shuffling feet as he made his way out of the kitchen, “...but Draco was going to make us toasties. Can we still have toasties, please?”
You don’t deserve him.
Hermione was determinedly avoiding his eyes as she settled on the loveseat. She smiled down at Gary, waving her fingers in front of him as he rolled onto his back, small paws batting at the digits.
—?” He began to demand just as Luna interjected with a graceful force.
Her lips parted in what would have surely been a gasp on anyone but her, amber eyes widening as she took in his appearance. Harry bit the inside of his cheek, shifting in place.
The cottage was quiet, Harry and Malfoy both frozen in awkward silence, while Teddy giggled as he dragged a piece of string across the floor for Gary to chase.
“And how is that going?” she questioned, running her fingers through Gary’s colorful fur.
Andromeda smiled softly at her grandson before turning her gaze on Malfoy, “And I will see you on Tuesday for tea?”
, then!” Teddy grabbed Harry’s hand and began pulling him from the sitting room and towards the stairs. “We need to get my things and go! There is so much to do!”
Ginny sniggered as she pulled away from Draco, throwing an amused glance at Harry before continuing on as if nothing absurd had just happened. She nodded towards where Angelina was beginning to gather all of the children together. “We’ll start soon. The team will be running everything and helping the sprogs, but you’re welcome to fly on the outskirts and watch if you’d like. Ron said he’d be here as well, but who knows when he’ll actually show up.”
He could just picture it.
“Of course he’s not too young. Bill and Charlie taught me when I was three,” Ron shrugged, smiling crookedly towards his girlfriend.
Hermione hesitated for a moment, narrowing her eyes in thought, whispering as if to herself, “I suspect that he may also instinctively do what he could to ensure that those bonds do, in fact, strengthen—rather than break.”
“Oh, no! I just meant—” Harry spluttered, eyes widening as he realized what he had asked, and what it could imply. Not that he didn’t want that—bloody hell, and he
Gods, he was such a bloody idiot.
Harry huffed, “Well, don’t you see? He’s obviously up to something!”
It felt like
Draco tilted his head, silky blond hair falling across his forehead. He blinked slowly and tucked the strands behind one ear.
As he began to walk up the cobblestone pathway to Andromeda’s cottage, Harry’s shoulders relaxed. He could hear the ringing laughter of his godson, the delicious fragrance of something sweet wafting from the kitchen window as he pushed open the front door and made his way inside.
you’re not.” Ginny rolled her eyes dramatically. She looked him straight in the eyes, voice monotone, as she stated, “You’re the most observant person I have ever known.”
Harry furrowed his brows, biting his lower lip as he stared down at the buttered bread he had torn apart. When it had only been Teddy and Andromeda who seemed immune to Malfoy’s schemes, everything made sense. It had to have been
“You are certain that everything is alright?” Jesse questioned, eyeing Harry carefully and resting a hand against Draco’s shoulder, giving it a quick squeeze.
“It’s alright, Malfoy. I’ve got you.”
“Er...” Harry swallowed, shifting as he looked between Teddy and Malfoy, before shrugging awkwardly, “Well, alright then.”
It’s sickening, really.
A sharp tap sounded against the window and Harry glanced up to see an owl hovering just beyond, the
“Nothing, Mr. Potter, sir. I will leave you to it,” Maggie winked. She rested a hand briefly on Teddy’s shoulder, squeezing, before turning swiftly and leaving the room.
Malfoy began to straighten while levitating the rhubarb crumble from the oven to cool and replacing it with the blackcurrant crumble. Harry quickly snapped his gaze back, face flushing as he realized he could have been caught staring.
You bite your lip, wincing at the sting of pain that ricochets throughout your core.
As Harry reached forward, clasping the glass in his own hands, their fingers brushed and Harry felt a thrill run up his spine.
Like a crup following his master, Harry was helpless but to follow Draco from the room.
His back hit the soft cushion of his bed before the air rushed out of his lungs as Draco landed on top of him.
“Oh, that’s wonderful, Harry!” Hermione exclaimed, clapping her hands in front of her and startling Gary from where he was curled in her lap.
With Draco’s reassurance, Teddy’s eyelids fell heavily as sleep overcame him. Carefully, Draco extracted himself from Teddy’s hold. Harry approached, stopping by his side and brushing Teddy’s blond fringe from his forehead. He leaned forward, pressing a gentle kiss to the boy’s head—overlapping where Draco’s lips had only just been—before pulling back and meeting Draco’s sharp gaze. Draco stared at him, eyes bright and unwavering. After a moment, Draco turned to tuck the blankets carefully around Teddy’s body. He brushed his fingers against Teddy’s cheek, lingering as a blond lock of hair curled around his finger, then gracefully turned and made his way out of the room, gesturing quietly for Harry to follow.
“Draco...” He started, taking a hesitant step forward. As he began to reach out, fingers itching to

“Alright, then,” Andromeda gracefully stood from her seat, “We will discuss it when I return tomorrow.”

Hermione stayed quiet.
“Oh?” George’s brows rose nearly to his hairline, mouth forming a perfect ‘o’ in his feigned shock.
so close that if he leaned forward the smallest amount they might actually—
“Oh,” Teddy breathed out, legs folding under him quickly to sit in front of the small creature. “Hello.”
Casting a quick charm—cleaning, lubricating.
“I cannot believe that you bought Teddy a training broom,” Hermione sighed, shaking her head as they watched Teddy hovering in the back garden of the Burrow the following morning, George and Ginny crouching by his side as he began to maneuver around the obstacles they had created for him.
Harry lost himself in the heat of Draco’s mouth, his back pressed firmly against the wall, Draco’s hard body at his front. He threw his head back, gasping as Draco mouthed along his jaw.
Harry had never seen Malfoy like this, quite so relaxed. He looked as if he was no longer playing a role, no longer trying to appease anyone else—simply enjoying himself. The light from the windows created a halo around Malfoy, and he
“You probably will,” Harry agreed, turning back to his dishes. He was just about to reach for another plate when Ginny punched him—

! Whatever it is you’re calling him now.” Ron’s voice was high, a mixture of hysteria and exasperation.
Harry’s vision blurred and he took a shaky breath, eyes flickering across the Quidditch pitch. Teddy was jumping off of his broom, waving eagerly to his new friends as they began to depart, the day camp finally finishing, before turning to run towards Harry.
You’re sorry.
Draco laughed, throwing an amused glance over his shoulder at Harry and winking before turning back to Teddy. Harry bit his lip, following them out of the sitting room, wishing he could prevent the heat from rushing to his cheeks.
You take a deep breath, gasping for oxygen, as fire begins to lick at your skin again, teasing as it begins to encompass you.
. Harry’s breath caught at the added pressure. “Oh my
“Harry? Where are you?” Teddy yelled pointedly.
Draco ran his fingers through Teddy’s curls one last time before turning around, pausing when his eyes met Harry’s.
“Harry!” Teddy squealed, spinning around on his stool and nearly toppling off. Malfoy’s hands quickly reached out to stabilize him, seeker reflexes evidently still in use.
Ginny stared at Harry over the rim of her wine glass as she took a deep sip, one delicate auburn brow raised in question. She sat in the corner of his loveseat in the sitting room at Grimmauld, feet curled beneath her, the fire of the hearth reflecting brilliantly from her red hair.

“You stayed,” Teddy whispered, voice vulnerable and full of hope.
Pain shoots through your body, quickly soothed by pleasure.

“Er...I’m not sure. Luna is trying to convince me to help her at the sanctuary. She thinks I’d make a good magizoologist...”
Snatching his hand away from Hermione, Harry stared at her in shock. “
You gasp, choking on a sob as you pull oxygen into your lungs. The last air in the room before Fiendfyre consumes it all.
“Thank you.”
“You seem quite distracted, Harry. I thought I saw a wrackspurt zooming around earlier. Would you like me make sure it hasn’t infected you?” Luna’s melodic voice broke Harry’s daze. Blinking quickly, he turned to look at her and offered a sheepish smile.
Their eyes met, and Harry felt as if he could breathe again as Draco’s lips curled in a soft, private smile, before he continued to read aloud to Teddy.
“Er, what about it?”
Harry’s jaw dropped, lips parting in surprise, as he stared at his godson. The last he had seen, Teddy had only just begun to morph into other people that he knew. But this—morphing into a

Her lips were pursed together, eyebrows raised in exasperation as she stared at him. Andromeda shook her head and sighed, “Must you, Harry?”
Teddy reached out quickly to grasp Harry’s hand and immediately began to pull him towards the entrance to the shop. The boy waved distractedly towards George as he pushed the door open. “Bye George! See you later!”
“No, you’re not,” Draco stated as he strode towards him. Pale fingers reached out, carefully wrapping around Harry’s wrist and pulling it from where it held his torso. “Here. Let me help.”
“He has to go because it’s important, and it’s only goodbye for now,” Teddy sighed, kicking indignantly at the dirt.

“Er...right, of course. So, how is that going?”
“Er...sure,” Harry nodded, glancing down the hall to where the drawing room was as he allowed himself to be led into the sitting room.
Harry watched as Teddy wandered off before turning around to ask Andromeda if he could help prepare lunch. Before he could, he stopped in place at the strength of Andromeda’s glare, brows furrowed in frustration and fists clenched on her hips.

Harry took in a sharp breath before spinning on his heels and marching towards the library. “Bloody

“Excellent. We won’t be long,” Draco turned and gestured for Harry to exit the room.
He had been trying to solve the mystery of Malfoy since he dropped Teddy back off at Andromeda’s cottage on Sunday evening. After three days, nothing new was brought to light. Andromeda had only given him a stern look, reminding him that he was not to speak ill of Malfoy. Teddy, meanwhile, didn’t mind talking about his cousin at all.  In fact, when the topic of Malfoy came up, it was difficult to get Teddy to

“Can we go say hello to George?” Teddy asked as they walked down to cobblestone streets of Diagon Alley the next morning. His little hand clutched a cone from Fortescue’s, caramel and pistachio ice cream melting over his sticky fingers.
Ginny hummed, tilting her head as she observed Harry from her perch on the loveseat. Slowly, her eyes glimmered with mischief, her lips splitting with a sharp smile.
Suffocating.
Draco hummed, “Yes, I suppose it is. While you finish, Tedward and I will be off to play an exciting game called

“Yes, Tedward?” Draco whispered.
obvious.
“He...Draco isn’t here, Teddy,” Harry spoke slowly, gently, trying to soothe the boy. “But it’s okay. I’ve got you, Teddy. I’ve got you.”
“Gary?” Ron chuckled, “How’d he come up with that?”
Malfoy gave one last smile towards Teddy before striding out of the kitchen, nodding briefly to Harry as he passed. Only a moment later, they heard the roar of the hearth as Malfoy Floo-ed away.
“Shh, it’s alright.”
The man—
Kreacher snorted disbelievingly before turning around and beginning to clean the kitchen.
The kitchen was quiet for a few moments as Harry and Malfoy stared after Teddy.
It sounded
Andromeda merely hummed in response. She gracefully reached forward, grasping her teacup from where it hovered in front of her to hold it carefully in her hands.
Malfoy’s lips twitched with a grin, the corners of his eyes crinkling slightly, before he turned and strode towards the doors.
abandoning his responsibilities to Teddy should show you he’s no good!”
The Kneazle was tiny, the size of a kitten. It resembled a calico with its orange, black and white coloring, splotches of color painted across its fur. Bright green eyes shimmered as it stared at Teddy, tail twitching lazily.
Harry self-consciously tugged at the hem of the tight purple
Absolute sin.
. They would never be—
Malfoy gracefully flicked his wrist, a handkerchief materializing between his fingers. He pressed the cloth against the rim of the vial, tilting it so that the potion could saturate the handkerchief, before drawing it away again.
Potter frowns, thick brows furrowing as he takes a step toward you, “Yes. And I have for many years.”
Ron preened at this, his freckles nearly disappearing with his pleased flush.
Harry’s breath stuttered.
“‘S too bad, Pott’r,” Draco murmured.
The three of them stood silently in the ward as the door closed behind Maggie. As subtly as he could, Harry cleared his throat, “Well...should we go, then?”
The door to the kitchen slammed open and Malfoy stepped through. A flush sat high upon his porcelain cheeks, his normally pristine blond hair a mess as his sharp gaze locked onto Teddy immediately.
“Harry, what color do you want?” Teddy asked as Harry sat down beside him, his knee brushing against Draco’s as he folded his legs.
Harry flushed, shrugging sheepishly. “I am.”
Another glass is lifted to your lips. The stench of it burns your nostrils.
“Oh, nothing,” George shrugged, taking a leisurely sip from his drink as he watched Harry, “This all just sounds very familiar, is all.”
Draco laughed, “Well, of course I did, Tedward. I told you I would, didn’t I?”
“So what if I am?”
For him.
Harry could feel the blood draining from his face. His hand shook as he reached for his bedside table, needing something to hold himself up with.
Harry blinked, dumbfounded by the question. By the look in Andromeda’s eyes, he knew he was about to be interrogated in some way. But this was perhaps the strangest prelude to an interrogation he had ever experienced.
With nothing to do the following week, and all of his friends busy with their own careers, Harry spent the next few days trying to keep himself occupied—and attempting to keep his mind off of a certain blond, but failing miserably.
You turn away.
“What? Difficult for
every time that he overtook one of their pawns. He cackled, rolling onto his back and kicking his legs whenever Draco drew a ‘
A soft purr began to vibrate around him, and Harry’s eyes snapped open to look directly into feline eyes staring back at him. Teddy had stepped forward, clutching the Kneazle to his chest and standing directly in front of Harry, bright eyes fixed on Harry’s own.
Harry ignored Kreacher’s grumbling as he left the room, quickly swallowing the vile potion. His stomach churned, and he clenched his teeth, trying not to gag as the taste of the revolting liquid coated his tongue. After a moment, his stomach settled, throbbing headache receding as the glare of the morning light dimmed. He let out a sigh of relief as he stretched against his cold bed sheets, rolling onto his back and staring at the ceiling.
“It’s done,” you whisper against his neck, fingers twining together as your Disapparate amidst the ruins of what you  leave behind.
Malfoy sat in his armchair, a fond smile softening his sharp features as he watched Teddy play with the Kneazle. Any grudge the creature may have held from the earlier morph had obviously been dismissed, as Gary let out an excited meow every time he circled Teddy.
“What do you mean?” Harry pressed. He could not leave this conversation as it was—he needed to know something more, something that would settle his heart, beating rapidly against his chest.
Malfoy perched himself on the edge of his armchair, staring intently at Teddy as he cried. He didn’t say a word, made no move to console the boy, and Harry began to fume.
Malfoy was standing in front of the kitchen sink, arms elbow-deep in soapy suds that were beginning to overflow, a pile of dirty dishes stacked neatly to his right and clean dishes drying to his left.
Nodding, Harry leaned forward, gingerly lifting Teddy into his arms and standing slowly so as not to jostle him more than he had to. Teddy buried his head into Harry’s chest, trembling as his sobs became whimpers, interrupted by an occasional hiccup.
“Mmm,” Potter hums, one hand dancing up your side until he is able to pinch your left nipple.
especially when his godson looked at him with such desperate need and brilliant silver eyes.
A sudden terrified cry echoed throughout the garden.
“I can’t
Healed with a magic that I can see. That
With not even a backwards glance, Malfoy placed a hand gently atop Teddy’s shoulder, guiding him to the cupboards so that they could gather plates and utensils with which to set the small kitchen table. Despite Andromeda’s initial insistence on proper decorum, they had all begun to dine together on Saturday’s at the table at the center of the large kitchen, an informal and intimate affair that Harry took comfort in.
“Gary, come on!”
Snickering, Harry picked up the remainder of his toasty and unceremoniously dunked it in his soup, lifting it to his mouth and taking a large bite. As he chewed, he glanced to his side and caught Andromeda’s cool gaze.
Turning away from the window, Harry focused on his breakfast and the steaming cup of coffee in front of him, startling when Kreacher threw the paper down in front of him.
He thought he could hear Draco choke in the background, spluttering in an attempt to stop the conversation from progressing, before Teddy excitedly chirped, “Oh, no! Draco likes it when I have dark curly hair and green eyes.”
“I have an early shift today,” Draco said quickly, dismissing Harry’s heated gaze—bloody hell, Andromeda was right...Harry
“You rarely are,” Draco stated, his cheek dimpling as his lips twitched.
Jesse stood next to Ginny, grinning brightly and laughing at something that she said, her cheeks flushed in the afternoon heat. The man looked happy—ecstatic—and Harry could not help but grind his teeth, nails digging into his palms as his fists clenched tightly at his sides.
Harry glanced at Andromeda, nodding in confirmation, before looking back at Teddy, whose head was buried in the side of Gary’s small body. He could feel eyes watching him curiously from the other side of the room and hesitated before turning to meet the mercurial gaze.
“Why not?”
Teddy rolled his eyes, sighing dramatically—in such a manner that Harry was
“Yes, but then I’ll still be the
“That they are.” The shopkeeper nodded sagely, calm eyes focused on Teddy. “You know, they say that Kneazles choose their companion, not the other way around. Kneazles know to whom they are to be a familiar.”
I place the empty glass on the bar—the hollow echo ringing in my ears as I turn.
“I believe so. He has done so well with little Teddy, and Teddy adores him,” Luna smiled serenely before letting out a soft sigh. “Oh, it must be so difficult for him.”
You want to feel him.
They have no idea.
Maybe he would have to make an effort to be nicer to Malfoy.
he thought, recalling how he felt as he cooked in Andromeda’s cottage, the warmth of the kitchen wrapping around him with the comforting smell of a home cooked meal. Maybe this new venture would be
Teddy grinned. “Alright. You’ll come for lunch soon?”
Harry could hear Jesse’s deep voice begin to question Draco as they walked away, but he ignored it, focusing instead on putting enough distance between them.
Why does it hurt so much?
“Hi there, Teddy! I hear that you like
. Is that still the case?”
He placed a quick
Andromeda hummed, “Helping at Mr. Longbottom’s shop now, aren’t you?”
Harry smirked, biting his lip lower lip smugly as he stared at Malfoy. The other man’s gaze seemed to dip, just briefly, to his own mouth. But it was too quick for Harry to be sure—it was certainly just a trick of the light in the kitchen as clouds shifted over the midday sun.

Her robes billowed out behind her as Andromeda swiftly made her way from the sitting room. Harry could hear her gather her trunk before a distinct
“Yeah! It’s great fun,” Teddy smiled brightly, “I want to be yellow!”
Harry smirked as he looked into Malfoy’s stormy grey eyes, “What...? Are you scared, Malfoy?”
He comes to you in the dark of night. When shadows conceal him—when even the
Harry slowly made his way through the cottage. He could hear muffled voices coming from outside. Realizing that the three of them must be in the garden, Harry strode through the kitchen towards the back door. He took a slow breath, steeling himself for whatever Malfoy might be up to, before stepping out.
Malfoy huffed, tucking his hands underneath Teddy’s armpits and lifting him from the counter, depositing him gently on the kitchen floor. “Do you
Your body
“Oh, really?” Harry smiled indulgently, sparing a quick glance at Malfoy to see the man looking intently at Teddy as if Harry were not there. “What did you practise?”
“Okay, yes, maybe at first I...I suspected something, but—“ Harry hesitated, grimacing as his gaze flickered towards the door to the garden, where he could hear Teddy’s voice as he played. “Well, I don’t now. Alright?”
“Really, Gin?” Harry huffed exasperatedly,  pinching his lips together as he narrowed his eyes at her feet.
“You okay?” Draco asked, pressing a kiss to the hollow beneath Harry’s ear and draping himself over Harry’s body, his hard cock rubbing between Harry’s cheeks, catching on his rim and pulling a stuttered groan from him.
, before striding to follow his godson.
Teddy leapt into the air, thrusting his tiny fists above his head in excitement as he squealed, “Yeah! Let’s go!”
“Is Master needing his clothes to be washed?” Kreacher’s scratchy voice sounded through the door.
“Draco...please,” Harry choked out, begging, “Tell me I have a chance.”
It’s unstoppable, this thing between the two of you.
“Shh,” Draco hushed, pulling his face from Harry’s arse. “Shh, I’ve got you.”
“This child,” Draco laughed tightly. There was a deep blush spreading across his cheeks, and Harry noted that the tips of his ears were beginning to pink. He spoke quickly, his voice higher than it normally was. “The imagination he holds...it’s outstanding, is it not? Mm, yes, of course it is. He gets that from my late cousin—Nymphadora. Quite the imagination, she had! Something all metamorphmagi have, of course.”
After a hectic Sunday at the Burrow and a leisurely Monday morning, Harry and Teddy found themselves alone at Grimmauld Place on Monday afternoon. Or rather, as alone as they could be with Gary stuck close to Teddy’s side.
Is that you?
They landed firmly on the green grass of the Harpies’ Quidditch Pitch. Almost instantly, Teddy screamed in excitement, waving frantically as Ginny and Angelina flew past them and rushing towards the center of the Quidditch pitch, where a crowd was beginning to gather
“Oh, darling,” Andromeda placed her tea on the table beside her, slowly folding her hands in her lap, “There is no need to pretend otherwise with me. I have known for quite some time.”
?” Harry laughed shrilly. His voice sounded higher than it normally was, nearly hysterical. “Oh my god, Ron. I don’t want to
“Hey!” Harry cried, grinning as he petulantly slapped at Draco’s bare chest. They laughed, shoving at each other, before Harry placed his hands on either side of Draco’s sharp face and pulled him forward, kissing him soundly. They slowed, Draco’s hands wrapping around Harry and tugging him closer as their tongues intertwined, hips rolling against one another.
“But...how?” Harry frowned, confused. He had only just realized how he felt about Draco. How was it possible that Andromeda not only knew, but had for a
Harry paused, hesitating for a moment, “Er...what?”
“Thank you, darling,” Andromeda’s smile softened with pleasure—and how did Malfoy know that Hydrangeas were her favorite flower?
You groan, throat exposed, gasping for breath, as teeth bite into your skin—
As Draco finished the story, Teddy’s eyes began to drift closed. Softly, he murmured, “Draco?”
Harry hummed, glancing once more towards the door of the room before turning on the spot, disregarding any proper discharge protocols, to Disapparate back to Grimmauld Place.
“I’m sorry, Mr. Potter. But Trainee Healer Malfoy is currently in the A&E assisting with a procedure.” Her tongue darted out to lick her lips and she smiled shakily up at him. “I am sure that another Healer would be happy to help you—“
Lips press against your jaw, your throat, your collarbone…
They stared at one another for a few moments before Teddy’s peal of laughter echoed down the hallway and Harry looked away. Teddy adored Malfoy, and it was clear that Malfoy likely felt the same, if his interactions today meant anything at all. Maybe—at least in this instance—Malfoy wasn’t
Harry opened his mouth to defend himself before he got caught on what Andromeda actually said.
“Alright, Tedward. It has approximately 35 minutes to crisp. Go ahead and add the crumble to the blackcurrant now, and then we can add it to the oven as well.” Malfoy instructed, his voice soft and encouraging as he stood back up and watched as Teddy began to sprinkle the crumble over a dish to his side.
the best.” His eyes widened once more in excitement as he spun towards Harry, evidently dismissing any lecture he had just received. “And he
Andromeda hummed, narrowing her eyes as she observed Harry. “Well, so long as we are clear that Gary is to reside at Grimmauld Place, I suppose there is no harm.”
“What!? I’m not oblivious!” Harry sputtered, turning to glare at Ginny, resting his wet hands against his hips—ignoring the suds dripping onto his jeans.
Harry huffed, reluctantly amused by the man’s affronted tone, “You’ve got crumble—or something—on your cheek, Malfoy. That’s all.”
Tripping up the stairs, they made their way to Teddy’s room. While Teddy rushed around, grabbing the toys and books he wanted them to play with, Harry couldn’t help but wonder what he was getting himself into tonight.
“Ginevra,” he leaned forward and bowed magnanimously.
Not this time.
He cringed as he stood, pain coursing through his body with the movement. Jesse pursed his lips, clearly disapproving, but took a step back to give Harry more space.
You let your head rest heavily against the edge, eyes caught on the empty vials scattered across the floor.
“I guess,” Teddy sighed. He scuffed one foot lethargically against the floor, holding a hand out for Harry to grasp.
You can’t give him what he needs.
Standing on the outskirts of the pitch was Ron, a triumphant smirk upon his lips as he watched Harry chasing after Draco.
Harry bit his lip so hard he could taste blood. He could feel his own eyes begin to fill with tears, frustrated that he could not help ease his godson’s pain. He wasn’t even the person that Teddy
“Oh, er...he’s good,” Harry nodded, reaching for the fresh loaf of bread in the center of the table and grabbing a thick slice. “We stopped into Magical Menagerie this weekend and I bought him a Kneazle. He loved that feral Kneazle I got down from Andy’s tree the other month so much, I couldn’t say no when he asked for one.”
, Hermione. I’m telling you, Malfoy is
“Of course. Anyway...” Draco smiled tightly—though Harry noticed that his dimple did not appear—looking just over Harry’s shoulder. “Unfortunately, I must depart. I have been called into the A&E this afternoon, and cannot be late.”
“Ready!” Teddy called, kicking his legs out and knocking his feet against Harry’s thighs.
for Teddy? When do I ever
Harry snorted, grumbling beneath his breath, “When does Malfoy ever have any obligations other than counting his galleons?”
Draco and Teddy sat in the middle of the room, the muggle board game set up between them, colorful pieces already placed into position as Teddy explained the rules of the game to Draco.
Right.
, but what if he does in the future? What if something happens where knowledge of how werewolf hierarchies function—their underlying purpose—is absolutely dire for us to know?”
if we are late because you refused to come downstairs!”
With an exasperated huff, Harry shot a glare at his friend, “You bloody well know who it is.”
read the title. Harry rolled his eyes—trust Malfoy to throw money at everyone in an effort to make up for his past, rather than actually doing anything.
“Aunt ‘Dromeda!” Malfoy’s voice spoke above him, higher than normal and sounding choked. “Have you finished your painting?”
Of course he would not hurt Teddy. He would do everything he could to protect the boy.
“Of course,” Harry smiled crookedly, shrugging one shoulder in an awkward movement. “There’s plenty of room. And Kreacher made up the guest rooms—” He chuckled before recognizing the implication, eyes widening as he looked frantically at Draco. “—not that you have to stay over, of course! It’s just that...there’s room, is all. If you want to come over. To visit. Teddy. To visit Teddy, while he is staying...with me.”
“You fell, Harry!” Teddy cried, gazing up at Harry with glistening grey eyes, tears beginning to roll down his flushed cheeks. He rubbed his face against Harry’s thigh before turning it to the side and reaching a trembling hand out to Draco, fingers grasping at the open air. “Draco—” Teddy choked on a sob “—you
broom, ‘Mione,” Harry cut in, patting her shoulder lightly as she spluttered at Ron. “It only hovers a few feet from the ground. He’ll be fine. Besides, it’ll be good for him to practise before the day camp in a couple of weeks.”
We grin, lips curling, and I tuck my head into his neck, biting at delicate skin. I lave at the reddened flesh, pressing gentle kisses against bruised marks, thinking that there is something so precious about this…
Draco chuckled, low and deep as he grinned sharply. “Sweet Salazar, Potter...what do you think we’ve been doing for the past few weeks?”
“Er...” Harry cleared his throat. There, upon Malfoy’s cheekbones, leading into his platinum blonde hair, was a light flush. The rosy hue was painted against delicate cheekbones, against the bridge of a pointed nose and the tips of pale ears.
“Harry!” Teddy scrambled up from the ground, stumbling towards Harry in his excitement. “You’re here so early!”
“Enough talk of bloody Malfoy. Let’s eat!”
“Ah, of course,” Harry nodded, grimacing as he recalled only weeks before when he had all but forced Malfoy to leave early.
You hate each other.
called for you.
“Fine,” Harry grumbled. He couldn’t very well let Ginny think he was scared. Besides, he was sure he could last a week working at a café.
Malfoy merely gazed back, cool grey eyes firm as they watched Harry, proud yet resigned. His shoulders were stiff, as if he were preparing for a blow.
“He does,” Harry chuckled softly, “And...you like that I did, too?”
“But I wanted to have some crumble,” Teddy shrugged, swallowing the last of his mouthful. “It’s nearly done, anyway...and it looks so good.”
“Hey, Draco. You’re okay. Breathe with me.”
Harry grinned brightly. “Good.” He leaned forward, brushing his lips briefly against Draco’s, before tucking his head below Draco’s chin. He breathed in deeply, reveling in the sharp scent of citrus, drifting asleep to the feeling of fingers carding through his hair.
“Brilliant!” Teddy cried, jumping up and down and thrusting one fist into the air.

Having a
You’re missing something.
“Well, Teddy is a metamorphmagus,” Hermione pointed out softly, “Are you certain he wasn’t helping Teddy practise?”
Harry watched Malfoy for a few more moments, chewing at his bottom lip. He could not deny that Malfoy was certainly different now—not after seeing him interacting with Teddy, after seeing the way his smile lit up his face.
They froze, and the moment shattered.
he was sure that Hermione and Ron would instantly be convinced of Malfoy’s unsettling behavior.
“I lost control of my broom. We’re okay, Teddy,” Harry said quietly, biting back a wince as he knelt down next to his godson, rubbing a hand soothingly against the boy’s back. Out of the corner of his eyes, he could see Draco step forward to hold onto Teddy’s outstretched hand.
Screaming voices—
Harry threw an annoyed glance at Ginny, who only grinned sharply back at him. “Er...a plant might have...burst, at Neville’s shop the other day. He didn’t really need me around anyhow, and...well, I’d really rather not be covered in plant saliva.”
Teddy giggled, running his hands gently over the Kneazle’s colorful flanks. His rich amber eyes had morphed, reflecting the green of the Kneazle’s own, his pure happiness evident in his shining eyes and flushed cheeks.
Rolling his eyes, Harry shot an unimpressed look at his best friend. Ron shrugged apologetically while Hermione pursed her lips, a worry line lingering between her brows.
“Do you remember what I said about pack hierarchy?” Hermione questioned, before quickly dismissing it with a frantic wave of her hand. “No, of course you don’t. Teddy may not be a werewolf, but his father was one. It is possible that some instincts that are inherent within werewolves may be woven into Teddy’s own genes.”
“He...what?” Harry froze, trying to school his features as he realized that Malfoy had ditched, abandoning Teddy during his regularly appointed time with the boy.
Harry blinked, slowly. After a few moments, he croaked, “What.”
“D’you promise you’ll stay?” Teddy rubbed his face against Draco’s chest, his breathing beginning to slow. “Want you to be here in the morning...”
. No, he was protecting his godson and Andromeda. This was what family did, after all. They watched over one another.
Malfoy nodded, taking a deep, calming breath. “And...
to know.”
Harry stiffened, pulling back to look at Ginny warily. “Jesse will be helping?”
. And for the next week, he would have someone to share it with.
“Kneazles are wonderful companions,” Luna encouraged with a smile.
, Harry grudgingly unrolled it, flipping through the pages with little interest until a photo caught his eye and he paused.
“Draco!”
Teeth biting into flesh.
“Tedward!” Malfoy choked out. His voice sounded deeper than normal, hoarse. Harry spared one last glance at Malfoy before turning to see why his godson was being scolded so suddenly.
“Shh, it’s okay,” Harry whispered, walking towards the bed in the center of the room and laying Teddy down upon it. Teddy sniffled, turning his head into the pillow beneath him, tears beginning to crust on his cheeks.
“What else would it mean, Harry? They were
Harry hesitated as he looked down at Teddy, who gazed up at him with bright, glimmering silver eyes, lower lip trembling with his pout, before looking towards Malfoy.
Staring curiously as Malfoy turned, bending to place the crumble back into the oven to brown, Harry found himself wondering when Malfoy got so tall. The deep blue shirt he was wearing pulled tightly against the breadth of his shoulders, tucked neatly into his jeans—and if
Malfoy gave a quick nod in response. He glanced towards Teddy and winked before striding out of the door to the back garden.
“An apple rhubarb crumble and a blackcurrant crumble,” Malfoy retorted, his voice firm, steady with no hint of inflection.
“Harry...” Andromeda’s brows lifted, eyes lingering on the print of his t-shirt. Delicately, she cleared her throat, “Good morning.”
Harry glanced towards Malfoy, pausing as he saw the other man staring at him, brows furrowed.
“Wait, Malfoy. What—”
Your lips suckle at his jaw, make their way down, down,
Kreacher merely hummed as he turned back toward the counter, cleaning up the residue from the morning meal.
—” her voice cut off as the door shut solidly behind her.
“Yeah.”
Within moments, Andromeda joined them, gliding into the kitchen gracefully as if she were entering a ballroom. She helped them retrieve the hors d'oeuvres from their stasis charms, placing them in the center of the table.
. I’m trying to protect my family. And I know that Malfoy is up to something, whether you lot believe me or not.”
know?”
“Thanks, ‘Mione,” Harry whispered, placing a quick kiss to the crown of her head.
, but you love him.
The garden was silent for a few moments before Andromeda let out a soft breath, “Well then, shall we have tea? We can then begin to prepare luncheon. Harry, do be a dear and pick a few tomatoes, won’t you? Come along, Teddy, let’s go wash up.”
Malfoy startled, his head snapping to the side to stare at Harry from where he was beginning to clean the dishes. His bright eyes were wide with shock, pink lips parted in surprise. Harry determinedly did not look back at him, focusing instead on Teddy, who gazed between the two curiously.
Teddy frowned, scrunching his nose as he looked up at Harry, staring at him as if Harry had completely lost the plot “No, he doesn’t.”
“I can’t stay,” Draco snapped, running a hand quickly through his hair, the normally pristine coif falling into disarray.
“No. Malfoy spends Saturday mornings with Teddy. That’s the deal, right? What could possibly be more important than spending time with your cousin, Malfoy?” Harry spat, taking a step closer to Malfoy, tilting his head up to glare at him, standing so close that he could feel Mafloy’s breath against his face. “So what’s your excuse, huh, Malfoy? What was
“No, no!” Ron shook his head, eyes lifting to the ceiling as he took a deep breath, “No. I just mean that sometimes he helps. Aurors get roughed up a lot, you know? And he’s not so bad, when I do see him.”
Slowly, Draco leaned over to place
Reaching out, he grasped the handle, the heavy oak door creaking on its hinges as it swung open.
Maybe Malfoy really wasn’t so bad. He obviously cared a great deal for Teddy and Andromeda, and did not allow his past with Ron to prevent him from coming to his aid. If his response to Teddy being scratched by Gary was anything to go by, he was well suited as a Healer. Patient, caring, and gentle. Almost
Turning the knob, Harry let himself into the cottage. He could hear muffled laughter down the hall. They must be in the library, going over Dark Arts artifacts and ancient manuscripts.
Suddenly, the door to their room slammed open.
Harry couldn’t help but chuckle as he looked down at his godson, so adamant in his argument as he stomped his foot against the floor. Despite how progressive Andromeda seemed to be, she still had pureblood tendencies—obviously encouraged by Malfoy, in this instance, as they tried to instill the importance of a proper waltz in Teddy.
!” Teddy corrected. “Will you come and play, Harry? Please?”
“Oh,” Teddy heaved a deep sigh as he turned back to watch the Kneazles. He placed both hands on the cage, leaning forward until his nose squished against the barriers, before whispering, “I wish one would recognize
You open your eyes.
“Go on, now, Teddy. Go finish your reading while I prepare lunch. I will call you when it is ready.”
Harry laughed, grinning as Teddy bounced on his feet. Tucking the brooms beneath his arms, Harry reached his free hand towards Draco.
oblivious?” He questioned, turning his head and nipping at Harry’s ear. “You wanted to know why Jesse didn’t like you?”
Harry narrowed his eyes slightly, pursing his lips. “Yes, but what other obligations?”
Teddy nodded frantically, his turquoise hair shining brightly in the sunlight.
Draco’s lips began to curl in a coy smile, his left cheek dimpling handsomely. The tip of a pink tongue darted out, leaving plump lips glistening in the light, tempting, and
expression was crossing Malfoy’s sharp features,
“Of course not, but
Ron coughed lightly, “Malfoy was late? Did he say why?”
Slowly, Harry set his tumbler down, “Why haven’t you mentioned seeing him until now?”
Absolutely not. Harry had to put a stop to this, now.
He raises his arms, arching his back—wantonly—tempting all those within the club.
“Congratulations, Ron! You and ‘Mione will be excellent parents.”
You take another drink, relishing the burn as it sears at your throat.
They continued to play for nearly an hour—Teddy won the first two rounds, and the last was taken by a rather smug Draco. As Draco preened—“My
You gasp as skin begins to stitch itself together—
“Hello, Andy,” Harry nodded, smiling sheepishly as he watched her.
“Yes! He was crying, Draco!” Harry threw his hands in the air, huffing in defeat. “He wouldn’t let me look at it—he kept screaming for you! What was I supposed to do, just leave him there? No!” He took a deep breath, biting his lips between his teeth before shrugging. “He wanted
you better?” Teddy asked quietly.
“It’s not the job of the day, Andy, you know that,” Harry huffed. He’d been floating between jobs since the war, trying to determine what he wanted to do with his career. He still hadn’t found anything that truly intrigued him, but he didn’t mind as it allowed him more time to spend with his godson.
are you?
Harry nodded towards the stairs that would lead to Teddy. “You should go,” he whispered, “Teddy has been waiting.”
“Excellent,” Draco smiled at Teddy, and Harry’s eyes were caught on his face, focusing in on the single dimple that appeared on the man’s left cheek. “Now, why don’t you rest here while Harry and I step outside for a moment? I will ask Maggie to come sit with you, and I am certain she will offer a lolly, if you ask her nicely.”
But now…
“Of course, Draco. Whatever you need.”
While Harry certainly did not care if he had made Malfoy uncomfortable with his presence, Harry recognized now that Teddy truly adored his cousin. Malfoy leaving earlier than expected surely hurt him, and if that was due to Harry...well.
His eyes widened so much he feared they may pop out of his head. “Ask

as you roll your hips against his.
“Tedward,” Malfoy sighed, kneeling down so that he was eye level with the boy, “I promise you, Gary is not mad at you. He was just frightened, and felt badly that he hurt you. I am sure that he is eager to see that you are okay and that you still love him.”
Your lips curl in a wicked grin as you light the match, the spark echoing in the empty corridors of the atrium—igniting—light reflecting against the dark liquid coating the floors.

of all people being who Teddy ran to for comfort.
“Yes!” Teddy gasped, stumbling as he quickly spun to stare at the shop owner. “Can I?”
“Yeah. Yeah, it is,” Harry nodded, smiling tightly at Ron before beginning to walk to Teddy. “Anyway, Ron, I’ll see you later, yeah?”

something?”
Potter rolls his hips against your own, and you feel it.
Draco nodded curtly towards Ron, barely sparing a glance toward Harry before turning on his heels. He strode to the center of the Quidditch Pitch, calling Teddy over to him to say his goodbyes.
“Er...I don’t know, Teddy. I think...maybe Draco is right.” Both of Draco’s eyebrows disappeared behind the fringe falling effortlessly across his forehead, lips parting in surprise. Harry coughed lightly and turned to smile at Teddy. “We can fly high after Quidditch Camp, how about that?”

Malfoy rolled his eyes, staring at the ceiling as he mumbled, “Merlin, save me.” One pale hand ran through his platinum hair, ruffling it from its pristine coif. “Fine. For your information, Potter, I know this because it is my
tone he used, Harry was not sure. Before he could spare a moment to think about what he was doing, Harry stepped forward, raising his own hand to Malfoy’s left cheek.
Andromeda let out a soft breath, leaning back in her armchair and tucking one ankle behind the other. “Certainly, it is not my place to reveal another’s intimate feelings, darling. I am merely stating what I have observed.”
we should...”
“Draco...” Harry started, voice deep and hoarse, hesitantly lifting his eyes to look into Draco’s, his heart beginning to thrum in his chest. “Why
Malfoy must have been using a strong
After a few moments, Harry hesitantly lifted his eyes, breathing in sharply as they met bright silver, watching him inquisitively.
If possible, Teddy’s eyes widened even more. He clasped his fists together and they began to shake slightly before he screamed out, “
Harry froze. “What do you mean?”
Without sparing another thought to the matter, Harry summoned the brooms and made his way back into the cottage. Setting them beside the doorway, Harry strode towards the sitting room, where he could hear voices speaking softly.
Harry was between jobs that week, having quit Hannah’s café. His friends were all busy with their own careers, so he found himself alone for most of the week, contemplating what he would try next.
Taking one last drag from his pint, Harry stood from the booth, giving his friends one final cold stare. “For Teddy’s sake, I hope you’re right. I hope Malfoy
Draco reached for the untouched mugs of cocoa on the bedside table and walked towards Harry. He brushed past Harry on his way from the bedroom, and Harry couldn’t stop from inhaling the whiff of citrus that followed.
Harry had forgotten about him. He remembered how closely they had been standing in the article, how

“It—” Harry frowned, blinked thrice. “Wait, what?”
as Malfoy landed heavily on top of him.
Isn’t it what everyone wanted?
I am still selfish enough to take what I want when I have the chance. Merlin, Harry—if you want this—”
It felt as if a bucket of ice water had been thrown across him as he stared at the scars marring Draco’s pale skin—scars that
Andromeda hummed, narrowing her eyes for a moment before pulling away as Teddy clambered down the stairs. “Alright. Floo me if you need anything, then.”
Draco gasped and Harry raised his eyes, looking up at the man through his lashes, lips pursed around a tight nipple. Harry let his hands drift further, dipping below the waistband of Draco’s trousers, thumbing at the button. He raised an eyebrow questioningly, grinning sharply around Draco’s nipple when Draco nodded his consent.
“You’re lying,” Harry stated, glaring at the man in front of him.
“You know, in a moment, you won’t even feel the scratches. Gary didn’t mean to hurt you, Tedward, of that I am certain,” Malfoy said, reaching for a large vial and twisting the cork from in. “And I promise, you won’t even scar. This dittany is the best that exists. You will be the most handsome boy in all of England in moments yet again.”
The fire settles.
It would be fine.
Andromeda would kill him. Ever since that feral Kneazle had gotten stuck in the tree outside of her cottage, she was adamant that they were worthless creatures.
“Hear, hear!” George’s voice echoed behind him as Harry spun around and stormed out of the bar.
A little bell rang above the door as Teddy pushed their way inside. They were instantly enveloped in the warmth of the shop, subtle scents of the animals lingering in the air despite the charms to prevent it.
You enter the lift and make your way up, up,
“What
” Teddy cried, wrapping his arms tightly around Malfoy’s torso and burying his head in the man’s chest. Malfoy wrapped his arms tightly around the boy, lifting him into his lap and tucking Teddy’s head into his shoulder, hushing him gently.
Something is wrong.
. Ginny...he was
“Alright...” Harry agreed slowly. “And, if you win?”
“I love you, too, Tedward,” Malfoy returned the hug and placed a quick kiss upon Teddy’s cheek before standing in one fluid movement. He turned once more to Andromeda, “I will Floo before I arrive on Tuesday. Have a safe trip.”
I’m going to find out what.”
“Of sorts...?” Harry crossed his arms over his chest, raising one eyebrow as he stared directly at Draco.
“Oh, shut it, you,” Harry grumbled. Just as he opened his mouth to defend himself—though he wasn’t precisely sure
“Come
“So, Harry. Nev told me you decided helping at his shop wasn’t a good fit for you.”
Harry turned to look at Malfoy, who was staring at him with astonishment. The man raised his brows, gesturing sharply towards Teddy with a quick shake of his head. Harry frowned, confused by whatever Malfoy was attempting to communicate.
Malfoy slid out of the room, flicking the v at Harry as he brushed past . The kitchen was quiet for a moment, no one daring to speak as the front door closed with a soft
He still had plenty of time until he had to Apparate to Andromeda’s. Tilting his head back, Harry let the water saturate his curls, rivulets streaming down the back of his neck. He blindly reached out for the soap and began to lather it between his fingers.
He walks through the doorway, green eyes glimmering as he smiles at you.
“What?” Teddy’s face fell, eyes beginning to glimmer with tears, slowly shifting from brown to a stormy grey. “But, why?”
“Sure,” Harry nodded slowly, “Pizza sounds good.”
“Good morning, Harry.”
“Oh, Harry, guess what!?” He exclaimed, eyes shining as he pushed himself up to his knees. “Guess, guess!”
“I must be off. Narcissa is expecting me early today.” As she passed Teddy, Andromeda leaned down to press a soft kiss to his cheek. “Be good, darling. I will see you tomorrow.”
He drew back, straddling Draco’s hips and looking down into bright silver eyes. Draco paused, his tongue darting out to wet his lips as he watched Harry carefully. After a moment, he inclined his head in a hesitant nod.
“We’re out here!” Teddy cried, looking anxiously at Andromeda and Harry before scurrying away.

“Well, I mean...it

They returned to the sitting room, embers in the hearth blazing softly and casting a warm light across the room, as Draco poured both of them a couple fingers of Firewhisky. He turned, one glass in his hand, stretched out in offering to Harry.
Hermione was wrong, surely. Teddy’s instincts were not playing any part in this, no matter what her theories led her to believe.
Harry breathed out heavily through his nose, glaring down at Ginny before reluctantly nodding his head.
Teddy sniffed, offering a shaky smile as wet eyes stared up at Malfoy. Harry couldn’t move, standing in the entryway, watching the two from a distance.
Harry bit his lip so sharply he could taste copper as blood began to spread across his tongue.

Lonesome.
You can’t stop it.
The three of them began playing, laughing at each other’s antics and competitive natures. Teddy nearly screamed ‘
Harry’s lips twitched and he shook his head before tearing his toasty in two, dipping one half into his soup and lifting it to his mouth. Chewing his rather overabundant mouthful of toasty, Harry looked up to catch Malfoy’s gaze. The man was staring at him, eyes narrowed and focused on Harry’s bulging cheeks.
“I don’t know, that’s why I
“Mm, yes...well,” a rosy blush began to spread across his cheeks, “I certainly couldn’t say no when Teddy was so badly injured, now, could I?”
can I go to the camp?”
Harry hesitated, biting sharply at his bottom lip. Andromeda had despised the feral Kneazle that he had rescued from the tree outside of her cottage earlier that year, despite Teddy’s clear love for the creature, and likely would not take kindly to Harry bringing Teddy home that evening with a new Kneazle.
Jesse was watching Harry speculatively, head tilted and eyes narrowed.
Draco stood stiffly, glaring at where the
perfecting something so common as a crumble. “Alright, then, Malfoy. Go on, show us what you’ve got.”
“You forget things, pet. We’ve talked about this.” He’s stalking towards you, a fire burning in his eyes—the twin flame to that which consumes you.
An anchor.
Teddy spun on his heels, stumbling slightly before he balanced himself, to look at Harry. “Harry, he’s going to come over! We’re going to have a
“We’ll give you two some space. I’ll see you later, Draco.” Harry waved a hand as he turned, refusing to meet Draco’s eyes as he and Ron made their way to the outskirts of the pitch.
