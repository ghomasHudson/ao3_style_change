Harry had gone to bed with a terrible headache, the kind that pounds his entire head front to back, down his neck, behind his eyes. He knows why—he’d done nothing but stare at the case data and try to force a pattern to appear. When he finally fell asleep, he dreamt of looking at the data some more, and so he makes the unlikely choice Friday morning to take care of himself.
The shock, which stilled him momentarily in surprise, lets up, and his arms rise from where they hung stiffly beside him to trace down Jack’s from the shoulder to the wrists held against his own face, as if to confirm that he’s real.
Harry is standing in the door to the garden, his arms crossed, face stony. “I suppose Dromeda and I were just living in blissful ignorance inside, while you two try your best to break your necks.”
He sits up a little taller and takes his hands off his knee, a bit nervous about where this is going. He tugs his sleeve down his wrist subconsciously.
“Alright, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean it like that!” Harry says quickly. “I was just trying to empathise. You’ve worked hard the last couple of weeks, I don’t want you to feel like… like it was worthless. You’ve been loads of help.” His brows are wrinkled in such genuine concern for Draco’s understanding that he can’t stay mad. Especially not when he still looks so much paler than usual.
Hermione grimaces, pushes her curls back with her hands flat to her temples, while Ron looks down at the table. “There’s something I meant to tell you a week ago, but it was never the right time,” he says. “But I’m starting to think it’ll never be.”
“Phaidra, how’ve you been?” he asks.
Harry tries to flatten it down, without knowing just what he’s fixing. He hasn’t so much as looked in a mirror. “Well good, because it’s unavoidable.”
“It doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks, it’s what I think. I hate it.”
The call comes from across the house, at least a storey down from where Draco stands fixing himself up in the bathroom mirror, and it stills his hands where they sit on his collar.
Harry knows he’s been prompted to track the room—Draco’s eyeing him expectantly even as he comes away with a package of hobnobs—and he can’t back away from a challenge. So he does, closing his eyes and imagining that the natural magic coursing within him has expanded outwards and filled the interior of Draco’s home.
Is it too soon? another part of him questions. Is this new? Or old but unnamed? No, he hated him. At Hogwarts, he hated him, unquestionably. What he can’t be certain of is whether something else had exacerbated that hatred. It’s too soon for this, he thinks again. It takes everything in him to nod along, to act normal, and he thinks maybe he should have begun the Blaise Method tomorrow.
“Maybe I just
well-dressed… His hair maybe?”
Harry kisses him before he can protest that he must brush his teeth and gargle mouthwash four times first, and this makes the crushing feeling grow.
Both men survey the crowd; a mix of Ministry employees, old friends, professors, and old enemies, seeming to have the same thought.
“Coordinates,” Harry says vaguely, just before footsteps thump above them and both men snap their heads towards the ceiling.
His face is heating. Even in his own office, Draco has the upper hand, decently at ease with the door shut, in Harry’s private space. His gaze sits comfortably on Harry from his office chair and he knocks back his drink with a smirk.
concerns to trail fingertips up and down his chest.
“Merlin, am I glad to see you,” he groans, collapsing onto the couch and laying his head in Draco’s lap. “Have you been here long?”
He’s right—they’ve both grown and changed. Their social interactions just haven’t caught up. Talking to Jack had provided the extra bit of strength he needs to get the job done, so he calls goodbye to Jack as he leaves and jogs the path back to his place. He needs to use this momentum while he has it.
a bloody Death Eater.”
, he muses, feeling a hand on his knee, a shoulder against his temple.
“You don’t find this odd? How easily we just spent an evening together?”
“I remember it, too—I
my god, that explains so much,” Hermione gushes. “Such a rich magical history there, do you know Tamil is one of the longest-surviving classical languages? There’s a lot of spells with linguistic origins from Tamil wizarding—of course you know, you just read.” She blushes and sips her wine with focus.
“Full of secrets then, isn’t he? Always has been.”
“The potion takes a day to brew. We can start tomorrow.”
sorry.”
“If Malfoy cast it by wand, you’d be willing to touch that silverware, then?” He nods towards the evidence box, choosing to ignore the plain untruth of Murray’s retort.
“It’s okay, it’s rubbish. I’ll miss him.”
“Bad surprises are just unwanted change. I hate unwanted change.”
Draco reaches out and curls Harry’s finger back around the chain. “It’s yours. And you don’t have to thank me, I wanted to. But if you fancied giving me permission to write it up for my book. With all parties anonymous, of course…”
“I’m not convinced Draco Malfoy is worth this much psychoanalysis,” says Ron through a mouthful of food.
Her eyebrows draw close and she bites her lip. Ron interjects, “Well, I think everything we know about Malfoy implies ignorance. The ‘It’s a date’ comment didn’t seem like you just ‘being the closest punching bag’. Sounds personal. Sounds like a git.”
“Erm, no,” he replies daftly, “I just got off work.”
“Er, you’re Indian.”
He’s staring at Harry like he’s seen a Dementor, mouth slack and pale face especially ashen. Part of him had thought, or hoped, that he would look worse for wear—untidy or unshaven or tired as if he’d been restless since the kiss like Harry had been—but besides his expression, he looks aggravatingly good.
“You have me,” Draco nods, eyes full. He means every word. “You have me.”
He smiles patiently. “I’ve worked here twenty years, Mr Potter. My father for sixty years before me. The Potters have been long gone but we are grateful for what they left behind. Of course, you are an important figure, Mr Potter, but in New Delhi, we are equally grateful for your ancestors.”
His father had told him Blaise wouldn’t be attending the Cup, spliced somewhere into a rant about old wizarding families not doing their part. Blaise doesn’t need to know that, and because his avoidance tactic clearly isn’t working anyway, he takes advantage of the guess and hopes it passes as genuine.
“Where’s Mummy?”
“Madam.
It’s muscle memory, perhaps, but this is the exact position Draco would take up daily when he discussed his research progress with Flitwick during his mastery, which is probably why the professor easily mirrored his actions by resuming his position at his own desk.
Ron cocks an eyebrow, leaning forward from Pansy’s other shoulder. “Didn’t you do a divorce settlement last month? What kind of lawyer

“Er, yeah. Good to stand out,” he mumbles.
“Yes. I forgot.”
smart,” Harry offers teasingly.
“…Gross, Harry’s like your brother!”
Draco nods silently.
He slips in and a familiar head of white hair immediately catches his attention. His back is to the entrance, sitting in the corner, and Harry orders still unnoticed as he watches the man take a sip from his cup, a small book held open between the splayed fingers of his right hand.
Draco arrives at Harry’s early with breakfast from Spoonfuls and they eat hastily at the table as the sun cracks the horizon, buzzing with sleepy but excited energy. They both have their hands on the Portkey three minutes early, and when it finally transports them at seven sharp, Harry stomachs the nastiness of the voyage to find himself spit out into a travel hub near the Muggle parliament.
In a flurry, Draco’s gone from sitting comfortably close to Harry to being utterly frozen out, sent from the room like a child to fly aimlessly around with one. Children, he remembers quickly outside, are perceptive and brazen.
“Ah, touché,” Draco smiles and nods.
His fingers play with the edge of the file unconsciously as he stares out the dark window, imagining what his fifth-year self would think seeing him sitting here today. He’d likely find it exciting that he’s an Auror, less exciting that Ron’s office is on the complete other end of the department, and blasphemous that Draco Malfoy’s name is typed under ‘
“You alright?” Potter gallantly ignores him.
Harry calls from just outside the door. “Are you okay?”
“You’re having me on.”
“I think our words, even if we believed them, didn’t have to be so harsh,” Draco counters. “Honesty without kindness is cruelty… or so they say.”
Murray. Harry barely breathes a goodbye to Tim, wills the lift to move double-time, and moves past Yolanda upstairs without so much as a word. He knocks but enters without waiting.
Harry opens his mouth to banter back when a sharp knock sounds on the door. They both snap their heads towards the sound, Harry with curiosity, Draco a bit more paralyzed.
Pansy sits back down in the reading chair and motions to the antique chair at Draco’s desk for Harry. The gesture leaves him feeling territorial, discomfited that someone should invite him into the study he’d come to feel was his own.
“He seems to like a lot of different genres, from what we’ve talked about. I appreciate a diverse portfolio…” She crouches low, picks through some thin spines with nimble fingers. “
“Shit,” he says, stopping suddenly in his tracks on the stoop. Quickly, he conjures his Patronus and sends it to Malfoy with an update, hoping he’s properly conveyed the urgency.
“Draco!” she screeches, immediately enveloping him in a tight hug.
*****
He’s still lingering on that strange frown when he arrives at Hermione’s. He’d run straight to work, his Auror robes pulled wrinkled from his knapsack and thrown hastily over exercise clothes to retrieve the rest of his case notes before Murray or Lucrezia can request them. By the time he stands at Hermione’s door, then, he’s properly grumpy, but she looks excited to see him, and for this alone he smiles back—this and the fact that she took an entire half-day off work for him and has read multiple books about mid-nineteenth century immigration.
“How about you think about it? Just think about it, for me.” Ron stands again. “I’ve gotta stop by Diagon and get some book on magical traces in toddlers that ‘Mione found out about. You’re welcome to join. I’ll treat you to lunch?”
They eat quietly, staring out over the woods. A small rowboat is moving like a pinprick in the river, heading towards a little brush-covered island in the centre of the open lake, and he follows it with his eyes. Draco’s right, it does feel quietly magical out here.
that feels like a lifetime ago. He calculates his options, then turns and speaks quietly.
day.”
too often at chess in the teacher’s lounge. I believe Minerva would suffice.”
“And you’re fine right now?”
After a long, searching look Malfoy nods, his lips pressed thin. This time two sets of echoing footsteps move towards the exit. The second set is slower than his and he doesn’t need to look behind to know Malfoy’s gait has slowed to a faux-confident saunter.
He takes them and lets her pull him to where she sits at the foot of the bed. “Ma pupuce,” he whispers. “C’est pas si simple.”
on the list,” Pansy speaks up, smiling beautifully and rubbing his back. “If it’s the last thing I do. He’s put loads of work in.”
“It sounds a lot more serious than you mentioned before.”
Harry scoffs as though personally offended, an endearingly empathetic response that sends Draco’s heart fluttering.
Pansy stands in front of the India photos for a while in a contemplative stance like she’s in a museum, then announces that she loves them. Multiple times while sitting on his couch, she glances back there again.
He’s just about to tell Powell to contact the Ministry curse breakers when the bell tinkles again, a half moment before Harry feels firm hands push him aside. It’s not hostile, but focused.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Didn’t take you for a cat person.”
“Ah, well then, we finally meet. It’s inspiring to see someone with such a dark past convincing people he’s a good man.”
“I think so?” Harry shrugs. “I haven’t thought about it much again, besides that it’s made Fridays exceptionally awkward.”
“It feels wrong,” says Potter. “Reckon we should fight?”
Hermione rolls her eyes. “Rasmus Neo’s music is just a guilty pleasure, anyway.”
“You should see Harry in our weekly meetings,” Ron is saying. “He’s gonna test Murray enough to pop his head off one of these days.”
But Narcissa replies, “I hear you’re involved?” and Draco’s blood runs cold.
Draco’s feeling a tad abandoned, so he channels the energy into making them both tea and turns the radio on while the kettle heats, because that’s something Harry does, and he hasn’t stopped endeavouring to try things as Harry does them. He sidesteps the top hits for easy listening and hunts out some digestives, steeps the tea, and is just plating it all on some saucers when he hears footsteps. He stops nodding his head to the music instantly.

“Cripes!” Harry supplies, recovering.
Harry glances back at him with an unreadable look, something between irritation and curiousness.
He waves the paper. “No more repenting, no more perfection, just this, just us. Messy. Letting ourselves be as we wish because… the sun will keep moving either way, the birds will still migrate, the rivers will still run. Right?”
Thanks for reading!
tailor forgot the bottom five inches of your own shorts.”
He sets the bowl down, crouches, and uses his free hand to gently part Leonard’s lips, slipping the spoon in. He waits a moment, then removes it and steps back. They all watch with bated breath as the man first squeezes his eyes shut, then opens them with a noticeably more peaceful expression. Slowly, he begins to rotate. Virginia lets out a soft, sad laugh in relief behind them.
Harry wakes up, like you often do on vacation, confused by his surroundings. After a moment, it sets in—first with the view out the balcony that he’s still facing, then with the sound of running water in the bathroom, reminding him that he’s not alone.
She bobs her head with a smile. “Consider it forgotten.”
With a sudden searing pain, he’s stunned at the feet. He yelps, trying to catch his footing even as he feels the binding spell hit with a second sharp burn, enclosing his wrists tightly behind him. He catches his fall on the shoulder and rolls quickly, stumbling to his feet and moving so his back is safely to the wall.
“C’mon,” he says, nudging Draco’s shoulder. “Break the habitus. Be
He slams the box of evidence onto the desk, his good mood vanished instantly. It’s one thing for Harry to need time, and quite another to have him vocally shut down anything that could even imply Draco’s sexuality.
“Erm, perhaps a daft inquiry, but could it have fit in the multiple owls you’ve sent me?”
Slowly, but unquestionably, Draco inserts his hand in Harry’s.
“But you always cook to the radio. Don’t stop on my account.”
As fun as it is to watch him ramble, Draco saves him. “I get it. It’s entertaining that I don’t know muggle vernacular, you don’t like gay jokes, and I can pull.”
“I haven’t thought of it like that,” he says.
“Ce n’est pas la mer à boire,” she murmured, reaching her hands out for his.
“The case evidence?” he tries. “It’s been removed?”
“They were trying to stoke our
They stay like that for a while, Draco happily rowing in the quiet, and they both point to wildlife as they see it; an egret seeking lunch, crabs scuttling, and enormous, intricate spider webs they duck under. The best comes when Harry leans suddenly forward, stopping the oars with a hand and pointing to a little grey snake in the watery roots.
“Oh,” says Ron softly. “Oh. I see.” He clears his throat and sits up completely, so Harry does too. “I, er. I’m sure we’ll spend more time with him. And then it’ll—I’ll start to… I’m happy if you’re happy. The man you’re describing… sounds alright.”
“Quite right… Do you think your gran noticed?”
“That cabin is ours forever?” he mumbles.
“Please let me come in? Be a goose?”
She tilts her head, tongue in her cheek, and nods in disbelief.
“Fine, I suppose.”
Unfortunately for him, it’ll be a while before the shop is cleared. Especially with a seemingly random curse involved. He realises that Malfoy has been standing courteously, nudging some of the fallen books and papers with his foot distractedly, and turns to him.
“But her dad was friends with my dad,” Ron murmurs, distant and half-listening. “Why would she try to kill you? She’s so nice.”
It’s a fast switch. Warm hands sneaking under his own jumper, and he seeks out lips that have
“Youngest Malfoy! Kreacher is pleased for you to be here. Mistress would be honoured for Narcissa Black’s son to be entering her home—“
It doesn’t help that his own research beckons enticingly when he sits down to work. Initially, he avoided it rather well, despite the momentum he’d had working through a new counter-curse before the banquet. But when the case files inevitably leave him too frustrated to focus, he turns his attention back to his cursed objects—just for a few hours, to remember what productivity feels like.
“The ‘department’s opinion’, you mean your opinion. It’s an
To his surprise, Draco had thrown down the paper, lips creeping up in excitement. “Have her over. Have her over when Pansy’s here.”
going to agree to that.”
The smile that’s been bubbling up breaks through and he meets Blaise’s eyes fully beaming. He’s still in awe that his friend has kept this to himself, on the off-chance Draco didn’t want it discussed. And on top of that, he has no doubts that Pansy will now do the same. He feels the same intense love he did when they visited him at the manor, or pulled him into the hug he hadn’t known he needed after the gala.
He sits up, takes his glasses from the bedside table and puts them on, squinting in the morning light. Draco walks in with the carelessness of someone who thinks they’re the only one up, and stops with his toothbrush in the side of his mouth like a cigar.
He bends Draco’s arm and folds it to his own chest, to the thin fabric over a scar that Harry left once, long ago.
In the kitchen, he swoops elegantly around the space, closing low cabinets with his heel, cutting the chicken and adding it with the pop of oil to a skillet. The knife moves with speed and precision in his hand, and Draco moves closer to stand with his elbows on the counter, watching from the dining side of the divider. He reaches over for a jar of paprika.
He doesn’t argue against the adage. She’d long ago turned the man into an epithet, like the hero of his own Greek tragedy.
“They’ll know you came. Don’t be daft.”
He’d been quick to fight back, and over a month ago he’d promised not to do that anymore. They do well, get along, if the serious points of conversation are avoided often enough. Though there’s certainly a difference between riling Harry up unprompted and responding to an offence he’s taken, by the time he knocks on Draco’s door the following morning, the fact that he’s shown up at all feels like an apology he needs to match.
She folds her arms, leaning in a bit, although in the general noise of the party, their conversation is decently masked already. “How is the case coming? I heard there was trouble with the curse specialist.”

Ron makes a noncommittal noise. “Yeah, but… you’ve never really cared about that, have you? You never talk about your identity; you haven’t
He shakes his head. “Nowhere, just the case. Sorry.”
Harry can’t help but smile back.
“From
Unlike many New Delhi structures that they’d seen, the temple is not Muggle or wizard but a relic from when the two existed in conjunction. He squints up to its peak. Standing in its ancient, towering presence leaves him feeling like a blip in time.
He shakes his head solemnly, speaking quiet despite the privacy of the garden, and fills him in on everything not in the reports; that the items at reception were cursed during work hours, almost definitely on the Auror floor, and by someone who could’ve moved about the office without casting suspicion.
“Something… helpful. Proof. That Murray’s doing this. The evidence… in his office or… somewhere else,” he stammers out.

“It must have gotten terribly dull, stuck back with paperwork after that dry spell.”
Right above the stacks, a man is hovering pin-straight—eerily straight—with his feet towards the ceiling and his arms stuck to his sides. His face is a deep purple-red, his eyes impossibly wide. Powell stands two feet from him, arms out defensively to hold back the man’s frantic wife.
program, Blaise Zabini! I was doing my job. You went on three dates and stood her up on the fourth! Who stands someone up on a fourth date?!”
“Teddy,” Draco just has to say and he nods.
Harry frowned good-naturedly. “I’m sorry, are you coaching me?”
But then again—what if he
“It’s nothing.” Draco works hard to manage his voice, to keep it casual despite his growing panic, and to not look right at Harry as he says it. “She’s nothing at all. My mum shouldn’t have written.”
For the love of Circe. Harry would be happy if he never heard about Simon again. It’s not as though he’d done Harry wrong in any way. He’d simply been so early, so inconsequential in his life and romantic history that he’d just about forgotten about him completely until Hermione mentioned his name.
“Terrific!” Murray claps him a bit hard on the shoulder and turns to leave. He looks back at Harry. “And no congratulations, Potter?”
“I guess being in Sirius’ bedroom again just… I’ve gotten such piecemeal extracts of what they were all like, and I suppose I hope she can… flesh it out. Him and Remus, I—sometimes I wonder when I’ll miss them less.”
Harry quirks an eyebrow, wondering just
“I wasn’t trying to
“I’m fine.”
But the sound of his contentedness clears his mind enough to send his heart beating in a panic yet again. Like he’s come from a trance, he lifts his head slightly and Harry’s hand comes with it.
your new best—“
Harry appears at Draco’s door with a duffel bag slung over his shoulder and a thick coat on, knocks and grins with butterflies more suitable for a first date when the blond-haired man answers.
Applause from behind Harry signals that Kingsley Shacklebolt has walked on stage, ready to introduce him, and he stiffens a bit. His heartbeat rings loudly, and he’s distracted only momentarily by Professor McGonagall’s friendly touch of his shoulder as she moves past to find her seat.
Harry leans in and kisses him, much more confidently than Draco had at the pub, firm and assertive, and he succumbs to it with an indefinable relief. His hands, seeking their role, creep to the sides of Harry’s face, too, his thumbs framing his cheeks.
. There was something quaint, if not a bit alien, about Potter’s tendency towards muggle turns of phrase. Fitting, he thinks, taking in his surroundings and how hastily Potter had stowed his wand with a furtive glance around.
This one he asks aloud, and Ginny gives him a pitying look.
Without knowing what’s come over him, Draco pushes his chair out and walks back to the study, crouching in front of his Muggle books shelf and picking out a few without thinking, letting the decision be instinctual, and sets them on top of Harry’s folded coat on the table by the door. It’s more a marker of trust than Harry would know—
Draco wouldn’t know this, but the Pixies song in Harry's iPod was "Here Comes Your Man." I didn't mean for too much symbolism there, they just have about two songs you can run to. Although personally I imagine Harry’s the kind of inhuman runner who could put on spoken word poetry and not find it affect his exercise.
Draco nods, satisfied to buy even a moment more to talk if Harry’s willing to respond.
He does love it inside, just as Harry expected. He’s read every book on the display table, all the local literary legends, but lingers there for a while anyway, just to point certain books out to Harry and page through copies.
Draco closes his eyes, but when he closes them he sees Harry curled on the rug, so he opens them again.
He’d never known so many muscle groups were necessary for a punch, but when Harry listens to his questions and answers through example, the bag moves with an impressive crack, and Harry’s body had moved so succinctly and naturally through the punch that it seems lifeless to hit any other way. So Draco moves slowly and follows his steps; Ankle. Hips. Waist. Shoulder. Wrist. Harry’s patient, letting him learn the way it feels, and as he adds speed, he feels the change in the way the bag shoots away from his hand.
“And you have time for this when in addition to completely refurbishing Grimmauld Place?” Hermione says practically, the queen of over-exerting.
‘UNCA DACO!’ He was assaulted by yet another flaming redhead who clambered over him with no care for her sibling currently being supported by his arm.
“It’s ok, just don’t move.” He held his hand up, palm facing her. The bottle reformed with a gentle wave of his wand, the droplets of dittany merging and pouring back into the tinted glass. When he was satisfied that he wouldn’t pierce the soles of his bare feet with shards of glass, he went to her, taking her hand for stability and dabbing the dittany onto her skin himself. He was halfway up her arm before he noticed that she was standing unnaturally still.
But never in Harry’s wildest dreams had he ever imagined the total obsession that would occur from Draco’s discovery of hummus. It was like setting a caged animal free for the first time.
? Is this all a game to you? Play with my feelings and then what, rob me for all I’m worth? Sell me out? I’m really fucking curious because you can’t possibly have just forgotten about this, Mr
“Please be careful. If you come back dead, I’ll bring you back to life just so I can kill you in a far more brutal and prolonged way.” The stone-cold seriousness in her tone and the blank expression on her face had him genuinely worried she might.
‘The thing is, that ever since the war, I’ve had this really bad anxiety. Sometimes I can’t leave the house and some days I can’t get out of bed. I forget to eat, and I can’t always sleep and sometimes there really isn’t any good reason why. Before you start shouting at me, I didn’t tell you because you were struggling with your nightmares and your excess magic and I felt so awful dumping all my problems on you too.’
“It’s a type of tree. They’re white like he is – people say they look like they’re covered in snow.”
‘It’s ok. You couldn’t have known things would happen the way they did.’ He knew Harry was right, but it didn’t mean it was easy. ‘How do you feel?’ His green eyes were boring into Draco’s with a mix of sympathy and unconcealable hopefulness and Draco’s stomach twisted uncomfortably. He had a sudden brainwave and scrabbled to pull the sleeve of his shirt back to see if his dark mark was still there and his heart plummeted when it was. Except, whilst the mark was as black and nasty, there were no longer any horrible veins underneath it.
‘Well, you see, you know that letter you got from Gringotts? The one that told you about the estate?’ He frowned.
He did his best not to react too much, in case she shut him back out again. Instead, he followed her over to the far corner where her small bookshelf was the only item of furniture in the room untouched.
‘Harry?’
‘And it’s called a…CRB check? Can I even pass one of those? I have a wizarding criminal record…’ Draco wasn’t sure about this. What kind of teaching would he need to do? All the children were going to muggle primary school anyway.
“Shut up, I’m looking after you.” He wanted to laugh; the concept of being looked after by Malfoy was ludicrous, and her bedside manner atrocious, but it also felt kind of nice. He let his eyes close as he concentrated on not throwing up all over his living room floor.
Aspen bit him rather hard. Harry yelped but refused to let go of the fox. He marched resolutely through the front door and turned left down the street. He and Ron lived quite close to Grimmauld Place, so it was easier for him to walk with Aspen than to distress him further with magical travel.
‘I’m scared for you. I know they said the chances of you recovering were slim to none, but you seemed so determined when you came home, and nothing is changing. It’s hard to come home and see you being a shell of the person you were, and it’s not just because of the magic. You know I love you if you can do magic or not. You just look so…defeated. I’ve never even seen you try to cast any of the spells you’re supposed to be trying and if I don’t remember your potions half the time you don’t either. It’s too much.’
He got his wish when Ponytail appeared in the doorway Granger had just left. Ponytail hadn’t appeared since dumping Draco in his cell, or at least Draco hadn’t seen him. He had been sleeping so much of the time it was likely he’d missed a lot.
‘Right, well, there’s nothing for it.’ He whipped the covers off and shivered violently at the contrast of the cold air. He flung his pyjamas in the general direction of the laundry basket and sauntered off to the bathroom stark bollock naked. Harry let out an undignified squawk and Draco winked at him over his shoulder. His flirtation dropped as soon as he was in the bathroom. He was not going to spend the morning wallowing, today was a happy day. He’d missed Teddy terribly and he’d get to see him again after months and months and he even got to tell him the news that his family was reunited. Nothing to worry about.
What Draco had failed to remember was, that occasionally if one was to apparate close to the end of the dosage of a potion, such as Polyjuice, it could sometimes trigger a reaction. So, when he and Harry landed in the office, Draco was no longer accompanying the smarmy git from HR, but the heroic git that is Harry Potter. Without thinking about it twice, which with hindsight is what Draco really should’ve done, he grabbed Harry by the collar, shoved him against his office wall, and kissed him.
‘Do you mind if I…’ Teddy flushed and looked down at his wrinkled pyjamas and tried to smooth them out a little. Draco was struck with how much the mannerism reminded him of himself. Harry huffed, disgruntled by the effort he’d have to make to move, but he rolled over and pulled the covers aside anyway. He always wore full pyjamas on Christmas Eve since Teddy often came into their room on Christmas morning. A couple of years ago, when he was nine, he’d cried because he thought he was getting too old and it wasn’t normal, but Draco had reassured him that there was no such thing as normal and he could keep up the tradition as long as he wanted. He knew it would end eventually, but Teddy didn’t.
Granger was convinced that their spell had worked, even though Draco’s faith had faded what seemed like forever ago. Most of the irregular messages he received urged him to keep trying to find the link between himself and Potter. Draco didn’t have the heart to tell her that his magic was slowly fading; at least, the minimal amount he had ever been able to produce wandlessly. Of course, it could be more to do with the magic dampening within the prison than anything else, but he had a feeling the weakness in his bones he’d never quite recovered from after his fever had something significant to do with it.
‘We can deal with that later. Now I need to rest.’ He turned to the bed – probably the largest bed he’d ever seen in his life, and noticed the sheets were his favourite shade of forest green. His pyjamas were already folded neatly at the foot of the bed, but he moved them away. Harry noticed the action but didn’t say a word. Draco took Harry’s coat from him and hung it next to his carefully, before stripping out of the clothes that had already absorbed some of the chill. He didn’t know why, but it seemed important for him to do this. It wasn’t as if Harry had never seen him naked before, of course he had, but it felt as though it were a watershed moment where Draco could consciously bare all to him both physically and emotionally. He felt Harry’s eyes on him as each garment was removed – he felt his gaze burning into his skin and it sent shivers down his spine at the odd intimacy of the situation.
‘Draco this place is beautiful. I had no idea you had such an eye for interior design.’ Harry walked the corridors with his mouth gaping like a fish and his eyes wide like he’d never seen class before.
‘You’ve seen your father here too?’ She asked him, seeming surprised.
They were in the middle of bacon and scrambled egg on toast when there was a knock at the front door. No one every knocked on the door of Draco’s flat, since most of his friends were wizards who could apparate or use the floo. He cast a muffilato on his feet and motioned for Teddy to stay quiet. He peaked through the small peep hole in the door and was surprised to see Hermione standing there.
‘Maybe you should keep this until you figure out what it is that you want.’ He brushed past him, abandoning his idea of going to hide in his flat, but wanting to be as far away from Harry as possible. Harry’s caught his wrist in a grip so tight it made Draco’s bones pop.
“I was until you showed up and disturbed me,” he said petulantly, but he didn’t mean it. They didn’t say anything for a few minutes; just sat together and looked out over the lake towards the castle. The sun wasn’t as fierce as it had been when Harry first came out and he realised Draco had chosen this time specifically because it would be easier on his pale complexion.
‘Well, your mental faculties appear to be intact, that’s one to check off my list.’ He said pleasantly, and Draco was glad he got a healer that dealt with trauma the same way Draco did – horrendously sarcastic humour.
‘TED!’ Draco said a lot more brightly than usual.
‘I always thought you’d want to bury your mother in France.’
“I didn’t
“You too mate?” Harry asked as if he could talk back. He scratched between Aspen’s ears the way he likes, and the fox’s eyes drooped again. He shoved his nose under Harry’s chin and tried to go back to sleep and Harry was about to let him when there was a pounding on the front door. Harry knew full well Aspen wasn’t asleep, but he refused to budge so Harry had no choice but to go to the door with the fox held against his chest like a newborn.
‘You do?’
But then the ground began to shake. The beam of light flickered and faded, and Draco’s hopes went out with it. Dust fell from above them, and Draco grabbed hold of Granger as she wobbled and almost fell.
“Damnit, Hermione!”
“I just feel like I should be doing something, you know?” Draco interrupted as Pansy moved on to talk about Theo’s new position as a teaching assistant at Hogwarts. “This is Potter. Surely if they could find him, they’d have done it by now? They must have every resource available looking for him…” Pansy sighed into her coffee, frustrated he had interrupted her mid-flow, placing her cup delicately back down before responding.
‘There are silencing charms built into the wood. I did them myself so I wouldn’t disrupt the kids if I was working late.’ He nodded. ‘What is it Draco? I can see something has been bothering you.’
‘Since when did you start using the front door?’ Draco asked. Hermione rolled her eyes like it was the most obvious thing in the world.
‘Right. Thanks.’ He felt rather sheepish although he wasn’t altogether sure why.
‘Good. Remember what we talked about?’ Harry asked him. Teddy nodded.
‘You little shit,’ he snapped. Harry just grinned at him.
“Lord Malfoy, you are under arrest on the charge of kidnap of one Harry James Potter, Order of Merlin First Class.” Quite what Potter’s Order of Merlin had to do with it was beyond Draco. Time seemed to slow as the rope flowed from the Hit Wizard’s wand to bind Draco’s hands. In the same slow, muggy sort of way Draco looked to Pansy and absently registered the shock on her face turn to outrage. He was unsurprised how unfeeling he was; he should be outraged too and yet he couldn't bring himself to feel anything.
‘Draco, darling, please tell me what’s going on. Are you sick?’ Draco couldn’t handle Harry worrying about him, he felt like a cavernous pit of guilt and despair opened up inside him.
‘Draco what was that?’
He turned over yet again – it was harder for him to fall back to sleep once his eyes had adjusted to the dark. Well, as much as they could without his correction charms. It was a wonder no one had noticed his distinct lack of vision, although during fifth and sixth year when he could no longer afford to keep the charms renewed, he’d learned quite well how to mask his poor vision. His sight wasn’t so bad that he couldn’t see Harry’s face resting on the pillow next to his. He’d taken to staring at Harry in his sleep a lot recently, since his sleep cycle was so disturbed.
‘Really? Yes!’ She was practically jumping up and down on the spot. Draco stood and held a hand out to her.
‘Morning, Helen. I do hope you’re well.’ He hadn’t been to the orphanage for a week or so, having had a bad turn which drained him more than usual.
‘Woah, Teddy. What’s going on?’ Draco was not equipped to deal with an emotional child, this was always Harry’s thing. Draco prised Teddy’s arms off him and took him through to the living room. Back when Draco had lived with Harry, the kitchen had always been the hub of the house, where all the important conversations happened. Draco had never even seen Andromeda’s kitchen.
Harry shakes his head. “But there’s almost certainly an accomplice if it’s him. No hawthorn and unicorn wands in the Auror department, and he certainly doesn’t have the skill level to build these curses, except for the Cassie one.”
When Draco wakes, the first thing he registers is the terrible knot in his lower back, right where it’d sunk into the arm of his reading chair overnight. He sits up groggily and yawns, contorting to massage a thumb on the sore muscles while the events of the previous evening come back to him: Quietly eating dinner, working on his counter-curse, failing at his counter-curse, crawling into bed, then a knock at the door and an endearingly plastered Harry grinning at him, and thinking
Draco tilts his head in interested surprise. “If you’d like.”
Ron nods. “Just picture everyone in their pants.”
Teddy kicks off the grass behind the house and begins flying low circles around Draco, who stands investigating the broom Harry keeps at the residence.
And the little voice must have been onto something because despite getting stupefied in the process, Draco spends the next few days feeling rather at peace, like he’s finally closed a chapter of his life that he falsely thought was closed long ago.
Her eyes tenderly hold his for a moment longer, then, voice warm, she says, “We love you, you know.”
“Ron, I’m just… we’ve got to work together on this. When he wakes, we’ll have a chat, and from the chat, we’ll gauge whether to mention the
The answer is relayed through a note handed over by Draco upon his return. He’d caught Orsix out front, and extends it to Harry in the reading chair between the index and middle fingers of an outstretched arm, shifting the heavy cauldron on his hip.
“All of school it was ‘Why wouldn’t Potter shake my hand?’” Pansy puts on a whiny voice, “And ‘Potter keeps winning Quidditch games, what’s his training regimen?’ and ‘Potter looks so fit in his Yule robes’—“
think this is personal? You’re not worried?”
*****
He twists the window latch and props it open. Orsix hops through with a resounding hoot, dropping the note onto the desk by the windowsill. Harry’s pulse quickens ridiculously considering he hasn’t even confirmed it’s a response from Malfoy. He feels it is in his gut though, and pulls his jeans up quickly, flicking the wet hair out of his eye with a flip of his head as he tears through the letter’s seal.
“The Dementors, they just… offer no clemency. No—just pain. I see it more in his eyes ever visit.”
,” she adds pointedly to Teddy, swatting his feet from the edge of the coffee table.
find that funny at all, obviously.” With that, he holds Draco’s eyes sternly, as if he’s being scolded. “I just mean it’s funny to hear you chat up anyone.
Draco rolls his eyes, but it’s not accompanied by a scowl, so it only fills Harry with careful interest. His eyes are bright, meeting Draco’s.
“You’re on!” Harry grins, scrambling for his broom as Teddy quickly does the same and they kick off.
“Yes, but the Harry I… knew… went zero times a week. You’ve always been lean, with Quidditch and all. It’s not as though you look like a bodybuilder. It’s just interesting to see you… toned and lean.”
can have us over.”
Fair warning to enjoy this time with Draco, we'll be cosying up to Harry for a few chapters...
Potter smiles again, his soft, genuine one. “Man after my own heart.”
Narcissa smiles fully, cheek to cheek, drawing her long face into something softer. “Good, dear. Wonderful.”
“I appreciate you… cleaning I think?” His gaze drifts to the feather duster in his small hand. “But you can go back to Hogwarts for the day, we need the house.”
“Behind,” Harry finishes. “In India.”

“When are you going in?” he asks while he crawls back in beside him. Harry reaches for the second cup of coffee and toast that Draco had left under a warming charm and raises them both above his head when Draco helpfully pulls the blankets over his lap for him. He grants him a full-mouthed smile, chewing with his arms still raised, then swallows.
“I’m going to shower, but don’t go.”
“It’s about the case,” he says as he sits opposite him.
Harry freezes. Turns. “A

at Harry, for doing this to him—making him seem… worrisome, forcing him into being helpful. The man in question, who Draco hoped would look like he’d put the fear of Godric in him, is instead considering him like he’s properly answered a riddle.
“I could get used to this,” says Harry after a bit, kicking Draco a little as he stretches far to set his plate and mug down. “Your bed is nice.”
They travel to a small intramural Quidditch pitch hidden by charms and find a couple other groups of flyers already playing on the field. Harry’s just brought a Snitch, though, and it’ll be easy to fly without needing the goalposts they’re practising around.
you’re unpracticed because it means your friends haven’t been in peril lately.”
“Thai?” he asks.
“Now we have damage control to do,” she chides, no animosity behind her words.
“Draco’s so old-fashioned!” Harry interrupts loudly with a funny-sounding laugh. “Enjoys not being tied to his cell, I’m always teasing him about it. I’ll grab mine.”
“Erm, depends on the account. Two or three years.”
“Look what you’ve done to me,” he murmurs, eyes fierce and accompanied by a mischievous pout.
“No,” he says, slowly standing to join him. “What’s it mean?”
But despite his best efforts, Harry notices something off about him. His glances linger just a little too long when he looks up, and after a while he turns and sits up off his stomach, facing Draco with a tilted head. “Are you doing alright?”
Harry doesn’t understand why it has to be one or the other, but he feels beat, exhausted, embarrassed, so he just mutters, “We’re fine.”
“Well, then I’m coming with you. Let me do the tracing. And make you breakfast first. You didn’t eat yesterday.”
Jack shrugs as if it’s the simplest problem ever. “You care about making things right. You’re a good person,” he says.
“Thanks,” he replies quietly.
In the end, he only takes one. Draco selfishly hopes it’s a ploy to come back—he’s annoying yet fascinating. And it would be nice, perhaps, to have company beside Pansy and Blaise now and again. He walks Harry to the fireplace, pressing a pack of gingersnaps into his hand as he approaches the hearth.
“Be the first time. If it was true. But—“
“There’s no one to tell. Would
he thinks.
Harry usually manages to overtake his friend and get on top, but seeing Draco’s severely playful grey eyes looking up, he’s more than once embarrassed himself into enough distraction to be swept with the very moves he’d taught, and within a breath he’d be flat on his back, head cracked against the lightly padded floor, and he’d laugh in pain. Draco, too, flooded with adrenaline and success, would laugh down at him.
She winks. “Good. Dinner was immaculate. Always good to see you, Harry.” And then she’s gone.

“Wow,” Harry pants, collapsing beside him. He leans over and plants a lazy kiss on Draco’s cheek. “Today ended much better than expected.”
“We can call.”
“No, yes—you could call it that. Er, something that makes me happy. And well, I’ve realised that wizards are a bit reliant on… well, wizardry. So I’m opening a gym. There will be duelling, but there’ll also be hand-to-hand combat, physical self-defence. It sounds stupider than it’ll be, I swear.”
Draco’s face had slowly dropped slack in surprise, then upwards into excitement as he spoke, and now he comes forward and takes Harry’s hands. “You thought of the
He wishes this made it any easier to accept a deep green jumper with a D on it from Molly—hand-knitted. He pulls it on over his shirt when he watches Harry do the same. Hermione and Ron’s gift leaves him speechless long enough for Ron to begin looking concerned and ask Hermione if it was too far.
Harry sighs down at the table, then blinks in surprise when a glass of something appears in his line of sight. He hadn’t even seen Ron go to the bar, but he’d returned now with mead for the group.
Draco shakes his head. “I don’t know, however long it takes her curse specialist to double-check my work.”
“As much as I can for now, I guess,” Harry says. “But it’s—I’ve—I can picture my great-grandparents now, and their grandparents, and what life was like even before England. In their shop in Delhi, their home there. I never knew about Delhi. I must have family—the daughter stayed. I don’t have names, but it’s enough to know
“You were so right, go ahead and say ‘I told you so’.”
“Harry, Harry. Did you ever think you’d see the day that Ron left?”
! You’re just Harry!”
“But that won’t do you much good now. Something to keep in mind, though, listeners. As for you and your man, I’d think like this; do you feel that the fight, though it ended your relationship, was an outlier or a pattern? Starting as a friendship, maybe you’ve skipped the honeymoon phase directly into the challenging part of figuring out how your partnership fits into each other’s existing lives, how you communicate the difficult things.”
“You can slow down; I’m not going anywhere.”
“I was saying, you should take all these home for a fortnight, look through them,” she says, staring firmly to get him to meet her eyes. He glues his to the book, where it’s safest.
As ignorant as it seems, Draco’s forgotten that those not trained in the Dark Arts are less prepared to come against them. Like a swelling tide, it hits him at once; Harry Potter, sixteen just like him, and while he’s being torn apart by a mission to kill Dumbledore, Harry’s discovering horcruxes, coping with a prophecy foreseeing either his untimely death or that of Voldemort. All just six years since he’d first heard he could be a wizard.
His hands pull at the skin under his eyes, then over his cheekbones, investigating his appearance in the reflection. His dress robes hang waiting on the door and Pansy lounges quietly in the next room.
“First Pansy, then me. You really tried to complete the set, eh?”
Harry drops one of his hands and traces his thumb lightly over Draco’s lips, then shifts close until their mouths are just about touching.
“You’re not Harry.”
calm. Ish.”
He shrugs it off immediately.
—“ He swings his finger towards Ron, whose eyes widen in surprise. “Wipe the judgement off your face that poor Hermione is working overtime to temper, there’s a place for the three of you next time. Plus Draco and Harry.”
He jumps awake at the pounding sound on the other side of the flat. Harry’s awake, too, eyes wide in sleepy shock and fumbling for his glasses.
“Well, I don’t think any of us are surprised that you’re trying to see the best in people, Harry. I’m just surprised the Ministry agreed with you.”
This one's a doozy
“Shame.”
He thumps the pillows aggressively, ignoring him. With a flick of his wand, he moves the books from the bedroom to the piles already covering the study room floor, not looking up when Harry ducks quickly as they fly past his head.
“I did, actually. Luna told me. Wish you had though.”
It’s unsigned, but it needn’t be:

“I’m not telling you to
“Bollocks,” he’d said, but now he drops Jack a second time with a loud smack against the floor of the ring and, after analysing how quickly he’d reacted upon hitting the ground last time, Draco climbs on top faster and manages multiple decent hooks to Jack before he pivots his weight to flip Draco. Draco’s swift, and they both scramble up before either can overtake the other.
After a while he began to drift off to sleep when he was jolted back awake. Harry turned over to face him and he tried his best to keep his eyes open to look at him, but they were too heavy. His heart swelled when Harry’s thumb grazed his cheek gently.
‘I care about you and he is an important part of your life, is he not?’ Draco nodded.
Draco hoped that his presence in the department wouldn’t knock too main noses out of joint. He wasn’t about to apologise for being there, not when the Minister had requested him specifically, but he didn’t want to cause a stir when he was only there temporarily.
The air between them had changed. It was no longer thick with humidity, instead holding the promise of new territory. At first neither of them moved any closer, but they didn’t move away either.
Harry broke away first, his expression was worn and the bags under his eyes made Draco feel so guilty for waking him up. ‘Are you ok?’ His thumbs skimmed Draco’s cheekbones as he looked at him with concern. His lips were cherry red, and all Draco wanted to do was keep kissing him until he’d poured all his heart into him.
‘Better?’ Harry asked him, looking at him worriedly.
‘Should I have? I thought he was with you…’ Teddy frowned.
“Is something wrong?” He asked her, looking up at the fine blond curls dangling gracefully from her downturned faced.
‘Wait, Draco…stop. What’s going on?’ Harry said, grabbing hold of Draco’s wrists. Draco couldn’t event explain because he had no idea. He was fine before they left for the clinic, albeit a little reserved out of sheer nervousness at being alone with Harry in such a foreign context. He was fine whilst he was inside the clinic, he could focus on his charms and counter-curses. Yet seeing Harry’s face again when they landed broke something in Draco and he was feeling completely overwhelmed.
“Ok, so what do I do now?”
“What has Granger told you?”
And as glad as Harry was that he wouldn’t be needing to call the Ministry anytime soon, he couldn’t help but feel that wasn’t the answer he was looking for.
What did surprise him however, was that Teddy made a beeline for two small presents at the back of the tree that Draco hadn’t seen before and certainly hadn’t put there himself.
Harry pushed the door open and Draco’s heart sang when an old-fashioned brass bell tinkled above his head. Harry really knew how to spoil him. A tall man with dark hair that was greying slightly at his temples walked right over to him.
He was in his garden, sitting on the swing seat and watching Teddy tumble about on the lawn. He was already six and Draco couldn’t quite believe how quickly he was growing up, or how little balance he had, running around much like a toddler. Still, the knocks and falls didn’t seem to be bothering him at all. Draco had never been allowed to play like that in the manor gardens and he was determined that Teddy’s childhood would be the absolute of Draco’s own stuffy one. Children were supposed to be wild and have fun before the pressures and responsibilities of life caught up to them.
fell asleep when Harry put films on. He’d developed quite an interest in muggle film – his favourites were the old ones in black and white.
‘Aconite Violaceum Mr Malfoy.’ Kingsley prompted.
‘I can’t believe he’s gone to Hogwarts.’ Harry said disbelievingly.
‘I didn’t feel like I deserved you. Everywhere we went people would look at me that way, I know you know what I mean, and it didn’t matter that I knew they were wrong about me, I just knew that you could do way better than me and it wasn’t fair that you had to deal with that every time we tried to go somewhere just because of me.’ Draco refused to look anywhere near Harry throughout his little speech. He scrunched his eyes tight shut, even though the only view he had was of Harry’s bare shoulder. He felt completely exposed, and not just because of the copious skin on skin contact.
‘Draco, love, calm down. It’s ok – I think this is amazing. You really put everything into this didn’t you?’ Harry continued to flip through the messy pages each turn of the page punctuated by a pursed lip or a raised eyebrow. Eventually he looked up at Draco and he thought maybe he looked proud of him, although with Harry it was sometimes hard to tell.
His instincts told him this was now or never; he could not let this moment pass. He had always been told to trust his instincts, so he did, and he closed the small gap left between them.
How dare Potter have a life outside him? How dare he date someone else like he wasn’t absolutely heartbroken by their divorce? Draco paced back and forth across the small living room of his flat, trying to burn off his extra anger. He wished he could just let Potter go. He had him, he fucked it up, he lost him and he needed to move on.
Draco looks up at him with wide eyes and a trembling lip. It nearly breaks Harry’s heart.
‘Oliver? Why, have you seen him?’ Didn’t answer the question – strike one. Draco blinked himself back into the room.
He hoped Teddy wouldn’t be too annoyed with him. It was kind of his fault he’d ended up in hospital again, although he hadn’t known the effects would be as bad as they were. He wouldn’t have long with him this time, so he had to make it count. He was trying to think of what they could do together, the three of them, when the floo finally put an end to his misery.
Draco opened his mouth to pathetically blabber his way back out of his stumble when another healer opened the door. It wasn’t the same one that Draco had seen before, but Draco was secretly grateful. This one looked about fifty and had a completely grey beard and generally appeared like he actually knew what he was doing.
The wards emanate from the house itself where the magic is strongest. Up in the eaves it’s easiest for him to get at the basic structure of the Manor where centuries of magical enchantments are layered over themselves.
“Why didn’t you ask Weasley to do this? Wasn’t he Potter’s something valuable back in fourth year?” Draco has a vague memory of flame red hair bobbing up to the surface of the Great Lake.
He’d only restored one of the chateau’s towers since the other had been too damaged when the building had become derelict. Draco thought towers were pretentious anyway. So muggles learnt how to construct turrets and spires? Big deal. Wizards had been doing it a lot longer and didn’t need to keep at it. It meant there was one place in the grounds which would feel like home to Harry. That was, if Draco knew him well enough…
‘Ok, then what’s going on?’ Harry asked him. He was watching Draco intently with an expression full of concern and Draco wanted so much to hate him for accusing him of an addiction, for betraying his trust and for stealing from him, but he couldn’t because despite all that, he still loved him.
Harry heaved a sigh as he sat down on the sofa with Draco and pulled Draco’s legs onto his lap as if they’d been doing this every day for six years instead of having been divorced.
He was glad it was Molly and Arthur’s turn to host Christmas, although he had a hunch they’d have volunteered anyway considering the circumstances. The only houses in the family big enough to house everyone were Harry and Draco’s, The Burrow and George and Angelina’s new place in Eastbourne. Between their half-unpacked house and Draco’s current state of low energy, it was the only logical option. According to Harry, the whole Weasley clan had been very worried about him when they’d heard what had happened, although Draco didn’t feel like that excused all that had gone before.
When he is led down the long hallway towards the back of the house, he can’t help but notice the way Malfoy moves. It might be because Harry has rarely seen him in anything but long wizard robes, but he’s never noticed before how long and lean Malfoy’s legs are. It’s hard not to notice now that he’s wearing such tight trousers anyway – it’s a wonder he can move at all. Now that he’s looking closer, he realises that actually, Draco Malfoy is wearing
‘Sorry,’ he wheezed eventually. He sounded awful but at least he’d managed to say something.
‘Ugh. Fiiiiine. You’re such a bore these days Draco. You’re all work, work, work.’
There was nothing, there was just blackness. He felt like he was floating, but maybe underwater. He couldn’t see anything or hear anything. He tried moving an arm or a leg, wiggling a finger or a toe, but he wasn’t even sure he still had a body anymore.
‘It’s fine Harry.’ Draco said shortly. He’d brought the thickest blanket he could find in here with him – a deep grey cable knitted thing Hermione had bought him a couple of years ago. Of course, if he could cast warming charms…
. When the song ended, Harry half expected something momentous to happen because there was no way he would ever feel quite the same again.
Draco felt the approach, could almost feel the drag of the dementor’s cloak across his skin; it was both chilling and sickening. For a split-second Draco realised that he might be about to be kissed, and if he was, this would be the end of him. Yet the dementor did not kiss him, and Draco was not reliving his most painful memories. He opened his eyes, wondering why it was taking so long, and came face to face with one of the most disgusting things he had ever seen. The dementor hadn’t lowered its hood, as it would if it were going to kiss him, but what he could see of its mouth resembled something close so a decayed maggot. But that wasn’t the worst part. As it approached, it reached out a skeletal hand to him. He would have liked to say he didn’t back away because he was brave, but it was only because he knew there was no escape.
‘I just. I want this to go well, ok? It’s important to me.’ Draco kissed him gently.
, maybe we can talk about it when we get home.’ Harry seemed uncertain and his hesitation made him realise how stupid an idea it was in the first place. His gaze dropped to the floor and he tried his best not to show Harry how much it affected him.
“Draco, there’s no time. We split and run.”
Wait, he’d married Potter. Draco had been shitting bricks because he’d been terrified of how the Weasley’s would interact with his mother, who had been there of course. It was a small ceremony in the church at Godric’s Hollow since Harry had wanted his parents to be as close as possible. Draco cried when they said their vows and they’d had their first dance with Teddy, who’d been so excited by the whole thing his hair hadn’t stayed the same colour for more than five minutes and he’d worn himself out after a couple of hours.
It had started gentle, just the lightest brush of their lips, but it was quickly becoming something more. It felt like a wave had broken and was washing over the two of them, unleashing years of anger and resentment but also admiration and longing. So much longing. It’s possible Harry could have drowned in that kiss, if Malfoy hadn’t pulled away from him. The idea of what might happen next terrified him, but when she did pull away, she grinned at him with a smile so bright it could have blinded him, and he wouldn’t have cared one iota.
‘Would you do the honours?’ Draco balanced Ella on his hip as best he could – he wasn’t quite strong enough to lift a five-year-old anymore – and linked arms with Harry. ‘This might make you feel a bit funny sweetheart, but I promise it won’t last long.’ He wasn’t sure apparating with her was the best idea but since it was Boxing Day the floo at their destination would be offline.
‘So, I did this to myself?’ Draco’s brain wasn’t making the connection.
The Granger-Weasleys had already arrived due to Hermione’s excessive punctuality, as had Fred and Angelina, but thankfully the others were even later than Harry and Draco. Teddy and Victoire were chatting and giggling in the corner as Victoire played with Rose.
‘The healers said there could be accidental magic as part of the adjustment. I’m not worried,’ He shrugged. He frowned which she shook her head and rolled her eyes.
‘Don’t.’ He stepped away, unable to handle everything he was feeling. ‘Tell Pansy I’ll see her soon. Just give me space.’ He brushed past Harry, keeping his eyes trained on the floor. He thought about taking the floo, but he was sick to death of stepping in and out of fireplaces. Instead, he picked up his journal and a pen and decided to walk.
“Harry, Miss Malfoy,” Remus greeted them politely, as if they weren’t the architects of the entire affair, “it’s nice to see you again. I must apologise for my poor state of dress. Things have been… difficult, these past months.” He spoke slowly, as if he had to think about each word carefully before he said it. Harry opened his mouth to respond, but Lyra jumped in before he could utter a word.
‘Spoil what? Stop being so dramatic and just tell me!’ He demanded. Pansy walked over to him. He noticed her hair had grown since he’d last seen her, reaching down to her shoulders. He didn’t think it had been that long.
‘That’s not what I meant, Ted. I just meant that it seems like it’s a really big deal now, but you’ll be so excited that it’ll pass by in the blink of an eye and you’ll see us all again before you know it.’ Draco had no idea if he was saying any of this right. Once he’d decided that he wasn’t going to follow his father’s plan for him to marry and produce a Malfoy heir, he’d been resigned to the idea he’d never have children. That was before Teddy.
‘I missed you.’ Teddy mumbled against him.
On this occasion Harry chose to say nothing; he really wasn’t in the mood to start an argument with Kreacher. Draco was supposed to have been home an hour ago and so far there’d been absolutely no sign of him. Harry had taught Draco how to cast a patronus for exactly this reason, because Draco knew Harry got worried when he was out on his own for too long.
‘Hello little man. Where have you been? I haven’t seen you in ages!’ Harry greeted the toddler. Draco thought about how the children might perceive Harry. On one hand, he owned the orphanage, but he didn’t have any position in the everyday running of the place, and yet he was around all the time. It must’ve been odd for them to understand how he related to them. When Draco could figure out what was going on with himself, he would definitely help Harry create proper boundaries.
She gives him a sly smile and thrusts a paper bag and a drink carrier into his hands. “You talk to your grandmother like that?”
“Well her head’s not in the fire, is it?”
“Oh?” She stands too, manicured hands smoothing her dress.
Harry scratches his head apprehensively, feeling more vulnerable than when he was pressed for details about Jack. “But when he’s not terrible, he’s so interesting. He seems—the way he works… he’s smart and with his friends he seems completely normal. It’s like… half the time he’s amicable, and I can’t decide if it’s worth the other half.”
“He said that?” he asks faintly.
He’d thought about running. Hiding out at the chateau in France. He could say he won’t because it’ll look guilty, or because, if they’re going to try to pin him with bureaucracy, his best chance is responding bureaucratically.
He moans, adjusting his hips, and Draco chuckles low. “My god,” he whispers. “Tell me you don’t like me berating you while I touch you. We’d have to finally confront our troubled past.”
“Do you… want to spend the next two hours right here?”
“Be cool…” he mumbles, fingers to his lips in careful thought. “Be cool.”
Draco pictures himself in the few years surrounding the war. Had he tried a Patronus in that time? Would he have succeeded? He vacillates between wanting to know if he could have performed the spell and never wanting to know if he’d succumbed enough to lose such a benevolent ability.
Hermione’s favourite restaurant is an elegant little place in East London where Harry finds himself wondering why the posher the restaurant, the dimmer the lighting as he feels around for the breadbasket.
“Does it… is it doing anything?”
Draco laughs weakly, cheeks burning.
ridiculously fluorescent neon yellow getup I’ve ever seen.”
His mother appreciated the company, even if she wouldn’t outwardly say so. Every morning they’d have breakfast together, quietly exchanging sections of the Daily Prophet. The extent of their conversation rarely topped fifteen words, but they were a pleasant fifteen:
Draco sighs. “Touch me.”
He’s countered with a dismissing wave of the hand and trails his friend back to the lockers, a bit achingly slow, pulling his shirt up to wipe his face off and appreciating the rush of adrenaline still coursing through his body.
Draco beams. “This is a
“Why, Miss Parkinson,” he speaks with lively formality, “It is,
He casts
Draco leaves through Harry’s fireplace a while later, still humming with excitement and carrying his new box of cursed objects, and Harry takes his second shower of the day. He doesn’t shy away from the tempting image of Draco grinning devilishly at Jab.
He huffs a laugh that sounds half incredulous, half pained.
“I think, historically, it
Her help, however, is unparalleled. He brings back his potential agenda on Sunday and she adds a couple of things she’d found, but mostly praises his planning. Ron watches from afar when he’s home—his first week of work has been exciting but busy—and Rose often adds her input by pointing to a photo and making insightful suggestions like, “Big tree!”
Harry replies in a low, definitive voice, “That wasn’t home.”
“It’s
This time, though, Harry isn’t heading to Jab Gym but the office. In part, because he’d sent Jack several panicky texts assuring him that all was fine and not to change his gym schedule on Harry’s behalf, despite his own terror to run into the man.
Ron nods wisely, says “Yes, alright,” and then, stiff with formality, he turns his whole body to Harry and announces, “No, Harry. Nothing new here. Nothing at all.”
He apparates home in a daze that afternoon, feeling powerless, and when Pansy and Blaise come by he’s too focused on the task at hand to recognise the circumstance as the first time they’ve been in his home.
Draco scoffs dismissively and says nothing, fiddling around with Harry’s cell.
He shakes his head in exasperation even as he responds.
Draco shoves his right sleeve to his elbow, then slides the unscarred forearm towards Harry. “Touch me. It makes tracing easier. It’s fine to make contact this once because unlike the objects, you already know I’m not cursed.”
Harry purses his lips. Draco looks disturbed and drops his head back to Harry’s shoulder. “We’re going shopping. Whatever they sent you, give it back.”
“Harry,
“Indeed.”
“Alright, now that everyone’s officially here, Harry has an announcement to make,” Draco says suddenly from his left. He has a hand on Harry's knee, which could be a threat for compliance, a gesture of support, or a reminder for later that he loves him even though he's forcing him into a declaration in front of his friends.
“Technically speaking.”
He takes a quill from his bedroom desk, feeling two big eyes on him.
folders were staring him down, haunting him. On one morning, he sleepily shuffled to the kitchen, eyes half-cracked, to see his Flourish and Blotts notes sitting by the kettle. He froze, wand halfway to tapping the kettle to life, staring at the folder he’d been sure was sitting on his dining room table.
It was as that sense of resolution settled over him that the world seemed to perfectly guide his next steps; wizarding London had pushed him out of his haunting home onto the street, where wind and fate set his back to the breeze for just a few blocks and around that corner, Muggles on the mind, he found himself face to face with a beautiful townhouse, two storeys with a small garden out front, steps leading to a royal blue arched door with a for-sale sign posted.
“Me neither.” He pulls back and meets Draco’s eyes with a deep sincerity. “Draco, I… I know you work hard for this. I’ve seen you trying. That’s all I want, trying.”
He speaks mindlessly. “Woah.”
happy to see Cassie back at her desk.
“I’ve not been
“This is it,” he speaks finally. “
“What? What is it?”
“Hey, Draco?” Harry asks after a minute.
Harry holds his gaze firmly, then gives him a lopsided smile and pulls at him again. It’s all enough of a rousing interaction to stir something in him no matter the partner, but it’s
“Murray just arrested Draco for the curses,” he says, looking down at his hands. “Just hours after I was able to tentatively verify that he’s responsible.”
“Look, are we alright?” Harry leans in and lowers his voice. “I know things have been awkward.”
your fault that no other famous Parseltongues could be here today,” says Ron.
I’ll have to take the evidence in… It’ll probably take a good hour, so our consultation meeting…”
When he speaks again it’s distant, his thoughts thoroughly elsewhere. “If Lars is leaving, we can just spar and you’ll get a feel for the ring.”
“Sure, sure. Anyway, I found it there. Gave it to her that night and she was very thankful for my efforts.”
Draco looks away and laces his fingers together behind his head. He slows, takes a few deep breaths, then turns back with his face pinched in all the frustration he’d pushed back in the emergency of the situation.
He doesn’t have the answers, so he closes the door again after a while and passes where Draco’s taken the Asian sportsbook from the bag and pages through it to take a quick shower. When he returns wrapped in a towel, he finds a t-shirt and joggers and retreats back into steam that instantly fogs his glasses to change. His shirt sticks to him, and despite the cooling charm, he instantly kicks the joggers off into a lump when he gets under the covers.
‘It’s r-ruined,’ she sobbed. He motioned for Harry to come over.
“What? But I swear I’ve done it before, you know, with Ron and Hermione and stuff.”
Teddy’s presence only made him more confused however. Draco always had Teddy on the weekends, since he lived with Harry, but Draco didn’t remember bringing him home or remember them going to bed. Draco glanced around for any evidence of what might have happened, trying his best not to jostle Teddy.
‘I don’t need to get laid, Pansy.’ He moaned, he knew exactly what she was thinking.
Potter was also at the gardens, standing on his own, staring aimlessly into the distance. It was odd because Draco was sure there should be something important about Potter, but he couldn’t quite remember what. Had he been meeting him here? That wouldn’t make any sense…maybe there was some event going on he’d forgotten about. But then, what kind of event would bring he and Potter into the same circle?
‘You know, you’ve grown more in these last five months than I think you have in years.’ Draco pulled his hand back to take another swig of tea and mulled over her words. Did that mean he hadn’t grown as a person during his marriage? If coming to France and finding himself had been such a good thing for him, did that mean Harry was bad? He didn’t want to believe that his marriage to Harry had been a mistake. When they were good together they were
‘Hermione, what the heck is going on here?’ Her office was a disaster. The Hermione he knew was so organised a speck of dust would stick out like a sore thumb. This new office – whilst it was twice the size of her previous one – was covered floor to ceiling in papers and archive boxed.
‘And you must be my most special client so far. A little birdie told me you’ve never had a haircut before. I have to say, I can’t tell. Your hair is beautiful, just like a princess.’ Ella preened at the praise and did a perfect little twirl, her long curls looking like they belonged in one of those shampoo commercials Draco had seen on the television.
‘You trashed the bathroom, Draco. That shouldn’t happen.’ She looked concerned at he tried not to get annoyed. Everyone was always so concerned about him – it would be nice to be left to just be.
Ron was trying to say something to Harry, but he couldn’t hear it. It was as though nothing on earth existed except for Harry, Malfoy, and her guitar. Her fingers sliding lightly over the strings and her eyes never leaving Harry’s. If he hadn't known the song was written by someone else, he might have thought she was singing to
He took the book out into the gardens where he flicked through the pages like a checklist. The ground was still sodden, from the storm but the sun was finally breaking through the clouds. As he walked, he checked each item off. He’d done holding the leaf in his mouth, he’d done the recitations sunrise and sunset, he’d drank the potion, he’d waited for a storm, he’d done the final incantation. There wasn’t a single step in the list he’d missed.
he couldn’t decide if a bald head or a horn would suit her best. Both would be good.
His steps fell perfectly in sync with Ron’s without him really trying, their boots echoing around the cobbles and around Harry’s head and his ever-building headache.
‘DRACO!’ He barely got a few words out before Harry flung himself at Draco. As best he could since Draco was lying in a bed of course.
‘I didn’t know they were going to discharge me until half an hour before they did it. Harry is more than likely at work, and I don’t want to take him to the mind healer anyway. Honestly Hermione, that’s just the way it worked out.’ She didn’t seem impressed, but he wasn’t about to argue. Thankfully, his first perusal of her new office had the conversation take a different turn.
Just then they heard echoing footsteps behind them. He turned to see a wizard with a long beard and pointed ears strolling towards the door with his robes billowing out behind him. Before he could move Granger was shoving him face first through the door and into the narrow room beyond.
‘Really.’ Draco closed the space between them and rested his forehead against Harry’s, wiping the few tears that had fallen from his face and marvelling at how soft his skin was beneath his thumbs. ‘We’re really going to do this.’ He whispered.
‘Not at all, Minister, I have the afternoon off after a big meeting.’ It wasn’t strictly true, but it wasn’t quite lying either. ‘How can I help you?’
“Can’t you see?! They’re going to do that anyway! All you did was buy yourself more time whilst he could be out there somewhere needing our help! And for what? You’ve been stuck in that
‘Thank you,’ he rasped. His throat was burning, and his stomach was still cramping, but it seemed like the worst was over.
‘You mean you’d better get a move on, no one else needs forty-five minutes to get ready you ponce.’ Draco punched him in the arm.
“In a roundabout way, yes.”
‘Come in.’ He heard faintly through the thick wood and he pushed the door open. He probably should’ve seen it coming but he’d been so engrossed in his planning for France, he hadn’t even given it a second thought.
“How long do you reckon we have before that patronus gets wherever its going?” Harry could see a devilishness glimmering in Draco’s eyes and for the first time Harry wondered if he might love this impossible man.
Harry could see that Sirius was dubious, and sure enough, just as Harry was winning against Aspen, “I’m not sure about this. If he’s just a little too old…once they start to mature…foxes and dogs famously don’t get along…”
‘Yes. This particular variety of wolfsbane is incredibly rare and is only found in the Himalayas. Whoever it is who’s involved in it must have a class-A import license to get the product into the country. Even for crooks there’s no way to get through import wards. It must mean there’s someone else involved on the inside.’ Draco explained. He watched as Harry began scribbling on his memo pad.
Lyra was in front of him again, squatting so their faces were level. He momentarily forgot about the tangle of people in the room and reached out to brush her hair away from her face. He couldn’t decipher her expression.
He didn’t want to move even after the film had ended. He was incredibly comfortable snuggled under the blankets with Harry. He always felt better when he had the warm weight of him there. He hadn’t noticed when he’d started playing with Harry’s hair but that was pretty much inevitable. He was about to fall asleep when Harry shifted and disturbed him. He looked over at him to find him already staring at him. Even in the dim light his eyes shone like beacons. His hair was messed on one side where he’s been pressed against Draco and it was adorable.
“Where the fuck is third?!” His first driving lesson was going well.
“Earth to Draco?”
“Potter, there’s about as much magic in this creature as there is in that odious mobile phone you use.” The fox took that moment to yip and them in approval, getting up and trotting around in a circle like he was feeling out his new name.
‘Don’t be silly. Even if he does get mad, you tell me and I’ll jinx him into the middle of next week.’ That got a laugh out of him.
“What?” Malfoy freezes with the deep crimson robes draped over his arm.
‘Without a family.’ Draco replied as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.
‘Everything ok?’ Harry looked up when Draco entered at the conversation stopped abruptly.
‘Potter.’
“I don’t know what I was expecting,” he said when he was confident things had settled.
‘After Saint Catherine of Alexandria. She was sentenced to be executed on a spiked wheel at the turn of the fourth century. That is, if you believe half of what you read in medieval hagiography. I myself am somewhat of a sceptic.’ He realised Harry hadn’t been looking at the window. Instead he was staring at Draco. Draco stared right back, his neck sore from staring up at the window anyway.
Harry wasn’t faring much better. He’d ended up Polyjuicing as one of the guys down at human resources. Some twenty-one-year-old acne prone brainless wonder. Draco hoped whoever brewed the Polyjuice did it to Draco’s standard because he would not be happy if Harry’s flawless face was ruined by this idiot.
“Your lawyer has paid your bail Mr Malfoy.” A gruff old man informed him. He didn’t expand on his statement and Draco didn’t ask.
‘You can tell me about it, if you want.’ Draco thought it would be hard to here, but if he wanted Harry back then they both had to be there for each other.
‘Are you kidding me? You have no idea what’s going on in my head at any given time. You don’t know what I have to do to go to sleep every night and wake up every morning.’ He snapped. The baby whimpered, and he realised he’d been holding him too tightly. ‘I’m sorry,’ he whispered. He brought him up to his chest and kissed his fiery red head.
Then he explained when the dreams had started, how he was always led by Aspen in the same forest, how a little more was revealed each time he had the dream. How he started to become confused when his memory was muddled, how things stopped making quite as much sense as they had. As he spoke, he kept his eyes on his teacup, taking small sips between sentences and pointedly not looking at anyone. When he got to the previous day when he had seen the tapestry he paused and looked around him. Lyra was frowning – not in disbelief but in concentration, as if she was trying to figure out two steps ahead. Ron seemed confused, Sirius concerned, Remus impassive as if withholding any judgement until he’d heard everything.
“WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?” Harry yelled at the fox. He didn’t even care that Lyra might think he was crazy; she’d already seen more than enough, and he was more convinced by the second that Aspen knew exactly what was going on. Of course, the fox couldn’t answer him, but it did snap its jaws again for emphasis.
? ‘Watch me. In…and out, in…and out.’ Harry kept his grip on Draco’s chin as he showed Draco how to take a breath in and let it go again.
It was even uglier than it had been the first time with the accompanying blackness in the veins around it. He’d always been pale of course, but it made his skin look ghostly in comparison. When he’d been told about it at St Mungo’s it hadn’t bothered him much. Perhaps it was because that mediwitch had been so understanding, or maybe it was because he was nearly off his head on pain potions.
‘Auror Macmillan wants you to look through the file and tell him if any of the locations are suitable for growing aconite. He also wants to know if there are any wards or magical residues the aurors should look of for in the field.’ The intern sounded as if she was parroting the exact words Macmillan had said to her and despite Draco’s irritation, he knew there was no point in taking it out on an intern.
As Draco unlocked the wrought-iron gates, Blaise all but ran up the long driveway, whilst Pansy hung back, gripping Draco’s sleeve tightly.
Draco would usually have quite a long night-time routine between his skincare and his potions regime. Today he took his doses but skipped everything else. He just wanted to be next to Harry.
He didn’t even have the energy to make it to his bed as he stumbled out of the fireplace in his dingy flat. He’d cried away his energy for the day and his eyes were so raw it was painful just to blink. He curled up on the beat up old sofa he’d bought cheap at an auction and pulled the thick woollen throw over himself. Curling into the foetal position as closely and the small sofa would allow, his mind wandered back to the kiss he’d all but attacked Harry with earlier.
He paced back and forth across the drawing room floor and ignored Kreacher’s inane mutterings about the age of the hardwood floors. It was Draco who cared about the state of the house not Harry. Kreacher knew full well Harry’d lived in the house for years and not touched a thing until Draco discovered his Aunt Walberga’s portrait and promptly threw a bitch fit.
Draco hadn’t cast a corporeal patronus since the day he’d left his marital home, but he’d be damned if he failed to do it now. He wasn’t being quick enough. The pain was getting stronger and his mind was fogging with the strain of holding on. He felt as if he was being split in two while a ghost of his father laughed on amused. The last thing he thought before he blacked out was that he would surely die here, alone.
‘You won’t even read with me? I came all this way, and I know there’s a book in there you’d love to tell me about.’ There was silence. He waited. He wouldn’t rush her.
‘It’s not that easy.’ He shifted uncomfortably in his seat and wished he could be literally anywhere else.
“Oh? Because it’s definitely what you said.”
“Dear god Draco, are you still an absolute misery?” Pansy flounced into the breakfast room, having been showed in by Tressy, and draped a napkin over her lap dramatically before helping herself to bacon and toast like she owned the place. Draco himself hadn’t managed a single mouthful yet; the cavernous guilt that was eating away at him was quite the appetite suppressant.
‘Don’t be ridiculous, you moron. There’s been someone here permanently since you were admitted. I don’t leave until the next person arrives, those are the rules. You’re stuck with me I’m afraid.’ He frowned. Surely that wasn’t allowed. There were visiting hours for a reason. ‘Pots’ orders. They don’t say no to him here,’ she said as though she could read his mind. He tried to nod but it made his head hurt.
‘You had what?’ Harry pressed. Draco closed his eyes, so he wouldn’t have to see Harry’s reaction, and fiddled with the sleeve of his shirt.
‘Hermione, please.’ Draco said, rubbing his forehead. He didn’t need another rant, he’d already had one when he’d had the self-same conversation with Pansy. ‘I can, and I will. I don’t see why this is such a big deal. There really isn’t much keeping me here anymore and I need a change of scenery.’
‘Kisses for sissy,’ he said quietly. Draco’s heart melted into a puddle on the floor.
He hadn’t known until coming here himself just how awful it was when they attacked. Although he had seen the state his father had been in after his stay in Azkaban, he’d never been there during the nights when the place was a cacophony of wails and insane screams. Never had he regretted scaring Potter more. Each time the dementors approached he couldn’t help but remember all those times when they were younger that they sought Potter out, fed on his pain.
There were giant gold picture frames hanging from nearly every wall, each and every one abandoned by its inhabitants. Draco couldn’t blame them, this wasn’t exactly an enjoyable sight to behold. Blaise twittered on about the potential of the place and the intelligence of the architecture whilst Pansy, like Draco, remained mostly silent. Draco would have thought that this place had been abandoned in a hurry, had it not been for the meticulously placed dust covers on the remaining items of antique furniture. It didn’t make a whole lot of sense to Draco, most wizards would have cast household stasis charms on a place like this, to make it look like no one had ever left, and if they’d abandoned it in a hurry they certainly wouldn’t have gone to the trouble of covering the furniture. Draco wondered if perhaps it had been left deliberately this way, but why?
‘Hey,’ Harry pulled him into a hug. ‘You don’t have to look so scared. I know it’s a lot, but we can do this together. We’ve both been through worse. We lived through the war.’ Draco hugged him back hesitantly and tried not to get too attached. He had to watch the memory sooner rather than later.
In the end, he threw half the contents of the fridge into a pasta bake. It took much longer than it should since he couldn’t charm the pots and pans to do everything for him. It probably tasted rubbish – he’d never really got the hang of cooking despite his potions expertise – but it would have to do.
he missed that bright turquoise hair and big brown eyes. Except the turquoise had just turned a familiar shade of white blonde.
“So, you can’t do it now,” Harry says slowly. Some of the light dies in Malfoy’s eyes.
‘I see.’ He said quietly.
‘What do you want, Potter?’ Draco refused to sit down, he wouldn’t be saying long. He took the opportunity to take in Harry’s appearance more closely. It looked like for once he’d actually attempted to tame his wild black hair, not that it worked very well. He had a bit of five o’clock shadow which, considering it was just gone nine in the morning, meant he hadn’t had time to shave. It looked surprisingly good on him, Draco reluctantly admitted. His Head Auror Robes were horrendously ruffled, but he looked even more muscular than he had the last time Draco had seen him, which was just so unfair. He made Draco look like a spindly little waif.
‘Be careful Rosie!’ Ron chided but she didn’t look like she cared at all. Draco was far more interesting.
‘Hugo is fine, sweetheart. He’s spending some quality time with Uncle Ron while I come to check on Draco.’ Hermione said kindly. She sometimes talked down to Teddy a little bit, since her own children were much younger, but Teddy never complained.
Draco woke into darkness. He panicked for a second before his eyes adjusted and he realised he was in the bedroom in his flat. Had he fallen asleep here? He didn’t remember anything. He became dimly away of a warm weight pressed against his side and he looked down to find Teddy pressed against him. A familiar warmth bubbled in Draco’s chest at the sight. Teddy had never slept in the same bed as he or Harry, but Draco had watched him sleep many times over the years.
‘And you’re not sure if it qualifies as cheating?’
He was in a narrow hallway in pitch darkness although he could see perfectly well. He couldn’t remember how he got there, but he let his instinct guide him. He sniffed around the room, picking up the smell of oak from the floorboards and something more man-made; sweet and aromatic like vanilla and star anise. The room wasn’t familiar at all, but he recognised the scent faintly, as if he had smelled it before but never understood what it was. There was a door to his left, and he tried to stand up and grapple with the handle, but he hadn’t yet mastered the lack of opposable thumbs. When he couldn’t get the door open the regular way, he started scratching at the edges, hoping it wasn’t pushed closed properly and he could nudge it. The door creaked open slowly and for a split second, Draco thought he had been successful, but then a figure appeared on the other side. He yelped in surprise and scrambled away, his paws slipping against the smooth surface.
Century. It’s supposed- it’s supposed to-’ He was distracted by a sudden awareness of a mass of people around them. He spun on the spot and found huge swathes of tourists had descended on the cathedral since they’d entered. One of them crashed right into him as they were too busy looking through their camera lens to see what was right in front of him.
‘I know, I deserve a medal.’ Draco laughed.
‘You and Da-Draco will love me no matter what house I’m in, but if there’s a house I really want to be in the Sorting Hat will take it into account.’ Teddy parroted.
‘I’m not being ridiculous, Parkinson.’ Draco snapped. ‘Potter has gone and bloody replaced me! With the female fucking version of me!’ How could Pansy not understand how insulting that was.
‘mmfm.’ Teddy muffled into Draco’s shirt.
‘Shit. Harry I- I think these are my missing memories.’ He looked at Harry with trepidation. He remembered the flashes he’d seen when Harry had asked him about his wand. He knew, he had that feeling in his gut that this was important. It had to be the missing link, he just didn’t understand how. If these were memories he’d once reviewed, why would he have forgotten them?
‘Not much really. He said they weren’t like memory charm scars. He explained it more like my subconscious might have hidden particularly traumatising memories as a coping mechanism? He seemed to think unlocking them would ease the flow of my magic.’
‘I know you probably want to show me around, get reacquainted, but…Look, I’ve been scared of this all week and I’d really just like to get the worst of it out of the way. This one of your family’s ancestral homes and I don’t want to outstay my welcome if- if it turns out you don’t want me here anymore.’ Draco felt drained from the vomiting, but the lost look on Harry’s face made him so guilty he didn’t want to make him suffer much longer.
Draco sits cross-legged on the living room rug, back against the sofa, reorganising his books for the fourth time that week. First, he had gone with typical alphabetising, but he didn’t like how uneven the shelves looked with large hardback and smaller paperbacks all at different heights. Then, he went for sorting by colour, which looked absolutely beautiful, but there were so many different shades of white and off-white that it stressed him out and he took them down again. Now he’s going back to alphabetising them but separating the hardbacks from the paperbacks so the different heights can be grouped together.
Harry rarely used his phone other than to play Snake, but Luna happened to have developed an interest in muggle things recently and had also invested in a phone. It was definitely much less hassle than the floo; there was less soot for a start. Whilst the fox was distracted by the remnants of the blanket it destroyed, Harry dialled Luna’s number.
‘I never did lift those wards, did I?’
He sat on the sofa in the living room, not feeling tired anymore since he’d fallen asleep earlier. He pulled out the journal he’d left in the kitchen earlier and flipped through the pages. He’d filled nearly half the book since he’d started in November and he wondered how he’d had that much to say. He could be a man of many words, and yet often he didn’t say very much. His eyes landed on a page from just a last week when he’d been reliving the death of his mother. The new potions had made him far more emotional than he ever had been before – the healers said it would right itself after the first week or so, but it hadn’t gone back to normal, not really. He realised that although the journal had been about his recovery, so many other things that had happened in his life had influenced how he’d chosen to deal with it.
‘My apologies, Mr Potter. I’m going to need to adjust your dosages slightly; you need less Vitamix and more Regeneration…’ she trailed off as she began checking off various different factors she was supposed to monitor during his appointments. He had almost zoned out when he realised what she’d said.
‘She’s fine. I haven’t been around in too long,’ he offered Ron a smile and hugged Rose with his free arm. She was taller every time he saw her, although she didn’t appear to be any steadier on her feet than before. A few years ago, he never would’ve guessed he’d be flanked on either side by small Weasley children. In fact, he never would’ve guessed there’d be so many children in his life in general. Of course, he knew he’d be part of Teddy’s life – even if he and Harry had never gotten together, Teddy was still his cousin – but there was also Rose and Hugo and Ella and Johnny and all the other Weasley spawn he managed to avoid except for Christmas. Any more little feet running around and his brain might explode.
‘Everything ok Teddy?’ Harry asked him. He nodded, his still blond hair tangling against Harry’s coat.
Her kiss was tentative like she hadn’t kissed before. It was barely a nudge of their lips as if she was challenging him to take control. Instinctively his hands reached for her waist and he pulled her against him. He had always held back from the feeling he got whenever he saw her, but this time he couldn’t. He didn’t want to. Her hands were in his hair again as the kiss deepened. Breathing seemed irrelevant, time unimportant. The fear and confusion swirling inside him were banished by the pang of affection he felt holding her in his arms.
‘That’s not the point, Draco. Teddy needs you. He loves you just as much as he loves Harry and children can’t have too many loving influences in their life.’ Draco knows she’s right, he knows that Teddy is the most important thing in his life at the minute, but he’s at his wit’s end.
He smoothed the paper back down on the ground, Potter face down where Draco wouldn’t be able to see him. The ache in his heart grew deeper and wider every day without him. It must have been the early hours of the morning before Draco put his head down to sleep, not that he got much of it. It seemed though, that he wasn’t the only one with insomnia in recent months. Something hot burned beneath his cheek and with a sudden burst of energy Draco scrambled for the object he’d stuffed inside his pillow.
For just a moment he wondered what it would be like to love Malfoy and to be loved by her. Until then he’d never thought of her as the kind of person someone loved. Not because she was unlovable, but because he’d rarely ever thought of her as a real person with real feelings and a real ability to care. Seeing her moved by the music made it hard to believe this was the same person he associated with ignorance, intolerance, and Death Eaters.
“It’s a he?” It hadn’t even occurred to Harry, but he realised with a jolt that he had been referring to his fox as ‘it’, and he was probably quite offended. Like it-
‘We can use that. It gives us new avenues to explore.’ He said as he wrote.
‘Thanks for leaving the star for me,’ Teddy said to Harry once he was safely back on the ground.
That Friday he showed up early to Andromeda’s so that he could ask Harry if Teddy could stay with him for the weekend too. Draco really needed to get his finances in order before his Gringotts meeting and he didn’t want Teddy to have to hang around while Draco was sifting through paperwork.
“Excuse me? I didn’t ask you to come here. In fact, you’re taking up valuable time I could be spending talking to someone who might actually help me.” Granger didn’t even have the gall to look ashamed of herself.
Come to think of it, Potter had probably forgiven Pansy by now. Heaven knew Draco didn’t deserve to be forgiven but he had been, and he’d done far worse than Pansy ever had. If Potter never came back perhaps Pansy would stay partially outcast forever. It hardly mattered anyway as Draco refused to believe Potter was dead, despite all the evidence to suggest he could be. Potter had defied the laws of nature on so many occasions Draco wouldn’t put it past him to do it again. Besides, he just had this…
‘Come on, Ted. Let’s have a chat.’ He directed Teddy through to the living room and sat him down on the sofa.
‘My Ministry file?’ He asked a furious looking Harry. When was this guy ever going to learn that he couldn’t just barge in here without an invitation?
‘There isn’t much we can do for you at the minute I’m afraid, your recovery will mainly be a lot of rest to restore your magic levels. I need to do a few tests now that you’re awake and once I’ve got the results through I can come back and discuss what happened. Is that ok?’ Draco nodded again, not in the mood for talking all that much. Lockhart-a-like gave him another blinding smile and started waving his wand in some quite ludicrous movements. Draco wasn’t sure if he really was that incompetent or whether he was just trying to show off to him.
‘Don’t you think these are important?’ He handed it to Draco, and he squinted at the label, trying to read it without his glasses.
‘Call it leverage,’ he said dangerously, and Draco suppressed a shiver.
Still, did that mean Harry hadn’t used these decorations since the last time Draco had cast the spell? That would be silly, he bet the idiot forgotten to cast it despite always watching Draco do it.
‘Bloody hell, Draco! How long have you been there?’ Draco smirked.
‘Smith. He- he wanted to take you away from me. Said I had to go back to dark magic. I-I don’t want to.’ His voice cracked painfully.
‘Will you do something for me? Please.’ Harry nodded frantically.
“What is this about then?” He asked when they were settled with their tea. There was a pause as Granger looked to Pansy, who nodded in encouragement.
“Lyra, you’re not on here…” Harry said slowly.
“I’m older now. I’m wiser, better prepared.”
‘Stop distracting me. Why are you really so hellbent on leaving Draco, don’t give me any of this “I need a change of scenery” bullshit because you and I both know that’s a lie.’ Sometimes, he really hated Hermione.
‘I thought it was you. I was so fucking stupid. He must’ve slipped something into my drink, god only knows. It was like I knew it couldn’t be you, I knew you were at home in bed and yet I didn’t question a thing. We even went to his place for fuck’s sake! I should’ve bloody known. I felt so guilty I didn’t know how to tell you. Even Ron thought it might be best to say nothing-’
‘Don’t over think it. Things don’t have to be perfect, let’s just see what happens.’ It was difficult for him to offer any real advice when he didn’t exactly know what was happening, but he tried.
‘You really said that?’ Draco asked Harry. A glimmer of warmth flooding through him that Harry included Draco when he’d told Teddy that.
Thursday 4
He had done it. He had found Potter.
‘Shit.’ He whispered. It hadn’t even occurred to him that Harry, as Draco’s superior, would have to sign off on Kingsley’s decision. Kingsley however, had been Head Auror before he became Minister, which meant he should’ve absolutely forsee- oh that meddling bastard. No wonder he was so calm about Draco leaving his post.
Harry was floored by this information. Malfoy had gone to a muggle university, which meant a minimum of three years, and Harry hadn’t known?
‘Thanks.’ He said with a small smile.
‘Yeah, well, apparently I’m so cool I’m still huggable.’ Draco said smugly. Harry sat down on the swing seat next to them and Draco was glad that Teddy could act as a physical buffer. Ok, he was a terrible parent for thinking that.
‘I was thinking. It’d be horrible for you to go to the platform, it’ll be packed full of people and Teddy will probably be very emotional. As far as the public knows, we’re divorcees living completely separate lives and you’re currently in France. Would be a bit of a shitstorm if we suddenly showed up in public together. It’s not quite the same as when he left.’ Draco thought about this. Harry wasn’t wrong, part of his worry had been over how he was going to cope in the crowds, how he was going to stay calm when he was flooded with all the stress he’d been keeping in since Teddy left. It was true, it would be better if he wasn’t there.
‘Pick it up,’ he smirked.
‘It was Wood you went to see, wasn’t it? And he blackmailed you again, didn’t he?’ Harry looked uncertain.
‘What about Teddy? He adores you Draco, you promised him when you left Harry that you’d still be there for him.’ Trust Hermione Granger-Weasley to cut straight to the chase. That woman wasn’t known for holding her punches.
‘DACO!’ Something small and squidgy collided with Draco’s lower legs and he looked down to find a small child with hair as dark as Harry’s attached to him like an octopus.
The movement was tentative, unsure, nothing like the confident Malfoy he was used to. There was a pause and then it happened again. Presumably because Harry didn’t do anything to deter her, Lyra continued to play with Harry’s hair. In a way it seemed wrong, since Harry was usually the one who was obsessed with her hair, but it also made his heart race in his chest.
‘I know you want to go and do that project thing. I promise I won’t touch anything I shouldn’t and I’ll floo call you if anything happens. And Dad gave me his muggle phone number too, although I’m not sure where the spare one is for me to call him from…’ Draco bit his lip. It was tempting, and Teddy was getting a little bit older, and he’d been at school and managed just fine. But then there’d always been other people with him at school, and he was Draco’s responsibility, and Draco loved him far too much to live with the guilt if he left him and something happened. Oh, he didn’t know.
‘You’re so boring. Draco never makes me do homework.’ Oh dear, Draco might have spent a little too much time with her recently.
‘Potter? But we I- when we- you’re still married?’ Draco nearly faltered. When they what?
A week later, Draco received an unexpected owl. He’d just begun packing his stuff up for his move when an unfamiliar tawny owl started scratching at his window. He hauled himself up from where he’d been sat cross-legged on the floor to let the owl in and was surprised to find an official Gringotts envelope. He hadn’t kept his own owl for a long time and since he didn’t have anything to give the tawny, it bit at his fingers and he yelped. He managed to shoo it back out of the window – trust the goblins to employ the nastiest owls possible.
Granger had files scattered across her side of the table, each covered in leather wallets embossed with the logo of the law firm she worked for. They’d sat in awkward silence for the first fifteen minutes and he was yet to figure out what she was doing here. The files had remained closed the whole time.
‘I wouldn’t advise you terminating your session early Draco, you’re here for a reason.’
‘How have you been my love? And don’t give me any old rubbish. I may not be your mother, but you can bet I’ll see right through you if you try to fob me off.’ She was all-but wagging her finger at him and he was reminded that she was the woman who took down his mad aunt and he definitely would not be stupid enough to cross her.
“Potter is going to explain a few things to us, aren’t you Potter?” She dropped him in it without even looking up from the board even though it was Ron’s turn and he wasn’t the slightest bit interested in the game anymore.
He groaned with the effort of raising his head off the pillow as it sent a wave of pain out from his chest to his fingertips. He couldn’t see all that well, but he could tell from the copious amounts of white that he must be back in St Mungo’s. He was sick of the sight of the place now. His head fell back against the pillow, entirely of its own accord, and he realised trying to move was futile. He thought perhaps he wasn’t actually fully awake yet since all he could see was a giant blur of white and the clock right next to his face.
‘You remember I told you Smith said I have repressed memories?’ She nodded. ‘Is there a way that I could use those to solve this magic problem?’
‘Yes?’ He called distractedly as he tried to finish the last line. He was always terrible at finding his place when he was reading.
He also still hadn’t figured out who’d stepped in at Gringotts. He’d already owled asking for information on who was involved in the decision and as he’d expected, the goblins had been incredibly tight-lipped about the whole affair. Still, it jangled Draco’s nerves more than a little knowing someone other than Hermione had known about his departure. Hermione was a lot of things, but deceitful wasn’t one and she probably didn’t hold that kind of sway with the goblins. Kingsley, maybe? He could certainly pull strings. Would he actually be willing to do that for Draco? Again, unlikely.
‘You’ll just have to trust me.’ Draco couldn’t help himself any long, he hooked his fingers through the beltloops of Harry’s ridiculous muggle jeans and pulled him into a toe-curling kiss.
‘I’m fine darling, I swear I’ll-’ His body swayed a little as the alcohol suddenly hit him like a train. It must’ve been stepping out of the heavy-duty warming charms that did it. Now he understood why he shouldn’t have been drinking.
Ron clapped him on the back before taking the floo back to the flat. No words were exchanged between them, but they didn’t have to be. Ron had already followed him to the end and back again.
Teddy chose that exact moment to burst through the kitchen door, waving one of his presents about.
‘Surprise.’ Blaise greeted him with a smirk and they hugged. In a very manly way of course. All about those macho hugs.
‘It’s ok. You said sorry.’ He looked at Harry who looked dubious but didn’t say anything else.
The realisation should have sent him running. He should have made for the door and never looked back. He didn’t want it to be true. The next thing he knew, he was on the floor with her face was looming over him. He could see her lips moving, probably calling for him, trying to get a response, but it was like he was only half there. He stared, dazed, into her pale face and suddenly its wrongness was all he could see. Where was he? How did he get here? Or was he where he had always been, and it was everything else that had changed?
‘There you are!’ Pansy exclaimed a moment later when she finally caught up with Draco.
“So what you’re telling me is there’s an app?”
‘Harry you can’t let him do this! You can’t! You promised you wouldn’t let me go again!’
Not long after he had met Potter, the Ministry had placed Draco under house arrest after his appeal against his war conviction was rejected. To save himself from going mad in the Manor all day, he had decided to explore some of the more complex magic that wasn’t taught in Hogwarts. Not dark magic of course, but his current fixation was on animagi and, more specifically, how to become one.
the words. To him, it made her look ethereal.
“What just happened?”
‘Why do you keep looking at me like that?’ He felt naked under Harry’s eye and it was more than disconcerting.
‘Using my relationship with Teddy against me, are you?’ Draco’s voice was low and cold. ‘Because the last time I check, I’m the one who’s related to Teddy by blood.’ Draco knew it was the wrong thing to say, but he was more than pissed that after all this time, Harry still assumed the worst of him.
‘I’m trying. I give him lots and lots of hugs!’ She said proudly, grinning at him around a mouthful of eggs. He started plating up more as the other children came downstairs. There were only ten children in the orphanage which was easily manageable, but from what Draco could tell, they were expecting a lot more once the proper systems had been implemented. So far, they only had children from magical families since they were automatically added to the magical register.
‘You need to get me out of here. Please.’ When he opened his eyes again, he found Harry scanning the crowed for the quickest way out. Somewhere in the back of his mind, Draco was disappointed that Harry hadn’t known in an instant. Surely the auror in him was still trained to find the exit points in any given situation.
Draco didn’t know what to say. It made complete sense and yet he had never thought about it. It wasn’t everyday people survived that kind of trauma, so it wasn’t as if there was a stockpile of cases to compare him to. Had so much of what he’d achieved been because of Harry’s magic though? Surely, he had some strength of mind to do it himself. He wasn’t a coward anymore and he wasn’t stupid.
‘Yes! I swear that man is still head over heels for you.’ Draco pretended he hadn’t heard and it worked out well because Pansy wasn’t done. ‘Anyway, what the
‘Teddy isn’t dead Harry, he’s just at school. What’s this really about?’ Harry pulled away from him and Draco took the opportunity to stand upright, his knees burning with the weight of his body. Harry didn’t seem to know what to say so Draco took his hand and guided him downstairs where he could make him a cup of tea. Tea made everything better.
Great. Bloody, fucking, great.
‘How long have I been here?’ His voice sounded marginally better than it had before but it was still gravelly, a touch hoarse, and all too much like a grandfather who’d been smoking forty a day for the past three decades.
Draco didn’t quite know where to look for the best, so he stuck with staring down at the keys, letting the final chord wane to nothing.
He ran his thumb slowly over her high cheekbone and his heart raced at a thousand miles an hour. She wasn’t even pulling away; she was just letting him. He felt like a giddy child being allowed ice cream for the first time. It was all taking too long. She was getting nervous. In the time he had been dawdling by marvelling at her, she’d started to bite her lip and it turned his insides to jelly.
“Do not fuck this up.” Lyra hissed in his ear while they had a moment alone. “We’re doing this for Sirius, and we won’t get another chance.” Irritation flared. He didn’t like the implication that he was doing this on purpose – why should he? He
The problem was, Draco was restless. It was mid-December now and very little had changed regarding Draco’s health. He couldn’t be on his feet for great lengths of time, he couldn’t do anything strenuous and he certainly couldn’t do any magic. The height of irony was that his pureblood status made his condition worse, since his magical genetics meant his body didn’t know how to function properly without the addition of magic running through his veins. He could almost laugh at what his father might have said if he had been around, but the truth was it was a lot harder for Draco than he was willing to tell anyone.
‘Malfoy, if this is too much for you, I’m more than happy to terminate your contract.’ Kinglsey said severely as he sat down at his desk.
‘Draco, please. Don’t get yourself worked up. We still don’t really understand what’s happening to you, but I think it’s playing off your anxiety. Please, I know it’s hard but please try to stay calm.’ He was so angry with himself. Furious even. The last time he’d seen Teddy he’d yelled at him, made him cry, then promised him he’d be back soon. He’d gone back to Hogwarts and Draco had missed it. He’d gone off to Scotland without even knowing if Draco was ok. He was the worst parent in the world. He’d already put Teddy through so much and he’d done it yet again. He had to go to Hogwarts. He had to apologise. He had to never do anything so stupid again.
He sat down carefully, trying not to disturb Hugo any more than he already was. He stopped making as much noise, but there were still a few rogue tears running down his chubby cheeks.
And then he put in too much milk.
Really, he should’ve gone back to work, but he didn’t feel like it and it wasn’t as if they could fire him. Without his potions genius, the business would’ve folded a long time ago. He was surprised to get a floo call from the Ministry though.
‘I saw my father.’ He blurted out. He wasn’t sure why he said it, he just had a sudden flash of remembrance of what had happened before he blacked out and it sort of just came out. Harry looked surprised, Hermione looked alarmed. Hermione opened her mouth as if to barrage his with questions, but Harry held up a silencing hand.
‘Again!’ She squealed like a toddler when they reappeared. Draco could feel Harry’s shoulders shaking with silent laughter but felt too ill to turn his head and look. Harry let go of Draco’s arm to take Ella from him, but immediately grabbed his shoulder when the loss of support had him wobbling.
‘I think we just appreciate it more every year.’ Harry shot Draco such a heavy look that it almost knocked the air out of him. He was sure there was so much between them that they’d never really be able to talk about it all, even if they were able to put it into words.
She smirked. “M'everything?” His friends had ribbed him constantly at school for his Potter obsession, but these days he had learned how to control himself better.
‘We’ll find a way to fix it. I promise.’ Draco didn’t like to be promised anything, but he didn’t argue. ‘Thank you for showing me this. Although I have to say, I’m glad it didn’t work out in a way. I can’t imagine what life would’ve been like if you’d stayed here.’ Draco had never thought about that.
“You. Stupid. Fucking. Idiot. How. Could you. Do this. To me?” Harry does his best to hold back laughter as Draco smacks Orion with his slipper. They look so similar that it’s almost like watching Draco fight his own reflection. The twins are often mistaken for each other, although Harry now finds it easy to tell them apart. It would be pretty awkward if he accidently made out with his auror partner instead of his boyfriend. Not that that has happened.
Potter’s expression hasn’t changed a millimetre, and only his eyes, shinier than before, give away any semblance of comprehension. Like coming down from a high, the flutter in his chest has been instantly replaced by a sinking emptiness. All the annoyance he’d built up from listening to his mother and Blaise and Pansy mentioning Potter, expended onto the man himself—who hasn’t bothered him outside of work-related matters until now. Who left his friends to check on him.
“You just… your head and your arm… That was terrible.”
He watches as Malfoy holds one hand up close to the shelf, long fingers extended like a fan, and closes his eyes with a delicate but intense focus. Then he sighs and drops it.
proceed with business.
Draco surveys the crowd again, back still securely to the wall, though he doesn’t admit to himself who he’s looking for. And yet he sucks in a breath when he finally spots Potter standing with Weasley by the bar.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t realise I’d—Does it hurt? It looks like it hurts. I’ll try not to touch it or—“
Another one. And in Diagon Alley. Harry fights the sickening reminders of Death Eater presence on the high street years ago. “Alright,” he says, “I’m right behind you.”
you,” she says, eyes widening irascibly.
“Oh, no, no, sorry,” Harry tries to hand it back immediately. “I need to—“
“Mental,” mutters Teddy, mouth full. They lapse back into silence for a few minutes. Then, after a sip of soda, he declares, “Draco said you wouldn’t tell me what you talked to Gran about because I’d get
with cake and sweets and Albin’s wonderful decorations, and everyone can join me tomorrow when Harry’s separation anxiety Mind-Healer sessions begin. Eat, drink, and be merry!”
After a while, they play a pick-up game as Seekers. Harry releases his Snitch and they lean on the grass to talk for a minute while it begins to fly about.
into a preface. Don’t ask me why. I’m better at objective writing.”
Draco was fine. Likely sore, surely exhausted, but fine. It had been a poison-laced item—they don’t know the specifics—but it’s been treated. Apparently, Draco was offering slurred, whispered advice to the Healers, then slurred, whispered berating when they dared question his advisement.
Harry purses his lips and leaves without another word. It’s not Hermione’s doing. Or Blaise. And Draco’s not home. And the necklace lays still against his chest. He pulls it from his shirt in miserable frustration as he walks back towards the lift, then stops suddenly when his thumb traces over the rough shape of etching instead of the usually smooth surface.
, Pans—Oh.”
They start in Paharganj, a market stretch covered in textiles and clothes and books and jewellery, and when Harry wanders into a stall full of books and spots one he likes, Draco presses rupee banknotes into his hand, leaving him to gape at his ability to procure Muggle Indian currency. He’s never even seen him in possession of British pounds.
They’ve made it ten more paces, and already his hand is captured by a bright-eyed witch before he’s finished speaking. Draco resumes his position a few steps behind, perfectly pleased not to receive any looks of his own. He’s happy to be dwarfed by Harry’s celebrity.
“If it hurts you this much, maybe it’s time to visit less—“
“So what’s new with you, then?” she asks, just as their food arrives.
“I think it was Albin,” Ron mutters in response. “It’s the… thought that counts?”
He drinks slowly, heart beating faster as more guests begin to take their seats, and focuses on the bite of his drink, the carefully-rehearsed words ringing in his ears. He can feel eyes on him, and a look towards the side of the stage confirms that security wizards are watching closely, waiting for him.
He beams, thinking for a moment back on the night, but the smile fades just slightly when he remembers that he and Ginny hadn’t been speaking again yet. Molly had been the most noticeably disappointed—he could tell that she’d imagined he and Hermione both arm in arm with her children.
on your resume?”
“Do you talk?”
“Rasmus Neo was a joke!” Hermione says. “And honestly Ron, use some critical thinking skills. I take on rights cases, what human or animal rights is he involved in?”
“C’mon, old man!” Harry jeers, grinning.
“Good! I’ve got to change so,” he jerks a thumb back towards his door. “If you want to sit and wait.”
“Okay,” Hermione replies gently. “We just wanted to be certain. We don’t want you getting hurt. More.”
to find a place in my budget with a t-rex skull. You had a great time, Draco, and
“Together?”
He’ll never know exactly what Draco says, can hardly imagine it, most interestingly because, despite a couple of heartfelt conversations, they’ve apologised to each other with their actions more than they ever have with words.
He hesitates. There’s a calming confidence in him that says Harry would set the note down without reading and live with the mystery if he asked him to. And knowing that, he lets him open it.
Draco’s London flat must have sensitised him to acreage like this because despite his childhood home he was momentarily awestruck by the size of it all. And yet, southern France in autumn was a wonderful corner of the world, and even torn literally and figuratively by a Portkey from the middle of a rather important series of events in his life, he found himself fully understanding his mother’s interest in the countryside.
He steps forward, envious that only Harry gets to cover his expression with boxes, and takes the top parcel and bag off his hands. “He’s fine. He’s on the chair, see?” He nods towards the study, arms full, and follows when Harry walks that way.
“Distracting, my arse,” he mutters, dragging his attention reluctantly back to Junior Auror performance reviews.
Harry shakes his head.
Harry ruins it soon after.
Without warning, Teddy flies high and dives, further and faster than Draco’s told him to. He shouts after him to pull up, tucking quickly into his own dive and watches him begin to slow, but it won’t be in time.
“Draco’s just a consistently good dresser, Ron. Don’t consider yourself special,” Harry teases, seating himself.
He hadn’t known about their daughter, either. He’ll have to scold Harry later for his terrible briefing skills. He twists on the couch to look around. “Which one is Victoire?”
Harry looks frustrated and he sits forward further, brows drawn in. “So you
not a twat anymore—“
. It’s about time we all get to know each other, right?” says Pansy.
He’s ferociously combing his fingers through his hair, but the disobedient curls spring back unhelpfully. He can hear clinking from the bar cart—Ron pouring two short glasses unprompted, and he drops his hands from his hair to take one.
?” Draco says. “Nice to hear from a fan.”
Her eyebrow is tipped up sceptically, and he can’t see an outright lie that would prove successful here, so instead, he offers a half-truth, hoping it will explain his demeanour well enough.
“Harry isn’t busy! So…”
“How did he know you were looking into your heritage?” Hermione asks.
Ron is turning in the mirror, reconsidering his outfit. “Too warm?”
. He ambles further back into the tall, glass-stacked shelves, feeling a particular thrill when he realises he’s stumbled into the rare ingredient section. He browses slowly, gingerly removing a bottle or two for a closer look, lips twisting in disgust at a jar of goblin eyes. The world will be a wonderful place if he never knows how those are salvaged.
“Maybe I’ll just go,” he finally says, incredibly, as if Harry hasn’t stunned him across a London street at midnight.
“You forgot your coat,” Draco says, settling in on the pavement and handing his balled-up jacket over.
He wants to say that he doesn’t see it as a lie so much as a careful omission of the truth, but this isn’t fair. If he’d been confronted, it would’ve been a lie. He just wasn’t confronted.
Harry looks down with a scowl. He’s dressed in a grey long-sleeve and blue jeans, with his old Gryffindor scarf slung loosely across his shoulders. It’s officially mid-September, and he’s taken a practical, unassuming route.
Harry quirks an eyebrow, recognising that his generally polished friend doesn’t tend to advertise himself otherwise. He turns back to Ron.
“Yes?!”
, when it’s Saturday, you can go to the significantly more abandoned office. Let’s not jump into actions we’ll regret later.”
Leonard’s lips quiver. An attempt, but an unsuccessful one. Malfoy moves closer, the mixture in hand.
“See you soon, mate,” says Ron, clapping him on the back.
When he reaches Diagon Alley, his pulse is racing and his mouth is completely dry. He hasn’t felt so overcome with nerves, with the idea of someone else, since years ago with Ginny. This feeling makes Jack seem like a schoolyard crush.
) and attaches it to Orsix.
“Harry, you look pale, you’ve had a long day…” Hermione breaks his concentration.
“Keep it, mate,” Ron says, nursing a half-drunk beer. “I just wanted to watch you order that.”
“The Healer’s orders were rest, not stay in bed. I need to go to yours. Trace the entire thing top to bottom. Do some warding.” He grimaces as he sits up too. “I can’t
“Mm… uncountable.”
Ron leans back on his arms, regarding him. “What brings you over, eh?”
“I don’t know, being… touchy. It’s surprising. You’re… standoffish, as a rule.”
that enters people’s homes—“
“Hmm.”
Harry leans back against the armchair again. “Oh, I know you do. She told me all about your Quidditch bets and the sort. Why didn’t you say? I was just talking about her.”
“Draco? What?”
She clutches his hand firmly before dropping it and standing, her expression lightened. “Good. As long as you know we’re here.”
When she’s gone, Harry throws his arms over his eyes and finally lets out a slow sigh in his solitude. He stays there, no clue how long, until Hermione returns, and then he peeks towards her under his arms. She has a red envelope in her hand and stoops back to the bottom shelves for one of the thin books from before.
“Pride or otherwise, all knowledge is useful, Draco. For example, what I’m about to propose involves an understanding of Dark magic, an experience with the feel of it. You, therefore, are the perfect scholar for this line of research.” He says this last bit with a hint of excitement, a hint of pride. Draco thinks of their conversation years ago on playing to strengths.
His wand splutters, as lifeless as though it’s been snapped in half, and he stares at it horrified. Draco closes his eyes slowly with a sigh, like Harry’s confirmed something he’d braced for.
When she returned, there was a packed box labelled 1998 in her arms, and she set it down on her seat, parsing through its contents out of Draco’s eyesight before finally alighting on what she’d been searching for. She flipped to the second page of an old Prophet and held it out to him across the table.
Draco takes a deep breath.
“Mm!” Ron speaks before Harry can open his mouth. He’s already gotten the first bite in his mouth, so he holds up a finger for them to wait.
Ron looks between them. “At Boggarts?”
news, because I told Blaise.”
*****
When he looks back to Draco again to try and communicate, he's surprised to see that he's eyeing him already, repeatedly staring at him, flicking his eyes around the room, then shaking his head. Harry can't decipher it, and he looks frustrated by this, but his gaze moves up past Harry before he can try to communicate back—a firm grip lands on his shoulder. Hadrian had come closer during the exchange, and now pushes forcefully to drop Harry to his knees. The tip of a wand prods into his temple and he scowls.
“Merlin, he’s not a
They’ve been gone for a good bit. He wonders what everyone inside is thinking, and hopes it’s nothing at all.
Ungrateful prick.
Harry blanches, “What?”
He spins to Draco in revelation. “I’ve interrupted,” he says, long after interrupting. “You were actually taking a night off to have a… good time, and I brought you more work, and hours ahead of schedule. God, I’m a bad friend.”
“Lucrezia got her position because she was good at her job.” He puts his feet up on the desk, regarding Ron’s own casual position behind the Potter nameplate and considering wistfully how often and easily they used to escape to do just this. “It’s going to be strange without you here. Honestly,” he says.
“If an object is just cursed, my charm will work. If it’s a more advanced combination… I need a more advanced charm?”
Draco thinks for a moment, a
“Who’s this?” he asks softly, petting him head to tail with no hesitation.
Ron furrows his brow. “This… this keeps happening—Hermione and I don’t want to be saved any trouble.”
“He apologised to you, didn’t he?”
“—and so now that they’re definitely a go for next year’s games and a shoo-in for the Cup, they wanted to ensure that they had better security.”
He’s immensely thankful for his friends; Ron, who’d taken on the disconcerting task of overseeing Marinella’s collection of the evidence in Harry’s shower, then filled a bag with everything Harry would need to spend a few nights away and gone to Draco’s for a change of clothes for him, too; Hermione, who sent owls off to everyone who needed one, brought him multiple coffees, and stays with him long after Ron needs to go to collect Rose from their neighbours.
No answer. He almost swipes at Draco’s ankle to annoy him into offering attention, but his instincts tell him they’re on thin ice. Instead, he gathers all the patience he can and cups his coffee with both hands, waiting tolerantly.
“Nevermind, then.” Harry scrunches his nose. “No thinking allowed.” He walks back towards the sofa, tugging him along for a few paces before he stops in his tracks. Harry feels him stiffen and drops his hand quickly.
That gets Harry’s head spinning again. He’d looked intriguingly confident compared to the Aurors surrounding him. If Hermione was right, which is usually a non-starter, then he couldn’t have been cursing Agnes moments ago. He would’ve had to curse the silverware before, stealthily, then be dense enough to stand up and point his wand at the victim. Even a git like Malfoy wasn’t that thick. But if they were carting him off—
He cups the tea in his hands as he hums in interest, feeling her attention on him and discovering terribly that he’s quickly losing all energy available for maintaining pretences. If Draco maimed him Wednesday, Murray had been the killing blow yesterday, and he’s having trouble picking through old history books while coming to terms with the fact that he’s planning on disregarding Ministry orders to treat his boss as a suspect, all with no support and no curse specialist.
“Yes, I’ll admit it was rather coincidental that
They land off the path of a brick-paved square by several sunny pink- and tangerine-coloured buildings lined with palm trees. It’s a cheery landscape, and in conjunction with the warm breeze moving off the water, it’s hard not to feel more peaceful.
Harry thinks back. “A couple of years older than you. When I got angry, strange things would happen.”
Harry smiles in thanks, unfolds himself from the couch, announces, “I’m going to get dressed,” and leaves Draco alone as he thumps quickly up the stairs.
He’s still grinning as he pulls his head from the floo.
Harry chews his lip, wanting to tread carefully. “I’m sure, er, this is very hard for you. To be here. There was a curse that’s been handled, but I could really use your help. It’s important.”
“What’s
Draco shakes his head stiffly. “Aren’t your actions what you think?!”
I cared until the option of removal was completely unavailable.”
Draco regards him with fascination, then slowly his face creeps up and he lowers himself onto the scarf. Harry sits next to him, facing the water. The wildlife is stirring, and they watch the first boat paddle out onto the water below, breaking the still of sunup. He spares a glance to his left, at beautiful features faced out onto soft light, then lets his thoughts stray, and when he chuckles to himself, Draco turns his head.
? What if
Luckily—or unluckily—he is all too familiar with the effects of a Cruciatus curse. It would be easier to say he’d gotten skilled at overcoming the curse during the war—it was no secret that Voldemort was heavy-handed, follower or not. Instead, he drew from childhood memories, his father standing over him, wand out, voice even and emotionless as he coached him through the hopeless pain.
Harry beams, holding his hand out, and says “Try it!” but Draco just scrunches his nose.
Work hadn’t proved as joyous; the day after Harry’s foray back to the gym, a neat pile of diagnostics on the cursed objects arrived on his desk in Draco’s neat, loopy script. It included all the positive hits he’d gotten, as well as potential unclear results and negative tests. Harry sent it off to the Junior Aurors to assemble a compendium of potion shops in London and their catalogues, cross-referenced for the ingredients in both curse makeups and Nightshade ingredients, the residue found on several of the objects.
be real when I get home.”
“I’m reading the room, Harry,” he smiles tightly. “Later.”
“Okay,” he concedes without argument.
He sends a narrow, side-eyed look at Malfoy, who has stood back politely. He gets the impression that the young Auror is still uncomfortable by the unannounced intrusion and doesn’t want to be the one left alone to decide what happens now. Harry can’t blame him—he isn’t too sure what to do next either.
He had frozen mid-movement at Jack’s name, mouth dried up, thoughts racing and disappearing just as quickly. Presented on a silver platter before him is the moment he’s been waiting for, set up perfectly to finally stop lamenting like a teenage girl and finalise whether his relationships will be a deal-breaker for their friendship. If he could just squeak out any words at all.
“Ah, well… That’s just fine. I had thought, maybe, now that I knew you were… it’s fine.”
Meanwhile, Ron is gesturing tactfully to his wedding band.
He doesn’t, but he does smile down at the floor. It’s like an apology, from the flat to himself, for a morning of feeling overthrown.
“I don’t know what to ask her,” Harry says softly after a minute of silence, lowering his arms to his side.
Draco sighs sympathetically and nods. They both study the broom quietly for a minute.
“He’s
“Before you leave, what sort of warding already exists?” he asks, balancing the paper on his knee. Harry stands thoughtfully, looking strangely guilty with one arm through the robes.
He shrugs. “My dad’s invisibility cloak, floo network, disguising and disillusionment charms. It was much harder when I lived by Diagon.”
That might've been the most question marks I've ever written in one chapter. Poor confused Harry.
A trace of the new sometimes-flustered Draco passes over his face.
“Just go talk to her,” Blaise suggests once Pansy has spent the better part of an hour laughing loudly and flipping her hair when Luna seems like she might look this way. “You’re almost thirty.”
“I can tell.”
“Er, no,” Draco replies. He hadn’t even thought to look. He assumed he was tagging along, not participating.
“About the consultancy,” Harry adds.
“Yes! What else is there to mention? We have watching this game in common, and we have working in common!”
Draco hadn’t said ‘I love you’ exactly, but they both know he’s said it. He’d said it on stage that night, in a way. He’d said it in the preface, too. And he’d said it so clearly in the dedication that Harry had grown silent for a worryingly long time. Draco presented the real editor’s copy excitedly when he’d arrived at his door for dinner one evening, watched him inspect the cover and the back before flipping to the inscription and freezing completely:
“And you’re really alright with all this?”
“I know,” he finally responds, voice cool. “I wouldn’t ask you to stick around and do that. You’re right—you’ve not even been paid for consultation. I’ve already asked too much of you.” His gaze falls back to the table, where Malfoy is fingering the napkin under his mostly empty plate. “Our consultants are usually under official contract and recompensed for their time and materials. You like croissants?”
It’s an ivory-stoned wizarding institution of central London and they’re ushered through quickly without a single fuss about Harry’s addition, though there’s no telling whether it’s common practice or a reaction to which famous bespectacled man made them four. Pansy practically pulls Harry into the chair beside her, and Draco’s getting the sense that he’d be her newest project if he let her.
Pansy watches quietly while he adds his dress robes, a deep emerald green that unintentionally complements her dress. He leans in close to the long mirror beside her, resisting the urge to gel his hair back—he’s paranoid of anything connecting him to the boy from Hogwarts.
Harry bites his lip thoughtfully. “It was… memorably unique.”
, he thinks of himself.
Instead, he reckons he must be strangely affected by his spoon hitting the floor. He quietly offers his spoon while Hermione talks, but Draco looks at it in confusion and shakes his head.
He’s right, of course. Shrewd, when it’s most to Harry’s detriment. Harry shrugs again. “Okay, okay, I… er… I said something about… his mother. He didn’t take it well.”
He’s all slender, graceful lines and seams falling perfectly along the contours of his form, cutting shapes of black and white and tan. And best of all, he embodies it as though the entire thing was a five-minute afterthought.
Work is hard to focus on, then, for a few minutes after Ron’s exit.
“Auror Potter, quite a ruckus this afternoon, I hear.”
“It’s fine, no.
“Come in,” he says at the door, before watching Harry set another bakery bag down in the kitchen. The offering sends a rush of affection through him, and he hears the words tumble out of him. “Harry, I’m sorry.”
“To me.” Harry shrugs, voice easy. His eyes bore holes into Draco’s.
“You’re just too picky,” Blaise says. “Always have been,” but then his eyes spark up in enlightenment. “I’ve got it. The next person to walk by is
“A Horcrux? Voldemort’s Horcrux?”
Ron pats his shoulder, standing and holding a hand out for Harry’s empty mug. “That’s fantastic because I told her you should take her to dinner tomorrow.”
“I got your owl about the evidence. You’ve finished with it?”
now.”
He hands the treat back to Draco without looking, as if handing a purse to his spouse, focusing courteously on the wizard. In fact, every interaction is accepted with grace and charm, and with a perfect response to every comment. Harry does all of it with a smile, and Draco is pleased to already be able to differentiate it from the one he often receives—
“Hm.”
Harry stifles a laugh as the elf’s frown deepens.
She nods gravely, and Harry is impressed, from one crisis responder to another. Offering hysterical family members short, concise information and a task is textbook. He files Malfoy’s calm, organised handling of the emergency beside the strange wandless magic to consider later.
“Do you want any help cross-referencing?” he offers. “It does pertain to me.”
This had been
Harry grins wide and proud. It’s exemplary that Draco wants desperately to win this fight because he must know he’ll get an earful of I-told-you-so’s afterwards for using the same move he’d argued Harry about just last week.
“Thanks,” Harry drawls, though he’d prefer no other arrangement.
is right here,” he says, brandishing it between them. “I watched you tire over those lists—you know how many wands just like this are in Britain, Harry. They’d need more than that.”
“It’s not fair,” he bites out.
He doesn’t know when it’d begun, truthfully. He just knew that the more he rejoined society, especially at his publisher’s or Hogwarts, it had benefited him to be a little self-deprecating around anyone who might already be judging him. Like, if they knew that he knew he was an arsehole, they’d accept him faster. After all, he had the same opinion as them; Draco Malfoy was a prick.
“Sorry, er, the evidence won’t be yours for a bit, you know the drill. So we can leave. If you want,” he offers.
drafts?”
“Where are they?” Draco’s face is lit with excitement, more awake than he’s looked since Harry arrived. “And how soon can I have them?”
Her hand squeezes where it still lays on his wrist. “Are you happy, Draco?”
Draco whispers back, “I know.”
“What on Earth have you been up to? Tell me
“Well I’m glad we stopped. Isn’t it terrible to imagine?”
Between the thoughtful discretion and the very un-Blaise-like stammering, Draco’s feeling dangerously moved. “Men, for now, thanks. Not written in stone, though. But honestly, enough Potter jokes. Come up with something more original. It’s embarrassing at this point and—“ He stops as his thoughts catch up to Blaise’s speech. “Hold on, Blaise. You said a decade, but all those men were after Emilia.”
“Your lovely flat. You and Dante.”
“No.”
“Sounds are loud, food not good, head pounding.”
. “She wasn’t the only one calling for a conviction like that, I don’t find it personal. But it seemed like a coincidence. Until I mentioned Leonard Erickson.”
“What my mum used to give me. You know, after a bad Cruciatus.”
“Draco didn’t seem like himself,” he admits, as he retells the story. They glance at each other and back over.
friendship had us scrambling. We managed alright anyway. Honestly, did you not consider why we were so lenient with the evidence? Why it led to a hawthorn wand? Why the victims had trouble with the Malfoys?”

“Oh, we screen. I’ve got heaps of unanswered letters.”
“That’s quaint—having issues.”
Draco pulls his hand down from his face and pulls at Harry’s other one too. He tries to convey the level of concern he feels, recognising Harry’s passionate path towards well-meaning rashness.
“It sounds like your tongue in her mouth happened.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Draco Malfoy.”
His flat is dark, empty despite Dante’s presence. He cleans up the two plates from breakfast and the two mugs, the last hint that it was temporarily occupied by more than an individual. Dante purrs, winding through his legs, sensing his melancholy.
Potter looks uncomfortable. “Well, I guess, but you don’t have to—I don’t think talk like that’s necessary.”
The first thing that Harry registers is the datedness of the space and the strange feeling of crossing the threshold, which is a lifeless, energy-sucking one. The walls are vertically-panelled wood, the floor a muddy orange carpet. There’s an old tan skirted couch at the centre that Lucrezia sits on, legs crossed casually, but the rest of the furniture is pushed closer to the walls and covered in sheets.
“I just wanted to
one, which in itself stirs something uncomfortable in Harry, like he’s once again deciding how much to say. “I don’t think so.” He doesn’t ask a follow-up question, but instead returns to smoothing the duvet.
“Some of the most unkind yet unavoidably valuable counsel an actively-worked upon patient has offered,” the Healer had sighed, looking a bit abased.
The chateau that Narcissa Malfoy had bought in Chalais was a castle. A ‘modest’ castle, she called it, as she pointed to where a drawbridge used to pass over the now-dried moat. “Just 900 square meters, not including the woodlands.”
He also sent off for a list of all English hawthorn and unicorn wands purchased in the past century, surprised to find it all on his desk the following morning—days ahead of the trajectory he usually predicted, given the inane hours the Junior Aurors enjoyed spending flirting in the breakroom. Unfortunately, no amount of star-crossed Junior Aurors could save him from the week that followed, during which he’d spend painstakingly comparing the wand list names against the potion purchase names.
Draco sighs. “What’s a chicken cutting board?!”
Meanwhile, Draco is stuck in an overwhelming feeling that he can’t name besides thinking ‘I hope he keeps coming round’. His stomach flips again, imagining all the times he’s sarcastically called Harry ‘our Savior’ or something equally spiteful, and vows never to have a go with any
He’ll joke with Ron, too, about work and his haircut, and he’ll ask after Teddy and Harry will ask after Rose, and they’ll laugh about children. Hermione will keep her eye on him, and not see the smallest resemblance to the man she had tea with, because he’s been dominated by a greater force; one determined to deserve love and give it, to Draco or Ron and Hermione and Rose or Teddy.
“You’ve been distant lately,” Blaise begins. “And I understand you’re preoccupied and I’m probably flogging a dead hippogriff, but you’re less reserved with Pansy than with me. So I can’t help but feel that there’s an issue between us. I didn’t want to ask at dinner tomorrow. But clearly, you’re going through… something,” he gestures vaguely behind him towards the study.
“I...” Harry interrupts but trails off. His hands are fidgeting and Draco sees him thinking carefully, so he waits with painful patience. “I… I would like to jeopardise that,” he finally says.
Harry’s fist freezes high, then drops to his side as he turns around. “Oh, Jack, hullo.”
“Don’t say that.”
“Good to see you, boys!” she yells over the student chants as Ginny throws the Quaffle into play.
“Wow,” Harry breathes.
He listens, jerkily controlling his body enough to sit with his back against the sturdy desk. He draws his knees up, breathes slowly, rocking his body through the waves of pain. He stays this way for minutes that feel like hours, his world reduced to one body, one mind, the in and out of his inflating lungs.
Nothing.
“Brilliant, you’ll love it down there. Everything’s so old. There’s a bookshop you’ll die for. Work going well?”
“Aw, don’t say that.” He doesn’t say
suddenly change shape incriminatingly, don’t send it to tell your fiancée that your tuxedo is ready for her to pick up.”
He thinks of Harry not knowing until the Cruciatus Curse hits that it’ll feel like life-ending torture, never learning to curb its effects. Harry doing all this with his face splashed on every issue of the
“It’s classified,” he says.
Orsix gratefully takes the note and flaps out the dining room window, leaving Draco to tidy from days of intense curse research where not a moment of time was spared for cleaning. He’s had tunnel vision since they returned, proved in the state of his workspace. It’s a pigsty, even by his usual standards.
The constricting panic of being unprepared to host his mother is already setting in, his pulse accelerating as he tries not to think of the state of his bedroom and study and
“You know,” Draco replies, taking a sip of gin, “I always wondered why you were so willing to come to my flat and bunk off Star Aurorship, but I would take half days and curate a booze drawer if I had to look at shit like this all day, too.”
Draco’s eyes widen. “Where did you even find those?”
, Draco,” he berates for the umpteenth time from where he leans against the wall by the bag. “Not all at once. In sequence. Ankle. Hips. Waist. Shoulder. Wrist.” He claps his hands in rhythm with each word.
“Well, keep going, don’t stop now!” Blaise sits forward further.
Two booths away, a group of young witches are eyeing him over their butterbeers. They’re too old to be students and certainly not dressed for the game, and when he turns towards them, they collapse into a pile of giggles, whispering to each other and glancing back furtively.
“He wasn’t terminated, you just said to seek alternative specialists.”
“I swear I left the case on my desk.”
. But it muddles the brain well enough to substitute for the unconscious. Enough to welcome nightmares.
“Juliya came to
His eyes dart anxiously. “Take him? She said he was being released until the trial.”
Even now, he runs his hand along the familiar stone of the hallway leading to Charms and is unsurprised when Flitwick’s classroom is empty of all but him. He looks up, face lighting brightly with a smile when he sees who’s arrived. It flickers then into something resembling guilt, just for a flash, furthering Draco’s belief that a trip to Hogwarts would have been rather manageable and the professor had ulterior motives to get him to the reunion gala.
