“I have a bit of a late wedding present for you,” Draco rushed out of the room and came back carrying a doormat.
“Remus was around too, but I never saw him the same as I did Siri. He was my first crush, but I didn’t act on it. Then, a few months after I turned twenty, he and Siri broke up and Siri took off. They’d broken up several times in the past, but this time it seemed permanent. We got drunk, and one thing led to another. It stayed casual the first few months.”
“Give the man the brownie,” Draco said as he wiped his eyes. “I don’t think any of us can top that!”
“Draco, you remember Dudley,” Harry called. “This is his fiancee Emily Macmillan, and her brother, Ernie.”
“The Kind Poppy,” Draco read the label on the bath bomb. “Wild Rose and Hibiscus.” Draco sniffed it and sighed approvingly as he dropped it into the water. He sank into the bath and let the tension of the past six months melt away. He put a warm washcloth over his eyes, and tried very hard not to think.
“Let’s do it! I’m going to call my agent and turn down this role.” Draco knew Blaise would understand. Blaise was one of the few people who knew what had happened to him, and he told him not to rush back into working. He was going to take that advice and focus on recovering.
“Part of me will always love him,” Harry conceded. “But, what I felt for Remus pales in comparison to what I’m starting to feel for Draco.”
“I followed him into the loo. I was chatting away, not paying any mind, and he had to ask me to leave!” Luna said embarrassedly.
“Now, this one here, lives a life that is the very definition of boring. And that’s saying something considering his flatmate is the Court Jester of Weirdness,” Charlie winked at Rolf as he threw his head back and laughed. “And I’m 99% sure you’ll never talk to him again once you hear his grade school nickname was…. EW!” Harry licked Charlie’s hand just as everyone else in the room said loudly, “MOPPY”
"Potter," Draco turned on his heel towards his roommate, trying not to sneer. "I know that we've had our differences but I must thank you for speaking at my trial. I owe my life to you." He decided not to mention that Potter hadn't spoken for his father, who had received the dementor's kiss.
Draco’s pride screamed as Harry slid a supportive arm along his back, but he felt the exhaustion set into his bones, quieting any objection he could have managed.
Harry began to survey the boy for injury as the tub filled, and Draco woke. Harry was raking Draco’s body with his eyes when he came across a wad of purple scar tissue. Harry scooped Draco’s forearm from the water to get a closer look.
Several days passed by Draco without incident, Harry went to classes and Draco slept the sun away, smoking whenever he felt the pains of hunger. When he woke and felt it time to bathe, he would also take several razor bladed swipes at his dark mark.
The holidays continued in an ease that soothed Draco. He had quickly taken to sleeping in Harry’s bed because it smelled like the brunette and he seemed to sleep restfully instead of intermittent states of panic. Harry never complained, just chuckled, and lifted the cover for Draco to slide under.
Draco looked over at Harry, who was leaning on his elbow. At some point, Harry had shed his glasses, and Draco was struck by direct emerald eyes staring back at him.
It was soon dinner time, Potter had spent an extensive amount of time flipping through a Quidditch magazine while lying on his stomach until a Patronus had been sent by a voice that had to be Granger. It had asked him down to dinner, saying that she and Weasley had arrived.
He had long before the Patronus' arrival decided to skip dinner, his nerves already fried. He hadn't eaten often over the summer, so it wasn't difficult to skip another meal here and there, though he would have to face the Great Hall, eventually. The thought made him shudder.
“I’m heading to the manor, what about you?” Draco hoped against the odds that the statement didn’t come off as intensely depressing as it was.
“Do you mind?” Draco asked, more out of social obligation than anything else as he lit it by the tip of his mother’s wand.
Draco was beginning to squirm because of the pressure between his thighs when Harry rolled on his side and began to palm him through his pajamas.
That morning Harry got up and dressed without a word to Draco, who was curled into himself like a child without any intention of moving. The weight on Draco’s chest anchored him to his bed, his head fogged with nonsensical thoughts about running back to the cold empty manor that he called home. His ex-nemesis had not only been woken by his shrieks but had sat with him as he cried about nothing. Draco was mortified.
The slashes on his forearm wept fresh blood and Draco knew he hadn’t the strength to try to bandage himself in this state.
Draco had had little time to even bother thinking about coming out to his parents, though he knew what their reactions would be down to the hand gestures. His father would yell about carrying on the Malfoy name and call him a faggot. His mother would smile and pet his hair, telling him it was normal to go through these types of phases as a teen. Draco knew it wasn't a phase as much as he knew that his name was Malfoy.
Draco recalled when The Prophet had published the expose on Harry and the Weaslette's breakup and the thrill that shot through him before he had quickly squashed the thought. Draco had always thought Harry too good for her, anyway.
“Where’s the fire, Har?” Rolf asked as Harry flittered about from room to room wearing only a bathrobe.
“Who am I seeing tonight?” Harry asked warily when he showed up at Remus and Sirius’s house the following week. “Hopefully it won’t end in bloodshed.”
Lockhart pulled a gun out of his back pocket. “Yes, you most certainly will. Take off the necklace and leave it on the desk.” Harry complied even though all of his instincts were screaming at him not to.
“You won’t have to,” Harry reassured him. He rubbed some lavender essential oil on Draco’s temples and began to massage them. Draco groaned in delight, the tension in his body noticeably easing. “Olivia and I have made a thorough and detailed plan for mine and Hermione’s safety. Part of that plan is a panic button necklace. Mine will be attached to three: one for Hermione, one for Olivia, and one for you.”
“How did you win him over?” As much as this conversation hurt, Harry needed closure. Remus still held a very large part of his heart, and Harry still loved him a lot. He’d long accepted he would always feel this way on some level.
“Maybe I’ll send Gaye Magazine our interview and see if they’re interested in publishing it,” Harry replied. In truth, he’d enjoyed writing it, even if it was spontaneous and off the cuff.
“Thank you,” Draco whispered gratefully. “I knew you’d understand better than anyone how I feel right now.”
“Pineapple pizza for me and Ted, and veggie lovers for you and my Dragon.” Draco and Hermione exchanged looks and made faces. They
“Is there anyway I can get the grade up to a B minus?” Harry pleaded. “If I don’t get at least Bs, I’ll have to drop out. I can’t afford to come here otherwise.”
The book thief turned to him and gasped. “Oh my God! You’re Draco Malfoy! It’s such a pleasure to meet you!”
“I didn’t lie when I told you that you were talented. You’re just not talented enough to fool a master.” Lockhart looked triumphant as he walked towards the parking lot.
“Yes, one for you. Did you honestly think I’d do this without you involved in some completely safe indirect way? You’re my partner. The love of my life. I can’t do something this big without you.”
“Why are you doing this?” Draco winced as Lockhart punched Harry hard in the stomach. “I’ll give you the money! I’ll help you escape! Let him go!”
“Remus was… torn. Not sure what to do. I chose for us. As much as he loved me, he would always love Sirius more. It’s only this past year that Siri and I got our relationship back on track. Well, here’s my favorite part of this neighborhood. I came here a lot after I ended things with Remus.”
“I’ve had some local social workers doing surveillance for me all over campus. Ones young enough to pass as grad students. I've had them talking nonstop about this amazing, talented young man named Harry who could become the next Daniel Radcliffe with a little help,” Liv sipped her coffee, a satisfied look on her face.
“Your Death Mage is very cool, but I happen to be very fond of my Myth Mage,” Harry said as he saved his progress and exited the game.
“I’m just a boy. Standing in front of another boy. Hoping with all my heart he loves me as much as I love him,” Harry said with a silly grin.
“Disgusted. Sex work should be a consensual practice. I’ve removed all of Draco’s work from my website, destroyed all hard copies, and I’ve compensated him monetarily for his pain and suffering. I’m truly sorry, Draco. Had I known, I would have sent you away immediately.”
“True enough,” Draco responded softly. Harry pulled him into a long, tender kiss. When Draco pulled away, he asked, “want to come to my place for a nightcap?”
This is where the story deviates from Notting Hill entirely. I hope you enjoyed the parts of the movie I included in this story. It certainly brought back a lot of fond memories for me. That’ll always be one of my favorite films! I do hope you’ll stick around! We’ve still got some loose ends to tie up.
“His name’s Seamus. He’s my accountant,” Sirius said. Sirius owned a motorcycle repair shop. “He’s got a nice perky bum and kisses like someone who’s waiting on the world to end.” Remus glared, and Sirius balked. “That’s what the chaps in the shop say.”
Halfway through dinner, it was obvious to Harry and Thyme that they’re better off as friends. It didn’t help that Thyme and Charlie had spent the entirety of dinner giving each other looks that promised a very pleasant sexual encounter. Harry was unsurprised that they were the first ones to leave.
Draco burst out laughing. “You fucking dork.” Draco kissed him in between laughs. “I definitely feel the same way. I love you.” Hermione squealed with joy from the bottom stair, and tackled them both.
“Their talent shouldn’t be wasted. If their mother had gotten her way, they would have become lawyers like their older brothers, Bill and Percy. She never quite understood that her children shouldn’t be cookie cutters of each other anymore than they should be cookie cutters of her and her husband,” Draco sighed. “Be back in a jiff.”
“Absolutely,” Harry wrapped his arms around him tighter. “Do you want anyone else there or do you want to do a Remus and Sirius and not tell anyone.”
“Adult magazine shoots. Ones that involved penetrative sex,” Draco whispered. “I have nothing against people who want to do that kind of work doing it. But, it wasn’t something I would have chosen for myself. What I didn’t know is he kept the photos and he had the photoshoots recorded. He’s deceptively edited them to make it look like an adult film.”
On social media, I mentioned that my Hermione has two things in common with Emma: she's a feminist, and she describes herself as self-partnered instead of single. I read about the self-partnered thing in an article Pink News wrote about Emma late last year.
“You should seriously consider a career as a journalist,” Draco complimented him. They were now alone and sipping glasses of lemonade. “Your questions were so much more interesting than anyone else’s.”
“Siri and Remus are on an anniversary trip. They’ll be gone a week.” Harry was in an amazing place. He and Draco had been living together for three months, and their relationship just continued to get stronger with each passing day. It was nice to be happy for Remus without wondering what might have been.
Happy Mother's Day to everyone who celebrates it. If you don't or have mixed feelings, I understand completely. On one hand, I have a great relationship with my grandmother whom I deeply cherish. On the other, I've miscarried twice and my relationship with my mother hasn't been good in a long time. It's been years since we've spoken. Today's bittersweet for sure.
“You’ve had a thing for Meg Ryan for years, mate,” the first guy laughed, and Draco winked. The first guy sighed, and said, “Draco’s got this twinkle in his eye.”
“He and his fiancee moved back to Ireland. They left a week ago,” Hermione told him. “I’m Hermione. Harry’s friend Remus introduced us a few months back.”
“His name’s Gilderoy Lockhart,” Charlie sneered. “Pretentious arrogant snob. He’s a drama teacher and a tabloid reporter, and he thinks he’s God’s gift to the masses. He’s always pressuring Draco to look a certain way. It got to the point where he controlled everything about him, from his hair and clothes, who he sees and talks to, how much time he spends with them. He’s even tried to control his diet. When Draco became a vegetarian, he tried to make him go vegan because he ‘didn’t want to be known as that award-winning journalist with a big fat boyfriend.’'
“You think that’s bad,” Hermione said, a challenge in her eye. “I went to an Imagine Dragons concert a few years back. The opening act was these two guys dressed like total dweebs, they couldn’t play or sing for shite, and they were singing songs that said things like ‘hey mommy I’m a rock star’ and ‘shut your face Grandma.’ If I told my grandmother to shut her face, I’d be in for it!”
“Naturally. I’m gay and I typically only take on queer centered projects. My character’s love interest is a trans man. Ever hear of Theo Nott?”
“Moppy, huh?” Draco teased. “Wouldn’t have anything to do with that bird’s nest you call hair now would it?”
“Lu Lu,” Harry sniffed. She’d been a constant in his life since he first moved to Notting Hill, and he was going to miss seeing her nearly every day.
“Insurance,” Draco’s voice broke. “He raped me. Afterwards, he told me if I told anyone, he’d show everyone those photos and videos to prove ‘I’m a whore and I wanted it.’ You can’t tell. Promise me.”
“He’s my partner. Please come in,” Harry led the investigator into the living room. Draco’s eyes lit up with alarm.
“Come closer,” Lockhart whispered. Harry slowly approached him, his stomach flipping at the man’s obvious arousal. “You’re so beautiful. It’s been a long time since I’ve had someone as handsome as you in my presence day after day.”
“The hell I’m not Draco!” Harry fumed. “I left you there that night! I didn’t even give you a chance to explain. I let what happened with Remus color my view of the situation!”
“I’m sorry, what book do you mean?” the guy replied. Harry rolled his eyes. The man does this shite every fucking time.
“Gilderoy Lockhart. He moved to New York in mid-March to teach drama at Julliard. Students have filed complaints,” Olivia informed them. “I’ve been in touch with your friend Charlie Weasley’s brothers Bill and Percy. They’ve been keeping tabs on Lockhart since he left, and as soon as the complaints were filed, they contacted me and told me about you. I just came from seeing Charlie, and he told me he’s not going to say anything until you’ve had a chance to speak with me first.”
“I told you to come alone,” he said to Draco and fired the gun. Liv grabbed his hand and the bullet broke a nearby lamp.
“This is one of those moments I should be playing cool, and I’m going to monumentally fail! I absolutely and completely adore you. You are giving queer people everywhere so much hope and you’re teaching allies like myself and Rolf how to be the best allies we can be.” Luna then hugged him. Draco was surprised, but returned the hug with a bashful smile.
He makes his way there from his office at a pace so fast his robes flap behind him furiously with every step. He passes a few people in the hall, mentally assigning them into categories. Unsurprisingly, most of them fit into the third. They don’t don’t pay attention to Draco. Only one person quickly turns around to gaze with fake interest at the door leading to an unused office when they see Draco coming out the corner—they clearly try to avoid him. Overall, it’s a lucky day.
He lets Harry guide him into his arms, trying to dull the feeling of embarrassment. It’s nothing. It’s just nothing. He’s had it worse. Losing Quidditch matches was embarrassing. Being hurt by a hippogriff was embarrassing. Being turned into a ferret was humiliating. As was being slapped by Granger, punched by the Weasleys and Harry after a Quidditch match, tortured by Voldemort after Harry escaped…
Maybe it has left some sort of permanent fear response in him, knowing that one moment of inattention could cost him not only his life, but also his parents’. He knew his Lord wouldn’t have had mercy for him.
He starts going for walks, every day, dragging his heavy legs forward and forward, wherever they take him. He makes discoveries exploring the Muggle area around his house. He didn’t know the town he lives in has more than one bookshop. He didn’t see the cosy-looking cafe just around the corner of his street. He doesn’t recognise any of the faces of the people he passes by—why would he?—but he can’t help but wonder how it would feel to know some of them.
He remembers the times when he could get anything he wanted just by showing his left arm to the not-so-innocent sellers. Now the mark on his skin provides him with no power.
Well, he didn’t get sorted into Gryffindor for a good reason. He’s not brave. He doesn’t know what exactly induces his paranoia—he knows, however, that there’s only one way he can tame this feeling. He does the only thing he knows will feed the doubt and fear he still possesses and presses his fingers to the inside of his forearm, as hard as he can.
Harry nods and takes another sip of his coffee. “I think I get it. Many people have been telling me over the years that I look like my father, or that I have my mother’s eyes… At first, it felt nice. I felt like a part of them was still alive.” He looks at Draco sadly. “But some people didn’t see me as a separate person. They expected me to act exactly like my father used to. I wanted them to see me as
He looks down, not sure if he’s already burning or not but knowing that the flames will engulf him soon enough. He wants to scream for help but no sound comes out—his mouth only releases black puffs of smoke. He’s doomed. Absolutely terrified, he’s trying to take a step forward, but something doesn’t let him move. Something is holding him back, and soon he realises that he’s clinging to a body...
After the war, everyone wanted to get the trials over with as fast as possible. The law was still deeply flawed, but apparently there was also no time to change it. People wanted
It only gets worse from there. Draco can’t keep looking at Harry. He leans in for kisses with his eyes closed which results in them bumping their noses or him hitting Harry’s glasses—generally him not being able to find Harry’s mouth at all.
“Because he’s in prison? And you haven’t seen him in a long time?” Draco asks, trying to not sound disappointed.
Yet, the nightmare somehow isn’t over—his arm is still burning. He sits up abruptly, clutching at it, and feels all the blood rushing out of his head, making him dizzy.
Harry helps him out, thankfully, and when the room is lit, Draco can see that his Dark Mark is as faint as always. He stares at it helplessly. He’s too scared to touch it.
Draco spends little time looking around, trying to not appear judgemental. The interior of the house is—expectedly—the opposite of sophisticated, with everything looking cramped, worn-out and mismatched, but Draco finds himself indifferent towards it. He knows his parents would absolutely hate spending any time in such surroundings. Would they disapprove of his choice to come here?
He also doesn’t object when Harry wants him to lay down on top of him. Positioning himself is a bit awkward, but when he finally rests on top of Harry’s body, he feels his muscles relax in a way they haven’t in a while.
“I don’t know.” He sighs and looks as far away from her as he can. He decides to get straight to the point now instead of postponing this conversation. “It happened only once. I had a nightmare in which I was at home—previous home, I mean, the one where I grew up—and it was during the war, and I felt a burning in my left arm. When I woke up, I could still feel the pain. It only subsided after… maybe half an hour? It fully disappeared in the morning.”
“Actually, I bought something for you. Just in case you’d ever want to say here overnight. Let me show you.”
“I think we make a good pair,” Harry adds quietly. He sounds a bit like he’s expecting rejection; his voice is shy, and even his words somehow appear small. Draco already knows this conversation won’t be easy.
Draco pauses the conversation for a moment. He notices that he interrupted Harry, that he didn’t let him talk—that’s not how he wants it to go. Only after he calms down a little, and only after it’s clear that Harry isn’t going to say anything, Draco speaks again.
“Everything, Angelique. I don’t know why it happened. How is that even possible? Is it my brain playing tricks on me?”
“Why would I not be doing it? Don’t I have the right to undress myself in my own house?” Harry doesn’t answer, so Draco continues, “Do I have no right over my body?”
“If you have nothing work-related to communicate to me, get out.” Draco is almost scared of the coldness of his voice, of the ruthlessness he possesses.
Harry doesn’t say anything for a moment. Then he asks again, “Why?”, except this time he sounds hurt.
Harry’s bed is bigger than Draco’s, with a firmer mattress and bed sheets that are fluffy and warm. His bedroom is painted in lighter colours and has a big window, so that even on a cloudy day plenty of light comes in.
Draco can’t bring himself to look into Harry’s eyes, but he holds onto his hand as if it’s a lifeline.
“You’re making me happy. You have a job that helps people. You’re trying to become a better person, and I see your fucking effort, every day. I see how much it costs you, when you don’t have any energy left after you come back home, or when you get back from Angelique and barely talk with me for the rest of the day—I see it. I see how much you’re trying.”
By now, Harry knows exactly what he can and can’t do. He can’t touch Draco’s forearms, can’t grab him by his wrists. He can’t reach under the shirt to touch his skin. Harry has never questioned it—after all, he knows what Draco is hiding, even if he’s never fully seen it.
Harry probably decides to not argue with him. Instead, he pushes a loose strand of hair from Draco’s forehead. “Can I say that you’re pretty? Is it okay?”
These days, he doesn’t abolish his clothing-regime even when he knows he’ll be alone. He doesn’t like looking at his scarred, scrawny body.
Harry falls quiet. Then, he strokes the back of Draco’s hand. “How about Dreamless Sleep? How does that sound?”
“It wasn’t my best idea,” Harry admits, looking at the deformed product of their labour with a tinge of sadness.
This thought terrifies him so much that his presence seems to switch to another dimension. At first he thinks that he fainted and now is gaining consciousness because he’s in a vertical position, and he definitely wasn’t in a vertical position when the Dark Lord summoned him through the Dark Mark. Then, he sees Harry leaning over him, and he realises that he’s not at the Manor—he was dreaming.
Nothing like this happens. Instead, the sound of the front door being slammed shut makes Draco jump.
“What are you doing?” Harry asks, even though he can see it clearly. Maybe he thinks that it’s enough to make Draco change his mind—if that’s the case, then he’s a fool.
“A sponge cake. Uhm, I do the butter, and you do the eggs.” He pushes the egg box and a bowl towards Draco.
Warmth spreads in Draco’s stomach, and he’s ashamed that he has a physical reaction to hearing those words. “It’s all right.”
Harry still doesn’t move, so Draco has no problem yanking the photograph out of his hand. He looks at it, for a brief moment, short enough to notice only a few details. Ron stares at Hermione with an expression of slight uncertainty, while Harry’s eyes wander from Draco to the camera, over and over again.
Draco thinks it’s enough to make Harry a little mad, to make him leave his office. His words, however, seem to have the opposite effect. Harry stays where he’s stood, and—if anything—he appears even more dejected and miserable than just a moment ago.
“I didn’t tell you that it’s impossible! I told you there must be some other explanation for why you’re feeling pain.”
Harry rests his head on Draco’s chest again. They are not compatible at all—Draco knows that. He’s just too hedonistic to let the chance of experiencing something semi-exciting go by, and Potter is too much of a stubborn idiot to simply give up trying. He always thinks he can fix everything.
Merlin, sometimes he could really use leaving the house more often. Going to St. Mungo’s and asking for a prescription could turn out to be problematic for more than one reason, but maybe he’d manage to get the ingredients in Knockturn Alley and brew it himself.
Draco looks outside the window. The red brick of the building opposite of his shimmers in the strong midday sunlight. “I don’t suffer.”
Harry bites his lip before he answers. “I don’t think so. He’s gone. He’s really gone. There must be some other explanation.”
When Draco’s sure that his legs are steady, he starts walking towards the bedroom but stops after a few steps. “Do you mind if I take the bed?”
Following that rule, he goes straight to the potions section, still thinking where he should start. Miranda Barkley, poisoned by an unknown substance. He has the files with him that include testimonies, the report from St Mungo’s, and results of the medical tests, so when he’s in the right section, he stops and looks over them again.
“I’ll ask you some questions, Draco, all right? I want you to know that I’m not doubting you–I just want you to think, to look closer at some aspects of your life.”
Draco touches the soft material. All right, he was wrong—this robe is definitely more expensive than the ones he owns.
Draco feels how his lips purse instinctively before he makes an effort to stop it. “I’m trying to be responsible.”
The bed is all he needs right now—soft enough to soothe the pain in his legs that came from a few minutes of kneeling, with the bedspread perfect to soak in his tears.
“We’re very happy that we finally have a chance to meet you, Draco,” she says, taking a seat next to her husband.
“Hey. Hey,” a voice calls to him, and Draco can’t place it. It seems to be coming from nowhere and everywhere; maybe it’s a voice inside his head; maybe it’s the Dark Lord speaking directly to him.
Draco nods. He feels too insecure to ask for comfort, but he manages to shuffle closer to Harry. He puts his head on Harry’s shoulder, a wave of drowsiness hitting him shortly after.
They stand in the middle of the living room, a safe distance from each other. Draco could take a step forward or extend his arm, and it wouldn’t change much—they would still be far from one another, like ships at a sea.
Angelique is at a conference in France, and Draco needs to wait more than a week for an appointment. That’s fine. He had decided to notify the Ministry about the pain in his arm, and doing it was
But Harry’s hands move quickly, and soon he cracks the egg on the edge of the counter and empties the insides into the bowl, and the whole thing is over.
Draco grunts. He knew that this moment of peace wouldn’t last for long. “Well, if you expect me to go, then—”
“Sorry I’m interrupting,” he says. “I’m about to go home and was told you were here.” He runs a hand through his hair, looking incredibly awkward and out of place.
It was scary, but on top of inducing fear it was also humiliating. There was something in that moment that made him feel less human, and Draco didn’t understand that. These people hadn’t done anything horribly bad to him. They hadn't caused any physical harm, hadn’t threatened him. Yet, when he was putting his robe back on, his fingers were shaking, and when he was back in his cell, alone, he felt dirty.
Harry goes to the kitchen with his bag, and Draco quietly follows him. He watches as Harry unpacks all the ingredients onto the counter and then stares at them, as if not knowing what to do next.
“I love you so much, Draco. I know that everything between us is complicated, but I’ll do anything… anything to help you. If you let me, and if you want me to.”
“But I’ve had nightmares before,” Draco interrupts impatiently. “I’ve had many nightmares over the years.”
“I’m working on a case where a person has been poisoned, and I’m having trouble identifying the potion. I have access to the Library of the Dark Arts—perhaps you know that—but I found absolutely no lead there which makes me think that maybe it isn’t a Dark potion, that maybe someone combined two common potions with the intention of causing harm this way.”
“Because it was a long time ago, and I changed. I didn’t know how to trust people, but now I do. I trust you, and I don’t want you to suffer. I just don’t want you to suffer anymore.”
“Maybe. She still wants to check my arm for nerve damage. To be honest, I’m not very enthusiastic about going to St Mungo’s. It feels like a never-ending, exhausting cycle of showing my arm to everyone.”
“I’m also glad,” Draco answers. He’s surprised to find that his voice sounds choked. He thought it would be easier.
“Draco, it’s not like that. That’s not what I meant. If you’re feeling pain, it’s not fair to say that you’re imagining it. That experience is real.”
“It is. You think you’re evil.  You think you’re a horrible person because you’ve made mistakes. You can talk to me about that. You don’t have to deal with it just on your own.”
Draco could swear the blood in his veins turns physically cold when he hears it. “I don’t see a reason why you’d care,” he says coolly.
“I know.” She studies him for a moment before continuing. “What distresses you the most about this situation?”
“Did you tell him to go and invite me for that dinner because you thought I would have a harder time explaining myself to him?”
Some people would say that he’s faking it, or that him acting this way is unfair, but Draco has his reasons. There are things he has to deal with it, and he’ll deal with them, in his own time.
“Oh, no. You’re just… You’re not like him. It’s obviously clear that you’re family, but—” Harry stops abruptly. “Why are you asking?”
“But maybe I should. Maybe I should, because—” Draco’s voice gets stuck in his throat. He’s barely able to finish the sentence. “Every time I look at it, I get reminded of what you did, so I think it’s only fair that you get to experience that, too.”
Draco slowly manages to push the memory out of his mind. The last thing he sees is his father’s face, gazing at him as they are lying on the floor, twisted in a combination of pain and fear, lacking its usual aristocratic dignity, lacking even anger.
He reaches out with the intent to grab the book and carry it to the section it belongs to, but when his fingers are mere inches from the hardback, he stops.
“Good?” Harry whispers, and this time it’s him burying his hand in Draco’s hair, slowly massaging his scalp.
When he gets back to his flat, he hugs Harry closely. He lets himself feel his warmth. He lets himself be comforted by it.
“Well, I planned to bake one and bring it here, but then I changed my mind because I thought it would be better to come here as soon as I was free.”
. It’s incorrectly placed, and Draco feels a wave of irritation welling up in him. How is he supposed to find anything here if the books are scattered all over the place?
Under the covers, he rolls up the sleeve and touches the raised edges of the scar he knows will never disappear.
“I’m sorry.” His words are quiet but clear. He opens his mouth to say more but can’t. He wanted to say so much more—he had this whole thing planned, but now he no longer knows what he’s apologising for. Almost killing their son? His father almost killing their daughter? Being on the side that took away their other son? Taking Harry, their precious almost-son Harry, and marking him with his own darkness?
Draco leans in and asks Harry in a whisper if he could leave them for a moment. It isn’t exactly the best manners, but he figures neither the Weasleys nor Harry would particularly care. Asking Harry to give them a moment alone is certainly better than dragging the Weasleys somewhere. It’s the best chance he has.
“Let’s say that I could look past it. Still, how can I talk to you about it when you’ve had to deal with the exact same problem even longer?” He looks at Harry’s scar, then back into Harry’s eyes. “How dare I talk to you about it? I served the same person who did this to you.”
“Yes. I’m here.” Draco shifts his weight to the other foot, trying to stop himself from commenting on Weasley’s weird behaviour.
Draco shakes his head so furiously he gets dizzy. Harry falls quiet. Draco thinks to himself that he’s being dramatic—that’s all. Pathetic. Shouting and almost crying because of a stupid picture.
She looks at him patiently, and after a moment of getting no further reaction, asks, “How are you feeling?”
“It’s important. I won’t let you suffer.” Harry looks at him with such intensity that Draco has to look away.
When they part, Draco sees the familiar desperation in Harry’s expression, in the way he glances from Draco’s lips to his eyes, over and over again. He knows it would be best to stop it now.
That is, it seems like a good thing until Harry raises his arm to push his hair all the way back, exposing his forehead and the scar that Draco—once again—has trouble to ignore. This time, however, Draco’s staring doesn’t go unnoticed.
Without surfaces that could reflect his image, he closes his eyes and unbuttons his shirt. The act, after all these years passed, still feels almost reckless. Theoretically, it should be comforting to be able to change his clothes without having to overly pay attention to the surroundings, without the fear that someone could see his Dark Mark and discover his big, nasty secret. Practically, he hasn’t reached the stage yet when it all feels like the past, not the present.
Draco closes his eyes. Sometimes, he still can’t stand how ridiculous everything is. Him lying on a crappy bed in a rented flat in an obscure village in the south. Him lying there with
“Great.” Harry’s face and voice are marked with anger. “Well, let me know when you’ve made up your mind.”
Harry starts to sway him, making them dance in silence. Maybe there is some song playing in his head, as he seems quite committed to the movements.
“Yeah. And I saw what it looked like—Voldemort telling you that it was either you torturing Rowle or him torturing you. What a great choice.”
Draco looks up. He’s surprised that she decided to address him by his name. He’s surprised that she acts so casual, as if they’re a pair of old friends catching up with each other’s lives, bickering as if their past has always been bright and simple.
Draco can’t believe that he’s almost forgotten Harry’s there, even though he’s clinging to him, even though he can feel the warmth of his body through his clothes and skin.
Harry wanted them to go somewhere for the weekend—away from their flats, away from the familiar surroundings—so now they’re in a small town on the Yorkshire Coast, taking endless walks on the beaches.
It turns out to be surprisingly hard to find other words to express himself. “I worry you might think I’m lying or simply imagining things.”
“Don’t expect me to make some sudden, unrealistic progress. Just because I told you, doesn’t mean that now everything is perfect.”
Then, there is the third category, consisting mostly of people who have no connections to him or his family. They look at him with a hint of suspicion, as if he’s a strange animal that they’ve never seen before, captured in a cage he doesn’t belong in. Alternatively, they eye him with gentle curiosity, as if kindly wondering who has let him in here.
Draco has never been brave enough to go to any of the Muggle places. He feels he shouldn’t. He feels that this territory is forbidden for him after all he’s done. Angelique has tried to encourage him to challenge these thoughts, to venture out and see for himself that he can be a part of the society as a whole, not just his small corner of wizards.
Draco almost tells him the whole truth, here and now, impulsively. It boils under his skin, aching to get out. “I can’t—” he chokes out.
Draco closes his eyes. His chest feels funny, and he can’t really assign the sensation to any concrete category.
Draco shakes his head. He can’t imagine talking with people in a state like this—so shaken, so pathetic, so
Every time Harry gives him head, Draco is surprised by how intense it feels. The worst thing is that it’s not like he gets phenomenal satisfaction from engaging in any sex acts—it’s rather that the rest of his life is surprisingly bland. Any time he experiences pleasure, he’s almost shocked that he still has the capacity for it.
“There are so many things I regret,” Draco says after a while. “I don’t know how anyone can look at me and see past them. I don’t know how you can do it.”
When he thinks he has adjusted to the pain well enough, he straightens up and starts walking in circles, trying to somehow mentally prepare himself for the meeting, to clear his head. Every second of delay means that he’s making the risk of enraging the Dark Lord higher, but he’s not ready. He can’t face Him. He’s not ready.
Draco tries to distance himself from the sting these words cause him. “You went to the Chamber of Secrets one year later to save Ginny Weasley, even though you knew it was guarded by a basilisk.”
Draco hears some commotion, and when he opens his eyes, he sees Harry getting off the bed. He stands up, turns around and looks at Draco with what Draco assumes is strenuously mustered neutrality.
When Draco crawls out of the fireplace in his living room, he gets startled by the sight of Harry sitting on the couch.
He only realises he’s shaking when Harry shuffles towards him, tugging at their joint hands in the process. He looks at his skinny fingers trembling in Harry’s grip, trying to stop them from moving on their own accord, but it’s all for nothing. Actually, the more he tries to take control over his body, the worse the shaking becomes.
Draco takes a deep breath and puts his hands down. When he speaks, his voice is shaky. “I don’t know what to do, Harry. I guess I deserved it all. All the nightmares that I have, the fact that I can’t stand looking at myself, that I can’t stand people looking at me, that I feel like I need to hide all the time… It’s all just the price that I pay for my mistakes.”
He’s crouched in front of the couch, watching a slight frown on Harry’s face. He wonders if it’s because of yesterday, if it’s because of him.
“Why are you telling me that?” Draco blurts out before he can stop himself. “I mean, you and Harry work together, and me and Harry—”
Angelique’s office is distinctly cosy. Everything is in blues and beiges, the curtains are light and move with the slightest windblow, and the armchair Draco’s sitting on is plush, soft to the touch. It’s the exact kind of decor his parents would turn their noses at. It’s not that Draco particularly cares about what they think—it’s just a habit to take their opinions into consideration, for the smallest of moments before Draco remembers that it all doesn’t matter. Maybe he’s a sponge that has soaked in all of his parents’ thoughts and now needs to slowly release them. Maybe one day he’ll get rid of them all.
Draco drops to his knees, determined to finish what he started, to completely destroy the picture, but then he picks up a piece that just manages to capture Harry’s face, directly staring at the lense with an expression of shock.
Draco doesn’t know what to say. He thinks about Harry, on a broom, in the burning Room of Requirements. He remembers Harry trying to pull him onto that broom, remembers his own sweaty hands sliding out of his grip. He remembers clinging to Harry’s middle so tightly, so desperately. The memory alone is almost enough to make him suffocate again.
When he wakes up, he can already smell food. Sausages and fried onions—Merlin, he hasn’t even known he was that hungry.
He doesn’t like Harry looking at his body either. He knew since their first date (if one can even call it such) that he would rather let Harry see his dick than his arms or chest. So, the first time they wanked each other, Draco had his shirt on. Then the second time, and third, and so on.
After breakfast, Draco goes for a walk. He doesn’t do it often, but he feels like he needs it today. He needs to clear his head.
It’s completely bright outside. The sunlight illuminates the room, making the worry on Harry’s face seem even more pronounced.
“We don’t have to talk about it now,” Harry suggests hesitantly. He looks like he’s scared Draco will break at the tiniest sign of anything troublesome.
“You thought you didn’t deserve to look at me… but you thought that I deserved to be with you? With my Death Eater past? How does that make sense?”
Draco doesn’t really know what to do with that. He takes one egg and turns it in his hand pointlessly.
“There’s nothing to apologise for. You didn’t know.” Draco buries his hand in Harry’s thick hair, strokes it back. “I should’ve talked to you about this a long time ago.”
“We have a case of Miranda Barkley, 67, poisoned at the wedding of her daughter. She survived, but we have a problem with identifying the potion and the person behind it.”
can’t go around clinging to the past as if it’s the only thing you have! The things you did years ago are not the only things you’ve ever done.”
“Do you want to stay here for the night?” Harry asks when Draco gets to the point of nearly dozing off.
Now his mind is filled with vivid images—the Ministry officials yanking up his sleeve. People in the Ministry halls shooting him angry looks on the daily. The first time Draco looked at the fresh scars on his face, in the Hogwarts’ hospital wing, trying to not cry.
Something rises within Draco’s chest—anger or maybe simply desperation. He doesn’t answer, instead he clenches his fists and continues breathing deeply, trying to calm himself down. Now that he’s more aware of his surroundings, he can also feel his robes clinging to his sweaty body. If it wasn’t for Harry being around, he’d take them off. This thought makes him even more angry.
“Why would I be telling you what to do? It would look like I’m being sorry for myself. Oh, poor Draco doesn’t know how to deal with anything that is slightly inconvenient. He clearly needs a saviour, doesn’t he?”
Weasley makes a face, as if not sure whether he should take the cake offer as an insult or not. “Look. I know my mother, and one thing I can tell you is that she is bloody stubborn. Next week everyone’s busy, so you have a rare chance to visit when almost no one’s home. Unless that house is something that still disgusts you, then just tell me, and I’ll let my mother know that you’ll never put your foot there.”
He quickly gets onto his feet, his heart still beating wildly in his chest from being startled, and looks at the person behind him.
It was fair to be asked those questions. Even back then, terrified that he could spend the rest of his life imprisoned, Draco knew that lying wouldn’t take him far. Deciding to not talk also wouldn’t be the best choice—Draco had witnessed many more crimes than he himself had committed, so he had a unique chance to show the Ministry that he was cooperating, that he had changed. He hoped that it would lower his sentence, and the fact that he was exposing to the fullest the true, disgusting nature of people he’d grown to deeply hate was an added bonus.
He can’t leave the country. He got his job because the Ministry deemed his knowledge useful, and because his counselor stated that the danger of him getting back on the path of the Dark Magic was minimal.
He looks up at Harry, shocked by the begging tone. Once again, he asks himself what the hell he’s even doing. He was supposed to act more responsible. He didn’t want to cause Harry so much pain. He expected Harry to be angry with him after their last confrontation, after Draco’s stupid show of unfounded hostility. Foolishly, he didn’t expect him to be just hurt and worried.
Draco doesn’t answer at first, instead he looks back at Harry, and for a moment they eye each other in silence.
“Not really fair of me to put you in a situation where you need to face something you might not want to or be ready to face.”
Draco laughs before he’s able to stop himself. “It was a common courtesy to ask you. I’m not afraid of your germs.”
Harry goes back to stroking, this time picking Draco’s arm to rub small circles on. He never touches his forearm, even though it’s Draco’s right hand—not the left one, even though his arm is covered with a long, long sleeve.
“Draco, I don’t understand what’s going on with you. Did something happen? At the dinner?” Harry’s expression shifts from mad to worried. “Oh, Merlin, did they say something to you?”
Draco needs a few more days to put his messy thoughts into some kind of order. Eventually, he decides it would be better to talk with Harry than to write him a letter.
The kiss ends, and Harry settles beside him, lays his head on Draco’s chest and slowly caresses the soft fabric of his shirt.
“It’s faint, but it hurts,” Draco says, his voice still shaking. He feels like a child, woken up at night because of a nightmare, complaining about pain, complaining about being scared of something he knows should be impossible.
“I didn’t think you would do it.” When Draco looks up, he sees that Harry’s eyes are shining with excitement.
“Do you both always talk like that, or is it only because I’m around?” Granger asks when Harry disappears into the kitchen.
“Oh, actually, if you don’t mind, Hermione…” he says at one point. “I have a question. It’s not a personal one, don’t worry.”
Baking doesn’t exactly turn out to be a success. Draco wastes a couple more eggs by either completely smashing them or getting too many shells into the bowl. The sponge comes out of the oven a bit too dry, and the cream they make is too runny, so that the assembled cake looks like a mess.
Being emotional and crying exhausts Draco to the point of falling asleep. He wakes up alone. He hopes that Harry knows he isn’t terribly mad with him—after all, if Draco was truly angry, he would have left Harry’s flat altogether.
Under the table, Harry takes his hand and squeezes shortly before letting go. Draco turns his head to look at him and realises it might be a mistake. Harry’s eyes are so full of love. He looks at Draco with indescribable tenderness, and Draco has no idea how to deal with it.
Draco’s gaze jumps between them until he makes a decision. Granger’s expression is completely neutral, no signs of resentment. Harry looks quite unsure of what he should do.
“I will always live with conflicted feelings. I will always—” his voice gets stuck in his throat, and he breathes through it, trying to unclog his airways somehow. He still sounds choked when he slowly says, “I will always love you.”
“Ron and Hermione were supposed to come, but Ron came down with a terrible flu…” Molly explains. “Hermione is caring for him, poor thing. I just hope she doesn’t get sick, too.”
“I’ve been doing horrible, horrible things throughout my entire life. Don’t you think I deserve a punishment for that?”
They’re sitting on the same couch where this picture was taken. That day, Harry looked unsure and lost. Today, he looks lost and a bit mad. At first, Draco has no idea why Harry could be mad at him, but he quickly gets to know the reason.
Harry’s reaction was fair, to be honest. Draco only ever saw his grandparents wearing robes like these—Victorian, with lace accents and ruffled sleeves. Even his parents who respected tradition steered towards modern clothing, accepting that some things simply go out of fashion.
Harry leans forward a little more. “I don’t know how it used to look before, but there’s no sign of black ink. I see nothing abnormal, no skin irritation. It just looks like a scar.” He looks up. “Does it still hurt?”
Draco collects his robe from the floor and puts it on while Harry lingers in the doorframe. Draco looks at him expectedly.
. Him being alive at all. Him having sex with the saviour of the wizarding world, as if that’s a thing a former Death Eater does. Having his cock out but never—
“You don’t leave this bloody place,” Harry says quietly. His voice doesn’t carry the spite that Draco almost misses now.
Draco looks down at the table. He doesn’t believe Harry. Even though he’s aware that it’s slowly destroying him, it feels like a small, insignificant issue. Who cares if he doesn’t look at himself? Isn’t that just a pathetic coping mechanism that a person as weak as him would develop after a while?
“I cared about the detention Snape gave me. I thought it was unfair.” Harry laughs bitterly, and Draco is scared of this laughter. “Do you understand it? I almost killed you through my own stupidity, and the only thing I cared about was the fact that those detentions collided with the Quidditch matches.”
Draco recognises the stiffness in her voice—it’s the same tone he uses when he’s uncomfortable, when he tries to mask his true feelings.
Well, he sees some bits. He sees scars on Draco’s neck and jaw, and that’s more than enough. He tries not to look, though—Draco notices that. Harry glances and stares at his eyes, lips, cheekbones whenever they spend time together, but rarely below.
He asked if anyone had ever actually attacked him—face red and all—to which Draco only replied with a laughter.
He goes straight to the bedroom to grab his sleep robe and then follows to the bathroom. His hands fumble with the buttons of the robe he’s wearing on the way there, but only when he locks himself in the familiar room with blue tiles and foggy mirror, he takes it off fully.
Well, Draco was right—Harry’s flat is always full of people. Friends, old acquaintances, work colleagues—always someone. “Feeling better, Weasley?”
Sometimes people stare at him. He’s not stupid enough to wear robes when he goes for walks in Muggle areas—obviously—so unusual clothing is not the reason why they pay so much attention to him. He actually thinks he could pass for a regular Muggle, with the jeans and jacket he borrowed from Harry.
“Malfoy,” the voice above him says, the voice that clearly belongs to Ronald Weasley, though Draco still tries not to think about it every time they have to interact.
He releases a shaky breath. He feels so stupid talking about it. He looks at Angelique and asks in a slightly fearful tone, “Do you think it means something?”
He’s already retrieving his hands when Harry grabs one and kisses his knuckles. “You didn’t sleep well. Am I right?” he mutters. Draco’s skin muffles the sound.
When no one answers her, she adds, “Come on, it’s a historical moment. Plus, Harry never uses the camera we gave him for his birthday, so I think we should take the matter into our hands.”
“Don’t,” Harry says on maybe the seventh or eighth night. He gently releases the flask from Draco’s grip and sets it on the bedside table. “You’re going to get addicted.”
“I don’t care if I hurt people’s feelings. I just don’t want them to see me as a copy of my father.”
“Of course it was a joke,” Draco responds, already slightly dizzy from the emotions this talk stirs up in him. He isn’t sure if his previous statement was meant to be taken seriously or not.
Draco huffs a laugh. “You mean—so dry and stiff? It isn’t because of you. For me, it’s just a remnant of being brought up in a family of incredibly pompous people.”
“I’m just here to... Well, my mother would like you to come for dinner on Sunday. Not this one, the next one.”
The flash goes off, and then it’s over. Draco catches out of the corner of his eye Ron pulling his arm from behind Hermione’s back. He feels so jealous of them for posing for a picture like any average couple, while he and Harry can barely even look at each other.
Well, maybe it could be more accurately described as a feeling of superiority. Not even the most powerful wizards could read his mind, so now he can go through any task with a straight face. He can buy his food ignoring all the glares, can walk straight to a free table in the middle of the room with Harry by his side, as if it’s something that has happened hundreds of times before, as if it’s a part of their routine.
“What don’t I understand?” Harry asks with exasperation. “And how am I supposed to understand anything if you don’t tell me what’s going on?”
He can look at Harry without feeling like he’s doing something wrong. The lightning bolt scar doesn’t evoke anything in him anymore—no fear, no compulsion to never look away from it, no guilt. There are no conflicting emotions anymore—there’s just the sight of the person he somehow came to love.
Draco rolls his eyes. “No one said anything to me. I apologised, and they accepted my apology. I’m afraid the conflict between you and me has nothing to do with them.”
Harry doesn’t argue with her—he just gets up and grabs it. He places the camera on the coffee table, adjusts it, announces that they have ten seconds and gets back onto the couch, next to Draco. He doesn’t touch him, but he looks at him for the first time since he brought him the tea, with the same careful, hesitant look.
Harry pulls up the sleeves of his robe. His forearms are hairy and veiny; they look strong in a way Draco’s arms will never even get close to resemble.
“No, not really. I don’t know how to explain it. I thought that maybe you didn’t trust me to look at you without me feeling guilty… And then you’d have to comfort me, which is obviously not something you should ever have to do for me. I just thought I didn’t deserve you giving me a chance.”
Draco thinks about the answer for a moment. What are they even doing right now? It’s been mere minutes since he came back home, and they’re already arguing. But Draco doesn’t know what to do—he doesn’t know how to de-escalate the situation, how to silence his own angry thoughts that Harry is against him, that Harry is attacking him.
“He’s back,” he utters, thinking he’s about to throw up. His heart’s still thumping in his chest so wildly it feels like it will soon break his ribs.
The words sound so fake that he gets detached from them immediately. They escape him, sounding as if they’ve been spoken in an echo chamber. They hit the walls and hollowly multiply—love you, love you,
“Do you want to look at me?” Draco asks. “Or rather not? Would it feel appealing or scary? Or maybe disgusting?”
When Harry reaches for the egg, the thin lines of scar tissue shine on the back of his right hand, and it’s all Draco can focus on. It feels wrong to be looking at it—nevertheless, Draco can’t bring himself to look away.
He swallows Harry’s come because it’s something that comes from within him, because it is protectively hidden behind his skin and flesh, not tainted by the human gaze, because it is pure.
“I really am happy for you both,” Harry said as he grabbed a few tissues and blew his nose. “All I’ve ever wanted for Remus and for you is happiness. You’d better give them both the world.”
“Of course it would! Charlie will be there and Luna is one of your biggest fans!” Harry smirked. “Plus, bringing you will make her forget all about my lack of a gift.”
“I’m hardly religious, love,” Harry chuckled. “But it does seem rather poetic. A book shop worker and an actor marrying in the parish of one of their favorite playwrights.”
“I find that hard to believe. He’s still broken up about Remus and it’s been years,” Draco retorted skeptically. “He’s always a mix of happy and sad when he’s around him. Remus broke his heart.”
Lockhart backhanded him in the mouth. “You’ve been telling tales about me, Draco. You didn’t want him getting mad that we had a goodbye fuck before I moved to New York. So, you went and cried rape.”
“So, Draco, what is it that you do?” Ernie asked as Draco made Harry and himself Cosmopolitans at the bar.
“I think you’d be better off doing something small scale right now. Get your feet wet before jumping back into any big projects. Ever thought about starting a YouTube channel? I think you’d be brilliant doing something like that,” Harry suggested.
“Harry I’m scared,” Draco said for what felt like the ten thousandth time since Harry agreed to help the Olivia catch Lockhart. Harry was starting Lockhart’s class the next day, and Draco was rightfully nervous and terrified for his lover. Harry focused on running them a bath and choosing a Kind Poppy bath bomb. He tosses in a London Fog and steps in. He motions for Draco to join him.
“Harry, you’re very talented,” Lockhart began. It was just after Midterms, and Lockhart insisted on meeting with each of them individually to discuss their grades. “Which is why your Midterm grade was something of a disappointment to me.” Harry’s Midterm had a big fat red ‘D+’ on it. “This could jeopardize your academic scholarship.”
“We’ll get him back. I don’t know how, but we will,” Remus said determinedly. Just then, the phone rang.
“Liv reached out to the owner of the adult magazine I worked for. She made some rather interesting discoveries,” Draco positively glowed.
“I was rather hoping you’d still be in bed when I woke up,” Draco said as he wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist. Harry gave him a drawn out kiss and a cup of coffee made just the way he likes it.
“You’re going to be in good hands, Har,” Rolf smiled at Hermione, who was standing in the doorway with a cup of Harry’s favorite tea in hand. “Mione’s fantastic.”
“Well, I’ve got…” Harry rummaged through the door on the fridge. He mumbled under his breath, “to fucking shop.”
“I do. Harry’s love is a once in a lifetime thing. He gives without asking for anything in return. He’s a special man with a big heart,” Remus pulled back and wiped his eyes with a handkerchief. “I know you don’t like me, but I’m hoping we can work towards friendship.”
“I promise you, nothing’s going on and nothing will start,” Sirius gave his husband a series of sweet gentle kisses. Remus relented and kissed him back. “If anything had happened, I would have come clean about it already.”
“Get your hands off me!” Draco Malfoy exclaimed, taking a step back. “Thanks. This is exactly what my brand new shirt needed. A bit of orange coloring.”
“Gods, yes. But, I figured they would because this is their first holiday without Teddy.” Remus and Sirius had finalized the adoption the month after Harry and Draco reconciled. They were doting parents, though predictably so, Siri was far more lax than Remus. Siri definitely enjoyed the ‘fun parent’ role. “You and Charlie should come by tonight. We’re having pizza and s’mores!”
“Have you seen my glasses?” Harry asked. Harry only wore glasses when he read or watched the telly for long periods of time. “Draco’s taking me out to the cinema.”
“What’s this?” Lockhart suddenly spun him around, pulling Harry towards him by the chain of the necklace. “I knew you were a plant. Who put you up to this?” He shoved Harry against the wall and began choking him. “Was is my whore of an ex? His friends? That nosy American investigator? Answer me!” He loosened his grip on Harry so he could talk.
“Let’s watch the episode and see if we see you!” Harry said excitedly as he logged into his Netflix account.
“I knew my obliviousness would pay off one day,” Ernie said proudly as Remus came in with the takeaway and told everyone to come eat.
Draco shuffled the sheets over his head for weeks whenever Harry entered the room. Until one day Draco had managed to rally his courage and exist around Harry. Harry began to bring food from the kitchen, explaining that he was friendly with the elves, and Draco began to eat. They continued their routine then, with brief but friendly conversations and life moved on.
He had been asleep for what felt like months, there was really no need to be awake. He had packed appropriately with all his best clothes. He knew it would be rough; he knew he was a traitor, and a coward, so he thought he should at least look good doing it.
“We are friends,” Harry stated dismissively when understanding dawned on him and he had to force his jaw closed.
Finally, Harry gave one firm squeeze to Draco’s cock and Draco came back arching into the air and a scream pulling from him. He saw nothing but white as his nerves tingled and danced in pleasure. He only began to come down when he felt kisses being pressed all over his face.
“We are not. You want to leave, you’re just telling yourself you don’t and since I’m quite tired of the room smelling of cigarettes, you are coming with me to lunch.” Harry seemed smug as he spoke.
"New leaf," Draco spoke, eyes kept distinctly on his shoes, ones that had been expertly shined earlier that day. He thought the password was cheesy and stupid, but had no one to speak that opinion to, and was sure no one cared to listen. Dumbledore nodded and his painting swung to reveal a common room.
Harry liked to take care of people he had found, when he had first arrived back at Hogwarts he felt despair at having to live on past the war, empty and without motive but when Draco had appeared in his life again he had something worthwhile again. At first, he was happy to have someone to bicker with, but Draco had stomped that flame out with a genuine apology.
Draco began to bob his head, pleased to hear the hitch, moan, and curse on Harry’s breath as he did so. Harry’s fingers dug into Draco’s scalp and just when Draco placed his hand on Harry’s balls, Harry screamed.
As Draco rolled his luggage behind him, he rested in the sound of the clunk that the wheels made when meeting the cobblestone path up to what was supposedly the "eighth-year" dorms.
He rolled slightly and picked at the room temperature grapes Tilly had brought him several nights ago, stomach yearning for something more. He knew better than to call upon Tilly though, having no desire to feel the rot of his past creeping up his throat again.
Draco was certain he would rot out his lungs with his habits, but nonetheless, he lent down and pulled his cigarette pack from his luggage and lit it by the tip of his mother’s wand. The nicotine rushed to his brain and soothed his nerves that had been screaming ever since he set foot on Hogwart’s cobblestone.
“Can you-” Draco didn’t like the gravel in his voice so he cleared his throat, “could you summon my things from beside the pool?”
Draco sucked in a gasp of cool air. He didn’t want the food anymore, his stomach churned at the very thought. He bent down and placed the food lightly on the side table next to his bed, banished his cigarette, and waved his mother’s wand to summon the house elf. The elf popped up right in front of Draco.
“Lots of sugar, splash of milk.” Harry’s breath was on Draco’s neck and Draco shivered involuntarily.
Draco gazed dreamily at the tanned skin and black rat's nest next to him. He had woken before Harry. The brunette’s face looked so young when he slept, no longer a war veteran but just a boy.  If he got really close, he could see a speckling of freckles dancing across Harry’s nose.
“Alright then.” Harry stood swiftly then and walked over to his own bed. Draco couldn’t help the way his body flopped down onto his mattress without the support of Harry’s presence to hold him up.
Draco hadn’t yet been able to calm the tears running down his face when Harry brushed under his eyes with his thumbs. Draco found himself shivering with the force of his emotions. Silently, Harry crawled onto Draco’s bed after toeing off his shoes and held Draco again.
Harry leaned down to place a possessive kiss on Draco’s lips, and Draco was pleasantly surprised by the lump that touched his stomach from between Harry’s thighs.
Harry reached out and put his hands on either side of Draco’s face and brought Draco towards him. This time Harry was prepared, and the kiss was passionate. Draco felt high on Harry’s breath alone as they kissed each other so deeply he felt he was touching Harry’s soul.
Slowly, painstakingly slowly, Harry stood them both and wrapped Draco in the nearest towel. Harry scooped Draco in his arms and Draco clung to his shoulders like a lifeline. Draco felt more than heard Harry cast a drying and warming spell over the both of them.
Draco pulled away to look at Harry, and he knew that he had done something he would regret. Harry’s eyes were shocked and his lips parted as if he just didn’t have the words.
“Tilly” Her eyes gazed up at Draco's, he attempted to keep his own eyes kind under the stress of the situation.
Draco’s tear threatened to fall as he looked up at the ceiling. Suddenly, there was a weight next to him, Potter had sat down.
Potter left for his next class and Draco laid back on his bed. He didn’t know how to feel about Potter’s outburst, but he doubted their newfound truce would last the week.
Harry had suggested they go down to the kitchens for dinner since not many students had stayed back; it wouldn’t be a bother to the elves. Draco had eventually agreed after some placating.
Deciding to walk toward his first class and sit outside the door in the hall was his plan. It proved to be a stupid plan that made him susceptible to stinging hex after another when he nodded off. His skin boiled where the hexes had struck and he shielded himself with a textbook, feeling rather deserving of the ambush that only calmed when the day’s first professor walked out of his door to investigate.
“Hermione and Ron are spending lunch in the library so you don’t have to worry about them,” Harry said as he heaped a large serving of mashed potatoes onto his plate.
Shaking his head in a dull effort to clear it, he started towards the stairs that he hoped led him to a bed, maybe with a pillow, he could scream into. The stairs were short and when he arrived at the top, he looked above the first door to his right, to a plaque that read to his horror "Malfoy & Potter".
“No.” The word had passed Draco’s lips in a curl of smoke before he could even think to stop himself.
“Harry rested his head in the crook of Draco’s shoulder and nodded. Draco reached between them and placed his hand on the soft pajama bottoms that held back Harry's throbbing member. Harry grunted and pushed into Draco’s hand. Draco’s own cock was throbbing with blood by the second. Harry moved the collar of Draco’s shirt and began to suck a love bite on the crook of his neck. The noise that escaped Draco was nearly pornographic, and Harry chuckled in satisfaction. Draco began to slip his hand under Harry’s shirt and over the planes of his stomach and chest. Slowly he worked his back down towards the more pressing issue and graced his hand into Harry’s pants. Harry wasn’t wearing any underwear, which made his gut clench desperately as his hand roamed some short curls before brushing Harry’s member. Harry groaned again as Draco slipped him out of his pants, seeing that Harry was impressively large.
Draco was taken back by Harry’s directness, they hadn’t spoken to each other for days on end but now he had the audacity to order Draco about and what was worse, Draco wanted to listen. Draco didn’t think of himself as easily bossed around, but something within him wanted to do what Harry said. Probably, Draco thought, it was Harry’s Gryffindor ability to lead people into danger as he had done most of his life.
Soon, much too soon, the water felt like nothing at all; the wind lapping at the freezing water didn’t phase his body.
Draco drooped at hearing that he had not in fact murdered an innocent, the fight leaking out of him. He noted the cool tear stains on his cheeks while he tried desperately to catch his breath.
“Bloody Gryffindor Savior with a hero complex trying to drag me out of my own bedroom! The nerve!” Draco slid into his robes and stood at the door, tapping his foot impatiently.
“I’m afraid not, unless you’re looking for some lingerie, then yes I have,” Draco spoke and then felt his body go rigid, why in the world had he said that?
“I think I’ll stay here, the Weasleys invited me of course but I don’t know, without Fred it seems so wrong and Ginny will be there.”  Harry looked empty for a moment before shrugging. Draco was reminded forcefully that the Weasleys were missing a son and his heart ached for the people he was raised to hate.
He sits down at the table and waits for Harry to finish up frying. Plates and cutlery are already set, and they are all in the wrong order, but Draco won’t say it. He isn’t allowed to say it because it isn’t good manners. He’s only allowed to smirk knowingly at other guests when the host isn’t looking, but there are no other guests here. He closes his eyes.
He bites his lip, annoyed at the mere thought. That’s who he is—still a coward at twenty-six. Wanting to sneak into his boyfriend’s bathroom to steal things from him instead of getting them himself. He’s so pathetic.
But perhaps that was the moment of a horrible realisation for Draco—his whole life story could be told from reading the lines on his skin. There was no escape from who he was, and there never would be.
, but he survived it. The biggest problem is that it has brought back a bunch of unpleasant memories that now clog up his mind.
Harry doesn’t answer. Draco figures he must have made him uncomfortable. This whole conversation might have been one huge mistake.
Over the next few weeks, Draco solves the Miranda Barkley case. He goes to his appointment at St Mungo’s with Harry and gets to know that the nerves in his arm aren’t damaged. He talks to Angelique about it, and also about the new openness in the relationship between him and Harry, about difficult conversations and the progress he’s hoping to make.
“Is something wrong?” Harry asks, rubbing the skin above his right eye and looking at Draco suspiciously.
Sometimes he worries that the reason why they stare is because they can read his mind, that they somehow know who he used to be, what he used to think of them, what he wanted to do to them. Then, he remembers that he has pronounced scars on his face. He remembers that his hair is almost white.
When he reaches his bedroom, he’s still cautious but less paranoid. Quietly, he opens the door and sees that the room is empty.
“I was shocked, Draco. I didn’t…” Harry shakes his head, as if trying to shake off the unpleasant memories. “I didn’t…”
Still, when Harry looks up from between his legs, Draco wants to assure him that he did good. He gestures for him to come closer and kisses him with what he thinks is enough intensity and passion.
He gets out of bed feeling—surprisingly—almost energised and goes to the kitchen barefoot, ignoring the cold emanating from the wooden tiles.
“Right,” Harry says, as if only now coming to his senses. Draco isn’t looking at him, but soon he can hear the sound of the window opening, and then he feels the chill night breeze surrounding him.
But instead of asking any of these questions, Draco’s thoughts circle back to his own pretty dysfunctional family, even though he hates thinking about it. Growing up, he didn’t have a full picture of the world around him. He knew things his parents wanted him to know, and many of the things they shared were incredibly biased.
Draco grunts. “It wasn’t a big argument. We made up the next day.” He stops to think. “Actually, there’s this one thing. The day before I had that nightmare, I felt quite strange. I don’t know why. I really don’t know why. I couldn’t look at Harry’s scar, you know, the one…” He touches his forehead, directly above his right brow, and laughs stupidly. He feels his hand trembling as he brings it down. “I mean, I felt both like I couldn’t stop staring at it, and like I never wanted to see it again.”
His family had this book at home. It’s quite probable that what’s in front of him is the exact same exemplar his father used to hold in his hands.
Draco shudders at the name and closes his eyes briefly. “No. Never. Why would it ever happen? He’s dead.” He spits the last sentence angrily. “I went to the Ministry last week, and they performed the spells to check if my Mark shows any signs of activity.” He finally looks back at her. “It’s inactive. I guess we can all sleep peacefully.”
“It’s not that hard after some practice. You need a sharp edge, like the edge of a bowl. If your counter has square edges, you can do it there. I prefer to do it this way.”
Things quickly get back to normal after that one verbal confrontation. Life goes on, and the first thing that deviates from the routine is the Sunday dinner at the Weasley’s.
Allowing the shirt to fall from his shoulders, his eyes catch the scar on his forearm, white and faint. His eyes always seem to go there, even though he never wants them to. He’s still scared to touch it, scared that pressing his fingers to the skin there will summon
It’s a perfect distance to cast a spell, though—short enough for it to hit quickly, short enough to drastically reduce the other person’s ability to defend themselves.
Draco looks into the corner of the room, where there’s a big plant in a big brown pot. It looks healthy with its vibrant green leaves—Harry must be nurturing it well. “Why do you use certain spells at a given moment? When you have some time to think, you can choose a concrete spell with a specific aim. When you need to act quickly, you probably use your instinct and reflexes.”
Harry walks over to the couch and sits on the armrest. He doesn’t look at Draco when he speaks. “When I was younger, there were times when I was so scared that I was just like Voldemort. I was so terrified. I could do things he could do, like speaking Parseltongue. I could see what he saw, literally, as if I was using his eyes.”
Draco makes his way towards Harry through the sand that’s shifting under his bare feet with every step he makes. It’s also getting into the spaces between his toes, and the sensation is rather unpleasant. He seemed to have enjoyed it more when he was a child, spending summer holidays with his parents at the Mediterranean Sea. Maybe he enjoyed it more because that sand was warmer, maybe he was too enthusiastic about life—about swimming, playing, watching beautiful views—to pay attention to small discomforts.
Draco lives constantly anticipating something horrible. Right now, as he’s walking through the hall to his bedroom, he looks out for any signs of danger. Who knows what could happen? With the Dark Lord residing here, anything is possible. Maybe the Dark Lord is right around the corner, or maybe at this very moment he’s sitting on Draco’s bed, patiently waiting for his arrival.
She shakes her head. “It’s possible that you may have experienced something we call a pain flashback. The nightmare triggered you, and when you woke up, your nervous system was stuck in re-living the time when your Dark Mark was still active.”
Once again, it turns out that having a casual conversation with Ronald Weasley isn’t actually that hard of a task. What worries Draco more is that Harry appears quiet and withdrawn the entire time. Draco spends the whole evening glancing at Harry over and over again, but Harry never looks back.
