Harry shrugged, trying to test that the locks on his file cabinets hadn’t been tampered with.
“Exactly.” She tossed her straw aside and took a sip from the pitcher’s side. “Then he'll either think my job isn't that big a deal by comparison, or can be mad at the both of us, and where would that leave him? He can’t toss us both.” She nodded at this wisdom. “Now drink up. I’ve still got a lot of this mix left, and the night is young. We can bother fresh starting in the morning.”
“Potter,” he yelled. “Nott Delivery Service. Got a package for you.” Only the wind answered. The doorframe opened into a mostly empty room. Sand had poured between the slats and covered half the floor and a sofa. A faded family photograph hung askew on the wall. Beer cans rolled back, then forward in a corner. At the edges of a discarded magazine, a curved scorpion tail flicked out to rustle the pages.
“Oh, I’m not worried,” Draco said, his first words since they’d changed into the dressing gowns. They’d long discussed this beforehand. “Wouldn’t look good for me to die here. Pretty compromising position.”
“Jenkins? But.” Malfoy paused, his fingers curling. “I’d been working at the Ministry for months.”
Skating closer, Draco paused at the threshold. The employee manual forbade a courier’s entry into unoccupied homes. That probably included skeletons like this one. He reached for the package in his bag, then stopped. The nape of his neck hummed. The cans had stopped moving.
investigating.
The people on either side of them looked at Harry; while Malfoy froze for a moment, his eyes stayed fixed on the food.
“Thought I’d see what the fuss was,” Malfoy said, his words laced with tequila. When he let his lip go, it shone, another beacon, a lighthouse calling Harry home. Harry moved closer, hearing the whisper with which Malfoy added: “The second floor is full of mirrors.”
He cast the same charm on himself once the sun began to set. There were still blocks to go before he reached the restaurant, and the air had gotten sharper on his face and hands. Another benefit to life in Spain: significantly warmer weather.
Malfoy’s chin lifted enough for Harry to track the blond eyebrows drawing together. "The anonymous kind." Malfoy’s voice, too, was soft. "But I think this one has promise. For your Milbourne case.”
As he worked further toward the north end of the city, he saw the homeless population was also much higher here. He paused several times to hand them some of his cash, or to buy a few some warm coffees. For a sleeping man and his dog, he cast the strongest warming charm he knew.
“You’re too young for tweed, Potter.”
Harry finished his mug. “I’m not sure. We finally off one another? Or we just… don’t speak for five days? Can’t really tell which of those is the better outcome.”
“I didn’t know half of this stuff! I mean, the things I did know weren’t great, but they didn’t rise to this.”
The tendril gave a final, violent tug, and the door frame shattered. Draco flew forward toward the circle and the dark.
“You look better in the dark,” Draco said, his voice cracking slightly. Harry tilted his head.
“For a bookstore, maybe. Or one of those cozy hipster coffee shops that are springing up all over New York.” Pansy adjusted her tie, pulling it down until she could undo the collar and top button of her shirt. “Whatever your place was zoned for, it’s still twee. And Charlotte agrees with me.”
“Alright, we’re going, we’re going. See you later, Andy.”
The smile disappeared into a thin line. Malfoy’s gaze was flickering from Harry’s right eye to his left, unable to face on one or the other for too long. “I was surprised. That you actually showed up. You didn’t seem pleased about the news.” He ran his fingers over the rippled edges of the bar napkin. The centre had darkened from the condensation of his drink. “Thought I might show up by myself and MACUSA’d turn me right around.”
A used book store drew both of their attention once they found a magical extension in the back, through an Emergency Exit door. A few Kneazles were stretched out on shelves in beams of sunlight. Harry watched Malfoy approach one, give it several tentative but steady strokes, then disappear into the shelves. Harry went the other way. He wandered by Philosophy, Poetry, and Potions, pausing when he reached a young adult section. The book that stopped him had a boy on the cover with green and faerie wings. It was about embracing yourself and others. Being different. That day with Teddy, Harry hadn’t mentioned Spain or school troubles to him. They’d just flown and flown until Ginny’s game. He grabbed a copy of the book, and a few others as well about coming of age. He collected Malfoy from the Poetry section, once he found him.
Hermione shrugged. “That he was right, maybe. That you’re sorry you disregarded his memos for so long. Maybe that you think he’s fit?”
Harry picked his fork back up. Any topic but Malfoy was a welcome improvement.
. Whatever sound he made as he fell to his knees disappeared into the rising pitch of the wind.
Robards paused, mouth bunching, then said: "Auror Malfoy will be joining you. The Ministry is going to room you together at a nearby Muggle hotel. The rates there are completely obscene, so we won’t be covering your food."
Potter had disappeared from public life before Draco’d left England. Draco’d read the papers back then. Speculation ran wild after the Ministry charged the Wizarding World’s Hero with defacing Godric’s Hollow. Rumour had it he lingered at crime scenes, too, or went back after the fact. It didn’t sit right for Draco, given Potter’s upright image. But he wouldn’t use the word ‘clean’ for Potter either. It was faint, but the compound pulsed with the same dark power as the prior address. Another tainted place Potter seemed to call home.
“‘Mione…” Harry’s throat caught at the words. His tongue felt too thick to speak around, the knot of feelings in his chest pulling his lungs tight.
Robards inclined his head. “My first inclination was to keep him back. Would’ve been a lot easier to just say no. However, Auror Malfoy made me a convincing argument that this conference is particularly relevant to his department, and I am inclined to agree with him, in this specific case. As you know first hand, some of the information he’s identified has been invaluable to our cases over the last few years. He'll only be more useful if he can catch on to some of these new surveillance techniques."
“Tell him what? Am I about to see some drama?”
Malfoy looked him over as he buttoned a cardigan over his light green button up. “California wines? You realise we live a few Apparitions away from the central winemaking vineyards in the world.”
But by now he knew better.
can’t.”
“Then maybe it’s for the best. And who knows, maybe they’ll promote him. That could be an apology in itself.”
The next morning, for the first time since getting home, Harry did not make it to the Ministry early. He didn’t wake up until well after ten. He jumped into his robes and tossed the files in his bags. He could organise them when he got into the office.
“Really, Potter, steps up into the tub? How nouveau riche.”
“Please.” Pansy reached out to adjust Draco’s tie and fringe. "I prefer to call it artful ravishing. Full of youthful vigour that one. Don’t frown like that, darling, you’ll get wrinkles, and then you won’t be alone just because you’re a wilfully blind arse.”
Disdain returned to Draco’s face. “So you’ve just done nothing?”
, I worked for the government. Involuntarily.” Better than Azkaban, but still. “And I think it’s some kind of fish.”
The game lasted three nail-biting hours, and the Harpies clinched the win just so by capturing the snitch. Harry and Teddy watched the stands empty out from their box, then headed down to the pitch with the other families. Teddy ran over immediately to the children of the head coach, training broom bouncing with his steps. Harry watched him, the way he moved without self-consciousness, without hesitation. He was nine, and he acted it. No dark cupboards or chores or crazy prophecies making him older than he needed to be. Harry hadn’t entirely failed him as a godfather.
Harry reached up to adjust his glasses, then pulled his hand back when they met an empty nose. “What do you mean?”
“Mother of Merlin, Malfoy,” Harry said, rounding his other hand around the pulsing of blood at his wrist. He squeezed his eyes shut and tried to breathe around the flush of pain. “What the hell are you doing in there?”
“You were right.” Harry crossed his arms, looking at that day’s combination of baby blue jumper and darker blue slacks. “About that tip. The Muggle tube connection was very helpful.”
Here, he watched the scorpion retreat from the magazine. Its measured steps settled several times on dark lines along the wooden grain. Except it wasn’t the grain. They were runes, a series of them, trailing the edge of a circle. A casting circle.
Malfoy let out a small, pained laugh. “Robards won’t want to deal with that kind of nonsense every time I try to leave the country.” He pushed his fringe back off his face, frowning slightly. “Seemed a bit like a sign, really. A marked man, wherever I go.”
Harry scoffed. “It’s not like they’re subtle about it. Maybe a bit when I graduated the Training Program and got seated right between them—Robards had to have done that intentionally—but I think they went back to it when they realised I wasn’t going to interfere.”
“Is that so?” She waited, inclining her head a little when Harry said nothing more, then went on: “Well, maybe you could raise it with him today. Though I imagine he’d jump on anything that meant more time with you.”
“I don’t think you have to have everything resolved before you present your case to Robards,” Hermione said, keeping her distance. The wrinkle on her nose told Harry all he needed to know.
And yet.
“So?” Malfoy wiped away some sugar from his mouth as he spoke.
When they reached the next street corner, Harry shook his head. “That’s a rude thing to say to a colleague. But fine. If you must know, I forgot about the deadline for my Auror credits.” The street light changed, and he started to cross. “This was the last chance before my certification expired.”
Charm: Keeping Watch While You’re Away.’ ‘At What Cost: Valuing The Right to Privacy When Lives Are At Stake.’ ‘The Magical Applications and Properties of the Panoptic Tower.’
It wasn’t the warmest welcome, but not the worst either.
Draco didn’t say more than was necessary throughout the afternoon. He followed Harry’s lead through the warehouse full of Muggle arcade games; the science museum’s gift store; the bird-laden pier leading to a collection of sun-bathing seals. At points, his hand curled into the bend of Harry’s arm. If Harry looked at the hand, or looked at Draco while he did it, the hand would disappear. But after a while, it would find its way back. At each withdrawal, Harry could steady himself. He’d offered Draco the out, the mindset to another life. He couldn’t make him take it.
“Do something about it, then,” he said, and Draco did.
Parvati grinned. “I’m a menace to society. Budge up.”
“Right, but which?”
“Don’t know, why aren’t you speaking to Thomas?”
“Yes, thank you Padma – “
Draco rested his head on her shoulder. “It’s wonderful, being loved. Love to have that happen someday.”
“It’s six,” said Harry. “So, yes.”
“I really must go,” said Draco in a shrill, and dashed off to the other side of the room.
“Right,” said Harry through his teeth. “I’m possibly bi now, so apparently I need a whole basket of condoms. I’m probably shagging the whole town, right?”
Blaise waved a hand. “Oh, I’m pretty sure she put down the last wizard she was married to on the birth certificate. But she told me the truth, and even the most cursory glance over by the Ministry would have revealed it. My official father died ten months before I was born, and even if you wanted to argue I was overdue, he was one-hundred-and-fifty-three at the time. No, my father was an Irish muggle called Phil who was in a band, and who was apparently the great love of my mother’s life for about two months.”
Well, awkward to Harry and Draco. Nott was still burbling along under his breath.
for a hundred miles through the desert, repenting.
Nothing but bready crunching.
“Your fault, Potter,” he said through clenched teeth. “Usually I’m much more – more – more – “
“Parkinson’s an auror?”
“Exactly my feelings. Could you pass me the - “
“You were – “
Harry flipped him off. “We’ll leave that as plan B. Can you explain the rest of this shite to me? The utilitarianism bit was very useful, thanks.”
“She said she joined the aurors to channel her penchant for violence.”
“Nah. I guess I needed your commentary. Always spurred me on during matches.”
a twat, so they’d just have to deal with that.
“Of course, you went to Ilvermoney for eighth year, didn’t you. How was that?”
Hermione that week had been out for drinks with Parvati twice, rollerblading with Terry and two more protest with Anthony which had apparently included making out on the way back. “Yeah, you know her. Always in her books. Um, I was wondering… well, you see…”
“I saw your face, Dean. You looked like you wanted to cry. And maybe I’d like to know why – “
Blaise rubbed his forehead. “Darling, when you walked in here and saw me and Susan waltzing, did you not think that it was a moment better left uninterrupted?”
Wonderful. Now he had nobody as his date, and the newspapers would definitely print something about his crushing loneliness. Blaise and Susan would probably give them anonymous tips, the fuckers.
“Yes, but that was the terrifying loneliness, not anything to do with me. And tonight I’m all made-up and wearing some glorious dress from Padma that I’ve probably ruined. Of course someone might want me tonight. But she – she looks this good every day. Her hair is like actual silk. She doesn’t wear eyeliner, you know. Her eyes just look like that.”
“Sorry. Not at you.” He giggled again. “This sometimes happens after I’ve come really hard.”
“Hey,” said Harry. “Need a bit of help?”
little housewife.”
“She was bang out of order, Hermione. She had it coming.”
“Draco –“
“Thank you, that’s what I was saying – “
“Right,” said Blaise, grabbing Harry by the scruff of his neck. “We’re on pint three, Potter. You’re coming outside for a smoke with me.”
“He would have sent someone else if I’d said no. He supported your coming here.”
“—Those mean buggers from Grimmauld Place—” Ron started, mouth open, but she ignored him.
“You know how highly I think of you, Auror Potter. You’re an invaluable member of our team, incredibly perceptive, and relentless in finding the truth. But if all you have to give me to defend Auror Malfoy is documentation he provided you, I’m afraid I have to move forward with investigating these charges.”
"Not sure yet. But maybe I'll go. Just to edge you out as Molly’s favourite child."
“It’s okay being here when there’s a crowd of us, but honestly? I feel like I’m getting a bit old for this. Like—” He gave the bartender a bright smile until he wandered off, then he pressed back into Draco’s space. “—why am I paying so much for a drink I could make for a quarter of the price at home, where no one could see any of the embarrassing things it leads me to do?”
It had joined him at the Manor after the war. It was the sole presence beside him as he walked past portraits that no longer spoke, rooms where no one screamed or begged. The walls and floors and carpets swallowed any sounds that remained, dampened footsteps and breath. A pillowed coffin of his family’s making.
Harry kept the wince off his face. “Thanks. I’ll just check my desk and head over there. And there’s nothing interesting about my chocolate choices!” She’d already gone.
“Yes,” Malfoy said, letting the word drag out. The man took in Malfoy’s navy peacoat and faded maroon jumper peaking over the edges of the collar.
Hermione rolled her eyes at him, and when she punched his leg, he pushed her back. “Tosh. I’ve been sulking for days by myself, thank you very much. It’s refreshing to focus on someone else’s problems.”
Malfoy gave him a side eye, then piled the napkin bits together. A few more people were making their way into the bar.
“I was going for sophisticated,” Harry said, tracking Draco’s steps around the couch. Draco glanced at him, then the space on either side of the couch, before opting for the farthest corner. He could still be misunderstanding things. Assumptions should not be made, no matter how badly he wanted to make them.
The Harry they returned to lacked any trace of his prior bravado. As well as any bathing or sense of duty toward the pile of takeout on the living room table and kitchen island.
“Potter,” Flemings said, slapping Harry on the back. “You’re a bit of alright. We don’t care what any of the other Aurors say. We know at the end of the day you’re one of our own.” Harry schooled his face to keep back the twist of disgust his mouth longed to form.
Except that they wouldn’t. Because no one else was reading them.
“Liar.”
“Ha, bloody, ha. Just take it away. And distract me from this traumatising experience.”
Harry grinned. “If only we were wizards, Malfoy. I don’t love using stasis charms on food, but I’ll just eat them myself if they go bad that quickly.” Once they arrived at the unimpressive green-blue building, they sampled enough to feel sick. Harry came away with about five boxes full and pulled Malfoy into an alley so he could toss them in one of the bottomless bags Hermione had made him. From there, they wandered through the Mission District. Harry led most of the shopping, weaving them through different shops, but Malfoy spoke when it seemed important. Like convincing Harry not to buy a tweed hat that had caught his eye.
“To be fair to Harry, public charity events are on The List,” Ron said, his chin resting in his free hand. “And Harry’s not a lump on a log. He’s doing things. Godfathering Teddy. Landlord to us, letting us live here in sin. Being an alright Auror, supposedly, even if he spends more time solving other countries’ problems, but no one’s perfect.” Ron dodged the biscuit Harry threw his way with practiced ease. “You can’t be mad when it means he isn’t there to save the pixies—”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Well, of course I was grumpy
Malfoy wet his lips, then nodded. “Make it ten. You’ve been dominating the bathroom.”
Swallowing, Harry led them forward across the room. This close, the mint from Draco’s shampoo dominated the lavender in the air. Harry may have gone overboard in running the bath in advance. Some scents were battling, one breath bringing a smoky cedar, another a lilac grove. He should have just bought the mint, but it had seemed lazy at the time.
“The weather,” he would have told her. A reasonable response, given the icy sleet covering most of London’s pavement, but not his best lie.
“Will do, sir. Thank you for the additional time.”
"I’ll have the two of you,” Harry said as he licked some of the powdered sugar from his fingers. "Brunch at The Burrow. Teddy.” He wiped the rest off on his jeans. “And anyhow, that's what liquor is for."
The Incarcerous struck him from behind. His wheels spun out beneath him from the impact of the ropes, and he fell face first into the sand. It filled his nose and mouth, dry and too hot from the sun. Disgusting.
Draco stood a little taller, his fingers catching in the hem of Harry’s collar, and slowly opened his eyes. His pupils were large in the dark. Even this close, Harry could just make out the sliver of silver around the edges. Harry briefly kissed one side of his mouth. Then the other. His third met him fully, but he pulled back when Draco searched for him with his tongue.
He laughed, and she handed him the bottle as a reward. They sat in companionable silence for a while, swigging in turn.
“What?”
“Ooooooff,” said Harry. “Ron, mate, didn’t you try and tell them that – “
“Have I got something on my face?” said Ron.
Malfoy swallowed.
Harry looked down at the tabletop. “I guess it feels like it doesn’t matter as much anymore. I mean, I died. That’s a pretty good excuse for a fresh start.”
Harry made a face. “Ugh, really?”
“Yeah?”
“I do hope denial is one of them.”
“Would you please be quiet!”
“That wanker! I am going to kill him.”
“Why wouldn’t you? If I was in your position – “ He cut off, stricken.
“They’re your friends.”
Harry couldn’t stop looking at him.
The first domino fell as Harry was leaning against a wall, holding a carrot stick in one hand and a warm beer in the other and debating which one would be worse to put in his mouth.
He patted her hand. “Absolutely horrific.”
Seamus had given up on trying to stifle his giggles. “Harry, that was – “
It had seemed simple at the time – go to university, meet new people, befriend new people, possibly (definitely?) have sex with new people. In her zeal for understanding all that life had to offer, she’d forgotten one little problem – people, generally, didn’t seem to want to have sex with her.
Of course, as if summoned by Harry having a flashback to the war, Malfoy strolled in. Harry felt Hermione grab his hand.
“Don’t finish that sentence.”
“Hey, Hermione,” said Anthony Goldstein, grinning. He shifted the books he’d caught into the crock of his elbow and straightened up, grinning. “It’s been a while.”
“Oh no, please,” said Hermione. “Join us! It’s so nice to see you.”
“Huh,” said Harry, scribbling down a note. “Thanks. That makes sense.”
“I don’t think you should go back to halls for the last week of the holidays,” said Harry.
“I think you might have left one out,” said Draco sardonically. “I kid, of course. Though bravery isn’t necessarily a moral ideal either, you understand.”
“It’s going to be all right,” said Ron, when Harry was signing him in at the main office. “I’ll just have a nice talk with Hermione, easy like. Hermione, I’ll say, we’re still mates, and as mates I care about you. I just want to make sure that you make good choices – wait, no. That sounds like I’m telling her her choices aren’t good.  They are good at the moment. I don’t want bad future choices. Unless she’s already shacked up with Malfoy. She hasn’t, has she? Has she, Harry?”
“I don’t know about this,” said Michael. “I came to university to pursue pleasures of the mind. It feels like all everyone here wants to do is get wasted in increasingly inane ways. Don’t you think, Hermione?”
Draco looked outraged. “You can’t pick Pansy! She’s mine!”
And Draco did take his hand, and Harry utterly failed not to have feelings about it. From the look on his face, neither did Draco.
“I did know about lunch on Wednesday!” said Harry triumphantly.
“I’m sorry about the bathroom in sixth year,” he said. “I didn’t know what the spell would do, it’s true – but I knew it wouldn’t be very nice. I didn’t want you to die. I never did. I’m sorry I followed you in there in the first place. I just assumed you were up to something – I guess you were, overall. But not then. You were just trying to talk to someone, anyone, and I ruined that for you.”
“Right.”
“You want me to stop?”
“All right, but they’re not – they’re not necessarily bad things. Virtue ethics, remember? There’s no right way to be a person. You can pick your own thing to be.”
“Are you two going to be like this all night?” said Dean, desperately.
Seamus scoffed and hummed a few bars of
“Scared of Ron?”
“Harry. Harry Potter. I don’t know if you’ve noticed this, but your dear friend Granger is quite popular these days.”
“Hi,” said Draco, who was standing next to Pansy.
” according to Hermione.
“Don’t ask me complicated questions when I’m drunk.” He groaned and moved closer. “Why are we drinking together again?”
“That I’m dumb,” said Harry. “I’m so dumb. I am just drop-dead stupid.”
and it gives me the tiniest sliver of hope that I can actually change. So you can’t push me on this, please. My dignity is currently held together with threads, and if you ask me - if you – You don’t have a clue about what I’m on about, do you?”
“Have you seen Draco?”
“He’s a good – “
“Not like that,” she said. “Do you really think that
“Boys! Muggles!”
And then Draco pushed him away with a gasp, wiping his mouth.
to understand why she tried to give me up. I really would. Because it would be better than knowing that sometimes people are just cold, selfish
“I take back everything bad I ever said about Pansy,” said Blaise, rubbing his temples.
The thought was like poison, curling round his heart. Why did he care? Nice and friendly, just like Hermione had said. That’s what they’d been. That’s what Draco had been trying to tell him, when he called him
The recommended reading list for Magical Law was only ten books long, and Hermione had already finished them by the time she’d received her acceptance letter. Luckily, two out of the ten professors she’d be taught by had the right kind of enthusiasm for a dedicated student, and they had agreed to send her an even more extended reading list. Just the site of the Royal College of Magic’s library – the shining wood shelves, the painted ceiling in the Italian style showing Prometheus stealing fire and giving it to man, the busts of great wizards on the shelves – had filled Hermione with a fire for learning.
“I’m good!” He raised the shot to his lips, but made the mistake of inhaling before he drank. Nope. Not happening. He slammed it undrunk back onto the table, taking deep breaths.
“Hey,” there was Seamus, balancing three coffees. “Blaise had to run back to halls, apparently something bad has happened to Susan. Harry, Hermione’s involved too.”
“Yeah,” said Padma. “That was me. I’m a bitch, sorry. Evil twin, you know the drill. Parvati’s pathetically in love with you.”
Michael tried to push himself up to his knees, but Blaise’s foot only pressed down. “You won’t get away with this.”
“I’m not acting like a lunatic,” said Draco. “I’m repressing my feelings, like a good Slytherin. I’ll figure a way out of this, somehow.”
Draco was standing there in the doorway, his hair ruffled, in a clean white shirt. He looked washed out and strange under the sodium glare. He looked like he hadn’t slept in a week, and then cried heavily about it. He looked absolutely beautiful.
“What, not even in dorm parties?”
“It’s Malfoy, isn’t it?” said Dean, looking at Hermione as if he were prophesising the end of the world. Hermione gave a small nod, and looked at Harry to check if he was ok. Which he was very much
“Oh,” said Susan.
“Do you want to?”
“Hello, Sea,” he said, wrapping a hand around his waist to keep Sea upright. He’d left Harry and Malfoy to the tender mercies of Pansy Parkinson, hoping to get a breath of fresh air. There was too much sexual tension there that he really didn’t want to probe.
“Good man!” Blaise thumped him on the back, all trace of whatever-that-had-been gone. Harry felt uncannily like he’d been conned.
“Something in common?”
“Avoiding me,” said Blaise, his jaw tense. “I bought her horrible flowers and she’s avoiding me, the harridan.”
“I find it very amusing that you’re shagging a bloke but still can’t talk about it,” said Theo, completely unamused.
“I mean – new era, and all that. It probably won’t kill you.”
“What about Slytherin values?”
told me that I’d got it right the first time. So I want to know. Why did you lie, when I asked you last night?”
“All right, no houses are intrinsically good or evil or better. I get your point.”
“Merlin, Granger, yes. You’re pretty, you’re intelligent, and you’ve got good sense to boot.”
“You know I’m not actually sleeping with Thomas, right?”
“Sorry, Hermione,” he said, checking his watch-less left wrist. “I really must dash.”
“Well, you should still apologise. Go hang around one of those Ravenclaw boys. Go hang around Thomas to make him stop looking like a wet blanket. Or, you know, hang around with me. Your oldest friend, guy who actually wanted to have fun with you this evening?”
“Yes, Michael Corner. He’s told me he wants to ask you out, and I know that sometimes there’s a patriarchal assumption that girls are territorial over men they’ve previously dated, and I just wanted you to know that I wouldn’t be like that.”
Draco raised his arms in the air. “I am the champion! Pansy, mark this day – October the eighth – “
Draco blushed. That colour contrast – Harry could write poems about the pink and white of Draco’s face. So he did what seemed perfectly natural. He leant forward and kissed him.
“We have to – “
“Morag Macdougal,” said Dean, shuddering. “She’s terrifying. I duelled her once in the DA. Almost lost my eyebrows.”
“Great. I just need to go talk to Charlie about moving to Romania,” said Ron, and ran out of the pub.
Write to me soon, my love,
Refresh my memory, you taught a class yourself in fifth year, didn't you? In Defense? Quite frankly it sounds — Bloody perfect.
“That’s, ah, my second one. I swallowed the first one… accidentally.”
Harry woke to an unfamiliar owl tapping at his window. He scanned the letter for charms and hexes and, finding none, untied the letter and allowed the owl to rest. The post mark indicated the letter was from France… but this was not Draco’s handwriting.
Narcissa laughed quietly. “I know. Hard to think of her as a young girl?”
Yours sincerely,
“A… Abraxas?” Draco stared at him, and… Now that he was looking, he could see a few of the Malfoy features. “He’s my grandfather. We lost him to-”
“Well, apparently you’re going to be my mother-in-law… so I’m going to try my best. I don’t really have any… any frame of reference so…”
“I do,” he told her gently.
“You have plenty of other talents, Harry, don’t worry.”
Draco made a face at the display and heard laughter- "Not much of a family man, I take it?"
you?" He leaned over, planting a big smooch on her cheek.
“Miranda, just give the boy the bottle, I say! There’s plenty of other wines to try tonight.”
do I miss you.
Harry sighed, turning the burner off. Gods, if only Draco could see him now. He’d give him some shit about how he was a baby, crying over breakfast,
"I'll put it in a box for you, in the vault."
“Um, thank you-?”
“The Crowlins? Yes, they’re considered adequate enough, in a pinch. And yes, one or two of them were on his side in the war. They’re trying to start something up, then?” Looking over the file, he watched Draco frown. “They want us to do it tonight? That’s no amount of time to prepare.”
Draco woke up on Sunday morning, acutely aware of both the moon and the fact that he would be meeting quite a number of new people that evening. His first shift would be that Wednesday, which made him anxious. He already had his Wolfsbane ready, so now it was just nerves about the transformation.
a production!" She grinned and pulled him close, giving him four kisses, two on each cheek. "Oh I am so glad you are here, Draco."
The moon went better than it has before. Most likely because I know I’ll be back home soon. My time away has been nice, and Paris has been a breath of fresh air, but I feel as though I’ve got a clean head, and I’m ready to come back.
Charms
“He did, yes. When do you think he found out about His plans to become a Dark Lord? He got information from the Hogwarts library and was recruiting while he was still in school.”
“Come on! Put it on! I can’t believe you’re actually not so uptight.” Draco just grumbled to himself as he unbuttoned the Hawaiian print shirt. He wasn’t uptight, why did everyone think that he was? He pulled the shirt on over his head and sighed at the feel of the soft material against his skin. Just in time for Bas to come back with the softer pants. He put those on as well, looking in the… mirror…
alive, Draco.
With the moon waning, I’m feeling more and more like myself. Those days of and around the full moon — it felt like someone else was trying to take control. Or maybe some small forgotten part of me that had been shoved away. I didn’t recognize it, if that’s so.
Draco smiled at her. “I realized it when we were both still in school together.” She reached over and gently held his hand in hers, giving it a comforting squeeze.
“Dragonpox, when both my children were very young. 1984, I believe?”
The diadem was gone. As was the cup, Ron and Hermione had destroyed it with a basilisk fang in the Chamber of Secrets. The wards had fallen. Death Eaters were everywhere.
Draco stared at her before finally raising his brows back at her. “I’m sorry, I don’t think I appreciate what you’re implying.” In love with Potter? In
porcelain clawfoot bathtub easily large enough to hold two people.
"Ah, Draco!" October called, waving to him. "Good to see you again!" A glass of fruity, citrusy white wine floated over to him. "Give this a try, would you? Tell me what you think." He carefully took the glass and, glancing at those watching him, he took a sip. At first, his lips puckered, but at the underlying sweetness, he was forced to take another sip to try to chase that taste.
Draco
Harry just shook his head fondly and took his seat, taking out his own late lunch. It was important to have the energy to go into a raid-- exhaustion and low blood sugar have landed Harry in the first aid office before. (The Ministry healers knew him by name, from all the small injuries that didn't warrant a trip to St. Mungo's.) Across from him, Draco huffed and shifted in his chair before raising an eyebrow. “Any information from our ‘Deputy Auror’ about the mission?”
“You’ve hardly even touched your plate, stay, eat. Today is a day to celebrate.” He didn't feel much like celebrating, now that both his abysmal love life and his new scars had been brought up. And he'd never much enjoyed dinner parties, though this one was very different from all the others he'd been to. “New family is always a reason to celebrate.”
"The meeting with Ron ran a bit longer than I thought, he was busy with another team when I got there. Perks of being Deputy Head, I suppose." He set Draco's wrap and drink on his desk, away from any files. "And Christine sends her regards. That's a strawberry black tea she thought you'd enjoy, by the way."
Draco reflects on his afterlife
That was completely and utterly unfair. Though you could of course look into a few charms, something similar to a Howler or a Ministry letter? Though I’d prefer not a Howler, as I don’t think the rest of Paris would appreciate anything you’d put in that letter.
“Ridiculous- I will not let my grand-nephew spend his first change in some second-rate hotel room. I won’t allow it. You will stay with me, for the rest of your time in Paris, beginning with tonight.” She took a breath and softened. “Draco, not everyone lives with me now. Only my grand-daughter Valerie and her son. I have plenty of room, and you need to be looked after. Let me do this for you.” He took as best a breath he could, trying to ignore the hiccuping tremor to it as he nodded, his own hands now grasping hers.
It seemed that everyone and their auntie had a different theory on where Draco Malfoy went. The most popular theory was, in fact, that he had been pulled from Hogwarts and shipped off to Silovikizba, though the reasoning was still murky. (The whole Durmstrang theory was debunked rather quickly after a few owls were sent to a Romanian cousin that confirmed Draco was not there.)
He dashed off a quick letter to the Ministry, confirming that he would consult with them, before picking up the file again to read it through in more detail this time.
It wasn't supposed to happen, so don't you dare feel like you somehow deserve this. You aren't a monster, either.
Unable to stop himself from grinning at Charlie’s sense of humour, so similar to the twins, Harry sat at the chair beside the bed. He’d brought the letter to reference back to, which now seemed like it had been a brilliant idea. “That dragon that attacked you was here in Britain. I got a letter from the Ministry. They want it identified and taken care of so that it doesn’t end up attacking again.”
Just – Let’s just talk in the courtyard, Ron,” said Hermione’s voice, and then Ron was loudly complaining about the rain as he came down the passageway. Harry and Draco exchanged identical panicked looks, and then by mutual agreement rushed into the secret cupboard, closing the door just in time.
“Because you hated me, Harry.” Draco’s voice was soft, his smile uneven. “Well done. You have finally destroyed me.”
“Course. Though, just as an addendum, you don’t have to come out to your parents. I more meant, you know – “
She shook him off. “So if you came to give a big speech, don’t worry about it, because apparently I’m too pathetic to deserve one.”
bonding,” said Nott, disgusted.
“Yeah.”
“Bloody hell,” said Harry. He was wearing his best shirt and his only blazer, and had until now felt quite grownup. “You’re going to give Skeeter a heart-attack.”
Harry, because who else would it be? There was probably a limit on the number of horrifically awkward conversations on your doorstep you had to endure per day, right?
“Fuck off forever, Potter. Look, I know you can be a bit slow on the uptake, so try this – the closest you’re going to get to not having me here? It’s by
“Harry fucking Potter,” snarled Susan, grabbing his other arm. “You and me are going to have a little chat about Michael Corner.”
“But unfortunately, she refuses to see my ardent expressions of desire as anything other than an irritant, so I remain in miserable chastity.”
“He scares me.”
“Seamus.” Dean grabbed his shoulders. “I do. Because he’s my friend. That’s all. But stay here, ok? Please, don’t go anywhere. Please.”
“Of course I care. I’m happy. I just wonder if you know why
She grinned at him with no mercy. “I know.”
Hermione exhaled. “I didn’t run away because I saw Ron with Pansy. I ran away because Ron saw me with Parvati.”
“Ron’s my second. Get your own. Oh, wait.”
he was tempted to say. “What do you mean, weird? I hate him! That’s not weird. He’s hateable! How is he even at uni? He didn’t return for eighth year.”
“I have never frolicked in my life.”
“Yes. Shockingly, I do know a little about bigotry. You unlearn this stuff. It takes time, but you get there eventually. Your friends know you’re working on it.”
“Sorry, Harry,” said Hermione when he looked at her beseechingly. “But I’m with Parvati tonight.” She shot a blinding grin back at the Ravenclaw boys – Anthony winking, Terry bowing, Michael fuming – and swept on without him.
“Sure,” said Harry. “Blame Seamus. It’s not like he’s just following through on what his parents taught him or anything.” He didn’t know why he was defending Seamus – he was certainly acting like a tosser. It just felt wrong, somehow, to sit here and bitch about him with Malfoy.
“Please don’t? Don’t what? Just because you’re allergic to your emotions and can’t consider the possibility that having an open, honest conversation is the best way – “
“Like what?”
“Well, jeez,” she said icily. “Thanks for clearing that up.”
Ron scrubbed the back of his neck. “I was going to say tact but… all that bollocks, basically.”
“Yes,” said Theo.
“I can’t believe you two saved the world,” said Dean. “I mean, bloody well done and all that, but, you know, wow.”
Harry took his arm. “We can go home via a pub. Or an offy.”
“Yes. Don’t worry. I know it’s ugly.” He was tracing the lines of it with his fingertips. “Ugly mind, ugly body as my mother always used to say.”
He stomped off in the direction of the kitchen, hoping to find Draco, when he heard raised voices coming from down the corridor.
“I thought you wanted your apology. Pick one.”
“Dunno,” said Finnegan. “Can’t imagine you ever having much of a social life, with your sparkling personality. What are you mad at Harry for again?”
“No!” Hermione actually stamped her foot, something Harry had assumed people only did in films. “I need to say some things first, and you’re not going to like them, but now I want to say another bunch of things that you also won’t like – oh for god’s sake, I’ll just number them. Number one, I do not appreciate the sentiment that you know what I’m about to say, ok?”
Anyway, this chapter requires a trigger warning for sexual assault. I have not tagged this fic rape/non-con because the actual act doesn't occur, and nothing happens 'on screen.' But this chapter does contain a description of someone using manipulation and emotional coercion to force someone into sex. As you've probably gathered if you're still reading this story, it's based heavily on my own uni years, and this issue was so prevalent and common that it just wove itself into the story.
But it was never enough. A lot of it was
“What if they never make it?”
Weeks later, when asked about Blaise’s “Balls-Out End of Term Extravaganza,” Hermione would compare it to a Rube Goldberg machine. She would then flip a middle finger up at Blaise as he told her not to compare his ‘devastating night of romance to any
The party was beautiful. Blaise had really outdone himself. There were twinkling candles floating above the guests, wrapped in ribbons and holly and the occasional sprig of mistletoe. The shitty walls were hidden behind carefully placed baby firs, or magically charmed fires with chestnuts levitating above them at the perfect state of toastedness. Fairy lights transfigured into the shape of actual fairies decked the ceiling in shimmering strings of loveliness. There was, thank god, no band.
of us could be stupid enough to start shagging Gryffindors?” But her face was too blank, and her hands were shaking as she lifted her cup of tea.
“Because you were giving him heart palpitations every time you looked at him! Teenage boys are idiots.” Parvati was laughing. “Honest, Hermione, we were laughing at the boys, not you.”
Harry shifted uncomfortably on the hard kitchen chairs. “I mean, you’re inviting everyone from both flats. It’s a bit rude to leave him out.”
“That’s brilliant!” said Harry. He grabbed some snow, held it to his lips. “It’s real! Draco, this is – “
Harry decided to leave
The sound echoed round the courtyard, freezing everyone in place. Theo stormed open to the cupboard door and wrenched it open.
“Stop,” said Hannah. “Just stop, ok? We get it, you saved the world. Jesus.”
Except for Seamus, who pushed his chair back with a deafening screech.
“You’re not trying to get in her pants too, are you?”
“You know, I really think you’re underselling our future kids, Pans. As long as they avoid anything from the top half of my face and anything from the bottom half of yours, we’re probably all right.”
Seamus scoffed. “Yeah, but that would upset Dean.” His face changed from scowling to sad. “I don’t want to upset Dean. I just keep doing it. I’m poison, ‘Mione. I fuck up everything I touch.”
He shifted and pulled her towards his chest. “Because you are – I don’t even know how to phrase it, Pansy. I mean, all the ways I know to phrase it aren’t for people like you and the way I feel. The best thing I can say is that it’s – recognition. I look at you and I see something I don’t see anywhere else, and it’s something that you don’t let a lot of people see but I get to. And you look at me and see me. Was that ok?”
And of all the things to do, Potter laughed. “Who knows?”
“That’s nonsense, you’ve just got to stay aware of it. Monitor yourself.”
Malfoy—Draco—returned the smile. Then it dropped into something warm, if a little serious. “Now get to work.”
“What? But you were so surprised.”
Malfoy kept with him as Harry navigated the crowds, and he stopped when Harry did to pull out a local map. Too many Muggles for a Point Me spell, he figured. The man didn’t say anything until they stepped through the large glass doors that led out of the building. It emptied them onto a cement pavement near the water. A large bridge passed overhead, and the air felt frigid, briney, under an overcast sky. Harry could feel Malfoy staring at him.
The sounds of Malfoy’s shuffling halted for a moment or two, then resumed again. “Yes, is the light working now? I put a call in to the front desk before I left to set up a service order.” Malfoy stepped into the hallway and reached past Harry for the door. “They must have taken care of it while we were at the conference. Ready to go?”
“They never change, do they,” Hermione said as she slid in beside Harry, her expression dark. She ripped open her carton of yoghurt with more force than necessary and apologised when some of it splattered on Harry’s tray. “He’s been here for years. Follows the rules, doesn’t cause any trouble. And hasn’t he helped solve at least a dozen of those cases they bring you back for?”
“That’s Baker Beach,” the guide said, stepping beside Harry and the others that had remained in place. “And those are No-Majs, mostly. It’s a very liberated area, San Francisco, even the non-magical parts. Just the other day I was wandering to one of my favourite markets and stumbled on this whole carnival full of people in leather, if they were wearing much at all. Devices I haven’t seen since I studied Medieval History right there out on Folsom Street. These are incredible times, the new millennium.”
Relief hit him as he watched Malfoy go. In the primary conference room, Harry found his spot from the day before. A few people waved hello, and a group joined him this time. Malfoy, too, was surrounded, even at the very front of the room again.
But some revision wouldn’t hurt.
Malfoy gave a barely audible “Mm” in acknowledgment. The doors dinged, announcing The View Lounge before opening. Malfoy waited, so Harry stepped out first. Catching his reflection in a nearby mirror, Harry reached up to adjust a curl, then headed through the short hall to the larger bar area. It had only a few patrons so far, but all of them were dressed in a combination of dark, fitted jeans and sleek clothes. He gave his hair a strong rub to scatter the waves further.
“Well, probably an adult leaf.” Neville led him towards a few pots at the back. “Hey there. How we doing today?”
And it… It was perfect for Draco. There was a four-poster bed with curtains he could draw, a nice plush looking chair next to a dark chestnut desk, a few shelves just waiting to be filled with books, and a wardrobe that Harry was
And feeling the leaf slip down his throat. "Uh… Prof- Headmistress… Would using a sticking charm work?" She looked at him for what seemed like a long time. She began to massage her temple and sighed.
Oatmeal. Greyish beige lumps of overcooked mashed oats. The St. Mungo's oatmeal might as well have been glue from Flourish & Blotts, as far as Draco was concerned. Draco didn't even like to look at the stuff, let alone put it anywhere near his mouth.
In its place was a man.
“I assume she will be as beautiful, wealthy, and tragic as your friend’s lovely mother in a few years, then, non?”
“No, no, Harry, it’s fine, I’m just with a friend,” she called back, pausing in her tapping the magicked ink into Draco’s skin. “Do you mind if he keeps us company? Might be a good distraction for when I work closer to your spine…” She lowered her voice, so Harry couldn’t hear.
“I see. Well, all I can say is that you need to treat him gently, right now. He is going through quite a bit,” she said, patting Harry’s hand.
“Valerie,” Gwen chided softly. “Draco is taking his time with his courtship, that’s nothing to look down upon-”
Also… this was dinner with his work partner/friend's mum… he wasn't going on a date. That shocked a bit of a laugh out of him as he changed into a dark blue collared shirt. The girl at the shop said it would bring out his eyes, make his skin glow. (He didn't know about that, but what did he know?) Looking in the mirror, he nodded. This was probably as good as it was going to get. He didn’t want to be late, at least. Narcissa seemed to like him, he didn’t want to give her reason not to.
“That doesn’t change the fact he’s a brat,” Ron pointed out. He was such a stubborn-
The last thing he had packed was a Ministry-issued automatic resizing collar, so any beast could be safely tagged and identified, large or small. Cloak and glasses secure, he mounted his Firebolt up on the roof and kicked off, heading in the general direction of Salisbury, hoping he'd find the dragon before the dragon found him.
“My… magical core?” Alright, Harry would be the first to admit he hardly knew what that was. He might have remembered it being mentioned at Hogwarts once or twice.
had an enlargement charm on the inside. Harry could easily imagine Draco reading in that chair, or answering letters at his desk. He could imagine gently waking him up from that bed. “You… said something about an ensuite?” Grin still fixed on her face, she led him to the other door, which apparently led to their connected bathroom.
She nodded along. “You think you’ll be able to do it?” Harry nodded, cradling his teacup in both hands.
He’d come into the purple and gold shop shy as anything, nervous about the process like most people are with tattoos. She’d just smiled and sat him down, asking if he had any ink ideas. He’d produced two letters— nearly 18 years old, and both to a one Padfoot, upon which Euthymia hadn’t commented. He’d shifted in his seat and pointed to where his parents had signed their names…
-Antoni getting on really well with Molly? "Why are you so skinny holy sh*t?" Bobby looking at Grimmauld Place like omg the House elf heads?? are not decor??
“...I wouldn't mind that…”
Mr. Potter,
"It's not the spells I'm having trouble with. I'm an old woman, Harry, I haven't the youthful energy to be wandering around gathering pixies."
“...it was his first full moon last night.”
“Mm, yes she reached out to me a few years ago, I forget why or even how she found me. She mentioned that her sister, your mother, had married my nephew, and I replied that I knew. I consider her a friend, though we’ve never met in person. Nearly, oh… must be almost a decade now. Long before her daughter got married and had little Teddy.”
What was- Oh. Oh, that was… That was nice. She was combing his hair back for him. Maybe Harry might have understood a little bit why Draco always ran to his mum whenever anything was wrong- Okay, no. He needed to
(P.S. I know France probably has excellent chocolate, but this was Remus’ favorite kind… maybe you'll like it too?)
"What made you realize, darling?"
party be?" He winked at her. "A week-long ball? Fireworks and masquerades? Something to envy the French royalty?"
"Fuck-- I'm sorry, I knew that, I just… I'm sorry, Nev."
Draco frowned, looking him over. “Can I help you?”
The spells holding Harry had begun to lose strength, but none of the Death Eaters noticed him as they walked back down the stairs. Harry was still frozen and silent for a good few minutes before the magic broke. He practically saw red as he fled the scene, running after Snape and his gang of murderers.
this family? It was very overwhelming— six adults talking to him at once, and two of them holding a child.
Harry nodded and rolled his shoulders a bit. They'd taken on ten, once, just the pair of them, and it had landed harry in St. Mungo's for a bit. Five between the two of them would be a piece of cake. "You're right about that."
"Hang on, snot, just another minute." She stuck her tongue out at him and grinned, crossing her arms over her chest. Finally, he set down the instrument and Draco realized it had been a needle. "Alright, lemme clean up and we'll get going.” Draco watched as Sebastien quickly cleaned up his station and gently cleaned the large man’s new tattoo with a foaming wash, before wrapping it in clear plastic wrap. He finally turned to them with a grin. "So? Let's go shopping."
“Me?” Harry’s eyes widened as he took a moment to process what she was saying. “But… Why me? How?” He knew that he didn’t have the best childhood, but he didn’t think that he’d ever have been an
Draco hid behind a fallen statue in the Great Hall, feeling every inch the ghost he was as Voldemort's voice rang through the grounds.
"Indeed, Potter. The center and source of all the magic you can call upon…" She paused, pinning him with a calculating gaze. "Despite the chaos of your time at this school, surely you learned about magical cores."
“I’m a 43.” Bas snapped his fingers and grinned at him.
"Oh- No, no, that's not mine- I'd prefer you not wash it, it's very delicate," he blurted out. If she washed it, it would lose the scent.
Harry awoke some hours later, feeling warm and rested,and still very much on a dragon, which was also blinking awake—looks like he'd had a nap, too.
Harry Potter. And you deserve
“Certainly not. We were actually arranged, when we were very young, but… My interests don’t lie in that direction.” Neither of them seemed surprised, but then again, their own son had married a man.
"I'm sure Uncle October and Aunt Miranda will jump at the chance to show you around. You should come with us in August, though. You can stomp grapes with everyone." Valerie carefully peeled her orange in one long spiral with a short, sharp knife.
This wasn’t normal behavior. It looked like it was on the edge of adolescence, just entering adulthood.
“I- I’m sorry?” What exactly was one meant to say to realizing they had an entire branch of family they never once knew of? Especially when he’d only come to the cafe expecting a meal. This was insane!
I miss you. I’ve been considering coming home, soon.
"A bit odd, but not overly so. Crowlins. They're not particularly well liked among purebloods as is, most likely they couldn't secure a marriage for their heir."
“Draco, I’ve come to rescue you,” she whispered, giving his shoulder a little squeeze. “Boys, I’m afraid our Draco has a lot more people to meet, so if you’ll excuse me.” And she was leading him away… away from most all the other people, into another room.
And as much as Hermione hated to agree… she didn't know if Harry would accept the help unless it was forced on him.
“France, then?”
” Harry closed his eyes and shook his head.
“Enough of that, you stubborn boy. Gwendolyn or Gwen is just fine, if you don’t feel like calling me ‘Aunt’.” She gave his shoulder another squeeze. “Come sit up by me and Derrick, hm? Some nice friendly faces for company.” And she breezed out to the kitchen, like Draco hadn’t just told her his biggest, most dangerous secret.
“I won’t, I promise. The, ah, the Muggles have a saying. ‘If you love something, set it free. If it comes back, it’s yours forever.’ I’m not… I’m not saying I necessarily
“He was incredibly fussy. And oh, if you think he’s terrible now, if I ever set him down for more than a moment, he would wail and cry until I picked him up again. He couldn’t stand to be away from me for more than a few seconds.” Harry laughed at that, he could so easily imagine it. Tiny baby Draco throwing a little fit when his mummy didn’t have him close. He just wanted to be loved and cared for, really. She flipped the page and it looked like Draco was just a little older in the picture, Narcissa holding him again. The picture-Draco looked at the camera for a brief moment and gave a smile, open-mouthed and gummy that made his eyes sparkle…
“You don’t have to trouble yourself, Harry, you know Mimsy would be happy to do it for you. But… if you’re going to be stubborn like you always are, pancakes would be lovely.” She needed to write to this woman, the sooner the better. Malfoys didn’t just go missing, not on her watch anyway.
[[Two bars of Honeydukes Reserve 90% Dark Chocolate are included with the letter.]]
“Yes, I’m well,” he said with a nod. “I… suppose I’ll just have to acclimate.”
He quirked a brow at her. “That’s a… very bright color. I didn’t think you owned makeup.”
“Good. Then what are you going to do about it?”
Draco spoke before he could think, “Has anyone ever mentioned to you that you look incredibly similar to Harry Potter?”
Also, if I might suggest? Zacharias Smith apparently works for the Prophet now… I wonder if paparazzi make enough money to support their tragically young and beautiful Slytherin widows…
could tell that much for themselves. Blaise was probably just frightened by the thought of ‘being chained down’ and not having the option to fuck off wherever and with whoever he wanted. Draco just hoped those two Gryffindors wouldn't give up and stop waiting for him. They all deserved to be happy, and to be happy together. Even if they were incredibly annoying.
“I do, thank you, dear. Mimsy, get my things.” The elf from their dinner at the Manor appeared with Narcissa's luggage.
"Probably because of the Boy Who Lived Twice reputation, ta very much. Sometimes, catching normal criminals is nice, too. Keeps things interesting," he said, looking over the file a bit closer. "Have you ever heard of the Crowlins? They aren't a Sacred 28 family, but are they old money?"
“Luna, how could you
“...You think I should go after him, though?”
“Oh… Well- Well, it’s really nothing all that exciting. If you’ve heard one Auror case, you’ve heard them all, really-” He didn’t want to talk about his cases… the last one had gone so terribly and it was too fresh in his mind. “So much of it is paperwork—”
“Are you ill? Did you catch something-?”
-Tan taking him shopping and getting him into something Draco might like and he and Harry have this moment of "o shit do you want to impress someone SPECIFIC" at this reunion?? let's get you a fitted suit??"
imagine our first Christmas together. It makes my heart hurt. I absolutely want that, Harry love. I want that more than anything. And I want that with you.
Leesy did not like this one bit. Malevolent magic seemed to seep from the walls and foundation and all manner of undesirable characters roamed its halls. It was despicable what these evil people had done to her Master and Mistress’ home! These evil people probably killed young master Draco… The elf worked quickly to shrink and pack all the valuables and clothes her Mistress had asked. Young master Draco's was the easiest-- Leesy cleared the entire room. Satisfied, the elf Disapperated from the cursed manor with a crack.
He started wiping away the dust from the bookshelves, something that had never caught his attention during the war. Most of them were Hogwarts textbooks, some of them nearly 30 years old.
Euthymia feigned innocence as Draco entered the shop alone later that week. She began work on his nape, humming to herself.
“I see,” he said softly. “You… don’t have magic?”
“Ask away.”
Draco looked down at himself again. “These pants are… incredibly textured.”
“How do you
“You mean like an Animagus?”
That had been Euthymia’s first thought when Draco Malfoy entered her shop in mid-August of that same year, requesting simple black-and-white narcissus flowers over the pink scar that had once been the Mark.
“That doesn’t mean, of course, not to write a return letter, however.”
“No, I don’t- And I can’t possibly take this!”
Draco Malfoy-Potter
“...Not even once?” When Hermione hit Ron, he whined this time. “But I don’t like him!”
He turned his great body to face Harry, and the man was shocked. The emotions on the dragon’s scaly face and in his mercurial eyes was unmistakable. He was hurt and he was betrayed. It was obvious (no matter how crazy and far fetched the idea was) that the dragon believed Harry had only healed his wing and gained his trust to cause him harm, perhaps take him away to a reservation or ranch— or even perhaps turn him into expensive pearly dragonhide boots and gloves. He raised a huge sharp claw and began to scratch and pull at the collar.
“Drago!”
“I might as well, that tart looks delicious and—” Wait a damn minute. “You know what happened?”
“Why would he come to Grimmauld before going back to his own home, when he comes back?” Harry felt himself flush and squirmed in his seat just a bit.
“Well, yes it is. Do you not talk much with muggles, Draco?” She sounded curious, not like she was condemning him or judging him.
"We-- Draco and I haven't talked about anything like this… I haven't asked him, or said anything… I was afraid it might scare him off, and I'd get a letter saying that he's left France and will never come home again."
It looked like the average 'raising an evil cult leader' type of place, a field or two to one side and a forest to the other. (Harry was briefly reminded of a few Muggle horror films.) He popped back next to Draco, who didn't even flinch at his stubborn appearance.
The dragon, once so calm and trusting of Harry, was working itself up into a state of extreme agitation. He began to stomp around the clearing, head swinging dramatically from side to side as he tried to rid himself of the collar. Harry quickly darted to the treeline, not wanting to be in the path of those giant feet, really quite worried now that the dragon might hurt him in retaliation for the collar. He could see now how the dragon had managed to injure Charlie so badly - it was big, and powerful, and clearly had a temper.
I've never gotten a stiffy faster in my life. A deeply satisfying wank session followed me receiving your letter. (Though I think you had a much better time creating those photos, didn't you darling?) I've never wanted to eat your gorgeous arse as much as I have since your last letter came. Practically drooling like a dog over it.
“What- What on
The Dark Lord had seized control of the Manor over the past summer, nearly a year under his control now. Lucius was forced to play host to at least a dozen of Voldemort's elite and most trusted followers, feeding them, housing them, all while under constant ridicule and surveillance of the evil madman.
Draco,
Ah, about the childhood… not good. Erm, in fact I saw a Muggle therapist about it weekly for two years. They helped a lot more than the Mind Healer did, at least with all the pre-war trauma. I still go by every once and awhile, actually. I promise I’ll tell you more when you come home.
What would you tell me to do, if I were there with you? I’d love to hear every detail of exactly what you’d have me do, and what you’d do to me. It’s only fair, after all.
Luna’s eyes widened, and for once, she seemed surprised. “Oh. I assume that didn’t go well for him.” He handed over the letter, and let her read. He watched her face, watched her eyes flit as they scanned the parchment. “Oh, poor Draco… It sounds like his wolf misses its mate.”
“I try to regret as few things in my life as possible, Potter, but leaving you in that house with those people is one of my biggest regrets. The other is that I allowed Sirius Black to be put in Azkaban and did not look for the truth.” She replaced her spectacles and looked at him. “You are probably very tired of apologies by now, but humor me with this last one. I know Albus’ ultimate goal was to win the war… but I apologize for not trying harder to make sure you and your loved ones were protected.”
"Thanks, Nev. I'll come round and see you again soon, alright? And, er, Georgina? Thank you for this, it means a lot."
“He was my Auror partner. My leaving was… fairly sudden, for him,” he told them, unable to keep his fingers from drifting to his neck. Valerie caught the movement and bit her lip.
After nearly 45 minutes of chatting, the dragon had calmed down significantly. He was still clearly wary of Harry, and stayed at the opposite side of the clearing, but he was no longer holding himself ready to pounce at any minute, a sure sign that he was beginning to trust Harry.
Leaning against the counter, he finally turned around and got back to it. “Dumbledore didn’t care about the individual people. He cared about winning a war.”
I miss you, too.
He picked up a twig and used his hands to break it in half so as to not sneak up on the dragon, watching it pause and twist its head towards him. Harry held his hands out for it to see that he was unarmed. “Hey,” he said quietly, leaning down to kneel on one knee. “Hey there. Hey. You’re okay.” The dragon seemed to snarl at him, and shit...it was probably gonna come for him next. He might have enough time to take out his wand and cast a shield charm… It was walking away from him. What was this dragon
"Any other time, I'm certain he'd be no less than thrilled," she told him seriously as she picked up her own cup. Harry tapped his fingertips against the fine china teacup and paused, thinking.
Thank you for writing me. I hope this clears a few things up.
Third year.
of those robes. “And… what about bonding jewelry? What did Arthur choose for you?”
He sighed. “Oh… Alright, just one.” She hummed and tapped her cheek a few times.
room? He groaned and put his face in his hands for a moment.
"Life is never boring with a Potter around," Harry said, all cheek. He cast a quick cooling charm on himself and conjuried an elastic to keep his hair out of his face.
I think I would like to keep it quiet. Just for a little bit? Just for us to get used to it. I do like the idea, though, of going to — say — Diagon Alley on your arm. For multiple reasons. Partially to show you off and silently brag that you’re on my arm, and not theirs.
“Are you sure?” When there was no reply from Draco, Harry pressed further, unable to restrain his curiosity. “Why were you a dragon? How long have you been able to transform?”
Harry nodded and read through the letter again.
Merlin
"Huh-ho, damn, jump back, kitty's got claws," she joked, curling her fingers to make a little claw in his direction.
And it does heal my heart, a fair amount knowing that you were shifted as well. I can’t quite explain it, at least… Not in words, it… It’s quite like the smells, isn’t it? Something we
Doing as asked, Harry stared at him as Draco did turn now, throwing him a look over his shoulder. “Don’t come after me again.” With that said, he shimmered before the large dragon form was back, and he was taking off, up into the sky fairly clumsily before he flew off entirely.
Mr. Harry Potter,
"It might not be my place to say this, but you and Tristan are probably much better off without him."
"Pff-- please, portkeys and planes exist, grandma. He'll be fine."
I’m staying in the hotel.
"Oh, Harry Potter, you can't fool me, there's more attraction between you and Draco than gold and Nifflers!" She laughed and waved him off. "Enjoy your vacation, love, Merlin knows you to deserve it. Now, shoo!"
"I'm certain he'd say the same thing about you, dear. You wouldn't believe how often I'd heard of you through him." She was smiling at him, and… It really reminded him of Molly, it was almost honey sweet, and as warm as the tea they sipped from. It was obvious that she cared deeply about Draco… and perhaps Harry held out hope that maybe she carded for him a bit, too.
Ah… and he would need to find an over-the-counter Wolfsbane potion for the upcoming moon, perhaps also scope out a reputable apothecary where he could get his ingredients for his own in the future. Smile widening, Draco nodded to himself, getting himself together. That would do him good. Going shopping, getting his mind off of everything. He just needed a change of scenery.
you git! I just don’t think he deserves
Did he… did he forget to tell her he was bi?
“Yeah, sure mate, what do you need? I mean- I can be your best man if you want, I just thought you’d get Ron-”
“She would be, yes.” She sounded a bit lost in thought. “Very good, Harry, dear.” She read the letter and sniffed once or twice. If this letter, and this woman, were to be believed, then her son was in safe and loving hands.
She frowned, crossing her arms and leaning against the doorway. “No. I haven’t seen him since our weekly lunch on Thursday.” Fuck. Well, Harry was quickly running out of places where Draco could be hiding. He dragged a hand down his face and sighed. Pansy was looking at him oddly, one dark eyebrow arched in question.
Harry,
Canonical ending of Half-blood Prince.
Ron and Hermione bickered over why Lucius and Narcissa would sent Draco to such a school-- Hermione thought it was to avoid the war while Ron was firmly set in his reasoning that the Russians knew some Dark magic that English wizards didn't and Draco was sent to learn. Harry, however, believed that Malfoy had run off to his father after their impromptu duel in the toilets and begged to be sent far away from Potter. At the very least, he didn't have to follow him quite so closely anymore, he could focus more on what Dumbledore needed him to do. He had a meeting with the Headmaster tonight and he needed to focus on whatever Dumbledore needed him to do.
"I came to talk to McGonagall about something, and I needed to talk to Sprout next… is she here?"
You’re an utter cocktease. Does it do you good to know that I read your letter
Remy grinned at him while Sapphire took care of paying the waiter. "That's a good sign, Draco. Can you imagine your life with him? The day to day, the big events?"
And that is exactly what he planned to do with Draco.
“Looks like you’ve been renamed, sorry about that,” Ametrine said with a grin. She leaned across the table to shake his hand, holding her daughter around her middle as she did so. “Ametrine, wife of the Potter Copy,” she said with a wink. Draco shook her hand with a slight nod.
“Underground train system? You Brits have one in London, I think you call it “The Tube.” What a silly name.”
“Oh, but you work with
Harry
The lycanthropy is not a deal-breaker at all. My own godfather had a close friendship with a werewolf, and they were fine. My godson’s father was that werewolf, too. I am in the process of finding my Animagus form to be with Draco on the full moons. If he ever comes home, that is. It wouldn’t surprise me that he’s doubting himself because of this, as we’ve been sending letters that pretty much confirm it.
Regardless of which option you vote for, it will be Ginny and Ron (and also kinda Hermione) who nominate him for the Fab 5
on the room. Again, she took his face in her hands and looked into his eyes. After a few moments, she hummed. “Bitten by... a werewolf, my love?”
Part 1 of the Battle of Hogwarts
“I can’t let the pancakes burn.”
“Well, I highly doubt it would be granted. Despite it all, we’ve got some of the best numbers in the department. I suppose when you’re the Boy Who Lived Twice, it’s hard to find something you can’t do.”
On to the content!!
“Make sure to pick up lunch while you’re out, Harry dear.”
Molly thought it over, setting her knitting aside and nodding slowly. “Well… Where did you two meet?”
Harry rose an eyebrow. “Uh, thanks? Have you already had breakfast? I was thinking about maybe making some pancakes…”
feel cheated. It’s not fair. We were already on our way to being the best damn Aurors they had, and you know it, and then this all happened, and I became a liability. I know you don’t see it that way, but you know what would have happened if I’d gone back. They would have all gotten calendars at their desks that told them when the full moon was. They’d be certain to avoid me the closer it got, most likely going so far as refusing to take lunch if I was in the cafe at the same time. It’s not fair. I want to make up for it all.
“Belinda,
Draco nodded at her. “Thank you. For everything.”
“Thank you, darling. I’ll expect you at seven.”
Yours,
“It’s-” Harry sighed and left. There was no hope of winning that battle. There was no stopping Belinda once she had an idea in her head. She was like some… meddling, well-meaning aunt, Harry supposed.
The thing about war is that a lot of people are lost… and when people are lost, those that remain feel the need to remember, which to a lot of young witches and wizards meant getting a tattoo, despite the negative stigma of the Dark Mark (which was much more a brand than ink, ask any magical tattooist.)
Usually, Harry Potter was not in the Critical and Highly Risky Incidents Ward at St. Mungo's, where his ex was being treated for a vicious dragon attack—3rd degree burns, bites, and all.
"I suppose you're moving in then. What will happen to the Manor?"
He and Harry were close as anything, their case stats were the highest on the force, and he’d been the most put-together of his friends for months. Why was it that when his luck ran out, it was always something drastic? No, no, he needed to rephrase. Why was it that when it concerned him, it was always so drastic? This was worse than that dinner they’d had. Worse by a mile, at least. What was he supposed to say. ‘Ta for thinking of me, but I don’t wanna bite you and give you the same curse’? Hell, he was fucked no matter what he did. As he thought of it, Harry was probably on his way over with a team of Aurors to drag him back. He would be obligated
“Why is that a joke?”
“He does, doesn’t he… I really need to find him. I need to make sure he doesn’t do something drastic and out of character.” Harry set down his teacup, stood up, and paused. “...it’s too early to go around and ask about him, isn’t it?” Neither Pansy nor Blaise would be awake. The pair of them liked their lie-ins, and it was only chance that Narcissa was awake and ready to have company.
“I understand, darling, no worries.” For the most part, their soup was had in private, then Narcissa brought out the appetizer and salad together- “So, Harry dear.” He swallowed the (delicious) bite of fried ravioli and turned his attention back to his hostess.
And so, the Golden Trio once again found themselves at Hogwarts. Neville-- apparently the leader of the student resistance-- welcomed them back with open arms.
Unfortunately, Harry was starting to run out of things to talk about. This was the longest it had ever taken to get an animal to trust him; normally he only needed about 20 minutes worth of material.
If he were alive, he would've been petrified. Death Eaters roaming the grounds, the Mark appearing over the school… for a sweet moment or two, Draco was glad he was dead and didn't have to worry… but then he started worrying about the other students, the innocents, his parents.
“Giving you some room to breathe away from everyone, my love.” She stood in front of him and looked him over. She took a small step forward and cupped his face in her hands. “Are you alright?”
Soon-to-be Professor H.J. Potter-Malfoy
“It’s… you know. It’s quite good, Harry.” She handed him his tea. “And you? How is your life?”
In all honesty, I didn't think much of becoming a professional Quidditch player… I suppose I thought teams would only want me for the Boy Wonder aspect and not the fact that I was good on a broom… also, now that I think of it, a lot of people pushed me to become an auror… likely for the same reason. (Puts a lot of faith in the Ministry if Harry Potter is chasing bad guys, doesn't it?) Really, it would've been fun for a couple years, and I really do enjoy it, but I think teaching would be a much better fit. Besides, you and I can have seekers' games and teach Teddy to fly. It'll be fine.
to register with the Ministry. They'll blacklist me. You really think they'll be perfectly fine with allowing a werewolf to be an Auror? At best I'll be moved to desk duty until they eventually push me to quit. I understand that your friends have been actively working against the werewolf legislation, but we still have quite a long way to go. I'll most likely be sacked, and no job will take me after that. Ex-Death Eater
Harry opened his mouth to ask more about the godfather he felt he never truly got to know, when Porthos flapped in with a letter attached to his foot. Maybe Ron or Robards asking Harry where the hell he was…
“Lucius… I am deeply sorry for this. None of us had known the extent of the strain Draco was under. Being around dark magic for so long… It must’ve poisoned him.” He knew, of course, that Riddle had taken over the Manor and everything in it. “We want to support you. The staff and I, we want to help, however we can--”
Draco hummed, setting his glass down and licking his lips with small dabs of his tongue, like a kitten. "They can still hope, unfortunately."
He nods and offers his arm to her with a smile, like he's seen Draco do at the occasional Ministry gala. "Fantastic idea, Mrs. Malfoy." Apparently that was the right move, because she was smiling at him and taking his arm, leading them to the dining room. There was a big, long table where in their hayday the Malfoys probably entertained a hundred guests. As it was, the only places set were at the head of the table, and just beside it.
How about we agree to spoil each other? I know you, you’ll argue against everything I try to do for you, and I’m never opposed to being treated the way I ought to be. We’ll take care of each other, Harry. I promise.
He blushed and took another few bites of his crêpe tower. Truly, this was more dessert than breakfast or lunch, but he didn't care. It was sent from heaven itself, of that he was certain. And after the night he'd had, he felt maybe this wasn't the worst way to recover.
“I was an Auror,” he said, trying to lay this conversation to rest.
“Oh, as Draco’s suitor, of course. You have picked out your courting gift already, haven’t you?”
Harry love,
He quieted after a while and wiped his tears, sniffling a bit. “...I’m sorry I got tears all over your dress,” he murmured, trying to lighten the mood just a bit. “Thank you for… all that.”
“Anything you’d like in particular?” He shrugged on the jacket and ran a hand through his hair— he’d been using Sleekeazy's more often in the morning, so hair hair was more curls than just a mess. “Somewhere on Diagon?”
I miss you,
“Right. Sorry. I, uh… I’m not so good with plants.” Alfred let out a surprisingly Draco-like huff that had both Harry and Neville chuckling.
I’m not entirely me, right now.
It felt like all of Draco’s thoughts came to a screeching stop. “...Pardon?” Two squibs in the family, and so close to his own age? He felt his chest tighten. “I… I’m sorry, I didn’t know-”
I'll wait up for you, my love, and I'll leave the wards keyed in for you too. Take a Portkey in to London and
“That bloody terrifying, huh? I keep telling you, you’re going to be fine. You practically raised the rest of the boys in the dorm.” He looked over at Hermione and winked. “Taught us all how to shave with magic in our third year, only one of us who knew how.”
“Of course it counts. You can’t learn it overnight, and I believe you had to unlearn a few things from the war, as well. Progress is progress, darling, and should be celebrated.”
"Yes, Draco? Found something else you like?" She came closer and hummed when he pointed at the necklace. "Oh! I crafted that one. I envisioned it as a little drop of blood, or a pomegranate seed. Do you like it?"
Harry,
“What? You are? Since when?”
Oh boy… "Will do. So… what are you going to teach me?"
The case held a multitude of gorgeous pieces, from dangling earrings and delicate rings to statement pendants and lux bangles and chains. More than a few sparkling gems were the same shade of Harry's eyes, and that made Draco bite his tongue. Sapphire picked up a lovely bracelet made of silver. “Now, darling, how about this one.”
Draco, do you want to have other children, besides Teddy? I know he’s wonderful and sweet and he’s already practically ours, but do you also want babies with me? You know I’ve always wanted a big family, but I would never pressure you into having (more?) children with me. I think Luna would be particularly keen to carry for us, if you do want them, however. She adores you, and quite honestly you could be brother and sister, by how much you look alike. Maybe cousins. My point is, think it over and get back to me. This isn’t something we need to rush and decide on now.
My darling, light of my life,
“Don’t be silly, we’ll have you caught up by the end of the night,” October assured him, a slight nudge to his side. “My sister Sapphire and my lovely wife Miranda,” he announced, introducing the two women who came bearing food. Sapphire definitely looked like a Malfoy, she had the platinum blonde hair, though her eyes were a warmer blue, not icy like his father’s. Miranda, he guessed, wasn’t French, her olive skin and curly hair pointing towards Italian heritage.
“I don’t see why not. If he’s there, you’ll have confirmation he’s fine. If he’s not there, you have good reason to worry. If you see him, be sure to send him my way, yes? I have words for him.”
He finally managed, “
Draco shot him an annoyed look. "Enough. Yes, they are. The perimeter is secure?" Draco waved his wand, and Harry watched the air around them shimmer to indicate that the wards were indeed active. Harry always did love to see the pearly shine of Draco's wards. It put his mind at ease.
On other subjects, yes, I have been keeping a close eye. I don’t suppose any of the sudden funding her programs have received came from the Gringotts accounts of any particular Boy Wonders, did they? One might consider that a conflict of interests, love. Though I am impressed by the work Granger is doing. I’ve sent along a couple books that may help her in her own quest.
Aunt Gwen Roots
The Baron leaned forward and clapped a hand on Draco's shoulder. “Right you are. Everyone has a lot of things to think of, maybe you're right.” He floated off without a goodbye and passed through the wall he'd appeared through.
"Indeed it is." A flick of his wrist showed the containment charms and 'fence hexes' that Harry had set up. "Ready?" Draco gave him a nod, his wand at the ready. Right then. No time for fanfare, they might set off alarms the second they stepped on the property. Harry nodded back at him in confirmation, and they both dashed towards the house, crossing the property line.
“I suppose so… but don’t be afraid to give yourself time to heal and rest. It takes a lot out of you.” She cupped his face and brushed a bit of hair out of his eyes. “So hard on yourself, Draco… give yourself a break, hm?”
“Don’t think of Euthymia less for serving me, Potter. Like you, I only want the best magical ink, so here I am.” Euthymia patted Draco’s non-inked shoulder fondly, and watched from the corner of her eye as Harry’s dark skin flushed. “Have a seat, Potter, don't just stand there ogling me.”
“I'm not dying, Draco, I'm having a baby.”
Narcissa seemed to take a moment to gather herself before nodding. “Thank you, Harry.” He swallowed thickly and nodded. They stood in silence for a moment or two.
Damn right I’m concerned, you bastard. They were quiet for a moment or two before Harry glanced back down at the picture of Sirius.
Ron frowned slightly and shook his head. “No, not me. Harry.”
“Yes, I quite think so. You make excellent company, you know."
The estate in Amherst was much as Lucius and Narcissa had left it some 15 years ago, when they'd last visited. Draco had been a young boy then, taking advantage of the large grounds and his child's broom as much as his parents would let him. They'd escaped some of the fallout of the Dark Lord's first defeat there-- after Lucius’ trial where he'd confessed to being under the Imperius curse to do his bidding. They'd needed time to relax, to replan their lives, to come out of the fray stronger and seemingly unscathed. They had happy memories in Amherst… but their arrival that day was not one of them.
He nodded, glancing away from her. “I see.”
“I am saying he molded you into the perfect soldier, who found solace and wonder in the magical world and would give up his life for it. You forget that I saw you that night… no seventeen year old looked like you did. You walked to your own death and by the magic of luck alone were able to come back.”
“Well, he does say he plans to brew his own. It’ll only be the first time, he uses an over-the-counter potion—“ But he was cut off. Apparently Draco had
He sighed. “Yeah. I know.” Draco always had his heart in the right place. His head typically steered him off track. The two of them sat in silence for a few minutes, letting the emotions from Draco’s letter settle. Finally, Narcissa looked over at him.
“Hey, Alfred,” Neville said with a laugh. “How are we today, buddy?” The plant grumbled a bit, shifting in the pot a bit, absolutely responding to Neville, seemingly talking about his day. Harry wondered if Neville could
"No, trying to help him all I can. He's a good friend and he's saved my life a number of times, he's the best partner I could've asked for. Even if I hadn't fallen in love with him, I'd still be trying to do right by him now."
Pansy was not the only one who was late. The sinking feeling deepened.
“Me neither, Potter, but you always were the exception.” With a pinched smile and a flick of his wand, Malfoy set his own luggage on the desk and started unfurling hangers of clothing from his bag. A slow train of clothes made their way to the closet at the front of their room. Rather than risk any further collisions, Harry excused himself to the bathroom and turned on the shower.
As soon as he stepped into the kitchen, Draco pressed his head to the cupboard door. Bringing Harry here had been a terrible mistake, and Malfoys were no longer Making Mistakes. He had vowed it so, after his trial. Both mistakes and the Malfoy line would end with him.
