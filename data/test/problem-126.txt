Ron and Harry dug into the food, they could hear Molly and Ginny whining and calling to the two of them as they ate, but the two teens ignored them. Enjoying their meal in peace without the two harridans around for a bit.
"Okay, thank you," Sirius nodded as he turned and took over from Hermione in helping Ron head to the castle. "You know, when you get to know me better, maybe, maybe you'd like to live with me?" he asked, sounding afraid of the answer that Harry could give.
Hope you enjoy this chapter!
"Not a good idea to ignore it," Ron murmured, though it sounded forced.
"I wanted to, by Merlin that is all I wanted, but he escaped me, yelling for all to hear that I killed Lily and James. Then... the paper, I got the paper and there he was right on the front page," he said pointing at Ron, "on the front page was Pettigrew and I knew he would try to go for you Harry, and I couldn't let it happen, I couldn't. So, I escaped, went to see you, and then went after him. He's right here, and now I can finally bring the truth out and he can pay."
Thank you for the awesome comments and kudos. I do hope you are all enjoying the story so far, we still have a ways to go!
"That isn't for you to decide at all, Mrs Weasley," Sirius said once more as he could see that Harry was beginning to get angry with the accusations that Molly was flinging at him, "I will be like any other man that has become a parent, I will learn how to be one."
“Okay, I’ll give him that, but holding you?” Ron’s eyes narrowed, “What do you mean by that?”
"When I placed you there, I put up some wards, using what your mother had done to protect you from those that might want to harm you." Albus was cut off by a snort from Harry, "Yes, I know, they didn't protect you from anything inside, which is why I will not be sending you back. I've no doubt that Sirius is more than capable of keeping you safe and he has protections on the home that you will be staying at for a while before going to a place he wishes to have set up. He has asked Remus for his help in this case," he smiled, though it was strained as he looked at the young wizard.
“You know you can call me Ginny, Harry,” she said shyly as she played with the light cardigan that she was wearing over the dress.
Harry settled down, he heard the floo go and then light talking going on. He ignored it as he picked up the book and started to read. It was a few minutes later when he started to shift around in his chair. Feeling something odd in the room, he hadn’t been in there much. No one had really. Blinking as he felt a fog descending on him, he tried to push it away. Harry glanced around, wondering what could be causing it. His mind slowly started to go blank as he got up from his chair, the book he had been in the middle of reading falling to the floor as he moved towards a cabinet on the far side of the room.
“Albus,” Sirius called the man out of his thoughts, sipping his tea, “I think that the diary that was in Hogwarts, that Ginny Weasley was enchanted by, I think that might have been one as well.”
“I don't know, I was in the chair and then… here?” Harry said, his voice beginning to shake as he realised he couldn’t remember what had been going on and why he was now in Draco’s arms.
"Oh?" he murmured curiously.
“Yes,” he nodded, “It is one, that’s what the goblins have told me, they said that the fragments are an eighth of his soul, which means he had two more before that one.”
Ron grinned, “So, what are you doing for your birthday?” he asked him.
“I agree with Harry,” Ron said as Hermione turned to him, “I need time to think about it, to know what I feel about all this. As he said, you betrayed us. We trusted you to help us with something we thought we were struggling with. My spelling and the words I use get mixed up, and I asked you to help me and you turned that against me. My grades were so low in my first year, that if I hadn't done well on my exam particles, then I would have failed my first year, you… you were responsible for that. Because of all the false information you gave me and stupid me that should know better, believed it,” he said, berating not only Hermione but himself for believing in her. He was a wizard born, he should have known better.
Hello to you all!!!
"Thanks, Ron," he smiled, getting one back, "I just didn't want people to link me to Slytherin and Voldemort all the time if I went there. And I had met Draco, and he reminded me of my cousin too much."
Chapter Four
“It doesn’t matter no matter what you say, we will never trust you like we once did,” Harry told her, his voice going softer.
Sorry for disappearing for the last fiveish weeks. My mental health took a nosedive. Last month was the second anniversary of my mothers passing. Those that have read some of my older works from back then may have even seen the notice about it. It hit me a lot hard than I expected it to. And I just couldn't write, read or do anything much for so long. I'm getting better each day, not fully there but I would say about 80% at the least.
“Master Harry be welcome,” Kreacher muttered as he bowed at them and then left the room with a pop.
“You okay?” Harry asked him, a small frown on his face at how defeated his godfather looked.
“Yes you are, you fucking turned on us, making us believe falsehoods. It could have gotten so bad that we would have failed classes and then what would happen?” he asked her, yelling back. He was done being quiet about her behaviour.
“Yeah, I’ll make sure you do, Sirius should be finished by now,” he smiled softly as he guided his shaken friend past his mother and sister, even though they protested.
Thank you for the awesome comments and kudos. Love and adore you all. Hope that you are still enjoying this story!
Arthur glanced towards the house, “Surely Albus would have seen this as well?” he asked, wondering if the older wizard would have done, but already the doubt was in his mind.
“How are things going on now that you are Lord Black?” Albus asked as he stood as well.
"Thank you," he nodded, "I... I know why you sent me there, I never really understood it, a wizarding family would have been able to protect me."
Sirius glanced at him, a curious look in his eyes as he replied, "Yes, I do, you’re family Harry, and I would love it if you would. But if you... you want to stay with your family. I would understand."
“Voldemort, he is the one that created that one and the one Harry almost got grabbed by,” he answered him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sirius just grinned at the werewolf, “You asked for it,” he shrugged.
Harry tensed as arms went around him, "Sirius?"
“We were hoping that the two of you would be able to go to the Burrow for a bit. Remy and I need to head to the other house, something up with some of the work we have done with the wards,” Sirius said as the two of them started to head down the stairs.
"Well, this should change that," he said, patting the teen on the shoulder. Snape looked back towards the trial as Pettigrew was brought in first. One by one the two of them were called up to testify what they knew. Ron and Hermione could have also been called, but it was deemed unnecessary for having so many come as witnesses. Harry smiled in satisfaction as Pettigrew was sentenced to Azkaban for the rest of his life. It was then that Madam Bones announced the next case. There were a few shrieks, but not as many as there would be after hearing the testimony from Pettigrew.
“Ron, Harry, why don't you go and play with Ginny?” Molly suggested as she tried to take the work they were doing away from them.
"No," he murmured, "She and Uncle Vernon are not... happy that I'm at Hogwarts at all," he sighed.
Arthur shook his head, sighing, “No, he really wouldn’t. He is a great wizard, we all know that. But there are some things that he has never delved into, healing the damage caused by dark arts is one of the big things he has never picked up,” he added, understanding what Sirius meant.
Sorry for it being late, was supposed to post yesterday but I was busy melting in the heat. I do not do well in heat of any kind.
“That's what Sirius said,” Harry laughed, “Though he did say that Narcissa is going to hold him by the short and curlies for a while.”
“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, please…” she trailed off crying even more.
"You're not really going to pass it on are you?" Hermione asked him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Don’t worry, I heard enough,” Sirius said, shaking his head a little, “Ron needs a rain check,” he muttered.
"But nothing, my parents hid to save me," Harry said, taking a step away from Ron and Hermione. The two reached out to stop him, but he pulled away, "I hear them, I remember the green light, I remember my Dad, telling my Mum to take me and run, that he would hold Voldemort off. Then Voldemort, telling my Mum to get out the way, but she refused. She stood between us so I could live. She begged not for her life but for mine. She screams when he kills her, but she still doesn't move aside. Instead, the green light hits her,” he finished, taking a shuddering breath. He had pieced it all together from each time he got near the Dementors.
Harry gave a small nod, “yeah, I think I should. He knows that you’ve been around but not that we’ve actually talked more than a few words.”
Harry got up, a little shaky at the thought of such a betrayal. Rushing to his room, he searched through his drawers for all his first-year things. It took a few, but he found them and took them downstairs. Along with some that Hermione had redone with him.
“Yeah, sorry, Harry, but it might take a few days for them to fully break, and when it does you’ll have the worst headache, but it will clear up after a couple of hours,” he said, patting him on the shoulder, “it’ll be just fine, now eat up,” he advised, “I need to head to Gringotts, Draco will be coming by a little later as well, like you asked. And I’ll be with Narcissa at the bank. Remus, you have an errand as well?” he asked the werewolf.
Sirius nodded in agreement, “That's what I thought as well. Molly doesn't know what dark magic can really do. Your Dad, on the other hand, he would,” he sighed softly.
“Hello, Sirius,” came a friendly voice from behind him as he continued to watch.
“You will,” Draco nodded, “I’ve been doing so, I’ve no doubt you will as well,” he smirked a little when Harry sighed.
Ron winced, “I think I would have, I know Mum would have made sure I was reminded again of Uncle Fabien and Uncle Gideon and how they were killed by Death Eaters.”
“Why are you sorry? There's nothing wrong with me being friends with you. I’m fine to have friends outside of Ron,” he added.
Their handshake abruptly ended, and the two were about to say something when Madam Bones walked back in with a tall, dark wizard following behind her. "Shacklebolt, take him to the cells, don't let anyone see him, I want only the two I mention and you on him at all times. And I want the same for Sirius Black as well. The minister may try something," she warned as she gestured to the wizard unconscious and bound on the bed.
“Okay, here's the thing, I’m the youngest of six boys. I had no friends at all. I tried to hang out with them and they would always leave me behind, push me away, because I was too young to play the big boy games. I’d try to play with Ginny, but she hated doing that. I was a boy and not a good person to play with in her mind. So I was always alone, every time something came up, I was alone, left to the side nearly all the time,” he said as he tried to explain what he was feeling, “And then I made a friend, with you, and I finally had someone I could hang with, play with, have fun with and it was great, awesome, magical,” he snorted.
Hello to you all!!
“Do what, Kreacher?” Sirius asked, his voice shaking as he thought of his baby brother.
“Sure,” he nodded, handing his broom over to Sirius, “hold that for me?” he asked him.
The three finished their breakfast before heading to the carriages that would take them to the station. Walking through the throng of early arrivers to the station they were able to find a compartment, though once again it was occupied.
Sirius sighed and closed his eyes. “Right,” he murmured, “I need to talk to Molly,” he added getting up and heading out of the room.
“He hasn’t been,” Harry said before she could even speak a word, “So far he has done more to help us than hinder us, which he hasn’t done at all.” Harry growled at her, “Now drop it, Hermione,” he finished going to walk away.
“Mrs Weasley, Ginevra isn’t my friend, she’s just Ron's little sister. And that would be fine, but she keeps trying to stop me and Ron from having any type of fun,” Harry said as he took a step or two to beside his friend.
“You may enter!” came an annoyed voice from inside.
Sirius and Narcissa took in the sight. Draco kneeling on the floor, shaking with Harry in his arms, who looked a little uncertain as he looked around him. “What happened?” Sirius asked as he went over to them, kneeling beside them, he placed a calming hand on Draco’s back, and ruffled Harry's hair, trying to get the youngster's attention as Harry was looking around the room in puzzlement.
“He is a supreme flyer,” the redhead grinned.
Hope the beginning of your week has started well and that your weekend was awesome!
Hermione then walked away, leaving them alone as she said, “Goodbye Mrs Weasley,” she then left through the floo, an air of defeat around her.
Sirius walked out of the room and down the stairs. Heading out into the yard, he signalled to Arthur to call him inside. He still wanted to talk to the older wizard after all. “Sorry, Arthur,” he smiled.
Harry looked through them all, “yeah I can see where it works,” he grinned, “you know, I think… I think we should have had Ron over as well.”
“Well, you quit, you’re the only one that's been able to do that in almost fifty years.” Sirius pointed out to him.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yes, well," Mrs Weasley said, a frown on her face as she carried on, "I'll let Ron go, but don't leave your sister alone all the time. She deserves to spend some time with her friends as well," she huffed as she started to guide everyone to the Floo exit.
Sirius nodded, “I heard Ron and Harry talking about it. I know dark magic and that… that is some of the worst out there. I just need to know if you took her to a healer, a true one at St Mungo’s to make sure she was okay after it all,” he said, almost blurting it out.
"You could have done as we had done, as we all did!" Sirius yelled, "We fought back, we stood up, we would have died for them, for you, for anyone if it meant that someone else would live!"
“I know Ron, I would never force you to get to know someone. He did tell me that he had no choice but to follow the normal Malfoy family rules. But now that Sirius is back, he can go back to Black family rules and views. And since Sirius is in charge of that, they aren’t lining up with the Malfoy ones, so he can be more himself now and not a copy of his father,” he said as he thought of what Ron had told him about what it was like in the Malfoy family and why he wanted to follow the Black family under Sirius.
“The diary had a hold of her and she couldn’t let it go. She did figure out the diary was responsible and tried to throw it away,” Ron added, remembering what Harry had shown him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Thank you all for the awesome comments and kudos. I adore you all so much!
“How?” Remus deadpanned, eyebrows raised at him.
“Oh, you didn't have to do that, I understand why I don't have… Him any more,” Ron said, wrinkling his nose in distaste as he thought of the rat.
Thank you for the awesome comments and kudos, I do hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well.
Thank you so much for the awesome comments and kudos, love and adore you all. They have helped me a lot over the last few weeks. Snuggles to you all!!
Sirius almost collapsed at that moment, his mind going to Harry, “I’m sorry, but I am going to have to finish our meeting early, I need to get back to my godson.”
“They didn’t, or rather, Molly stopped them from taking her. I have already talked to Arthur about it and he's going to take Ginny to see someone.” Sirius said, reassuring him that something was already being done.
"They should," Remus nodded, "They should at least give him a proper trial now," he said, a soft, fond smile on his face, "You are very much like your mother," he murmured.
"And while that is wonderful that you are, you need to make sure that you are right to take care of a child, and you aren't," Molly said as she straightened up and looked at the wizard.
Hey all!!
"That's because I was never given one. I was taken from the scene, stunned, and then the next thing I know, I was in a cell in Azkaban," Sirius sighed, a strained look on his face.
“Wonder what that's about?” Ron grumbled.
“Yeah,” Harry nodded, as he concentrated on packing things away for a moment before sitting down on the camp bed and then taking a breath. “Part of me knows that you might not like what I have to say, but I need to.”
“Ron said it was because of his uncles,” he answered, remembering what his friend had told him.
How are you all this fine day!
Madam Bones broke the seal and checked the potion to verify what it was and then nodded, "Thank you, with your assistance and with Albus', would it be all right for the two of you to help me question Pettigrew of everything?" she asked.
“Oh,” Narcissa sat up straighter, “and what is that?”
“Yes, and I want to talk about taking Divination,” Sirius began, “Ron, you should know that no one in the wizarding world would be looking to that as a qualification,” he said as he looked to the redhead.
"And Harry only wishes for your son to come over, then I will be sending Ginny back," Sirius said firmly, "I have invited Ron to my home, not Ginny at Harry's request as he wants to spend some time with his best friend." he looked at the witch, daring her to keep trying.
Hey all!! Hope you are having a good week. If not, I hope a new chapter will cheer you all up!!
“Okay, I think the two of you should drop it, it’s not going to help you. There are other ones you can take. I don't mind helping in tutoring you in the subjects that you chose. To make sure that you can catch up with your year group,” Sirius suggested.
“Welcome mate,” Ron grinned, putting an arm around him. The redhead wasn’t happy when he spotted Hermione again, and had done nothing but complain about it the day that Harry, Sirius, and Remus had moved into their new home. He had come over to help, and Hermione had arrived before he was leaving.
“I think you should go home, I’m sorry Hermione, but it hurts,” Harry said quietly. And he and Ron both had to look away.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Hi Ginny," Harry gave her a nod, "Sirius, would it be all right for Ron to come over tomorrow?" he asked, as he thought about what he would be doing.
"Nonsense," Mrs Weasley bustled, "I'll send the two of them over."
"And with the fame, you couldn't?" Harry asked he was curious as to what the Headmaster could tell him. Nothing had been written down with what happened after Grindelwald's defeat.
Neville looked unsure but nodded, “okay, if you say so, Harry. I trust you.”
“What the hell is Malfoy doing here?” she hissed at him, eyes glaring towards the blond a few more times as some of the others walked over as well.
Hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well!
“No, I don't want anything to do with him, fuck Harry, knowing that your all chummy with him and… that hurts you know it's bad enough with Hermione but you as well,” he muttered darkly as he then closed the floo connection.
Ron nodded, eyes still narrowed as he wondered why Harry was stuck on being held a little, “What else can you tell me?” he asked him.
“You have to agree mate, it’s…” Seamus began, glancing over at the blond.
With that, Hermione picked up Crookshanks' carrier and grabbed the handle of her trunk. Giving her friends one last smile and bye, she headed to the exit to the muggle side.
“I won't, Sirius!” he called out behind him.
"Well, Sirius has, of course, mentioned that as soon as he was freed, that he would be taking custody of you. I have agreed that it is a wonderful idea," he answered him finally, putting down the bowl.
“I’m going to see if Ron will be able to bring some of his over as well. And Arthur,” Remus said as he got up to floo the Weasleys.
"Clever girl," Remus muttered, almost snorting. "And how would you know that?" he asked, though he had a feeling it would have something to do with a certain Potions Master.
"They are still your family, Harry, you should at least respect them for taking you in," Hermione told him, her voice a little snappish when she spoke.
“Thank you,” Harry said as he sat up, looking at the light breakfast he had been given. He smiled a little as he started to eat, knowing that what was there wouldn’t upset his stomach that much.
"Oh, Harry," he murmured.
“Molly, I think you need to get her checked out. The type of dark magic that was used, it could cause problems that you wouldn’t see unless someone checked her over. A proper full healer and not just a mediwitch like Poppy, she wasn't trained for that type of magic,” he tried to push her a little.
“Yeah,” he murmured, slumping at the mention of Hermione, “I… Hermione is… not in our good books at the moment,” he told him, being honest.
“I’m not,” Ron said, standing proud, “I know the rules of Gringotts, and I know that my life is yours should I deceive you or any other worker of this bank,” he added, he learned something from Bill after all.
Harry and Ron looked at him, “Hermione being her usual righteous self,” Harry was the one to answer him.
Sirius glanced at it, eyes narrowing, it was the one thing that they hadn’t checked in the room yet. Which was why Harry had been told not to touch anything in there. “What was it?” he wondered, thinking of what could be in there that would have called to another wizard when he felt nothing.
“Very well, I shall end our business now, you have the cup that you wished for,” the goblin nodded, understanding that the young wizard that Ron and Sirius was talking about was the heir of houses Black and Potter.
“Hey,” Harry nodded to her, the smile dropping from his face. He hadn’t wanted to let her come, but he was trying to give her a bit of a chance at getting back their friendship.
Snape hesitated for one more moment before he took the hand and shook it, "I don't know if I can forgive or forget what you put me through. I know I did get my own back at times."
"Make sure it is an anti-magus cell!" she called after him, "Headmaster, Professor Snape, Mr Potter," she said as she looked at all three of them in turn, "I may be calling on the two of you," she indicated Snape and Harry, "to come and testify for Mr Black," she finished.
Harry nodded, “yeah, I think he did, he even made sure that I was okay when we were done,” he added.
(See the end of the chapter for
"He'll be there," Remus told him, his voice gentle, "Don't worry, he isn't going to leave you."
Harry shook his head, "I saved you because you're Ron's baby sister. I wasn't going to let him down, he's my best friend. I knew he would be devastated if something happened to you. So I did it for him, not for you. I don't know you," he said, shaking his head, looking at Ron, "I know that sounds bad, but..."
“If you lie, child, your life is forfeit,” the goblin warned him.
Ron glanced at him, “okay,” he nodded, then once more looking to the ceiling. He knew he had some things to think about, he just hoped that it wouldn't strain his friendship with Harry even more. He had been wrong in what he had said yesterday, he knew that. But, in that moment, he had been hurt, feeling left behind like he always was as he grew up.
"I'm not..." Ron began to protest, clutching Scabbers closer, the rat struggling in his grasp.
Harry's eyes followed him until he was out of sight. Hermione looked at him and Ron sent him a reassuring smile. He walked over to Ron's bed and sat down as Madam Pomfrey began to check over the other two teens as the Headmaster left the room with Snape.
“She really is…” Remus trailed off, shaking his head and putting his own set down. He had gone through three, and all three of them were the same.
“Of course,” Ron snorted, and then laughed as though they wouldn't take to the air at least a few more times before they headed back to Hogwarts.
“Yeah, I wonder if she has been able to see someone about what she saw and went through. I know that if we were in the muggle world, she would be required to see someone. I know I could have done with someone to talk to about what happened. Though I’ve been talking to Sirius about a few things. I’ve only just started,” he added.
“Right,” he nodded, “That’s rather…”
“You okay?” he asked, seeing that his friend was physically shaking.
Sirius thought for a moment and then sighed, “I’m only telling you this because I think you have a right to know. But… do not tell anyone else, especially not Molly. Albus and Narcissa know what they are, but that's all,” he said to him, his voice taking on a forceful tone.
“But what has he had to lose to have things like that?” Sirius asked him, “You really need to think about what he has that you want, and then look at what he wants.”
"I'll see you soon, Harry," Sirius said as he hugged his godson tightly one last time before he followed the witch.
“Hmm, I’d rather not know, Ginevra,” he said with a shrug as he walked with Ron towards the Burrow and into the crooked house.
Arthur was confused, “What do you mean?”
Harry grinned, "Okay, Remus," he glanced around a bit, and took a breath, as though he was trying to gather his courage, "Would... would you be able to tell me a little of what school was like when you were there with my Dad?" he asked quickly, almost rushing the words out, afraid of how the older wizard would respond.
Hey all!!!
Hey all
Snape looked at the man, his eyes going a little wide at the words, "Black."
“I’m sorry, Sirius,” he told him, apologising, “and sorry to you as well Master Goblin, but it is somewhat urgent that I come here,” he added, turning to the goblin that Sirius had been in a meeting with.
“You give in too easily with him,” Remus sighed from behind him as he had walked in not long after Sirius.
Thank you for all the awesome comments and kudos! Love and adore you all!!!
“Hey yourself, you look like shit Harry, you sure you want to do this today?” he asked him, a worried frown on his face.
Pettigrew fell to the ground, but before he could do anything Sirius and Snape both sent a stunner to him, making sure he wasn't going to make a run for it. "I'll levitate," Snape said, "you help with them," he gestured at the teens.
Harry grinned as he threw another garden gnomes over the garden fence and into the field next door. He was once more at the Burrow. Though he was only there as Sirius was trying to get their new home sorted. Last few things that they needed to do before they could move in. Grimmauld Place was dark and dank. It gave Harry the shivers most of the time that they were there.
“Oh, my word!” Arthur said, hand covering his mouth, “Bill... Bill has come across a number of those, he told me what they are and what they can do, they are… they are…”
Thank you for all the awesome comments and kudos, love and adore you all. Hope you've enjoyed this chapter as well!
“I am, really!” Harry said as he started to move away from the hands that were patting him down.
“We… we need time. I can’t say that we’ll be as close as we used to be. We might not ever be best friends again but maybe we can be friends after a while,” Harry said, giving her a little hope. He didn’t know if he could be close to her again.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah,” Ron nodded, “let it just… drift for the day,” he snorted as he walked outside.
"Now, it will take time for Sirius to get something sorted for you to live in, for the both of you. He has a place, but it isn't the most pleasant of places. But I know that you won't want to go back to the Dursleys’, even though there are special wards around the property to protect you," he murmured, almost to himself.
Chapter Eleven
Enjoy!
“I know,” Harry said as he then went to the drawing-room. He walked inside and over by a chair was a side table with the books that he wanted to read. They were about the families in the wizarding world, something that Sirius wanted Harry to learn. Though it was mainly so it would inform him about why some people acted weirdly around him now that it was known that he was under Sirius care. Something like Draco happening again. There were a number of families that were linked to the Blacks enough to mean something.
“Yeah, but I don’t know what Ron is going to think about it,” he murmured.
(See the end of the chapter for
"He is the reason your parents are gone, Harry," Remus clarified bluntly, looking at the teen, trying to gauge what he was doing.
“When I look at the ones, you wrote after Hermione’s suggestions,” Sirius started, picking one up and glancing through it.
“He was your…”
“That's fine, I know he might not want to, I don't blame him, I’ve been rather horrid to him and Granger as well,” he added.
“Hello cousin,” Draco bowed politely to him, a softer look on his face.
“Oh, erm yeah,” Harry gave a nervous laugh, “It’s fine, I know you only did it to keep me away from it. Now I’m out of the room, I’m fine,” he smiled, though Draco could see he was still shaken by what had happened to him.
Harry and Ron looked at her, shocked on their faces, "Hermione," Ron began, "Do you remember me telling you about what happened in second year?" he asked her.
“I… I think we need a bit more time to think about it. It hasn’t been long since we found out what you have done. But it hurt Hermione. It hurts so much that you would betray the trust we had in you,” Harry said, a little softer as he looked to his… friend.
Harry frowned, but got up and rushed up to his room. He searched around and quickly found the essay for the last year and brought them down. Handing them over he asked, “Is something wrong?”
“I don't mind helping him as well,” Draco said, a little hesitant, “I know that there is some bad blood between the Malfoy family and the Weasley family, but…”
“They are fine. Molly was going on about you being disrespectful,” he said, almost singing at the words, but able to hold it back.
“I need to talk to you about Ginny,” Sirius told her, walking a little closer. The two boys hanging by the door to listen in.
“That's okay,” Remus smiled at him, “So which one do you want to take?”
"Really long-lived from what I hear," Remus said from where he is standing.
Harry knelt in front of the fire and made the call, “Hello Mrs Weasley, is Ron there? I’d like to talk to him please?” he asked politely.
Ron jumped up and helped the witch with her trunk before he and Harry got theirs down as well. "Mum should be waiting," he murmured, wishing that it would be his Dad for once. His mother had a tendency to embarrass them all with her actions and cooing she would do when she saw them all.
Sirius turned to him, holding his hand he smiled, "Well, looks like I'll finally be able to be the Godfather I wanted to be with you," he said as he pulled the young wizard towards him, wrapping his arms around him.
Ginny turned towards her brother, “And you're hogging my friend!” she yelled at him.
Chapter Thirteen
Molly just sniffed and turned back to Sirius, “You… telling him that Slytherins are fine when you were the opposite while at school.” She added, poking him in the chest, “how can you change like that… how could you think of them as being… being-”
"Can we talk about it later?" Harry whispered as he looked around, seeing some people watching and staring at them.
"But first, let's take you on a tour of the place so you don't get lost. There are some rooms you need to avoid because of magical reasons, I'll tell you about them so don't worry," Sirius grabbed his hand and pulled him up before taking him around Grimmauld place for the first time.
“Like a tutor?” Sirius asked as he thought for a moment, “that could be a good idea,” he nodded, smiling at the two of them.
“Sir, please,” Ron said, “I know Sirius is in an important meeting concerning the House of Black. But what I have is something that concerns the heir of House Black and Potter,” he told him, “He’s fallen ill and Sirius needs to get back because we think it’s magic-based.”
Sirius grinned, “nothing like a woman of House Black, out for vengeance,” he said softly.
“Harry?” came Ron’s worried and questioning call.
Sirius sighed, rolling his eyes, “That’s not what I want to talk to you about,” he told her, “Look, please sit with me and talk for a moment,” he suggested as he went to the dinner table and sat down.
“Yeah, just tell anyone that you know does divination,” he nodded.
“No, she and Mum are away for the day. So, Percy said it was fine for me to come on my own,” he grinned widely as the two then headed to Harry’s room.
"No, we don't," the woman said, "When you gave the kiss on sight order, as you know they are supposed to come through my desk first. When I heard you had pushed it through on your own, I looked into the case, there is no transcript of a trial."
“You sure?” Sirius asked him, “it will be hard work to catch up to both of them?” he reminded him.
Harry watched them go, feeling a little freer without Ginny there, "So, shall I show you my room, it's amazing!" he grinned as he headed out of the living room, Ron following behind him.
“Mum, we’re trying to work. I’m changing classes, we both are, and we need to go,” Ron sighed.
“I’m telling Mum!” she yelled back, whirling around and rushing towards the house. It didn’t take long for a loud yell coming from the kitchen.
"Yes," Albus nodded, "I know that living with the Dursely's was... not the best," he sighed.
“You sure?” he asked, thinking that they could go flying again for a bit.
“Where's Harry?” he asked, a little confused. He didn’t think Ron would be comfortable enough to come and meet him as he did.
"In about two hours you'll be able to walk around again, but I would suggest going easy for at least a week," she advised him as she took the flask and went to her office, only to have to almost dance out of the way as Snape was striding out of it, a small glass vial with a silvery liquid inside.
"Go on Bambi, I'll see you again soon, so don't you worry," Sirius smiled and then looked up at Snape, "take care of him for me, and tell Remus I'll speak with him soon."
Arthur nodded, “that's fine,” he agreed easily.
“He’s not feeling great at the moment,” Ron answered him, hurrying up the stairs, “I really don't think we should study. I think we should let him rest,” he sighed a little as he reached the bedroom door and walked in.
Hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well!
“Right, I’ll… I’ll take her to St Mungo's. Hopefully, they’ll be able to tell us if that thing is still hurting her,” Arthur said, not wanting to take a chance that Ginny could be hurting and not do anything.
“We’re going flying, come on,” George said as the two of them grabbed his arms, and even though he was protesting, walked out of the kitchen and into the garden with him.
“You dare tell Ginny who she can be friends with. You might not want to share Harry, but that doesn’t mean he can't have any other friends.”
Ron led the way back to his bedroom and walked inside, “Sorry for being a prat,” he apologised again.
“Yeah,” Sirius smiled, he already had plans to try and talk with Andromeda as soon as he could get her to answer his letters. The woman was a stubborn one. He wanted to bring her, Ted and their daughter back into the House of Black.
“Get her to talk to Albus, he now knows what caused the trouble, and he agrees that she needs to be seen too. Get him to tell her,” Sirius told him softly.
"But..."
Hey all!
“I… well… I noticed I wasn’t doing well, and neither was Ron,” he began, “We both asked Hermione to help us in making sure we got things right. She always tore our homework apart, telling us that most of what we have put was wrong and that she had mentioned the corrections that we needed to do.”

Enjoy this chapter!
“Well… he can prove himself to me. I know what Regulus and I were like when we were kids, and it wasn’t pretty,” he snorted, thinking of all the things that Kreacher and the other house-elves had found in their rooms when they cleaned it out.
“Okay, first, I was sceptical though to keep out of his way when he came over. I did. Went to the den and was going to read. Something enchanted me and he stopped me from touching it. From what I learned; it was like the diary. If I had opened it and put it on, it would have drained the life from me,” he shuddered. Sirius may have only told him a little of what could have happened to him. He realised quickly after that, that was what Ginny had gone through.
“The Locket,” Draco murmured, “he was reaching towards that. I can feel something really dark from it. I don't know what though,” he added, his voice levelling out now that he knew that his mother and cousin were there to help if Harry tried to go for it again. He could sense that the locket was bad news that it would cause harm to anyone that touched it.
They emerged from the tunnel and into the moonlit night. In the distance they could hear a howl, knowing that it was Remus. But it wasn't a sorrowful sound, it sounded more like joy, happiness. Sirius gave a small smile, "You know, Harry, your parents wanted me to raise you."
“I told you that I don't think that would happen. You go and be all chummy with him. I told you that I don't want to be part of this at all. I would let you be with it. But don't talk to me about him. I… I can't stand him, he’s… he just…” he paused for a breath.

Hey all
Thank you for the amazing comments and kudos, love you all so much!!!!
"Sirius, please!" Pettigrew begged, as he looked at Harry and then turned to Ron, "wasn't I good pet Ron, wasn't I?" he begged him.
Remus handed it over, "Thank you," he said with a small smile.
Ron nodded, “yeah, she’s been snapping at me any time we’re alone. Or rather away from Mum and Dad. The twins and Percy have heard what she’s been saying to me as well, but Mum always takes her side and says that all of us are lying. Percy is getting really pissed off. He’s thinking of moving out. He's sick of being called a liar when he tries to stand up for me,” he sighed heavily.
Draco looked up, parking at the news, “Oh, what’s he changing it too?” he asked.
"But I want to stay, I should be able to stay, Harry is my friend as well," Ginny protested as Sirius tried to get her to the floo.
Hey all!
“I know,” he nodded, “I know what family is like,” he sighed, “come on, my office would be a better place to talk,” he said leading the way to the other end of the house and to a small room that he kept locked only for himself to be able to enter. “Come and sit down,” he finished, gesturing to the chairs in the room. Taking one himself, he waited for Sirius to talk.
“This child wants to see one of our clients that are currently in a meeting,” he answered, nodding to his superiors and then gripping his spear tighter as he glared at Ron.
“Oh, Harry, you don't know any better,” she said condescendingly, “he just thinks that he makes a good father figure, but really he isn’t. He was so irresponsible in school, it was hard to take him seriously even out of it.”
“Thanks, Neville,” he smiled at him, “I know he was a bastard, to all of us, but he has changed, and it's a good change as well.”
Harry grinned as he looked at the pile of gifts he had opened, a lot of sweets and a few books on defence, and other things like that, but he was happiest when he had seen his guests arriving. He didn’t think anyone would come.
“Mrs Weasley, I suggest you leave my home,” Sirius’ voice was cold and dangerous, “Don’t even think about protesting. I am raising Harry to become the next Lord of House Black and Potter, and he needs to know a damn sight more than you think. It doesn’t matter what house they are in; they are allies. House Greengrass are allies of House Potter and are considered family friends. They are predominantly Slytherin, you forget that houses changed for each family. The Potters were once Slytherins until Harry’s great-great-grandfather, much like house Weasley,” he pointed out to her.
"Thank you," Malfoy gave a bow as he then left the table and headed back towards the Slytherin one.
Harry nodded in agreement, as Sirius and Remus then sat the two boys down going over what they would need to know to catch up in Arithmancy and Runes.
The two laughed as they carried on reading through them, “These are brilliant, I should tell those that take divination to do the same,” he snickered, having to lean on Harry as he laughed.
"It's good to see you both getting along," Albus smiled happily, as he watched the two shake hands without being forced.
Hello to you all!
Hey all
(See the end of the chapter for
“Exactly,” she smirked, “Though I have thought of something concerning the locket,” she said, “though, has it been destroyed?” she then asked.
“Yeah,” Harry said as they headed down to the ground. As soon as they landed Ginny was over to them, like a shot.
"That's great!" Ron almost yelled, as he quickly took a bite of the bacon sandwich he had put together.
We are getting through these chapters okay I think. Wondering if I should up the number of chapters per week to three. Hmmmm....
“You know what you told us about the diary and locket,” he mentioned glancing at the goblin.
“I’ve been trying my best,” Harry protested, going to sit down. He had never had to talk with someone about his grades before.
“That's fine, and well… I,” he paused for a moment, gathering his thoughts and putting them in some sort of order.
“The House of Black is a mess. My mother did a lot of damage to it. But I’m starting to get it all in order. Might take me a while, but I will have a house I can be proud of once more,” he answered, “Thankfully, Narcissa is still the same woman I remember, she just had no choice but to kowtow the Malfoy line since my mother wouldn’t back her up. And with no one there that she could turn to, Draco didn’t have a choice as well,” he sighed softly, “There are so many things that are messed up,” he muttered.
Harry opened his eyes and glanced at the red-headed witch that was making her way towards them. "Hello, Mrs Weasley," he greeted, though not letting go of Sirius at all.
“Where did this come from?” he asked as he gestured to the locket.
“I’ll try, I’ll give him a chance,” Ron told him finally.
“Then why am I getting E or A’s then?” Harry asked, frowning and even a little upset that he hadn’t been able to get a proper grade.
“Yes,”
Harry woke up that morning feeling as though he was going to be sick at any moment. He had Ron and Draco coming over. They were going to have a good study session. Though Ron was coming early to get away from Hermione. She had been bugging him the day before and he had ended up sending a plea to Harry to come over early. Harry didn’t mind at all so he had told him to come early. Getting up and dressing was a chore and a half as he finished dressing and went downstairs.
“Yes, well, I know I wouldn’t have been happy to have my school rival in my house at all. Let alone his mother as well,” Sirius muttered.
“Hello, Draco, if you want to talk with Harry, he’s in his room doing some work. He’s going to be changing his third year electives, so he might not want to talk,” Sirius warned him.
Harry glanced from one to the other, "What do you mean, Ron?" a little frown marring his face.
“I know, and I will,” Harry said, more determined to put aside what Hermione did and really knuckle down and make Sirius and his parents proud of him.
Enjoy?
"Of course," she nodded, "I'm going to send for Shacklebolt to come and take this thing away and get him set up as well. And into an anti-magus containment cell." With that, she left the room to call for Shacklebolt and another Auror.
"Poppy!" Snape called out, as he waited for the Hospital Matron to walk into the room, "Poppy!" he yelled again as Ron was helped over to one of the beds and settled down on it.
"I'll tell him," Harry nodded, giving into Malfoy's request easily. He could see the sincerity in the silver-blue eyes.
“Maybe, but I suppose we should have been more gentle about it,” he added.
“Because I wasn’t doing well. If I want to do something worthwhile, I need to have the right subjects. Someone told me a few falsehoods that I should have realised was that,” he said, berating himself as he looked to his work.
“One week, and if any is found, I won't let you again,” Sirius gave in, “I mean that, Harry, I won't stand for it,” he added as Harry darted towards his room.
"You?" he asked quietly.
“I know you had a number of them during school as well, that you would get out and find someone and bite them,” Sirius remembered how fearful Remus had been throughout most of their school years.
Thank you all so much for the awesome comments and kudos!!! You are all so amazing!!!!
"This time, you will finally pay for what you did," Sirius growled as he raised the wand he had taken from Ron.
"But Harry, I came all this way to see you," Ginny murmured, her voice going a little shy, but Harry could see that shyness was put on. That it was fake.
Hey all
“Like I said Mrs Weasley, what she did could have caused us a lot of major problems. This is something that Ron, Hermione, and I have to work out between us, you do not need to… butt into our business,” Harry told her, keeping his voice calm and even.
Draco nodded, “I’m sorry,” he murmured.
“Harry, I’m going to scan you a second all right?” he asked, getting a nod in response. Sirius scanned him and there was a slight glow around the scar. He slumped, “yeah, it is going to have to talk to the goblins about it, we need to find out what they can do to help.”
Hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well!
Ron nodded, "Shi-" he began, only to be cut off as Hermione reached around Harry and smacked him on the back of the head. "Ow!" Ron said, glaring at the witch, "What was that?"
The two talked for a while longer, coming up with a stable plan in getting the cup. When Narcissa and Draco left, Remus came out of the library and the little family sat down for dinner together. Both of the adults could see that Harry was in a more subdued mood than he had been that morning.
“I just wanted to be useful,” she cried, arms on the table and her head buried in them as she sobbed.
And I hope you liked what I did for the Samhain holiday. I'm a little nervous about it all. I've actually have a document full of the traditions and holidays that I made up for this story (may even use them for other fics one day).
"Thank you for bringing him back, Severus," Albus said as soon as the two of them appeared in his office. The old wizard had beaten the two of them back to the castle since he had taken his office floo instead of the public one back to the school. "I would like to speak with Harry for a moment, I'll let him go back to his dorm a little later."
“I think we should go,” Sirius whispered as he and Harry went through the floo, “Ron, make sure your Dad takes Ginny, don't let Molly browbeat him,” he warned him.
Sirius let him go and then looked at Snape, "Snape, thank you," he said, holding out a hand to the wizard, "I know I was a right bastard to you when we were at school, and I have no reason to give, all I can do is apologise, and I am sorry for everything I did."
“Welcome, and I’m… I’m glad that you're all right,” he smiled softly, as he sat down on the chair beside him.
Chapter Six
“Yeah, I heard it in the staff room, a warning not to cross Harry,” Remus snorted, “or something will happen to you.”
Hermione stood up, wand pointed at the two of them, "You can't trust anyone," she remarked. Sending Harry, a quick look, "He's a werewolf."
“Thanks for telling us, I think from now on, you might have to come here more than Harry going there. Hope you don't mind,” Sirius said as he held Harry tightly. The teen had never been given the chance to grieve for his parents, and being reminded that he had lost them, wasn’t easy now that he could have that time.
Draco looked away, “I wouldn’t do that. I don't have to do that anymore. My father,” he spat, “doesn’t control me anymore,” he added, gathering his courage and looking at her.
“And with these things, there's a chance he could,” Narcissa nodded.
"Potter, we need to leave," he told him, his voice almost gentle instead of the harsh growl that he would use when speaking to Harry.
“Okay, I really don't like this at all,” Ron muttered, rolling his eyes. He would have to try and keep his temper. He had been working on it when Harry had called him out on it a few months ago. That he should try and learn to hold it and let things go easier.
"But they would have taken you out, to show you off to let the fame that had been heaped on you fall on you at such a young age. I wanted you to be away from that. When I... I defeated Grindelwald, I had that fame heaped on me, it was the worst thing that had ever happened as far as I'm concerned," he spoke softly, almost hesitantly, "All I wanted was to rest, to be a normal man and to carry on with what I wanted to do in my life."
"There is one more thing I need to tell you about, Malfoy, he asked to pass on a message," Harry said, remembering the blond.
“Okay,” he nodded, “Yell if you need something. Narcissa and Draco should be arriving soon,” he added as a small warning, though he knew that Harry would be well behaved.
Remus went to the library, and Sirius couldn’t help but grunt at him, “always a bookworm,” he muttered to himself as he walked into the floo receiving room just as the floo started to activate. It didn’t take long for him to accept the connection and for Narcissa and Draco to come through.
“That’s, really good,” Ron said slowly and carefully, “I still don't like him, I know he’s your family and you’ll have to be nice to him. But well….”
Thank you so much for the awesome comments and kudos, Love you all!
“Ronald, you will do as I say!” she demanded, almost looking and sounding like a spoilt child when they weren’t getting their way.
“They were, it’s only been in the last 100 that they have sided with light,” Narcissa nodded, she remembered her lessons on the families better.
Harry and Ron shared a glance, “Well, she wasn't really herself. She had part of her memory missing when Voldemort took over,” Harry began.
"Yeah, yeah," Ron muttered, rolling his eyes. He wanted to have fun in the summer. And with Harry now with a wizarding family, he might be able to visit and have some fun with Harry during the holidays instead of having to be around family all the time.
“Yeah,” he sighed, “I’d rather not get into it anymore, to be honest,” he told him.
“I won't, I’m only going to the drawing-room over there, there were some books that Sirius said were safe to read that he put in there for me,” Harry smiled at him as he then left Remus to go back to the library to try and figure out what else he could try to get rid of the brilliant blue hair.
“I think you should wait for Dad to get back. You should be able to talk to him better than Mum. Mum never wants to listen to anyone other than Dumbledore. We all know that he wouldn’t know that much about dark magic,” Ron said, wrinkling his nose a little.
“What happened?” he asked, Sirius right behind him.
Hope your week is going well!
“That's fine. I’m no longer sure I can trust her,” Arthur sighed heavily. Hermione seemed like such a good girl. He wondered why she had done it.
"That..." she began only to be stopped when Ron spoke up.
"Hang on," he huffed as he began to read. Eyes following the words as a smile broke out on his face.
"But what, Harry," Sirius asked gently, turning the young wizard around to face him, a serious look on the older wizard’s face.
"Welcome back, Severus," Dumbledore smiled at the man.
"I know we did. A prank stops being funny when the person being pranked doesn't find it funny," he nodded in agreement.
Harry stood nearby, Sirius next to him as Hermione settled down on another bed. Sirius placed a hand on Harry's shoulder, smiling at him, "You all right?" he asked him softly.
Hey all, hope you are all well!!
“This time?” Harry and Draco asked.
"It's okay, I understand, I'll just get Sirius to take her home," Harry smiled at him, ignoring Ginny as she tried to move closer to him.
“Looks like he likes you at least,” Harry grinned as he reached up a tentative hand and stroked the head.
Sirius turned back towards the young dark-haired teen, "James and I thought we were being clever, asking Peter Pettigrew to take my place as Secret Keeper, it was the perfect ruse, no one would think that James or I would let anyone else take that place. But I let him, I should never have let it happen, but I did."
"He can't be," Ron said once again.
Sirius sighed and then glanced towards Arthur, “I’ll talk about it in a moment, I want to talk with Ron first,” he told the older man.
“Working on that at the moment, thinking about talking to the Goblins more as to see if they have a method of doing so,” he sighed softly, “I’ve got it locked away at the moment, though I’ve found another one, or rather one has already been destroyed.”
"You don't have to call me that anymore," Remus said, "Especially since we'll be living together. so call me Remus,"
“Yeah, so much faster the Eroll,” the redhead grinned as the two started to try to catch the small bird.
"Professor," Harry began.
Remus put up only a token protest when he saw Harry grinning and nodding in agreement, “I know when I’m beat,” he muttered as they finished their breakfast amid laughter and jokes, hoping to cheer Harry up and distract him from any pain he was feeling.
Sirius sighed as Harry hugged him, “I know she isn’t right, Siri,” he murmured to him.
“Albus would have told us if we needed to take her to see someone,” she frowned, getting up, “now stop talking about it. I don't want to remember it and I don't want Ginny to even think of it!” she warned him. She returned to the stove.
“Harry, can you, can you hear me?” the voice behind him was familiar but he couldn’t place it, his mind was still slightly foggy. “Harry, please, you need to answer me?” the voice asked again as Harry’s head was moved around. He came face to face with worried silver-grey eyes and blond hair.
“You sure it’s all good?” Dean asked, a small frown on his face glancing at the blond. He remembered the things he said about muggle-borns all too well.
(See the end of the chapter for
“They may be Slytherins, but it’s not a bad thing. I used to think the same thing all the time when I was a child. But I grew up, I grew up because I had to. In a time of war, we thought anyone in Slytherin would become a death eater and would side with Voldemort. It wasn’t until we were out of the school that we saw that no matter what house they were in people from all four houses were death eaters. You met a Gryffindor one recently, remember,” he pointed out, reminding him of Pettigrew.
“I wish I could just… be somewhere else,” Ron sighed heavily.
“What happened exactly?” he asked, leaning closer.
"Good to see you again, Harry," the wizard said softly as he hugged the teenager tightly.
“Hermi-” he cut himself off, “she advised both Ron and I that it would be a good one for us to take, that we would be able to get really good marks in it and it would help us, later on, to have a subject that we were good at,” he slumped in his seat, tears in his eyes as he wondered how many lies Hermione had told him, and told to Ron as well.
“Okay, don't do too much,” he warned as he and Narcissa left the room.
Hope you all enjoy this chapter!
Harry was almost in a trance as he walked towards it. He didn’t even notice when the door to the room opened. A hand was reaching out towards a locket that was sitting innocently on the shelf, it was calling to Harry, to come and get it, take it and wear it. Open it. He heard a muffled yell of his name, but it was like he couldn’t answer it, like his body knew it was on a certain course and it couldn’t change. Arms went around his waist before he could touch it. He struggled in the grasp for a moment before the trance-like state he had been in broke and he found himself in the arms of someone that was shaking badly.
“Destroy the locket, I couldn’t do it, Master Reggie asked me, and I failed Master Reggie,” he continued to wail.
Harry nodded, giving him one last smile as he left the office. Fawkes flew over to Albus, as the man contemplated how to tell Harry what he knew, he didn't want to burden the teen, but now understood that Harry wasn't the child he hoped to be, but a young adult.
Hey all, hope you are enjoying this fic!
"Don't mind if we join you, Professor?" Harry asked, a smile on his face as he saw tired amber eyes glance up at them.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Hmm," Harry nodded, grabbing his trunk as they all started to leave the compartment, the throng of students heavy in the corridor, though they were a lot more polite when Remus joined them in leaving. Harry took the lead towards the door and stepped down from the train and onto the platform. His green eyes darting from one side to another, trying to spot Sirius.
“I know you would have,” Sirius reassured him, “Though I do want to ask why you chose divination?” he puzzled, he had noticed his godson had chosen something so woolly and wouldn’t really help him in any type of career in the wizarding world.
“Yeah,” Harry grinned as he put down the small basket and began to get out the food that Kreacher had packed for them. As soon as Sirius had said he would be carrying out Regulus’ last request, the elf had started treating them a lot nicer. Though there were still moments when he was a little nasty, especially towards Remus, he a lot better behaved now.
Hello All!
“Of course,” he nodded, watching the two of them run off towards the Burrow.
Remus snorted and rolled his eyes, “Not what I wanted to change Sirius,” he muttered as he left the room with Harry. “Don’t forget, if you’re going exploring to be very careful, and keep your wand on you at all times. Don’t touch anything, and any door with a red mark you do not touch as the room is cursed.”
Chapter Ten
Snape looked at him, observing everything he could. "You are much like your mother," he whispered.
“Sirius,” Harry said softly, “What’s going on?”
“Okay,” he nodded, taking a breath now and then to make sure he kept the rant that wanted to get out in. He had been trying so hard, but hearing Harry talking about Malfoy like that was riling him up. He didn’t want his friend to be near the snake. Even though they were family and looked like, they might be closer because of it.
Harry reeled back, eyes wide as they began to fill with tears at Ron’s words. “He thinks I'm like Hermione?!” his voice shook as Draco entered the room.
“No,” Ron said, standing up to her, “Mum, we’re trying to work, I don't care what you want, I’m doing this,” he added.
Molly looked at him, “And why have you changed? Really, why would you do something like that? I thought you were happy with your choices.” She questioned.
“Wow, yeah, really messy, took me a number of years to be able to make notes without making a mess. So you’re about normal. I bet your first-year notes were even worse,” Draco pointed out to him.
“Yeah,” Ron answered, “We could get a bit of practice in. I want to try out for the quidditch team now that Wood is gone. I want to try for the keeper position. I need some practice.”
"So, what was wrong? What was going on at the station?" Sirius asked, guiding Harry over to the sofa and sitting both of them down.
“But they’re Slytherins,” Ron added, glaring at Sirius, daring him to change his mind about that.
"Really?" he asked, a slow smile spreading across his face.
“Molly, please, she could be being harmed even now. That is some really bad dark magic,” he told her, not wanting to explain what it was as he didn’t want to scare her.
“Death Eaters aren't just from Hogwarts though, Ron. They weren’t just from Slytherin either,” Harry reminded him, sitting down on the camp bed.
“Have you told him that if he doesn’t shape up and follow the Black family line, or rather my line, then I’ll annul the marriage and you and Draco will be part of house Black and no longer of house Malfoy?” he asked her.
Harry thought for a moment and then nodded, “Sure, we can go flying for a bit?” he asked, a grin on his face as he wasn’t able to go flying where they were at the moment.
Chapter Two
"Right," he said slowly as he saw Ron nodding from beside him.
"You have a patient in Weasley there, concentrate on him. Make sure that no one revives this one while I floo for the Headmaster to come through, we will need to get Madam Bones in as well," he told her as he levitated Pettigrew over to another bed and bound him to it, redoing the stunner that was on the rat.
Remus just nodded, “Narcissa should be here soon, you should go and wait for her.”
Harry grinned a little, "Okay, let's eat."
Thank you for all the awesome comments and kudos!! Hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well!
Thank you for the awesome comments and kudos, love and adore you all!!!
“Okay then,” Sirius smiled, “the two of us will be happy to help get you up to speed.”
“He isn't your friend!” Ron yelled back, “he has told you twice now to leave us alone, so just do so. You-”
“Right,” Arthur nodded, voice tight, he had gripped the arm of his chair even tighter. “That bastard, he could come back.”
"Mother," Percy said from behind her, "It's obvious that they are being boys at the moment, let them have their time together," he added, "We should start heading home if you have left dinner cooking. It might ruin otherwise." Ever the diplomat in the family, Percy could see that Ron and Harry were getting annoyed. It was something he noticed during the summer as well, that his mother was always trying to push Ginny towards Harry, no matter how uncomfortable the brunette was with the attention.
“Yeah?” Harry answered as he walked into the room, smiling as he saw his godfather, the man was dressed in a nice looking suit. He had been wearing a lot of them over the last few days. Meeting with people concerning the house and then family members that he needed to speak with. Today was no different. He was going to be having Narcissa and Malfoy this afternoon for tea.
Hello all!!
With that Harry turned away from her, not wanting to look at her after she had just called him a liar. it was one thing he hated being called, as his so-called family called it him all the time. Knowing that he was in the right and Dudley and them were the liars. Ron gave him a nod, and the two of them turned to tune Hermione out as she tried to backtrack on what she had said. The two wondered who she was listening to, as Ron and Harry had talked about Dumbledore and how he regretted letting him live with his aunt and uncle.
Sirius gave a nod, “Right, I’ll talk to you soon about this problem,” he added as he then left the small cottage.
“It was fun, your friends are… nice,” Draco said softly, from where he had perched himself on a chair nearby.
Thank you all for the awesome comments and kudos! I hope you've enjoyed this chapter!
Harry held himself stiffly for a moment before he slowly relaxed into the hold. A feeling of safety and family spread through him, and he couldn't help the soft smile on his face as he wrapped his own arms around the emaciated wizard. "Let's hope." His voice was a soft murmur, as though he didn't want to say anything in case he cursed it.
"Sorry, Harry, Mum wouldn't let me go," Ron said softly.
Ron shook his head, "No way, I'm way too brash for Slytherin. Fred and George, I found out at the beginning of last year. I know why they pushed for Gryffindor, Mum would have killed them if they had gone to Slytherin."

“I did, that's why I used it,” he grinned.
Hope you are enjoying it so far!
“I’ll talk to Mum,” he nodded as there was a sudden banging from the door.
“He’ll know nothing because of you,” Molly interrupted, “you are teaching him that those that attacked his own parents are fine to be around!” she yelled.
Madam Bones looked relieved with him leaving, "Sirius Black," she said as he looked at him.
Sorry about not posting last week. I was on Holiday and even got the chance to visit Stonehenge last week. So back to normal this week
"Language, honestly, Ron, you can be such a... a, ugh," she muttered, not even able to think of a word to call her friend.
Hey all, do have another chapter from me.
Thank you for the amazing comments and kudos!! Love and adore you all.
Snape nodded, the barest hint of a smile on his face. "Yes, I knew her well, and while we had fallen out during our fifth year, your father was happy about that," he muttered, "But we started talking once more before you were born, slowly mending a friendship I had destroyed with careless words."
“Then yeah, I’ll do the same,” Ron nodded, looking at Harry, “I don't know what to, though. I’m not really good with other things.”
“You what?” Harry puzzled.
“You should hang around me for a bit, Harry, I bet we can have a lot more fun than you would with Ron. He’s so boring, always thinking about food or quidditch,” Ginny said with a sneer, as she looked at her other brother.
"Well, Mr Weasley," Pomfrey said as she stood up, "You'll be right as rain in no time," she told him as she finished her examination.
“Wow, don't ever cross a Witch from the Black line, they will devour you. A lot of the women in that line have the nickname black widows, not because they kill their husbands or that, but because they are deadly if crossed and angered,” Ron said, remembering something that Bill had told him.
Sirius nodded, “Right,” he sighed as he headed for the stairs. He could hear the ghoul acting out in the attic, but paid it no mind as he knocked on Ron’s door.
“Yeah, arithmancy and runes. Divination is a joke,” he snorted, “She predicted my death each lesson.”
Hope your weekend was a good one! And I hope that the week to come will be a great one for you all!
Ron grinned and nodded as Sirius left the two of them alone. Letting the boys have a bit of fun before Ron had to return home.
“Grimmauld Place!” Ron yelled out, hoping that the floo would be answered.
“You’ve already told me that she’s not welcome in your home,” she snipped, sparing him a quick glance.
"Why did Voldemort come after my parents?" he asked.
“We need to grow up at some point,” Harry grinned cheekily as he darted from the room.
Sirius walked back into the living room with Narcissa, “Sorry, Ron needs a rain check.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“It… you need to talk to the bank, they’ll be able to sort it out,” Narcissa said, her own voice now shaking after learning what the object was.
Hope your Monday is going well!
(See the end of the chapter for
"Minister Fudge, if you do not shut up, I will launch a full investigation into your dealings since you came in office, and I will make sure to turn up every single stone I can think of," she warned him.
Hey all!
“Yeah,” Harry grinned, “come on, Draco, we can fly for a bit longer until your mother comes,” he suggested, seeing Draco looking a little subdued.
“I think we should take a few days and then talk to her. We don't want this over our heads for a long time,” Harry said to Ron.
“Draco is part of the Black family and has been coming over; he and Harry have struck up a bit of a friendship. Ron is feeling left behind,” Sirius said, repeating a little of what Ron had told him.
"What's it say?" Hermione asked as she leaned closer, almost ready to take the letter from him as he was opening it too slowly for her peace of mind.
Ron walked into the room behind his friend and grimaced a little at the colour. It was dark green, with areas of blue here and there. "Slytherin colours?" he asked, wondering why it hasn't changed.
"Yeah," he nodded, grinning back, "Sirius is going to be meeting me at the train station. The Dursley's won't be there, and I won't be seeing them again," he answered Hermione.
As soon as Harry heard the voice, he stopped and looked down. Diving to the ground, he jumped off the broom as he levelled out, running a little to slow down his momentum. “Yeah?” he asked, sounding a little eager to talk to his friend.
“Everything okay?” Draco asked quietly as the two walked near him,
“I know, but that doesn’t stop my heart leaping into my throat,” he said as they walked out and into the garden, Arthur chuckling at him.
Ron closed his eyes for a moment and took a deep breath as he followed the goblin down to the offices that were further in the bank. Ron was too nervous to look around, he knew that he would never come down this corridor, as it was mainly for those that had money that needed meetings with the goblins. His family hadn’t had money in a very long time, since his grandfather's time if he remembered correctly.
“It might be one of the Horcruxes, we know he made three for a fact, but he could have done a number more,” Sirius said softly.
I hope that you have enjoyed this chapter!
“I am. Now go and have some fun,” Sirius laughed lightly.
Thank you for all the awesome and amazing comments and kudos. You have no idea how happy it makes me to see them, and while I may not reply, know that they are all appreciate immensely.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I… I wouldn’t have let it go like that!”
“No, it’s contained, there is another magic that is containing it, though I think the wards at Privet were shielding it from the rest of us so we couldn’t sense it,” Sirius said, mostly guessing.
“Of course they are, they’re not disgusting Slytherins like you,” Hermione snapped at him, sneering as the teens all looked at her.
“Harry, sweetie,” she said condescendingly, “I know you want to think of Malfoy as a friend, but he won't ever be that. He is a Slytherin, and he just uses people and throws them away when he is done, just like all of those of that house,” she added, glaring at Draco.
"I think not, Minister," Snape said, glaring at the man, eyes narrowed.
Sorry for not updating yesterday, a headache sapped everything I had, but feeling better today, so have a chapter!
Draco left his mother and Sirius downstairs. Taking them two at a time, he came to Harry’s door and knocked on it. It didn’t take long for Harry to open it, smiling when he saw Draco. “Hey, sorry, I don’t know if it was all right for me to come up here. I just think my mother and cousin would like to talk about something without me there,” he added.
“The wards that were anchored at Privet Drive and to Harry are breaking. It's going to make Harry feel a little weird, as they were blood wards and they are being broken before he turns seventeen. Normally if we had waited until then, Harry wouldn't have felt anything,” Sirius explained as he sat down himself, Kreacher popping into the room to serve them.
Harry looked around the large room. They were finally in their new home and had been for a day so far. He loved it, it was large, open and airy. He had a nice room, larger than he had ever had before. But he wasn't complaining. How could he? It was still like a dream for him. And now, he was finally fourteen. He was getting older, and he finally had his wish, his birthday wish since he knew how to make them, he had a family. He had friends and family that he loved.
"No, we're not, and I would suggest before waking him, that you stop him from being able to transform, he is an Animagus, takes the form of a rat," Snape told them, giving Sirius a look to tell him to be quiet.
"Stay away," Ron hissed, as Harry and Hermione went closer to his side.
"Yeah?" Harry replied, hope clouding his voice.
“Still, thank you, I don't know what would have happened, but from the way it sounded, it would have been bad,” he said, feeling more like himself the longer he was out of that room for.
“Okay,” Harry nodded, sharing a grin with Ron, “Though… I need to speak with Hermione one of the days about what she has done. But at the moment I’m too… angry… hurt by it all,” he added, looking at Sirius.
"I did as I had to," Malfoy turned to her for a moment before looking at Harry, "Some of us have no choice but to follow the family line on things. Some of us don't have anyone to back us. Not everything is so black and white, Granger," he finished, glancing at the young witch.
“All right, it’s on your head, Harry,” Seamus nodded as he and Dean walked off together, Neville slowly following behind them.
“You made our work be downgraded each time we asked you for help. I asked you and trusted you,” Ron said, his voice getting a little loud.
“How are you feeling?” he asked, checking the young wizard over.
Ron and Harry sat at the dinner table in the Burrow. They were working hard on some work that Remus and Sirius had sent them. It was also the day that they were going to be confronting Hermione on what she had done. To them, there was no good reason for her to do what she did. There couldn’t be. She had ruined their trust in her, and the betrayal that the two of them were still feeling was still painful to think about. It was going to be hard, but for now, they had a few before she would be arriving.
“Please Ron,” Harry said, begging him to listen to him and come, “Just come over, get to know him,” he said.
Ron looked at her, frowning even more with the behaviour that she was showing, “Ginny, can you just stop, you’re making Harry uncomfortable and that… that was really nasty,” he told her. Shaking his head at the way she was being. The little girl he had known was someone so completely different now.
“No,” Harry answered bluntly, “I’m sorry Mrs Weasley, but I have work I need to do. And so does Ron, and then we need to have a good talk with Hermione about something private,” he added, glancing up and taking the book back that the woman had taken from him.
“I will, but I need to know how it got here and who it once belonged to,” Sirius muttered as he called out, “Kreacher!”
Albus looked up from where he sat on his sofa in his home. It wasn’t often that he gave away the address of where he lived. He had guarded the place as much as he could over the decades since Grindelwald. Not wanting the chance of the one place he could rest and relax to be disturbed by just anyone. “Sirius,” he greeted the wizards. The young man had wanted to meet with him as soon as he could. So Albus had sent him the letter to be able to get in.
“You wanted a change,” he shrugged.
And now excuse me as I go back to writing a fic in a new fandom. Like seriously I get pulled in at the wrong time sometimes.
Draco walked over and looked over Harry's shoulder, “oh, I know this,” he said with a smile, “want a bit of help? The book really doesn’t explain it right on how to put them together. It just assumes that you already know,” he said as he leaned over and took up a pen, looking at it, “This a pen?” he asked.
“Ron, Harry,” came a shout.
“I know, but I still feel bad,” Sirius said as he opened the cage and a small spitfire of an owl darted from it and began to fly around the room, “sorry, was hoping he would calm down now that he was out of the store,” he sighed as the bird, dive-bombed Ron and Harry before grazing the top of their heads before flying around the room.
Draco nodded, “that's fine,” he said, a small smile on his face, though it wasn't a happy one, but more like sympathy.
“I know, trust me, I know. Came across one in Grimmauld Place, enchanted Harry into trying to open it,” Sirius shuddered, “Draco was able to see what was going on and stopped him. I think he might know what they are as well, I’m hoping not. But there is always that possibility with Lucius as a father,” he muttered, not liking the thought of Draco being exposed to the information on Horcruxes.
“Hermione is staying at the Burrow now until school. She’s done nothing but try and get me to study with her, to let her help me. I know she’s trying to show that she has changed, but the way she is going about it makes me really uncomfortable. I don't want to let her help at all,” Ron answered him.
“Remus, Harry needs to come home,” Ron said, “Just let him go to Sirius and I’ll explain,” he added, seeing the concerned look on the werewolves’ face.
Harry lay on his bed, Ron looking down at him, “Hey,” he grinned up at him.
"And I am a free wizard, Mrs Weasley," Sirius said as he placed a hand on Harry's shoulder, seeing the teenager starting to tense up.
“Oh, what are you working on?” she asked them, as she stepped over and began to look, “Why are you studying arithmancy?” she then asked, puzzled.
"He's right here, right here, I can make things right!" Sirius said as he glanced towards the bed. Where two young wizards and one young witch huddled together.
“Ah,” he nodded, “you both okay?” he asked, somewhat concerned for them. He knew that they were hurting badly for what Hermione had done to them.
"Sorry," Sirius winced, knowing that he was the cause of Ron's injury, "I didn't mean to get you, I meant to get the rat."
Harry got up, “Let's follow and find out,” he suggested.
Snape led the way to the hospital wing first. Pettigrew was still floating behind him as he snapped out, "Granger, open the doors!"
“I’m so fucking stupid,” he cursed himself as he left his room and headed downstairs. He needed to explain a few things to Harry. Maybe if he could make Harry see where he was coming from, he would be forgiven for being a prat.
I do hope you have all enjoyed this chapter!
Draco looked down at him, “What’s going on?” he asked, placing a hand on Harry’s back.
“Hello, Mrs Weasley,” she smiled at the motherly woman.
Hope you are having a good start to the week. Here is something for you all to enjoy!
(See the end of the chapter for
“That was really good Harry,” came a feminine voice from behind him.
Sirius stood up, leaving the teens on the floor, at the moment Harry was safe with Draco. The blond-haired teen didn’t look like he was going to be letting go of his godson any time soon with how tightly he was gripping him. Going over and glancing into the cabinet, he could feel the evilness coming from the locket. It was stronger than the others, but it blended in well enough that he wouldn’t have sensed it if it hadn't of called to Harry at all. Casting a charm he tried to get a read on it. Casting several others he went pale as he murmured to Narcissa what it was.
“They had no choice but to follow the blond prat,” Sirius snorted, he was no fan of Lucius Malfoy, not many were if they knew what he was truly like and didn’t see the manipulations that he did with those around him.
“So, she is the one that put that stupid nonsense in your head,” Harry snorted, not surprised, “Look, Ron, I was supposed to be in Slytherin, I really was, you know that. Would you have hated me?”
Harry closed his eyes and made a wish that he knew was futile. Turning around he saw Ginny standing there, wearing a nice yellow sundress, her hair done up special as well. Harry knew she was trying to draw attention to herself again. Ever since he had a go at her she had been the same. Molly had been even more determined to try and push the two of them together when he had first arrived. If it wasn't for the twins pulling a prank and taking their mother's attention away, he would have been stuck in the house with Ginny and not outside with Ron throwing the garden gnomes over the fence.
“It's fine to have other friends', Mum, but she's making him uncomfortable. She won't leave us alone. He already told her to go away and we want to have fun with just us,” Ron said, gripping his temper as best as he could when she saw Ginny look around his mother, a smirk on her face.
“Than… thank you,” Harry said, his voice shaking a little as he thought of what could have happened if he hadn’t been stopped by Draco. From what he could tell with the conversation it may have already taken a life.
“Okay,” he nodded, “thank you for having us,” Draco said again as he then went off towards Harry’s room. Having been shown where it was the last time he had been there.
"Was it really that bad?" Harry asked, looking at him, trying to see if he could tell if the man was lying to him.
“He rocked me, held me, comforted me. I was shaking, and he was just there,” he added, looking at his friend.
“It’s the same, he may not have been getting O’s all the time with his spelling, but that can be rectified,” he said.
“That’s because I have trouble with the words. I ask her to make sure I mean what I want to mean,” he huffed, he had always had trouble with reading and understanding a few of the words. He often got them mixed up. Though his grades could improve more if he was honest. He wasn't always doing his best since Hermione always said he messed up and got a lot of the facts he was putting down wrong.
“Hmm,” Draco nodded, “I could tell that there was something really bad about it, I just don't know what. Something to do with the soul I think,” he shrugged, “maybe my mother would be able to tell us better when she comes back.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Of course,” she said and was soon replaced by Ron.
“Narcissa is going to be bringing Draco over as well, do you think you can keep the peace?” he asked, grimacing a little. He knew that if he had been Harry’s age and told him he had to behave with Snape, he would have not reacted well.
"Sirius Black, he and my mother are related, their fathers were brothers," he answered him, clearing things up.
Arthur shuddered “my word, who, who was it?” he asked, voice shaking as he wanted to know the bastard that he needed to go after for hurting his baby girl.
“I… I never heard something so insulting, Ron, Ginny, Hermione come on we are leaving!” she yelled, turning on her heel and leaving through the floo connection.
Chapter Seven
Glancing behind him, he smiled warmly. ”Hey Arthur,” he greeted the older wizard, “How are things?” he asked him.
“Bella and getting to the cup that she had hidden,” Narcissa promoted.
"You are free to go," she smiled as she watched the Wizard as he went towards the gallery. The wizards and witches began to leave, though some remained behind. Most of the paparazzi remained trying to get a picture of the now free wizard and his famous godson.
“Oh, Harry dear, we know that you're just a little shy, but really, there is no need to call me Mrs Weasley at all, you can call me Aunt Molly, or even Mum,” Mrs Weasley said as she went closer to the teen.
“You should be able to get it since you're Head of House Black, and there is no one for the Lestrange family, you could go in there to sort the account out as well,” she reminded him.
"Expelliarmus!" Harry shouted; wand aimed at Snape. the wizard went flying, hitting the wall before falling to the floor. "Tell me?" he asked, "Tell me what happened that night, everyone says that it was because of you that Voldemort went after my parents. If it wasn't you, then who?" he pleaded with the crazed wizard.
Ron nodded after a moment of thought, “yeah okay, in a couple of days we should have her come to the Burrow and talk to her there.”
Harry stopped, almost causing Ron to stumble as he gripped his friend tightly, "You... you really mean that?" he whispered, shocked, "That I... I could live with you?"
“Sure, we’ll work with the both of you over what you should have learned this year,” Remus reassured him, “you’ll be working hard, but from what I’ve seen in these essays, you’ve got good minds, the both of you.”
“She was sabotaging our work, changing the right answers to wrong ones and making us believe that they were right,” he answered him, giving the short version. He didn’t want to talk about it.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thank you,” Sirius said, taking the cup and saucer, “right well in Grimmauld Place, Harry came across a dark artefact that I’ve had the goblins look at. It’s Slytherin's locket, the original.”
"Good," he smiled, as he looked over to the others, "And you all?"
Chapter Three
"Yes Madam," he nodded as he went over to the man and secured him before heading out.
Hey all
"Yes, I have no doubt Sirius will be able to tell you a lot about him. He was taken into your father's home after running away from his parents in his fifth year. Charlus was a good man, a very good man, he was a strong wizard and had a good head on his shoulders," he smiled, "I have no doubt that Sirius will tell you if you ask him."
“Really?” Albus frowned, “That has been lost to time for almost four hundred years,” he murmured, sipping his tea.
"Yeah," he crowed quietly, "I never have to be near them, I'm so happy about that. No more Dursley's."
"Seriously," Ron grumbled, "Next time you want to bite someone, try not to get me."
“Okay,” Harry said as he looked at the clock in his room, “Draco should be arriving,” he added as he got up to go and greet the other wizard.
"Not you, your rat!" Sirius snapped at him.
Thank you so much for the awesome and amazing comments and kudos! You are all so awesome!!
“I know for a fact that you got a bit wrong on your essays for DADA, but when I talked with you beforehand, you knew the answers already,” Remus said.
Hope you are all well!!!
“Why don't you go and ask him? Your cousin and I have some things that we need to talk about,” Narcissa told her son as she began to shoo him away.
“I’ve always had trouble with spelling. It’s why I asked Hermione to look things over in the first place,” Ron said with a shrug.
"Harry," came a female voice.
How was your weekend? I hope it was good and relaxing. And I hope that your week has gotten off to a great start!
Albus looked a little startled, but then shook it off as he looked at Harry, "Well, Harry," he said with a smile, "Sirius has been writing to me, about things that are happening now that he is free. And I fully endorse them," he added.
Glad so many of you are enjoying the fic so far!
“Herm-” he huffed, “you know, I’m just going to say I thought it would be easy as well. That I wouldn't have to do as many essays and writing. She put that in my head a lot,” he added softly.
Hope you enjoy!
Thank you for the amazing comments and kudos, I do hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well.
“They did. I went into another room, wanted to read through some of the books that Sirius recommended reading about the families in the wizarding world,” he told him, “So I was in the room, and something was pulling at me. I don't really remember much. But the next thing I know, I’m being held in Draco’s arms and he is keeping me from reaching for something, asking if I’m okay.” He finished, eyes wide as he then added a few more details of what happened when Narcissa and Sirius entered the room.
“Don’t know but at least they are having fun,” he smiled.
"Kreacher, he belongs to the Black family. He isn't too friendly to us. Doesn't like the fact that I turned my back on most of the family when I left," Sirius answered with a shrug, "If you give him an order he might follow it, I tend to just let him do as he needs to keep the place tidy and I'll deal with food. No doubt he'd try and poison it," he muttered darkly, glaring at the elf back.
Thank you for all the wonderful comments and kudos. You are all so amazing!!!!
“Why don’t you stay there and I’ll go and get him,” Ron suggested, quickly pushing Harry back into his chair again.
Molly turned to him, “No you’re not, there's no need!” she yelled.
Harry looked up, “Hermione’s a bitch,” was all he stated as Ron blinked and went over to his friend.
"I was to be their secret keeper, but it was too obvious. Everyone knew how close I was to James, to your father, he was my brother in all but blood," Sirius murmured.
“Yes?” she queried not even turning from what she was doing.
Sirius nodded “yeah, the bad blood between the two families is… bad, though that might be because they were on opposite sides this time.”
"I'm going to take our things to our rooms," Remus said, he already knew which rooms they were going to be staying in. Sirius had told him and showed him as he had stopped by a few days ago to make sure that the place was safe enough for them to remain for a while.
Ron winced at the honesty his friend was speaking. He hated the fact that his mother and Ginny were always trying to push him away from his best friend all the time. He thought with being away from the Burrow, he would be able to leave those worries behind.
A pop echoed in the quiet room, “What does nasty, shameful Master need with poor Kreacher?” the elf asked, bowing a little to the man.
"Hmm," Sirius hummed as he continued, "I would like to get to know you better, I know we've only just met. But you are my family, and I am yours."
Harry glanced up from where he had rested his head against the desk, “hey, Draco,” he smiled tiredly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I can’t,” he complained, “She fucking staying with us now. And I have her coming to me all the time, trying to get back into my good books and saying that she wants to help me with my studying. I keep having to lock myself in my room. Mum and Dad are getting annoyed with it.”
"But, you saved me, you come to the Burrow as well?" Ginny said, tears welling up in her eyes.
“Have a good think about what type of friend you want to be with Harry, he cares about you a lot, you’re his first friend. Don't ever forget that. You are the one closest to him,” he said as he got up from the camp bed that was set in Ron’s room.
“I know that, but I know that being friends with me can cause you problems, So I'm sorry about that,” he told him, shaking his head.
“Then don't come crying to me when he hurts you,” Hermione huffed, flouncing off towards Ginny.
“Sure, we can work on that,” Harry nodded, turning to Sirius and Remus, “Sure we can go there, just come and get me as soon as you get back, I don't want to be there for long in case they come back.”
“Yeah, I’ll show you some of the things Ron and I came up with to get good grades in that lesson.” He said as he turned to his work again, “I just want to try and understand this first.”
Ron watched him, seeing how animated the younger was and shaking his head. He had a feeling he wasn't going to be losing his best friend status, but Draco would be taking another, “okay,” Ron told him, stopping him mid-sentence as he had a feeling that Harry would have just carried on and on if he hadn’t.
“You talked about the chamber and Ginny?” he asked them both.
Thank you for all the awesome comments and kudos, I love and adore you all, thank you. Hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well.
Hope you enjoy!
“She didn’t mention anything more than that?" Sirius frowned, sighing heavily and shaking his head.
“In her case, yes, the Horcrux she had was a diary, when she started to write in it, it locked onto her and started to transfer itself to her and then drain her of magic and life,” he said, a little more bluntly than he intended to.
Sirius sat down and shook his head, “he isn’t, but I think Draco is going to be a better help than me at the moment,” he said softly.
“Oh, erm,” Ron said, hesitantly.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Now," Albus sighed a little, "Why don't you go and see your friends, let them know what is going on," he smiled.
“Yeah, it’s fine, really,” Harry reassured them, “Look, I know and understand what he was like at school, but we’re not at school and he can finally leave what his Dad told him behind him. Give him a chance, and you… you might make a friend,” he added, hoping they would give the blond a chance.
Harry thought about it for a moment before he nodded “yeah, you’re right, they were,” he put them away again and then to his surprise Draco began to tell him an easy way of learning the different setups for runes to make them all easier to remember.
Harry nodded, “yeah, I do, so I can see where I went wrong when I revise,” he told him.
“Lucius slipped Ginny Weasley a diary, a Horcrux into her cauldron her first year. I think she might still be suffering from some of the effects of it as well. Told Arthur to get her seen to, to make sure that she has healed from it, but with her behaviour, I doubt it,” Sirius said, and then noticed that Narcissa had paled.
Ron nodded, and then winced as he felt the birds claws dig in a little to keep himself on Ron’s head, “Yeah,” he sighed, reaching up and taking hold of the owl before settling him on his lap, “Think I’ll call you Canon,” he grinned.
Thank you for all the wonderful and amazing comments and kudos!!!! Love and adore you all!
“Hey Harry, everything okay? Wanna come over?” he asked, a joyful smile on his face.
"Don't even think of going anywhere near him," Sirius growled at him, getting in the way, "This time, I'll happily go back to Azkaban after killing you."
“Ginny, go away, we're trying to have some fun,” Ron told her bluntly.
“Wow, he’s so fast!” Harry laughed as Ron and he jumped up.
Ron looked at her, feeling sorry for causing her to cry. He closed his eyes, he had to fight against the need to soothe her, “Hermione, I don't know if we can ever trust you with anything. You go behind our backs with things, without telling us anything. How can we come back from this?” he asked looking at Harry for some form of guidance.
"No," Harry spoke calmly, going over to the man and placing a hand on his arm.
"Then we shall make sure there is one, for now, Potions Master Snape, I presume that you have some Veritaserum available for me to use in this case?" She asked the wizard.
"I'll say," Ron muttered, as he looked away when Harry gave him that look of disappointment. Harry had been telling them that they should try to react less when Malfoy comes near to try and lessen what he does. Or rather tries to do to them, as they normally got in trouble when they retaliated against the Slytherin.
“Right, so we have another, let's try and get an appointment with the goblins in a few days to see if we can get to it,” Sirius said as he heard some loud laughter coming from upstairs.
Arthur led the way into the Burrow going over to Molly, “I’m taking Ginny to St Mungo's in the morning to be checked out for dark magic damage,” he informed her.
“As you did,” Ron muttered bitterly.
"Yeah," Ron grinned.
“What do you mean?” Remus asked him, knowing that the other wizard had been having a number of meetings with Albus over the last few days.
“That's good, thank you, I’m going to start looking more into Voldemort's past, to see if I can find anything more about what he could have used,” Albus said softly.
“Not all Slytherins are bad,” Harry said, “or are you forgetting yourself and Pettigrew,” he added coldly, making Hermione gasped.
“He’s family,” Ron was the one to answer, “and I know, it’s a little weird. It is for me, too, to know that Harry’s been hanging out with him during the summer. But he’s welcome here,” he added.
“What seems to be the problem, Bloodscale?” a haughty voice came from behind the guard.
“I wanted to be needed,” she said, sniffling a little as she began to cry. “If you were always so smart then I wouldn’t be needed and I’d be alone again,” she told them, “I…”
“Hello, Hermione dear, the boys are at the table,” she said, gesturing to the two who were still working hard.
"Mum we have to get home," he said, giving Harry a look, one that said he was sorry for the way his mother was acting.
“Harry always gets anything he wants. New friends, new things, but for me? I’m dirt poor. Don't really have anything to myself, and the only friend that I really have is Harry,” Ron grumbled, though he sounded hurt and alone.
“I’m sorry, Harry,” Was the first thing past his lips, “but, can we talk, alone, I really want to explain a few things to you.”
“Yeah,” Harry nodded “but maybe we can do it again,” he added as he then started to head inside.
Chapter Twelve
Ron nodded, “I’m sorry,” he muttered, “I just… I just see Harry doing something without me and it hurts. It's like I’m being left behind again.”
“Look, I just want to talk for a bit, I know that you feel like you’ve been betrayed now that Harry is somewhat friendly with Draco. But you have to understand that they are also family. Much like you’ve become for Harry,” Sirius began.
"Really, Harry, did you have to rush off like that," Hermione huffed as she settled her wheeled truck beside her, Crookshanks carrier being settled on top of that as well, "My parents will be waiting on the other side, so I'm going to go now, we might be able to leave before the traffic really hits," she added, as she went over to Harry, "You write as much as possible," she warned him as she pulled her friend into a hug, pulling him away from Sirius.
“Albus never said we shouldn’t. He never even told us what to do, so why are you against it?” he asked her as the two of them started an argument.
What I said about Ron's family, you may recognise from another fic I wrote. It's somewhat like a mini headcanon I have for the family.
“Are you sure?” he asked again, still checking him over.
“To… learn from him?!” Ron explained, there was anger in his voice, but Harry could detect the hurt in there as well.
Harry watched as the woman very efficiently waited for the man to return to consciousness and quickly fed him the serum and asked her questions. Fudge was still blustering that people were lying. When the last question was answered. Madam Bones straightened up as Fudge continued his tirade.
Ron gulped again and closed his eyes for a second again and then followed the goblin into the room.
Right, my keyboard on my laptop is messing up big time, using an external is also causing a lot of problems for me. So I apologise now if I have more mistakes left behind than normal. I've been having this issue for a while, but it's really getting bad now.
Harry just gave a non-committal nod. As he knew he would be following Ron with this. He knew the wizarding world better than he did. "We should hurry and finish our breakfast, the coaches are going to be leaving soon," he murmured.
"Come on Ron you had to have been lying," Hermione rolled her eyes.
Harry nodded rapidly, "yeah, he said that he and his mother believed in you and that they are both happy you're free once more."
Thank you all for the amazing comments and kudos, they are all loved and adored and read many times over!
“No, she didn't, I didn’t even think that could be a problem.”
“I don’t want to see you Harry!” he yelled out, thinking that it was his friend.
"But they are all friends," Mrs Weasley tried once more.
Harry turned quickly, eyes lighting up as he saw the man waving his arm to get his attention. "Sirius!" he yelled out, rushing towards him, weaving in and out of the other students. Letting go of his trunk he wrapped his arms around Sirius' waist. It was still a little thin. But it wasn't as bad as the first time he had hugged the older man.
"Lemon drop?" Albus asked first, holding out a small bowl full of them.
“I didn’t!” she protested, “I wouldn’t do such a thing!”
“Yeah, I’m coming with you,” Ron said as the two of them quickly packed up. Molly protested to them all the way to the floo. “See you later Mum,” he told her as he was the last to go through. He slumped on the other side. Seeing a smile on his friend's face the two went to Harry's room to continue working on their school work for Remus and Sirius. They were more determined to work hard and prove to Molly and Hermione that they didn’t need the help.
Thank you so much for the comments and the kudos. I do hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well.
“Ron…” he began, and then shook his head, getting up and rushing out the room.
Hope you enjoy!!
Sirius got up from the chair and went over to Harry, hugging him and rocking him,” I’m sorry to tell you this, Harry,” he murmured.
“She didn’t want to listen at all,” he agreed. “Thinks that Albus would know about all this and would have told you,” he added.
“Oh, and what could he possibly help you with?” Hermione almost yelled as her hands went to her hips.
“Sure,” he replied, taking them and settled down to read through them. It didn’t take the two of them long to be able to see what was going on.
Hope your week has started off well!!! Sorry for not updating yesterday, was having a really bad day. So a day late, but it's here!!!
“Well, you know that Malfoy and his mother are related to Sirius, and you were right about telling him. It was a good thing I did. Been reading a few books. They are part of the Black family, meaning that they are somewhat my family as well.” He sighed a little as he saw Ron grimace.
Hermione looked up, her eyes were red as she turned to Harry, “I’m so sorry Harry, please, please don't leave me alone,” she begged him.
“I will, and I’m still so sorry. Once I started I didn’t know how to stop. And it was always nice to be needed. No one else wanted that of me and I… I liked being looked up to,” she said, trying to defend herself once more.
Thank you all for the amazing comments and Kudos. I do hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well.
“Cousin Sirius said that you were changing subjects,” he mentioned, hovering near the door, unsure of what he should do. There was only one chair in the room, and he didn’t want to be rude and sit on the bed.
“Do so, please, keep me informed of what's going on. I’d like to know if she’s okay. It’s harmful magic, and I really don't like the thought of her going through so much. She’s still only very young,” he added softly, patting Arthur on the shoulder.
“He doesn’t want to leave you behind, he wants you to join him. It is a new friendship, and he wants you beside him. He knows you care about him and thinks very highly of you. But sometimes he just needs to branch out a little more. You also have to remember that he isn’t just going to go out into the wizarding world as an unknown. He is the Heir of House Black and of House Potter. He's going to have to learn a lot that you won’t need,” Sirius told him, “All the traditions that you grew up with have relaxed, but a lot of people still follow them. I know I do, it’s hard since I know Harry doesn't,” he added, sighing softly.
“It's summer, you should be out playing and having fun, and Ginny is lonely. She’s all alone,” Molly said, trying to coax them into going with her daughter.
"What is it, Severus?" she asked as she walked in. Freezing as she saw who was now in her hospital wing.
“You think he would?” Ron asked him, a little curious.
"You are forgetting something rather important, Lupin," he told him, voice devoid of emotion.
"Cousin?" Harry blinked, wondering who the other teen was talking about.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I know, and he can pay, by being in Azkaban, with him captured, they... they should set you free," Harry said quietly, looking between the two men.
“Sirius Black is in a private meeting with Narcissa Malfoy and Sharpclaw, wait until he is free,” he growled at the teenager before him.
“No, you’re not,” Remus said as he walked past the room, “you’re still a teenager,” he muttered, running a hand through the bright blue hair that Sirius was charmed on him that morning. He still hadn't been able to get it back to normal, and the Animagus was being tight-lipped on how he had achieved it.
SURPRISE!!!!!! Second chapter for you all. Going to try and update again on Friday, do not hold me to it, you know what I'm like. BUT I WILL TRY!
Harry couldn’t help the little snort at the last bit. But he stood up and went to Sirius, “he is raising me the way my parents wanted,” he told her.
“I know, and I’m not the type to leave old food around, just give me a chance to prove it,” Harry told him, trying to bargain since he could see that begging wouldn't work.
Sirius checked him one last time before letting him go. “Okay,” he sighed, taking a breather a little as they started to talk about something else. Anything to get their minds off what could have happened.
Harry glanced at it, “yeah it is,” he nodded.
“Sorry,” Harry grinned a little sheepishly, “I don't mean to say that he hung the moon and stars, but he was really helpful,” he finished.
"I didn't kill them, I would never, they were my friends, my very best friends, my family!" Sirius protested, almost screaming the words out as he glared at Snape.
“Okay,” Harry nodded, “I… I would like to change. She keeps predicting my death,” he muttered.
“Wish you could stay for longer mate,” he grinned, shouldering the broom he had been using.
Molly huffed, but did so, turning the stove off as she then wandered over and sat down. Her eyes were hard and glaring at Sirius, “What is it?” she asked, impatiently.
"But it does. There is one thing the wizarding world values more than magic, and that's blood. Family lines are very important. With Harry and Malfoy both having those lines, and with Harry being a Godson to a Black as well. He should pass the message on as it's to do with family," Ron ran a hand through his hair as he put down his knife and fork, "ugh, I hate this stuff, never learned it right," he muttered to himself.
"Look, you don't have to accept or anything. I had a lot of time to think, in there, and I realised that I had become what I didn't want to be, just like my mother. I hated her with a passion for what she put me through, and I was practically doing the same to you. So I'm sorry, and I hope we can get past it. I doubt we will ever be bosom buddies, but I respect what you did. I know a little, even after all that time in there. So thank you for the help in making sure they listened and not kissed me on sight," he said, hand still out.
"Because over on that bed is Peter Pettigrew, believed to have been dead for the past 12 years," Sirius said as he gestured to the bed across the room, that held the unconscious and bed-bound man.
"Of course. I have several regrets in my life, and sending you to live with them is one of my main ones. I will forever regret not being able to find a family that would be able to take you in and keep you truly safe from the dangers in our world," he sighed softly, a regretful look on his face.
“Food in the kitchen, Harry,” he reminded him, not wanting the same trouble his own parents had with rotten food being left in rooms.
“I… I know, Harry, but my mind went to jealous town straight away, knowing that the two of you would be able to do a lot more than I could even dream of,” he sighed, flipping on his bed, “I’m really sorry, Harry. I know I have trouble with Slytherins, and out of the school, it doesn't mean shit. But Mum, she always went on about Slytherins and how they killed our uncles and that they were the cause of the war and all things like that.”
“Yeah, but she stole it back,” he nodded, sighing.
“Really?” she frowned, “I don't think it’s a good idea, it will be-”
Putting down the paper, the teenage wizard took the letter from the bird, giving them some bacon, "Thanks," he smiled. quickly stroking a hand on the feathered breast.
Hermione snorted, "Really, it's stupid," she muttered, "You should do as you want, Harry, ignore it."
(See the end of the chapter for
Sirius closed his eyes, taking a deep breath, “Fine,” he said, “I’ll stay for a bit longer, hope you don't mind,” he said, though the pleasant tone was forced. He looked back and saw the two boys. Gesturing to them, he walked outside Burrow into the garden.
“Dad,” Ron said quietly, “Do you think I could do the same?” he asked him. Unsure if he would be torn down and told no. His mother had done that when he suggested taking Arithmancy the first time.
"You two take care of your friend, Snape and I will be able to deal with this one," he suggested as he looked to Snape.
Sirius smiled softly “I’m fine, just didn’t think I would find out that there was… another of those things floating around. It just makes me curious about it,” he murmured, more to himself. Shaking his head, “Why don’t you two go and have a bit of fun. Ginny’s in her room at the moment. And I’m here to play buffer,” he added, seeing Harry's worried look towards the Burrow.
“That was awesome,” Harry grinned as the last guest had gone. Though the Weasleys and Draco were still there.
The two grinned, it wasn't Mrs Weasley or Ginny. This time it was Sirius. Finally, they could go back to Grimmauld Place.
Sirius strode over, grabbing the rat, "Let's see then. If it's a common rat this won’t hurt a bit," he muttered as he set the rat down on the lopsided piano and took a quick step back. Shooting spell after spell at it, as the rat ran and dodged. Remus stepped away from Snape for a moment and joined in. Within seconds, they finally hit the rat as it tried to flee from the room.
"The essay Snape set, it was easy to figure out after that," she replied almost smugly as Harry slowly stood up and pointed his wand at the two of them.
“Divination was just fine,” Molly said, though there was something in her tone that said not even she believed her own words.
"I'm keeping an eye on him," Remus muttered, as he walked over to where Snape was, taking the wand from the floor, where it had dropped and pointing his own on Snape as he started to come around, "Keep quiet and I won't do anything, Severus, maybe you could learn something," he pointed out to the Potions Master. Snape glared at him but remained quiet.
“So why?”
Harry took a step back, almost glaring at the audacity of the woman before him.
“So that's what Ginny was writing in, was one of those?” he asked, “she told me something about a diary,” he added seeing the look Sirius was giving him.
“At least you’re able to do something about it all now,” Albus tried to console him, unsure if it would be welcome.
Ron snorted, "I can put two and two together. And you behave more Slytherin-like at times. And you're not the only one that was meant for the house of snakes and got the lion," he shrugged as he walked over to the bed and sat down beside his friend.
“It’s fine, I’ll be like this for a couple of days according to Sirius,” he sighed, pulling himself into a sitting position with Ron’s help. Harry told him what Sirius had explained to him before the two of them started to get their work out and go through it. It was going to be the second time that Draco was over to tutor them in Arithmancy and Runes. Ron was looking forward to going through the Arithmancy part of the work. He found it a lot easier to deal with than Runes.
"Petunia," Snape snorted, "She hated the fact that your mother had magic and she didn't, she turned that hatred towards me and your mother after a while. I don't suppose living with her was... pleasant," he added, getting a meek nod from the teen beside him.
“Yeah, we need to prepare, now that we know about these things. We need to find them, destroy them and find the shade that's still around. As soon as we do that, then we can get rid of him for good,” Sirius smirked, eyes alight with fire. He needed that bastard destroyed for what he had done to those in his life and he would do his darndest to make sure that Harry remained safe. Getting up, “Right, I’m going to watch Harry and suffer a few heart attacks with those dives of his,” he snorted as Arthur got up as well.
Albus nodded, “Oh?” he asked, as he then poured the two of them some tea, “one sugar and milk if I remember correctly,” he added, glancing at the other.
“Sure,” Draco smiled a little as he got up and the two went outside again to fly.
“Well, Mum and Ginny aren’t there, so you should be fine to come over?” Ron suggested as he glanced at his friend.
“But money…”
Ron got up from his bed. He had been laying on it for almost an hour after Sirius had left him alone. He walked to his window and watched for a while. Harry was flying with the twins. The two brothers were diving and dodging as they went for the smaller wizard. Ron couldn’t help the small smile on his face as he watched. His friend was amazing in the air, and it was always fun to fly with him. You never really knew what would happen next with the green-eyed wizard.
“Come on,” Sirius said as he activated the floo and the two stepped through and into the warm kitchen of the Burrow. Harry looked around and saw Ron walking towards him.
"How are you, dear?" she asks gentle, a smile on her face as she glances from him and up to Sirius.
Ron closed the door and locked it with the muggle lock before using something Bill had given him and magically locking it as well. Bill had said that his mother wouldn’t be able to unlock it, but Percy and twins would. Just in case something happened. “Okay, we’re safe here now,” he sighed as he flopped down on his bed.
"Ward?" Harry blinked as he looked at the man, confused.
Thank you for the awesome and wonderful comments! Love and adore you all. Hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well.
"He was too powerful, I had no choice!" he yelled out, falling into a prayer position on the floor of the shack.
"Sure, if that's alright with you Molly?" he then asked as he glanced at the red-headed woman.
"Okay," Harry nodded, expecting Sirius to start doing so.
“Yeah, he saved me,” he nodded, “He took me out of there and he just held me. I was shaking so badly, Ron, so badly, and he just… held me,” he blinked, feeling a little odd with the thought circling his mind.
“Language and you think you can raise someone special like Harry,” she huffed, “you’re not even fit to raise a dog.”
Harry let the witch hug him, "I will, Hermione, and make sure you tell me when you go on holiday again. I know you've been talking about your parents taking you somewhere for the last month."
“There are rules in place for a reason,” Sirius reminded him.
“Ginevra,” Harry greeted politely, no longer using the nickname she had. Sirius had said it might be a way to show how distant he wanted to be with her. As using her nickname may give her the wrong impression.
“You will tell us Kreacher,” Narcissa said, causing the elf to look at her.
Ron turned and faced him, “I know, Sirius pointed that out to me, I need to get over it, and I’m going to try, I just...”
"I think not," Snape began as he slowly moved around the room, wand pointed at the two wizards, ready to cast a spell at any moment. "You told him where they were," he hissed, eyes deadly, "you told him where Lily was."
Hey all!!
Harry looked from his friend back to the blond, "Okay, so what is the message?" he asked the Slytherin.
Harry gave a small smile back before standing, "Thank you for telling me, though... one thing I still want to know."
"Sorry to interrupt your meal, but I ask that you pass on a message from my mother to her cousin when you see him," Malfoy said quietly, his tone remaining polite and refraining from saying anything to Ron and Hermione and their attitude.
Chapter Seventeen
“I’m… I’m going to see Harry,” he said as he darted after the brunette.
"Sirius Black," he sighed, shaking his head.
Narcissa went closer, “It feels deadly,” she said quietly, “Like it would harm the very soul of the person who touched it. But there is something else around it,” she added as she refused to even touch it.
Hope you've enjoyed this chapter as well.
"We'll be ready," Snape said with a sharp nod.
Hermione moved slowly, but she sat down and then looked at the two easy that were pushed towards them. She looked them over, going a little pale as she noted that there was a third set of writing on the first one. The one that she had changed. “I…”
Hope you have enjoyed this chapter!
Enjoy another chapter.
“Same here, I don't know if I want her at the Burrow. I know that we are going to have her there soon, as you promised her parents. But I might not talk to her much when she is,” Ron told his Dad.
“Yeah,” Harry nodded, looking away.
“Yeah, I think it might be best. Ginny and Mum are getting worse,” Ron nodded as he went back through the floo.
It took a few moments before the owl finally landed on Ron’s head, preening the red hair as he settled down on his new perch. “Well,” Ron grumbled, though there was clear amusement in his eyes.
Enjoy!
“Yeah, though I’m not. Albus doesn’t know dark magic as I do. And especially this type,” he began.
Hope you are all still enjoying this story. Here you go with another chapter of it!
"More fool me, but I did, with revenge in my heart for the death of my brother, I went after him. Leaving you with Hagrid to keep you safe until I could get you later. But he tricked me, he actually did it, he tricked me," Sirius said, hands pulling at his hair as he thought of that night.
“A Horcrux,” Sirius finally told him.
“I want to know why you did it, Hermione?” Ron asked quietly, looking up as well.
"You should take the time to learn about the Black Family. Your grandmother was a Black as well. She was sister to Sirius Black's grandfather," Malfoy explained to him a little more clearly, "a lot of the families of the wizarding world are connected in some way," he finished.
“Hey Sirius, Draco really helped me with Runes and the layouts. I think he might be able to help Ron and I, in learning things better,” Harry said.
“No, it isn’t,” Ron was the one to answer this time, as he removed her from Harry, “He’s… he’s not the same,” he murmured, looking as though it pained him to say that.
Molly huffed but moved away, keeping an eye on them as they carried on their work. It was almost an hour later when the floo flared up as Hermione stepped through.
“Thank you,” he said, trying not to get teary at the sight of his friends being there. All of his dorm mates were there, as well as the Weasleys. Draco had also turned up, but he had been standing near the back of the group since he arrived, not wanting to be noticed, but Harry could see him. Hermione had also come, but that was because she was now staying at the Burrow until school began. Ginny was there, but she had been warned to remain away from Harry. The teen was glad she was receiving treatment for what she had been through and hoped that it would help her.
Sirius snorted at that, “yeah right,” he grinned, “last time you said you were going for a book we didn’t see you for almost five hours. And that was just one book. You also came back with seven more,” he added.
“Oh?” Harry murmured as Sirius sat down on Ron’s bed. His friend, going over next to him to sit down.
Sirius looked at Harry as they stood in the floo room, “Sorry, Harry, I know you wanted a little more time before you saw Ron,” he said softly, patting the young teenager on the back.
“Wh… what does that mean for Ginny?” he asked, worry lacing his voice as he thought of something being wrong with his baby girl.
“You forget Hermione that we once trusted you to help us and you sunk that trust,” Harry reminded her, voice going cold, “He’s helped me with my work, with learning runes and arithmancy. Has also been helping Ron, and before you even suggest that he has been sabotaging our learning,” he paused for a moment when Ron cut in.
"How?" Harry's eyes went wide, he had never told Ron about what the sorting hat had said. The only person that knew he could have been in the house of snakes was the hat and Dumbledore.
“Exactly, you have what he craves, and he’ll never really have that until he is older,” Sirius told him softly.
"Hermione," she answered, as the man vaguely gestured behind him in her direction.
"What are you on about, Ron?" Hermione frowned, leaning a little closer, "Nothing like that should matter at all."
“Good, can you bring them here please, all subjects,” he told him.
“I want to talk about something I just heard,” he said as he walked into the room.
"But... But... that's just not possible!" he was yelling at the end, eyes wide as he glanced towards the bed, not wanting to believe the words coming from the man before him, "You're a criminal, you made it up, that's, that is just a... a... conjuration of some kind! Some sort of dark magic!" he finished, seeming to calm down as he thought of a reason for everything going on, "And everyone has just been confounded," he nodded a smirk on his face as he finished his perfect reason.
“Look, Hermione, he has been good,” Ron said, thinking of the one time that he had studied with Draco and Harry.
XxXxX
"Might need a bit of help, mate," Ron grinned, though there was pain in his eyes.
"Now, let's go," Sirius said as he gestured to the floo, "I need to have a word with your mother about uninvited guests.
"You will have to learn how to deal with the press at one point Potter," Snape said as they made their way to their seats in the courtroom. They were both going to be called up as witnesses for both Pettigrew and Sirius.
Hope you are enjoying things. This is the last of the pre-edited chapters. But I shall be doing my all to keep on track with posting!
Harry shook his head, “no, I want to do a bit of work and then I will,” he promised.
"Why?" Harry asked, "Why did you betray them?" he repeated as he looked at the man.
I hope that you have had a good Monday so far!
"I... I would like that," he gave a soft smile as he moved a little closer to Ron, helping him over a rock.
“Explain?” he demanded, looking serious as he stepped closer to the young wizard.
Ron thought for a moment, “okay, tell me about him, tell me what he’s like and what he has done and everything,” he told him, sitting up and leaning against the wall. Legs crossed in front of him.
Sirius shook his head, “I don’t think he would have realised how deep this… that would have gone. Even if the object is destroyed and the thing stops possessing someone, the damage has been done. And it needs to be healed. Just like everything else. She would need to see a healer trained in healing dark arts damage,” he told him. Thankfully, the damage that would have been done would be the same as a few other dark artefacts. There were many objects that mimicked the possession made from a Horcrux.
“So,” Ron said as he ate the last bite, “you wanted to tell me something?” he asked him, letting Harry put away most of the plates, passing the few that he had.
"I'm fine, Headmaster," Hermione smiled.
“Yeah,” he said as he curled closer. Remus had left the two to do some lunch as Harry was going to have some there for a while before coming back. As the two older wizards were going to be sorting a few things out to move to the new place ready for when they had the main move in about a month.
"Yes," he nodded, eyes going wide as he realised exactly what Snape was going on about. "Sirius, I suggest you started getting out of here, the full moon is going to be rising soon," he advised. "I've had the potion, and while I know I should be safe, I'd rather not take any chances," he finished.
"Remus," he whispered, his voice shaking as he took in the worn man.
“Wow, he… he saved your life basically,” Ron whispered, eyes wide as Harry finished.
“I’ll take them, And I think I might drop creatures. Hagrid is great, but… I know I won't really use it after school,” Harry added, “I’m not too sure of what I want to do, but I know it won't be working with creatures.”
“Please, why?” Harry asked her, eyes begging for her to give him a reason, one that would explain and lessen the betrayal.
Moments later they landed with a wobble in the middle of a dark living room. Harry looked around, seeing a house-elf nearby grumbling and glaring at the three of them as they arrived, "Who?" Harry asked, gesturing slightly to the elf.
Ron nodded and left the room, heading down to the floo room. He walked in and waited. It didn't take that long for the connection to come up. Accepting the floo connection Draco was soon stepping through, “Hey,” Ron said she began to head out of the room again.
Harry and Ron shared a look and rushed to get their brooms again. Both of them wanted to fly a little longer. It wasn’t like they could do it in the middle of London without the Muggles finding them.  Sirius watched them go, quick to return as they took to the air. He watched as the two of them passed an old Quaffle between the two of them, though they mostly just raced around the Burrow.
“Yes, please,” he smiled warmly as Harry got up.
“He is a bit more mature than you were,” Remus admitted, “A little too much I think,” he gave a soft sigh.
Chapter Eight
“Ma… Malfoy?” he blinked, finally breaking free of the fog at last.
It didn’t take him long to reach Grimmauld Place, they would be moving soon, and for him, it wasn’t soon enough. He hated the place so much. Each time he had to walk in, all he could hear was his mother. And while she was still on the wall, he and Remus had been able to find an enchantment to soften her voice thanks to Kreacher.
Harry’s smile went wide, “really, you will? I think the two of you would really get along now that he doesn't have to think like his Dad anymore. He’s his own person, but that’s only because he can tell Lucius Malfoy to fuck off,” he snorted at the thought of Draco doing such a thing.
It didn't take long for said wizard to walk into the room. He gave a heavy sigh when he saw the redhead standing there, "I'm going to take you home now, Miss Weasley, Ron, Harry why don't you go off to Harry's room." He smiled at the two teens as he went towards the floo and activated it.
"Yeah," Harry whispered, eyes closed and letting the warmth of the hug fill him.
Chapter One
“I’m nothing like them!” she yelled back.
“Yeah, I think I want to go home,” he said.
“Hmm, your mother told me that,” Arthur said with a nod.
Harry's head shot around, looking wide-eyed at the wizard, "My... Mother?"
"Come on, let's get ready to leave," Hermione said as she stood up, already reaching for the trunk that had appeared above her after they had settled into the compartment. She had already put Crookshanks into his carrier. The cat wasn't happy but knew he wasn't going to get out anytime soon.
“I heard about that,” Draco laughed a little.
Hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well!
Chapter Fifteen
Thank you all for the amazing comments and kudos! Love you all so much.
“He’s helping a lot,” Harry added. He had the things Draco had taught him checked by Remus and Sirius occasionally, and so far the other teen hadn’t given him anything that would be false, only the truth and the right answers when Harry was getting things wrong.
“Come on,” Ron said with a frown, spotting his sister waiting for them, “We should get it over with. I’ll try and get us to my room,” he suggested, “we’ll eat in there.”
“Draco will help, he wanted to be Harry's friend his first year. But then he heard what Lucius wanted and decided to make him a rival,” she said, snorting a little.
“Hey, Harry,” Fred grinned at him.
“Mum,” the redhead sighed deeply, rolling his eyes and wondering what lies that his sister had told. Though it might not even be a lie.
Hello to you all!!!
“I’m just wondering why you were getting things wrong when I know you knew the answers,” Remus puzzled, he had noticed it on a number of essays that Harry had given in. And when marking the exams he had put down the answers that had been from the essay and not what he had talked about before.
“Okay,” Sirius agreed with an easy nod. He knew his godson was avoiding the two Weasley women, and he didn’t blame him.
“We need to think if he would have made any more,” Albus murmured, already thinking when they could be hidden if there were more out there. He looked at his cup and quickly waved his wand to fix it, pouring himself some more tea.
Thank you all for the amazing comments and kudos. I love and adore you all so much! Hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well.
Harry stopped what he was doing and left his room. He went down the stairs, jumping over the last three as he wandered towards the living room. “Yeah?” he asked, a little puzzled as to why he had been called.
“So, what is it you wanted to talk to me about?” he asked as he finished pouring the tea and handed it over.
“Yes, kind, Mistress Cissa, one that mistress loved,” he bowed a few times before he answered, “Master Regulus, the kind master let the nasty man, the unspeakable man, you know who, took Kreacher to the cave. When Kreacher came back, the kind master helped this miserable creature, and I took him there,” he said, as he began to tear up thinking of his late master, “he ordered me, he ordered me to take him there and leave him. I couldn’t do it, I couldn’t do it.” He wailed loudly.
Hey all
"No thank you," he answered, "What's going on?"
“He… he might not know about them,” Ron said softly, “And I’ll… I’ll try but just give me some time. I’m..”
"Bars on the window, a cat flap in the door. My meals sent through them were only soup and stale bread that I gave to Hedwig. You think I'm making this shit up?" Harry hissed at her, eyes narrowing in anger at the disregard Hermione had for what he had been through with the Dursleys. "They would have happily heard of my death and danced on my grave. They didn't want me at all. They thought they were being watched by wizards and that's why they did so. Vernon and Petunia hated me, locked me away and kept me hidden from those around them. Ashamed that I was a wizard, so no, he wasn't lying. Just people ignoring what children had to say, and once again we see that you think more about the adults than your own mind."
"But Pettigrew is dead, you killed him!" Hermione yelled.
“Yeah, I need to get a book from Flourish and Blotts,” he answered, looking up from his breakfast, “I shouldn’t be too long.”
The teens in the room turned to face them. “Mrs Weasley,” Harry began only to be cut off.
"Okay," he nodded.
“I… I think Sirius has something planned for it, he won't tell me,” Harry pouted.
Harry watched her a little, seeing the distrust in her eyes when she was looking at Sirius, "I'm fine, going to enjoy living with Sirius," he grinned widely as Remus, Hermione and Ron caught up with him.
It didn’t take long until the two teenagers were flying in the air around the Burrow, with Ron practising against the goals that the older Weasley children had added some years ago to play some pickup games. The two were having a lot of fun, though almost an hour later, they saw Ginny hanging around the garden, watching them as they flew around. Harry shuddered a little, he really didn’t want to land, though Kreacher had made them both a lunch to have when they did so.
“Erm, near Christmas,” he said trying to think back, “I… I have my essay from before she started to look at them,” he added. There was a pit of dread in his stomach at the thought of Hermione doing such a thing. “She really couldn’t be doing that… could she?” he asked, almost pleading with them to tell him they were joking and that there was nothing like that going on.
“Of course,” Sirius told him, “you know where the floo powder is,” he added.
"Potter," Malfoy said, causing the three to stop what they were doing and look up at him. Harry paused before saying anything. The tone of voice was different than normal. there was no derision or disgust within it. It was just toneless, almost.
“Harry!” came a yell from downstairs.
Hey all, sorry for being so late to post. But life and now Camp Nano are in the way.
"Why not?" Harry gave a little shrug as he started to eat once more.
“Right, I’m going to call Harry down, I was going to take him to see the new place. But I think I might leave that for tomorrow,” he sighed, turning to the skies and yelling, “Harry, we’ve got to go now!”
“He’s right, on the one I read, I would have given it an O,” Remus told him.
“He’s right, Mum,” Ron told her softly, “She could have put us in danger, you know the type of things that have been happening at the school,” he added.
Sirius put them down, after only reading two essays, it was obvious as to what Hermione was doing.
Thank you for the awesome comments and kudos! Love you all!

Chapter Five
“Yeah, I heard about his adventure in his second year, fighting a basilisk and living to tell about it,” he closed his eyes, shuddering at the thought of what Harry would have gone through.
Harry just nodded, "We should head to the castle," he advised, "I... I don't want to linger here," he finished, looking over at Ron.
Harry gave him a weak smile, "Thanks."
“You forget, Molly, that I was a fully trained Auror by the time I was twenty and worked damn hard in that line of work. Now I am responsible for the House of Black and Regent of the House of Potter. I take it all seriously, including to make sure that Harry knows-”
“Hey, Harry,” Ron grinned as he saw his friend looking off into space.
"That's... that's Sirius Black!" he yelled out, pointing in horror at the man that was standing next to Harry, "I'll get the Dementors, he needs to be kissed."
Sirius looked up and answered, “I don’t know until I read them,” he said as he split the pile and handed some over to Remus, “here, you can check a few as well.”
Hermione quickly ran from where she was behind the group and to the doors, calling out, "Yes, Professor." She opened the doors wide, letting the group into the room.
Thank you all for the awesome comments and kudos! Love and adore you all. Hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well.
“I’ll… we’ll keep an eye on him,” Draco said as he looked at Ron. Ron nodded.
"Right," Harry nodded, not truly understanding, but getting enough to at least hold any more questions.
“Okay,” Ron said and rushed from the room. He ran down the stairs to the floo room and took the floo to the Leaky Cauldron. “Hey Tom!” he yelled out, greeting the owner of the Leaky Cauldron as he darted down the alley and towards Gringotts. He knew that's where Sirius was, but couldn't remember where Remus was.
“It looks like it, Harry, I want to look at some of your work from your first year before you became friends with Hermione and then I might be able to see if she really did start right then,” Sirius asked him.
“Thanks, Ron for being so understanding,” he smiled, he could see the flare of temper in the blue eyes and changed the subject, “So is it like this with Ginevra all the time?” he asked, wondering about the words spoken.
“It’s fine Dad,” Ron shrugged, he had dealt with it all the time. “So… Hermione, she was changing our answers to wrong ones?” he said, embarrassed about his little spelling problem.
Sirius nodded, “Albus told me that might happen,” he sighed, “I was hoping it wouldn’t.”
“Right, I’ll look into things on my end as well,” Sirius said, getting up, setting down his empty cup, “thanks for the tea. I should be getting back. Narcissa and Draco are coming over.”
“I think you could, Ron, you may not think you’re smart, but I know you are if you let yourself be you,” Arthur reassured him, patting him on the shoulder before hugging him.
Chapter Fourteen
Sirius and Arthur turned as the back door opened, and Ron stepped out. “Hey,” Sirius greeted him.
“I know what it's like to not have anything Ron, you forget sometimes, that I lived with the Dursleys nearly all my life. I never had a Christmas present until your mother sent me that jumper. It was the first time I got something, something that had a little meaning to it other than being spiteful,” Harry told him, “I know what it's like to get nothing but hand me downs, I had Dudley’s all the time. Tucked in and sewn up so they would fit better, and that was only until I was able to sew for myself did something actually fit me a little, before then I was dressed in clothes five times too big. I know how to do things the muggle way, to make sure I look at least a little presentable. The clothes you found me in were Dudley’s that I have sewn to fit me a little better,” he added, feeling a little ashamed of how he had dressed back then. It was only before third year he had been able to actually get some clothes that fit him. Before then, he had been made to keep to certain places.
"Damn right," Harry muttered, darkly.
“I… I don't know why you would think…” Harry began but trailed off.
Sirius glanced around as well and then nodded, "all right," he smiled, straining up. "We're going home via portkey, as it's the quickest way, and I've tied this one into the wards so we'll get through as it's locked to us only," he said as he pulled out a small stone disc, a crest was on it. "You need to touch it and keep a finger on it at least to get to your destination. I'm going to hold on to you as well Harry, just to make sure," he smiled at his godson as the three of them reached out and touched the emblem. Sirius put an arm around Harry as he activated it.
“Sure,” he nodded, moving aside and letting the two come through.
“Yeah, each time, and you can see she was giving us high marks for them as well. She loved it when we put down that we were going to suffer or death was in our dreams,” he snorted at how morbid the divination teacher was.
Harry put an arm around him, “It’s fine, Ron, you just have to ignore her.”
Hello to you all, I do hope that you are all well!
“I don't think this is a good idea, Harry,” said Hermione, bristling at the thought of Draco Malfoy being anywhere near her.
“Yeah,” he nodded, flipping back onto his bed and glaring at the ceiling.
“So we have to wait,” Draco sighed, finally moving closer to Harry, knowing that he and the others were safe from the Horcrux.
“Right, so how are things going when it comes to Ginny?” he asked, “did you take her?”
Harry slumped in it and nodded. Ron was worried Harry was a lot paler than he had been when he had first arrived. “Yeah, okay,” he sighed, closing his eyes and slumping against the desk a little more.
"No! I forbid it," Fudge huffed, "we already know what happened."
Chapter Sixteen
“It’s like she’s taken almost half of your right answers and changed them to wrong ones,” Remus finished, “I’m sorry, Harry, but she’s sabotaging your work. When you asked her to look it over, how long into your first year did it happen?” he then asked, wondering if he could get an idea on how Harry’s first year went with his grades.
Ron looked at him, glaring as he walked out of the room before Harry could even say hello to him. Harry slumped, feeling a hand on his shoulder. He looked up and saw Sirius giving him a sad, soft look. The twins saw the exchange and since they didn’t know what was going on; they approached Harry.
“Actually. Draco is here,” he said, wincing a little, as the look on Ron's face dropped, “before you say anything,” he began, “I’ve been working on my runes and was finding it difficult about the sets that we have to remember. Draco came in, he… he showed me a really easy way to learn it. I was wondering if you want to come over and we can both get a little extra help, he’s done all this recently, so he might know a better way to learn,” he explained quickly, not wanting to take the chance of losing Ron before he heard him out.
“It was, mate,” Ron grinned as he flopped down on the couch beside him.
“Harry,” she gasped, grabbing his arm to stop him, “he is going to hurt you, he will. That's who he is.”
"That's fine with me," he nodded as he pointed his wand towards Pettigrew.
“You sabotaged our work. Every single essay we wrote would have gotten better marks had you not butchered them. And please, don’t tell me that you were getting the same answers as ours. Remus talked to me about how your answers had all the information that ours didn’t,” Harry answered her, explaining a little more.
“Harry,” Hermione said as she walked over, looking a little stuck up as she sent a glare towards Draco.
"How are you, Harry?" Dumbledore asked as he walked over to them.
"Thank you, I will, may I say goodbye to my Godson before I leave," he asked.
"No, it would be great, to live with you, to be with family, with you," he rambled, hope blossoming even more in his heart as he thought of living with Sirius instead of his relatives. They may have housed him and fed him, but it was always the bare minimum. They didn't really care for him, they had only done it for appearances only, wanting to seem like the right sort of people to those outside of the house.
Draco looked confused, “What do you mean?”
Ron grinned, “Yeah, though I named him for the Ch-”
“It’s only been after she got back. When you saved her from that basilisk, well... She is so horrible now. She goes to everyone in the family that she was the one that you saved her, that it meant that you liked her and things like that all the time,” he huffed, pulling a face.
Once again Snape and Harry were called up to testify to what they had seen and heard in the Shrieking Shack. Watching Sirius' trial come to an end, Harry heard as Madam Bones called for the vote. Harry spared glanced towards the Headmaster, who gave him a reassuring smile. The man had excused himself from most of the proceeding, as he didn't feel he could be impartial to all the evidence.
“I myself did Arithmancy,” Arthur added, a smile on his face, “I know we still have books from when Bill took those two courses as well,” he added, hoping to know that his brother took them that would persuade Ron to do the same. He had been disappointed when he had learned that Ron had chosen Divination and Molly hadn’t talked him out of it.
Hello to you all.
“I know, and she will never be able to replace Lily, never, and she can say whatever she wants but you and I both know it won't happen,” he rescued the young wizard.
“So, he saved you?” Ron asked him.
“Oh,” Ron said, moping on his bed.
“Yeah, that's right,” he told him, sitting down on the sofa opposite the aged wizard.
Ron’s smile dropped when he got a good look at Harry’s face. There was sadness in it, and Ron knew that it was because of him. He had caused that by acting like a spoilt brat. He knew he was being stupid, but it had hurt. At that moment, it was painful to feel like he was being left alone again. It happened with his brothers all the time. And Ginny being a girl did her own thing. Ron had older brothers, but none of them ever wanted to play with him. So, when he made a friend, he was jealous of anyone that got near him. Not wanting to be left behind. Sirius had told him that Harry wanted Ron with him, not left behind, but beside him.
“The magic used is really dangerous. What you came across in Grimmauld place is the same type of magic. You felt the same type of pull that Ginny would have done. That's only the beginning of that ‘type’ of dark magic. It’s… bad, very,” he told him, his voice sounded worried.
"Okay," Sirius grinned as they took the final path towards the castle. Harry was smiling the whole way, as Hermione followed behind them. Ron winced in pain occasionally as they went up the stone steps that led to the main door into Hogwarts. Snape leading the way with Pettigrew floating behind him.
“His social standing, Malfoy’s, Lucius Malfoy, that is, well, it would drop. It's because he married into the Black family that he went so high in the ladder,” Ron nodded, “With a divorce and a breaking of the betrothal which would have to have a good reason behind it, then yeah, it would put him down a lot. He wouldn’t have half the influence he has now,” he snorted, “that is a nice thought, couldn't happen to a nicer bloke either,” he grinned at Harry.
"Malfoy," Hermione growled, "Haven't you done enough, why don't you go back to the hole you crawled out of and bugger off," she snipped. Her anger bubbled up inside her as Ron and Harry ignored her. She was trying to tell them that Harry needed his family in his life. Like any child needed their family.
"Hmm," he hummed as he noticed the stunned looks from the three students in the room, "You took the pranks too far at times."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Good news?" Ron asked, a grin on his face.
“Thanks,” Sirius smiled to him, Harry didn’t smile back, just went back to the sofa and sat down. It didn’t take him long to see that he had been right, “Before you became friends, you were scoring high. I would say that you would have easily been second in Gryffindor, maybe in the top ten, or five in Hogwarts if you had continued.”
“Why would we? It was over and all it would have done was to make Ginny feel different and off with everything. It was best that we put an end to it,” she said, shaking her head.
Harry glanced up a little, trying not to let the wizard know that he and Ron knew he was coming. "Thanks for the warning," he murmured back as Hermione once more tried to talk to the two of them.
“What was it, Sirius?” he asked, “what hurt my baby girl?” he needed to know.
“Nice one, Harry!” Ron yelled out as he swung around with his own gnome and tried to make it go as far as his friend had managed.
“I’m okay, not I’m out of the room, I’m really fine, honestly.” He said with a smile on his face as he tried to reassure his godfather that he was okay.
"Of course, I don't mind talking about them at all," Remus smiled at him, as he thought back trying to figure out which story of the many he had that he should tell first. he opened his eyes, "Right," he began, "I'll tell you of the time that your mother, Lily was able to get your Father to dance in a clown suit in the Great Hall," he said as he started to tell the tale as the train continued to fill up.
“Right, I’ve looked through the essay that you’ve written first before Hermione looks through them,” Sirius said, “And out of the two of those I read that you wrote, well, they were really good, would have got you some high grades.”
"It's fine, don't you worry about that, there is nothing wrong with liking the same gender," he smiled gently and he held his godson tightly, reassuring him that everything was fine.
“Hmmm,” Harry hummed, “headache, feel a little odd,” he added.

Thank you for the awesome comments and kudos. I hope you've enjoyed this chapter as well!
"So you're okay with me living with Sirius?" he asked, he had been half afraid that something would happen and he would have to go back to his Aunt and Uncle.
“Right…” he mutters, “So can I call Ron?” he asked.
“It could be influencing her personality a bit or even a lot. It could also change some of her morals even. Twisting who she really is into the thing that possessed her,” he answered, trying to keep his voice gentle.
Going to attempt to try and update this twice a week, and maybe even three times a week. There is a LOT, it's over 160k in length. One of my longest fics.
“Ron?” Sirius asked, a little curious as to how the young wizard got to them.
I kept my promise, I UPDATED TODAY!!! Lol, I'm in a good mood today, wrote over 8,000 words so far today, so pretty damn pleased with myself. And I also need to get my butt moving on editing this one, only have up to chapter 16 edited.... whoops. Lol.
"I do, Madam Bones, it will take me a moment to retrieve it from my private potions lab. I have it securely locked there," he nodded as he left the room, robes swirling behind him dramatically as he headed to the office to use the floo.
“Yes, there is,” Arthur didn’t back down, “I’m taking her and you won't stop me, Molly. She needs to go, just in case there is something wrong we need to make sure that she really is over after all she has been through Molly,” he tried to reason with her.
“You said that you would die while choking on a snitch,” he snorted, “Didn’t you do that first year?” he asked.
Enjoy this chapter!!!
“Albus would never steer us wrong,” she added.
Harry ignored her and called out, "Sirius!"
"Harry!" came a joyful shout from the left of him.
Sirius took a small drink of his own before he added, “Yeah, that's what I remember of it as well, but what I know is that this had a hold of Harry, trying to make him open it. It contained a part of a soul. Voldemort’s,” he told him.
“What?” Harry asked, a little more forcefully, “What's going on?”
“Really,” Ron muttered, “she has no fucking idea what she has put us through,” he added, looking to the ground.
“I don't need a mother, I had one, one that gave her life. So you’ll have to forgive me, Mrs Weasley, if I refrain from calling you in such familiar terms,” he said, his voice shaking as Ron reached out to him and put a calming hand on his arm.
"Thank you," Sirius murmured as the six of them slowly went through the passage. Leaving Remus behind as the moon slowly rose.
Hey all!!!
“I get that,” Draco nodded, “I think you should just put it out of your mind for now and try and enjoy the day,” he suggested, sounding hopeful.
Ron gave him a small smile as he walked over and past them, looking up at the sky he yelled out, “Harry!”
"Thank you, Professor Lupin," Hermione said primly as she walked into the compartment as she took a seat by the window, opposite Remus. Harry took the one beside the werewolf and the last seat was taken by Ron, the two teen wizards muttering their thanks as well.
“That's no excuse, you could have done a lot of damage, hell you did. I thought the wrong things for almost all of my classes and that could have ruined my future and could have left me vulnerable in certain classes,” Harry told her, shaking his head, a frown on his face.
I hope you have all had an awesome weekend, and that your week goes well!!
Draco took them from him as soon as he sat down and started to read through them. Eyes wide, “you really submitted this?” he asked.
"Yeah, have you got dinner started?" Fred piped up as he and George walked over behind their mother. They had heard some of the exchange as well and weren't happy with what the woman was insinuating.
“Thank you for your help,” he nodded to him and then the three of them quickly left the office and headed to the floo to get back to Grimmauld. Sirius rushed past them all to the bedroom.
“Okay, Kreacher, I’ll do it for you. I’m going to have to take with the Goblins about it, they might be able to shed some light on how to destroy such things,” Sirius shuddered as he glanced to where Draco and Harry were still on the floor, “Draco, can you take Harry out of the room, I don't want him in here. Looks like he might be susceptible to the magic in this,” he muttered.
Hey all
Harry glanced from where he was watching Pomfrey take care of Ron and then up at the wizard. "Yeah," he murmured, though in truth he still didn't know what to feel about it all. He never really knew what had happened to his parents, as to how they had come under suspicion of Voldemort and how they had been found. He now knew the truth of that night, as far as he could tell.
