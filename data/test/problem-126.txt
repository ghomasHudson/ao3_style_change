(…another flashback memory in most precious moment, after Alex Malfoy was death for four years in the half, Draco is already reborn)
All the crowded look at each other as the opinion of the man seem very accepted and one of the group member in elves tripe decide to ask some question, ‘what about the boy answer? Will he be saying yes for this matter of his and this kingdom’s future?! and also will he safe as he will be train my us all and, his magic will detect by them?!’
Before draco to went school as first year in 3 days ahead. In his day of waiting, he sneak toward the family's library. That is to know about his forbidden wand, as in called 'fleux'.
Behind the close door another heated argument occur as the mother is still assist to had labor in her elder sister’s place, ‘-no matter what you said Lucius! I will be there for mine and my baby safety in my hand!’
'all right..dear malfoy..you in..Slytherin' the sorting hat shout the last pace word of 'slytherin'.
'ENOUGH! you fool! Better word again this time! I need the stone you fool. And made sure potter is there to take it...crusio! The faceless man dissapear within the second.
‘is me mione!’ said draco in big smile behind the closed door, knowing hermione tend to feel anxious with people this days.
'What is the meaning of this?!' shout the black hood figure, while staring the person in front of him.
For once, he end up lost his 'malfoy-ego- as he feel his emotion break down for seeing his mother alive again.
‘yeah yeah hermione~ let harry breathe, give me that harry and let me instead read it for you both’ draco huffed, while turning to the next page to read the sentence.
In her guts were right, the figure did follow her even in a slow walk, ‘who is this person’ Hermione whisper softly, not even bare to spare a glaze behind her. Fearing inching her mind as if telling her to run but in her heart must facing the enemy, even if its danger.
‘like a brat?’ minerva smiled, knowing severus had the feeling of human than cold scary face he uses to wear as a mask.
The crowd were viral fuses that seem unstop as the both team, griffidors and slytherin are in their position.
'sir?' the boy name harry called out, looking curious between the stern wary between the lady and the wand man infront of him.
The glow shine to blue to red and pure white like the reaction before in the wand shop. There. A black ink that look like curse forms shimmer.
And i feel greatful for those who choosing this, and Thank you for reading my dramantic story and for kudos this story.
Dobby. Dobby. As he shaking his head for elf reaction toward him is weird. Funny to know dobby is still here alive.
‘Calm down,’ a soft voice whisper in Hermione’s head, which startled her as she looked around her but no one was there. Who was it? Thought Hermione as she feels calm immediately after hearing that sound like from male voice and that voice reminds her of-
‘silent! Didddn’t I tttold you that yyyou must do ttthis mission wwwell…dddid you PETER! Crucio! ’ hissed the dark lord again as he feel satisfied with the punishment.
He look back to the person who still in stand mode, slowly he near the person 'pansy..thats enough, lets just go to potion class. My godfather is not really kind if we're late'
why he having the samme dream over and over about the man. That made him wonder if that is his lost brother..
‘fo-forgive ma-master, the information that there’s a decision about a warrior of fleux’ says the female servant.
'im fine ron. Just too full for this many food' looking at ron's worry face slowly gone and begin to feast the food infront of him.
‘alright then I agree with you, about you harry?’ hermione says as she try to smile for them to see that she is going to be okay.

'No! I can't!! she is my love that I wait for so long! can we just use some other girl than my maiden instead?, which is the same age as my maiden, please I beg you!!' the hood man begging on his knee to beg for mercy.
'well then..see you at hogwart, harry, byeee!' waving to harry before he run up where his mother still walk far ahead.
He only got 1 month only for the damn seer book. Feeling desperate as he look throughly over and over again from page 1 to 3.
‘hmm..you may go! And tania~ I heard your mother is very~ beautiful~’ the man had his looks of desire, as the female servant name tania feel her hand want to kill this man. But she knows she can’t.
'Alright, I will let you find someone else but, if you can't find it at all. we use your brown-haired maiden as our virgin to make this ritual to work. do you understand this, Leon? or should I say terry boot from the ravenclaw house!'
'listen up, first years student, today lets begin for the sort of house of ravenclaw, hufflepuff, griffidor and lastly, the slyterin. Each house is unique and lets begin with Hannah'  professor minerva begin her simple speech and ready to called out the student name.
'wouh what is that neville?' a busy girl name hermione ask neville that seem holding the ball that turn red.
‘ah well... he is... ermm well... your cousin!’ says hermione without looking at draco’s staring eyes.
Just open you damn eyes gurgh!-‘ the blond boy named, Draco Malfoy as he seem lost his strength. What is wrong with me, thought Draco as he seems in lost thought. And why do I feel so weak-
(…slowly flashback memory, after Alex Malfoy was death for 3 years in the half. Ms. Malfoy in six month old pregnant)
'ermm ywah i mean yeah sit. Sorry just lost in thought' the young malfoy nearly stumble his word in too excited and cover it by calmly said it at last.
‘Draco?’ harry said. He smiles in acknowledgment, ‘do think it will be appear the original page of the book?’
Draco gave silence answer instead, which made theo face lost his grin victory for not having the malfoy anger.
the red door..i keep dreaming this in my sleep which remind me of werewolf, dark figure and torture. Which today the combine was good for me to do…so the dark desire is nearly but not there yet to yet…
Severus and Minerva had the same thought as they both walk to their way to the class to proceed the teaching going, ‘just who is it that send letters to them? And why them that receive it?’
'stop it pansy, come lets go to bed. I feel sleepy already' draco stand up and still feel the heat all over.
‘what should I do? I can’t ergh seem to move? What- ‘as she speaks with only her mind that awake. A sound that had pause her to even speak nor breathing.
Professor rolanda walk in the middle and holding the ball, which already open the seeker's ball, 'ready! On your mark go!!'
‘HARRY!! JUST STOP! PLEASE calmed down please!’ hermione look at harry in fear as if harry was not harry potter. But was him. Him is The one who should not to be name.
Slowly, professor quirell wrap his bald head with the green scarp, which also to hide his lord as well and need to hurry back to the class for to teach the student, ‘find the boy’ he mumbles the words again and again, as he walk up the stairs.
He nearly forgot that his father is very malfoy-code this days in his childhood years till now. He thought as he still heard the man still going and going the talk.
‘what is it harry? What is it saying?’ hermione eyes had the looks of some kids that eager want to take the prize in front of them.
Hurrying he push toward 9 3/4 platform, the magic wall where the train for any wizard or witches went.
‘yeah he is and why you do look hatred about it?’ ask Severus while waiting for answer from the wolf man that suddenly had this mad aura, as this had making Severus melt and fear.
The male figure seems to tracked my gaze as it rose seeing my self from up to down whether I’m injured or not?
'damn it.. Wait this' a sentence that made him pause as he slowly read the passege words from the page do called half 2/3 'the time is odd and odd is for seer to feel the dream of past and future-'
'aha!' a voice starled both harry and draco, as their eyes in quesion for hermione standing in idea.
‘-about 900 votes only. This decision of the vote is closed. With that, the warrior of the young Malfoy is WIN!’
I did promise I will make long chapters… take long to finish this February and new update will be in this month also or next month in march, it may be longest or short (coming soon).
Theo rolling his eyes up as he walk closely and stand infront of pansy, 'well you tell me why you two don't accept the invitation?!'
'where did you heard that from, honestly, in the books said that we all will be sorted by the hat. You really had a wild imagine, ron!' said the smart muggle girl name hermione granger, shaking her head for the nonsense the boy talking about.
“you know~ your words I can’t trust at all and where were you when I need your help! I’m lucky enough that Draco the one that save and help me in that
'YOU GUYSSS YOU CAN BELIEVE WHAT I FOUND AND ERR-' Hermione pause her excited news as seeing draco look exhausted than he was before in the evening.
'i think he is..i think he is..' hermione repeat the word in proud as well for the boy who stern the statement of honest than hide.
'dear draco, i really want to invite you tomorrow morning, with my friends mione and ron at hagrid's hut and maybe a hangout for us.  blushed as he read the last word"us".
'yes harry it does, but its not only just a spell. It also require a person to give a blood so the ritual is complete to make the spell really works. But what i still wonder, is why ron had to do with that spell or why a person do this toward ron' draco explain in serious face and worry how it happen in the first place.
Please god I beg you… Padma begged in her mind and beg for mercy of miracle that maybe to twist this unchanged fate, as her heart beating so fast which seem to be clear for her, to heard near her ear.
‘DON’T YOU DARE! TOUCH MY BROTHER!’ screamed the male figure, named Lucas Malfoy. His third little brother, Draco don’t even know if he is existing, unless draco drinks the memory potion to remember him.
So…it seems this woman, I mean me as her is someone royalty or some pureblood he neither knew. He thought as he seeing his surrounding of the beautiful scene of the hallway that seem no ending through it.
Its time for the time travel boy to change the history that not yet been made from the history of his. That is the war. The savior. And the mystery upon. That seem change all the timeline.
‘hah.. let me tell you just this once just once. It is from my only friend, Lucius and he need my help. That’s all you know LUPIN!’ said Severus in serious tone as he look the wall behind the amused face named, Remus Lupin.
Head spinning as he feel his body complete with another. Like being hit by trunk or truck. He still had issues with muggle word.
'urmm..no draco, even if you im different sort of house, i still friend with you. Cause only you that see me as me. Not the boy who was a baby kill a man who-know-who' he smiled as he see harry look happy in his reply about him, the malfoy.
‘amen..’ seeing her only son praying beside her with his eyes closed and hoping it could work even if it is miracle, that would be bless.
She knows and she knows it well, but right now the mission is to find what bind her friend ron, 'oh ron please be alright' feeling exhausted making her lose focus.
‘I know, it is tough decision but, we must hurry decide now, people! that man is not patient person’ the mistress eyes stare all the crowded with eyes of expectation, which is the decision is what right for the young Malfoy, name Draco.
'ohgosh by who! And why you silly green hide behind draco, ron!' hermione face looks shock and red in the same time as she wonder in answer from ron.
and i want to thank you so much for the support in giving this story kudos and bookmark (tq n may god bless)
'Alright mione' both males says the same respond and slowly walk in the other room, not far from ron's room.
In the mere of night, there’s a female figure focus on the books as she keeps searching and searching to heal both Harry and Ron.
'f-forgive me m-my lord..i' professor stumble his tougur as his word been cut off. Fear cower over his face.
‘…don’t…mo..ve boy…you’re not in goo…d s..tate…’ said the familiar voice, which the book called ‘Mystery book’.
I wonder who is that man? Is he the shadow that always look over draco or someone that want to destroy draco?  Or is it the brother?
Gosh.. He feel hate school morning today. He wonder as he nearly half fall and half asleep toward the big bathroom.
'are you oke there mr malfoy?!, you look over the weather' mr oliver looking straight him very worry look as if never seeing his face very sick looking.
‘why now? I can’t seem to understand what you’re trying to say miss granger?’ said the mystery man in curious tone of hermione’s question.
'SIT DOWN!? YOU TELL ME TO SIT DOWN! TELL ME NOW OR I KILL YOU! AHHHHH' Harry eyes seem not normal with the way he looks toward madam poppy.
‘mistress, master Allen is already in dine room and I hope mistress enjoy the food,’ he said with simple smile on his face.
'better wait for mr weasley wakeup any minute now and if he not awake for today, the you can urgent told to mr weasley's fren' said madam poppy slowly walk out from the room.
As he recalled his memory, harry rejected his friendship and we both seem enemy in each day. How many timeline he had change. He look pale for the thought of it.
'guys, i think i know how to make ron back to normal!' hermione exclaimed her brillant idea, while harry look blank in respond.
The door slam hard for the full black cloth of professor wear introduce in unlikely tone 'welcome to my potion class, where you learn potion and if you fail this class may or maynot learn in good and it also may or maynot success for someone'
The vote is becoming more tense for the decision to end, ‘is everyone done with their vote?’ asked the mistress name Laila Merlyn, staring to all their eyes.
‘is that how ron related? As the sacrifice! This is NOT FAIR!!’ harry feel his madness going to increase as his scar getting more powerful without him knowing it.
‘right yes that’s correct well... I ermm get going now and Im from the house of Hufflepuff. Maybe see you on Saturday morning? Said cedric, hoping that his cousin, draco will be want to see him in that day.
Dear readers, here is the continue of the dark desire in part 2 of the chapter of 22, this is the one or three part of the scene:
'alright then, im in as well' hermione gave quick answer as she hurry went to her room to pack some magic spell.
Her silence was the only she gives to her master and with that, she disappears to finish her mission once again.
Very muggle way. Hope dad not faint for his unmalfoy way. He thought as he sees the other still unwake from their sleep.
'slow down mione!! Is only 4am in the morning and you did SAID last night at 7am to be there!! errrr..' harry feel his throat in thirsty moment, as seeing his friend mione already far ahead looking perfectly so use in running in this hot bright day.
‘of course, dear... I will tell your dad as soon he came from work. My my dearly~ this is very good big news, thank you dear... the idea to meet him was a good idea in muggle's world is it? London?’
‘you mean we must tell him all the truth and the history we’ve been truth?’ the mistress had the urge of mistrust but in the same time had the slight confuses, ‘please explain what you mean, lord gurrof’
Dobby is silence for not know how react when he, draco malfoy, who forgive than punish like other master. The only kind for him were miss malfoy who always said thank you. And now, the beautiful young malfoy said forgive me.
‘ALEX!! Wake up! please NO!’ feel his body corrupted in weird aura surround him as if wanted him to revenge but.
‘mother, its me cedric’ cedric feel his face shown the happiness he never expected will be came truth.
‘well... it was not the right time when he was very young. Too young even for me to be near him. Now he is little adult. Now, finally.. I can speak the trut- ‘Cedric reply back in sad tone, looking toward the floor than the girl infront of him. Feel shame was all he can think of.
Time for dinnner were full of hungry students to be bless with food. As one person of griffidors did not show up and harry notice the missing of her.
Remembering the memory was not his favorite way to do, but it making him strong to be alive. Even with the state of torture was the only he can bear. He remembers the pain of his first had little brother name, Alex Malfoy. A brave name as his name, but… until that day…
‘why now? I can’t seem to understand what you’re trying to say miss granger?’ said cedric in curious tone of hermione’s question.
“well… it’s about the book that I see you search with mia and i-“ pansy feel her nerve getting high up.
‘Marly! Where are you! Mar- ‘shout the male voice again, as Draco feeling nervous as if he knows this person. but he doesn’t what or why he feels guilty.
Both hermione and harry nod in agreement, as all the three of them went hurry to the room that they had reserved.
'come on harry, hurry!! the time is ticking!' the girl run while shouting her friend follow behind her.
‘please don’t me you not lying cedric? Y-you found draco? The draco we’ve wait for years and years to just see him?’ cedric’s mother feel her heart in relieved as in the burden had lift out of her shoulder.
‘I well... can we meet again? In private of course. Its err...’ cedric said in firm way, while draco had his right brow up.
Theo life was already turn upside down, when his mother hung herself and left theo alone with the father, who not care what theo want or do.
With no more to hear in that close door, Lucas stare and stare as he silently burst to tears while he mumble simple clueless word, ‘stop..p-ple-please..’
The night was never ending of integration for both of the man. One seem stern for answer while one denied to tell than speak for the truth ,that the lord is indeed alive.
All the crowded people bowed in respect toward their mistress. One of the crowded, which is the soldier who prepared to speak out loud, ‘’THE VOTE IS CLOSED!’ he repeat it again, ‘THE VOTE IS CLOSED!’
Great grandfather? He repeat again in wonder. Still stay to where he stand and look wary again for the book.
Instead of replying, he went over to open the door to see who is this person knocking without answering back, ‘You! What are You doing here?!’ he sneered at the person in front of him, named Remus Lupin who looking slump without a smirk on his face that he always uses.
'very good. Now said wingardium leviosa' the professor said again, as the students follow the instruction.
The sorting hat, slowly begin in soft tone, '..yes boy..the truth were not known..not even your parents..your grandmother had use spell to make all of you..forget about lucas..your brother were half fleux and had..to target since he was boy..now its you..but you were not target or hunt..you were...perfect pure fleux blood combine with black and half malfoy..you the young malfoy..born in as light in dark family...'
In the middle of the night was heavy test for harry and draco, as the memory of evening was not spoken again even it occur, as well forgotten for madam poppy.
'come down here you young man!' madam rolanda shout in worry as neville's broom seem rush toward high and boom.
'come along students, right this way' she scured as hurry, and us the students walk behind her in silence and excited eyes to look forward to be sorted.
Instead of screaming like other student. They heard non from the blond boy, slowly they open their eyes and see that the blond boy using a tease voice cooing the spider like its cute animal, that still stay on his lap the same position they throw.
His mind flashed for the warm kiss feel on his forehead and the wand appear next him. All he know that he did put in the bag, and not beside him.
'ah..im oke mr oliver. Just little nervous for first wand to get' he stated little lie, hoping mr oliver accepted through his lie. Very malfoy like. His father would be proud.
The sound of the knocking alarming him, as he feel anxious while holding his forbidden wand, 'who is it?'
'well hello there~' one of the twin male seemly playful said and the other one seem stare toward him like harry did just now.
‘ALEX! LUCAS!? WHERE ARE YOU’ shout a familiar female voice make him burst in tears, while hugging his dead brother.
‘What just happen?!’ asked lucas in thought looking for clue for whats happening so fast toward their happy day.
I welcome you my weirdest, confusing of the story i imagine to be.. And don't forget to give kudos hehe and thank you❤
The morning after was not even pleasant for her, even this night, while the man keeps putting a spell and devour her again and again without any care of her scream. All she can do is lay there. Just lay there like a broken doll.
hermione feel satisfied with draco answer, 'thats right..i think its section 65 and its called urmm its called-'
‘SILENCE PEOPLE! now lets begin our meeting by saying agree to this of not’ once again the meeting is restarting to discuss whether it is right or not for boy, draco.
The time were not change to daylight as it still form as night time. The students and teacher including the headmaster were soundly sleep, but only him, draco were wide awake.
While here is the figure’s part with his follower (however, it was not Severus that been torture) guess  who?!
‘no no draco... I- I just wish they just not had this disaster that keep following them?’ says hermione, as she feels her head getting lower and lower.
The wand flash beautiful strong glow in the hold of harry. The boy look extremely happy for his wand.
‘ah…good, you’re up,’ the male figure upon behind him said, while Draco stare the person in confuse.
As harry get touch with ron hand, 'nooooooooo! It hurt! Get AWAY from me!' ron screaming which made them look fear of the sudden outburst from ron..
The mistress question again her curious toward tanaka who gave the warm smile back, ‘even if he is Malfoy? You know Malfoy had the bad history before his brother was fool by a women name clara, the daughter of cladorv!’
'first year~ first year came here to ride the boat, hurry now~first year first year' a man name hagrid holding a lamp shouting the students to be ready to ride in the small boat for the all first year students.
'ohgosh did I just said pretty please!!! kill me now' draco screaming in his head, while looking toward harry in innocent face.
In the night where the library was supposed to be unallowed any visitors to be there, but there was a dim light for the young girl.
‘oh... my dear baby brother. I don’t think I can understand that’ he smiled, while seeing his 5-month baby brother, name Draco Malfoy laying nicely calm within his arm.
“alright and later I will read the letter and the time is in the letter?” Draco smile as his feel his mood getting better.
The fall of the night shine bright from the moonlight, as the announces were done with the vote that needed to be calculated.
The students looks were clueless for what the girl says, except for the professor and the malfoy, draco.
'i...thought you were evil draco. I had a fight with him..i sorry draco for accusing you..' ron bow his head as draco face looks more confuse.
While, in another place but in the present time where the argument just started to begin heated between these two professors that hired for work in this magical massive castle called ‘Hogwarts’.
What if draco had two brothers, one dead been killed when draco is not yet born yet. And one is this mystery brother, draco had met but lost. Who might it be?
‘it just another minute, dra and by the way, where is mione?’ harry question as he stares to the book section in their reserve room.
'ugh..no!' the voice seem loud as he approach a person  10 feet away laying on side way from one of the wall.
Why the wand choose him? Why the mystery of forbidden book want to guide him? Who is he? Is he the draco as only malfoy or more?
'…the deed was odd, the deem to bound, the down of fall- 'the female figure name pansy whisper the weird mantra that sound like a poem word.
‘boobaboo..nana dada..’ bumbling the baby boy, named Draco Malfoy looking adorable had make the elder brother, Lucas melt in peace.
'well?' clueless harry want an answer, as seeing his friends still in argue state than answering his answer.
Brim of light shimmer toward the busy brown-haired girl, named ‘Hermione Granger’ as her will to keep trying with different kinds of spell to open a very seal book in her hand.
‘-as you can see… one of the auror had tell me that we need to teach the student about the dark art which is important for- ‘
The sound of draco's cry seem woke harry from his anger, 'Dra? oh gosh draco i'm sorry I-I really sorry' slowly harry carry draco toward the blue long and big sofa that are not far from ron's bed.
‘no! pansy!! I’m super tired and I need a sleep! So, goodnight!’ Draco avoid fast as his head back to the safety place, which is his lovely fluffy pillow.
Soon you will be begged for my mercy, Laila! The man with a masked feel his heart ache in revenge of the women who had rejected his lust of love for her.
‘stop! I think draco need to heard all of this from you and not me, cedric. I’m just a third party. Even if draco is considered as my family. But. Me as his best friend must be respect his feeling no matter what situation. I’m sorry for my curious question. Sorry cedric’ replied hermione with small warm smile she gave toward the boy, cedric diggory, who were waiting for the arrival of his cousin, draco.
The professor stop and his eyes lock to his godson, draco, which receive a smile reaction back toward him. As he walk to side and stop again to stay eye contact with the boy, name harry POTTER.
'what? Want me to slap you again' the person still in anger manner as theo walk away with the minion follow behind him.
‘Marly! Where were you! You know that you need medicine potion for your eyes to see-‘ the person keeps rumbling, as he slowly open his eyes.
Just what the heck is going. He wonders with many questions in his thought and wait for the book to says something but instead, he heard was a sound of silent from the mystery book.
Then suddenly, a person near the figure “mia?” the person called in gentle tone. As if the person knows about Hermione.
‘I hope it will, my dear son~’ smiling toward her only son, who had the looks of the leader like his father, who travel far away for a meeting with the lord of the north.
‘look! I’m here to give you a simple explanation I- said Pansy, but cut off by Hermione as she glares hard with disbelief in her eyes.
In the other side with the different atmosphere, which had different desire than lust, that is the outcome of search, where the three students are planning to find out the truth for their friend, ron wesley, that had not awoken from his dead sleep.
Never know why he run fast away from auror. He the malfoy is not afraid, but to someone he hated the most. The dark one. He hates it always. He hate how he see with his own eyes his mother, narissa, laying there unmoving.
‘Well…not really,’ another female voice said, name Pansy Parkinson. And her head hung down, as if in shame. As if she were capable of such sudden change in human emotion, ‘But for the record, you follow me first!’
An odd book made him decide to borrow for only 1 month request. Glad it really need for him to findout about the specific of the dream he having.
‘you mean that Lucius? The Malfoy boy?’ Remus said in hatred voice, making Severus stare in curious.
‘hmm hmm.. try to find me is it? Little girl? Wheres your master, leon?’ demand from the unknown male voice that only her ears to heard, but can’t even see the unknown man in naked eyes.
“I don’t need your help pansy! I don’t need. Here I am thought you were nice like draco but end, you’re a Slytherin devil!”
'hmm very interesting, Ravenclaw!' the sorting hat  shout for the people to clapping their hand in congrats.
'..boy..not time to see me beauty..its time for you to wakeup..and bath..before..the humans of yours..wake..' the book state sternly.
‘…up…boy!’ said the familiar voice. ‘hmmm’ the blond boy reply, as he slowly open but seem to bright from him to see.
Slowly draco gave warm smile that always making harry feel warm inside, 'well..can you please bring me some food and drink? I really starving, pretty please?'
‘I-I I my love I-I I guess but i-‘ words keeps stumbling from Lucius as he trying to avoid his wife’s stare eyes.
'he may..but he the one the last fleux. His blood is half malfoy, half black family and half fleux..' the other male remain stay his believe.
Each of them thinking the same thing and worry for that person who decide not to awake ‘ron..please wakeup’
While, the room itself had the enchanted spell to prevent any spell to work, especially when it done by the man himself, terry boot.
'how desire~ is she! That stupid brat!! she was mine and only mine forever, mr weasley no more. She IS MINE!! Ahahhahahahh MiNE and not yours!!'
'i wonder~' mr oliver look in the right store ahead and take the wand to harry. Again. It freak harry and him. Yes him. The draco fear for the shop going down and swallow him. So illusion. Very unlike malfoy.
The mere morning with the little light of the sun and the sound of wind blow in the ease, which is the meeting is process once again in the forbidden forest. The argument between the lords were nevertheless begin to disagree, rather than agree of its opinion.
Dear readers.. I had made triple chapters coming soon.. And right now enjoy my dramatic story of draco.
‘what do you mean that it is not the copy that you get from this book?’ draco question as harry silence read after draco had done reading the book.
What he sees was, Hermione mouth was shut close with some strange red towel and her hand tied behind the tree that had a human face on it.
But. I wonder what happen to them? Draco wonder as he see his godfather is trying to ease away the fire and professor quirell were grumble on the sitten banch.
Today i had to change chapter 5..something about it i feel unsatisfied and i really want to change it but it make takes to long to stake the tale to be dramantic..
Severus trying to move up to take the soothing oil he had in the drawer but was stopped by the wolf, ‘Don’t move… just lay down with me,’ he said. Feeling Remus pulling him close. Severus feel fit into the cradle of the wolf's hips, as his back flush against the wolf’s chest, as his knees bending over his. Seeing the wolf had done with the space using ‘engorgement charm’ to give them more space to lay down.
'theres the draco i know. By the way, why harry look at you like so long?' pansy smirk become wide as the young malfoy face getting red all the sudden.
'oh shush you draco!, he need to know this as well' hermione glare at draco and while, draco just look away from her dangerous glare toward him.
‘thank you harry’ draco slowly feel his throat fresh as he decides to continue again, ‘ehemm where was i?’
‘interesting fact you gave me there... now brace yourself for this night for me’ the man begins to push more hard and fast toward the girl’s core, as the girl scream in pain. Once again, the night was not pleasant for her but for him.
‘lets just hope it work, guys!’ draco said with crossed arms while giving a warm smile to both hermione and harry.
Draco eyes look wary as he see a man that seemly become one as shadow form then again the figure dissappear as soon the students near the large window. Which is where the shadow man hide.
The rumour were like a disease spread everywhere. As 'harry' become new topic for being a first-year student to be suited as seeker.
Suddenly the night of the dinner were all over the place, when professor quirell shout the word loud and clear 'troll-tr troll in the dungeon' then the man faint like sleeping beauty moment.
'wingardium leviosa!' hermione said it loud and clear. In the same time, hermione's feather and along with draco's feather fly up in air.
...And the view was perfect for draco and harry had silence comfortable hangout together alone. Without ron or pansy beside them, following...
hurriedly Draco cover his mouth with his hand as he sees the figure pause after hearing the sudden sound from him, slowly looking around but end continue the ritual again as Draco feel relived for second.
‘for-forgive me m-my lord i-I will find a-a a way t-to stop it’ said the man who stutter is professor Quirrell.
‘oh lord I pray for you to give us a bless for the young malfoy and please bless him..dear lord of the god.. amen..’
'you know pansy. You really scared me there.' draco slowly reply as his mind still not use pansy slapping mode.
‘ah..y-your welco-welcome as well cousin’ cedric feel his face is red as he also gave his cousin, draco a big smile.
‘there you are!’ Draco froze unmoving as the voice he heard is behind him. With deep breath, his heart beating so fast as the person step getting near and near and even-
‘dra..co i..miss yo..u’ whisper a voice in the quiet cave, as his both hand is tight and attach on the the big-metal spell between the big stone.
‘That werewolf man?’ said Professor Severus in his usual face, as he looks at the headmaster, Dumbledore.
With that, pansy bow her head down in guilty. As Draco walk away in tense while in hurry to find hermione before went ahead toward Harry’s resting room.
As both suddenly stop the heated argument. There. An owl with appearance of beautiful brown that had fierce yellow eyes, as it flying straight toward Severus, with no thought to alert he open the envelope that had full amount of letters. What is going on. Thought Severus in his mind in worry, while Remus’s eyes in wonder what the letter contain of.
'well well look here, the neville boy left his precious ball' theo teasing tone seem deja vu for the young malfoy.
'no madam. All i know he was laying there alone and no one was around at the hallway. Im worry madam that the trio don't know about ron's situation?' draco explain in honest as he feel worry toward the weasley boy.
Draco land in hurry as he nearly trips down, “Hermione! What is going on here? And why are you tied up or- “Draco bubbling as he tried to cut the rope that tied her hand and take out the weird towel in her mouth.
'is he going to be okay?' Draco decided to ask madam poppy who were done checking Ron in physical and mentality.
Ahhh. What night. Draco thought as he still can't help to notice for harry's eyes look at him while he was eating.
‘well... we want to meet him. It’s been so long of years to just meet him. Please! I beg you! to let me and my family to see him, even if it just once!’
The book stated more the information '..yes..young boy..dark magic is not..good for fleux blood..a curse in century for it..but you..beautiful boy is combine..of dark..and light.. I know the wand and the wand choose you.. Don't fear for the wand..but calmly except..its curse..that only..you..the last fleux..to use..'
There. He see a large bruise that seem a huge hand burn attacted to him as his long hand seem weird to had that kind of bruise.
'shut up pansy. The stupid malfoy is just a weak body!' the boy, theo laugh harder as he hold his tummy infront.
Padma who was sprawled on the bed and trying stand up was too soon for her, as her back is really hard to move. She slowly pushes herself toward the door.
At first the library seems odd than cozy to see in the middle of night of 10.50pm, hermione look around and feel shiver on her spine when she thought about the book name ‘dark desire’.
As looking back that memory make Lucas bursting in tears and ready to had hope to come back. Back to his family arm but how? For how long he is going to be torture? He thought as he slump back on his back while his head still in pain for several injured that had dry up.
‘we beg mercy and forgiveness mistress~’ all bowed in respect, as the mistress is still feel not ease of the argument once again happen.
As the older Malfoy reach his younger brother all he sees was a man with black hood run away as if never was there with the crime burn with no murder. But only him and his younger brother in that field.
Yes. Fleux blood. For me, its a forbidden mix blood from several years of century in age of eleven and the newest occur happen in age of 7.
Lucas know that his parent had heated argument, the wall was never this thin unless with silencing charm ‘silencio’. Slowly he heard behind the close door, which is not far from his room.
Ouh hermione... you will be always as my family. I wonder what kind of secret their talking about. Well better show my face now.
‘Look! I’m sorry for what happened them is not me but someone else that I know and it's Draco cause he doesn’t know. That person…well I wish I can tell you. But I did try to do reseal to open the curse on Harry but it doesn’t work, as he won’t wake up...unless...well unless...
Just why did you come here, Remus Lupin. Severus thought as he and minerva walk to their room to sleep.
hello there again readers... hope you all like the update I had put on the chapter 26. Well…so hold the hope and you going to like this one.
'oh harry' he calmly spoke harry name, made him feel the butterfly effect inside his tummy and his heart beep so fast. For remembering the forest green eyes looking so glim and love toward him, the malfoy, from the boy, harry.
The library quiet down which is seem not use unless for last minute revision or research for test of O.W.L. test.
But... just where he is? Thought peter in despair as he need potion for his body to keep going before finding this person that the dark lord wants. And why must this person.
Draco's smart answer is shocking for all people in the class. Professor keeps questionning harry as if the version harry is the same as the father.
“you promise me! That you will help me for this afternoon. Please~” said pansy with her pleading eyes for draco feel nearly gave up.
The girl grumbling her speech fast as she begin '..the dangeroustermsforusto..do the potionisnotaccident..to..ermm happen as we studentsmustslowlystirthepotion..whichermm..follow..theinstructuon..and and err..the worse part istomade the potion..err explode.'
'i know draco and i really wish you and him together and maybe you can stay like this and not being like your father. errr...Sorry draco' pansy realised her last word was over the line, but draco is smilling at her in ensure.
'ah..yes dobby?, what is it?' he reply back kindly to dobby who look surprise of his kind behaviour.
‘ah ah ah~ big human~ scream for us or your brother will be no harm at all~ said the women name Ursula Dirge, trying to persuade the human to lose in his own fear in thought of his little one.
‘forgive me, mistress... may I gave my decision of this mistress... once again I beg your mercy...’ a man with two short-horn on his head, as his red-eyes stare toward the mistress’s green eyes.
‘I wonder if I find information about me? I mean me as this woman, I think?’ Slowly Draco reach the doorknob to see that the room is attached to long hallway through.
'shut up! You dirty bastard. And hope you go nasty with troll' pansy frusterate for theo's behaviour.
For that, I really don't know how long it will end and hope you will stay with me in this journey story.
'draco? Wake up dear, its time for your first year school at hogwart!' a women figure which is the draco' mother seem to see her son still stubborn to wake up.
‘ah! My lo-lord’ the person name Peter Pettigrew who was suppose to-be-called dead in report and his own friend, the grim 'Sirius Black' had taken the blame for what he had done, gasped in fear of the dark appease of the dark lord given to him.
'ahh' neville scream in pain, 'looks like it broken bone here, better need you hurry in hospital now. And Students! the class is still on and stay here after i sent mr neville' madam rolanda carry neville in speed ahead to the hospital wing.
As the girl who float in the air as the ritual were started to had the marks of the bind spell. The marks were all over the girl’s body.
‘ah well... he ermm he ermm’ hermione feel her words is little bit jumpier, draco know she is not good in lying something as well.
'sorry dray..it just theo you know. I love him but you know' pansy whimper in tears as her head bow down.
‘Yeah, right!’ returned Hermione in reply. ‘How I’m supposed to believe you after what you had done to me in the Forbidden forest or maybe what had happened toward my best friends was because of you! Is it?! ANSWER ME! Pansy!’
The merely bright morning the two male eager to hangout together, one looks excited and another looks nervous for needed to confess.
‘SILENCE!!’ a woman with the wavy blue haired shouted as her glare made the people even more quiet down.
‘crucio! Yyyou uuseless human bbbeing find him! or you’ll be punish!’ he demand toward peter as that man was struggling to stand up with the body full of scar.
In his past memory, he never into viewing the view or look the video. He was a brat that into naughty stuff toward neville with others slytherin. He wonder if he still slytherin.
'hah' he signed, while walking toward the small lake,  where not people usually visit. Feeling like want to sit down.
‘aza..aza.. please guide me as the girl is your bride..your only bride and maybe always.. aza..aza fourth of the third..cough cough..i-im sorry p-padma’ the man with hood keep coughing of blood from his mouth as he feel his conscious getting more weak and weak.
On the same evening in the other side of the building, there a bushy girl seem search through every section and reading every page without any miss at all.
'-the ball were taken by the chaser of griffidors and goes to the big ring and goal!! The first of 10 goes to griffidors!!' as the finish speak of speaker made the crowd viral from the griffidors house.
hello dear readers, here is the updated chapter. Sorry for the late updated as my mind trying to find out of the right scene to use for each of the chapter that I updated coming soon.
‘-why are you here!? Trying to hurt me again- ‘said the man with his clothes full of blackness might attract any man and women without the man noticing of the attention at all.
'do you know what happen, mr malfoy?' madam poppy ask without looking at him, as she continue to dap the potion on ron's left arm.
As both hermione and ron is occupied with the talk, harry eyes look for the blond boy, who strike his heart beat as he eyes still searching.
How wish if he can be the seeker. But, he know things would be weird for him to join. He sadly thinking as he still heard one of the girls talking about harry as seeker.
In his past year, never ever know about chosen wand. Usuallly get from his mother wand or his father one.
‘hmm..i don’t know harry, i feel like someone keeps saying my name’ draco take a tissue to rub his noses and thinking for who may talk about him.
On the other side of the room, merely screaming voice in a close room full with soundproof that can barely heard a thing at outside door.
He wonder where father is. Father always busy. He said to mind. When mr oliver show the wand first for harry.
Looking the path infront of him is still so unreal. Like it made him feel that he still in wildest dream. But he do still felt it. As he step down from the train.
'don't worry draco, your boyfriend is going to be fine' a voice beside him really know how to tease him alot.
The merely early gaze of morning bright as the class was off day for the student in Slytherin house and Gryffindor house, which a wonder for the two student running out in the hallway with no one around.
‘hmm~ find a way for this boy~ to scream in pain than silent~ its ver~ry not delighted to see~ Clarus~’ said Ursula with her eyes fixed toward the boy named Lucas Malfoy.
'mr oliver?, is my son's wand ready?' his mother glaring her eyes to mr oliver who seem stand the same spot repeating, making her want to hex him to deadly curse.
‘err alright sister... whatever that word is’ said clarus in confuses with his sister choice of word.
'..well..yes young..draco..its a history about..fleux..that been century to your..family black and..malfoy and also fleux bound to it..' the book stop as for the young draco to regain the information.
Riding the train is the best for him. As the window view never fall him as he still awed in the beauty view he love seen. The sky looks beautiful blue and the green forest that shimmer its beauty for people to look in calm moment.
'well im one of them. And no im not like my fathers. Yes i am malfoy and no i don't like dark magic. It scary and yes, im animal lover' as if he know the twins on questionning him in their mind.
The morning was the unpleasant for that figure, as the figure keeps screaming of hatred like a maniac person, ‘I KILL YOU I KILL YOU I KILL YOU I KILL YO- AHHHHHHHHH please stop stop stop I KiLL YOUUU!!’
'ouh weasley.. I know that you hate malfoy generation and no, im nor mad. Im very worry that why you fight with theo and not bring a wand along?
‘yes, my dear... the warrior wins by that we must protect our dear warrior~’ says the mistress in smile as the people who disagree seem to happy as well. All awed in smile and by that the boy is destiny for his path to be bless by the lord himself, the god of the world.
hello hello~ dear readers... ehhe as you can see this updated will be full of warning and some weird language I end up make things up.
Well that is unexpected. Padma thought as her body is full of pain from unwanted ritual and that man is now dead? the man that rape her again and again, while calling her..her...
Draco nodded in agreement as harry decided to ask some more, ‘so.. this book of dark desire can be seen the same as the one like the copy that you had, mione?’
'ugh' a sound appear from the bedroom startled him. making him decide to bath in hurry as he ich in pain rubbing the soap over his bruise hand and sore body.
In the sight of morning was a better warm for all the students especially for the two boy eager to see each other.
October is letter time as the letter been carry by their owl or other creature. Some had lots some big and some curious package.
There. The man that I see yesterday before she I mean me faint, ‘err hello?’ as he slowly went to man name, Allen that seem prepare to pull the chair ready for him. I mean her.
'errmm' a voice groan from the person who stir from his sleep and went to his back, and rubbing his eyes for why he waking up in this middle of night.
Ah… so the cure is a kiss but who is Harry’s true love? Draco in deep thinking as he waits for the ritual to end as she uses the red towel to cover Harry’s face.
The paragraph seem odd enough for him to understand as he curiously read again the passage, '-that hold a curse upon history of family called fleux. Then may it proclaim to stop evil or good. Either is the side of people they choose but the curse. The curse was only for fleux to cure-'
There. He smile in wonder, as he see draco reading book with a fierce female name pansy sitting beside him.
But 'Griffidors!' the sorting hat shout, made ron in defeat mode as harry smiling looking his friend ron for weird attitude.
‘mother? Father? Are you in here?’ said the blond with look similar like his grandfather and that boy name is Lucas Malfoy, feeling standing here was seem so wrong but seem so right. As he stare both his parents as both had tears cover in their faces.
Hello dear readers~ sorry for the late update and the long wait as I had writer blocked in my head, ouch!
'the sorting hat? The hat? But why that hat?' curiously he, the young malfoy is not satified with puzzle of the book given to him.
'uhh master..forgive this stupid elf..dobby been told that you need something?' dobby shuttered in fear as if waiting to be punish by him, the young draco.
‘forgive this person mistress..my opinion for this boy that he need to train by us in secret from the naked-eye of who-know-who and also away from the eyes of the man name cladorv. For that, forgive me dear mistress’ a very soft but deep for a man name tanaka while bowing in respect as he finishes his opinions.
‘ah... sorry cedric... what I mean is why in this age you meet your cousin draco?’ hermione stare hard as she waits for the boy in front of her, to reply.
As they busy hurry went to the room, theres two shadows lurking behind one of the book section looking at them in high alert, ‘the last fleux is doing fine, mistress’ a deep voice of a male gender reply to the person beside him.
'please-' he beg in mercy as he eyes still stare on toward the door. Fearing they will ask or report to his so called father.
What is this feeling? The weight seem heavy for just a thin wand. He thought curious to the wand on his hand.
The Mystery book is back to be rescue, aka the forbidden of all.... wohuuu not the dark desire tho...
Madam poppy slowly putting down the last potion that put on ron's body, 'hmm.. it seem your friend here, is still bind with something that attach. if not, be bind the potion will be not work properly for him to be heal. However, is this situation his body can't last too long, even if with the help of the strong potion also will not help him at all'
I’m back and hello my dear readers (forgive me for the delay)… today is the short update cause I’m planning to update longer in another chapter…
‘…up!..’ the voice seem getting louder, as he feel annoyed for a moment. Once again, he tried to open but failed ahead.
‘for start, that boy I had heard he is the kindness to all people. He had the calmness we had been looking for and he also the boy who knows the trick to avoid his enemy. The reason of this, he is not the person we use to know as Malfoy’s blood. You know how Malfoy likes. I believed he is what we need to survive this. With his trust and loyal to us and we also loyal and trust him. Which is we must tell the truth. Or He will know the lie if we told lies. For that it’s all I had explain what I mean, my mistress...’
‘SILENCE!! YOU USELESS BOY! If that boy had found out how to break the curse, we all will be useless you must know that!! YOU USELESS BOY SERVANT!’
‘i..will..pro..tect..dra..co..’ tears drop on the ground as he breath more heavy, because of the torture he endure on his body.
Theo was our bestfriend. But after the fight between theo and pansy. The friend bound take him to choose side.
But Draco meet a man who is the first malfoy but as his great great grandpa the lord Malfoy Wezchelfirce (I choose this name because I had this bizzare dream about is so yep...) (will use this name in diff chapter)
‘erghhh! Damn you-‘ a female voice groan in pain behind one of the section and the floor beside her is full of 'messy books' cover all over the path.
Feeling the memory is slowly fade as he feel the urge to be strong so he can go back to his family, to his new little brother draco, ‘I..mi..ss yo..u my..li..tt..le d..rag..on’ as he mumble, feel his lips dry and blood tint of the tasted on his tongue.
'oke..' he said slowly to his mothher, without looking her eyes. Fearing he may cry if he look straight to his loving mother.
Then suddenly the door bang, the man run while shouting the word 'troll tro-troll in the dungeon' then the man faint like a sleeping beauty moment. That man is professor quirell.
‘ahhh yeah he will be here soon... he says he go to bring foods and also take some books in his dorm. Why you’re ask, Cedric?’ replied hermione in now serious face.
She searches and search as she never feels a time to stop. Wondering how to cast out this thing maybe a curse, which made her react so weirdly and anger she never expect to feel.
'ohmy! Don't tell me you want to see that section!' draco's face had the look what hermione want to find.
'-curse of him may open may close, the spirit kill his vibe of braveness, will it may upon of my trust as Slytherin, put this curse with my soul, let it burn to his told and let it be dry for his lover kiss to cure it all and-'
And I decide to made the scar of harry is already making him little darker but soft when he heard draco voice. Why is that you say~ well let it be you to answer it, I guess...ehehe
Severus smile toward her, feeling his anger is calm down, ‘how about this severus, you make the potion and I’ll be company you, agree?’
'WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS, QUIRELL!!' the man voice echo the empty room as professor quirell seem to quiet downn than answering more.
In ther other side of the left room seem occupied by a man holding a fragile lizard while shutter to speak infront of the angry person came through the room.
‘don’t pretend you don’t know! You’re silly girl! I’m werewolf and I can smell of his scent on you!’
He never thought to find the right wand for him is very long hour. His mother look worried and curious why her only son take very long to had a wand.
As she reach there, she called 'draco-' but, she never expect to see, as her eyes feel hurt just by seeing her only boy crying in tears. Which is for first time her boy act as a boy in age eleven years old, like another kid suppose to be..
'its time..but now he must be safe from the one who-know-who' the blue girl state in harsh tone and look both the man from speaking again.
'gosh..she keep saying its not wingardium leviohsa but leviosa..gosh she is a nightmare i told yah' said ron in loud and clear with the boys he walk together.
‘HER!?’ instead of answering, he let go of her legs and walks slowly ahead to the door and lock it tight for his dear vixen, padma.
Hearing his name been called is nostalgia again all over. Will he be stay in his olld house or worst another.
So, he decided to use the muggle and un-Malfoy way, which is blinking. Yes, blinking like crazy to massage the muscle to make it more-
'errrr..I think I should go now' harry slowly stand and gave slight look while still blushing thinking of draco's last word.
'shut up pansy and first of all that harry is not my boyfr-' draco trying to explain to pansy, but been cut of by seeing harry land safely.
‘why! I did told many time is NO and my permission will be no and you are staying here whether you willing or not! I-'
I want to say thank you for supporting this manual story and thank you my dear readers for giving kudos and added bookmark.
‘you know~ that boy will never answer unless his little dra- ‘said a women voice, as her eyes linker in dark toward them.
‘errrr…yeah I’m coming in…err excuse me then’ awkwardly Draco said, as he became she slowly pushes the door that already had wide open.
Pansy smiling for seeing her childhood friend was back as draco again and not the malfoy way of attitude, softly she tease back 'and theres draco i know as well'
‘well… professor… its better his father never knows. I can’t trust that lucius. That’s all I can says, professor’ replied Severus Snape in slow tempo of word, feeling worry for his godson, draco to have this danger.
Draco nod in agree to harry as he curious to see hermione behavior is not the same hyper than she was at the morning, ‘mione.. harry.. we better hurry to the room now. I feel the library at night is not good at this night today’
But is it related to harry potter or draco Malfoy as the last fleux? How in the world the news spread so fast? And why only Minerva or Severus know?
Ahh nearly forget...heheheh the book of dark desire will be more reveal in another chapter. So be prepare for this dark journey~
Wait. 'Marly'? is that directed to me? well no one here, other than me and this man in front. something is not right here.
No words or answer seem spoken as the man in front him gave a warm heart with his hand holding bread carefully.
‘like I believe that!’ said the man with the black cloth name is Severus Snape, while his eyes fury in anger as his heart beating in fear for the werewolf to smell his desire hide within in his blackness overclothes.
'boy...sleep' the book's voice more stern as it seem know draco's mind for the dream he having just now.
‘naughty girl should be punishing for slapping this face… I wonder~’ the sound of the zipper made the girl, name Padma froze as she feels fears all over her body of the man’s eyes.
Lucas smile with ease as his baby brother slowly to feel sleepy with his small cute yawn,’nite boba’ while carrying him toward his cozy bed, ‘well.. I guess my baby brother is sleep mate now… I love you my dear baby brother’
'Why you failed again you FOOl!!' a faceless man appear behind the bald man head, professor quirell.
Hermione signed, 'what am I going to do? Ron and harry is still unawake, while I scold harshly toward Draco even, he doesn’t anything wrong. On other hand, why pansy give me that potion?'
With no question from both of her friend, she continue again, 'I did take a copy from the book, but only half of it that relevant to ron situation. but if it not enough information, we can look at it again tomorrow. because I also take reserve that book for only 60 days. It is in restrict section and I had hard time to convince the librarian teacher.
Immediately, harry take eye contact toward draco looking curious for draco saying please to him, 'ermm what is it that you need my help, dra?'
‘hmmm...that’s explain it. Well what should we do now?’ draco stare at harry for some clue what to do with the book they been waiting, while hermione coming toward them.
'come here..young malfoy..' the voice repeat again, as the bright seem calmly show his way to one of the empty house.
As she walks out from library, a brown eye seems watching her very closely and slowly creep to follow behind her like a shadow and that person is…
Like how his brother is not part of his childhood time and why draco can’t even remember his brother? For what reason it happens before? Is draco really from Malfoy family? The thought of it always hunt his mind.
The student around her seem whisper and hatred look on her. Sometime each word she can easily ignore without knowing it, but sometime the word can also easily hurt her very deeply.
All the sudden, the light were too bright for him to see and then all black was the last thing he see.
The strange thing is that the curse stops in every night, however, the curse seems to effect in daily light and even worse in daily afternoon. The young girl named Hermione stared and stared the book that seem to be became useless.
'ah..yes..miss malfoy. Your son wand is very forbidden' mr-know-wand stare stern toward his mother, as if the glare is nothing effect at all.
Within that moment, a white light burst had nearly blind his eyes and the last voice he never expected to heard was the mystery book, ‘…its time…dear…young malfoy….’
In that night, the two students of different house, slytherin and griffidors. But, things not well went for that man.
'its the same book that similar that happen to that person and its happen toward ron' draco reply back toward harry's unsolve question.
'no im not. Some people ask me that before and end up look sorry for insult' the blond boy calmly reply back to them.
Whispering the spell to dry his body is simple for him but still not used if not good in potion. Where his godfather, severus snape, teaching the students.
The mother trying calming him down as the boy still in tears for remember the dark night he never ever forget. Where his mother laying there dying.
‘I wonder what harry smiling about in his dream I wonder hmm…?’ a voice from a brown-hair girl looking more tired from staying up all night. As she keeps thinking the same thought over and over again for the dead of all her classmates, her best friends, the people she knows, especially what break her heart, is her parents.
‘you may begin, leon’ replied the man with black mask, still remain his stare toward the castle belong to the mistress named Laila.
“fine. What is it that you need so badly for my help, pansy?” ask draco in question with his left eyebrow up, while looking ahead on pansy’s eyes.
‘silly little brother! the wind will not run away’ said Lucas in smile, looking his little brother, Alex jumping in excited to play his first muggle game.
The sun shine reflected toward the unclose dark green curtain, as each boys still soundly sleep. There the very own same bed of slytherin boy.
'hmmm..very charming. So many curse and pain..very sorry..dear young boy..hmmm were to put you..' the sorting hat looks very hard thinking.
Here is the continue story of Draco as women that he barely knew or is it? Why he feels something was not right? Why he never knows this person was his great-great grandmother? (this the continue of the 1947 scene)
'don't fool me quirell! I knew its you that nearly kill potter and made act of troll! ANSWER ME WHY!' the man stand stern which is he, professor severus snape, who always doubt toward quirell fake act.
‘well suited yourself, Cedric. I really don’t know what is going on with your family had to do with draco, but if you hurt draco, I also curse you with my wand! Cause draco is my family as well even if it’s not blood related’ says hermione, trying to act strong but she knows she needed too after what happen to her two best friends, harry and ron.
Unknown to him, there was man watch him like soldier in duty. Which had the glint to his eyes to see the every move of the boy, as he also slowly dissolve to dissapear as well.
Hermione begin to read the half copy she take, as both harry and draco listen closely, 'hmm well the book of the dark desire needed someone who is pure or sinner for the ritual to be complete as-'
(WARNING: THIS IS STORY IS SLIGHT OF DARK THING) I repeat and mostly feel like I making a history subject. Glad I’m not taking anymore.
‘Am I really that important to him’ whisper draco as he continue hearing their conservation behind the door.
‘HARRY! Listen to me. Draco is only one that can calm you down. not me. not even the headmaster. but Only him, Draco! your draco. and I know that you love him, harry’ hermione smiled seeing her friend, as harry keep blushing hearing his crush name, draco.
'ah..yes please sit harry. Sorry i just shock for you here. And yes i was here early and you know my family is early bird' he yawn as prove his statement.
“I think...I should visit mione and you missy! I will talk to you later…gosh pansy” Draco feel frustrated of the lost trust from pansy toward him.
The feet move him to the mirror waiting for him to see. As his feet is stop and he know he is stand infront the mirror. He shut immediately his eyes as if its burn to see mirror infront of him.
''ah..nothing, just feel weird. Don't worry about it pansy' looking relieve for pansy to stop from questionning him again.
Very sorry for confusing for the sorting hat of draco, it still mystery..until he know all the truth sooner..
'-like you the one to talk pansy! Panty i called yah! You fuc- the loud slap on theo face is clear for all people there see. How red it was.
The glow stop and a tatoo appear on left arm,  instead of the black ink just now, it appear as blue attach and word written on the skin, but soon disappear as if it never been there before.
“oh, it was you! that spy on us! I knew it that someone was watching! Wait the minute, did you just call hermione as mia?” draco look sterner in the eyes as he feels he need more answer from his childhood friend, pansy.
‘not really draco. Usually it just normally open like any other book.?! Do I pick the wrong book?..ahh! I remember! I left it for about a minute while I went to pick another book in other section. Maybe that’s why I don’t how it supposed to be open?’ hermione feels as if she had been trick or is it, while putting the other book back to the bookshelf beside her.
Guess what? Draco had been pulled in another travel far ahead of past by the mystery book after encounter with the familiar figure that in chapter 30. (aka he will return and had change the timeline once again). Here is the continue of the story.
All the people even the mistress and the son looking anticipated toward the last speech of the vote, feeling the nervous was all in heard.
‘THAT’s not possible,’  Remus said in firm and hatred bolded on the each sentence without looking the man that keep staring him in curious pace.
I’m super sorry for the super late as I had need time to recall the dream, I had for the past few month and happy new year everyone (super late well yeah) and gong xi fa chai (for Chinese New Year). work from home ah ah...
With no more think about the danger of who the sound was, Draco went with speed light toward the strange pain cry. Worry if it was hermione that had hard time.
Away from the table of ron and hermione, from 4 sit away. One of the student try very hard and the spell gave-
In middle of the night, different place of location but shocking drive happen for each students involved in that night.
His hand tied. His body full of scar and fresh one was not only he thinking about, other than that he had sense he had another little brother. A proud one as his belated-brother. feeling his mind drift to one of his memory.
'so whats the news again? sorry but can you repeat it again?' harry decide to change subject and really wish mione don't question anymore.
'in the future before..you were not know about..the book..nor the wand..nor the fleux history that been hidden in..century..you are curse like harry..but different curse..you the young malfoy the last fleux..the bond with werewolf..which is sirius black..your cousin...and lucas..your real brother that...been forgotten...' the sorting book explain the unexpected truth for him to know.
‘tell me! Where is your master, leon!?’ yelled the man as he keeps thrust toward the girl’s warm core.
With that, the bodyguard begin their duty again to brace themselves in death bleed for the young boy name, Draco Malfoy.
‘don’t worry mistress, we the bodyguard of fleux will protect him till the last of our breath of dead’ said one of the man with the bright green eyes like snake edge shape look.
'er yeah..hey' in the minute, the boy name harry awkwardly reply back to the twins. The twins gave harry a cheeky smile and harry smilling back. Which still awkward way.
‘well hello there as well cedric. Ah I see from grandma side? but not mother side? Or father side?’ draco feel he had a lot a question toward this boy as his ‘cousin’ appear.
And his name is Severus Snape, who is quietly doing correcting the student's assignment, ‘I need a clear head now…hah’ he signed tiredly, feeling warm from the firewood that eases away from the cold.
On the side of the fortune shown the bright moon in the night sky. Where the students consist of two Gryffindor and Slytherin, had the feel a little sleepy, while, waiting for the book to reveal its own truth than the copy illusion behind it.
'Child..is me madam poppy' slowly open the door while strolling the table full of medicine potion ready to cure ron's bruisers. One by one, the potion is pored to ron's body, each potion had different effect.
She did it. She slap herself and knowing it hurt as the her face is already looking pinkish red, 'for ron. yes for ron' she mumbling repeating like a mantra, as she finish her the last page of book that she holding.
'hmm..funny that you stop begging, dear leon? is it to much to says pressure to says THE REAL NAME of you? well.. I will gave you one change and that's it!! NOW GO!' with that, Terry boot or leon disappear without a trace.
Hello hello dear readers..very very sorry because busy with exam and now im free ftom that and thnk you once again for choosing this..
'..the sorting hat is there...waiting for you...that seek...answer..go..now boy..' the book whisper, which made draco curiously why the book and sorting hat is know each other?
‘are you sure this is the right book, mione?!’ the male voice, name draco that seem had the look of doubting about the book called ‘desire’.
He wonder if harry heard it. He thought while looking beside harry face look excited and fear for damage he had done.
With that, his out to sleep on his old bed in his memory and snoring for first class tomorrow once again.
Instead of answering to the person near her, Hermione was too focus to the work in front of her as she had worries to think about.
Draco feel fear toward harry's attitude for acting like the him, the dark one. The dark he rather died than join like in the past before, and right now he need to try to calm himself. He also needed to calm harry as well.
'Yes draco, pureblood. but let me read the next one first' Hermione calmly says as she begin to continue to read for them, 'This four type consist different ritual. The first one is for pureblood, it stated that the rule to pureblood person is, must find the pure one that are not touch by sinner and those who had the slight red hair. The second one of famous, it says that must be drag in full of blood in certain person with orange or red hair as the sheep-goat sacrifice. Next, the dark magic's rule is must be done by using the blood of someone dead wand that require 10 of it. Lastly, the treasure is needed the blood of the virgin women that must be in 15 years old and no more than that age. Each disadvantage had the same occur, which is the person will be became in the situation of half dead state and, the only to heal it by drinking the herb of Hifiselrd'
'errmm hey too, harry. Ready for the game?' slowly he speak in gentle tone as his eyes lock with harry's forest eyes.
‘grrrr! Stop it pan! What is it for this disturb that you sooooo wake me up in this early bugle morning and I curs-‘
‘GO back to bed. This is between your mother and me’ Lucius stated in firm as stare with tears dropping slowly.
'you sure, draco?. If you not well just-' pansy were cut off by another voice in the same house, theo.
She tried again with a spell “alora!” but the book can’t seem to open. As curious as she is, something about this book must be related with what going here or is it? Thought hermione as she need to thinks of way to open this unopen book.
The boy, harry shake his head. Beside him, hermione raise her hand to answer, but the professor ignore her and continue to ask question 'hmmm..what about the potion for sleepless? Or the wake someone up'
'hmmm..hmmm..the man is cold~ and lay up for another day..hmm hmmm..i-' the open door slide open made him stop his singing tune.
Not knowing harry stick his eyes toward the young draco who busy eating the bunch delicious food infront of him.
‘hermione? Is that how it supposed to be happen?’ a beautiful blond male, draco malfoy looks disbelieved what he heard on his ears, usually it was the mystery book that whisper on his ears.
'forgive me dobby, and yes i need help. How do you know?is it from father or mother?' he curious ask, fear if it is his father who know it all or, his mother who love to support him no matter what.
I wonder if harry is wakeup. He thought as he had another hour to go to wakeup the lazy ass of slytherins.
As the last sentence of word, the spell hit the man who hold the body in unmercyness as he fall down in pain 'augggh!'
But all he see is a book laying there on the cupboard and very dark sense which shiver to his skin, as he look longer to the book.
Never thought this time travel had change all the timeline he made as he stare hard toward the person who cast in different words, that he never heard before.
'alright student, slowly put you legs between the broom and before you fly. Slowly lift you upper infront and-' madam rolanda was cut off her explaining as neville seem lost control of the broom.
Warning is that its too bizzare reaction among this story. Double warning, the grammar or any name may not in correct word but, this is dramantic moment..
Draco stare his eyes toward harry as hermione demand in answer as well with their eyes lock toward to him.
'ahhhhhh a spider' some screaming voice from outside stopping from questionning harry's strange behaviour.
Breath in. Out. In. Out. Come on malfoy, calm down,  is just harry. Yep just harry. Draco calmly focus his breath in his mind as harry seem lost in thought. Not knowing that draco in panic moment.
The plan he desire was long gone as harry was his plan to safe but fear that the long boy who lived is dead.
In other side of the room, full of mirror and there. A huge mirror stand by, which a bald man slowly open his scarf and facing his back head toward the huge mirror.
Thats new. Just now his eyes won't blink or away for his eyes. He smile as he still feel weird for the boy to had that reaction.
‘stop! I think draco need to heard all of this from you and not me, cedric. I’m a third party. Even if draco is considered as my family. But. Me as his best friend must be respect his feeling no matter what situation. I’m sorry for my curious question. Sorry cedric’ replied hermione in forgiveness way, making draco feel proud of hermione’s attitude.
'..come.. Malfoy..', he was froze to heard the voice know who he is as he still wonder who or what calling him.
There is unexpected scene between romance or hate? Between Remus Lupin and Severus Snape (kinda short but there’s secret between them, what is it?)
'stop stop..stop doing it like a madman and its wingardium leviosa not leviohsa' said the smart girl, hermione, which made ron groan hearing the girl statement.
Silence. The only thing that can answer her as she burst into tears, knowing her fate is going to crash down for her own doing.
Hermione and harry examine ron face which still look fresh bruise. While draco still curious why ron attitude change from 180 degree to 360 degree form of people.
'well..honey, mother had to go and get you other supply of books and, can you go by yourself to get a wand at mr oliver?' she stated and look at my answer for ensure he is oke going by himself.
‘you okay dra?’ eyes worried as the boy-who-lived, harry potter stare toward his crush, draco Malfoy.
Not even the one with his own familys or other teacher, or students in different houses. because it was a dark secret only madam poppy, headmaster and the three students that knows about ron situation.
hello dear readers...I’m back again in this new adventure (the continued story of the fight between Draco’s childhood friend with Hermione granger. How on earth it begin?), is it pansy that follow Hermione from the library to the dorm?
The morning was strange for draco because theo act like him in his first year where, he throw neville ball and harry the boy who lived is being a seeker act.
Draco loss a word. He stares and stare the person in front of him as if he had seen a ghost. why his face look familiar like my great great grandpa? Draco’s mind confuses as the person in front of him still rumbling with nags and keep calling him ‘Marly’
'ron? Are you oke? What happen to you? Now you look better than pale' draco look worry as ron bowed his head in shame than answer his question.
The sound of the door bang startled both madam poppy and draco, as harry's face is full of anger,  'What do mean ron's body can't last long!!!? and why the strong potion can't help him? WHY? TELL ME WHY!!'
‘I... I HATE YOU TERRY! WHY! TELL ME WHY! JUST WHY ME! TERRY- ‘the man name terry boot decided to stop and left her sprawled in relieved as she needed as much rest.
‘i.. I will see you soon Severus. I had secret that I must share with you and I will tell you. Umm goodnight…’ said Remus as he hurry ran past Severus. Not even a glaze to look behind toward Severus staring at his back and he whisper short reply, knowing he the wolf can heard it, ‘goodnight too Remus…
‘Awooooooooooooooo!-‘ echo another sound again from the mere werewolf, that seem to be near. Closing her eyes and shutting her mouth very close as she tried not be scared. But do i? she thought.
'hmmm hmmm.. Hmmm hmmm..wise is told~ told wise..dear is gone..hmmm hmmm hmmm-' as he was humming and again he been stop to humming the tune.
With no doubt, he knew with silence report will be cruel pain for him to withstand, especially with the ‘familiar spell’
Draco heart seem faster to heard that rough tone he never expect to heard from eleven years old boy, harry.
'seriously harry? Is it in yeah confirm or yeah in question mark?' hermione replied, with her eyes still on harry that seem giving her a confusing answer.
‘where am I… wait?’ pause the boy name Draco, as he realizes his voice sound like more feminine. These thoughts had me out of the bed and stumble toward the bathroom that seem open for me to see what happen to-
The sound of pain from him had made the man in front of him stop speaking and looking him in worry’s eyes. Just what is going on.
‘that human is still not screaming at all?’ asked the women, name Ursula looking bored toward the unmoving figure.
The sound of bell ring behind him. 'oh hello?' a familiar voice saying to him. While his back is only the person seeing.
In the same present time but in a different location in more private. There a man with the same dark tone clothes, he is known ‘the strict one, the evil one that adores his house but sometimes he was not and many more rumors about him.
‘yeah yeah I know, curse me to dead spell bla.. bla.. but that’s so lame draky.. and I really need your help’ pansy had her eyes in weird twinkle, making draco want to go back to his fluffy pillow.
I guess I had to wait and maybe look a clue of the poem she had said in the ritual that maybe can cure Harry or maybe Ron that sleep for too long, Draco thought as he watch the ritual carefully.
‘no...no! I won’t allow you! YOUR’E my wife and I had my rights to protect you and our family here! So no the answer will always be no!’ stated the no harshly as the man walk away, while the wife tears flowing unstoppable.
‘aza.. aza.. the fourth of the third the third of the fifth let the spell bind on the virgin..aza aza..’ the spell crumpled as the ground shake as the girl float in the air. The ritual is ready.
'pleaseee!! stop !! I beg you! no! get away from me!! you MONSTer!! nooooo!' the sound of the girl screaming echo the dark room with the familiar guy.
'i wish that this is not a merely crush' said harry to himself as he walk toward the griffidors dorm.
Just who is he exactly. What secret his family hide. Draco frown in thought as he see his mother that always had the looks of panic and alert whenever he sit on the manor's library.
Boom. The boy face were black as chacoal colour and beside the boy is harry, 'sir..i think we need a new feather here'.
‘I think it is err red hair heritage if I am not mistaken?’ mione said as she feels her mind is already full of information while harry had the determined looks.
‘hmmm..begin to repel that protection spell girl! And listen! Don’t fail me!’ the man command as the girl bowed again.
‘yes, miss granger?’ ask the handsome boy, name cedric diggory, as hermione feel unsure to ask or not.
‘no! you would be in danger staying there! What if it happen you1 like our son Alex happen like!’ stated the fact as the man feature strike beauty among both gender, as his name is Lucius Malfoy while he stare hard toward his wife.
‘brother! brother! come come plea- ‘feeling the wind getting strong for muggle game of kite to play for these two brothers, sons of Malfoy.
He wish his mother never said anything about the forbidden wand to the father. Father happy is not good for him.
Without thinking of the fate that may change between them, Severus grabbed his hand, urging him down to sit in the green long comfort sofa beside him. When his cheek brushed against his shoulder, his chin came to rest on the top of his head. Knowing the height difference between and also knowing new sensation overwhelm Severus for the first time in 30 years.
'…the down of fall may upon you, the fall of you is bound, let the term of soul is broken, made this person to sleep till dead, let the charm work for the cur- '
hello again, dear readers and, yes lately had a late updated for each chapter as I was trying to find inspires and times, so by that, I’m trying to mix in bizarre kind of this in my head slowly...
'so k draco. Just me that know. I wonder if love is there'  pansy tease as seeing his face more red that seem out for his pale skin.
The title I choose today is ‘my little dragon’ which of course related to our dear draco but who do you think says this? Brother or father?
Another figure just lying in pain while glance a little, and in end giving with no answer to report to toward the dark figure Infront of him that is known as ‘dark lord or the name that should not be name ‘Voldemort’.
‘hermione stop it!’ a male voice name Draco Malfoy feel his heart ready to be bust out, while Hermione snickered in tease to see her best friend, draco in blushing face and smiling in ease.
What is it about him that seem made males to look at him that curious. He thought as the both male whispering ear to ear, so that harry and him can't heard it.
'but dru-' the man want to deny but been cut off by a form of blue wavy hair women appear next to them.
The sunny day were still out as the two people waiting outside Hagrid's hut. One particular person seem worry and anxious to see him and worry about his other fren for being missing.
In the side of the walk, the bright was a checklist to do for the other male, name draco seem excited to meet harry as if it was very long time not going hangout together and-
The sound of the argument between the groups had the tense atmosphere as the each had different opinion about the boy name draco, the last fleux.
‘MARLY!! Hey! Wak-’ the man screams as he shakes Draco’s body to stay awake but Draco’s head getting more hurt as if someone kicking him with Curcio curse.
'it is non of your business, traitor!' the boy, theo claim to be annoyed for draco to need fight from hex the person infront of him.
Did someone curse me or something? What in world happen here? Thought Draco as he sees this body seem soft, which is never been rough life before.
His heart ache of the loss of his first son and also grieve toward his second son, that died before draco is even born, and he knew draco need know the truth from them. But when.
'sorry..just i ermm..feel unwell' he lied as he know the book were whisper to him but no one does heard the book nor see it.
'good night..my dear nephew..be safe' the women kiss the young boy forehead and form away as tickling dust fairy.
Remember where the meeting happens in the forbidden forest (which is in the chp of 25), which is a right decision for draco as the warrior and the last fleux.
'HARRY POTTER IS DEAD!!' shout one of the dead eater. He froze as he stop where he hide not far away from the death eater stand.
The elf stare toward tanaka for answer as tanaka begin to calm to answer, ‘I want to thank you for the question, my dear fellas. Let me begin to explain, that the boy the young Malfoy may or may not accept that is up to that boy. All we need to do is giving the trust, the truth behind his generation history and the past he had forgotten in long time-’
Both professors silent as if waiting for the next move from the man Infront of them, ‘well... professor we had a news that include the safety of the boy harry-’
'fine fine..well harry! You went to that the forbidden section, right?' hermione look begin in serious mode toward harry, which is to confirm that section did excist.
Madam poppy examine ron over 2 minute as she heal with a potion dap on ron skin. The purple-green bruise seem nearly gonee as the redness were left as a sign to recovery.
The last sentence seem question for the boy as draco nodded in agreement without voicing up his voice, 'very well..lay down and...close your eyes boy...avor decae sfif fagu deru avou.. Avor-'
'well let me see if you can catch this?!' theo throw the ball and with that, harry speed his flying to save the ball.
Ron ignore hermione's statement and look back to harry eyes once again 'its true, harry, my brothers said so'
Still in 15 minute done his so long bath as eleven again is still unbelieve for him. As if its a dream or a curse play in his head and he is laying dead to see it and-
In the very moment..the light glow from the wand and the young boy, draco, glow without for the boy knowing it..
“gahhh…pansy! the hell with that water!” groan the boy name draco, while his eyes stare hard toward the person Infront of him.
Miss you. Harry sighed as he get up to get some sleep as draco already walk out for him to stare the blond boy back.
The women stay look the young malfoy sleep beauifully without knowing there were people argue about him.
I wonder also, why ron became like this, thought draco as he sitting beside harry on the black sofa, still thinking for answer.
‘Yes? Who is it?!’ shouted Severus, but no answer in replying back to him. Feeling annoying, he turned back toward his unfinished work to do.
‘how am I going to calm down minerva..that he that he-‘ severus feel his word stuttered, very not like him.
‘hmm hmmm... the night is still young~ I believ-’ a sound of the male voice humming toward the harry’s room as the beautiful male, draco Malfoy bringing the food for him and hermione’s dinner there.
'why indeed.. You were tasked to stay there..and i know you are indeed many kind that..fit with other sort of house..but..you were tasked to be slytherin..' the more the sorting hat explain, the more puzzle draco about 'who' given him that task.
The sound of the slap sound in each skin, there was nothing she can do. As she lay there in tears, while her body is being devour again for his mercy.
'..boy..its time for...you to know..why you are not sort in..different house..' seemly the book looks like reading his mind again and that Is still not use for him, the malfoy.
‘ahh sorry err so emm what is it that you ask?’ asked hermione who was shutter as now in curious mode of the boy in front of her.
As Severus's head found a pillow on his biceps, he trembled when the wolf’s other hand rose up to his hip, beneath the hem of his shirt, and his fingers spread over his bare stomach and wrapped around his waist. Remus held him tightly, until the warmth of his once again more melded with him. Until Severus couldn’t tell where Remus ended and he began.
The moon shine so bright that show her pale skin that scatter with a pool of blood of unmoving body but up ahead-
'NO!' harry pull back his hand from draco's full force, which end up draco fall down harshly, 'Owww!'
Something change on the green wall. The sound were loud but non of the people in the room were wide wake. As if the sound is not loud enough.
hello dears readers.. forgive me for the late comeback, I was off to work while in wait for the result in my second degree, and yes this is still continue work of story.
‘well.. it just simple question which is not that harmfully to say right?’ Remus calmly said as he smile wide toward the man name Severus, who had confuse face written on his face.
‘I know! but he is our first son and older brother to draco, Lucius! Please!’ begged the women with her tears burst in plead for her husband to save their lost son. It was decade of years for the wait after draco was still young back then.
Ahh..he remember this, that harry as seeker in the griffidors team. Draco smile as he watch harry follow professor minerva.
Harry puke out the ball and the crowd once again viral, 'the finish point by harry of the griffidor' shout speaker.
Draco tease back for harry reply 'ouh harry..of course i support you and goodluck there' made harry smile again in return, as harry take the goodbye to him and walk to ready to start the game.
'funny to see traitor of slytherin here' annoying voice appear to stop them from teasing each other.
'alright alright just let me take my breath first!!' said harry who look like a person that wanted to drop down on the nearly wall.
‘errr guys? What are you guys thinking or talk about it?!’ harry who look of confuse as he sees both of his friend had maniac mind of knowing things unexpected, he never learns to understand.
Here is the continuing story (from Chap. 33) with romance occur between Remus and Severus (that they never expected to happen)
Ahh. So theo want us there. Funny. Wonder what he want. Draco look toward pansy and theo in stand closely as he thought funny for awhile.
hello dear readers~, long days is it… as we heard that news about virus. Made sure to stay secure and safe and it seem also loss kudos… my my sorry for the long wait….
Dreaming about a book. Really odd and off for me but i really imagine the book of its own may had the secret behind it.
'ah yes, do you know about fleux?' he ask in questionning. Not know if it there when he sneak to the family's library.
‘i..’ severus feel uncomfortable as he walks away from them, while minerva follow to calm him down from behind.
Oh gosh please don’t came here. Padma beg silently while she shut her eyes in fear while laying in pain on the moist forest ground.
Upon the warm atmosphere, the boy read in the silence time for himself. As all students sleep tight for adventure trip on the largest mansion own by Eagit Filut.
As harry tried to attack madam poppy, draco stop by pulling harry hand harshly away from madam poppy, 'harry please stop this!!! please I said STOP!! AND WAKE UP HARRY pleassse! I beg you' draco beg and beg toward harry, as he pull again harry left hand with his both hand in full force.
But. That person can only silent as answer, with the rope tight on both his arms and his legs, as he is hanged on the big rock.
‘for-forgive me mas-master. The informati-ion that I got that the castle is full of protection spell and I umm- ‘the girl feels her mind blank and bowed lower than before, which she feel in fear  for the master in front of her.
I love the weird humour about the weasley family and may lose for ron as brat to be.. Rude at first i will gave..need spice than too boring story.
'hey what happen to you draco? why you look so exhausted? and you smell like healing potion..blugh..' she look the exhausted draco as he seem unmove or reply her back.
In reach of going home, the man name hagrid, the keeper, which is giant as tall as tree. Slightly a dull memory for him remember about the burdbeak that he tease for being cocky. Which end him hurt and being that 'brat' for burdbeak dead. Or so?
Well..well..im happy to see the amount of reaction for this dramantic story in previous chapter and forward one..
Neither harry and draco knows that other weasley also heard his answer, ron and percy, which also included others griffidors, neville and hermione.
In the full moon of night, the huffed of the wolf howl as the girl keep begging to stop for this man to stop.
Hmmm interesting to see that Cedric is my cousin, thought Draco as he feels he had really had change the timeline even different.
‘SILLY GIRL! Don’t lie~’ the man had his smile widely, as he keeps pulling harder on the girl’s hair.
The book written clearly 'Beware of the seer's vision' his mind curious in question as he turn behind the book, 'done by fleux clark'
'Stop! Everyone proceed walk normal and head student lead the students carefully toward the dorm now!' shout the headmaster as the students quiet down and went calm state toward each dorms.
‘wakey wakey little padma~’ the male figure stares the girl laying naked with no clothes to cover her, as he devours her beautifully again and again.
‘sleep little girl~ papa here for you~’ was all she heard before she black out to sleep in exhausted state.
Wonder why im up this night. He yawn as he look the room were filled with small candle stick on the greenish wall.
Well here is the continuing story of Padma, which is kind of short (from dark desire, if you read from previous ones) of new torture or is it her beginning of freedom. The time keep ticking…. (padma’s part scene):
‘oh brother! you’re so slow~ the wind will go away!’ frown a boy, name Alex Malfoy looking back his older brother is still little far from where he stands.
well, this scene I tell yah is mix of three side stories but still related and I hope you like this long passage. Like I said, the drama I give you. I will give you.
Draco had the feeling that Harry had the curse and not just curse but unknown curse putting inside him.
So, they decide to scare him with their's brother spider. They counted to 3 2 1, and throw to the spider on the blond lap. The twins shut their eyes in fear for the blond reaction.
Once again only silent was the answer given the elder son of the Malfoy, ‘interesting boy~ you are~’ the women scowled in response seeing the boy had stubborn of genetic occur for Malfoy’s kin.
‘Grrr I try sister… but that human is very stubborn and maybe we should just kill his little brother! we did it before sister’ reply the younger brother, name Clarus.
As the time when by, it seems the ritual was done with the strange red flame that burst out of Harry’s body. Strange as it be…it was not a ritual I seen before, Draco thought as his eyes follow his childhood friend, pansy move into shadow and gone within a second.
'ermm im-' his word were cut as mr oliver deliver appear out of no-where 'hello there both~' startled both of them, him and harry.
'just one last book to read' she muttered in sadness tone as she opens another book, which seem look heavier than the other book. Hermione tried to open but failed ahead,”grrrr!”
‘oh just shush mione..oh merlin save me from this mad women’ said harry, still had his blush on his face.
'well done miss granger and so do you mr malfoy. Both get 40 point each' smile the professor filius and moody ron hearing that the girl can made it fly.
Looking draco face also, making harry more worried and, they really need to do something about it, 'how about we go to the forbidden section to look more information about it. And Its better to know why it happen to ron. Why only ron involved.'
‘hmmm... I see and did you know what is the name of that warrior?’ the man asked his servant for more information.
Hermione also had this attitude of anger each time he tried to say hello or just knock the door. Is it she bad mood or something else?
The man name tanaka stop for a second as he takes a drink from the cup that serve on the long wood table, ‘-And the safety of his will be fine, which I heard he had safely receive the forbidden wand and he been knowledge as the master of that wand. His magic will not detect as the wand control his magic and people like, outsider will only see him as the low magic’
'nothing! And its not your own business' he reply back as he stare hard toward theo's dark iris black-brown eyes.
‘well..lets just do all of them. It is make sure we’re not miss anything, hermione. So what do think harry? Hermione?’ draco replied while feel sad seeing his friend, hermione had that kind of look of pain.
‘ahhh… yeah I remember that. But what it had to do with what you guys thought about it?’ harry look at them to look for clue of what they trying to says.
And when..he ready to went back home, which take him to catch up his angry mother that walk far ahead from him. Harry  had stop him.
‘ahh sorry..my cousin name is draco? Is he going to be here soon?’ Cedric’s face had the look of happiness, making hermione in heart throb face.
Instead of theo, he choose pansy. Theo hatred toward kindnest people, that people his mother and other women.
‘I’m coming~ I’m coming- ‘the older brother trying to catch up his little brother that already fast on his feet.
‘yes, mother I’m telling the truth. I tell him that I meet him on Saturday, in private of course. And maybe mother and dad can see him on that day. I will tell the letter met us at London’ said cedric, still in his smiling face.
The boy feel calm and slowly dowsy as the book repeat the spell weirdly, '-dra de de cao avor sfif decae...,'
‘please… stop..I I need rest...I beg you’ the black long hair sprawled on the messy bed, her name is Padma patil. She begs and beg that she need her rest from his torture desire on her.
‘YOU THERE! Tell me your opinion for this boy and EVERYONE!! BE SILENCE AND LISTEN!’ command of the women stand tall in seriousness as she stare toward the man that she pointed out.
They were going to the last row but it looks occupied by the twin red hair standing there and the other full of two red hair behind them.
‘ermmm… alright I agree for ron to wake up’ harry face look determined making draco and hermione smile wide and making them feel little bit warm inside.
As the steps keep slower and slower, the bright red seems occur for him to just go in without interrupting to what goes inside it.
‘ouh...’ draco pretending to be surprises while opening the door seeing theres a guest, knowing draco know all about their conservation earlier.
Neville and hermione just pass upon other student door to find out the where about frog, which neville lost again in his way to get food.
Severus scanning the blinding little darkness of the room. Seeing only the fire pit that light up that can only dim more as the fire slowly to wideout.
A wand. How long will it be for him to feel the core of magic swelling through his blood line, as it work its magic. But, never thought the time travel can made him a forbidden wand ?. Which just laying there for him as chosen one. Is he? Bit why it called fleux? Or unicorn kind?
The man gave no answer as he nodded instead in respond, ‘I never know your godson is the last fleux and is it his father, Lucius know about this, severus?’ asked Minerva in curious, as her eyes still stay on the man’s face.
Never thought the room will be awkward for both of them. Draco thought in his mind as his eyes never look back to see pansy bowed her head down.
'ouh draco' harry accidently spoke the malfoy name made hermione beside him smile and ron shaking his head for harry behavior stalk toward the malfoy, draco.
'what is it mother?' he ask to his smiling mother. Feel weird to see her smile. Did she smile before?.
The book silence for second as it voice up to calm down the young malfoy's fear ,' fear not...boy..i had a spell to..make.you...sleep without that..dream?'
Very soe my grammer of people name or animal is still so not good. But shushh i love drama and the tick is on..
I change my mind and decided to challenge myself on sat or sun for new update… hopefully I will make it to had many drama scripts in my head right now.
‘well alright. I will see you then and thank you cedric’ draco reply with huge smile on his face, knowing cedric never see his smile before.
The glow made a bound between the wand and the boy. The book whisper of same word 'slsi slsi slsi slsi slsi' making the glow more shine that before.
'..i know..' the book seem to like to cut his words in his mind. Very interesting why the book called him.
'hmmm very difficult very..you are easy to put in bit where...' the sorting hat rumbled at lot on harry's head.
In that moment, Draco and Harry start to laugh widely as his friend hermione is very not into waiting time as he recall back when they were in hurry to go to that room. As hermione already busies herself with book time again.
'i wonder~' mr oliver looking like maniac person,  as he stop again in the same spot. Still saying 'i wonder..if this the wand~'
‘yes, I terry boot had taken your first virginity and no one ever knows you’re not virgin, right? Because this spell of mine will make you like a lady that never been touch’ terry had his smirk on his face while looking padma beneath trying to push away his hand away from her legs.
'forgive me master draco, the fleux is only..available..in forbidden or curse book.. It is very hard to find and..forgive me master draco, that the book is not available here..forgive me this lowly elf...' dobby bowed in shame for not gave a good help to the kind malfoy.
'draco?' mr oliver called his first name. The mr oliver never called up his first name, in my memory, he still feel he had change the history line.
‘well?’ a sharp tone brought Draco in alert as he trying to eat like lady like was so far familiar in his family traditionally calling it ’proper manner’.
'Up!' he said in second time and it work strongly for the young malfoy, which receive a warm smile from harry.
'hey careful there, thats my spider..hey-' sound like a weasley to him. He think that its percu or percy weas-
Unexpected to be friend with the weasley people and even in good impress for the muggle girl name hermione want to friend with him.
‘hmmm… let us vote for this decision and let’s start again later’ said the mistress in fierce look, while thinking of the decision giving by the man name lord gurrof.
The soldier with the green symbol with the star ink on it on his head as if it is natural, ‘the vote for the warrior of the fleux for the young Malfoy, draco is about 1000 vote of yes. And the vote that disagree for the young Malfoy is about- ‘
So heres the thing, the warning is the dark spell or something related, and explaining happen for the three student to find out which is suitable for the title ‘the ritual of the bind spell’
‘ohmy~ sound very big news. What is it dearly? You never use this telecon spell unless its something?’ ask Mrs. Diggory, waiting for her son, cedric to tell her the big news he excited about.
Draco feel embarrassed and hurt in the same, as harry keep whisper the same word near his ear, 'i'm sorry draco'.
'..look..boy..look..my magic its real and..i will guide you..as promise..' the book reply as if it know his question for why he here.
Now the question is brought up by the mistress, ‘will that boy be the warrior of the fleux?’ as the people looking forward for the man, tanaka to answer the mistress’s question.
'shut up pansy and its not dating at all. Just comfortable.for.each.other. and you know right that me and harry is not yet know each other that long' draco seem piss off but explain softly toward his childhood friend, pansy.
With the thought of worry, Draco hurry went to the forbidden forest. Unknown to him, the shadow figure lurking following behind him.
As he wonder in thought, when his mother being worry again for his safety and alone 'draco honey? Be safe oke. Don't get hurt and don-'
Slowly he swish his wand, a beautiful glow similar to harry but, in same time different. The glow seem had different tone of colour. Sometime it glow repeat blue then red then it stop white like purely to his blond hair.
Headmaster told ron's family that he in rough fever and need more rest. But. No one knows of his condition as he lay there looking half dead.
As the young malfoy faint on the ground. The door seemly dissappear like magic its suppose to be, along with the book, which long gone together.
'oh yeah, sorry harry. ermm where was I hmmm ahhh!! right, the book! I found it, it is at section B-14. Andddd I already made reserve the room for us in the library, so we can discuss it together tomorrow' Hermione face look excited when she speak about books.
‘fo-forgive me fo-for this m-matter I I h-had a news for m-master’ a female feels her body getting heavier as the man slowly to calm down.
As the word out from his lips, draco eyes now is to his way. Harry's face again, red as tomato fruit.
Harry shake his head twice 'i don't know sir' and hermione in the second time raise her hand with draco along also raising his hand, to answer.
The warm fire place warm the slytherin living room kind of form for any slytherin student to sit on. The design of silver and floral really epic of the simbolic of the green slytherin
Mr oliver seem repeat the word 'very curious indeed..very~' as he went back to the another right base in the low section.
‘f-fo-rgive m-me m-my lord, th-there w-was un-unexpect-ted ha-ha-p-ppen th-‘ peter stutter his word but before he could finish his sentence.
Mother. Father. War. He caught his words all over the place and pale as he feel sick thinking 'it happen again'.
What do think will happen? This chapter will show you the warning 'crush' from our dear draco and harry..
In the forest where the forbidden for anyone to walk in unless it is required of needed by professors or students. There. A very tense and serious discuss of a bunch of group of peoples or creatures gather for the important meeting.
‘aza..cough cough..’ the man feel his leg loose in weak as he know that need to complete the spell for his master.
‘maybe your mother dra? Cause I know she worried about you, you know’ harry said as he eyes still on draco face.
‘sorry to disturb you miss granger. I wondering, may I ask?’ says Cedrick, giving his beautiful smile really can made any women fall to knee.
Thank you as well for choosing this to read and don’t forget to kudos... bless you, my dear favorites reader.
Feeling to be away from the water above him, as he also feel his breathing rapidly faster than before, 'whats going on with me' the question seem to answer when he remember the night in his dream.
The door open and the each side full of two exact face figure, coming of the view staring at him, then stare to harry.
‘guys..listen to this passage, it says that if somebody or a person made a contract to do the virgin person, will be the second complete after the first stage that already been done, which is the sacrifice of person who had the red hair heritage-‘
He turn behind and still glad the elf name dobby is still alive. He heard that dobby is free by the boy, harry.
'you oke now my boy?' she ask calmly to her boy now hugging her from her side, as if scare for her to be gone.
‘ermm hello draco... cousin of mine. I-I umm name is cedric diggory and related on behalf your grandma side as far cousin’
The heat come back again. He thought nervously know that the boy is looking at him with that forest eyes.
Another shadow watch the whole thing. And with that, the shadow silently dissapear unnotice by the madness figure.
In the room, the clock were still stay in 12 o'clock, that same time as he went inside the tall door to meet the sorting hat.
‘no Narcissa… it’s too dangerous... and draco may be the next victim if we gave our location by sending sign- ‘
Her virginity. That’s what pain her. The rough eternity receive from him was far from stopping or slow. It was fast and unsatisfied for his desire lust. Two days was never enough. Never.
'harry! Seriously stop! He will be there' the female huffed, as the boy name harry still walking back to back like theres a baby arrive to be born.
He turn his back and see that the tall dootlr he went through were not there, the wall were remain same as it was before.
‘calm down severus, Dumbledore just said that lupin need you for the fullmoon coming’ said minerva, as she tried to calm severus anger toward the headmaster and the man Remus Lupin that not even here yet.
He look to the person who disturb him. There again. The most green forest seem look straight to his eyes without blinking. Feel weird to be watch that long from the boy, harry.
'wow thats a big package harry!' said hermione in excited voice, while ron still focus eating the food.
'where is it' he groan out loud as he still in page 3. The book may be little but the passage were full of sentence. Like its too much for him to read all over.
well well, so what do think of this scene, and can you guess the name of this *****. and who speak in the line in part 1, part 2 and part 3.
Seem notice his eyes still stay at the boy stand. He slowly reply back to boy, harry 'oh hello too, sorry about that'
This book is very darn tight seal, she thought as she feels her body started to feel exhausted as she stays night lighter in the library.
Very deja vu for him, young malfoy to see that theo as him and he lay low watching the scene is still not used for him.
‘is…it… is it over?’ padma whisper in thin air, slowly she opens her close eyes as she looks arounds.
‘what the?’ Draco startled as he scans toward the mirror while looking back to himself then back to the mirror. The mirror shown his image self but in more beautiful way as the hair is longer below his hip, with wavy look. Not only that, his lips became more plump and-
I jarred into consciousness in the warm silence I never expected to feel, with the acute awareness that I was alone in this beautiful room. Which kind of similarity Deja vu vibe feels on it.
Pansy laugh uncontrol for seeing her childhood friend face were eye-catching to watch and so unusual at all as malfoy. But she know draco is different as always.
'made sure harry is injure and don't fail me!' the man speak in stern as professor quirell close again the cloth back on his head.
Next chapter is about the continue of draco ‘s wand, which is the forbidden wand as the fleux related to him and his generation in his mother unknown history side. Not even know that his mother family had a slight history about the last warrior…. (see this in chp. 25)
Feeling anxious and calm in the same time. To see that the dream was real and why that man look very similar
The boy slowly gulp like its hard to speak 'urmm..no i don't know, but i heard my parent is griffidor! And maybe i think i am griffidor. What about you?'
“ah..dearly boy, the brown girl is already out to the forest. You should advise her dearly boy that forest is not safe!” said the fat lady that appear back to the frame as she’s back from her break duty with miss hippy.
The noon was the beautiful set of the sun surround with the reflect color of red and orange was the nature giving. The meeting to decide for the young Malfoy, draco, was already done.
wow... the idea is very like search for clue and knowing this story really getting more detail. Once again, I feel like… I am in somewhat historical way… when doing this…
Feeling dizzy is not a good day for him. Better borrow this book to investigate. He surely need to rest, as he slowly went to the counter librarian to borrow the book, which is far ahead.
I had this sudden awoken or did i- ‘oh merlin beard! The book yess! the book had the answer!’ Draco said as he sees the book lay on top of the small table top.
(…slowly flashback memory, after Alex Malfoy was death for 3 years. Ms. Malfoy in unexpected pregnant)
Next, the comptition is on for hermione and draco, as the nerdies and smart know it all...and maybe there can be bestie in next chapter.
For to be worry is because, It was already several of days for ron staying in the private hospital in Hogwart and, to be absent in every section of lesson.
Some of his skin was smooth but with his scar that making the skin rough that Severus couldn’t take his hands off it. He briefly wondered what he would do if I kissed that spot, right near his wrist. Thoughts of Lily gave him a pause. Lily, who had no answer for his right of forgiveness as his friend was already long gone.
Slowly, the three of them went inside to where ron was staying and toward the chair near ron bed, 'I-I I  think i'm going to the library and I-' the brown haired girl, name Hermione, run off in hurry, as she cover her face full of fallen tears with her right hand.
'I think so too, draco. I think this someone or himself is desire something, and we never know it' hermione worry face seem making harry realised that this is serious matter.
The sound of someone soft snore was exhausted for the boy name Draco, as he and Hermione had searched many times for some clue to cure their friends, Ron And even toward Harry but disappointed in end.
'very interesting boy, indeed...ahhahahah!' the mask man smirked for the plan to work even without that little witch. the friend of Harry Potter.
'i know. Shut up pansy' draco feel tired to explain for the pansy judgement of 'romance between him and the boy, harry.
'stop boy...' a voice whisper beside seem made him jump and nearly made him fall down on the ground.
