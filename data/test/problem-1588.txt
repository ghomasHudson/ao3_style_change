Harry knew they looked a mess, he could feel his hair sticking up more than usual and when he glanced at Draco... well, he wasn't much better. Snickers and whispers were heard around the room as their classmates took in their appearance. Ron looked at Harry as if he'd grown a third head.
"You deserve better than me," Draco started, and Harry was about to interrupt when Draco continued, "What would people think? The savior of the wizarding world, dating a Death Eater-"
"Oh don't act like you wouldn't be too if it weren't for the fact that your interested about why Harry was so late," Hermione replied, rolling her eyes.
"So is yours you know," Harry laughed when Draco's light expression turned to one of horror as he tried to fix it.
"What happened to you?" Blaise sneered at him.
"I don't want to say," Harry muttered.
"Yeah, well I'm not envious of your situation either," Ron laughed, "At least I got a girlfriend out of it."
"Pansy! I've told you before: it's not like that!"
"That sounds good to me, gives us enough time to tell everyone. And he can tell the rest of the Slytherins," Ron said gesturing to Draco with barely hidden disgust and spitting Slytherins like it was a curse word. Draco scoffed at Ron and moved to get up.
"It's a plan."
"Hush. Yeah, don't you remember when Neville got all cleaned up for Hogsmeade last week? They were meeting for a date."
"Great, we have the alcohol and the room covered, we just need the food, decorations, and music," Blaise said, serving himself from the platters of food that lined the table.
The shop was fairly empty and they worked their way towards the back of the shop. Harry ran his fingers over a nice set of gloves as Draco picked up what looked like a snitch, but it wasn't moving at all. Harry walked over towards him and looked down at it. It was a snitch Harry realized, but it was making no move to get away and Harry wondered if it was broken.
"I suppose, you better pray it let's us in."
"Huh, yeah that does sound kind of cool."
Love you too,
"Dean, Seamus, and Smith; Done." Ron said, leaning back slightly and crossing his arms over his chest.
Hermione looked up from her book to find Harry absently drawing on a corner of his parchment. “Harry, I’ve been meaning to ask, are you alright? You’ve seemed kind of off all day since the Quidditch match. You and Draco didn’t get into a fight, right?”
October 11, 1998
"That's actually pretty cool, I've always had the house elves cooking for me. Anyway, your turn."
"Wow I bet it's late," Draco suddenly interrupted and jumped off the bed. Harry watched him with a small disappointed frown as Draco walked over to his bed. "We should probably head to bed, we have early classes tomorrow." With that, Draco quickly got under the covers and Harry stared after him awkwardly.
When he finally made it to the great hall for lunch, Ron was as red as his hair and arguing about something with Hermione.
Coming hard, Harry trembled under Draco as he rode out the last of his orgasm, he tightened around Draco causing him to come as well.
"Not particularly, but we could go check out the store to kill time." Draco readily agreed and they went into a store a few shops down that had a bunch of Quidditch gear in their window.
“Oh shut up,” Draco said, hiding his smile in his palm.
-------------------------------------
The Great Hall was noisy with talk of the Quidditch game, people already taking bets on who will win. Harry could feel the excitement in the air and saw some nervous kids who were playing their first game today. He remembered not being able to eat before his first match and allowed himself to get swept up in the excitement of the game.
"It's really pretty."
"Just the pleasantries then?"
"Yeah, why were you so late? I heard you got stuck with Malfoy, that really sucks," Seamus said.
"Bye Potter," Pansy said, sending him a smirk and meeting Blaise at the door.
"Sure," Draco laughed, leaning down and placing a soft kiss on Harry's lips. When Harry leaned up to continue the kiss, Draco pulled away and Harry complained. "You wanted to plan a prank, remember?"
"It's a map."
"I think the two hours are over," Draco suddenly announced, standing up and quickly putting his books away before rushing off, leaving Harry feeling quite empty.
October 10, 1998
"That looks like a love letter," Seamus helpfully put in, "you seem to be getting a lot of those lately."
"Uh," Harry started, realizing he had completely forgotten what he was working on. He looked down at the book, hoping it hadn't been too much time since Draco asked the question, frantically searching the page for anything that would tell him what it was again. "Potions," he finally got out after noticing the current page was a list of potions ingredients.
They both rushed back to the common room to grab their book bags, straightening their clothes as they went.
"Last round," Pansy announced and Hermione spun the bottle.
"Was that a compliment?" Harry said, smirking as he dropped his arm. The smirk fell quickly as he was met with the sight of Draco leaning over his work with a concentrated look. The sight was breathtaking and Harry froze.
Draco's ears turned a light shade of pink as he started to strip off his own clothes, following Harry into the warm water.
"I got us into this?! I wasn't the one who slammed into the other, and then started a fight over it," Harry replied, shooting Draco a glare. They both stepped through the portrait hole and before they could continue their argument, they were met with Ron looking slightly anxious.
As you guessed, it's much quieter here than at the Weasley's. The holiday's are a much quieter affair here.
"Well we could bring food up to our room and-" Draco paused for a second, thinking, and then his eyes seemed to sparkle with mischief, "and we could build a fort."
"That's the look," Dean said, arm on Draco's shoulder and leaning into his ear.
Draco kept his eyes determinantly on the thestrals, "I was quite horrible in your class. I didn't mean any of it, I really actually quite enjoy the class."
"He started the whole thing! Why should I be punished too!" Harry shouted, finally voicing his own complaints.
They seemed to notice Draco then, too, calling over to him, "Hey, glad you're here, mind helping out. We got a bit much."
"Harry! Thank goodness you're okay," Hermione said, pulling him into a hug, giving Draco a slightly awkward glance. Her and Ron still were a bit wary around Draco and Harry couldn't really blame them, but they weren't downright refusing to accept that Harry and Draco were friends now, which Harry thought was good. "Were there any weird effects of the potion? What happened exactly?"
"I love you," Draco said, barely a whisper, tracing Harry's features with his fingertips.
"Hmmm, why not. What time is it?"
"Oh right, the prank. Yeah, I'm still in."
"Can we go to The Three Broomsticks yet?" Harry groaned.
"Harry, if you're here to ask about getting back together-" Ginny said, feeling slightly anxious.
They looked at each other shocked for a moment, “I uh-” Draco started.
"No you don't. You're always so," Harry brushed his lips against Draco's neck as he spoke, "reserved." Draco let out a shuddering sigh at the feeling of Harry's lips on his neck.
It had gotten better as some time passed, of course, and now it was only slightly awkward at times when they were all together.
Draco had Harry pinned on the floor and was about to land another punch when the door flew open and they froze.
Hermione seemed to buy it, "Oh I know! Next time we have a party, we're ending it sooner! That was way too late and half of Sunday was wasted because no one could wake up."
"I've got to admit, this was pretty fun," Draco said, sitting up a bit to look at Harry, a rare smile gracing his features.
"Again, we'll help. Okay, step four-" Pansy started to say but before she could the door opened and Pansy slammed the book shut.
Neville and Harry headed out the door first. Blaise leaned over to Draco then and said, "You know, this is kind of like a double date."
"You're seriously going swimming?" Draco asked, incredulous, "It's October!"
"Dare," She said without a second thought.
"Oh, so you're not denying it now huh?" Draco said, taking a moment to catch his breath and smirk down at Harry.
"Oh, Harry, what's up?" Dean asked as when Harry caught up.
"Let me get this straight. You want to pull a prank? On Filch?"
"It's alright, I've already forgiven you. We both made mistakes."
"Today is a full moon, the first since the whole potions thing. So it's kinda like an anniv-" Ron was cut off as Hermione elbowed him in the side with a glare. "What? I'm just trying to make light of the situation."
Only 8 chapters left!
Draco looked around the circle for a moment, "You," Harry said and Ron laughed a little. The coin went into the air and landed on heads. "The question was 'who do I think will get married first, out of the boys.'" Hermione smiled up at Ron at this.
Twenty minutes later, Harry and Draco made their way to the Great Hall for breakfast, only separating when they had to go to their own tables. Harry watched from the Gryffindor table as Draco pushed his eggs around his plate sleepily.
The next place they found themselves was honey dukes and Harry had a bag full of candy and Draco was following behind laughing.
"If you guys are fighting again I'll have to tell Hermione. You don't need to be in any more trouble with McGonagall, Harry," Ron said after a moment's pause, "I came to make sure you were up. Practice is in less than an hour you know, and you still haven't eaten lunch."
Draco sat in the bath until the water ran cold and then drug himself out unwillingly. When he walked out he found Harry writing his potions essay, a look of concentration on his face. That concentration was quickly ruined as he noticed Draco and his face quickly colored, thinking about the night before.
The park was nearby and was one Harry and Draco liked to frequent. At night it was lit up with pretty lights and it was kept well cleaned, it had to be one of Draco's favorite places.
"I don't think much work is going to get done today," Hermione said with a sigh.
"First year, remember?" When Ron still looked clueless, she lowered her voice and leaned towards him, "When we smuggled Norbert for Hagrid."
Harry laughed and Draco loved the way his eyes seemed to glow in the starlight. Their arms brushed as Harry spoke, "You wouldn't want to go through the beginning though, all the colors made my head feel like it was going to split open. Like a permanent hang-over."
"Welcome to all those who are new, and welcome back to those who are returning students. I would like to start off by making it clear that the Forbidden Forest is off limits to all, and make sure to check Filch's new list of banned items.
"I can only imagine. I bet your father ran all over these halls with the same wild hair and goofy glasses you've got too," Draco snickered.
Harry let out a laugh, “Can’t I just do something nice for you?”
"Still..."
"It's alright, I don't blame you for wanting to help," Harry let out a sigh, "It wasn't that bad, I'm sure other people have it worse. They really only made me do the chores and cooking and stuff. My cousin, Dudley, liked to push me around a bit. My uncle would really only lay hands on me when he was having a particularly bad day."
He couldn't stop it though and he felt the hot tears make their way down his cheeks. He'd finally been able to befriend Harry, the thing he'd wanted since he first laid his eyes on this boy, and now he'd messed it all up. Why'd he have to be so stupid?
-----------------------------
"Hmmm," Hermione mumbled, staring down at her plate, "Well I suppose we can scratch that idea off the list then. What about admiration? That could be similar to love and we don't exactly know what the effect of the veritaserum is."
By lunch Thursday, Hermione and Ron were sharing worried looks as Harry quietly ate, resoutly staring at his plate.
"Well then help me come up with one," Harry said, walking over to Draco's bed and flopping down on it.
"What?! No no no-," Ron finally burst out, successfully dragging over the eyes of just about everyone else in the dining hall.
"Aw come on, you can tell us."
"Good idea," Harry said, backing off to let Draco admit him to the property.
"Wait what?!"
"I'd be there."
Dean then cast a quick tempus, "Oh crap! We're going to be late if we don't get going soon! Sorry Harry, we'll talk later if you have anymore questions!"
"No idea," Harry responded, finally digging into his food. He could feel Draco's gaze on him.
"Not your hair, that's a special kind of disaster. Don't you own a comb?"
He had found that ignoring him didn't work very well through and could always feel Harry's eyes trained on him: in the hall, at meals, in class, in their own room even. Draco was slowly going mad. He was just waiting for Harry to strike and tell everyone about how much he seemed to enjoy the kiss (even though he didn't, he told himself), or even for Ron to tell everyone. God knows, Ron hates him. Draco had enough trouble already with being an ex-death eater and all, he didn't want to imagine what it'd be like if it got around that he was supposedly gay (even if it wasn't true, he reminded himself). If that got back to his parents, well, he had no idea what'd they'd do, but it wouldn't be pretty. Harry had managed to save him and his mother from Azkaban, and the wizengamot had miraculously let his father stay out of Azkaban under house arrest, which meant that his dad would definitely find out if it became common knowledge.
Draco's eyes seemed to be silver and his blonde hair was glowing in the light. Harry could feel himself leaning in before he could take a moment to think.
“Thought those went away?”
"I don't now, and I won't then. Just leave me the fuck alone, I'm sick of being a puppet," Draco said, turning to leave, "When my father hears, tell him I don't care about his little project either and he'll have to figure it out himself." With that Draco swept out of the classroom leaving a fuming Snape alone.
Harry laughed, “Want anything from here? I’ll buy it for you.”
November 3, 1998
Pansy watched the fire as it's light danced upon the walls and across Blaise's face. A long moment passed as she watched it, oddly calmed by it. It had been a while since she had been able to just relax in front of the fire and not be worried about something bigger than school work. The war had taken its toll on everyone and had taken so much from them that they'd never get back: family, friends, normalcy.
Harry had been trying to tell himself all night that he was just paranoid and that perhaps whoever he liked used the same shampoo. He tried to ignore the fact that it was definitely cologne. He was also trying not to pay attention to the important question of why he even knew what Draco's shampoo smelled like.
"It was good, missed you here though," Ron said, helping Hermione with her bag.
“Because it’s our last year?”
"It's the room with the door open in the Boys hall," Ron said, choosing to ignore Draco.
"Well since about fourth year," Dean replied and Ron choked on his food again, and Hermione pounded on his back.
"Yeah Harry, will you be okay?" Seamus said with a smirk and Dean snickered hiding his face with his hand and turning away slightly.
"Dunno, I think she caught a first year using a book as a coaster earlier today and took offence," Ron said back, laughing a bit.
Harry suddenly tilted his head and then moved his lips against Draco's. Draco's head was spinning oh merlin, he thought. Harry's lips were softer than he thought and he suddenly felt himself melting into Harry as they kissed.
Draco woke up again that night to find Harry shouting unintelligible things in his sleep. He didn't waste a moment getting up and shaking him awake.
"Have you finished all your homework yet?" Harry asked Draco, "I know you wanted to start on it."
"Alright."
"So do I, you were incredibly dense," Hermione laughed and spun the bottle with her free hand and it landed on Lavender. "Truth or dare?"
"We know how to get into the kitchens, so food wouldn't be a problem," Ron said, "We'll probably need help carrying it all though."
Harry reached up to place his hands on Draco's cheeks as he stared up at him. "I love you." Harry barely whispered it but Draco heard it loud and clear.
“Yeah,” he paused a moment as if thinking about something, before turning his face towards Harry, “if that’s alright?” He kept his voice low too and Harry decided to respond in the same tone.
"Oh har har."
Dean then let out a soft gasp and Harry turned around to find him covering his mouth.
Draco felt his face get hot, "Well it's not a date," he grumbled.
Ron decided to let it drop after that.
"You don't even know what he did to deserve it," Hermione said.
"Well, the only thing that Harry has been continuously obsessed with since first year has been Malfoy. And judging by what I've heard from you all, Malfoy seems to be in the same boat. I mean," Neville walked back over to the pot, blaise trailing behind him, and started watering the bubotuber, "Harry spent the whole of sixth year following Malfoy around school."
"You don't have to answer, your turn." Harry shot him a grateful look.
"Oh, and do tell Pomona thanks as well for me, you both work so hard," Mcgonagall said as Neville and Blaise reached the door.
"I suppose," Harry said. Draco could tell he didn't buy it, but maybe it eased his fears a bit at the least.
"Fantastic, Pomona said you'd be coming by, thank you very much Neville."
"Why not?" Harry flashed him a smile.
As soon as the door opened Hermione was throwing her arms around both Harry and Ron. "I missed you guys so much! How was your guys' Christmas?" she asked, letting go as Ron moved to let her inside.
"Well, not every single one," Draco explained, "Marriages are typically arranged, unless you pick well on your own. That means that I should be looking for potential matches at the balls, or my parents would pick for me. Though, as you know, I'm not particularly interested in women," both Harry and Draco blushed as they remembered their last time up at the top of the astronomy tower.
"Did something happen last night that I can't remember?" Harry asked.
"Both of you shut up or we're doing yours next, Draco." Draco gulped and shut his mouth. "Step three: ask to hang out with him outside of the project."
"You are. Why not just ask him out?"
“I got your letter,” Draco said when Harry found him waiting in front of the Room of Requirement. Harry looked down to see it clutched in his hands. “You said you wanted to talk to me?”
Ginny laughed, "Yeah, for a couple months now."
"Well-"
"You're staring again,'' Pansy said as she looked towards Draco who was currently staring down some girl who was apparently confessing to Potter.
"Oh no no no, I cannot do that," Blaise said, looking at the list slightly panicked.
"She apparently can, and now both of us are stuck playing 'friends' until the end of the school year," Harry sighed. Ron's muttering of how unfair the situation was faded into the background as Harry opened the door to the Great Hall and found himself automatically searching for blond hair. Harry almost immediately found Malfoy sitting at the Slytherin table, sat facing the Gryffindor table as he had for the last seven years.
"My father? Or the Dark Lord?"
After a week of awkward tension between Harry and Draco, Friday rolled around and with it came the weekly party. Draco started towards the alcohol as soon as he got into the room, and Harry eyed him from across the room.
"I don't want them to make a big deal out of it. Or for them to view me any different."
“If you two spend the rest of the day sending glances at each other as you have for the past two weeks, I’m going to tear my hair out,” Ron grumbled, watching the red bloom over Harry’s cheeks.
"I think Harry would like your hair styled messily."
"While there is no rule against it, this room is mine too and I don't want to be stuck with not only you," Draco shot a pointed glare at Harry, "but Granger and Weasel too."
He was at the table when Draco finally noticed him, practically jumping out of his skin as he took in Harry's form.
"Oh yeah, that sounds like Pansy," Draco flopped back onto the bed with a smile.
"See where the rock slopes toward the beach over there?"
"Good cause I wasn't going to let you say no," Draco returned Harry's smile as they made it back to the Gryffindor changing rooms.
Hermione raised her eyebrows at him, "Okay, I'll humor you. If you aren't stalking him because you think he's up to something, then why are you?"
"You always just immediately assume that I'm up to something!" Draco shouted, temper rising.
He let his fingers curl in Harry, pressing hard against Harry's prostate and let his thumb graze the spot between Harry's entrance and his groin.
"Hey! Can't you just let me enjoy it for once!" Ron said, well tried to say anyway. What came out was just a mumbled mess around the food, but Hermione still understood him.
"Shut up. Step two: flirt with him."
“Why?” Draco asked and Harry had no response.
"I can only imagine how shocked she was," Harry laughed, sinking to his knees, his body shaking with laughter.
"Three," they both said at once and then said the words that would unleash hell in the halls.
"I don't hate muggle things. And for the record, Pansy gave it to me and it's comfortable."
Not to mention, Potter is also a terrible roommate. He snores and is extremely self-involved and hogs the bathroom in the morning. He is a nightmare and I sincerely wish I had not come another year. I am certain I would have learned much more had I studied at home.
"Yeah, it shows where everyone is all the time," Harry said, eyes searching for Filch on the map, "if you think this is cool I also have an inv- Oh crap! He's coming back this way! Hurry, let's grab the stuff and get out of here." Harry snatched Ron's bag of things and then slammed the desk drawer shut, rushing out of the room after Draco.
"Of course! I wouldn't say it if I didn't think so. Even rusty, you're still great at the game, and after a few practices I'm sure you'll warm right up."
They all made their way out to the field after breakfast, Harry feeling slightly better but cursing the fact that he'd have to sit on a broom soon. It didn't help that Draco kept glancing over at Harry with concern in his eyes everytime he limped a bit.
Tryouts started well, that was until Blaise and Ron started fighting. Blaise wasn't even there to try out and was only there to watch the rest of the Slytherins who where, which seemed to infuriate Ron. Harry could see why Ron was angry with Blaise as he had spent the entirety of the tryouts so far cheering on Slytherins and booing everyone else, but he also knew that Blaise was just screwing around and trying to get under Ron's skin. Lately the tension between the two had been growing as Ron seemed to have gotten the idea in his head that Blaise was constantly around Neville because he was plotting something with Draco, and Blaise had simply seemed to make it his mission to keep Ron in a permanent state of anger. Both Harry and Hermione were honestly quite fed up with it.
"Great. Then on that note, I'm making changes to the punishment." Both Harry and Draco suddenly felt very hopeful. Maybe she'll let us stop hanging out. "From now on, you're not allowed to complete your punishment up in your room. Since you two can't control yourselves in private, I need others to keep an eye on you." Both boys groaned.
"Yeah, that's what I'm doing. The whole freaking room smells of you, and I bet you smell me too."
"I can't think of anything that would cause people to look like they're glowing to you in veratesirum..." Pomfrey said, writing something down on her clipboard. "I'll have to talk to Professor Snape and see if he can find what was wrong with the potion. For now, is the headache bad?"
"You're sure?"
"Are you planning to do anything for Christmas break?" Harry asked.
-----------------------------------------
"No way," Draco breathed.
"Yeah, it seems like it still follows us around though, huh?" Draco looked up and met Harry's eyes and Harry watched him glow just a tad bit brighter.
"I should probably go make sure he's up before he misses lunch and practice," Ron said, getting up, "Make sure they don't take my food away, I'm not done." With that he hurried off to the dorms to get Harry.
“Well, no, not really…”
"Yeah, it was pretty obvious, Harry," Hermione said and Ginny snickered.
"Man!" Ron said, cutting through Hermione's thoughts, "I can't believe that the first match is in less than three weeks. It's all going by so fast. Heck, Halloween is Saturday."
Draco found himself hiding out in the library with Pansy after classes had ended for the day, putting off having to go to the dormitories and having to spend that stupid hour with Potter.
Draco's head was pounding and the light from the window was assaulting his eyes. When he tried to sit up his stomach turned and he felt nauseous. He laid back down and then felt the bed shift.
"Well we're happy to have you," Hermione smiled.
"Yeah, but she said she would refuse to play any position other than Beater, something about how hitting the bludger around at people sounded fun," Hermione replied, laughing slightly.
"Yeah," Ron said around a mouth full of chicken, then he tried to continue but no one could understand with his mouth full.
"Me neither," Draco said, "it's weird not playing this year."
Hermione seemed to contemplate this for a second. "And you're sure you didn't mess up the potion at all?"
"You don't like hair and makeup?" Harry teased and Draco elbowed him lightly.
"No, she said she had to talk to Snape."
"In my opinion you should have started last month. Now, you're welcome to join us if you'd like. We're meeting at three, Draco can come too if he'd like," Hermione nodded at Draco and he gave a slight smile back. "On a whole other note, I found Ron with that," Hermione pointed to the marauder's map that was folded neatly on top of the notebook, "You really should have gotten rid of it. It could seriously be a liability if someone finds it."
"Yeah, I figured Ron and Hermione would like some time alone too."
"I'll go next," Harry said towards the end of the night. It was the last round and Harry had already kissed Luna, Pansy, Seamus and Lavender. The last one was something he never wanted to do again.
Normal friends don't sleep in the same bed together after a bad dream though, Ron would never sleep with me.
"The people my father worked for are dumb, but not that dumb," Draco murmured, he had turned back to his food and was staring absently down at his soup.
He tried to sit up in bed and ended up falling back with a groan when a sharp pain shot up his abdomen. Right, Potter sliced me open.
"Do you-" Harry paused, gathering up the courage, "do you want to go to Hogsmeade with me today? I want to talk."
Hermione smiled widely at him, "I'm glad you're not angry."
"Have you tried product?" Draco asked, his long fingers messing with the comforter, drawing Harry's attention.
Harry's eyes suddenly lit up and Draco felt mildly worried. "Are you saying you've played pranks before?"
"You should've taken them off then and come in. They'll dry anyway," Harry laughed, and splashed into the water next to Draco who glowered at him.
"No problem," Harry said, feeling his heart speed up stupidly. "What were they doing today?" Harry asked, trying to joke a bit, and Draco colored rapidly.
He absently searched for his name and his eyes trailed over to Draco's name. Oh so close to his. Harry was reminded of all the time he had spent watching Draco's name move over the parchment in sixth year and the couple times his eyes had sought out Draco's name during the time he spent searching for horcruxes. Wondering why he hadn't realized sooner that he liked Draco, he set the parchment down on his bed.
But he's always super nice to you, he argued with himself.
Draco could feel sweat forming on the back of his neck, despite the cold air. "Not sure. I suppose someone could have accidentally spilled amortentia into the potion and doesn't want to get in trouble, so they don't come forward." He knew Harry wasn't gullible enough to believe that, but he could hope. Maybe if he could get Harry to think that, he could get the rest of the staff to believe it too, then Pansy could get off scot free and they could put it all behind them.
Ron's head seemed to pound and he sat back with a groan., maybe he should lay off the alcohol for the rest of the night.
Draco's kissing me.
"You're spying on me now?"
"We're friends now, you can call me Draco."
"Do you think you could dye my hair?"
"Yeah, um, we agreed to call each other by our first names."
"What was that about?" Draco asked as Harry closed the door behind himself.
"I can't believe the first quidditch match is less than a month away," Harry said, halfway through his lunch.
"Apparently so," Draco said, "I got the blankets though, just need the pillows now."
I'd definitely like to see the garden someday, and I'd imagine Neville would like it too. I'd also like to meet you in Diagon Alley too, we'll have to set a day.
Draco glowed brighter than usual, but squeezed Harry's hand back. "I'm okay, don't worry. Though, the colors are a bit crazy," Harry chucked a bit, not letting Draco's hand go. Draco didn't make any move to drop his either.
The room was silent, the only sound being Lucius flipping through the pages of the daily profit. Narcissa kept her eyes on her own plate as she ate her own food slowly.
"Oh I'm sure," Harry smiled.
"Feels like someone let loose a hippogryph in my head," Draco groaned.
"Draco~"
But they wouldn't just go away, Draco realized as he laid in bed a few nights later, watching Harry read out of the corner of his eye.
"It's alright."
"Like what?"
Harry rolled his eyes, pushing Draco off him, who fell backwards still laughing. "You're too tired, you're getting loopy," he paused, letting Draco catch his breath, "just do it."
"Oh come on Malfoy you can't really want to continue like this,"
Harry made his way down the moving stairs and the hallways, all the way to the picture of a bowl of fruit that hid the entry to the kitchens. Harry tickled the pear and watched as the painting swung open.
Draco woke up in one of the stiff hospital beds. The white ceiling was blinding and he shifted his head to look at where Madam Pomfrey was fussing over another student in the corner.
Pansy came up to the bathroom door then after a few minutes sitting, smirking, on Blaise's bed. Draco hadn't told them he had a date but Pansy had noticed something was up, regardless.
"You're not. You took care of me when I had that nightmare." Draco suddenly remembered the way Harry looked that night - tears running down his face and moving about on the bed - he wanted to reach out to grab his hand, but stopped himself at the last second. "It's the least I could do," Harry finished.
Draco and Harry had been arguing over what they were going to do for their punishment for the day and Harry had suggested they go into the Forbidden Forest.
"Alright," Draco said, not even looking up from his own.
"We should be getting going too," Hermione said as everyone else seemed to agree and get up as well.
"Thanks," Draco mumbled.
---------------------------------------------
When they both made it back to the castle they had just enough time to wash up and change for dinner.
"Yeah, the first one is today remember?"
"Glad to be of service," Draco rolled his eyes as he turned to head up the stairs.
Ron's mouth dropped, Luna looked like this was old news, and Hermione gave them a wide smile. "I'm so happy for you guys!" she said as Ron choked on his food. "Oh cut it out Ron," Hermione shot a look at her boyfriend who looked shell-shocked.
Morning came too fast and with it brought headaches to all who attended the party the night before. Pansy gave her special concoction that got rid of hangovers to Draco, Blaise, and Hermione. Dean and Seamus seemed to have something that got rid of hangovers too as neither seemed to be affected by the copious amounts of alcohol they drank the night before.
--------------------------
"The cutest," Harry said and before Draco could retort he captured his lips again in a light kiss. Harry tilted his head just slightly and Draco's head spun. Harry's hands were in Draco's hair and Draco was asking himself why he waited so long to try this.
"You can't just nominate yourself, that's an abuse of power," Hermione said, rolling her eyes at Ron.
When they came back down, Dean was waiting eagerly by the board.
"Malfoy?" George asked, pulling a face of disgust, "Why would you like that git? He was a prat to all three of you when you guys were younger."
Harry turned as he heard his name and was greeted with Ginny running up behind him, slightly out of breath.
Harry wasn't dumb though, "but why would a student have amortentia in the first place?"
Harry was suddenly quite nervous, last time he had initiated the kiss and at that time he also wasn't sure if he liked Draco. This time though, he was sure he did and kissing Draco without him knowing that he liked him felt a bit like lying. It's just a dare though, he reminded himself.
It slowly came back to him then.
"Nothing happened," Draco said, making his way towards his bed, "I'm fine."
"Sure, why not?" Harry asked, head tilting to the side and the next thing Draco knew he was standing in their bathroom watching as Harry took off his shirt.
"Thanks," Ginny smiled
"Harry'll be here soon," Seamus said with a bit of a sly grin.
Draco and Harry had gone into three shops already and Harry was getting tired.
"You can cook?" Draco asked, suddenly very interested.
"I would if it didn't affect my enjoyment too!"
Draco's hands wandered up to Harry's chest and brushed against his nipples and Draco could feel him shudder under his touch as he moaned into Draco's mouth. Harry moved his leg gingerly up to rub against Draco's with his thigh. Draco groaned as Harry's noises and leg sent a shock straight down to his groin.
Draco looked to where the two were furiously kissing and his eyes widened as he started to realize what might be happening with the potion. He prayed he was wrong.
"Oh that's right! How's the project been going then?" Hermione said and they began to talk about herbology, which got Ron and Harry completely lost.
"Well," Harry looked for someone to point out, "That waiter over there behind the bar area is green, and the two women in the corner over there are pink." Draco gazed at the people Harry pointed out. Trying to figure out if there was a pattern in the people who glowed the most versus those who didn't.
Hermione nodded at Ginny, a go-ahead kind of motion and Ginny finally looked around at them.
"Hey, I had a free period so I thought I'd come out a bit early with Seamus to get ready. Seamus is already up in the stands though," Dean said. Harry took in Dean's flushed and rumpled appearance and could guess what 'getting ready' had meant. Harry let out a soft chuckle and set his bag down, starting to change.
"Five! Four! Three! Two! One!" George set off the fireworks all at once and everyone took a sip of their drinks.
"Oh nothing, don't worry about it. Just normal Pansy and Blaise stuff," Draco said, ducking his head down to hide his flush. Ron and Hermione stared at the display awkwardly across the table until Dean and Seamus seemed to come out of nowhere, plopping down next to Hermione.
"That's two questions, it's my turn golden boy."
Ron's jaw dropped as he watched them furiously kissing from across the room, both refusing to back down from the challenge. Most everyone had pulled back before 30 seconds had passed, but both Draco and Harry didn't seem to be backing down as the minute mark hit. Pansy was simply smirking over at them and Blaise was muttering something that sounded faintly like, and he said he wasn't gay.
"What if I just don't want to be friends with you?"
"Well what would be the point of a party without alcohol. Anyway, will you come?"
"Sorry 'bout that," Harry said apologetically, "didn't mean to ditch you."
Potions was awkward as Harry and Draco were partnered up. They only talked to each other when they absolutely had to. People were starting to notice by mid day and rumors were traveling around the school. Everything from Draco cursing Harry mute to people saying Draco had tried to kill Harry. The last one made Harry angry when he'd heard it.
"I don't care what they want," Draco said, crossing his arms over his chest.
"No, it's okay. I broke up with her originally before I left to go hunting for horcruxes but when I got back I just never tried to get back together with her. I feel kind of bad for not even talking to her about though." Harry watched Draco's face as he talked and loved the way he looked so focused on his words, he really liked this side of Draco.
"Let's go mate," Harry said, placing a hand on his arm.
"Like what?"
“I also don’t get why you insisted so much to help me get ready. It’s just dinner.”
"Can we talk about anything else?" Harry interrupted, deciding that he didn't much like the way his heart was pounding in his chest, and what exactly that might mean.
"Oh you know, just a few minor reasons. Like, I don't know, I don't want to die."
"It's a practice snitch," Draco responded, almost like he read Harry's mind. "It won't move until you press this." He turned the snitch over and pointed out a small button on the snitch, "You can set it not to leave a certain area, that way you won't lose it."
He watched as her eyes grew wider as she no doubt remembered what she had admitted to the night before, "Draco I didn't think-"
Harry looked over at Draco with a smile, "Yeah alright, that doesn't sound so bad."
Draco felt a rush of power at knowing he was the one reducing Harry Potter into the mess before him. It was oddly nice and made him feel wanted in a way he hadn't really ever felt before.
A few more points scored by Slytherin, and Draco was smirking at Harry. He wasn't worried though, there was plenty of time for Gryffindor to rebound.
Draco had fallen off the bed in surprise at their position and Harry stared at him over the side of the bed and Draco stared back wide-eyed and stuttering.
Harry gave him a smile before heading up the stairs.
"Nope, not a single person."
"I hadn't really thought that far," Harry rubbed the back of his neck nervously, "figured you'd have an idea."
"Do you want me to stop?" Draco asked and Harry quickly shook his head, "Alright, then I want to."
"And it looks like Cooper has caught sight of the snitch! -- Harper seems to have located the Snitch as well -- Demelza Robins scores, ten points to Gryffindor -- Harper runs into Cooper, she's thrown off course -- oh wait, she caught up to Harper again -- Cooper caught the snitch! 150 points to Gryffindor -- Gryffindor wins, 240 to 110!" the ravenclaw's voice boomed over the pitch.
Hermione eyed them before realizing he was never going to continue what he was saying without prompting, "What did they find out, Harry," Hermione said, finally gaining Harry's attention back.
An hour later and Pansy was slurring her words and complaining that she hadn't gotten to kiss anyone yet.
"Only? Tomorrow is November which means winter break is less than two months away. Plus, I thought you know your holiday plans months in advance. Don't you Malfoys through huge Christmas parties or something in that huge manner of yours? With all your other rich pure-blood families?" Harry teased.
"I don't mind. I know we both have a lot of homework."
"You do realize that your house is Gryffindor and that everyone on that team is younger than both of you? It won't exactly be a fair match, plus I heard they have second years," Hermione laughed a bit at Ron's put-out expression. "I'll still be there though," Hermione finally said, and a smile broke out across Ron's face. Hermione turned back to her book, a small smile crossing her lips.
"Glowing?" Hermione stared at him shocked for a second.
"Of course," Harry said with a smile.
"Nah, I don't think so," Blaise said, "In my opinion it was perfectly justified. You two are practically hanging off each other, you might as well have already been dating."
Blaise turned a bit pink from the admission and avoided eye contact with Neville as he resoutly stared at the ground in front of him.
“Yeah.”
The kiss lasted no more than a couple seconds and it was more like a friendly peck than anything else. Hermione picked the bottle up next and looked awkwardly over at Ginny before giving her a kiss just a quick as Seamus and her had done.
Pansy smiled over at Hermione and she smiled back.
Draco let out a groan as he leaned up to stare at Harry. "What-?"
"Harry," Draco shook Harry awake a little more violently than he probably needed to, but he was currently shaking a bit in a panic and needed Harry awake now.
"Yeah, of course! I was going to invite you to go with Ron, Hermione, and I but they're going on a date," Harry laughed a bit, "so I was thinking I could go with just you so they could have some space."
"Still you. Normal people don't talk to their beds."
-----------------------------------------------
"He's probably just a closet case," Blaise said and Pansy burst out laughing like it was the funniest thing ever.
"Alright, and what are we gonna do here?"
A knock on the door is what finally pulled them apart and Harry got up to stumble over to the door sleepily. Hermione was standing outside the room when Harry opened the door and she handed over a notebook and piece of paper.
"Yeah? And try and explain why I need them? No way in hell. I'd rather just suffer," Harry groaned, raking his fingers through his hair, "My ass is going to hurt so bad sitting on that broom."
Harry woke up about an hour later to a loud thud.
"Yeah, we have the line up ready, I just forgot to put it up I guess (So did the author lol)," Harry laughed.
"Do I make myself clear?" McGonagall repeated firmly, making it clear that there was no arguing and that they would be forever doomed with the task of hanging out.
Harry figured that at this point, even if Draco never liked him back, he'd be content if they could just remain friends.
Good luck with your parents, remember I'm here if you need and if it goes too horribly you can always come here no matter what. Not to worry you, but be safe okay?
"You're perfectly smart if you'd actually apply yourself."
Harry wanted to kiss him again. Very badly.
---------------------------
He tried to keep his head down the entire way to his table, barely hearing Draco's "see you later," as he headed towards the Slytherin table.
"What are the odds of you..." Ron asked Draco, trailing off as he thought. Then, a horrible smirk spread across his lips, "addressing me as Sir for the next week."
Draco opened his eyes again to find it much darker than it was before. "Much, thanks."
"Yeah," Harry said.
When he returned to his room he pulled out the nice pair of deep-blue jeans and a white shirt. He pulled on a zip-up hoodie over the shirt.
"Thanks," Harry gave Draco a shy smile that made Draco's stomach flip and his mouth go dry. Draco managed a nod and took the vial back, crossing the room back to his bedside table and placing the vial on it. The air was thick with awkward tension and Draco took his time putting the vial away as Harry stared at his back.
I wish I could be there too, not that I'd particularly enjoy being surrounded by 11 Weasley's for break, but for you. It's nice here, but I still miss seeing you every day. I think you'd enjoy the manor, or at least parts of it, one day maybe you can pay a visit here. I know there are parts of it that probably hold bad memories, but there's a lot more here too. Like I mentioned before, the gardens are very pretty. We have a greenhouse, which is where I read with my mother, that's full of different plants from all over the world. I recon Longbottom would enjoy it. We also have many acres around the house that we could fly on, no muggle would be able to see us.
The hour of punishment had ended a while ago but both boys had gotten too into the game to stop.
"How daft do you think I am? Who is it? Hmmm?" Draco leaned closer to him and Harry scooted closer to the headboard.
"I suppose."
A large Eagle Owl flew in as soon as he opened the window and he felt his heart skip a beat. He reached out and grabbed the letter and gave the owl a treat and hurried it back out the window before Ron could see the owl. The owl hooted angrily at him, but flew off to wait in a tree just outside the window for his response anyway.
At the beginning of the school year when Draco had come to apologize to Harry and they became friends, it had been beyond awkward between Harry and his friends when he'd hang out with Draco. Draco had apologized to Ron and Hermione of course, and while they'd accepted his apology (though that took a while), they hadn't really gotten used to him being around Harry.
"What do you mean?" Neville said, confusion written on his face.
Harry smiled at him and Draco smiled back.
"Yes. It better be good though and I want to pull one on Filch."
Draco laughed at this and then the server appeared with their drinks. She made a funny look at them and then swept off. Draco felt slightly uncomfortable by the look, but Harry didn't seem to notice it.
"I might, depends who they get to play."
"Don't mention it. You might want to get up soon though, or you'll be late for classes."
"Wish Draco was here?" Ginny asked him, just loud enough to hear over the fireworks overhead.
"Don't worry, I'm not. I just came to try and apologize and give an explanation," Harry said looking towards her, and suddenly growing worried about what he was planning on saying next.
"Draco," Pansy said without hesitation and when the coin landed on tails, Pansy turned to Draco and he suddenly felt more nervous than ever because he knew he wouldn't be able to lie.
Suddenly he felt like he was being watched and swept his eyes over the room to find both Harry and Draco looking at them from across the room. Neville gave a small laugh and Blaise looked up from his drink.
"Oh Ginny just came to say hi," Ron said, not sure if Ginny wanted everyone to know yet or not.
"He's not going to hurt me," Harry insisted.
"No, not anymore."
“I don’t want to go home just yet,” Harry said as they made their way out of the restaurant, “would you like to walk through the park for a bit? It’s a nice night.”
The waitress had a bubbly personality and took their order with a smile and minimal looks at Draco. Their friendship wasn’t exactly secret information as the Daily Prophet had caught wind of it back at the beginning of the school year and had done a special on it. Draco and him had laughed about it and then promptly threw it away. Harry supposed the Prophet would be doing a special on their relationship again as soon as they caught wind that they were now dating.
Harry,
"I show emotion."
"No problem, I'll come grab you when I'm done with it," she said with a smile, slipping around him to continue down the aisle, "I've got to get some homework now tho, so I'll see you around."
"No, not that, I mean- they're dating? Since when?" Harry asked, surprise written all over his face.
He let out a sigh as he took in his hair. He didn't always sleek it back anymore and had recently let it hang a bit loose around his head. Would he like it better if I styled it? Draco asked as he ran his hands through the slightly damp strands, or should I leave it?
"It's not alright, I did that to you," Harry was pulling away now and Draco reached out to grab onto Harry's arms.
"Yeah, sure," Harry readily agreed. "Let me just put my bag down upstairs and we can head down to the pitch."
"Never have I ever gotten detention," Lavender said. She hadn't gone to the last few and most were just fine with that, and where kind of bummed that she decided to show up again.
His homework was still sitting open on his bed and he decided he should probably work on it before Draco got out.
“I know,” he groaned, flopping forward, “I just don’t know what to do, he just keeps avoiding me.”
"Write me?" Harry asked after a bit.
Draco watched him curiously and was about to ask what his idea was when he realized that they'd made it to their usual spot and Harry was dropping his hand to set his stuff down.
Harry flopped back down on his bed to read the letter, pulling out parchment and a quill to write back.
The three adults seemed to take a moment to let the information sink in, until Pomfrey finally spoke up, "Since we're still not sure what the potion will do, I think it's best to just monitor you for a while until we know more."
"You're in love with someone now? Or just dizzy?" Ron said, this time with his mouth empty. Harry absentmindedly listened to his conversation as his head was spinning. It means I'm in love? No, of course not, it's just Luna's made up creatures again.
“You’re being so rough about it!” Draco complained as Harry stepped on him once again, “Don’t be so violent about it, it’s supposed to be graceful. You’re dancing, not fighting someone.”
"What are you looking at?" Harry said and turned around to see what Draco was looking at. Harry gasped when he saw Blaise and Neville and whipped his head back around to look at Draco. "What are they doing?"
Harry turned a bit pink around the ears as he watched them shoving each other on the other side of the circle. He knew that Draco complained about him, sure, but he didn't realize just how much until then.
"Yes," Neville mumbled, deciding to just answer. What harm could that do? It's not like she could know who it was from that. Granted there weren't that many people in the circle, but still enough to not immediately guess it.
"Fine, let's go then," Ron said, turning around and walking away, Hermione shooting Harry a sympathetic look and trailing after him.
Draco reached his hand out to brush his fingers over Harry's comfortingly, "I'm sure it'll work out."
"No, singing in the shower is undignified," Draco said, sticking his nose up into the air as Harry laughed, the sound made him smile. "Are you still dating the weaslette?"
"Yeah, that would make a lot more sense actually," Harry said, leaning back against his bed frame and looking over at Draco who was laying on his back with his legs hanging over the side. Harry shook his head telling himself that he needs to stop staring at Draco.
Draco just nodded, turning his head away to hide the flush of his cheeks. Once Harry put the scarf on and cast a warming charm he found Draco's hand, entwining their fingers together, their robes big enough to cover their hands. Harry gave Draco's hand a light squeeze and he returned the gesture.
"You're jealous."
"Is that all?" Harry asked.
"The first Quidditch match is today," Harry said, pushing Draco's hair out of his face gently. Draco didn't open his eyes, only humming in response. "Gryffindor vs. Slytherin. You're going to it right?"
They'd started hanging out in the evenings. Harry and Draco.
He felt more comfortable with Draco than he did anyone else, and he felt himself sigh in contentment, leaning his head down on top of Draco's. He could hear the wind whistling through the trees of the forbidden forest and felt the cool breeze on his face. It was the most relaxed Harry had been in a while. He was almost asleep when Draco moved off of where he was leaning against Harry to sit up.
"No, well I'm not sure I suppose. I've only seen three colors, but I suppose there could be more..." Harry looked over at Draco who was seated next to him. "Draco's red, so are you two and Pomfrey is light blue. When I came into the common room I think I saw someone who was pink, but I don't really know who it was."
"I won't," Luna said and reached out to grab Ginny's hand.
"What's wrong?" Draco asked after a few minutes, feeling slightly self conscious, Harry had been practically staring at him since they left.
Harry woke up with a groan and a splitting headache. The sunlight coming in through the windows seemed very bright to his eyes and he fell back into his pillow with another groan. Suddenly he felt another presence and he turned his head and squinted up at the boy who was now standing beside his bed holding out a small vial.
"Well they're invisible creatures that fly around your head. They usually mean you're dizzy or in love," Luna replied dreamily.
"Too noisy down there to study," Draco said, watching Harry as he walked over to Draco's bed.
"Well it's a muggle game where-"
"I did this," Harry practically whispered, reaching out and trailing his fingertips over the scars lightly. Draco felt a shiver go down his spine.
"First, keep it down we're in the library and someone is bound to hear, with you talking so loudly. Second, I should be angry, not thanking you! All you did was make it awkward!" Draco hissed.
A smile broke out across Luna's face, "Sure."
"I'm right aren't I?" Harry laughed, "That's the face you make when you know I'm right!"
"We're dating, Luna and I," Ginny said, suddenly confident after Ron's acceptance.
"You ever wonder if one of the bats ever attacked a student?" Hermione wondered aloud as she took a bite of her dinner. "I mean, letting live bats just fly around the great hall can't be very safe can it?"
"If you say so," Draco said with a smirk, but he honestly didn't care, as long as Harry was there he didn't care where they went.
Hermione let out a laugh, "Well you aren't as far as I know. Lavender definitely isn't either."
"People? Yeah. It shows everyone in the castle at all times. It doesn't even have a delay. There's also secret passageways. The only room that I know of that isn't on here is the room of requirement. But I suppose that could be because it's impossible to plot."
Hermione was about to put the cup to her lips when Ron said, "Wait, when did you have detention?"
Draco let his hand travel to the mess that was Harry's hair. It was slightly damp from sweat, but he enjoyed it anyway. Draco was still getting used to the fact that Harry was dating him, of all people, the novelty of it all still gone away.
Harry thought Draco was starting to wake when he felt him stir, but all he did was curl further into Harry's chest. Harry could feel Draco's breath coast against his collarbone and he suddenly felt very hot. He shook him lightly to wake him up, partly because they were going to be very late, and partly because if Draco stayed in that position against him much longer he might go insane.
"What exactly are you doing?" Blaise groaned, sitting up in bed and rubbing his eyes.
Ron shrugged, "Came in to get you for breakfast but you weren't even up."
"Hey!"
Just as Harry suspected, no one was in the room and they sat down on the nice couch right in front of the fire, Harry pulling out his transfiguration homework and Draco pulling out a book.
Harry and Draco looked at each other for a moment and a sudden urge to kiss Draco passed through him. He was just about to lean over the table when he heard someone clear their throat.
This is bad, he thought, feeling his body grow warmer as he watched the way Draco's muscles flexed as he struggled with his shirt.
"We can just go grab a ton from the dining hall, it's almost lunch."
Nothing could compare to the person beside him though. Harry looked to the right, where Draco had been next to him for the last hour. After he'd made sure Pansy was going to pace herself, he'd glued himself to Harry's side as Ron and Hermione had gone off to dance.
"Much."
Harry looked over at Ron, he figured he'd have to tell them eventually. He might as well do it now and get it over with he supposed. He sucked in a breath, "I'm dating Draco, Draco Malfoy."
3. Originally I wanted Ron to be completely oblivious to Draco and Harry, but I ended up thinking it’d be funnier if Ron kept ending up seeing things he didn’t mean to and then not saying anything about it, and of course Harry wouldn’t say anything either because he thought Ron was oblivious.
"Looks like I got the short end of the stick then," Ron grumbled, "Hermione got Parkinson who she seems to get on with just fine, and you get the quiet one. I got the annoying one."
“This is sad, even for him though,” Blaise said.
"Sounded like you meant them, Malfoy," Harry said, he knew Draco hadn't meant it but he was still hurt.
"No," Draco said, but the answer was just a tad too quick.
"I'm not being mean. That's just a fact." Harry sighed and Draco continued, "Not to mention, my fathers in Azkaban and my mother never was as strict about who I associate with as my father."
Sorry for my long absence!
"Thanks mate."
"Your neck..." Dean let out a snicker as Harry raised his hand to his neck.
"Thank Merlin for that, I'd definitely have left if you did that."
When they reached the entry to the little cove Harry stuck out his arm, "After you."
"Raine Anderson," McGonagall called from the front of the room where she was holding a piece of parchment and standing next to a stool with an old hat on it.
The conversation eventually shifted from Harry though and quickly turned to the food that littered the table and the decorations that never failed to impress.
"Yes," Draco responded and turned to walk up the stairs without saying another word.
"Oh! And the colors could correspond to how much you admire someone!" Ron chimed in.
"Draco, I'm not asking for much here. I just want you to be honest at least," Harry said and Draco finally turned to look at him. Harry could see the fear lurking in his eyes, but he pressed on, "I like you. A lot. I don't want to pressure you, and if you really don't want to I'll back off, but I wanted to ask you out. On a date."
"Just enjoy it, Draco," Harry laughed, reaching up to massage the soap into Draco's scalp. Draco slumped back into Harry with a soft sigh and closed his eyes, allowing himself to relish in the feeling of Harry's hands on him.
"That's fine, I don't mind," Blaise replied and then pressed his lips to Neville's before he could chicken out.
Draco turned pink at the ears, "Good thing we are then," Draco said, but he couldn't manage to say it with enough conviction that Harry would believe him.
While everyone was playing fairly well though, many were distracted.
"Mmmhmm, and that's why you carried back several bags every Hogsmeade weekend for the last several years here?"
"So you're not going to marry for status anymore?"
Firstly, how could he just kiss him so easily? Maybe it was different in the wizarding world, but if you did that in the muggle world and you weren't 100% sure the other person was gay you were at least guaranteed a punch in the face, and that was probably getting off easy.
"Fine, I guess I'll play but I get to ask first." Draco suddenly realized that this game might actually be a good idea as there were millions of questions that he wanted answers to. Like why he wanted a truce to begin with. Why he was being nice to him. Why he testified at his trial, he understood him testifying at his mothers, but his? No clue. He also wanted to know if he liked guys. Not for him of course, but so he could shut Pansy up.
"What was step three and four again?" Draco asked, he was laying sideways on the bed and had his head hanging over the side, his hair hanging down.
"You want to take a bath?" Draco looked incredulous, confusion taking over his features.
"It's a strong contributing factor," Harry laughed, watching Draco's eyes trail over the paper, trying to pick out names of people he knew.
"Shut up!" Harry groaned, pulling his pillow over his head when suddenly Draco flopped onto him.
Harry threw on his own pants and a sweatshirt before leading the way down to the kitchen to get started on breakfast. Harry always made the breakfast since the last time Draco tried he almost caught the entire kitchen on fire.
Harry suddenly reached across the table and grabbed onto Draco's hands, stopping them from continuing to worry the table. Draco startled a bit, but didn't make a move to pull away. "It's not your fault, you didn't have a choice."
"He always eats with his mouth open and is up at the ass crack of dawn every other day looking for random things he lost," Blaise said and then shoved his head into his folded arms. Neville put a comforting hand on Blaise's shoulder and Blaise felt butterflies in his stomach.
"Don't worry," he assured Hermione, "I wasn't planning on doing that anyway. I'll probably end up just going alone."
Harry crawled up to meet Draco in a soft kiss after refusing to let them return to making the fort before returning the gesture. They'd ended up on top of the pile of pillows and now Harry and Draco were laying on them trying to control their breathing.
The walk to Hogsmeade was cold and they were both shivering even with heating charms when they made it to the three broomsticks.
"I know. Your mom would never stop loving and doting on any of you, for anything."
"Well, when I was younger I wanted to go into the auror program but I don't think I want to do that anymore. I was actually thinking about being a healer or a teacher. I'd really love to teach Defense against the Dark arts. What about you?"
------------------------
"No. I don't like him, quit with it."
The day of the Quidditch match between Slytherin and Gryffindor had finally come and Harry and Draco had been teasing each other about who was the better team for the past few hours and it was starting to grate on everyone's nerves.
"It is Hermione, you should see him at night. He just lays there in bed staring at the ceiling. He's whipped and at night, he mutters in his sleep about how wonderful this person is."
"Wait, Pansy's interested?" Draco said, sitting up and giving Hermione a dumbfounded look.
Draco reached down grabbing both to rub them together. Draco's eyes traveled up to Harry's face to find his eyebrows knitted together in pleasure and small moans and pants coming from his mouth. Draco leaned down, kissing him, pulling away a little too soon, but leaning down to his erection and running his tongue from the base to the tip. Harry let out a shuddering breath at the feeling of Draco's tongue in such an intimate place and then moaned as Draco dipped his head down to take in his entire length. Harry's hands entangled themselves in Draco's hair as Draco hollowed his cheeks and oh god he was sucking. Harry made a completely new sound then, all rational thought leaving his mind as his knees went a little weak.
He obviously wouldn't like me back, he's only ever kissed me in the games and he is always drunk.
"Not really, just kinda a dull ache."
"Hey, didn't realize you were in here too. You should've come sit with me, or called me over," Draco said with a smile and Harry could practically hear his heartbeat. He wondered if it was as audible to Draco as it was to him.
"Not really," Draco said, trying to put some excitement back in his voice, he felt disappointed that Harry had only been meaning to go with him alone because Hermione and Ron were busy.
Harry smiled into Draco's shoulder.
"He must have already left, he wasn't here when I came in." Harry looked over at Malfoy's bed which was positioned against the opposite wall. Sure enough, it was empty and freshly made; Harry couldn't help feeling a pang of disappointment though he couldn't place why as he certainly didn't need to be spending any more time with Malfoy.
"Uh huh," Draco said, disbelieving. But before he could say more, Harry cut him off.
This chapter contains slight smut, it doesn't get very explicit and once you reach the "---------" it ends. So, when it gets uncomfortable for you, just skip to the part where there's a line (---------).
Friday rolled around again and with it came the weekly party the eighth years had begun doing. Everyone was already in a circle when Draco made it down the stairs from his and Harry's shared room.
"I don't like him, Pansy," Draco growled back and shot her a glare.
Draco stared at Harry for a moment, nerves flooding him and making his mind a bit fuzzy. "I don't know what to do," he admitted nervously, his face coloring slightly.
Draco turned away with a heavy blush as he realized what that meant: he was glowing red and probably very brightly at that. Harry knew he was in love with him. Well, he knew that Harry was aware he liked him at the very least, but now he knew that those feelings went well beyond a simple crush. Draco wanted to disappear.
"Of course."
"I won't kiss him if he doesn't want me to," Blaise announced, getting ready to pick up the bottle of firewhiskey if Neville said no.
The second they got back to the common room they immediately split up, and Harry walked over To Ron and Hermione who were talking quietly in the corner with Dean and Seamus.
"Alright thanks guys!" Harry said as they turned to jog to their first period.
Hermione looked over to Harry wondering if he realized just how awkward the situation felt, only to find Harry dumbly staring at Draco as he mumbled thanks.
He pointedly focused all his attention on the lesson and began furiously writing notes, earning a questioning look from Pansy that he chose to ignore as well.
Harry blushed to his roots and glared back at him. Draco held out his hand wordlessly for Harry to use the spell for lube again and he complied. Draco moved to coat his length in lube as Harry laid back on the pillows behind him.
His brain was spinning a mile a minute but he was able to pull two coherent thoughts together long enough to push Draco off himself.
Draco had watched as Harry rushed over to his friends across the street and he couldn't help but feel a bit hollow. He'd been hoping to spend more time with him, and hadn't realized how fast the time had gone.
"Well of course, but how did you get Malfoy to let you in?"
Harry pulled it around himself, enjoying the scent of Draco's cologne, "So you do care about me."
"Two."
"Calling it an anniversary makes it sound like a good thing though," Hermione said, and Ron groaned.
“Do you want me to sit with you at dinner?” Draco said, teasingly.
Neville let out a laugh that caused Blaise to feel a bit better at least, "What'd he do this time then?"
Ginny laced her fingers together on her lap and stared down at them for a moment before gathering her courage and looking up. Ron was giving her a worried look.
"What did you think I was planning? That was kinda the point you know." Draco pressed his fingers to Harry's mouth meaningfully and Harry seemed to understand as he opened his mouth and wetted his fingers. Draco took more time than what was probably strictly necessary, but he had a hard time making him stop.
"I want to do something," Harry groaned, tilting his head to watch Draco in the light streaming through the window. Harry didn't think he'd ever get used to the sight. He was also glad that Draco had chosen that bed because when the light came through the window by his bed, it reflected off his pale hair and made his hair look gold in the sun. His long eyelashes seemed to glow and Harry often lost himself looking at the way they fluttered lazily as Draco read.
Harry had no plans to go around asking random girls, though, and for some reason the idea of bringing a date just didn't sit well with him.
-----------------------------
"I'm going home to see my parents as they're both under probation and restricted to the house. Which doesn't really seem like much of a punishment to me as the manor is pretty big, but whatever. Blaise is going home too," Draco said over the racket Blaise and Pansy were making, gently scooting his plate away from them.
"You can say that again," Draco said, taking a huge bite of his own sandwich.
“Yeah, but you’re two hours early.”
"Experimentation?"
"Still felt too long to me," Pansy said, swinging her arms at her sides as they made it up the hill.
The next few days were spent in the same routine of Draco hiding out in the library, until Harry came to retrieve him just before curfew. Then they'd retreat back to their common room to work on homework together until bed. It wasn't a horrible arrangement as they weren't required to talk, except for the fact that everyone else did.
"Firstly, you mean when Slytherin wins against Gryffindor. Secondly, I'll help you get the stuff back only cause I'm bored and promised you I would help."
"I mean I don't like him much either, but what is the reasoning behind this?"
Harry woke up on Saturday with the sun glaring into his eyes. Groaning he tried to turn over, only to realize he couldn't.
"Yeah, think you could do it?"
Harry looked over to where Hermione was paying for a chocolate frog. "Yeah, thanks mate," he said, quickly getting out some money to pay for a few chocolate frogs.
"Well whatever, I like it. What's your favorite color then?"
---------------------------------------
"You are after that comment," Harry complained, but didn't make a move to grab it.
Harry watched them fondly.
"If they're coming, no alcohol. They're underage," Hermione said, crossing her arms.
"Yeah, I'm sure it will, but it's a pain in the meantime," Harry said and Ron and Hermione laughed a bit.
"So, you wouldn't like it if I did this?" and Draco kissed him, full on the mouth and Harry made a sound between a groan and a gasp, too shocked to move as he pulled away with the same stupid smirk on his face that makes Harry's heart pound - though he'd never admit it.
"Thanks." There was a pause as Draco started to read again.
When the shower turned on, Harry walked over to his bedside table and picked up the framed picture he had of his parents and the rest of the order. He smiled ruefully down at the image, he wondered what his parents would have thought about him liking Draco. Same-sex relationships weren't exactly widely accepted. Granted, they weren't illegal and could get married (unlike muggles), but many still didn't approve. Dean and Seamus had already gotten several disapproving looks since coming out as a couple, but they mostly just took it all with a grain of salt. He hoped that his parents would have been happy for him.
It's your own fault, he told himself.
When they reached Draco's room, he yanked Harry in, closing the door behind himself.
"Not helping," Ron said, but couldn't help cracking a small smile.
"Better?" Draco asked, watching as Harry took a deep breath of the cold October air.
Draco gave Harry a slight smirk, "You make it sound sexual."
Draco squinted at where Harry was pointing. There was a bit of a rock formation that did seem to slope towards the beach, but it seemed a bit more like a cliff than anything else.
"I thought it was fun," Harry laughed.
"I got some fireworks to set off tonight at midnight," George whispered to Ron and Harry midway through lunch with a shit-eating grin, "They're still in the testing phase, so they should be pretty interesting."
Harry would find himself leaning into Draco's shoulder as they sat at the top of the tower. Or he'd find himself scooting closer to Draco as they worked on homework. Even when studying, it never really seemed boring anymore.
"Sorry," Harry responded, sitting down next to Luna, who was sitting next to Ginny again, ensuring himself a good view of Draco. That is, if he didn't have his back to Harry. Draco was resountly sitting with his back to Harry, trying to ignore him, this bothered Harry more than he cared to admit.
Draco watched in amazement as ink suddenly appeared, spreading over the paper and forming the lines of the map. "It's a map of Hogwarts," Draco observed, "Wait are those-"
"You know," Draco started, "There's no one around here and you said you wanted to kiss me earlier..."
"You're probably right. I just don't want Harry to get hurt."
"Pansy? I never dated her."
When they reached the stands they worked their way up to a good seat in the middle of the stands.
His head felt like it was spinning.
"What? I've never stolen."
Harry's mind was also a complete whirlwind of what Dean and Seamus had told him earlier. Experiment? How on earth was he supposed to do that? He knew no one else who was gay- at least no one that was single.
"You can't just blame it on him, I know you were both involved," Hermione said as she came to sit down again.
"Sure, I was just going to walk these up to professor McGonagall's office, you're welcome to come with and then after we can go check on your bubotuber," Neville gestured to the vials of Wolfsbane in his hands. Neville had started working with Professor Sprout to grow and collect potions ingredients - especially wolfsbane - that they would then donate to St. Mungos. After the war, the supply of potion ingredients ran thin and with the growth of the werewolf population, wolfsbane was in extremely high demand.
Draco studied him for a second. It definitely wasn't a date, but it might be a chance at being friends again. "Sure, I'd love to. Let me put away my books though," he said, quickly rounding up his things and rushing up the stairs to his room. He almost tripped on one of the steps in his rush and felt his cheeks flush as he heard Harry laugh from below.
"I can say whatever I want and you can't dictate where I can and can't go," Blaise shot back with that familiar smirk that was common to his house.
"Yes you can. We'll help," Pansy said.
"And that's how far I've gotten with it, you?" Draco finished and Harry realized he had been talking.
"Woah!" Harry said as he jumped, practically falling out of his bed. "You can't wake someone up like that! How did you even get in here?"
"Nope, you said you wanted to prank Filch, no going back now," Draco said, laughing when Harry let out a put-out groan and fell back dramatically.
After a longer conversation than he'd been expecting, he made his way back up to the eighth-year dorms loaded down with food.
"Yeah," Harry said, more focused on their hands.
"Ughhhh!" Pansy groaned, flopping back down on the blanket dramatically and continuing to pick at the grass. "Why won't you let me help you?"
"Alright, Draco," Harry said, testing the word on his tongue, "call me Harry."
"That was close," Draco panted, flopping down onto the mound of pillows littering the floor.
This chapter would be titled The Calm Before the Storm if I was titling chapters... do with that information what you will.
"Did you enjoy the kiss?" Pansy cut in before Harry could answer. It was against the rules, but Draco could feel the tug of an answer at the back of his throat as whatever magic that bound players to tell the truth while playing games counted that as a question.
"Let's just do homework in the common room," Draco said upon noticing Harry. Draco rounded up his books from his bed and walked out of the dorm without a second glance towards Harry.
"You're pretty cute you know," Harry said and slipped his hands from Draco's wrists to take his hands. Draco's breath caught and he froze. "I'm sorry if I pushed too far earlier, I didn't mean to upset you," Harry said, fumbling over his words as he tried to backtrack, but as he was about to let go of Draco's hands, Draco threw his arms over Harry's shoulders and hugged him.
"Good, then get out of bed so we can do something today," Hermione said, swiftly turning around and walking out the door.
"Oh," realization seemed to dawn on Draco's face, "I mean, it's not common, but it's still accepted. It's a natural thing, why wouldn't they accept it?"
"What is-"
Harry sank to the floor laughing when he heard Filch disappear down the hallway. "That was fun."
"What?"
"France. Do you ever sing in the shower?"
"I don't shop everytime I go to Hogsmeade, you know," Draco replied.
--------------------------------
"You're seriously not mad," Draco asked, beyond confused at this point and his head was spinning with the new information.
Harry had no response. Zero. Because of all the people he had expected to guess that they liked each other, Ron was the last on the list.
As soon as the fireworks were over everyone hurried back inside to get warm and Harry was glad to note that everyone was heading to bed just minutes after getting inside.
"Well, good thing I'm here then."
"If it isn't Harry Potter," a voice drawled from the compartment door, cutting off Hermione and causing the four of them to turn their heads.
“Sometimes I still cannot believe that you like Malfoy,” Ron said, staring at Harry as he tried to settle his hair in the mirror. Harry shot him a look. “What? A year ago he was your sworn enemy, even with Voldemort running around. It’s seriously a turn of events that you’re about to take him out on a date.”
"I have no idea what you mean," Draco replied as he turned back to glaring at the girl who was talking to Potter.
“Mmmm, yeah eventually,” Harry responded. This was their usual routine; Harry would turn off the alarm, Draco would complain about the sound, then Harry would cuddle up next to Draco in bed for another ten minutes.
"Seven."
"Who cares?" Ron said around a big bite of chicken. "Just enjoy it 'Mione"
"Like teasing Malfoy?" Neville said with a knowing smile at Blaise who suddenly looked slightly worried. "Don't worry, I won't say anything, but you guys really aren't the most quiet."
"I don't know what you're talking about," Draco said as they reached the door and he pushed it open.
Hermione gave him a puzzled look, "Why amortentia?"
Pansy's lips tasted like firewhiskey and another undertone of something she couldn't place but had a feeling that it was her lip balm. Hermione felt herself leaning forward a bit, keeping her hands firmly in her lap. She was a bit drunk and she knew that she wasn't thinking completely rationally as she kissed Pansy, but it was nice and she'd never kissed a girl before.
Harry lent forward to kiss Draco lightly and when he was about to pull away Draco grabbed him, pulling Harry on top of him and continuing the kiss.
"Gee thanks. Sorry I'm not nearly as smart as you in Potions, Malfoy."
Harry suddenly broke down laughing, clutching at his stomach and Draco just more embarrassed.
He finds himself surprisingly calm as his legs carry him with purpose over to where Harry had turned around on the bench to see what was going on.
"You're not just going to let this go of course," Blaise said, "What are you going to do in return? If you want my advice, I say you include the mudblood and blood traitor in whatever it is you have planned for him. I think-"
"That's pretty neat."
—————————————————————
"I'll think about it."
Pansy simply ignored him and continued, "And you're always off on dates with your new boyfriend!" Pansy shot Blaise a look over her shoulder.
When he was fully inside he allowed Harry a moment to get used to him. When Harry reached up to drag Draco down for a kiss he took that as his que to move. Draco started off at a slow pace as he let his lips trail down Harry's cheek and neck softly, but soon Harry was rocking himself up to meet Draco's thrusts trying to make him go faster.
"They can decide for themselves if they want to drink or not," Dean laughed.
"Not much, just homework and classes. Hermione's been adamant that I get all my work done on time."
--------------------------------------
A few moments later Draco returned. His pants hung low on his hips and his arms were up, causing his shirt to inch up his stomach as he towel-dried his hair. This was a nightly occurrence that Harry didn't think he'd ever be able to forget or stop enjoying. He especially liked how Draco's hair looked after a shower: messy and wet and Harry longed to run his fingers through it.
"Your dad's car?" Hermione reminded him, laughing as his face pinkened and he picked up a cup.
"Did you guys have a late night or something?" Ginny asked.
"Thank you dear," Molly said, closing the door behind her on her way to wake everyone else up.
"Oh thank god," Draco said, hurtling over to Harry's bed.
p.s. Happy Christmas Eve
"Yeah being pan doesn't mean you don't have standards, but you don't," Pansy said.
Ron followed her lead and sat down next to her.
"Hey," Draco said when Harry came in.
---------------------------------
"No way, these are so rare! It's really beautiful," Draco breathed, running his hands over the fabric. Draco slid out from under the cloak, causing it to slide off Harry slightly, bringing his head and part of a shoulder into view. Draco walked around Harry checking out the cloak which made Harry go slightly red. "This was really your dad's?"
His wish came true as he was able to make it all the way back to the common room without seeing anyone. His luck ended when he made it into the room though and caught sight of Ron and Hermione kissing on the couch.
Hermione stared across the table at Pansy speechless, not knowing exactly how you respond to that.
"No, he has experience and he may be annoying, but he is a good player."
"Shut up you git." Harry snickered and followed after him.
"So green means you're aromantic?"
Just as he was about to dive into his reading, though, the door slammed open and in came two shouting boys. Draco groaned as he turned around to see who had just busted through the door, finding Dean and Seamus loaded down with alcohol.
"Fine, but only because I don't want to sit here in the dorm and do homework."
"How can you still not be bored with staring at me? You've been doing that for over an hour too," Draco shot back.
"Hey," Harry replied dumbly, mostly because he was a bit surprised to see him at the Gryffindor, but also a bit due to the fact that his hair was falling loosely around his face in a way that made him look a bit nicer than Harry would care to admit.
"I do! It was to prank filch and get Ron's things back."
"Well yeah, I mean you were always sneaking off to hang out with him. Not to mention how late you two would stay out..." Hermione replied.
"Sure," Harry said, then turned to Draco, "I'll meet you inside, alright?"
"I missed you," Harry said, his voice muffled due to the pillows.
Draco chuckled, sitting down next to Harry close enough so their shoulders and knees brushed together.
Draco cut him off as he spun around on the steps to glare at them, "Would you just stop? I'm not going to do anything and stop using those words. You're no better than either one of them. Your family is just as 'dirty' as theirs, your mom is no better than a common whore and we all know she's slept with more muggles than there are muggleborns in the school. Don't act so high and mighty."
“Sure hope so,” Harry said, then broke out into a smile, “On another note, I heard that Honeydukes came out with new candies. Want to go check it out later?”
"I'll call him whatever I want," Draco shot back, starting to walk over to Harry.
"Yeah, I think so, why?"
He wouldn't trade it for a moment though as he watched him laugh next to him as the match started. Draco was stunning.
"Well, the bubotuber I'm supposed to be taking care of doesn't really look like it's doing too good. I was wondering if you could take a look at it, and tell me what I'm doing wrong?"
"You know that Neville's just helping me with Herbology!" Blaise shouted back, suddenly very embarrassed.
"What?" Harry said, seemingly startled out of whatever he was thinking about while staring Malfoy down across the room.
Draco and Harry both stared in shock at Lucius, wondering how on earth he wasn't mad and trying to hex them both into the ground.
"I'm not off making out with him! We're being punished!" Draco protested indignantly from where he was sitting in Blaise's desk chair.
--------------------------------
"Aww, come on Hermione, that's what makes it fun," Ron said.
“I did give you a heads up. I told you I was coming to pick you up for lunch a week ago.”
Draco let out a soft sigh as he sunk into the warm water, back pressing flush against Harry's chest.
"Never have I ever slept naked," Goyle said with a blush.
"That's how it works now, ask a different question."
"Wait," Draco said, "Take yours off too." Draco watched his face turn even redder as he removed his hands from Draco and pulled his own shirt off. Draco took a moment to revel in the view of Harry's thin frame before leaning forward to capture his lips  again.
"Nah, I think it's good you finally got the guts to do something," Pansy giggled, she was already pretty much drunk. She swore up and down that she was a heavy weight but was always the first one drunk when they drank together.
"I'm gonna have to agree with Harry," Ron said.
"That means we actually have to get up," Harry laughed.
“Yeah, about a week after the potions incident.”
"You're talking to your bed now? And here I thought you couldn't get any crazier."
Pansy scoffed, "And when have I ever wanted a man."
"Yes! Hermione you're great!" Ron said grabbing her around the waist and pulling her towards him and placing a kiss on her cheek. Harry watched Hermione try and hide a slight smile, they really are great for each other.
---------------------------
Everyone looked at her mildly shocked and even Seamus looked a little impressed. Ginny blushed a little before spinning the bottle and it landed on Hermione.
"Do you have any stores you want to go to in specific? I mostly just want to go to honeydukes and also see if I can find someone with a different color haze."
Harry helped himself to a sandwich, "That might have been a good idea."
"That's where I read with mother," Draco said, pointing out a pretty table and chair set in the corner of the greenhouse. It was surrounded by flowers and vines and sat on a concrete slab. "There's just about every plant you can think of in here, from all around the world."
"Yeah, I'm just slightly worried about what they'll say."
The day had finally come for the party and almost all the eighth-years were gathered in front of the fireplace.
"I'm saying no alcohol, if you bring it and get caught, it's on you."
"She came in and-" Draco couldn't manage another word as his mouth suddenly felt full of cotton and he struggled to breathe, his head was suddenly spinning. He vaguely heard a sob and wondered who had made it.
“Harry finally got the balls to ask Malfoy to the Yule ball,” Ron interrupted loudly, slapping his friend’s shoulder across the table.
"Can I help?" Draco asked, trying to ignore the weird looks he was getting from different students as they made to head back to the castle.
"Thanks, Harry," Draco smiled down at his toes, "That means a lot."
"Is everyone gay?" Ron said, sliding down in the booth and picking up his drink.
Draco chucked, happily returning the hug with a smile. "You're the amazing one, I just provide plants," Draco said and Harry laughed, pulling back and smothering Draco with kisses.
"You know he can't flirt," Draco snickered.
Harry laughed and pressed a kiss to his forehead, “Alright, what when and where?”
The day got wilder as it went on. It seemed like the more colors he saw the more it didn't seem real. Everyone seemed to be surrounded by a color and he had yet to see anyone without a color. He supposed everyone had a color.
Harry managed to make eye contact with Draco and his eyes widened slightly. Harry watched as he said some kind of excuse to leave. Pansy smirked at him and Draco turned red and then he hurried out into the hall.
"Harry!"
Draco started drinking the moment Dean and Seamus set the bottles down on the table. He had been feeling funny around Harry all week and just wanted to forget about it all for a while. By the time the games began he was feeling blissfully light headed and stumbled over to sit between Pansy and Lavender. Nobody really seemed to want to sit next to Lavender as she seemed to switch spots every Friday, Draco mirrored Hermione - who was on Lavender's left - and gave her a large berth.
--------------------------
"Um, McGonagall stopped me in the hall and told me to find you because we have to hang out as it's getting close to curfew," at that, Pansy let out a hardly contained snicker and Draco shot her a look.
"Or a perfect way to get drunk and play party games," said Dean smile over at Seamus who sent him a conspiratorial smile back.
"I am not always up to something! Maybe I just want some sort of privacy from you for once! You've been stalking me since first year!"
“Yeah, I suppose you’re right,” Harry said, giving up on his hair and heading over to sit across from Ron on his bed.
"Wow, all that and you both lost," Pansy said with a snicker, "Alright, time to clean up. It's already past one in the morning."
"No."
"Oh shit-" Harry cursed, "I forgot that was today!! Shit!"
"Alright," Harry said, gladly following Draco out of the room and into the hall. "How do you find your way around here, it's huge," Harry asked as they rounded another corner to find more hallway.
Ron leaned back too and wrapped his arm around Hermione's shoulders, pulling her into him. "I've noticed too. Do you think he likes Malfoy?" Ron's nose scrunched up as he said it.
Eventually the bottle landed on Lavender, who quickly fulfilled her dare of kissing Goyle, and then spun the bottle. It landed on Harry.
"So, what kept you so late yesterday?" Ron said, walking over and leaning against the bathroom door frame as Harry finished brushing his teeth.
"I agree," Harry said, just as a waiter came over to take their order.
Sure enough, there were already decorations littering the common room as they returned, Ron was sure Gryffindor would win and was prepared.
"I'm really glad you invited me on a date today, I've had a really good time," Neville said, giving Blaise's hand a squeeze and smiling up at him.
"Well, yes, you're correct." Neville started running the leaves through his fingers, if only to distract himself from the way Blaise was standing next to him. After a few moments Neville finally spoke up, "How often have you been watering it?"
"Blaise really likes Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans too. Blaise once bought one of those packs filled with only the bad ones for Pansy as a gag gift; she gagged at a few really bad ones and then refused to ever eat them again. It was so funny we never told her," Draco let out a light laugh as he related the story to Harry.
"Was that a question or an answer?"
"You think?" Draco said.
"You're one to talk, there is no privacy with you either," Draco pointed out, shuddering at the memory of all the times she had no respect for personal space, like she walked in on him in the bathroom during an awkward time or the time she found his journal (which she read at full volume to their friends and laughed at for an hour).
When nobody said anything, Pansy continued, "Okay who's going first then?"
"Looks like you might not be the only one with feelings."
"I'm fine, don't worry. Professor Snape apparently finished analyzing the potion is all," Harry went to sit down when he finally realized Draco was sitting at the Gryffindor table today. A smile spread across Harry's face as he completely forgot he was talking to Hermione and moved to sit down next to Draco, "Hey, it's been a bit since you sat here."
"I was supposed to find Ron and Hermione at 12, and it's already 12:30," Harry said as he gestured across the street to where Ron and Hermione were walking together. "They'll be wondering where I am for sure. I'm sorry, but I better go and catch up to them alright? I'm sure you want to hang out with Parkinson and Zabini too."
Pansy quickly introduced the group to a game where two people would have to kiss without stopping and without touching. The first person to pull away or touch the other loses.
"Yeah, and I've heard he caused all sorts of trouble with it too." Draco laughed and Harry smiled at the sound.
"I wish I'd seen her face when she saw there were no cushions," Draco giggled, arms gripping at his stomach and he bent over with laughter.
"Look who's stealing questions now," Draco smirked over at Harry who had moved to lean against the headboard. Draco wanted to tell him to go back to his own bed but he couldn't bring himself to for some reason; there was just something about the way Harry looked in his bed. "I think I want to do something with potions. McGonagall actually offered me a position here after school as the potions teacher. Professor Slughorn is going to retire soon and someone needs to fill the spot."
“No kidding,” Draco said and Harry shot him a look, “That’s why we’re practicing now, you better make this count ‘cause we’re not going to get much practice in next week due to finals.”
"Yes, I would."
October 6, 1998
"I dare you to..." Draco looked around the circle, "kiss Longbottom."
"How was the date?" Blaise asked, voice way too chipper for it being two in the morning. "It must have gone well, with how late it is" Blaise said and Draco didn't have to be able to see him to know he was smirking.
"I can't find my herbology notes or homework!" Ron shouted, turning his trunk inside out onto the floor. Blaise looked at the mess in distaste, he knew that would all remain there on the floor until Hermione paid a visit to Ron in his dorm and made him clean. He hoped she'd come visit soon.
"Dare," Lavender said confidently and Hermione grin spread across her face, getting into the game.
"Nah, this is how people are wearing it now-a-days," Blaise chimed in as he walked into the bathroom too.
"Sorry," Harry apologized, trying to think of a reason he had left and coming up with nothing, "I uh- I went to visit a friend."
"They're over here," Draco said as he reached for a small box on the right side.
Harry was watching Draco now, the way his eyebrows knit together when he concentrated. He watched him move his hand to the corner of the page when he was about to finish and place his index finger below the page before turning it. Draco also placed his head in his hand and running his fingers through his hair when he worked on a question, he'd probably regret it later when his hair was messy though. Harry's eyes travelled from Draco's hand in his hair to his lips, he was running his lower lip through his teeth. They were soft, Harry knew. Really soft. He smelled like his body wash and citrus and he tasted like alcohol and chocolate that night. Harry wondered what he'd taste like if he hadn't been drinking.
"Great," Pansy said with a grin.
"It hasn't yet though, right? So why would it do something now?"
"Is she okay?" Draco asked and Harry was slightly surprised to see a bit of worry in his eyes.
"They'll both be fine," Draco replied, "but I sure won't. I cannot believe I'm stuck with you!"
"Course," Harry paused for a moment as he watched Draco shift on the pillows, "I can run a bath for you if you'd like, it might help a bit."
Harry made his way up the stairs to the eighth year dorms after classes to find Draco waiting for him on the couch.
Draco felt a bit of déjá vu as he looked down at Harry's hand.
"He made you dance with every single one?"
"Boys!" The two boys froze as they heard a loud shout from McGonagall from down the hall, "cut that out immediately! I invited you back here for another year believing you both were mature enough to put this petty behavior aside, and yet I find you two going at it in the hall and frightening the younger years!" McGonagall gestured to the students who were now retreating to the dormitories, following the prefects.
"So we're okay?"
"You think?" Ginny said, barely above a whisper.
"It was fine," Draco tried to say without giving away what'd he just spent the last hour doing, but failed miserably and what came out was more of a choked sob.
"Yeah, but I was the one who broke up with you in the first place, I should have been the one to say something."
They left the shop after that and Harry suggested they go to Zonkos.
“I always want you to sit with me at dinner,” Harry smiled and Draco blused, adverting his eyes.
A big grin spread across Harry's lips as he grabbed Draco and pulled him back into himself.
"Is this about Draco?" Hermione asked and Harry's eyes widened slightly.
"I don't know," Harry said, turning away to stare out the window. He was surprised to say the least, he'd never have thought it was possible for it to be considered normal growing up. It really went against everything Uncle Vernon said. Though, that wasn't very surprising, he was ignorant about a lot.
Draco made a face, “I saw your dancing then, it was subpar, and I’m guessing you have not practiced since either, huh?”
"Draco!" Harry said, shaking him.
"Come this way," Harry said and led him to the edge of the water, so Draco could get a view of the whole lake and the moon in the sky above the castle.
Positioning himself, he slowly slid into Harry, watching as his nose scrunched up ever so slightly at the intrusion.
"Sore from what, exactly? Seamus asked and Harry tried not to react, concentrating on not turning red.
"Alright, here give me your hand." Draco reached his hand forward and Harry tapped his wand to Draco's fingers, suddenly coating them in lube. "That'll make it easier."
"Mmm," he moaned, only making Draco harder.
"You all looked awfully suspicious," Harry pushed, if only to piss Draco off.
Hermione looked in the direction Harry nodded to see Pansy finishing off her cup.
“You only make this much food when you’re buttering me up to tell me bad news, so out with it.”
"You might want to take that off before going down," Draco said, pointing to the jumper.
"Oh gee a muggle game. You made me stop reading for a muggle game. What makes you think I'd want to play that."
"This is not a punishment, be happy that you're not both in detention. Now, do I make myself clear?"
-----------------------------------
Today’s breakfast was Draco’s favorite: pancakes with bacon and eggs.
"Aren't you supposed to be the good, rule-following, hero, golden boy?"
"It is." Blaise threw his pillow at Ron, just barely missing his head as he laughed running for the bathroom door.
Harry looked at him in mild shock. "Wait- you don't-" Harry struggled.
He was suddenly a bit nervous.
"Fine," Harry pouted, heading towards the door.
"Your decision? Or hers?" Draco noticed immediately that he hit another sore spot and inwardly cursed, "You don't have to answer."
"Was that not clear?" Harry gave a little laugh. "I want to, if you'll let me."
Draco studied him for a moment before sighing, "Sure, but only if you treat me to a butterbeer."
"Yeah, sucks to watch everyone else get their New Years kiss and not get to participate," Ginny laughed and Harry joined in.
Draco sat up, suddenly interested and accepted the sweet, "Oooo, thanks. I love these."
"I thought you said we couldn't talk about the questions outside of the game," Draco sighed, resigned. Pansy waved her hand dismissively at that.
He found the eighth-year dorms quickly, pointing to the names of Hermione and Ron alone, well after curfew, in the common room, "Think they're making out in there?" he asked, laughing at the disgusted face Harry made.
The potion itself took only a day to brew, and Harry was grateful his potion's partner was Malfoy.
"It was?" Harry finally asked incredulously.
"Sure," Harry said before quickly hurrying off.
"Well, I mean in the muggle world, it's not something you talk about. If you know what I mean."
Sunday, September 6, 1998
A/N: Hey all, so I want to be honest with you guys and let you know that I may run late or accidently skip update days during the next few weeks, please bear with me. My brother was diagnosed with Leukemia this week and my whole family is very worried about him. So if I don't update, that's why, though I'll try to keep the updates regular.
At dinner he decides there is one more thing he needs to do, and when he walks into the great hall he goes to the Gryffindor table instead of the Slytherin table, a whole hall of eyes following him.
The walk back to the dormitories was silent as neither of the two boys knew what to say. In all their years of being at Hogwarts, never had they imagined that they'd ever be walking to their own shared dormitory. The idea was something that wouldn't have ever even crossed their mind.
Harry turned to look at her and lowered his voice as she had done, "Yeah, he finally agreed to go on a date with me."
What could it be now, she thought with a sigh as she headed up the stairs to their room. She hoped that whatever was going on up there, she didn't need a teacher to deal with it - for all of their sakes.
"Yeah, I'll be up in a moment."
"I was thinking," Pansy said.
"What was that about?" Harry asked as they climbed the stairs to their dorm room.
"Oh definitely Parkinson," Ginny laughed and when the coin landed on heads and the question was shared, Pansy looked oddly proud.
"Just sounds like an excuse to me," Draco said as Harry paid for his candy, Draco following his lead.
Well what would it hurt, he thought, making his way over to Draco's table.
"I haven't been staring at him! And I'm most definitely not going to ask him out! Where on earth did you get the idea I even slightly liked him!! I don't even like him as a friend!" Draco then heard a slight cough from behind him and froze, mentally cursing himself for talking so loud. He turned around meeting the last person he wanted to see: Harry Potter.
"I don't remember any such thing," Draco replied.
"The punishment?"
"I'll go get the ingredients while you stir," Draco said as he moved away to find them in the store room.
-----------------------------
"Who is interested? You said you talked to some people," Harry said, trying to not focus on the way Draco looked when he laid like that.
"I'm heading to bed if you two are quite done," Draco stood up and left to go to his room. Harry was already asleep when he arrived and he paused to watch Harry a moment, trying desperately to sort out his own feelings.
"But I want to talk to you. It's already noon," Draco said. Harry flipped over then, managing to knock Draco off. He quickly climbed back on top of Harry though, they were chest to chest and Harry could feel all of Draco pressed against him, he felt a shiver run through him. Draco didn't seem to notice the effect he was having though and buried his face in Harry's neck. "I want to do something today but all you're doing is laying here."
"Oh, no, I haven't yet," Harry said leaning over to rummage through his bag that was sitting on the floor at his feet. It was instant relief as he downed half of it like he'd been told.
Their punishment passed awkwardly in the library studying. People looked over at them as they sat there, ignoring each other and as soon as Harry's wand buzzed from the alarm he'd set he jumped up and left the library as quick as he could.
"Probably red."
"What can I get for you?" she asked with a bright smile that slightly wavered when her eyes landed on Draco.
Draco's hair was just perfectly messed up and it seemed to glow in the light that streamed through the open doors. Harry was reminded all over again why he was in love with him.
There was a Quidditch match again between Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff today and Draco was wrapped up in a scarf that made him look impossibly small and adorable. Harry had to force himself to look away, blushing as red and Draco’s colorful haze.

"I know, I don't either. Draco is stubborn, he always has been, you know that. Maybe just give him a bit of space to sort it out for himself, maybe he just needs a bit."
"I'd like that," Neville said, looking over at him with a smile.
The walk back to the castle together was awkward to say the least.
"Alright, yer welcome to come 'round anytime," Hagrid said as Draco headed back towards the castle.
The game was decided to be Never have I ever and pansy had brought along a little bag full of never have I ever questions that she placed in the middle.
Harry leaned in and gave Draco a kiss that he'd meant to be quick but before he could pull away Draco was grabbing his hips, pulling Harry closer and quickly deepening the kiss. Harry quickly responded after a moment of surprise, moving his own hands to Draco's hips.
Harry's face was bright red and Draco was trying to recover. Harry was praying that Ron hadn't seen, he was not ready to have to explain it to Ron.
"I'm going to be permanently wrinkly from being in the bath that long," Draco complained when they stepped out of the shower and dried off.
Ron could see Harry stiffen slightly and he felt like he struck a nerve. "No, probably not."
"Alright, well we could hold tryouts on Wednesday this week, I think that's the ninth," Harry said, "What do you think Ron."
Harry paused for a moment, this was the first time Draco had really opened up to him about anything, and he wasn't sure the first time really counted. The first time, it was about his nightmares and he really didn't go into detail. Harry was happy that Draco was sharing something personal, even if it was just his worries about Quidditch. "Well, I haven't played in a while either if that helps any," Draco looked up at him, "I mean, I wasn't really at Hogwarts last year to play. I think everyone is a bit rusty, so don't worry too much, and when I saw you play for tryouts you seemed to be doing very well in my opinion."
"We're not up to anything. Just leave it be, you always just stick your nose in my business and it's getting on my nerves."
"Oh yes, that was slightly difficult to achieve," Pansy said with a smirk.
"Oh of course, I should have known," Ron said rolling his eyes and chuckling.
"Thanks for your help," Blaise laughed, suddenly growing nervous as he realized he didn't exactly know what to say next.
"Why not?" Hermione sent him a you know why look and the conversation was over.
"No."
“Yeah- yeah of course it’s alright, you’re always welcome.” Draco smiled at him, fingers tangling together between them slightly. Harry saw the slow blush creep up Draco’s ears and the haze glow a little brighter.
Charlie, Bill, and Fleur arrived this morning and Fleur has been in the Kitchen helping Ron's mom cook ever since.
Draco was shocked when Harry finally started kissing back. Finally! he thought. He'd been dreaming of kissing Harry for years and he couldn't seem to wrap his mind around the fact that Harry was actually kissing him back. Sure, Draco had thought he hated Harry at one point, but he figured he never truly could, even if he tried.
Harry opened his eyes to see Draco sitting half in front of himself. "You alright?" Harry asked, wondering why he suddenly moved.
Draco kept coming to sit at Harry's table though, even if it was at times a bit weird, because it was worth it if he got to be with Harry.
Draco burst out laughing and Harry immediately snapped his head over to Draco. He rarely got to hear him laugh, but when he did, Harry loved the sound of it. Harry couldn't take his eyes off Draco as he laughed and it didn't go unnoticed as she smirked.
When they arrived in the Three Broomsticks, it was quite packed and they barely got a table. They settled down into a small booth in the back corner, it was a bit cramped and their knees brushed against each other under the table.
"Wait, are you not going to tell us why you're back so late?"
"Thanks Hermione," Harry replied giving her a small smile. Draco followed his lead and stopped glaring at Pansy to shoot Hermione a small smile of her own.
"You would?"
"I know right?" Harry smiled at Draco's awed expression.
"Hey, I thought you were giving out position assignments? Congrats again on being team captain by the way!"
"I don't think they'll mind either. Not really..."
That doesn't mean he likes you though.
"That's dangerous," Blaise said and Pansy smacked him.
Harry turned back to the pitch where tryouts were happening, it seemed like the Slytherin captain was weeding out those who couldn't fly or didn't have very good broom handling. Harry liked watching Quidditch, even if it was just practice or just the Slytherins, but he was having trouble focusing with Draco next to him.
Lavender turned the pitcher over her head and the circle of eighth years watched as it soaked her and evaporated before it hit the ground. Pansy snickered as Lavender's makeup ran down her face and she replaced the pitcher onto the counter. Lavender walked dejectedly back to her spot in the circle and sat down, still dripping wet. Everyone quietly snickered as they watched her.
"Yeah."
Not just had a crush on him, but was in love with him.
Molly looked disbelievingly at them. "He's been really nice to Luna too," Ginny spoke up, "They're friends."
She wanted to pull her hair out when Draco sat down next to Harry in the stands. In the Gryffindor section no less. Either he didn't notice or didn't care that he was out of place. Him and Harry argued back and forth, completely in their own world.
"Did you now? Is he the cause of your 'gay awakening'?" He didn't think it was possible, Harry got even redder.
Draco gave him a warm smile, "Sounds like a good idea to me. It won't be very fun walking back in this weather though," he said jokingly.
"Uh," Harry wasn't sure he wanted to explain that the only reason he knew was because his two best friends got laid to the school nurse. "We realized because of the brightness of the colors," it wasn't a total lie, "the brighter the color the more you are feeling love or like towards a person."
"Yeah?"
—————————--------------
"Yeah, I'm fine."
"Don't worry," Ginny laughed a little breathlessly, "I'm not here to crash your date, it'll just be a moment. I have something I need to tell you."
"Is that really a shock?" Blaise laughed, "He was so deep in the closet I thought he'd never make it out."
Instead of working, he opted to watch Draco. His hair had grown out slightly over the summer and hung loosely around his head. At the beginning of the year Draco had come to school with it slicked back as usual until Harry made an off-hand comment that he should try to wear it loose. Draco hadn't slicked it back since and Harry felt kinda bad. It did look better though. Quite a lot.
Harry could hear the worry in his voice and he couldn't help but think about how a year ago he would've been shocked to see Draco worried about him. "I'm not sure exactly, all I did was stir the potion," Harry said, "well, I suppose I didn't even get to do that. It exploded before I even managed to bring the stirring stick the whole way around. It was a murky color though, and last week it looked fine."
"Oh for real?" Draco nodded his head at Harry and gave him a small smile, "That's so cool!"
"Fine. truse," Draco finally said, reaching out to shake Harry's hand. What have I gotten myself into, "Now hurry up, before McGonagall finds us and gives us another punishment."
Draco scoffed and walked over to his stuff to take up to his dorm, grumbling the whole way.
"Why won't it stay put?" Draco groaned and raked his fingers through Harry's hair angrily. Harry had to stifle a groan.
"I want to ask you something, and you've been avoiding me."
"I'm just surprised you didn't think to take the potion yourself," Hermione shook her head.
"It only shows the map if you know the password," Harry closed it again, pressing his wand tip to the paper, "I solemnly swear that I'm up to no good."
After a moment, Draco realized he wasn't planning on continuing without prompting, "And? Were you just going to leave it at that?"
Draco's lips were slightly parted and he could feel his breath against his neck. Harry reached forward, making sure not to disrupt Draco, and closed his book, marking it with a piece of parchment. He turned back to Draco and contemplated for a moment before placing his arm gently around Draco.
Draco, who was a bit more sober than both Pansy and Harry, had turned to look at her when his name was mentioned and now a look of pure shock was on his face. "You can't involve me in his dare, it's not fair."
"What's that?"
"Yup!" Harry reached for the door and held it open for Draco. "Ladies first."
"What did they do?" Draco prompted.
He looked for the new seeker now, finally spotting the young fourth year that had taken his old position on the team. The girl looked nervous, Harry noticed. He remembered how nervous he was for his first game as seeker.
They both drank their Butterbeers in awkward silence. When Harry was about halfway through his drink he finally tried talking to Draco again about something else. Draco was quickly smiling again and had forgotten all about the intense moment they had both just shared.
"Good match!" The Ravenclaw captain said with a smile, coming over to shake Harry's hand.
Ten minutes later, the three of them were seated on Draco's bed tipsy and on their way to drunk.
"Today we'll be trying the potion," Snape said as everyone fished their books out of their bags, "But first you'll need to add two more ingredients to dilute it, stirring for ten minutes clockwise before putting in the ingredients," Snape scribbled down the ingredients and directions onto the blackboard as he spoke.
"Yeah," Draco responded and set it back down, "I haven't really played in a while. I'm worried that I'm not going to do very well at the matches."
----------------------
"Yeah, it was pretty good, bummed that you couldn't be there though."
"Well, I better go then. I have some homework to finish still," Neville said, and Blaise couldn't help feeling a little disappointed.
"Anywhere you want," Draco said and then paused to take in Harry's unsure stance, "You have made a fort before right?"
“Come on, time to get up. You’ve gotta get dressed,” Harry said, pressing his lips to Draco’s once before sitting up.

"I missed you too," Draco said, leaning forward and pulling Harry into a kiss. Harry returned the kiss, it quickly turning heated as Draco started walking backwards until his back pressed up against the gate.
"Thanks, you do too," Draco said, avoiding Harry's eyes, opting to focus on his shoes.
"How did it go?"
Draco moaned, hand coming down from his grasp of Harry's hands on the wall, to grab onto Harry's hair and pulling. Draco clenched his teeth as he came inside of him, collapsing against the wall with Harry as he pulled out, panting.
Harry grabbed a pair of boxers and Draco's oversized, green, slytherin jumper when they exited the bathroom and Draco felt his heart swell at the sight. When Harry shyly offered Draco one of his own jumpers Draco happily pulled it on over his head.
"Will they catch anything on fire?" Harry asked, leaning in towards George slightly.
"I'm pretty sure that's just a Gryffindor trait," Draco said and Harry laughed, returning to the restroom to get dressed, Draco watched him go with a smile.
-------------------------
"Yeah? And my hair?" Harry smirked at Draco as his nose scrunched up in mock disgust.
"Ugh what happened," she groaned, taking in the messy room.
He made it back to his dorm an hour later, eyes puffy and swollen, but finally feeling composed enough to make his way back to his room. He was hoping Blaise would be asleep when he arrived, but as he opened the door and Blaise's voice rang out through the dark, he realized he wasn't going to be so lucky.
As soon as Harry had caught the snitch he'd gone straight for the ground. He felt like he'd die if he stayed on the broom for another minute. His whole body ached and he was beyond glad the match was over which was a first for him.
"You alright there?" Ron said, breaking Harry out of his thoughts, "You're kinda red. You didn't make yourself sick practicing last night did you? It was kinda cold out."
Draco looked at her with a look of distaste, "You can take it off yourself."
Harry got out of the water and walked towards Draco who started backing up, "Don't you dare."
"I'm not cute," Draco said.
2. Because I only had one idea going into this I had planned on this story being about 5 chapters, maybe 10 at the most. I was not expecting it to get this out of hand…
Everyone slowly meandered over to the slowly forming circle and pansy put an empty bottle in the centre for their usual truth or dare game.
