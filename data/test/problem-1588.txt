"I can't find her! I found her house empty and when I went to my house, the invisibility cloak was gone."
Draco placed his lips onto Harry's and Harry immediately returned the kiss. They both melted into the kiss, not caring that they were in public. Although, they did care enough to not let the kiss last too long. When they pulled away, they were wearing identical smiles.
Without waiting for a response, Harry apparated to his house. He was surprised to smell something amazing from the kitchen. He walked towards the room and saw Draco squinting his eyes in concentration, stirring something in a pot.
Draco's smirk grew as he watched Harry struggle against his magic, pulling his shirt off for the male under him.
Harry started to move faster on Draco's dick, causing Draco to get impatient. Draco started thrusting his hips in time to Harry. The two started moaning louder.
"Something important, at that! There has to be something we're missing that could completely crack this case wide open."  Hermione said.
"Look, by that point, the rest of the Ministry will know and we'll have plenty of backups. Hermione, it's a good idea. Please, just go along with it."
"Getting me out of my house. Reminding me that life goes on. Helping me forget about everything for awhile."
Harry's moans became louder, Draco taking this as a sign the male was getting close. Draco reached his hand around Harry's body to his forgotten dick, starting to work it almost as fast as he was thrusting into Harry. Harry let out a lewd moan as he released into Draco's hand. After a few more thrusts, Harry heard Draco cry out as he felt himself fill up.
"In a few more years when you're eleven, you'll get to go to Hogwarts with James and Aurora." Draco said
"Because they really don't like you or your parents. They figured if you have as little time as possible, it'll be more likely you get sent to Azkaban."
"Clearly you are trying to accomplish something." Harry said as Draco continued to place light kisses on his boyfriend's neck.
Harry Potter ventured through Hogwarts. He was surprised to see that after everything, the walls still stood. Of course, all of it could be fixed with the flick of a wand. But everyone would remember The Battle of Hogwarts. Especially Harry Potter.
"Draco isn't as bad as you think. He has feeling too, you know. The only reason you don't like him is because of his last name."
"Because, Potter, I finally decide to move past whatever stupid thing I've had against you for years and be nice. I thought everything was fine. I even invited you to visit me whenever you want. And what do I get? Ignored!"
"I don't know who the people were. I-I've never saw their faces. And if I did, I don't remember. But the voices sounded familiar, but I can't put my finger on it. I'm sorry, Hermione."
I watched and listened in awe as Harry explained each of his years at Hogwarts. I almost lost it when I found out he and Weasley used Polyjuice Potion and tricked me in our second year. But I couldn't stay mad. When I saw the worry in his eyes and he touched my hand, I felt all of my anger slip away.
"You could never be a burden. I'm choosing you. And I know damn well who you are. I know damn well that there's always something with you. But guess what, I don't give a shit. You'll never be a burden to me. I want to be there. I want you to trust me with everything. Get rid of all these stupid worries you have. Guess what else, they're all stupid and full of shit. I wanna help you through this. Fuck, I wanna help you and be there for everything. I don't care how big or small. I want to be there for everything. You hear me? Everything. So get your head out of your ass and see that."
The the past two weeks they had went to a free concert, got breakfast, and went mini golfing. All in the muggle world, of course. Harry liked getting to really see London, seeing as he couldn't do that with the Durselys. Draco was fascinated by the muggle world, and the two could be open about whatever they had going on since no one knew them. Plus, Harry loved how cute Draco looked whenever they went somewhere new and Draco was fascinated.
The door of my old bedroom opened creaked open. I looked over and saw Hermione peeking her head into the room.
"W-well, Hermione and Ginny decided to see some of their friends from Hogwarts and while they were doing that, they told them about us and, I guess, someone fishy found Cho and put something in her Butterbeer and Cho got taken and told some bad people about us and then they let Cho go but Cho doesn't remember a lot and I'm just worried that something bad might happen if we go out." Harry said in one breath.
IF YOU SKIPPED THIS CHAPTER DUE TO THE SMUT, BASICALLY, HARRY TAUGHT DRACO HOW TO USE EVERYTHING IN A KITCHEN AND THEN THE TWO WENT TO A FANCY WATER PARK. THEY WENT ON SOME WATER SLIDES, HAD SOME FUN IN A SAUNA, AND THEN LEFT. THAT'S BASICALLY IT
Draco grabbed Harry's messy brown hair and pulled him up, Harry's back pressing against Draco's chest as Draco thrust into Harry, still hitting his prostate.
Draco woke up before Harry did the next morning. Draco watched his boyfriend as he peacefully slept next to him. Draco placed a quick kiss to his boyfriend's temple before getting out of the bed. He put on some clothes and walked to the kitchen. He opened a cabinet and was shocked to see a house elf sleeping in it.
Through it all, he lost Lupin, Tonks, Snape, Fred, Hedwig, Cedric, Sirius, Dumbledore, and Dobby, he fell in love, and he killed the man that killed his parents all those years ago.
"Don't get me wrong, I wish him the best. I want his date with Granger to go well. But thinking realistically, well, that's a different story."
"I never said I didn't believe you. Or that I am against the idea. But Ron and Hermione need to know."
"Paris. They have their own amazing world. You can go to a caf√© and walk around in the city of love."
Ron and I went to opposite ends of the hallway and silently opened doors. The first room was empty. I looked at Ron and saw he didn't find anything either. We moved to the next doors. If Harry wasn't in any of these rooms and he wasn't downstairs, then we would have no clue where he is.
It had been two hours and the family reunon was in full swing. No one had said anything about Harry or Hermione's presence. Harry, Hermione, and Draco were peacefully sitting at a table, talking, when Rodolphus approached them.
"Come on, let's just tell them. It'll come out sooner or later. And we're all mature here." Ginny said, looking at Hermione.
"Nope. He hasn't done a lot of things. He's never went ice skating. But I already told him we're doing that when it gets cold."
"Oh, yes." Hermione started. "During the battle, I found a time-turner. After it was over, I took it to Harry. We decided-"
Harry decided that he wanted to take Draco on romantic date. He spent a lot of time planning and making sure everything was perfect.
"Well, I'm not sure how to start this." Harry said, fiddling with his hands. "We can't go out tonight. Or tomorrow. Or any time."
The driver raised an eyebrow but pulled away from the curb. Ten minutes later, the driver stopped in front of a building. Harry paid the lady and got into the short line. He showed his fake ID and got let in. The first thing he did was go to the bar and take six shots back to back.
As Harry walked up the stairs to his old room, he marveled at how untouched it was. He was even more shocked when he opened the door and saw the room was completely untouched. Harry walked across the room and sat on the bed that used to be his. He thought about all the time he had spent in that very spot.
"Draco wasn't much help either." Hermione started. "He claims he hasn't been to Azkaban since you two ran into him awhile ago. But here's the thing, he seemed nervous. Something about him was off the whole time I was talking to him. When I came back here to see if you two had come back from the Mannor, I saw there was an envelope on your desk, Harry. It said 'Azkaban Case' on it, so I just decided to open it. And you'll never believe it. Draco went to Azkaban yesterday. He went in at exatly 7:30 pm. He went until he was three floors below his father's, stopped, spent 23 minutes inside, and left the building at exactly 7:56 pm. So, not only was he the last person to enter Azkaban before his father's escape, he also lied about doing it."
The parents quickly bid their children goodbye and they finally stepped onto the train. They watched as the train left, leaving Harry and Draco with Lily, Hermione and Gregory with Iris, and Ron and Romilda with Rose.
Draco continued to rub his hand against Harry over his pants as he made small marks on the his chest. Harry's breathing picked up as he tried not to make a lot of noise. Right before Harry came, Draco stopped, leaving a throbbing Harry to whimper even more at the loss. Draco wasted no time removing not only Harry's but his pants as well. Harry was quick to pull Draco back on top of him, forcefully connecting their lips. Draco groaned into the kiss as his hips started to move against Harry's length. Harry couldn't suppress the groan that came out of his mouth at the motions. Draco's hands found their way to Harry's waist and slowly started to pull at his boxers. When Draco had gotten them far enough down, Harry's throbbing length sprung out. Draco suppressed the slight whimper he threatened to make.
"You wanted to be friends with Harry Potter when you first met him but you resorted to hating him when he turned down your request. You started having panic attacks and nervous breakdowns in your sixth year because of Voldemort. The first guy you ever liked was that boy on your Quidditch team."
I apparated to the front door. I know we're dating, but I still wanted to be polite. I knocked on the door. A few minutes later, I knocked again. And again.
Harry rolled his eyes but grabbed his boyfriend's hand, pulling him through the crowd while fighting off the Death Eaters.
"You don't have to do anything, Hermione. You don't want to be with him anymore. You don't need to go check on him and make sure he's okay. Anyways, it's Ron. He'll forget about it in a week."
"I don't care how mad I was at you, you can sleep next to me still. I wasn't mad at you either, just slightly annoyed."
"It's just, something happened to one of Harry's friends from school. And, we're kind of worried about it. It's hard to explain. But we both think it would be best if we were together as much as possible. Decreases the chances of something happening to either one of us."
We ate the food and it wasn't half bad. As soon as Harry put the dishes in the sink, I started pulling on Harry's sleeve.
I sat down silently. I started eating my food and I had to admit, it was good. But I was way to distracted by the sickly looking state of my mother.
‚ÄúYour father? Scary?‚Äù Harry cut into Draco‚Äôs words. For a second Draco stared at him. He could see the change of lines in his face, could tell he was holding back; but it was only for a short moment, because then he burst out laughing.
‚ÄòHere I was thinking they enlisted you for your potions mastery and previous experience working on the wrong side of war.‚Äù Harry retorted.
"You're fucking naked! For Salazars sake. Now put those pathetic excuse for cloths, back on before you catch hypothermia. At least delay it for a couple months anyway." Malfoy exclaimed, hands covering his eyes now.
With a shaky breath he pushed himself up his or should he say her body felt strange. It was strange to walk and move. He felt his or again her boobs when he moved his arms, this strange weight Just pooped on his front.
‚ÄòThis was a strategic hit Ron. They knew where we were. They knew our whole platoon was here, unprepared. It was a saluter, we tried to fight back it was no use, we were outnumbered, outwitted
"I cant anymore, Malfoy. I just cant. The smell, the walls, the mold and moss. The constant dripping. THE RAPE!!!" he pulled at pansy's to long hair, his shift rising up, pulling snugly against his stomach. "EVERY NIGHT, EVERY DAY. THE SAME FUCKED ROUTINE!!!" He screamed.
Malfoy was beside himself. ‚ÄòPotter. Don‚Äôt be stupid you will never survive a vow like that. There are to many uncertainties. You‚Äôll die!‚Äô Draco pleaded.
"I have a daughter Malfoy." He gasped, looking over to him, then to his right to thank the man who helped him birth her.
"This isnt right. You and your mother were meant to go free. I. Was going to testify for the both of you. And then that.. That. BITCH! Parkinson. She went and TOOK MY LIFE!" He screamed, slamming his fist into the mattress, plowing a puff of dust into his face.
"Aurors. Please take Miss Parkinson to the holding cells, where she will await passage to Azkaban. Court dismissed." He commanded banging on his gabble, in closing.
Dr dollie, as Harry had decided to call her. Not bothering to learn her name. He doubted they would be returning after this. Looked down at her notepad, as the quill stared them both down, after jotting down what Ginny had said.
‚ÄòI‚Äôm sorry. You stay. I‚Äôll go the spare.‚Äô Placing a kiss on Ginny‚Äôs forehead as he grabbed his pillows.
‚ÄòDawlish.‚Äô He greeted, muscle memory taking the stance one must in front of their commanding officer.
"I wouldn't go around taunting ministry workers, Malfoy. We aren't the ones stuck behind bars, for the forceable future." Rick snarled, as Thatch dragged Harry out the cell.
‚ÄòNo, its quite alright Mrs Potter. Your right.‚Äô She stared him down. ‚ÄòI should treat you like any of my other clients, I only thought to shorten the process for you as, your wife informed me that you are quite opposed to Mind healing.‚Äô
When the medi-witch came back, she abruptly took Harry's wrist. Branding a protective rune on to it, with the tip of her wand. Harry felt tears leak as he ripped his arm from her grasp, cradling it to his chest. Pansy really had zero tolerance for pain.
But despite his words when night fell, than morning came, Harry was surprised to find he had been spared the guards nightly rounds.
‚ÄòAre you insane Potter! After what we just went through. You want us to become hit wizards.‚Äô Draco scowled, his ire evident in is stoney expression.
With a howl of exhaustion, Draco pulled him up. His hair coming lose from the harsh winds as Harry made his way back up on solid ground. The two hugging each other close and breathing heavily in each other‚Äôs grasp.
‚ÄòIt‚Äôs just I...I... never thought I‚Äôd get to hear you say that to me again. Fuck, dad. I missed you.‚Äô He sobbed into Harrys shirt.
He rested his head against the bars. Tears slipping from his eyes, as he whispered. "I'm Harry Potter." until it lost all meaning. Breaking down in heaving sobs.
Harry smiled, as food flew around her cutting itself and pooping into the pot on the stove. Harry unclasped the wax seal. Reading over the missive with excitement and trepidation.
"Same as last year. New minister. That could mean changes, and... Your mothers in France." He paused to let Malfoy take that in, before continuing. " Has a fashion line, under the Black name. Her ban should be lifted in a month."
So Harry stopped what he was doing. Turning around, and making his way back to the Burrow. Once inside he made, his way through the sea of red hair to his wife, kissing her sweetly on the lips.
"Whatever it is keep it, I don't want it." ready to bang on the doors, and demand the guards take him back to his cell. Shocking as it might be, it was preferable over spending anymore time in Parkinson's company.
James rubbed a hand behind his neck, making Harry raise a brow. That was one of his own tells, when he was about to say something he knew another wouldn‚Äôt like. Draco actually pointed it out to him when he was first drafted.
She rolled her eyes, resting her knee on her leg. "Spare me the Gryffindor act Potter. It doesn't suit me. Sit there and tell me though, that Draco hasn't figured It out."
‚ÄòSo. Does this mean my husband‚Äôs back?‚Äô She asked, leaning against the back door. A tentative grin, making its way across her face.
"Fine." Harry retorted, with a groan. Looking at his apple, then looking back over at Malfoy. Then back at the apple. Reluctantly, He got up and went to the bars. "Come here Malfoy."
‚ÄòThey. They said you were dead. We buried you. I cried we all cried. But your here. Your alive.‚Äô James sobbed. Pulling Harry back into a fierce hug. ‚ÄòDad.‚Äô He sobbed again. ‚ÄòYour alive. Your alive!‚Äô
Why not start forgiving those who had no choice in who they fought for. So he called out to her, making his way over to where she stopped, at his voice. Noticing the odd object she had in her hand. It reminded Harry of the odd nick nacks that he found strained around Dumbledores office.
What disease had Pansy given him when she switched them? He was about to ask, when he was rudely yanked up, and dragged bare foot to another room.
Harry now understood, why people used to cower before him. When he could look like that it was no wonder.
Harry let out a small scream of frustration, turning to the wall and giving it a swift kick. As pansy boasted behind him.
The guards jeered and heckled. As layer by layer fell to the floor. Soon he was only standing in a pair of lacy underwear.
‚ÄòFrom what we have gathered so far, the hits Britain has taken have favours the gamot. We are wining the battles but losing the war. They first took Draco of the gamot and enlisted him, it was a clever move. And from my research he was the only one on the gamot that was forcibly enlisted. Ive also run the numbers, and surely you have seen as your work as a vulture that our platoon has had the highest losses of any squadron.‚Äô
‚ÄòI‚Äôm a slytherin Potter. Of course I would.‚Äô With a flick of Malfoy‚Äôs wand the lumos was gone and the tent was once again shrouded in darkness.
On his way to the soldiers mess he couldn‚Äôt help but sense that feeling in his gut that told him trouble was coming, something terrible.
He‚Äôd just shagged his wife. Who he hasn‚Äôt shagged in three years. And the whole time all he could think of was Draco.
"Just answer one question for me." Harry asked. As he watched the apple fall and rise, with a flick of his wrist.
With a smirk and a plate full of beans and toast, Harry made his way over to Greenwich who was flailing his arms about, trying to get his attention.
"Do not delude yourself into thinking, that I don't know exactly what those boys get up to." she stated with a quick node to the guards. "That." she pointed at the rune. "Will protect you from them. while in your... Condition."
Harry quietly put his rags back on. All the while never taking his eyes off Malfoy. Another tense moment passed before Malfoy finally turned to face him. Placing his new clean apple on his bed. then following it siting on its edge, hands between his knees.
Harry waking at the sound turning to wake Draco from his night terrors. With a gasp, Draco jolted into a sitting position.
"Potter. Potter. Harry!" Malfoy bellowed. Harry stopped, but didn't turn, his voice was like daggers when he spoke.
‚ÄòWell then. I better go get that ogdens I‚Äôve been saving for this exact moment.‚Äô Draco beamed heading off to wherever he had hidden the expensive bottle of alcohol.
‚ÄúPansy Parkinson. You are under arrest for the adding and accomplicing of death eaters. You are found to be charged with the aid of you know who by way of turning over Harry Potter to his forces.‚Äù The woman stated.
On to the slimy floor. Splashing on the wall, slowly helping the growing moss and mold, that resided there. He could count the days with it he stared at it‚Äôs slowly growing form that much. Sometimes he swore he saw it move. Though perhaps he had finally gone round the bend.
The medi-witch however, was the nicest of the sorry bunch he had been so privileged to meet. Examining him with the guards watchful eyes upon them, before dressing him in the familiar Azkaban garb. It was a fresh one at least, he thanked Merlin. Harry feared that he would have been given a used one, caked in blood.
‚ÄòYou wouldn‚Äôt.‚Äô Harry chastised, watching as Draco made his way out the tent, the sound of the pouring rain filling the tent as Draco opened it.
Searching the crowd for his friends he came up short, he was about to give up hope when he spotted Hermiones bushy hair kneeling next to a student.
The weight of it all, left him feeling weak and out of breath. Leaning heavily against the stone of an unknown corridor. He wanted to cry. But all he felt, was numb.
She lifted Harry up against the wall, scratching up his back. where the holes in his prison garb lay. Harry struggled against her, as she whispers in his neck. "Insurance."
Holding on to the edge of the table so he was in the perfect position, as Harry began to devour his arse.
Harry gulped. The memory of his first day in this hell returning, and the threat that came with being thrown in his cell.
She was mental. Harry thought, telling her as such. ‚ÄúI will never stop fighting.‚Äù He spat back at her.
"Till I actually believe you. Which I don't, by the way. This is typical Pansy. Anything to get yourself out of trouble. Though I also think you've finally gone barmy." Malfoy stated, from his perch upon his bed. "Think tha'll release you if you keep spouting that Potter rubbish." He smirked. Looking over at Harry.
Don't fucking sit there and tell me your sorry. Don't presume to tell me that I need to keep fighting, because I am fucking done, fighting. And I am fucking done with you. I lost the will to fight." With that Harry took up his mantel of watching the slime grow until he died.
‚ÄòBecause. The enemy don‚Äôt know that. Why do you think I led you over here.‚Äô Gesturing to the secluded grove in which they stood.
Harry stared at himself in disgust. He had started to resent his own face. Another little plot of hers, he supposed. So that, if he ever got his face back he wouldn't want it.
Draco whispered something wandless, Harry gasped and things became more, well more as the two joined, wrapping their arms around each other needing to be closer.
"About a month." He replied, playing with a loose thread on his blanket. "Then, a month. And two days." was his answer.
"What?" Malfoy asked, as he attempted wandless magic. A past time he had grown more and more obsessed with. Trying to lift the apple, harry had given him. He'd had two today, so was just being generous.
Draco looked like he was ready to hex him, if he could. "For Salazars sake. Potter! Just spit it out. Merlin knows I Have the time to wait."
He was lead past many rooms. All of them looking exactly alike, with no numbers on them so you knew what they were. He wondered how the detestable people who worked here, ever found their way around.
‚ÄòI think it may be best to hold off on explanations till after your mum and siblings are all here.‚Äô Taking a sip of his English tea, a sigh of contempt escaping his lips. It had been to long since he‚Äôd had a proper English tea.
"Now. Look at that twat! Gotta love Purebloods. They are always spelled so hair doesn't grow where they don't want it ." Tristyn leered. Making Harry turn around to have at least some modicum of privacy.
‚ÄòYou mean to tell me you have known for three months, and didn‚Äôt think to tell me each time I‚Äôve asked what‚Äôs new?‚Äô
"But you've made a mistake. Don't trust Harry Potter. He's not who you think he is. It's the real Parkinson. Why-Why wont you believe me." He continued to plead, despite the threats to his person. Tristyn had stopped listening though and took off his shackles.
Draco found himself at the toilet expelling his recently eaten slop, as a humorless chuckle reached his ears, as he continued to hurl.
‚ÄòLook I don‚Äôt know who you think you are or how you found this house. But you about 3 seconds before I summon the.....‚Äô
James inventions, Albus art, hanging on most walls. And Lily‚Äôs numerous hobbies could be found in near on every room.
Harry glanced over his shoulder, and catching Draco‚Äôs eye, quickly turning his attention back on Ron.
So he began to wonder the halls, the once cheerful castle a ruin. Littered with the bodies of the fallen children, who once learnt and roamed in its halls.
Harry let out a pitiful laugh. "That's funny Malfoy. I'm amazed you can still make the....ugh" he gripped his stomach again.
Harry rolled his eyes, to the sound of "the boy has such a soft heart." and "wants to see the best in every one." meanwhile the real Harry felt like throwing up again.
Harry knew that as soon as the guards came, that stony exterior would be back in place, like the finest marble.
"Oh, yeah." I said, noticing that she had barely touched her plate. She still had food piled on it. I eyed my mom warily before taking a deep breath. "Are you okay, mom?" I asked.
"Harry!" Hermione yelled, stopping Harry's murmurs to himself. "Th-that's the spell? The one that finally made you get rid of that book?"
I felt empty when I wasn't with him. I loved seeing him. Just seeing his smile makes me smile. I get lost in his eyes. I've never felt this way before. Mean while, I'm sitting here pretending like I don't want him.
Harry, on the other hand, was trying not to let his nerves show. He led them through the city to a bridge. Draco was confused when they stopped, but realized what was happening as soon as he looked down; Love Locks
Harry took the invisibility cloak off and threw it on the floor. He plopped down on the couch next to Draco.
"He wants to use us as bait. Say that we will be somewhere at a specific time and that he's gonna kill us or something like that. That way, all of them are bound to show up, but they'll all be walking into a trap."
Instead of responding, Harry squirted some of the sun screen on his hand and put it on Draco's chest, rubbing it in. Harry continued to apply sun screen to Draco, as Draco watched in awe.
Harry let a small whimper out at the loss of contact. Draco's eyes met Harry's for a few seconds before continuing with the buttons on his shirt. Draco swiftly slid the shirt off of Harry's body and let it fall to the ground. Harry placed his hands on the collar of Draco's shirt and pulled the taller boy closer to him, allowing Harry to press his lips back against Draco's. As they kissed, Harry fumbled with the buttons of Draco's shirt, praying that he could get it to come undone. When he succeeded, he let out a small noise of happiness. Draco moved fast and put his tongue back in Harry's mouth. This time, Harry didn't fight. He let Draco explore his mouth with his tongue while his hands explored the rest of his body.
The man waved his wand, revealing a part of his wall that was really a door. The man opened the door and motioned for the people to enter.
I apparated out of the Manor and back to my house. I smiled when I saw my adorable boyfriend asleep with a small smile. Quickly, I changed into different, more comfortable, clothes and laid down in bed. I got under the covers as carefully as possible. I snuggled up next to Harry and put on of my arms around his waist. Shortly after, I was asleep.
"The Azkaban things. How did they escape? Where are they now? Why hasn't anything happened? It's just so much." Harry said, his eyes welling with tears out of pure stress.
Draco hadn't been lying when he said his mom looked sick. She was so frail. It looked like she hadn't eaten in weeks and that she would blow over if the wind blew too hard. She had huge bags under here eyes and here whole face seemed pale.
Draco spent twenty minutes collecting his thoughts and trying to figure out what he wanted to say. He apparated to Harry's house and knocked on the door. He didn't hear any noise from inside. He spent five minutes trying to knock, but nothing happened. Finally, he pulled out his wand.
"Good, good. I don't mean to be bothersome, but this thing is supposed to start soon and I can't get everything set up."
"Let me start before you can say anything. This meeting has to be short. I need to be gone before the Polyjuice wears off."
It had been two weeks since Harry had told Ginny and Ron about him and Draco. Surprisingly, things were pretty normal between all of them. Of course, no one ever mentioned Draco or anything Malfoy related. Until, today that is.
I woke up to a soft pare of lips pressing against my forehead. I fluttered my eyes open and saw my boyfriend smiling at me.
"I've had enough fun at the park." Draco said, grabbing Harry's arm and apparating back to his house.
"Get as many of them done in one day as we can. That way we get it out of the way and we don't have to worry about it anymore."
"Harry, I am sorry. I didn't realize I was annoying you.... I-" Draco stopped, trying to think of what to say next. All the while, Harry was half way done with his tea, and he could feel rage boiling up inside of him.
"Hermione and Ginny helped me set it up right before I came to get you." Harry said, feeling a small blush fill his face.
"If you are found guilty of any of these allegations, you will immediatly be sent to Azkaban. Knowing this, is there anything you would like to say to defend yourself?"
"Draco?" Harry said. He had apparated into my living room without me noticing. "Are you okay? You look upset."
"Well, everywhere we go is in the muggle world. We've gone to the zoo, we went to the beach, and I taught him how to ride a bike."
Without hesitation, Draco took all of Harry in his mouth, swirling his tongue around Harry, making Harry let out a shaky moan. Draco began to quickly bob his head, Harry letting out quiet and shaky moans.
Instead of answering, Draco stood up and sat on the bench next to Harry. Draco places one of his hands on Harry's thigh and the other in the younger's hair.
"They got out between 2:30 and 3:00 in the morning. No one had entered the building since 7:30 and that person left at 8:00. The person didn't even go to the floor they were on so it isn't likely, but we're still working on figuring out who it was, just in case. There are no witnesses that we know of and no one has reported anything suspicious going on."
Draco pulled Harry's jeans off of his body, sending goosebumps down Harry's body. Draco straddled Harry and pulled his shirt off of his body, tracing his fingers over Harry's defined abs. Harry tried to move his hands to pull Draco's shirt off, but his hands stayed glued to their spot.
Severus motioned for all of them to leave, Narcissa going back to Malfoy Manner and the others going back into the hidden spot in the wall.
Narcissa Malfoy apparated away and left Draco standing in the door. He closed the door and walked back into the living room.
Harry apparated into Draco's living room and was shocked to find him in a long sleeved shirt. In summer. When they were going roller skating. At an outdoor roller rink.
"If it makes you feel any better," Hermione started. "I got really annoyed and told him that I'm part Malfoy."
"I don't know. I'm pretty good at Quidditch, but I'm not sure if I'm good enough. I wouldn't mind teaching Potions at Hogwarts, either."
I watched as Harry told his story about the Dementors attacking him and his cousin. He was so animated. It was kinda like watching a kid in a candy store. What was even funnier was that Umbridge had been there! Then, i remembered I was once on her side.
"I love you, Harry. I love you so damn much. It hurts how much I love you. It hurts me to see you hurt, It hurts me to see you worry. It hurts me to see you anything other than happy. I've never felt like this for anyone else. Never. You need to realize that this is how I feel and nothing is changing that."
Ron and Romilda: Ron ended up marrying Romilda Vane. Funny since he accidentally ate her love potion in their sixth year. Ron and Romilda have two kids, Hunter Weasley and Rose Weasley. Hunter is 13 and also in his third year with James. Rose is eight like Lily, and can't go to Hogwarts yet.
She spun the time turner in the opposite direction. I watched as time went forward and I started recognizing things. Before I knew it, we were back where we had left off.
Draco looked at Harry, sensing that he knew more then he was letting on, but decided not to dig any deeper.
Draco watched the younger slowly get out of bed and waddle over to him. Draco tried not to laugh, but it didn't work.
"Yeah. Think about it like this, Draco probably doesn't want to do it either. If he brings us, he'll have an excuse to not really talk to them."
Draco's face lit up as he finally tried a bite, shocked by the fact it was even edible, let alone actually tasting good.
Harry fell to his knees as he broke down in tears. Draco immediately joined his lover on the ground. Slowly, Draco put his arms around Harry, scared that he would protest at any moment. When Harry didn't say anything, Draco pulled the boy into his chest. Harry buried his head into Draco's chest and sobbed. Draco stared at Hermione, silently begging her to help him. Hermione stared back at Draco, looking competly lost.
The three stayed away for awhile. Harry and Draco cuddling while Hermione was across from them. They only left when they heard Narcissa calling Draco's name.
"Thanks you, Minister." I turned to face Draco. 'Don't worry', I mouthed. "It would be crazy not to admit that Draco has committed several crimes against Wizards and Witches." I said as I turned to face the crowd. "And I'm saying this simply because it is the truth. But there are two sides to every story. In this case, it was not Draco who wanted to do the things he did; it was his father.
"Draco, I can see you're beyond happy. I'm happy that you found someone that can make you feel that way. I don't care if it isn't s female."
When they appeared in Draco's house, Draco immediately felt Harry's lips press against his cheek. Draco pulled Harry closer to him and pressed a kiss to his lips. The two didn't want to pull away, so they deepened the kiss until there was no more room left between them. Harry felt Draco's tongue flick across his bottom lip and he happily let Draco have the entrance. Draco's tongue filled Harry's mouth and the two fought for dominance. Rather quickly, Harry decided to give up, letting Draco explore every crevice of his mouth. Draco slowly started to pull out of the kiss. Draco bit down on Harry's bottom lip, causing Harry to let out a small whimper. Draco smirked as he started trailing kisses down Harry's jawline and neck. Draco started leaving hickeys along Harry's neck. Harry quietly whimpered as Draco sucked along his neck, feeling his bulge grow in his pants.
"I think you forget that I was literally called the Slytherin Prince. Everything you just said makes perfect sense."
"And it is not by my choice that I leave. But I love my husband too much to leave him. And I love him so much that I don't want to risk him leaving me. But, my dear cousin, I will never forget you for you will always be in my thoughts. Goodbye, Leta. I love you."
He stood up and brushed off his robes. With one last look at me, he apparated out of my living room.
The family saw Ron standing with Romilda and Hermione standing with Gregory. Aurora ran foward, heading towards Hermione to see her daughter Iris. Hugo stood back, waiting for James to reach him before giving him a breif hug. Lily, on the other hand, ran towards Ron and Romilda's daughter Rose.
'Stop! You shouldn't be noticing these things!'  a voice in the back of my head said. But I ignored it. At this point, I was used to noticing these things. Now, I just let it happen.
"I suppose that is fine. But do everyone a favor, don't talk about this at the Ministry. Wormtail isn't dead and he sneaks into your office everyday to 'gather information.' So unless you want this whole plan to be a bust, it'd be best to keep your mouth shut until I tell him to stop going to the Ministry."
"It's going well. Ms. Chang proved more helpful than we thought she would be. And it has come to our attention that Harry and Draco are in a romantic relationship."
Draco apparated to his house and put on the only swim suit he owned. When he came back to Harry's, he saw the younger putting towels into a bag.
While Draco found his father and talked to him, Harry and Ron ended up going to Azkaban to see if the security really was a problem.
Draco and I were sitting on his couch, cuddling, when Hermione apparated into the living room. Draco and I smiled from our spots on the couch.
"Y-you're welcome here anytime. I know I was a prick to you and Granger and Weasley, but I'd like to try to turn over a new leaf."
Two weeks had gone by since Hermione and Ginny's meet up with some of their fieinds, and everything was still going normally. The two assumed that they were in the clear.
We spent the next two hours telling each other stories. Well, telling each other different things we went through. From scary to embarrassing to sad. We told each other everything.
"Hermione came here and told me she wanted to end things with you. She asked me for my advice and I gave her some. Then she complained that I wasn't helpful. But from the looks of it, she did what I told her to do."
Harry tried to warn Draco, but nothing but a loud moan came out as he came all over himself and Draco. The sight made Draco start pounding into Harry even harder. Harry let out another loud moan as he felt Draco cum inside of him.
"Well, you obviously can't so I have to pick up your slack." Hermione said, with a playful smirk on her face.
Draco pushed Harry against a wall and started to unbutton the top few buttons of his shirt. Draco placed his lips on the bit of exposed skin on Harry's chest. He left a few marks on the brunette before pulling his lips off of the boy.
"It's just for today. Their usual partners are gone and I need people who I know can adapt quickly. So please, just do this."
The couple ate in a comfortable silence, Harry insisting upon washing the dishes once they were done.
He was always animated, though. He told his stories confidently and with lots of passion behind them. I noticed his eyes would glisten when he was either really happy and really passionate.
"You're a git, you know? I don't even know why I like you." Harry said as Draco helped him up the stairs.
It had been twenty minutes and he heard a whimper come from his room. Draco chuckled and put his book back. He walked back to his room and saw Harry sitting up in bed.
"Because, I see the good in you. I saw it that night when you tried to kill Dumbledore. I saw it when you didn't tell the death eaters that it was me they found. I saw it when you hesitated to rejoin to death eaters. I saw it when you ran away from the final battle. I saw it when you let me and Hermione into your house. I saw it when you told me I could come see you anytime. I saw it when you helped me find Hermione. I know you're not bad because I've seen so much good in you. And whether you like it or not, I'm helping you."
Once he was changed, he waved his wand and created a fake ID. After making sure it looked real, Harry put it in his pocket and walked out of his house. He apparated into New York City and hailed a cab.
"Oh. It's really quite easy. We got a tip that there are some Death Eaters roaming around in Knockturn Alley. We're just going to see if it's true so we can actually do something later."
"Alright. Then I bet 3 Galleons that he messes up but 'Mione doesn't mind and everything goes according to plan."
Hermione and Gregory: This one is the most shocking, but Hermione ended up with Goyle. Anyways, Draco's friends started spending more time with Harry's friends and Hermione and Goyle ended up getting pretty close.... Plus they had met before when The Golden Trio got reassigned for a day. Hermione got assigned to Goyle. Anyways, they have two kids, Hugo and Iris. Hugo is 13 and in his third year with Hunter and James. Iris is nine and is not in Hogwarts yet, but will go one year sooner than Rose and Lily.
"It's been a month and a half, nothing has happened and we're no closer to figuring anything out." Harry said.
Draco and Harry both chuckled as James and Aurora came down the stairs, trunks in hand and owls in their cages.
"I have contacted the Death Eaters who are not in Azkaban and they are all coming here to discuss the details of the plan. Go gather the food and set it out. We need to be as friendly as possible if we want all of them on our side."
Draco couldn't stop the smile small from appearing on his face when he heard Harry say this. He stopped arguing and let Harry lead him through Paris, When they finally came to an ice cream shop, they each got their own cups but ended up sharing. When Draco took Harry's hand, he expected them to apparate again. When they stated in Paris, Draco was confused but he decided not to ask.
"It should be in the next few days. But please don't count on that. The ministry is still getting a lot of things back together so everything is a bit hectic."
Draco cupped Harry's face in his hands and held it right in front of his, making sure Harry couldn't look away from him.
It had been two weeks since Draco and Harry last saw each other. Harry wanted to see Draco, but he wasn't sure if Draco wanted to see him. Draco wanted to see Harry, but he thought he scared him away. The two were both upset about the other person. Harry threw himself into work and Draco stopped talking to everyone, even his mother.
Draco felt confused as he watch Harry dance with the other guy. The guy's crotch was against Harry's ass and they were both looking aroused. As Draco slowly walked closer, he could make out small grunts and moans coming from both of them as they continued to dance. When Draco got close enough to Harry, Harry noticed him.
"Well, he has this family reunion that he wants me to go to, but I'm not sure if I should go. I don't know how I feel about being surrounded by a bunch of Malfoys. No offence, 'Mione."
"Ginny, I'm bisexual. I've known it for years. But, I was scared to come out. I apologize, but I used not only you but Cho to hide it. All these years, I feel like I have established a relationship with you, just not a romantic one. I completely understand if you hate me. And I'm not going to beg you to forgive me because I know it's entirely up to you. I'm with Draco. I've like him for quite some time and he likes me. We've been talking for a few weeks and we decided to become official yesterday. That is why I haven't talked to you since the war. I've been spending time with Draco."
"Come on, let's just tell them. It'll come out sooner or later. And we're all mature here." Ginny said, looking at Hermione.
"I could be worse. I mean, I lost so many people and so much has happened. But if we weren't here, I couldn't have gotten revenge on Voldemort. I mean, sure, he's done messed up stuff to everyone. But because of him both of my parents are dead, I almost died at least twenty times, I had to live with the Dursleys, and I lost almost all the people closest to me. But I killed a man, Hermione! That'll change you forever! I just, I don't know how to feel right now."
"You just made your mother and probably Rodolphus mad just to keep your promise to Harry." Hermione said.
Hermione's jaw dropped but she stayed quiet and shook her head. Harry quickly grabbed Ron's arm and apparated to Malfoy Manner. They walked to the door and Harry knocked. It didn't take long for Narcissa to open the door.
Harry giggled at his boyfriends cuteness and took the lock. He quickly attached it to the bridge and looked back at Draco
"There is a difference between mad and annoyed. But keep it up. You're on the fast track to me getting mad."
"I'm not dark. He's just always been rude to me and Ron and Hermione. I feel like by keeping him I can silently rub it in his face that he's stuck with this life."
"I know it hurts. But soon, you'll feel better and you'll realize that it was probably for the better."
The three of us silently stepped inside the house. Ron motioned for Ginny to stay on the main floor while we went up the stairs.
Ginny chuckled, but really felt worried about the information she had stupidly given away getting out.
"Oh." I felt my face get red. "Well, he's very clingy. He loves to spend as much time as he can with me. It's quite cute. He's also very kind and caring. He's there every time I need him and he always know exactly what to say. He takes me places in the muggle world so I can understand his life better. I honestly trust him with my life. We tell each other everything, no matter how sad, happy, good, bad, or ugly. And I love the way his eyes always sparkle. Especially when he's happy. I love him a lot. And his looks are a plus." I said, forgetting that I was with my mother.
The four of them all set up everything in a matter of two minutes. They were sliding their wands back into their pockets when the first few people apparated into the pavilion.
"Harry, if I'm horny, I'm making you do something about it. I'm not gonna touch myself when I have a perfectly good boyfriend."
Harry felt the familiar feeling of an orgasm building in the base of his stomach. Right before he came, Draco pulled off of Harry, leaving Harry whimpering as his length throbbed.
"I should go now. Draco and I were supposed to go out, but I feel like I should go tell him what's going on."
Draco bit Harry's lower lip, Harry happily opening his mouth to give Draco the entrance he desired. Draco's tongue felt every crevice of Harry's mouth before finally colliding with Harry's tongue, the two fighting for dominance, Draco winning.
Ron and I went to opposite ends of the hallway and silently opened doors. The first room was empty. I looked at Ron and saw he didn't find anything either. We moved to the next doors. If Harry wasn't in any of these rooms and he wasn't downstairs, then we would have no clue where he is.
"Then why can't you be!? I was being serious when I said Ron and Hermione could come back any second. I don't want to get caught or interrupted while doing anything intimate. But you just had to keep joking. And then you just kept joking after. While I was trying to look out for us, all you could do was think about yourself and be irritating."
As Harry and Hermione neared the house, Harry got more and more nervous. He honestly thought he was going to thrrow up. Despite this, he thought he looked calm.
"Thank you for all you have done, Harry. I really do appreciate it. You've allowed me to keep my Draco with me and saved me a trip to Azkaban. If there is anything I can ever do to repay you, I will surely do it."
When Harry and Ron finally walked into the hallway, they ran right into Draco. Ron walked around the blonde, but Harry and Draco stared at each other for some time.
"And I'm trying to make sure my boyfriend makes it home safely." Draco said rudely before pulling Harry out of the club and back to the streets of New York.
Harry grabbed Draco's arm and apparated to a park. He had actually did research so he could take Draco to a big, fun park. He didn't necessarily know where he was, he just knew that he was at a park somewhere in the country.
"Yes it does. Some Death Eaters who haven't been caught make some Polyjuice, somehow manage to get my hair or something, use it, goes to Azkaban, and then people escape. It's clearly related, I just don't know how."
Harry quickly pushed his lips onto Draco's. When he tried to pull away, Draco's brought his hand to Harry's head, letting his fingers get tangled in the boy's messy hair.
The line moved quicky, and it wasn't more than ten minutes later Draco was entering the club. He walked around, trying to find Harry.
"Harry is the reason Draco and I aren't in Azkaban right now. Therefore, I am in great debt to him. As this fact stands and he is friends with my son, he is to be welcomed here. As for his friend, she is welcome as well."
Harry left Draco's room. He returned a few minutes later wearing a light blue button up shirt that was fitted and black jeans with white shoes.
Harry split the food in half with Hermione watching them. Once they had started eating, Hermione left.
"Because, I don't really know if I feel comfortable being 100% surrounded by a bunch of people I don't know."
"Draco, I have something very important to ask you. You I need you to be completely honest with me."
"No, she didn't. I faked my death. I healed myself. I didn't want to risk being thrown in Azkaban because I had no one to preach for me, saying I'm good. So I figured, the only way to ensure not having to go was to let everyone assume I am dead."
Draco hastily pushed his lips onto Harry's, said male meting into the kiss and throwing his arms around his boyfriend's neck.
"Please don't be mad at me! I don't think you did anything. I just wanted to know if you knew or saw or heard anything that could be kinda questionable."
"All I've ever wanted is for you to be happy. Whether it's with me or not, doesn't really matter. Yes, I would've preferred if it were with me, but I'll get over it. I'm happy for you. Really."
Harry impatiently placed his hands on Draco's waist and played with the hem of his boyfriend's boxers. Draco smirked at the boy's hastiness. Draco quickly removed the last of the clothes on both of their bodies and straddled his boyfriend. His boyfriend stared at him, waiting for something to happen.
Starting to get impatient, Draco pulled his fingers out of Harry, beginning to put lube on himself. Once Draco had put lube onto himself and Harry, he aligned himself with Harry. He slowly pushed himself in, knowing the male under him would still be tight. Harry whined as Draco pushed himself into him, not caring about any pain he was in.
Hermione looked away from Ginny, feeling a pit in her stomache, but allowing Ginny to speak anyways.
"Okay, but you don't hate me. You love me." Draco said after he had finished the last bite of his eggs.
"You shouldn't have used that spell in the first place! It's completely made up! The fact that you used it once is bad enough! And now, you-"
"Malfoy Manner. See if Narcissa Malfoy has seen or heard anything. And talk to Draco too. His father is one of the escaped persons. He could be a person of interest as well."
"What! This is rubbish! Yesterday at 7:30 I was here! With you! How do you not remember that! I made us dinner again!"
Harry didn't have time to whine as Draco flipped them over, Harry now straddling his boyfriend's hips.
"So, we've told you what's going on with us. So, why don't you tell us what's been happening with you?" Cho said.
Harry quickly aligned himself with Draco, sitting onto his boyfriend's length. Harry and Draco both moaned as Harry started to bounce on Draco, spreading his legs even further so he could get deeper. After he did this, Draco hit his prostate, Harry crying out in immense pleasure.   Draco started thrusting his hips to match Harry, hitting his prostate dead on every time.
Inside the house, Draco was snapped out of his thoughts when there was a knock on the door. Draco slowly got up and walked towards the door. He was shocked to see Harry Potter and Hermione Granger on the other side.
Back at the ambush sight, the number of Death Eaters that lay around was steadily decreasing as they all got take to Azkaban.
Draco smirked before lightly tracing his pointer finger down Harry's length, making Harry shakily take in a breath. Draco then licked Harry's tip, making Harry whimper.
"And, we uh, saw something interesting. We found out my grandmother was a squib. She fell in love with a man with the last name Granger. They got married and ran away together. They had my dad and he was born a squib, which was good because she never told my grandfather about her true heritage. Then, when my father had me, I was born a witch."
Sure enough, Harry felt himself relaxing. The tears that wanted to fall disappeared and he took a deep breath.
"I never said you had to become perfect at it. And I never said you had to do it now. It's something to work on."
"I did mean it. I haven't really talked to anyone since the war. I would enjoy someone's company. Especially someone who, I don't know...."
"No. I just think it's ironic that Hermione came here to ask Harry for help and complained that he was no help, but she took his advice." Draco said.
"Hermione, you know I'm not good at this kind of stuff. You just need to sit down with him and have a talk and tell him."
"But if they used Polyjuice, why would they stop three floors below your dad? They were obviously trying to make you look bad, so why stop without doing anything really incriminating?"
"Wormtail, we are starting the next phase of the plan. You are to stop going to the Ministry everyday." Severus said.
"Oh no, not at all. But she looked so.... sick. I didn't want to push her too much and have her not tell us anything at all. I'll see if Draco will talk to her and get more information."
Draco placed his lips onto Harry's and didn't pull away. They didn't seem to care not that they were in public. The kiss didn't last too long. When they pulled away, they were wearing identical smiles.
"Draco Malfoy. You are being accused of treason, foul play in the form of supporting Voldemort, and attempting to murder of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. Do you deny any of these allegations?"
Harry laughed and quickly explained how each appliance worked. Draco looked fascinated as he started at them.
"Look, go home. I'll be there as soon as I get done with all of this and we can cuddle as much as you want."
After a few thrusts to his prostate, Harry couldn't keep going. His legs started to shake from the effort he was putting in. Draco noticed this and switched their positions once more, Harry's ass now in the air as Draco thrust into him from behind.
"The whole thing, some of the Death Eaters escaping, is a ploy to trap all of the remaining Death Eaters that are free and get them all in Azkaban." Hermione said.
"He, uh, tried to stop me from going back to Hogwarts in our second year. And while we were at school he kept doing stuff. And then I, uh, I tricked your dad into freeing him."
Harry let out loud moans as Draco continued thrusting into him at the same speed, the sounds of moans and skin slapping filling the room. Just as Harry felt his orgasm coming on again, Draco pulled out of him.
I went back to Draco's house after the trials. He sat down on the couch and motioned me to sit next to him.
"I knew that they liked each other. And I knew that they had been going out on dates. I didn't know that this was going to happen, though."
Right now, the boys were getting back from bowling. Draco lost, but he didn't really care. Harry looked so cute and happy when he had beat him.
"W-Well... It wasn't on purpose. I think someone put something in my drink. Because I told someone about... Harry and Draco."
'Shut up brain! Stop noticing these things! Even if they do make him look and seem so beautiful, you will not notice them! Wait, what am I thinking? BRAIN! STOP IT RIGHT NOW!'
" I know. But you're always cooking and working and teaching me about the muggle world. I wanted to do something for you."
I was at the Leaky Cauldron and I got a Butterbeer and I sat down and some person I don't know sat down across from me. He kinda scared me, so I was trying to get away. I went to the bathroom to get myself together and when I came back, he was gone. I drank my Butterbeer quickly and I left. But when I was walking, I started to feel funny and the creepy guy came back. I don't remember what happened after that, but the next think I remember is that I was in a dark room and there were quiet voices. And then things went black again, and then I remember hearing people talking about Harry and Draco. And then the next thing I remember is waking up in my room with almost no memories."
"Good. Narcissa, go back home. You must not raise any suspicion. You need to eat more, start getting more sleep. If people find out about us and it's your fault, you might want to find a very good hiding spot."
I patted the seat next to me and Harry quickly sat down. He squirmed around in the seat a little until he got comfortable. When he was done, his knee was touching mine and his hand was inches from mine. My knee tingled from where he was touching me. I bit back a smile.
"He's telling his other friends, Ronald Weasely and Hermione Granger, which is good. Harry seems to be in agreement with the plan, which means his friends will agree too."
'It has been revealed that Death Eaters Lucius Malfoy, Corban Yaxley and Fenrir Greyback have escaped from Azkaban. Along with them, Dolores Umbridge had also escaped from the prison. The Ministry has not commented yet on the situation.'
I smiled, but not a fake smile because I was trying to be nice. A real, genuine smile because he said that he worries about me. And for whatever reason, that made me happier than not being sent to Azkaban.
"Does it look like I care!?" Harry yelled, trying to get his point across. "You're not even supposed to know about any of this! I am not letting you risk your own safety by coming to an ambush we've set up with a bunch of Death Eaters! Your parents will be there! You used to be a Death Eater! It will not end well for you, I promise you! Please just stay here where I know you'll be out of harm's way!"
"Kingsley came in before you got here. He uhh, he wants us to take the lead with this because 'We have the most firsthand experience with them' or some rubbish like that."
Draco pulled me into his chest and wrapped his arms around me. I tried to blink back my tears, but that only resulted in them falling.
"I'm sorry, baby. I didn't mean to push you away like that. My mom scared me, that's all. I love you."
These days, Draco had so many thoughts he couldn't keep track of them all. Harry almost had the same problem. But whenever he had an important thought, he put it in the Pensieve.
Draco smiled and put his arms back around me. I put my arms around his torso and burried my head in his chest, taking in his scent.
He already had all of the details worked out and he had heard back from Harry. They were all in agreement and had worked everything out.  He just needed to make sure everything went according to plan.
Hermione handed the boys her lunch box and Harry opened it. Ron made a dive for the food but Harry snatched it away.
He climbed through the portrait hole and was shocked to see the common room still in tact. A few things were broken and out of place but for the most part, it was perfect.
"Out to the car, kids. You don't want to be late to King's Cross." Draco said, all three of their kids hurrying out to the house. As Harry tried to follow behind them, Draco grabbed his wrist and pulled him back.
"Kingsley, we have some very important information for you. This will completely crack the case wide open." Harry said.
"You don't have to question Draco." Hermione said. "You and Ron go to Malfoy Manner, I'll go to Draco's house. I'll explain what is happening and that you didn't want to be the one the question him and I'm sure everything will end up just fine."
When he saw I was no longer mad, the glimmer in his eyes returned and he continued with his story. I loved to watch him as he got excited for a certain part or when his eyes sparkled with emotion or when he talked with hands to create emphasis.
Draco quickly put one of his arms around Harry's waist and pulled him onto his side, placing a small kiss on top of his head.
"We're good. We started talking about moving in together. We just don't know if I would move in with him or if he would move in with me."
Harry watched silently as his boyfriend walked around the kitchen, making food that smelled amazing. Harry smiled as Draco piled two plates high with spaghetti.
Harry laid down on the couch, putting his head in Draco's lap. Draco ran his fingers through Harry's already messy hair. Harry hummed in response, letting his eyes close as he relaxed.
"I know. Before, I was terrified of what someone would've thought of my feelings. But now that we're out of school and we we've seen Draco's true colors, I'm gonna be a little more open.
"Tom killed himself by not listening when I told him that the Elder Wand would not work for him." Harry said, getting visibly annoyed.
Harry threw Draco one of his bigger t-shirts and it fit Draco. Harry grabbed the bag that had towels and his wallet and grabbed Draco's hand. The two apparated to a place called Coral Reef Bracknell's Waterworld. Harry confunded the lady at the desk so she would let them in. Draco looked around like a kid in a candy store. Harry smiled fondly at his boyfriend and grabbed his hand, pulling him towards one of the swimming pools. Harry set their stuff by the pool and took his t-shirt off. Draco copied Harry and set his shirt in Harry's bag.
Harry apparated into Draco's living room, scaring Draco. When Draco realized it was Harry, he felt both happy and annoyed.
Harry touched my shoulder. I looked at him and saw his eyes already on me. His eyes filled with worry, but still glimmering.
Draco nudged Harry's side and the messy haired boy looked up at the blonde. Draco motioned for them to go to the playground. Harry tugged on the sleeve of Hermione's robes and the three of them walked away.
All the while, Narcissa stood outside and watched the two boys. Even though she already knew, she was still shocked to see how close the two really were. That would explain the trials and the reunion. But why wouldn't Draco tell her?
"Corvus. Leta. Newt. Newt, Newt, Newt... Scamander! The author of 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'. And his older brother, Theseus Scamander, who was engaged to Leta Lestrange. And, my Granny! They were all alive and around the same age in that time period! Oh my god!"
"He doesn't accept it. He doesn't want to be friends." I whispered with tears welling back up in my eyes.
The two walked through the door as my mother sat down. This trial seemed to go on longer than both me and my mother's. After almost an hour, Harry came out.
Harry felt increasing panic when he still got no response. He apparated to his house and heard noise coming from in the kitchen. He pulled out his wand and quietly creeped towards the kitchen.
"We have no clue when they'll be back. What if they apparate in while we're in the middle of... Uhh, some rated R actions? What would happen then?"
I walked through Malfoy manner until I reached the huge dining room. My mom already sat in the room with a plate of food in front of her. She smiled when she saw me.
Draco smiled when he saw me apparate into his living room. It was Monday and I had just finished work.
"So you mean to tell me, that Draco was home with you all night, and you just forgot?" Hermione asked.
"He was. He was just gonna wait until he knew exactly what was going on between them. So my guess is sooner rather than later, he'll tell you. And when he does, you will not tell you saw that. You will be supportive and be happy for him."
"At some point this week, we'll take you to Magical Menagerie so you can get your own owl." Harry promised.
"It's been a month and a half, nothing has happened, and we're no closer to figuring anything out." Harry said to Hermione and Ron.
Draco stayed at Harry's house, hoping he'd come back. He nervously sat around for an hour, and nothing.
Draco started leaving butterfly kisses on Harry's neck, lightly sucking on some places as he made his way down Harry's defined chest and to where his underwear started.
Draco picked Harry up and placed him on some of the open counter, letting his hands rest on Harry's thighs.
"We'll be with you the whole time." Draco said. "I'll do everything I can to keep my family out of your grill. And if at any point you want to leave, I'll do everything I can to get you out of there. I promise. Everything will be fine."
THERE WILL BE SMUT IN THIS CHAPTER! THERE WILL NOT BE AN ACTUAL WARNING RIGHT BEFORE IT HAPPENS SO JUST SKIP TO THE VERY END OF THE CHAPTER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ IT. THERE WILL BE A BRIEF OVERVEIW OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE CHAPTER
"He's been more of a father to me than my real father. When I found out he was dead, I was crushed. But, he isn't."
"All right. Is there anyone else who wishes to speak?" the minister asked. There was a few seconds of silence before the minister said, "We shall now vote. All those in favor of clearing all charges from the accused name and setting him free?" I couldn't bring myself to look. "And all those in favor of charging the accused and sending him to Azkaban?" Still, I couldn't look. I kept my eyes on Draco as he stared back at me. "Very well then. Draco Malfoy, you are freed."
"This is sweet and all, but can one of you stun this stupid Death Eater!?" Hermione yelled, Harry throwing a quick stunning spell at the Death Eater.
Draco quickly walked to his room and threw open his closet. Harry stood there looking at everything before pulling out an outfit and handing it to his boyfriend.
It had been a few hours since I had seen Harry. He said he was going to something called 'The Burrow.' He said he'd be back when he was done, but it's been hours.
"He doesn't know we came here or that Hermione and you are related. If I went to him, I'd have to explain why she's nowhere to be found. And let's just say, he wouldn't take it very well."
"He's already fucking mad at me for asking if he heard anything! And now that idiot wants me to question him!? Could this day get any better!?"
All of us are smart individuals, so tell me, does that really make any sense? I've said all I need to say. The power is in your hands. I just beg that you make the smart choice. There is one quote that I like. It goes something like this; 'The right choice isn't always the easiest. This is why so many people make the wrong decision.' With that, I leave you to make your decision."
"We already have the meeting and ambush set up. In exactly one week, we will go to a muggle park, where the Death Eaters will then go because they will have received information that we are there. In reality, there will be a bunch of Aurors hidden around, waiting for a signal to bust all of them. And, they'll have no idea what's coming because they think we'll be completely unsuspecting."
It was fun to watch Harry when he told his stories. When he was telling his scary stories, you could see the fear in his eyes. He still felt the fear he felt then. When he told me something embarrassing, he would always turn slightly pink. As if reliving it was just as bad as it happening. And he would always watch me nervously to see my reactions. When he told sad stories, you could tell he meant every word of what he was saying. Despite the small smile, you could see the pain written all over his face. You can't fake that kind of emotion.
"I was in the muggle world, Ginny. I vistited my parents again." Hermione lied, not wanting to admit who she was really with.
You probably thought Draco and Harry were going to break up, didn't you?? Well nope, they are still together and going strong. And I plan on keeping it that way for awhile.
Draco smirked at the boy and kissed down his neck and chest. He paused when he reached Harry's pants. He palmed Harry's length through his pants, earning a small grunt from the boy.
"I-I can't believe I just did that. I-I vowed never to use that spell again. He... Snape is the only one who knows how to reverse it. He-he's gonna die. I just killed him. Oh my god. I can't-"
Harry leaned forward and gave Draco a quick peck on the cheek. Draco pulled the boy back and gave him a loving kiss on his lips.
"I decided after living in Malfoy Manor and everything that happened in there, I wanted my own place. And that I wanted it to be very different."
"Harry. I see the hickey on your neck. You clearly did more than go to dinner and spend time in Paris."
"Because, I know you are now affiliated with Harry Potter. He needs to know this information, but I'm not quite sure what he'd do if he just saw me. I'm hoping-"
I made my way up the many step that lead to Ron's room. I knocked on the door. When he opened the door, he looked shocked to see me.
After a few more moments of just hugging Harry, Draco began to place light kisses on the parts of Harry's neck he could reach.
Hermione was getting quite anxious. Harry looked very scared and she wasn't sure if their plan would work.
Harry just stared at Draco as he opened and closed his mouth, trying to come up with the right words to say.
"I love you, Harry. I would never do anything that could hurt us. I promise you, I have nothing to do with this."
"Wormtail, go. See if they know anything." Severus said, not bothering to look at the meek male he spoke to.
"Hi, mother." I said, noticing how terrible she looked. She looked like she hadn't gotten sleep in days. She was much thinner than anyone should ever be.
"You have really hit the jackpot with this, you three." Kingsley said. "I'll alert the Aurors and tell them that it is of the upmost importance that this information stays 100% classified. I'll let them know when and where, and that you three will be in charge."
"I had to go with Romilda Vane to Godric's Hollow. We basically did the same thing as you." Ron said.
Draco began to slowly move his finger, trying to loosen up the younger male. Once Harry's walls had started to open, Draco added another finger, scissoring the male. Harry's whimpers began to get louder, turning into whines. Draco smirked as he added a third finger, Harry starting to squirm and let out quiet moans.
"Remember, you get will get your three meals at the same time everyday. So don't bother me for food."
"We must be very, very cautious. No one can catch wind of what we're doing. The only people who can know are us. Do not tell you son, Lucius. Especially since he seems to have a relationship with Harry Potter. Fenrir, don't be stupid. Don't get yourself caught. Dolores, same to you. Yaxely, well I know you won't do anything stupid. And Wormtail, continue transforming and getting information for us. But be careful, Harry Potter and his other friends know about you."
Lucius scoffed. "Poor Harry Potter, such an amazing person, who got taken down because he was too naive to see the attack coming his way."
Harry showed Draco exactly how to make not burnt toast and told Draco to try it. Draco stared nervously at the toaster, silently willing the bread to come out perfectly.
Draco couldn't stop the huge smile from spreading across his face. The couple kissed each other passionately. Hermione smiled down at the two, happy that Harry had seen the good in Draco and gotten him.
"He liked the dinner. A lot. Kreacher made really good food. He enjoyed Paris, too. He liked the love lock. And uh... yeah. We had a lot of fun."
"I don't know." Ginny replied honestly. "But at least if they want to say something, there are other people that know so they can talk about it to those people."
"Well, the ministry just wanted us to come by and see if you had any information. Have you seen or heard anything about your husband?"
"W-well. It's just when Ron had taken me on that date. I-I started thinking... Well.... Harry, I can't be with Ron anymore. It just, doesn't feel right. I liked it better when we were just friends."
Harry chuckled as he pulled out his wand. Immediately, my hands felt less sticky and my hair less clumpy.
The two didn't bother putting anything back on. They wrapped themselves in each other and quickly fell asleep.
Two weeks. Two weeks since The Battle of Hogwarts. Since Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy had last seen each other. Since Draco and Harry's lives had changed forever.
"Draco, stop apologizing for stupid stuff you did at school. I understand. We hated each other. Everything is fine."
"It's okay, Dray." Harry said, moving one of his hands back to find Draco's. Draco happily took his boyfriend's hand and squeezed it.
On Monday, Harry left Draco's and went to work. His hickeys were still visible despite the fact they had already started fading. He tried his best to hide all of them, but there was still one that refused to stay hidden, no matter how he adjusted his clothes.
Harry put the pot he was rinsing down and turned off the water in the sink, turning around in his boyfriend's hold.
"I'm sorry, Dray. I don't know why I decided of all places to go, to go to a club in New York. I just wanted to forget your stupidness for awhile."
Seeing as Harry was on top, he could choose when he started pleasuring himself. After a few more minutes of making out, Harry started to thrust his hips. Draco grunted as Harry continued this motion.
Harry felt himself melting under his boyfriend, as Draco continued to pound into him, hitting his prostate.
Harry helped the bigger boy up and helped stabilize him. As soon as he let go of Draco's arm, Draco grabbed Harry's arm. He clung to Harry as they went around the rink.
The three of us silently stepped inside the house. Ron motioned for Ginny to stay on the main floor while we went up the stairs.
The boys ended up falling asleep on the couch. When Narcissa saw this, she finally left. Draco and Harry slept cuddling all night. When Draco woke up, he smiled when he noticed his boyfriend still in his arms.
Narcissa sighed and apparated to her son's house. She knocked on the door and heard rustling around inside. A few minutes passed before Draco opened the door.
Draco sat on the couch, flipping through channels on the tv when there was a knock on the door. He opened it and saw his mother standing on the doorstep.
Everyone looked at Cho, who just shook her head. They looked at Hermione next, who laughed when she saw her friends thought she was dating her best friend. They then looked at Romilda, knowing she tried to give Harry a love potion in the past. Romilda, like Cho, shook her head. Then, starting to feel desperate, they looked at Parvati, who went to the Yule Ball with Harry.
Draco started to panic, not knowing what to do. He wanted, no, needed to see Harry. He needed to apologize to his boyfriend and make sure he was okay.
Harry rubbed sun screen onto Draco's face, making sure it was completely rubbed into his face before putting sun screen on himself.
"I have left over fish and chips from my dinner last night. You two take them and eat them. They'll give you energy. I will just buy myself lunch later."
"Haha, very funny. Now really, what is it." Kingsley said, believung everything he just heard was a joke.
"For as cute a you two really are," Hermione started, causing the boys the jump. "can you not do this here?"
Everything got silent and Peter slowly creeped out from behind the desk he was hidden behind. He saw all of them still sitting there and quickly ran back into his hiding spot.
In truth, Narcissa was furious. Rodolphus was very important to her. But her love and care for her son overpowered that. And if Draco really did love Harry Potter and want to be with him, Narcissa wasn't going to make things difficult.
Draco and Harry looked at each other, both of them swooning over their youngest daughter's cuteness.
"Draco insisted on coming even though it's the dumbest idea ever. I finally just snapped and yelled at him so he'll probably be mad when I go home later."
"Oh, I do too. After seeing him in the battle and how he was on our side, I don't think he's that bad. Yes, he was quite mean to us but overall, I don't think he's a terrible person."
"Harry, I'm trying to be a good boyfriend here, but you're making it really hard." Draco said, dropping his arms from around me.
Hermione apparated away and I felt Draco's hand come up to my head. He started playing with my hair. He laid back on the couch, bringing me with him.
"Nothing much. She said she didn't know anything. She hasn't been to Azkaban to see Lucius and she hasn't heard anything about him since the Malfoy Family Reunion, and I already know everything about that."
"There are still Death Eaters out there. And I cannot be truly free until they are all gone. So, I helped them escape so other Death Eaters will think there is still hope for themselves. In reality, we will rally them all together, get them in one spot, I will leak the information, and I will get them all a one way ticket to Azkaban."
Draco pulled Harry off of the counter, Harry wrapping his legs around Draco's torso as Draco walked to Harry's room. Draco dropped Harry on his bed, pulling out his wand and magically making Harry's hands unable to move.
Just a little bit of information you'll need before you start reading this chapter. It has been a few weeks since the family reunion. Draco and Harry have basically been spending every moment they could together. They still hadn't told anyone else about them. Narcissa still hadn't mentioned her knowledge to her son.
Instead of going in raw like he often did because they were both impatient, Draco grabbed the lube he knew was in the drawer in the bed side table. Draco spread some of the liquid on his fingers and Harry's opening. Draco pushed one finger inside of Harry, feeling his walls clench around his finger.
"I was just wondering if Harry was still here. We were, uhh, supposed to hang out but he never showed up. He said he was coming here and I thought he could still be here."
