Harry put his head on his pillow and closed his eyes.
here for help, wasn’t he?
“You can’t be pureblood,” said Malfoy.
“I thought your mum said you couldn’t use your wand in your food.”
“Large.” Draco set another card on top of Harry’s.
Harry hadn’t really thought about that. The Greengrasses had been drunk, and even though Harry hadn’t been falling in love with Vinicius, pretending that he was had been far more pleasant than thinking about anything to do with Malfoy.
“My friends,” Harry said, sweeping his hand over the scene.
“Thanks,” Malfoy said again. “‘Not expecting anything in return.’ That’s a load of bollocks. I said forever, didn’t I? Did you think I was exaggerating?”
“Tail?” Harry was interested.  He really was, but he also wanted Draco to keep talking because it sounded so nice, and the room was warm and dark, and Harry was really very tired.
Buckbeak.  Harry had had no idea the scratches had been bad enough to scar.
“Oh. Is she . . . do you mean she’s gay as well?”
Malfoy took his arm away. “Astoria did it for me,” he said, snapping the sleeve down with a spell. This time, he buttoned the cuff.
“What if Travers wasn’t talking about Lestrange and Greyback?” Malfoy said, just to be a contrarian. “What if it’s . . . Dolohov? No one wants Dolohov.”
this.  He kept doing it, the lazy teasing, that low voice, the smirking and the knowing glances.  He did it more and more, every time, and Harry couldn’t stand it.  He couldn’t stand it.
Of course, Andromeda would forgive anything that child-Draco did or said; she might not have had first-hand experience with his “warped prejudice,” but she’d had experience enough with her sisters.  She would know what she was getting into—but that wasn’t what Harry was worried about.  The issue wasn’t whether Andromeda could forgive Draco.  The issue was whether Draco could forgive himself.
The first spells were exactly what Harry had taught, a standard exchange of attempts to disarm or disable, blocked by typical shield spells and counter-attacks. Then Harry got an Expelliarmus in, and remembered that this was why he still had control of the Elder Wand. That was enough distraction for Malfoy to use the hand-to-hand trick Harry had taught them well—Malfoy grabbing Harry’s wrist and jerking forward, turning as he did it, so that his body slid along Harry’s and behind.
Desperate, Harry went to the post office, scribbled Malfoy’s name on a parchment, then rolled it up, cast the tracking spell, and gave the scroll to an owl.  Too impatient to wait for the owl to return, Harry popped home for a broom, then activated the tracking spell, Apparating to follow the owl.  After ten minutes of flying, Harry knew where they were going.  Sending the owl back, Harry Apparated the rest of the way.
Harry pushed his glasses up. “I trust you, too.  For the record.”
“Potter,” read the first page, at the very top.
“Upset.”
“That’s not very nice for the squid,” Harry pointed out, once Draco had collected the ink.
,” Harry said.
“Auror
Harry made a strangled sound, wanting to laugh but sort of afraid he might burst into tears.  Draco was still covered in blood.  Harry could smell it on both of them, that pungent animal smell with the trace of metal underneath, like a butcher’s shop.
“Yes,” Harry agreed. “Yes, I’m into it; I’m into it. I’m into you in me.”
“I mean . . . I said, I tried to.”
Malfoy licked his lips again.
All the fight went out of Draco’s body, his features all going slack at once.  His mouth hung open.  “But—but she’s only thirty-
“Tell me if you don’t like it, Harry,” Draco whispered, still without touching him, forcing Harry’s insides to perform for him. “Just say the word.”
They were fighting, Harry realized, and Draco was protecting him with his body.
“I understand you haven’t had a therapist in a while. Did it feel okay, saying that this time?”
“They should have. My titles are better.”
“I’m imagining it inside me,” Harry whispered. “I’m imagining how deep you’ll get, how amazing it’s going to feel to have this beautiful dick in me, fucking me, filling me with your hot come—”
“Perhaps he likes Astoria.”
Harry turned away. “Why did you come out here?” This wasn’t the question he wanted.
Draco sucked in a breath. “I—you talking. Like that. That was—it was something else I imagined.”
“Yes, well.”  Malfoy sat down gingerly beside him at the table.  “I’m not in the habit of broadcasting my intentions.  I prefer to be unpredictable.”
“Malfoy,” Harry said, and Malfoy froze.
Doctor Sibanyoni was promising, despite the way his portkey turned Harry’s stomach over several times in his belly as it jolted him through space. Sibanyoni’s office was extremely cosy, filled with comfortable chairs and soft rugs, colourful paintings on the wall, and not a desk in sight. The first visit felt less like a therapy session and more like getting to know a new instructor who would be working at the Academy: the conversation was a little stilted, awkward, because they were strangers, but the focus was on getting to know each other and less about Harry’s specific troubles.
“The Academy,” Harry said. “When they hired me. Also, when I became one of the youngest wizards to cast a Patronus.”
Malfoy turned to her, smiling at her, then put his lips straight against her ear to repeat what Harry had said. This didn’t make him look very gay.
“To what do I owe this pleasure?”  Malfoy was leaning in the doorway, which seemed to be one of his favourite past-times.  He was standing by the door to the downstairs, which led to Potage’s Cauldron Shop, and he looked good.  Each time, Malfoy’s clothes were still a little nicer than they used to be, his hair a little shinier, his face a little fuller.  Fuck.  He looked too good.
“Could you . . . ?” Delicately, Malfoy’s tongue swiped across his upper lip. He was flushed right down into his white vest; he must be sweating. It wasn’t any wonder, with that heavy robe he had been wearing. “Um, could you—show me again?”
“Do you understand?”
Kavika smiled again. “I have a tendency to agree, but this is neither the time nor place for a proper analysis of the Malfoy family tree. Do you want to talk about Teddy being at Academy?”
“I wasn’t defending the viewpoint, Harry.”
“Not right now, you’re not.”
“Yeah,” he gasped. “Yeah, like that. Do me like that. Do me.”
As slowly as he’d taken down his hair, Draco began to smirk.  “Like it, do you?”
“But I started,” said Bennet.
“I’m still fine,” Harry said.
In the memories, Vance had already gone in and out of the lab a few times.  Harry had told Draco to separate those memories, but Vance was not what Harry and Draco were looking for.  Neither Savage nor Ron were either, because Harry already knew Savage was involved, and Ron was being controlled.  What Harry needed was the supplier, because that had to be someone outside the department.  If Harry could find the supplier, he should be able to more easily trace everyone who was involved and where all the contraband ingredients were.  He should also be able to find whatever mechanism was controlling Ron, Hermione, and Shacklebolt, and get to the bottom of the whole thing.
“I don’t know, Harry,” Draco cut him off, sounding testy.  “You’ll have to tell me all about it when you grow up.”
Teddy and Fairchild followed her, Nyala following Teddy. Malfoy, meanwhile, turned in the other direction and fled. Harry stood in the empty living room with Astoria, who had pinned him with her cold eyes. She looked in the direction Malfoy had gone, then turned back. “More cake couldn’t hurt,” she said, then headed toward the kitchen.
When Draco stood, however, Harry watched, making sure Draco moved all right, that no other lasting damage had been done.  Draco appeared to have healed as he should, walking without trouble, and Harry looked away again, waiting until Draco had grabbed the clothes, gone into the loo, and started the tap.
Malfoy drank the water.
“Could remain a tree,” Harry said. “And live forever.”
“So,” Ron said, walking through the halls of the Academy after the graduation ceremony. “They didn’t pass him after all.”
Draco looked stunned, and immediately covered it up.  “You can’t find me fit,” he snapped.  “You’re a bloke.”
“When I love someone!  I don’t love you!”
Mister Malfoy’s smile was almost a real one.  “Would you like to try some more magic?” he said, instead of answering Harry’s question.
Ever since learning he was a wizard, Harry had spoken to very few non-magical people. While he was at Hogwarts, he had really only spoken to the Dursleys. After Hogwarts, Harry hadn’t even spoken to them. He’d met Hermione’s parents once. Sometimes as an Auror, he would have to deal with non-magical bystanders, but usually not in any real capacity—the Obliviators came in to handle the Statute, and Harry rarely had to actually talk to them. The most interaction Harry had had with any non-magical people had been with Mark over the past few years, and then more recently the other non-magical members of Teddy’s Order.
“Oh, Harry.” Warmth welled up in Yin’s eyes.
In the morning, Harry would wake to the silver fox.  Once he left the bedroom, he’d find Draco working in the lab.  Draco was usually dressed by then, looking very posh just like usual, but Harry found out Draco would sometimes wear a long coat thing if he was up in pyjamas.
“But I wasn’t—”
“You can,” Harry croaked. “You do.”
Petunia hissed.  “What did you just do?”
“We made it,” said Ron. “Another year.”
” he said, turning to another puddle.
Harry whirled, and behind him stood Teddy, his hair green, his suit green, the light of Avada Kedavra in his eyes, green.
“Let’s do it,” Harry said, hanging back over the side.
Harry never liked to use the fact that he was personal friends with Minister Shacklebolt as leverage, but Vance had
“I was being sarcastic.”
Harry’s gaze lifted, but Draco just turned his head back on the sofa to stare at the ceiling.  “Please let me clean you up,” Harry said.
“That’s not what I—” Draco’s hand faltered, but he put it down.  “You’re special, Harry.  You’re so, so special.  Don’t you realize how . . .”  But Draco didn’t finish, his voice drifting off, the look in his eyes almost helpless.
“You are the final vote,” said Greengrass. “What do you say?”
“They need to go by colour,” Malfoy said petulantly.
“Weren’t you?” Harry’s voice was a little teasing. “I wasn’t sure.”
“I knew what you were trying to do.” Teddy’s voice was slow. “With the press conference. The things you said.”
“You’re my—an instructor.”
Harry stared at her. “Jude Law.”
“All right, well.” Harry turned from the pale profile of Luna’s face to look back up at the moon. The raft of algae rippled under him in response to some unknown force, then went back to gentle bobbing. “I’m asking.”
“Yes.”  Then Draco was kissing him.
“Harry.” Draco shuddered in his arms.
Slowly, Harry turned back to Fudge, which was part of the point of the Chamber of Fires. Those in the hearths could stay where they were, while the person who had called on them had to constantly turn. “Robards,” Harry said, disgusted.
“You did sound frantic, yes,” Andromeda agreed, when Harry finished his explanation.
“I forgot we had the Malfoy-whisperer over here,” Hermione said.
“It doesn’t take the pressure off me,” Harry said.
“Teddy,” Harry breathed. “Why do you think I didn’t want you to be?”
to any meetings? It’s almost as though the Old Blood believes the press just as much as all these Reveal zealots, as though I’ve become some sort of . . . anti-purist.” Looking disturbed, Malfoy flapped a hand. “We all know everything but
“It’s called Sweet Dreams.”
“That’s winning.”  Near the ground now, Draco hopped off his broom.
Robards’ eyes narrowed.
“I should think so,” Harry said, closing the ledger.  “We came here to work on the cure.”
“You were a good friend,” Harry said.
“I only wish I’d thought of a way to do the same. I was making the mistake of keeping my head down until I was an Auror.”
“Muggles aren’t our population,” Savage said, turning on Spragg and still managing to snort while doing so.
For some reason, this made a hint of amusement appear at the corner of Parkinson’s mouth. “You really are impossible. Give me back my drink.”
“So,” Harry said.
Malfoy put out his hand.  “Well?” he said again.  “Hand it over.”  His fingers wiggled, and Harry felt dizzy at exactly how much Malfoy looked like his elder self in that moment, demanding a potion be put into his hand.  As Harry hesitated, Malfoy went on, “You said I’ve explained it; I should get a chance to read it.”
“Fuck.” Harry arched again.
An hour later Harry was back at Grimmauld Place when an eagle owl arrived with a package.  Harry was pretty sure she was the same eagle owl Malfoy had had back in school.  Harry remembered so many instances of seeing that owl in the Great Hall, bringing Malfoy packages from Narcissa; he’d never thought it would ever bring a package to him.  When the owl stuck her leg out, Harry detached the package, then gave her an experimental stroke on the head.  He’d never replaced Hedwig, mostly because nothing could replace her.  The owl closed her eyes and dipped down her head when Harry petted her.  He tried petting her again.
10 years
Harry wondered if that’s how Heloise had felt when he’d pet her.
He meant Draco Malfoy.
He fell again, but not nearly so long, this time, and when he landed it was directly into Draco’s arms.  “Easy, Harry,” Draco murmured, setting him on his feet.  He must have cast something to make Harry lighter.  “I said no falling this time.”
“I need you to,” Harry said.
Rune flashed one of his energetic smiles. “I was just saying, the organization I want to start. We could build a coalition with non-magicals, starting with the families of non-magicalborns. That’s where former Minister Shacklebolt’s organization can be leveraged,” Rune said, turning back to Harry.
“Father did all the voices,” Draco said.  “I was wondering if you—would you want to listen to one of the stories?”
“Instructor Potter?”
“No, I didn’t.  And all of this—finding out you’re a wizard, and there’s magic, and your parents, and you’re actually twenty years older than you are—none of it has frightened you, has it?”
“You would probably dance with a house-elf, if you thought it would free them.”
“To your house. For the . . . my execution. Prosecution. Pardon, so the Aurors can eat me alive?”
“Oh my days,” Draco breathed. “Do you have one here? In your bedroom?”
Harry looked around the room—at the rust-coloured tapestry hanging on the wall, leading the eye to the intricately patterned rug on the floor. Everything in the office had some sort of fabric or cushion to soften it, and Harry made himself answer the question at last. “In school he was a prat, you know. You may have heard? Tried to murder my best friend, get my favorite professor fired, that sort of thing.”
sound of it, watching pretty beads born on the grass. The rain did not touch him, and only then did Harry realize the spells Malfoy had cast. “Thank you,” Harry said, turning his head, feeling as though he could speak at last.
“But who . . . ?” Harry began. “If you and Astoria are outside?”
“Some of them did,” Harry said.
“Mind magic is Level Two,” Adebayo said.
“What about Heloise?”
Draco’s lip curled.  He struggled with the bedclothes, then finally untangled them from his legs.  “I want some clothes.”
“I made it for you.”
“I know it looks like a dream,” Dumbledore said sadly, “but just because you dream it often doesn’t mean it won’t come true.”
“Er,” Harry heard himself say, though even speech made him feel even more ill.  His mouth already tasted like bile.  “Can I—where’s the loo?”
Harry could feel himself drooling, and quickly tried to lick it up. Closing his mouth and swallowing, he nodded his head. Hard.
“Works for you?”  Harry didn’t know why he felt so surprised.  Malfoy had to get a job somewhere, hadn’t he, with both parents stripped of all their fortune and sentenced to Azkaban.  Harry hadn’t thought about it before, though, and working in a shop seemed so . . . unMalfoyish.  Harry would have thought Malfoy would go off to France or something.  Study abroad.  Like the third son of a duke in one of Aunt Petunia’s movies, someone who had no profession and no money, but always wore posh clothes and still talked like an entitled twat.
Harry put his head in his hands, then remembered what Ron had said. His head lifted out of his hands. “Your friends already tried to get you a passing grade,” he said carefully, watching for Malfoy’s reaction. “They also failed.”
“Do you think I might’ve talked to them about my cases?”  Harry thought if he really had friends, he’d tell them everything—and they could do everything together, like solve crime and take laughing pictures.  Every day they’d have fish and chips for lunch.
Harry’s eyes slid to the toilet.  “Er, sorry,” he said again.  “About . . .”  He waved a vague hand toward the toilet.
“Good,” Harry said, since the suggested position would allow Malfoy to keep the Ward Bores in view.
32 years
Draco angled his face away.  The line of his jaw had got sharper also, Harry realized.  “You’ve done enough, thanks.”
“Oh.”
“Like I said, we’re still not sure,” Harry said, “but the people on it have been doing weird things.”
Malfoy was waving the wand before Harry had finished talking.  “
“Right,” Harry said. “Teddy’s studying to be an Auror, so it’s obvious why it would upset him. He seems to have forgiven me; after what happened to Malfoy, I think Teddy began to see just how deeply blood prejudice is ingrained in wizard culture, even if it hasn’t affected him directly. And now with Fudge—I just think it’s set him off.”
Draco was right; he didn’t know much.
“We’ll see.” Malfoy waved a dismissive hand. “Are you sure you wouldn’t like to come to the ball? You’ve more than earned your place.”
.”  He pointed his wand at the fire, which seemed to stream toward Draco’s wand.  Soon the flames were weaving into the shape of a large lizard.  Or dinosaur.  Or—dragon, it was a dragon, like Harry had seen on a kite at the park, once, walking on the way home from school.  The flames shimmered into sparks; then the sparks popped out, fading in the air.
Harry had seen the jumper many times over the course of the last year, a large, shapeless thing that covered up his figure—which was basically his only decent physical quality, George would have been pleased to learn. Malfoy’s shape had been good before, but he had put on a bit of weight in the past three years, in the form of muscle. Probably all that hand-to-hand. The jumper was frayed at the hems, threads coming loose everywhere.
“I’m afraid I must agree,” Pillwickle said.
Harry thought about trying to leave again anyway, but the man was standing right there, and Harry didn’t fancy getting grabbed again.  The man hadn’t wrenched Harry’s arm or anything, but it seemed likely a grown man who was unhappy would end up hurting him somehow.  Besides, the man had already proven himself a kidnapper.  “What are you going to do with me?” Harry asked instead, holding his belt with one hand so he could push up his glasses.
“Why did I do it?” Malfoy asked, even though no one had asked it. “I’ve heard that some Old Blood families are particularly interested in a pure-blood former Death Eaters becoming Aurors.” Another bulb went off, and Malfoy turned directly to the camera. “I thought it was time I showed them just what sort of Auror I intend to be.”
“Pity,” Draco said, dropping Harry’s hand.  “It’s a pity you didn’t learn your lesson.  I wish she’d have done it over your whole body.”
Malfoy stared at it, as though he had not just been snogging Harry silly several moments ago. Then slid off the desk and grabbed Harry’s hand. “Unto the breech,” he said.
“I told you to eat, Potter.”
Harry just stood there.
Hermione’s scowl faded, but her eyes were still sharp, appraising. These were her politician eyes, not her friendly Hermione eyes. Harry loved them just as much. “Okay,” she said slowly.
“Manifestly,” said Andromeda.
Shuffling a bit so Harry could balance himself on one hand and his knees while his other hand touched himself, Harry wrapped his hand around his big thick cock.
Kavika chuckled. “One must obey one’s conscience. Especially when it comes to coffees.” Turning, she spelled Harry’s cup over to him, then picked up one for himself.
Not expecting this at all, considering where his thoughts had been, Harry rocked back on his heels a bit.
“We did fight the good fight!” Savage thundered, and Harry saw her anyway: Professor Burbage, suspended over the table. Harry closed his eyes.
Harry looked down.  The picture in the frame was of Sirius, the picture that Harry had liked the best when he’d been eleven, the one in which Sirius was smiling rakishly, with Regulus behind him, unhappily waving his arms.  “You remember,” Harry said, voice catching.
Harry swallowed hard, and with that motion felt as though sudden tension sluiced out of him, leaving relief in its wake. “Oh, thank Merlin.”
Dropping his arms to his sides with the quill and paper, the man sounded testy.  “Yes, of course, Potter.  What did you think?”
“Do we mean in a spatial sense?” Teddy asked.
“Oh, Harry.”  The face went soft again, and a broad hand reached toward Harry’s forehead.  Harry was so used to the gesture by now that even though the hand was attached to a different body, he knew what to expect, and the hand brushed Harry’s fringe aside.  The thumb on the blunt-fingered hand brushed over Harry’s scar very gently, then pulled away.  “You’d—you’d better go get ready.”
Harry once more got the impression that Andromeda found something amusing.
“Ah,” the man said.  “Yes.  Television.”  The man paused, seeming to hesitate.
“I’ll kiss you more than once.”
She did know about magic, Harry realized.
Draco pushed Harry’s shirt farther up, revealing his chest. Sucking in a breath, Draco just looked at it for a moment—Harry’s lightly muscled chest, the dusting of black hair. “What’s this, then?” Draco asked, his finger gently tracing the scar from the locket.
“Oh, yes, we’re very good friends now,” he said, shoving in that drawer too.  “But just for your future reference, I very much wanted to be your friend then, too, only you—I went about it badly.  I was—I was rather terrible.”
Malfoy just gave him this look. “You know that’s not what I meant.”
Harry’s fist moved up and down Draco’s shaft. He wanted to kiss Draco while doing it, feel that warm soft reassurance of Draco’s lips, his clever tongue, but when Harry leaned down Draco’s mouth was already open, connecting with Harry’s inside a little moan. Harry swirled his thumb around the tip of Draco’s cock to spread the wetness around, and Draco moaned again, arching, his tongue swiping between Harry’s lips to lick Harry’s tongue and then slipping back out again, so that Harry was swallowing Draco’s little cry.
“Sure,” Harry said.  “But do you want that cloak?”
Harry moved to him. “Don’t be a prat.” Grabbing Malfoy’s arm, he pulled the sleeve back up.
“Obviously, I meant Malfoy,” Vinicius told Harry. “Who did you think I meant?”
Malfoy’s eyes locked with Harry’s. Harry was sure Malfoy was going to argue, what with all his pretension toward modesty not five minutes earlier, but instead Malfoy reached for his collar, eyes still fixed on Harry’s. Slowly, he began to unlace it.
“The Order of the Phoenix.”
Ron had brought it from work, Hermione said.
“Malfoy,” Harry said, trying to wrap his brain around this. “Are you saying you want to dance?”
Harry took a step toward him, then another step.  Draco’s chest was rising and falling rapidly, his eyes gone even larger, his cheeks already tinged with pink.  He licked his lips, and Harry reached out to touch his face.  “I’m twenty-three,” Draco blurted.
“Um,” Harry said, taking a step back.  “Your dad freed him.”
“I think you did,” said Harry.  “It sounded like a threat.  You said you’d complain to Robards again if I talk to Malfoy.”
“B-baby tears?” Mrs. Mulpepper said.
Harry opened his mouth to ask another question, then closed it.
“Now you’re worried for me.”  A ghost of a smile touched Draco’s lips, turning them slightly.  “That’s sweet.”
“Wait!” shouted Robards.
“You sure?  He makes it sound like he slaughtered puppies, or something.”
Harry looked at the phial again, then back up to Malfoy.  “Did you?”
“I don’t,” Harry interrupted.
“No.”
“Why on earth would I break them?” Mister Malfoy asked, sounding a trifle impatient.  Though he was now mostly just a blob, Harry could tell Mister Malfoy was pointing his stick.  “
“Your father would,” Harry pointed out.
“Well of course,
“You’re weird,” Draco said, but told him a story anyway.
“I know,” Draco said, sounding even more miserable.  “He loved her so much—he indulged her.  When it came to me, I mean.  He let her—well, you know about the ribbons.  And we played with dolls.”  He shot up, sitting straight so that he could face Harry.  “You won’t tell anyone about that, either, will you?”
“Because I didn’t have anyone to love me,” Harry said, stating the obvious.
“That’s one way of putting it.”
“I told you I knew how to do it!
“Well.  That’s all over.”  Malfoy didn’t seem to want to talk about it any longer, but then he said, hesitating a little, “Father is very political.”
“Yes, well.”  Draco put his nose up.  “If you had had parents, you would understand.”
Robards grimaced again. “We have it under control, sir.”
Something in his tone made Harry glance up.  Looking wistfully at the owl, the man didn’t look like he could be a bad old man.  He looked . . . nice, and interesting, and still striking enough to be an actor.  Or a magician.  Harry guessed he shouldn’t be surprised the man could summon owls.
“The European Union?” Harry asked. “What’s that got to do with it?”
“You can’t.”  Draco’s voice had changed completely.  He didn’t sound angry any longer.  He sounded horrified.
Draco’s chin jutted out farther.  “Yes, I do.”
“Cool.”  Smiling faintly, Harry took his wand out of his sleeve.  “
Harry moaned, warmth pooling low in his gut in response, arousal created from pure autonomic response. “Fuck, yes,” he said, his hips twisting on the bed. “Yes, that. Do it to me. That.”
Malfoy blinked. “It was a joke, Potter. I’m hilarious, remember.”
“I—don’t know.”
“But you’re not scrawny,” Harry said.  “You’re perfect.”
“Harry.” Draco gulped. “It’s the first time; I wanted to—I wanted it to be—”
Harry kept rubbing the side of the cup. “I don’t want history with him,” he said finally. “I want . . . I sort of want to pretend we don’t have history at all. He’s just someone with a hopeless little crush, and I’m just . . . I’m just a person who feels kind of sorry for him.”
Draco was wandering through the kitchen, opening all the drawers, taking things out and leaving them there.  “I don’t care for curry,” he said, frowning at a can-opener.  Probably he’d never seen one.  Draco must have it left over from his time during the magical restriction.
“I know he invited you to dance with me.” Malfoy’s voice came rapidly. “It might, upon first inspection, seem that obliging him wouldn’t serve for spite—but you must be aware, he was taunting us. He knew you wouldn’t actually dance with me.”
“All right!” Sibanyoni’s eyes widened, the tone climbing now to a note of success, of revelation. “Okay! Bad things. Bad things at Hogwarts, in your childhood. We don’t have to go there. Leave it behind. Talk about it, but leave it behind. I have other exercises, plenty of other exercises; we can go through; you can say what you like, what sparks your interest. You don’t have to do anything you don’t like, nothing too new; that’s all right.”
Draco turned to face him.  “Then what is it like?”
“I don’t know,” Harry said.
The Boggart, which had been Riddikulused into a cartoonish-looking vampire with only wizened gums instead of teeth, shifted into several forms—a tall man with green hair, a blond one with a pretty face, a form that almost looked like Harry’s—and then it fell to the floor. The body on the ground was Teddy’s most familiar form, colour leaching from it faster than it should. Harry knew the speed it should take; he had seen enough people die.
“Astoria always wants a revolution. Prepare your ears; here’s the food.” Malfoy tapped his wand, and the sound bubble broke, admitting the voice of a bloke who was standing with the tray.
“It’s some kind of historic landmark or something,” Malfoy said carelessly, as though he hadn’t sat under the Timothy Tree countless times—for its shade, for its calm, for its company.
“Oh.”  Harry thought about that.  “Am I a Muggle?”
“What? No. I mean—it seems very likely you can’t dance. Obviously, you’re very skilled in hand-to-hand combat; I suppose this requires some coordination, but—it seems very likely—that’s all you know how to do. No doubt you would turn dancing into a sparring match. Your opponent would never stand a chance. You’d tread their feet to tatters. It’s no wonder you never venture out onto the—what are you doing?”
“So did I,” Harry said.
“I want to be here,” Malfoy said.
Harry eagerly acquiesced, and they set about making something Draco called “indicator solutions.”  They were potions you could use to test whether someone had eaten a particular ingredient, and Draco said he’d made them before for lots of things.  He said he’d even made one to help Harry with his Auror work, but then he didn’t say anything more about it.
“You’re brewing a cure for vampirism?” Harry asked, a bit worried Malfoy might be a vampire.  Every time Harry saw Malfoy, he looked better than that first day Harry had seen him at Slug and Jiggers.  He’d filled out a bit; his hair had some life, his cheeks some colour.  Even his clothes fit a bit better, but in Harry’s opinion Malfoy was still worryingly pale and a bit too slender, compared to what he had been in fifth year.  Maybe this was just what Malfoy looked like grown-up, but Harry didn’t like it.
, and if you had told me even a day earlier, I could have shagged your brains out anywhere you please, but
Teddy was beginning to look concerned. “Are you okay?”
“You mean the one literally everyone knows?” Harry asked. “I think I might have heard it.”
“How did you know?”
Harry opened his mouth to deny that he had been talking about Malfoy, but he had been. Obviously, he had been.
“It kind of is.” Malfoy kept talking in that annoying way, as though he didn’t give a damn about anything. Maybe if Malfoy could
up to.  No wonder we never got invited here.  Mother always said he lived like a monk.  What sort of professor was he?  Tough, I should think.  Father always said we should respect him.  I suppose he was all right, but I always found him rather cross, didn’t you?  At least he could have bothered to wash his—”
“I don’t know you, do I?”  Draco whirled around.  “I don’t even know if I’ll like you when I do meet you.  Maybe—maybe nothing you’ve told me is true!”
“Do you think the pro-purism, blood secrecy, and isolationism baked within magical society has influenced Ministry institutions such as the Aurors?”
Harry bit his lip.  “Now that’s just silly.”
“What do you mean?” Harry wondered if Ron was going to eat his sausage roll. He was just holding it, awkwardly, when usually Ron ate everything in sight.
Draco angled his face away.  When he spoke, his voice was very quiet.  “His name is Rohit.  He’s a Muggle.”
“Whoa,” Harry said, putting his hand on the table.  “You’ll make the whole table fly up with that one,” he said, even though he could already see the spell wasn’t going to work.
“Fuck,” Draco groaned, “you’re so loose. I can slide right in.”
“Yes, Harry.” Draco let go of Harry’s bollocks immediately, warm hand once more wrapping around Harry’s cock, but the fingernail was back, scraping directly over his slit.
Snape’s Patronus had been a doe. Then again, Harry’s mum had been a woman.
“Chemistry?”
“No, I made it all for myself.”
“Yes, of course,” Draco said.  “I meant the permission of thirty-year-old you.”
It was incredible that he wanted to do this to Malfoy, whom he had disliked, to whom he had been indifferent, and then Harry was touching him, a hand on his shoulder, a hand on his waist. Harry remembered getting to touch Malfoy’s waist when they were dancing, the warm soft heat of him, and he abruptly wanted Malfoy so much that it was difficult to think, and then his mouth was moving toward Malfoy’s and Malfoy melted like liquid in his arms, gone soft and warm and pliant. His head tilted back like a girl in a non-magical motion picture from the 1930s, his mouth yielding instantly to Harry’s, his hands coming up clumsily to cling to Harry’s neck.
“Binns was an amazing professor though,” Harry added. “He could put us to sleep even when we weren’t awake half the night saving the world.”
“Um, mate,” Ron said, mostly just sounding curious.  “’Draco’?”
The stag was powerfully built, more muscular than Harry’s Patronus, which Harry had always hoped looked like his father in Animagus form. The antlers on the stag were impressive as well, taller and thicker than the ones on Harry’s.
“The wizarding world is an incestuous loop,” Kavika agreed. “This is the real reason we need Reveal: new blood.”
people from taking advantage of non-mags? We take advantage of each other with the power we have. Look at Dawlish; look at Stan Shunpike during the war. Imperius is powerful, and at least with the wards separating our world from—” Harry stopped himself. “I guess I am worried about it.”
“What’ll you have?” Gareth said, as Malfoy opened the door.
“All right,” Harry said, once warm-ups were over. “Everyone pair up. These will be your sparring partners for the next few weeks, so get cozy.”
“Does he always talk this much?” Robards wanted to know.
“I’ll beat you, all right,” Harry said, and Draco began teaching him spells.
Ron was still frowning. “Whose Patronus is that?”
For a single moment, Malfoy’s surprise was honest and unguarded, then it slid again under a surface of mocking ease, like a stone dropped into a pool with just one ripple. “I meant, have you anything else to say about how I’m failing your class? But you can thank me if you want. I accept compliments. Chocolates. Flowers. Passing marks. Serenades by the lake-side, if you’re not a cheapskate.”
“Ronald can stay.” Shacklebolt’s eyes didn’t leave Harry, who had paused. “Go on,” Shacklebolt said.
“Yes.” Malfoy walked about, pretending to look at the shelves. “I’ve failed, you see.”
Voldemort had killed Cedric, and he’d known his father was on Voldemort’s side.
Then the bottle dropped, and Draco slammed back onto the bed.
Malfoy flinched.
Draco felt bad, Harry guessed, which should have been all right.  He had wanted Draco to feel bad for leaving him behind.  “You said I could help you,” Harry said, just to reinforce the feeling, but suddenly he wasn’t as angry any more.
“He has done. He’s done a guest course on tactics. And there’s the holiday party.”
“They were my parents,” Harry yelled.
“You weren’t invited.” The Bulstrode witch tried to put the door, but Malfoy waved his wand.
Malfoy held up a vial. Harry could tell without a second glance that the swirling silver thread inside was a memory. “Pensieves. Library.” Slipping the vial back into his cloak, he swept toward the door. “You coming?”
“Oh.” Duggins shoulders deflated. Though he seemed to be hiding it, he sounded relieved, as though he had been gearing himself up for treatment of a Fudge supporter. Had he not heard about Harry’s fifth year? But the bloke was so young. Perhaps he didn’t know Fudge had been Minister before at all—and this was unfair. Wizarding youths knew their history—a lot better than many adults, who had lived through it and so hadn’t seen a need to learn about it.
“I have a problem,” Harry said, then stopped to look at Malfoy.
“I said fuck you,” Draco said, covering his eyes with his arm.  “Why do you have to be so . . . ugh.”  His face had got even longer, finally losing the rest of the fat.  Harry could see those high cheekbones now, the sharp little chin.  His nose had got wider, but not very; it was more defined than it had been before.  His skin wasn’t that clear, pale colour, instead going a bit splotchy now.  Suddenly, Draco took his arm off his eyes, propping himself up with his elbows on the bed.  “Did you and your little friends tie up Crabbe and Goyle and leave them naked in a cupboard?”
When Harry pushed the button on the front of the box, the picture of the red-head man and brown-haired girl appeared again, as well as the bar that said, “Slide to unlock.”  Having already figured out this part, Harry slid his finger on the bar, and the picture changed again to a sky with some smaller picture boxes on it.  One of the smaller picture boxes was a drawing of a telephone, so Harry tried touching it, and yet another picture came up.  This one looked almost familiar, numbers laid out like they would be on a telephone.
Trying to catch his breath, Harry turned to look in the mirror. His own cheeks were red. He looked like someone who wanted someone. Was that what Malfoy had seen? And had it caused him to flee because he didn’t want it, or because he wanted it as well.
Draco grimaced.
“Hm?” Harry shifted his weight, shuffling because it was a little crowded on this side of the room. He didn’t love it.
“Heloise,” Mister Malfoy said, sounding relieved.
30 years
“I’m frustrated,” Draco said, after Harry had moved through two more of the boxes.
“For you!”
“All right, Harry.”
Kavika had come out of retirement because Harry had wanted to die, and the scar on his forehead wouldn’t let him. There were four mind healers in the whole UK, and Kavika was the only one he trusted to tell that Horcruxes existed at all.
“You can pet her,” Draco said gently.  “She may be incorporeal, but I’m sure she would appreciate it nevertheless.”
with it!”  Draco pitch was rising.  “If you could like a girl—if you could—if you got to
Malfoy’s gaze swept down, away from him.
“I’m glad.  I’m grateful to him.”  Hermione put a hand on Harry’s shoulder.  “Are you okay?”
“Why?” Harry looked around, absently picking up the broom, which was still hovering, and leaning it against the wall.
“You think he was upset by the people around him asking these questions?”
The Bulstrode witch, who had lovely large blue eyes, pursed her lips. “I’ll go check.” Turning, she disappeared into the manor, while the image on the IC:WUT/UC showed the Malfoy was following.
When Harry broke Robards’ policy to see Malfoy, however, Malfoy wasn’t exactly keen on helping.
“I’ll be downstairs,” Harry said, but when he headed toward the door, Draco was up, then blocking his way.
“Well.”  Malfoy sniffed in a way Harry hadn’t seen since school—that arrogant little head tilt that put Malfoy’s nose above everyone else, only now Harry could see how bright Malfoy’s eyes were.  None of his tears had fallen, however, and Malfoy went on, “Why didn’t you just say?”
“It’s not the sort of shop where people come in to buy potions off the rack,” Draco said, directing the pans from the cooker over to the sink as well, then doing something that made a few bubbles float in the air.  Soap, Harry guessed.  “I brew to spec.”
“He authenticated the memory,” Harry said, because he had promised Malfoy the Aurors wouldn’t do anything to him, and there was no reason he should have to stay.
That phrase from Draco’s letter,
Draco yawned.  “At least I don’t have to go to school.  Again, I mean.  I mean, I can get first year all over with in—how long?  A few hours?”
“My trainee,” said Harry.
Travers looked rather smug at this, his slit of a mouth slipping into a smirk, his eyes reflecting the shining light from the ballroom. “I think you’ll find us quite sophisticated.”
“Verbal diversionary tactics are allowed,” Draco said, angling his broom down toward the ground.
“No one,” Draco said.  “I just don’t want you to think that I am.”
“You can tell by looking,” Malfoy said.  “Didn’t you ever take a potions N.E.W.T.?”
“Ugh,” Draco said, and Harry didn’t tell him he sounded exactly like he had at thirteen.  Draco wouldn’t appreciate it, even if it was true.  “Do I really go on helping you?”
“And your dumb deer got lost, by the way,” Harry said, feeling awkward and perhaps a little sullen.  He still
“I thought you’d never ask,” Malfoy said, his voice silky. “You know, 'this would go a lot faster' if I had help.”
were hurt?  That no one’s heart would be broken?  You think that nobody cares what happens to
“Keeping unauthorized Dementors is against Wizard law.” Malfoy still spoke fast, as though he had all his defenses lined up, in order.
“Anything?”
“Fuck.”  Draco covered his face.
Harry grabbed his arm, and Malfoy stopped. Just stopped, standing there, and Harry could feel the velvet of the robe—scarlet today, as though Malfoy was playing Auror dress-up. Harry could hear Malfoy’s breathing go noisy, then remembered Malfoy was scared of him. Harry let him go. “I’m going to help you,” Harry said.
“Shh,” Draco said, but he took Harry’s hand and squeezed once, hard, before letting go.  “Not now.”
“Do I talk to you a lot?” Harry asked, trying not to sound eager.  He just had trouble imagining what it was like, knowing Draco and not being friends.
“They . . . they died.  They died defending you from . . .”  Trailing off, Draco turned around and seemed to square his shoulders.  He looked like someone from a horrible movie who was bravely going to be tortured, and Harry wondered whether he should have asked.  But it was about his parents, and then Draco went on, “There was a man.  He was—idiotic and powerful and arrogant.  He thought he could—he was selfish and cruel, and thought he could control everybody, only he couldn’t.  He couldn’t control your parents, or people like your parents, and they stood up to him, and they died for it.”
“That’s great,” Harry said, folding up the parchment and putting it back in his robe.  He went over to Malfoy.  “Look, you’re still doing it.”
“Don’t,” Draco cried, his face a rictus of terror.
Draco just stared at him.
Malfoy’s eyes went large, and Harry looked around to see what had made him look so surprised.  There wasn’t anything there, though, and Harry guessed the Wood-Eye Lye must have a bad aftertaste.  “Why did you start growing a beard?” Malfoy said suddenly.
“Not for real,” Malfoy said, and Harry turned back to him. Malfoy looked at him innocently, then raised a brow of his own. His voice was playful. “Chicken, Potter?”
All of Malfoy’s over-confident insouciance seemed to have slipped away, replaced with a stiffness that was almost hesitant.  Harry guessed the question about his mum had set him on edge; Malfoy didn’t like to talk about it.  Feeling a bit bad for having asked about her, Harry said, “It’s still a help, nevertheless.” Harry picked up the phial Malfoy had said was an indicator solution.  It was a smoky dark liquid that almost seemed to move of its own, like a rolling mist trapped inside of glass.  “You said something about the administration process?”
“I don’t want anyone to see me.”  Draco’s voice was dull, and Harry went back to stroking Draco’s hair.
“They might be necessary for the work I’m doing on the cure,” Draco said, putting the hairs into an envelope he had in his cloak.
Harry didn’t want to look around the room. He didn’t want to look around the table and see the faces of Death Eaters, the Muggle Studies professor suspended over them.
Draco’s breath stuttered again. “Oh.”
Harry looked at him in incomprehension.
Draco’s lips pursed.  “You would; you just wouldn’t know how to from me.”
“Want to get your hands on me, do you?”  Draco said, sounding tired and defeated.  “I suppose you always did.”
“Oh, my God,” said Harry.
Harry frowned, but not because he didn’t know where this was going. Even though the first time Harry had reviewed a memory with Kavika, he hadn’t been sure what the point was, he had soon come to learn that reliving things could be helpful. Even though he remembered the past, walking through it now as an adult could bring new things to light. The problem was, there were just so many memories to choose from.
I’m fit; I’m frolicking about with poofs, aren’t I, I’m a bloody
“Harry?”  Mister Malfoy’s voice floated through the door.  No doubt he could hear the horrible retching sounds.
Term opened on a cold day in September, when the leaves on the Timothy Tree were half bleeding into a vibrant scarlet. It started a day earlier for Level One, orientation consisting of tours of Bickford-Buckley and Leck, an overview of policies, and an introduction to the instructors and their courses. Today reporters crowded around Pallas Arch, attempting to capture photographs, perhaps, of Draco Malfoy attempting to climb the Timothy Tree. Legend said the tree would know whether the heart of a disciple was true, only allowing the most virtuous trainee to scale its branches. Few had ever done it.
“Yeah,” Harry said, loosening his hand on Malfoy’s waist. “I think we’re friends. Don’t you?”
“I wonder why,” Malfoy shouted back, and it could have been a joke about how distracting Malfoy’s backside was, the heat of him, the press of his body on the broom, but it wasn’t. It was about the crowd below, the whole world changing into something different than everything they had known. “How’s Teddy?”
Harry moved so that his dick could slide against Draco’s, still hard and angry red with Harry’s hairband around its base. At the first stinging touch of them together, Draco jerked wildly; then he pushed at Harry’s shoulders.
Draco had met other boys at Hogwarts.  Draco had met Harry.
The worst Robards could do if Harry went to Malfoy was sack him, and Harry doubted that would happen.  Sacking Harry Potter would look bad to the press, and Robards was all about image.  Harry could get suspended again, but that could also look bad when Harry solved this case—particularly since Harry knew reporters at the
“Mm,” Harry said, voice muffled by cock. “Mm-hm.” He needed it so bad that he finally released the cock in his mouth. “Please. Please, I need . . .” He arched his back, fucking back onto a cock that sadly, wasn’t there.
“I’m . . .”  Wetting his lips, Harry tried to think about how to say it.  “I’m kind of fucked up,” he said, because that had worked with Ron and Hermione.  They had known what he had meant.
on it.  Don’t you know that’s for children and cheapskates?”
Draco had called them—could have come to his house when he wasn’t there, but that seemed strange.
“Don’t be silly,” a slender woman with dark eyes was saying. “Photsi broke up with Draco Malfoy eight months ago.”
Harry straightened, taking his hands from Draco’s trousers.
“Maybe . . .” Harry swallowed again.  “Maybe he didn’t know.”
In May of 2012, Harry arrested a suspect named Lorica Ludville and questioned her under Veritaserum.  What she said changed the course of Harry’s life.
“I’m not an upgrade on Malfoy,” Harry said, gritting his teeth.
Malfoy stopped fiddling with his sleeve, head snapping up. “You could do that for me?”
“The press?” asked Ron.
the quill of Cecil Vance,” Draco said next, holding his hand up high.
He was forgetting the kiss, Narcissa’s death, Cecil Vance; he forgot Wood-Eye Lye and Savage and Aurors, the academy, uni, Hogwarts, Hermione, Ron.  Then Harry forgot Malfoy, and he was a boy in too-big clothes holding a stick.
“You always were so extreme,” Fudge said sadly.
,” Draco said.
“No, we didn’t,” Nyala said, turning to her in surprise.
“So then, do you think they might know something?” Harry said.  “Maybe we could call them to ask them about the potion brewer.”  The bar at the bottom didn’t have an obvious way to slide it, but he tried doing it with his thumb.  The picture changed to a different picture with a bunch of little pictures on it.
“—in the final tally,” Lee Jordan’s voice was saying, “meaning Archimedes Proudfoot’s bid for Wizard Council appointment has failed, leaving Cornelius Oswald Fudge’s appointment in good standing without an opponent. Fudge will formally take office Monday, October 9—”
“I don’t have any pictures of my dad,” Draco said.
“I fucking,” Harry thrust back onto him, “love the spell. Love it, love it on your cock, in my arse, on my cock; it’s good. It’s so good.”
Draco drew back partway, then slammed in again, roughly enough that the bed bounced.
“What’s a house-elf?”
“No.  She got married to Ron.”
“Look, Malfoy,” Harry said, annoyed with the whole situation but realizing that for once, he was not all that annoyed with Malfoy.  “You’re the best there is at potions ID.”
“Thanks!” Ron called, turning to help another fellow Auror.
“Evidence,” said Robards.
I’m not a poof.  My father isn’t in Azkaban!”
timeline; I’m talking about yours.”
“Some boys do,” Harry said steadily.  “I know a boy who’s got tattoos all over, and at least five piercings, and he always wears a braid on one side, and it’s always got something in it—twine or beads or a ribbon.  He’s got the biggest muscles you’ve ever seen.”
,” Draco said, sounding like he didn’t know what to think of it.
“Some help you are,” Harry muttered to himself, but just then he saw a door, and above the door it said thirty-three.
“Astoria is not a terrorist.” Malfoy’s voice was sharp and completely different from before.
“I know he was.”
Father said I should—why wouldn’t I just fuck all the rest?  Why
two robes.”
, went his brain, and then—
Meanwhile, Draco just shrugged.  “Sacrifice is necessary for great reward.”
Malfoy looked as shocked as Harry felt, too pale. Then Harry saw that Malfoy was trembling, the way he had when the Snatchers brought Harry to him and demanded Malfoy identify him. Malfoy’s voice was shaking when he said, “Harry,” and began to reach out.
“You don’t need magic.”
“Oh, really?”  Malfoy’s tone was perfectly polite, and Harry rolled his eyes.
Heloise came back during supper, and Draco walked away from the table because he wanted to pet her.  When he didn’t come back to the kitchen, Harry cleared Draco’s dishes and cleaned up.
“Rune didn’t know anything about this,” Teddy said. “He just helped me understand that for Reveal to work, we need something different than the Aurors, or even the Ministry.”
“I’m thirty-one.”
“Have a sit at the table,” Mister Malfoy said.
Ron’s brow began to knit. “Harry—”
Harry watched him for a moment, Draco laying out the jars of sand and dragonflies and troll mucous.  “I’m sorry about your break up,” Harry said suddenly.  “With Armen.  I’m sorry you were hurt.”
Then Harry touched him at the tip and it happened almost instantly, as if by command, Draco’s eyes going wide and almost pained, then squinching shut tightly, his hips bucking as the come came out rather more wildly than Harry had expected, load after load. Draco punctuated each spurt of it with a tight little, “ah;” going, “ah, ah, ah,” as he came, almost as though each release of it pained him, and Harry realized why it was so, so odd. He’d seen Draco in so many ways, but he’d never seen him at this age, like this, so completely lost for control, so completely open. When Harry considered that maybe this was why Draco hadn’t wanted to come, Harry wrapped his arms around him and held him tight through the last shuddering pulses of it, another “ah” filling Harry’s ear, then a softer, final groan.
Draco feigned a shudder.  “You wouldn’t catch me
“He re-applied.”
“At least let me . . .” Harry began pulling off his pants and trousers, which were still halfway down his legs.
“Yes,” Draco said again, his fingers slowly circling Harry’s cock. “Yes. Harry, yes,” and his fingers were a fist around it, slowly dragging up.
,” he said, putting strength enough into the disenchantment to cancel Imperius.
“Like locking someone in a cupboard,” Harry said.  “Sometimes for a whole week, and not getting to eat proper meals.”
After nearly two weeks of not living in it, Grimmauld Place felt darker and lonelier than ever.  Draco’s flat was cosy and comfortable in comparison, and Harry missed it with an ache that was not rational.  He missed
“You look fantastic in colours,” Harry said quickly.  “You don’t wear enough of them, in my opinion.”
“You were right,” Harry said.  “About there being a threat.  You shouldn’t—don’t leave your flat without changing your features.  And don’t mess with the wards.  And I’m leaving my Patronus.”
“No,” Harry said again.  “I’m not.”
He meant the fish and chips, Harry realized.  Taking out his wand, Harry pointed it at himself, then got a glass and put water in it.  He didn’t know what trick Draco had used when Harry was eleven to make the water feel like it cleaned your mouth, but he took the glass anyway and hovered outside the door.  “Can I come in?” he asked.  “I’ve done a Smell Dispel.”
Draco always seemed eager to list the ages he wasn’t.  “I was doing it for me,” Harry said.
“Did I mention you were tortured there?”
The night of the NDE meeting, Harry sat at a desk with the Whisper Wire, while Robards and the four other Aurors who would Apparate to the meeting stood arrayed around the IC:WUT/UC. Robards had insisted on being one of the Aurors in on the action, claiming that Harry Potter could “steal the glory” and Shacklebolt could “seize control,” but no one would stop him from doing his sworn duty. Pretty much everyone knew that Robards wanted his name in the headlines, and that the only way to get it there if Harry Potter was involved would be to finally step out from behind a desk and do something worthwhile.
Harry felt himself smile again.  “I said no questions.”
“I really, really need to get into the city and can’t with all the cars; could you please—”
Harry looked down at his hands,
“I quit because of all the bureaucracy.” Harry’s voice was calm, because he wasn’t really here. He wasn’t thinking. He was letting his body stand there, letting his mouth go off, but he wasn’t inside of it. He was somewhere else, watching it happen. It felt good. It felt fucking great. “All of the red tape. Inability to get things done. You catch a blood supremacist—what does it matter? One of their Old Blood relatives speaks on their behalf. The Wizengamot has always been more interested in protecting the Statute of Secrecy. The work is prioritized in such a way, the Force is built in such a way, you address one blood crime at a time, instead of the bigger strings that control the institution.”
“Right.”  If Draco had de-aged the same amount as Harry had, Malfoy would be eleven.  Christ, what had Draco done?  The letter had mentioned an exchange.  He’d traded away his age.
,” Harry said, pretending he was surprised.  “How come they never won the House Cup, then?”
“I saw you with Vinicius,” Ron said. “I was going to come over, but then it looked like you were getting along.”
“Yes,” Kavika said, floating Harry’s cup over to him.
Harry took the wand, just so the light would stop shining in his face.  Draco moved his head and shoulders back to his bunk.
“I—didn’t say you were.”
Fudge nodded. “This just goes to show you haven’t moved on.”
“Sure, I can find you fit,” Harry said.  “Everyone found Professor Lockhart fit.”
But Draco’s lip wasn’t curling at Alby, Harry saw after a moment.  Draco was making a face at the slugs on the floor, stepping carefully around them until he was beside Harry.  “Can you un-silence him,” Draco said, more like a demand than a question.
“I should have stopped you,” Mister Malfoy said, but he still didn’t sound angry.  “I didn’t—I wasn’t thinking.  Would you like to have a lie down?”
Now Draco sounded like he was eleven
Harry had been so engrossed by what Rune was saying that he hadn’t noticed Malfoy, who had joined them over by the wall. Rune had cut himself off, turning to include Malfoy into the space.
“Malfoy,” Harry said.
Malfoy found the hidden signature in question, which was that the Forgetfulness Potion had giant tortoise scales in it.  Harry almost suggested Malfoy take a little of the potion, before he remembered the substance was illegal and causing all sorts of problems with people’s minds.  Just, Malfoy sounded like he could use a little forgetting.  Some things were so much better when you never thought about them at all.
“Then it was okay?”
“I don’t mind,” Harry repeated.
“You’re a child.”
Draco’s gaze swept down.  He was still holding onto the front of Harry’s robes.  His voice was quiet when he said, “I feel like you have higher standards than that.”
“I practice.”
“A little,” Harry said.
That wasn’t the question he wanted to ask either.
“Malfoy,” Harry said. “You don’t have to do it at all.”
“I just mean, who he was shouldn’t matter to me.”
“Relax.”
“I will.” Harry swallowed. “Teddy will be there.”
“I don’t think you’re terrible,” Harry said, coming over to the desk.  Draco said they had to look for clues.
Young-Draco was nothing like Harry had been, but he was a much bigger chatterbox, even if he did like to read, so Harry had almost expected this.  “Yes, Draco?” Harry asked, amused that he found himself saying it in the same way that Draco had to him.
“It affects the Force.” Savage’s flicked to Harry. “And given its membership, it seems likely that it could unduly influence trainees—”
“Not really.”
“I think,” Harry began, then stopped again, looking at the bench, and away.
“I just didn’t know you had any about Draco Malfoy.”
“No one.”
He shouldn’t have given Draco an ultimatum like that.  He’d lost his temper, and he’d wanted Draco to remember, and Harry hadn’t felt able to explain just how imperfect he was.  The truth was, Harry knew that he had problems.  He knew he was what Ginny would call
“Yes!  Malfoy, he’s . . .”  Harry coughed.  “He’s been a great help.  He’s very . . . helpful.”
“Good,” Harry said.  Letting go Draco’s hand, he went back to sorting moss.
He flew directly through the window of his office, where he had a few hours before his first class. The window could be charmed and the Floo could be shut, but there was no fixing he door. Just as a Notice Me Nots wouldn’t work on a tree everyone knew was there, nor would it work on a door everyone knew how to locate. Harry waited for the inevitable knock, the inevitable instructor barging in, the inquiring trainee.
“Excellent. Good.” Sibanyoni took a sip of Coke. “Horizons. Stretched.” He made a frittering motion with his hand that was maybe a horizon stretching. “If Vinicius was an animal, what animal would he be?”
dark magic on your grounds. The truth of it is, someone trapped someone else named Timothy in a tree on this property a millennia ago, and it’s only just now—after generations and generations and generations of Aurors, who are
Harry hadn’t been particularly interested in Malfoy’s reply. Either he would come to the practice session or he wouldn’t, but when Harry got to the door of the classroom and Malfoy hadn’t said anything, he glanced back. Malfoy was still just standing there, staring at him, the way that trainees sometimes stared at spells they had never seen before.
“But what about my—”
Harry looked down at the sofa, the table beside it.  The table had a book on it, probably one Draco had been reading, not repairing.  The book was leather-bound with vines on the cover and fairy tales inside.
Outside, Harry loosened his collar, letting in the night air. Opening his senses as well, he took in the sights, the smells, the sounds. Insects made their quiet rustling sounds, and non-mag car horns honked in the distance. The pub, which should have been a dull roar behind him, was almost dead silent.
“Nabbed?” the man said, still with that stricken look.
had the lives of innocent non-mags in mind.” Spragg’s voice was even more calm.
“Take your time.” Sibanyoni sipped his Coke. “Let it come. Let it speak to you. What does it say?”
There was a pause. “I’m sure it’s fine.”
“Harrow Hall!” Draco yelled.  “Tanglewood Abbey!”
.  She’d think I must be, to go and do something like that; she’d think she’d done something wrong to make me this way.  She loves me so much that she can’t even blame me.  She’d blame herself.”
“Right, but only because he happened to . . .” Harry shuffled. His eyes fell on the sausage roll still in Ron’s hand. “Are you going to eat that?”
“Do we, though?” Hermione looked up at Ron.
“I don’t want to do fundraisers.” Teddy turned to Ron. “And I don’t want to work in a bureaucracy. Sorry.”
Draco was on the stoop, looking extremely pristine in the evening summer light.  He had on his typical “muted palette”—blue-grey dress shirt with well-fitting trousers and waistcoat, both of which were dove grey.  His hair shone in the sun.  He was beautiful.
“Expelled?” said Harry. Then he realized. “Because it will kill the tree.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco said abruptly, turning toward him.  “I’m sorry, Harry.  I shouldn’t have—” He reached out, and Harry flinched.
“I can do it,” Harry said. “After all, I’ve done it before.”
“Yeah.” Harry looked over at him. “You said you wanted to move on.”
“Right,” Malfoy said again.  “Right.”  Dazedly turning away, Malfoy moved to the other side of the room.  Taking out his wand, he cast a bubble of Protegos around the bottle on the bench.
“I can
“I don’t have to forgive you,” Harry said.
Harry frowned.  “Pulling rabbits and things out of hats, cutting women in half.  I never knew you could actually appear in thin air.”
buy her bonbons; he’d probably still go see her every day after work, every morning once he got Tailored Tinctures.  He’d still wear his hair short and pretend he didn’t like blokes, because what mattered was that his crazy Mum in the Janus Thickey Ward not worry about him.  A life of his own didn’t matter to him at all, and Harry wondered if it ever would.
“I didn’t think you would want to talk to me,” Travers said. He had a long, thin face with long, thin lips and long, thin eyes.
He looked down at the top of his hand—blank, smooth skin. Slowly, a laceration appeared, a straight line, followed by two curves, then another curve, then a shape like a snake.
“Yes.”
“Kill the spare,” said Voldemort, the other arm slowly rising, trailing shadow, the thin white finger unfurling, pointing over Harry’s left shoulder.
“He passed the exam,” said Baggot. “Our policy is to admit—”
“But.”  Malfoy’s gaze dropped to Harry’s lips, his expression troubled.  “Now I want.”
“This is a long way to go all by yourself.”  The taxi started along Grimmauld Place, heading down the road.  “Are you sure your parents are okay with it?”
“Nothing,” Harry said, taking his hand off his chest.
“Right. You do know I didn’t vote Conceal, don’t you?” Harry said, his voice still a little scratchy from disuse.
“Awfully subdued,” said Bole, seeming sceptical.
describe his feelings but had been told not to, had been told he shouldn’t.  “I think I understand better now,” Harry said, speaking with effort.  “What it would have been like.  To have.”  Harry sucked in a breath.  He could feel the magic swirling in him, never knowing where to go.  “To have people who loved me.  At that young age.”
“I think being a shop-keep sounds rather nice,” Harry said.
“That’s a big undertaking,” Malfoy said, but he sounded interested as well.
“My mum.”
“That was
“Oh, God.”
-mohr-
had made Draco feel that way—confident.  Eleven-year-old Harry had done it as well, because Draco had finally seen what he could offer Harry.
“Yes, I thought—I thought that might be the case.  Anyway,” Draco went on, his cheeks a bit pink, “using surnames is convenient, isn’t it?  Harry.  That way you know which family everyone is from, which is important.  Imagine being a ‘Smith’.”
Pink sprang into Malfoy’s cheeks, and he looked up swiftly. “Savage?”
“I was out of my mind,” Draco whispered.  “Andromeda said you’d used the Floo; I didn’t know where you were.  I thought—darling, I thought I’d lost you.”
Harry had just found the address for the warehouse when Andromeda knocked on Teddy’s door.  “I have made hot chocolate,” said Andromeda.  “Draco seemed to think it was important you have some today.”
, Harry thought, but he was being open-minded. “Sure. He could be an alpaca.”
“You get me so hard Draco.” Harry pushed against him, his dick sliding along Draco’s hips again. “You feel that? How hard you get me? I want you so much. I like you so much. Draco.” Harry kissed him again, but it was like Draco could barely register it, like he couldn’t even close his mouth, his jaw hanging as he gasped for air.
“He said he’d tell us,” Ron said. “If it turned into something more.”
“You have,” Harry said.  “Many times.”
“Malfoy.”  Harry’s voice was just a little panicked, and then Malfoy moved closer, and closer.
At last, Malfoy’s head swung toward him, his gaze intense and unblinking, just as it always was. “Come on, then,” Malfoy said, his voice unexpectedly soft. “Let’s have it.”
“I’d like to be alone now,” Malfoy said, moving farther away.  “If you don’t mind.”
Harry laughed. The Granger-Weasleys was where he wanted to be after all.
“Oh.” Draco’s hips jerked, and his hand shot down to cover Harry’s, still wrapped around his dick. “Hold it tight, Harry,” he whispered.
“Er.”  Harry looked around.  “I noticed there weren’t sheep.”
“Your mum.”
“Thanks.”
“Does the Board know you planned this interview?” Carrow asked.
“Sexual.”
Harry turned on him.  “You’re punishing him.”
Kavika had ignored this as well. “Emotional support can be about communicating your feelings and your problems,” she said. “It can also be about spending time with someone you care about, doing something that you like, and getting to hear about someone else for a change. From what you’ve told me, you don’t particularly value isolation. Why, then, are you isolated?”
“Good talk,” said Teddy, bending to pick up his guitar again.
“Here is Alphard,” Draco said, pointing out a picture of a man who looked about as dour as the tyrannical old woman.  “He’s my great uncle, and not very important for the purposes of this family history.”  He turned the page to reveal another old man.  “And here is Cygnus Black, my grandfather on my mother’s side.”
Turning his head slightly toward Harry, Teddy gave him this pleased little smile, as though happy Harry had gone along with this very bad joke instead of making a protest. “Must be why Draco Malfoy’s repeating Level One,” he said. “The power of song compels.”
“You are different than you were, Harry.” Yin’s voice was soft. “I’m different than I used to be. We can grow and change, and still remember the hurts we have felt.”
Her head jerked up. “Now?”
Draco’s eyes were wide.
Ron had asked once, because ever since he had abandoned Hermione and Harry in the incident with the locket, Ron had moments of strange introspection.
“Yes!” Hermione agreed enthusiastically. “We were alone, then. It’s different now. There’s a lot of support on our side. With a Minister for Magic who can replace Robards, who can manage Reveal, who can institute reforms—we could do so much.”
“I wanted to be here,” Harry said, his hands tightening on Malfoy’s waist. “With you.”
“She died, but she must have had a very good life.  Do you know how I know, Harry?”
“Not really.”  Draco was lying there in the narrow bunk with his hands folded over the covers.  He didn’t look like he was ready to sleep at all, but he had changed into pyjamas.  Loose and white, they looked rather less posh than most of his clothes.
“Well, of course I surpass everyone
“A shovel?”
“Leave you alone?” Kavika suggested.
As the portrait slid away, the dark space behind became illuminated by the flickering light of the sconces, gradually revealing emerged a round man, probably in his mid forties. He had a round, friendly face and round, terrified eyes, petrified completely by a Full-Body Bind Curse. The trunk remained in front of him, huge, closed, and now ominous.
“Maybe you should take someone with you after all,” Draco said abruptly, looking from the fox back up at Harry.  “Maybe you should take—aren’t there other Aurors?  You have to take care of me, after all.  Or—my father could go with you.  He’s very good at magic.  And with dark magic.  Perhaps we could—”
He took the dressing-gown with him.  Adult-Draco had given it to him; despite the almost two weeks Harry had spent in Draco’s flat, it was the only thing there that really belong to Harry.
“Without talking,” said Malfoy.
“Well,” Draco said, “technically, you already were a slut. I just . . . played with you a little.”
“I meant—what you think about what I think,” Harry said, a bit confused about having to explain this. Wasn’t this meant to be a conversation? It always was with Kavika, but maybe that was because he had known her better. They moved in the same worlds; they contended with the same people. That, she said, was not the ideal situation for therapy, but Harry had liked it. He’d always known where she was coming from. “About Teddy,” Harry further clarified, just in case Duggins still thought Harry wanted his political views.
he cared about something, he wouldn’t have such a problem casting a Patronus, and then he wouldn’t be failing. Anyway, Malfoy’s failed exam was absolutely the least of Harry’s concerns just now.
“What?” Harry looked up at Draco, startled.  “That’s not in Cinderella.”
“Because you’re so—you’re so . . .”
.  “Quit ID’ing potions for other blokes?”
“But we were doing tester potions,” Harry said.  “To see which ingredients were in it.”
As he disappeared, the tree itself rotted, leaves wilting, branches dwindling away into wet, limp things that folded into the trunk. The trunk itself went dark brown, sagging, then singed to black, shrivelling in on itself like something from within had made it into sludge to suck through a straw. Then the point that had been sucking disappeared with a pop, leaving nothing but a black, gaping maw in the ground. After a moment, even that filled, the dirt around the edges falling in to fill the space. Grass rushed like a crowd to fill it up, growing so fast that it looked like green paint putting the final touches on the last bit of a brown canvas.
“Except remove the Dark Mark,” Teddy said.
“That’s not it either.”
“Yes,” Harry said slowly, beginning to think he’d misinterpreted this whole conversation.  “Very greasy.”
For the third session, Harry came ready to talk about something else. Sibanyoni began by showing him to a chair and offering him digestive biscuits. “They always make me feel better when I’m porting long distances,” he said, shaking the tin.
“Not according to him.” Teddy turned to Nyala. “Is Draco the only one you trust with this dress?”
Four-oh-eight. Too late to take Sweet Dreams. He should have taken it last night. He’d discovered it years ago, finding that it was infinitely better than Dreamless Sleep, which made him feel like death in the morning. Working for both insomnia and nightmares, Sweet Dreams had been a staple in Harry’s nightly rituals for at least a year before he began easing off of it, as it had side effects he didn’t want to deal with. These days, he only took it when he was having trouble getting to sleep.
Harry quickly stabbed the remaining three bits of cake with his fork, shoved it into his mouth, and nodded.
“How?”
“I—” Malfoy stopped himself and swallowed, immediately looking guilty.  “It wasn’t meant to be a question,” he said weakly.
When Draco was twenty-four, he and Harry found the illegal supplier responsible for the warehouse and the potions ring.
Kavika set her coffee down. “And then what happened?”
“You could,” Kavika agreed.
“Um.”  Draco considered it further, the distress fading out of his face.  “Shall we go to The Floating Monk?”
“So are we talking or not talking?” Teddy asked. “See, I’m sort of thinking about picking up my guitar, but given the past experience, I might have to put it down again. Don’t get me wrong; I hear the Combat class is brutal. Guitar-lifting will probably help my build muscle mass.”
