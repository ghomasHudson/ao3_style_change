sort of funny just how crazy that whole thing had been, and suddenly, for the first time ever, Harry found himself laughing with Draco Malfoy.
" he shook him before he spoke quickly, something that nearly sounded like panic in his voice. "Are you aware the Dark Lord has a direct connection into Potter's mind that Potter
He was spending nearly every waking moment outside of class with fucking thing. He was barely eating, barely sleeping, barely
The Baron nodded. He seemed to be struggling with himself and Draco wondered when the last time he had ever spoken like this to a student was - or if he had ever done so in his long afterlife.
The knowledge of that sent waves of pleasure rippling through him and his thumbs dug into Harry's hips hard to keep from touching himself. He let Harry's cock slip entirely from his mouth. It sprang back up, bobbing towards his abdomen and Draco tilted his head to the right as he leaned in, experimentally licking a broad stripe up Harry's bollocks to the base of his cock. He heard a gasp above him, causing him to do it again, his nose pressing into the soft top of Harry's scrotum as he licked. A deep, guttural groan caught in Harry's throat.
Someone clapped Harry on the shoulder and the whiskey that had just settled into his stomach threatened to change direction. He inhaled deeply, willing it back down, swallowing repeatedly.
While Harry watched him, he opened his mouth and swept his come-covered tongue over his lips like a whore before licking them clean again. Then, without ever breaking eye contact and with his fist still flying over his prick, he swallowed - his adam's apple bobbing as Harry's thick spunk slid down his throat.
"Lumos," he said, and the light revealed a bedroom not quite as large as the master, but still big enough to house several small families. It was everything Harry expected Draco Malfoy's bedroom to be. Huge. Luxurious. Obnoxious. Across the room, there was a large, four-poster bed draped in dark green standing on a centered platform. Near the left wall, two very comfortable looking black easy chairs were set across from each other, separated by what had to be an expensive antique dark wood table. Behind the sitting area were large windows overlooking the Manor's moonlit back gardens. Harry noted the two large bookshelves, both completely filled, on the wall to his right. Another, large ornate door matching the one behind him was set in the back right corner of the room, a short distance away from the shelves. Harry thought of his cupboard under the stairs.
No. No, because that would have made Potter a murderer, and he wouldn't wish his own future fate on his worst ... enemy.
if you were enjoying yourself, Potter. It certainly sounded like it." His arms were crossed, his voice his usual drawl despite the explosion of his nerves.
“’Mione?” Harry said, confused. “Wha’s ‘Mione doin’ here?” She didn’t usually come out when someone in their Department had a birthday.
“Yes – oh, how sweet! What’s your name, little one?” Hermione said to the baby, expecting his parents to answer her.
Harry could feel said shots in his stomach, rolling around as he walked, beginning to feel sicker by the minute and still wishing Ron would talk about anything,
Harry unfroze himself and brought his empty hand up against his other shoulder blade, the pads of his calloused fingers digging as he moaned softly into Draco's mouth, tongue slowly reciprocating.
Snape brought his own wand up again, muttering under his breath and Harry eyes glazed over again for a moment.
Harry's heart was hammering the inside of his chest. He was seconds away from treading into extremely unfamiliar territory. Although very different with another man, the kissing, grinding, blow jobs - he had had his fair share of that with Ginny. But this. This was new. He wasn't completely oblivious to what was about to happen, of course. It's not as if he had never seen porn. He knew why Draco had made the effort to get the lube. Harry watched him uncork the vial and pour some into his hand, and Harry had the uncomfortable feeling that this wasn't the first time Draco had done this. Jealousy surged through him just as Draco's slick hand closed around his cock, making his hips buck involuntarily. In a moment Draco was once again straddling his hips, and Harry was sure his lungs were refusing to function properly. Draco reached behind himself, holding Harry's cock straight as he began to sink backwards. The head of Harry's cock slipped past Draco's opening once, twice, and then past the point of no return. Small sounds were being wrenched from Draco's throat as he took Harry in, slowly sinking further down. Harry watched Draco's pained expression with as much concern as he could muster through the lust that consumed him.
Harry looked back at him, his eyes showing something challenging, firey and commanding yet somehow still soft and vulnerable in their depths.
"Oh yes, you were," he hissed back. "From the train to the astronomy tower, Potter, you stalked me. I bet all you thought about was me."
"You still haven't answered me," he said, his voice coming out in an unintentional whisper, and no amount of self-restraint could stop his eyes from roaming down that tan, gorgeously toned body that was more perfect than any fantasy could produce.
to look up at Malfoy as he leaned in with his cigarette to the flame. Sucking in, the tip glowed orange and he promptly tried to stop himself from coughing. Malfoy, a knowing smirk on his face, brought the flame up to his own, sucking in deeply and then exhaling a large plume of smoke in a sigh of relief that sounded far too sexual for Harry’s comfort. He shifted his weight from his left foot to his right, trying not to sway, looking away from Malfoy and cursing firewhiskey for making him feel so pleasantly insane.
Draco felt his feet moving before his mind could catch up to what he was doing. It seemed that his brain had already made the decision for him. That, or his cock had, pushing hard against the front of his trousers. He tried willing himself to breathe correctly.
Draco immediately interrupted that thought with an angry scream, amplified tenfold in the small cabinet space he had been standing in, working to repair it unsuccessfully.
"I'll leave right now if you really want, Potter," he breathed against his lips. "Just say it and I'll go away and pretend this never happened."
"That's not true," he lied again quickly, horrified that Malfoy was mostly right. Other than horcruxes and his infatuation with Ginny, Harry had been obsessed with the other man. The taps to the tub magically stopped at the perfect water capacity.
going to hex him until he felt a fist - still tightly enclosed around a wand - press into his shoulder blade. It brought him just the tiniest bit closer, increasing the pressure of their closed-mouth kiss just so.
"Do you still want this, Potter?" he said just loud enough to be heard over the water hitting the back of his calves.
"Say what?" he asked, his eyes nervously darting back and forth between Malfoy's grey ones to his pink, flushed lips, standing out against his pale skin.
"Listen," he breathed in Draco's rapidly coloring face, "Don't you dare talk about my family like that ever again." He let Draco struggle a single second longer. He then released his arm and Draco shrilly gasped in air, the purple color quickly fading from his face at the intake of oxygen. He started coughing, and Harry loudly said over him, "And I wouldn't tell you I'm sorry something happened to you unless I meant it."
He knew exactly why they shouldn't, but Draco was leaning back onto his bed, his grey eyes dark with lust, slowly pulling Harry by the wrist on top of him, and Harry couldn't bring himself to stop the other man. He found his left knee pressed between the soft flesh of Draco's alabaster white thighs, and Draco had released his wrist to wrap his arm around Harry's waist, pushing his hand into the small of his back. The motion caused Harry to bend forward and Draco leaned in to kiss him. He let his tongue explore Draco's mouth and felt Draco's hand sliding further from the small of his back to grope his arse, wondering how on Earth he could have ever thought of trying to prevent this.
“Gin –” he said quietly. “I’m – I am really sorry, though,” he said, although he wasn’t sure if he would ever be able to tell her the real reason why.
Malfoy kissed him like he needed Harry's mouth on his in order to breathe, one hand tightly wound into Harry’s thick black hair and the other clutching the side of his face. His tongue explored Harry’s mouth with a passionate, desperate intensity that went straight to Harry’s cock, hardening quickly beneath his denims.
"You're going to the Ministry, Malfoy. And you're going to be tried, and you're going to lose." he ground out, an inch away from Draco's face.
"You wanted me to leave? Why?" Harry's heart panged with guilt, but Draco spoke again before Harry could answer.  "You know what? I don't care. You're pathetic, Potter," but it didn't sound genuine at all. He sounded afraid. Unsure. Hurt. "What were you even thinking I'd do? Vanish the vials? There's a hundred more you've sealed off. There's probably enough evidence left in there to put my father away for all of eternity. Or maybe I'd apparate away with your precious wand? Maybe your clothes, too, Potter, so that your fellow aurors, just as brilliant as you, I'm sure, would have to rescue you from my bedroom while you're starkers. For fuck's sake." He threw Harry's things at him and turned on his heels back into the bathroom, where seconds later Harry heard the sloshing of water.
Potter,” Malfoy said, hand finally closing around something in his pocket. He pulled a pack of cigarettes –
It was dark and crowded out back, only a dingy yellow light providing just enough of an amber glow to see. There was a bench meant to seat four people comfortably currently being occupied by seven, not including the girl sitting on her friend’s lap, giggling as they talked to some bloke with a plethora of tattoos who was wearing tight muggle clothing.
"Mrs. Malfoy," Harry panted, partially from scrambling for his wand and glasses and partially due to the amazing orgasm he had had only a minute ago.
Draco stopped, staring ahead at nothing. He then turned his head just barely enough to speak over his right shoulder without looking at the other man.
of all people, and worse yet was the knowledge that it was only the first of many. And of course, as if everything else wasn't enough to deal with, there was also the omnipresent problem in his life: Lord Voldemort.
The small difference in their height was now very apparent in their proximity. Draco stared down his nose only centimeters away from Harry's own, their breath mingling together.
"You're right. They don't. That's not an answer to my question, though." Harry was not about to let Malfoy get away with half-truths and indirect answers. Draco must have sensed this of him, judging by the way his eyes narrowed. A moment later he spoke in a dangerously low voice.
Harry had lunged forward, knocking Draco's back flat into the wall behind him, his right forearm pressed into his throat, effectively cutting off his speech. He was still holding his wand, it's tip now pointed over Harry's own left shoulder as he held Malfoy in place by his neck. He still held the vials in his other hand, gripping them almost tight enough to shatter the glass into his palm. Draco, being quite strong for his slender frame, pushed his hands hard against the forearm strangling him and panicked when Harry didn't budge an inch.
"Are you sure you're an Auror?" Before Harry could retort he casually walked over to the door and said, "Treacle tart." Harry heard the click, and the door opened slightly. Draco stepped forward first, waving his hand in a rather flamboyant motion, causing the room's light fixtures to spring to life. Harry, whose wand was still pointed at Draco, moved in behind him to find himself in large, elegant marble bathroom.
"Yes," she said. "I did." Neither of them mentioned what both knew: Narcissa only lied in his favor because Draco had still been alive.
He was close enough now that he could hear the small whimper that escaped from the other man - a sound he knew from his own experience that orgasm was near.
"Alohamora." Locked. Harry tried a few other spells to no avail. He sighed angrily and began to examine the rest of Draco's large closet, his frustration apparent as he picked up items of clothing and tossed them aside. He kicked a few pairs of dress shoes that had probably cost more than his newly purchased broom out of his way to examine the walls, grateful when he found them to be just stupid walls. He maneuvered around a long, fancy looking sofa that was in the center of the closet, back to the mysterious second door. Just as Harry was considering blowing the damn thing off its hinges, he heard faint footsteps coming towards him.
And Harry, only for millionth time that week alone, had to remind himself that things were very different now that Voldemort was dead. He and Malfoy were no longer attending school together. They hadn't been for quite some time, and - he realized with a pang of some strange emotion he couldn't recognize - they never would again.
to hear him admit that. He would love to see Potter come like this, just by slowly jerking him off and watching him lose control under
"I can't," Harry gasped, "Draco, I-" Draco pulled his mouth off Harry with a smack, not wanting Harry to come just then. He quickly stood up and brought his mouth down on Harry's, kissing him with fierce eagerness.
The seconds passed as he fell from his high, slowly opening his heavy eyelids while his lungs were trying to absorb as much oxygen as fast as they could. Part of the tiled wall, Harry's right leg and his inner thigh were all striped with Draco's come, dripping down like rivulets of wet paint on canvas.
Draco opened his mouth to tell him, except that he had nothing to say. His memories didn't lie to him, as much as he had tried to ignore their hidden honesty. Harry's question was exactly what that radical voice of his own had been asking for a long time.
"It's not. I know it. I know there's something there." Malfoy rolled his eyes and pushed himself off the wall to pace around the room yet again.
Snape stopped, his lips pressed into a thin line from being interrupted, his black eyes darting between them.
"The other part figured you'd be too noble." Harry managed a small smile in return, and then Draco was slowly leaning into him, giving Harry all the time in the world to change his mind, to turn away, to flee, but he didn't. He knew he wanted it, despite everything. He selfishly let Draco kiss him and it was terribly wonderful.
have burst through the gap in the trees and directed his father and the others directly towards him, Weasley, and Granger - exactly as his father would have expected him to. For the first time in his life that night - he did the opposite.
As the crowd around their table thinned out a bit, the waitress returned, expertly holding a tray above her head with one hand and turning to her side to move between the patrons. She carefully set it down on the table in front of Harry.
"Yes. I was," he whispered, and his wand - though still tightly gripped - was now completely at his side.
He heard Harry's breath hitch and he wrapped his hand around the base of the hard length in front of his face, the little finger of his right hand disappearing into a thick patch of wet, black curls. He licked his lips, his mouth practically watering for it as he quickly leaned in.
"I just do, alright!" Malfoy did not respond, only rested his hands on his slim hips while his chest heaved with the burden of returning his lungs back to their normal pace. "Malfoy, how did your friend die?" Harry said a few minutes later, still speaking gently despite everything.
"Sort of," Harry said, smirking as he pulled a near-liquid like fabric from a deep pocket inside his robe.
Sex had never been like that at all with Ginny, now that he thought about it. Not even their first time, which Harry had always regarded as being quite amazing up until a few moments ago. Being with Draco today alone was the most wonderful, intense, ridiculous, beautiful, passionate experience he had ever had. It made his heart ache and left his mind in a confused panic. If he really had figured it out correctly earlier, just how long had Draco been in love with him? And if he stopped lying to himself, when had he started to love Draco back?
"If you think it's so damn funny I'll detain you right now!" Harry said, nostrils flaring as he took a step closer and raised his wand higher. Malfoy stopped laughing but his sneer remained.
Draco stared at him blankly, his expression perfectly unreadable. "My mother, Potter. She - she brings food here once a month." The facade of Malfoy's pride wore thin and Harry could hear the shame and embarrassment in his words. He lowered his wand.
"Stupid Gryffindor," Draco murmured, but Harry heard no malice in his voice. He looked into grey eyes, letting the fabric of Draco's undershirt slip from his hand, and suddenly, like someone was connecting a jigsaw puzzle in his mind, everything clicked together.
Harry, who had never smoked a cigarette before in his entire life, mimicked the girl’s actions – minus the scandalous look – or so he
"Holy shit," Draco gasped, staring at the fabric in his hands wide-eyed. There was no other explanation. "Harry - this is - this is
"You're not hexing me, yet, Potter," he stated, hope flooding back into his veins like some sort of dangerously addictive drug. It infected his brain and made him feel invincible as adrenaline coursed through him. He just
– but then Malfoy sucked on Harry’s bottom lip, frantically gripping Harry’s t-shirt as they leaned against the brick and the sound of his blood rushing against his ears drowned that voice out.
“Jessie!” Their misbehaved sixteen-year-old acquaintance squealed back and embraced the other in a tight hug. “How have you
"Romilda Vane - she's a fourth year in my house, she's been messing about with love potions all year and -"
Harry was clambering up from his barstool. He stumbled a bit as he got re-adjusted to gravity and followed Malfoy and the girl, whose name neither of them knew, to the back door of the bar that lead out to the smoking patio.
Harry glared at both Snape and Draco before he turned away, marching off towards Gryffindor Tower without ever glancing back.
Harry began to thrust against him, repeatedly grinding his naked body against Draco's with a look of determined desperation on his face. The consistent hot pressure coupled with Harry's avidity further threatened his hold on himself and he knew if he didn't do something about it quickly this would be over much too soon. He let the small, slick flesh leave his lips with a gasp.
"Fuck, Potter," Draco gasped, resting his forehead against Harry's and thrusting his hips up into the exquisite pressure. Harry's eyes locked onto Draco's and he just began to speed his hand up when he felt the other man grab his wrist, stopping him. Harry, unable to stop himself, whined, already desperate for release.
Severus went completely still for a moment, as if someone had replaced his spinal column with a steel rod. Draco silently cried against him and Snape released a breath, finally leaning in, one spindly hand cradling the back of Draco's head and the other splayed in-between his shoulder blades.
." His voice was muffled as he spoke to his thighs, his elbows now digging against his knees as he gripped the back of his own head.
"I have heard from the one who cries," he continued, his voice leaving a creepy, quiet echo. "We normally do not interfere with matters of the living - and yet - you
And despite how wrong it was, Draco was hardening at the thought. While he would never force it, the fantasy that he had been wanking to for the better part of that year was possib-
"What?" Harry said and Snape ignored him, silently pleading Draco to understand the weight of his words.
"How da- I - you stole my wand!" he sputtered. Oh, this was good, Harry thought. Getting Malfoy to sputter. That was definitely not something he did often, if ever.
"Well, who are you expecting, then?" Draco, who had clearly anticipated Harry asking why he had decided against fleeing the country with his parents, looked taken aback for a single second.
“Ex- what?” he asked, realizing that he forgot to ash as he went to attempt a second drag and quickly doing so. He inhaled carefully and surprisingly didn’t feel an urge to cough this time.
"Yes, of course, lest I curse you from behind with the wand I don't have." Harry had been making his way over to the large room off to the left, directly behind Malfoy when he stopped.
"Or maybe it was in Madam Malkins," Draco whispered. "The first time you saw me." Harry knelt next to the tub, Draco's eyes following his movement.
“Ecstasy – you know – Mandy? It’s a muggle drug,” she said, giggling. “I’ve never done it, but it’s supposed to be
"Don't touch me, Potter," he hissed as he jerked his left shoulder out of Harry's right hand. The motion made multiple strands of his white blonde hair dislodge themselves from their neat, combed back positions and take up new residence in front of his grey eyes. Harry became slightly concerned that he noticed such a trivial thing, but the stinging emotion of hurt he felt at Draco's words positively alarmed him.
Draco choked slightly as he slowly pulled off of Harry, wanting to draw out this miraculous situation for as long as possible. With lips still wrapped around the tip, he looked up and found green eyes that were positively burning into him. Harry's mouth was shut tight, his jaw set hard and Draco understood that Harry was also holding himself off.
After a very long walk through the castle, in which Draco had to repeatedly think of an array of disgusting things to keep himself from fully hardening every time Harry's bum brushed against his front, they finally arrived at the gargoyle statue blocking entrance to the Headmaster's office.
"That's quite alright, Draco dear, I've accepted my own wrongdoings and I am prepared for the consequences." She drew herself up to full height, her beautiful haughty appearance somewhat intimidating.
Ginny said very softly, gently sweeping her fingers over their new son’s cheeks, tufts of wild black hair sticking out of where the blanket wrapped around the baby’s head. His little cries had stopped the moment Ginny had spoken, making cute little scrunched faces, his swollen eyes still closed. “It’s all right, Mummy’s here,” she said, pressing a few small kisses to his soft face and rocking him gently for a few moments. “Daddy’s here, too,” she whispered with a smile, and then passed the precious bundle slowly into Harry’s arms.
"Was it now?" Draco said, his voice falsely inquisitive. "Or were you just thinking with your dick?"
Feeling sick with himself, he turned from Malfoy without a word and stumbled through the sparse few shady looking people who were still out there smoking, praying that they had been minding their own business.
"Yessss," Draco hissed into his ear, and Harry very nearly came from that alone. He desperately wanted to throw the vials, evidence be damned, to the floor and rip off every piece of clothing keeping their skin apart. Harry did not dare to stop, however, fearing that if he did so even for a moment, one of them might regain sanity.
That's exactly what Harry wanted, he realized, slowly pulling out from him as much as he could. That's always what he had wanted. To make Draco's composure disappear. To get the other boy to show his true emotions. To completely undo Draco Malfoy. He shoved his hips upwards roughly, his hands forcing Draco's hips down, their skin meeting with a loud slap. A strangled moan came from Draco, but it wasn't enough. Harry wanted to make him scream. Draco had already pulled his hips up, and quickly slid back, again, and again, and Harry was losing himself in Draco, his own composure already non-existent as he moaned in abandon under him. He thrust his hips up to meet Draco, and that something that had been ignited became ablaze when Draco licked his lips for a single second, the image sending Harry into a craze.
Harry should have punched him. He should have thrown Malfoy away in disgust. He should not have closed his eyes and moaned. Catching himself, Harry's eyes snapped back open, and Malfoy was smiling. Not smirking. Not even sneering. There was a smile on the blonde's mouth, and Harry was momentarily stupefied by his beauty.
"That's it, Malfoy, I've had it. I'm going to detain you." Harry started moving forward towards him.
"You want it?" Harry rasped, his head bent forward and the water from his hair dripping onto Draco's face. He looked nearly feral with his chest heaving, pressing his cock harder against Draco's cheek, still forcefully holding his head back by his hair. If not for the mild pain he felt at the back of his skull, Draco would have been absolutely sure he was having the most fantastic dream. He moaned as he opened his mouth for it, his erection jumping from his own act of submission.
hexed him or told him to get out. He should admit his defeat now and find some stupid excuse for his brief lack of sanity. He was utterly foolish for thinking Potter would ever-
The stream of the shower separated them and Harry lifted his wand into it halfheartedly, causing the same effect of putting the back of a spoon under a running tap. The fact that he was completely defenseless against Potter right now thrilled him; his wand was still inside his sweat-soaked robe back in the entrance room.
Almost all of his fellow Gryffindors were angry with him and rightfully so; he was their team Captain and he went and got himself banned from the most important match. If he were them, he'd be angry at him too. It also didn't help that just as many Slytherins were gloating about the situation for the past few days, adding salt to the wound. And despite Ginny snapping at her, Hermione would not give up her lectures on the supposed dangers of the Prince and Harry soon found himself looking for ways to avoid her.
“I admire a man who can hold his liquor,” she gave him a flirty little laugh. Harry watched Malfoy’s smirk spread into a small, devilish grin as he looked at her, taking in the show.
"I didn't expect you to take anything from me, Potter." His words made Harry's heart sink straight into his stomach. It made him sound like he had assaulted Draco, like it hadn't been consensual. But it had been, Harry told himself, hating the way his cock stirred as he remembered Draco hissing agreement into his ear.
"I'd hardly call that stealing, Malfoy. You practically gave it to me." If there was any color left in Malfoy's already pale complexion, it soon fled. He averted Harry's gaze and remained silent. Harry tried his best not to appear shocked by the reaction. Malfoy had never been one to stand down. He always had had some infuriating retort, always knew exactly what to say to get under Harry's skin, always stuck it to him until fists were flying and blood was pouring.
"I'll stay in front," he said. He could feel Harry's warm breath on his face and although the Cloak had slightly dimmed their light, he was sure Harry was blushing again.
His extreme satisfaction with this fascinating revelation was quickly replaced with annoyance. Harry had still only blinked in silence, his confusion palpable, and Draco wondered if Harry knew his own family history. It had been required of him to learn his own, as per tradition.
Draco was only too aware how much skill it indeed required. His heart sank into his stomach, making him feel sick.
“Harry! There you are!” Hermione said rushing over, smiling broadly. “Come on you two drunkards, let’s go.”
Harry ushered them out of the closet and back into the master bedroom, all while feeling terribly uncomfortable with current state of his trousers. He moved his wand swiftly, effectively blockading the door to the closet, barring access to anyone except Ministry officials.
broke the last bit of self-restraint he had. He hurriedly wrapped a fist around his own aching member, his lips buzzing against the silk-soft skin of Harry's dick as they caught his own moan.
"Draco…" Snape said softly, crouching down next to him. His heavy black cloak created a crescent moon behind him on the floor and he wrapped an arm around his shoulders. "I know.
"Draco," he whispered, his own voice sounding far away. Draco opened his eyes and stopped, staring at Harry beneath him as if he couldn't believe their current reality. "Draco, are you alright?" He rested his hands gently on his hips and was answered by the trademark Malfoy smirk. Without warning, Draco let himself drop, burying Harry's cock inside himself in an instant. Harry threw his head back and yelled. "Shit," he gasped, his eyes watering from the sudden intensity. He had never felt anything so hot, so tight, in all his life.
"Don't worry. I'm very good at pretending to be someone I'm not." His long, pale fingers gracefully swept away his own tears and he resumed his haughty, arrogant stature. He gave Snape a curt nod and turned on his heels towards the dungeons.
"Were you two fighting?" she asked loudly. Draco's eyes were wide with what must have been fear, and all Harry could manage was an ‘er,’ before Narcissa quickly drew her wand. "If you have hurt one hair on my Draco's head, I will-"
He knew why Draco didn't reject him earlier, why Draco had tormented him endlessly at school, why Draco couldn't kill Dumbledore when he had the chance. He knew why Draco didn't give him away when the snatchers had brought them here. The pure emotion of it all struck Harry like a bludger and Harry's mind whirled, thinking of Ron and Hermione's ceaseless bickering for years on end, of Dumbledore's tears of pain and regret over Grindelwald, of Severus Snape, who went to his grave still hopelessly in love with his mother.
"Are you alright, Potter?" Draco breathed back, and Harry could hear that smirk in his tone. It ignited something in him, something fierce, something that couldn't forget that Draco Malfoy had once been his enemy. Harry answered back by thrusting his hips up, causing Draco to lose balance and fall forward. Harry seized his opportunity, quickly bringing his knees up and his feet flat on the bed. Draco's face, inches away from his own, struggled to keep composure.
Harry's moan echoed off the tile walls, and he moved his hand from Draco's shoulder to his head, threading his fingers through white blonde hair. Draco removed his hand from Harry's cock, grabbing both of his hips and inhaling deeply through his nose as he took Harry all the way into his throat. Harry cried out, gripping blonde hair tightly in both of his fists. Draco pulled back quickly and sucked him in entirely again, and again, and –
big, curving just a bit towards his navel - flushed at the crown and still rock hard despite the interruption. He unconsciously licked his lips.
And just as he had in his fantasy, Harry tangled his hands into his wet, blonde hair, gripping and moving with Draco's head as it began to bob. Although he had never done it before, giving head was far from Advanced Arithmancy and he was enjoying every bit of it as much as he knew he would - if sucking his own fingers while he wanked had been any indication. Every motion of his mouth caused a new sound to be wrenched out of Potter, each one of them going straight to his own, ignored cock.
"I am," he said, finally pulling his lips away and panting. "I want it. I've wanted you so bad, Harry." He saw lust replace the shock - whether from using his first name or the blatant confession, he didn't know - on the brunette's face.
He could see the rapid rise and fall of Harry's chest and Harry slowly shook his head, green eyes still bearing into him hard.
"It's alright, Potter, call me whatever you want. I'm not expecting a sudden confession of love just because we fucked." Harry felt his heart drop hearing Draco revert to his cold, cruel tones so quickly.
When Harry still looked dumbfounded, Draco supposed Harry thought he was one of those conspiracy loonies like Lovegood, and quickly rushed to explain himself.
do. Cunningly use any means to achieve ends, or whatever that old pile of rags had said. But that reckless, radical voice deep inside his head vehemently disagreed.
"Right," he said, turning towards them and speaking to Narcissa. "I - I'll be finishing up my search, then. I should be done in half an hour." She nodded her understanding. Harry caught Draco's stunned gaze briefly as he left them there, wishing he hadn't. He knew that by letting Narcissa go, he was losing Draco. While apparition wasn't impossible without a wand, it was immeasurably more difficult. If Draco had decided to get the hell out of there by side-along with his mum, Harry would not have blamed him for doing so.
Ginny started laughing hard again but this time she stopped with a gasp, beginning to breathe very quickly. “Oh –
In the 30 or so seconds he had spent ripping his clothes off, he had not noticed the faint rushing sound of water coming from the far end of the next room. The sound he
“Wasn’t playing anything, Potter.” he said, not answering Harry’s second question as he tossed the butt away carelessly.
Draco knew there could only be one other person at Hogwarts who was as crazy as he was to fly the pitch less than an hour before curfew...
He wrapped his left arm, hand still clutching the two memory vials, around Draco's back, causing their bodies - save for the awkward space where Draco's trapped arm was - to press flush against each other. Harry wasn't sure who broke the kiss first, except that they both pulled away to gasp at the feel of their hard, fabric covered cocks suddenly pressed together. Draco's eyes were glazed over, his swollen lips standing out stark red against his pale features.
Harry watched silently, remembering just how nervous he had been the first time this had happened a little over a year ago, and he was feeling just as nervous again, but his second child was only half the reason why.
His charade was finally over. He looked to Harry searching for an answer, and Harry gave it to him with a kiss. It was nothing like earlier, no ferocity, no frustration. It was slow and sweet and filled with unspoken understanding and need. Draco's hands gathered the fabric of Harry's t-shirt, lifting it out of his jeans. It snagged on the metal back of the button closure, and Draco broke their kiss.
"I assure you I've already showed you all the Manor's secrets." Harry was still pointing his wand at the offending spot.
Malfoy had to force away his prominent Slytherin nature and spoiled upbringing that called for him to disobey order and take what he wanted
"I don't know, do I? Probably somewhere in Germany. And last I checked Potter, full grown adults do not require parental supervision."
Harry’s hips involuntarily canted forward, meeting the other man’s and then their hard cocks were instantly pressed against each other through thick layers of fabric, sending shivers through them both. Harry heard Malfoy’s low groan in his ear before the blonde’s mouth covered his again in another searing kiss.
Draco stepped only six more inches forward right into the shower stall and Harry immediately stepped back, his back pressed flat against the cool tiles.
He watched Snape's memory play in his mind's eye - a little girl with dark red hair was sitting near a lake next to him, laughing. She turned and smiled - her gorgeous, emerald green eyes sparkling. He was thrown out as fast as he had been allowed in, but it was all he needed to see.
Hermione laughed and blushed as Ron wrapped an arm around her. Harry’s vision blurred and he brought a hand up to his face.
Harry's eyes grew wide at his brazen display and he stepped back a bit, causing the streaming water to come down directly over his head. He leaned to the side to avoid it.
hand. However, as great as that would definitely be, he was dead set on bringing Potter to completion with his mouth.
, Malfoy,” he said, knocking it back. He immediately reached for the second and then the third, doing the same.
Draco, I - please, I'm -" Harry was a babbling mess above him and he knew that at this rate this was heading towards the end at full speed.
Harry jumped off the bed and raced after Draco. It had only been a few seconds, but Draco was already standing in the doorway to his extravagant bathroom, Harry's wand in one hand and his cloak in the other.
Harry made a small noise of surprise in response and Draco drank it in, tongue finding his paralyzed one and caressing it. He dipped it under Harry's tongue, moving it against the slick underside and back over again.
"You know," Draco spoke first, his voice deeper than usual from sleep, "for some reason, a part of me thought you would leave, Potter."
Draco, apparently forgetting who he was and how he was supposed to act, gaped from his mother to Harry, not sure who he was more in awe of - his mother, for effectively lying to Lord Voldemort, or Harry Potter, the boy who wouldn't die.
"Yeah?" he said sarcastically, letting his anger and bitterness get the best of him. He finally looked up at Harry, his eyes puffy and red from crying. "Can he help my father gain back his reputation and power after Azkaban? Can he help restore glory to the Malfoy family name? Can
"Good. We're on the same page, then, Scarhead," he said, his trademark smirk appearing on his lips that were still only an inch away from Harry's. And although it was true, that these recent occurrences would never change the fact that Draco would always be Draco and Harry would always be Harry, things had changed, and things would still change.
After a few seconds, Harry gently pushed him back a bit to watch him undress in a dazed fascination, like he had somehow never before seen another bloke undress. As Draco undid the second to last button, the fabric slipped from his grasp, the weight of the wet, heavy wool sinking quickly down his legs.
For years and years, Draco had never even thought of asking why. And then he saw his father don his Death Eater robes for the first time, marching with the others who did so to torture those muggles at the Quidditch World Cup. As he watched from the trees, he saw the joyous atmosphere of the campground turn into a horrendous nightmare. Singing turned to screaming, children's laughter turning to pitiful cries and Draco finally wondered why.
Harry's brows furrowed together, eyes sternly focusing on Malfoy's features, trying desperately to detect any trace of a lie. He found nothing but truth.
“It’s a boy!” the Healer announced to them, as they had chosen not to know until this very moment. Harry, still guilt ridden though he was, leaned in and kissed Ginny sweetly, tears prickling at his eyes as the assistant brought a bundle over to their arms.
Ignoring his sober voice of reason that told him winning this stupid, impromptu challenge that had erupted after the two men – who had not seen each other for nearly six years – didn’t matter, Harry reached for another shot.
He then decided he deserved some sort of honorary dual house membership to Gryffindor because leaning forward and pressing his lips to Potter's instead of answering him properly was a complete act of bravery.
"I still live here, Potter." Draco said, sounding just as he did when they had still been school rivals. His grey eyes roamed over the contents of his closet, now strewn about the floor.
"You told me nothing. You are in no position to keep anything from me. I'll ask only once more, Malfoy. If you don't tell me the truth, I'll have you chucked in Azkaban faster than you can blink. Who. Are. You. Expecting?"
"That's got to be it. It must be. It must." Harry was just as shocked by Malfoy's quiet sobs as he was the first time he had heard them, still not forgiving himself for almost killing the crying man.
Harry abruptly stopped walking, ducking into an alleyway before promptly vomiting on to the pavement.
"Are you sure?" Draco said only inches away now, so close to pressing himself against the other man that he could feel Harry's body heat adding to the heat of the water now coming down on just his back.
"Tergeo," Harry whispered, wand pointed on himself as soon as he was alone. The cleaning spell did nothing to remove his immense guilt. He continued walking down the empty hall, arriving at a large, ornate wooden door. Draco's bedroom was the last room he had to search. Harry mentally kicked himself.
With his restraint gone, he sped up, his mouth matching the same brutal rhythm his hand had begun. Harry's back arched off of the wall, hands still tightly wound into Draco's hair as he thrust his hips to meet the erratic new pace, his mouth hanging open as he panted.
– cigarette lighter from his pocket. The girl held the cigarette delicately against her lips between the index and middle fingers of her right hand, needlessly leaning over and looking up at Malfoy in a positively scandalous way. Malfoy lit hers up first and then, with the same flame, held it out to Harry.
would make him stop, because there was no way he was able to go back now. Not now – not when he finally knew what he had been missing, not when he was fueled by so much desire and by so much whiskey.
"And seeing as you already have detention with me starting tomorrow morning, Potter," he said, loudly speaking over him. "I no longer feel it necessary to disturb the Headmaster so late... You may return to your common room."
"It's past eleven," Draco said, now fully dressed back in his school uniform that he had charmed clean. He touched the tip of his wand behind his right ear and cast a drying charm on his hair. It fell softly around his face, almost touching his shoulders and naturally parted at the right side. He removed the hair in his eyes with a small jerk of his head and immediately reached into his locker behind him. He pulled out a vial of a thick, purple potion he concocted himself. Uncorking it and pouring a small glob in his left palm, he then carefully returned the cork and vial and shut his locker with his elbow. He rubbed his hands together and carded his long fingers back through his hair only once, leaving it perfectly slicked back as usual.
He started to wonder, his sluggish brain starting to function again. His fantasies had, of course, never proceeded to this point and now that he was regaining his senses again, fear began to settle back in.
"Hominum Revelio." Nothing. Well, at least it was only Malfoy that Harry had to deal with. Harry watched him close the door, keeping his wand on him. His hair had grown slightly past his shoulders and he looked malnourished. As an Auror, Harry knew that he was to immediately detain him and escort him back to the Ministry. As Harry, he completely ignored that. "What the hell are you doing here, Malfoy?"
"Er, sorry," he said quickly, snapping his hand back. Draco gaped at him at for a moment, and Harry was glad to have his sudden strange emotions replaced with irritation. "What?"
Harry watched the baby squirm a bit in his arms, slowly opening his eyes at Harry’s voice, and Ginny gasped.
Draco watched the dreamy look overtake him, choking back a sob as he erased Harry's memory completely from now until he had made what had been the best decision of his life to interrupt him in the shower.
Draco realized what Harry was doing a moment before he did it, and while his brain was screaming at him to stop it, his heart let it happen.
. He grit his teeth from the effort, his heart sinking as he looked up. With his luck, Harry had probably finally regained his sanity and was going to tell him to stop.
"Did you see it happen?" Malfoy only stared at Harry, so Harry started again. "Malfoy, did you see-"
Harry swallowed and nodded quickly and even Draco's sudden fear could not diminish the weeping erection between his legs.
– express so much intense desire for him so blatantly. Everything with Ginny had always been so timid and sweet and gentle and –
“Mmm. I see. Good thing Law Enforcement doesn’t know then, yes?” he asked her quietly, looking at Harry pointedly. She caught the look and immediately looked terrified.
"It doesn't," he whispered, afraid to finally admit what he had always known. His eyes were drawn to Harry's hand still gently clasped around his left wrist. Very slowly, he moved his arm back and lightly threaded his fingers through Harry's. "None of it matters."
Harry blinked rapidly, noticing his surroundings again. He looked incredibly confused to find himself standing in front of the Headmaster's office with Snape and Draco looking at him.
No, the events of his life had never happened suddenly. He hadn't suddenly called things off with Ginny. He had called things off ages ago at Dumbledore's funeral for his self-planned death. He had known then what he still knows now. He hadn't just randomly slept with Draco Malfoy out of nowhere, all the sudden - it was after years of pent up frustration and repressed attractions that finally came to fruition. And he hadn't suddenly fallen in love with the man sleeping soundly next to him. It had happened over the course of those years, over the realizations that they weren't all that different in the end.
cigarettes – out and set them down on the table before turning to the young girl. “Look at this shit and tell me he
"From the pensieve room?" She said quietly. She looked at them both and then looked at the spot of chipped paint on the wall whose reappearance had gone unnoticed. "I've been trying to get in there for years. How did you do it?"
Then he immediately sunk through the floor, disappearing from sight. Draco stared at his feet and inhaled deeply, his heart starting to beat again. Stunned at the encounter, he slowly turned back to the broken Vanishing cabinet behind him in a daze.
"I can't tell you that," he immediately replied, still refusing to look at the other man. He tried to ignore the immense guilt he felt over Bell and Weasley welling up inside of him.
She let the surprise show on her face only for a moment. "Take it as a returned favor for saving my life." Draco's own reservations flew out of the window and he opened his mouth in shock.
The sounds of panting, soft moans, the bed creaking quietly, and the rhythmic slapping of skin was incredibly intoxicating. Even more so was the sight of Draco beneath him, drastically different from his usual pristine condition. His blonde hair was mussed against the bed, flawless white skin blotched with red, and he was trying his best to trap any moan trying to escape. Harry could tell Malfoy was still holding back. He was still forcing himself to keep his composure, a certain kind of rigidity he was taught to display from infancy. It only furthered Harry's desire to dissolve all of that, to see what was hiding beneath. Amidst a fire raging within himself, he bent his head down to kiss Draco. The intimacy of the act caught Draco off guard, and he let himself whimper into Harry's mouth, the sound sending tremors straight through him. As they parted, Harry felt Draco's left hand release its vice grip from his bicep to reach between them and fist his own cock hurriedly, moaning desperately against Harry's lips as he did so. Enthralled by this, Harry sped up, grunting "God, yes, Draco,” and pounding his cock deep into him. Harry felt Draco's hand between them still, noticing some unreadable expression appear on his face once again, even during this lapse in both their sanities, and Harry groaned in frustration.
Harry stared at the empty doorway for a moment, trying to make up his mind. Cursing himself for everything that was, is, and would be, he stepped over his belongings into the bathroom. Draco was in the tub, still full of hot, steaming water from over an hour ago. A delicate fragrance was wafting from the steam, slightly fogging Harry's glasses. He stood next to the tub as Draco let his head fall back into the water with a sigh, his white blonde hair darkening to a pale gold and sticking to his neck and shoulders as he came back up. He was a beautiful, mesmerizing sight and Harry couldn't help but stare.
"In the forest. At the end," Harry forced himself to say, really preferring to not remember the events of that day. "After Voldemort's killing curse hit me and I came 'round, he had your mum check to see if I was alive. She lied to him."
Harry was sure that in any second, Draco's fist would be colliding with his face. However, many seconds had now passed, and he was definitely not being punched. Malfoy was kissing him back. Harry's stomach was doing enough flips to earn a gold medal. Draco had actually parted his lips and Harry's heartbeat was thundering so loud in his ears he almost missed the small noise Malfoy made when their tongues first met. Harry could feel a heat that could have been fire for all he cared slowly spreading across his body. Draco's pointed chin was digging uncomfortably against his own, and their noses, smashed together side by side, were fighting to breathe the same air. Harry, still tightly gripping Draco's right arm, tasted toothpaste and something that reminded him of firewhiskey, and he instantly felt intoxicated by the fact that he was tasting Draco. Draco Malfoy. His rival. His sworn enemy. He stumbled a bit into him, losing his footing for a moment, and Draco steadied him by winding his free hand into Harry's thick, wild black hair. He pulled gently, causing Harry's head to tilt back slightly and his mouth to open further, and Draco delved his tongue in deeper. Harry registered somewhere in his mind that he had just allowed himself to moan into Draco's mouth.
Draco looked over to him, meeting those beautiful green eyes. Harry's expression was both firm and soft, concerned and pleading and Draco willed himself not to cry as he nodded.
"I - I don't think it is," Harry very nearly whispered. Draco's soft crying continued a minute longer, his back turned to him.
He had always been told that muggles were practically less than human. He was told that any witch or wizard whose blood had been tainted by muggles made them far less superior. He was told that it was his duty as the sole male heir to uphold the Malfoy family name and it's centuries-long traditions. He had never been told
"I - Draco, I can't just -" he watched Draco turn away quickly, nearly leaping off his bed as Harry's heart sank further by the second. Draco grabbed his undershirt from the floor and practically ripped it down over his head, taking long, fast strides back to his closet where Harry knew he'd be retrieving the rest of his clothes. Harry, whose mind had been clouded with a hundred emotions, suddenly realized with a shock that both the vials and his wand were currently discarded with his cloak on the bathroom floor.
At least twenty minutes, a lot of panting, pushing and hand squeezing later, the sound of a baby crying had filled the room along with Ginny’s gasping from her efforts.
“Ohh,” she said, leaning into the table. Harry, who could feel his own drunkenness over-taking him, noticed how her heavy breasts pressed against the wood.
“So, you two fought a lot at school, then?” she asked him curiously, and Harry tore his eyes away from the blonde’s mouth.
"Touched a nerve, have I?" And there was that stupid smirk which Harry had the sudden urge to knock off Malfoy's face with his fist. He could feel the muscles in his right arm flex on their own accord.
That didn't go over so well. Ron ranted loud enough for the whole department to hear, ending with "I'll be damned if my sister sits at your beck and call!" and a fist slamming down on to the breakroom table. Ron had left before Harry could explain further, and when he arrived home to their shared flat later that night, Ron's things were gone.
Still in a post earth-shattering orgasmic stupor, he felt himself moving to sit on the tile floor in slow-motion. The water splashed around him a bit as his back hit the left side of the shower stall's wall, resting his forearms on bent knees that were red and oddly indented with the pattern of the tiled floor. The toes of his right foot were mere centimetres away from Harry's discarded wand, and he barely noticed that Harry was moving to sit across from him, the stream of the shower now cascading over their shins.
Even when he had tread into an awkward, unknown territory with Blaise two nights ago and Blaise - with his stupid guessing games and his
Harry pointed his wand at the open closet entrance door and waited. A moment later he was once again face to face with Draco Malfoy. If Draco had been embarrassed at all by their earlier encounter, his cool, sleek appearance certainly did not show it. Harry could feel the heat rising in his own cheeks, mentally cursing himself for not being able to appear the same as Draco.
"It's not the family motto," he said after a moment. "It's not any of the other Latin passphrases we use either." He took his hand away.
"Yeah." Harry huffed, giving him a defiant look that dared him to speak poorly of it. Draco, for once, was headed in a very different direction.
“’S alright, mate. Let it out.” he said, leaning over and speaking in what he thought was a whisper to Hermione. “I said I stopped at six – Harry made it to
"I came back to get some of my things," he said quietly. "I thought you were a muggle knocking on the door."
"Always," Draco repeated, and the word hit Harry hard, swallowing over an immense lump welled up in his throat yet again. He leaned forward, kissing Draco gently. There was no sexual tension this time, even when their lips parted and the tips of their tongues met. At some point Harry's mind registered that Draco was silently crying, and he climbed into the hot water behind him, wrapping his arms around his slim frame. "Love you, love you, love you," Draco whispered, his lips grazing Harry's shoulder as he spoke.
Keeping his mouth right where it was - with his tongue flicking the hardened nub and his eyes trained on the face above his - Draco reached forward and wrapped his long, pale fingers around Harry's cock.
"You've been at it for an entire hour now," Malfoy said smoothly, casually checking his watch. "We haven't even gotten to the best room in the house yet."
"Do you want my mouth, Potter?" he whispered against his ear, sending a shiver through the other man.
Draco still wouldn't meet his gaze. "Look, I - we - we shouldn't have -" Although it was the truth, it was the wrong thing to say. Draco shot up, staring him right in the face, eyes ablaze.
Harry could feel his jaw clenching, a heat rising to his face as he inhaled sharply, smelling stale closet air and a faint scent of expensive cologne.
He then delicately touched the top of it near his left shoulder, his middle and index fingers tracing the path down towards his right hip. This time he didn't hold back the sound he made.
Harry grimaced. "Because I'm in love with you." Draco's hands, which had been calmly resting against the sides of the enormous porcelain tub suddenly gripped the edges as if he were hanging on for dear life.
“Can we –” Harry gasped. “Can we – stop talking about it?” he asked weakly, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand as his head swam.
"My mouth," Draco repeated, pulling back enough to look Harry in the eyes. "Do you want me on my knees, Potter, with your cock in my mouth?"
suck Potter's cock down completely. He inhaled deeply and forced his throat to relax, moving forward until his nose was buried in wet curls and the hands in his hair tightened, holding him there.
? How’s life after Hogwarts?! Are you still with what's-his-name…?” she said, and her friend began to reply animatedly, pulling her away.
Draco didn't bother to change into his flying gear as he quickly grabbed his broom from the Slytherin changing room. He wanted the most time to fly he could get before Hooch or Filch showed up and started hollering about curfew, house points, detentions and other completely pointless nonsense...
There came a low ‘oooh’ from the crowd around them that had formed earlier, gaining interest as the two men drunkenly challenged each other.
With Harry intently watching him, Draco spit over his prick before he began to take it all back down his throat again at a maddeningly slow pace.
Draco didn't know how he hadn't just come from that sound alone as pleasure jolted through his gut. He had never imagined the real Harry, saint that he
. And while the answer to Harry's rhetorical question was mostly yes, The Dark Lord had nothing much to do with his tears this time.
Draco's heart climbed into his throat. This couldn't be happening. This had to be some sort of crazy, karmic punishment for wiping Blaise's memory after he had just admitted to him
“I wish I had some sobering potions to give you but I didn’t even think of it when Mum firecalled,” she said. “I just apparated straight to the bar –” They resumed walking, Harry struggling to keep a straight path.
"How revoltingly Gryffindor of you." Harry glared at Malfoy and quickly brushed past him as he walked into the previously hidden room. As his eyes adjusted, they landed on the source of the faint blue light, confirming what Harry already knew.
"Severus." Draco said quietly. Both sets of eyes, green and black, looked at him in surprise. "I can't do it anymore."
In response, Draco crashed his lips down to Harry's in another intense kiss, grinding their hips together again. Harry was frantically pulling him closer and it took Draco a great amount of effort to stop that intoxicating blissfulness.
Severus understood the very same pain he had been hiding himself since childhood. The weight of reality struck him hard, realization tearing him to pieces.
"I didn't get the dittany fast enough on my chest, Potter," he whispered quickly, opening up the rest of his shirt to reveal the long, thin scar that curved across his torso, still pink and healing.
!” Ron smiled, tearing up. “Man – my nephew with m’ best mate’s weirdly green eyes –” he said, getting choked up about it.
“Better go see what the Weasel wants, Potter.” he breathed, reaching for his cigarettes again. Harry felt his heart leap into his throat.
“Oh! Oh, it’s alright, dear,” she laughed, and Harry gave her a weak smile, reaching for her hand. “I know how those birthdays get on. I – ooh – I, ow – went to them quite a bit with you when I wasn’t knocked up.”
," Harry grit out, his right arm flexing again, and Draco had to bite back the desperate sound that tried to escape him.
Just as he predicted. Potter's consent truly was an unrealistic fantasy. He was thankful enough at least that Potter hadn't
"No," Draco said, sniffing and pulling away. "You have your own burdens to bear, Severus... And I have mine."
Malfoy's racing heart tripped, skipping several beats and he pressed his hands flat against the tile on either side of Harry's head.
"Say it out loud, then." Draco said, wanting to be absolutely sure he wasn't imagining it. "Tell me what you want, Harry.
"Of course." he muttered. Of course she would send them here. Harry was certainly disobeying protocol by showing up alone but seeing as Ron was probably more dangerous to him right now than an empty mansion would be, he decided against following orders. He tried the handle with no luck. He was raising his wand when the unmistakable sound of a door being unlocked made him freeze in place, wand at the ready. The door began to open. No matter what he was expecting, it certainly was not the appearance of Draco Malfoy himself.
"They sent you here, a presumably empty household, with a search and seizure warrant, did they not, Auror Potter? Pity. It looks to me that the only thing you've successfully managed to seize was my arse. Do they award badges for debauchery?"
Draco looked as though Harry had slapped him, which Harry concluded was better than any hex could have ever been. It was not often one made Draco Malfoy lose his perfect composure.
"Love you?" he finished for him. "Yeah, it's not just lust, Draco. I'm sure of that, though I'm not really sure when it happened. Maybe when you didn't give me, Ron and Hermione up to Voldemort? Or maybe it was during 6th year. Or before 4th year, in the woods at the Cup, when you were really just warning us to get out of there. Maybe it was even on the train, Draco, when you offered friendship to me before anyone else."
A thin, shiny, scar curved across his chest down to his flat abdomen, like someone had swung a sword upwards and slashed him open. Like Harry had swung a sword and slashed him open. It pained him to see the evidence of his own stupidity. He touched his fingers to the top of it near Draco's shoulder, tracing its diagonal path down. Draco's breathing hitched.
he has your eyes! Ron, look –” Ron went over to stand behind Hermione, hands on her shoulders, peering over her left one.
," Harry whined, clutching at his back and pressing his cock forward. Draco grabbed hold of Harry's biceps hard to keep himself from coming in his pants, his own answering moan only a hum through lips still closed around the soft flesh of Harry's earlobe.
Harry held his second child, his second son, for the first time, pride, joy and an immense amount of love wiping away everything else he might have been feeling in that very moment.
Their cocks brushed lightly together, both still hard and leaking with need, and Draco moaned into Harry's mouth. Harry laid his palm flat against Draco's chest, aggravated by the fabric he found there, and reached down to grab the bottom hem. "Don't," Draco gasped, quickly pulling away and grabbing Harry's hand.
When he was still uncertain, Snape bore his eyes into Draco's, and Draco suddenly felt the near-permanent impenetrable fortress around Snape's mind break away.
Whatever Draco had been expecting - it wasn't that. He remembered Blaise suggesting Harry's weakness - telling him how easy it would be to guilt trip Potter into sex as payment for slashing him to near death.
A nearby clock showed him it was 9:13pm. He had just enough time to make it down to the Quidditch pitch and fly for a bit. With the final game on tomorrow and nearly everyone most likely to currently be in Hogsmeade, he was sure it would be empty.
The dreaded idea of Ginny possibly returning to Dean after the match - whether from celebration or consolation - kept constantly plaguing him, repeatedly turning his stomach over. Unlike the nature of his private meetings with Dumbledore, this was a problem he felt he had no one to confide in about. It was too complicated - and admittedly terrifying - to simply sit Ron down and say,
That was far too ridiculous. He needed to leave. He needed to gather his soggy, sweaty clothes and high-tail it the fuck out of there. He bent down and snatched his tie up from the floor when a muffled, desperate sound reached him, going straight to his cock. Biting his lip, he slung his tie around his neck and began reaching for his vest when a dangerous thought struck him.
he was going to hit the brick face first except that Malfoy had moved to catch him and Harry was so surprised in his stupor by it that he didn’t move out of Malfoy’s arms.
"Draco, what are you-" she stopped cold, eyes meeting Harry Potter's flushed face instead of her son's. He saw her only as a blur until he wordlessly summoned his glasses and jammed them back on his face.
Everything in Harry's life had always happened so suddenly. Suddenly he was a wizard. Suddenly he was famous. Suddenly he had friends. Suddenly he was defeating a basilisk and he had an innocent godfather. Suddenly Cedric was dead and Voldemort was alive. Suddenly Sirius was dead too, suddenly there were horcruxes and suddenly Harry was one of them. But none of it had all been really sudden, had it? He had been a wizard all his life and famous since before he could remember. His friendships had been built through trials and tribulations. The opening of the Chamber of Secrets had been planned, Sirius had always been his reckless, innocent Godfather, and Voldemort would have ordered anyone who had wound up in that graveyard to be murdered regardless. Even his return had not happened suddenly. It was always going to happen as long as he had his horcruxes. As long as Harry had been one of them, as long as Dumbledore had known.
"Privileged twat," he mumbled. He then turned to the bookshelves, reaching up on his tip-toes to tap his wand along the spines that sat on the topmost shelf. He was muttering revealing spells under his breath, trying to utilize everything he had been taught in his recently completed Auror training. He was somewhere on the third shelf, tapping away when one of the books began to emit a soft, red glow. Harry stopped and moved back towards it, cautiously bringing his face close enough to read the spine: Secrets of the Darkest Art. Harry carefully removed the book from its place and the faint red glow disappeared. The book had been banned quite some time ago and was illegal to personally own. He opened it, needing to make sure that had been the only reason the book was revealed to him. Certain pages had been bookmarked - terrible jinxes, hexes, and other things of the sort. Harry tried to mentally note each one but forgot them all immediately when he saw the last bookmarked entry: horcruxes.
Not wasting another moment, Draco gave Harry what they both wanted. He wrapped his lips around the head of Harry's cock, his groan drowned out by the near-scream Harry made.
Harry, who had already been flushed from his face down to the top of his chest, turned practically the same shade of scarlet as one-half of Gryffindor's house colours.
Draco nodded and thought better to ask which from the tone of The Baron's eerie voice, though he desperately hoped that that half-headless Gryffindor piss-cloud wasn't one of them.
Harry brought his hands up to rest on Draco's biceps as the blonde man panted, leaning over to press his cheek into Harry's shoulder. A moment later Draco removed his fingers and held out his hand towards an out of reach bedside table drawer. The handle rattled slightly and stopped. Draco huffed loudly in frustration.
“’M off duty. And so’s my partners – it’s one of their birthdays –” Harry couldn’t even remember whose now. “And ‘m drunk as fuck, so right now I don’t really give a shit.”
“Ah, he prolly just feels bad we’re smashed –” Ron said, leaning over and giving his sister a kiss on the forehead.
He felt so heavy - weighted down by life's pressures. He pushed his glasses back on, staring out of the Gryffindor Tower window. The pressure pushed into him from all angles, firmly rooting him to the ground - making him decide that maybe the ground was exactly what he needed to get away from.
“Not exactly, love,” he said, and Harry suspected Malfoy wasn’t as immune to the effects of alcohol as he had claimed to be earlier that evening.
Wordless, wandless magic was near impossible, even for something as simple as a summoning charm. Harry was impressed the drawer had even reacted at all, until he felt the bed shift under him as Draco removed himself from Harry, and Harry cursed the damn drawer and everything inside it for not obeying Draco. He watched as Draco quickly got close enough to wrench it open, dig inside for a second and return with a small vial. Breathing deeply, he uncorked it and poured a small amount of clear liquid into his right palm.
, forcing his hips forward so that Draco was now fiercely grinding against him, making Harry grunt and moan into his mouth. The repeated pressure of Draco's hard cock pressing against his own felt absolutely
Malfoy smirked, and to show just how serious he was, he picked up the first shot and knocked it back without so much as a blink of an eye.
Malfoy’s gray eyes, dark from lust and glazed from alcohol caught the look of horror on Harry’s face, realization dawning on the blonde with his trademark, almost permanent smirk.
"Malfoy,” Harry said cautiously, “tell the wall your father is dead." Draco's left eyebrow quirked with curiosity while the rest of his face still expressed disdain.
Harry looked back up at him, something nervous in his expression. Panic gripped at Draco, twisting his insides into knots. They had both crossed so many lines already; surely Harry knew there was no point in stopping now - not when they were mere feet from the finish. Worrying that Harry might really change his mind if any more time elapsed, he gripped Harry's hips for leverage and immediately sank to his knees.
"For fuck’s sake," he whispered, both of their heads bowed as Draco tried to free the fabric. Harry laughed, the material came loose and Draco quickly removed it, a small smile on his own lips. He inhaled sharply as he laid eyes on Harry's shirtless torso. He was lightly tanned and muscular, although not in a bulky way. A light trail of dark hair began beneath his belly button, getting thicker the further down it went. Draco needed to touch him.
"Genuinely want an answer," he finished for him. Harry was looking at him more carefully now and he knew his own pale cheeks were flushed. There was no way Harry would miss the unmistakable tent he was pitching.
He abruptly stopped himself, gripping his chains that began to rattle ominously and let out an unearthly groan.
"Erm, ah- Auror Potter. I, er, have a search and seizure grant issued by the Minister of Magic. If you resist allowing me onto the premises, I, ah, I will have to use force."
"It's just the stupid wall with a paint chip, Po..." Malfoy trailed off, realizing that if, in fact, it had only been just a stupid wall, then they would be currently surrounded in its rubble. "My father would have told me," Draco said quietly, not entirely sure if he believed himself. He stepped forward slowly and covered his palm over the spot, muttering what sounded like complicated nonsense to Harry.
"He was my best friend! My best, Potter, my best! And he was taken from me! The only true friend I ever had, the only friend who ever actually cared - taken from me!" He was panting. Harry wanted to put a hand on his shoulder to calm him down but feared it would only worsen things.
He let Harry's cock fall out of his grip, grazing his fingertips over the reddened, fleshy crown and was rewarded with a keening, high pitched whine. Pulling away all together, his lips found Potter's again while his hands were flying to undo his belt, his shaking fingers slipping over the wet leather and pure silver buckle.
"My seventh -" he stopped. Harry looked up from the vials to Malfoy, who's expression was once again perfectly unreadable.
Perhaps if his entire life hadn't already been planned for him at birth and he didn't have to follow in his Father's footsteps to retain the family glory and status and all of that other crap...  he could have been one hell of an Obliviator for the Ministry.
This was unlike any of the other few Invisibility Cloaks he had ever held. It strangely felt like air and he couldn't help bringing it up to his eyes. The most expensive of Cloaks, which Draco had always assumed Harry's was, were intricately woven from Demiguise hair.
His stomach churned. Why was it marked? Who had marked it? Inhaling deeply to calm himself, Harry magically confiscated the book. He would have to interrogate Draco about that at some point. When he found nothing else on the shelves, he examined the rest of the room. Dressers, tables, chairs, the four-poster, an ornate mirror, and even a throw rug were all inspected to be perfectly normal. Harry, who had knelt on the floor to examine the rug, stood up and made his way to the door in the far-right corner. Opening it slowly, he found himself walking into a closet only half the size of the previous one and desperately hoped there would not be another suspicious spot of chipped paint. He quickly noticed another door directly to his right. He leaned over and grabbed the silver handle to open it, but it was locked.
necessary, of course - my further genealogical studies were purely out of curiosity, which is a rather long-winded way of telling you how I know that you're related to the Peverells. It all makes perfect sense."
“Make that ten to seven, love,” he told her, and in the next two seconds, knocked back his remaining two shots, one after the other.
“What can I say? Some of us are just better than others…” he said, his voice silky, knowing that Harry was still watching him and listening. He brought his left hand up, smoothing his blonde hair back, and Harry saw the silver band on his ring finger glint in the low light of the bar.
"Dr-" he started to apologize, but the wind was knocked from him as Draco somehow flipped their positions at lightning speed. He straddled Harry's hips, his hands pinning his arms down on either side of his head.
