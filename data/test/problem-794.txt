‘Except they already do,’ says Harry, and he looks at Minerva with an unusually guarded expression. ‘Don’t they?’
. Harry knows that Malfoy is a death eater and still,
A small measure of satisfaction eases away at some of the irritation at the thought of that
He chuckles darkly, though it’s not the same as usual. She pauses mid hunt. Now that she’s noticed it, there is definitely something wrong about his smell this morning.
Ron scowls. ‘Alright then, how do
As he suspects, she rolls her eyes and gives him a real answer. ‘Ten galleons…and your mother’s rune book. One day, no questions.’
He steps up to the boundary around the ice-rink, leaning over to peer at the smooth ice stretched out before them. He wrinkles his nose.
‘Ginny tells me that you and Draco helped get Harry out of the fire,’ says Luna, looking up from her card game to fix Ron with a wide-eyed stare. ‘Are you two getting on better now?’
Every year Narcissa spends weeks preparing for Christmas, ensuring that every minute detail, every decoration, every event is planned to utter perfection; and every year she is rewarded with the praise and envy of her guests and friends. Most of all, she is rewarded with the happiness of her one and only son.
, Harry. Of course not.’
‘I was surprised you’re not at your usual table?’ Luna says to him, moving out of the way as he leans up to look at the shelves above her.
‘Sorry?’
‘Nope.’
‘Well…’
‘Bloody hell, really?’
When he finally stops running, he’s at the astronomy tower. He supposes he shouldn’t be surprised. Years of Harry Hunting have conditioned him to seek out the highest possible point to hide. Probably why he enjoys flying so much.
Smooth and swift, Theo magic’s some of his and Daphne’s potion straight into Blaise’s cauldron. Daphne—studiously perusing her notes—doesn’t seem to notice. Neither does Slughorn.
Somehow, Hermione resists the urge to groan. She gives Harry an exasperated look, hoping he realises that Ron is just being...well,
Instead, she watches him, as the meal progresses. How he barely touches his food, picking at it without any enthusiasm. How he stares at the fire, completely unseeing, lost in some thought or other that—for the first time

Poppy’s jaw clenches. With a sigh sigh, she turns to face Albus, her tone arch as she explains, ‘once the magic has built up, it needs an outlet. Either we control how he releases it,’ she gestures at the wall, ‘or it controls him. Usually resulting in the destruction of school property and the endangerment of himself and others. Currently, this is the safest solution of everyone involved. But by all means, if

‘Why would I need a picture when I
Malfoy’s brows furrowed in concentration and he chewed on his bottom lip as he fought to free himself and capture Harry in return. It was a tic of his. Something Harry had noticed now that they were sharing a room together.
‘You have some serious issues, you know that?’
Draco groans, relishing the sound of his own name on Harry’s lips. He leans forward again, pressing into Harry, only for them to overbalance.
There’s another pause, and Draco has to strain his ears to hear the answer and when he does he’s not quite sure what to do with the it.
‘Hm? Oh,’ says Draco, and swings his bag up over his shoulder, and trudges after the Golden Trio.
‘Hey Colin,’ he mutters, shooting Colin a distracted smile before turning an appraising look on Ginny.
It goes through. She smirks, sending Zabini a return wink. He shakes his head, but offers her an impressed smile. The score lights up 80-40 to Gryffindor. The crowds are cheering—most of the stands in favour of Gryffindor—and somewhere above her she hears Harry’s familiar whoop of delight.
Harry is silent a moment, staring at him. ‘I wasn’t alone.’
‘But…those scars…’
‘Maybe
She busies herself making sandwiches, waiting patiently for Harry to compose himself. She knows from previous experience that when it comes to teenage boys, it is always best to let them come to you.
This time Theo looks back, and there’s a smidge of amusement lurking in the depths of his usually bland expression. He glances at the ruined potion, bubbling a furious indigo instead of the soft simmering orange it’s supposed to be, and gestures to his own potion.
Adrenaline fading, Harry sighed, looking up at the rollercoaster wistfully.
He waves his hand, and a moment later, a small blanket spreads out across the frosty grass. He drops down and looks up at Harry expectantly. Bemused, but curious, Harry drops down onto the blanket beside him.
Despite the surrealness of the last ten minutes, Neville finds himself smiling. ‘Thanks, Harry. I am.’
Blue narrows her gaze at him. He is tense and now that she’s identified the smell around the Speaker, she realises the same musky sadness is lingering around him, too.
‘Yes,’ says Theo. ‘I know what it was. And what you were supposed to do with it. What you
In a moment, the boxes are transfigured into a stout, square, wooden table. She frowns, eyeing the table and glancing around the room again. She sighs, finding nothing else to transfigure, and digs around in her bag.
‘We got it handled here,’ he says, and nods after echoing sounds of explosions.
‘Yes.’
Ron nods. He frowns at her, pulls out his wand and contours a thick blanket, wrapping her up in it.
‘What happened?’ she asks, and flicks her wand at two beds and summons both boy’s files.
‘Yeah, we see that,’ says Ron. ‘With who? Wasn’t Malfoy was it? Hope you gave the git as good as you got.’
‘Have you ever noticed,’ Luna asks Ginny (one of the few friends she can speak to about any topic without fear of judgement), ‘how uncomfortable Harry gets when he’s approached by people?’
He, Harry Potter, Gryffindor extraordinaire, has just laid one on Draco Too-Good-For-Everyone Sodding Malfoy. Which begs the question of

the seeker, aren’t you? And the rest of us don’t need the snitch to get started. Besides, aren’t you and Potter good ol’ pals now?’
Draco’s mental defence is at least good enough for him to notice Severus’ presence, but the flimsy defence he puts up is pathetic and crumbles easily under Severus’ will.
Hermione nudges him. ‘Come on,’ she says. ‘Let’s go find Harry.’
‘Sorry I’m late class, I had to pick up some new material for next weeks class project. Alright, time for our individual presentations. Everyone got their projects ready? Oh, yes all on the table. Well done. Well, first up to present will be, let’s see…how about Miss Bones, with her Muggle flip-phone.’
closest to Madam Pomfrey’s rooms. Pomfrey had him asleep by the time they arrived. They still don’t know what happened, but for now he lays quietly, but for the soft hush of his breathing and the occasional indistinguishable mumble.
‘I can’t see. I…my glasses broke when I fell and I just...Never mind it doesn’t matter. Just…just get someone up here quickly, would you?’
‘I see.’
! And because I
‘I see.’
‘Yes of course—but Harry, there in the thick of it all? So many sensational stories. In fact, I heard that you took on Bellatrix herself—’
‘No,’ says Minerva, and rolls her eyes. ‘But he won’t. Not until he feels he has to intervene.’
‘Ye-es. For your silence.’
Instead, she focuses on Malfoy. He’s frowning at Madam Pomfrey, but at a pointed look from her he turns back to Harry and, without meaning to, Hermione catches his gaze. Worry lurks there and she knows that he sees it too.
Draco scowls, his fists clenching.
‘Ow,’ says Harry, his voice muffled by Draco’s shirt.
Draco glances up from his eclair and blinks. Taking a deep breath—as if preparing for battle—Draco pushes up from the couch and approaches the presents.
‘Ron, Ron for fucks sake let go of me,’ Ginny says in exasperation.
He sounds so bitter, so confused and upset that Ginny just wants to hug him, but she knows he’d just pull away if she tried and she doesn’t want to upset him any further.
‘Let me rephrase,’ she says, cutting him off with a wave of her hand. ‘Draco does not

It’s the last class of the last day before they’re all due to head home for Christmas. Lavender Brown—who he has yet to escape from in McGonagall’s new seating regime—is chatting fervently to one of the Patil sisters. Theo can’t tell which, and he doesn’t care. While no one is looking, he slips the brightly coloured package from his bag to hers, and then he waits.
‘…thanks. And I’m sor—ah
Harry grimaces. ‘Few days ago,’ he mumbles. ‘I ran into him…well it doesn’t matter where. But he pretty much told me it wasn’t going to happen. That we should just pretend I hadn’t kissed him.’
Draco frowns. Something squirms in his gut and his heart starts to thump painfully in his chest. He turns away, not wanting Potter to see him so unnerved, and leaves Potter and his stupid knowing gaze behind in the bathroom. Still, he can’t escape it. Potter’s words
she’s worried about him. She grits her teeth and hisses at him, ’Lost for
Potter takes a step forward, reaching out to slip a hand around Malfoy’s wrist. ‘I don’t want to give up,’ he says.
With a little shake, Luna breaks herself out of her thoughts and steps to one side, smile widening as Harry passes right by her without even seeing her.
‘Not even Ron or Hermione?’
‘I do,’ says Draco imperiously. ‘Now get over here. Are you a Gryffindor or not?’
Dean can’t listen to anymore. He grabs the door handle and barges into the room, cutting off any further conversation between the two.
She takes the chart out of mid-air. ‘And what happened to your big plan of returning for Mr Weasley’s birthday? Or have you decided that’s not as important as wallowing in self-pity?’
‘Scared, Potter?’
Ginny laughs. ‘What do you mean why?’ she asks. ‘I would’ve thought it was obvious.’
Nott treads pointedly on Zabini’s foot. Zabini winces, glaring at his friend, but cutting off. Hermione raises her eyebrows. Interesting.
She sighs and shuts off the mirror with a wave of her wand. There was no harm in letting the boy be happy another day. After all, if she’s right, he’s got a long struggle ahead of him.
Despite himself, Harry chuckles. ‘Alright. Hold your horses.’

nod. ‘But I’m paying this time.’
‘I mean you probably could be,’ she says. ‘If you wanted to.’
A slow grin spread across Harry’s face. ‘You wish,’ he said. ‘What will we do to him?’
Harry blinks several times, but doesn’t move. Doesn’t step away. Doesn’t put the space back between them. Ron’s mind is trying furiously to show him what’s happening, to connect the dots, but he shakes his head, shying away from the situation. Harry wouldn’t. He
In the sudden quiet, an unpleasant churning fills Ron’s stomach.
She watches them out of the corner of her eye from three seats over, simultaneously stuffing her face with a double helping of hot chips and a cottage pie, and unashamedly eavesdropping on the two boys across from her.
Horace Slughorn, Ginny decides, is nothing but a snivelling sycophant. She leans against the wall behind the man, her nose wrinkled as she watches him gush over the boys in the compartment, one by one. Of course, she’s the only girl; and only because he happened to be walking by when she hexed that arrogant prat Zacharius Smith.
Tension rolls through Draco in waves and he paces back and forth along side the magic crib. He runs a hand through his already dishevelled hair and Harry’s gaze fixates on the motion. Suddenly all Harry can think about is running

There’s a tension that hangs between them that is
to keep going. I just…don’t know how.’
Malfoy’s gaze flicks back and forth between Minerva and Poppy, wary and still mortified. ‘For a moment,’ he says eventually.
‘We should find our rooms and get settled,’ said Hermione, gesturing upwards. Harry sighed and resigned himself to unpacking, looking back longingly at the chairs.
He stares up at the canopy of his bed, ignoring the rustling movements of his housemates getting ready for the school day. Theo knows he should join them. If he stays in bed any longer he will miss breakfast and if he missed breakfast again he’d have to put up with Blaise and his stupid knowing looks and Daphne’s thinly veiled questions of concern.
Harry flushes. ‘Devour me?’
Albus meets her gaze with steady reassurance, but the urge to go one step further, to sink within her thoughts and discover the

Being on the seventh floor, McGonagall’s office is closest, but Ginny doesn’t even make it there before she all but runs into her.
. It’s an important distinction.’
The wolf reappears, sagging back on it’s haunches, it’s head raised in a mournful cry that cuts off with a whine. He ducks his head, curling up and burying his nose deep within his fur.
‘Er, yes,’ squeaks Colin.
Lisa rolls her eyes. She glances at Earnie and says, ‘I hope they get kicked out.’
He takes the photos, grateful for the distraction—not that he’ll tell Ginny that.
He forces a return laugh that dies almost as soon as it starts, and Tonks worries that she’s pushed it too far.
She flicks her wand at the mugs and sandwiches, spelling them towards the table.
‘What if I can get you in the mood,’ offers Harry with a shy smile.
With that, Minerva spun on her heel and stalked out, leaving the two boy’s sitting dumbfounded. Without sparing his students a second look, Severus follows her out—no doubt to try and change her mind about this unusual punishment.
‘Like tigers hunting,’ says Luna, before her gaze falls on another potions book. ‘Or an Erumpent in mating season.’
‘Well, what about this one?’
‘The item I chose,’ she says, and is relieved that her voice isn’t as shaky as she feels, ‘is a Muggle Camera. Even though it looks really different, they work pretty much the same way ours do, except this one prints the photo out as well. I think. I didn’t actually manage to get it to work. Um, anyway, that’s uh, mostly it. Does anyone have any questions?’
‘I didn’t think you’d decided which one was the wizarding novel yet,’ says Blaise, smirking.
Lisa leans up slightly in her chair, trying to catch a glimpse of the title of the book. ‘Me too,’ she says distractedly, tilting her head to read the words, wondering desperately who “Matilda” was and why she needed a whole book?
‘I’m saying, enjoy it while it lasts,’ she says. ’No teenage romance lasts forever.’
‘That sounds like the dumbest thing ever,’ says Ron, rolling his eyes at his sister. ‘Why would she want to make dumb bracelets with you, when she can come upstairs with me and have cake and chocolate.’ He turns to Romilda expectantly, his gaze heavy and warm, and beams at her.
Fingers slide through Draco’s hair again. Harry tastes like coffee and strawberry jam and Draco sighs, feeling the tension of the day ease away under Harry’s attentions.
‘Guess we won’t see you at the Malfoy’s Christmas dinner after all, eh?’ says Vince nervously in the awkward silence that follows.
‘Alright, maybe I kissed you,’ Potter says, ‘but
Harry blinks. ‘I’m afraid if I answer, you’ll hit me,’ he stares out at the rain, a contemplative frown on his face. ‘I suppose I could sell Grimmauld Place and get a flat or something.’
‘Go see what it is, would you?’ asks Harry imploringly.
‘I thought he was one of
‘That wasn’t—ugh. Look, I get it, okay? You don’t want to be with someone who’s probably going to die. That’s a sucky position to be in and I understand. You could’ve just said that in the first place instead of going on about how we don’t work together.’
‘I—’ Colin cuts off, watching with mounting dread as Malfoy flicks through the photos.
He’s bloody cold damnit, and if they don’t start moving soon he’s going to freeze over. Besides, Potter’s stupid antics in the air have irritated him. Surely Pomfrey hasn’t approved him for flying yet? Three days ago the stupid sod could barely stand up let alone operate a broom in mid-air.
Tonks shrugs. ‘That’s okay. I’ll tag along anyway. And I’ll take that ice-cream.’
‘Confusing,’ says Harry, sinking into the couch with a sigh. ‘And exhausting.’
Draco’s gaze narrows in concern but Blaise snickers.
‘I think they already have, Pans,’ he says, smiling at her. ‘You should finish up.’
‘Yeah, only I didn’t realise it was speaking another language.’
‘Yes,’ says Harry in a tight voice. He shakes his head. ‘No. I…I don’t…’

He sits back, staring at the pages of his book but not reading the words, instead thinking of Harry. Of Harry taking Draco’s advice. Harry thinking of
let me go.’
Harry sighs and fidgets with his shirt for the thousandth time. It’s a nice shirt, green like his eyes. Ginny remembers her mother making him try it, and a slew of others, on when he finally outgrew his second hand clothes from his cousin.
Remus looks up from his hands. ‘Forest is quiet. No news from Hagrid or the Centaurs.’
Earnie nods seriously.
‘No way.’
The third time happens slowly.
Behind him, he could practically feel Malfoy’s smirk boring into the back of his head.
Which, of course, she does almost instantly.
Malfoy tilts his head back again. He grins and looks back up at the ceiling, continuing to twirl the wand. ‘Pass.’
He breathes in. He breathes out. He waits for Malfoy’s response. Tries to pretend that his chest doesn’t hurt with the simple effort of
Poppy glances away pursing her lips. ‘He hasn’t said anything to you?’
'They're always...touching.'

Theo just stares at him, dread sending his stomach into a freefall. Vince is right. He
He ignores her, brushing her hands away as he glances blearily around the room ‘Harry,’ he mutters. ‘Where…is he okay?’
Narcissa raises her eyebrows, bemused by the unusual note. Draco just stares at it, stunned disbelief written all over his face.
Malfoy stops, lifting the next photo from the pile and staring at it. Colin’s heart just about stops. He knows, he
He thinks about that for a moment.
A flicker of doubt flashed across Draco’s face, but it was gone, pulled back under a calm assurance that Harry envied. ‘Scared, Potter?’
girlfriend. Not when the whole school thinks they’re together.’
‘What kind of spellwork do you call
‘I ask myself that all the time,’ says Potter with a wry smile.
She watches Malfoy lean over to select a sugar mouse from the proffered box Professor McGonagall is handing out, how he leans into Harry as he reaches, and wishes she had someone to comfort her that way.
Harry laughs. ‘Alright,’ he says, and runs a hand through his hair. ‘Actually, it’d be nice to have someone to talk to about it. I feel like I’ve been loosing my mind.’
This is untrue. Hermione knows this is untrue because she had to walk around their make out session this morning to get out of the common room.
Draco sighs and glances back at him. ‘Potter, if we’re going to survive tonight, can we just assume that whenever I suggest something that, yes, I mean
Remus ignores the dig. ‘How do you know this? Did he…did he say something to you?’
Draco snorts. ‘I think possibly you’ve mentioned that once or twice before.’
There was a beat of silence and then, ‘Scared, Potter?’
‘Here,’ says Draco, cutting him off and thrusting a pair of thin frames at Potter.
Blue is distracted by the vibrant red of her hair, and so doesn’t see Him at first. Then the girl shifts, glancing over her shoulder at Him, and Blue raises her head, alert.
‘It means his perspective has changed,’ says Dora, still frowning across the bar. ‘He was definitely Dumbledore’s man before. Something has changed. Or some
There’s a faint glow to the night air, as if a flock of fairies have come streaming through the corridors lacing the air with hopes and dreams and babies laughter. There’s no hint of wrackspurts, and Luna wonders if her charms are starting to work, or if something else has chased them off. Something like the glowing beauty of a storming night.
‘And that gives you the right to touch me without my permission?’
Malfoy frowns. ‘What the hell is a horse whisperer?’
Two seconds later Harry and Malfoy’s cauldron explodes.
Potter’s shoulders are tense, as if he can sense Draco’s thoughts. Draco grits his teeth and turns away, reminding himself furiously that he’s
‘Fuck,’ Draco gasped.
He stares at her, arms still crossed, leg jigging restlessly as he leans agains the doorframe and considers her conditions. ‘Fine,’ he says.
‘A bit yeah,’ says Harry, and for the first time ever, he doesn’t look away. Doesn’t even blush.
He turns on his heel, cloak billowing out behind him. Ron shuffles over to Harry’s side and watches the man go.
Uncertainty flashes across his face. He runs a hand through his hair, his gaze darting around the compartment before fixing back on Hermione’s face.
‘It’s not really as exciting as I thought it’d be,’ says Potter, looking around again.
‘She does?’
Somehow, the fight seems rather insignificant in the face of Harry’s confession.
Draco tilts his head, eyeing Blaise appraisingly. ‘And yet you seem so interested in everyone else’s.’ Draco rolls his eyes, scoffing. ‘Hypocrite.’
‘I’ll do all my homework before we go,’ he says quickly, cutting her off. ‘For all my classes. Even the stuff that’s not due yet. And I’ll pull extra detention. And clean the Infirmary.
Not to mention the fact that she was now certain it involved Malfoy.
‘Wait, back up,’ she says, shaking her head. ‘When did he say this?’
‘Oh,’ he says, and grins. ‘You’ve been
Pansy pushes into the Slytherin dorms, various forms of teasing wit on the tip of her tongue, only to find it completely void of the subject of her amusement. She pouts.
‘Oh no,’ mutters the Girl glancing back and forth between Blue’s humans.
that happened. I’m given to understand, from all the shouting just now—’ here he levels a glare at both Harry and Mr Nott, an impressive feat given that they are standing at opposite ends of the room, ‘—that there was an altercation? Would anyone care to elaborate?’
‘Because it’s inconvenient,’ says Malfoy. ‘It took me two weeks to figure out the correct Runes to make this work and that was with Potter’s knowledge of how to make it work. It’s not a one fix solution. Every device needs a specific combination to allow it to function correctly.’
‘I didn’t realise asking a simple question constituted as an ambush these days.’
He adds this last part in a soft, embarrassed tone, and Hermione freezes, stunned by the realisation that Harry is talking about a boy. A boy he

Harry shrugs. ‘I dunno. Something about the movement of it,’ he says. ‘The flying is better.’
‘Well, he definitely didn’t need another book,’ she says.
Theo throws him a disgusted look.
‘Pretty much,’ she shrugs. ‘Besides, it’s my job to notice these things.’
‘Well,’ says Lavender. ‘It

‘Well it’s just that I, I really…oh hell.’
Potter nods.
His eyes sting and once again he sees the flash of flames. He opens his eyes. ‘I don’t even know what happened…I don’t…’
His shoulders turn inwards. ‘No,’ he mumbles.
‘Yeah. There was some sort of attack. He almost
He yanks his traitorous wand out of his sleeve and tries to think of a spell to put the damn fire out. He’s still struggling to believe that he set the fire. So far his wandless work hasn’t been anything to write home about. And he hadn’t even been
Draco blinks, staring at the box in mute surprise. He turns it over and the confusion gives way to a smile. It’s slow, at first, but as his gaze lingers over the box, it grows into a laugh.
Draco grins and withdraws his wand. ‘Are you a wizard or aren’t you?’ he says, twirling his wand in his hand. ‘C’mon Potter. Live a little for once. I can conjure you skates if you don’t know the spell. I used to do this all the time back home.’
Potter chews on the inside of his mouth and Poppy gets the distinct impression that he had expected this answer. That this was not the real question on his mind.

‘—lucky to be alive. It might take days for Potter to even wake—’
All three members of his staff look at him with narrowed mistrust and Albus cannot help how three very different temperaments align together when called for. Amusement tickles at him, but he keeps his expression in check.
one with friends you’re worried about. I have to go.’
‘You could go on your own?’

feels like it. ‘You don’t actually like me, do you?’
That is, until he’d had the gall to go and save Draco’s miserable life.
She steps out into the hallway beyond the common room and almost instantly feels worse. She shudders, rubbing her arms in the tepid air. She starts walking with every intention of heading for the grounds, desperate to get out in the fresh air, to kick her shoes off and bury her toes in the squishy, lush grass of the grounds, to spread her arms, throw her head back and soak in the warmth of the afternoon sun.
. I was talking to a seventh year and there was blood
!’ she says in delight. ‘Who?’
Potter shrugs, still gazing across the room. ‘I have nightmares too. All the time. And I get it. Being around me is dangerous. I…I wouldn’t want you to get hurt because of me.’
‘Fuck!’ Harry yells, turning and tossing the bat away across the field.
Ignoring the raised eyebrows from both the Gryffindors and no doubt his own housemates he slides into the seat opposite Potter with a genial smile.
‘But now he’s kissed you,’ she says, summarising. ‘And you’re understandably confused. Did he say anything?’
‘I…’ he swallows, starting again, and Hermione wonders what on Earth could be so bad that he’s this nervous. ‘Look, I…I didn’t say anything before because I was kind of embarrassed and by some miracle Malfoy didn’t go shoot off his mouth the minute it happened but…I kind of…lost it…’
‘Harry, dear, you’re talking to the woman who raised a dragon tamer, a curse breaker, and the creators of Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes,’ she says with a smile. ‘Draco Malfoy is not as troublesome as he thinks he is.’
‘Yeah and word is he heard about that poll going around about Slughorn being the better potions teacher so you just
Though, thinking now on the young Malfoy’s disdain for tea and apparent love of the—in Molly’s opinion—overly caffeinated drink, she wonders if Harry’s taste for it isn’t entirely his own.
Ginny sits down next to him. ‘Why don’t you tell me what happened?’
Malfoy looks back down, his expression cool and annoyed. ‘I thought Gryffindors were all about second chances?’
Weasley bristles, but again Granger lays a hand on his arm.

Harry is in his class, and yet Harry didn’t
Daphne snorts. ‘What happened to the last one?’
In which Tonks investigates, Narcissa realises something and the author posts without editing (sorry about that).
Blaise had thought it was something to do with the fight Draco and Theo had—seeing that Draco has ignored all of them ever since it happened. Yet now, as Draco trudges over to his bed, rubbing his eyes and looking like he could sleep for months, he wonders if there’s something else going on.
Beyond where he works, the Large One lumbers around the clearing. His footsteps cause the earth to tremble, sending faint vibrations up through the tank walls. He hums as he works. The low, rumbling hum of a creature content.
Blaise frowns at him.
‘You made that? Wow, that’s, um, that’s really, er, it’s really good. I could’ve helped, you know.’
Scorpius, in the perfect timing of all toddlers, looks up at his father with an adorable lopsided grin and gurgles, ‘fuck!’
Blaise looks up from his languid inspection of the ceiling to see Draco step through, not even bothering to close the door behind him. He makes his way across to the group of sofas recently acquired by the sixth years (an acquisition that resulted in a rather vicious scuffle between Pansy and two seventh years and yet another restructure in the power hierarchy that ruled over Slytherin house).
Harry chuckles but complies.
Immediately, the two girls erupt into giggles. ‘Thanks!’ they say, and take off down the hall.
Truth is, he knows
Harry rolls away, avoiding a punch to the head from Ron, before scrabbling to his feet and pulling out his wand. He swipes blood from his nose, and levels Ron with his wand.
Only, he’s going to see his best friend. That is, if Harry is still his best friend. Ron isn’t sure after their conversation yesterday. If it could be called a conversation. After all, that was why he was here, wasn’t it? On his own, ready to patch things up with Harry without anyone else getting in the way or confusing him.
Draco blinks. ‘You don’t…’ he trails off. Oh. ‘Wait, you’ve never…?’
Eric seems to realise he’s misstepped. ‘O-oh, well sure. I mean, she’s a Ravenclaw so I suppose she has to be…’
Malfoy glowers and, after a moment, punches him in the arm.
She lifted her chin, a strange smile lifting her lips—part victory and part loss.
‘He’s not making it easy,’ she says to the photo. ‘He never does. But I’ll do my best. I can do that much at least. For whatever that is worth.’
The Speaker pauses. He whirls around. Stomps back over toward them. He reaches into his pocket and the Pale One stiffens as the Speaker withdraws a small red something out from his pockets and tosses it toward him.
is going on.
What had she done?
Minerva has had enough. She exchanges a look with Poppy (who is watching from the door to her office, a harried and exasperated look on her face).
‘Luna?’ he asks, staring up at her in confusion.
‘Course not,’ says Hagrid with a smile. ‘There’s a cart between here and the next enclosure.’
She raises an eyebrow at him, stepping across the threshold with the same poise and dignity as she had almost six months ago. Although this time she is, mercifully, alone.
‘Oh?’
doing with it.’
Harry’s blush deepens and in a motion that is filled with embarrassment, he picks the towel back up to scrub at his hair, seemingly unbothered by the confession that Malfoy is
He squeezes his eyes shut again. ‘Hurts,’ he says, his voice croaking.
Then he catches sight of Poppy and Minerva.
He hesitates, his hand dropping back down to his side. ‘I’m sorry,’ he says, not quite meeting her gaze.
Harry all but dragged the two of them there. With all their deliberating, they weren’t the first ones to get there. There was a small crowd of Hogwarts students already gathered at the base of the monstrous ride, gaping up at the contraption that so many Muggles were lined up eagerly to ride.
Malfoy rolls his eyes. ‘Of course you’d think that,’ he scowls. ‘No, Potter, I didn’t go through all the effort of saving your sorry arse only to torment you at school. Merlin.’
‘What is that?’ asks Ginny, her voice soft, her face understanding that there is some significance to this book.
‘You want to share your birthday cake with me?’ Romilda asks, glancing back and forth between them.
Ginny pokes him in the ribs. ‘Hey, d’you want the attention or not?’
Potter frowns. ‘If you were then why did you flirt with me?’
Harry glances at Malfoy, shifting his weight back and forth from foot to foot.
‘Gotta go,’ says Potter, pushing up. He pauses, hands still on the table as he looks down at Draco. ‘But you better make a decision fast. Today is the deadline for class projects, and I’m picking one with or without you.’
‘He did,’ says Luna. ‘In his own way.’
Potter glances around the room, eyes trailing over the last group to leave the room. Once the door swings shut, he leans forward over the observation rail and peers into one of the tanks. He opens his mouth, but no words come out, instead a soft whisper of hissing slips through the air.
Minerva narrows her eyes at him, but nods at Poppy and they move away from the beds.
‘How?’ asks Harry, and Draco can hear the frown in his voice.
‘I confess I don’t really understand. You love going for a ride,’ she says, frowning at him in concern. ‘Are you not well?’
‘Right. You’re not going to murder me, are you?’
‘Erm...Neville?’ comes Harry’s uncertain voice. ‘What’re you doing?’
Draco frowns. ‘Oh.’
Her fingers itch to reach out to him, to press a hand to his forehead and rub his back until he’s calm. Yet she knows that the very reason for her urge is the same reason that he will not allow it. He has been raised to dislike the touch of others, to shy away from comfort that his classmates would so readily long for.
There’s a moment of silence and Theo can’t breathe. Thinks he’s going to pass out. Or throw up.
The faint yellow shield shimmers into place just a fraction of a second before the spell hits it, fizzling out harmlessly against the barrier between Harry and Snape.
‘She’s going out with
‘Aren’t you two best friends or something?’
Draco lifts his chin, though the pink across his cheeks deepens. ‘Yes,’ he says imperiously. ‘Now. It’s…important.’
Hermione watches them for a moment, carefully placing her own handful of gathered ingredients on the table with deliberate slowness.
Hermione shakes her head. ‘You told us last time that when Dumbledore went to see him, he was already cruel and he liked to hurt people. That he kept trophies. Harry, does that sound like you? You kind and caring and
‘Yeah,’ says Harry coldly. ‘That’s it then.’
Harry glances back, and Eric offers him an apologetic smile. Harry holds back a sigh and looks back in front of him, wondering why on Earth he even agreed to this in the first place. No doubt Draco would berate him later for not just saying no, regardless of how pleased Hermione had looked when Harry had agreed. Hell, if it were Draco, he’d have hexed Eric for that dig at Luna.
Neville gulps. ‘Look, I’m sorry,’ he blurts. ‘I didn’t mean to—I mean, I was trying—I wasn’t
‘It’s a bit small,’ he says. ‘Good thing there are only two of us.’ he climbs up over the rail, nimbly dropping down onto the ice on the other side.
Ron.’
Malfoy frowns, looking away across the room. ‘So we can’t be friends, then?’
Draco winces, instantly irritated by the high pitched, whiney tone.
‘Draco,’ she returns, and leans her forearms against the open window, letting her perfectly manicured hands dangle out in the buffeting wind.
McGonagall sits down into complete silence. Blaise has never heard a silence quite like this one. It’s shock, disbelief and growing anger all rolled into one. Everyone is staring at McGonagall in disbelief, at least until, one by one, they all turn to look at either Potter or Draco.
The common room is full of the usual end-of-the-week noise and bustle. There are loud games of gobstones and exploding snap, various groups of conversationalists, and, of course, the usual Dean and Seamus’ group of gamblers plotting over in the corner.
‘That’s because they aren’t just friends.’
He scrambles backwards, off Malfoy, and straight back into the pool of spilled water—which had been the cause of their ending up sprawled on the floor together in the first place. That and the argument they’d been having.
Behind them, Ron snaps, ‘could pick any slower, Malfoy?’ Far more viciously than Lavender thinks is required. ‘None of them are made of gold, you know.’
Draco quirks one eyebrow. ‘You are

. Yet Colin knows which photo it is.
Weasley snarls, but before he can lunge, Harry is there, grabbing the boys arm.
‘Yeah, but—’
‘Um, what?’ asks Vince.
She shakes her head at him, glances after Malfoy. ‘Holy mother of Merlin,’ she says.
‘Yes,’ says Harry.
as a bludger is sent careening in her direction. She dips the nose of her broom down, hears a loud whistle or air skate across her head, and resumes her rush at the goals.
Distress comes off him in waves, and the urge to go and reassure him makes Albus’ limbs twitch, but there’s a student of his bleeding out on his Hospital bed and so he pushes aside his concerns about Harry and moves to help Poppy.
A huge shimmering dome stretches high above them in an arc. Heards of flying horses swoop overhead, braying and calling out to one another as they glide gracefully once, twice above the entrance square before disappearing over the tops of a line of trees.
Potter looks at him curiously, his feet crunching along the leaves on the path. ‘You’ve just called me every insult known to man, and now you want to get ice-cream?’
Ron scowls. He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. ‘They would,’ he says evenly. ‘But you…know more. About things that we don’t.’
‘What exactly does that mean?’ asks Blaise.
Draco grins. ’Oh, shut up, Potter,’ he says, and kisses him again.
‘Sir?’ says Malfoy after a long moment of silence.
‘You’re not going to tell me, are you?’
Harry flushes red. He glances around the table and lowers his voice.
‘Malfoy?’ he asks, staring down at the pale haired boy, unable to quite believe he’s there.
Draco, his whole face covered in the cute pink blush, stomps out of the room, brushing past Harry and leaving him with nothing but his guffawing laughter and the tantalising smell of coconut and lemons.
have a
Theo shoots him a sidelong look. He shrugs. ‘Odd how?’
‘Oh for the love of magic,’ Ginny says, sweeping her hair back out of her face in exasperation. ‘Can’t you even
He hesitates, unsure how to continue. Harry doesn’t say anything, just keeps staring out the window, his face turned away from Ron. Ron sighs and scratches the back of his neck.
‘I didn’t think you’d ever pull your head out of arse long enough to be more than a vain, preening peacock,’ snaps Draco, stopping next to him and scanning the crowd ‘But here we are. Guess we’re both being surprised today.’
The keeper flushes. ‘It’s not what you think,’ he says hurriedly. ‘Just…I’ve heard he’s a parseltongue.’
‘I don’t believe you.’
. This doesn’t just affect
‘For whatever reason?’ asks Zabini doubtfully. He snorts and shakes his head. ‘Potter’s about as subtle as an ox.’
She sighs. ‘Honestly?’ she says. ‘I’m not sure. There’s not really time to talk to him tonight, and tomorrow you’re going to the Zoo.’
Eric drops his arm. ‘What, no more advice?’
The irritation vanishes from her face and she offers him a sympathetic smile. ‘Nightmares?’ she asks softly.
‘No,’ says Harry. ‘I did.’
‘Oh please, like Professor Lupin wasn’t the
She has an armful of things that scatter all over the place as she drops them onto her desk. She straightens up, sweeps her hair out of her face and turns to check the display table—all the while chattering away like an excitable first year.
Malfoy crosses the room, looking down to examine the tower of cards Luna and Ginny are making. ‘You need to place a card here or Weasley will win,’ he says, gesturing.
‘What do you think? Shall we go for a ride?’
Harry nods, grinning. ‘You point that circular end at your hair, turn it on and it blows hot air at you.’
Once upon a time they had treated
Malfoy scowls but manages not to say anything insulting.
‘Easier? To just abandon me on this project?’
Harry scoffs. ‘
‘Sorry to break this up,’ says Malfoy, stepping forward to grab Potter’s arm again. ‘But like he said, we only have an hour or so left, so we best keep going.’
Draco pulls out a small basket from one of the pockets, enlarges it, and opens the lid, withdrawing a mug and shoving it at Harry, effectively cutting him off.
‘Pomfrey sees everything that goes on in those rooms. There’s no way she’d leave her office, or more importantly her patient files, unguarded. We’d have as much luck as an ashwinder in a snowstorm of getting our hands them.’
‘Ah, ah,’ Draco winces and immediately Harry lets go. ‘Bloody hell don’t stop!’
Finally, he says, ‘that’s all I need.’
‘Shove off, you’re pulling my leg aren’t you?’
‘Yes, to finish this stupid assignment that I’m stuck working with you on.’
Draco finds him by the change rooms, hanging up a coat on a peg.
Poppy raises an eyebrow. She glances over at Minerva, unable to quell her curiosity on the other woman’s reaction. Minerva, as always, is unflappable. She’s hiding her interest by pretending to flick through a book she’s produced from somewhere—though Poppy sees a small twitch in the corner of her mouth. Amusement, perhaps?
Malfoy gives him a once over, the corners of his lips lifting into a smirk as he takes in the shirt in all it’s glory. ‘Yep, that’s you alright.’
Malfoy frowns, looking away. ‘I know you want to fight. I know you can’t help yourself. But…if you just stay out of his way, he’ll leave you alone. He will.’
She sighs at him. ‘Nothing,’ she says, shaking her head. ‘What’s wrong with you tonight?’
‘Oh, shut up would you,’ says Harry, swatting at him and resting his hand against Harry’s hip.
The change comes gradually…unexpectedly, creeping through Harry’s thoughts with such subtlety that he doesn’t notice until it’s too late. Until he’s well and truly transfixed. Until his mouth is pressed firmly against unexpectedly soft lips, drawing forth a faint gasp of air, a sharp intake of breath that sends the heartbeat under Harry’s palm racing and warmth bursting through Harry’s insides like warm honey. Honey and lemons, he thinks, the smell tickling at his nose, drawing him further into this momentary insanity without him even realising.
‘They aren’t looking for Harry,’ she says. ‘Well, they’re not
The air shifts again, sending static tingling along Luna’s arms. Draco is staring down at one of the pages, the colour draining away from his face and leaving him ashen and shaking.
Harry blanches. ‘Flirting?’
‘If you recall,’ Minerva snaps. ‘Potter’s been attacked several times of late. Not to mention the fact that his
A strange look crosses Harry’s face at Bellatrix’s name. ‘I…sorry, I don’t feel well,’ he says, cutting off Slughorn.
,’ Potter finishes insistently.
Potter trails behind her with that beseeching look on his face that is both pleading and stubborn. The pleading expression is all James Potter, from the messy hair right down to the little quirk of his lips, but the stubbornness shinning out of those green eyes is all Lily Evans.
‘You do?’
‘It’s okay,’ says Potter, and shrugs again. ‘I’ve kinda accepted it.’
‘You know, I’m no longer surprised that you’re queer.’
‘What’re you blind as well as stupid, Weasley?’
Colin hesitates, the pile of photos in his hand, contemplates putting some back in his bag. The ones at the back of the pile. Explain that they weren’t developed properly. Malfoy rolls his eyes and sighs, reaching forward to snatch them from his hand.
Malfoy winces. ‘I know. I just…I can’t help it.’
‘Luna?’
‘So?’
Warmth radiates along his shoulders, the water pressure working away at the tension in his shoulders and the dried sweat still clinging to his skin.
Poppy is a patient woman. After all, she’s worked with Albus Dumbledore for over twenty years, and Merlin knows that man can test the patience of any sane witch or wizard that is forced to spend prolonged periods of time in his presence.
‘Uh, I was wondering if maybe you could help me with an idea I had,’ he says. ‘Malfoy and I have this project with a horned serpent and—’
‘Wait,’ says Ernie, straightening up in his seat. ‘You can make muggle stuff work?’
‘Where?’ he says in one breath, glancing sideways at her.
‘So what? You just thought you’d get in first did you? You think that just because he was blustering and making threats—which, by the way, he does to
. Ginny envies him. He glances up at her as she’s watching and offers her a smile. She returns it with a weak one of her own, clenching her hands tighter in her sheets.
Ginny looks like she wants to say something, but her eyes flicker over to Katie and she chews on her lip. Katie realises that they think she doesn’t know what they’re talking about. She was still walking over to them when Harry mentioned being rejected. They don’t realise she heard the conversation.
Harry almost chokes on his coffee. ‘My—er.’ Harry clears his throat. ‘He’s not…er, well that is, um. Lemon slice, actually. I mean, you make a really nice one, and I think…well, he’d like that.’
The keeper smiles. He steps up to the Runespoor tank, where the snake has slithered closer to the glass and was trying to catch Potter’s attention.
A glow that only bubbles further to life as Ron defends two quaffle throws in a row. He grins wide and calls out to the Slytherin chasers,
‘Think of only me,’ he says. He trails his fingers up Harry’s arm, and rests his palm on Harry’s neck. ‘Think of this. Right now.’
‘I told you to stay out of it.’
Laughter echoes around the table, the money and the photos momentarily forgotten in favour of the comfort of friendship—a friendship that started with a bet and ended with a mutual relief that, finally, they could all stop pretending to hate each other.
‘I knew it. You think it’s about them too, don’t you?’
Harry glances up, blinking in confusion. He raises one of his arms, weighing it slightly. ‘Down my sleeve I think. Why?’
He takes the ring out of the box, studying it for a moment, before slipping it onto his finger. He stares at it, takes it back off, and slips it into his pocket.
‘I can’t,’ he gasps. ‘I don’t…I can’t…’
She pushes out into the hall, a smirk settling into place at the thought of what she could do with this information.
Colin flushes and scratches the back of his neck. ‘Uh, well, almost,’ he says, his hand falling to the bag on the bench next to him.
‘Then why’d you take that bludger for me?’
‘Ignore him,’ say Ginny, leaning back in to press her lips firmly back against his. ‘It’s what I do.’
‘Wait,’ he says. ‘Are you saying this is something you want?’
‘Ten galleons,’ he says.
‘And this is note-worthy?’
Draco sighs again. ‘Life is confusing,’ he says to the ceiling.
At least she knows better than to bother reminding him about curfew.
Out of reflex, Draco glances up, dragging his thoughts away from libraries and fires and the warmth of someone sitting close—
‘I don’t believe it,’ says Blaise, denial plastered all over his face even as he stares down at the photographic evidence.
‘Merlin Potter, you act like you’ve never showered around other people before.’
She shakes her head, effectively cutting him off. He had to figure this out himself. If she told him to use magic, he would resist her. She knows—from Poppy’s observations—that Potter hasn’t so much as touched his wand since waking up after the fire.
‘Of course he means together,’ Malfoy says, reaching over and yanking Harry out of his seat. ‘Fear not Potter, I’ll keep ten metres away at all times if it helps keep you calm. Heavens knows I can’t afford to catch anymore of your clumsiness than I already have.’
Ginny’s grin widens. ‘Oh, he doesn’t,’ she says, then adds, ‘never mind, it’s a joke. How much for twelve?’
Draco pauses. ‘What, do you shower at midnight every night or something?’
Harry, as Albus predicted, is right there hovering at the edge of the bed. Behind him, interestingly, are the rest of the sixth year Slytherin boys (excepting Mr Vincent Crabbe, who had missed the mornings excitements due to a previously arranged rendezvous with Miss Millicent Bulstrode), each in varying stages of shock judging from the looks on their faces. Without breaking stride, Poppy waves her free hand and four blocks of chocolate whiz across the room toward the four students, her wandwork not faltering in the least at this feat of double spellwork.
Harry squared his shoulders. He dug for that determination and defiance that Malfoy so often made him feel, dug for the indignation and the will to rise to the challenge and, with as much ferocity as he could manage he said, ‘You wish,’ and stepped into the room.
The Speaker shrugs. ‘Well she does,’ he says. ‘It’s Blue.’
‘Yes, well,’ says Madam Pomfrey, shaking her head. ‘You needn’t worry about that. Miss Vane will be dealt with. Along with any other love potion chocolates lying around the castle.’
‘Shut up.’
Theo crouches down slowly to reach for his own wand, discarded on the floor, but in a flash Draco’s wand is up and pointed at him again, the look on his face expressing clear enough that Theo is lucky that spell wasn’t aimed at
She laughs. ‘Of course I am,’ she says and gestures toward the staircase. ‘Lead the way.’
have broken limbs and are unable to get help then where will we be?’
He’s studying one of the cat portraits on her wall when she glances up at him from over her glasses and frowns.
For a brief moment, he contemplates following that familiar scent. The wolf is buried deep, but he’s sure he could do it. Even without the moon’s presence, his sense of smell has always been superior than others.
It doesn’t really make sense, but it has the desired reaction. He presses the pillow into his face and lets out a frustrated yell (muffled by the pillow)
He glares skywards, sighs, says, ‘
‘So…Draco seemed a little odd during class, don’t you think?’
did you know Draco would be sneaking over there?’
‘We’re not fighting,’ says the Boy tightly. ‘We’re just…not talking.’
‘Er, yeah,’ says Potter, wincing. ‘But we’re in the same year, so classes and what not. Did you not go to Hogwarts?’
‘What’s wrong?’ Hermione asks from where she and Ron are hovering over his shoulder, (not that Ginny blames them when he’s come in looking as he is). ‘Who did you fight with?’
Harry watches him, trying not to be obvious, but unable to keep from staring. As unable as he’s been all year so far.
‘You…’
‘You don’t have to yell at her,’ mutters the Pale One, stepping forward to peer in at her in concern. ‘You shouldn’t have let her into your robes. She’s not a pet.’
The hallway goes still. Ron may not be the most observant person in the world, but even he notices the way they all stare, including Malfoy’s own friends, at the hideously disfigured inky black mark taking up the majority of Malfoy’s forearm.
He has his own greenhouse. He has his
‘Ron! Hang on a minute, just, let me explain—‘
Slughorn raises an eyebrow. ‘Fine, then you can both stay back and clean it up.’
’Think I’ll pass,’ says Harry, poking his tongue out. ‘Maybe you’ll learnt not to be an arse when people try to help you.’
‘But—’
Harry begins to stir, a frown marring his features, tossing slightly. Without a word, Malfoy slips out of bed, crosses the room and lays down on top of the covers next to Harry.
Ginny’s adrenaline spikes up another notch as she watches Harry sink into the water. Without thinking, she slips sideways off her broom.
‘Hey,’ he says, and glances back at Narcissa, gesturing to the window. ‘The storm has stopped. I think I’m up for that ride now, if you’re still interested?’
He stares across the room, at window that looks out to the forest. ‘I…I was wondering if I can take the leaf out yet?’
Potter’s smile widens. He turns to Poppy.
Blaise scoffs, but struggles to actually come up with an answer. ‘I don’t have to go into the intimate details of my sex life, Malfoy.’
‘Uh, I’m not…sure,’ says Potter, glancing around again—as if he might find the answer to Draco’s question in the furniture around the dorm. He rubs the back of his neck. ‘I think I was in the hospital wing.’
They run up the final set of stairs, turn a corner and enter a hallway filled with smoke.
A few people titter as Theo sinks into the seat, his face taut and pale.
Draco’s vision clears just in time to see Pomfrey shoot Albus a dark look. She lowers Potter back onto the bed, adjusts his blankets and then turns to glower at the Headmaster.
After a long moment, however, the silence stretches out, disrupting her research. She sighs, pausing mid-sentence and glancing up at him.
Potter shifts. He rearranges the scarf around his neck again, staring at the ends of the knitted fabric.
‘He has a
‘Done,’ he says, and Theo smirks as if Blaise is the easiest sucker in Slytherin.
Draco nods, facing forward again. ‘I can understand that,’ he says in a quiet voice.
‘Why didn’t you levitate him?’ she asks, ducking under Ron to slip an arm around Harry’s waist and prop him up.
‘Really?’ Harry asks. ‘Why?’
‘Where is he?’
. At least he was nice to look at—certainly nicer than
The crowds disburse—rather quickly after that display—but the boys linger. They’re still sitting on the little benches, and Tonks notes that they’re slightly closer together than necessary, their shoulders pressed together.
is involved with someone in Slytherin?’
Harry blanches. ‘What? What the hell is an erumpent?’
?’ asks Ron. ‘Hell, I thought it was Malfoy for sure with some dark spell.’
‘Well I didn’t think you did it up on purpose, but seriously Harry,’ she shakes her head. ‘You’ve got to get a handle on this.’
So how does it go so wrong?
Ginny pokes her tongue out at him. ‘Why not? Could be fun.’
Malfoy puts out a hand, palm up, and Colin stares at it, uncomprehending. Malfoy arches one brow. The look is effective. Everything about Malfoy is pristine and poised. His cheekbones are high, and he embodies aristocratic features, not just physically, but in every expression, purposeful in it’s intent.
‘Admit it,’ says Theo and raises his wand to point square at Potter’s face. ‘
‘But he’s sad,’ Ginny mutters. ‘You need your friends when you’re sad. To hold your heart together so you don’t break. I don’t want him to break. He’s my best friend.’
, remember? I’m in detention.’
She stands waiting just beyond the ticketing booth—a small rectangular booth posing as a coffee shed—watching the crowds for Hagrid’s tell tale height, and frowns when she sees no sign of them. It’s a little after nine, and they were supposed to be here over ten minutes ago.
‘A...a friend,’ he says at length, dropping his gaze back to the books, eyes crinkled at the edges.
‘And you did
With a snarl, he throws his scrubbing brush back into the cauldron, sending soap suds puffing up everywhere. ‘I’m sorry,’ he says, harsher than he means to, but Harry’s footsteps still stop. ‘I’m not angry at you.’
‘And normally when something like this class situation happens, Draco gets all fired up and outraged and just generally causes everyone endless amounts of headaches for
‘They were just scratches. He can’t have…I wasn’t…’
They confound Pansy Parkinson, who chases after Draco Malfoy with renewed interest.
She’s sprawled on the floor in front of the fire, going through quidditch photos with Colin and Dennis. They’ve been at it for an hour so far, and every now and then they ask his opinion—though he’s not entirely sure why.
Ron shakes his head. ‘Remind me not to piss you off,’ he says, and grins at Harry, nudging his shoulder. ‘Sorry I said all that about it being dark magic.’
‘Malfoy,’ says Longbottom. ‘Last night.’
Potter frowns.
Harry’s eyes go wide. ‘I…well, I…that’s not…’ His neck goes red, and his gaze flicks sideways toward her and away again.
‘Actually,’ says Weasley, cutting Draco off with a tense voice. ‘I’m here to ask for your help.’
‘No,’ Potter says, and kisses him again. ‘This is enough.’
‘Yes but he
Malfoy brought Zabini because he was
Harry sighs. He’s not really that upset. After all, any excuse to spend a bit more time with Draco is fine by him. But it’s the principal.
‘Would that I could Potter,’ says Malfoy, snickering, ‘would that I could.’
‘Erm,’ says Neville to the table. ‘I…McGonagall wanted me to tell you detention is over,’ he says, and then because he can’t think of any other way to make the situation better, he pushes away from the table and flees.
‘No!’ says Theo, and frustration breaks the strange calm brought on by his confession. ‘It was
‘I did something
She takes a deep breathe and begins. ‘To put it plainly, Harry has an illness that is making him lose control of his magic. As things stand, his accidental magic is going to get worse and worse until—’ She hesitates, stumbling over the words, unable to speak them allowed in case they solidify Harry’s fate. ‘—Until he loses control. As it stands there is no known cure, no remedy, no spell that can reverse it. At least not yet.’
A deep heaviness washes over him, relaxing his muscles, making his eyes droop. ‘You…you drugged me,’ he says accusingly.
Reluctant, he does so, uncurling from the position he’s been screwed up in. Once he’s straight, she taps on his shoulder, slipping her hand behind him to help him sit up. She has a cup of foul smelling liquid in her other hand.
‘Well neither can I!’
They torment him. Plaguing his sleep and his waking thoughts with whispers and yearnings, driving him well and truly to distraction. So much so that Hermione has to ask him a question three times before he realises she’s talking to him.
Harry chuckles. ‘Oh, so that’s the reason?’
Severus ushers the stretcher by, his face pale as he helps manoeuvre the blood soaked boy onto the bed. 'I've stemmed the bleeding, but there was too much damage and—' he breaks off, swallowing sharply as he stares down at the boy he has vowed to protect.
Blaise catches her eye and nudges the pumpkin juice closer to her. She smirks, picks up the jug and pours a mug for Draco, handing him the cup diligently.
has transpired here. Come on, move!’
‘It’s not,’ says the Speaker, staring moodily at the ground. ‘It doesn’t hurt.’
She gets up and heads to the front of the class, her hands jittering and sweaty. She wipes her hands on her skirt and picks up her assignment.
‘It was an accident,’ objects the boy quietly. ‘I- I didn’t mean—’
Ginny is ready to argue with him, to demand what exactly happened, when he casts her a sideways look and adds, ‘I expect you’ll be wanting to get back to Dean?’
‘…it’s not like I broke them on
reason?’ asks Ron incredulously. ‘Why would he keep something like this from us?’
Blaise grins and nudges Theo. ‘Come on, at least there aren’t many Gryffindor’s in Ancient Runes.’
‘Lost it?’ Ron asks, the irritation bleeding out of his expression as the confusion takes hold.
Still, at least Phineas can be sure that Albus gets the right idea.
‘That’s what Pomfrey says,’ says Ron in a tired voice. ‘Those are the likely outcomes.’
Eric chuckles. ‘Something like that.’
He turns, his gaze flicking over them but resting that little bit too long on each of his dorm mates. On Blaise, an Greg and Theo himself.
Her lips purse, though she seems unsurprised by his knowledge. ‘Yes,’ she says curtly, and glances at the other occupants in the room pointedly.
‘Are they ready yet? I’d love to see them,’ she says, and shoots him a grin. ‘I mean, only if I look badass, of course.’
‘Bloody hell, what happened do you think?’
A knock at the door startles her, and she turns, eyes wide having almost forgotten that there were others coming.
‘You’re supposed to be my girlfriend!’ Dean shouts. ‘You’re supposed to be with me, not gallivanting around with another guy in bloody closets!’
‘If only I can have that same faith in myself,’ Poppy mutters under her breath. She shakes her head and straightens up, looking up at Minerva with a determined gleam in her tired eyes. ‘Well, it’s not over until the Fat Lady stops singing, now is it?’
‘Cool…okay,’ she says. ‘Just, uh, you seem sort of—’
‘So, where are we going?’ asks Eric, glancing around. ‘I didn’t know there were classrooms up here.’
A few people chuckle. Zach, once again, goes beat red.
‘I told you I need your help. We have to…there’s something I need.’
trunk—especially considering it’s contents) on it.
Theo looks back. Draco’s expression is stony and defeated, and yet there’s that edge to his voice and a glint in his eye and a determination that Theo has seen only once before. The only time that anyone ever stood up to Theo’s father.
He can see the cogs work working in Severus’s mind, the suspicion of Albus being up to something, the confusion at it being something that for once (in his mind) doesn’t benefit Harry.
‘Believe it,’ says Ron, chuckling as he taps the photos spread across the table they’re gathered at. ‘And pay up.’
Harry, on the other hand, doesn’t look surprised. His shoulders sag, and he runs a hand through his hair, shooting Draco a quick look that Myrtle can’t interpret.
get back on track for the lesson.
Draco stares, storm grey eyes roiling with emotion, his face pale and desperate and furious. Theo thinks for a minute that Draco might challenge him. Might call his bluff and tell him to shove off. He doesn’t though. He can’t. Theo realises this just as Draco’s shoulders slump. He can’t risk it. Because Theo is right.
Yes, okay, so I fell off the side of the Earth for a little bit. I've no excuse, life just got crazy for a bit.
‘You honestly expect me to believe that you don’t know what’s going on?’ Zabini is saying, one eyebrow arched artfully.
A small bur of satisfaction worms it’s way along Hermione’s spine. ‘Good.’
He looks up at her, meeting her gaze properly for the first time since they’d run into each other. ‘How do you do it?’
She contemplates calling out, giving the boys away and making them leave her sanctity, but…it’s been
tend to be those things that drip out of Hermione’s voluminous brain, making room for things of a more concrete nature.
Oh, sure, Harry has always been a brooder. But this is different. This is deeper. Darker. A despondency that encompasses him and it gnaws at her, filling her with worry each time she sees him. It’s like he’s gone right back to how he was at the start of the year, with his secrets and his hidden pain, and she longs to know what it is that’s changed?
‘Maybe Potter isn’t the one who got humiliated?’
‘Alright,’ she says with a smile. ‘Lemon slice it is. My, it’s been quite a while since I’ve made a lemon slice. What do you think, should we add a bit of curd?’
in the day; and no matter how many times I tried to explain that digital Muggle clocks tell the time with numbers, he just couldn’t get it through that thick skull of his because oh, he’s taken a few Muggle Studies classes so now he’s an “expert”. God! He’s such a ridiculous prat!’
‘You bloody well will not,’ snaps Draco, still struggling against his sheets.
‘Perhaps,’ she concedes. ‘It
Pansy tilts her head. ‘About Potter?’
Remus frowns. ‘You would have thought what?’
They flush and the room is thrown back into silence.
Dennis chuckles. ‘Yes I do.’
‘Both Weasley’s, Zabini, Goyle and Malfoy,’ she says in a soft voice. ‘They’re all okay.’
‘Don’t do that,’ says Draco, and flicks Harry. ‘Aren’t you cold?’
Harry pushes up to his feet, Blue coiling around his shoulders. ‘What the hell is your problem? What did I
She casts a quick glance over the pile, ignoring Bella as she tears into the small pile of carefully wrapped gifts (that Narcissa had
‘You think I’m happy about this? I didn’t mean to hit him, okay? He was walking away and I thought it was Malfoy who grabbed me. I’d have never have intentionally hit
‘Nothing,’ says the Speaker.
‘Trust me,’ says Draco, and kisses him softly.
Neville swallows and nods, almost tripping on his way to the chair opposite her. She continues with her work for several tense moments, leaving Neville no choice but to glance around her office, feeling very much like he’s sweating through his robes.
be that idiotic.’
A huge, white wolf appears, skulking out from the shadows to place itself between Harry and the tigeress. He snarls, and the tiger balks. She reconsiders (a smart move being that she is much smaller than the large wolf), turns and bounds away. The wolf turns to face Harry.
‘Yes! If those bloody Slytherin’s are talking shit about me—’
Blaise grins, but it’s Potter’s reaction that’s interesting.
Draco stares back up at him, unable to see his face but imagining the expression there. The tight expression of anger and frustration fuelling Potter’s mad-dash across the sky. It’s the only explanation for the complete lack of regard to his own safety.
‘Tsk, you’re no fun anymore,’ pouts Pansy, crossing her arms and sticking out her hip. She narrows her gaze at him. ‘Are you screwing around with some other girl?’
‘So,’ says Ginny turning back to face Katie. ‘Now that we’ve been traumatised by our captain, want to get this practice started?’
‘I didn’t say it was,’ says Malfoy, and he turns that sharp blue gaze back on Neville. ‘Well? What do you want?’
He doesn’t answer. He frowns out at the grounds, his gaze distant.
‘A bit?’
‘Er, thanks,’ says Harry, his neck turning red.
‘Fuck you!’ snarls Ron, taking a step forward, his wand back in his hand.
‘Sorry?’
‘Have you finished your essay yet?’ Ginny asks, frowning down at her own half finished homework.
They weave their way through the corridors, the oddest trio to ever walk the castle halls. Students stare as they pass, parting like the sea parts for ships sailing through the night. Draco leads the way, his posture reverting back to his usual form, leaving no trace of the misery and pain that he is no doubt still feeling. His expression is focused and unfazed, as if there is nothing at all out of the ordinary for him to be leading a Gryffindor lion and a lonely Ravenclaw through the halls of Hogwarts. And really, why shouldn’t he be?
Potter mutters something in response that Dean can’t hear, and, despite himself, he leans into the door, straining his ears to listen.
The smell of toffee and tea tickles Pansy’s nose as she pulls up her stockings. She straightens, smoothing down her skirt and setting an appraising look around the room.
I’ve had some clarity. Whatever this is we’ve been doing, while enjoyable, needs to end.
A sly grin spreads across Potter’s face. ‘Are you asking me to run away with you?’
behind her sudden caution creeps through him, almost distracting him from his current task. Yet there was no time.
Poppy rolls her eyes. ‘Two files full of injury accounts from the constant fights and there’s “nothing else that can be done”. Honestly, sometimes I wonder about that man. Well, I’m not convinced. There’s something they aren’t telling us, and I think I might have a solution to finding it out. Might even cure this rivalry they can’t seem to get enough of.’
He’s doing this. He’s doing this and he can’t make it stop. This isn’t like the lake, or the bludger or any of the times before. They were bursts. Short and powerful sure, but this? He can feel the magic cascading through him. Intensifying with each sharp breath he sucks in.
Colin would love to photograph them. Up close, just her eyes crinkled in a smile, with a peek at her freckles smattered across the bridge of her nose.
At the top of the stairs, Harry leaned over the rail to look down into the common area.
‘And for Merlin’s sake,’ she adds, smirking cheekily (least he get the wrong impression). ‘stop taking it out on the rest of us. Greg’s looking about as fragile as a glass flower. Honestly, you were far more pleasant when you were shagging him.’
‘Wait,’ says Zabini, holding up his hand. ‘How did he get this illness? If it’s a disease, how does it spread? How did he catch it?’
Why did he have to be such a klutz?
Blue eyes snap open, stormy and full of fire. ‘You don’t know that.’
Not that there’s anything to be prudish about, Draco is well concealed behind the curtain. He gives Potter one last warning glare and yanks the curtain shut again, restarting the water.
Tonks breathes a small sigh of relief. If Malfoy hadn’t stopped Potter, that keeper would have heard.
The Hospital Wing. He’s in the Hospital Wing.
Malfoy pauses, glancing sideways at Potter.
‘Dork,’ she retorts.
? You named her
‘Potter?’ he says, his voice as bewildered and sleepily-confused as his expression. ‘What the fuck are you doing here?’
Ron groans. ‘But
, Potter is worried about fighting classmates on the other side. He was dating one. Or at least (what with her bet with Kingsley) she
She slows her pace, figuring they might as well go inside together, but he’s so lost in his own thoughts, he doesn’t see her until he’s about three steps from running into her. He looks up and with a startled gasp, falls backwards a step.
Malfoy shrugs. ‘So long as both devices function in a similar fashion, I suppose so. Rune-work is more of an art rather than a set of rules.’

Harry drops his gaze and kicks at the floor with the toe of his shoe. ‘I have feelings for him,’ he mumbles in a soft voice.
Myrtle frowns. It’s a strange thing. It doesn’t really
shield.’
Poppy watches him, her foot tapping lightly as she decides what to do. ‘You did well,’ she ventures, keeping her voice from being too enthusiastic.
‘Well you can relax,’ says Ginny, glowering. ‘Because that’s not something you’ll have to worry about anymore.’
‘I’m not overly fond of you either, Weasley.’
‘So we don’t let them find out,’ says Potter.
‘There you have it,’ says Minerva, pleasantly surprised by Hagrid’s plan.
He lowers his head, leaning on his knees and letting it hang toward the floor.
His heart is pounding so hard it hurts, restricting his breathing so he can’t get enough air.
‘You know,’ says Dean through clenched teeth. ‘I tried. I really did. I told myself it wasn’t true. That they were just rumours.’ He shakes his head. ‘Did you really think you could get away with this?’
Harry’s jaw clenches. He looks away and sighs.
‘Parkinson, oi Parkinson!’
‘Do you plan on lurking out there all night?’ Draco asks, ducking under the hot shower and relishing in the warmth (even if his enjoyment is somewhat marred by the fact that Potter is standing less than ten feet away). ‘Stop standing around like an idiot and pick a shower. It’s not like this is the only one.’
we’re talking about. You think I don’t know when you’re off shagging someone?’
He shakes his head. ‘I didn’t,’ he says helplessly, his voice catching. ‘Not on purpose. I…I was angry. I tried to make it stop…But it wouldn’t…it just wouldn’t.’
‘—just don’t have overly fond memories of Zoos,’ comes Potter’s voice.
about control.
His blush, if possible, deepens.
‘You know,’ says Earnie, leaning closer to Lisa to keep from being overheard. ‘I think they’re actually getting better at this.’
, followed by a brief curse. Somewhere outside, a familiar voice echoes back that curse. Harry’s eyes fly open.
Ron glances at Hermione again and shrugs. An awkward silence falls over them all.
‘Why would I lie about that?’
Minerva frowns. ‘Yet you’re still worried,’ she observes.
‘Duly noted,’ says Blaise, with only a
‘Us? Why?’
Harry licks his lips. He nods a little.
‘Well?’ barks Severus.
‘Alright,’ she says. ‘On one condition.’
‘The snitch had gotten loose, and you were both chasing after it,’ says Colin, and offers Harry a small smile. ‘You were both laughing and…’
resume classwork.’
all night at the Halloween party. You made me think…’
‘Hagrid, you want anything?’
Harry tilts his head, ‘How’d you know we’re working on potions?’
Potter—who had been gazing up into Pod’s opal eyed gaze—leans around Malfoy to look between Hagrid and the Keeper. ‘Do you two know each other?’ he asks.
A surprised laugh echoes off the snow out into the crisp mountain air. ‘Yes, of course it is. Didn’t you know?’
‘Haven’t seen Malfoy, have you?’ he asks, his voice all gravely and funny sounding.
I’m sorry if I’ve caused you any distress, but my mind is made up. There are things you don’t know. Things you don’t understand.
Archie nods in agreement.
Harry glares at him, his face turning even more crimson, until he turns, scoops up a handful of fertiliser from a nearby pot and dumps it over Malfoy’s head.
The words are said casually enough, but the phrasing piques Tonks’ interest. The emphasis on
‘I…well, not because he’d
‘Er, the black…cube thing.’
Draco shrugs helplessly. ‘That’s just it,’ he says, and his voice is thick and rough as he leans back against the window sill, his hands gripping the stone. ‘I don’t know. I don’t know what I did wrong. I helped him, didn’t I? I gave him
‘Have you ever had to fight someone you know?’
Cold sweeps through Luna, drenching her in a sudden sweat. She swallows, feeling suddenly quite faint. She reaches out for Draco’s hands, his fingers as icy as her own as grasps hold of him, sucking in a sharp breath that isn’t full enough.
‘Er, well…’ Blaise says, but Draco continues.
Malfoy nods and heads back over to the change rooms.
I trust you.
‘Pay for tea of course. Or coffee, in your case. And I reserve the right to add cake.’
. His shoulders shake, and when he looks at Ron again there’s an expression Ron’s never seen on his face before. As if all the world has collapsed in on him, and Harry has just...given up.
He nods, slipping out the door. ‘Maybe I’ll bring you some cake,’ he says. ‘If there’s any left.’
‘I’ve already given you my answer. Now, go back to your dorm. I have patients to attend to.’

‘No, you don’t,’ snaps Draco. ‘He’s being an idiot.’
‘Oh really? That’s not what Neville said,’ she says contemptuously. ‘He says you tried to start a fight and Harry tried to stop you, so you
Draco rolls his eyes. ‘Oh, shut up,’ he says, and pulls him back in.
Potter nods emphatically, green eyes bright and wide with barely contained excitement. He beams at her with his mother’s smile and bounds over to his seat, practically glowing with barely restrained happiness. He slips into his seat next to a bemused Draco Malfoy and yanks out his book, completely missing the stares he’s receiving from his classmates.

Muggles trudge on by the line, barely paying attention to the oddly dressed groups. Some are in muggle gear, other’s steadfastly refuse to remove their outer robes.
Ginny is calmer. ‘Dean,’ she says, her voice cautious. ‘What’re you talking about? What did you hear?’
Hanging below the ceiling, suspended by magic, was the skeleton of what could only be a Basilisk.
‘Shut the hell up, Malfoy, and help me up.’
She purses her lips, but before she can say anything, the door opens again and Granger and Weasley push into the room, scanning the room anxiously for Potter.
Draco glances sideways at him. ‘Home?’ he asks, one eyebrow raised.
Draco sighs. He leans forward once again and places a quick kiss on Harry’s downturned lips. ‘Stop apologising.’
Malfoy glowers at him, but he uncrosses his arms, snatches the shirt and stomps over to the changing room.
Harry ducks his head, scratching at the back of his neck in that way he does when he’s nervous or self-conscious.
Kingsley could wait.
A/N: Phew, that was a struggle. My health issue has gotten worse so it’s been a bit difficult to get to the keyboard. I’ve definitely not stopped this story though, I just have to slow down unfortunately. I still hope to aim for once a week updates but with the way things are that may not happen so I hope you’ll be patient with me. I’m really enjoying writing this story, and there’s still a lot to go.
‘Here,’ she says, fishing a potion from the various pockets in her robes. ‘Drink this.’ She tips the potion gently down his throat and too late he realises what it is.
‘Sorry!’ he shouts, the words whipping away from him as he twists sharply to the left and dives hard after a flash of gold.
Draco scoffs, shooting Blaise a sideways scowl. If he had it his way, he’d rather be back inside beside the fire. Hell he’d rather be in the library, sitting next to—
‘Gryffindor’s and their bloody self-righteous martyrdom,’ he mutters, and glowers at the fading sun outside his window. ‘Where
for fucks sake, and he doesn’t hide from idiot Gryffindor’s (who should know better than to go skulking around the castle in the middle of the damn night) Draco pokes his head out of the shower to see that, yes, it
Two voices break through the mutterings, loud and arguing.
Ginny glances at her. ‘Of course,’ she says. ‘Why wouldn’t they love you? You’re amazing. Not that they’re good enough for you. I mean, any idiots who roll around on the floor
‘Oh, well…I’d offer you my robes but I forgot them,’ he says offering her a half smile.
exagerate where Potter is involved.’
Of course.
Potter glances at Draco, but despite the fact that Draco could no doubt feel Potter’s gaze (with the intensity with which Potter looks at
She heads out at the end of class, her mind buzzing. She’s so lost in her own thoughts that she doesn’t realise she’s taken the wrong path until she’s all alone. She blinks, staring about the empty corridor. Where had everyone gone? She swears she was only just following someone…
If it’s about all that other stuff, it doesn’t matter, not to me. Please don’t do this.
‘What do you want me to do?’ asks Harry, carefully lifting the painting to study it closer.
She nods. ‘Remember you’ve got your zoo excursion tomorrow, so don’t stay up too late.’
‘You’ll note,’ she says in that prim, aristocratic voice that all the Malfoy’s pulled off so well, ‘that my letter never specified a time.’
‘Harry,’ says Draco in a carefully controlled voice, his entire body rigid and yet motionless, as if Potter is a wounded animal that will attack at the smallest provocation.
Silence. Malfoy glares at the floor, Potter glares at the ceiling. Aside from the direction of their stares, they’re almost identical in posture. Their shoulders are tense, waiting for the inevitable. They both
He frowns at her. ‘Did you and father start dating in school?’
She smiles nervously, her hands fluttering over her books. ‘Nonsense,’ she says, ducking down to gather up her things. ‘Don’t be silly.’
She licks the foam from her lips, drops the mug to the table and pushes up to her feet. Without thinking, he slides out of the booth to let her pass. Once again that strange mix of peanut butter, toffee and peppermint tea hits him, and he’s momentarily distracted.
Hannah shakes her head and wishes he would stop digging himself into holes. He really wasn’t that bad a guy, he just had a habit of putting his foot in it.
The door to the Hospital Wing swings open and, of course, in walks Malfoy. He stops at the sight of them all there, eyeing them—Ron—warily.
‘So…what then? You
Minerva raises her eyebrows. She hadn’t heard of anything going on with Malfoy, but then apparently neither has Severus.
that gives you the right to try to
He shakes his head again. ‘Get a grip, Harry. These are not reasons to like Draco Malfoy. It’s just some…weird phase of having a conscience.’
about these things?’
Blaise glowers. ‘That’s none of your fucking business.’
followers.’
‘What’s happened?’ he asks, trying and failing to keep the whipcrack edge out of his voice.
He shakes his head and the expression is gone, replaced by a sneer of superiority. ‘You needn’t worry about me, Lovegood,’ he says quietly, pulling his hand away. ‘I’m fine.’
Draco simply throws him an exasperated look.
‘Congratulations are in order, Mr Longbottom,’ Professor McGonagall says, peering over her glasses at him. ‘You may start your extra work in Greenhouse Four in your free periods and in the evenings, but be sure to be back in Gryffindor tower before curfew and stay on top of your homework and assignments.’
His breath stops and he is frozen to the spot. Bellatrix is distracted by the auror’s and hasn’t seen him yet. He has time. Yet he doesn’t move. Conflict swarms through him as he realises he’ll have to choose. He’ll have to choose between either his godson, or the son of the woman he loved.
Ginny steps forward and gives Harry a brief hug. ‘I’m sorry,’ she says in a soft voice.
There’s a vague snort from the other side of the room, and then Theo mutters, ‘I told you not to bother.’
‘Well yeah, but I was only eleven. Well, almost. Oh hey, it’s starting.’
who instigated all the trouble of the morning.
He swallows. ‘Somethings wrong?’
would be a dark day indeed.’
Albus, though, was not.
Draco cuts off and there’s a beat of silence in which the tension in the room increases and then,
. Does he?
‘Fantastic,’ he grunts.
Chapter Thirty-Five
But none of them have what Greg has. When Blaise or Theo or Daphne or Draco want to find out something, they have to go searching for it. They have to be calculated, plan things out, use every situation to their advantage.
There’s another low mumble that she can’t hear, followed by a chuckle that sets her ire burning.
Someone chuckles, a low timbre voice muttering something she can’t hear, and a second person shushes the first. Fury wells up in Myrtle’s chest. Boys. There are
He flushes and ducks his head. ‘Sorry,’ he says, turning to walk back to the house.
‘But I mean…’ Hermione trails off and glances back across the room at Malfoy.
He reaches out to grab at him, but Ron jerks back. Hurt flashes across Harry’s face, and his hand drops back down. A momentary surge of guilt sweeps through Ron, but then Ginny moves to stand next to Harry, crossing her arms and glaring at Ron and blood rushes through his ears.
Draco considers this for a long moment. He rolls over onto the grass, removing a rock from under his hip and tossing it aside.
It’s real conflict that Harry doesn’t like. Oh, he hides it well, but she—who hides from even the slightest hint of friction—can recognise the signs. It’s the way his shoulders always hunch, curling inwards as if trying to make himself smaller whenever someone’s annoyance or disappointment becomes apparent. The way his head droops, ducking away from attention. The way his voice lowers, becoming soft and jaded.
‘Ron, wait—’
Harry sucked in a deep breath and unclenched his fists from his robes, flexing his fingers. His hand brushed passed Malfoy’s with the motion and he glanced sideways. Funny how the last time they were in this room they’d been trying to kill each other. Now…Harry found comfort in the presence of the other boy at his shoulder.
Minerva smiles. ‘Sometimes I forget you were a Slytherin,’ she says, glancing sideways at Poppy.
His eyes fixate on the spot where Bellatrix had stood a moment longer before, finally, he closes his eyes. She sees his fingers shift around his wand as his mouth moves inaudibly, mouthing the numbers as he counts out his breathes.
down there. Her hair Harry’s fingers are sliding through, her neck he’s peppering kisses along, her ears he’s whispering soft words into, her shirt he’s pulling open, a hand slipping down to—
that expression came from.
Potter’s face twitches. The briefest flash of exasperation crossing his features before being swallowed up by the sheer exhaustion still clinging to his body.
get’s Draco’s attention—and not just his.
'You can fix him, right?'
‘No,’ Poppy agrees. She chews on her thumbnail, a nervous habit that Minerva hasn’t seen since the last wizarding war. ‘I’m starting to wonder if we should tell Albus?’
Harry and Ginny both look at her, having obviously forgotten she was standing
‘No,’ says Malfoy, yanking on a cord. ‘It does work. You just have to have the right rune barrier.’
On his feet, he turned to the carnage that was his bed and froze.
‘You have an idea about what’s going on, though?’ asks Zabini.
‘What’ve I done now?’ he asks sullenly.
‘I’m not sure. Apparently a whole bunch of them ended up in the Hospital Wing. Including Potter.’
Theo snorts. He can’t help it. It’s such a dismal attempt at subterfuge that it’s laughable. ‘Right,’ he says.
Albus looks up and smiles genially. ‘Ah, Mr Malfoy. Yes sit down. We need to talk.’
For the twelfth (or was it the thirteenth?) time that afternoon, Bellatrix Lestrange steps from the Hospital Wing storage cupboard. Her hair is as wild as it ever were, tangling around a face that (despite her years in Azkaban) has not seemed to age at all since Poppy last saw her in her last year of school.
girlfriend, and all the while you two have been…have been...’
‘Yeah Zabini, because
‘Because it’s true,’ says Harry, a smugness to his voice. ‘Obviously the plants like me better than you.’
Something shifts in the air as the tension within the Speaker grows into something coiling and angry.
As she nears, she realises that he’s soaking wet, and as he drops onto the edge of his bed, her first order of business is to cast a drying spell.
? Are you joking? Merlin have you and Harry just lost your minds, have you? Forgotten everything that happened in the past? Did that whole business with the diary just slip your mind did it?’
He swallows. He remembers the time Pansy accidentally summoned an entire magazine’s worth of clothes just before her ninth birthday and how she’d spent all week in bed. How frail it had made her—Pansy, so loud and ferocious, constrained to a bed, barely able to lift her own head.
with it? Do you have
‘Oh,’ said Harry, and rubbed the back of his neck, glancing away awkwardly. ‘Sorry.’
‘What? If that little twat didn’t want to get hexed she shouldn’t have tried to change who you are.’
has changed his mind.’
Hannah tries not to watch them, but it’s hard not to. She sighs, and swings her bag up onto her shoulder. As she’s leaving, though, she hears Harry behind her say,
Draco’s gaze narrows. ‘I thought you were going back to the dorms?’
‘Helping each other how?’
Potter sighs.
‘Yeah,’ says Ron, crossing his arms. ‘Seriously.’
‘Ginny!’
Hermione frowns. ‘A Fae curse? What is that?’
. So everything they’re saying now…they mean that?’
Malfoy’s voice barks a spell next to his head, and suddenly Harry can see again, his glasses back in place. He’s pulled out of the way, again by the back of his robes, as one of the Ravenclaw’s launches at them. Malfoy sticks out a foot, tripping the boy and Harry has to admire the quick way he’s back on his feet.
‘Fucking liar,’ snarls Ron, and lifts his wand. ‘Finite incantatem!’
Ron feels dizzy. He sits down hard in his chair, staring up at Harry as everything comes crashing down around him.
‘I...oh. Thanks,’ says Potter, his voice low and guilt-ridden. ‘You can have them back once I find mine.’
She opens her eyes and her jaw drops.
‘Yes.’
Harry can only marvel at him. How is it that even in the freezing cold in the middle of the night, Draco Malfoy can look so…so…well, so like a Malfoy?
shuddering warmth along Draco’s skin. He kisses him once more and rolls over, using Harry as a pillow and staring up at the sky.
‘Hey,’ he grunts, not looking at her as he swings the bat at the approaching bludger.
‘What in the name of magic am I going to do with a pair of glasses with your prescription?’ asks Draco archly. ‘What are you even doing wondering around the castle and breaking into other house dorms without your glasses?’
Severus bursts out into the chaotic street. People shove and push, desperate to flee the bolts of reds, yellows and oranges being flung throughout the street. At the far end of the street Severus sees four people dressed in the familiar black robes of Death Eaters.
For a brief moment, Harry looks like Malfoy.
‘Er,’ he says. ‘I really hope that wasn’t my fault.’
‘That was my favourite book as a kid,’ he says. ‘If I had to pick one, I’d put my money on that being the one by the wizard.’
‘You know, Mum and I used to do this all the time,’ says Draco quietly, holding his mug tightly between two hands.
‘Is this really wise,' he asks in a low voice. 'In his condition?’
Harry chuckles, low and a little sad. He trots over, and lifts the scrubbing brush out of the cauldron. ‘You have already,’ he says, and flicks suds toward Draco. ‘Hence scrubbing cauldrons, remember?’
This time she does hide her grin. ‘I can’t believe you kissed him. What did he do?’
‘I fucking told you,’ Malfoy says, wincing as he pushes himself up from the floor.
Somehow Hermione manages not to throttle him. Of
Neville gulps, almost tripping backwards into the plants.
Poppy raises an eyebrow. ‘Really?’ she asks. ‘You’re not even curious about what happened out there?’
Luna can’t hear what the girl asks, but she sees the way Harry sinks down in his chair somewhat, his eyes downcast as he tries to avoid her gaze.
‘You okay?’
Ginny raises her eyebrows at him. Then she glances towards the work station Lavender and Parvati have set up. She smirks and nudges Harry.
‘I heard she sat by his bed all weekend after that Quidditch accident.’
‘No, sorry,’ says the Pale Boy. ‘You’re right. You’re not here often enough to spoil her.’
‘No kidding.’
‘I think I need another coffee,’ mutters Malfoy, shaking his head.
Harry, now panting against the far wall, the built up magic expelled and absorbed—the wall serving it’s intended purpose just as Poppy had said—looks physically (not to mention emotionally) exhausted. Albus feels a little of his doubt fade away, assured that his confidence in Poppy is not misplaced, and that she indeed has Harry’s situation in hand as he had suspected. Confident more so that his investment in the young Malfoy Heir is the right course of action.
He does anyway. Prat. He steps forward again, leans in, and presses a soft kiss to Draco’s cheek.
He tries to school his expression into something neutral and calm, and yet, he feels his lips twitch. Clearly, five months without practicing his interrogation skills has left his poker face a little rusty.
to take Care of Magical Creatures. Hagrid knows that Harry didn’t mean to offend him. He knows that Harry wants to become an Auror, and that perhaps Magical Creatures don’t rank high on the comings and goings of Aurors. Yet, he can’t stop the disappointment from creeping into his thoughts.
told me to stay away! You said I was making things to hard and why couldn’t I just—
