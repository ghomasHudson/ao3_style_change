Harry just stood there, legs firmly planted, watching, trying to identify a threat, any threat before it could actually become dangerous.
Now, however, in his line of business Draco needed to know about dark magic too: to be able to take down curses he needed to know about the magic that had created them. So that was why he’d gone through all of the books in the Dark Magic section by now. There really was nothing more sinister to it.
His voice sounded serious enough, but his eyes betrayed amusement and it mesmerised Draco, making him take slightly too long to answer: “Only if your Healer can get himself a glass, too.” At least his voice sounded even enough.
“I thought we could have lunch in the canteen again?” Harry started and it only took Draco a brief, hesitant moment to answer.
Because, even though there was a lot of theory on how Auror Training was supposed to work, how it was structured - and Harry had actually read up on all of that - he was also well-aware of the fact that he worked with a team of teachers that he wanted to get to know. How could he be heading an organisation if he didn’t even know all of its employees?
“Yes, I’ve noticed,” Malfoy deadpanned, adding: “I needed to ward it, before I let you come in. It’s a rather vicious piece.”
Then he’d decided on the way he would lay the table and when exactly he was going to do what, so that when Harry came he could give him his full attention.
“Was this Mike Goodall one of the guards that hurt you?” Harry asked and the question startled him too. He hadn’t really meant to ask it, although on the other hand he found he very much had.
Harry knew what Malfoy thought. “Obliviation,” Harry concluded, “that could also be an explanation.”
solve this, you know.” Zabini’s voice came out soft and insistent at the same time, as if he was also trying to convince himself.
“But that would be stupid. He could run, he could plot anything.” Terry again. “What would people say if we’d just let him go now?”
Sitting in the small, Italian restaurant that Harry had taken them to, was slightly awkward at first. They were staring at each other over the table, both apparently lost for words somehow and Draco started to fear that this might have been a mistake, that  it was too official too soon, that Harry didn’t like it.
“Draco what exactly?” Draco was just standing there, eyeing them suspiciously, almost angrily, his jaw clenched and his grey eyes very nearly shooting daggers at them. Zabini, completely unfazed, stepped back from tying the bracelet around Harry’s wrist. He had obviously worked with Draco before.
Harry couldn’t see Zabini’s amused smirk, but he knew it was there when Zabini answered: “I didn’t know you of all people cared very much about that?”
Of course, Harry had sort of expected it to be like this: he had worked enough security as an Auror to know how these things went, but he obviously hadn’t taken the language barrier into account, because, although he had been here the entire evening, he hadn’t been able to understand
They started eating and even though Draco still noticed people staring at the both of them at times, Draco and Harry seemed to be mostly ignored now. It meant lunch was not as bad as Draco’d imagined it would be.
Draco’s nightmares had visibly intensified even further. Harry could see him screaming and the fact Harry couldn’t hear it did nothing to make it more bearable. The pure horror on Draco’s face, the fear, it was all there anyway. It didn’t take an awful lot of imagination to know what it would sound like.
It would end in the sort of thing where Harry would undoubtedly resent his presence without saying so and Draco would feel utterly stupid because of it.
He rose from where he’d just sat himself down before she’d even asked, just shooting his eyebrows up in question.
His flat was completely dark now and he was on his bed that wasn’t really a bed. He knew he should get up and get something to eat, but he couldn’t seem to get himself to do so, feeling his disappointment seep into every part of his body, like a physical ache.
Harry was staring again. At Draco Malfoy. At a ministry ball. It was all strangely familiar, but at the same time completely and utterly different, because this time, when Draco stared back, his smile was bright and genuine.
And that just wouldn’t do. Harry had to be okay. He hated Draco now, Draco had made sure of that, but that really didn’t matter. He had to be okay. He could hate Draco all he wanted, as long as he was able to do so in good health.
“Yes, and he didn’t laugh,” Draco said sullenly. In fact Harry had just seemed genuinely happy Draco had finally been able to cast a Patronus, but perhaps part of Harry’s joy had also come from the really rather remarkable form Draco’s Patronus had taken. Draco couldn’t be sure.
Then he slung his towel over his hips, looked at himself in the now large mirror over the sink for a moment and …, then the door opened.
It had taken them under two minutes to get their stuff from the house, send the Ministry a Patronus to alert them of their find and to pack the Time-Turner into Harry’s satchel that conveniently seemed to have much more space than it should. Then they walked into the grounds around the house, so they could get outside of the wards and apparate out.
“Fuck, it’s -, I promised George and Ron I’d help try some things from the new shipment of stuff that came in today. I should get to the shop. I’m already running late.” He looked startled and sort of guilty at the same time.
Even through the searing pain he could feel Potter’s other hand grabbing him. Then the dizziness that came from Apparating. When the world stopped spinning again and he looked around through eyes that only presented him with a rather hazy view of things, he found himself in a bedroom, presumably in Potter’s house.
“I’m sorry,” Harry offered again, knowing it was completely inadequate, but not knowing what else to say.
And Draco knew Potter’d probably identified the words for the lie they were, but he let go of Draco anyway. “Okay.” His voice was still much too gentle for comfort. Or basically, it wasn’t: it was quite like comfort, which was exactly the problem. “I’ll go,” Harry said, his eyes still lingering for a moment longer.
“Oh, Draco azizam, you’re back.” A woman who was obviously the girl’s mother now stood in the doorway of what most probably was the living room, watching Malfoy from across the hallway. “You didn’t get home yesterday morning and I-.” She sounded worried.
Harry just nodded, quickly taking a look at the menu that had been in front of him the whole time, as he now saw a waiter approaching.
He sagged to the ground frustrated and powerless and even though he had just tried to blow them to pieces twice, Harry still didn’t quite know what to make of him. He looked so young, so vulnerable.
Feel free to drop a comment, if you'd like to. They're read and appreciated (even if I don't always reply. I'm not particularly good at replying, I'm afraid).
“Goodall made a split second decision, hoping that an obliviated Malfoy would be a suspicious Malfoy, what with his history and all. He thought the Aurors would go after Malfoy, at least for a while, leading them off Goodall’s trail.  And, well, thanks to Boot that almost succeeded.” Ron paused for a beat, than added: “Boot is a right piece of shit, mate. I think it’s quite a feat that you’ve put up with him as long as you have.”
“No, not really.” Well, he’d been tired quite a lot over the last two years, since the war basically, but he hardly thought that counted.
, now Draco seemed at his lowest, Harry actually saw him. It hurt Draco more than it had any right to, not after all this time.
So when Friday morning introduced itself, light streaming in through the crack in between Draco’s blackout curtains, Harry was still there, in Draco’s bed, close, Draco’s arm loosely around his waist. And for a moment Draco just savoured the experience, starting to believe that perhaps, just perhaps, this could-.
Corentin nodded again, obviously thinking. Then he set to work, casting numerous  diagnostic spells in quick succession. In a way it looked rather similar to what Draco had done earlier, when they were getting into that damned, fucking house.
If he’d dropped an actual bomb, Malfoy’s face would probably have done something similar to what it was doing now: utter surprise flashing over it, intermingled with something very much resembling hurt.
There had been exactly two things that had worked out today: Harry had finally finished the report on a case that had been solved at least two weeks ago and they had  interviewed the only witness that had actually seen the unregistered Animagus today: of course, when they’d gone there to check, it hadn’t been there anymore.
Lunch had been unquestionably nice, conversation flowing as easily between them as it had in eighth year and Draco had realised he felt completely comfortable, settled in a way he hadn’t for a while now.
When they were in, Draco cast a locking spell that almost flared up with intensity. Then Draco leaned against the wall next to Harry, who was almost completely unable to move now. Draco’s hand was resting warm on Harry’s arm.
Malfoy didn’t seem to think any of it, though. He just shook his head, apparently finding he couldn’t do so without getting dizzy. Harry steadied him, putting his arm around Malfoy’s slim waist. “No, then I obviously wouldn’t have been back here already,” Malfoy answered. Harry felt his grip on Malfoy’s waist tighten a bit. Malfoy really was very unsteady. “Besides you-, I’m-, you’re
“But your shift hasn’t ended yet,” one of his very unwelcome guests said, addressing Harry, sounding completely incredulous. “We checked,” he added.
In a strange way Harry actually understood exactly what Malfoy meant: he himself had chosen this club, because he was sick and tired of being Harry Potter the-boy-who-lived. He just wanted to be Harry, without people having expectations, without people looking up to him, asking for autographs or telling him their own stories. He just wanted to have a good time with his friends, no more no less and it had taken him until today, more than two years after the war, to realise that a Muggle club would in fact be the ideal place to have that. So they’d come here and it had worked.
Draco had put Dittany on his healing wound (which had apparently been why he hadn’t buttoned up his shirt earlier yet) and then they’d had breakfast, eating mostly in silence, but not the awkward type so much. They just both seemed to be lost in their own thoughts.
When Potter walked into Draco’s kitchen late that Sunday morning he was wearing an apologetic expression that didn’t really suit him. “I’m sorry. I think I should have …”
Draco just nodded. “It felt like a good idea at the time,” adding, when Harry didn’t say anything whatsoever anymore: “But perhaps it wasn’t. I mean, it’s probably very inappropriate for
French, but to be fluent at it. So, consequently, Draco had been tutored on the subject ever since he’d been able to hold a quill.
Malfoy looked at Harry again, questioningly arching his eyebrows, but of course there was no way that Harry was going to turn down an offer of tea, even if it came with whatever zulbia was.
with the Dragon Cartel.” The boy spoke in fluent English, pointing an accusatory finger at Zabini. “And they-, I-,” he tilted his head defiantly even though he was still on the ground, “They should be destroyed.” His voice sounded clear now.
Harry smiled, nodding. He certainly understood that too. “So do you know where I can find him?” Harry now asked, getting back to his problem. “Or should I just leave him alone for a while? Give him some space?” Harry’s voice had gone quiet. He didn’t want to leave Draco alone, but if that was what Draco needed … .
“He should be here somewhere. I’ve just seen him dance.” The bartender smiled reassuringly. “Don’t worry. I don’t think he’s left already. If you’d asked me, I would have thought he was looking for you too.”
Francois just considered him for a moment. Glamouring into a pre-set identity for the first time was rather difficult magic.
After the divorce, when Harry had told Hermione what he wanted to spend his spare time on, she had told him to start on this particular room, being curious as to what rare books it might hold, but to Harry it hadn’t really seemed all that enticing, so he’d started on the uppermost bedrooms instead.
Zabini hesitated a beat, then just answered: “He used to.” He didn’t elaborate on it any further, though, asking: “So, how is he?”
“And I’ve just walked the whole damn way here, so you might consider asking me in?” Draco had been trying for pointedly, but his words were rather indistinct.
He decided that would be for another time however, when Harry apparated them both to Grimmauld Place without another word.
“But you do have tea with them?” Harry inquired, once he was over the shock that Malfoy’s statement had apparently caused him.
“So you just exchanged some sort of greeting and left each other alone,” Hermione interpreted easily. “Well, at least you didn’t hex each other,” she said smiling. “I suppose civil is a good start.”
It took two fireballs laced with Draco’s magic to take Mathew and his sodding shield down, but Draco threw a third one just for good measure, vaguely noticing that Dementors apparently weren’t able to kiss anyone while a disgruntled Veela was throwing fireballs in their direction.
When Harry had woken up this morning Malfoy’d been gone. Harry hadn’t been surprised exactly. He himself had never done this sort of thing before, but he’d assumed this was how it worked: you met, did what you wanted to do and then you left each other alone again, because that was what a one-night stand was supposed to be like.
Harry just didn’t know how to respond for a moment. To say that the library in the old Black house had been a mess, was quite the understatement. It had been terrible: a dark, damp, cobwebby place with books strewn everywhere in complete disarray. When Harry had occupied the house after the war, he had walked in there once and then decided that he’d come back to it some other time. Perhaps.
Harry had in fact asked Draco to eat with him and he had asked willingly, without any prompting from Draco’s side beforehand. So why not? Why shouldn’t he go?
When Draco and Harry came out the light was blinding. They were congratulated on their clean result: having been able to extract the witness safely and keep each other unharmed too, without messing things up and attracting all sorts of other problems in the process. Only one other team had ever managed to do so before, but that team had apparently taken slightly longer to get there: making Draco and Harry top of the list in one fell swoop.
At lunchtime Harry came to Draco’s office, which was hardly surprising by now either. At least all of that was absolutely normal.
didn’t feel like staying anymore. “No, in fact, I think I should be going. There’s a briefing I need to attend first thing tomorrow morning.”
“Actually Harry,” Hermione now started as if she had miraculously read his mind. “Draco has changed quite a lot and I meant it when I said that if you can
Draco felt like he had swallowed his own tongue. It had been so long since anyone had asked him something like this.
After the breakfast they’d shared Draco had left for his flat and he hadn’t seen Harry since, but the fact of the matter was that he’d missed Harry. He’d
The burn started to recede almost immediately, his vision unfocussed and fuzzy at the same time. “I-, I-.” Draco heard himself mutter indistinctly before his eyes fluttered shut and he drifted off to sleep once more.
“Should I go?” Harry asked sleepily, after they’d finished what they irrevocably ended up doing on their Saturday nights.
“That was quite the display of power there, Potter.” His voice was worryingly quiet, but his eyes held amusement, a hint of a smirk on his lips. “Do you always go about your job like this?”
The wizard that was left was so surprised, when Draco’s fireball hit him, that he didn’t even put up a fight. He was out straight away.
Which undoubtedly was why Harry and Draco, being as Junior in the division as one could possibly get, had been scheduled to work the case.
“Anytime,” and there was a warmth to Harry’s voice that made that one, almost standard response sound like so much more. “Coming?”
Draco’s voice was clear and loud and Harry knew he must be close, but he found he couldn’t really turn to look anymore.
“It’s just that I promised Luna to dance with her when I got here.” Neville’s voice was still apologetic and when he saw Draco’s frown, he elaborated: “I needed to harvest a batch of Fluxweed before coming here. Full moon today.”
Besides he also felt Harry’s gaze on him and it was so intent he couldn’t ignore it for the life of him. So he didn’t, staring back straight into the green of Harry’s eyes, beautiful, even behind his glasses.
Hermione smiled at him now, for some reason just knowing exactly when he’d be decent. “Glad to help. So,” she went on, a question in her tone, ”what did you think of that club last night? Was it better?”
Harry felt a sudden, unexpected chill that went all the way to his core. No Slytherin friends either, then. “But
That seemed to dissolve Penelope’s hesitation. She nodded. “Okay.” And Draco thought of the obvious trust she and Mathew seemed to have in each other, clearly the result of having worked together for over two years, having each other’s back at all times.
Malfoy was still sporting that smile of his and Harry just smiled back in agreement: after the day he’d had he could most certainly use a drink, celebratory or otherwise.
When Draco woke up it was to Potter sleeping beside him. It was dark and all he could hear, if he listened very carefully, was the sound of Potter’s breathing, calm and even.
Harry shrugged. He had deactivated it in order for Draco to be able to leave his house, but Draco was right: he hadn’t taken it with them. “That thing is supposed to keep you in. At this point I’m more concerned about keeping others out. Besides, we’re going to sleep in one room anyway. I just got us this one room and to be clear: I’m not leaving you tonight. Those thieves will be looking for you.”
And off he went again, into his bedroom this time. Harry didn’t think he’d ever heard Malfoy admit to being tired, not even when he’d clearly looked it.
When they got back to Grimmauld Place Harry found he just had enough food in the house to be able to make them a salad. He decided to owl a few shops for food straight away and then started to make them dinner.
“Do you need my impeccable cutting skills?” Malfoy lounged in the doorway as he asked. He was wearing a pair of jeans that looked about two sizes too wide – making it impossible to spell them to fit - and a shirt of which the sleeves were a fair bit too short, but he still managed to look elegant.
The protective shield Draco put up was absolutely impressive, even by his own standards - deflecting whatever Mathew had cast - but the problem was that it couldn’t protect Harry as well: he was too far off.
Then Harry watched Zabini, who was still fighting off assailant number two, but who didn’t really seem to need any help. Zabini bent backward impossibly low to evade a spell fired his way, while at the same time sending a spell towards his attacker full on.
Terry seemed almost disappointed, as if he had hoped Harry would have regretted his decision by now. Well - Harry thought rather defiantly - even if he had regretted it, Terry would most likely have been the last person to know.
Harry didn’t know whether he actually liked it, his arm still firmly around Draco’s waist, exactly where it had been when he had Apparated them.
When Draco had finished teaching on Tuesday morning, Harry was at the back of his classroom again, but this time it didn’t leave Draco feeling apprehensive. Not at all,  instead it launched a wave of happiness that was completely uncalled for, but that made him smile anyway.
It was one of the reasons Tracing Division had been established after all. Because a house like this one could hold numerous dangers in varying degrees, that only Curse-Breakers and Aurors working together would be able to deal with.
there, flare up. “So,” Harry already knew what he was going to ask, but he couldn’t quite stop himself, “why don’t
“So?” Harry gestured inwards and Draco let him pass, undoubtedly just the right amount of reluctance on his face.
Malfoy regarded him, smiling so slightly Harry would have missed it if he hadn’t been watching intently. “Yes, it is. As much as I’d like to deny it, even sitting here with
“Well, not necessarily, but I thought you might-.” Draco started, not entirely sure what course to take now, whether Harry actually wanted some space or not.
in his eyes, though, and Harry silently reprimanded himself. How could he possibly have forgotten that Zabini was actually a close friend of Malfoy’s.
After that incident everybody involved had been separately heard by McGonagall and that had been the end of it. Smith had stopped hexing, just scowling instead, and Draco had perfected radiating disdain, something he had always been rather good at to begin with.
“Okay, if you like.” Draco just said, a bit reluctantly, almost as if he couldn’t quite believe that Harry had asked him. “There’s food in the kitchen. But, I think
Harry nodded, he usually didn’t like using his fame much, but here, at this moment it came in handy. “Yes, and I’m certainly not here to help the Cartel.”
Harry had had an extensive visit to the Cartel’s secret gardens where there were so many illegal, and rather vicious, plants he was glad he and Draco had got out without being burnt, stung or otherwise incapacitated. Then he had left the Cartel’s grounds, leaving Draco to get to their suite later.
said them. It implied Blaise possessed the sort of unwavering loyalty that Harry understood all too well. “Furthermore he’s actually fun to be around,” Blaise added, his tone more casual, lightening the mood a bit.
rather adamant in taking on this particular assignment and doing it with a team of Juniors, but I didn’t really think anything of it at the time. We worked with Juniors regularly.”
Then, after the screaming, Draco curled in on himself completely, and he started shaking. Again not much imagination needed, even without the sounds coming through the Silencing Charm.
It was something which Draco felt disproportionally grateful for, sprawling out on the bed heavily and toeing off his shoes – no one would be able to accuse him of not having manners - with some difficulty.
For some reason that made Harry tense up a little and all Draco could think was that he didn’t want Harry to do that. “It’s okay, you know,” he mumbled reassuringly into the crook of Harry’s neck, because it was such a comfortable place to position his head and he felt rather heavy all of a sudden.
Playing chess with Potter turned out to be much more fun than Draco had anticipated. The set they used was Muggle unfortunately (Potter told him he got it from Hermione, so Ron could teach him the basics without all the distraction of pieces actually hitting each other), but Potter wasn’t half bad at it and although Draco still won most of the time Potter actually gave him a run for his money a few times. Besides Potter wasn’t a sore loser, laughing at himself whenever he made a stupid mistake.
Harry couldn’t have slept for more than four, perhaps five, hours when he was woken up by an owl that had attacked the window with a vengeance. It was an owl Harry recognised straight away.
“Tonight too?” Harry knew he’d asked too fast, too urgently. It really, really wasn’t his business what Zabini was up to later tonight.
So Harry told him everything that had happened on Friday night, trying to be as detailed as possible: about Draco being there and about Oliver. About how Harry had kept an eye on Draco - having seen that Draco’d been talking to Hermione and Neville - while Harry himself had been on the other end of the table talking to Oliver with some friends.
“Well, you’ll find in this case it does mean,” Draco answered pointedly, asking, in an attempt to steer the conversation to the real issue at hand: “So I understand there is a European Auror exchange?”
For some time, anyway. Until Harry had set eyes on Malfoy, who seemed to be here for the same reason he was. Well, more or less. Harry could at least see how, given his past, Malfoy would also attract some attention in the wizarding world.
Potter kept silent at the back of the room, only coming forward after Draco had concluded. “I promised to get Harris this book on more unusual defence techniques,” Potter said, pointing at the boy sitting in front of Draco, while sort of waving a rather heavy tome around.
Over dinner Harry and Zabini talked some more, about the case, the restaurant they were at - or whatever it was that people called this shithole - and the food which was usually actually quite good. And it was easy, as it had normally been over the last three weeks.
On second thought the powder didn’t appear to be intended to choke him, though, as after a few seconds it seemed to be gone and his breathing became normal again.
Harry noticed first. “Oh Merlin, I really need to go. I should have arrived at the Burrow about half an hour ago.” So he got up, but instead of Floo-ing right out he walked up to Draco. “Thanks again.”
“Here.” The bartender now set their drinks down: plain lager for Harry and for Malfoy a whiskey without any of the rocks that Harry normally associated with the drink. When Harry tried to pay, hoping he had enough Muggle money on him to be able to, the bartended shook her head and smiled. “No, we’re not allowed to charge him anything,” she said, indicating Malfoy with her head, “Claude won’t have it.”
Draco noticed he couldn’t get himself to look away. He had always known Harry was attractive. Even when they had started seeing each other just after the war, when everything had been one big massive mess, including Harry’s relationship with Ginny, and they had taken consolation in each other’s company, usually in Muggle London as a whole and in London clubs in particular.
Potter looked at Draco now. “Do you want to stay for lunch? I’m quite hungry, so I suppose you must be, too?” Draco noticed that even that second sentence seemed to hold some sort of question.
And then the time for visiting hours had rolled around and Harry had left to go to St Mungo’s, to Ron.
Malfoy’s eyes were now intently trained on the object that Harry had put on his desk, but he didn’t touch it, instead spelling it to float towards him and keep hovering there with a single elegant flourish of his wand.
Harry followed his gaze: the clothes Malfoy’d worn the day before in fact lying, neatly folded, on top of the cabinet. Harry hadn’t noticed them.
you infer, you and Luna?” he asked again. His voice managed its usual arrogance, but was quite noticeably laced with real dread now, too.
He turned around, not quite prepared for the bout of dizziness that followed. He steadied himself, though, just enough to keep from falling over, the pain so intense now he felt like giving in. It would be so easy to just let himself fall to his knees, to close his eyes. But he couldn’t, not here, not now, not with Potter watching.
“Well, you don’t have to,” Harry retracted. “You probably have somewhere else to be again today.” Harry didn’t guess as to who Draco could be meeting up with: he was not making that mistake again.
“Well, look at that,” Mathew said matter-of-factly. He must have seen things appear like that a few times before, having been on the job as long as he had. “Are there any more spells protecting it?”
Draco had been faster, though, having Nott bound and gagged again quite effectively. Harry shot a furtive glance in Draco’s direction to ensure that his cushioning charm was actually doing its job, then turned his attention back to the incoming guards. He really wanted to make bloody well damn sure no one was casting anything at Draco now.
to sleep with Draco. No, Harry noticed he really wouldn’t have minded, quite the contrary actually, but he wouldn’t have wanted to do it and
For now he chose to just enjoy his unexpected evening off: lounging on the sofa, going through different channels on the enormous television in their suite and eventually settling on some sort of murder mystery that was already half on its way when he started watching.
Draco decided he could just as well take his time and let himself fall back onto the bed, closing his eyes.
First there was the deep, velvety dark that a Constellation Box usually conjured up, followed quickly by beautifully bright stars.
“Of course. When Ron and Hermione just moved into their house I waited for their bath to arrive for ages.” Draco felt his face mimic the complex array of feelings that swept through him.
It had been difficult enough, though, but through some of Hermione’s (why she hadn’t been surprised when he’d asked for Malfoy’s address was a question for another time) contacts within the Ministry, Harry had got hold of his address the morning after Draco had left in such a hurry.
Everyone turned toward the entrance that the man had come from. Harry watched Draco, who, almost smugly, proceeded to put out his fire and shrink the log.
Draco suddenly found he couldn’t ignore it any longer. The pain that had been a low, burning hum in his shoulder blades most of the afternoon had fired up again, apparently meaning business this time.
Working with Lisa Turpin had been as much of a pleasure as the day before and although Harry still very much looked forward to being with Ron again on Monday, working with Lisa was remarkably easy too.
When he came out of the bathroom he was dressed in a pair of Potter’s black jeans which he’d had to shrink slightly to make them fit and a white shirt that had a rather new feel to it: now he was out of Hogwarts Potter probably didn’t wear an awful lot of shirts anymore.
Perhaps Slytherins were taught that in secret classes too, just like French, Harry mused slightly resentfully.
Malfoy frowned, like he thought that was a rather preposterous idea, but there was an almost apologetic quality to his gaze too. “No, we don’t,” he answered, the sudden coldness to his words contradicting the way he’d looked just a moment ago.
One-night stands probably best weren’t brought up at work and Malfoy most definitely gave Harry the impression that he didn’t talk about them at all, not even outside of work. So Harry didn’t broach the subject either.
Zabini had averted his eyes and his voice was sort of soft when he finally spoke up: “I don’t think he would hex you, not anymore.” Then he looked at Harry and this time he did smile, amusedly so. “I think he would presumably just ignore you completely for some time, though.”
“Technically, yes,” Harry said, turning and putting the first plate of breakfast - or lunch or whatever it was - down where he knew Malfoy would be sitting, then proceeding to get his own plate of food.
Draco should count himself lucky it had lasted as long as it had, really, that Astoria had been willing to be with him this long.
It was Hermione who voiced his concerns: “I think Harry should stay with Draco until everything’s been solved, until he’s completely out of danger.” She gave both Harry and Draco a look Harry didn’t quite get. “And I think it’s probably best if I went with you,” she then told Ron. “So I can explain that this actually
“Ah, we’re painfully obvious, don’t you think?” Draco had evidently seen the same thing Harry had and Harry pulled back a bit, wanting to see Draco’s reaction, worrying about what he might think all of a sudden.
Instead of Apparating, Harry and Draco walked to the gardens: “They’re heavily warded so you can’t just Apparate in. Besides, I like walking
“Well, nothing serious here,” she then proceeded to say, casting spells on the cuts and bruises he’d sustained throughout the fight. “You’ll be right as rain again.”
“You’d almost think you like going back to that stuck-up little shit.” It came out indignant, angry: Terry’s voice laced with venom. And that was when something inside of Harry snapped, he felt it give way almost physically.
had never been serious, just a bit of fun, a way to try whether he actually liked boys that way. To him Draco had been a friend (or something along those lines at least) with benefits, nothing more.
Harry saw that Malfoy was animatedly talking to Zabini and Harry was struck by how much more Malfoy’s face could apparently do than scowl and smirk when he was talking to someone he knew and liked. It almost took Harry by surprise.
to be there. This Malfoy, night-time Malfoy, the soft, gentle one, the one that seemed to understand him in a way not many other people did.
And, as Zabini had told Harry that first night, the mostly young crowd that frequented this club seemed to like this Malfoy, the graceful, talkative, but still rather sharp-edged one. And, of course, there were his looks: people undoubtedly liked those too, because, well, Malfoy was extremely easy on the eye. Harry could admit to that much now.
“You’ve become better at this.” Malfoy purred, low and so utterly tempting that Harry didn’t stand a chance even if he’d wanted to. Which he didn’t.
He wanted to say ‘yes’, every part of him did, but then he started thinking. He’d been with Harry all day and as much as he’d liked that, he realised once again that he shouldn’t get used to it, that it wasn’t normal.
“No,” she gave him a look that seemed almost like concern. “No, you don’t have to. I would like to stay the night, though. You know, if that is possible. Molly and Arthur’ll have Rose for tonight.” She said it quietly, as if she didn’t know if it was going to be allowed.
So he thought of the one thing that might bring some consolation and summoned himself a bottle of Ogden’s finest - if he was going to get absolutely sloshed, he was at least going to do so on the good stuff – taking a swig straight from the bottle. There really was no need to heed any kind of etiquette now.
Harry sounded annoyed, Draco registered. It obviously was as Draco’d thought: “And you don’t want that,” Draco concluded. There was a sudden chill to Draco’s voice that made its way all through his body again. Harry didn’t want this. Of course he didn’t. Draco had known, he had known … .
Harry put a tentative hand on his shoulder. “We really are going to do everything we can to make them pay,” he said with feeling.
actually found a lot of physical consolation in various clubs wherever he happened to be working over the past year, but he didn’t think that was altogether strange. He’d seen enough people do the same and they certainly couldn’t all have been Veela.
do. Furthermore, I don’t-, we’re not-.” He absently ran a hand through his already mussed up hair, looking tired, even though he’d just been sleeping. “I have to go.”
Somehow something seemed to have irrevocably changed between them since yesterday, since the Sunday morning they had shared, and Draco knew they’d both felt it. It was almost like there was an invisible force around them when they talked, an energy, sparking and sizzling, that was there even though they both tried to ignore it.
“You could stay here. I have a spare room, that you’re quite familiar with already.” Harry’s tone just held humour, no sting.
That night the club was even busier than when Harry had been here to interrogate Malfoy. Zabini himself was working the bar and Harry felt indignation tug at him. Why have Malfoy come in if Zabini could do it himself? It was something Malfoy obviously noticed: “On Friday nights we always work the bar in twos. It’s almost impossible to do it on your own. Next to that Blaise doesn’t usually do any bartending, he prefers not to and I suppose that’s actually for the best most of the time.” He cocked his head, smiling slightly. “Although he seems to be doing a rather good job at the moment.”
Then Harry looked around, trying to find Draco, who quite notably wasn’t in the room with the other Healer, anymore.
Malfoy’s voice sounded as condescending as ever, but it also had a playfulness to it that was completely unexpected and Harry watched him in surprise for a moment. Then Harry just smiled at him, the sort of genuine smile he normally reserved for his friends, for people close to him. “Yeah, who’d have thought,” he said, almost conspiratorially bumping Malfoy’s shoulder. For an instant Malfoy froze, watching him, then gave Harry a smile too, an openly visible one this time. Harry didn’t think he’d ever seen this particular kind of smile on Malfoy before. It seemed real, almost, well, vulnerable. Harry found he liked it.
The waterfall was exactly as Harry had imagined it to be: very cold and wet, but when he looked back at Draco he saw it was much more than that: Draco had stopped being Francois and when Harry looked down at himself he saw his hands were not Kendrick’s anymore either, but his own.
a question.” Draco barely left out the ‘Well done, Potter,’ continuing: “And I wouldn’t mind, no,” because, of course, he was like that. Where Harry was concerned he always seemed to take the path that lead to certain death.
So Draco nodded, brushing aside the part of him that was sensible, that was telling him not to go there again. “If you don’t mind.”
Besides, the end to his marriage had also meant that he could finally get to experience what it was like to be with a man, but for some reason he hadn’t quite gotten around to doing that just yet.
Penelope sighed. “Yes quite, there were so many loose threads, so many things that didn’t sit right after … . And we needed to follow up on all of them, to find out whether he had done anything like this before.” She was silent for a moment, then added, more quietly: “I should never have left you to deal with those wards on your own.” She was clearly addressing Draco now.
“Yes, I am.” Even this very short sentence came out decidedly slurring and for some reason it made Draco feel quite uncomfortable again, like this was going to be one of those situations he might really come to regret in the morning.
“Why not?” Harry countered, Gryffindor courage in place, emboldened by the hint of hesitancy he just saw.
“A Knut for your thoughts,” Harry said, bumping his shoulder to Draco’s gently. They were walking to their Apparition Point now, the sun low, the breeze soft and Draco just watched Harry for a moment. Harry looked right back.
Draco decided that wasn’t going to happen twice, so he moved, effortlessly, almost  languidly, but instead of raising his hands over his head, this time he placed them on Potter’s hips, slowly, slightly hesitantly.
Draco wanted more of that. “You mean you read all the ones on Quidditch and you lent a few others to Hermione.” He said with a half-smile, half-smirk.
It was when Harry just simply started kissing him again, ardently wanting, and Draco returned the kiss with equal fervour, desperately needing Harry to know just how much he meant to him.
Hermione smiled. She probably knew he was changing the subject on purpose, but let him anyway. “Yeah, of course.” Then she turned to leave the room. “See you there,” waving her hand at him in a quick goodbye.
This time it took at least a full five minutes for the pain to fade to a manageable level again, but it didn’t completely subside anymore.
“But I’m truly sorry to hear that she has passed,” Harry now continued, meaning every word, because for everything else the Malfoys had done, Narcissa Malfoy had also purposefully saved him. “What happened?”
“Thank you.” She still didn’t quite look him in the eye and Harry supposed it probably had something to do with his name again. Sometimes that really was quite annoying.
Draco couldn’t help but look: Harry was lying on his side next to him, still fast asleep, one arm comfortably over Draco’s shoulders and Draco’s arm over Harry’s waist. It was the way they often slept and it had become something Draco cherished, like so, so many other things. Being with Harry had been the best thing he’d ever allowed himself.
Next to Draco Harry stifled a yawn and that snapped Draco out of his thoughts. “You should get some sleep. It’s been a long day and tomorrow we’ll have an early start.” Draco’s voice seemed to be drenched in a warmth that he most certainly hadn’t added intentionally.
Harry just watched him, trying to ignore his gut screaming he shouldn’t let Draco do it, he shouldn’t let him leave, not now, not to
Okay. Right. Perhaps that might have been a slight problem. Zabini obviously didn’t put it past Harry to have declined this assignment purely on the basis of having to work with Draco on all of it and frankly Harry didn’t quite put it past himself either.
“You took your bloody time waking up,” Draco managed to say, obviously without any bite. He got closer to the bed, relief seeping through every bone, every muscle in his body, only now releasing all of the tension it’d apparently been holding, the burn that he’d felt in his back for a while now becoming more pronounced.
Then Harry finally turned around to watch Draco, who pointedly didn’t look back, taking in the whole room except for the space where Harry was standing.
“Do you know who actually worked with their curse breakers to get your Wards to yield?” Ron sounded so indignant that Harry suddenly doubted he had noticed their state of undress at all.
Malfoy watched him, grey eyes still full of emotion. He shook his head almost imperceptibly: “No, I-. It really is very valuable. You should keep it.”
“Fuck no, although it could be interesting to see what their reaction would be.” Malfoy smiled again, not quite the smile from before, but real enough. Harry couldn’t help but smile back at him: neither of them needed a lot of imagination to be able to predict the reaction of Harry’s friends.
He couldn’t even finish his sentence, though, because Draco cut him off: “Well, you two seem to get along just fine. Much better than just friends, I‘d say.” He would never dream of holding Astoria the way Potter had held Ginny Weasley this evening. “Are you sure you’re divorced, because you still looked very much the couple to me.”
Zabini pointed out a space somewhere at the other end of the clearing they were standing in. There was nothing there, but Harry knew if this really
It seemed to ease some tension because after a brief look of surprise Potter smiled openly and genuinely, like Draco had seen him do that night of their drunken encounter. It was entirely too nice. “So you could actually tell I hadn’t worn the damn thing yet?” Potter asked.
And Draco instantly knew who it was, as he felt his unease melt away almost immediately. So he summoned his bathrobe without thinking twice and went to answer the door.
“Just a speck of dust,” Harry said next, “I brushed it off.” But Harry’s gaze lingered. “Will I still see you sometime?” Harry then asked. His voice was soft, the green of his eyes vibrant and warm even behind his glasses and Draco noticed he wanted to keep looking.
“Yes, I do. I just-.” Draco couldn’t get himself to finish that sentence. What could he say: ‘I just can’t believe you would want to do this for me, with me.’ That would come too close to the hurt, to the fear Harry was going to come to his senses and tell him it had been a mistake and they weren’t going to see each other again.
He knew Potter was not together with the Weaselette anymore, that had made all the newspapers just after the trials, but well, they’d still been dancing together at the Muggle club, looking very much like a couple, so perhaps there was something there still. It wouldn’t be the first time the newspapers got it all wrong.
It seemed Harry had something else on his mind though. “You know I was married to Ginny for going on nine years,” Harry eventually started, completely out of the blue, and Draco clenched his jaw, not really knowing what to expect next. “And, well, I’d like to know: how’s, you know,
Quite contrary to common belief, it hadn’t been a particularly lucky horseshoe, though, and Draco had quickly identified why. It had been drenched in dark curses, which Draco had meticulously taken off, reducing the horseshoe to its original form: a teaspoon.
“Oh yes, thank you Professor,” Anthony Harris’ face lit up: he was extremely clever, definitely the Granger of this particular group, and it made perfect sense he would be interested in a book like that. “But I thought you said I would be getting it in Defence class next week.”
Then he handed Harry’s short letter back, looking at him with disturbingly beautiful, soft grey eyes. “So, yes,” he repeated with emphasis.
“Yes, that’s exactly what I’m worried about,” Draco muttered. He didn’t seem at all convinced that Harry was okay, so Harry turned towards him completely, stepping in slightly closer and for a moment they just watched each other, Draco’s eyes intent. Harry almost felt the air vibrate around them as he was struck, again, by how beautiful Draco actually looked.
They seemed to be in the large building Harry had seen on the other end of the grounds now, at least that’s what Harry thought judging by what he could make out through the largely glass doors he was currently staring at.
Harry smiled to himself. Draco was good at this, really good. After Hermione had put in a good word - well, quite a lot of good words actually - Draco had been accepted to train under the Head Potioneer at St Mungo’s, only to wind up in the position of First Assistant within an astounding ten months, which meant he usually only brewed the more intricate potions now, the ones the other assistants were not allowed to make, the ones that sometimes needed a whole week to brew so that Draco had to come in on his Saturday off and stir.
“I, erm, I’ve made dinner and I thought you could, er-” Harry started, he had obviously decided he wasn’t going to let Draco’s silence keep him from saying what he wanted to say: “Have you already had dinner?”
Thoughts of how Draco was going to be entirely gone from Harry’s life later today. And of how much Harry resented that.
“Draco,” Harry said urgently, but, as Corentin had indicated, Draco didn’t react anymore. That part of the curse had indeed been lifted.
Harry answered her. “They tried to kill him. If he hadn’t been able to send that Patronus, I certainly wouldn’t have found him in time. It’s-“ Harry swallowed thickly, “It’s what they’d been counting on.”
It made Harry snort a laugh and Draco felt an involuntary jolt of joy, like he always did when he made Harry laugh.
Potter seemed to actually have put some effort into the way he looked for the evening: his hair was sort of presentable, at least it didn’t seem half as messy as usual and he wore nicely pressed dress robes in a shade of dark grey that clearly set off his green eyes. Yes, he was undeniably handsome.
“No, no, of course not now.” The words fell out of Harry’s mouth, before he’d thought them over. “You wouldn’t, you know, with me … . That would be ridiculous.”
Draco looked away. “Oh.” He paused, then added: “She shouldn’t have. Prison, well, it’s not supposed to be nice, is it?”
He didn’t finish his sentence, but he obviously didn’t have to and Harry couldn’t help but smile, broadly, before taking the plate that Malfoy had given him. “Thanks.”
And then his memory came leaking back to him, not all of it, but enough to feel utterly embarrassed all the same.
“Draco’s only just left,” ‘Harry’s‘ Healer said, smiling at him a little as if she knew exactly why Harry was looking for him.
Harry considered him for a moment and Draco feared Harry had seen right through him. That didn’t seem to be the case after all, though, because Harry only said: “You know you don’t need painters to do the painting. You just need to know the right spells.” There was amusement in his eyes.
Harry interlaced their fingers like he had a few nights prior and it felt as natural as it had with Ginny.
Harry looked at the clock again. It was still about an hour before he had been here long enough to be able to excuse himself - because he would have to work tomorrow, which was annoyingly true - and slip out. He’d been here more than two hours already and he’d wrestled through every slow second of it. It was just as awful as he’d imagined it would be.
“Yes,” he wasn’t going to tell her that strictly speaking he’d been off for a few hours already, “but if you would like me to stay, I can,” he heard himself say.
He made it into the room, carelessly shrugging his robes off and nearly missing the sofa trying to hang them over its armrest.
Now Draco had fallen asleep again the Healer addressed Harry: “I’m afraid I won’t be able to cast when you’re on the bed.” He said it almost apologetically.
When Harry had opened his mouth, however, he caught Draco’s gaze, seeing him shake his head almost imperceptibly. Harry closed his mouth again, warily looking on instead.
Then he seemed to shake himself out of it, however, saying: “You should let Draco sleep now. He needs to rest properly.”
Draco sat up on the sofa slowly, trying to hear whether the rest of the house was still silent, whether Harry would still be in bed. It would be so much easier for the both of them if Draco left before Harry would see him.
Harry had been with Malfoy for three weeks now and it hadn’t been half as awful as he had expected it to be. Okay, granted, most events that required Malfoy’s presence were rather daunting and just as uneventful as Harry had thought they’d be.
“Yes, it is.” Malfoy looked uncomfortable all of a sudden. “Just don’t tell anyone.” There was a pleading note to his voice. “It’s just, well, the Ministry doesn’t actually know we own this cottage. This house didn’t show up on any of the lists of our possessions, because it’s hidden to most.”
“Seriously?” Draco noticed he felt both annoyed and like laughing. His wall was mostly blue now, but his floor had been painted an enormous blob of the same colour too. “Some spell this is.”
“Ready?” Draco asked Harry, so close now he could, and did, take Harry’s hand in his. Harry nodded. He was nervous too. Not because he was going to be seen with Draco, though. He’d had enough rubbish written about him in the papers not to give any fucks, flying or otherwise, about that whatsoever.
Being an Auror Harry was used to battling with others at his side, but they were usually people whom he had trained or at least worked with for longer periods of time. Draco obviously didn’t fall into either of these categories, but Harry was struck by how easily they worked together anyway.
When Harry broke it, Draco’s hand had possessively landed om his neck. “I really need to go,” Harry’s voice was so warm, “but I would very much like to do this again.”
The two of them had mostly been to different places in Belgium and Holland and all these events seemed to be just as terrible, the only difference being that Malfoy apparently didn’t speak any Dutch, which meant they actually conversed in English in the Dutch speaking areas, meaning Harry could understand every boring detail he heard. Which was definitely not always an advantage.
“Don’t you want to go, too?” Draco asked Harry, once he’d sat down on the grass next to him, close enough to catch a whiff of Harry’s scent: warm and woodsy and by now comfortably familiar.
“Did you actually go? You know, to that club Blaise recommended?” It was later that evening and Hermione had caught Harry unawares. Dean, Seamus, Neville and Ginny had been caught up in a heated discussion about refereeing in Quidditch that Harry had not had the energy to follow. And apparently Hermione had seen that as her cue.
“No problem,” Harry answered straight away. “You must have been really busy sorting this whole Mathew Dean thing out.”
Blaise contemplated Harry’s story for a long time, asking some more questions that Harry answered as honestly as possible.
“But that doesn’t necessarily mean -,” Potter started, stopping short again when he saw Draco raise one eyebrow.
And he’d thought Draco had known that, that he’d understood, because Harry had been absolutely clear about it all throughout their time together, he’d said. Which might be true: perhaps Draco
Draco seemed to consider him for a beat, then went for the broom and mounted it in one sure movement, taking off without hesitation. The space they were in was high enough for him to hover without being seen immediately. Good.
Draco’s words had gotten increasingly difficult to understand, quite clearly invalidating what he was saying, but he watched Harry a beat longer, holding his gaze, before succumbing to whatever the curse was doing to him again.
Mathew and Harry did a very thorough sweep of the house and the grounds surrounding it and Draco now knew first-hand how utterly tedious it was to have nothing to do but wait. He and Penelope had had to stop dismantling the wards until the all clear would be given, but that meant waiting for the Aurors to do their jobs.
And then it hit Harry that he didn’t know what Blaise had meant, when he’d said Harry had to be patient. Should he wait here, in the hallway in front of Draco’s flat, or was the waiting more like something he should do in the long run, hoping that Draco would come to him at some point, when he was ready?
So Draco laid the table and they ate. And talked, mostly about topics that were safe, like Quidditch and their jobs.
Then Malfoy got up, levitating the black, wooden box from a shelf behind him to his desk. “But I hardly think you’re here to talk about my lunchtime habits, so let’s have a look at this here.” Malfoy paused, just a moment, then continued: “It’s a Constellation Box.” He smiled a little at Harry’s undoubtedly confused face. “And you probably don’t know what that is. Well, I can assure you: most people don’t. As I mentioned, these boxes are exceedingly rare.”
Harry nodded slowly. He didn’t say anything else, though, just eyeing Draco with the kind of soft gaze that Draco would never ever get enough of.
Draco spun around with all the energy he could still muster, finding Potter right behind him now. “I. am. not. drunk.” He made an effort to emphasise every word. Of course the git would instantly assume he was pissed.
“Fuck, Malfoy, you’re bleeding. Why didn’t you Apparate straight to St Mungo’s?” Well, for the simple reason that Draco hadn’t been able to. Not yet. The day after tomorrow that would all have been different.
The Stunner that Harry had been hit with wasn’t too much out of the ordinary: next to stunning a person, it seemed to be meant to drain energy, but this was something Draco knew how to reverse.
Malfoy considered him for a brief moment, before answering, rather slowly: “Yeees, that’s what bodyguards usually do.” Here Harry wanted to object, but Malfoy didn’t let him: “And before you mention it: yes, I know you’re supposed to do your other job while being my bodyguard, but you will actually have to accompany me
?” There were so many things that started to click into place now. How Draco wouldn’t have been able to Apparate for one. He couldn’t have gone to St Mungo’s even if he’d wanted to the day before yesterday, when he’d been cursed, when he’d ended up on Harry’s doorstep. He’d certainly been in no shape to walk all the way.
“Yes,” Draco was still panting, but slower now. “Yes, I know. I just … . I was having a rather disagreeable dream.”
He was quite sure that whatever Harry had wanted from him today, this ridiculous loss of control wasn’t it.
Malfoy glared, almost as if Harry had offended him somehow, but then his face evened out again and he answered: “Shirin? Yes, and usually also the day before a test. Quizzing her and all that. You know, just to be sure.” Here he paused a beat, then adding: “As far as I know she won’t be having a test this week, though.”
Malfoy turned his head to watch him, lazily tucking a stray strand of hair away as he did so. His hair was longer than when Harry had last seen him. It suited him. “What are you going to say to your friends?” he asked. He seemed genuinely curious, his voice somewhere between a drawl and a slur. “Hey, I was just outside sitting with Malfoy for a while?”
It took all of Draco’s willpower to follow without making a sound, the burn in his back still unrelenting.
Draco let the warmth course through him until he could feel it rising, his skin hot with it. Then he just got up and dropped his shield.
“So, let me get this right,” Blaise summarised when visiting Draco the following Saturday evening. “You’ve actually been chatting Potter up last Saturday night?”
When he got there, Harry knocked softly and this time the door opened to him straight away: no awkward waiting outside.
“Draco!” Harry yelled yet again, his volume having increased every time he’d called Draco’s name by now. “Draco, are you okay?” He was loudly knocking on Draco’s front door at the same time, just to be sure.
She didn’t say anything about what he looked like, though, knowing him too well for that too, but Draco realised he probably didn’t look too good. By lack of a kitchen and time he hadn’t had a proper meal for ages and because he hadn’t expected company today he hadn’t even bothered about his hair or anything else much, either. He had a small mirror in his bathroom, due to the previous owner of his flat, but he had successfully avoided looking into it today, because, well, what would have been the point anyway?
Draco and Harry had been a couple for over fourteen months now, and although, of course, not all of Harry’s friends had been thrilled about their relationship, Draco had been surprised by how many of them hadn’t really batted an eye.
Harry could see Draco’s point, although it really didn’t sit well with him. Not at all. Draco still looked too pale, unsteady, tired. “Then at least bring me in. You know, introduce me. Today.”
When Malfoy came back later that day, he acted slightly less conceitedly, just very quiet and Harry found he didn’t like that any better.
So Harry took Malfoy’s arm, only realising as he did it that he hadn’t even hesitated, that he had trusted Malfoy to actually take him to his house - and nowhere else - without question.
It took Harry a lot of effort not to show how he felt about that, just asking: “So, that’s no problem here? Falling for blokes?” His voice still sounded smaller than he had wanted it to.
The same way Harry got jealous of Ron and Hermione sometimes, at how their relationship was completely natural to them: at how they just seemed to fit.
Furthermore they’d been busy: in the morning they had been training - Draco in offence and defence and Harry in curse-breaking - exactly like they were supposed to every morning for the next three months. Just like they would be working a case every afternoon for the next three months.
Besides Draco was really good at chess, probably not as good as Ron, but really good all the same. And Harry wasn’t, he’d gotten better, yes, but he wasn’t that good.
“We’re not saying you did. It’s just-, one of the perps was seen running into you, literally. So, we thought you might know …” Harry had wanted to finish his sentence, but something made him stop.
So Harry took a leisurely shower, which actually turned out to be much too leisurely, because all of a sudden it was later than he’d thought, making him have to dress quickly.
“So how would you go about dismantling this construction?” Penelope asked. She’d apparently come down too and was watching the objects with the rest of them.
So Draco tried to step back, but Harry just shook his head, very briefly, and pulled him in slightly tighter, saying’: ”It’s okay.” His voice was soft, sounding like he actually meant it. “It’s okay,” Harry repeated, still not letting go.
“Yeah, of course you are.” Harry couldn’t help but smile back, not bothering to be riled up by Draco Malfoy any longer. “I wouldn’t have expected you to be, though.”
“Yeah, it was good,” Harry said, recognising that short, simple answers tended to be the best way of dealing with Blaise when he was like this.
Later that evening they were still on their beds, neither of them inclined to move. Draco had effectively confiscated the remote control for the television – ‘Potter, you wouldn’t even know how to use it’, which was quite unfair because Harry had lived in a Muggle household – zapping through a few channels before landing on a film with pirates and lots of elegant costumes. It probably figured that Draco would actually like that kind of thing.
Normally Harry would have commented on the rather Slytherin colouring, but now he resisted the urge, because, whatever Zabini had thought, this would undoubtedly be the moment that Malfoy was going to hex him.
Harry seemed to take that as some kind of consent, his fingers travelling to Draco’s cheek softly, but with a strange sense of urgency, his hand eventually ending up cupping Draco’s jaw. His eyes had been holding Draco’s captive all the time, neither of them able to let go.
That one hit home and Harry saw, with no small amount of satisfaction, that one of the hit-wizards froze, the one by his side shooting a nasty
Harry’s gaze had shifted to the floor, his anger mixed with guilt now. He should have asked about what‘d happened to Draco, what the conditions of his not going to Azkaban would be. He should have known-.
This time he felt them coming - although surprisingly it still didn’t hurt - his wings unfolding from his back where Harry had just touched him as if that was completely normal.
Malfoy’s fingers, however, obviously weren’t Ginny’s: they were long and warm, but Harry found they were just as comforting. And for some reason Malfoy didn’t pull back.
“ … not due back for hours. This one will have bled out by then.” Harry was close enough to hear and see them now, illuminated by the light of just three candles. There were four people. Four. And Draco had been alone, not aware anyone would come after him.
“Yes, that’s quite true. Our subjects are actually interrelated quite a bit,” Potter agreed easily. Draco had expected this meeting with Potter to be one of his more disagreeable ones, to say the least, but it hadn’t been. They’d astonishingly found their views on teaching were quite similar. And that they could actually talk about those at great length without it getting tedious. As a result of which this whole encounter had been stunningly pleasant.
“So what about you? I would have thought you and your wife would have had at least three children by now.” Draco purposely steered away from using Ginny Weasley’s name. For some reason he still couldn’t say it.
So Draco proceeded to get up with Blaise and walked him out, taking his bracelet from him and getting his own robes while he was at the door, putting them on straight after Blaise had left.
So he decided to ask, not quite managing to keep the indignation out of his voice: “Why hide it from me in the first place?”
This time Harry woke up when Draco got out of bed somewhere throughout the night. It was still early, but Harry saw the soft beginnings of morning already filtering through his curtains.
“But I told you: I’ve been there. He won’t let me in,” Harry said, sounding every bit as frustrated as he felt.
He extricated himself, stepping back, wanting to say something, anything, to get away from this. But Harry got his voice to work first, though.
In the end Harry had not been able to drag himself to their suite, to bed, instead trying to get some sleep on the chair in Draco’s room and not being particularly successful at it.
It was the sort of smile Harry hadn’t expected to be seeing on him at all, not ever. And it made him look even better.
He went to the front door quickly. The Fidelius Charm wasn’t on his house anymore - hadn’t been since the end of the war - but he still obviously had Wards in place: the normal ones and some more complex ones that would usually take someone a long time to break.
Malfoy looked bemused for a very short moment, then seemed to stand up even straighter than he normally did. “Well, of course, why didn’t I think of that? Why don’t I just Floo out?” His every word was dripping with sarcasm and if Harry hadn’t looked any closer he would have thought the Malfoy he’d known in school had finally returned.
It was only then that Draco dared look at Harry again, finding a velvety warmth to Harry’s green gaze that seemed to ease the cold immediately. “Yes, just trying not to be offended at you discussing me, and my spectacular Veela humps, behind my back,” Draco said much more honestly than had been his intention. Well, at least his voice had sounded indifferent enough.
Draco gave him a quick, rather surprised look, that Harry didn’t quite know what to make of. Then Draco composed himself. “What do you presume the Cartel will think if there was a break-in in one of their research facilities and then the next day one of their potion’s masters doesn’t turn up? Doesn’t much sound like a coincidence, now does it? And
scarred.” That made Harry look up at him again, making Draco’s silvery gaze shift away instead. “It would have been justice. A reminder,” Draco attempted to explain.
“Fair enough,” Draco conceded with a smile that was probably too warm. It was nice to be talking to Harry again.
It was like he was giving in completely, to the music, the beat, the here. And it was absolutely enthralling.
When Harry knocked on the door, the silence that followed stretched for the longest of moments, so he knocked again, vaguely noting that he probably should have sent a memo before coming. Again there was no answer for the longest of times and Harry had all but decided to leave, to come back another time, when the door opened.
He had learnt how to make breakfast quite some time ago now, had known ever since he’d started living on his own, but he’d never had as much practice as he’d had over the past year. His year with Harry.
Even though Draco hadn’t finished his question, forgoing everything he’d once been taught, Harry seemed to know what he’d meant, answering: “Luna said you can go home tomorrow.” Harry kept watching Draco as if he wanted to say something else, which this time he eventually did. “I could come and pick you up.” His voice sounded hopeful somehow.
Draco frowned for the slightest moment as if he didn’t quite believe what Harry was saying. Then said: “Yes. Standing’s not-. I can’t really-.”
When Kreacher plopped into the room to announce dinner, they were on the floor, Draco’s cushioning charm in place, so it wasn’t too uncomfortable and a throw over their bodies that Harry’d summoned some time back.
Draco felt himself flush. Violently. And he was extremely happy there was no one else here to witness it.
When, in leaving, Draco fleetingly looked over at Potter’s side of the table again, Potter was smiling broadly at Wood, leaving Draco to feel utterly stupid: Potter wouldn’t even realise Draco had left.
“I don’t know about you, but I’ve had a hell of a week and I’m going to have a glass of whiskey,” Harry stated, when Draco had magically washed up their things after their curry dinner, joining Harry on his sofa. “Do you think my Healer would agree?”
Just a flicker of uncertainty, until Draco’s face evened out in cool indifference. “I don’t think we should ever mention that again.”
When they finally let go, coming up for air, Malfoy’s breathing had sped up considerably. Which in turn was completely enticing: knowing that Harry had the power to do that to someone as in control as Malfoy usually was. Harry wanted to do it again, possibly multiple times.
Then David started talking properly, about his sister Alice who had got involved with a man when living in France and about how this man had got her addicted to the pills the Dragon Cartel made and how, when she had finally decided to try and stop and get out of the relationship, she had owled her brother. She hadn’t made it to their meeting point, though, so her brother had gone to the coordinates she had provided in case anything went wrong. It had got him outside what he thought could be the Cartel’s headquarters.
It had taken them quite some time to finally let go of each other again, kissing, touching and holding each other like they’d both been starving.
And Malfoy let him, swaying a bit, even with Harry’s arm still firmly wrapped around his waist. Fortunately Malfoy didn’t comment on that: probably quite accurately having decided that talking was not a particularly good idea just now.
So what had Malfoy actually thought: that Harry would tell this girl Malfoy was a suspect? That Harry had to guard him? Harry tended to be honest, but he definitely made exceptions when needed.
Before Draco knew it they’d started eating in an easy, comfortable silence and it was all so homey, it made Draco ache.
“As such, you will be assigned to be a bodyguard to Draco Malfoy who is currently residing in Brussels.” Robards probably saw Harry’s reaction, because he added: “And, yes, I know the two of you were hardly friends in school, but I trust in your capability for professionalism.”
Zabini just nodded: “Her cottage still needs a lot of work.” Then he suddenly shut his mouth as if now he’d really said something he shouldn’t have.
Draco got up off the bed, feeling slightly guilty for Harry being there. Draco was perfectly fine, could easily have gotten home on his own, but it was nice to have Harry here all the same.
“Yes, I know where it is.” Malfoy’s voice sounded impatient, emphasising his arrogance even more. “And before you ask: I didn’t do it.”
Harry nodded. He knew exactly how devastating nightmares could be, having had his fair share of them after the war.
Harry was wearing the comfortable outfit he had been sporting last Friday and Draco couldn’t help but watch the way Harry’s tatty T-shirt clung to his biceps, nicely defining them.
“Astoria.” Draco didn’t know what else to say, really. He knew Astoria had been away on honeymoon for about two weeks and that she’d gotten back a few days ago, but he hadn’t really expected to see her here yet. “Tired of Seamus already?”
Draco took his time, allowing himself to give into the relaxing pull of the water until it got too cold, then drying himself off leisurely.
Blaise arched his eyebrows. “No, you don’t. You have, well, nights with people. Nothing else,” here Blaise paused, finally continuing: “Draco, you don’t even
If Harry had had any doubts about how he felt about Draco before, this would have been a dead giveaway. No room for doubt there.
When they’d had dinner and Malfoy had come into the living room - sitting down on the love seat as he usually did, but still with an icy air around him that threatened to freeze the house from the inside out - Harry somehow felt he had to make amends.
“Okay, I’ll be there. Just make sure you order enough.” Harry smiled, getting up. He didn’t get out of the office yet, though, coming round Draco’s desk again, then standing in front of him, their eyes locked. Draco got up from his chair without giving it another thought, mesmerised by the green of Harry’s eyes like always, and he felt a shiver of relief rippling through his whole body when, finally, their lips met in a short, yet intense kiss.
He’d just stepped into the shower, feeling the warm spray of water sluice over his skin, when the door to the bathroom opened. Draco looked up, seeing that Harry had come in, also still gloriously naked.
“When exactly is civil a good start?” Ginny had just walked up to their table grinning broadly. “When dealing with annoying exes perhaps?”
So, this is it for this story: it's done. Thank you all for reading and accompanying me on this (short) journey! I've had a lot of fun writing this fic and I hope you enjoyed reading it just as much.
“You supposed right,” Zabini just said, an amused glint in his eyes, before he went to the cauldrons, shooting diagnostic spells first, then going to have a look at the potions brewing.
Now it was Draco’s turn to flinch slightly, before returning to complete composure. Harry saw it, though, and so did Nott. And Harry just wanted to tell them, tell Draco, that yes, they did see him that way, that
Potter smiled. “Yeah, I know I’m buying,” he said mock-resignedly. “So, what would you like to have?”
Harry shrugged, deciding that, since he’d dug himself this hole, he might as well jump into it head first. “I don’t think Mr Malfoy is a suspect yet: he’s really just a witness, but I could keep an eye on him for tonight. Just to be sure.”
When he opened his eyes again he couldn’t even bring himself to look at Potter anymore, so he just averted his gaze and got up, ignoring the pain that was decidedly less than yesterday, but still there all the same.
Potter seemed slightly on edge. He’d probably blurted the first thing that came to mind when he’d seen Draco, already regretting having asked. “No, thank you,” Draco answered. It had taken him some time to find his voice, but he knew he’d been able to keep his face carefully blank. Potter still seemed a bit tense, though.
For Malfoy that would be quite different, though: he had grown up with magic. And although he probably wouldn’t have performed any household spells when he was young, for him magic was likely to come as naturally as breathing.
It had actually settled Draco’s nerves about this evening a bit: perhaps this whole Leaky thing would work out somehow.
Harry knew he’d woken up to another nightmare in the middle of the night: his mind mercifully catching up with the fact that Malfoy was sitting beside him once again, rather uncomfortably perched on the small strip of bed that was available next to Harry, his hand on Harry’s shoulder.
Deserted Muggle areas obviously had to be added to Draco’s long mental list of places to preferably avoid or at least be very careful in.
So eventually Draco surrendered and apparated straight to Grimmauld Place, knocking on Harry’s door instantly.
“But I still have to do this whole essay for Professor Malfoy,” an Auror in training now whined, walking past while talking to another trainee.
The rest of the week had been much the same: Draco having dinner at Harry’s whenever Draco’s schedule and Harry’s work allowed it, which was more often than not.
Robards appeared to think it all over. He still hadn’t exploded yet, which, given the circumstances, was probably a good thing. “So, you don’t think we should take him into custody?”
to be together that last time - the day before the engagement, when Draco had gotten back from Hogwarts - but it had just happened and Harry had let it, thinking that Draco had known, that he had known that this would be the last time. Because everyone had known.
Draco, in the meantime, proceeded to free something from his left sleeve almost languidly and all of a sudden Harry knew. The log. Draco still had the Cartel’s log, holding their experimental potions: their effects and how they were brewed.
He had been dead attractive this morning and that most certainly hadn’t changed a bit. Harry stepped in closer still, watching Draco gasp softly, his eyes wide.
“Yes, I’m fine.” His answer was more clipped than he’d intended, but it was true enough, though. He felt better, the pain mostly just a dull reminder of what it had been, although his body still felt tired and heavy.
“Care to dance?” This time it was Potter who’d used Draco’s own technique of creeping up on someone. He was close, leaning into Draco exactly the way Draco had leant into him the previous two nights. What the actual fuck was Potter doing?
Ron looked confused, just for a moment, which was when Harry realised he’d called Draco by his first name, but eventually Ron just nodded. “Yeah, that too.”
“I suppose you’re right,” Zabini sounded completely in control, but Harry saw the way his body gained alertness. It reminded Harry of a cat. “I think we should take this outside.”
Draco didn’t really know how to answer that. She was right, but he also really wanted to get this over with.
Harry felt the urge to answer quickly, reassuringly. “Yeah, nothing that couldn’t be healed straight away. You?”
Hermione watched him with concern and he managed a tight smile that he hoped would somewhat reassure her anyway. “I’m just rather tired. I-. Thank you.” He didn’t say what for, but she had really tried to make him feel at ease here tonight. He hoped she understood. It wasn’t her fault it hadn’t exactly worked.
The whole suite was silent and for some reason it bothered Harry. Except for the first day they’d usually been here together in the early mornings, then going their separate ways. Harry normally had things to do for the rest of the day: obviously meeting up with Zabini now and then, sometimes researching things about the Cartel and keeping in contact with Robards of course, which inevitably and regrettably also meant filling out paperwork.
It had all stopped just before Christmas, though, when Smith and his cronies had had Draco cornered in a bathroom – why did it always have to be a bathroom? – and Harry had walked in. This time Harry hadn’t cursed Draco, however. He had taken in the situation in a split second and cast an almost effortless
Next to Harry Ron gasped. “Are you absolutely sure? Because if you’re going to make accusations, just to clear your name, I swear I will-.” He was stopped by Hermione’s hand on his arm.
Draco had actually slumped into the bar a bit when he saw yet another Weasley, one that actually came his way. It wasn’t something he was used to, so his first instinct was to find anyone else nearby that the Weasley could be coming up to. There was no one.
When Harry came into the club that Saturday night, he was running late. He’d wanted to be there earlier, but dinner with Ron and Hermione had stretched into drinking and talking and it had been difficult to get away. He’d told them he was planning on going to the club again, but he hadn’t told them why.
buying,” he added in an attempt to balance things out a bit, because he knew he shouldn’t have gone along with it, that it was as stupid as it was unexpected.
Harry couldn’t keep his smile from coming – but that seemed okay, because there was no one here to see it anyway – and he decided to start cooking, happy to find comfort in the repetitive action of cutting and stirring and making something that smelled absolutely divine.
“It was really good. If you cook like this, I might like to eat here more often.” Harry said it playfully, but Draco’s stomach seemed to do a happy kind of jolt anyway and that still was a dangerous thing. Even if, by now, Draco had decided that this couldn’t be a dream after all.
There really was a reason why he didn’t do this sort of thing: no friendships and most definitely no relationships. It was safer that way, because things you didn’t start, couldn’t end blowing up in your face either.
Then, without any further warning, Harry’s hand was softly slipping over the nape of Draco’s neck and Draco heard himself groan quite involuntarily and ever so softly, slightly leaning into the touch at the same time.
missed him. Which was absolutely and completely ridiculous, of course, because he’d just seen Harry less than two days ago.
“Hey. You’re still here.” It was the first thing Potter said when he’d stumbled out of the green flames.
“Yes, I do.” Potter paused briefly. “Now, anyway. Ron taught me.” His voice had changed from almost indignant to something a lot softer, less sure.
was. And he also knew that for all the playing around they’d been doing, Potter would not want this. He would probably want to pull, go home with someone - Blaise had actually told Draco as much - but that person would never be Draco, could never be Draco. It would be exceedingly stupid to believe otherwise.
There was the familiar stab of pain and although Draco had almost been waiting for it, it still took him by surprise. Of course it would be like this, though: Harry wasn’t going to be with him, because he liked to be. No, Harry just wanted to help Draco, because it would take his mind off Ron and his injuries. Of fucking course.
Draco just shrugged, also smiling a little. He noticed he felt more at ease than he could ever have imagined. That night at the club there had been a period where he’d felt it too, the ease with which they had interacted, when he’d even allowed himself to believe -, but they had both been drunk and then Harry had said what he had said and, well, it had all been completely hopeless again.
“You’re going to be alright. You were hit with a Stunner-Drainer combination and although the energy drain will probably stop at some point, anyway, I’ll most likely be able to put a stop to it now.” Draco was glad his voice still sounded completely level, none of the worry or relief he’d experienced seeping through.
Harry let that sink in for a moment, then asking: “About the me looking-the-part bit: when should I make my first appearance as your bodyguard?”
Harry’s spell neatly bound Mathew Dean up, like it was supposed to. “I was about to cast a Patronus when Mathew hit me with a
“Yeah, I did,” Harry answered in the most neutral tone he could muster. He felt himself blush a bit all the same.
was why Harry had kissed him just now, why they had made out: Harry had just wanted the hurt that the bond caused him to stop. That made complete, fucking sense.
The people in there weren’t just the usual lot. Sure, there was Zabini, a sign Harry probably would have to work with Special Ops again and some other faces he recognised, but what worried him most were the few people he didn’t know. The ones in formal robes, with formal faces to match.
Draco ran a hand over his face, which didn’t really help, so he decided that a nice splash of cold water would probably do the trick.
Draco shot him a look and it was confusingly stuck between barely hidden gratitude and something else entirely.
Then a thought struck Harry: “But why didn’t they kill Draco straight away? You know when Goodall ran into him on Knockturn. Instead of obliviating him he could have killed him just as well, he obviously didn’t have any qualms about killing.” It was true, of course, and Harry felt an icy cold shiver pass through his body at the thought.
When Blaise had left the common room Draco prepared himself to go out too. This time of the week was usually when he’d meet up with Harry and although their goal had been reached - Draco now
“So, you were obliviated?” Hermione addressed Draco now. It was very much like her to skip straight to what needed to be done, even though she’d been in Australia and Harry hadn’t seen her or Ron for almost a month.
Harry felt strangely calm now: he knew how to do this, had done it in battle and in the field as an Auror. And he could see Draco had, too, the way he moved conveying that beyond a shadow of a doubt.
might know the person in charge of the whole operation, the whole Cartel, because he’s apparently British and a Death Eater, too. So, allegedly we’re actually looking for a Death Eater.”
“No, of course I don’t. It’s fucking irritating, but Luna said that if we act upon this bond that we apparently have, it should ease.”
Next he carefully performed the counter spells, casting diagnostics again afterwards, just to make absolutely sure no residual damage remained.
Draco hesitated just a moment: “I-, I haven’t gotten round to hiring people to do it and-. Well, I’ve been really busy.” Okay, that wasn’t the complete truth, but he didn’t want to embarrass himself by telling Harry how he hadn’t been able to get anything much done really: not even getting some painters in.
It took just a fraction of a second before Malfoy looked away again, standing still on the dancefloor as he had apparently reached the spot he had wanted to be.
“Penelope, I just got word. You’re needed at the Nott house for the rest of the afternoon,” Mathew came down the stairs to the cellar. “Apparently they’ve found something there that you need to take a look at. It’s urgent. Another Curse-Breaker got hurt and they need your help to disarm an object.”
“Hey, you’re awake.” It wasn’t a question, although Draco hadn’t actually turned around to look at Harry.
“Well, I’m going to bring them the final ingredients this evening and Draco will obviously be there already. We will most probably try to get into headquarters after the sale has gone down.”
Harry smiled lazily back at him, draping his arm over Draco’s shoulder and closing his eyes. Draco couldn’t help but do the same, drifting off to sleep without really wanting to yet.
“Yes,” he managed, continuing, because he apparently felt a need to prolong this complete agony, “I haven’t lived here long, just a few days now, and I haven’t had the time to-. Well, it’s not done yet.”  Draco’d heard his own voice go quiet and he didn’t like it, not with Harry sodding Potter standing on his doorstep, looking like, like
When Harry went to pick it up, he could feel the tingle of the Wards that Draco had set on their room, his magic lightly washing over Harry, letting him pass.
Draco only realised he’d fallen asleep when he woke up, because he’d heard something. It was still dark, but there definitely was someone, or something, in his living room.
He was a mere boy, certainly no more than twenty years of age, but his face was set in determined anger.
So Harry got out of bed, looked down on himself briefly to make absolutely sure that his pyjamas actually covered everything and then he went into their shared living space.
“Mr Potter?” It was the first thing Draco heard when he regained consciousness. Oh, yes, he’d had the good manners to pass out in Potter’s guestroom.
to have changed. He’s lived in continental Europe over the last seven or eight years and apparently he’s become some sort of philanthropist, organising all sorts of events, raising enormous amounts of money for charity.” There she paused again, then added, more softly: “My Foundation against the Discrimination of Magical Creatures has actually received his Charity’s support for, well, the last five years at least.”
Because, yes, he was handsome, annoyingly so really, he’d always been: Draco was wasted enough to let himself appreciate that, to let himself stare for a bit.
Draco got up, finding Harry’s Ogden’s in the same spot it had been in all those years ago. So he got them tumblers and sat himself down again, pouring them both a generous measure and handing Harry one.
Harry had obviously got the reference to what Draco had said earlier, because he slanted him a quick, almost worried glance, then obviously decided Draco wasn’t being awful and smiled.
“No, I didn’t notice. I was rather preoccupied when I walked in there today,” Harry mumbled. “And it was dark, for the most part.” Because, well, that was what it had been. Very dark. Except for where Draco had been, bleeding out.
So Harry felt as miserable on Tuesday as he’d felt on Monday, taking over Draco’s class on Tuesday afternoon, because even though he knew
Draco stood his ground. “Believe it or not: I tend to work with everyone well.” His tone was proud contempt, but Harry felt the uncertainty underneath.
That was when Mathew decided to step in, however, blocking Draco’s spell with a shield that was obviously meant to keep Draco’s Patronus from working. And the shield did its job, extinguishing Draco’s Patronus as if it had never even been there in the first place.
Draco noticed he was quite nervous and it he could tell himself that he wanted to make the team, because he thought it was a nice, new challenge, which was true. And he could also tell himself that it would not be a problem to be working in the UK again, because he didn’t care about people’s usually decisively low opinion of him, which was only very partly true.
Okay, Harry thought slightly sullenly, Ron had still referred to the git as Malfoy, not Draco. That at least was something.
“I’m fine.” Draco sounded more in control than he actually looked: his hair a very uncharacteristic mess and his clothes rumpled.
“Draco, what are you doing?” Potter’s voice sounded completely astonished. And he had called him Draco. He’d called him
So what if this was the first evening this week Draco didn’t get to spend with Harry? That shouldn’t be a problem whatsoever, now should it? Harry was going to have dinner with Luna this evening, like he had wanted to on Monday, and even though Harry had told Draco about it a few days ago already, it still oddly stung somehow.
They went upstairs together. And so what, if Harry was a little unstable, tired and slightly tipsy, and Draco slipped his arm around his waist and let Harry lean into him a bit.
“I’m going to sit you down on the bed. Do you think you can sit, just until I take your shirt off?” Harry asked.
actually fly. As you are well aware. They don’t need to be Veela to-.“ And that was when Harry captured his lips in a kiss so tender, so utterly sweet that Draco abruptly lost his whole train of thought.
“Potter? You’re still here.” Draco’s voice was heavy with surprise. Then he fell silent for a beat, seemingly needing some time to compose himself, steadying himself against the door frame. It gave Harry the time he needed to pick himself up and actually face Draco.
So eventually he walked into the canteen, disregarding people gazing in his direction. Potter wasn’t there yet, so Draco decided to secure them a table.
So, that’s how Harry found himself sitting in a hallway, his back against the wall, listening to Draco sodding Malfoy patiently explaining French grammar. Harry didn’t think this day could get any stranger.
A crestfallen look and then Draco curling in on himself again, shaking, crying. “You’re right. I wouldn’t have-,  taken me-, out-, either.” His words were quiet, resigned.
So much work that they hadn’t even finished taking all the wards on the first statuette down when it was time to leave for the night.
When Draco woke up the next morning it took him some time to actually remember where he was and why.
And that’s when he saw him: in between all the rubble left behind. “Ron!” Harry ran to where he saw Ron’s head sticking out from under a pillar that had fallen. There was blood everywhere.
It took Harry just a second to realise she was awaiting his permission to speak. “Yes,” he gave her an inviting smile.
Penelope looked slightly sad. “I don’t know really. I’m still evaluating my options to be honest. I’ve been offered a senior post at Gringotts.” It sounded to Draco like she’d already made up her mind.
Harry’s gaze wandered helplessly to Draco’s bare skin again, though, and Draco had to admit he liked it. It felt like more than a gaze, almost like a real caress. So Draco let it happen, giving up on getting to know what Harry had talked to Luna about, just revelling in the feel of Harry watching him like this.
Only when the sickening sensation of apparition had stopped and he was in his own flat again, did Draco give himself permission to let them come. For the first time since he’d come back to Britain, since Astoria had found happiness with someone else, since he’d seen Harry again and had known it would end.
Harry nodded, because to him it made perfect sense: wanting to be somewhere where people didn’t see your past, just you, nothing else. He understood all of it. And Harry abruptly realised what it had meant that Malfoy had shared this place with him, that he had willingly taken Harry to this club that was so important to him that he’d only shared it with one close friend.
So this time when Draco felt the warmth of his own fire in his veins respond to his dire situation, it was almost calming: he let it come, let it rule him. Harry had been glad he’d used his Veela side earlier. It was okay to use it.
Harry didn’t particularly want to, but instead of watching Ginny and Zabini, he found himself gazing at Astoria and Malfoy walking to the middle of the room together. He couldn’t really get himself to stop, which wasn’t much of a problem until Malfoy watched him too, a look on his face that Harry was completely unable to read.
.” Draco said, pushing Harry slightly out of his way, toward a rather nasty looking bush. Harry looked around, knowing Draco must have meant something he couldn’t just tell him.
Harry really, really wanted to kiss Draco again and he almost made a move to do so, but Draco saw and shook his head ever so slightly.
“Malfoy,” he nodded back, realising how his own voice sounded a bit more stunned than had been his intention.
So he let himself trail behind Harry, going to the kitchen, sitting down in the same chair he’d occupied the day before, while Harry shoved a plate his way that held everything Draco loved to have for breakfast: toast, bacon and eggs. Lots of it.
“That was hard.” Harry saw how Zabini was deliberating with himself, probably trying to decide how much he could tell. “He was lucky to find someone who gave him a job bartending eventually.”
When they did, Harry was looking at a rather beefy man in his forties, who watched him warily and expectantly all at once. They shook hands. “Mr Riggs. Glad you could make it. I’m John Jones.” Yeah, of course he was. Harry wasn’t entirely sure with how many pinches of salt he should take that name. It sounded rather made-up.
rather a feat, though, that Potter had actually got a Healer to help Draco. And it was probably even more impressive that he had apparently got her to do a house call. Draco still vividly remembered the first time he’d been hit by a curse after his trial. It hadn’t been as painful as this one, but it
Harry found he meant it. That was what being an Auror was about, wasn’t it? It was why Harry wanted to become one, anyway: justice. Not just people taking the law into their own hands, dealing out curses to whoever didn’t please them. That was unfair. And leaving someone vulnerable without a wand, just having to take what any wizard or witch would cast at them without any sort of protection, well, that was well beyond unfair.
And even though Draco wasn’t drunk this time, he went up to them without giving it any further thought, approaching Potter from behind.
Harry didn’t know what his face had done when he’d been busy being slightly shocked, but Malfoy furrowed his brow, saying: “Oh don’t be overly dramatic. I was awake anyway, so I just thought-”
So Harry got slightly closer to the bed, watching Malfoy’s face, scanning for anything out of the ordinary, which he couldn’t find. That was good, too, of course.
Harry was flipping through the first out of the pile of casefiles he’d taken home with him for the night, hoping he could at least read through some of them, when he heard someone come in. When he looked up he saw Malfoy casually strolling into his living room. It was a sight Harry didn’t think he would ever really get used to.
Harry smiled at her teasingly. “I’m only civil to annoying exes when they get the next round of drinks.”
“Ron and I should be off to Hogsmeade,” Hermione now said. “We’re going to meet some people there for drinks.”
The man that had brought them here – and who had introduced himself as Claude in the meantime - looked at them both appraisingly. “Much better.” His gaze lingered on Malfoy just a bit longer than it had any reason to and he didn’t leave it at that, either, stepping in and loosening Malfoy’s collar by yet another button, then pulling him close and whispering something in his ear that Harry didn’t get.
“Draco, you’re pale as a ghost. Let me see!” Harry didn’t yell, but it was very obvious that he was not going to let this go.
Harry nodded, actually looking happy. “Good. Hermione will be there too, and Blaise might - we never know when he’s coming - and some other people we know. Oh, and Oliver Wood. He’s just back from the States.” Draco didn’t say anything to that. None of this was actually making him any less apprehensive.
“For allowing Draco to come in today.” Harry noticed Zabini must have cast a Silencing Charm, because the incessant sound of the bass had decreased considerably and it was surprisingly easy to hear him. “And for not letting them take him into custody.” Zabini’s eyes were serious. “You know, because Azkaban-, well, let’s just say it was no picnic.”
Working on the case they’d been assigned to proved to be as tedious as the file had suggested it would be. The house had definitely been used for dark magic once, but not much of it seemed to actually have remained. There were some objects imbued with magic, lots of it, but most of them hardly seemed noteworthy, mostly looking like the things a pure-blood family would have acquired over the centuries, inlaid with layer upon layer of magic, but hardly dangerous: Draco had seen worse at the Manor growing up and those things hadn’t posed a threat, either. One basically just had to know how to deal with them.
