"I know your pureblood tradition. Making it early for your fiancé?" Dorian nodded, and Dantanian's face looked still more displeased with the entire world. "I wonder, though, after how
"We'll look after her, Draco!" called Tony, not exactly a full acquiescence, but Draco still leaned his head on Harry's chest in serene contentment.
"I don't know who he's told," Draco began. "Probably Bellatrix Lestrange- from the look of them, you've heard they were
"So you're going to?" Draco prodded. "Listen, Harry, we need to talk about this before anyone else can know. We'll talk later, I promise, just please, promise me you'll keep last night a secret until then?"
"I know you're a dedicated stalker, Potter," Draco snorted. "Hope I haven't given you any ideas. The places you could follow me while invisible..." Potter made an embarrassed sound and nearly veered off the path, tripping on the curb. Draco grabbed his right hand and hauled him back, making sure he kept his balance. Potter's bare hands felt ice-cold even through the gloves.
"If you inspect more closely," Severus said, rebuking, "You will discover that there are similar items in place for Mr. Crabbe, Goyle, Nott, and Zabini. As your Head of House, it is a duty I must take up, with
"Ran into Mr. Nott at the Ministry, did he tell you?"
Gilderoy stepped up and kissed Seguinus eagerly, erotic fervor greater than any thirst for knowledge. Seguinus smirked against his mouth. He made Gilderoy draw back in alarm when he leaned his left hand behind himself, crouching and pulling Gilderoy with him, and drew his fingers once more over the water.
Talk of mad Muggles led to recounting their adventure in Islington, but Hermione kicked his foot before he could continue to where their walk had led them after the stadium. Instead, she began to enthuse over Draco's progress learning football, and Draco unveiled his new nickname for her: Striker.
..." It wasn't hard to read between the lines, what followed from that in Theo's mind.
"If you ever tried at all," Lamia scolded, "Or even paid
It wasn't Theo he met there, but Pammaque Periander, whom he had known would be waiting. What made him stop walking, nearly tripping over his own feet, wasn't the sight of the assessor, who looked quite different than Draco remembered, his once mixed hair now gone fully charcoal grey, in plain unheeled boots and untarnished robes of pure black. Nor was it the particularly foreboding gloom to the graveyard today, a place where all the sunlight and early promise of spring on that February day seemed to die away. It was what Periander was doing: knelt down in the corner of a graveyard, his arms shoulder-deep in the dirt, digging.
"Do I know everything?" Harry asked Draco uncertainty, the remainder still there of- not distrust, precisely, but inevitable misgiving. "I should, shouldn't I?"
That got a strong reaction, but Draco mimed sticking his own tongue to the roof of his mouth. Merlin, it was good to have such an efficient means of making people listen to him. He smiled at Hermione, hiding his nerves, and she took the picture and showed Ron and Potter each in turn, pointing them out one by one. "Moony is Professor Lupin. He's a werewolf-"
"They're the Potters' childhood friends," Draco observed dryly to Theo. "You kind of ended up with the wrong crowd for that."
"Hmm," Vince said, "But then how will he ruin Halloween this year? It's
Father didn't usually begin so quickly. Draco had barely taken his seat in that old despised pinewood chair before Father rounded on him, with a demonic fierceness in his eyes that had used to scare Draco more. Draco had his wand at his side, though he didn't intend to pull it unless he thought he was about to ruin the future or die. It wasn't like he thought he could take Father in a duel, even with all the experience he had that Father didn't know about, and even with a wand that had done more dark things that Father could ever dream. Trying to duel Father would give so much away he might as well shout to the rooftops he wasn't the real Draco Malfoy anymore.
"Can't take credit for that one. It helps when the other person is already terrified of you."
allegiances now?"
but the same could not be said for Harry. He was just staring down at Draco with his lips parted and his eyes very wide, pupils dilating and turning them darker behind his thick eyelashes.
"Severus is Draco's godfather," Dumbledore said calmly, and Draco's attempts to think of a good lie fell away. He turned to Potter's trio, hoping somehow Hermione had already guessed and wouldn't care, or that none of them would find this important information.
Hermione held up a finger to her mouth, and Luna stopped. It was smart not to give the imposter any more information than necessary. Even though you would think that any fake worth the whistling would at least keep abreast of whether the man's body he was impersonating had been dug up- except he would have been the one to do that himself, wasn't he? Had that been the beginning of this undead farce? Except then-
Gilderoy's shoulders slumped, pretense of pride deserting him. "I am aware of the irony of my eventual fate, given the methods I frequently utilized. I am well aware indeed. Perhaps it was the only fitting punishment for-"
"HE SAVED UNCLE SIRIUS'S LIFE! There wouldn't be a wedding without him, there wouldn't be a Sirius Black at all- always with your Gryffindor ingratitude-"
Lovely. So Potter didn't even have a plan. They were both going to end up colossally bored and hating each other before the end of this ill-advised friendship-building venture. Granted, Draco hadn't been bored for a second so far, but that was mostly due to soul-crushing terror that Potter would figure out Draco wished it was a date. Potter began walking along the main street, and Draco followed beside him. It gave him the bizarre urge to do as he could see many of the two-person pairs, almost all male-female but not entirely, and hold Potter's hand again.
Rich and powerful. Even once disowned, left House Black
Draco took another step back behind Potter.
," Dudley said, miming lifting his own shirt and making high-pitched cooing noises in mockery.
"A Hippogriff," Hermione ventured.
"No, not Neville, we thought we should make it a more exclusive group," George laughed, and had to suffer Hermione's screeching, only to have her fall dead silent when the lift stopped.
"We want to think you're innocent!" Potter sounded like he meant it. "We haven't said anything to anyone, not even to Dumbledore about what Myrtle said. And nothing to anyone else about where I saw you in Knockturn Alley with your father, or whose your wand really is- we
"What do you mean, anyone but you, Miss Ginevra?" Draco whined. "After everything we've been through together..."
"Diffindo!
"Rita?" Neville echoed disbelievingly, and Luna beamed, throwing an arm around Skeeter's shoulders like they were best friends. She leaned in and sniffed at the flowers.
"Just be careful," Draco cautioned. "First gulp, it gives you such a rush, I lost my footing, first time-"
He clutched onto the dragon Ouroboros he was making for Hermione, which he'd put on a cord necklace around his neck in the dorms, under his uniform, to be sure no one could take from him again, and tried to steady himself, tracing the sharp bumps of its spine around its endless self-devouring circle, but the devouring had ended, and now the dragon was retching itself up. The bile seemed to climb up higher and higher in his neck, up until his nose could feel too much acid to hold back, and he was retching again, eyes too blurred at least to see the mess he made, as he clung onto the charm for Hermione...
"Oh, Draco, listen, it's your watch! It's 11:59!" Luna exclaimed, thankfully cutting off his sappiness. Draco switched the watch over to reciting seconds, and they stared at each other over the filthy-smelling sooty bubbling, their light icy eyes seeming to float in the dark smoke.

intelligence. It's escalation, right? Once you get your foot in the door, the other person becomes gradually more willing to let you in further."
"Never let it be said," Draco intoned, "That I have become predictable. No fear, Harry, I will also be teaching you counter-spells. Shall we proceed?"
"Okay, fine," Draco said, "We can have weekly dueling lessons."
"In those circumstances, I am glad you broke it. And really," he went on silkily. "It was a Gryffindor who got it, so does that even count?"
want Draco dead was urgently in need of his presence. Being how that only constituted two Slytherins, though, it was not an unmanageable number.
Bellatrix Black Lestrange
Draco strained against the pinned weight of his wrists to drag Harry into another kiss by teeth as the heat built in his stomach and pulsed between his legs, as Harry built the sensation thicker and thicker until at last it was stabbing, left foot rising and spasming, kicking into the wall of its own volition while his right dug into the sheets. His back arched as he came, seed dripping into Harry's palm as his lower half melted, thrumming to the rhythm of Harry's touch as that palm kept moving, prolonging the crest of the orgasm until it felt like Harry had milked him dry.
"Hermione doesn't have buck teeth anymore, Luna fixed them," Draco protested, right as Harry asked,
knew. And maybe even once Harry did know, Draco's Langlock could break with him.
Draco had his mouth open for a smart comment. But Myrtle cleared her throat, liable to burst into tears at any moment, along with her eponymous moaning. "Tactless!" she exclaimed, and got angrier at their blank looks. "Talking about breathing in front of me!" she said with an ill-portending rising hysteria. "When I can't... when I haven't... not for ages..." She buried her face in her handkerchief and sniffed loudly.
Draco groaned and flopped back onto his bed, lying next to the wand instead. He was still dressed in the nice clothes he had worn for Valentine's Day, and knew rationally that he should at least try and face the others before going to bed or retreating into hibernation. He should at least give some explanation to Harry, for ruining Valentine's Day. But he didn't even think he could

"Are you going to help with the Snargaluff, Frankenstein, or keep working on You-Know-Who's bloody unauthorized biography?" Ron groused. "You haven't even put your gloves on."
And it didn't spoil his mood to see Ron and Hermione had gotten fed up waiting and left without him. It better suited his purposes.
"Tell me one thing," Draco sighed, "Can you still feel the Dementors from wherever it is?" Draco could feel them even down in bed in the dungeons, though it was sometimes hard to tell whether the constant tugging at the edges of his mind was the distant presence of Dementors, or from his own mental agitation and imbalance. "Wait- are you affected by Dementors, Dobby?"
"Why are you like this?" Potter murmured, eyes softening with fondness, only for Charlie to start speaking at Draco's other side.
"I know!" Draco snapped, snatching the picture back. "I just wanted to show you I know who I'm talking about, that's all. And he is alive, Severus, I know it. I heard my
For what or whom, Draco couldn't tell.
Delacour's performance against her Welsh Green was the same as Draco remembered. It would be her best at any Task this tournament, if not up to Potter and Krum's standard. Krum took on his Chinese Fireball the same way as well, with the same results, including a ludicrously high score from Karkaroff. It made no sense to Draco, why Karkaroff would push for Krum so hard if his target was to get Potter to the Portkey first, but then Draco remembered that Krum had assaulted other champions in the maze. Karkaroff would have had every chance to be the one to cast Imperius on Krum, and use him as his hitman, taking out all the champions but Potter, and then presumably himself. Best get Krum as far ahead into the maze as possible, even before Potter.
Something like madness was on his face. Or perhaps it was Dantanian himself, questioning whether he had gone mad. It could be that a part of him, as much as he loved looking at the pictures and listening to his mother's secondhand tales, had never truly believed them real.
Viktor was the only one who knew him who'd seen the full transformation. He'd been enthusiastic at first about the prospect of disguising his friend. But when he saw the reality, it had sent him back into his characteristic gloom. "It is not good, that you have to change this much," he had sighed, "Just to come support me, my friend. I vould not recognize you on the street. If you are truly in this much danger from the Dark Lord, then perhaps you should not come to the match. I vould understand it."
"What are you doing? Aren't you supposed to be a Ravenclaw?" Marietta Edgecombe called bluntly, and Draco didn't have to even think before giving a retort to the likes of her.
"Your godfather?" Harry guessed wrongly. "I'm sorry. But you don't seem helpless to me..."
"Please, don't you trust me? I trust
Hermione was right. They'd already been high in the castle, and it wasn't hard to convince a tipsy Draco and Luna they should swing by the seventh floor. They'd be leaving tomorrow, and the thought of finding the Mirror of Erised would obsess Draco's sober self, if he had to wait until the end of winter break to look. So they followed, Luna singing Expecting your Patronum in a lovely soprano- not the stealthiest of enterprises- and Hermione paced before the entrance. When the door opened, they came out into that cavernous room of forgotten things where Draco had destroyed the vanishing cabinet. The Mirror of Erised loomed near the entrance, under a ceiling that made even this massive mirror look small.
"It was not," Severus interrupted coldly, "Fitting. None deserve that punishment, whatever their crimes. True punishment cannot be given by another crime, only by legal justice. And that is what met you in absentia, Gilderoy. Attribute not the rest to some cosmic karmic nonsense. You
And Draco could insist with a clear conscience, "No, I'll swear on anything you want, he said those words to me. He would have brought your sister back to life."
"I do," Draco said firmly. "So were you complicit?"
"And that's bad?" Neville surmised.
to get to Grindelwald in Nurmengard, or at least of succeeding at it. And option three... well, option three isn't on the table."
"It's like raindrops now," Theo said, paling as he stared at Millie's endlessly blood-producing hands, caught always red-handed. "Are you- Millie, are you lightheaded?" Millie shook her head, and Theo seized both her hands and pulled them to him, not seeming to care how it left his own hands and sleeve sullied too. "I can't see where the cuts even are, Millie. Are you sure you were cut? Is that even your blood?"
, let me stay here-"
What would have been the most perfect, the most untainted happiness? The most beautiful thing he could imagine, which would have absolved him of every guilt? More perfect than even the touch of Harry Potter?
Such was the first true witch born.
"Neville, we have an adult involved already," Draco interrupted, and received a room full of stares. "Professor Lockhart?" he tried, and then it was a room full of
Time to up the ante. "It doesn't matter what they say," Draco said thickly, "I only care what
"James Potter and- and- his friends?" Draco stuttered. "What- what do you mean- who was- I don't understand-" Some mixture of intuition and an instinctive drive not to have his godfather think him totally brainless had him staring down at the notebook and breathing, "Moony. Moon." He remembered Lupin's Boggart coming into view before him, from the whirl of shadow that had once been Bellatrix Lestrange. "Moony was Lupin, because he's a werewolf. They wouldn't- they couldn't possibly be so reckless- it's too obvious, it's like they wanted people to figure out-"

Luna leaned over and whispered in his ear, "I hate people getting this angry. I'll catch up with you later, alright?" Draco nodded and let her slip away, before elbowing Potter again.
"Aren't you angry?" Draco asked Sirius meekly, not even sure which guilt he was attempting to assuage, and Sirius shook his head.

shouldn't have to be the one to do it, not you..."
He was ignored all the same. "You're as useless as the other two," he groaned. "Finestra!"
"Draco," Theo said, and reached out towards him tentatively. When Draco didn't put away, he pulled the S clasp out of Draco's hair that had held it so well in place, pushed it into Draco's pocket, and began to run his fingers through Draco's sweaty hair, smoothing it softly back from his forehead.
Draco might have been afraid, thinking of Halloween while knowing how it had gone last time. But he had no reason to be afraid anymore. Not with Severus the one he was counting on to make everything right.

"I mean," Draco said, "It sucks to be jealous, but it sucks worse when it's your friend. Then you feel like a shitty person, cause you're not supposed to be jealous, you're supposed to be
"I'm so pleased I didn't choose Arithmancy as an elective," Luna agreed. "We've been listening for ten minutes, waiting for it to be over, and I feel we've aged years."
Draco didn't know if he was sobbing or just panting into Hermione's thick hair as the lights came back on above them. She was stroking his hair as well, and he whimpered, trying to tell himself everyone was fine and nothing had happened, that he had known this was coming and it wasn't even anything unexpected. Then there was the sound of Potter's voice waking, asking shakily what was going on, as the Hogwarts Express began to move again in turn too, but Draco couldn't let go of Hermione, not even when she tried to sit up and brace herself at the motion.
Ravenclaw was slaughtering Slytherin. Absolutely slaughtering them, just as badly as Draco remembered from the first time, although the lack of superior brooms had to be making it worse. Draco didn't remember the exact score this many years later, but he thought he would have remembered at any time falling down 120-0 to Ravenclaw. A Ravenclaw that had already been soundly beaten this year by both Hufflepuff and Gryffindor.
"Harry, everyone reacts differently," Lupin tried to reassure him, and Draco poked at Potter until he stopped making such a mopey pathetic face at him.
"He did," Gilderoy said defensively, and unrolled the sleeve of his robe, his fur a great mass like an exotic animal on the sofa laid beside him. "See?" It did not look like any of the scars had gone, but they may have been more faded than Draco had remembered. "He's been trying different herbs and ointments. I'm sure it must seem very pathetic to you, someone who once claimed to be such a great wizard, going to Severus for help with
The Elder Wand was real. Dumbledore had it- though for how much longer-
The night was clear and must have been warm, since Phineas went without a cloak, clear enough to see any number of stars above the ocean. Phineas did not seem to suspect anything, not for the entire walk towards the observatory. "Did you finally get that room in there open?" he asked, and Dantanian didn't answer. That just made Phineas watch him more admiringly, eyes following the lines of Dantanian's body under his robes. He only stopped looking at Dantanian when he heard the strangled voices of his children.
"I am here to make sure I'll be doing the right thing," Aberforth said bluntly, "Entrusting all of the evacuation to my brother. But that's not about this castle, that was just an excuse to meet with you before spring term starts. I couldn't risk an OWL or the like, but- if I am to work with the Order, I need to know there is at least one person there who will question Albus, who will not blindly follow him to whatever ends he deems
his father, and Father was more frightened than he had been in his entire life as he shrieked into an empty room, with footsteps stalking away. "How! How! How, Bella, how could you, what have you done, what have you
, even, for forcing Draco to take part, hissing that he had protested against it from the first and look what had happened. In a more private communication, though, Severus sent Draco a letter folded around one extra-strength, personally brewed dose of Pepper-Up Potion, and wrote that he suspected Draco had suffered more adversely than others because his immune system had already been weakened. By magical exhaustion, he said, not that Draco hadn't been able to suspect that by Severus's inclusion of Vitamix potion, Invigoration draught, and seven large bottles of double-strength angel's infusion. Severus's instructions said to soak in the infusions daily, in a small tub in the Slytherin dorms, and that he must not miss any for an entire week. Nor would Severus allow Draco to return to class for that following week under any circumstances.
"Plenty of parents use corporal discipline on children, it's normal," Draco said defensively.
Father stalked over to the venom, sack in hand. "How much?" he spat.
"How can you say crazy things like that," Harry marveled, "And somehow it sounds..."
"Yes, didn't you tell me you were sure you knew what was inside it?" piped up Flitwick.
would want nothing to do with him if he knew who Draco really was. He wouldn't want to speak to him, just to give back his wand and walk away. Potter didn't think Draco was cool, he pitied him. He thought he was pathetic, if he thought of him at all. Draco didn't deserve this moment, as Potter stared out over the grounds of Malfoy Manor like a fairytale castle beneath them.
Moody in either timeline, but Crouch had been a damn good actor. It was hard not to think the man before him wouldn't turn to him at any moment and start talking about how his wand had tortured the sanity out of the Longbottoms.
"She haunts the girls' toilet on the first floor," said Hermione.

The attention he gave her was largely of a morbid sort, thinking over what Severus had said about Gryffindors pretending to tolerate you, while he failed to pay sufficient attention to a class he had never actually taken before. It was over before he knew it, making him again glad Hermione was there, so he could look over her notes at their study table that afternoon.

Draco might have agreed, if not for the very first item on his list of goals for the year:

YOU TOOK MY FATHER FROM ME.
There was one headstone for Periander, but there had been two graves, and both seemed to have been emptied. There was a hole for both, more than six feet deep, the earth looking unsettled. Whether it was from above or below, the grave looked forcefully dug, perhaps freshly opened. It looked empty, but for Draco's flowers- except there was the corpse of Maledictum still there, further rotted, it was just Periander who was gone-
Draco pulled out his wand. "Go ahead! Have a good fucking look! Anyone tells, you know what will come for you! You know what I'll do! You

She did indeed look far more sophisticated than usual, her long hair in a braid crown, and some of the blue and white diamond Black jewelry on that had survived the ring-making. Draco had given her twin bracelets, a diamond chain belt, and sparkling chandelier earrings, though she'd refused to wear any necklace but the Sleeping Beauty turquoise necklace that Draco had made her years ago.
Very unhappy." Any words dried up in Draco's throat. "I have observed, and your Head of House would concur, that you have had difficulties with the other children at Hogwarts. You spend far too many meals hidden away amongst the house elves, sticking to their company in the kitchen instead. Withdrawing yourself so often from the rest of your year is not healthy, Draco. And the introduction of yet another house elf, this one familiar to you besides, to give a further excuse to spend your time in the company of elves instead of human children... that could not be to your benefit. I feel for Dobby, but I must look after the welfare of students as well, and having him here would not be good for you-"
"Daniel, I don't get it," said Dorian, bringing a glass. Dantanian didn't take it, sat back in a plush chair, in what was unmistakably Malfoy Manor. In time, this room would become Narcissa Malfoy's parlor.

. It was toned down from the historical as well, naturally, with the great swell out of the skirts the same as any ball gown, not the larger, squarer Marie Antoinette look that Mother had shown Draco in pictures. And it was sleeveless like those dresses wouldn't have been, Luna's body wrapped in a tight bodice with a line of silver ribbon in bows down the front, and enough silver filigree and diamonds embroidered on it to probably buy the Burrow four times over. Draco's necklace finished off the look perfectly- save for the live holly earrings. They'd have to work on those. But with the long diamond tassel earrings and twin bracelets of white and blue diamond also in Mother's package, Draco had the perfect materials to do so.
"I don't have time to explain," Weasley hissed, and looked around furtively. "Listen, can you meet me here in half an hour? It's easier if I just show you." Draco nodded, picked up his book, and tore his way down to the Slytherin dungeons. Even while he knew he was being ridiculous, he cast an expanding charm on his bag and began to pack.

"Hagrid's in trouble," said Potter, cutting right to the heart of it. "That's why we've come."
"I wish you were, like,
? At best, you're buying Harry's lies, and at worst, you're covering for him because you helped him!"
"And I can assure you," Severus said, throwing his fork down after having speedily demolished his entire large serving of lamb, "It will not be secure. No amount of guard will be enough. You cannot imagine the enthusiasm in the Dark Lord's ranks for disrupting this occasion, and not merely from your charming cousin, Black. I have just sat through hours and hours of gratuitous planning at Malfoy Manor, of the horrors that will be visited should you be foolish enough to
would work the same on Saint Potter. But it just drove Potter further towards dislike, while trying for the opposite.
"I want to touch you
The sunrise that arrived was a promising one, at least if beauty was to be counted as something promising, with a soft glowing play between shades of pink and orange and gold over the vast lake, gently suffusing the morning mist with nothing but glimmering hopefulness. Harry came at last to Draco's side in that sparkling mist, almost like he had been charmed into existence out of it, to be the needed companion to take that empty place on the blanket Draco had brought them.
"Oh no," said Ron. "Oh no, oh no, oh-"
"Are you?" Father said coldly. "You have what you came for. Give back my wand and get out. The wards will be closed to you should you attempt to return."
With a wordless yell, the tall dark shadow raised his wand over his head and slashed it through the air like slitting a throat. It was like all the air left the room at once. The ring of blue flames died in an instant. Protego Diabolica- the most powerful spell Draco knew, his trump card, the only ace he had left- it had been dismantled by the Dark Lord without that hideous noseless face having to utter a single word.
"I will destroy this memory," Severus said immediately. "We will speak to no one of this."
"What strange sights life can place before us sometimes," Dumbledore mused, seeming off in a different world. "The last living lawful heir of the ancient houses of Malfoy
"You've caught the Heir of Slytherin!" squealed a girl on the Ravenclaw table. Draco was pleased to catch no one glancing in his direction at that.
Slytherin. See? Colovaria," he cast, and turned the blue flames gold and Gryffindor-red. A few of the younger students shrieked again, ducking their heads. Okay, that might have been counterproductive.
"I rather have, haven't I?" Draco preened, giving Ginny permission with an indulgent wave to try on one of the other necklaces, a black one that shimmered in the bluebell flames he had hovering along every corner. "Sorry you never got the chance to see Malfoy Manor like Hermione did, but I figure you're just as happy with both of your eyeballs still attached to their sockets, so..."
But Dionysus sounds more like
But Hermione's solicitude had not been over the Wormtail question, but some of the things Harry found out after, having snuck a look into Dumbledore's Pensieve when alone in his office because of course he had. For one, he had seen Bagman, an ex-Quidditch star, brought up on charges of passing information. And he had seen four Death Eaters brought in on another occasion, which made Draco pale to hear, knowing Harry would have heard about Draco's wand: Harry hadn't said it to Hermione, but Draco knew those four individuals must have been called up for judgment for the torture of Frank and Alice Longbottom.
It was only when Draco was trying to sleep that night, though, that he remembered that Trelawney had also predicted the Grim in Potter's future, in tasseography, and that the Grim's form was a large black dog. Like the one Sirius had appeared as, in the Quidditch match when the Dementors came and Potter fell.
When Draco turned, he found their faces unexpectedly close. "Sorry," he muttered, stepping back, only to suffer a small heart attack when Potter's arms wound around his neck- but he was just freeing the bottom of his hair from that stubborn button. Potter's hands turned the collar at last downwards to save his hair, and then he beamed like a little puppy, hoping for a treat for having performed well.
," and that meant the end of any non-academic talk.
he meant what he said about the Patronus to mean he doesn't care about you. His feelings are just... complicated, when it comes to you. Not like the rest of us. He'll calm down once he's been away from the Dursleys for longer. They're poisonous."
"I'm sorry, Draco," Sirius said, and headed towards the door, but stopped at the threshold once he and Severus had switched places. "And thank you. Thank you so much for everything."
"And that," Draco said, pouncing on his words, "Is
"Do you think I'm stupid?"
One could hardly decide where to look, whether a twisted, overgrown bonsai tree decorated in hanging wrought-iron lanterns, paintings of ruined castles whose style clearly marked them as the mother's, and uneven piles of Persian carpets across the hardwood that young feet could surely only have run about over safely before with the ease of long practice. The furniture was all deep blue and bright bronze, lived-in but tidy with small curiosities on the tables, statue busts or little bowls of powdered candies, animal skulls or unnaturally-colored bottles of mysterious liquids, all shone through by the room's glittering air of filtered gold. Eventually, though, one's eyes would always settle on the painting, which was beginning swiftly to take shape.
? No one but you has played a day of Hogwarts Quidditch in their lives."
It would probably come sooner than Remus would like to think. "No, I had no idea," Draco lied, making sure not to put too much effort into the lie, and not look Remus straight in the eyes. He had scarcely ever met a person harder to lie to. Sirius would have been much easier. "The evacuation? If Voldemort attacks, you mean. To get the students out."
It was a murkier day in London than Hogsmeade when he Apparated to the front of 12 Grimmauld Place, currently hidden between 11 and 13. The road was empty outside, so he took the chance and tried to Apparate into the space he knew was there within that absence. He found it barred to him, so he once again cut his palm and used the Sanguirenere spell to enter, watching the Black townhouse emerge from its Muggle neighbors like some black-sailed ship drawing up out of the fog. Once he was inside, it was like he had gone back months in time to that first visit, if one ignored the sight of the painting he had mutilated the first time, the body disappeared but the loose tatters remaining hanging between the curtains.
Harry would realize that everything he knew about Dumbledore, this virtuous public face he showed the world, had been built on the foundation of a lie. That the man who had fought the century's two Dark Lords, when no one else could, had also been part of their creation, not one but both. That Dumbledore was a Dark Lord himself, or as good as one, not just in power but in ruthlessness. Except something had gone wrong in that usual selfish script of power, and all that power had turned towards the maintenance of the status quo, the maintenance of his own appearance of blamelessness even while his hands were so covered in blood, Verniculpa might have no
But Gilderoy was down patching up the walls, on the outside close enough to the sea for high tide to threaten boot leather. Severus had risked the threat, despite not having any role in this menial task, and despite it being already finished from what Draco could see, no reason for anyone to be held up except outside curiosities. With Severus and Gilderoy's backs leaned against a wall so well-repaired it bore no marks of decay, throwing them both entirely into shadow, that curiosity found voice. It was a question Draco had asked himself, and
The advantage to Aberforth's sobering charm was that it made the creation of a Portkey far less hazardous for Draco. The disadvantage was that it made Draco's mind clear enough to think for the first time,
Dear Dragon-Face,
Harry's response was as simpering as a Hufflepuff's. "I think that's something to say for already. Just being you. If it were up to me, I'd say you were more than worthy."
The surprise on Aberforth's face was keener then, seeing Draco knew not just of the relationship but of its nature. "So it seemed. As gone on you as that Potter boy is, Black, I can assure you, it wasn't the half of Albus with
And finally, exhausted, he fell silent. And they sat that way for a while, together.
Draco snatched up his uniform and robes and ran for the bathroom, mind racing.
The four of them pretended to be asleep, to listen in on Dumbledore and Peter whispering above them. Much of what they shared was things Draco remembered from the blue loop, and he almost drifted off still eavesdropping on the teachers, until Severus's voice inserted itself and woke him up. "Have you any theory as to how he got in, Professor?" Severus asked Dumbledore, and Draco could see Potter lifting his head to listen more.
Lupin looked at their new captive, then at his students, safe and ready for defense against the darkest of arts. He turned to Black and touched Black's hollow, sunken chest, hand smoothing down over it. "Sirius. Oh, Sirius, I'm
"Did you read this?" was Draco's first question as he pocketed the letter, finally taking a sip of Valerian tea. Severus looked like the topic left a bad taste in his mouth.
Potter to get what you want to know. Perhaps you have not been spying after Sirius Black as I warned you against."
"Uh, Snakewood?" Theo tried weakly, staring at the entrance as if he was willing it to open. That was stupid. Hadn't Snakewood been one of the passwords last year? For some reason, it stuck out in Draco's memory-
"Okay." Sirius took a deep breath, then accepted the box from Draco and opened it. His handsome face fell open at the sight. "Oh," he said numbly. "Oh."
"That's the thing about having mates," Ron sighed. "Insufferable when they're dating," he jerked his thumb towards Luna and Neville, "And insufferable when they aren't." He jerked his thumb the other way towards the more morose Harry and Draco. "Remind me why we bother with this lot? Right, Apparition lessons from Frankenstein… no, I don't think even that could help."
"So this is one of your jealous fits?" Draco asked, trying not to laugh. He had bigger things to worry about than romance. But pretending to worry about it would suit him nicely, to quiet things he didn't want to think. "Over
"Did you like it? Having it at my neck?"
"It's okay. Don't worry, Gilderoy."
Draco ran forward too, with Luna trying to follow. Neville caught her and held her back, eyes fearful, while Remus took a place at Harry's side, grasping his shoulder and whispering quietly into his ear. Sirius stepped up beside Ron, in the way of Harry and any threat. Meanwhile, Percy made his more cautious way towards Scrimgeour, who was unharmed but certainly ruffled by the burst of magic Harry had let out, snow splattered all over him. He stepped aside from Percy's fussy attempts to wipe and pat him dry, looking absently repulsed by him.
"I saw Father put it in the Weasley girl's cauldron at the bookstore," Draco said all in a rush, "Behind her Transfiguration book. Like Potter said. But he didn't buy it at Borgin's, he was selling off artifacts because of Ministry raids, but I guess he didn't sell the diary with the others. I saw it last year too, in the same case in the Manor where I found Aunt Bella's wand."
to you? You need a wand."
became
That was twenty-seven people invited in total, which made this less of a secret, and more like a do-gooder convention. The only thing to be said from the unexpectedly large number was that at least there were enough Order members to offset the prevalence of a certain ginger family, and keep it from turning into a Weasley family reunion. The guests had arrived in prearranged Portkeys throughout the day, and Draco was wary of every single one of them, including himself. If Arabella Longbottom's iffy health had allowed her to be invited, he would even have been wary of her too. He managed to secure the list from Remus soon before the ceremony was due to start. The only real surprise had been Fleur, who had apparently been doing work with the Order, and had been approved as Bill's date. And Diggory, whom, after all, was Tonks's new prize protege.
"Phineas Nigellus Black."
Strangers. Draco had wanted to stay that way until he could ask Severus what to do, had rearranged their schedule to that end, and yet all his interference had done was ensure he met Harry Potter on the same fateful day. Except today he was pathetic. And you never got another chance to make a first impression.
"How are you this petty?" Draco demanded of his idol, at last losing any circumspection and giving vent to his disillusionment, because what was the point of holding back? What was the point of holding back anything, when he had nothing left to lose? "Are you really this childish? So they played a prank on you that almost got you killed. They probably bullied you too, who knows what else? But that was back in

Hey all! To address questions from the first part- first, I am not actually an Arsenal fan, but I am a huge football fan. I know some of the stuff about Arsenal from that, but it's also research, especially for stuff from back then. I picked Arsenal for the Grangers to support because it seemed likely with them being from Hampstead, as well as the old Arsenal stadium being in Islington. And it amuses me to make Draco wear red ^^
"By which he means take this excellent opportunity for testing our Indelible Ink invention-"
He didn't know how Potter could make himself just walk up like that, and the air of destiny was something swelling up unmistakably around him then. The awe almost crushed at Draco, as the Parseltongue came out of Potter's mouth this time without a failure. The serpents parted as the wall cracked open, the halves slid smoothly out of sight, and Potter, trembling but not looking back once, led Draco and Ron inside.
"I don't care."
Draco remembered Harry pressing a kiss to his cheek the last time they had seen each other, leaving school. Now those same lips said
"Ja," Krum answered, bemused. "Yes, I speak English as vell. How you know of that?"
Luna giggled. "So what does that make me now? Dangerous?"
"You should have stepped in right away-"
Not daring to look any of the Gryffindors in the eye, Draco pulled away from Hermione and raced after his father.
"UPSTAIRS! NOW!" Severus bellowed just as ferociously. At that, Draco did obey, grabbing Harry by the hand and sprinting towards the stairs. They could hear screaming as they made their way up, names spoken that shouldn't be, James and Lily and Lucius and Narcissa and Peter and Bellatrix and Voldemort like bombs dropped into what had been an idyllic spring holiday, but at least there were no curses or loud bangs of magic before Draco had them up inside his room.
- trained exclusively on Draco from the moment he entered with his master, to the point that as strange as his master seemed, Draco had difficulty paying attention to anything but the bird.
actually would... no, I would choose the cloak."
The stares of disbelief were not just for the Dark Lord. Many were for Harry Potter and Wormtail, famous, and famously dead and gone, and then for the one person in the graveyard not dressed in flowing black robes, whose bright hair made him unmistakable as a Malfoy.
Hermione gave him a shove out, upon which he was astonished to see Mr. Granger pulling his trunk out of the jaws of the beast, where he had thought it forever lost. "It gave my things back!" Draco called ecstatically. "Maybe it likes me!" Draco had learned in third year if nothing else to be more respectful to magical creatures. "There, there," he said, and stroked at the side of the beast. "Thank you. What a nice well-trained creature you are."
to open it. "Do... do you have the book with you? I'd like to read it."
"Um," Draco considered. "Yeah, pretty much. You wanted to be part of this, Ginevra Weasley, well, welcome to the show."
"Draco, is Mr. Potter here bothering you?" Severus had come back into the classroom. Draco knew his schedule well enough to remember the prep he would be starting, a second-year class with Slytherin and someone else, that began rather soon. Severus would need them out of the way, even if they hadn't also happened to be his favorite and least favorite student, perhaps both in the entirety of Hogwarts. At least, Draco liked to tell himself being Severus's godson gave him that privilege. And Severus had been taking the time to teach him some things during his detention brewing sessions, so he must like Draco a little. Even though Draco had robbed him.
Draco let Luna lead them as they ran, though he and the others became progressively tenser at the distant sounds of battle in the castle. "The Order of the Phoenix is here," Luna reassured them. "They and the professors, they'll hold back the Death Eaters, that's what the second message on the coin said- those are the orders while the students get out of Hogwarts, the DA is to protect the evacuation-"
her life." Draco nodded. "I didn't kill her," Aberforth said finally, after another long pause of unguessable thought, and slowly, eyes focusing on Draco again, his lips turned up in a smile.
"None of you lot," Draco said haughtily, "Have the least idea of what I'm capable of, do you? Perhaps it's time you learned."
"He could have been being framed," Draco offered, and wilted under Potter's stare. "What? That's exactly the sort of suggestion I
"You can do whatever you want with your hair," Harry said, an objectively laudable statement, and just about the last thing Draco wanted to hear out of those lips.
But Luna was happy to hand it over to Hermione, claiming she was the best speaker. "Future Minister of Magic here," Draco drawled, and Hermione looked embarrassed but pleased. He put away his own issue and reclined to cuddle with Luna as they listened.
Draco thought, elation spreading through him, though Potter had to be feeling rather abandoned. There was a loud thud, like that large shadowy shape was advancing down from its awkward entrance, and Draco scrunched his eyes shut.
"Vince," Draco breathed, "Greg, have you been slipped any strange potions recently?"
"So you like Seekers, do you?" Blaise said, with a knowing look Draco wanted to curse off his face, only to go suddenly silent then, his face contorting with distaste.
"I can feel them all in the distance, and it makes me colder, but I've gotten better at the Patronus charm, so I can protect you if they come, Draco... I'm useful for that, at least..."
before."
"Keeping us from being interrupted," Draco said, and stared at the dirty blond hair over Potter's forehead, falling over his pillow. He'd had Theo in his bed more than a few times in the Slytherin dorms, but in later years. And it was disturbingly easy to picture this familiar sandy hair now as unrulier and darker. "We can't have that, can we?"
"He needs all the protection he can get," Draco snapped, chest uncomfortably tight. "But I'm the only person anywhere
"You don't think it's a good idea?" Hermione said, looking so disappointed by his reaction, it was hard not to feel guilty. Harry's head lifted at that, as if looking for Draco to give him an excuse to bail out of it before it began.
"It's great, if Harry's willing to provide all you lot a real Defense education," Draco agreed, not wanting to dissuade them from a very worthy pursuit. "Salazar knows Umbridge won't. But you can't start a Defense Against the Dark Arts club with
"What if we have to, though? They'll never understand this. And they'll never forgive you two not telling them before she spent the summer here. They're freaking out. They won't want Hermione around any of us, not even me. I don't
There surely had been worse moments in Lucius Malfoy's life than having to admit Arthur Weasley into Malfoy Manor in the early morning by Floo, bringing his only son and heir covered in mud that failed to hide the pink satin of his pajamas. But Draco doubted it would be judicious to remind Father of any in front of Mr. Weasley.
"You're ready magically," Remus said with a fond smile, "But Draco, be sure your
"Do you know what day it is?"
When she showed Granger the boys' peace offering, she still harrumphed, but looked more mollified. On her part, she told him some ridiculous story about the three of them fleeing from Filch and finding some three-headed dog, which Draco wouldn't have believed if it wasn't Potter and friends. After a week had passed since the duel, though, she had gone quiet and resentful after her Gryffindor classes again, even with them working in the library on an essay for Transfiguration, one of her favorite subjects. "It's just that it happens to be my birthday," she whispered, failing to keep a hurt note out of her voice, "And no one, not even my parents, seems to have noticed."
Potter eyed him like this was proof Draco was plotting to reopen the Chamber of Secrets.
"A dragon," Ron said, scratching his head, which seemed a fairly good guess with Hagrid.
know," and she still sounded more perturbed by their pace than his line of inquiry.
"Alright, there we go," Draco said, finishing Harry's name before putting the quill back in the box. Sirius took it, but Remus held up a hand to keep Draco in place.
"You did this!" Potter gasped in Draco's face, backing him up until Draco's back hit the wall of the hospital wing. Potter was a bright crimson brand of righteousness in the stark neutral of the hospital bay, a wound across sterile white. "You left the match and went after her! You did this to her, to
you... if the vow Dantanian made really bound you, fully, wouldn't you have killed them at that time? I know you
Draco shoved the hemorrhaging red form aside with his foot, barely seeing him in his haste to drag a bloodied Sirius away. "Remus!" he called, and once he dragged Sirius down the hall and to the side, so far the body was out of sight, he did the same for Remus, tunnel vision on getting his uncles to safety. Then he fell gasping beside them, his last energies spent. "He was casting the Killing curse... the wands... here," he groaned out, and threw out all five wands on the wood before them to let them find their wands.
"Langlock," Draco agreed, and Ron and Potter bit the heads off their chocolate frogs at the same time. "So anyway, here, I think it's in my Charms textbook... here," he said, and produced the Polaroid of the Marauders, dropping it between them. "So the first thing you need to know is that this is your father, obviously, and this is Sirius Black, this is Remus Lupin, and this is Peter Pettigrew." The photograph got passed around, spending the longest with a wide-eyed Potter, who it seemed leading with a picture of his father had a salutary effect on. Draco spelled off the spots of chocolate before carrying on. "Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. Just like your map."
"Fine," Draco heard himself say. "Midnight. I'll meet you in the trophy room, that's always unlocked." And then he whirled around and stalked off, pleased to feel his robes billowing behind him in a way a bit like Severus's tended to. Not that he'd been practicing. Much.
"Hey, I was there too," Ron said with a grin. "You gonna introduce me or what?"
worse than this time last year, when she'd been the first name on the team sheet even before Draco's own, the unquestioned starting Keeper for the Kingsnakes. It was clear backsliding when it came to her skills, despite every appearance of dedication, and a set-up that suggested many night hours. With the likeness in their pride, Millie would probably hate pity more than even mockery for it.
Dobby looked worried he would have to shove his head in the oven for it a couple times, but eventually, he leaned down and slapped Draco's palm. Ron followed suit, and then surprised Dobby by gently slapping his palm too.
and Draco killing him for it. "Even once I knew I had been wrong."
He'd said the words last night, hadn't he?

"Oh," Hagrid said, looking further disappointed. "Yeh ain't come t'see the dragon?"
A soft noise came from lower down the table, where fellow Ravenclaw Lamia had been working on an essay by herself, cloak up and head down. It fell as she gathered her books and hastily walked away, exposing a face so swollen with tears it was nearly purple. Dantanian winced, then turned to give Dorian a truly contemptuous look. "I would have assumed you would have checked the immediate radius," he said icily, "Before repeating the news that's doubly ruined a girl's life, within a three-meter range of the girl herself."
- what were we talking about?"
"Really?" Luna said, brightening. "Will you tell me about it?"
Draco knew he shouldn't answer the way he did, but he told the unadorned truth.
(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock,
Malfoy is invincible! You'll get the dragon dick!
warned him, and he hadn't listened, and maimed his father and killed Theo's father before that very night was over.
But I wish he'd use that tongue on me.
"It's not that," said Luna. "I just met him on the train, and he seemed to need help..."
You may think that I am only the heir, not the lord, and I can't take on such power. But you must have seen me destroy Walburga's portrait. I have the power to end you on tapestry
Enjoy!
Harry pulled back from his vindictive little kiss looking sheepish. "Sorry," he said. "Sometimes the urge just kind of hits me, you know?"
wand didn't turn the Ministry into a warzone months early.
He could think of better candidates to have saved than Diggory, mind. Especially once he saw the champions' parents called to join them in the ceremony, taking their places behind Dumbledore, Bagman, Fudge, Maxime, and an extremely disgruntled Karkaroff. Photographers were coming out, Skeeter's blonde hair visible as she directed a pack of her own to get shots of Harry. Diggory, Krum, and Delacour shook hands with Harry with varying degrees of sportsmanship. Then Harry was directed to put the cup on a golden stand, which rose from the grass majestically.
"People from the Order have been following you, in case you haven't figured that out by now!" Draco snapped back, unable to keep his own volume from raising. "You're still what everyone's been concerned about, protecting you-"
"Draco Lupin Black," he read out, and maybe in time, that name would seem like his own.
"And you will not speak to me this way, Draco-"
," he insisted at her skeptical expression. "I
Harry ended up in Draco's bedroom at three that night, complaining of the idiocy of not letting him sleep up there, when it would be them woken up early in the morning to attend the hearing anyway. "Thank you for coming," he finally said, once he ran out of steam ranting. Draco chose not to say he knew why Harry was really so angry at his godfather.
"No, Draco, the cars are driven by humans," Hermione said, "And they see the stoplights and know when to stop and go. See these lights," she said, pointing to larger green circular lights that hung over the road, and Draco grimaced at them before approaching the machine warily.
Eventually, Severus made a snide comment about how Draco would be more useful pulverizing the black quicksilver for him, instead of merely pulverizing Lupin with his words-
"What I want is to know," Draco said with emphasis, "Is what you're so nervous to tell me."
Draco's steps took him right to the Astronomy Tower, where images assaulted him as usual of Dumbledore falling, but something in the warmth in his limbs put them at a distance. They no longer seemed to matter, compared to who would hopefully soon be coming.
Pansy made him a present in the first week after Creevey's petrification, an impressive silver snake pin with emerald-green eyes, which she claimed to have transfigured instead of bought. "What is this," Draco asked, turning it over in his hand, "Some kind of protective talisman?" The trade for amulets and such had gone hilariously through the roof at Hogwarts. "You transfigured this yourself?" It was a welcome surprise, that they might have a rare skill in common. It looked like she could teach him some things about carving silver, if she could only just leave off on all the-
Even Grindelwald let out a sound of pure astonishment as the black and red and brown and muck left the pit of reptilian brimstone and purity began to assert itself, of all things, an icy and unforgiving purity. Draco could feel the coldness of the water near him, radiating out its forbidding frozen glow near enough to his hand to threaten its own freezing. But it did not threaten to leave its circumscribed circle, because as the blood turned to water, it sunk. The stone itself creaked and gave way as the unnatural weight of the hellwater overwhelmed the aged stones of the fortress and made its own smallest of lakes, the clarity of the water soon asserting itself, until it mirrored the spiral staircase above it as perfectly as a mirror. Draco's one fear was that it would too quickly somehow freeze.
"I'm saying," Remus said gently, squeezing his hand harder, "That real happiness is something experienced by
"Sure," Draco said, trying to keep his voice level, but then Potter leaned in furtively and pressed a sneaky kiss to his cheek, before sprinting away and past the Fat Lady like he'd planted a bomb and had to escape the blast radius.
"I don't know," Draco bit out, an icy rage surging in him suddenly as he stared square at Pansy, finally able to meet her scrutiny with Luna and the first-years gone. "Why
What mattered was that the wand wasn't the problem. Draco was.
She lowered her voice, brown eyes shining wide and sad in the night. "They abused you, Draco, and neglected you. I don't know about wizarding law or opinion, Draco, but for Muggles, it's considered understandable, even defensible, to retaliate against one's abusers. The fact that you didn't do
he thought incredulously,
Draco fell gasping at the threshold. Severus came running out at a thud Draco's still-ringing ears could at least register now. Severus's dark-clad figure was like a Dementor, but somehow still the very vision of salvation, as Draco gasped out, "Hospital wing... tell them... potions accident, making- making the Wolfsbane..."
"The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Indeed, Mr. Weasley, this mirror shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts." Hearing the confirmation from Dumbledore's lips made Draco doubly curse the Potter staring back, as stubbornly if his face had replaced Draco's on his own body too. "However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible."
Please let him not have come to yell at Draco some more. Both his ego and his libido might not be able to withstand it. "Want to talk about your nightmare? Did you see the Dark Lord?"
"Draco Malfoy, have you lost your mind? You're going to be an Unspeakable!" he heard Granger yelling after him, but he didn't stop walking with a furious spite growing in his chest until he had reached the dungeons. He slumped on his bed, casting his usual Muffliato and Spelunca Secure, only to undo the second right away to get his copy of
"You're right, it's probably not my
It was even odds whether the prosecution would even try to press charges over Wormtail. The Ministry would produce eyewitnesses from the initial attack, but given the coroner's report about Wormtail's body, they might attempt to cut their losses and only indict Sirius formally for the death of twelve Muggles. Remus, though, thought that Fudge would lead the case himself, and accuse Sirius, in front of all the world, of
Sooner or later, everyone will choose a side in the coming war, and a wizard of your strength cannot hide when that time comes. My wish is to delay that time a little longer. For when you cannot... I
The rest of the Sorting passed unnoticed by Draco. Luna stroked his hair, letting him lean his head on her shoulder. He shut his eyes, until curiosity made him look in the direction of Gryffindor. He was resolutely pretending Slytherin didn't exist.
Taylor nodded. Once he had gone, Dantanian took back his necklace, and knelt before the Opaleye.
"We've got you now, Black!" he cried triumphantly, while Potter tried to stop them.
"Um," Draco said, and stepped as far back as he could while remaining behind the large stone griffin statue. "Well, yes, it is. Longer. Hair, it does that. Grows." And he liked to mock
The handwriting looked to be in blood, as was traditional. But it was a small, elegant, sweeping cursive nonetheless, as understated and refined as the writer himself. The words were another story.
"What about the visual appeal?" Ron joked. "Who's going to bring that without you?"
Draco felt a tug, like the pull of Avenseguim activated. He wondered if Harry had come to find him. He'd last cast the spell on the golden ring before the Third Task, naively thinking that even if Harry did end up kidnapped, there was no way Draco would be with him. He hadn't activated it himself, and he didn't think Harry would be wearing it. He hadn't seen it on his hand once since the graveyard. But he thought the pull might be Harry, so he followed. Even when he saw that it was leading him towards a closed ward, and he had to spell the doors open, he followed.
Even after she became suspicious of herself. Maybe she would have gone to someone for help if she had a friend in the world. Anyone she could trust but me. But it was me who she wrote to, up to this very morning, pouring out her heart. 'Tom, Tom, my love, what should I
Periander grabbed his shoulder. "You said that you would finish the ritual!" he protested, and Draco laughed again.
"I knew that you would go to any lengths to solve the mystery- particularly if another poor helpless little girl had been attacked. And Luna had told me you could speak Parseltongue...
rather take me on, Granger, I wouldn't mind," Draco drawled. "Seeing as you're the only one of your pathetic little do-gooder trio with
"It has happened," she told the silent staff room. "A student has been taken by the monster. Right into the Chamber itself."
"Well, you haven't finished it," said Potter triumphantly. "No one's died this time, not even the cat. In a few hours the Mandrake draught will be ready and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again."
"You were right to pick dittany," Severus informed him, and squeezed some of the leaves into a paste before carefully applying them by hand to the closed wounds. Draco bit back a gasp of further pain, and focused instead on the touch, the surreal physical proof that Severus was indeed alive and instructing him in Potions again, if he couldn't have that hug he had first imagined as confirmation. "You should have one of your friends apply it each night for a week, and then return to me to check it." Draco's ostentatious silence at that told its own story. "Too proud to show one of your friends these marks, Draco?"
." The small-cratered stone hollow opened out, into a larger hollow of darkness. "
He picked himself to his feet, looking around the room blearily, and reached for his wand to light it. He checked every pocket and he couldn't find it. Nor did he see any signs, strangely enough, of the other thing he remembered in this room beside himself, some kind of large silver mirror. Had he left his wand upstairs somewhere? Even by his own recent standards, losing his wand before a full day was gone since Potter gave it back was impressive.
There was some thudding sounds, and then Harry announced, "Okay, I'm ready."
first go around. She hadn't had the chances he had, hadn't gotten to step outside this enchanted snow globe world to see the blood beneath the roses, to breathe the air outside its confines. She had certainly never driven in a car, or used a toaster, or gotten to see a goal celebrated at Highbury. Pansy was not stupid or unusually close-minded. When she'd been the one to speak out to tell the school to turn Potter in to Voldemort, she had not been any more evil than anyone around her- any more evil than Draco was, even now. She just didn't know what he knew that had let him choose the winning side.
Draco stood back and let them bicker, Hermione trying to be law-abiding and the boys countering. Maybe Draco should have backed her up, but there would be no use, and this map really was too useful a resource to easily give up. Draco never would have handed it over to anyone else in the Weasley twins' situation. At least not without securing some substantial promise in return first, ideally enforced through an Unbreakable Vow.
"I'm not the kind of person, Harry," Draco said with put-on nonchalance, "Who's very interested in letting other people tell me what's okay or messed up to like. If you like it, I want you to
He could have told the truth, that he had been forbidden from leaving Malfoy Manor, but he leveled his most contemptuous stare at Vince instead. Unlike Potter and his new cronies, Vince had known him practically all his life, and unlike his parents, his pureblooded Slytherin acquaintances actually paid attention and listened to him. Best keep all the distance he could before Severus spirited him back to a time when Vince's ashes were somewhere indeterminate in this castle. "I had other things to do."
She played with the Ironbelly crossly. "I'm not wearing this, then, Frankenstein," she groused. "Not if the price is

He thought their dazed faces meant they had gotten far more Black trivia than they bargained for, until Potter pointed to the one blasted name he hadn't identified, mainly because he hadn't been completely sure. He strained his memory. "Oh, that was Cedrella, I think..."
big?" she persisted, and Draco pocketed his wand and hugged her.
"How is Theo?" Draco breathed miserably. "I know I don't have the right to ask. I wrote him so many letters I didn't send... Millie, will you tell him that I-"
"Dobby was afraid of this!" Dobby protested. "Dobby did not want to cause anyone trouble! Not Draco Malfoy or Kreacher! Kreacher is not a bad elf! He does as he was taught! He is faithful to his old masters. Do not punish him, Draco Malfoy!"
Draco talked on and on and on. He talked about Severus, about dark magic, about the dueling lessons and casting Protego Diabolica and Harry walking through the fire. He told her about hearing that Sirius and Remus wanted to adopt Harry but couldn't, and why, and how he'd stopped teaching Harry Occlumency because he hadn't wanted to help them. He told her about the deals he'd made with his father in the summers to be able to visit her. He told her about using the Imperius curse in second-year to save him, Ron, and Harry in the Forbidden Forest from Aragog. He told her how he practiced Unforgivable curses on spiders. He told her how he'd feared for Harry being kidnapped, and made a potion stealing his blood with Luna as his helper, and then kept on talking, to divert from that utter horror at the Naufragiam. He told her he'd been in love with Harry since the first time he ever saw him. He threw out quickly about his father making him see Periander, and casting Avada Kedavra for the first time.
When Draco went to Hagrid with the same concerns, Hagrid admitted he had been given no control even as Hogwarts' groundskeeper to curtail the movements of the creatures, before asking rather gloomily what Draco found to be the most charming points of Flobberworms.
When Harry refused to obey, Father stepped forward with clear frustration.
Granger tried to put on a brave face for a moment, and then her funny little squirrel face crumpled, and she produced
"How do
Harry couldn't avoid seeing Draco at their table, but he sandwiched himself between Weasleys, avoiding looking at him after that initial glance. When Draco asked Harry about his summer, for lack of anything else he could say in front of people, Harry just muttered, "Back to the Dursleys," and stabbed his roast chicken harder. At least he was eating, which Draco had been afraid he wouldn't. And he looked like himself, as handsome a figure as ever in his Gryffindor uniform, just quieter, with his eyes looking somewhere further away.
He woke up alone, but his yelling drew the attention of Madam Pomfrey, who hissed at him to hush or he might wake the Potter boy. "One would expect you to endorse the prospect of Draco waking him," said the best voice in the world, "Given the likelihood Potter will never wake at all."
"It was," Draco began, and blamed the sudden hot itchiness in his eyes on that awful dust. "It was... something, wasn't it, the Kingsnakes? You were brilliant, I mean it- we
He thought she looked more than pretty enough wearing the necklace he'd given her as an early Christmas present, a silver and diamond chain he'd bought, hung with a cascade spiral of his transfigured turquoise- not his usual mottled color, but the paler Robin's egg blue of Sleeping Beauty turquoise. He'd cast a temporary tracking charm on it with her permission, to make sure she didn't get dragged off anywhere awful in the Manor, and from the way Mother looked at her, he wasn't sure it was a frivolous precaution. When Mother walked in, clearly unhappy at him having a girl in his room, and nearly fainted at the sight of Luna, the distaste on her face would have made anyone nervous. Ever the consummate hostess, though, eventually she forced a smile and told Luna she had already picked out a dress of her own she would like to lend her 'son's new friend'
, or at least a place made for it. "Show me Maman," he said again, voice cracking. "I can't get her right."
"Draco could feed him a whole carton of the sawdust-flavored Every Flavor beans," Ron said none too softly to the girls, "And he'd eat them all up and ask for more..."
-" Millie shuddered like she needed an exorcism at the mere thought.
see her become the Minister of Magic someday, you know?"
Vince and Greg started attempting to give him some of their food during meals, which Draco at first took as some bizarre but sweet sign they'd missed him. Food was such a valuable currency with them, it seemed a way of showing affection. It was kind, if misguided given how many times a distracted Draco failed to finish his own plate. But after Draco had refused them one too many times, Greg leaned forward worriedly one dinner and whispered, "But won't the monster be getting hungry, Draco?"
"Okay," Draco said with a burdened sigh, "That's not how I'd put it. But what I think we should consider, Headmaster, is that Lockhart could be useful, if any of the story of his time at that hell castle is true. If you'd give me permission to leave Hogwarts in secret, I volunteer to interview him and assess his abilities to assist my guardians. And before you summarily reject my plan, I would think after the use
"Draco, you can just conjure us a non-flammable room, right?" Neville asked hopefully, and Draco regretted not having objected more strenuously to the common misconception that he had personally created the Room of Requirement.
Seriously, did they not realize he had been traded all of his flashy little powers for the duty to
yourself? Especially if the worst
And maybe he had to go about this more formally. "Dear Dantanian," he began, clasping his hands together over the wand. "I am your- your bondmate. Soulmate," he offered, though Harry invariably came to his mind, like it was some kind of betrayal. He might have even offered to break up with Harry, like he knew he should after what he had learned. But that felt still like a promise he had no chance of fulfilling. He'd sooner sear off his own hands. And they didn't even have any brands on them to expedite the process. "I am willing to bargain for- for contact. For information. I want us to work together."
"Quite a mess you left behind you," Draco said thinly. "But I suppose no one saw you visiting that secretive house."
"No, I wouldn't," Ron said quietly, but that seemed all the commitment he could muster.
"Oh," Draco said, putting away his wand, and Black did the same, a few long moments later. "Happy New Year, dearest uncle. Don't suppose they have fireworks in Azkaban for that. Another thing that place and Malfoy Manor have in common."
"Don't, he's fine, he's just embarrassed about Luna, give him some space," Draco hissed, not wanting to put Neville through any questioning and add insult to injury. He'd sworn not to tell anyone about Neville's misconception of the occasion, but Harry figured it out quickly with that much of a hint. The expensive peach roses hadn't exactly been subtle Gryffindor romance at its finest. Draco made noncommittal noises and kept just urging Harry to leave Neville alone.
"Antivenom. So whatever was added to the bites from Sade, it helps draw that out..."
"Touch me, please," Draco begged. When he shook and tried to grind against Harry's palm, the grip on his hip pinned him harder. "Harry," he groaned, tossing his head back, wanting Harry's mouth back on his neck. He wanted Harry all over him. "I'm not... ah, bordel de merde, not going to, ah, last much longer..."
to keep from losing skills- it likely hasn't been already-" She looked halfway to cursing him before he finished that sentence. "My Keeper deserves more than this."
"I already have," Draco said, and tapped his fingers on Theo's thigh. Theo shivered. "Now, I know you're curious, aren't you? Of course you are. I'm an extremely fascinating person." Theo didn't roll his eyes at that the way Severus would have, but the flash of his blue eyes was eloquent enough. "So... you remember about my wand, right?"
None of them spoke for a while. Luna was watching Hermione, waiting with her mind already made up, while a war waged on Hermione's face. Then Hermione stood up abruptly, a new resolution on her face. "Teach me," she said, voice both eager and reluctant. "You don't have to fight alone, Draco. If that's how you
He couldn't even tell if he had any control over the magic pent up in the talon wand anymore. It felt like there was no distinction between his wand and his hand, between the
Sirius's voice broke, and he pulled Remus's hands to his mouth and gave them each a hard kiss, eyes senselessly adoring above them. Remus's face had frozen in complete shock. Draco couldn't read it.
"In ten years," Draco hissed before he could stop himself, "I probably won't be alive, and you won't be either." Severus rolled his eyes, seeming to take this as more of his godson's usual vain dramatics, but Draco's mouth wouldn't stop running. "I'm not upset because I lost at the Quidditch Cup, Severus, I'm upset because I lose at
"Sirius!" Remus snapped, and pulled his hand out from under the table where they'd been holding hands. "That can wait. Draco has been through enough today-"
Theo screamed, grabbing at his blinded eyes. Draco was reminded with a pang of grim satisfaction of the sight of the Basilisk in Harry's memories, though he almost missed the streams of red coming down from those eyes.
The two tents in the area marked off for
"Oh, but you fear me, do you not?" Voldemort purred. "Well you should, little one. Were you not your father's son, I would have ordered you killed as the spare, had you struck dead where you stood. But you may serve more use for me yet. Oh, we shall see..."
. The decision is yours. It has always been yours. Do I think the boy deserves to so much as kiss your
"No, Ron, it's Draco,
Harry's hips moved again, athletic and strong, spurring their excitement higher, and Harry's hands went to Draco's hair like they so often did, tugging it to expose his neck entirely. "Say it again," Harry demanded, each word dragging his teeth right over the pulse point. "Say it. Say you love me."
- and Severus silenced him with a glare. "You may find this news upsetting or gratifying, or simply inconsequential, I know not which. Whatever you find it, it will affect your purchasing of paraphernalia regardless. Surely you have reflected that your place in a dorm with Theodore Nott is an... uncomfortable one. Dumbledore's solution-"
"Were you ever picked on or bullied at Hogwarts?" Umbridge asked, and Luna had to say yes. "Did your cousin Draco intervene to put a stop to it?" Luna had to say yes to that too. "Were you friends with the other students here first, or was your cousin?"
Draco had been tensed for the worst, every muscle in his body tight with painful expectation, but he could barely hold back an eye-roll at that. That often came out around now, Father's patently false claims they were direct descendents of Salazar.
do- and I've changed too much already- I don't know what's coming really now- there's my aunt, there's-" Theo came to his lips after the word aunt. Then
When Ron and Hermione were paying for their sweets, Potter pulled Draco to the side to show off more, seeming nonplussed at Draco's lack of reaction to his feat sneaking to Hogsmeade. "Do you want to see how it works? We can see where your godfather is right now if you want."
They overlay in his mind with the Wheel of Hecate and each treacherous seven-pointed star, once virtually his symbol now turned against him, as he should have known Hecate well might in the end...
It was a greatest hits medley from there on out, only special mentions of the most and least deserving. Only Father and Nott and Crabbe and Goyle were of any particular interest to Draco. He drifted again until Voldemort arrived at the largest gap. Try as he may to tell himself not to let any panic into this distant sardonic haze, observing a farcical set of proceedings that had nothing much in the end to do with him, he could hardly not stare at a space that represented his godfather.
could be misheard as
All three stared at him blankly for a while, until Mr. Granger started to laugh. "Oh, you mean when I gave you a high-five?" Draco squinted at him doubtfully, and Mr. Granger raised his hand. "Sweetheart, give me a high-five," he said, and to Draco's appalled shock, Hermione went over and slapped at his palm, the way Mr. Granger had at Draco's. "See, people do it all the time. It's a way to congratulate someone or show you're on the same team."
"Stop calling me that," Draco said in a small voice. "I preferred 'burdensome'. Anyway, I just need to know one thing. What you did at Nurmengard, protecting me and Harry and all, you can't excuse that away as keeping up your cover, can you?" Severus shook his head curtly. "So you've been exposed to the Death Eaters."
"I've still got ten Galleons," she said, checking her purse. "It's my birthday in September, and Mum and Dad gave me some money to get myself an early birthday present." She lifted her bracelet, shining African turquoise in the sun, to make clear what present she expected from Draco.
"Severus!" Draco wailed, and tried to fling himself into Severus's arms. Severus leaped out of his armchair and retreated behind it to prevent his godson's display of affection, but he was unable to completely hold back a smile as Draco just kept waving his arms going, "Severus! Severus!"
"How many will be Miss Granger be taking?" Severus asked silkily.
"Yes!" Sirius exclaimed. "Have you listened to a word we've said?"
"Draco," Hermione said, with a resolute sigh, "I can handle this myself."
Wormtail turned with fading hope in his eyes to Hermione. "Sweet girl... clever girl... can't you see they're going to kill me... help me..."
"'You're that Chosen Potter who slayed a Basilisk!'" Draco hummed into his ear, before pulling back with a devilish grin. "What, Potter? I think the world deserves to know!"
"The night of the Third Task?" Harry breathed. "What did she predict?"
"Oh," Theo said, unimpressed. "So the world indeed does revolve around what Harry Potter likes."
"What-" Phineas paled so substantially, it gave rest to any insidious suspicions Draco had mulled over, whether the memories had been false. "What- you- you have no evidence of this!"
"The Order- many of the Order, hurt, badly," Neville panted, voice audible as they neared, only a handful of steps from each other. "The castle... unconscious, lots of the members- still fighting there, could only find- Sirius and Remus, I found- fighting at my parents' side- told them- they insisted to come-"
"He's going to feel abandoned, you know," Draco said heavily, and Remus shook his head.
The reception the team received as they walked out onto the frozen grass made the resolution strengthen in him. He had expected the boos and hisses that greeted their arrival, in contrast to the deafening cheers that greeted the team of reigning Gryffindor champions, featuring no less than Harry Potter. But it seemed louder and nastier than usual. There was less of the answering cheering from the Slytherin section to drown it out.
"I'm the outsider and you know it! But no, you just have to have them all to yourself! And the one time they actually cheer for me, you give them this much backlash?"
"I think it's a Black Dagger," Millie said nervously. "It's some old pureblood thing- look, it's real obsidian, I think- it's a demand, or a declaration of blood feud, or blood feud if you don't meet the demand- it's called
Harry rolled his eyes. "Draco, there are literal scorch marks on the walls."
"Father threatens it all the time, of course," Draco said, and his nonchalance earned him an incredulous stare. "Don't worry, he can't, not without a replacement. I'm luckier than Sirius was. No little brother as a spare."
"No," Draco said, rolling his eyes, and went to his bed to get paper. "Here, one second. It's for Hermione Granger, okay? Please knock on the door, and tell whoever comes to take it to her right away, that she'll be angry and tell them off if they don't. Please, Theo."
Meaning that Draco could produce snakes to choke the life out of you for the fun of it, while Ron was sometimes hard-pressed to produce his own
Successful? He had spent a lot of time flying with Viktor Krum.
Get out of bed before I am forced to physically remove you."
Potter let the strand loose, before curling it back round again, thumb smoothing over Draco's cheek. "Aside from the Quidditch? He said that both of us are brilliant, but that because we're so brilliant, we're always so stubborn and convinced we're right, we miss what's sitting there right in front of us."
"Hey," Draco said, feeling seven sets of eyes turn on him. "What is everyone looking at me for?" Potter was the one to lift his head and answer, his eyes going colder on the pathetic man at the end of his wand.
, Draco!" she said, as if she expected him to know the word. "She told me that whatever you've been given will be taken back, and
After dinner ended, Kreacher shuffled in reluctantly to help with the clean-up, as did some of the students. Draco was shooed out of the kitchen after breaking two dishes, but in his defense, it was his first attempt to wash any dishes, by hand or magic, in his natural life. But Harry said he'd had to wash the dishes all the time for his Muggles, and he got sent out for breaking one as well soon after Draco. It seemed that not incompetence but distraction was the culprit there.
Draco would have preferred Severus, for the greater honesty and trust he could have exercised. Not to speak of his own personal history with Dumbledore in the blue loop, and the man's overall notorious favoritism towards Gryffindors. But Dumbledore had been bizarrely kind when he found Draco cursing the Mirror of Erised, and awarded Draco all those points for selfless courage, so maybe Draco could trust him to hear him out. And Potter wasn't budging.
"I see you did listen to our discussion earlier this year, about the merits of Sectumsempra over Avada Kedavra. Although at times, a Stunning spell will suffice, and prevent-"
"Professor Lupin, no- don't- give me that," Draco protested in vain, as he leaped out of bed and Remus held it easily out of his range. He handed it back after he was done, looking thankfully nothing but amused. Draco sagged down in embarrassment. "I'm sorry, Professor, I thought you were Hermione..."
made his blood go cold.
. Remus would have told him if it hadn't actually been Avada Kedavra, right?
"That's Ariana," Severus observed distractedly, "Dumbledore's sister-"
Eventually, Draco got out of Greg that Theo thought Umbridge would apply her new rule to the Slytherin Quidditch team. "Don't worry, she'll give us permission to re-form right away." He remembered that from the blue loop quite clearly.
"Fine. Let's make a bet," Weasley said. "If we're right, and Snape really is after the Stone, then what should we ask for, Harry?"
"Oh, my
Then they stopped talking, nothing but lips and wandering hands, making out like there was no tomorrow until with a call of "Sanguirenere!" the door to their room opened, and Sirius, Remus, and Severus all rushed inside.
"Yes," she said slowly. "Yes, this is my baby's hand. This is my baby. This is our boy, Frank."
"This is only really important," Hermione said, "For what it has to do with Pettigrew's death. See, what happened was that Draco found out that Sirius Black didn't really kill him-"
Nine names, he had his nine names, nine or more, he couldn't die here when he still had those names-
"Go ahead," Draco said, waving a hand imperiously, as if it was up to him to grant permission. He let himself drift while Severus explained. Draco dozed, only half-hearing Severus as he updated them about attempts to replace it at Ollivander's, and the burning brand the wand became in hands it viewed as its enemies.
Draco thought that harsh, but he remembered his adventures with the wall in front of Severus's fireplace, the Mirror of Erised, and a certain other mirror before that. He had to concede the boy had a point. Draco was a bit too liable to throw curses first and ask questions later.
Harry's pupils dilated, green eyes darkening, but he only dignified that sensual memory with a mutter of, "Evil dragon. Just do it."
"So this is something specific to Castell de L'Infern," Draco concluded, "And not transferable to Nurmengard."
Percy Weasley, coming up to take his place near Fudge's side, did a double and then a triple-take at the watch. So did a number of the press and the Wizengamot, recognizing the custom piece that Fudge had worn daily for years. Fudge himself nearly lost his balance in front of everyone from jumping so angrily to his feet. But he could only stand there impotently, at the spectacle of the prisoner he wanted to condemn, flaunting his own trademark at him.
"Except you, sir?" Draco asked in a small voice, and Severus rolled his eyes and nodded.
. He could detect a similar lack of enthusiasm in his fellow Slytherins, for a new professor who in their eyes happened to be a famed Auror too familiar with their parents as well. Really, Dumbledore's Defense hiring policies...
"Never and always my muse," he whispered to himself, too softly for Dorian to hear. Then he stepped away.
"Stolen," Draco hissed without thinking, "Stolen power," hand tightening around his wand in his pocket. He grinned wider at her confused look. "It's just my wand, Professor. That's what makes me seem so special. I just have a wand with more power than anyone else."
"No, Luna, you'll die," Draco gasped, and Hermione seized him from behind and pulled him and Harry away, back to the others. "Not Fiendfyre-"
. And when and why exactly have you and Miss Lovegood already used up all of the Felix Felicis?"
that has a personality of its own- a magic that chose Bellatrix and has now chosen you. A jealous magic, it would seem, by your father's rendition of your Squib-like performance with any other wand."
"Hermione," Draco said, very awake now for all the wrong reasons. A lump had come into his throat, threatening to make him lose his composure. He could see tears in her eyes already. "We're not growing apart as friends, I promise. I don't like you any less as a person-"
"You see why I didn't want any of you to have to read that?" Draco said wryly, once Hermione had lowered his father's letter about Bellatrix, voice going quiet. "Now I've ruined Dobby's birthday party."
all the Dementors. I spent some months in Azkaban before my trial."
"At Durmstrang, it is cold much more of the year. Ve vould not be able to do this without much heavier robes in November." Viktor went over to the Hogwarts broomshed, where apparently he had been keeping his own Firebolt, and looked at least respectful of Draco's Nimbus 2001. Clearly, he'd been practicing out here sometimes as well, with Karkaroff's assistance no doubt.
, and I know it's stupid, and I hate it! I don't want to
"Yeah," Draco said, "I wouldn't. I'd kill my aunt if I had the chance. I'd kill your
"Oh, come on, if I was going for that, don't you think I would have kept the dark lord in training look intact?" Draco demonstratively fluffed his restored hair in its shorter, blonder glory. He was gratified to see Harry's eyes tracking it the closest, as they indeed had in periodic, furtive bursts since he arrived. Ginny had done a good enough job making him look like before, it seemed, for the boyfriend of before to take note.
The girls exchanged glances. "No," said an unfamiliar blonde girl. "What did he look like?"
!" Harry snorted and splashed him again for good measure. "I am not one of your Weasleys, to engage in snow or
So he had accomplished his goal, with no one the wiser. Harry never even asked him what he'd needed the invisibility cloak for. When he returned it, he was more interested in grilling Draco on the new Slytherin line-up. Bizarrely enough, he claimed to have followed Draco's orders this time not to spy on his Quidditch practices, which almost hurt Draco's feelings. Didn't Harry fancy him at
heir to House Black! Let me in! Let me in! Dignusanguine!"
It was all whirling through Draco's head, the ways this could have been averted, the times he should have forced his way back into Theo's life, to talk, to scream, to hurt, to beg if necessary, to avert this. Anything and everything he could have done that he hadn't. "It was you- Periander and Maledictum's grave."
"Yeah." Draco poked Harry's shoulder. "Don't be bitter I knew before you. He just needed me to help with the Black family tapestry- he wants to put Remus on it... you know I'm not really trying to take him from you. They can care about both of us, it doesn't have to be a competition..."
"And the eclipse," Draco said eagerly, watching the moon be blotted from the sky, and the mountains turn more and more into mere silhouettes. "Is it really such a magical night, the lunar eclipse?" He enjoyed on a visceral level the sight of uneven blasted stone outlining the progressively more shadowed sphere of the moon, the dust of rubble beneath like he had only just begun the work of bringing castles down. "I have the branches."
"What do you mean, her name?" Dorian asked.
"What do you mean, Dorian and Lamia?"
"I-" Draco expected his tongue to lock up whatever he did, but not denying it would be as good as an admission. "I'm not." The words came out feeble, but he hadn't expected them to go from mind to tongue at all. He presumed that usual seizing sensation would come if he tried to
As for the pickled myrrh, myrrh was easy enough to order by owl post in the same way, but Draco had to make a trip to the Manor's stores for more equipment and pickling solution as well, to say nothing of the top-quality mercury-like black quicksilver they needed. The higher the quality of the metal, Severus had told him, the more foolproof the potion. The other components were easier to get by on less potent or fresh ingredients, but not the black quicksilver, which held the whole mixture together.
Draco's father
"Hagrid is not going to let you two use his hut to hook up!" Potter yelled, loud enough for everyone in earshot to turn around in shock, and Draco buried his head in his hands. And here he'd thought he'd successfully escaped the non-date without any real humiliation.
"Fine," Draco muttered, wanting to cause a scene in front of a smirking Blaise even less than he wanted to talk to Diggory, who he was pretty sure he could take in a duel if it came to it.
There was another door behind the white pieces. It was all like some macabre version of a children's game. The only real question was whether death awaited for anyone who lost.
"Can we visit the hospital wing?" Draco asked anxiously, and ignored the looks of annoyance and disgust he'd earned. It wasn't like they hadn't already seen his tear-swollen face.
He'd dried the nightshade and Niffler's fancy leaves in anticipation of this night, but he had to chop them now. His hands were shaking, whether in new nervousness or just aftershocks of the panic attack Harry had made him have, there was no telling. He forced himself to calm down, telling himself he had all night if need be. He mixed them, added them to the cauldron once the tincture finally began to steam, and here came the valuable parts. He had a spare Witch's Ganglion, but only one. He'd never used one of these before, they were more common in Asia, and it felt almost sacrilegious to just chuck one in whole, but that was what the recipe said, nothing about chopping. Then in went the Acromantula venom. It said to stir vigorously, as the last instruction before boiling it on low for a month. He'd have to check it daily, to make sure it hadn't gone off completely, and really, the invisibility cloak would have been useful. Maybe he should start making more visits to Hagrid as a cover to be out here...
"He was just dying to make you fail, I'd bet," Sirius began heatedly, "Doesn't want to see us happy, doesn't want you near his godson-" But astonishingly, Sirius seemed to master himself, enough to take the heat from his voice and backtrack to a more mature, Remus-like stance. "That is, I used to think, but I'm sure he was fair now. He's a good godfather to Draco. He wouldn't sabotage Draco's family. That is- was he fair?"
And so it was. The ceiling was star-painted, turning it at night to more of a planetarium. The midnight blue carpet was in perfect condition, a stark contrast with the polished but uncovered dark stone of the dungeons. It seemed airy, but unlikely to get nearly as cold as the dungeons. There were a number of Ravenclaws gathered around the fireplace nonetheless. They looked up to stare, and Draco ignored them to survey his new domain.
"Who first told you to doubt the guilt of Sirius Black?" Umbridge said, in a sad tone like this poor little girl had been monstrously deceived.
"You love that thing more than me," Harry joked, but Draco chose to take him seriously.
curiosity. "So yeah, it
And then the Snitch escaped his grasp and flew downward.
He soon didn't mind the cold and discomfort of the hard floor. Azkaban had bred out a certain level of his old sensitivity to creature comforts, and any distraction was welcome from his own thoughts. He poured out an entire bottle of brandy, because it had been Vince's favorite. He watched it trickle between the stones in rivulets over the gaps and mortar, certainly more beautiful than anything in Azkaban in the enchanted candlelight. He found that if he drank quickly enough, he could keep himself from thinking at all.

compete. Everything will get sorted out fine."
Please inform Father that the prolonged length of my Sorting was due to the Hat's difficulty in choosing which house best befit my many virtues. The hat told me, and I quote, that I was difficult to place because I had not only the courage of Gryffindor but the discernment and clear thought of Ravenclaw, the faith and good-heartedness of Hufflepuff, and the ruthlessness of Slytherin. After taking the time necessary to catalog my many astonishing merits, and remarking on my great potential in any pursuit I shall take, he agreed to submit to my superior judgment and to send me, of course, to Slytherin.
"S-sorry," Neville gasped. "I haven't tried that before... didn't realize it would be quite so... don't worry, though, Stinksap's not poisonous..." It had better not be, given that Luna seemed to have ingested a fair quantity.
Incredibly, with a tight nod, Father led them out with a sharp hiss of
The grand reward of Draco's interference in poor Aberforth's case was increased prominence and his own personal self-destruct button. This was getting better and better. Trust the war to be going more smoothly when Draco was actively trying to sabotage Hogwarts, than now when he meant to help it.
blood was the more pertinent question. Draco had almost never met a person better at being underestimated than Remus Lupin.
"By persuasive, you mean what?" Draco rolled his eyes. "Threats? Bribery? Sexual favors?"
"Did you notice the dragon decal was missing?" Draco asked weakly, turning to face his father. Of course he had, the thing was on Draco's bloody door. He didn't know why he hadn't thought of that before it was too late. "And the pictures?"

"He's
After the Quibbler's publication, everyone knew Harry was capable of casting fireball spells. The twins had never seemed more impressed with him, but that also meant that the first time DA met after the article, congratulations and applause were quickly followed by obnoxious requests to see Harry Potter throw fire. "It's, um, something probably too difficult for us to learn here," Harry said weakly, "And, er, far too dangerous, right, Hermione?" She nodded primly. "So maybe we can go over Patronuses again today..."
"I'm not!" Draco yelped. Did Harry not

still belong to him..." He glanced at Mother, who nodded grimly, "And may have the means to connect to any other Black lodgings or possessions."
"You know," Draco said shakily, "I promised Severus I wouldn't eat any meals in the kitchen with the elves again. But I think this qualifies as an emergency-" And then Severus's gaze came down to pierce him like an arrow from on high, a message that didn't need Occlumency to communicate,
he told himself.
"Are you sorry for trying to embarrass me, bringing up humiliating memories?"
"What happened?" the Healer gasped. "The lights went out... oh, Alice, you're
"Well, Professor Flitwick," she managed to get out, though her usually ruddy face had gone pale. "Your student is... adequate
"Oh," Pansy said uncertainly, scuffing her shoe against the wall. "You're going home?"
He heard Severus draw in a sharp breath, sounding more surprised than Draco would have expected. Then, he supposed that Father had never been so immoderate as to deliver such a beating anywhere close to Draco's returns to Hogwarts. Strange as it was, he had only once turned to Severus for help with an injury, and Draco hadn't had much to do with being saved from Potter's curse, just laid there and tried to die. "What caused these?" Severus asked with a briskness Draco appreciated.
"Veritaserum," he blurted. This he had actually brewed before. In the summer after Dumbledore's murder, the Death Eaters had set Draco to filling their stores of it, with Severus far too busy and important to do it. He had failed at it so many times in a row back then, he'd thought they would call Severus in to do it instead. But Aunt Bella had just taken it upon herself to personally punish each failure, and it hadn't taken many more tries to get it right.
The first hitch to studying came deep in the night, when Ron was trying to get comfortable and found a balled-up Gryffindor tie under the pillow of Draco's bed. "Hey, what's this?"
He sat down between Harry and Hermione that night at supper, with cordial nods to Molly and Bill Weasley nearby, and took the anxiety off Harry's face with a beaming smile. "What's with you today, anyway?" Hermione whispered skeptically. "You've been acting so
And from the dopey look on the boy's face, Draco seemed to have rendered Krum instantly in love with her. "Striker?" he echoed, looking enamored, and then cleared his throat. "Herm-own-ninny," he tried, and Draco shook his head. It took about three dozen tries and corrections, but finally, Krum slowly pronounced some respectable semblance of
"Yes, sir," Draco said, and closed his eyes before casting, "Herbivicus." Without a conscious dam on his magic, the charm worked faster than he expected. Or perhaps it was something in those golden seeds, which turned quickly to a string of golden roses, curling around the chain in the entwining motions Draco made with his wand. He sent one stem up through the right side of each link, another through each left, and a third to entwine all around the base of each chain and pull.
"Do you like it, sir?" Draco finally asked meekly.
Luna stepped forward and kissed him, bouquet falling from her hands unnoticed. Neville was tall enough that she had to strain up on her tiptoes, hands planting on his chest, as her messy light hair fell in a wave down her back. Neville's hands went to stroke through it and cup her face as he kissed her at first gently and reverently, like she
, didn't they?
Hi all! It's totally okay to make fanart for the series, I love to see it! And memes! The memes were so awesome ^^
, Draco thought, and wondered if a listening Potter or his friends would finish that sentence in their minds as well. Not that they would ever believe it.
Ron blinked at them in confusion. "Crikey, Hermione, calm down. What the hell?"
Harry had said Draco was the only thing that made him feel safe this past summer, but it was the opposite for Draco. Nothing made Draco feel less safe, turned agitated and off-balance, nothing made Draco's mind unravel and his plans go up in smoke the way Harry Potter did, the way he always had. No one made him angrier, no one made him feel so weak in the knees, no one made him hurt like this, no one made him want like this. Maybe no one ever would. There was only Harry, standing there before him, eyes wide and expectant on Draco's for them to give the answer, when there was not and would never be an answer...
"I knew it," Severus groaned, pocketing his wand and staring fixedly at the empty wall in extreme dislike. His hands were clenched to fists in a visible effort of self-repression. "I knew
"Two weeks, Draco?" she said with a frown, and Father's next bite into the English muffin of his eggs hollandaise came out as particularly crunchy.
Draco put on a pitying expression. "Weasley, I'm genuinely trying to be civil here right now, but do you really want me to explain why I would assume Potter is the one who could afford something as rare and expensive as that?"
And he didn't
Dumbledore's face fell, for so slight a moment that Draco might have imagined it. Blink and Dumbledore was fully smiling. "I do. I confess myself rather an admirer of Greek myth-"
Draco was late to the Hogwarts Express. He arrived at Platform 9 and 3/4 unattended, though Mother had defied Father enough to surreptitiously push two vials of numbing potion into his pocket before letting him go. He took one, downing it unceremoniously from the small silvery vial the second he was through the barrier, able to reflect once the pain grew less bracing that if he really had been a first-year new to all this Muggle chaos, it would have been impossible to make it on time.
Draco half-heartedly tried to say, but, of course, Langlock. So he said instead, "I've studied these things, because I'm going to be an Unspeakable." Then he lowered his voice sheepishly. "And I did use to be kind of obsessed with all forms of dragons and reptiles as a child. I know you remember that." He had known pretty much everything about Basilisks, along with a dozen other such snake-like magical creatures, back in second year the first time. Somehow he just hadn't connected the dots.
Draco ran over to Sirius, pulling him forward and then pointing at his throat. With an eye-roll that was again beautiful and right to witness, and another "Finite incantatem," Sirius's tongue popped back out of its lock and left him gasping for breath, wide-eyed as if they had taken his hand and were trying to drag him tugging him bodily up out of hell.
Anyway, enjoy! <3
than a Dementor."
September 9, 1995
"Yeah," Draco said, trying to put an arm around Hermione's shoulders, which she immediately shoved off, looking red-faced and miserable. He flicked the H on her bracelet before carrying on. "See, you've caught me. I just put on the whole gay thing to cover up that I'm in love with a Muggleborn- my father would never accept our love- we come here every night to consummate our wanton passion-"
Fair enough. "I said I was told that," Draco said mildly. "Never said I was any good at living by it. But for the record, nobody's going to be saying
"Where are we going?"
Harry's gorgeous eyes darkened before he seemed to make himself look away. "I can't help the effect you have on me, you're
Hermione's basic French didn't let her miss the meaning of that, he could see it in her eyes, but she had the grace to pretend she didn't understand him.
is Malfoy Manor?" Potter breathed in disbelief, as if his real first sight of the manor hadn't been as a prisoner taken in by Snatchers, his face hexed almost beyond recognition. "This place? You live
"I don't know anything for sure," Draco sighed, closing his eyes. "But Harry had better tell
"I..." Draco began, and found his throat dry, and words drying up even worse, in the face of that soft steadiness of Theo's, when he could not have felt more unsteady. "I don't have your shirt. I'm sorry. I think it's ruined."
Draco slept early then, for a long time. He was half-woken by his dormmates, trying to alert him it was breakfast time, and then by Dobby showing up. Dobby told them Draco was ill again and needed rest. He tried to speak to Draco, but eventually just left food outside. Draco knew he should get it, but he found himself just going back to sleep, not convinced enough that anything was not a dream to make it worth it to act.
Draco could not afford the silence, at least not from himself. "Well," Draco said, purportedly to Theo, but loud enough to be sure the entire hall heard him. "Better late than never, to get a Christmas present from your favorite aunt. I'll have to send her a snow globe."
"Tell my parents I love them!" Neville called over to Dean before they left the Great Hall.
She shifted back the knife to toss Lockhart at Severus's feet, unceremoniously launching him and ending in a pained cry. Lockhart landed in an undignified heap there, hand once freed at the neck gone instinctively to his wand pocket, but then it slumped out of it dejectedly, seemingly remembering his immersion in the hellwater. So he had no choice but to sit there and wait to see whether he would be tortured by the man he loved. How circular the world could become.
"Listen," Draco growled, "You're wrong, but it doesn't matter. I am the captain, and that's not going to change. For everyone who's tired of all this whining and carrying on like a bunch of first-year
Draco's excitement for the trip only lasted until he and his father made it to Knockturn Alley. The dark, narrow street conjured up images of Death Eaters filing inside Borgin & Burkes, to step through the vanishing cabinet into Hogwarts- not that he'd been there to see it, but the picture hit him with all the force of a memory, once Father insisted Draco go inside with him.
"You'd probably be happier if you didn't."
My father has not yet had me killed, or worse, disowned, despite your best efforts to the contrary. It might also interest you to know, I am sure to your great surprise, that I was never and to this day remain
"Undo this!" Father bellowed, "You wicked bastard child-"
"Theo," Draco said intently, "Theo, listen to me, I didn't mean for you to hear that."
Luna left with her father before midnight, along with all the other guests but Tonks. With Tonks, there, though, the party was only beginning, as she, Bill, Sirius, and Remus sat by the fire drinking. The Weasleys and Hermione were in the near vicinity, playing a prediction game for the year called 108 Sins, based off the Japanese tradition. Tonks had bought it for everyone, but seemed more interested in drinking, so the students had inherited all 108 of the small enchanted bells.
ask the Hat to give you Gryffindor?" Harry asked apropos of nothing, cutting Ron off mid-sentence. Ron opened his mouth in protest, and Hermione just held up a hand.
While the Weasleys and Hermione dropped in every few nights or so, Harry came to watch dueling practice nightly without fail. He took each time to make obvious his resentment he was not included, though it was hard to tell whose place he would have liked to take.
"For his own reasons. He said it was for my own good, but..."
adopt you. But I will apply to as well, Draco. I want you to consider
. He forced himself to pay attention to Shacklebolt telling Severus of the Aurors' experience with Lockhart.
Draco considered. "We're planning this horrid quadruple date thing, for Valentine's Day," he said thoughtfully. "Me and Harry, Ron and Hermione, Neville and Luna, Dean and Ginny. You and a date of yours would liven things up."
him there-"
If they asked Draco if Severus was loyal, he would have to tell them the truth-
The rest was as the newspapers told, with Lockhart's habit of self-aggrandizing a distant memory. Maybe the results of bragging about castle-building skills had helped beat out some of his taste for it. If anything, Lockhart made himself sound
"Draco," Severus said, pushing him back to stare in dismay. "I came as soon as I heard." His gaze traveled to stare balefully at Potter. "I see Mr. Potter has once again been getting you into
Then he broke off the same words he always spoke, lifted his wand, and hissed desperately out of nowhere, "Expecto patronum!"
Thanks so much for all of your kind messages of concern and understanding, they've really helped me. Thanks to everyone, and I hope you enjoy.
Death was in the air, like the ice crystal chill in high winter air that foretold snow.
Draco had not thought so far ahead as to what would follow, but Luna had. "Verniculpa! Verniculpa!" she cried out, and even after the time spent teaching her, Draco honestly didn't expect it to work, not during the pressure of the moment. But apparently even he hadn't learned what even the Death Lord had failed to reckon at his own peril- never underestimate Draco's cousin.
Draco had thought Dumbledore might incinerate or Vanish the letter. "I have copies, of course."
be the Heir of Slytherin plotting the downfall of all non-purebloods, to have this level of irredeemable evil in my heart."
"Style over substance can be excusable in a man," Father said, lip curling, "But only if it is in
Luckily or unluckily, this line of inquiry was interrupted by the arrival of an owl, with a letter Draco opened eagerly once he recognized the handwriting on the outside. His grin widened as he read the opening words,
"No," Tony said, watching him with that analytical look again. "Go ahead."
"Would you rather watch Ron crash and burn?" Luna asked brightly. "I'd rather not. It would be rather embarrassing otherwise, this hat."
. Rather than answer, he dropped the sack he had taken from the Potions storeroom and cast Evanesco, losing his haul but destroying any evidence in the process. As if Draco had needed any more evidence of ill intent. Then Theo met Draco's gaze with a stiff nod before brushing past him.
"They all know about the wand, Dobby," Draco sighed. "Tell them what happened."
Draco leaned against Remus's side and listened, absorbing more of Remus's comforting tone and presence than anything. The information registered, yes, but the greatest relief was to be near Remus's calm self-command again, so different to anyone he had ever met. He could trust in Remus's wisdom, but more than that, he could trust in Remus's goodness. If he was in Remus's protection, doing what Remus thought was right, he was surely not forsaken. Not unforgivable.
?" Ron called. "Without even meaning to? Just from getting angry? Like when you blew up your aunt that time?" Ron ran forward, instinctively putting himself between Harry and Scrimgeour, though it didn't look like it was Scrimgeour he was worried about. "Cor, Harry, what happened? I thought you two just went out to take a walk in the garden..."
Draco groaned, rolling his eyes. It was too much effort to put up with her nagging about it anymore. "Alright, then. You can be Hermione. But just you."
"Have you- have you gone back as a spy?" Draco gasped, leaping up to start towards Severus accusingly. "Severus, say you haven't- Dumbledore can't make you, it's too dangerous- the Dark Lord is unhinged, he's just going to kill you-"
"Why?" Harry whispered back. The constant annoyance of Draco did seem to help distract him. "Magical brotherhood not your cup of tea?"
He made it to the hospital wing in record time, taking the stairs two at once, cursing at his wand in English and French with the worst words he knew, though it was probably his own damn mistake, trusting Hermione's fondness for the bracelet he gave her. The charm must have fallen off and lodged there sometime. It was nothing and no one's fault but Draco's that Hermione would be as rigid as the turquoise stone when he found her, if he was
"It's him," Hermione said, "He'll win." And then, although the silhouette with the cup was still almost all in shadow, Draco saw a glinting in it around the face, and then a rounded shape that made him realize: the figure was wearing glasses.
"Some of both," Draco said shakily, and Severus handed him another cough potion.
"We do," Grindelwald agreed with a sweeping gesture, "Both find ourselves in dramatic company."
let us meet the monster," Greg whined, and Draco slammed a fist on the table.
"I'll count down from ten, and then I'll make the choice for you. Ten..."
"My lord!" Bellatrix gasped. She cast Aqua eructo to extinguish the flames from Harry's Lacarnum inflamari, enough to run through them towards him. The frayed hem of her robes caught alight, but she barely seemed to notice, flicking her wand again to douse herself before turning her attention back to her beloved madman, her husband in the midst of Harry's fire and ignored. "My lord, what have they done-"
"What?" Draco said, rubbing his stinging eyes. He'd checked his face in the mirror, and seen a combination of lying down, cold water, and charms make him look normal again. That didn't mean that crying so long hadn't still left his eyes hurting. "What do you mean, dumped?"
The frustrating part was that Harry overestimated him, claiming Draco was letting him on purpose, just holding back like he always did in their duels. "Come on," Harry whined, "I know you can do way better than that. I saw that hellfire you made before. Will you just duel with me for real for once? We've had two formal duels and I know you held back both times- well, the second got canceled because you caused a riot, but still..."
you want to take me to Voldemort?" Harry demanded, a sudden fire in his death-green eyes.
, is my problem why exactly?"
"That was also a lie, Mr. Malfoy. I had no intention of placing such a dangerous weapon in the hands of Lucius Malfoy." He did not specify whether the wand or Draco himself was the weapon. "That wand is
be along tomorrow to blow up Highbury," Draco drawled, and she poked at his shoulder again.
Nissy didn't answer, just bowed her head deeply, then raised her hand to snap her fingers and Apparate away. Before she could, Draco blurted, "Nissy, Dobby's birthday is this month. Why don't you come to his party? You and your brother. It will be in the trophy room after dinner again that night. It would mean a lot to Dobby. And no one has to know you were there. We'd promise."
He didn't think he was going to cry, but something was shaking him, like a wave rolling through him, some momentous change at the root of him. Then Sirius had stood up and hugged him. He pulled Remus to join them, and Draco fell into their embrace.
Draco shrugged elegantly. "Why do you think I'm on the ground?"
It only took a day for Father's letter to come back. It had been a day worth of groveling to the other Slytherins, insisting to Pansy he had genuinely thought it was from Potter and had not just wanted to embarrass her. He also had to put up with the snidest little remarks from Severus, when he made the mistake of going to complain to him about it in his office. As if Severus would have any sympathy about unwanted admirers, after what he thought Draco had put him through.
"Well... that's the plan, anyway," said Hermione. "If you want to join us, we need to decide how we're going to-"
"Draco," Potter said, making a clear effort to sound the reasonable one, "Why did you get me a music box that kills plants?"
"And I guess I messed up that opportunity by figuring it out, did I? I spend weeks carving a charm to give her for Christmas, and her Christmas gift to me is
"No," Draco lied, "But she didn't have to. Not when there's Harry breaking his back to make sure he knows how much I adore him every day. It's not fair to compare, but it's human, you know?" He waved over at Harry, who was being assisted by DA members at setting up the fireworks. The two-handed wave of excitement Harry gave back told its own story. "My cousin is a special person, Neville. Really, really special. I don't know why you're not more demonstrative-"
"Draco," Potter said softly. "Don't worry. I'll protect you."
"Oh, of course," Draco said loftily, "Except
"Okay, so then what are you going to complain about now, Chosen One?"
Father had said not to touch anything, but there was no danger in touching this. He'd learned the feel of its twin by heart over sixth year. It greeted him with the same lacquered smoothness. And if he'd been gratified to see Vince back after the Fiendfyre that had consumed him in the Room of Requirement, he had to tolerate the survival of this denizen of it - not that this was the one in Hogwarts, just its twin. His mind was getting scattered.
"Did you sneak back under the invisibility cloak?" he purred, and felt Harry's affirmative sigh as a vibration against his cheek. Draco had lost his mask at some point, but Harry's was still on, glinting as untarnished and perfect as the start of the night. Draco smiled and pressed a kiss to the stag's mouth, nuzzling drunkenly at the mask as Harry led him about the floor, hands on his hips very sure. One only moved to feel at his wings, and then carefully remove one of the feathers, which went into the pocket of Harry's cloak.
Draco wrote on the top of another soon-to-be-burned piece of parchment.
He wondered if the burning was magical or done by hand. If it was magical, it was interesting to see he hadn't yet qualified, but maybe it was more human and petty than that, a personal decision to excise the poisoned element from the family body.
The knowledge it would be Remus too, somehow, had Draco as bitter as he had when he first overheard it all, an acid bile building up in his stomach up to his throat that he could physically feel constraining what was now a mere
"'Readily available?'" Hermione shrieked so loudly, Draco feared his Inmotus would barely hold. "'READILY AVAILABLE'? Draco, just because you're
. "I remember. Just-"
"I don't know." Draco edged closer to Harry, trying for a kiss. "I'm not going to be useful with this. Let me be useful another way, hmm..."
Hermione gave a helpless smile when she saw him in his navy Arsenal hoodie, with the hood pulled up over his hair. "Isn't that too small for you by now?"
"Draco," Luna said, squeezing his hand, "I didn't mean to scare you. Whatever it is, I won't tell anyone. I promise."
"You're awfully cooperative," Draco observed suspiciously. "Are you an Occlumens?"
I've turned all the girls to Squibs- but even if it had, they agreed it was preferable to keeping them in place..."
"You look nice today," Draco said. It was true, with Neville's robes also traded in for Muggle clothes, a fitted red sweater and jeans that showed off just how much growing that physique had started on, towards its eventual endpoint of hunky snakeslayer. "Really nice. Hot date?"
Immediately after breakfast, Draco went around gathering Luna and the Gryffindors for a walk by the lake. It was getting warm enough out for warming charms to suffice. Luna ran down to let Dobby know to join them if he could. Dobby popped in by the time they'd made it there and were settling by the lake, bringing cushions, blankets, and ample refreshments. They'd just had breakfast, but everyone enjoyed a strong cup of Prince of Wales tea against the lingering chill. Ron at least was also more than happy to tear through some of the little pastries and sandwiches. Draco cast a strong Inmotus around their part of the lake, where waves of melting ice kept lapping up against the shore. He gave Luna the honor of reading to them.
Draco woke up terrified and hungover. If not necessarily in that order.
towards the advancing figures of Bellatrix and Theo and yes, the brighter white-blond heads of Draco's parents, the image of suicidal Gryffindor heroism. "Lacarnum inflamari!" Harry screamed, and at first Draco thought Harry had missed somehow, even with the enemy right almost upon them now, only the hellwater between them. But when Harry's flame hit the pond instead and let up a great mass of tainted black smoke, Draco understood.
"Mr. Bluthers," Dumbledore said, with the same ease as if he was in his office dispensing root beer candy floss. "What did you determine as the cause of death?"
"What? What's wrong?" Draco demanded.
. It made Draco's skin crawl, thinking something could have gone wrong, maybe with one of their friends. "Potter, what are you doing here?" Draco asked, trying to keep his cool. "I have detention with Moody."
Dantanian scrunched up his face. "I want cake, Maman."
They were all marched en masse to the hospital wing, where they could be further administered warming potions and observed for signs of frostbite. Eventually, Ron and Luna managed to force their way in, and made much of Harry for his dumb show of excessive heroism. Though objectively it
Lucius Abraxas Malfoy
"I think the Felix Felicis is keeping us from making a mistake," Luna told him as they put their brooms back, looking less shaken from her encounter with Tom Riddle than he had been. "We wouldn't have wanted to go right then, I don't think, if we hadn't been going to be able to hold off the Boggart. So when you couldn't, I knew I was the one who could do it."
"Hermione said Occlumency is a magical thought control shielding thing. Keeping intrusion and meddling out of your head," Harry said tentatively, and Draco explained the rest of it. Harry looked dubious by the time he finished.
Voldemort surveyed his father's graveyard like a newly founded kingdom. "How many will be brave enough to return when they feel it?" he whispered, and Draco thought of his own father with a flash of new terror, not sure whether he was more frightened for him to come or not. "And how many will be foolish enough to stay away?" Who would Draco watch die first, Harry or Father?
"Draco!" Ron called up. "Draco, is that
in ancient texts, to the point it may have been deliberately forgotten? I believe this rests in a final rumored condition for the coda: the blood feud.
Draco smirked, then stuck his head out from behind the statue. "Striker, I'm going to be late to Arithmancy!" he called cheekily before Harry dragged him back, hands sliding down to Draco's hips. Draco wound his arms around Harry's neck and kissed him back thoroughly, licking Harry's mouth open. "Mmm... let's see, have you
"Well, no one's on the schedule to practice today," she said impatiently, "So I've found it a good place to go to then, for some peace and quiet away from these
"It's for Mr. Nott," Draco blurted, heart in his ears, "And it was a year ago, last June, soon after I killed Mr. Nott, I'd been sent home, like I have now. It was- it was from-"
Draco's verbal barrage silenced them all, male and female, leaving him smirking in satisfaction. "Very well. Now that we've gotten that straight, as I was saying, I
"Fold them," Draco instructed after. "Fold everything into the facets of the knife. That's how it works, you know, blacksmithing, at least in the old Muggle style. Folding metal over and over until it has enough density to cut and stab through something." He held up the dagger, and Harry stared at it in fascination.
come with me to see Lockhart. If all goes well, he'll swear an Unbreakable Vow to me, the heir to House Black, to be obedient to our house until the citadel is completed. Something like that. Severus knows how to do those, he can oversee it for us."
Severus seemed guiltier about that than the impending Dementor's Kiss facing Sirius. "I have told you, that was not-"
"Yeah," Draco said, and poked at Harry's arm with his index finger, making a face scrunching up and jerking his cheeks from side to side. "How else will you get your surprise, Harry? Do try to keep up."
Potter seemed to think hard.
"Mr. Potter," Father said frostily, "We meet again." His gaze traveled down, only to freeze at the sight of the sword hanging bloody from Potter's hand.
"It won't kill me unless you're my enemy, right?" Harry called out, and walked into the fire.
Draco chose to ignore that. "You probably won't be called today. But you'll still have to sit in court. Sorry about that. It'll probably be interesting. I'm going to get a coconut latte..."
Gilderoy seemed loath to let him go. "So, since it was no luck there... is it, er, back to spending everyday in bed, then?"
Draco didn't realize he had been the one to gasp until three pairs of eyes fastened on him. "What?" he cried out fiercely, stalking to get in Karkaroff's face, as if intimidation was necessary anymore. "What did he tell you about him? About those connections?
"I think," Draco said, clutching onto Luna's hand, "That I need to sit down."
Severus's eyes opened. "Yes," he said quietly, "There is another. There will always be another."
Potter's mood was glummer than one might have thought, though, and not just because Sirius still a fugitive meant his adoption away from the Dursleys was impossible again. Draco had, as Ron had feared, promised Potter too much, and hadn't been able to deliver. But Potter's misgivings proved most serious towards a prophecy he had heard Professor Trelawney make in the corridor the day of Wormtail's escape, and hadn't had time to tell Draco. Apparently it had been something about the servant of the Dark Lord rejoining him and helping him rise again.
The obsidian designs and embellishments, between levels and between tower windows, were often greyhounds or snakelike, and far less dilapidated than the mundane stone, casting an eerie contrast, though one largely swallowed up by the plants that had entwined all about to mark the passing of centuries. The most striking of all was the massive ebony gargoyles, dark-winged angels with triangular devices in their hands, which closer inspection revealed to be bellows. What Citadelle Xaphan was more than anything, though, was
. Langlock!" he cast, and Ron's hand shot to grab at his tongue incredulously, making incoherent sounds of panic.
- I was so bitter you got to go with them when I didn't, when you, what you had to
"Okay, Draco," Luna laughed, and gave him a shaky but real half-smile before she left him.
"Fuck!" Draco exclaimed, tears threatening to spring to his eyes. Even the sight of the bracelet would have explained it, but no... He stroked his wand and heard it say
"I can only speculate," Severus said unhappily, "But I deduced much from evaluating the memories from a perspective of incentives. Dantanian may have chosen them in a rush, soon before whatever mad act he committed that made Astaroth change, or he may have chosen at leisure. But he meant them for Dorian Malfoy, and he meant them to communicate some certain things." He looked at Draco, and it was almost like they were having one-on-one extra Potions lessons again.
"I'm not like everyone else, Dumbledore. You can't control me. And you can't predict what I'm going to do, either."
"I wouldn't lie," Luna said, although Draco knew that itself to be a lie. He didn't know how convincingly she had delivered it, either.
him for what he had done- are you
He glanced reflexively back towards the headmaster, whose form was a bit more distant, but still looming.
Neville sat down, though he looked relieved when the pillows did nothing to him for sitting on them, as if not being cursed was not a right but a privilege, when it came to hanging out with Draco Malfoy. Which was rich, given that Neville had gotten Stinksap in Draco's
"Fine!" Karkaroff hissed savagely. "Please,
"Imoogi, for one," Draco blurted without thinking. He lifted his chin defiantly at their strange looks. "It's from a very ancient and beautiful legend. None of you lot would understand it."
"Yeah, and they make it obvious," Draco sighed, though he supposed the behavior of the talon wand and the coda research made it more obvious. "Seriously? I'm going to lose all respect for you, Gellert, if you really never figured this out, and you aren't just testing me. He tried to turn Astaroth into a Dementor.
Dantanian was amongst the students, staring at the floating candles in awe. He was by himself, though surrounded by knots of chattering children, dressed in robes with his long hair pulled back with a black velvet ribbon. His hand went into his pocket- he seemed to be nervously feeling at his new wand, to check it was still there- and he stared at the ceiling until a voice forced him to stop.
"We haven't adopted him yet," Sirius sighed.
"Years before." The hall was only lit by the candles, both under lanterns that diffused their insufficient light. Elizabeth's face over it looked indescribably hateful, like an effigy meant to soon be burned. "Years. I've always known what you were, devil child. But I wanted to be wrong. I tried to be friendly when we met you. I tried to be so kind, but look at you You look just like her now."
"Doesn't know what he's saying," Lockhart said to Potter, a bright pillar of darkened red beside him, along with indistinct figures hovering behind. "Not to worry, Malfoy. I'm about to fix your ankle."
"Severus? Gilderoy? There you are," Draco interrupted, as if he had just arrived, and his deception was a success. Neither distracted man seemed to suspect a thing.
Draco eventually stopped laughing long enough to say his goodbyes. "I'll go back to Hogwarts," he promised as he left. "There's just one more thing I need you to do for me first."
So the Slytherins all wanted him gone, with that points total taken off them. Draco's reminders that he had won them far more points in the past, and in fact singlehandedly won the House Cup in first year, was met only by indignant sniffs. And a pillow tossed in his direction by Blaise Zabini, whose Hippogriff-mauled arm certainly seemed to have recovered. The next morning, after a lot of whispering, Blaise asked quite seriously whether Draco really fancied Harry Potter, and if so, would it be possible for him to do so in a way that didn't leave him mistaken for a fugitive desperado?
It wasn't just that he was terrified, not only of exposure but of just about everything and everyone around him. The one time he saw Cedric Diggory sitting at his table, he was so shocked he dropped his bag full of heavy books right on the Hufflepuff's foot, and just stood there trembling until his mates glared at Draco and dragged Diggory away. No, it was that he had work to do, jump-starting research of his return, to give Severus to help once he told him. Work that would be easier if Severus had just given him a pass to the Restricted Section as requested- a ridiculous denial, given that the Manor had more dark texts freely available than Hogwarts could dream of. But no, Severus wanted to know the exact books he wanted, and when Draco told him
"Harry and Hermione- Harry and Hermione are-"
"You're so talented," Harry said breathlessly, in a voice like he was enjoying watching Draco heal him more than he should. Draco shot a look up through his pale eyelashes, and saw Harry's green eyes burning down with none of the fear they should have had. He kept his hand in Draco's, turning it over while he spoke. "That was brilliant. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cause any trouble..."
"That," Draco said fervently, "Would have been the greatest moment of my life." At Remus's glare, he added, "But of course it's good she didn't, for Sirius's sake..."
Hey guys! To answer some questions from last part- about the Boggart incident with Remus, first of all, the reason he canonically stepped in very quickly for Harry is that he was already prepared to, because he expected Harry's Boggart to be Voldemort. Next, Remus absolutely recognized Bellatrix lol, but Severus had him enough on the defensive that he wasn't about to admit that he had, and give Severus more ammunition to use against him with Dumbledore. He was reduced to playing dumb at that point. Neither of them bring out the best in each other :(
Well, that would explain how Dobby had helped Potter and co escape from Malfoy Manor. No wonder Draco wasn't making any progress figuring out about the Chamber of Secrets. There was a reason the hat hadn't put him in Ravenclaw.
"We're at St. Mungo's, aren't we?" Frank asked warily. "Merlin, my legs feel like they aren't going to work. Augusta, you aren't saying anything about Neville. Is the baby alright? Please, tell us the baby's alright- the Death Eaters didn't get to him, did they?"
"Orpheus had a fundamental flaw, and so did Sculptor. These sensitive young men believed they loved these women more than themselves, more than life itself. But in their hearts, what they wanted back was not her, but the two of them together again. A life

"We will do no such thing," Severus said flatly. "Do you not believe I act strictly in my godson's best interest? No one must ever know of this.

"Not anymore!" Gilderoy exclaimed, and Severus leaned against a stack of books, face half-shadow with the half showing a frightened grimace. "After what you showed me in the Pensieve, to convince me he

"Yes," Remus said, clearly not the answer Fudge expected. "If a man is capable of becoming an Animagus, he is capable of magic at least that powerful."
"It's alright," said Luna. But along with her neck and hair, the muddied suit jacket Draco had given her was dripped over in drying blood. Draco had to shake off Harry and Hermione, where he leaned down and began to hum, casting Vulnera satentur.
"Now open your book at page two hundred and thirteen, Mr. Black," Severus said, face blank as he spoke the name, "And read the first two paragraphs on the Cruciatus curse..."
"Potter wasn't lying, if that's what you want to do," Draco said with a Severus-length eye-roll. "He and his Gryffindors have been losing their shit all day trying in vain to come up with a way to stop him becoming the Boy Who Was Barbecued."
And finding out Draco could be a Gryffindor had left Harry certain that they would not have to curtail their proximity too much even at Hogwarts, save in respect for their dormmates. Draco had become a Slytherin the last time, after all, because he
It was hard to focus, when a cursory look over at Blaise and Theo saw Theo casting and shielding wordlessly with just as much ease as Hermione, if not more.
, maybe a name and maybe not, which no one around him seemed to know a thing about at all. Aunt Bella knew that weakness of his, and he didn't. Which meant that he couldn't
"Not dangerous at all," Draco lied. "I'll still need to contact him to set it up."
love her. I can't help it. She's my mother. I don't want Aunt Bella to hurt her because of me..."
"I know you hate the man," Harry hissed, while Draco tried and failed to hide his pleasure. "But this is important!" He lowered his voice and glared. Likely his ire was really fueled by resentment he couldn't join taking the test. "A lot could depend on those lessons. On that memory I need from Slughorn. So don't look
Potter saved Draco from accidentally saying too much as he tapped them both on the shoulder, pointing at the grass. Two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees, and Draco would have been so much more scared if he was not proceeding on the presumption that like the trip to the Forbidden Forest in first year, Ron and Potter had made pretty much the same trip as this in the course of the blue loop and survived it.
captain. Better than Angelina Johnson." Harry didn't blink at that, just scowled at the aspersion against his teammate, so hopefully that had already been established, and Draco hadn't just given away his future knowledge. "I can coach a Quidditch team to glory with my hands tied behind my back... and no, Harry, that's not an invitation..."
"Why not?" said Draco, "I have the power," and one by one, after Remus went and found the family register, every blasted name returned to the tapestry: Alphard, who had left gold to Sirius; Isla, who had married a Muggle; Marius, a Squib; and Cedrella, who married Septimus Weasley. Then Draco followed Remus's instructions, and carefully tested the quill at adding another name.
All in all, it could have gone worse. He hadn't gotten any further than Aunt Bella had in learning how to make a Patronus from Lupin. But he hadn't gotten any
"Potter," Draco said. "What is this I hear? Could it be the savior of the wizarding world begging for my attention?"
The Hat began to go back and forth between Ravenclaw and Slytherin, ignoring thoughts of Gryffindor. Draco's palms had gone clammy, gripping his thighs. His nails began to dig into the fabric of his trousers. He tried not to look up for fear his gaze would go to Theo. He could feel the Hat sorting through every memory, new and old, cutting past his mental shields the way no one and nothing else could in the red line.
Like the word thief on his palm had been in third year, but now it was
"Langlock!" Draco screamed, but Bellatrix saw it coming a mile away.
for me. Right now, he's waiting-"
"Already did. I have Ancient Runes." That was a bit of a slog. He should get going, even if he was tempted to postpone departure indefinitely, to keep looking at Harry. "I'll see you in Defense after that, I suppose."
So, with Fang scampering around them, sniffing tree roots and leaves, they entered the Forest. By the glow of their wands, they followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path. They walked for about twenty minutes, not speaking, listening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves. Then, when the trees had become thicker than ever, so that the stars overhead were no longer visible, and their wands shone alone in the sea of dark, they saw their spider guides leaving the path.
what Mr. Nott said. The killing curse. I just wanted to know you were sure, in case Theo ever tried to bring some kind of- I don't know, legal or civil case, now that it seems violent revenge is off the table..."
"Not like you," Harry said with a forced laugh, left thumb stroking softly over the pulse point of Draco's wand hand.
Draco and Luna exchanged confused glances. "Um, no?"
Severus closed his eyes, as if taking in this last moment with Draco before he thought something would irreparably change in him, and then handed him two books, with bookmarks already inside. Draco opened the first without waiting, and found, of all things, a storybook. This was
Draco closed his eyes. "Fine. You're right, there are too many of your family for it not to be a matter of practicality. I will refer to the two of you by first names henceforth, but on one condition." He paused to make sure they were listening. "That you both accept that under no circumstances, come what may, I will never so long as I have life in me refer to Potter as
McGonagall was smiling, seemingly in pleasure at the theoretical aspect. "Hmm," she said, and then flicked her wand and levitated two pencils, turning one red and the other blue before casting a Spongify and softening them to malleable colored lead.
"Lockhart, if you think you can just leave the citadel whenever you please," Severus was seething, stalking towards the guest room with Draco jogging after him. "I have better things to do than to waste my time chasing after-"
There had been supposed to be girls' and boys' tents, but Draco's insertion as well as Luna's in their midst had made separation break down. Now there was only one for older and younger, with Bill, Charlie, and Peter coming out of the other tent fully dressed, wands out. Draco had his fingers on his wand in his pocket, and thought sourly that he would have been more use fighting than those three put together, before remembering he had no intention of fighting his father.
"Don't worry," he said impassively. "This isn't goodbye. You'll be seeing me soon. But if you don't, and Lamia needs me, then give her anything she needs, in my place. Promise me, Dorian. I'm sorry, but I have to ask for another favor. If I don't come back, promise me you'll help Lamia."
they were, it had Draco hyper-aware of every inch of himself, everywhere on him that Harry had and would touch. Which was singularly inconvenient during Potions, but Draco managed to master himself better in that class than any other time, through sheer fear and respect for Severus. If Harry couldn't... well, unfortunately, much to Severus's undoubted sorrow, it wasn't like Harry hadn't ever spent entire Potions classes doing things to Draco with his eyes before.
, and very much so with Harry. But you can't stop caring just because you tell yourself to. And if you don't remain open with Harry about how you're feeling, in body
heroic even in that moment, and as unaware as a Flobberworm of that eerie otherworldliness. No wonder Draco had hated him so much back then. He even looked like a storybook hero, like something right out of a fairytale, the prince gone to save the fair maiden from the monster, triumphant. Except with a piece of the devil still as well, left hidden in him with that scar.
Draco could have exposed her like last time. Maybe he should have, but the thought of alerting Potter to Girl Weasley's worship and speeding along their true love made him suddenly less amused. And he did not want to think what Ron would think of him for it. "Oh, for Salazar's sake, it wasn't me, Potter. Why would I be wasting a Valentine on
buy her flowers on Valentine's Day, shouldn't I? If I want her to make up her mind to date me after this..."
"Whatever," Ron said, and went off on a tangent that might retrospectively explain his glee at Lockhart's downfall. "Hermione was snowed by him. She had such a crush. Do you know if she has a crush on anyone else? She isn't still interested in Viktor Krum, is she?"
Luna waited until they had joined the party to activate the enchantment she had spent days crafting to perfection, to make the dress fluctuate between blue and pink at command, as in the film of Sleeping Beauty. But Ron didn't look once at Luna, even when she began changing colors.
Though in fairness to them, even if they could have seen the Thestrals like Draco could, it still made a very strange sight.
"A Slytherin came to me and said Theo wants to kill me, and all the Slytherins hate me and want to help him," Draco admitted in a rush.
And finally, 59 sounded, and 1 again, and Draco waved his wand to put out the fire.
Draco stared up as innocently as he could. "Harry cares a lot about Neville."
"What would it matter if I was?"
The other five had been waiting outside for him, but Ron had opened the door and peered inside impatiently, just in time to hear the shopkeeper scream, "You heard me! I never want to see your face here again! GET OUT OF MY STORE AND NEVER COME BACK!"
Weasley flushed bright red. "Alright, fine, yeah, I get it. Come on. Get under. We have to go somewhere forbidden in the castle. Harry took me to see it this way last night, and since then, he's been really different." Weasley flung the cloak over himself, vanishing like he'd Disapparated somehow within the walls of Hogwarts. Then the watery feel of the cloak was spread over Draco's shoulders too. He ducked his head underneath, letting Weasley cover them both, and looked down to see his body had vanished just like Weasley's.
It was an empty threat to an extent, and they both knew it.
"Possession, I already have," Draco said, thinking of the Gryffindor tie. "No worries about that. The blood... well, I have a plan for that too."
All of the power Draco had felt pouring into him as he cast Cauterizo surged out, blue flames drenching the world behind him, the same color as the candles on the walls but hotter, whiter at the center. They danced out like water spirits, surging in the startled face of Bellatrix, who jumped back before the fire blocked her from view entirely. Draco painted her away, painting a low circle all around them with the fire. He looked back to see his friends' faces spellbound in wonder, as Draco raised his wand like a conductor and painted a wall between them and the Death Eaters in fire.
"I know all that," Potter said, wand unmoving. "I know what your story is."
"I don't actually know if this
"The floors," Hermione gasped, pressing the button for the entrance floor to the Ministry and then the close button over and over until the rattling lift obeyed. "I used a spell... magnification... to look at the floors, past the fire... this is the door... with the most, ah, scuffing, it had been opened the most..."
Unexpectedly, Mr. and Mrs. Granger relaxed. "Oh, that's good, sweetheart," Mrs. Granger said. "I'm just glad it wasn't a mean sort of nickname as a monster, because he's different. You know, because he's gay."
When they descended, they had every eye on them, and none left them anytime soon.
Draco skimmed over the letter from Percy on that rainy Monday afternoon, an owl that had come unceremoniously to a window in Gryffindor Tower the previous night. It was a letter longer even than the oversized missives Draco and Sirius tended to send each other. Between incoherent complaints about the embarrassment the Scabbers story had caused their family, Percy's overall message came through loud and clear: stay away from Harry Potter, and sever ties with the Order of the Phoenix entirely.
"You might stick to words
"Tell me," Father said tightly, after a wand of holly and phoenix feather was as impotent in Draco's hand as the rest, "That my son, my only son and heir, is not a Squib." He cast a sharp glance to Mother, who darted to secure the perimeter against potential observers, for what Draco's parents seemed to be preparing to face as one of the greatest-ever shames to the name of Malfoy.
The heat poured out from Harry to Draco's skin, then, the spark of that sharp magic fizzing through Draco down to his toes, and Draco trembled.
Dobby, Blunderbusses (Ron, Harry, Neville)? The Weasleys?
?" Hermione marveled between laughs, and then peered over at Ron and nodded in agreement. "Hmm. Fair enough."
"Harry," Draco breathed, and with effort rolled off Wormtail's body, blinking in the dim light at the sight of Harry crouched before him in shadow. The cup was still there, and Harry was breathing hard, not from the Portkey but grabbing at his scar. They had returned to the Astronomy Tower, and as improbable as it seemed, after what they had faced, this had become a place that meant safe harbors.
"Over Sirius and Remus? Over
"Put it away!" Severus snarled. Draco didn't think Harry had seen the Mark from his angle.
"Nothing," Potter said quickly, and dug around in his bag. He happened to have it on him, and handed it over. "Just give it back when you have the chance."
"See," Draco said, "Luna is my cousin, she knows I don't mean it as a come-on. And I'm a realistic man. I know my strengths and weaknesses. Weaknesses? The Patronus charm, Boggarts, the Disillusionment charm. Strengths? Everything else. Especially my
Frederick looked up from his eggs. "Jackson said she was expelled from school."
"Whether Black did those things, it is not up to me to say, only the law," Severus bit out, "Which found him guilty enough to send him to Azkaban for life. But never make the mistake of thinking Black
"Draco, you think Karkaroff is up to something, don't you?" Hermione mused.
"I'm not the problem," Draco complained even as Severus seized him, taking him to his study and sitting him on one of the armchairs, while Luna trailed them with a look about her like the Grey Lady of her house. "I'm not here about
"So I've dumped Neville," Luna informed Draco, upon his return to the Ravenclaw common room. Harry had taken him back to Hogwarts as soon as he could, and Draco had rested for a while in bed. Now he reemerged only for that blunt statement to greet him.
And then Draco was on the ground, back hitting hard enough that he was later forced to conclude the wounds there were fully healed, to give so little reaction. The only pain came from his cheek, where Potter's fist had struck and sent him falling over. He had little time after realizing what had happened before Potter had hit him again, uncoordinated hands landing on Draco's neck instead as he fell onto Draco and started to try and fight him with fists like a savage Muggle.
When Draco finished his long and rambling explanation of the process, including his myriad confusing justifications of its importance and possible effect, she looked less judgmental than he feared, but more understanding than he would have liked. "It's her," she said abruptly, "Your aunt, she's your Boggart, isn't she," and Draco's fingers, stroking fretfully at his wand in his pocket, tightened on it as he nodded. "After Nott said it was obvious, Harry spent so long trying to puzzle out what yours could be, but he never guessed that. Though I hear Ron suggest it once."
Draco couldn't figure out why everyone was going crazy during the Durmstrang arrival, until he eavesdropped on the girls and heard them cooing over Krum. To him it seemed self-evident that Krum should be here- after all, someone had to be Durmstrang champion, and take Hermione to the Yule Ball- but they didn't know that, and he was the weird one, unimpressed by the boy who'd caught the Snitch in the last World Cup final. Which had, after all, won Draco a very satisfying bet.
"He was a Slytherin," Luna said, "Not much older than us. He had very blond hair..."
It was a carriage, discharging its cargo of pretentious French children and their pretentious giant headmistress- all of very little interest to Draco, at least until one of the curly-haired girls pointed over at Draco and started trying to catch his eye. Draco didn't recognize her, wondering if this was some cousin he didn't know about- probably a closer relation than Luna- except then Madame Maxime finished introducing herself and her pupils to Dumbledore, and took note of the curly-haired girl and a few others whispering. Together, Draco recognized them with a sinking heart as the girls he'd spoken to in the forest, on the night of the World Cup final.
Draco hadn't seen anything but himself in the mirror in Malfoy Manor, and then the aftermath of the shattering charm, reflection splitting as actual glass failed to shatter. "What did Potter see?"
"Ah. Yes, perhaps," Draco said nonchalantly, playing it off with a flippant shrug.
But if you fancy, Potter, I'm ready for the risk
Remus looked bewildered now, but he hadn't let go of Sirius's hands. This unexpected show of emotion seemed to have caught almost everyone off-guard, any murmurs going silent the moment the word Azkaban was spoken.
Remus, none too close, and half-unconscious from trying to climb over the body of Dolohov to reach his felled husband- if he hadn't just taken Draco's word for it-
"The way they put it, you're like star-crossed lovers," Luna said dreamily. "That's what the headline sounds like. The Chosen One and the Death Eater's Son. Not a terrible title for a ballad."
" McGonagall interjected sharply, "That you confessed to him some time ago that your public ambition to become an Unspeakable was a completely fabricated one."
. There was a comfort in that. "You're paranoid, Weasley. I have better things to do than entertain the delusions of a gaggle of Gryffindor children."
"Don't!" Draco yelled. "Potter, don't, we can't let Wormtail escape-"
"Do you think the house elf is on the other side?"
Millie's warnings flitted through Draco's head all at once. At least Ron distracted them, stammering, "Sorry, 'Mione... 'm not drunk, though, swear I'm not drunk..." He continued this premise even between bouts of vomiting.
