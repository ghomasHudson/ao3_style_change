As he sat there, pensive, he heard a chorus of: "Hi, Draco!"
And... he wondered as he looked around the vibrant street at the happy, colorful clubgoers all around him and the two blokes snogging mere feet away, what did it mean that a part of him wished that he was still in there with him, arms wrapped around his waist while Draco sung about wanting to make him holler...
Hello, lovely readers! I hope that you are enjoying and just wanted to take a moment to let you know that you are all on my mind in these uncertain times. Hope that you are all safe, well, and that all the fanfiction out there might bring you some joy :-).
Ginny lingered there, atop him, gazing down at him with searching eyes as he fought for his breathing to even out.
"Really, Draco?! I cannot just be another shag for you!"
"What happened 6th --" Draco froze. "Are you talking about --?" There was no way Harry was talking about what he thought he was talking about... How could he possibly think that? Draco had just assumed that they danced around the topic because it was awkward to talk about and it wasn't really the type of thing that arche nemeses tended to delve into but, Merlin, had he never actually proccessed it with anyone? Harry wouldn't look at him. "Of course that didn't count! Harry, look at me." He wouldn't. Draco sat upright and scooched closer so that he was face to face with Harry, his legs on either side of the other boy. He reached out a hand and gently tilted his chin so that green eyes stared back at him, bright with unshed tears. "Did you worry that it
Could all of that stuff realistically have happened in under 6 minutes? Maybe. Maybe not. But hey, they're wizards so **shrug**.
It didn't help at all that there were large chunks -- years even -- that went unaccounted for in Sebastian's records. Harry turned to the time-line along the wall again, his eyes settling once more on the largest of the discrepancies.
"Yes?" He didn't dare believe it. "Was that a yes?"
"It's African Dream Root, Harry!"
"Oh! My apologies, Mr. Potter!" Harry hastily relaxed his wand hand and she breathed a visible sigh of relief. "Sorry to startle you, sir, but I've been looking everywhere for you!"
Draco laughed. "You losing your mind and thinking you're a different person makes more sense than me getting on with Muggles?" he asked with a raised brow.
"Very sage advice, indeed."
"Now, are you done with your obligatory Gryffindor martyr shite, so we can grab something to eat before we find little Ms. Weaselette and clear your name? I'm famished."
to feel like?"
"Because... being out comes with a lot funny looks and ridicule and even some flat out hate..." he said cautiously, peeking up at Harry through blonde lashes as if waiting for him to suddenly hightail it out of there.
"Isn't he great?! It's the Great Ranzuli!" He laughed nervously. "The greatest magician I've ever seen! If you'd like to see his next show, he'll be on in the square at 6 o'clock!"
Ron raised a curious brow but answered the question. "Yea, to Astoria Greengrass. Technically, I'm invited to the wedding since I think Astoria is my second cousin twice removed or something like that but there's no way in hell my family's showing up to that elitist shite show."
Malfoy looked like he was warring with something.
"Ginevra Potter," Draco clarified.
, I took a guess at where she might've gone Sunday night..." he said, watching Harry's reaction carefully.
"I'm not all that interested in dating right now. Honestly, dating Ginny right after the war was... a lot. For both of us. I love her, but it feels like the whole thing is a part of this fantasy war hero people expect me to live out. Like I'm supposed to marry my teenage sweetheart because it's what everyone wants but I don't know... I want a family, of course... But, I'm kind of grateful for some time to for us figure out what we want for our own lives versus what we want because
"Oh, yes! That's it!" Yaxley was gripping Potter's hair painfully as Harry pushed forcefully against his thighs with his forearms. "I like a good fight!" he hissed, slamming his hips against Harry's flushed and sweaty face as he finished in his mouth with a loud cry and a shudder. He pulled out gingerly, spraying the last of his load across Harry's now too red lips as he spluttered and spat. That seemed to be enough to tip Rowle over the edge as well, his head tipping back and a garbled moan escaping his throat as he buried himself deeper inside Harry before stilling.
"Yes, Draco, your father and I will be there," she said, thickly, wiping away fresh tears with her free hand.
Harry was surprised by that. "Really? Why would it be different?
He knew Ginny had planned to talk to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley about the pending divorce and the whys, herself, but the proposal had only happened last night and he'd only even gotten around to telling...
"Potter, you were right. I don't think this can be just another shag for either of us and
A knock on the door made them jump. Stevens was there, waiting anxiously.
Blondie just tilted his head at him in contemplation, his light grey eyes searching.
"Yes, he can be quite charming, but I wonder... How has
Blaise paused.
Presently, his life was filled with light. It shone bright through the large windows, warming the large, white, shag rug, illuminating the white and cream Parisian furniture and decor, and pooling across the white, chenille duvet pulled around him. It poured in from the skylight that let him gaze up at the blue, summer sky or catch glimpses of the passing white clouds. And, mostly, it came from the bright, shining sun that currently had him entrapped and suffused by heat and heavy limbs, as if he were holding on for dear life. He chuckled but then sobered at the thought when Harry's brow furrowed, fretfully. He'd been having fitful sleep lately, fraught with nightmares that, of course, Harry downplayed. Draco rolled his eyes at Harry's pigheadedness but squeezed him closer and planted a soft kiss on his temple, all the same. He felt quite accomplished when Harry's worried brow relaxed and a hint of a smile touch his lips.
When she returned her gaze to Harry, there was a steely resolve there that made his hairs stand on end. She reached for her purse and he instinctively shook his head.
Harry rolled his eyes. "We're just trying to find Ginny. I don't want to hurt you but if you're more intent on hunting me than finding Ginny, then I'll have no choice."
He had thought it brilliant at the time but now his mind strayed to the sleeping boy on the couch who believed in him even when he had no reason to... The boy who he could no longer deny that he cared too much for and who cared too much for him... And the fact that everything in this world suggested that that was unacceptable...
Draco kissed his forehead and deft fingers made quick work to free Harry from his jeans. He scooched forward to line up with Harry's cock.
"Draco, she told me I should reach out to you -- before she went missing..."
Draco smiled, toothily, but shook his head and changed the subject.
Harry's work was off limits because it always seemed to make Ginny feel neglected and
"Touch yourself, now!" Draco commanded.
"He was looking for the Elder Wand because our wands were connected and it kept backfiring against him," Harry continued. "When he found out about the Elder Wand, he thought it might be a way to solve the problem and solidify himself as the most powerful wizard in the world."
"Harry?" he asked tentatively as the room was plunged back into darkness. He didn't wait for the next flash of light, he apparated right to where he'd last seen Harry and dropped down to his knees.
," but he highly doubted a gay tryst with Malfoy, the one bloke from school that she still despised more than anyone, was what she imagined.
Harry opened his mouth to speak but then closed it with a clack. He and Malfoy stared at each other for a long moment before they both dissolved into hysterical laughter.
Potter simply shrugged and bit into a chip. "I've been doing this sort of thing since I was 11. It's just second nature at this point, honestly."
Harry froze.
"Alexandra? Alexandra!" he called out.
"Sorry! Force of habbit," he said, blushing.

Harry followed his gaze to see Proudfoot craning her neck over the crowds on one end of the square and turned to see Savage doing the same at the opposite end.
Surely that would be more torturous than joyful."
Harry looked at him incredulously. "How so?"

Jansen smiled smugly and straightened his tie. She was really sort of cute when she lost the attitude. He was surprised when she returned, barely a moment later, with a hot cup of coffee complete with latte art.
Draco Malfoy watched the reds and orange of the morning sun dance across his eyelids as he contemplated his life choices. His head was pounding, his mouth taste of cheap whiskey and felt like cotton, his whole body ached, and why in the

That was nothing compared to the crimson Draco's pale skin was surely turning. He put his face in his hand. "Pants, no!" he said weakly.
Harry's jaw practically hit the floor as he stared back at Mundungus Fletcher, completely and utterly dumbfounded.

His transfiguration wasn't great but he did manage to turn a candle into a cup and walked over to the ensuite bathroom to fill it with water.

to," said Ginny.
don't tell me you're falling in love with Malfoy!"
The view was breathtaking. It was still a few hours before sunset but the sun had already begun its slow travel westward over the little town. Harry felt touched that Draco would share someplace that was clearly special to him, but he couldn't ignore the unavoidable.
He sounded so genuine that Draco felt his chest warm. He bowed his head, smiling shyly. He didn't realize he'd wanted Harry to be proud of him but apparently he did. The feeling was better than a warm cup of Rosemerta's finest butterbeer on a cold day.
"Took you long enough," Ron finally said as he pulled away from Draco who just looked dumbfounded. "Thank you for looking after my best mate. I was just telling him that I can tell you really care about him." Draco looked surprised and turned to Harry with raised brow. Harry nodded fervently. "I give you my blessing, just don't make me regret it or I

But for those two, it's like my memory's gone all foggy..."
comment.
Mcgonagall stared at him for a long moment. She pulled out her wand and aimed it at the small couch against the curved wall opposite her desk, transfiguring it into a large circular sectional that angled itself around the strange instruments that were still littered about the room. "Have a seat," she said, waving to direct them to the plush green and red tartan cushions.
and frowned when the owl took the rest of his delicious scone before taking off.
fun right?!"
Robards only shook his head, disbelievingly.
"I don't know, Blaise, I guess I was a little bloody preoccupied!" he yelled.
Could it be? Did he really just??
"But..." Harry followed him out of the cell and watched the still utterly bizarre scene of Jansen locking the cell doors behind them with Robards still inside. "Merlin!
"Harry?" There was a nervousness to Stevens' voice. "How'd you know to do that?"
"Hmm... I can't say."
"And what does not ok look like, Harry?"
Harry inhaled sharply again as he felt one of Draco's long, slick finger slide inside of him.
"Draco?" She fixed him with a discerning brow.
"Harry, let's talk," he said at last, standing and abruptly leaving the room.

"What was
"Mr. Potter... Sir?" He glanced back at his partners in crime who nodded in encouragement. Harry shared a wry look with Draco before he turned in his chair to face them.
"Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Potter! It's so nice to have you dining with us today. Right this way, please," the hostess rattled off when she'd finally returned.
put himself in a scenario that left Draco having to sit with that same pain.
"There's lots of ways and, unfortunately, I've heard one too many of them even though I've asked to be spared the details on multiple occasions," he said examining his nails, nonchalantly.
"Nothing, you're just cute when you're jealous." He snaked his arm around Harry's waist and squeezed him closer, planting a soft kiss in black hair. "Merlin only knows
He lifted his head to see Harry look just as baffled. What the man was describing shouldn't have even been possible at all, but from all the way in Australia?
Draco fought the lump in his throat and croaked out a laugh instead, "Please, the closest my parents have ever come to acceptance was when I told father I had taken up ballroom dancing at the ball houses when I was living in New York. ...Of course, he had no idea that the term means something
Sebastian was right, he didn't much give a damn about girl Weasley though he didn't think Harry's strong, if somewhat moronic, Gryffindor morals would ever let him step out on his marriage. Draco would be lying if he said that he didn't think about portkeying directly to England when he'd found out that Harry was getting married. The fact that he didn't was all the evidence he needed that he was too far gone because the usually conniving, self-serving Slytherin hadn't been able to shake the thought that it just wouldn't be fair to show up and complicate Harry's life like that again.
Harry applauded enthusiastically as Draco, Pansy, and Blaise wrapped up with a bow.
"An owl just came in from your favorite confidential informant asking to meet," she said, holding up a piece of parchment. "Should I pass it along to one of the Aurors or --"
Draco rolled his eyes. "Just because I didn't want a relationship with
"Oh, hello! What a cute family!" He turned to see Isabela's mother, Margherita, a muggle woman whose half-blood husband was killed in the war, getting out of her car. "Harry is this your better half?"

had even picked up the tagline: "
At that moment, Ron, dressed in full, magenta Weasleys' Wizarding Wheezes robes (that, ironically, clashed horribly with red hair) came marching furiously down the aisle toward them.
"Ok, that settles it! Jansen, with me!" Robards said as he marched out of the room.
Harry was no where near as drunk as him and had mostly stayed sitting on his stool nursing his one drink. Draco couldn't tell if it was because he was in protective Harry mode and trying to make sure Draco didn't do anything stupid or if, perhaps, he was scared of what might happen if he allowed himself to let down his own inhibitions here.
"Cods wallop! Like an arsehole like you gives two shits about something as inconsequential as someone else's marriage if it gets in the way of you getting what you want." Sebastian laughed heartily and Draco frowned back at him. "And didn't you say that your best mate banged his wife?!"
"Merlin, that was a lot of cum!" He screwed up his face and stuck out his tongue when it finally went down.
"Yes. You can do what you're told and don't ask questions," Pansy quipped.
She stood on tip toes to kiss him and stared up into his eyes as she asked: "You ready to go public, baby?"
Just as she was finally accepting the old anecdote about a watched floo, a strange

who does what..." Harry blushed. "But I really can't see him not being understanding or making sure you feel comfortable. He might be the most selfish prick I know but you seem to be his exception."
Harry was just about to tell him to keep pushing forward when Draco paused, mouth wide open, as a
Mother had yet to even acknowledged the encounter with her sister, which was actually quite strange. Usually, she'd at least go on a rant about how someone had wronged her or remind Draco that they were better than the likes of such and so but, here: silence.
Harry leaned in again to kiss away his pout and looked thoughtful for a moment while he searched out his wand.
"Um-hmm," Ginny and Draco both agreed and it was enough to send them all into a fit of giggles right as they reached the Great Hall.
Harry cursed his accuracy but couldn't help but smile.
"Well, well, well," a familiar drawl greeted him. "I never thought I'd see the day, Potter! You almost look like a proper wizard!"
He scoffed.
He was sure he was meant to figure that out
Harry gripped onto Draco tightly, with both hands, feeling faint with anticipation. He needed to see that she was safe for himself, with his own eyes!
"Well... Seeing me at work will no longer be a problem..." He smiled ruefully. "I quit."
Harry sighed heavily as Madam Pomfrey headed back to her quarters. "I don't even know where to start..." His eyes widened slightly with panic. Draco reached out to put a calming hand on his shoulder and he watched as Harry's face switched from anxious to contemplative to a shy nervousness. "Hey, Draco, do you think you could come with me?"
Draco rolled his eyes. He didn't know what he'd expected. Trusting another Slytherin
on the fucking Dark Lord. Anyone would have to be seriously daft to believe you could kill your wife." He rolled his eyes. "Merlin, you ask a lot of questions for someone--"
Shite. Maybe Astoria liked mushrooms...
"No he does
Draco barely had time to brace himself as his little cousin Teddy ran across the snowy front lawn and barreled into him, full force. He laughed as he caught the boy whose electric blue hair was slowly turning a white blonde, as it always did when he first saw Draco, and Teddy wrapped his arms tightly around his middle.
"Can you fix it?" he finally asked.
"Maybe. Merlin, we were just babies, Harry! And learning so much about ourselves and the world! We were truly best friends then." She shook her head as she reminisced. "I sort of miss those days. Or-- at the very least all the muggle pub food we used to eat." She laughed and then sunk down into the cushions of the sofa and closed her eyes and smacked her lips as if she were remembering something tasty. "I still dream about that one pub we went to with the cheesy chicken nachos."
secretly in love with Harry Potter, and there were a chance that he might be too, I'd say you've got one week before the ceremony..." She shrugged.
That part was hard, too, still, but only because...
Draco's mouth dropped open.
"Why pretend then?" Draco asked matter-of-factly.
"Wait, let me just get some owl treats then you can distract me all you want," he said suggestively as he quickly relieved the owl of her post and turned to head back inside for treats. He stopped short, however, when he glanced down and caught sight of the moving picture on the front page.
Draco had, in fact, tried to confront his friend on one of his rare visits home three years ago after Blaise's
"Harry, while I appreciate--"
She stared at them silently and rolled her eyes after a few moments of them waiting for her to speak.
"They're just a tough nut to crack! Look who we're talking about, mate -- it might just take a little bit of time!"
"Merlin, you're going to tease me to death!" Harry whimpered.
Harry kissed his temple again. "Yes, love."
Draco's eyes widened. "Draco. And, really? I'm the first?" He felt inexplicably special but the butterflies that came with the feeling did not mix well with the little seeds of guilt and worry already in the pit of his stomach. Or maybe it was all just hunger since he had stupidly skipped lunch when he was trying to be bougie this afternoon. Right on cue, his stomach growled loudly. "Ah, yes... I would love some of your fish and chips, they were delicious." He said somewhat coyly.
Ron and Hermione looked at him questioningly, Proudfoot and Savage wore brows furrowed with concern, Jansen smirked, smugly, and Anavi just looked plain frightened.
of you. I know this is a big change for us all but if there's ever a team of people I'd want to take this ride with then they're standing right here in this room."
echoed abruptly from the street below, quickly followed by the screams of teenage girls.
"Yes," he panted. That was fine, especially after the tongue. Harry was starting to wonder what the big fuss was about until Draco added a second finger. Harry screwed up his eyes and tensed when he felt the burn.
"No, definitely not blonde."
Draco tilted his head, his brow furrowed and his stare intense and searching for a long moment before he slowly shook his head.
"We thought you might be able to make more sense of this. Maybe give us a better perspective on possible motives or next moves?"
"Malfoy?"
Of course, Granger's hand shot up.
Draco turned to find Harry (still sporting a head of bedhead to rival all bedhead) watching them with shining affection from the doorway.
Ron gave him a wry look and nodded. Hermione searched his eyes. "Well... ok..."
"Excuse me, what?" asked Daphne, bluntly. "What the

"Playing the nice guy! Like you're any different than Robards!" she huffed. "You bureaucratic arseholes are all the same! Yea, sure you're nice now but give it time!"
Harry smiled. He felt so grateful for his friend. "Thanks, mate. That's all I really want is a real chance to work at this with Draco and there are already so many hurdles that we'll have to get over that we haven't even talked about yet. There's clearly a lot of history to overcome and..." he paused, suddenly feeling somber.
pregnant..." He swallowed. "You weren't sure who's it was, were you?"
Ginny was the one who broke the silence first.
"And why would he do that?" he asked, dubiously.
fucked up! It's why we get each other in the first place! Before, I might have thought being fucked up meant miserable, too, but I'm not miserable... Not with you, at least." He smiled shyly and then rolled his eyes at himself. "It's actually been pretty restorative to talk about some of these things with you and know you get it. Maybe pretending we're normal and untouched by trauma won't work for us."
Harry thought nothing of it as he unfolded the parchment and saw handwriting he'd never seen before -- that was hardly unusual. But as he read, his heart stopped:
"Thank you for offering, Harry -- really! You're a Saint!" he called back.
Harry looked at him, expectant. Draco raised one finger.

"No way, mate! Cannons all the way!"
seen you look at me the way you just looked at that man." She shook her head and rocked back and forth as if she was steeling herself for something. Harry looked around them warily, praying that they weren't garnering attention. He thought he knew what was coming -- the very thing that he had been hoping a good day might prevent -- and the
"Harry... Those are two different questions. I don't think sex with you would be anything like what sex is usually like for me."
"Until it came time for school, yeah, looks like. But this brings us to the point we already knew: Sebastian getting piss poor marks at Durmstrang, being a bit of a bully, dropping out and returning home to his ailing parents. It appears that he re-embraced the muggle life for quite a while: He went to university where he studied political science and business, apprenticed under a local politician, became well connected, and even started his first successful business making hand-crafted baseball bats. It seemed to be a pretty honorable affair until..."
"Catching the dragon is worth it even if it flies away." He said, quietly. Determinedly.
"Fuck!" Draco moaned. Harry stared up into dark, lust-blown grey eyes as he licked up the length of his cock, kissing and sucking along bare, sensitive skin and lapping up the pre-cum when he reached the head. Draco allowed himself to be lost in the moment and Harry was struck by how beautiful and confident and
"I know."
Harry wiped the tears of laughter from his eyes. "It really is all about taking it one day at a time I guess. Some days it's really hard, and some days I realize that the people and things I value most in my life wouldn't have the same role in my life or bring me as much joy as they do if I hadn't experienced all the pain."
as late as the 1930s."
"Draco wavered, conflicted. He had thought his deciding moment in the upcoming war would be whether or not he was actually able to kill Albus Dumbledore. Instead, it now seemed to all come down to whether or not he'd let an injured, addled brain Harry Potter wander off into muggle London alone."

articles calling me insane?!" he asked, incredulously. "I think I can take it," he said, smugly, taking Draco's hand in his and watching the funny stares start to unfold already around them.
Harry stepped back and took a look at the scene. He felt a sense of real joy at seeing all of his friends welcoming Draco and bridging gaps. It also warmed his heart to see Draco slowly start to warm up and laugh and joke with them, and not in the pompous, slightly mean way that everyone was used to. People from all houses were whispering all around them and Harry chuckled to himself.
"Ron..." Hermione placed a calming hand on Ron's arm to stop him when he pulled back with the intent to punch the blonde bloke in his face. Draco sat unflinchingly and sipped the tea Hermione had prepared. "What if what he's saying is true?"
different there, at the time."
"I'm just... It's nothing, Draco."
, Potter."
Draco started when a hand landed on his shoulder! He instinctively tried to scream in fright but another hand covered his mouth before he could make a sound. He turned, abruptly, only to come face-to-face with bright green eyes.
"Oh, get stuffed," Draco glowered.
. In that moment, Draco realized that he hadn't needed to travel the world in search of his new home.
"Insolent fool! What did you
without warning, you inconsiderate oaf!" he said, indignantly, brushing dust off the front of his robes.
"Oh, Harry -- it's not like sexuality works in such an all or nothing way as gay or straight. It--"
He shrugged. "We'd have to figure out where they're likely to hit next. There has to be some type of connection we're missing."
They would never let anyone hurt you. I would never let anyone hurt you," he whispered. "Please, stay with me -- don't leave me, Harry," he breathed, barely audible, but it was clear that Harry had heard it because his pupils snapped back to normal and green eyes shined warmly into gray.
"Who knows..."
Blaise nodded, solemnly.
"Are you... alright, mate?"
"Come off it, Ron. Didn't you hear what he did for Parvati? Or what Ernie said he's doing in Muggle Studies? Even helping Harry yesterday was something new. It seems like he's really trying."
"Watch it!" shouted Weasley.
"I have to admit, I am conflicted. I've never seen anything like it! For you two to have wrapped this case up so thoroughly in less than eight hours..." Robards shook his head in disbelief. "It's unprecedented! But then to find out that the thief is your bride to be?! Do you know how that could have compromised the case and our department?!" he yelled, turning red in the face. "It's just further proof that you're a liability, Malfoy!"
"Harry..." He looked down at his fancy shoes and swallowed thickly before returning his gaze. "What would you like to do?"
Draco swallowed nervously and Harry gasped. It was rare that he saw Draco look so shaken.
Bullocks, the Elder Wand is just a myth!" He rolled his eyes indignantly, expecting the old man to laugh at any moment now and admit that he was just taking the piss. Instead he just stared meaningfully at Potter who stared back, avoiding Draco's gaze.
Draco was determined to find his partner as he deliberately thought about his destination and disapparated.
"Nope, no more interviews."
Potter was stood on the front step of Draco's London terraced home, staring at him, mouth agape.
"I just wanted to say thank you... for what you did in there..." he said, rubbing the back of his neck and suddenly feeling very awkward.
"What is it?"
Draco rolled his eyes again before he ran his hand through his hair and began to pace slightly hysterically. "What has become of my life? Rescuing and giving pep talks to Harry Fucking Potter! I will surely be killed for this! I've probably just got my whole family murdered," he muttered.
not be able to speak on it when you're not even involved?"
"So, what's our next move?"
She paled as she held up a letter and a lock of long, red hair.
Harry's blush reached his ears but Draco only smirked, rather liking the sound of that.
"You... You did know... didn't you?" Draco seemed uncertain whether or not it was ok for him to ask.
"Thank you, sir," he said, wiping blood off of his bottom lip and closing the door to the holding cell on a brooding street hustler they'd caught using real magic to swindle muggles out of thousands of pounds in Trafalgar Square.
"She apparated us to her home. I had to arrest her in front of her parents and sister but they have no idea that you had anything to do with the investigation. When they found out what happened, they flooed over to the Gobstone game at the Parkinson residence and explained everything to all the elders who had been robbed. They weren't happy, but they agreed not to press charges so long as they get all of their heirlooms returned. We have to take her in to fill out the paperwork but she will walk free in time for your wedding."
At first, Draco had assumed that marrying into the pureblood (albeit very loosely so) Weasley family meant that Harry would be subject to the traditional soul bonding vows and that thought had served as even further motivation to stay away and let Harry enjoy his life.
Draco returned the CD player to his bag and kissed him on the cheek.
Draco laughed and then hid his face in his free hand. "Yes, let's just pretend I was preparing you for the world and not just being a complete little shite."
Harry chuckled despite himself. "I really hope that's not your going rate for all your consulting work..."
"Someone in one of the last of the neutral families on that list that have yet to be hit by the thief."
. That one fact was what distinguished him from dream Draco: he knew the draw of that wand and he wanted nothing to do with it.
up to be in the line of Theo's curse but we'll just have to convince people that is was, indeed, meant for you."
Draco bit his lip and nodded quickly, still staring straight ahead. Of course he knew. He'd had the chance to risk everything for Harry before and he didn't. And, because of it, he hadn't felt truly happy a day since. All the money and fame and shiny new things meant nothing when he had known a love that, even in its brevity, had been everything. His hand instinctively came to rest on the chain around his neck, hidden by his robes. He swallowed. He knew that just because he did any of this didn't mean he'd get Harry back. But that was ok. He could live with that pain. He couldn't live with sitting back and letting
"Well, it turns out that that deep dive into muggle records was a bloody brilliant idea! The Aussies cross-checked with the Muggle authorities and, you won't believe it, Harry!" She shook her head, incredulously. "With a little digging, they were able to get a full background on Sebastian Krafft!"
"'m hot," he said, irritably pulling at his clothes and beginning to strip out of them.
Harry was about five seconds away from yelling.
Draco interrupted her rambling. "Wait -- Me? A safe space?! Come off it Granger, to most people I'm still 'Draco Malfoy, the death eater!' I represent all of the shite they're afraid of in the first place!" he said irritably, suddenly feeling defeated as shame overcame him.
to go with Gryffindor red?" he teased as he took in the curtains and bedding and rug.
?!" he asked, baffled as Harry stepped up to the bins and took off his watch, shoes, baseball cap, jacket, and hesitated before he took the ring off from around his neck and gingerly placed it in the basket.
Between the Weasleys, his Hogwarts friends, and the Order, Harry had built his own family over the years long after his family was ripped away from him. He loved all of them dearly, but the little family of misfits and orphans that was he, Andromeda, and Teddy just felt different and so much more important. He and Andromeda had really become close friends in their mission to provide Teddy the best life possible.
?" Draco hissed as his training mates closed in around them. "Have I not passed every single one of those blasted character and aptitude tests, just like everyone else here?! Have I not chosen a path that, by its very nature, implies that I'd like to do some good in this godforsaken world, for once?! Yes, how 'bout I pledge to put my bloody life on the line every day trying to keep the world safe, just because I'm an evil bastard!"
"How?" Ron asked sceptically.
give a damn about what happens to Draco?" She frowned.
He lay awake now, exhausted but unable to sleep, per usual. Not only had the sleeping somehow gotten worse, but the visions hadn't stopped and he found himself avoiding certain corridors and he'd stopped eating in the Great Hall altogether. Instead, he'd taken to grabbing food in the kitchens or eating out by the lake. When Ron and Hermione asked why, he'd told them that he just didn't want all the attention.
"Why are you in Knockturn Alley, Malfoy?"
"Draco Malfoy? Really, Harry?"
There was a long moment of silence before Ron finally spoke. "So, you're dating Malfoy?" His face was mostly unreadable though his eyes were red.
"Could they describe this mysterious man?"
"Drink," he commanded.
"Draco? Draco, what is it?!"
Surely he wouldn't resort to something so barbaric?
She smiled, knowingly. "You'll be fine, Harry. I know it's a lot of change, but, you'll adjust. Shoot, look at me! I've been Robards' secretary for ten years -- what am I to do without the big bloke here yelling left and right?"
" and "
They walked into a cozy yet dark sitting room. There were shelves full of more ominous looking books and jars around the room. A fire roared in the hearth, an empty portrait frame hung above the fireplace with fresh lilies carefully placed underneath it on the mantle. A pot of tea sat on the coffee table and Harry noticed an abandoned green blanket on a comfortable looking chair with an array of books spread out on the floor before it.
thing, right?" Neville chimed in from Ron's other side.
Harry felt his heart skip a beat and his chest swell. "So you're saying it wouldn't work because it'd add an extra layer of attachment?" Draco stilled and stared at the ceiling for a long moment. He nodded, slowly. "And would that be a bad thing?"
kind of arse kisser. He wanted to gag but apparently it was making Potter feel just as uncomfortable: he could see a deep flush creep up the boy's neck from where he sat. Ok, maybe Potter wasn't a fan of this man's groveling.
Draco rolled his eyes. "What does it look like I'm doing? Consulting. My fee is 200 galleons per hour. Or you can suck me off. Your choice."
They landed in the (thankfully Walburga free, though, still wrecked) foyer just as Mariah sung the last

"Ollivander had a similar reaction when he tried to tell us what he knew. Why on earth would
"But those are the easy ones!" a third year Slytherin shouted. "When are you going to teach us how to conjure a patronus?"
"Is everything ok, Harry?" He looked to Harry though his wand was trained on Ron.
"Yes, well, about that... it appears that she tried to apparate to Holyhead and something either went wrong or she redirected but, either way, she wound up in a muggle inn in Surrey."
"You've been doing a lot of that lately. The wandless stuff."
His face blazed and he turned to see Draco's baffled expression as she reached out a hand to shake the hand not holding Teddy tightly against his hip. He took it, perplexed.
-- to hear. "I haven't stopped, even for a second. And I'll never stop -- not ever." He shook his head, hoping Harry could feel the weight of his words.
He stood to grab another handful of the green powder and called out for his Melbourne home. Soon, he was looking out into the familiar, panoramic views of his sitting room.
Half the time I just keep buttoned up anyways from practice. Or maybe it's the evolutionarily safe thing to do..." He furrowed his brow. "But we don't have to do big displays, I know it's not..."
"Draco... I wasn't holding the wand..."
Draco pulled back to get a better look at him. "Harry. It might've been stupid to be there but the worst you might've thought would happen was you'd get kidnapped and killed by the Dark Lord or something and that happened all the time, you have cat lives or something when it comes to that." He rolled his eyes teasingly. "Why on Earth would you have ever suspected that you would be brutally raped by two wizards?" Harry winced.
?" Ron joked.
Harry felt a jolt at that. "You want me to do something based off of what Malfoy said?"
"Well, the way I see it, we really only have two: We say our goodbyes tonight... or I give it all up and we can be together."
Draco froze and Harry felt the flush creep up his chest and neck at his slip.
"Seriously?!" How could it have gone so
coming from one of them.
Draco's insides were warm and tingly as he started on his third glass of brandy. Thanks to liberal amounts of alcohol and the arrival of Luna Lovegood (whose total lack of propriety, turns out, makes for an excellent ice breaker), his and Harry's friends were
Regardless, he had survived it. Each instance may have left him slightly broken but never destroyed beyond repair. Would it make a difference now if he were actually able to say goodbye on
"Gay? Wow... I guess I never really considered that Malfoy might be... Gay..." he said, dumbly, finding his mouth suddenly very dry and cheeks ablaze.
Don't forget who got up at the crack of dawn to make you the best pancakes in the whole wide world!" Draco shouted after them as Teddy skipped alongside Harry in the direction of the gardens. His eyes were drawn to the tenseness of Harry's retreating back. He frowned.
Harry hadn't even had warning enough to duck before the flat of her hand struck stingingly across his face. He stretched his jaw and rubbed his cheek in response. Harry looked around warily when he thought he saw a bright flash.
"Ooh! You've gone and done it now! Stori is
time," he teased, seductively.
" Draco said, slightly panicked.
It was the third portrait that Harry found the most interesting, however. In it, the sun shined down ethereally on the Malfoys as they stood under the arched floral trellis of a beautiful garden. Judging by his hair (which, yes, Harry had committed to memory), Harry guessed that Draco must've been about 13-years-old. Judging by Narcissa's stressfree countenance and Lucius' smile, it was definitely pre-Voldemort's return. Narcissa stood behind Draco and wrapped her arms around him to pull him into a tight, loving embrace. Draco smiled and turned to his father who beamed back with such love and pride in his eyes for his prodigal son.
decision to take father's wand was just an act meant to embarrass and punish or if there was something actually wrong with his own wand.
He swallowed thickly. This was bigger than he knew, he had no idea who all the players were, and -- he looked down as Jansen's stubby little gnawed at finger-beds turned into his usual, perfectly manicured set -- he didn't have much time!!! He had to find Harry quick and get the bloody hell out of there!
Draco's lips twitched as his thigh made its way between Harry's and Harry's breathing hitched.
' but, close enough." He picked his head up and flashed Harry a brilliant smile that melted his heart which subsequently seemed to drop down into his groin when Malfoy bit his lip.
He was taken aback by the abrupt direction of the conversation. "Erhm... Because she was a blood traitor?"
Draco laughed. "Hey! Madam Pomfrey is not going to take kindly to you attacking her patients!"
"I wasn't brave, I just lied to my father... Had the situation been reversed, and you were in my position while I was captured and wandless, even as established enemies you probably would've risked your life, wands blazing to
they shouted as Potter wordlessly cast. The thick ropes that left his wand bounced off the shield and fell to the floor.
"Hermione, do
"Fuck!" Draco growled, furiously reaching for his wand and feeling useless when the bandaging wouldn't let him grip it.
"Father. Please send my apologies to Madam Malkin. I'm a bit under the weather," he said, sitting up and angling his body to make sure Harry was out of view to the swirling head in the fireplace.
Davenport opened and closed his mouth frantically. "But... sir! You can't do that! He's a
"Urgh... I guess... but no details!" He cringed again at the thought.
"Well?" Malfoy asked with a raised eyebrow, handing him a cup of tea and breaking the spell. Harry shook his head slightly and took a sip of tea (noting that it was made just the way he liked it and briefly wondering how Malfoy knew that) before pulling out the Marauders Map. He stared at the blank parchment for a long moment. What would his dad, Sirius, and Remus think about him sharing their secrets with a Malfoy? He winced slightly at the thought and then raised his wand and tapped it to the map.
"So how do you help people heal?" he asked.
. Maybe he has a muggle girlfriend?"
"No, Draco. This will go down in history as the one case that got me. The one case that stumped Harry Potter,
Harry swallowed. He never thought he'd be turned on by the thought of another man's cock in his mouth and especially not... what Draco was suggesting... But somehow, even though it sounded down right filthy to his own ears, the thought of having Draco Malfoy
"Draco, you never --
"Just channel her or whatever and get your arse up on that stage!"
surprise?" he questioned, voice rougher as he stalked closer.
"Aww, Harry! What a full-circle moment!"
"Draco... Why would your friend be doing this?"
"Oh! Makes sense! I had a right awful fright there for a minute." He shook his head.
Draco watched from underneath the cloak as Yaxley and Rowle each grabbed Potter underneath an arm, still frozen in that stupid position with that shocked look on his face, and carried him off back into the building from which they'd come.
He didn't even have time to ponder who in the bloody hell would be sending him a howler before he was forced to throw it from his lap just seconds before it exploded!
"Owls, owls,
He hadn't meant to cry, he hadn't even thought to -- but as the words came out and he realized their truth, he found himself sobbing, uncontrollably. Blaise looked taken aback, worried even.
"Look, Gawain, I am beyond being angry at Ginny for daring to fall in love with someone else --
Potter nodded and Draco instinctively reached for the wand in his robe pocket only to wince when his hand throbbed in protest. Draco had given up on ever being reunited with his wand after that dreadful day in the room of requirements when Crabbe lost his life and he and Harry nearly did, as well. He was surprised, however, when shortly after his release from Azkaban he received an owl carrying a box containing his wand. Attached was a note from Harry that simply read:
Draco eyed his hoodie with disdain and handed him a hooded cloak. Harry rolled his eyes but took it.
"Vat?! Malfoy!" he said, setting pleading eyes on Draco. "Vat is this?"
Harry chuckled but bit his lip, worriedly.
Robards stood, angrily, and didn't spare him a backwards glance as he left the room.
Potter's responding smile was disarming as he reached out for Draco's hand again. "You need me to say it back?"
"Huh?" He blinked back at her dumbly.
so will you
, at least, still does whatever it wants to," he said, pulling out his Hogwarts robes, feeling secretly very grateful for a uniform that allowed him to just be one of hundreds of other teenagers.
Harry was about to argue that it wasn't wise but then the endearing look of excitement on his face tugged at his heart.
He peaked into a nearby window display and the face reflected back at him frowned at its own small, blue, close-set eyes and strong, wide, angular chin. He was grateful, however, that the polyjuice
"No, Potter,
"This one might seem.... weird... considering the whole wrong side of the war thing and the whole plot to kill him..." He couldn't bring himself to look at Parvati at this, he still wrestled with so much shame and guilt around what happened on that tower. "But, before he died... Dumbledore was the one person to try to offer me a way out before he was killed." He pointed towards Dumbledore's grave across the lake. "I like to sit near his tomb and eat his favorite candies in remembrance. Dumbledore was a man who lived to instill hope and wisdom and... even as he was dying he tried to give that to me..." he choked. He was surprised when there were hands on his back. "When I sit there I try to hold on to that hope and remind myself that Dumbledore thought me worthy of redemption and Dumbledore was always right so that means I can do it." He laughed softly and gave a shy, wry smile. She squeezed him into a hug and kissed the top of his head.
case and you deserve to see it through to the end."
There was a long silence. Draco didn't really need him to answer; he couldn't remember a time since the war that the stoic man beside him had ever looked so depleted and defeated. After several long minutes, Harry finally spoke.
"Mate, watching Malfoy jump into action this morning and even sitting next to you on the couch a little bit ago... It's hard to describe..." He thought for a moment. "You know how he looks in potions?"
"I love you, too, Harry." He smiled warmly, lost in green eyes.
"Well, your boy Michael seems convinced that you can't be serious and thus must be manipulating or charming Harry." Ron narrowed his eyes at him.
"I'm fine, Ron."
"Now that's better," Draco said, appreciatively, as Harry opened his mouth to show that he was good and hadn't swallowed without permission. "Is that what you wanted, Harry? Is that what you really wanted to taste?"
Draco blushed fiercely.
it! But, for some reason, actually hearing Draco say it felt like a lot like that 100 foot fall from his broom in third year. There was the same icy feeling in his chest, too, although this time there were no dementors needed to make him feel this despair. He couldn't stop the tears.
Harry was told that it would be a
"Nothing," he bristled. "He was hung like a hippogriff, is all."
He frowned in thought. How bizarre. A spell that bound five families and made it so that neither of them could talk about what went on between them. Why? And for how long? Did it run through the blood lines? His eyes widened.
album.
Ron waved his wand and summoned a flask with a foul smelling, mudlike substance inside. "Not when you've had to use it to save your life in a pinch as many times as we've had. You learn to keep the stuff brewed and on hand
"Oh, hello there!" called a tall Indian man that he had noticed behind the counter earlier. "You're a friend of Harry's, right?"
"I don't know... Someone recently told me that I had nothing more to prove to anyone and that it was ok to live my life for me so, at the moment, I couldn't really give a damn what other people would think." He smirked up at Draco. "But do tell me how all that attachment stuff would make the sex different than what you're used to?" He quirked an eyebrow.
"Keep your head down. We just need to lay low until the disapparition jinx wears off and it shouldn't be much longer now. That way." He handed the shop keep some notes and nodded towards the only exit to the square that they hadn't seen an Auror stationed.
and choose the only person in the room who's actually wanted you dead at some point." He rolled his eyes and Harry gave a watery laugh and bowed his head. Draco squeezed his hands and held his gaze, seriously. "Harry, I am the man I am today because you believed in me over and over again, even when you probably shouldn't have. I still don't know why, frankly, but I am eternally grateful for whatever screws you have loose or wires you've got crossed that allowed you to trust me when no one else would. That trust is your greatest gift to me, Harry, and I vow to always fight to be deserving of it. To be both a man and a partner who is worthy of it. Merlin knows I'm not perfect, and I can't promise that I will never miss the mark or let you down, but I vow to wake up every morning with that as my main mission in life and in marriage. I love you, Harry, with every. Single. Part of me. You are loved and you are valued and you are worthy. Now and forever. And I vow to never let you forget it."
Draco blushed in response.
what it's like to find out that your own father has purposely set out to sabotage you?
He stood abruptly, not caring when the chair was sent toppling backwards. He trotted back into the penthouse apartment and skidded to a halt in front of the large fireplace in his sitting room, heedlessly grabbing a handful of the green powder and flinging it into the fire. He plopped down in front of the hearth as soon as the flames turned green.
"Are you alright, mate? You're looking a bit peaky..."
Harry froze, aghast. "You think Krafft Sr. realized that his own son was a budding psychopath? Thought that pretending that they weren't wizards might keep him harmless?"
Blaise's eyes widened to the size of saucers. "Let me get this straight... On the very same day that Harry Potter supposedly got attacked, you - his supposed girlfriend - want to come out as dating a Slytherin??"
Harry really did scoff this time. Out of the corner of his eye he saw white blonde hair leaving the classroom and he hurried to gather his things. "I've got to go! Bye, professor!" he said, rushing out before Merrywhip could get out another word. The third floor corridor was crowded with students heading off to their next class but he could spot Malfoy and Zabini just ahead near the portrait of Merwyn the Malicious.
She nodded. "And... do you need anything else? To help you blend in?"
" He shook his head remorsefully.
. I know you're scared, but I need you to listen to me carefully. You can say a lot about the many ways I probably failed Ginny as a husband, but, I can guarantee you that if you could ask that woman right now, she would tell you that she
"What?! Draco, are you serious?!" he said, too excited to even notice that he'd switched to his given name.
Red light jetted so quickly from the tip of Draco's wand (because now that he looked at it,
much credit."
She shrugged. "Some people might not but some of us really do see you trying. Padma and I are in a study group with Ernie, Hannah, and Neville. Sometimes Luna joins. She told us that everyday that she was held captive you would visit her to sneak her food and chat with her and try to cheer her up. She says you're what kept her light from going out." He fiddled with the butterbeer cork that hung around his neck. His unexpected bond with Luna was one of the purest things to have come out of all of the mayhem. Her understanding and forgiveness and genuine desire that he be ok and protected, even if it was from Nargles or whatever the hell they were, might be the most cherished gift that he possessed. She might say that he was there for her, but in those dark days at the manor, her bizarre stories and cryptic encouragements were often what kept him going, too.
Sebastian nodded and then smiled down at the polished blunt instrument. He lifted it into the air and beamed at it, proudly.
?! Why do you act like that was a stupid question?"
that?!" he asked incredulously without thinking.
"Nope! Witch Weekly's most idyllic couple is no more!" he exclaimed with way too much glee.
"Wait! Do you happen to have any more of these cute little uniforms?" He pointed to her white button up dress.
Saturday morning found Harry sat on the floor with a full glitter beard while little fingers braided his hair.
"Your main course will be out in just a couple of moments Mr. and Mrs. Potter, is there anything else I can get you?"
The two needs came head to head in dramatic fashion on Tuesday afternoon as Draco sat, distrait, across from mother and Astoria in mother's sunroom as the two witches fawned over rich, colorful samples of cake for the wedding.
" she asked, incredulously, as she took the seat across from him. "I've been trying to get Ron to get us a reservation there for ages! Apparently, there's a six week wait just to get a seat at the bar!"
He had felt so compelled to send the invitation after their run-in this afternoon (for which he blamed Teddy and his overwhelming cuteness, entirely. Seriously, what mortal being could resist the pining that comes with watching Draco Malfoy hold a toddler?!) -- but now he was kicking himself for his stupid Gryffindorian impulses as his mind ran through the list of things that could go wrong.
Draco rolled his eyes. He was still peeved from Nott and did
She paled and swallowed, hard, refusing to look at him. Draco tsked, his steel-grey eyes narrowing and his voice turning as icy as his gaze.
And Blondie hadn't been let out in five months...
"Ms. Jackson?" he asked, reaching for Harry's drink and downing it.
"One big stir, one tight stir," he said as he directed his arm for a couple of turns before letting go. "You see, you got it!" he said as it turned orange and then turquoise.
He looked at her in shock. Was she really suggesting what he thought she was? Maybe now was the time to finally bring up the basilisk in the room. Surely she knew he was queer but did she fully get it?
(See the end of the chapter for
He crossed his arms and huffed.
"Draco," she said, pointedly, when he'd reached the table.
"Wait, you actually
Harry sagged with relief and Draco wrapped an arm around his waist just to make sure he didn't actually fall.
" Ron continued, the anguish in his voice making the building guilt in Harry's gut stir. Ron pulled the chair from in front of Harry's desk and sat down heavily, resting his face in his hands. "I went by the Burrow and checked the clock. It's stuck on
"Draco, I was talking about the whole
Draco looked down, aghast, at the dark green and gold folded parchment that was now starting to smoke.
Theo crossed his arms and stepped closer. "I don't know what you're playing at Draco but I need to know where you stand. You can't play both sides, you have to pick a side!"
Draco could hardly believe it when there was a yelp followed by the distinct sound of the ancient piece of wood whistling as it spun through the air! Draco beamed, not even thinking twice as he reached up into the air with seeker's instinct and--
"Harry, are you ok?"
"Did she make it back to your place from work yesterday?" he asked, trying to piece together a timeline.
obviously."
worked that part out because, Merlin! How in the bloody hell was taking the time to work out Cedric Diggory's dick-print-landmark not a clue for you?!"
"Hello, mother." He hesitated for the briefest of moments before taking the seat across from her. He was surprised when she looked at him, head on, instead of avoiding his gaze. Still, a deep v set in her furrowed brow and Draco braced himself.
"But..." Harry's wry smile turned sad. "But then I worry that that's just me pretending I'm a regular teenage boy again and not an extremely fucked up one... Every time I let myself pretend that I can be normal and happy, then BOOM! I'm seeing dead bodies or remembering the most awful fucking things! What's going to happen if I get triggered during sex? What if I dissociate?" If he were honest, he had a lot of fear around it.
"Let me see your wand. I can send Stevens a patronus letting her know that she's the one who imperiused Robards, her role in all this, and that we've got her tied up with a bow for her under veritaserum. Hopefully they can get her to confess while she's still on the stuff and undo the imperius curse."
?! Potter, what the fuck?!" His nails bit into Harry's arm.
"Oh, you're going to love this..." He rolled his eyes. "Don't laugh!"
Draco merely rolled his eyes again. This whole situation was already shameful enough without him having to explain it to the bloody savior. Potter chuckled softly but took the cue.
Could he stop this without revealing himself? He still had the trace on him for another year and couldn't risk his magical signature being traced back to this place if he was... What? If he was seriously thinking about acting against the Dark Lord and helping Harry Fucking Potter? Was that what he was doing? Technically he just wanted to stop 2 vile and disgusting human beings from doing something he was sure the Dark Lord himself would surely disapprove of... Who was he kidding? This was tantamount to suicide.
Harry yawned widely. He didn't know why he still felt so tired. It was like his energy was just leaking out of him by the minute.
"Oh!" The girl's brown eyes went wide and she put on a performatively sweet voice. "What will it be for you today,
Blaise scoffed, "Why in the bloody hell would I help
"Oh yea, you'd be sad big time, I'm guessing. You'll probably go through that whole grief process, yet again." She nodded and Harry swallowed hard at the thought of it. "You've dealt with a lot of big sadness, Harry, do you think this one's going to be the one that undoes you?"
"Just imagine what you could have become if you hadn't bought into the whole
Harry was dreaming of haunting grey eyes and whispered '
"Ok," he said, breathlessly.
Draco Malfoy?!
"Oh! Hello, darling!" she said once she spotted him. His smile faltered as he watched the wicked witch drink up the sight of Harry Potter standing next to him. A grin spread slowly across her face and he caught the foreboding, tell-tale glint in her eye just a moment too late!
"Harry--"
"Now would I kid about something so deliciously rich?" Blaise flashed his pearly whites. "Draco, I don't have to tell you that this could catapult us to the next level. But I need you! You know my Bulgarian is shite and he only even agreed to hear me out because I threw in your name. He practically fangirled about you being in

expect anyone to trust you in a position of power or public service?" Robards scoffed. "OK, BRING IT IN!!!" he called out to the rest of the crowd, making it abundantly clear that he considered that the end of their conversation.
He was sat on the cold, stone floor of the detention area near courtroom 10 awaiting his trial. Robards had moved him here to level 10 early that morning and the chill in the air told Harry that the dementors were already posted somewhere in front of the courtrooms. It must be nearly time.
He and Healer Bubblykicks had done a lot of work to help him understand his rage. He had been struggling to come to terms with all of the things that had happened in his life to make him intimately acquainted with that oh so fun mixture of extreme anger and helplessness. The Dursleys had taught him to feel rage at a very early age. Voldemort, being the ultimate wanker, was a constant source of rage. Umbridge's very existence: rage. Dumbledore constantly keeping him in the dark had led to rage. Nearly every single person he began to get attached to being snatched away from him, so much fucking pain that the average person couldn't begin to imagine with a heaping side of
"Are you ok, Draco?" he asked, brow worried.
"Draco... Are you prepared for them to make that choice?"
He took a deep breath and strengthened his resolve as he let his feet carry him over to her. Her back stiffened visibly but she didn't turn around when she heard his approaching footsteps on the pebbled path.
Harry came closer so that they were standing with only about a foot between them. "You're brilliant," he breathed.
Robards continued: "Potter! Since you are ahead, you'll get first choice at a partner."
was how she said
She shook her head solemnly, her eyes trained on her son.
"Which is?"
Neither he nor Blaise had lived in the London flat for years but they'd held on to it for times when Draco returned (though he usually just preferred to stay with Andromeda) or, for Blaise, whenever he wanted to rendezvous with a certain redhead without fear that the neighbors of his Berkshire estate (who were all very much a part of the wizarding elite) might catch wind.
"Look, Harry, it's either Weaselette and Ginevra or

She laced her fingers with his and he forced a terse smile right as the bright light flashed, leaving him temporarily blinded.
for Harry -- not a care in the world. He really did love this beautiful, sexy, ever surprising man.
The boy's eyes widened. "Ok! Ok! Please don't tell Ms. Granger, sir!"
Narcissa laughed. "My sister can be very... persuasive. She's even convinced me that I should see a mind healer. I've been working with a woman named Bubblykicks for a few weeks now and she's surprisingly good. Slytherin woman, I'm sure."
a secret?"
"I think I'd better get me some lunch, too, Peter Piper," he said to the pink pygmy puff who was chowing down on a handful of Lucky Charms.
She rolled her eyes. "Whatever. I give up -- What do you all have in common?"
"Now, to what do I owe this very delightful, very
Draco and Harry exchanged glances and he watched as the rest of Draco's guard seemed to melt. To have these little ones genuinely care without it having to feel staged was clearly meaningful for him.
sort of thing."
The house elf lit up and bowed low in his direction.
"I don--" He stopped short as the sound of blood curdling wails made him whip around towards the entrance of his office.
Hermione gasped and Ron's mouth flapped open and shut like a fish out of water.
Suddenly, the air shook with Robards' booming voice:
does not."
"Yes, sir," he said, trying and failing to bite back his smile. Then he let out a little laugh. "You know, Draco, if you wanted your own 'Harry Potter adventure' that badly, you could've just said so."
Draco nodded slowly, still feeling a little bemused. He cleared his throat as he recovered from the strange yet intense interaction from moments before. "Yes... Yes! You'll be able to pick it up from evidence soon enough but we're hoping that you might have some information vital to catching this thief."
Harry's brow furrowed in confusion. "I'm sorry,
curse pulsed through him.
He could feel Draco smirk against his arse as he did it again, this time gently sucking on the skin there. Harry inhaled sharply. He wanted to shout at Draco that this was wrong! It was too much, too depraved! But then his wet tongue began to circle the tight ring of muscles
"Right," he said, crossing his arms and putting on his best diplomatic airs. "Potter, I'd like to apologize for anything I said or did last night--"
I was going to lose you." He shook his head. "Draco, I wasn't ok! No where near it! All that wound up happening when you left was that I shut down even more than before..."
Draco took out his wand and cast locking and silencing charms at the door before carefully unwrapping it. He furrowed his brow, bemused as he held up a round, plastic thing connected to a bizarrely shaped head contraption by a wiry black string.
"That's exactly what it means," he confirmed.
But the impact never came.
Harry was laid on the plush, velvet chaise in Healer Bubblykicks' office, having just spent the past 15 minutes catching her up to speed. The witch's eyes had gone wide with shock at several points throughout his story and, at one point, she had looked totally gobsmacked. All the while her quill scribbled rapidly into her note pad.
"Well, I welcome the challenge, sir." She smirked wryly and crossed her arms, champagne swirling with the movement. "Now you've
Draco was finding it very hard to pick his jaw up off the ground. Something was wrong. Something was very, very wrong. No wizard with even a hint of self-preservation would throw their wand in with the rubbish, not even as a joke! And especially not in these times -- no. This was just great. Harry Potter had literally just lost his fucking mind and Draco Malfoy was the only witness.
"Yep, as always. He looked a bit disappointed not to see you here, though."
line.
"Wait, let me just get some owl treats then you can distract me all you want," he said, suggestively, as he quickly relieved the owl of her post and turned to head back inside for treats. He stopped short, however, when he glanced down and caught sight of the moving picture on the front page.
He entered the sitting room and paused. Harry was curled up peacefully on the couch, the warm glow of the firelight making him look like a kid who'd fallen asleep waiting up too long for Father Christmas. Draco smiled. He lifted his copy of

Though there were still
Harry chuckled. Draco looked so out of place in his posh robes, surrounded by muggle technology. Harry thought it a true testament to how far the bloke had come since they were teenagers that he seemed intrigued by it all instead of abhorred.
Draco followed his gaze to the charming little inn across the way.
"Please don't," Harry cut him off, a plea in his eye. He watched as blonde eyebrows threatened to disappear into Draco's hairline.
He swallowed. He'd been on the verge of doing the obvious for days now but Hermione's warnings still rang loud in his mind. She nor Ron would approve and Draco... Well, he didn't want to worry Draco. And besides, he'd be doing it
He couldn't help but smile through the tears that rolled freely down his cheeks as he listened to
The sound of magically enchanted shears snipping, madly, nearby snapped him back to the reality at hand.
He had fancied boys, in a way, before but that was normal, wasn't it? Oliver Wood, Cedrick Diggory, Viktor Krum, Draco Malfoy... Didn't most wizards admire good, fit Quidditch players? It was like, with muggle sports, who didn't think David Beckham was the hottest thing under the sun? Was that... not normal? He blushed.
"Ah, yes. The auror offer." Harry couldn't keep the bitterness out of his voice. Malfoy raised an eyebrow, questioningly.
?" Harry looked up to see Snape staring back wearing a look of pure outrage. He looked over to Dumbledore who looked deeply saddened and he fixed his stare back to Snape, realizing that he didn't want pity. He wanted the outrage.
Harry pulled away and nodded. "I know he will, Hermione."
"You were saying?" he said as the newest owl flew away.
"Ha!" Pansy barked. "Of course not! It's Astoria."

It was Potter who first broke the silence again.
Draco was still standing right there beside him but he really wished that he could just shrink away instead of awkwardly lingering on the outskirts of their moment. But then Mrs. Weasley fixed him with her gaze and placed a hand on his arm.
She approached at just the right moment to overhear the one fit bloke with glasses hiss, sourly, to the other fit blonde bloke:
Harry licked his lips and let heavily lidded eyes rove over his fiancé.
Harry's wheels turned for a moment and Draco chuckled to himself when it became clear that it finally clicked, his mouth forming into an obvious "O."
couldn't back it up all those years ago."
"We were able to round up most of the students who cast at you. Most of them were Slytherin and a few of them were from other houses but just got caught up in group think. Theodore Nott did manage to slip away but since every other wand has been tested and accounted for, we're assuming that he was the one who cast the killing curse. The Aurors are on the case," he briefed him. Draco thought briefly that he really would make a good Auror if only he wanted to be one.
"No, haven't the foggiest!" he said as he quickly ushered them to the door. "Do let me know when you catch the tosser!"
!" he said.
Blood curses were such an ancient and barbaric thing! It had long went out of favor among most who practiced the dark arts.
"These ones are Ginny's!" he said, pointing to the smaller set.
"No... I'm not drinking tonight, I'm alright."
There was a long moment of silence.
the fact that you've had reported sightings all along the Australian coast?" he asked, trying and failing to keep his voice even.
"I'm so sorry, Harry! I never should have left!"
"Wow," was all he could manage to say.
"Yes!" he said, scrambling to his feet. Draco searched his eyes. Ron just sat there, smirking coolly.
"Harry..." Draco got out between kisses as Harry's hand made its way underneath his shirt and began exploring the spans of skin there. "This isn't going to end well if you're worried about getting attached..."
"Well, she's not exactly my type, is she?"
he said again as tight, velvet, heat wrapped around him.
"Ok, team!" Harry clapped his hands together as he walked purposefully to the head of Meeting Room A accompanied by an onslaught of wolf-whistles from the roomful of Aurors.
"She was someone I am unfamiliar with. As you can imagine, my work requires...
Potter was blessedly silent for a good 30 seconds while he chewed his artery clogging meal and then: "Malfoy, may I ask what made you decide to become an Auror?"
"Right you are, Ms. Granger! 10 points for Gryffindor!" he exclaimed. "Now Mr. Potter, I hear you've got a stellar corporeal patronus that you've had mastered since 3rd year! My word! I've never heard of such a thing!" he said, practically bouncing on the balls of his feet.
Harry swallowed hard. "You're just drunk, Draco. You need to hydrate. Sit up and drink."
"I don't know," he lied.
Ron shrugged. "Harry, you've been gay for Malfoy for the past 7 years." Harry raised both eyebrows in surprise. "I just never expected you to act on it because he was...
Sure, they were technically separated and she had basically told him to fly free -- to reconnect with Draco, even. But what kind of piece of shite would he be to move on or get wrapped up in some heated fling with an old flame before he's even made sure that she's still alive?
To his annoyance, Potter ventured from his side and began to explore the shop on his own, leaving him alone with the greasy git.
"Of course," he said with conviction. It didn't matter. Harry needed him. He watched as his shoulders dropped with relief though he still looked nervous. "What do you want to tell them?"
She scanned her wand over the ID for verification and then waved it through the air. Draco ducked as a file flew across the room and just barely missed his head. She caught it easily and donned a pair of glasses as she flipped through the file until she found what she was looking for.
Draco cringed and felt his flush reach his ears. At first from embarrassment and then from rage. For the first time, he looked down at his left forearm in disgust and wondered what in the fuck had he gotten himself into? Were all the godawful things people said about death eaters true? And father?! His father was a part of this foul depravity?! Did he not care? Did he not care about mother?!
Harry felt like death when he awoke: his body was stiff against the hard floor beneath him, his mouth felt like carpet, and his head pounded against his skull relentlessly. The empty bottle of alcohol lie next to him, mockingly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry shook his head adamantly. "No. No one should wield that wand, Draco -- not even us. And besides," he said as his thoughts drifted off to the white marble tomb near the lake, well within the safety of the boar-topped gates of Hogwarts. "Trust me when I say it's in one of the most secure places it could possibly be."
jet coming directly for him as he stood there wandless. He realized too late that Theo and the 7th year death eaters were amongst the crowd. Harry, who was dazed and confused just moments earlier, was suddenly snapped into a crystal clear clarity as he closed the distance between them, shielding Draco with his own back and knocking him off his feet. As they arched through air, he watched as Ronald Weasley moved with more swiftness and dexterity than he would've ever believed possible of the ginger as he lifted Ginny Weasley, who had been left frozen in shock on the spot, with one arm and placed her safely behind him and then turned to stand his ground; Hermione moved with a fury that was downright frightening, skidding to a crouched halt with her hair flying wildly as she too moved to stare down the jets; at the same time, Neville and Parvati leapt to join them swiftly and unquestioningly and, most surprising of all, Luna Lovegood had stopped dancing to leap into action, wearing a fierce expression he'd only ever seen her take on briefly in moments when people made fun of the Quibbler.
He puffed out his chest, defensively, but deflated under the gaze her wry,

"Shall we help them out?"

"Sorry, love. Let me just make sure the world's not on fire then how bout you meet me in the shower so we can finish what we started?"
. Draco chuckled and pat the seat next to him.
Draco looked away.
would it be different?"
Was Ginny hurt?
"Blimey, Harry! You weren't kidding when you said you had a lot going on this week!"
"Wand... Wand..." he said, apparently too riled up to think straight as he absentmindedly pat down his muggle hoodie and jeans, searching for his wand that was surely still somewhere back in an evidence locker at the ministry. "Draco, I need your wand!" he said, suddenly.
They reached number 13B and entered the familiar old shop, the bell above the door signaling their arrival to Borgin who hastily shuffled towards them.
"Oh." Harry crossed his arms protectively. Was this it? Was it starting already?
"No, Draco-- that's bloody brilliant!" Harry exclaimed! He had been raised muggle but the idea of leaving the wizarding world for a few years to pursue a degree at uni had never even occurred to him. And to hear Draco, who had once thought of muggles as something less than human, sound thrilled about learning from them was... unfathomable!
A hush grew around him and more and more eyes turned in his direction. Granger turned, wide eyes on him, too, just as surprised by the use of her first name as everyone else but it was important that she listen to him. He had a hunch that she might be the only one who could understand. He doubted most of the students even knew what dissociating was yet alone why Harry might be doing it. But she was the brightest witch in their year and one of Potter's best friends.
"Your mother is right. There
"Huh... Maybe I should give
"Ok, Potter." Harry straightened out as Draco marched back into the room, now donning a look of determination. He placed the tray on the coffee table and then briskly turned to face Harry with arms folded firmly across his chest.
Harry's bespectacled eyes widened, taken aback.
Harry nodded. "Yes. Now, what is it you wanted to try?" he said, eyes raking Draco up and down.
She reached across the small table to place a hand on his.
Harry's eyebrows shot up. He gazed up, sceptically, into rueful grey eyes. "Really?"
" Harry's lips lingered in that
Draco raised a finger mid-chew and closed his eyes as he savored his bite of perfectly golden, battered cod. Harry rolled his eyes and waited, impatiently. He didn't know what he'd been expecting, had he ever let himself dream about reuniting, but it was a weird sort of relief to see that Draco was the same ol' prat that he'd always been. Perhaps a bit bolder and certainly freer, but still the annoying, demanding man that he'd known. And they fell so easily back into their old banter that Harry could almost forget that the void of the past five and a half years had existed.
he knew what was going on within his own household, including all the bullshite he bloody well wished he didn't. But... not today.
If Draco could open his eyes then he would roll them at the barely hushed voices of his best friends who were clearly plotting outside his bedroom door. As if Potter were a reason to stay. If anything, he were a reason to run screaming in the opposite direction! And this was all his fault to begin with!
"Do I know you?" he asked hopefully.
! I needed to live it!"
in a real wand battle a day in your life, have you?" Harry inwardly groaned with the realization.
! Erhm... Thanks, Anavi." He rubbed at the back of his neck sheepishly and she smiled as she exited and Hermione entered.
Draco frantically searched his eyes. "Harry..."
Wait-- Draco, what are you wearing?"
For Draco, most of his transactions in this work were very cut and dry, which he usually liked, quite honestly -- but there was something endearing about how personable Sebastian was that made their relationship evolve into a friendship of sorts. It certainly helped that the bloke was also bent and had been able to help Draco find community through his work with the Oceana Wizarding Pride Alliance. Draco had come to appreciate the freedom of queer spaces in New York and had been nervous about rebuilding a sense of community in Australia. Fortunately, Sebastian had been all too willing to act as his guide for all things queer in the Land Down Under. It was pretty obvious that he'd like to show him a
of their third year: the
"What in the bloody hell is that?!" Pansy asked, just as thoroughly confused as he.
Draco scoffed.
"I don't know what I want anymore. But everyone else wants me to be an auror so that's probably what I'll do," he said, resigned.
Ron went tight-lipped.
Theo's face turned red and contorted with rage as he gripped his wand tightly in his fist.
cute little shy one. You're the most genuine when you let the mask slip. Why don't you want other people to see that?"
They had been enjoying their first chaos-free morning together -- Harry sprawled across his chest, breath ghosting over the fine blonde hairs there in post coital bliss -- when Ronald Weasley had come barging into Harry's room, unannounced. Draco hadn't bothered to cover up as Weasley turned scarlet and covered his eyes (served him right) or Harry scrambled to summon pants. Ron had hastily invited Harry to a Weasley event this afternoon (before fleeing blindly and running into a wall with his eyes still closed).
He looked back up at Draco who was eying him warily.
Harry and Draco both spun around to see Hermione, Ron, Blaise, and Ginny raise their glasses in agreement but were surprised to see that George, Angelina, and
"No!" Draco huffed. "You run along, I'm having fun. Go do whatever it is you bloody need to do."
"You know I can' tell you that, Harry." He shook his head.

"We have lots! Ginevra is alive and she's being held captive by Sebastian at his sheep station in Thundelarra!"
!" Hermione insisted, wearily. She looked disheveled and was clearly pouring too much of herself into her work, again. They were hovering over her desk -- which was covered in files about house elf rights -- and both fighting to get a word in over the other.
Ginny came up for air and shifted to straddle his hips, slowly sheathing him in tight, wet, heat. Pleasure built deep in his groin as she rocked her hips, slowly at first, then more urgently as she reflexively squeezed around him.
Thought he was too concerned with status?" Well that was certainly saying something.
And that's when the tears came. And then the flat out drunken sobbing in the middle of a muggle gay bar in Soho, London.
"DRACO!

Hermione nodded. "Harry, would you ever consider..."
"Ha!" she barked. "What's the bloody point of that, Harry? You're just going to do what you want regardless. The question is just what
"What in the?" Yaxley howled, letting go of Harry's hair, eyes searching for his wand. Rowle was a beat behind him but the fire was spreading quickly with so many flammable books, parchments, and ominous potions ingredients littered about the room. They gave up on the wand search to try to put it out manually, pants still around their ankles.
Draco was on his feet in seconds and ran right past the woman to shamelessly wrap his arms tightly around Potter's shoulders and bury his face into the crook of the man's neck. He didn't even care when tears began to roll down his face and land there.
"Savage!" Daphne gave a wry smile in appreciation.
Draco nodded in agreement and then kissed him chastely. "Well I'm here. I'll be right by your side. ...If you want me to."
ME!" Harry shouted in a plea desperate enough to break Draco's heart.
that had been building up for at least 5 years -- but maybe a lifetime -- flow through him as he swung and he swung and he swung until the portrait was no more and the brick wall on which she had been displayed now lay crumbled at his feet.
it?" he cut in sharply.
"And Harry was already at work then! Although... I suppose he did rush out around that time to go meet up with Mundungus... I remember wanting to tell him about the pregnancy before my 11am meeting," she contemplated.
The young, blonde man looked out stoically, long plaited hair and dressing gown blowing gently in the morning breeze as twilight set in over Melbourne. He leaned over the glass balustrade of the rooftop terrace, hot tea nestled in his hands, as he reflected on the past 72 hours.
What very little color Malfoy had seemed to drain from his face and Harry turned panicked eyes to Ron as if he desperately wanted to ask him what his normal was.
"Great. Why is the culprit always connected to
"It's totally wicked!" Teddy agreed with way too much vigor for this hour of the day. Draco grinned fondly while noting that
He had arrived back to Melbourne late last night only to find his favorite Australian investor in a
And it tugged at something deep inside of Draco that was quite inappropriate for the occasion.
Draco gave him that breathtaking smile. "Interesting."
"Oh! Sorry, Potter. I completely loss the thread with that one. Just... sorry."
"Hmmm... That's good to know, buddy," he said as he summoned Teddy's things and headed to the front of the room where Andromeda was already waiting.
"You like that?" he said between soft kisses and gentle sucking.
"I have no idea what you two were talking about but Malfoy just acted like a real teenager for a good 2 minutes. Whatever that was, bottle it, cork it, and let's take it to dinner!" exclaimed Ginny with a clap of her hands.
Hermione lifted her eyes from the evidence to fix him with a sad, knowing gaze.
to! After that speech you gave, there was no way I could return back to Great Britain without her, now could I?!" They all laughed.
Harry's eyes widened and the heat rushed to his face at the realization. He wanted to melt into the floor but Draco was doing that thing where he bit his lip and his eyes sparkled as he tried his hardest not to laugh and it just made Harry want to laugh out loud. And so he did. And then so did Draco and it was the most beautiful sound. Harry smiled endearingly.
"I'm sorry, you can't be back here without an appointment, I have a customer."
"Yes!" Harry clapped his hands excitedly and pumped his fist into the air, drawing startled looks from the other restaurant goers and surprise from the blonde man across from him. "That's the inn we stayed at about a year or two after the war! My cousin, Dudley, wanted to make amends and I wanted to tell him to fuck off, but, Gin thought I should do it -- for healing and all that --"
They looked up to see Harry and Draco both visibly touched but still pointedly not looking at each other.
Harry shook his head. He looked thoughtful as he silently examined the staff. After long moments, he finally turned to fix Draco with sincere, curious eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Hey, Teddy," Harry deflected loud enough to catch the young boy's attention. "What do you say we all go out back and fly? I think you might be ready for a real broom!"
He was a persistent bugger, but Draco didn't mind. He made good company in a foreign land and he was slowly wearing down his guards. What had started as monthly meetings somehow turned into weekly lunches then nights out on the town with friends.
He nodded, although somehow not completely reassured. He was glad that his friend was trying to understand and be open but, realistically, was that enough to withstand a lifetime together?
"I'll explain later," Harry rolled his eyes before turning back to the woman. "What happened next?"
He smiled down at Draco who smiled back up at him.
Draco wasn't surprised. Three years had passed and
"Oh, great. Another power hungry ego-maniac taking an interest in my life." Harry rolled his eyes and then reached out to pull Draco up onto his feet and into his arms.
he breathed as naturally as if the name belonged on the tip of his every exhale.
Least of all, the fact that this all supposedly happened late Monday morning, early afternoon...
They had barely had even a moment to breathe between giving statements, filling out paperwork, and managing press; but it was all worth it because, after what's already being hailed as the speediest trial in wizengamot history, Sebastian Krafft was officially behind bars and under strict dementor watch in Azkaban!
with Ginny had first started to become... dubitable. The London storm had matched the mood and Draco didn't think he would ever forget the torment on his usually stalwart friend's face.
"Ok." Draco stared intensely into his eyes. "Ok, let's see what you like," he said as he leaned in and captured Harry's bottom lip and sucked on it gently, his firm hands making their way to Harry's back. Harry mewled and wrapped his arms around Draco's waist, pulling them closer and relishing the feel of his wet, toned muscles flexing against his skin. Draco paused to slowly run his teeth along the scruff of his jawline, stopping when he reached his ear and sucking on his earlobe. Harry gasped. "Remember to breathe," he said softly into his ear, the vibrations resonating directly in Harry's groin. "Be mindful of the sensations you feel in the here and now without getting stuck in your head. And if there's anything you don't like or you want me to stop, promise me you'll let me know." Harry moaned in response. Draco licked at the tender spot under his ear and Harry thought he might come undone. Draco pulled away abruptly and he was left whimpering.
Draco smirked and kissed him chastely before walking him backwards to the top of the bath. Harry was surprised when he placed both hands on his bum and lifted him up so that he was sat perched on the side of the bath, Draco's eyes now level with his chest and his mouth very close to his... Was he really going to do
"Ok. And no member of any of the families would be able to speak on this crime?"
"The point being that: Gin being the latest in a long line of Weasleys whose arse you've saved is reason enough to remind you that we love you and that we're happy for you, no matter what."
Harry looked down at his hands and shook his head. Ginny had left a clue that only he could ever pick up on in a place that probably no one else in their world was as familiar with. The clever witch was leaving him a trail.
The past four months since the Battle of Hogwarts had meant far too many ceremonies and appearances as the guest of honor for this or that, calls for his expert testimony in pending wizengamot trials, ministry discussions on reform, and he'd somehow been forced onto three boards whose roles he didn't even fully understand. He felt drained and checked out and most times he chose not to even speak at all at those things but, somehow, the Prophet had taken to describing him as "
"Is that another letter from your father?" Blaise nodded towards the letter in his hand.
the thousand year old tree they'd been pressed against just moments prior!
Harry snorted and Draco blushed, fiercely, mouth opening and closing as if he didn't know where to even begin.
Harry sighed.
. Boy is that going to take some getting used to!"
because Voldemort's ignorance of that bit meant that he was never truly able to master the wand. In fact, when I disarmed you at the Manor, I unknowingly became the possessor of not only the Hawthorne wand, but also the Elder Wand."
gotten you all up in a tizzy today?"
He reached over and grabbed Harry's wrist and Harry's breath caught.
"Sebastian," he said frankly as the sound of footsteps on wood flooring grew closer and made their way around the chair. He could sense the man bend low so that they were face-to-face and winced when a hand reached out to pull down the blindfold that had been covering his eyes. He was surprised, once his retinas had recovered from the shock, to find that he was sat in a familiar looking sitting room with Sebastian hovering over him and Hristofor and Grozdan looming in the background. He rolled his eyes and shot Hristofor, the lying dolt whose home he now found himself in again, a sardonic look before returning his gaze to Sebastian. "So I'm guessing Goyle didn't really need details for the bachelor party," he stated more than asked.
Harry started to sprint outright through the crowds towards the remaining fireplaces as stunners made their way through the hazy remnants of the darkness powder.
"Where were you, mate?" he said from Hermione's other side. "I woke up to use the loo and you were gone. I figured you must've went for a walk but then you never came back..."
Finally, Harry opened his eyes to watch messy red hair bob up and down, his wife slurping enthusiastically along his length.
Draco did smirk at Harry's attempt to use his own words against him but it faded, turning rueful. Darkened grey eyes stared into green and Harry watched the intricate battle of heart and mind at war behind them. "Harry... Are you sure?"
! And let's keep this whole business between us. The last thing we need is
"Don't Go Breaking My Heart" - Elton John
"Slytherins." He rolled his eyes.
"By 'go for it' did you mean bring me a bouquet of flowers and say
"So, any luck working out what Sebastian wants with the Elder Wand?"
"Well, we really couldn't help that you were of particular interest to the Dark Lord, Garrick. What were we supposed to do? Jeopardize the group for the one? We are bound not to--"
"Thanks, Harry! Thanks, Draco!" they beamed before they ran off.
Harry tried to be good and not spill but one errant bead of cum escaped his lips as Draco pulled away. The Slytherin tsked and used his finger to catch it as it dribbled down Harry's chin. Harry couldn't help but groan when he swiped it back over his bottom lip, one slender finger pushing into his mouth.
"Yah!" Teddy's smile was so sincere and sweet that Harry couldn't help but return it.
Riply disappeared with a loud crack, leaving the two of them alone.
Harry reluctantly pulled away from the kiss.
"What are you going to do, now?"
"Draco, the things you said back there... To Anavi... How did you know them?"
" Blue light shot out of Potter's wand and a compass, an amulet, and a carving knife were illuminated in various partially hidden spots throughout the room.
When he finally made it to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement on level 2, the Aurors were already heading into a large meeting room. He slipped into the room without issue and, when he recognized Stevens, a witch from his training year, he took the seat behind her hoping to overhear anything that could give him a clue as to where Harry was being held.
Draco paused with with his fork halfway to his mouth and cocked his head, curiously, as the animated little pink, green, and blue girls beat up the weird green monkey.
The brunette grinned as the beady-eyed bloke power-walked off towards the public restroom, cheeks clinched tightly.
"But, Harry-- Will you
"Plus, I'll publicly show my support for both of you," Harry said. "We'll all walk to the Great Hall together and I can be nice and supportive while the two of you hold hands. That way, it will hopefully be clear that this isn't a surprise to me and that we've been broken up at least long enough for you to form a new relationship and for me to be ok enough to give you my blessing. And that way when me and Draco eventually come out they wont think I stepped out on Ginny, either."
would be unwise, for anyone. He thought, carefully, and paled when he realized that, for once in his life, staunch honesty may actually be the most strategic move...
Hermione laughed. "
I've ever worked for! And to think, you were only supposed to be a decoy! Enough of a distraction to shake up the bloke's already fucked up marriage so that it'd look too incriminating for Potter if he didn't cooperate. Then you'd come back to Melbourne, Potter would give up the wand, and you and I would probably be back to sipping coffee right now."
Harry and Anavi both turned towards Draco, shocked by both his words and the sudden shift of energy in the room as he paced back and forth. Draco's patience had been wearing thin from the moment the woman had started talking but, now, he looked absolutely livid. Harry was surprised when the furniture began to shake and, for once, it wasn't him doing it.
Draco reached out to take his hand in his, leading them to sit side-by-side under a large beech tree.

"Teenager?" She gave him a wry, knowing look.
Malfoy put his head down and laughed into the table. "I was going to say '
It was Mr. Weasley who spoke next:
"C'mon, I know something you'd like," he said, leading Draco to the sitting room.
"I don't like it and I still don't trust you, Malfoy.
He needed time and he needed backup.
Draco pushed off of the wall he'd been casually leaning against, hooded cloak pulled low over his face, and joined Pansy as she strode out of the café sipping a coffee.
Harry laughed and then whistled. "Now
Harry shot Draco a furtive glance.
"Draco, darling, you know that you are always welcome at my parent's home, right? Maybe you should stop by around dinner time tonight." She smiled, knowingly.
The third thing that really sealed the deal, and perhaps Harry's fate in going "goo-goo eyed" and caring way too much about the blonde git, was when Teddy started to gets posh gifts from 'Santa' every year that were far too extravagant for a toddler. Last year's box set of little practice snitches with the Black insignia on them were kind of a dead give away. Andromeda cursed whoever sent them every time Harry would release them in the house and pick Teddy up to zoom him around and try and catch one, but she didn't know who they'd come from. She entertained his theory that it might be from her estranged nephew, mostly for Harry's sake, but she remained skeptical because she insisted that Draco had never even met Teddy.
"Granger, I will give you everything you need to send every pureblood law to hell in a hand-basket if you can help me get into the ministry without detection!" he shouted around Ron's tall form.
"Too late, challenge accepted!" He smiled lasciviously, lowering his forearms on either side of Harry's head and kissing him fervently.
"Yea, maybe he knows why she might've flooed there."
"My point being, I'm not entirely surprised by Sebastian's preconceived notions of me... it's sort of in line with what most people expect. Not everyone looks for the good articles..."
allowed him to be worshiped (like the diva he was) instead of ridiculed, then Harry was all for it!
"I would love to get a demonstration from the war hero of your tried and true patronus charm! Can you show the class?"
He continued to stare at his folded hands, despondently. There was a pause and then he heard the click of her heels walking away.
"Wha's it worth to you?"
Harry scoffed in feigned indignation. "Because it was

Of course, never in a million years did I think that the pointy git that I had grown to love-to-hate was going to step in and swoop my best mate off his feet, become a powerhouse for good in the wizarding world, and, in the process, become one of my favorite mates, too." He rolled his eyes. "To my best mate -- my brother -- Harry: You deserve all of the good things in the world and a lifetime of happiness and I'm so glad that you've found that in Draco. To my new brother-in-law, Draco, you still irritate my soul at times but I guess I'll let you share my best friend. I love you both. Cheers!" Draco smiled brilliantly and lifted his glass to Ron.
"What did that prick want?" Ron asked, struggling to push his and Hermione's trunks, topped by Crookshanks and Pigwidgeon, into the cart a moment later.
"And Ron," he said, pushing his bewildered friend forward. "Just follow our lead and sing the chorus at the top of your lungs."
Harry glanced at the books spread out on the floor: Home Life and Social Habits of British Muggles; Muggles Who Notice; My Life as a Muggle; and Cooking the Muggle Way.
"And none of these items have come across your eye of late?" Draco raised a brow in question.
"Ginny Potter, Britain's favourite Quidditch sweetheart! Do you mind giving us a word about what Harry's inauguration means to you?"
"Loony? Round the bin?" Draco pressed, brow furrowed, seriously.
Harry clapped his hands, thrilled by the prospect of some real movement! "You think we might actually have him?"
"Sure, why not?" She smiled smugly and he shook his head. What he had experienced with Draco had been intense passion but Ginny still had the ability to make him feel special during the times when he felt his worst. What that meant, he didn't know. Neither did he know where they stood or what either of them needed, but the fact that she could still show up for him at a time like this as his friend meant something. "How are you, Harry, really?"
"Draco, I'm sorry. We can't go down this path."
" from the littler ones who, if he was being real, were actually quite cute.
"Does that feel good?" he asked. Harry, nodded fervently. He tugged gently with his teeth and Harry hissed with pleasure, his cock pulsing against Draco's thigh. "You're very responsive, Harry. I like that." He kissed his nipple and moved to repeat the dance with the right one. Draco let his hands run down Harry's sides and back up his abdomen and chest, standing up straight to kiss Harry's lips again. His tongue swept across his bottom lip and Harry moaned into the kiss as Draco's left hand traveled up to the nape of his neck and deepened the kiss, their tongues and teeth clashing passionately. Harry's breath hitched as Draco's right hand began its slow descent back down his abdomen and then --
"Oh, Harry, dear!" she beamed, enveloping Harry in a big hug and then stepping back to examine him with one hand on either side of his face. "I am so glad you're alright! Oh it was pure
"You've had a lot of big losses
Draco closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Snape, the man he had revered and respected, was killed over a
update, ever since. Thankfully, she hadn't heard a peep from Sebastian since he'd finished chewing her out for yesterday's
He swallowed around the lump in his throat, "Well... I suppose... You probably know that I am getting married?"
It was in that moment, when he realized that Ron was foregoing curry, that it occurred to him that maybe this was a bigger deal than he thought.
" she cried and looked to Harry with a silent plea for him to put an end to this. Harry opened his mouth to speak but Draco placed a hand on his arm to stop him.
"Er-hmm" Lucius cleared his throat and they startled apart. "You may use the floo. You can stay the night but that's all. While I'll heed your advice and not actively invoke any unnecessary inquiries onto this family, I also will not make a habit of harboring fugitives in this home."
They followed the thief through the wine cellar that Harry had come through and out onto the grounds.
He was already trying not to choke on his guilt when a barn owl flew through the open doors and zoomed past them, dropping something green into Draco's lap and abruptly flying away.
"I don't understand!" Granger said on the verge of tears as she tried again to cast the right spell. "Nothing's working!"
to cast a patronus!"
Both sets of ginger and brown eyebrows rose in surprise but his two best mates nodded enthusiastically. They were there. They were always there, really. The constant proof that there were people in his life who always managed to both make it through and come through and, gods willing, so would Draco!
He just stared back at her with furrowed brow. A beat passed until she climbed off and kissed him, once more, before she slipped on her dressing gown and made to start her day.
have together. You two have it all figured out so please tell me: What in the bloody hell am I supposed to do with that?"
"And then you just left her there, by herself, to catch your portkey?" Harry asked, trying to keep his voice even.
"Well Sebastian wasn't particularly secretive about his fascination with my past." Harry blinked back at him in surprise. "From the very beginning, he was curious about how, not only my views, but also -- maybe even moreso -- the public narrative around me had changed so vastly in such a short span of time."
all the time now?"
he thought to himself. Draco Malfoy was touching him
"Wait, Draco -- you know this man he's talking about?!"
"Potter!" Sebastian spit viciously before turning and adding:
"So, you just weren't going to tell me that I'm nuts?" Harry stirred him from his thoughts, green eyes sparkling with amusement.
His godfather was a man of simple tastes and the bedroom only contained a large four poster bed in the middle of the room, a wardrobe in the left corner, a desk in the right corner, and a chair in front of the fireplace along the left wall. He said a quick spell to turn off the lights and climbed under the covers.
Harry didn't care what issues they might've had, he couldn't fathom the idea of Ginny being hurt or held hostage somewhere and, the thought of her not coming home to them... He shook his head in resolve.
you expect me to do while you chat up the Parkinsons?"
Draco abruptly grabbed him by the chin and kissed him deeply. Harry felt himself melt and his already half-hard cock grow. Shockwaves went through him and he moaned into the kiss as he felt it connect with Draco's hard length and they rubbed together briefly. Draco released him and exhaled a shuddering breath to try to compose himself but, when he spoke, it was with a raspy voice and his eyes were dark with lust. "I could be so much more than a tease for you, Harry, but I need to know what's off limits first, ok?"
"But what about --" she started, waving another piece of mail. Harry recognized the Daily Prophet's insignia and cut her short.
"Harry." He coiled his hand around Harry's hair and tugged, gently but firmly, so that Harry was at his mercy, neck exposed. He started at the base of his throat and then let his teeth and bottom lip lightly scrap upward, detouring and stopping just below his ear so that when he spoke -- voice rough with want and wavering restraint -- Harry could feel every syllable. "
"What do you mean?" George bounced to his feet and rubbed his hands together excitedly.
"Shit! You were right, Rowle!" The approaching footsteps stopped next to him and a bulking man with a brutal face appeared in front of him, eyes flying wide as he searched out the scar. "It really is Potter! Let's alert the Dark Lord! We shall be rewarded greatly for this!"
"Wow." He shook his head. "I had no idea! Malfoy, why on Earth would you be marrying a woman then??"
"Oooh!!!" Hermione squealed. "That's amazing, Draco. I could organize it and get membership and figure out how to break them up by year or topics and you can use all your psych knowledge and grounding to educate people and make it a safe space like you do for Harry and --"
time."
He put down his chopsticks and slowly chewed his mouthful of pad thai, green eyes considering his friend closely. Draco Malfoy was murky territory that he'd been avoiding for nearly 6 years.
Harry wondered if Draco could somehow see the fissure forming in his heart because his ice melted to be replaced with something shy and remorseful.
glad I didn't miss that!"
He felt her calming hand on his from across the table.
His heart beat quickly as he stared around the room full of mostly freckled faces. It looked as if the
"I'm sorry, Ron. There
She sounded tormented but he couldn't pick his eyes up from their spot on the table to look at her.
He was cut off when he noticed a little head poke out from the isle over. 2 more followed suit and hushed whispering ensued as a little brown haired Gryffindor boy, a blond haired Hufflepuff girl, and raven haired Slytherin girl all peaked out at them. From the looks of it, they had to be first years and Draco wondered if it was the same boy from earlier.
Harry rolled his eyes and then smirked smugly. "I'm a pretty good Auror, you know. That means I connect some pretty interesting dots... Like the fact that '
"Well, I'm seldom a yeller but I can promise to keep you on your toes by being insufferably disorganized," he smiled, apologetically.
"Draco, shouldn't you be busy with wedding stuff? The ceremony is in what?" Harry did the math. "A little less than 18 hours?"
He sighed loudly in resignation.
Green eyes stared deep into gray and Draco faltered. When he thought about it, he supposed if anyone deserved an answer to the "why" then it was probably the bloke who made it all possible to begin with.
Before he knew it (and despite his warnings), Harry was sitting down beside him in front of the fire and pulling him into his arms. He sobbed against Harry's chest, feeling mortified but unable to stop it -- the day's events and years worth of denial finally catching up to him. Soft lips pressed into his hair and then he felt Harry's voice vibrate as he spoke into the fire.
"It's fine, Pansy will tell me later." He smirked as he climbed out and made to leave.
"We were so worried!" Ariela said, eyes bright and on the verge of tears.
Harry contemplated that for a moment. Maybe Draco was right. It
"STEP TWO!" Ginny shouted over her brother. "Make Draco seem likable."
"I don't even have casual sex with girls! And you want me to... to flip my whole world upside down and lay myself bare just so you can have one night of fun?!" He was fuming.
"Nope! You made me take the fucking muggle
"Draco," he whispered.
"Can't we... Can't we just put it on hold? See if we can't find a more suitable companion?"
Harry frowned.
Draco opened and closed his mouth several times as he tried to find a way to dispute Harry's blatant flattery. Finally, he gave up and smiled sheepishly, looking up at Harry through long lashes. "I
Malfoy cocked his head and raised an eyebrow as his eyes searched Harry critically for a few moments while he contemplated. Harry suddenly felt nervous as it occurred to him that Malfoy had absolutely no reason to let him in. He had made it clear that they weren't friends and they probably never would be and that realization hit him with an unexpected sadness. Just as he was bracing himself to head back to Gryffindor tower, Draco raised his wand and adjusted the wards to let Harry in. A bewildering mixture of joy, hope, and excitement lit up inside him as he stepped over the threshold.
"No, sir. Neither is Miss Pansy. Only my eldest master is here, sir. He and his friends have just set down in the drawing room for their monthly gobstones game. Would you like me to let him know that you're here?"
"Yea, I was just doing my job. Trying to be the best that I can be and all that."

Pansy chortled. "Oh, there's nothing coincidental about --" She stopped short and cleared her throat.
"I'm sure anybody could speak on the crimes," she answered, carefully.
"Then why put me in

"Nope, only one pie chart of blame here, Harry."
going to give the flying lessons?" whined Wilamina.
Draco lifted his knees and wrapped his arms around them. He bit his lip, his glasses somehow making him look almost childlike as he stared back at Harry.
! You do realize that the longer you sit here, the greater my chances of being hexed?" He looked around again. Apparently last week's incident wasn't enough of a warning for Potter.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Malfoy, how many blokes have you been with?"
" He frowned, knowing full well that he sounded petulant and petty. "Is this really the battle you want to pick right now?" he hissed.
"What do you want, Draco?" she said after a long moment.
"Well, Mr. Malfoy, it seems that you've been making a lot of those tough choices of late." Mcgonagall nodded at the arm wrapped around Harry and he felt him stiffen. "I've been keeping a close eye on our supposed resident
"Me, too, Draco. Me, too." They laughed together.
When Draco witnesses Harry be raped by death eaters the summer before 6th year, all of his convictions are questioned as he steps in to save Harry's life. When they return to Hogwarts after the war, Harry and Draco both struggle to define themselves outside of the roles that everyone expects of them while helping each other heal from their respective traumas.
And she had been there for him every step of the way, since.
Harry fidgeted impatiently while he wait, his legs bouncing up in down with frenzied energy. The room he'd been locked in was empty except for the lone table and chair at which he was sat and four floating candelabra in each corner of the dimly lit space.
"No, no. I must bear in mind that even the great Harry Potter has his limitations."
Harry looked fierce but focused as he took off following the gold forms and their shining footsteps.
There were already a few esteemed witches and wizards on board coming from level one and Draco had to wonder if any of them might be a part of Harry's trial.
Yes. Now that's another thing I never would have expected. We were proud arch enemies for many years.
"My guess would be extreme over compensation," Draco mumbled, distractedly, eyes still concentrating hard on the wall. "Harry, did you check for muggle records? For that period there?" He pointed at the blank stretch of wall marked by a big, red question mark.
"I honestly don't really know what to say..."

"I want another one," he said simply as he reached the last song and let it play. He interlaced their fingers as they resumed their slow walk to the apparition point and the soulful notes of Mariah Carey's

The members of the wizengamot were filing down the hall and into to courtroom. They watched as they walked right past the dementors, untouched.
"Kreacher, focus." Harry commanded.
"Is that why you're here this year? You were hoping for normalcy?" he asked and Harry nodded. "I know you got the Auror offer so you didn't really have to come back."
"Yep, I think so. But how about lunch on me before you and Teddy head off to his playdate with Victore?"
Draco had convinced himself that the odds of encountering the man during his short visit were slim to none, and even still, he'd mentally tried to run down the list of all his long forgotten evasive Auror maneuvers,
He shot her his deadliest raised brow.

"Where in the
"Well..." he said, twiddling with a strand on his pajamas. "I met a bloke named Harold Pots who studied psychology at some muggle place called Uni..." He paused, studying Harry's reaction. Harry just stared back at him, blankly, until the oddness of the statement hit him.
" He nodded towards the two boys in questions who now looked like they might soon come to blows. "--ever since!"
, you're still innocent for now..."
"I don't know," Ron said, concern etched on his face. "I think he might've been confounded."
"Yes, yes -- justice!" He nodded as he stepped onto the lift behind Robards.
Harry cocked his head to the side thoughtfully as he studied Malfoy.

Harry's cock twitched and he swallowed hard, his mouth suddenly very dry.
"No! I will not have the man who corrupted my son staying under my roof!" she snarled, furiously.
"Oh, he definitely has moves alright."
"Aha! Your floo was used once that day from your flat in London to a stop in Holyhead but... Oh, this is peculiar... it immediately changed course and redirected to a muggle inn in Surrey." She scratched her head.
He looked over at the brown robes emblazoned with the ministry's emblem (the letter M with a shining wand in the center) and the the word
. Of course, since most things in his life counted as hard on average and complicated at best, it meant that he had utterly poured every bit of himself into it in these past eight years (including training) which, he recognized, was the main reason why he was being promoted so early in the first place. Should he tell them that it was probably ruining his marriage? Or that, despite the fact that this move theoretically meant more paper-pushing behind a desk and less danger and time out in the field, that the idea of sitting still terrified him more than facing dark magic?
to have sex?"
"Stay low, cover me," Harry commanded from somewhere ahead of him.
"It's ok. We can just two step!" he said, tugging a little harder and finally getting Harry up on his feet.
"You ok?"
"I'm fine!" He glanced at Malfoy who seemed to be listening although he was still avidly avoiding looking in his direction. "I just went for a walk to clear my head last night and fell asleep by the lake. I'm fine," he reassured them.

"Yes!" She blushed.
Draco shook his head, still in his lap. Finally he looked up and the expression on Harry's face was carefully blank. "I haven't the slightest idea, Harry -- I swear! It's just... he was the only one I could talk to about you because he grew up so far away and he didn't know about all the

"Why don't you just come with me?"
Harry screwed up his face indignantly.

He kept his gaze on the dining room table and tapped his fingers rhythmically as the moment stretched on between them.
"Meanwhile, I've talked to the healers at St. Mungos and it's no strain of spattergroit or dragon pox they've ever seen," Savage chimed in.
They had only been in New York for a little over two months when the towers were struck. He had been in a financial advising meeting at MACUSA when the building shook all the way up to the 73rd floor where he was sat around a conference table. They had looked on, solemnly at what was, at first, believed to be an unfortunate tragic accident as muggle (or no-maj, as they say in the States) first responders rushed to the scene before their very eyes. It wasn't until the second crash happened too, too, too soon after the first that the conference room full of well-to-do business witches and wizards turned to each other with horror in their eyes -- some terrified, some galvanized, and some, like Drace, a fair mixture of both. And they began to disapparate. Some apparated away from the danger and some apparated towards it.
Harry turned to Draco with trepidation. Draco kept a straight face and nodded that Harry should follow his friend.
"Well if it makes you feel any better, I didn't figure it out until

secretary! Draco, think about it: she's the one who would've been in charge of the seating arrangements at the inauguration, she's the one who booked the table at the restaurant last minute without even asking, she's the one that told me to meet with Dung, and she's the one that got 'poisoned' by the Warbeck potion knowing I knew and had the antidote!" How could he be so blind not to see it before?!
Harry shook his head.
"Sebastian, please don't make me regret mixing business with pleasure," he warned with a pointed brow. "I just needed a distraction."
"So what are we going to do about
She pulled away and stalked out of the room without another word. Draco's brow furrowed and his eyes began to sting as he stared after her. A comforting hand found its way onto his his shoulder and he turned to find concerned green eyes searching his.
But then there were some smaller things that Harry noticed that made him wonder if the still bristly boy who was now his peer in Auror training might actually be remorseful and trying to find his own ways towards redemption.
time in three years, they weren't apt to cut him off completely, at the time. Instead, they seemed to be under the assumption that if they made him feel bad enough for being a bad son, then he'd eventually go back to being their pride and joy.
"For what?" he asked, voice horse and finally giving in and putting his hands cautiously on Draco's waist.
"I know," Harry nodded solemnly and made to get to his feet before helping Draco up as well. "This isn't over. But, luckily, we've got him right where we want him."
"I mean, you just said yourself that you hadn't seen him in nearly six years and you haven't been an Auror in just as many -- yet you come all the way here from the middle of Timbuktu, procure official ministry documents, and now you're planning to, what? Break Harry out of custody?"
to apparate directly because there's too much foot traffic."
Draco slid carefully through the door, biting back a curse as his foot caught and the shifty shop owner looked through him in confusion. He walked through rows of dubious potions ingredients with no sight or sound of Potter or his captors. Finally, he reached 2 doors near the back of the shop and paused when he heard the buzzing sound of a cast
Harry shook his head. It was an odd thing to make it out on the other side of a war, fairly unscathed, when so many others had met a fate much worse than one's own. Ron's humor had made him think that he'd somehow been impervious to all of the lingering feelings of survivor's guilt that plagued Harry daily. Now he could see that that had been foolish to think and maybe Ron could relate more than most people he knew. It felt good to know that someone else got it. "Yea, I'll probably spend the rest of my life trying to convince myself that it was all good enough, too. We'll go down in history as heroes but how do we ever convince ourselves that it was all worth it? That it wouldn't have been better to have just lain down and be put out of our misery?"
"What do you want?"
He sighed. The part of him that had prided himself on their rivalry was loath to admit it but: "I just don't want to feel numb when I think of him."
"Who is Sebastian?" asked Harry who was back at his side, frowning incredulously.
Harry shook his head and then gave up. "Oh, absolutely," he said, thickly, his voice cracking as the tears began to flow in earnest. "But only because I'm so, so happy."
"Are you... Is everything... Please tell me what you're thinking," he finally settled on, still eyeing his friend apprehensively.
When Draco witnesses Harry be raped by death eaters the summer before 6th year, all of his convictions are questioned as he steps in to save Harry's life.

"You're not sleeping." He nodded, stating rather than asking.
Fleur smiled up at her husband. "Ah, what would we be without Ronald? When Bill came to visit 'Arry for the Triwizard Tournament, Ronald was talking to Bill about 'is Dragon earring and 'is 'air. I 'appened to be walking by and admiring ze gorgeous red-'aired muscly man and Ronald stopped me to ask if
"You too?" Harry's voice was gentle. "My mum was a muggleborn, too, and I would've been so scared for her if she had been around through that. And you know my best friend, Hermione?" Walden nodded. "When we were on the run I was so worried for her. And I know it wasn't easy -- just trying to stay alive and being terrified every day..."
Harry's breathing started to calm the longer he held him. Draco laid back, pulling him on top of him and Harry snuggled up against his chest, sniffing away his tears. He ran soothing fingers through soft, messy, black hair and felt Harry lean into the touch.
The age that most young witches and wizards begin to display magical abilities...
Her jaw dropped indignantly. "
The large hall was plunged into darkness but the Hand of Glory shone brightly, illuminating the scene for he and Draco, alone.
"Stevens, where is he?" he asked, struggling to keep his voice calm.
he gasped when a surge of pure, unadulterated power sung through his veins the moment his fingers wrapped around the base!
As it were, long, manicured fingers felt cautiously around the rough bark until they finally came into contact with a knot in the base. He sighed with relief when the wild limbs actually shook and slowed to a halt.
"What are you afraid they'll see?" Harry asked gently.
and undid the the binds.
"Yea, yea," Draco said as Harry helped him sit up. "You're just lucky you were right because if I would've died right before my wedding, I would've been so bloody pissed off."
"Draco, I love you."

most peculiar thing: Jansen slid his hand down to Harry's and wrapped his pinky finger around his....
"Oh." He turned to look at Weasley but was taken aback to see the whole room, Snape included, watching them interact with mouths open in shock. He was fairly certain that they couldn't hear them speaking over in this corner so he looked to them with a raised eyebrow. "What?"
that might make this make sense!
"When was this?"
She shot him a stern look. "Harry! You know you can't barter with something that dangerous!"
"Good morning," Harry said in a hoarse voice.
Draco rolled his eyes and looked around for anything that looked even remotely like an "off" switch. He may have heard stories of the sordid thing from Harry, but it wasn't like he'd ever had reason to try it himself! If it wasn't so uncouth to bring a stark raving lunatic into a castle full of school children, he would've opted for the less deadly and certainly
"That was incredible, Draco!" He smiled brightly. "Is it always like that?"
"G'day, Malfoy. I think it's time we had that meeting on mergers and acquisitions. Sorry, Benson couldn't be here but I'm sure he sends his regards," Sebastian smirked but there was heat behind his glare. Draco noticed, for the first time, that he was gripping a wooden bat firmly in his right hand. Draco eyed it sceptically.
"Rotten cheats! The both of you!"
"Ah." He smiled, sadly, thinking how unjust it felt that two teenage boys, at opposite sides of a war, had been put in positions where they'd so graciously accepted death and thus been deemed worthy of being its master. He was left with only one question: "So, what happened to the wand?"
He was just contemplating his options when movement out of the corner of his eye made him do a double take. Draco, donning a pair of the big, bulky, sample headphones, had just spun around and dipped down and back up with some sort of bend and snap move.
Harry frowned in confusion. "What do you mean it's too late?"
"Yea, well, we do know how to get what we want," he said, the glint in his eye twinkling as he dropped his robes. Harry's eyes and mouth dropped with them, surprised to see that Draco was bare underneath them! All thoughts of Hermione went out the window as he took in the beauty that was a naked Draco Malfoy. His fantasies had been no match for reality and he was suddenly aware that this pale adonis was
"Altogether? 50,000 Galleon," he said in hushed tones.
"I don't want to, but you have to admit, the evidence is pretty overwhelming..." said a graceful, older witch.
Potter rolled his eyes. "Malfoy, you just completely pulverized you wand hand..."
"I know, Hermione."
I was feeling nostalgic with the new decade change and thinking early 2000s when I made the title (you know, before emojis 😱? When people put <3s on everything? No? Haha cool 😅). Anyways, I realize it's probably not the easiest title to search so I'm going to switch it from "Draco <3s Spice Girls and Harry Potter" to "Draco Hearts Spice Girls and Harry Potter" before I post chapter 5, I just want to give anyone who's already reading a heads up before I do.
"Which is precisely why I get it. Even if it
"So what's our strategy?"
"So where are we on finding out what in the bloody hell is going on in West Country?" he asked.
"Potter is an excellent Auror and a magnificent wizard. He can handle this," he reassured himself and then grimaced, grateful that no one was around to hear him admit that aloud.
"Other than their age and value, I see no connection -- " His eyes shiftily searched out Potter.
Stop doing that!" she spat.
"Yes," she said, thickly, tears streaming down her face.
"Hmm..." he hummed as he sat up to straddle Harry's hips and pulled his pajama shirt over his head. Harry licked his lips, eyes glued to Draco's bare skin as he sat up to slip off his own. "Maybe later," he said, rolling his hips and eliciting a delicious, raspy moan from Harry. He was just reaching for the tie on Harry's pajama bottoms when the sound of the floo coming to life downstairs made them both freeze.
"Ah, bollocks." Andromeda waved a hand dismissively. "Sounds like they still love ya, hun. They're just still holding out hope that you'll go back to conforming to whatever it is they want but, to hell with that!"
Harry sighed but nodded. "I just wanted this to be over, Draco. And all of this has been pointless--" he waved a hand absently at the truly chaotic mess of case files and notes. "I figured if I got the wand and drew him out..."
"Miss Alexandra said that it has been arranged. Master Draco's associate has agreed to meet in one hour and Riply wrote down the address!"
Draco felt himself floating, barely there in the days to come and teetering on an impossible decision.

They sat like that in silence for long moments as the little pile of glass accumulated on the bench as it was removed. When Potter finally spoke again, it was with a gentleness that matched his efforts.
So, we decided to be a couple of airheads." She shrugged as Luna smiled warmly and intertwined their fingers.
Right on cue the gold gates began to seal the fireplaces, one at a time, starting at the furthest end of the room. The Aurors raised their wands at once and waved them in the same circular motion.
Harry bit back a laugh and Draco smirked smugly as Victoire giggled with Dominique.
"Do we have to do this?"
The kids all gasped. He had everyone's attention, and Draco realized belatedly that he was holding his breath, too.
"Well, then you've already lost me. Because it's either you accept that I am my own person, that you have raised me to be able to take care of myself and do what's best for me outside of your control,
"No, I mean,

He and Ginny gave each other wry smiles and then shrugged. Penelope had insisted that now was not the time to let the public in on their breakup. He felt grateful that their friendship, at least, hadn't skipped a beat.
Harry bit his lip and tried to hold on, but, as his eyes fluttered shut and he gripped her hips tightly, his mind supplied him with an image all its own: White blonde hair and pale, pale skin illuminated in gold, purple, orange and crimson hues from so many sunsets ago, as if still scorched onto his lids. The thought sent him flying over the edge and he threw his head back and cried out as he came, hard.
"Husband?" he asked, hushed and awed and barely daring to believe. He'd been a husband, of course, but why did it feel so different and just altogether special to hear that word coming from the man kneeling before him?
"You never were very observant." Ron joked.
Harry, who looked a bit emotional himself, whispered something in her ear and he saw understanding flash in her eyes. She reached out to touch his arm one more time. "I'll see you inside in a moment. Harry tells me you like chocolate and I've got a chocolate cake going that's just about ready."
The mug slipped from his hand and shattered on the ground.
"Quite frankly, Blaise, I don't know if there's any way that I can say it that's going to make it make sense.
"CHEERS!"
The guards were gone.
Harry chuckled. "Go ahead, say it." Malfoy fought back a smile and shook his head which just made Harry laugh harder. He was finding an unexpected sense of joy in being able to put cracks in the Malfoy mask. "You look like you're having a fit, you might as well go ahead and say it! You know you want to!" he teased, smiling mischievously.
Harry was taken aback. "What would I like? Draco, what are my options?"
I'm sorry! I just didn't expect..."
Harry shook his head and was silent for a long moment. "Maybe 15%?"
"How's the first official day as Head Auror going?" she asked as she made room on the desk and laid out pad thai, fried rice, eggrolls, and whatever proposition she was working on today.
"Not these two prats!"
He exhaled a sigh of relief when nothing happened and quickly crossed the threshold of the wards that still hummed contentedly when he crossed them.
Draco frowned. He got that his friend was trying to help, but he didn't know Harry! He couldn't begin to comprehend how much the man had sacrificed, how much he was still willing to give... How much the world had taken from him... How much more he deserved! And the thought of Harry Potter, the man that, damnit, he still
Draco blinked back at him, nonplussed. He couldn't argue with that. He'd spent nearly the whole year after taking the mark and being assigned the task to kill Dumbledore mulling through stages of denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and then, finally, acceptance. By the time he'd actually took to that astronomy tower, he had finally accepted that it was most likely to end in his death; if not at the hands of the old man, then surely at the hands of Voldemort at another point or maybe by the Order... One thing was for certain: he was screwed. And, in that moment, standing before Albus Dumbledore, he had resigned himself to that fate as he prepared to give it a go, regardless.
?" Draco asked, face screwed up in confusion.
"Is that so?" His eyes were lit with amusement despite the fact that he was sure the innuendo probably went over Potter's pure little head.
"I find that it's easiest for me to be mindful and present when I'm either flying on a broomstick or floating in water," Draco called from the bath, bringing Harry back to the room. "Do you want to be mindful in the water with me? We really can just float and meditate if you want. You can even keep on your pants if it makes you more comfortable."
Harry had been in rare form this week, pouring himself into his work and making an unprecedented 12 arrests during what was only his second week of field assignments.
She was a polished witch in her late 30s with a reputation for being
Harry hadn't given much thought to how much muggle technology he'd accumulated until he realized just how many things caught Draco's eye: landline, answering machine, lamps, clocks, tv, dvd player, CD player, and his newest addition: the red and white, egg-shaped Macintosh computer.
ever again. Of course he wasn't worried about getting attached.
Harry slammed his fist on the table making several of his team jump. He ran his fingers through his hair in frustration and paced in place. He could not fail at this. Not right now when he so badly needed a win.
Ron finally let go of Malfoy and reached for his wand, having decided that Malfoy had, indeed, lost his bloody mind and, thus, given up on trying to reason with a crazy person.
"Shite! What time is it?" He asked, casting a quick tempus and scrambling to stand -- a move he would soon regret as he was forced to haul it to the nearest bathroom and
"Go back to bed, Draco. Everything's fine."
"Thanks, Anavi -- send her in, please," he said, distractedly scratching his nose with his quill.
"Attention! Attention, everyone! I'd like to make a toast to the grooms!" He called. Harry laughed harder when he saw Hermione close her eyes and put her head in her hand in exasperation at her husband. "Don't worry," he said, pushing up the bosom area of the dress. Draco was smiling as he pulled Harry to his side and glasses of wine were floated over to them. "I'll make this short and sweet because the shorter I make it, the sooner I can get out of Auntie Muriel's dress!"
They scrambled to pull apart only to find the ancient house elf struggling with a man who looked more basset hound than man. Draco absently wondered if he may actually have fleas.
-- and, somehow, he highly doubted anyone here would give the word of Draco Malfoy, former Death Eater, much weight. Even now, as he walked through the bustling atrium, he still received sneers from the people who still remembered, lest he forget.
Narcissa sniffed back tears of her own as she rested her forehead on his shoulder and chortled. "But did the bloke
"No, sir. He's still in New Zealand for the rest of the week. Is there a problem?"
Draco perked up, too.
"What are you playing at Potter?" Draco spat.

Draco rolled his eyes. They were standing concealed in the woods on the outskirts of the Parkinson residence. The sun was just starting to set which meant they didn't have much time.

to hurt others, he didn't always have an outlet for that rage and he learned to turn it inwards until he finally imploded after the war. But, Healer Bubblykicks had helped him to find healthy outlets for that rage and the feelings underneath them.
Harry had been worried most about Ron's reaction. He turned to Draco to find gray eyes searching his own. He realized in that moment that this was another situation that he hadn't thought through. He'd asked Draco to join him as a support but they hadn't defined anything and his eyes widened as it dawned on him that Draco technically wasn't even out of the closet!
to give you away?"
"Thank you for a lovely night, Sebastian. How about we connect in two weeks for our meeting with Benson? We've got mergers and acquisitions to discuss," he said, curtly.
Harry's eyes narrowed and his fist tightened around his wand. He thought about Lucius and the ministry and Bellatrix and Narcissa taunting him about Sirius in Madam Malkin's. His magic pulsed through him, seething red hot and barely controllable. "Look, you miserable death eater spawn! I truly hope your dear father enjoys his slow decline into insanity in Azkaban until the rest of your putrid family joins him," he nearly growled.
" he exclaimed as he ran after him, wand held tightly.
Draco raised an eyebrow in challenge, determined not to be intimidated despite the pounding of his heart. He let his mind whir like the little handheld CD player whenever he put it in rewind, skimming through years of useless auror training; jumping past his brief stay in Azkaban; glazing over the war and the Manor full of Death Eaters and the torture at the hands of the Dark Lord; skipping right past the year of hell and the agony of taking the Dark Mark until, finally, he landed on the horrid memory that had gotten him through it all:
"Yes, but... when we get there, should I maybe... survey the scene first since they don't know that I'm involved? I could actually meet with him and talk business to make sure no one else is there or to distract him."
"Oh great! Somebody must've seen us when you
"Ha! Kept us all safe my arse!"
"No, I absolutely don't want to, but I
They looked at each other with wide eyes.
A moment passed before the bemused blonde opened the door.
"Built in pillows," she said as she pulled his head onto her bossom and took the clicker to turn to
"Please, Kreacher? It would be a great help and would make Draco, here, very happy."
"Is that... Is that the Bulgarian Minister for Magic?" Hermione asked through narrowed eyes.
Draco nodded. "That sounds excellent!"

from what now felt like a dream.
He was surprised when Potter stopped him and put a hand on his shoulder and squeezed. "It'll be alright, Malfoy. Trust me, Ollivander only ever wants to talk wands."
Draco smirked, "Is that what you told the secretary?"
important before he had?
!" George waved a hand in a mockingly flippant way. "Ginny nearly dying just means she gets to be doted on by mom and dad for life now, only solidifying her spot as the favourite."
"Get on with it, Malfoy."
He sighed. "Potter, that's very kind of you but I can't." He lifted his bandaged hand.

"It doesn't even matter. Let's just wrap this up."
It took him a moment to notice Hermione beaming up at him or Ron and Zabini staring between him and Draco with eyebrows raised in confusion (and maybe a little bit of disgust for Ron, who really should have been paying attention to his potion as it was now shaking dangerously).
Draco groaned inwardly as they stepped onto the cobbled path of Knockturn Alley. He would've been grateful to never again step foot in that sordid place but he was loathe to agree with Potter that Borgin and Burke's was the obvious first stop on the trail of the elusive magical-heirloom thief.
Potter groaned but Draco just pulled him closer, wrapped his arms around his neck, and began a slow two-step despite the fact that "Baby One More Time" by Britney Spears was hardly the right song for a slow two-step. But it didn't matter. He just wanted Harry close to him.
Only Draco really knew how utterly at odds his calm demeanor was to the inner consternation presently reaching a fever pitch. He might have laughed at the ridiculousness of it all but he was pretty sure it would only come out as hysterics which, obviously, was bad for business.
Harry laughed in earnest and then kissed Draco passionately in response. "Definitely bent," he concluded.
Draco made haste to leave the potions room as soon as they were dismissed. He had a free period now and he was hoping to avoid the questions that were sure to come from his fellow Slytherins. But alas, he'd have no such luck.
"Shut it, Malfoy. Look..." He thought about it for a moment. "I'll tell you how I knew you were here if you let me in."
? How could you
"Are you ok, dear?" she asked, concerned.
"Good luck, mate!" He heard as he closed the portrait and headed to meet Draco on the 5th floor with nervous anticipation. He reached the statue of Boris the Bewildered and counted 4 doors to the left.
"It's looking like a wonderful night for tips!" she said with a wink as she marched off, cheerfully, to greet the strange, new patrons.
"Potter, you can't just
"I don't know, but I recall you saying something about
Draco got up and grabbed something from his pile of clothes. Harry realized that it was his wand when he heard him whisper two incantations and felt a tingling sensation.
"No, thank you, Benjamin. You've been great." Ginny smiled politely and he bowed his head before hastily walking away.

reached her ears from somewhere in the kitchen.
"What is it?" Potter perked up.
some clue. He gasped when he checked the sink for the third time and found Draco's wand, tucked away, discretely -- placed carefully out of sight in the little crevice between the wall and the knobs.
"Well? What did it say, then?"
... I didn't know how it would help." He felt numb and was unaware of the tears that were rolling down his face. Draco squeezed him closer.
Harry shrugged. "Whatever you're comfortable sharing. Just not... you know."
"Welcome to the family, dear." Mrs. Weasley interrupted his spiraling thoughts by pulling him into a proper hug.

"You should have another drink."
"It's ok, it's just dancing," he said, staring lost into beautiful, trepid eyes. They were both growing harder and harder through their denim. He put one arm back on Harry's shoulder and reached up with his newly healed hand to cup his face. Harry closed his eyes and leaned into the touch. He took a deep breath as if praying for the will-power.
" Well that was unexpected.

Borgin looked mortified and then turned wide, pleading eyes to him as the large antiques disappeared into the tiny pouch, one at a time. "Mr. Potter, no! Please don't! These have cost me a fortune! Surely we could make a deal! How about this: you each can have any one thing that you like? I wouldn't tell a soul!" He smiled toothily.

"Oh, yes! Kreacher will do anything for a descendant of the House of Black! Kreacher will find the grubby man! Yes!"
It used to be that you could avoid all the fanfare and simply shoot out a quick owl to the Department of Magical Transportation and get authorization for a portkey to the destination of your choosing. The problem was that there was nothing preventing a whole flock of people sharing a portkey when only one had registered for the thing. It wasn't much of an issue for a family going from Wales to Scotland but, after 911, most governing wizarding bodies started to enforce stricter measures around international travel. The Ministry of Magic created a customs department out of Heathrow specifically for witches and wizards traveling outside of the UK. It operated similarly to Platform 9¾, the arrivals and departure terminal out of sight from muggles, of course, but it wasn't uncommon for the muggles in Terminal 5 to wonder at the eccentrically dressed men and women who sometimes traveled with strange pets.

He said he would stay. He'd only asked that he get to pick a new home because:
"Yes, a bloke can but
Draco wanted to bang his head on the table. He looked around the room: Granger sat in the front row, the perfect student, nodding along with rapt attention but nearly everyone else looked slightly bored if not feigning politeness. Weasley was already nodding off, Thomas and Finnigan couldn't seem to keep their hands to themselves under the table when they thought no one was looking (how those two weren't out yet was beyond him), and even the Patil twins, who had spent the first week chattering nonstop about how handsome the young instructor was, seemed to have lost interest.
He walked over and leaned casually against the booth.
"That's just it! We have absolutely nothing more than theories and speculations but not an ounce of proof! Yet, somehow, this case has been pushed through to the Wizengamot at a speed faster than I've ever seen! We all know Harry -- and Robards probably knows him even better than any of us! So why, then, isn't he fighting to make sure we cover every possible angle on this?" Stevens pressed.
"Wait, why--"
" look and it left Harry baffled.
Draco pulled back to search emerald eyes. "Of course I am. Harry, why wouldn't I be?"
"The girls confirmed that Ginny wasn't at practice on Monday morning. None of them saw her arrive but they did say that they noticed a strange man in the stands."

Bill's mouth dropped in shock as he looked back at Harry and Draco as Draco was now trying to pry the cufflinks out of Harry's hands to take back his gift. "And it's been a whole week and they're not actually married yet?!"
"Wait... Harry, what are you agreeing to?"
Draco lifted his head, shocked. He shook it slowly.
Ron exchanged a glance with Neville and Hermione reached them seconds later.
