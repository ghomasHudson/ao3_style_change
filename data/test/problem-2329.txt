Hips rocking up, Harry thrust into the hole Draco had formed with his hand with a feverish moan. Draco’s cock pressed up against his inside that hole only drove him wilder.
Harry was the reason Fred was dead, after all. He was the reason Arthur got hurt, and Sirius died, and Remus died, and Tonks died leaving her baby an orphan—Harry caught himself spiraling. At least Teddy was with his Auntie Andromeda now that he’d given her Grimmauld Place. Harry couldn’t stand to be there without his godfathers.
“Where,” Draco began, taking inventory of the granite counters covered with cooking utensils. “Is our pasta strainer?”
Considering that every other message Draco had entered had failed miserably, he tried a sincere one.
“If we ever go down that road, it’ll be after our research.” Draco paused to shake his head at how keen Harry was on this actually being the mayonnaise pop star.
“And you’re going to be even prettier when I’m done painting you like a canvas,” Draco concluded, bringing his hand down to smack the other thigh.
“Long hours at St. Mungo’s allow my mind to wander, and I wandered over to you. I will admit my shock and horror at first but I couldn’t be happier that ‘H’ is you, and that you’re you, Harry,” Draco admitted with some pain. Sincerity was a risky move in a world like this.
Whatever shocked or offended looks the Malfoy-Potters downstairs had, none quite matched the way Grace’s face had twisted in horror.
Remus smiled. Alex was a good kid, and Italian food was a proper reward for that. “We’ll have to go there sometime.”
Harry made a face. “Being with Draco,” he admitted. “Maybe I could just become a prostitute and have him pay me by the hour.”
“Come on, you two!” Harry responded and threw his hands up. “It’s not school anymore! People can change, and he has changed. Haven’t we all changed? Look, when I rejected his friendship that first day at the robes shop it was because he reminded me of Dudley. Now Draco’s my—“ Harry stopped himself. “My boyfriend, and he reminds me of the kind of bloke I always used to dream about being with.”
All Draco was currently consumed by was a need to rescue an adolescent after his loudmouth father had revealed a rather nasty family secret. Draco was ready to chew him out for that later just as much as Harry was.
Still, the glare held some power. Grace was caught in the middle of it, too. She hadn’t even known they’d picked out a name.
“What?” Colin asked quickly, bolting upwards so the one rose he’d placed in his own hair fell to the grass.
Draco used that time to faithfully secure Harry to the bed on his back, legs spread wide open. His mouth was full of a ball-gag and his arms were fastened above his head. The rest of the ropes were really for show, but it made Harry looks like he was trapped in a spider web with no escape.
“In passing, sure, but I don’t want to know what my sister is like in bed from my brother, you know?” Harry tried desperately to avoid the subject even now.
At his wedding, there would be strands of paper lanterns. The reception would be outdoors, so that everything white could contrast off of the dark night sky. They’d count the stars together; Theo just knew it.
Harry put a hand on Draco’s waist and creeped forward to inspect their surroundings over his shoulder.
Something sharp felt like it had dug itself into Draco’s heart when he looked at Harry. Head pounding, pulse racing, Merlin those trousers fit his arse well—“I love you,” Draco blurted out. “I love you so much, Harry.”
Draco stepped closer to him. “I knew you couldn’t handle the truth. You fuck me up just as much as I fuck you up, Potter. Your hands aren’t clean in this.”
“And how does that feel?” Draco inquired almost scientifically, slapping the other cheek with the leather tongue hard enough to leave a mark.
That took some serious effort on their part to make sure James wasn’t in love with her braids, her hands, her style, or her body, but he loved Lily Evans for Lily Evans. He was the first. Her first.
A rushed call to Alex’s foster parents would have to do as Remus and Sirius’ excuse for dashing out without their Olivia.
And just like that, Blaise did a wildly sappy thing he would never admit to after he did it. He wrapped his arms around his girl and squeezed her tight.
“I can’t believe you’re offended by compliments. Anyway, tell me why it ended with Harvey,” he requested.
“Is that the one with the silly color-coded outfits?” Draco asked idly as he tried to envision where he would put the couches he had planned for this room.
Harry’s heart was beating like a deer running from a hunter. Draco had to speak to him. He had to know what was going on in Draco’s head before the anticipation killed him.
Ruth didn’t get her wish. It took another fifteen minutes of fidgeting at the table for a man in the crowd of New Yorkers relaxing in the park to reveal himself.
“Isn’t he?” Molly cooed, clearly restraining herself from grabbing the little baby up and kissing him all over once again. “Oh, gosh. Look at him and his sister.” Tears sprung to her eyes and Arthur took her in for another hug so she could happy-cry on his shoulder.
Mrs. Bowen used her ebony wand to lock all of the windows and doors in the house simultaneously just to be sure. She would deal with her corralled kin when she came back from a little chat with an old friend.
“Good. Started a project, which felt nice. You need a greenhouse for the gardens to start again, and I’m building one.”
“Already planning our next round?” Draco asked airily, breathing thinner with Harry’s intrusion pressing deep, searching within him. “Bit premature.”
Was Malfoy, Draco Malfoy hitting on him? Harry could never process when people were flirting with him, so he did his best to play it safe. “How can I prove it, then?”
Usually, flattery got people everywhere with Draco. “We haven’t made a decision yet, and you have to realize that this counts against you.”
Still, it didn’t keep her from smiling when she heard Draco say, “Honey, hell is a fake place that religious people made up to explain the void that is death and make them feel like justice was enacted on those they judged to be sinful, like us.”
“Yeah,” he answered quickly. Well, they hadn’t really talked about it… “Harry’s doing a lot better than he was before the wedding. He’s calmer, and we're both better equipped to handle our panic attacks.” It hadn’t occurred to Draco that Harry being assigned to a war case could backpedal on their progress.
Anyway ack I know this chapter is short but I’m really losing steam on this fic. I think the next chapter is going to be a time skip to the birth (!!!!) and then a final time skip to a scene with Lily and her two brothers that Drarry is so totally having.
Harry’s face reddened and he lowered his voice to a growl. Who did Draco think he was? “This was not for you. I have had that account since I was a kid.”
“Alright, Jonathan, call in Fletchley and Bones. These two are wasting our time,” Kingsley waved dismissively.
With a playful swat, Harry went to open their door and let their friends in to help them unpack and fill their pantry with food. Lucius had mumbled something about wanting to see how ‘structurally sound’ the house was, too.
The first thing Harry saw was a pair of black and white dress shoes that made him smile. Shoes had never really made him smile before, but knowing it was Draco Malfoy wearing such trendy spats tickled him in an unexpected way. Things only got better as he looked up. Draco was a dream in green, harkening back to the house color of his youth to make him look all the more powerful and imposing.
As they began working out the details, Draco and Harry both knew that there was still something Emmett was hiding.
With a laugh, Draco shook his head. “You’re a complete madman, but mission accomplished I suppose.” He squeezed Harry’s hand in his under the street lamp. Nobody seemed to be on that quiet corner of the city that night but the two of them in their circle of light.
“Yes Daddy,” Harry responded as fast as he could get the reassurance out. His thighs were trembling under the machinations of Draco’s tongue pressed flat up his taint to his needy, long-neglected hole. Harry had almost forgotten how incredible this felt, having a man open him up, and never before had that man been Draco Malfoy so this instance was even hotter.
Ron, flabbergasted in every sense of the word, let out a breath. “Harry, you just told me you’ve considered suicide, how am I supposed to leave you here? I’m—I’m supposed to be your best friend! You’re supposed to tell me things! I—I can’t believe…”
“A little help?” Arthur called from the front door, arms full of trays of food and a trail of levitating dishes behind him. Eager to escape what was about to become the birds and the bees talk with Fred Junior and a distressed Angelina, Harry rushed to help him.
Harry’s sense of humor was clearly a traitor to The Cause. The Cause was of course maintaining the childish hatred of all things Draco Malfoy.
Theodore Nott would understand perfectly when Draco told him—if Draco was allowed to tell him—that Harry bloody Potter had been occupying most of his free thoughts and now time.
He sat with crossed legs on his bed, settling into the rumpled sheets with all the messages of the blokes who liked him just based on a measly paragraph description. It made something rare blossom inside Harry’s chest—hope. That was dangerous.
Oh, there it was. That beautiful sigh of submission, the way Harry pushed up against Draco, so vulnerable and open…
“I occasionally visit the professors when time allows, and still make use of their library. I have to admit I’m interested in what is in the Malfoy library beyond the new additions as well,” said Hermione.
“Fifth year, with a boy in the year above us, Klaus Weber. He’s some big name banker now, got a wife and kids, and we haven’t spoken since he graduated and the war started up,” Draco shrugged. “We were both experimenting, not looking for anything lasting, and that worked just fine for me.”
Harry looked up with raw, red eyes to see Draco’s were the same. Harry reached up with the hand that wasn’t pressed to Draco’s precious heart, catching a tear on his thumb. “I can feel it,” Harry murmured, voice unsteady as his shuddery breathing began to subside.
Luckily for Draco, Harry hadn’t noticed any of his contemplative facial expressions. Harry had entered the number that they were given for Emmett into a public database and gotten nothing. “Damn.”
It would also be a lie to say that Hermione wasn’t smirking to herself about the fact that Draco was at Harry’s mercy from being sick, forced to rely on someone he’d taken so much pleasure in torturing back in school. While Harry was relatively forgiving, Hermione held grudges.
Still, he repeated the introduction until Kingsley was satisfied with the number of copies. Harry couldn’t wait until he got to the part where he wouldn’t have to read rehearsed lines.
Frilly lavender lace covered the front of a set of bra and panties with garters attached, and thigh-high sheer socks at the ends. Harry’s eyes went further down to the floor where there were—he gulped. A pair of shiny white pumps with crystal hearts on the tops of the toes sat on top of a note.
Lucius and his cane made their way from where he had rested against the wall. When he found the strange muggle switch Harry was talking about, he flipped it down.
It wasn’t the magic itself that made World of Warcraft so great. Sure, it was fun and had one hell of a plotline, but that wasn’t all there was to it. Harry could run the Black Temple raid all on his own. He was level 90 and he didn’t need to have Draco there to take down Illidan, but he wanted to have him there.
“Then no more pushing off,” declared Harry, drawing out his wand. “The next time you see them you can tell them about all the progress we made. Or, well, you made. No pressure to tell them you had help.”
“I get every name in the fucking book, too. I know you’ve had to deal with that about being a muggleborn, so please, try to understand,” he begged. “I’m a faggot and they want me dead. Even wizards who know that I killed Tom Riddle tell me I’m ‘setting a bad example’, or whatever! They fight against my marriage, my very right to adopt, and more!”
“If I recall correctly you were the one begging for it, ‘pleeeease, Daddy, pleeeeeeease’,” Draco imitated.
“That works perfectly,” Draco said, feeling oddly proud that he’d gotten that out of Harry. “And when do my two hours start?”
“The Dark Lord demanded I kill for him to prove my loyalty. Your mother was ill, Theodore. She couldn’t serve me as a wife any longer.”
Swallowing hard, Harry tried his best not to turn entirely red now that his shoulders were out in the open. Even they tended to turn pink when he got embarrassed. “Thanks.”
“It is Mr. Potter’s first time, yes,” Draco spoke for him. Was this too much? Was this too weird and theatrical for Harry? Should he have chosen somewhere else?
“Please,” Draco responded brightly as he set up his quill to take notes. “Only use it when you feel moved to—I mean that.” Draco paused once everything was all set up and ready. “It sounded lovely,” Draco told Harry, voice low. “The way you said it.”
“That old coot? I hate that you have to take orders from him. You’re a better Healer than him, and he knows it,” Pansy scoffed.
“The head chef’s name is Aerin. He wears a chef’s hat and a monocle, takes his job quite seriously,” Harry informed Draco. “That was Roisin, who you were just talking to. She’s shy, but writes incredible poetry.”
Not a single question was answered after that. He fucking stonewalled Harry Malfoy-Potter. It felt like a stupid kind of irony.
Draco, now having perfect access to what belonged to him, grabbed a handful of arsecheek with each hand. “Gorgeous.”
Harry spied the glass panes when the light from the simulated sun reflected off of them. In crates and on top of lumber bundles sat a blueprint of a wood and glass greenhouse.
Grace gave her a shove against the bathroom counter. “Fuck you! It’s a real medical condition, and I can’t fuck it up any worse with potion hormone treatment or I’ll be bleeding twenty-four seven!”
“I would hope you know how to use a shrinking charm,” he sighed, walking over to the box that would later be carted upstairs to their bedroom so that they could cover the new mattress. And there it was, the pasta strainer amongst the Egyptian cotton. “Why did I marry you, again?”
Whispers abound. “You enjoy causing a scandal, don’t you, Professor?” Draco teased when he saw a satisfied grin overtake Harry’s face.
Briefly Draco looked to Headmistress McGonagall and found her sitting like a proper lady of the castle as she ate her morning meal. It was served by a union of house elves who decided to remain after being set free. They were paid now, and paid well. It was not uncommon amongst them to have many outfits now, showing off their style as a crowning achievement. Some literally wore crowns.
Draco had picked up on Harry’s plan the second he got louder. “Hey!” Draco added. “Are you discriminating, Mr. Snape? That’s against school policy.” Just because Snape was his godfather didn’t mean Draco would spare him the third degree if he tried to pry into Draco’s personal life like his actual father did.
This man’s voice in his writing seemed honest. Or maybe Harry was just hoping he was, projecting his desires onto the nearest blank slate of a man he could find. He was pale and blonde apparently, so it might be very easy to do that. ‘Repulsed’ didn’t sound right at all, either, why would he say that? The scars couldn’t be that bad. Harry did have one of his own to show off, proof of his identity. Fuck, this was scary.
In the spirit of a warm Hogwarts welcome, she gave the new professor who was hanging around outside of the main entrance a smile. “Hullo.”
“Well, are we not all scholars?” Potter asked with a grin. “Had to be to get here. Give me your official answer, Professor.”
Draco pressed the tip of his cock to Harry’s hole and parted his fingers wide enough for him to push in. Easing himself deeper with each passing moment Draco let out a groan of his own, raw and true.
“It’s just a not-nice way of saying ‘stuff’,” Harry rushed the explanation before patting her back. “Papa’s sorry he said it.”
Draco really shouldn’t have been trusted with that sort of power. Harry felt for the people who had to edit this damn show.
Harry sat down and tried his best not to reach for the side of his head. He wanted to tug on just a few strands of hair, just one or two thick ones… He shivered. Draco had told him to wear a tank top and pants so he’d done just that, and was feeling properly exposed for it. Thankfully Draco seemed to be keeping his eyeing of him quite tame and medical for the time being.
Another ecstatic gasp escaped Harry’s lips when Draco’s pressure turned red-hot, swirling tight circles around the head of Harry’s cock. “
Draco laughed. “Yes, well. I can still sing songs and tell you stories and bring the covers up when you want,” he half-joked about all of those things.
Draco gave himself reasonable portions and occupied himself with eating them. He had to admit though, this gravy was delicious. As a house elf passed by to collect some empty plates Draco leaned down to her level and offered a terse smile. “My compliments to the chef.”
He shrugged. “Maybe I do and you’ve just gotten used to it. Hey, you know what we should do? We should go back to the Quidditch pitch and find where I—“ Then he remembered. The pitch had been burned down. “Um. We should go where I made that carving of our names and carve it in the new pitch.”
“Shall we go check it out?” Draco asked Harry who nodded in return. Ginny and they walked through the rooms back to where Pansy was calling for them.
“Am I now? Well, then I want the prince to meet a handsome stableboy so they can have that happy ending that princes usually get.”
“And you helped with that, and I want to thank you. You were, ah… You always were there when I needed you,” Emmett rambled. “But before you I was really, really closeted. I dated women all the time until something happened.”
They’d been to too many ‘abandoned’ houses to trust one to be entirely empty. For all they knew Marcus could have been a fan of keeping swarms of locusts or hordes of mutated rats. Harry wondered if Theo would have given them any information on that, but knew he couldn’t ask.
Draco didn’t care, he had his pretzel. “It’s sort of how instead of being up-to-date on trends like gay men are expected to be, you dress like a washed-up father of three.”
Maybe it was the exhaustion, maybe it was the emotional stress about someone else’s online relationship, maybe it was general unfurling of Harry’s senses, but he laughed without any real malice towards Draco. It was strange, they had been arguing just hours ago and there Harry was, laughing with him.
“Pretty much,” Harry nodded. He’d taken a seat on the bench outside of the interrogation room and Draco had taken to rubbing his back soothingly.
“I was walking home and I saw a poster hanging up for the London Zoo’s new tiger habitat or whatever. That’s what really got me thinking, and then everything fell into place.” He paused to put another spoonful of vanilla delight into his mouth. “The crib will be a light wood, with green leaf detailing along the sides, and a mobile of different animals.”
“Come on, trust me here,” Harry requested with a strange sense of urgency. “If we’re going to prove anything then we need some documentation. Like an autopsy on your old relationships.” ‘Autopsy’ was a harsh word, but Harry couldn’t turn his Auror brain off sometimes. “Then I can show you for sure it’s not you.”
A couple of hours later in their five-star wizarding hotel, a certain Auror was feeling far from delighted. “This is the fifth woman who’s late,” Harry sighed, looking down at the file for Nina Adams whose ten-minute appointment was halfway done without any sign of her.
What had to be the funniest part of this job was that any half-wit with internet access could do it. All Draco and Harry needed to do was put the phone number into any search engine and if the number had a publically registered name or location attached to it, then that name or location could be easily looked up.
The pair had apparated there without issue and once they were covered up by the privacy of the masks things began to feel very real.
“I won’t,” Harry swore and pushed his legs as wide apart as they could go. The slight constraint on his chest from the fabric of his bra was a constant reminder that he’d been the one to bring up being fucked in lingerie as a secret wish.
“So what vile and purist crap did you spew at him?” Harry didn’t even need to ask if it was about purebloods versus muggleborns. He’d been in school with Draco at the height of his bigotry and had seen the man say some frankly disgusting things.
Draco recalled one particularly instance where the other man had called him ‘gorgeous’ like it was his name.
Harry whimpered and writhed against the bed. He could feel himself twitching back to life almost painfully. “Sensitive,” Harry got out between whines. “I can’t believe I’m getting hard again so fast…”
“You want a child that has no blood relation to you with the knowledge that it will be harder for you as a same-sex couple to adopt?”
It was their mother-son project, and Lucius was simply content to watch his family be happy about something.
She ducked into her room, ignoring the suspicious stare from her mother. Sheesh, one accidental pregnancy and the woman didn’t even trust her anymore. “Yes, it is. Who’s asking?”
“Oh, that’s—well, I was far off, okay,” Harry said, still not recovered from his embarrassment but at least able to smile about it now. He could hardly stop smiling with how close he and Draco were, how dressed up they were—together. Their outfits hardly matched but they were easily spotted as a pair. People who walked by them gave them a wide berth, and Harry was trying not to dissect what their stares meant. “No allergies. I’ll eat just about anything, too.”
“Well, well, well,” Mr. Lark dragged on with the same wide eyes as before. He looked as if he’d suddenly figured Draco out or heard some secret about him. “You celebrity types are just going to have to live like us common folk for a day. No special treatment when your fancy talent agents order incorrectly.”
Draco was a mix of at the very least twelve conflicting desires, and Harry seemed to be composed of the same confusion. “What are we doing?” Harry demanded and quickly followed it up. “Don’t answer that. I can’t stand talking in circles like this. Look—regardless of whatever Kingsley’s done here—do you want to be with me?” He threw all his cards down on the gamble.
“Oh, I’m sorry, I couldn’t hear that,” Draco lied, working his finger in and out so he could always end up against that same bundle of nerves. “You’ll have to speak up, dearie. Daddy wants to know every thought in that pretty head of yours.”
“I have friends on a few of them,” Harry shrugged, taking a tome from the shelf next to the bed. “Oliver Wood did a stint in the Cannons, and Ginny’s on the Hollyhead Harpies.”
Emmett shook hands with the both of them quickly while Alvaro looked to him imploringly. “Well?” he asked Emmett.
It was still exciting to use spells, and now he had a reason to use them. Watching heavy wood lift with his wand effortlessly reminded Harry of his first Wingardium Leviosa lesson, filling him with warmth. He could do this.
“Yup. George has already convinced himself that he’ll be the uncle who buys my kids firewhiskey when I’m not looking.” George had aspirations of being a Sirius kind of godfather.
Draco’s handheld positioning to get the shot blocked Draco’s face and broke the spell on Harry. Realizing he’d been mute this entire time, Harry shook off his daze and jumped back into the conversation.
Harry, feeling rather disoriented by the run-in, sat back down on the black leather couch Draco had insisted he’d put in his workplace for quickie shagging reasons. “Strange kid,” Harry decided, sweeping away the incident for the sake of focus. “Now, Remus.”
“Lullaby, and goodnight, in the skies stars are bright,” Draco sang, voice low and private for only Harry to hear. “May the moon’s silvery beams, bring you sweet dreams…”
Draco pressed a kiss to Harry’s temple for it was right in front of him with the way they were standing so close to each other. “Okay,” he agreed, voice soft.
“Before you know it you’ll be listening to muggle music and living in a commune.” At least Sirius hoped that was true. It would drive Lucius up the wall. “Anyway, that’s pasta. Experience will make you better at it. Ready for your next lesson?”
“Hey!” Maybe Harry, Remus, and Sirius were speaking some sort of secret gay body language, but Ron hadn’t a clue what was going on. “What was that for?”
Draco continued his rocking motion, taking more and more of Harry’s finger in him while Harry’s tongue still lapped against his filled hole.
“Yes, okay, but can we get back to the part where Draco’s shagging Potter?” Theo requested. “Like, very often, apparently?”
Once again, Lorraine had someone giving her suggestions she’d already talked over with Macklemore—or, whoever was pretending to be him. “He wants to be perceived as a serious artist by the mainstream media,” she explained in exactly the way that Macklemore had told her. “On the phone he always is talking about how people think he’s too silly, so saying my name would only—“
The blonde was putting his back and thighs into it, whole body rolling forward when he sunk deep to grind the tip inside Harry. “Fuck,” Draco groaned, treasuring the sounds falling from Harry’s mouth in time with the slap of their skin together.
Finally, it’s time for what I like best: Not safe for work fabulosity. It’s time to get weird and internet kinky with these two boys since they still have no idea who the other one is and all I want Harry to be thinking when he meets Draco in person is “oh my effing god I cybered him I totally cybered Draco Malfoy”. Also oh my gosh I am applying to college and it’s very exciting!
The Horde and Alliance have been at war (hence the name of the game) with both each other and the evil in their realm. Other than that, the world is a free-for-all where each hero picks their own path.
Draco gave him a small, tense smile. “No, but I know healthcare. I know legal issues. I know adoption. I also know you mean well, father, so please don’t take this as an insult.” That was like telling Lucius not to breathe, utterly useless. “Trust my judgment.”
It was only then that Draco realized he didn’t even know the patient’s name. Rather than asking her while she was distracted with all of the shiny objects, he wheeled her back into the main lobby where the other adults resided.
Harry swallowed. “Wasn’t really thinking of it like that, but I can see the appeal,” he spoke up. It definitely wasn’t anger he was feeling looking at Draco’s neck now, but the heat was as intense. Harry set down his menu. Draco had done quite well on foot with two hours. The fact that he knew about silly muggle places like this and frequented them now made Harry smile. What he’d seen of Draco Malfoy before this day was but a chrysalis, and now he was witnessing the flourishing of the butterfly.
“Oh,” said Draco, his heart swelling to feel almost suspiciously full. “That was very kind of them to say. I suppose we do also owe them for being the first to break the news to us.” He looked over to Harry and saw a tear roll down his tan cheek. “Harry?”
How Draco could have grown up in this kind of opulence was still foreign to Harry. No wonder he had turned out to be such a spoilt little thing in school.
“Shut up,” Harry laughed. “Just because you’re Head Auror doesn’t mean you can let it go to your head.”
Calmly, Theo stood in the face of such blatant prejudice. It wasn’t as if he had expected his father to have knitted him a sweater for inmates arts and crafts day. After all, the knitting needles could serve as a great shank.
Pye snorted. “Your job assignment has nothing to do with your lineage. You’re the only Healer on retainer with experience with heart murmurs. This child has one on top of her magic, which is what our specialist found. You’re here to treat her heart.”
?” Harry smirked and nudged their noses together. “Almost half of that episode was me looking at you like you’re my new god or something.”
The woman arched a perfectly-trimmed eyebrow and propped herself up on her elbows. “What?” she asked.
Draco, on the other hand, was much less organized in his thoughts. He swiveled his chair back to the desk and flipped through a physically organized schedule. “Hm,” he murmured, flipping to the winter months of the year. “The fifth sound good to you?”
“What did yours smell like?” Draco couldn’t help but ask. “I saw you sniffing the cauldron like you were trying to get high on it.”
Harry, still out of breath from how his throat had been ravaged, knew he wasn’t going to get any  sympathy for that and quickly got up to obey Draco’s order. He went to the plush lounge couch and laid down on it, his hands still bound in front of him.
“In here, Liv,” Sirius called eagerly, lighting up immediately that his daughter-thing and his soulmate-thing were in the same room at the same time. Padfoot was an easily-pleased man.
Harry glared with no malice, suppressing a laugh. “Is it weird to say I have a newfound respect for women? I mean, I’ve always respected women, but this shit is hard. Drag queens, too. Basically anyone who works in heels,” Harry pondered aloud, getting to the second floor and moving up the next flight of stairs without stopping.
Kind and cruel, empathy and torture… Draco brushed his fingertips over the words as if that could better help him feel them. He had even stressed discretion as Pansy advised, and Draco was now properly horrified to realize he was taking her advice.
“Painslut,” Draco accused, nails digging into Harry’s hips as he fucked him. “I bet I won’t even have to touch that cock of yours to make you come.”
“Harry,” Draco groaned, putting his full effort into the first syllable of his name so he could chant it. “Harry, Harry, Harry—“
Draco looked up at Harry over the edge of his book with an amused grin. Grace had excused herself to the guest room after dinner which left Harry and Draco to once more enjoy their fireplace—magicked to cool the room since it was summer. Their parlor really was beautiful, and it made Harry sort of excited for cold winters snuggled up next to Draco. Their daughter could sit on their laps.
Harry looked so much younger like this, his face less pressed in concern now that his mind was off in dreamland. What could he be dreaming of? Harry’s raven hair covered his eyes, the bird’s nest having reformed with a vengeance in the tossing and turning of the night.
Draco rolled his eyes fondly, confident that neither of them knew a single thing about growing up. There wasn’t one way to do it, and they’d get to watch their own children give it a shot one day.
With a sigh, Lucius backed down. His plan was still brewing in his mind, but if it was against Theo’s wishes… Well, why upset him more? Lucius wasn’t as heartless as the papers made him out to be.
“Hm.” Draco’s lips spread into a smile. “Yes, yes I could.” He kissed Harry as if to confirm that statement. “So revenge it’ll be.”
Ginny laughed as she skimmed the made-up details of Draco’s ‘motherly instincts’. Oh, how the Prophet loved gender roles. “You’re jealous of them,” she decided. “Just because we’ve only been on the cover twice doesn’t mean this is a competition.”
“And there’s more where that came from.” Draco hooked his fingers into Harry’s panties and pulled down, exposing him. Harry wriggled self-consciously as Draco removed the panties from the garters so Harry would have the socks on still when he was fucking him.
“Then give me one good reason why I shouldn’t hex you senseless,” Harry growled. His only thoughts showed up as angry red scribbles before him, feeling himself fall into a familiar hypersensitivity that he’d worked so hard to shed for his Auror work.
Apparently there was something sort of magical about that fabric, because the man behind the counter gave Harry a lasting look when he put all of it down to buy it. “Excellent choices,” the clerk purred. He had a croft of black hair and five o’clock shadow, and Harry liked to think that the clothes weren’t the only reason the other man was checking him out.
“Can you stop?” Theo shouted, his shakes having turned into a ball of raw energy that could be directed into any emotion, including anger. “I am trying to fucking propose.”
He pushed one of their pink zebra striped bags out of the way with his foot and started putting his combo in, standing dead in the center of their lunch circle because he was entitled to it, dammit.
“It’s as good as done if you point me in the right direction.” Harry figured it was minor enough, and they could always find another portrait of another war criminal.
“Hey, wait!” Dudley said, feeling massively pathetic. “When do you have to go back to work? Maybe we could grab a meal somewhere that doesn’t have a clown at the door. I mean, if you want to—“
Draco gave him a little shove but couldn’t be brought to do much more than that for his sass, because this setup was truly beautiful. Not only had Harry finished a project all on his own, but it looked damn good with the purple and blue towels and bath mats to accent the room. “It’s very you,” Draco complimented. He took a deep breath and turned to look Harry in the eye. “I love it.”
“You have, Harry. You’re a very good boy.” Draco’s lips parted to take Harry’s cock in his mouth, moving up inch by precious inch until his nose could touch Harry’s flat stomach.
Pansy nodded happily before sneaking in a nip at Maggie’s neck. The fact that workplace fraternization wasn’t even close to allowed made the whole thing even sexier.
“Load up the bag, Kenny,” she said to the next child, tossing them a sack. She had red-framed sunglasses on but Harry could catch glimpses of her eyes shimmering beneath them. Uh-oh, indeed.
Dudley nodded. “Yeah, I get that,” he said as if he at all got that. “And I’m keeping you from work.” There was the guilt again.
Mad that Ron was right, mad that Ron was even here, it all was a massive swirling ball of rage inside the cage of his mouth. Sickly, Harry let out a little laugh. “I might’ve in a few years,” Harry admitted quietly. “Maybe even in a few months, if things kept up the way they were. Tired all the time, sad all the time, I can’t stop pulling out my hair like some kind of freak, and on top of everything I knew I was worrying you, making your life harder!”
“…I would say something snide back but these look really soft,” Harry marveled quietly, running his fingertips over the fabric.
When Harry’s hands reached up to rest on Draco’s waist they were swatted away. “Did I say you could touch me with those hands?” Draco demanded.
With his heart in his throat and his eyes on Draco’s back, Harry followed. It wasn’t a long walk at all until they were in front of a door—just one door, no doubles. When Draco opened it to reveal a room of a simpler kind of elegance than Draco’s room had sported it made Harry smile.
The bra was a bit of a puzzle to Harry having only ever unhooked Ginny’s once by accident through her shirt in an ill-fated snogging session. He held it up to the light and found the front, at least, slipping it on over his shoulders and fastening the clasp in back quite unevenly.
“Here,” Draco said, glad to see the shop was still open for another hour on its placard. “What you have on is just fine, don’t take it as a jab, but where we’re going you’ll need to be dressed
“What—? No, Harry, no, she does not hate you. Pansy Parkinson reserves hate for those who deserve it and you don’t, not to me and not to her.” Draco realized he was coming on strong in his defense of her but all Pansy had ever done was defend him, so how could he not return the favor? Draco took a breath to calm down. “Funnily enough she thinks the same of you, that you hate her because she wanted to give you up,” he recalled of one drunken night spent venting to each other.
Harry rolled his eyes fondly. He’d definitely seen the hot tub thing in movies. Still, he was relieved it wasn’t so early in the relationship. One day he’d be ready, and being inexperienced didn’t really scare him as much as it used to. Draco gave a fuck about him.
Harry was both relieved and oddly disappointed. That wouldn’t make any sense at all, ‘D’ knowing where he lived, but for a moment he’d almost hoped he did. He rose to answer the door.
Harry nodded again, eyelids heavier than before. He pulled away from the hug to wipe his eyes more dedicatedly. “Yeah, we can do that.”
At the reference to the pharmacy at which Harry worked, he shuddered slightly. Oh, the long hours behind the counter scanning ointments and all other sorts of personal items for sale. “But still. That’s what I work for there. To pay for things.”
When Draco next spoke his breath puffed between Harry’s arsecheeks. “As long as I’ve been waiting to do this.” A wet, hot tongue swiped over Harry’s hole and his toes curled under. Draco licked again and Harry gripped the sheets for dear life. Of all the times Harry had said for Draco to kiss his arse… Prophetic.
“You certainly may, my sweet boy,” Draco answered, voice but a purr in the deep back of his throat. His cock was harder than ever to see Harry’s confidence growing.
She sat impossibly still on the lip of the statue, ears peeled for any footsteps on the freshly-watered grass. Lily had a pair of clip-on Barbie earrings on them that she liked to think gave her supersonic hearing like her daddies sometimes had. They heard everything!
“They expect everyone to react that way to me. I’ll have to explicitly inform them of your romantic intentions for them to go into full-on protective stance,” Draco told him. His stomach felt light with Harry so close. Draco tilted his head, brushing his lips lightly over Harry’s left cheek.
“Apparently,” Pansy snarked. “No amount of PCP, X, or GHB can make some people even remotely bearable.”
Harry jumped again, trying to straighten out his body as much as he could to elongate the length of it in these tall shoes.
Ginny rolled her eyes. “Then don’t you think he doesn’t use race in an offensive way because of you?”
Inside the event itself Ginny recognized Draco and Harry as soon as they walked in, too. The masks were to ward off strangers, but Ginny Weasley knew these two too well.
His nails dug into Harry’s hips, but he barely put up any resistance to the way Harry fucked his mouth. Draco sucked and lapped eagerly with an unrivaled oral fixation. Harry whimpered around Draco’s prick when he felt his go that deeply into Draco’s throat.
Harry blinked. Warmth blossomed inside of his chest like a flower opening to the sun for the first time. “You… you do?”
“Does the Head Auror get to do that?” Draco asked before nudging his forehead against Harry’s cheek.
“Of course!” Draco proclaimed. “It’s going to get her far in life. Even if she’s not attracted to men, they will be attracted to her because she will be gorgeous. She can use them and get to the top in no time, and then prove her superior skills. Teachers will give her high marks and she will be her own boss.”
“I thought you banned your friends from helping you with the Manor since the incident with Blaise Zabini and the plumbing,” Lucius remarked. He sipped his tea, wondering which friend had been allowed back on the project.
Both men gave one final groan before their climaxes took them both, Draco filling Harry up and Harry shooting ropes of white into the tub.
“He wasn’t ‘your’ house elf. Dobby was a free elf,” Harry responded like a jerk of the knee to a Healer’s tests. Lucius’ eyes narrowed. Draco panicked.
Gregory Goyle’s eyes were wide, even behind his mask. He too was wearing a full suit, which he had insisted on from the start. “Want a towel?” he asked Harry carefully.
Absurdly, Harry’s brain wondered what Riddle would make of all this. He couldn’t love, not after being conceived under the effects of a love potion, but he had been in Harry’s head for a long, long time—longer than he hadn’t been at this point still.
Harry could be so silly, and it made Draco so giddy. He took Harry’s shot and lifted it to his lips, the smaller man taking it down easily. “So, your story,” Draco said, idly fondling Harry’s chest over his shirt. “It starts with a lonely prince, all alone in his big, empty castle.”
The only solution seemed to be sleep, which Harry willingly gave into. Draco didn’t mind, of course, since a nap would at least shake up their selection process.
Harry smiled and kissed his sugary lips before getting himself a spoonful of the ice cream. “I’m all ears.”
“I hope you find your answers soon,” Luna wished for them. “Is there anything else you wanted anyone else to know? Now’s your chance to speak it to all of my readers.”
“I’m busy that night,” he tried, putting all his effort forth to get past Lucius’ internal lie detector.
“That’s fine,” Harry went with Draco’s first answer. “Yeah, that sounds good. I think I’m going to say about the same to Ron and Hermione when the week is up, that I met someone and we took a vacation together. I… really can’t tell them how we met again or what we do aside from dates, I think I’ll die of embarrassment. You’re lucky your friends can talk about that kind of stuff,” he pointed out.
probably still don’t. What’s their number? Did they change addresses? We should press charges, sue them for all they—“
“Yes,” she grumbled. It was almost depressing that she had only been with one guy before conceiving a living, breathing child.
“I think I did, too,” Harry couldn’t help but agree. He settled in beside Draco, nudging their thighs together. “And I believe face masks were mentioned?”
“Look, you’ll know soon enough, okay? I just—I have to go talk to Harry.” This would kill Theo. Draco just knew it.
The finger pressed against the roof of Harry’s warm cavern, rubbing a spot deep within him that made Harry’s whole body warm. His member was still recovering, but this internal attention felt divine.
“I cannot actually go to my second half of classes today,” Draco said, ignoring his best friend entirely. “I cannot sit in front of Mr. Flitwick while he blathers on about algebraic equations. My body is unable to handle that kind of boredom.”
Harry’s face turned to a frown. “Draco, you were a kid when all of that stuff happened to us. And I mean that, ‘happened to us’, because we sure as hell didn’t make it happen ourselves. Everything you’ve done as an adult, training for and getting a job at Mungo’s, that’s the life you’ve made happen. This whole house is what you’ve made happen. Every inch, every nail and floorboard is yours, and I happen to really like it.”
The hits, the slaps, the kicks, the nails in Harry’s back. Though they were all imagined, Harry felt them as clearly as he would feel Draco’s later that night. His stomach would flip at the thought of being tossed over a man’s knee and having his panties yanked down so a big, strong hand could discipline him.
They said their goodbyes to the couple knowing that they had more than enough problems to work out on their own.
Gripping his wand in his pocket was the constant reminder of the power he did have. It had become a tell. He would have never wanted to lead such a public life if he’d gotten the choice. The cameras were and continued being the worst thing about being Harry Potter. The flash that captured his dumbfounded face made him wince, and he had only sunglasses as his defense.
“That’s right,” Draco growled. His hips had sped up, losing all sense of rhythm to blindly push forward into the lubricated heat around him. He knew he was leaking inside of Harry and didn’t have much time left himself. “Come on, one more time: Who’s your Daddy?”
Guilt, shame, everything Draco felt when he looked at his left forearm—now empty but still pulsing with the reminder of what he’d done—was getting the better of him. He thanked the waitress perhaps too profusely when she brought the red wine he’d requested and drank deep once it was poured.
Harry allowed himself a confused smile. “What are you getting at?” He swept his hand through Draco’s hair to mess it all up, being the only one allowed to do such a thing.
“Comeslut extraordinaire,” Draco dubbed him and Harry laughed like a fool, leaning into his every touch. “Mm, was it everything you wanted?”
“Hm. Say I’ve gone to some university open house for applicants only where I talk to current students and form bonds and make connections or something,” Draco told him. That sounded slightly reasonable and responsible enough to throw his father off of his trail. “I’ll be back around… Hm. I don’t know when I’ll be back.”
“And how do we do that?” Olivia asked, still disoriented by the racks on the inside of the store that she knew contained undergarments.
Draco laid Harry down on the cushioned bench on the wall perpendicular to the massive tub. It was the biggest in the house, and if Draco was being honest with himself he’d admit it was always intended to hold two people.
“There are things you should experience,” Draco went on once she was out of earshot again, dunking a chocolate-chip cookie into the chocolate fountain. “Now that you have the freedom and the means to, don’t you think it’s time?”
The corners of Draco’s lips tugged up. “You’re foxed,” he decided. Harry was likely a lightweight from lack of experience and his size.
“Ironic it’d be the same person involved in both headlines,” spoke the man on the other side of the desk. His foot was tapping nervously while Rita’s were almost vibrating out of her stiletto heels with excitement. He frowned to watch her flip through the pages of the first copy of The Prophet they would distribute tomorrow morning. “Well. We’ve made the Unbreakable Vow, and you will never reveal your source.”
“I’m aware.” Her arms crossed over her chest, but something about that out-of-character admission on Blaise’s behalf had piqued her interest.
“But…” Harry looked around his flat. It had been much nicer when he’d moved in, much cleaner. It wasn’t the biggest he could have rented but he didn’t need large spaces when he’s live in a cupboard for most of his childhood. “I don’t know,” he gave in lamely. The oven timer went off. “Saved by the bell,” he joked darkly, getting up to go retrieve his food. “Want a slice?”
“I haven’t drunk a sip of alcohol at all,” she continued. “I have no STDs, and you’ll see that in the blood test. I’ve been staying at my friend’s house and nobody knows. I went to a free clinic and they said that it looks all clear and on-track.”
This wand had been with him through everything. He overturned it in his hand and tried to remember the wonderful things that magic could do instead of the terrible things he’d witnessed. Harry was happier when he was casting spells, it was true, and he had to remember that.
And finally, the boys. I love established and domestic relationships, man. They’re the best.  Thanks to everyone for supporting this! Also, yes, for those of you who haven’t read the prequel to this: Theodore Nott and Colin Creevey are in my holy trinity of ships. Drarry, Wolfstar, and Tholin. It’s a bit like a religion, so just play along until you love it as much as I do.
“Fine, I’m sorry that I was an asshole. I’m going to bed now.” Draco tunneled under the sheets, wrapping himself and stuffing a pillow over his head just in case Potter decided to speak any more ridiculous words or request childish apologies.
The knickers beneath were an innocent white, soft cotton. Draco’s gaze drifted up Harry’s skirt, a hand climbing up the inside of his knee to slide up his thigh. “Look at you. So supple and spread. Your arms are next—you’ll be completely immobilized for this.”
Harry swallowed the lump in his throat. Yes, he would very much like that, but… “Merlin, what was in that treacle tart?” he asked with a breathy laugh. Harry snapped back to attention a moment later with: “The treacle tart.”
Putting down the notepad, Harry let Draco see all of his incoherent scribbling. “It reveals that the men you’ve dated are idiots.”
Damn, Draco was efficient. He really wasn’t messing around when it came to making these two hours count. Harry wondered if he should speak up about this not needing to fit in the timeframe after all, but in the end he was too curious to see how Draco was going to play the rest of this to remove the restriction.
That was… Actually nice. “Thank you,” he said to Draco sincerely. “For returning my phone.” In that moment it also clicked in Harry’s mind that the phone was the spoiled rich boy way of saying ‘sorry’ without actually saying it out loud.
So, with one cameraman filming the three of them on the couch feverishly typing and holding the phone up to their ear, the hope was that ‘Macklemore’ wouldn’t be able to ignore so many calls at once.
“Okay,” his partner sighed. “So, then I guess I have to ask: what counts as sex? Because I mean it’s pretty easy to know that with a guy and a girl what that is, but what is it for two blokes? Is it just the bum stuff?”
The number of elves they had for dinner parties was even more grandiose, as every pureblood family with a purist reputation was invited, even those without endless pockets. While the elves slaved in front of stoves and hurriedly arranged dinner platters, Narcissa put on a short cocktail dress and her highest heels.
“He was the one who put an ad out looking for someone with exactly my kind of desires,” Draco let them in on. “I was one of many who responded to him, but he only ever replied to me.”
“I’m sorry,” Rachel interjected in such a polite and effortless way that Draco was reminded of his mother a bit. “But I’m not familiar with any of this. As I’m sure you’ve read in my file, I wasn’t planning on choosing the route of adoption.”
Sirius shrugged. “Girls develop faster than boys. Maybe when I’m sixty I’ll have the maturity level Lily Potter had at twenty. That seems about right.”
“Yours, your hole, Daddy,” Harry whimpered, shaking with anticipation of what was to come. Or perhaps ‘who was to come’ would be more apt. “It’s all yours to do with as you see fit.”
If Ruth was bothered by it, though, she didn’t show it. The second the airplane touched the ground her eyes were as big as saucers. Anyone who looked in them could see the city lights as the sun began to set.
They’d both had a hard time getting to sleep. Draco tried everything from warm milk to back rubs on the both of them but nothing had soothed their mutual anxiety. “Everything is stupid,” Harry grumbled into his husband’s skin.
A little chill ran through him at the thought of lying there next to Draco in the dark when all he had on was a pair of tight Calvin Klein briefs. Harry tried his hardest to ignore it.
Narcissa giggled and hid her face in her hand. “Maybe we should have built them a lean-to, or some sort of shelter…”
“I don’t really want it to stop,” Theo clarified, since he was officially unclear on everything. “I mean, I bought it for a reason.”
“Of course, dear.” Draco gave Harry’s shoulder a squeeze to test where he was on touch this morning and Harry eagerly leaned into it. Interesting. “Now, eat up. You have a long day of training ahead of you if you want it, remember?”
Harry certainly didn’t grow up wanting to be on television, it just sort of happened to him as a kid, getting into some sort of trouble almost all the time. Harry had never looked for the trouble, though.
“Polyjuice Potion is your kink?” Ginny asked, doubting. “Hey, you two,” she said to Draco and Harry once they arrived. “You recognize either of them? They were caught using Polyjuice Potion by the stamp.”
In this position Harry’s lingerie dress fell back down to cover some of his arse, so Draco quickly moved it away. He wouldn’t take it all the way off, though, not when Harry so enjoyed being dressed and pretty for him.
Draco’s body was a familiar plane, one that Harry never got tired of traveling. He’d cover it in kisses and bites, always keeping his hands on Draco. Alabaster skin, icy-blonde hair, and chiseled muscles. It was something straight out of Harry’s wet dreams.
Harry rolled his eyes but then realized Draco couldn’t see that. “My size fluctuated a lot after the war. I tried to gain the weight back but it didn’t really work.” Harry sure hoped that muggle shopkeeper had left the area so he wouldn’t hear this. When Harry said ‘the war’ in front of muggles they thanked him for his service in Afghanistan, and he couldn’t exactly correct them without breaching the Statute of Secrecy. “I haven’t shopped for new clothes in… a long while.”
Harry would have been dragging Brooke’s profile pictures into Google image search if they were pictures of actual humans, but alas. The only solid piece of evidence for Brooke’s identity was her phone number.
“Did we?” Draco replied playfully as they strolled back to the magically roped-off Prophet reporters. “Why, what did we forget?”
“Have a lovely evening, Sirs,” the gentleman wished them and Draco slipped him a hundred on the counter. Before he could thank them Draco waved Harry on, taking the receipt without looking at the total and tossing it in the bin by the door on the way out.
Plus, back in the car he’d read over Kennedy’s email. He discovered that her father’s mobility was affected enough for him to be on disability pay, and had shamefully enough had to actually Google what Parkinson’s Disease was in the first place.
A bell rang as he entered, catching the attention of a man behind a white counter. “Welcome to Station Crossing!” he said enthusiastically. He was a balding man with kindly brown eyes and South London accent.
The ‘please’ may have done him in, but Lucius wasn’t going to show it right away. Not in front of all of these people; his pride was too delicate for that.
They did work, was the crazy thing. Looking between them now Ron could see every little look they exchanged, how in sync they were with each other. It was mad, and sort of brilliant.
Draco’s hands flew to his mouth when the television fed him back a noise that was, apparently, his voice.
Harry lifted his head and Draco turned around to see the hollow of the man who used to be Severus Snape. “What in the world do you two think you’re doing?”
Draco pried his grey eyes from Harry’s faux-innocence in his green ones, as intoxicating as it was to see. He next focused on Harry’s groin, palming all around it but never quite staying long enough to satisfy. “You are such a treat. Harry Potter, trembling for me in his pretty knickers.” Draco pushed them to the side and set Harry’s cock free. “Why, I could just eat you up.”
She shrugged. After a lifetime of never having someone who wanted her unconditionally, it was strange to think someone really could. Quietly, she missed the parents she had no real memories of.
“Harry, seriously,” Ron spoke at the door. “I know you’re upset about something, probably, but please, you have to let us in.”
It was creepy, it was a red flag, and it really should have bothered Harry more than it actually did.
“Yes, yes, because I’m so charming, I am often complimented on my sparkling personality,” Draco flippantly replied before smacking Harry’s ass, knocking him off-balance for a moment but ultimately catching himself on a stair. “Ha! Not bad for a day’s work.”
They had had several such moments but Harry’s voice failed him each time. Maybe he needed some of that reckless confidence he’d had when he approached Draco at the bar knowing he was ‘Daddy D’.
“We didn’t mean to hurt him,” the ginger spoke again. His voice was crackly and pitchy like it was changing right in front of everyone.
Draco finally settled on the copy of The Hobbit that Granger had left in their library after visiting one day. She apparently had finished her re-read of the series only to find between her and her husband they owned two copies. Hermione gave Harry the book even though she knew it would gather dust on their bookshelf.
He shook his mop of blonde hair. “It’s, uh. It’s funny, because my mum used to plant those too,” he lied. By the time Colin was six, his mother hadn’t even been well enough to get out of bed.
“I want her to not only be happy and learn from this experience,” Harry countered before Draco even rehashed his point about even the failed romances being valuable experiences. “But I want her to come out of it in love with a real, genuine girl.”
He’d pass it along during lunch, when the prisoners were allowed to eat together in silence. It was yet another feature of the ‘new and improved’ Azkaban, along with a yard to get exercise in. When the Minister saw that prisoners had gone into muscular atrophy from lack of movement, the reforms came at lightning speed.
“I’ll talk through everything I do,” Draco informed him, a tactic for the more skittish patients. “And I already have your measurements from the muggle shop yesterday so that’s quite a bit off my list. Here.” Draco spoke the incantation to summon a scale. “Step on,” Draco invited and recorded the result before transfiguring the scale into a stethoscope. “And I assume you know what this does?” Draco joked.
“Then we’ll have to change that,” Draco insisted, stepping into trousers that matched his jacket in print. Yes, this was starting to look like an outfit. “Even generations ago your family was always considered New Money. Let the Old Money show you how to spend it properly.”
“I could stay here another few days,” Draco offered for the hundredth time. “Like last week.” When everything had been happy and safe and secret.
A flower-laced eyebrow on Theo’s forehead rose. “You were thinking about shagging me in a wedding venue? That’s scandalous, you horny fuck.”
There was far more wrong with this group of players than just some messed up mechanics (a healer had run off the platform and fell to their death, the tank had terrible damage-per-second rates, and Draco was the only one dispelling anything), but Draco supposed that was also true. With each patch there were instructions on the fights, but people never read the instructions. Of course not.
“After ruling out women with STDs, STIs, drugs in their system, and history of violent crimes, four thousand remain.”
Tenderly, Colin cupped Theo’s cheek. “Like, forever?” he asked breathlessly. “Is a Slytherin voluntarily talking about commitment? Because honestly, who are you and what have you done with my boyfriend?”
Ruth’s neck flushed pink. “Well, sure. Let me find some… Representative ones,” she laughed breathily as she scrolled through her phone.
That was jumping to conclusions, though. Jordan was a viable candidate who never bothered Draco or Harry, and she was just as pregnant as Grace.
Deciding it would be more fun this way, Draco played dumb. “That I was what? A Quidditch player? A Professor?”
“Hey,” Ron said quietly to his partner. “What are you thinking about?” When Harry kept things in, it only made things worse for his mental health—which was a deep concern of Ron’s. “Talk to me.”
Harry’s moans carried over the armchair and into the cavernous library, empty of books for now but soon to be filled. “Draco,” Harry sputtered out when his cockhead hit his prostate like that. “Oh, Daddy, that’s so good.”
“That’s how you know,” Harry said as if that was brand new information that Draco had not already figured out on his own. It was still fun to play around with this man, the one whose name he finally knew. Draco Malfoy.
Hermione looked to her partner in life and love to see if he was seeing this too, this new Harry. Maybe a charm
“Work,” Ron shrugged as he flipped through the menu. “Work and wedding stuff, mostly. We have most of it figured out but it’s like there’s always something new—new guests, new traditions my parents want to include.”
“It’s a muggle expression. You have a phone at home, you know.” Draco suddenly appearing after they were both done with work wasn’t a rare occurrence, but he hadn’t even dragged along his better half. They were supposed to be dealing with the baby stuff together, right?
“Hey, I’ll be the one watching her at home. I can turn her into a stand-up Gryffindor girl whose main interest lies in saving dying, pus-filled, bloody magical creatures,” Harry teased.
Behind the heated discussion, Remus and Sirius gave their goodbye hugs and kisses to Harry and Draco.
Did he not think that Draco would do anything to make it real? It wasn’t Draco’s fault he was born into a boring world where his greatest accomplishment would probably be something mundane and pitiful in the eyes of an adventurer who had travelled over forsaken lands wielding mighty powers.
