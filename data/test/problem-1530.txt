------------------
Draco fixed him a stern look.
“But...But why didn’t you tell me sooner?!”
This caused some giggles. Then McGonagall said with her glass raised, “To Mr Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger!”
“Where is Potter?” Draco demanded suddenly, turning to his friends.
Harry couldn’t even feel hurt because he knew how much it would’ve taken Draco to admit this.
Draco then placed his hand against Harry’s heart and pulled back so that Harry was forced to look at him, “They’ll always be with you, in here.”
Harry heard the wild chatter from the Great Hall grow nearer and nearer as he and Draco walked up the stone steps and entered the Entrance Hall. Delicious fumes filled the air and Harry felt his stomach tighten with hunger, but his appetite was quickly forgotten as he realised he was now facing the prospect of walking into the Great Hall alongside Draco Malfoy.
“Aye ‘Arry! Come try this!” Seamus yelled at him from across the room.
Harry fixed Draco with a fierce gaze, and Draco returned it determinedly.
“So, apart from you being a thrill seeking daredevil, why did you end up in Gryffindor?” Draco demanded.
Hermione went pink and looked down at the table, smiling.
Harry, at his worst and most reckless of times, would even make Draco jealous on purpose; perhaps flirt with Ginny or laugh loudly in the Great Hall, only to relish in the angered look on Draco’s face from the Slytherin table.
There was a pause, and then-
Harry growled at the sight, Draco’s tie hanging loosely around his neck, his shirt left open to reveal his delicious toned stomach.
Hermione raised her eyes from her book, eyeing Harry suspiciously, a little too suspiciously for Harry’s liking. Her eyes were now darting behind him and Harry’s heart rate only intensified.
Harry was ascending the dungeons after an unfair and gruelling detention with Snape, and Draco was descending them.
“Harry... I want you so badly,” Draco whispered into Harry’s ear, causing Harry to groan, feeling himself becoming hard.
He felt a rush of gratitude toward his best friends, despite still hearing the gossiping and laughing echoing all around him at his expense.
“What?” Harry said.
“Hogsmeade trip this weekend!” Seamus yelled as he pinned the parchment to the noticeboard.
“Let’s take this to your room.”
Draco looked at him properly now, his eyes danced around Harry’s face; from his hair to his neck and then back up to his eyes. Harry felt exposed, but he couldn’t bring himself to look away.
“I think they have a word for that.”
Harry spluttered, “Aren’t you?!”
Harry had no idea what Draco was thinking, was now the right time to bring up that gravitational pull that Harry believed urged the two together? Or would it be better to just come clean and admit to Draco that he liked him? What if Draco just thought this was a fun thing to do and he really had no feelings for Harry? The Slytherin was so free these days that he seemed to just go where the tide took him. He thought it better not to tell Draco how he felt, considering he was still distantly intoxicated and Draco might think he was just taking the piss.
Harry turned to see a small smile on Draco’s face. Harry raised his eyebrows, “And I thought you were bad.”
Moreover, Draco had begun to adopt a muggle style and incorporate it with his already flawless  wizarding sense of fashion. The perfect combination of formal and casual. Dress pants but paired with a hoodie or sweater. Crisp white shirt one would usually wear with a tuxedo, but Draco undid the top few buttons at his chest and then tucked one side of it into the front of his black trousers and then left the other half hanging out loosely. It drew Harry wild, how he looked so smart and yet so relaxed. And then those tight black long sleeves he’d wear with a loose, T-shirt over the top, Merlin, the stuck up pureblood had really been left behind with the war.
“But surely I can go up there now and prove his innocence!” Harry said cutting Hermione off, “Surely if I vouch for him that’ll make a difference!”
“You’re afraid,” Draco rasped.
Draco swallowed before answering.
“Um, thank you...Harry.”
“God if I didn’t know any better I’d think we were at the Burrow on September 1st.”
Draco looked smug, his arms still crossed against his chest, “You say this is your home isn’t it? It never made any sense to me why someone who was so anti Ministry, who literally talked down to and turned his back on the Minister for Magic, would want to work in a department in the freaking Ministry…”
As Harry approached from the side, he slowed, not wanting to startle him.
“I’ll go first,” Luna said loudly.
“Yes Ron?” Draco said politely.
He and Ginny were the only one’s still sitting at the table, finishing their dessert.
Harry scooted back on it. The desk was big enough for Harry to sit on, but small enough that when Draco moved to kiss him, Harry’s back was flush against the stone wall.
Draco stared back at him. His hands still pinning Harry’s arms to the ground.
“Potter…”
This was apparently very funny according to Harry and Seamus and they both broke out in another fit of giggles.
“That’s nice, you’ve grown quite close haven’t you?”
“Are you in love with Dean Thomas?”
“Right, yeah” Harry cleared his throat, “I mean I could say the same for you but...we’re past that, aren’t we?”
Harry began kissing his neck again, “I’m fine I promise,” Harry breathed between kisses.
“Well somehow the rest of school maintains their houses, but the eighth years operate without them,” Ernie said as Harry nodded.
“Dare or not, I don’t think I’d seen Potter get up from the floor quicker no sooner had the dare left my lips.”
“Uh, yeah sorry about that.” Harry looked up at him then, “Well, OK, if you’re offering.”
Draco smiled, then reached up, like he usually did Harry had noted, to gently push one of Harry’s curls away from his forehead.
Slowly, not breaking eye contact, Draco lowered himself down towards Harry’s face. Grey eyes moving down to Harry’s lips and back up to his blazing green eyes.
When they finally reached Rosmerta’s pub, the warmth they felt as they walked through the door was like putting on fresh, dry, warm clothes.
Draco shook his head, “Don’t worry about me.”
The blond stirred before slowly opening his eyes and looking up at Harry. He smiled softly and then moved his hand to slowly but gracefully trace the back of his fingers along Harry’s cheek. Harry’s breath hitched as he stared down at Draco, tempted to take the hand that had just caressed his face into his own. But before he could move, Draco seemed to abruptly awaken from his hazeful bliss. He sat up straight and cleared his throat, not looking at Harry, shuffling now back to his side of the bed.
He was safe with Ron, because Ron had been there with Harry on every anniversary since they’d started school, and the redhead knew to give Harry his space, but to also remain in his presence so he didn’t feel lonely. He felt a rush of fierce love for his best friend.
“Is that my, my sweater?”
As Ron, Hermione, Blaise, Ginny and Luna all chatted animatedly, Draco seemed to read Harry’s mind.
“Who says that?” Harry asked.
“Positive. I mean, as long as you want to too?”
Harry chuckled into his neck, “No you don’t.”
“Oh come on.” She grabbed his arm and they turned together toward the spiral staircase, Ron ranting as she pulled him along.
Harry’s breath started to quicken, “But...But-”
Harry looked away, “Nothing.”
He ran a palm down Harry’s jaw, “Do you know how much you turn me on when you’re like this?”
After their excessively filling Christmas lunch, another round of drinks had come about.
Lying completely still, with his hand still palmed over his crotch, acting as though nothing weird was happening just in case Draco really had woken up, Harry really couldn’t believe what was happening next.
As Harry tried to distract his anxious mind with thoughts about the kind of sparkling decorations the house elves will adorn their common room with, he suddenly heard a tapping at one of his windows. He turned and saw a medium sized owl, cloaked in snow, tapping its beak urgently on the window.
Harry smiled and squeezed his hand. He felt a flutter in his stomach at the fact that Draco had remembered the details of the first night they slept next to each other.
He was wrong.
“I think Dad’ll be alright by himself, we’ve had a recent infestation of garden gnomes in our backyard, so I’m sure they’re keeping him occupied.”
Harry laughed cruelly, “Why? Scared of what the Death Eaters would do if they found out Malfoy’s pureblood son was hooking up with Harry Potter?”
“Shut up Potter!” Draco hissed, “You’re so loud.”
“And besides,” Draco continued, “Pansy and Blaise are straight, well...so they say anyway.” The blond giggled again.
Harry smiled at Ron’s words.
Draco’s voice was the perfect mixture of smooth and raspy.
When he was a meter behind the four sleek robes of emerald and black, he spoke.
Harry downright choked. His erection becoming more and more apparent. Images of a nude Draco now flashing through his mind.
Harry and Draco tried to suppress their giggles.
Harry looked fiercely at Draco now and squeezed his hand.
“Potter,” he said.
Harry closed his eyes at the touch, “Mmm...I missed that.”
“I am exhausted. But I’m not exhausted enough to refuse sleeping beside you.”
Harry shut his eyes, swearing under his breath, as if this would deny him the reality of the situation.
His bedroom in Malfoy Manor was fit for a prince, and his fluffy, layered doona covers were varied shades of green, primarily emerald, and they lay scattered between two nearly naked bodies.
“‘Mione you look really beautiful,” Ron said hiccuping again.
Harry laughed as Draco smirked innocently.
“Yeah. That.” Harry felt that familiar sinking feeling in his stomach.
Harry laid down slowly as he pulled Draco up over him.
“Merlin,” Harry muttered. He looked to his right to see Crabbe scrambling out of his bed.
Draco had crawled over to Harry, resting his head on the brunette’s shoulder.
The young man looked to Harry, “Harry Potter, what an honour to meet you.”
“That’s great Luna. If you’re happy, we’re happy for you,” Harry said.
At that thought, and at the encouragement of Draco’s acceptance to his offer, Harry felt the familiar sensation of Gryffindor courage getting the better of him. He figured, in this loud and echoey classroom, why not just bring it up now.
“Don’t even try Malfoy. I know how you feel.”
Harry felt like he knew where this was going, that the conversation was simply not going to stay on the topic of Quidditch. He kept his eyes on the fire as he spoke.
The man looked to Draco then and put out his hand, “Good morning Mr Malfoy. My name is Sir Pattison Edmund Saunders.”
As they made their way up the winding path, Harry stealing as many side glances toward Draco as he could, Draco broke the silence first.
Harry swore. It was too much to take in. So many sensations and feelings coursing through his body.
Ron sat between the two Slytherin’s. Draco reaching over, scruffing up his red hair.
“Harry that’s between you and Draco,” Hermione said as they reached Harry and Draco’s platform.
A few of the students giggled.
“H-Harry...I’m close.”
Harry simply couldn’t fathom what was happening. Among all of his strange encounters through his years at Hogwarts, sitting in Draco Malfoy’s lap on the stone cold floor of the dungeons while the Slytherin nuzzled his neck, was taking bizarre to a whole new level.
“Just on weekends though, it’s sort of an extracurricular activity for the younger levels,” Parvati said.
“Spit it out Potter.”
“Er, do you want to come in?”
He let out a sigh and closed his eyes.
When the three of them entered the common room, it was deserted, save for the bulky Ministry man standing on the common rooms threshold. The time must’ve only been nearing about eight o’clock. It was Sunday, so the majority of the eighth years would be sleeping in.
“Well, what about you?” Draco said looking at Harry.
“Wait Draco,” Harry whispered as he placed one palm on Draco’s chest. “I don’t think we’ve thought this through.”
As Harry looked at the two of them, his insides swelled with admiration. Their two purely blond heads leaned toward one another, chatting warmly.
Not long after, Harry watched as McGonagall rose from the Headmistress’s chair, and began to head back through the Great Hall.
“Well, it’s like Pansy said,” Hermione spoke cautiously, “We’ll just have to get used to them. Just like they’ll have to get used to us.”
Harry's heart was leaping. He knew he and Draco had gotten each other off last night but hearing Draco’s admittance made him feel a hundred times better. But what did it mean? Harry still didn’t know if this was what Draco just did with his friends. Harry recalled the arousing images of Draco and Blaise making out, and knowing that the two of them had definitely engaged in something of the like before.
Harry knew now that because Hermione and Draco were friends, Ron figured he had no choice but to be friendly with the Slytherin.
Draco and Ron walked through the door first, followed closely by an eager looking Harry and Hermione.
“Thanks a lot Harry. I’ll have no chance now that you’ve put your name down for Quidditch,” Dean said grumpily.
“Yes Potter that’s the spirit, what about your boyfriend?”
Draco laughed at his victory as he twirled the Snitch around in his fingers admiring it.
Draco’s eyes flashed in anger, “And you talk a lot of game for someone who's gonna get what’s coming to them.”
“Oh, so-”
“Bit keen there mate,” Ron said behind him.
“Merlin Harry.”
Harry, I know I said that our “gravitational pull” could endure, but now I’m not so sure. I think about you all the time, about touching you, running my hands through your hair, kissing your neck. I’ve found that I can only sleep after I’ve touched myself and thought of you. The way your head falls back in pleasure, the way you growl and moan my name. My dreams are full of black hair, lions, and navy blue sweaters.
The redness suddenly returned to Ron’s face as he looked at Hermione, betrayed.
Harry swallowed, astonished, still in disbelief that he could feel this happy.
Draco broke away and dug his head into Harry’s neck.
“Harry are you alright?”
Draco brought himself more up and over Harry so he was looking down on him slightly, before nudging Harry’s legs apart and digging his own leg between them.
Harry was running late.
Harry swallowed and cleared his throat in a futile attempt to disengage from the beauty that radiated from Draco.
Blaise was laughing so hard, and now the teachers were acting as though they couldn’t hear him.
“”Are you going to bed now?”
Harry wanted to reach out and touch him. To wrap his arms around him and never let go.
Light chatter flitted throughout the high ceilinged room, as well as Christmas symphonies floating from Filch’s overly large gramophone in one corner of the room.
Pansy’s eyes swept to Harry, who looked at her with hard eyes as if begging her mutely not to say what she was thinking.
Anyway, I’m writing to tell you that I’m back at the manor with my Mother.
Draco lowered himself down properly onto Harry as he leaned into the kiss gently.
Ron frowned in confusion. Hermione kept her eyes on him the whole way across the common room. He cursed himself for not checking if Dean and Seamus were still down in the common room, but to his first wave of relief for the night, he found his dormitory thankfully empty.
There was Albus Dumbledore, wide awake in his portrait frame.
Draco continued his train of thought, “What happened before you came to Hogwarts...?”
“Do you suppose he ever brushes his hair?
Draco growled hungrily into Harry’s throat.
“What do you want Potter?” Blaise asked sternly.
“I wanted to tell you this that day in Hogsmeade.”
Draco sighed and rolled his eyes.
“Draco. Can we talk for a moment? Please?”
“Blimey no Ron! We were just discussing our plan for the Quidditch session on Saturday...I guess we just fell asleep.”
Whenever they shared classes together, Harry could practically feel the tingling magnetism between them and not to mention the many unspoken words. This infuriated Harry, to put it lightly, as he has always been one to wear his heart on his sleeve and voice exactly how it is he is feeling. As much as he wanted to yell and scream at Draco, he couldn’t even bring himself to admit the truth out loud. Harry would yell at Draco if he could, but deep down he knew that would take them straight back to dangerous territory.
“Harry you have NEWTS to study for, you can’t just-”
Harry wasn’t a coward, so he’d stripped off the cloak a few steps behind Draco and called out to him, loathing practically dripping from his tongue.
Draco’s intense grey eyes bore into Harry.
“I hate you Potter.”
He trailed off, Harry pursued him.
And Harry could not deny, not even to himself, that these were dangerous signs of attachment. And he himself was feeling it’s wrath. He didn’t like the joy he felt inside when he glimpsed Draco’s jealousy, and he hated the flattery that soared in his stomach at Draco’s passive-aggressive nature.
Unaware of what this meant but not wanting the topic of conversation to change, Harry mustered up the most courage he had all night.
The students had returned to Hogwarts after Christmas.
George was pushing kids out of the way through the tightly narrow aisles to get to them at the doorway.
“How’s your mum?” Blaise asked.
“S-stop.” Draco choked out.
“Touch me Harry.” Draco whispered, in that arousing, raspy voice.
The conversation lingered on; they swapped stories of their summer, played exploding snap, snacked on pumpkin pasties and chocolate frogs, and discussed George’s new Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes pop-up store coming soon to Hogsmead.
Harry had to stifle a laugh, Draco was cute when he was flustered.
Harry giggled as he looked down at the boy beneath him.
“It’s just a bit of fun ‘Mione-” Harry slurred giggling.
Draco rolled his eyes at his friend but pressed on, “It’ll be hard for me to get a job anywhere else, but McGonagall supports me, so may as well take what I can get.”
They were both panting as they stared into each other’s eyes. Harry’s face was glowing with anger, but his anger had suddenly caught up with him and he wasn’t sure what to do next.
Draco was sitting cross legged underneath Harry and he pulled back to admire the brunette sitting on top of him. He reached up once again and graced his thumb along Harry’s cheek bone, then pulled him back down for a passionate kiss.
“Oh Harry,” Hermione’s motherly voice suddenly ran through his ears, “Time for bed I think.”
Harry rolled his eyes, “You’re such a prick.”
“Mate,” Ron had nudged him.
“No,” Draco smirked and tugged on Harry’s hip, pulling him on his lap.
“Seriously you’d think we’d had enough Dark Arts for a lifetime.” Ron whispered to Harry as they left the common room and headed to dinner. And Harry felt himself strongly agreeing.
“Um, right-”
“So did you guys hear? You’ve got a new common room,” Ginny said with a sharpness to her voice. Harry suspected she was perhaps upset at the reality of being away from him.
It was nice to see; another Gryffindor and Slytherin putting their ancient rivalry behind them and starting anew.
“I know you’re too proud to say the words out loud,” Harry said with an arrogant look, “But I know the truth and that’s good enough for me.”
Then the three remaining Slytherins turned to look at Harry, who apparently couldn’t find words, or his feet. He was glued to the spot, full of disbelief that this was all really happening and knowing that once Blaise told Pansy Parkinson, the whole goddamn entirety of Hogwarts would know that Harry Potter had spent the night in Draco Malfoy’s bed.
Harry didn’t care. He, like the other eighth years, had gotten used to the Slytherin’s inside-joke tendencies. He’d accepted that some things just never change, his own, seemingly eternal reckless courage was an example of that.
As Harry stood up from the bed, he found it was completely useless to use his cloak now, so he just put on his shoes and stalked to the door, ignoring the laughing Slytherins.
“Sorry Nev, you’re beaten.” Ron smiled at his opponent. “Come on Harry I need a new contender.”
“Cheer up Granger.”
‘Well, I’m going to go fly for a bit. Care to join me?”
“Nope. As much as I was longing to return to Gryffindor tower, I’m excited to see this new addition to the castle. Apparently we aren’t sharing with our old dormmates either, we all have our own room. Of course, I’m sure it’s fine if we want to share with another person,” She glanced at Ron who seemed to have caught onto her insinuation as he choked on his frog.
“Huh. So they allowed it to happen.” Harry said, a slight pang in his chest at the reality that McGonagall gave him Defence instead of Quidditch.
They reconnected their lips and began kissing passionately. Draco digging his tongue into Harry’s mouth and Harry opening up for him readily.
Harry chuckled. It really was mental.
“Oh get over yourself,” Draco chuckled, before he lifted one hand beneath Harry’s shirt, letting it roam against the skin of Harry’s stomach. Harry groaned before he could stop himself. “I’m flattered I drive you mad Potter.”
Harry swallowed, then he reached up slowly to trace his fingers along Draco’s scars.
Then Draco moved forwards and their lips met in a soft purposeful kiss. Draco ran his hands up Harry’s abs beneath his shirt, as Harry gripped more tightly on Draco’s hair. The kiss wasn’t fiery as it had been last night. Instead, it was meaningful, as if they were making a promise to each other. Their lips moved slowly and they both melted into the gentleness of the kiss. It made Harry feel alive. He felt the traces of their magic swirl around them again. He was still so astonished at the impact somebody else's mere touch caused him, and Draco seemed to know this, because he touched and kissed Harry with purpose, as if he was trying to heal Harry’s loss and deprivation.
“But you don’t know if I am! And you just did...you just did this, with me!” Harry turned his head toward him.
I can’t put into words how angry I am. These Ministry gits know no struggle. I doubt pompous Pattison has fought the Dark Arts a day in his life. Besides, where was Kingsley when all this happened??
“Your mind, it’s in overdrive.”
“Don’t be sorry, just tell me you were thinking of good things.”
Harry grumbled, “Really? I had no idea.”
Hermione looked away from him.
“Never have I ever had a uniform kink,” Draco said, eyeing Harry.
She smiled, “Great.”
Draco looked at him and smiled, “Why? Know someone else who's trying to woe me?”
That was until… he felt the familiar warmth of Draco’s fingers caressing beneath the hem of his school jumper. His breath ghosting Harry’s cheek.
Harry, I can’t wait to talk to you. It feels like I’ve waited a lifetime for whatever is happening between us. I know that there’s always been something happening between us...but it’s only now that we’ve decided to divulge in it’s mystery.
“It- It wasn’t just me,” He choked, “Ron and Hermione...I couldn’t have done it without them. I wouldn’t have survived a day without them.”
“God Draco,” Harry moaned into the blond's mouth.
Now that Harry thought about it, he realised he would have to tell Ron and Hermione what had happened between himself and the Slytherin. He knew that they’d expected as much, but now that the two boys had confessed their love, Harry supposed that meant they were in a relationship? Truthfully, he didn’t know.
“Can you feel it?” Harry asked quietly.
Harry pulled Draco’s head back to kiss him once more. Their lips barely able to stay connected through heavy breaths and moans.
It’s cold here at the manor. I often fall into daydreams about us wrapping our arms around each other next to the fire.
Draco’s jaw clenched in anticipation. Harry summoned all the Gryffindor courage he could.
He brushed off Ron, Hermione and Neville and headed for a shadowy corner of the Entrance Hall to drape his Cloak over him.
Harry involuntarily sighed, his head falling back slightly.
Draco hummed into his neck, still rubbing and cupping his erection through his shorts.
Draco had reached out and offered his hand to Harry who was still sitting on the ground blushing.
Then Draco turned and locked Harry’s gaze, smiling, “Sure.”
-----------------------
“Harry, truth or dare?” Neville asked.
What an asshole that kid was. Provoking Draco just to see him be punished. Harry thought, once Voldemort was defeated, that these futile divisions between people would disperse. But, it was like Dumbledore once told him, ‘To fight, and fight again, and keep fighting, for only then could evil be kept at bay, though never quite eradicated.’
Harry’s green eyes studied Draco’s features.
“Sleep in my room,” He looked down at Harry earnestly, “Please. Frankly I don’t fancy being scared out of my wits again by your screaming.”
This wasn’t going to be a fun Sunday.
Draco frowned at him. Harry suspected the blond had thought Harry would have had many friends before Hogwarts. That was an area Harry wasn’t in the mood for talking about. So he changed it.
Ron still looked Stupefyed.
Harry sat back frowning, his heart beating extra fast, “Why? What’s wrong?”
“Please don’t tell me you’ve been in the library for five hours?” Ron asked as he turned to his girlfriend.
As Harry broke from his reverie, he suddenly remembered his pact to make an effort with the other Slytherin’s.
Ron turned, “Oh hey Gin, how’d you get in here?”
“Malfoy!” Ron said loudly, “Sit beside me mate.”
“Aand the option of mentoring the younger students in our chosen subject.” Neville said as he stuffed more greens into his mouth.
Hermione nudged Harry with that knowing look in her eyes. Harry scrambled to his feet. The three of them were the only ones left in the common room.
Harry and Ron looked at Neville sadly, then the three of them made their way down the spiralling staircase. When they neared the bottom, they saw a bunch of eighth years trying to push and shove their way through the entrance to the common room, taxed with their heavy trunks and animal cages.
Four and a half years later.
Harry spluttered a moan, awfully weak at the knees, now resting his forearm against the tiles so as to stop him from falling down.
“I want to do everything.”
“But… Why is it bad that you’re attached to Harry?” Hermione whispered.
“I’m talking to you too Harry James Potter! You’re a mess.”
His face was pale and his eyes bore an unmistakable look of worry, as if he would flee any second. Harry braced himself, and opted to return Draco’s gesture from before. As he closed his hand on Draco’s shoulder, he watched Draco’s eyes soften and slowly turn to face Harry. Once more, there was that look of curiosity, and Harry really didn’t know what to take from it. But he’d find out sooner or later. Right now, they needed to get into the Great Hall, and Harry was determined to be Draco’s anchor.
On his way up the stairs he ran into Draco, and was practically Stupefied on the spot at the sight of him. The blond wore a tight black top and an oversized white button up T-shirt over the top that was left open and hanging loosely off his shoulders. The tightness of the black top clung to his middle and Harry couldn’t take his eyes off his toned form. He wore the same black trousers that fit his legs perfectly and a black belt with a gold lettering. The pants were cropped at his ankles, with shiny black shoes. Draco’s hair was handsomely dischelleved, the same waves falling effortlessly from the top of his head. The blonds hands were in his trouser pockets as he looked down at Harry on the upper step.
And yet, Harry couldn’t help but notice Draco becoming strangely attached in return.
It had felt good, but the pleasure was fleeting, for he had received a lifetime ban from Quidditch from the toad face; Dolores Umbridge.
Harry woke with a blond head on his chest and Draco’s arm wrapped around his middle.
Harry pulled his invisibility cloak off him.
“Truth or dare?”
“Please Harry!” She squeaked. “I’m sorry I haven’t been with you! I feel awful! But Draco and I,” She looked back towards the Slytherin, “We made something for you that we think will help you feel better.”
Draco twisted out of his grasp and stood up. Harry stood too, their wands drawn.
Her brown eyes blazed as she stared at him, and Harry suddenly felt guilty.
He was still giggling with Ron and Harry before he coughed and looked at her, “Yeah?”
“Um OK. Have you ever given someone a massage before?”
Harry undid Draco’s tie and then pulled open his shirt.
“No,” Harry whined as he wrapped his arms around Draco. But the blond just kissed him softly on the cheek before he unraveled himself out of Harry’s grasp and stood up, straightened his clothes, and headed for the door.
“He needs you, Harry. Just as much as you need him. I hope you remain partners for life.”
“So you really don’t know where she’s gone?” Harry asked Ron demandingly, finally breaking the silence. The redhead was pouring over a Quidditch magazine.
“So how long are you at the Ministry for? What are they gonna do to you?”
Blazing, wet green eyes bore into grey ones.
Harry’s hands roamed up Draco’s chest, pulling his robe off of him, then roughly gripping Draco’s tie to pull the blond closer.
Draco then motioned their bodies toward one of the tiled walls. Harry was now face to face with it as Draco still stood behind him.
The journey to Hogwarts filled Harry with feelings of safety and waves of nostalgia. The picturesque views outside the window filled him with happiness. Clear skies shining over the rich greenness, glistening lakes reflecting the blue of the sky. To Harry, the landscape seemed to depict the freedom he felt inside him.
Draco gripped one hand on the pillow beside Harry’s head and the other, gripping tightly onto Harry’s hip. He was breathing heavily into Harry’s neck and Harry really did think he may be hard again in a minute.
“I should’ve followed him,” Harry was muttering to himself, “If only I’d just gone out there with him, he wouldn’t be in this mess. I should be up there now! Banging on McGonagall’s door.”
“Right well you best be off. Best of luck to all of you and please try to stay out of trouble.” Molly wished them a final farewell as the Hogwarts Express blew its final whistle of departure.
The next few days leading up to Christmas were some of Harry’s happiest. Harry and Draco simply couldn’t keep their hands off each other, and since there were barely any students in the castle over the break, they’d gotten into a habit of holding hands, pecking each other in the hallways, simply being carelessly affectionate. Ron, Hermione and Blaise had gotten used to this. Hermione would look at them adoringly, whereas Blaise and Ron’s mutual discomfort at the sight saw the two developing an unlikely friendship.
“Mental?” Ron asked.
Of course. Voldemort lived at the manor. Draco was bound to see death. With a slight pang in his heart, Harry continued plumaging through his back as he spoke.
Harry just stared at him. He was never good at hearing compliments, much less ones given at this early in the morning, and much less ones given by Draco Malfoy.
But he had to admit, having extra reason to fly was exceedingly appealing.
“What? What will you do to me?” Pansy said, smirking at him.
Hermione stood up suddenly, blocking his path, “You have got to stop pushing us away Harry! When are you going to get it into your head? We’re your friends and we’re here for you!”
“Of course,” Harry smiled. “We’ve got all the time in the world.”
Harry felt a rush of fierce anger as he saw, clear as day, that the kid had a smug look on his face, as if he’d achieved what he’d set out to do.
“Merlin,” Harry muttered to himself. Immediately trying to think of Aunt Marge and Uncle Vernon so as to rid himself of the hardness in his pants. And trying desperately not to think of Draco; gorgeous and naked hovering above him wearing only his Slytherin tie around his neck.
And then Blaise and Draco walked away, but not before Draco looked at Harry and winked. Elation swirled inside Harry.
“There’s no way we were ever that small,” Draco said as his eyes swept over the group of miniatures.
“I just feel like you guys are making all the effort,” Harry said honestly, “At least, that’s how I see it anyway.”
Harry looked back at Draco now, suddenly embarrassed that his rambling had gotten the better of him. But Draco looked back knowingly, a small smirk playing across his face.
“Harry,” Ron cut him off, “Stop. It’s alright. I’ve got you and Hermione, George doesn’t have anyone-” Harry felt his chest tighten, “-so he’ll be glad you checked up on him. Really I should be doing more for him as his brother,” he said more to himself. “But as for me, I’m fine. But thanks anyway mate.”
Harry just shrugged, “Yeah.”
Draco smiled sadly, “Yeah, and I let him.”
Then after thirty minutes, Harry stood back as Draco took over and began explaining the rules and positions of Quidditch.
“Doesn’t look like it does it.”
Draco raised his eyes in apprehension, but resolved to sit beside the redhead.
Ron paused for a moment, his intoxication obviously slowing his brain processes.
Harry tugged on his hand and motioned Draco to sit on the bed next to him.
“I’m surprised you even made it to breakfast Harry,” Hermione said.
“No,” Draco answered quickly, “He’s got enough.”
“Hey Potter. Draco,” Blaise hiccupped.
“Neville who do you choose?”
The conversation for the remainder of breakfast was polite and friendly. Harry had contributed to none of it. His head still ached and his ‘fight or flight’ kept turning on and off every time he thought he would throw up. The only human interaction he did allow himself was intermittent glances at Draco, who, whenever he caught Harry’s eye, would raise his eyebrows and shake his head smiling.
“Actually, now that we’re all here, we may as well start the feast!” McGonagall said loudly, motioning everyone to take a seat.
Harry shrugged, “Truth.”
It was Luna and Draco.
And then Harry had barely had time to blink before Draco’s walls were barricaded around him once more.
Harry folded up and the letter and enveloped it. Then he walked to the fire where the grey owl still stood looking much warmer, and attached his letter to its leg.
Lavender, Parvati and Pansy were standing behind Blaise giggling uncontrollably.
When they sat upon Draco’s bed, the blond drew the curtains concealing them from the dormitory. Then Harry finally took off his cloak and all Draco did was look at him with hunger and seduction, moving so he wrapped one arm around Harry’s waist.
“And you know what they say, jealousy, it’s just love and hate at the same time.”
Ron suddenly seemed unable to swallow his mash potatoes and scoffed profusely. Hermione rolled her eyes at him.
“Uh H-harry,” Draco moaned as he bucked his hips into Harry’s touch.
“C’mon ‘Mione, it’ll be fine,” Ron said, resting his hand on her shoulder.
“Um of course, I’ll let you know.”
“I want to see you Harry,” Draco rasped, pulling up the hem of the Slytherin T-shirt.
Harry moved back up beside him, but kept his right hand upon Draco’s boxers, cupping his erection.
“Drunk enough to admit I want you.”
“I’m fine Potter.”
He slowly pulled down Draco’s pants. When he looked up back at Draco, the blond was flushed, his hair mused, his eyes dark, and Harry didn’t think he’d seen anything more attractive.
Even though Harry had accepted her games, he would never let her walk all over him, especially not in front of everyone else.
“Well I don’t know about anyone else, but that was freaking hot,” Lavender said with raised eyebrows.
“And Malfoy listens to Muggle music!” Harry said before he could stop himself.
The next morning Harry awoke to Draco’s back flush against his chest. Harry’s head was nuzzled into the back of Draco’s neck, his arms wrapped tightly around the blond, and their fingers gently interlaced together.
Harry was sure he’d heard him wrong. He looked at Draco’s face and saw it shining truthfully against the blaze of the fire.
“Ugh God Draco, I’m going to-”
“We also have a section of the library dedicated solely to us,” Hannah said softly.
Although they trudged through the snow and had to cast repetitive Warming charms, Luna’s airy voice had proved a distraction.
Harry thought it was well worth dropping out of Hogwarts right now. There was no way he could ever overcome this humiliation. All thought of being in love with Draco completely drained from his mind, he felt like a bucket of ice had been poured over him, sobered by his embarrassment.
As Harry’s eyes swept his room, all he could see was the comforting hues of metallic red and gold. His room looked much like his own Gryffindor dorm, except there was only one bed and it was quite larger than what he had previously. A deep red, soft and puffy looking doona lay across it with four pillows looking so comfy he was tempted to fall onto them right now.
Harry stopped walking and Draco turned to look at him as they reached the end of the platform. As Harry dropped his bag and knelt to open it, Draco glanced toward the carriages heading up the path to the castle.
“You were right Draco. I am touch deprived. Hermione and Ron...they always hug me because they know, even though I’ve never really told them. But you Draco, I need you.”
Harry was grunting in pain, trying desperately to grab Draco’s wrists. When he finally did, Harry heaved himself up, pushing Draco as he did so, so that the blond now lay flat against the floor with Harry’s body straddling and hovering above him.
“It’s a little over one o’clock, shall we head to the Three Broomsticks now?”
Ron spat out his drink as the others laughed and looked between Draco and Blaise with wide eyes.
But it only took Harry one glance up to realise he had awoken in Draco Malfoy’s arms.
Draco sniffed as he crossed his arms, suddenly amused, “I’d pay to see the look on Weasel B’s face if he ever found out.”
“I’m serious. Actions have always spoken louder than words. I’d prefer to develop a friendship with Draco, rather than an exchange of apology that doesn’t get us anywhere. By coming back here, he has a chance to redeem himself right? His redemption, if he chooses to act upon it, will earn my forgiveness.”
“Last night. I had to Apparate from my house to Hogsmeade station. Then that’s where I met McGonagall and we walked up to the castle together.”
Christmas at Hogwarts was always beautiful, and Harry loved staying at the castle during the break because there were barely any students and he felt that he had the place to himself.
‘Dear Harry,
Their breakfast continued pleasantly, save for Blaise and Ron’s constant digs at Harry and Draco.
Harry, finally back in his Quidditch robes and still dealing with the waves of nostalgia he’d felt since he’d put them on, was now facing an eruption of entirely new feelings at the sight of Draco in his own emerald and silver Quidditch robes.
On Friday morning, Harry and Draco sat together in Charms. The whole class was practising all manner of nonverbal spells, whilst Professor Flitwick’s head bobbed along in between the desks checking up on each pair of students.
He absentmindedly hoped Draco would be one of those few students who stayed here over Christmas, but Harry thought better of it. He knew his mum needed him.
“Actually I just boiled a pot of tea,” Harry felt his heart sink, “When I’d got back there after dinner, a teapot, cups and saucers were all sitting on my desk.” Draco seemed to be talking to himself now, not looking at Harry, “I could swear they weren’t there before I went down to the Great Hall for dinner.”
“I know Draco. But when and … if, this is all over, then at least I have hope we could try something in the future…”
“Sleep with me. In my bed.”
“And I’d love to see them, but they’re staying for a few nights aren’t they?”
Draco shoved Harry hard at that, and he crashed into one of the nearby desks, “Don’t you dare talk about my father.”
“Yeah, you’re not lost are you Potty?” Blaise sneered.
To make Harry feel worse, he hadn’t seen Draco or Hermione since lunch time, and now it was almost 9 PM. Harry stared miserably into the fire.
A few more hours had passed in the Three Broomsticks and much to Harry’s relief, his friends' topic of conversation had switched to Quidditch and Christmas, among other things as the eighth years had swapped and switched seats as the time went on. Hermione with Luna and Ginny. Ron with Seamus and Dean.
McGonagall’s smile and morphed into a frown of confusion.
“OK so that’s settled then. Eighth year party in the eighth year common room. Lovegood, the password’s ‘spirit.’”
“Let me help.”
She looked away from him, “I’m sorry Harry! It just sort of, slipped out! Maybe I’m still a little tipsy from yesterday.”
“I don’t want anyone punishing him for anything,” Harry said loudly, his gaze boring into the pompous Pattison. “That fight in Hogsmeade was provoked. The git admitted it to me after Draco and Blaise were taken away- Wait, where is Blaise anyway? Harry frowned.
Draco rounded on him again, but before he could throw his punch, Harry grabbed the blond’s hip and thrust him against a nearby wall. Draco winced at the impact, but Harry had already dug his head into Draco’s neck, his leg coming up between Draco’s thighs as he sucked hungrily at the blond’s skin.
“Me too.”
Draco held it up so as to show the sweater that was undoubtedly Harry’s; a great big Snitch stitched on the front by none other than Mrs Weasly not two years before.
“Yes, Blaise darling? I choose dare.”
Harry’s head lent forward again to look at him. His green eyes stern and fiery, “Don’t act like you don’t feel the same way.”
Harry suddenly felt stupid. He hadn’t asked Draco any of these questions.
“Young is right Harry,” Hermione interrupted him. “Young enough to still be considered children according to some.”
Draco growled at the contact. He gripped the sides of Harry’s (Draco’s) T-shirt.
Blaise still looked furious, “Zabini. Blaise Zabini.”
Blaise, Hermione and Ron took their shot. Harry, suddenly unable to look at his best friends.
Neville flashed Harry a grateful smile.
“Actually I do mi-”
That night, Harry and Draco sat alone in the Slytherin common room. It was well after midnight. Harry’s excuse was that his bad dreams kept him awake anyway, and the adrenaline he felt around Draco kept him wide awake, so Harry readily succumbed to his self-destructive behaviour.
“So what?” said Draco finally.
“Our magic?” Draco turned, “Yeah...I’d say that’s what your so-called ‘gravitational pull’ was you were feeling before you realised you loved me,” Draco was smiling.
“You’re sure?” Draco whispered.
Already disturbingly hard, Harry didn’t know how long he’d last under Draco’s touch.
The next evening Harry had arranged to meet Draco in a classroom on the fifth floor.
“I think the two go hand in hand Harry.”
“Umbridge,” Harry said darkly.
“She’s a brave woman.”
“Whatever,” Seamus said impatiently, “I’m gonna ask Blaise anyway. More drinks the better right?” He winked at them all and then got up and left the library.
Harry couldn’t argue with that. He smiled, shaking his head before turning to the first years.
“Neville and Hannah, Herbology. Lavender and Parvati, Divination. Who on this bloody Earth would sign up for that?” Ron continued down the list, “Potions, Ernie and Blaise. Blimey!- Hermione Granger, Defence, Charms and Transfiguration. She’s mental! She should be wanting to spend time with me! How in God’s name can she teach three subjects? If she’s got another bloody time turner around her neck this year I’ll-”
The all too familiar voice hit him like a ton of bricks.
But Draco had cut him off.
Hermione, Ginny and Luna were standing together chatting politely, while Ron and Blaise stood side by side against one of the wall’s, grinning mischievously.
Harry felt his cheeks flush. But then reminded himself that he’d literally defeated the most dangerous dark wizard of all time and an interrogation of his closest friends, even if it was about Draco, was nothing.
“Was it hard to go back home Draco?” Luna asked as she twirled her fork aimlessly.
“I don’t know what to do. And now everyone knows. Even if there is something between us, I think it’s more trouble than it’s worth.”
“Stop.” He looked at Hermione. “Don’t fight. Not over my own stupidity… Merlin I’m surprised you two are even still talking to me.”
“Am I? Come back for more have you Potter?”
At this, Draco placed his hand on top of Harry’s shoulder.
Draco took off his shirt, and now Harry felt sick; his stomach was swirling with both arousal and anxiety, and once more he felt stuck helplessly between logic and irrationality.
Hermione let out a sigh and muttered to herself, “Boys.” She returned to her Prophet as Ron spoke again.
Draco looked up at Harry in confusion, obviously still coming out of his waking bliss.
Harry realised as he sat down, that he was relatively out in public despite the many Hogwarts students that adorned the pub. There were just as many adult witches and wizards as there were students and he felt the familiar sensation of being watched from all angles. He resolved to sit on a chair where his back was turned to the majority of the onlookers.
“Mate? What in the hell-” He broke off, appearing as lost as Harry felt. The redhead sighed deeply, then looked back to Harry, “Malfoy, really?”
“Uh!” Harry clasped his forehead with his hand and squeezed his eyes shut.
“Not when you’re here though,” Draco whispered.
Harry felt enlightened, like the fog that often swirled around in his mind suddenly cleared.
Lavender and Parvati giggled, and Dean and Seamus smirked. Ron sighed as if to say ‘I’ve got no choice but to go along with this.’ But thankfully, Hermione came to the rescue once again.
“Oo she’s keen,” Blaise winked at her. “I dare you to give MacMillan a hickey.”
Hermione shrugged, looking shy.
They lay next to each other trying to catch their breaths. Their various drinks spilled all over their clothes.
Harry then found himself getting up off the bed, staring at the wall keeping his back to Draco.
Slowly, Draco shifted closer to Harry and leaned in, closing the gap between them.
Harry clung at his T-shirt, as if he was afraid Draco would let go.
Harry, feeling waves of relief and happiness wash over him, simply said, “I did.”
Ron’s hair was mused, a dazed, sleepy look on his face. As he looked to Neville he said, “Blimey Neville what’s got your knickers in a twist?”
It was McGonagall. It was very dark but she was standing on the top most stone step outside the oak doors that lead into the Entrance Hall. Golden light from inside the castle illuminating her figure.
“They, they didn’t...” Harry’s voice was strained and hoarse, “they didn’t love me.”
I didn’t want to defend myself for fear of getting into more trouble, but then I heard my mysterious attacker yell Crucio, so I cast a protective charm but of course that knocked the tosser off his feet.
The initial excitement for the eighth year return had definitely subsided, and most evenings in the common room were subdued, the only sounds coming from the scratches of quills on parchment, the turning pages of books, and Ron’s whispers of intermitted swearing as he tried to complete his abundance of essays.
Then Harry swiftly cupped the blond’s neck and used his other hand to grip his hair, pulling Draco’s head back and crashing their lips together.
It was slow and tentative, Draco’s hand still gently cupping Harry’s jaw.
“Ron that’s enough,” Hermione hissed, her eyes blazing.
Harry looked up to see Draco looking fondly at the thestrals.
“I...I did this to you.”
Draco nodded.
Harry only grinding into him a few times before his head fell onto Draco’s shoulder as he shuddered. Merlin he’d been grinding for mere seconds.
Harry’s heart hammered in his chest as he looked earnestly into Draco’s eyes.
“Given up yet Potter?” Draco said, smirking challengingly down at Harry.
“HARRY!”
Before his hazy brain could catch up with reality, Ron and Seamus had also stood up next to him on the couch, the three of them wrapping their arms around each other’s shoulders and singing absurdly loud.
Her warm, wrinkled face broke into a smile, “I am very proud of you all. I never thought I’d see the day that Miss Granger and Miss Parkinson sat together pouring over a book, much less Potter and Mr Malfoy sitting not one meter apart from one another.”
“I dare you to chug the rest of the bottle of Firewhisky in front of you.”
Seamus broke the silence first as he moved toward the entrance to the twin spiral staircases. “Well, I dunno know about the rest of you but I’m keen to see my room.”
Harry smiled and nodded in agreement.
“Well good morning to you too,” Ron said sourly.
“Harry.”
But now it was if they’d reached a place that went further than physicality. They had only exchanged a few words, but Harry knew he and Draco had finally penetrated the unspoken truth that lingered between them for so long. And they had both admitted toward the mess they’d created, and yet here Harry lay, beside Draco Malfoy, wrapped in his arms, falling into a surprisingly peaceful and undisturbed sleep.
Hermione looked affronted, about to protest, but Harry cut her off.
It was waking bliss; not yet burdened by the dealings of the day ahead, and uninhibited by their semi alertness. They simply just revelled in each other’s touch and let the moment flow.
Harry took Draco’s hand and Draco pulled him up.
He watched as Draco’s eyes widened. Realising that it was his wand lying in his hands.
At once all of the first years began yelling various tones of ‘up’ and Harry and Draco could only look upon them and suppress their laughter. Harry had to admit they were quite cute, but their struggle really was quite humorous.
Draco laughed at his rambling, “I’m sure that can happen when you switch between the wizarding and the muggle world.”
Harry spluttered, elation filling his insides.
Hermione appeared behind them, flustered with a pile of books in her hands.
“Well put Harry.” Hermione said, then she was up on her feet, pulling Ron up from the floor.
-----------------------
Harry gripped Draco’s sweater as the blond’s tongue entered Harry’s mouth, only just realising that Draco had slept in his clothes from the day before.
“Oh dear God,” Draco mumbled into his butterbeer.
Harry reached under the table and squeezed his thigh in reassurance.
Harry scratched the back of his neck, “Look, I’ll tell you both… When I’m ready, OK?”
“Harry,” Draco took his hand, “Look at me.”
“Nice to meet you,” Draco murmured, his face cold as he took the man’s pudgy hand.
“'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
Harry swiftly pulled the shirt off over his head and Draco’s hands were suddenly everywhere over Harry’s tanned torso and chest.
Harry had no idea what was happening. He felt confused, stupefied, dazed and ludicrously aroused all at once, and after a moment of standing stock still with Draco’s warm lips on his, he actually found himself melting into the kiss. His hand reaching up and gripping Draco’s robes.
“D-draco…” Harry rasped, “I love the way your body feels.”
They stared intensely at each other for a moment, Harry’s heart thumping in his chest, but then he saw Draco bite his lower lip to stifle his grin.
“You’re so strong Ron.”
“Come on,” Draco said.
Harry inwardly cursed, all too aware that Ginny sat across from him. He stared at his plate, feeling Draco’s own mortification radiate off his body.
“Draco?”
“Sure,” Blaise said. And sure enough he’d pulled Draco into his lap, gripped the blond's hair and dug his tongue deep into his mouth.
Draco and Harry instantly broke away.
Pansy raised her eyebrows, “Merlin help us. Never thought I’d see the day where Weasel B approved of Potter and Draco’s-” She lifted her fingers to imitate quotation marks, “‘friendship.’”
“Make out with Malfoy.”
Draco groaned seductively into Harry’s mouth, “Yes…  Potter.”
‘Dear Harry,
“It’s a little better. That’s why I came out here, for fresh air.”
“I told you! We were just talking and we fell asleep.”
Harry shook his head in frustration then continued to climb the stairs, ignoring him.
Harry shifted up a little on top of Draco, wanting to assert his dominance, and Draco practically revelled in it, arching up and thrusting his body into Harrys.
“No. She says being here is the best thing for me. Besides, Aunt Andromeda and Teddy will be with her on Christmas.”

“You’re thinking Harry,” Luna’s voice trailed back to him. “You do that a lot.”
They stood like that for a long time. Harry patiently waiting for Draco to speak first, not wanting to push him.
“I was-”
“Woah, what’s the hurry Neville?”
Harry had only time for one startled gasp before Draco had connected their lips, his soft palm coming up to cup Harry’s neck.
“Alright Potter?” He said as he clapped him on the shoulder, “Cat got your tongue?”
“Aye,” Harry reached over Ginny to punch Neville on the shoulder, “That sword came to you didn’t it?”
In Harry’s embarrassed haste, he actually tumbled and fell to the ground. The laughter around him only intensified, and he found himself laughing as well.
“I- er,” Harry swallowed, “Yes I have. Actually I think about it quite a lot.”
Harry felt his heart thumping in his chest, suddenly feeling more awake than he had done the whole night.
Now it was the mid December, and Harry’s already tumultuously burdened year had become even more strenuous.
Draco continued to stare at the fire. Feeling Harry’s eyes on him, he turned to look the other way.
“Brilliant! If they’re any help tell me. I’ve read a few, but none have sparked any inspiration for me yet.”
Harry spluttered again, “Approval of what exactly?!”
“I think there’s a few of us here who’ve developed more than a friendship,” Pansy said smirking and flashing her eyes at Harry.
“OI! STOP IT!” “BREAK IT UP! GET OFF HIM!”
Draco looked positively affronted. He shoved his friend toward the door of their common room.
“But… We have a lifetime to do that.”
“I’ll see you later Potter.”
Draco looked up. His face didn’t portray shock but merely surprise. The blonde swallowed and Harry watched as Draco’s eyes lingered on Harry’s face, they seemed to skim over his features before he looked up again to Harry’s eyes.
“Oh God Harry,” Hermione cringed.
Harry looked at Draco beside him, who was looking across the table at Hermione with a mixture of gratitude and guilt, as if Draco believed he didn’t deserve her kindness.
“Thomas of course,” Draco shrugged and looked back at the fire.
“Touch me Draco... please.”
Ron gaped her.
Harry then saw what Draco held in his gripped hand.
Draco stared at him. Then slowly ran the hand that was over Harry’s heart, up Harry’s chest.
“But it’s not any longer?”
“So did you have a good first day?” Harry asked after a time.
When all the first years had left the pitch and headed back up to the castle, Harry and Draco were stacking the brooms back up in the broom shed.
Draco nodded. Harry took a breath.
“What Harry?”
Draco looked up again and resumed kissing Harry’s neck.
Draco had written to Harry telling him the owl was named Teddy, after Tonks and Remus's son. He’d explained to Harry that his mother and Andromeda had reconnected and were rekindling their previously estranged relationship, and that Teddy often came along with Andromeda to the manor for afternoon tea or brunch.
“Blaise is staying?”
Having not yet released, and sitting amongst the darkness of the eerie yet beautiful common room, Harry was dizzy with desire, and he could tell Draco was too.
The room itself wasn’t oversized, it felt like the perfect space for a party of their number.
I had old Sir Pattison beside me but as you could guess, the cowardly git just ran for his life.
Draco.’
Sighing as he lifted his head, Harry looked at Draco through sleepy eyes, “Are you sure you’re not a Legilimens?”
Harry didn’t want to return to the castle straight away, so he set off around the lake. The autumn air was still and crisp, and the sky was totally blue, reflecting pristinely upon the Great Lake. He looked back up at the castle, admiring its beauty and feeling that same rush of gratitude at the fact that he got to call this place home.
She breathed deeply, before looking at him seriously.
Blaise and Draco threw back their shots, but as their glasses automatically refilled, their faces contorted at the sight of Harry and Ron throwing back their shots as well.
“Wow! So you played Harry then?”
They broke apart. Draco’s hair now a little dischelleved which did not help Harry’s predicament in his pants. The boy looked heavenly.
“Oh please,” Hermione said, her face twisting in disgust, “You’re more powerful than that old sod.”
“And me?! I look handsome too ‘Mione.”
“Slytherins are renowned for making up rumours. And then after a time they die down and are forgotten about,” The blond’s face contorted into a smirk, “I’d think of all people, you’d know that Potter.”
“You were right,” Draco said.
She exhaled, “I had a feeling Harry.”
“What about you Draco?” Luna asked.
“You’re gonna pay for what you did.”
“All right there Harry?”
Draco then brought Harry’s hand up to his lips and kissed over the scars softly. Harry watched, mesmerized. But no sooner had Draco’s lips left Harry’s hand had the blonds eyebrows begun to form a frown. He stared off blankly at the wall, lost in thought.
As they settled themselves into Draco’s oversized armchair, both with cups of warm tea in their hands, Harry saw the faint trickle of rain fall outside the windows. He felt indescribably calm. The aesthetic of Draco’s bedroom that reflected the boy in every way, the warmth of the fire in front of them and from the tea in his hands, the sound of soft rain against the windows, Harry didn’t think he could ever be so blissful. And to top it off, Draco was sitting peacefully beside him, looking calmly into the fire.
“Harry.” A calming and raspy voice sounded from behind him.
“Draco I...I’ve felt this way for a long time, but, the way my life has been for the past seven years, I guess I...I just never had the chance to decipher what those feelings meant.”
“I’m sorry Draco, but do you not remember me getting caught in your room and the entire school and most likely the whole wizarding world finding out about it?”
The whole sensation of their wet bodies as the water poured down on them, the fog continuously encompassing them, and the way Draco turned Harry on so fiercely, was too much for his brain to comprehend.
The blond had released their cocks and gripped his sticky hand onto Harry’s hip pushing him up against the wall, before he softly reconnected their lips in a purposeful and elated kiss.
He faintly heard Neville’s voice behind him, “Honestly at this point I just go with it. Harry’s mind works on it’s own agenda.”
“You love me Draco. I know you do.”
Harry felt himself smirking, “Merlin, be careful or I’ll be hard again in five minutes.”
After the blond had returned from the bathroom dressed in a loose green T-shirt, silk pyjama pants and black socks, Harry was already lying on Draco’s bed stripped down to his boxers and a T-shirt staring up at the ceiling, his hand under his head.
“Don’t push your luck Potter.”
Draco sighed into Harry’s neck and Harry could feel just how exhausted he was.
He couldn’t wipe the grin off his face, his elation at the reality that Draco would be returning today left him feeling light and giddy, like he could float up into the air.
Seamus cleared his throat, then said clearly, “I want to go to the legal age eighth year party.”
Harry felt exposed, as he usually did when the half moon spectacles studied him.
Gasps flew around the circle.
“Finally!”
As Draco cast a wordless Cleaning charm over the two of them, Harry felt Draco’s erection still as hard as ever beneath him.
“Yes, but we’re both just so,” Harry spluttered, trying to find words.
That same feeling Harry felt seven years back when he’d met Ron on the Hogwarts Express, seemed to be swelling in him again. He was at a loss for words. The reaction he felt from Draco’s praise matched that only of the compliments he’d received from Sirius or Dumbledore. He felt his throat dry up and his eyes sting for release.
“Yeah? Is that a problem Potter?” Blaise suddenly asked from two seats away.
As he did so, Draco slowly began to grind against Harry, causing the brunette to throw his head back in pleasure, growling.
Harry bit down into the boy’s shoulder, that raspy voice was all he needed to reach his climax.
Harry snorted, Blaise snickered, Draco looked down at his plate so as to hide his smile. Hermione however, suddenly breaking out of her astonishment, simply rolled her eyes.
Draco groaned at the contact. His grey eyes fluttering closed.
“It’s fine Harry. I’ll see you down at breakfast.”
Draco smirked, “Will you now?”
Draco however, seemed to be studying Harry, his grey eyes travelling over the brunette’s features.
Harry felt his mind go into overdrive again.
Harry still sat atop him, looking thoroughly put out as Draco had propped himself up on his elbows, a smug look plastered on his face.
Hagrid had brought in his usual twelve Christmas trees that stood proudly decorated along the walls of the Great Hall.
“Well, yes… We can’t be together, not openly.”
The sound of Draco’s sexy rasping voice moaning Harry’s name, the mere sight of him coming into Harry’s hand, Harry had never been so turned on.
“Ahh simpler times,” Neville said.
It seemed that all eyes were upon Harry, Draco and this mysterious young man who stood before them. He saw, out of the corner of his eye, that Hermione and Ron had slowly stood as well, their hands clasped at their wands by their sides.
It was close to midnight and he’d just left his dorm with the invisibility cloak draped over him, that was until his feet lost their balance at the sight of Ron and Hermione sitting by the now dying fire in their common room.
“Wormtail, the man said he needs pencil and paper,” Riddle said with a touch of impatience. “Don’t just stand there looking like an idiot.”
He almost had it. It was meditative, to work like this: puzzling over a mystery that required all of Draco’s intelligence. Solving it almost divorced himself from the reality of why he was doing it, why he was here. Draco could almost – almost – forget that there were guns pointed at his back. Literally.
“Revelio.” The spell on the figure began to fade, and a faint glimmer around him shone before disappearing. Potter knelt beside the man and removed his hood.
“I’m right here,” I said, cutting off Granger’s response. I was touched – and more than a little irritated – at Potter’s protectiveness. The irritation won out. “And I think you forget who I am. I’m not just some squishy academic; I’ve practical experience in the Dark Arts too.” Both Potter and Granger flushed at that.
“Do you work for the military or for the police?” Draco asked. He recognized the source of their aura now. Some of Harry’s superiors that Draco had met before carried themselves like that, as well as the Scotland Yard men who had questioned Draco in the course of his father’s investigation.
“First of all, they are not junk.” Draco glared at Harry. “And secondly, the Shield should be round, with ornate engravings.”
“She was worried about you. She hadn’t heard about you in a long time, and she became concerned at the rumors.”
“Well, it’s a very old magical site, steeped in lore,” I said, settling into a chair, trying to shake the sense of vertigo. “West Country especially is a region heavily associated with wizards and magic. Glastonbury Tor is there, Stonehenge …. There’s a reason why my family settled there, too. And yours. And a large number of magical families.”
“No, I’m fine,” Draco said, rubbing his head. He was in the middle of an airbase in Afghanistan with the ex-boyfriend who abandoned him when Draco needed comfort the most. No amount of medication or caffeine can fix his level of discomfort.
A corner of his mouth quirked. “Hello to you too.” Then, remembering himself, he pushed his office door open. “After you.”
They changed into the jumpsuits Harry had ready in the back of the car. Draco examined himself critically, trying to affect how a janitor would appear.
He was much too sharp, Draco thought. “I’m consulting for a side project,” he said. “With Harry’s employer.” That was all true, as a matter of fact.
Harry sat propped up by pillows, dressed in his pajamas. He was pale and his face was thinner than before, but he looked well otherwise.
“Commander Potter here was attacked by one such weapon two nights ago,” Malfoy continued. “We were wondering –”
I didn’t wait for him to cast another spell, aiming a Body-binding hex directly to his chest. The jet of light bounced uselessly off his Shield and hit the ceiling in a shower of sparks.
Goyle burst out into laughter. “Really? Try multiplying that by a hundred and you might have a better sense of the population down here.”
“Let’s not get too hasty,” Shacklebolt interrupted. “After all, they did help. And we can’t have the public getting wind of this, can we? Or otherwise we wouldn’t be called the Secret Service. These two have managed to take down one of our top targets, and all in a night’s work.”
“They came to meet us here, at the manor. I still remember it clearly. They had on robes that covered their entire faces so we would not be able to identify them and concealment spells that hid their voices and other identifiers.
“Yes….” Harry frowned at Draco censoriously. “We need to work on that.”
He watches them sleep, their faces so peaceful in repose. The stench of sweat and sex fill the room, and Cross cannot help but wrinkle his nose.
Shit. It was indeed. It was the man who had narrowly missed being eviscerated by the drug runner’s shot. Britannian Minister Cornelius Fudge, a portly man who often appeared on the news, touting his administrations’ achievements, particularly with the suppression of crimes and the unrest in the Underground.
All those paled in importance to the objects at the center of the room. The Shield and the Decoder laid side by side, placed casually, almost like they had been tossed aside by a bored child.
“Thank Merlin,” my father said. “Though I would rather her than what you’ve been doing now. Merlin knows what you’re up to in London.”
There was also the death of a Muggle man in a small village in Somerset that had not made Wizarding news. I only knew of it because I had caught a glimpse of the headline screaming about the goriness of it on some Sunday tabloid.
Granger turned her full attention on me. “Draco!” She came up to me, looked me up and down with worry and sympathy. “Are you alright? Are you hurt?”
Draco waved to Harry excitedly. Harry swam over, peering curiously at the device in his hand. Draco couldn’t see Harry’s face, but from the suppressed movements, Harry was just as enthusiastic about the find as Draco was.
“Yes, don’t you have a fan club?” I laughed. “I can just imagine a troupe of middle-aged women camped outside your office, waiting to catch a glimpse of you.”
“Those policies ensure equal justice for everyone, including those who were victims of the War,” Potter said, his words calm, but every bit defying my father. “They ensure that those who have an opportunity and the desire to repent receive it.”
“You’re damn right I won’t,” Harry said, his own wand raised even higher. “You murderous bastard.”
Dolohov was on a water sled next to their boat, with a gun resting casually within his reach. A dark haired woman rode on another next to him, her gaunt face and haunted eyes watching them with calculating coolness.
“Yes. Beyond that.”
“Because you outnumber me and I don’t think that one,” Draco gestured at Bellatrix with his chin, “is as foolish as you.”
When he had woken up, everything had changed. Harry supposed he should thank modern medicine for its efficacy. Sometimes, however, he wondered this new lease on life was truly a blessing.
Working with it … another curious phrase he was using. “Don’t you mean reading it?”
“What’s this?” Greyback licked his teeth. “What do you want, Potter?”
“Right. A round shield.” Harry looked around dubiously. “That’ll stand out.”
Greyback had backhanded Harry viciously. Draco spasmed, stopped as the Afghan man turned his gun on Draco.
And almost dropped it.
“I’m not leaving without you,” Harry said, his face stony. “Let him go, Cross.”
“Are you alright?” Harry asked.
Draco could see the other Harry, the side which Draco only encountered once before, coming out. It was that of the solider, the Royal Marine, the man who had saved his life when he had been caught in an ambush by Iraqi insurgents five years ago. It was hard to reconcile that with the man Draco laughed and made love with, the one who left his dirty socks around, the one who had held Draco in his arms just last night.
He was lucky my mother was watching, or I’d have tossed the roasted potatoes on my plate at him. Root indeed.
I concentrated, pushing past discomfort and my inhibitions – and entered his memories.
They’re all dead, Hedwig said. Everyone who was involved in this project. By the way, the name of the project is called Hallows.
I glowered at her. “Well, I’m fairly certain it was a man. Though I don’t have any evidence to back that up. He had his hood up the entire time and there was a concealment spell masking his voice. He was powerful, though; I could feel it.”
The man looked up — and looked at me. I tried to turn away. But I could not.
“It’s the thought that counts,” I said. I was met with stunned silence. “What?”
“In the Illiad, Homer tells how the gods gifted Achilles new armor after his lover, Patroclus, lost Achilles’ first set when Patroclus was killed by Hector. This includes a magnificent shield.” Draco tried to recall the exact lines. “‘Then he first made a shield, broad and solid, adorning it skillfully everywhere, and setting round it a glittering triple rim, with a silver strap attached. Five layers it had, and he decorated it with subtle art.’ And then the poem goes on to describe the shield. From the center, it depicts the entirety of Greek life, from the workings of Heavens to the workings of the plow.”
He touched it. The weeds encrusting it came off.
Potter was sitting close enough that I could make out the individual lashes. He was unshaven, with a slight hint of stubble, and his tongue, flat and pink, peeked out of his mouth. He looked at me, his eyes a bright green that called to mind summer fields in the sun, and I moved in nearer to him …. I licked my own lips … our noses were almost touching ….
Draco had set up the children’s area so that the kids would have enough space to sit on the carpet, but also be close enough to the reading chair — a rickety old rocking chair from the back storage area he had given a bit of a magical touch-up — that they could see the book.
Just then, Albus Potter surprised the pair by crashing headlong into them, earning a heavy grunt from Draco, who had essentially taken a head-butt directly to his liver.
The tattoo Draco had received at 16 – a skull with a snake for a tongue – now looked entirely different than it had when Harry had known Draco in their youth. It was surrounded by a garden’s-worth of colourful flowers: gladiolus, carnations, orchids, aster, peonies, amaryllis, daffodils, lilies and iris, with a beautiful narcissus for his mother, and a single gardenia for Scorpius. The original tattoo was still visible, as a way for Draco to remember the past to which he never wanted to return, but the flowers were a daily reminder that he had grown and changed, and had built a beautiful and happy life for Scorpius and himself.
Scorpius attended the same small school his father had, so if all the kids his age were attending this party, it was more than likely that Draco would know some of the other parents. He hadn’t been particularly well liked in his time as a student, but he had grown up to become a successful business owner, and had redeemed himself in the eyes of most of his old classmates.
if they’re single!”
“Well, I didn’t really want to talk about it back then,” Harry said with a shrug. He didn’t seem particularly interested in discussing it now, either. “Anyway, a lot of the kids who I work with are in similar positions, where they live in foster care homes, or with relatives other than their parents and  don’t have the support and guidance they need to help keep them on track in school, or to keep them off the streets and out of gangs. Because I’ve had experience with that sort of thing, the boys find it easier to trust me and are willing to actually work at their lessons.”
Scorpius’ accident had also served as the final straw for Draco in regard to his marriage. Astoria always seemed too busy with her own life and interests (those of a wealthy socialite) to pay attention to the wellbeing of her husband and child. When Draco had served her divorce papers she was more than happy to give him primary custody of their son in exchange for visits every other weekend, and he was more than happy to raise his son without her negative influence.
The party had been a beautiful disaster, and the perfect way for Harry and Draco to start things over again.
“Erm—well, I suppose business has been good,” Draco said, considering what he might share about his company. “As Scorpius might have said, my company manufactures pharmaceutical products. When one of the large pharmaceutical companies puts out a new medication, they usually hold a patent on that product for 10 to 20 years, and can therefore determine the cost to consumers. Our company researches, tests, and manufactures generic versions of those medications after their patents expire so that they are available at a more reasonable cost to consumers, which is important because some of these medications are life-saving for the people who take them.”
“Oh, I wouldn’t be so sure of yourself,” she warned, quirking an eyebrow at her friend in challenge. “It takes good communication and teamwork to win the balloon toss.” Draco wasn’t fooled into competing, because he had brought his brain along to the party today, but Harry was instantly up in arms at the insinuation that he wouldn’t be able to show up a bunch of 8-year-olds in a simple game of catch.
Three turns later, the pair sat on the edge of the deck, glowering straight ahead and watching the line of children as they continued the game. Harry’s vest top was wet and Draco was refusing to talk to him. Albus and Scorpius were doing fancy through-the-legs and overhand tosses, going so far as to include spins in their little routine. They looked as though they might be the winners of the game.
“Right,” Draco said. “Children will arrive in about 15 minutes, and I’ll come out and introduce you to the children when it’s time for you to start.”
“Are you planning to swim today?” Harry asked, watching as Scorpius and Albus took turns doing cannonballs off the low diving board.
“Teddy, would you mind supervising the pool, please?” Harry called across the way. A young man with teal hair was stretched out on a lounger on the other side of the pool, but at the sound of Harry’s voice, he tossed a thumbs-up in their direction and took his place at the edge of the pool, scanning the water dutifully.
Draco yelped as a sudden gush of frigid water exploded on the back of his neck. It dribbled down his back, soaking the light blue button-up tee he had purchased just for this occasion. He turned around slowly to find an unamused Scorpius, who presented his father with the plastic shreds of a water balloon.
it,” Scorpius said, rolling his eyes while his father’s back was turned. “I just don’t do it very often; Mother’s pool is always much too cold.”
“It’s no problem, really,” Harry assured him, giving Draco’s shoulder a firm squeeze. “Albie is more than happy to share. The kid’s probably got more swimwear than he knows what to do with. He’s got whatever Gin’s bought him, plus James’ hand-me-downs. Proper spoilt, these kids are.”
* * * * *
.” Malfoy’s snarky tone told Harry exactly where Draco thought his ex-wife’s friends could stick their hoity-toity attitudes.
“Since my friend invited me,” Scorpius shrugged, taking a momentary break from his homework. “Mother said she could drop me off after physical therapy, but it’s technically on your weekend, so it’s your decision.”
“Actually, you told me that,” Harry corrected. “I agreed to no such thing.”
The pair stood at the poolside and made small talk, both scanning the water to ensure the safety of the kids sloshing water in each other’s faces. Draco recognized two dark, curly-haired children that must be Ron and Hermione’s, as well as a few of Scorpius’ classmates.
“Those sunnies aren’t going to do you much good up there, Potter,” Draco commented before he could stop himself. Harry looked up from the barbecue where he was flipping hamburgers, and a bright smile lit up his face.
“Even more reason for me to come, then,” Draco insisted. “Your friends might not think it’s ‘cool’ if I’m there, but I’d feel much more comfortable if I were able to keep an eye on you.”
“I’m sure those boys appreciate that you make time for them,” Draco opined, reminiscing to his own relationships with male role models in his teen years. “I had my father and Uncle Severus, of course, but I would have killed to have someone to that cared about me like that when I was in school. I—” Draco paused to debate whether his next words would be received well or not. Historically, Potter hadn’t been particularly receptive to Draco’s sympathy. “I’m sorry you didn’t get that chance, Potter.”
The first game was played in two teams, with each team lined up in front of an empty (but clean) rubbish bin filled with water. The person at the front of the line had to dunk a large sponge into the bin, soak up as much water as possible, and then pass it through their legs to the person behind them. That person would pass it over their head to the next person, who then passed through their legs, and so on and so on. When the sopping sponge reached the last person in the line, it was to be squeezed out into an empty bucket, and then run back to the front of the line for the next round. The winners would be the team that filled their empty bucket first.
“Everything is a mess,” the woman said fretfully, “two people have called in sick today, and the library pages we’ve hired for the summer haven’t yet finished their orientation!”
“That does sound like a problem,” Draco agreed, unlocking his office door. Instead of leaving, Maria loitered in his doorway and continued to explain the issue.
If Draco was being honest, he had thought once or twice about the possibility that Potter or his children might be at this party. They attended the same school as Scorpius and presumably lived somewhere within or just outside of town. Scorpius had made friends with young Albus Potter, who was in his class. It never occurred to Draco, however, that Potter might be the one
wake up before noon?” He asked, scowling. “Honestly, Potter, it’s as if you have nothing better to do than sleep.”
Draco was silent for a moment, thinking over the events from the previous evening until now. “Did you ask the barista to curse me?” He asked.
“Does it have anything to do with rhinestones?” Harry wondered, pointing at the single pink sparkle stuck to the sleeve of Draco’s cardigan. “Pink is a lovely colour on you, you know.”
“Frequently,” Draco conceded, rolling his eyes, “But I have
He arrived at the library where he worked fifteen minutes early, as he did every day. He passed the circulation desk and made for his office, but just as he dipped his hand into his pocket to find his keys, the head librarian came hurrying up to him.
“And is this a date?” Draco inquired, ignoring the leaping sensation in his stomach.
to try swimming.”
card, because it had come back to bite him in the arse in the past.
“I want him to be able to have fun with other kids, but I have to admit, I really didn’t want him to come today,” Draco told his companion. “He said it wasn’t cool of me to insist on coming along, but I knew if I just sat around at home, I would have gone insane with worry. His arm gets funny sometimes, and he can’t predict when it will be fine or when it won’t…” He trailed off, realizing that his heart was starting to race at the very thought of his son’s arm seizing up in the water.
“Sorry about that, Malfoy,” Harry murmured, appearing at Draco’s shoulder with a green bottle, chilled and dripping with condensation. “Al’s got too much energy today for some reason, but I hope he’ll wear himself out in the pool. He could use a good night’s sleep, that one.”
“It was a long time coming,” Harry said, waving him off as he pulled open the door of the fridge. “Once the kids were old enough, we were able to agree that we both deserved a chance to be ourselves, even if we couldn’t do that together. Papers were finalized about six months ago, but we’ve been living separately for nearly two years.”
There was no response for a full minute. Draco leaned his head against the doorframe and sighed for what must have been the hundredth time that day, and it was barely past noon, for snakes’ sake. Eventually, though, a pair of socked feet padded across the hardwood floor of the room, and the door opened just enough for one bright blue eye to peer out into the hall.
had been their motto as of late.
After dinner was over and everyone had left, Harry and Draco stood on the deck and surveyed the damage done to the back garden. Water balloon shrapnel was scattered everywhere, a rainbow film of soap mingled with the pool water, and four exhausted children – one blond, two brunettes, and a redhead – were asleep with their arms and legs sprawled out starfish-style on the only dry patch of grass.
“Papa, don’t call me that here,” Scorpius scolded his father, trying but failing to wrestle his way out of Draco’s firm hold. “It’s embarrassing. And yes to the sun cream – Al’s brother has gone to grab some, I think.”
“Well, you might not know, but I was raised by my aunt and uncle after my parents died,” Harry explained, taking a deep breath as he thought back on his dour childhood, “And that I had a rough go of things in my teen years. I was angry all the time about…everything, I guess, and I had some run-ins with police on several occasions, usually because I got into fights with kids from the state schools around where I lived.”
“Boys, I would leave now, if I were you,” Draco suggested, glancing between his son and Potters. The boys both let out a screech of laughter before tearing off across the yard, nearly knocking over a number of Albus’ young cousins along the way.
“Bet you £5 she asked the custodian to sub in before she asked you,” Harry snorted.
“Right.”
“Bloody fucking— she had
this pool party.
” Draco inquired, raising an eyebrow as he took in the boy’s bright pink cheeks, and the subtle freckles smattered across the bridge of his nose. “Someone needs to put on his sun cream, hmm?”
“Good for you,” the dark-haired man said, smiling sincerely. “You always were top of our class in chemistry, so it only makes sense that you chose to work in that field.”
“I’m almost certain she did,” Draco agreed. “I don’t understand what she was thinking, though. I’m responsible for purchasing and data entry; I wasn’t hired to sit around and play dolls with children.”
“In a nutshell, yes,” Draco said stiffly. “I realize that it’s a big ask—”
“I think we’ll sit this one out, Hermione,” Harry chuckled, boldly assuming that he and Draco were sure to win the game just because they were adults.
If there was one thing Draco hated, it was being indebted to people. His father had taught him that to owe someone a favour was dangerous, especially when that someone was important, and Draco had seen first-hand the consequences of refusing to pay back what was owed. Yet despite his pleading, none of his other colleagues were willing or able to take over for him. (Secretly, he thought some of them might be saying no just to take the piss.) He wracked his brain, trying to come up with a solution that didn’t end with a group of crying children, or with him covered in glitter.
“You’re insufferable,” Draco told him.
“Malfoy! Glad you could make it out,” he greeted him, setting down his metal spatula to shake Draco’s hand. “Albie was really hoping Scorpius would be able to come today. He should be here any minute now, I’m sure – when he was over earlier in the week, he mentioned that Astoria would drop him off after his appointment. Welcome here.”
“I see,” Harry hummed. “So, uh, are you asking for moral support, or…”
“I hadn’t realized that you and Weas—Ginevra,” Draco corrected, “Had separated. I’m sorry to hear that.”
“You’re a bloody good dad,” Harry said, scooping up Draco’s hand with his own and twining their fingers together. “Scorp talks about you all the time, and it’s clear he adores you.”
“Maria, is everything all right?” Draco asked in feigned concern.
When Harry strode through the sliding glass doors, dressed in a clean pair of jeans and a button-up shirt with the sleeves rolled to his elbows, Draco nearly fell over.
As one might imagine, the mercurial nature of Scorpius’ arms and the memory of his near-drowning set Draco on edge at the thought of sending his son off to a pool party. Even just
“Absolutely not,” Draco sniffed, lying through his teeth.
“He will be,” Harry assured Draco, tapping his finger against the ink wrapped around the blond man’s forearm. “This says it all.”
* * * * *
It was certainly not his style; the flat he and Scorpius lived in was minimalist and modern, with sleek furniture and shiny chrome appliances. Potter’s house was bursting with colour and texture, featuring bright walls and eclectic decor. Draco found comfort in the peace and order of his home, but could also see the merit in a warm, cozy space where children could play without fear of breaking things or making a mess. He understood now why Scorpius preferred hanging out at Albus’ after school instead of at their flat.
The other line went silent for a full 10 seconds.
“Scorpius and I live in a flat,” Draco said by way of explanation. “It’s just the two of us, and we have no need for all that space. My father may not agree with the choices I’ve made, but I have Scorpius’ wellbeing to consider. I’m raising him to be humble and kind and respectful in all the ways I never was.”
“I can understand why this would make you nervous,” Harry said, setting a comforting hand against Draco’s shoulder blade. “Lily had to get stitches in her foot once, and I almost passed out, so I can’t even imagine how scared you must have been for Scorp.”
“GROSS!” Albus and Scorpius yelled, diving off the men’s shoulders to get away from the display of affection. Once they were free of their sons, Harry attached himself like a leach to Draco’s back and looped his legs around the taller man’s waist, insisting that he be taken for a piggy back ride around the perimeter of the pool at least twice.
Eight years prior, on a family trip to the south of France, Astoria had been in charge of watching 4-year-old Scorpius splash around in the sea while Draco was setting up their picnic lunch at a nearby table. His (now ex-) wife had insisted that she’d “turned away for just a moment”. However long Astoria had been distracted, it was long enough for a large wave to knock Scorpius over and suck him out into water far too deep and rough for a child to swim in safely.
“I think what you meant was, ‘Hello, Harry, don’t you look nice today,’” Harry corrected with an amused smirk. He stepped in close and pressed a single chaste kiss Draco’s pale cheek.
“It’s no problem,” Draco promised, taking a sip of the beer he’d been given. “I’ve had far worse.”
On a Saturday afternoon before the last week of school for the year, Draco Malfoy and his only son were sat in the kitchen of their flat, each absorbed in their own task. As he set his teacup down on the counter, a colourful piece of cardstock tucked beneath the bills he had yet to file caught his attention. He grabbed the corner of the paper and pulled it out, tilting his head back so as to read the small print through the readers perched on the end of his nose.
“I’m sorry,” the head librarian said firmly “but if we can’t find anyone else, you’re going to have to do it. I’ll send you an email with the times and instructions.” And with that, Maria left Draco to his own devices.
“Yep.”
Draco gave Harry the address of the library before hanging up, his head spinning with a mix of disbelief, relief, and plain confusion. He floated through the rest of the morning without comprehending much; he informed Maria via email that he had found someone to assist with the story time, inhaled his lunch without tasting it, and went to stand near the library doors 15 minutes early to receive Harry. He was so still that an elderly patron commented to her friend as they passed by him that she’d never seen a mannequin at a library before.
Draco crossed the room to where their calendar hung on the wall and had a look at their plans for that weekend. Scorpius was a busy kid, even in summer, but it looked as though the only event scheduled for the date of the party was his 1:00 appointment at the clinic. The invitation said that guests could begin arriving at 1:30, but the Malfoys tended towards ‘fashionably late’ appearances anyways.
The children’s and pre-teen programs went off without a hitch, Draco and Harry enjoyed a delicious meal together in the evening, and Draco ended up staying the night at Harry’s renovated townhouse. All in all it turned out to be a fantastic day…which Draco explained triumphantly to one very confused barista the following morning.
“Oh, so my love is embarrassing you?” Draco asked with a smirk. “My apologies, I’ll keep it all to myself in the future.” Scorpius ignored the teasing remark, but both father and son knew that the boy secretly appreciated his father’s attention and endearments, even if it was a little sappy.
“Er…” Draco winced, mentally pained at having to ask. “What are you doing at 2:15 this afternoon?”
“Sorry, Mr. Malfoy!” Albus gasped, covering his face with his hands. “Sorry, sorry, sorry, I didn’t realize Scorp was so close to you, or I never would have—”
“I…Scorp, you know I want to say yes,” Draco spoke through his son’s bedroom door, hoping the boy was actually listening, and didn’t have his headphones in or something. “I’m sure everything will be fine at this party, and that nothing will go wrong. I’ll stick with the other adults and leave you to spend time with your friends, alright? You probably won’t even notice that I’m there.”
“Uh…yes, thanks,” Draco nodded, presenting the salad and wine he had brought. “Where shall I put this?”
“You would do that?” Draco asked, chewing his bottom lip as he considered Harry’s proposal. “Be friends with me, that is?”
children’s books, though,” Harry said, having finally curbed his urge to laugh at Draco. “Didn’t you say you read most of the things you purchase?”
Hermione was responsible for arranging the water games for the party. The water balloons had been stowed in the house for safekeeping, as they weren’t to be used until later. That hadn’t stopped Harry for sneaking out two of the largest balloons – one for him and one for Draco – which were used to pay their sons back for their earlier prank.
As they stepped out of the house and crossed the wooden deck, Draco caught sight of his son, whose blond hair reflected sunlight like snow. He waved covertly at the boy, but received no such subtlety in return.
The child had very nearly drowned, and ended up hospitalized for nearly a month with a brain injury due to oxygen deprivation and severe pneumonia from all the water he had inhaled. The pneumonia had cleared up after a week, but made Scorpius more susceptible to lung infections. The boy was also diagnosed with acquired cerebral palsy* when it was discovered that the muscles in Scorpius’ right arm had started contracting randomly, causing abnormal movement of his elbow, wrist, and fingers.
Once the kids had tired of the slide, Albus clambered up onto Draco’s shoulders and Scorpius onto Harry’s, and the four played a violent game of chicken in the pool. The boys screamed as they attempted to push each other into the water, but with their fathers holding tightly to their legs, neither was unseated – that is, until Draco waltzed right into Harry’s space and planted a smacking kiss on his cheek, prompting Potter to reach out and yank Malfoy into a tight hug.
if they’re single.
“Papa, I’m much better now than I used to be,” Scorpius complained loudly. “Miriam said that as long as I’m not pushing myself too hard, and my arm isn’t too sore, I’m
Draco regarded Harry with surprise. He hadn’t expected the man before him to have any interest in his life, other than what they had in common – their children. But here Potter was, regarding him with the same inquisitive green eyes that had been appearing – unwarranted, but not to his displeasure – in Draco’s dreams for the better part of two decades.
flirting with anyone’s dad,
“Right, of course,” Harry nodded, sensing that it might be time to change the subject. He gestured towards the stools arranged around the island in the centre of his kitchen, offering Draco a seat. “Speaking of science and tech, how has business been for you lately? Scorp has shared a bit about what your company does, but you know how kids are – they only care so much about what mum and dad do for work.” Setting both arms on the countertop of the island, Harry leaned towards Draco with interest.
“Brilliant,” Harry said, setting his hands on his hips as he surveyed the tidy little reading area. “And what will you be doing while I read?”
“Thank you,” Draco said softly. “You don’t—”
“Luck, and the fact that he’s worked his arse off in therapy,” Draco nodded, watching his son more closely. The blond boy’s cheeks were rosy, and his eyes sparkled as he and Al kept up their trick shots with the balloon. He was using his right hand as much as his left, and didn’t seem to be struggling at the moment, which he agreed was good.
Harry and Draco were on opposing teams, and were the only adults to supervise this activity. They were both competitive by nature, so they did their best as team captains to encourage the kids on their team to get the sponge down the line as fast as possible. The younger children had a bit of a tough time, as they weren’t as coordinated as their older siblings, and eventually the game devolved into Harry and Draco soaking their sponges and wringing them out over the heads of their delighted teammates. Everyone was good and wet by the end of it.
Why did Hermione have to know everything?
When he finished, he burped and wiped his mouth with his sleeve. Hermione’s fury so plain on her face.
Once again Harry felt his heart begin to race, he wanted to talk to Draco again and he had absolutely no idea why. But, once more urged on by the atmosphere of the night, he got up, left his room, stood in front of Draco’s door, and knocked.
Draco cut him off, “It’s fine. I already knew I wouldn’t get much sleep once I returned to Hogwarts anyway. I managed to sleep over the summer because…”
“That’s a very kind thing to say. Ginny was sorry she couldn’t come, she got detention for hexing a Hufflepuff into the hospital wing for a week because he was being mean to Slytherin’s.”
As Harry turned to watch her take her seat, he noticed that Dumbledore was gone.
By Wednesday morning at breakfast, Harry was angry.
“So, how are you?”
The echoing chatter around the Great Hall seemed to suddenly fall victim to a silencing charm. Harry and Draco seemed to silently but mutually agree there wasn’t any point in appearing startled, so upon the hundreds of faces that turned their way upon their entrance, they simply kept walking with their heads held high, set at a brisk walk, determined to get to the eighth year table as quickly as possible. It was easy enough considering the eighth years sat at the far end of the hall but directly in the middle, so they only needed to make their way down in a straight line without any awkward turns.
Suddenly Harry was falling onto Draco again, his body pushing Draco up against the wall. Harry’s head lay on Draco’s shoulder as he sniffed unashamedly.
“That...that means...” Harry felt his heart rate beat faster and faster, “That we could live in the castle together!”
“So what are you saying? You want me to be friends with him too?”
Harry’s voice was raspy, “I don’t think I’ve ever felt that good in my life.”
“Yes Ernie earnest?” Ron said smiling. He’d just taken yet another shot with Harry.
Ron snorted as he, Hermione, Blaise and Luna watched them head up the boy’s spiral staircase.
“Anyway,” Hermione waved her hand. “The point is, you can’t just stop seeing him because of everyone else… Harry,” She looked at him sternly now, “You’ve never acted in accord with how people perceived you, why start now?”
“But now I’ve realised that I have the choice to change. And to use courage where I can. To choose the light, even if it’s easier to choose the dark.”
Harry burst out laughing.
“Was that good?” Draco chuckled, his grey eyes sparkling.
------------------------
Ron and Hermione giggled.
Harry stilled, his eyes wide. He nudged Draco’s head up to look at him. His pale, pointed face was still smitten with arousal, but Harry thought he saw a glint of vulnerability in his grey eyes.
Harry decided the only way to shut the overly energetic children up would be through magic. He wordlessly cast a Silencing charm and all of kids' open mouths were suddenly silenced.
As hazy thoughts from the night before swam through his mind, the one thing he could be certain of was sleeping next to Draco, but where was the blond now?
“MALFOY! POTTER!”
“Who taught you to dress so well?”
“Weasley and I thought since there’s only a few of us, and I’m talking to you too Lovegood, that we may as well have a little gathering in the common room on Christmas eve. You know, drinks and what not.”
“It beat Voldemort because it knew where its true loyalty lied, and so do you.”
“You’re there to see your parents, I’m not going to intrude-”
“Never have I ever… Entered the Slytherin common room.”
“Harry and Malfoy no less than a Gryffindor and Slytherin,” Dean chimed in now from Seamus’s otherside.
“Draco-”
Harry suddenly felt excitement creep up in his chest. He was going to get to fly again, and he was going to get to fly next to Draco Malfoy.
Harry put his head in his hand, “Merlin this is going to be interesting,” he muttered.
Ron’s voice was so loud, Harry couldn’t pretend he didn’t see the heads of his various teachers turning toward the loud and obnoxious Gryffindor.
Draco laughed. There was a pause for a moment before the blond spoke again, dropping his gaze.
Harry shifted closer to Draco, reaching out and clinging onto his top. Draco hummed and deepened the kiss.
I hope you get to come back for the holidays. Christmas at Hogwarts is my favourite time of the year. I’m used to spending it here all by myself, sometimes with Ron and Hermione too. But having the castle to myself, decorated with holly, lights and trees; I’ve never felt more at home.
“I dunno, Kingsley seemed pretty optimistic about my Auror application. Don’t even need my NEWTS he says, right Harry?”
For once in his life, his future wasn’t burdening him. The love of his life lay peacefully upon his chest. ‘The love of his life,’ Harry thought to himself, ‘Could this be real?’
Draco punched him in the arm, a playful smirk on his face, “Keep talking Chosen One.”
Draco’s eyes flashed at him, his lips parted in an attempt to protest, but before he spoke, the hangings around them were drawn open.
Draco linked their hands as they made their concealed way all the way up to Gryffindor tower. Harry really couldn’t believe this was happening. Not only had Draco consecutively refused to visit Harry’s room, Harry had already been caught in Draco’s room and the whole school knew about it! This was, simply, a recipe for disaster.
“Merlin you’re cute.”
“What are you smirking at?” Ron said looking at Harry.
Harry kissed Draco’s hips as he undid his fly.
“Can you believe it?! Us, with our own rooms! I didn’t think McGonagall had it in her...Dumbledore perhaps but I’d never guessed this kind of treatment from the woman who’d preferred me in Hufflepuff,” Neville said.
“No I-,” He let out a deep breath, “I wanted to give him back his wand. I guess I just fumbled too long in my bag. We missed the carriages, and walked up here together.”
“We just can’t Hermione,” Harry said firmly, “But that’s not the problem… It’s like, I just want to be with him all the time, and I’m always looking for him everywhere I go, always thinking about him! My problem is… I don’t have the time or the effort to be so attached, and yet here I am, more attached than ever!”
“Me too,” Said Neville.
Harry.’
“Do you just carry that around with you? I think I’ve seen you play with it before?”
Harry’s face was beaming as Draco just shook his head and smiled, “Took you long enough.”
On Wednesday night, Draco seemed to be overprotective all of the sudden. They had both been in the common room late at night, Harry with Ron and Seamus, and Draco with Theo and Blaise. When Harry had bade his friends goodnight and walked up to his bedroom, he heard quickening footsteps behind him climbing up the stairs.
“And what about him!” Bill called, looking past them toward Blaise.
Harry then finally closed the gap between them, kissing Draco softly.
The blond smiled back at him and there was a slight pause, before Draco said, “So, what should we teach them? I think we’ve got the first years to start with.”
Draco pressed him up close to the wall as he gripped one hand onto Harry’s hip and the other onto his neck.
“Potter I,” Draco spoke, that same raspy accent that sent Harry over the edge, “I think I have something of yours.”
“Yes?” Blaise raising his eyebrows in a challenging sort of way.
“No. But, also yes…Yes, I can’t sleep. Can you?”
Dumbledore peered at him. That same face boring into Harry, looking at him like he already knew everything.
Harry suddenly felt a sudden urge to flee from the pub.
Ron was rolling his eyes but smiling nonetheless.
“George! How are you?” Harry asked as George roughly hugged them all.
“Strange, I wonder if Draco knows him,” Hermione said.
‘Dear Harry,
“Nightmares.”
Frankly, Harry was ecstatic.
They were so close that Harry could feel Draco’s heart beating against his, and for the first time in a long time, Harry felt safe.
Harry awoke next morning not only with a splitting headache, but also in an empty bed.
As he made his way to leave the shed, Harry grabbed his upper arm.
Harry figured he drank so much already, what was a few drops of truth potion going to do. He actually figured, being at that peak stage of drunkenness when one felt absolutely invincible, that he needn’t even take the potion, for the alcohol would have him spilling the truth regardless.
“Harry I…, I love you.”
Harry pushed past them towards the doorway.
“Right,” Harry said despite his circling thoughts, “Thanks for telling me.”
Harry had a feeling Ron was being friendly and open with Draco because he knew this was a tough day for Harry, and if Draco and Hermione had really just spent all afternoon preparing cake and gifts for Harry, then he reckoned Ron could give Draco a chance. The four talked and laughed late into the evening, and Harry felt his spirits begin to lift.
“Yeah that was the plan. Diagon Alley’s like a dustball when you kids aren’t around. Only get the odd eccentric adult now and again. So I figure if the kids can’t come to the shop, I’ll bring the shop to the kids.”
She looked between them.
Then Draco’s hand was gone and he turned to head up the path. Harry bent to grab his bag and sling it over his shoulder, for some reason missing the touch of Draco’s hand. He shook his head and hurried after the blond.
Draco had grabbed Harry’s hand and let him into Harry’s room. He led him to his bed and Harry sat down on it, still clinging to Draco as the blond stood next to the bed.
Harry’s eyes flashed, “So are you.”
As Harry still sat facing away from the majority of the pub, as well as the pub’s entrance, nothing could’ve prepared him for the warm hand that placed itself upon his shoulder, and the sudden scent of parchment and soil radiating from behind him.
When they were all heading back to their common room, Harry felt himself being practically dragged by Hermione and Draco. They both had each of his arms slung over their shoulders as they helped him back through the castle. It was late enough that they could assume Filch was asleep.
Harry had bucked his hips into Draco, seeking the friction from before, but this time, after Draco ran his hand down Harry’s toned chest and stomach, he slipped his hand between their hardened members.
“Come on MacMillan. All in the name of Inter-house unity,” her smirk only widening.
Draco giggled at his stilled face, “It’s OK I don’t want you to say anything. I just want you to know how brave you are. Never letting the cool kids dictate what you do, never changing yourself to fit in.”
Hermione pursed her lips, “Well, I’m sure they’ll be wishing they did when the time comes.”
Harry’s grip around Draco’s waist tightened immensely as he felt himself near his climax.
Harry breathed out heavily in annoyance. He knew he shouldn’t be angry at Hermione, but her absence seemed to fit as a perfect scapegoat for the whirlwind of emotions he was currently feeling. One of those feelings, notably, was anxiety, anxiety not only over Hermione’s mysterious disappearance but Draco’s as well.
Harry managed a breath that was more like a gasp. Merlin had he missed the boy’s proximity. It was beginning to drive him mad.
--------
As soon as she was out of sight, tremendous laughter broke out around the table.
Harry growled, his eyes flashing.
“What were you even talking about Parvati?” Came Ron’s croaky voice, his eyes half closed turning to her.
Just when Harry thought he couldn’t handle anymore pleasure, he then felt Draco’s bring their bodies even closer together as the blond now began to grind his cock against Harry’s arse.
“I’m glad to hear it Harry.”
“He told me, er, last night.”
“I think there’s more to your sexuality Harry, you just haven’t worked it out yet… Of course, none of that’s your fault, you’ve never had any time to figure out the normal things teenagers get to figure out.”
As the rawness of Harry's Occlumency lesson began to subside and he finally caught up with what he was doing, he suddenly felt vulnerable.
“Shall I move Professor?” Parvati said from between Harry and Draco, “Believe it or not they’ve been closer than this.”
“There’s a freaking Ministry man down stairs at the door of the common room! You have to go, NOW!”
“You look handsome Harry.”
“What?”
Draco looked at Harry with earnest eyes. His mouth formed a small grin. Before Harry knew what was happening, Draco’s free arm reached up and Draco’s fingers graced softly down Harry’s cheek.
It was dark outside, and the light in Draco’s room was dim, the only glare coming from the softening embers in the fireplace. As Draco made to get into his bed, Harry followed suit. Before they had both laid down however, Harry spoke.
“Your Mark.”
Draco ran his hands through Harry’s hair as Harry deepened the kiss, feeling Draco smile against his lips.
Draco let out a breath of laughter, “Well, I know what you’re like Potter, needing to know that everything is alright in the world. I let you in to show you that I’m not up to anything strange in here, if that’s what you were thinking.”
“Forgot we were leaving today! We don’t usually leave till the 20th!”
Harry was still clinging to him tightly, his heart beating rapidly. When he finally spoke, his voice was still croaky, almost a whisper.
“She’s fine. Much better when I left her compared to when I arrived.”
As Harry smirked into the kiss, he began to grind more urgently, now feeling their erections rub against each other through their trousers.
“About us?” Draco asked, his grey eyes glistening.
Harry shook his head furiously, “No! No… It’s-” His mouth was dry. He swallowed, trying to compose himself, “Look, this has been a rough year, and… And well, I’ve sort of found an escape with this person… You know, like a way to get my mind off everything. I-I don’t really know how it happened, but… But I’m late so I really have to go.”
Harry shook his head as Ron sucked absentmindedly on his chocolate frog.
“Oh come on Potter, aren’t you supposed to be the bravest, boy wonder, Chosen One Gryffindor to ever exist?” Pansy asked, causing more sniggers.
“Don’t worry. I wouldn’t expect anything less.”
And only now did Harry realise he’s slip up. He looked away from her, but she reached over and clasped his wrist.
Draco shrugged.
It only took Draco a couple of grind’s before Harry felt him shudder on top of him and groan breathlessly against his ear.
Harry growled into Draco’s neck. Just hearing Draco admit he wanted him made Harry hard.
And the worst of all, was when Harry would come meet Draco after he’d seen Snape for Occlumency, and Harry simply couldn’t tell Draco about what he’d been doing; the blond would outrightly sulk.
“I-I’m fine,” He cleared his throat, then looked up at the old wizard’s kind face, “Actually, I’m great.”
“McGonagall said I could teach on the second Saturday of each month too, as I was so keen for the positions.”
As the eighth years, as well as Ginny and Luna, all gushed about their presents over breakfast, it wasn’t until a while later that Harry realised Ron, Hermione and Ginny were all dressed in their scarves and beanies, clearly ready to head to Hogsmeade after they’d eaten.
Draco snickered. The blond placed his arms on either side of Harry’s head and lay the rest of his body on top of him. Slowly, Draco lowered himself, nuzzling his head into Harry’s neck as he began grinding against Harry’s pelvis.
“I met Draco in the library and he looked very sad. He said you didn’t seem to be yourself in Charms today and I explained what the significance of today was-”
Draco pressed on.
Ron, gasping for air through his laughter, said, “Yeah- We...we! We wanted to know who...who the heir of Slytherin was!” He was practically choking on his breath, “So...So we became Crabbe and Goyle, and...and followed Malfoy into the common room!”
When Ginny had ended it, she had said something to Harry that had left him confused, curious and somewhat afraid.
Harry nodded against his pillow as his eyes bore into Draco’s.
Draco whispered, his breath ghosting across Harry’s cheek and Harry felt his pulse start to quicken.
“Yeah, I can just imagine the look on Snape’s face.”
-------------
“What are you grinning at? Something intriguing outside the window?” Hermione asked, smirking.
Ron, to Harry’s surprise, sat beside Blaise and the two started chatting about Quidditch among other things like they’d known each other for twenty years.
When he knocked and there was no response, he entered anyway.
“Finnigan.”
“Nothing,” he smiled back down at his plate.
Sighing, he set off toward his bedroom.
The two disengaged from their helping friends and ran toward each other, colliding in a crashing hug.
Draco hummed in approval.
Harry’s eyes widened, but he didn’t move his head.
Sunday had rolled dismally into Monday, and Draco still wasn’t back yet.
Now all the students were spread out again across the room, even more comfortable with one another, and a whole lot more drunk (if that was humanly possible for Ron, Harry and Seamus).
