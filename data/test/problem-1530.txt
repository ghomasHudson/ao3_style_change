“Speaking of expensive, you’ve gone over your scheduled time so that’ll be extra.” It’s not strictly true, but Harry’s still in a spirited mood and it’s always rewarding when he does actually manage to rile the other man up.
Harry shrugged again and passed Malfoy the tea tin. “Yeah, but I just didn’t know how to order tea how I like it in French.”
The smile he felt on his own face was a bit of a surprise, but he couldn’t help it. Malfoy had provided the words better than he had been able to since he had thought up this crazy move. “Pretty much, yeah. I wanted to start over, and to be left alone for a while.” Then he added, “mostly alone,” in case Malfoy took offense. “Paris seemed like a decent choice. No one is going to follow me home, or ask me for my autograph, or an interview.” There were a million other little things that seemed to make sense, but he’d felt he’d said enough so he just shrugged in closing.
“Liked those gloves then?” says Draco. “I had a hell of a time with the connection spell. Had to outsource it to Dervish in the end.”
“What part of busy don’t you understand?” asks Draco even as he starts thrusting his hips in little motions, trying to get Potter to work his cock properly.
Harry lay in bed and stared at the unfamiliar ceiling. This one was tiled, but many of the white tiles had faded to beige, or had been cracked or damaged. He was too old to be waking up to ceilings like this one, too old to be lying in a stranger’s bed, and definitely too old to be having his cock sucked by the boy beneath the covers.
“Are we back to cursing, you said something like idiot right?” Malfoy nodded and Harry repeated the phrase back.
Maybe not in the prickly, kind of cute way he normally gets, but in a proper what-the-fuck-have-you-done-Potter way that is usually followed by a period of avoidance.
The vibrator keeps going, stroking over his very sensitive prostate again and again and his colleague is staring right at him cumming all over himself. He’s not sure if the tears that blind his eyes are from the overstimulation or the humiliation. How could Potter do this to him?
As with his fingernails, Draco works carefully and intently, adding two coats before using his wand to dry his toenails. And, as before, Draco sets each of his feet aside with reverent care, letting them hit the bare carpet rather than imprisoning them again in the plain cotton slippers.
As she reluctantly handed him the lovingly prepared bundle he had a moment’s commiseration for a parent separated from one’s child. “Can’t you visit him?” he asked as he wondered who Malfoy had spent Christmas with anyways.
Draco and his mirror image reach up to touch his cheek, but there’s nothing there. He glances over his shoulder again, but it’s still just a storeroom with his colleagues arguing over an old professor’s handwriting.
Feeling soft and pampered Harry is led to the lingerie chest inside the walk-in. The cotton robe is left discarded and forgotten by the vanity, but Harry is not uncomfortable in his nakedness.
Draco’s waving a hand, the one not holding the fork spearing a carrot slice. “No, I mean in public. In a bar. What’s the point?”
Draco’s trying to follow the motion, itching frantically up his leg until his whole body goes rigid.
“I didn’t lie,” Draco had insisted, though he was having to argue with Harry's back. “I fingered myself in the shower, and then wanked with the beads inside me.”
Harry turned, clutching an extra large bar of Honeydukes finest against his chest and stared at the woman who had tapped him on the shoulder. He hadn’t seen Narcissa Malfoy in years. Not since her trial at least. She’d been the only member of her family to escape extreme punishment, thanks in part to his own testimony. House arrest, he recalled through the haze of time. Lucius was still in Azkaban to his knowledge.
“Seventeen hippogriffs, fuck off I said, eighteen hippogriffs,” he’s forced to count out loud, because Potter’s hands are roving about all the bare skin he’s been hiding under his robes, stroking his thighs, his back, his stomach, finding the leg of his briefs and sticking his fingers under the thin material. It’s too distracting.
“The entire year the real Moody was locked in a trunk in his office. He never taught a single lesson,” said Harry. His hand was tingling.
Harry frowned. “The Ministry took your father’s money first of all, not yours, and they gave you enough to make a proper start of it.”
They both look utterly debauched. Potter’s face is red, and there’s dried saliva spread around his mouth. His glasses are tangled in his hair as usual. Draco reaches to help him unravel where Potter’s curls are wrapped around the nosepiece. They are soft and bouncy under his nimble fingers.
Harry bows and holds the pose for exactly one second before he’s up again and bringing forth his shield. Draco’s whip quick, he’s learned and has no qualms about embarrassing Harry in front of the students. His tongue-tying curse bounces harmlessly off Harry’s shield, but he’s already got another spell on his lips.
The effects are near-instant, it’s remarkable to watch. One moment Harry is tipping the potion into Draco’s mouth, watching as Draco’s eyes slide shut. The next moment his body gives a little shake and Harry’s worried about him falling over so he grabs him around the waist to hold him up. Draco relaxes in his arms, hands coming up to grip Harry’s shoulders, head tipped back as if in ecstasy. It looks like it feels fantastic, honestly, whatever the effects of the potion are.
Harry didn’t know why he kept drinking espresso. He didn’t even really like coffee that much, particularly when it was strong as hell and came in the most emasculating tiny cup. But he didn’t know any French and he at least knew how to pronounce ‘espresso’ without embarrassing himself.
“As much as I am loving it, and fuck I am loving it, I think I’d prefer the excess blood in my cock instead of my head.”
Malfoy sighed with exaggerated patience and motioned for him to continue. “Merde, Potter! You’re invited, obviously, or I would have told you to fuck off as well.”
Draco manages brilliantly though, brings both hands up to wrap around the base of Harry’s cock and works them in tandem with his mouth until Harry is enveloped in a tight, sucking vacuum. It doesn’t take long like this, with Draco gazing adoringly up into Harry’s eyes with his mouth stretched tight around his cock. By the time Draco starts moaning again and the little vibrations tease and tingle, Harry can’t hold on any longer.
“Happy Christmas, Mr. Potter. I hope that you’ve enjoyed your holiday,” she said. She had a fancy box of truffles clutched in one hand.
Harry decides it’s not worth arguing anymore. No matter how many times they have this discussion, Draco won’t budge. He won’t even let Harry hint to his friends that he might be seeing someone. Besides, his boyfriend— and Draco is his boyfriend no matter how many people know it— has just given him a present.
Angrily he tossed the card onto his bedside table and walked to the ensuite. What did he care about Draco Malfoy anyway? It wasn’t his business what the man was doing in Paris or why he was a florist of all things. He was nearly thirty-six; he should have stopped caring about schoolboys years ago.
As with every other time Lucas’ name was brought up, Harry chose not to comment, Malfoy chose not to notice and went into detail about what he expected out of his, ‘Pamper me, because it’s my birthday’ weekend.
“You’re really bad at it, aren’t you? Dating?” he says. Mostly because he doesn't know what else he can say.
He knows what he needs. With one hand in his hair, Harry tips Draco’s head back. “Tell me,” he orders. “Tell me what you want.”
Eventually Malfoy’s lips snapped shut with his paper and he was gesturing for Harry to pay the bill already so they could take the Métro across the city.
Instead of answering, Draco opens his eyes and stares into Harry’s as he sinks to his knees. Harry’s cock is threatening to punch through the front of his trousers, it's so hard. The novelty of Draco Malfoy on his knees for him has not worn off and he’s been hoping to get another chance at that mouth for months now.
“I didn’t want you to stop coming around to the shop. I just meant for you to leave just that one time.”
Draco finishes swallowing his mouthful, licks his lips and says; “What exactly was your plan?” His voice is only a little husky. “What was the point of stealing my Felix Felicis anyway?”
Harry liked his accent too. He didn’t know any other Americans aside from Kate, and he was getting used to speaking to people for whom English was their second language, and he’d never gotten around to actually learning much French, despite Marie’s assistance.
And that’s a thought he doesn’t need because, despite the clutter, the shelves are suspiciously dust free. At some point, some poor Hogwarts elf has had to clean the toy he’s had up his arse.
The bloody fuck weasel is laughing, but Draco’s barely hanging on. He’s gripping the edge of his work table so hard his hands are cramping and then it gets worse as Potter reaches around and starts slowly pulling his cock in time even though Draco isn’t counting aloud anymore.
Draco glances at the clock hanging on his office wall, his schedule hand is pointing to the dinner section and his stomach is feeling empty. A trickle of cum is running down his thigh as he considers.
He’s never been particularly good with his words, he’s always been better with actions. Maybe he can make Draco believe him.
“New television,” he explains. “I thought Eddie might like one for the Muggle Studies department.” He flicks his wand and the shimmering fabric falls to the floor. “Oh wow,” he gasps. “You have made a mess of yourself, haven’t you.”
Matthew was staying in New York for New Years so Harry accepted Lauren’s invitation to a New Years Eve party when it came. He had hoped to regain some of his pre-Christmas cheer, but when the first person he’d seen at the party was Malfoy pouring drinks in the kitchen, he knew it was useless. Lauren shot him a look of understanding, but also seemed determined to play matchmaker. He’d already been told no less than three times that Lucas was not attending tonight’s festivities, and he didn’t really appreciate the implication.
“Those were the spells, my boy,” explains Percy. “It’s always best to learn by hand first, so you can test each knot and determine the best placement. Wouldn’t want to injure you, would we?”
Despite the fact that they had been seeing one another for nearly two months now, they had only progressed to frotting against one another like teenagers recently. Harry had declared early on that he wanted to take things slow and that he was more interested in a relationship than getting off. Matthew had agreed, but seemed to take a ridiculous amount of delight in the small love bites he had taken to leaving on Harry’s neck.
Draco doesn’t give him a moment to stall it any longer, and takes him in, cradling his tip on that soft tongue. It’s remarkable how soft and sweet that mouth is when it’s usually so sharp. This mouth that wraps around him so carefully when minutes ago it was cursing him.
“I’ve got to feed the giant squid,” he says instead. He waits for a beat, maybe to give Draco a chance to intervene and then when it’s clear that he’s not going to, turns and walks towards the Great Lake.
“You should have,” Harry says, thinking about it even though he’d been in detention and it would have been far too inappropriate. “Would have bent you over my desk and filled you up.”
Draco cries out and stills, let’s his arse milk Potter’s cock as he cums. Potter loves him messy, so Draco takes longer than necessary to come down from his high and lift off Potter’s cock. Let the man look at his messy stomach and chest.
“Merlin fuck,” says Draco, and Harry knows it’s his image reflected at him as much as the bondage itself that’s causing his cock to grow hard against his stomach. He’s such a peacock.
“Why not?” said Malfoy with another eyebrow arch. It really was an art form. “I do it all the time.”
In response, Draco drops to his knees and splays his legs open so Harry can see everything. With his arms pulled back like that he finds his eyes drawn to Draco’s chest more than he ever has before. “Try it on my nipples then, that’d probably feel good. Hey, Percy, does it work on nipples?”
Harry focused his attention on the potted plant in the corner. It was a cactus, Malfoy had given it to him for his birthday and assured him it was the one plant he couldn’t kill.
Harry’s concentration doesn’t break, the tip of his tongue is sticking out of the corner of his mouth and there’s a line of concern between his eyebrows. He struggled with reports last year, Draco knows, and he’s worried about having to do them again. But it doesn’t matter. Draco’s here now, he’ll help.
“Fuck,” says Potter. He has two fingers teasing the loosened hole, stroking them through the cum there. Draco relaxes at the touch and he feels his rim flutter as more leaks out onto Potter’s fingers. Draco whimpers and squeezes his cock. The tip of one of Potter’s fingers presses in, just slightly, not nearly enough. Draco tries to push down on it, but Potter stops that with a hand pressed to his hip. “Ask me nicely, then.”
Harry lifts his wand and forces Draco’s body to rotate in a slow circle. He’s like an inverted ballerina, or spiderman maybe, but that doesn’t sound as sexy and if he mentions it to Draco he’ll ask who’s been crossbreeding with acromantulas.
Harry takes a long sip and lets the warm tea slide down his throat and warm him from the inside out. Draco has slid his gaze over to him and is sitting so rigidly still that Harry knows his plan is working.
Matthew rested his fingertips at Harry’s collar, fingers just barely brushing bare skin. Harry shivered as the other man grazed the bruise that had been left there only last night and batted the hand away with a smile to take the sting out of the action. Matthew laughed and rolled his eyes as Harry tugged his collar more firmly against his neck.
When Harry pulls his thumb out, he runs the wet pad first against Draco’s top lip, then the bottom, getting them nice and wet, then slides his hand into the other man’s hair to grip the back of his neck.
“Fuck, I can’t wait for this weekend.” It was the usual type of conversational segue for Malfoy. He tended to jump from topic to topic without cause.
“I’ve been thinking,” says Potter. Draco closes his eyes, he’d known it wouldn’t last. Whenever Potter says ‘I’ve been thinking' it’s never good news.
Ah, youth, Harry thought. Then he slammed back the shot of tequila he’d just been given and smiled back.
It wasn’t as bad as when Ginny had found out, but then again, this time Harry hadn’t been caught with his pants literally around his ankles. This time he had to be the one to come clean. He knew he could have hid the truth from Matthew, it would be easy to lie about this. No one had seen them together, and Malfoy, Draco, certainly wouldn’t tell him. Or at least Harry didn’t think so. And it wasn’t like he didn’t have experience about lying about his infidelities in the past.
“And then we step,” says Harry, taking a step forward as Draco takes a step back. It’s harder to get used to the shuffling duelling step instead of placing one foot in front of the other, but it puts you at less risk of any curses that would aim to trip you up. “Then again,” he says, this time stepping back as Draco smoothly steps forward. “You want to maintain that distance, some of the spells you’ll use will have backlash or might affect you if you get too close. If you want your spells to solely impact your opponent and not you then watch your spacing!”
Annoyed, Harry casts a reductor from his prone position though he knows Draco will counter it easily, it’s only to buy himself time enough to stand. Draco’s concentrating on holding his shield up so the second it starts to drop Harry uses the seize-and-pull charm to send a tendril of light out to grasp Draco’s legs. He pulls and Draco goes down in a heap and is hit with a tongue tie in quick succession.
Not that Draco hadn’t enjoyed the fierce welcome back after a long summer. Hadn’t enjoyed that familiar flair of passion in Potter’s eyes just before he’d be turned around, slammed against the wall, and brutalised.
“Another?” the boy asked. He looked Spanish rather than French and was going for a wide-eyed innocent look now.
“Shh,” soothes Potter, rubbing the tears from his face. “Tell me you can do it, one more, for me. I want to watch.”
And that, to Harry, sounds like a great idea. He’s lucky he put down a cushioning charm because his knees would be bruised without it. Draco can’t do much other than lay there so Harry sets the pace, trying to time it with the little clenches Draco makes around the vibrator. He enjoys the long slide of Draco’s cock for a bit, but then he has to take himself in hand and yes… that’s so much better. His balls tighten and draw up at the first stroke, his cock heavy and full in his palm.
The vibrator slides in and Draco forgets all about schedules. There’s no real stretch, it’s a slim toy, but the vibrations drive him mad. He bucks as best he can while dangling from his hands, toes scraping against the floor for leverage.
But still he found himself sitting with Malfoy at least twice a week, listening to him rattle on about whatever thought floated through his head.
“Finished? Good,” says Draco. “Come here, you’re going to have to feed it to me to make the magic take hold since I’m the one who brewed it.”
And Draco is smiling at him, looking at the necklace as if he’s just bestowed Harry with a precious gift. “I’ve been shopping,” he says, holding up another slim box.
He’s fuming, cheeks near red in anger. His left eyebrow is even twitching and his hair looks like he’s been running his fingers through it, disturbing his usual carefully arranged coif. His body is also extremely close to Harry’s, as he leans in to box him in against the wall, two hands fisted in the front of Harry’s robes. Despite the situation, Harry shivers and his cock gives a very interested twitch.
Draco stares at him for a long moment, Harry wants to give him space but he can’t help reaching out to twine their fingers together. He hopes Draco will let him kiss him again.
“He knows the best spells, too, where do you think I learned the thrusting and vibration spells from? And the silk rope incarcerous?”
Draco’s looking up at him now, waiting for him to decide. It grips Harry for a moment, how full of trust his expression is. As much as he grumbles, he’s shown a willingness to put himself in Harry’s hands again and again. It makes Harry want to do anything for him. Or to him.
Across the room, Percy sighs heavily. “Alas, the only entertainment I was provided with was the sight of the dormice chewing their way through the door frame.” Which is oddly comforting. It would definitely be worse to find out his boyfriend and Severus Snape have both got off with the same bloke, portrait or not. “Draco is infinitely more enjoyable.”
There was no resisting the twitch that hit Harry’s lips, but he did manage to not allow it to bloom into a full smile. He couldn’t believe how long he’d forgotten the memory. It could probably fuel his next Patronous. “Barty Crouch Junior.”
Potter does care about him and does see him for who he is. It’s not just about proximity or sex, although the sex is fantastic. Potter knows about all of his secrets, has been there for all of his worst moments, and still sees the good in him after all these years.
With a few stretches Harry made his way to the toilet to clean himself up. A few spells helped remove the lingering stench of sweat and sex, and the taste of stale liquor from his breath. Living among Muggles was one thing, giving up the convenience magic completely was another thing entirely.
“I see not,” Malfoy muttered. “Wednesday would be a good day to go. It’s supposed to be sunny and there’s a festival going on near Notre Dame that will occupy a majority of the tourists.”
“It’s both,” continues Potter. “I keep telling you I like you, but you keep not believing me. So I thought I’d show you.”
Harry felt sufficiently tipsy, but smiled and shrugged. It wasn’t as if he had to get up for work in the morning.
Draco’s not capable of arguing back, not with the gag stuffed between his teeth. What he can do is whine as Potter pushes a second finger in with a rapid thrust.
Draco doesn’t answer but starts sucking on Harry’s ear as his fingers dip below his waistband. It’s a tight fight, but he wiggles in, pressing along Harry’s thickening cock, pulling it up from his leg to press against his stomach.
Lauren laughed and held the plate out of Draco’s reach. “It’s Harry’s birthday, Draco, he gets the first slice.”
The pillows turned out to be a fantastic idea because his body isn’t as stiff as he would have expected after sitting still for so long and now he has something to grab and clutch to his chest while he processes.
Harry grins at him, eyes crinkling at the corners beneath his glasses like they do when he’s extremely pleased. Then he ducks down and gives him a peck on the cheek.
McGonagall is reading through the Hogsmeade Weekend schedule for the first term. Malfoy’s been signed up for three out of the four weekends and hasn’t even noticed he’s glaring at Harry so hard. Harry’s pleased to get away with only one out of the four, though he does have homework duty in the library every other Tuesday after dinner instead.
Potter clearly does not enjoy being ignored and looks so sulky that McGonagall asks him if he has an upset stomach. Potter mumbles something incoherent, of course, but doesn’t go for his hand again.
Probably, Potter’s day hasn’t been any better, judging from his frantic presence at the dinner table. He’d shown up with an armful of essays and marked straight through dinner, without looking Draco’s way once which simply won’t do. He’s spent most of his Hogwarts years as a student and then as a teacher trying to get Potter’s attention and that urge hasn’t stopped yet.
Draco doesn’t blink. “Would I like to keep the racist mark branded on my arm by the genocidal arsehole who was the cause of not one but two wars during our lifetimes? No, you dickwit, I don’t want to keep it but that’s not exactly a choice I have, is it?”
“Besides,” continues Draco. “I don’t have him out all the time. I usually keep him in the hall closet so he can’t creep on me.”
Harry tried to think of a comeback, but really this whole experience was already too ridiculous for words, so he just reached for a menu that was thankfully in both English and French.
The feeling that overtakes him feels deliriously close to happiness and Draco is finally ready to start allowing himself to feel it. He looks at the clock, they’ve missed dinner, but they can always call on a house elf. His eyes slide to the shelf, then back to Potter.
He’s so worried about it that when the card on his tongue sparks he’s completely taken by surprise. Instinctually he clamps his mouth shut tighter, even though the corners of the card cut into the sides of his mouth, and the sparks burn against his tongue. He gasps, his mouth opens, and the card falls. Then before he can soothe his burning tongue Harry’s up on his knees, grabbing him by the hair, and sliding his cock into his open mouth.
“How long does the spell last?” He asks Percy. Draco’s drooling on his shoulder and doesn’t seem to care.
Draco, for once, is shaking his head in refusal. “No, I think I’d much rather be the one sucking your cock, thanks. Too.. intense.”
Harry feels the now loose and open hole. He was maybe a little more enthusiastic than Draco had been with the stretching spell, but Draco takes it better, he knows. Draco’s leg spread wider, trying to wrap around Harry and draw him in, using what leverage he can with his arms tied up to get Harry’s cock in his arse.
His glass of pumpkin juice has left a ring of condensation on the wood. Draco made him use a coaster after he’d noticed, but there’s still a little wet spot. Harry runs a finger through, wetting the polished wood beneath, scraping his fingernail against it as he goes. “Thing is,” he says as he draws a little squiggle with the water. “You got the mark after he was resurrected. Not before.”
Harry’s being creative with his stacking, he can feel them slide between his calf and thigh, balance on his shoulder, tucked into the ropes on his stomach, and Draco’s pretty sure Harry’s built a little house with them on his right arse cheek.
Potter glances up briefly and his quill stops. Draco’s rather pleased by the sweeping glance that heats his skin, but is less pleased when Potter says; “I really can’t. McGonagall’s asked me to present my duelling curriculum to the board tomorrow and it’s nowhere near ready.”
“I’m pretty sure you just called him something to do with being a whore and now you’re defending him?”
Draco moans and thrusts into the vibration then back onto Potter’s fingers, the twin sensations overwhelming but so good.
As with most social situations, Harry wasn’t very good at parties. He tended to gravitate towards kitchens, and usually drank too much since he always felt the need to have something to do with his hands. Malfoy and Lauren were both in attendance when Harry finally found the right address and figured out how to buzz the appropriate apartment from the street. Lauren met him at the door and guided Harry into the kitchen for a drink, but Malfoy hadn’t so much as glanced his way. He was far too preoccupied with his conversation partner.
Malfoy sat on the couch heavily and placed his head in his hands. To Harry’s horror his back began heaving up and down as he sobbed quietly into his hands.
He does exactly that, pours himself a nice cup of tea, adds a splash of milk, sits across the room, and picks up his book. He has to whisper, but thankfully he’s far enough away and Parseltongue is sibilant so it blends in with the wireless Aurora always has on.
He had liked this relationship. Matthew was fun, and easy to be around, and he cared about Harry and the things Harry liked. He had even thought about introducing Matthew to his kids, and they’d been talking about going away on a holiday together in the spring. And now Harry was confessing that he’d spent the night with another man.
The boys ignored the threat and wandered off to see if there was anything interesting in the back room, like there was at the Wheezes, but Lily looked up at Harry with wide, watery eyes.
The look on Draco’s face remained utterly frosty as if to say, “Damn straight I get the first bite,” but the effect was somewhat ruined by the enormous bite he stuffed between his lips a moment later. The icing from the pink carnation was streaked across his upper lip.
For a moment there’s nothing he can do but stay hunched over on his hands and knees as his hole is gently scissored and stretched. He’d be terrified, only the fingers are so, so familiar and Draco Malfoy is so, so dead.
He loves the lavish attention, the variety, and the unexpected thrill that comes with meeting a new client. And above all, he loves the sex. The real truth of it all is that he’d probably pay for someone to do the things he’s experienced to him. It’s just good fortune that he instead gets paid for it.
He uses the usual potions and tonics in the shower, one to soften his hair, another to remove the stubble from his face and body, a third to soften and tan his skin. He’s left dripping on the tiles feeling refreshed and smelling faintly of green apples. He dons the white cotton robe he’s used before and slips his feet into the matching slippers before going out to meet Draco in his playroom.
Draco waves his wand lazily and casts a freezing charm to hold both boys in place. “Think it’s time we finished up for the evening, yes?”
Harry rolls his eyes at himself in the mirror as he reaches for the nail polish remover. Now it’ll be about his…
Harry didn’t like the twisted smirk on Malfoy’s face. “What was it again?” he challenged. He repeated ‘je veux t’enculer’ five more times until he was sure he had it right.
“I like him. He’s got experience.” And the way he says experience like that, ‘experience’, gets Harry hot under the collar. Like Harry’s experience isn’t even in the same realm.
“No plans to haul me back to England, or to throw me in Azkaban?” Malfoy did not appear to be concerned by either of these prospects and was instead lounging back in his chair with an almost bored expression.
“Do it,” pants Draco and that’s all the encouragement he needs to cum all over his pretty face. Harry gasps as he shoots, across Draco’s cheek, into his hair, then his chin, Draco’s tongue slipping out for a taste. When he’s finished, he looks wrecked and Harry can’t resist bending down and kissing those filthy lips. Draco tastes of cock and cum, but it’s still delicious.
“I’m not sure I want any more presents from you,” he says as he wraps an arm around Draco and pulls him closer. The bed is warm and as soft as a cloud. Draco, no surprise, has the loveliest sheets and his bed is spelled with so many cushioning charms that Harry has never once tossed or turned while sleeping in it. It’s still a novelty to be able to sneak into Draco’s rooms and share a bed.
Draco’s cheek twitches. It’s not quite a smile, but his face is more relaxed than it was. “It would have to be something very good then, I expect.”
Being single wasn’t really so different than being in a relationship. He still spent Sundays at the market, he still went to his yoga lessons, and met Marie for their language exchange, and he’d always slept in his big bed alone. But now he didn’t have Matthew’s frequent texts, or their weekly double dates with Craig and Pierre, and he definitely missed the sex that had never involved removing one another’s clothes with anything but their hands.
He didn’t get to watch Potter cum through the tears in his eyes, but he must have finished already because his trousers are fastened back up as he lowers Draco to the floor. Draco’s heels fall gratefully to the stone and his trembling knees struggle to support him. Potter takes his weight with one arm and scoops him into his chair.
He had expected another run-in with Malfoy at some point. What he had not expected was for the man to turn up at his flat on a Tuesday morning when he should have been at work. He hadn’t even known Malfoy knew where he lived.
Harry took the opportunity to size up the man as he hadn’t that other night. He was tall, several inches taller than Malfoy, who was already taller than Harry. And he was sort of…dashing. Harry couldn’t think of another word to describe it. He moved easily, and confidently, and was clearly charming if the way the people around him were acting was any indication. And he had Malfoy eating out of the palm of his hand. Sometimes even literally, which was also disgusting.
Draco doesn't have the capacity to put on a show anymore, but he must make a good picture regardless because when Potter pulls out his cock he looks as painfully hard as Draco is right now. And Draco can’t help it. His eyes are drawn to it, he really is a cock slut, because even as fucked out as he is, his hole still clenches at the thought of bending over for Potter.
There was also an address, a shop number, a mobile number, and even an email address. Apparently Draco Malfoy, Prince of the Purebloods, had done a full Muggle.
Harry looked into his tea leaves and tried to read his fortune. “I didn’t want to be friends with you either, Malfoy.”
The second his hand closes on the jar, Potter’s grip goes gentle again and his tongue searches for his hole. There’s less room to work, and Draco has to arch awkwardly to open the jar, but the tongue finds its target regardless.
It’s the fastest he’s ever cum in his whole life, probably faster than any of his teenage wanks even. And just as promised, the spell ends the moment he’s finished coming. He rests against Draco as his heart rate speeds down, remembering at the last moment to cancel the spell on both of Draco’s nipples. He doesn’t even have to ask if Draco has cum, there’s no way anyone could manage longer than two minutes of that.
He took his CV to Ministère de la Justice and met with several men he’d collaborated with in the past. Three weeks later and he was hired on as an Auror. It wasn’t as senior as his job in London had been, and he wasn’t paid as much, but in some ways it was so much better. For one, he had been right, no one in France gave a damn about his name and if he was recognized it was only with uninterested glances and brief lingering pauses that were quickly forgotten.
Honestly, Harry’s hardly noticing the time go, he finds the rope surprisingly relaxing. He hums, in answer though, so Draco won’t get annoyed.
“Why not?” asks Harry. He has the answer, he knows why, but he wants to know what Draco will say, how far he’s looked into it before.
Percy regards the situation through his portrait with only the hint of a leer. He’s been a surprisingly good teacher actually and Harry’s open to giving him a chance as long as he doesn’t catch him wanking at his boyfriend. Percy’s portrait only shows his body from the chest up, but Merlin only knows what he could be getting up to beneath the frame. He can lift his hands from his lap to do spells, so he must have something under there.
Neville just rolls his eyes and resumes marking. Everyone is used to Draco being a twitchy, moody bastard after all.
It’s easy to sense when Draco’s getting prickly again, his eyes narrow and his upper lip starts to come up. Harry’s sure he’s going to be shouted at or something. He bucks his hips and lets his cock scrape against Draco’s and silences any arguments with a kiss.
It’s agonising waiting for Eddie to finally stand up, picking up the two empty teacups. Potter stops him at the door and keeps chatting, eyes flicking over to Draco in a way that lets him know he’s doing it on purpose.
Jonathan Rigby, who is underage, is eyeing up The Hogs Head with a small gaggle of sixth years, but it’s not Harry’s problem because he has the day off and it’s glorious. “Heads up there, Nev,” he says while giving the other man a nod.
By now the snake has probably found its way to Draco’s cock where it’s been instructed to form a ring around the base and spiral around the shaft to form a cage. If Draco thinks he can leave Harry with blue balls then two can play at that game.
It was a good job. Or at least, a job he was good at. He hadn’t always been. It was difficult to play by the rules at first, to learn the handbook and quote the regulations when all he wanted to do was go off gut and instinct alone, but he’d adapted.
Draco lets his ball drop from his mouth and runs his lips up Harry’s cock to the tip and dips in with his tongue. It’s practically worshipful, the way Draco sucks cock. It’s opposite Harry’s usual technique which usually involves going at it as hard and fast as he possibly can. Draco’s sweet as a kitten, with little licks and sucks, never taking Harry too deep but never giving Harry a chance to notice the lack of depth because one hand stays so busy at his base, with its caressing and squeezing and pumping.
Draco looks damned pleased with himself too. “You’re amazing, Harry,” he says. “So perfect for me. Let me show you. I’ve got to have you.”
Harry’s mouth felt very dry. He hadn’t thought Malfoy was in town this weekend so he hadn’t given a second thought to walking past the shop. It was simply the shorter route from Sergio’s to his own flat. Would Malfoy believe that he’d fancied an early morning walk? Or that he’d had some sort of business meeting earlier that morning and was just coming back from the Métro? But no, Malfoy knew the Métro confused him, he’d never buy that one. “Out,” he said, which might have been the worst thing to say based on the look Malfoy turned on him in return.
Harry’s dick is hard the moment the man opens his polished mahogany door. He doesn’t bother trying to hide it and instead makes a show of adjusting himself as he steps over the threshold.
Harry had been about to ask what on earth Malfoy meant when one of the artists broke away from the crowd and gestured to them both with the clear purpose of drawing their picture. Harry stared at the man for a full-horrified minute before he hurriedly shook his head. The artist shrugged and moved on to the next table.
“Stop that,” admonishes Potter, biting the other cheek. Draco’s only too happy to obey, especially since Potter rewards him with a long lick right against his arsehole that’s still pulsing from the cleaning spell he’s just used. He alternates his movements with broad licks and little tickling probing with the tip of his tongue. It’s absolute heaven, especially after the day Draco’s had and he is only too happy to relax into the pleasure of it.
There were good guys and there were bad guys, and his job was to catch the bad ones. Only, the thing was, sometimes it was hard to tell who was a bad guy. They weren’t all mask wearing Dark Arts practitioners. Also, sometimes he caught the bad ones, but in the wrong way, or he caught them too soon and didn’t have all the evidence he needed. Or he caught them but the jury would decide they weren’t that bad, not really. And even if they were convicted some of them only got a few years of Azkaban, or worse, a fine, and they were back at it again.
A brique noise,a clipping of impatient feet, made Harry look up again. Malfoy was staring at him and sighing heavily.
“You want us both to do it then?” he asks. He’s not sure what he’d say. The idea of losing control and spiralling into desperation does not sound at all appealing. How annoyed will Draco be if he refuses?
“I just don’t see why you can’t just choose one of them and settle down.” Ron’s already red in the cheeks, a clear sign he’s had too much, so Harry doesn’t take offense.
The lotion is faintly scented by something Harry’s never been able to identify, but it’s light and pleasing, and only slightly feminine, and the scent seems to linger on his skin long after he leaves Draco’s house.
Draco is writhing on the floor, blind and mute, probably trying to get Harry’s attention with the way he’s thrusting his hips up. Harry drops to his knees beside him and runs a hand down Draco’s chest, stopping when he finds the hard piece of flesh between his legs. Draco’s mouth drops open as he says something and thrusts up into Harry’s hand.
“I’ve sent Draco his Christmas gift already, of course, but I find the Muggle post to be so impersonal,” she was looking at the chocolates in her hand. “Would you mind terribly if I sent something along with you? I assume you are returning to Paris soon, correct?”
“He’s insatiable,” says Percy. “Can’t let him go without a proper seeing to, even for even a night. I find it’s best to keep the randy ones occupied or they get themselves into all kinds of mischief.”
Potter wants them to be boyfriends. He also wants him to start calling him Harry. Potter also wants to do things like have Draco spend the night in his rooms or to give each other goodbye kisses.
He stepped over to the counter and righted the box as best he could, smoothing down the red paper and adjusting the green ribbon. Narcissia’s note was bent, but there was nothing he could do about that. So with one last brush of his fingertips he retreated from the package and from the shop.
“Shit,” says Harry, scrambling to start collecting them all. He’s tucked them in too firmly to use magic and two more go off before he’s managed to gather them. Once they’ve all fallen to the duvet, he spells them back into their smoking box.
Draco scowls at him, he has no intention at all. “Let’s get this over with,” he says instead. “We have a meeting starting any minute now.”
“Vulgar,” Draco snaps, but there’s a hint of a smile on his lips now. “Another no, no for the little woman.”
“Good boy,” says Harry, and even though he’s stroking his hands through Draco’s hair like he’s a well-behaved pup, Draco can’t help but lean into the praise.
Despite the fantastic orgasm Draco had provided, at the reminder of the portrait’s presence he’d gone all huffy again.
Draco speeds up, just slightly, uses his free hand to give Harry’s balls a little squeeze, presses a finger just behind, then trails back between Harry’s thighs and teases against the tight whirl of Harry’s hole. It’s the light touch, there, between his cheeks that does it for Harry, just as Draco takes him down until his tip is pressed just shy of Draco’s throat. That, and the whine as Draco’s hand in his trousers as he takes himself over the edge.
“Sorry my arse isn’t fun enough for you, Potter,” says Draco. Then he stops and carefully sets his fork back down. It doesn’t even clatter as it hits the plate, Harry doesn’t know how he does it. “Actually... I know something that… could be sort of fun.”
Draco gives his ear one last dirty suck before he’s moving down towards Harry’s cock. His hand doesn’t falter for a moment, jerking up and down at a rapid pace. He just barely makes it in time to close those tight lips around Harry’s cockhead and Harry whimpers at the sudden warmth sucking the cum directly from his slit.
“You could have waited for me.” He says, sounding sulky to his own ears. He allows Draco to pull him down onto the bed.
There are sixty-three cards in a deck of Exploding Snap, Draco doesn’t think Harry’s going to use them all, but he loses count after counting to nineteen when the card on the small of his back explodes.
“We aren’t friends, Potter,” hisses Draco, but since he’s depositing a small wrapped present in his hand it’s a little hard to believe him.
No, definitely not, thought Harry,  just far too young for him. “I think I’m too old for one night stands.” He said instead.
Draco’s wand is back in his robes before Harry has processed what’s happened, but damn does he feel the stinging hex when it hits his hip.
His arse is dripping already, where he’s loosened himself up with his fingers and toys, laying on his bed thinking about Potter’s thick cock. The black plug he’s used to hold himself open is a bit smaller than Potter, and it slips easily from his hole. He gives it a few more thrusts, teasing himself, and showing Potter just how wet and open he is.
“Like a treat!” Percy calls. Harry’s turned him to face the wall, so his voice is a little muffled, and a little annoyed.
“You think I want a wife,” Draco says as he pushes the frock from his shoulders, allowing it to slip over his frame to pool onto the floor.
“Wait, Malfoy, I’m just—” he doesn’t get any more words out, holds himself off long enough to pull nearly out of Draco’s mouth. Draco, who tilts his head back, looks Harry in the eye and lets his tongue cradle the tip of his cock as he starts to come.
Harry’s sips at his coffee as he examines his morning post. He has three new missives today. Two are new business, recommendations from past clients, but the third is printed on green parchment.
The new flat was purposefully Muggle and larger than he really needed with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen, dining room, sitting room, and a balcony. It came furnished with just enough Ikea cast offs to make the place look habitable, and with stark white walls stained by cigarette smoke from the last inhabitant. There were two different sets of wine glasses in the cupboards, and only one chipped mug, but Harry had a microwave, a television, an electric razor, and a purpose.
“I used my hands,” continues Draco. “Combed through my hair, and covered every inch of my body. Felt so nice and warm under the water, the soap was so slick against my skin I couldn’t resist. My nipples were so hard on my chest, I had to give them a tease, run over them with my soapy fingers until my cock grew hard.”
“Yeah to their own advantage,” quipped Harry, well aware they were only skimming the surface of a deeper conversation he wasn’t keen to have.
“Just a taste,” says Draco just before he flicks his tongue, the tip just barely touching Harry’s cock head, dipping into the slit there and wiggling just so.
“Remind him to try a little harder next time,” continued Draco. “Or at least buy the man some stockings.”
His hand shakes as he starts to grind the bicorn horn. There’s no need for delicacy here, which is good because Potter’s discovered the use of his other hand. One finger sinks into his hole and is quickly followed by two, followed by a slow stretch and scissoring motion.
Malfoy, had surprisingly been on time, even though Harry had expected him to saunter up twenty minutes late if he showed up at all. Instead he’d been waiting out front with a newspaper tucked under one arm and a cream-colored messenger bag slung across his chest.
“Morning, Malfoy,” he says, reaching for the teapot to cover up how giddy he is that Draco’s sitting next to him at the breakfast table.
He’s almost got it, the horn isn’t crushed as fine as he’d like it, but just a bit longer and it will be good enough.
When the loneliness got to be too much he went for walks. He mapped out his neighborhood, noting the location of the markets, numerous cafés, the florist, the pharmacy, and the ice cream parlor. He discovered new routes to interesting landmarks and window shopped as he walked along. Sometimes he stopped for a cup of coffee, but never at the same café twice. He even sat in on a yoga session in the gardens around the Louvre. It hadn’t made him feel relaxed at all, only sore and old.
Potter stops trying to hold himself back, grips Draco by the hips and pounds into him. It’s a struggle to keep his feet planted, but Draco braces himself and takes it. “Harder,” he demands. His voice is muffled by the table and his hair is falling into his eyes, but Potter hears and starts panting as he sets a punishing pace.
She ignores him and continues on. “How many of them in this room have you had? How many have experienced the pleasure of your company?”
When Draco lets a long minute pass and still doesn’t say anything, Harry sighs and picks up another bucket. “Fire crabs next.”
Draco snickers. “Made it to the loo then did you? And who cares, that sweater was horrible on you, baggy and ill-fitting. I’ll buy you a new one.”
“Yes, but you’ve written replies agreeing to all of them.” Her pointed finger lands on a second stack. They are indeed replies he hasn’t yet sent off.
“He hates me,” said Harry in a reflex. Then he thought about it and changed his mind. “I mean, he used to hate me, now I think we’re too old for that. He tolerates me.”
“Ron, you promised you wouldn’t bring this up,” Hermione adds, tight lipped. She gestures meaningfully to the babe on her hip and rolls her eyes when Ron fails to grasp the significance and plows onward.
In April Harry decided he’d been unemployed too long. He’d left the Auror’s nearly a year and a half ago, and although he’d enjoyed being unemployed for a bit, it was time for a new challenge. He’d been unsure about working for a wizarding establishment, but his only work experience had been in law enforcement and he had enjoyed it.
It’s impossible to keep a tight seal around the cock in his mouth this way or do anything more than take it. He keeps his jaw slack, and tongue out, a wide messy hole for Harry to fuck into. He’s completely powerless, overcome with the sensation of the beads wiggling inside him, cock beginning to hit the back of his throat as he hangs immobilized.
Malfoy jumped and nearly turned the hose on Harry in his surprise. He didn’t look any more pleased with Harry than he did with the geranium.
Harry gasps as he spills into Draco’s mouth, holds his cock so it’s just barely pressing inside, wanting Draco to taste it. Taste him. He spurts again, then twice more, until his dick is only letting out a pathetic little twitch against that soft tongue. When he pulls out Draco makes a show of closing his mouth and swallowing, arching his head back so Harry can follow the sensual movement of his throat.
They really should get up and have a proper shower, tidy up the Dueling room and get ready for lessons tomorrow, but for now Harry’s happy to lay here and let Draco hold him.
Surprisingly Potter shakes his head. “Oh you’ll make it up to me, but that’s not what I want.” He tosses the last steak and forces Draco to wait while he washes up.
Sometimes Potter is such a child. He shrugs one shoulder and pushes his bottom lip out. “You could come to my rooms. Tonight.”
Draco can’t possibly, not with that mouth running gentle kisses down his cheeks. He leans forward and spreads his legs a bit, cock catching on his robes as it bobs. Potter’s hands grip his bare arse cheeks to pull them apart and Draco whines and reaches a hand down to palm his cock through his robe.
And when Draco eventually opens his eyes to look into Harry’s he suddenly gets it. “Oh,” he says, somewhat stupidly.
“You may want to run a rope from the wrists to the ankles to help him hold his arms up. You can leave it without it if you like, but it would be a bit more of an advanced position, the arms will naturally fall forward causing additional strain on the shoulders.”
“Undo your trousers and I’ll tell you about my night,” he says and Harry doesn’t have to be told twice.
Draco tosses the garment onto the floor and works at the bows that secure Harry’s panties to his hips. “For now I want this. Now, tell me how wet you are, how ready for me you are,” his lips are working their way towards Harry’s now.
In the end, it was Hermoine who made the biggest difference out of them all. Hermoine, who worked her arse off to learn the system and get herself promoted to the DMLE and start making changes from within.
Harry cradles Draco’s face with his palm as he moves his thumb in gentle thrusting motions. Draco’s cheek is slightly prickly beneath his fingers. He must have been worried to have forgotten grooming charms this morning, he’s normally so meticulous. Slowly, slowly, with Harry’s fingers stroking his cheek, Draco relaxes. His eyes fall shut as he concentrates on lavishing attention on Harry’s thumb and his body presses Harry’s against the wall.
Potter just shrugs as if these are inconsequential things. “So what? I’ve got my boyfriend's butt plug on the shelf, you think I care what anyone thinks?” And there’s that word again, boyfriend. Only this time Draco rather likes it.
“Clothes off, shower, return in no more than twenty minutes,” is the lazy dismissal he gets. For all the bored tone Draco Malfoy is affecting, Harry knows he’s expecting obedience. Draco knows what he wants, and he wants the complete fantasy. Harry has no doubt that if the illusion is broken for even one moment he’ll find himself tossed out onto the rainy streets of Kensington.
He stops trying to hold back his tears and lets his body relax. Merlin fuck. Potter’s arranged this on purpose. Eddie can’t see him.
“Bloody hell, Malfoy,” said Harry as he looked around to see if anyone had taken offense to their exchange. “I would never say that to someone!”
Next Draco opens one of the drawers on the vanity. Row upon row of small glass bottles lay inside in a rainbow of colors, though there are a large number of darker, bloodier reds. Tonight he’s chosen a soft petal pink, when the lid is uncapped Harry can see it’s called Rosy Lips.
Malfoy looked wounded, his mouth was opening and shutting in indignation. “I’m always alone!” He said finally.
Draco shouldn’t distract him, doesn't want him to burn, so he waits until Potter has finished distributing the dead fish and has washed up again before he tells him; “No.”
“I know what you need,” says Potter, blowing against the wet strip. Draco’s cock jumps in his hand. “Hands off now.”
“Couple things then,” says Draco, sensing his approval before it’s even voiced. “I consent to do anything we’ve done before, and you might need these.”
Harry placed the bottle he’d been looking at back on the shelf and took the bottle on offer and placed it in his hand basket alongside the cut of salmon he was planning on purchasing.
“Where about?” asked Malfoy in a vaguely, passively interested sort of way. He was looking out into the artists, watching as a man in an offset hat drew a picture of a young Asian girl in twin plaits.
Draco is at the desk when Harry walks in, his quill working at a steady pace down the curling scroll. He does not look up as Harry walks in so Harry makes his way to the padded stool at the vanity and looks out the window. The rain is letting up a bit and just a hint of the sunset can be seen peeking through the clouds.
“What have you done with my— potion— Potter—” he follows his last words with three more stinging hexes and Harry knows when to take a hint.
Harry pretends to be temporarily deaf and starts rifling through his armful of papers as if deep in concentration.
It takes a minute for Draco to take stock of his body, and Harry helps by adjusting a knot here and there until he’s comfortable. Then he takes a step back.
“Gross,” laughs Potter, stepping away to rub his ear against his shoulder. He can’t exactly use his gory hands. “I heard you for the first time, Merlin. You’re just going to have to wait.”
The moan elongated into a string of Spanish profanity. Harry still wasn’t sure what most of it meant, but he was pretty sure that ‘duro’ meant harder and he knew ‘rapido’ meant faster. When he started hearing those words with increasing volume and repetition Harry grasped Sergio around the waist, flipped their positions and bore him down into the mattress.
“No, no, don’t, it’s so good, Harry, holy fuck,” he whines. They look down and Draco’s nipples are stiff and pink and it looks like they are being gently squeezed, or apparently, sucked. Draco whines and rests his head at the crook of Harry’s neck. “My cock now, please, please, spell my cock, Harry, please, you’re going to do it for me right?”
Perhaps sensing his hesitation, Draco takes the vial from Harry’s hands and steps closer, into his space, lining their hips up with one another.
Maybe he should tease him about his answer a little more, but looking down at his parted lips Harry can’t resist dipping in for a taste.
“Hello,” says Draco. His expression is reverent, eyes roving across Harry’s face as if taking in every little detail for the first time. He slides his fingers up Harry’s throat, touching his lips, then dancing across his cheekbones. Harry has to close his eyes briefly as he gently traces a thumb across each eyelid.
“Malfoy’s dad’s name is Lucius. It just sounds similar is all,” explained Harry. “Sort of creepy to hear.”
“Aren’t you tired of this?” asked Harry, gesturing to the empty shop, but meaning so much more than that.
By the time he found his way to the cramped kitchen, the boy had a plate set out for him containing two fried eggs and a piece of toast. The compulsory espresso cup sat to the side of the plate.
Malfoy glares at him all through the staff meeting. There’s a muscle twitching in his cheek, but at least the rest of his expression looks more normal now.
“I wasn’t spying on you,” Harry felt the need to make that point very clear. He wasn’t sure he should admit the next, but couldn’t come up with any other reasonable explanation. “I was just curious.” He was also thinking that he had better say something before Malfoy moaned again.
Harry makes a face at the vanity mirror, knowing Draco can’t see, but otherwise does not bother to answer. Sometimes the man can be terribly predictable. Next it’ll be about his shoes…
For one, it’s almost an exact replica of Draco’s own master suite (Harry knows; he’d snooped one afternoon after finishing his shower with precisely 3 minutes to spare). The walls are a rich cream, the furniture heavy and wooden. A sleigh bed dominates the room, covered in various shades of blue and framed on either side by his and her nightstands. A writing table rests in one corner, and a vanity beneath the window. A walk-in closet and an en suite are both attached.
When at last Harry comes back into sight he removes the silencing charm and places the last card inside his mouth.
He’s staring at the cum bubbles though, face in serious contemplation. “I— I kind of want to eat it,” he says.
He doesn’t want to give him the pleasure, but Harry’s watching him and waiting so he whines and glances down. Please turn it off, please take me down.
It’s Draco’s spit that slides against Harry’s hand as he pushes his foreskin back and gives himself a pump. He holds his cock upright and tilts his pelvis forward right in front of Draco’s open mouth. He takes the hint, sucking first one ball then the other into that perfect heat.
Harry smiles sweetly back at him and sips at his own champagne cocktail. “If all you want is someone pretty and silent, why don’t you get a real wife for yourself?”
“There we go.” Potter’s whispering little words into his hair. “So proud of you,” and; “You were so gorgeous.”
The funny thing is, the thing Harry never would have expected, is that he doesn’t care if he’s a bit shit at teaching and that he’s still learning. He doesn’t care that Draco has more experience or when he grabs his lesson plans, or proposals, and starts ripping them to pieces. The thing is, he likes it when Draco does this. When he helps him. When Draco tries to make him better. It means Draco wants him to get better. To be a better teacher. To stay here. At Hogwarts.
A hand that was almost femine in its delicacy slid down Harry’s torso to cup and massage his sac. At the same time the boy lowered his mouth until it was pressed around the base of Harry’s cock. He could feel the spongy tip of his crown being squeezed into the boy’s throat. Then he swallowed. Hard. Fuck, if that wasn’t amazing, Harry thought as he came. Who cared how old the mouth on him was if it could do tricks like that?
He’s concentrating on the quick flicking movement of his wrist that are needed to crush the lacewing flies so he can’t help but jump when Potter’s hands pull his waist back, flush against the unmistakable bulge of a hard prick. Draco’s forced to step back away from the table, as Potter pulls his hips, but thankfully he doesn’t drop his work.
“Why didn’t you say so?” said the woman in perfectly clear English. “I’m sorry, I didn’t know that you did not understand, how rude of you, Draco!” she gave Malfoy a half-hearted push.
“I want you,” pleaded Malfoy and Harry had to shut his eyes and turn away in case that thought tempted him too much. Malfoy reached for him again, and Harry stepped away, heading for the relative safety of the sitting room.
Fortunately, the man is a pleasure to obey, far more gratifying than Calista Monroe, who seems to enjoy watching him do housework in hot pants.
Draco’s staring down at him. Even with his glasses, he can’t tell what he’s thinking. “I thought it was drinks?”
Slowly, he turns back and levitates the last few boxes down so he can have a closer look at the mirror. It’s big, and old, with writing at the top that reads “Erised stra ehru oyt ube carfru oyt on woshi,” which is frankly gibberish. It’s definitely a magical mirror because when Draco looks back into it the scene has changed.
“Merde. No wonder they never told the parents, the Governors would have had a field day with that information. I can’t believe the best Defense teacher we ever had was a Death Eater. Merde.”
Potter pulls his fingers out, stands up and throws Draco’s robes over his back. “Keep going,” he says even as Draco hears the sound of a belt buckle and rustling fabric.
Lily skipped up several minutes later with a bouquet she had made on her own. It contained at least a dozen different types of flowers and barely fit in her tiny hand. Malfoy tossed aside his newspaper and proceeded to advise Lily on how to arrange her collection to the best aesthetic. Several pink ribbons were included in the ordeal and Malfoy was instantly forgiven in Harry’s mind.
“Morning Malfoy,” says Potter. He continues feeding the Thestrals and it’s slightly nauseating to watch them snap the hunks of red meat from the air and rip it to shreds. “Hagrid’s feeling ill so I told him I’d take his chores for the weekend.”
Harry can only nod dumbly and allows himself to be pushed back against Draco’s desk. Draco’s like an octopus, fingers roving through Harry’s chest hair, tickling his sides, stroking up his thighs. Honestly, the sensations are too overwhelming even before Draco brings his mouth into play.
Malfoy shot him an annoyed look. “Of course not, but I work in the flower business, Potter. The only time I have reason to curse anyone out at work is when I’m on the phone with a bride trying to plan her own wedding. You would not believe what they demand a handcrafted bouquet of out of season amaryllis to cost. And really they call me worse things than I call them, so it all works out.”
“Alright!” snaps Harry even as Draco tries to cover it up with a loud. “Thank you, Percy, that will be all!”
The boy’s eyes locked onto him the moment they were revealed, and Harry was rewarded with a particularly hard suck. He moaned and thrust his hips up, wanting to get deeper into that wonderfully, wet mouth.
“Always,” says Draco, voice scratchy with sleep, though he doesn’t argue about being woken up for once, and instead curls into Harry’s chest. He yawns, breath tickling against Harry’s skin, lips brushing him just enough to bring forth goose pimples.
Now Draco is humming, but really he’s staring at himself in the mirror like a bloody canary. “This is definitely not what I expected when I showed you the handcuffs,” he says finally after a long examination. I was thinking about you tying me to the headboard, that sort of thing.”
He doesn’t like the cold shoulder. Not when he knows how lovely, and pliant, and filthy Draco can be. He knows if he can just corner him in private he’ll be on his knees for Harry in under a minute if he’s not bending over and grabbing his ankles. Clearly, Draco knows that too, because it’s been over a week and he’s been very cleverly avoiding all of Hogwarts’ numerous private corners.
Which was how Draco had found himself suspended from the ceiling above his bed with silk ropes wrapped around his body, arms pulled back, legs folded, feet resting on his arse.
Harry awoke to gentle fingertips tracing down his nose. He opened one eye, but the image of Malfoy’s face before his remained bleary. He’d lost his glasses at some point then.
Draco doesn’t have time to answer, he’s at seven hippogryphs and he can’t stop now. Potter rolls his hips, pressing in impossibly further and Draco gasps— “ten hippogryphs! Eleven—”
Potter has to get on his tiptoes to kiss his stretched lips. He wipes the tears from the corners of Draco’s eyes and unhooks the gag. Draco immediately tries to bite him, but Potter’s too quick.
“Is this for me?” he asked with such delight that Harry didn’t even complain when the chocolates were ripped from beneath his arm without so much as a hello.
Draco’s wasting no time wherever he is. Is he somewhere nearby? Or has he made it back to the castle? Wherever he is, he’s clearly found himself a toy, Harry has no reason to suspect it’s anything but a toy that is battering his prostate. Draco likes it much rougher than he does, Harry knows, and it’s almost difficult to track all the different sensations. Harry can feel his own hand on his cock, struggling to keep up with Draco’s pace, but then when it feels like another hand joins his, stroking in tandem it’s mind-blowing.
Then his nimble hands are working their way into Harry’s trousers, undoing his zip, and pulling his cock out through the opening in his boxers. Harry lets out a hiss as the cool air hits his heated skin, but stops Draco from enveloping him in his warm mouth with an outstretched hand.
Harry’s groin clenches at the thought. Yeah, he definitely likes that, likes hearing the words out of Draco’s filthy mouth even more. “Absolutely,” he agrees.
Draco eyes him for a moment and then slides down to cuddle Harry close. This time Harry doesn’t resist, let’s Draco spider his hands in between his shirt buttons and throw a leg over his. “Make it up to you?” he whispers, pressing his face to the skin behind Harry’s ear.
“You realise this is blackmail don’t you former-Auror-Potter?” he says, but his mouth is wet and open and ready for him.
“It makes all the difference,” hisses Draco. Why can’t he understand that? “You think we can be seen together out of these halls? You think the world would take it easy on me if they thought I was corrupting their Savior? You think we could have what— a relationship?”
Probably, Draco wants both legs fancy and also to be done right this instant, but he’s going to have to choose.
Harry scowled, but that too felt like the right sort of response so he didn’t fight it. But when he didn’t immediately answer Malfoy took another bite of his desert that was so enormous that they didn’t speak for a number of minutes.
Malfoy didn’t seem to notice his unease. “Shit, Potter. It means, shit.” He stared at Harry in contemplation and took a deep sip of his espresso. “If you’re going to live here you should probably know a couple good curses. Quarreling is practically mandatory in Paris and you’re going to get yelled at sooner or later. So, repeat after me: Vouz avez plein de merde.”
“Thought you’d like that,” says Draco. “Also, the antidote,” he passes a second slim vial into Harry’s hand and wraps his fingers around it. “I’ll close my eyes, you’ll need to hide it. If I know where it is after I’ve taken the Amortenia I’ll try to get rid of it so I can keep you.”
Lauren’s flat was decorated in Christmas cheer, and Harry had on the scarf that Matthew had given to him the night before. They had celebrated early since Matthew was returning to the states to celebrate with his sister and nieces, and Harry was leaving for England next week to celebrate with his children. He’d given Matthew a new shaving kit and a book on French politics that Matthew had shown an interest in on one their walks.
He screams into his gag and hopes the bastard can hear him. It would serve him right to be caught. Maybe he can claim that Potter’s some kind of sex fiend. Well.. he is a sex fiend, but maybe…
With the armoire out the way, they can get at the boxes in the corner, the ones McGonagall had been looking for to pull the credentials of an old student that the Ministry has requested information on.
By the time Harry had turned onto his street, alone now, with nothing but dirty hands and a paper wrapper left from his kebab, he was smiling foolishly. Life felt good for once. He lived in an amazing neighborhood, in an amazing city, he had great friends, and a boyfriend who cared about him, Ginny didn’t feel like killing him anymore and he was invited to Christmas dinner with his children, and wasn’t that halo around those street lights absolutely gorgeous?
“Thought what?” Harry continues. “That I’d spread my legs for you like a whore when this engagement was finished?”
The bicorn horn is stubborn, it keeps slipping away. Draco grips mortar and pestle desperately and cries out. He’s practically jerking off the pestle which probably doesn’t help anything, but Potter’s tongue and two fingers are busy stuffing themselves in his hole and there’s a hand giving his cock the barest hint of friction and he wants more.
Experimentally, he drops his head and lets the necklace fall to the floor. Instantly, his body is his own again. His arse feels relaxed, yes, and his cock is hard, but there are no more phantom hands teasing his chest, no hand playing between his thighs.
It’s not hard to centre himself, to dip into that hidden well of calm and balance on the edge he needs to invade another’s mind. Everything around him blurs and he shifts all his focus on staring deep into Potter’s bright eyes, lifts his wand and says; “Legilimens.”
Harry had dropped his things off at his flat, and then decided to walk down to Malfoy’s shop with his parcel under his arm. If he hurried, he could catch Malfoy before he went home for the night.
Then he has to pause to drop a peck on Draco’s pouting lips. “If you like,” he says. “Besides, you were the one who was complaining about not getting to see the finished result the other night.”
He and his partner Adrien got on well, and Adrien took Harry to Wizarding Paris for the first time since Harry’s first visit to Paris years and years ago. He took to wearing robes again, and apparated out of his flat in the morning and back at night. He spent less and less time in his neighborhood, but still made a point to meet Kate in the park on Sundays now it was sunny enough to do so again. And he still did dinner with Marie on Tuesdays, and he started attending the night yoga class instead of the day one.
“But for now… dinner? In my rooms?” he asks. Potter grins and kisses him again. Draco sucks his lip and smiles into the kiss. “And bring the plug.”
Harry flicks his eyes over Draco. He’s in his pyjamas, the toff silk ones with his initials monogrammed on the chest, and his hair is wet from a recent shower, but he doesn’t look the least bit wound up. He’s relaxing casually back into the pillows, all soft and touchable.
“Fuck off,” he snaps. He has less than a minute left to get the lacewing flies in if he wants full potency. He tries to step forward again, but Potter’s hands are tight on his waist. “Potter,” he growls and breaks away.
He was right. Harry had followed Malfoy without a thought. He stopped instantly at the realization, coming to a freeze just beside the fishmonger. The smell was unfortunate.
His breathing is finally returning to normal, though his nose and throat still ache from being so abruptly filled with water. Harry sniffs and rolls over to face Draco. “You like me,” he says. Draco rolls his eyes and turns his head so Harry can see.
Before Harry had even made it back to his flat his mobile buzzed with a message from Matthew proclaiming that he’d had a great night and couldn’t wait to see him again. Harry smiled at the message and read it twice more before falling asleep.
When it’s time to lift Draco, he’s as careful as possible, lifting his leg’s slowly up and then together until he’s hanging inverted from his ankles, pressed together from calf to thigh. Harry checks his arms, to make sure they have the support they need and are laying as comfortably as possible against Draco’s back.
He’s been weightless and floaty under the featherlight charm as if every muscle in his body is supported by a cloud and as Harry releases the charm on his torso his middle sinks like a stone as he feels the strain of the rope around him. Next are his legs, which are tied tightly, shin to thigh. He can feel a slight strain, and the pull on his ankles, but it’s not too uncomfortable. When his arms are released it’s another story. They’re pulled back at a slightly difficult angle for him to maintain and they are supporting enough of his weight, thank you very much, but Harry follows the release with a muscle-relaxing charm and then it’s much more tolerable.
Draco huffs, blowing his fringe out of his face as he works. He complains profusely whenever he helps Harry, but there’s an intensity that’s almost pleasure on his face as he works. It’s a look that Harry is becoming well familiar with.
Harry chokes out a gasp, because dear Merlin, he knows Felix Rosier and yeah, he’s definitely fit. “That’s Charlie Weasley’s boyfriend,” he tells Draco. “They’re both dragonologists.”
“It sounds like you’ve been going from relationship to relationship for a long time. When was the last time you were alone?”
Malfoy dug his hands into the front of Harry’s shirt and held on as if Harry might run away. “Yes, but only because I started sleeping with my French teacher. I stayed with him after that.”
Harry laughed. Good was an understatement. He reached a hand up to pull the boy’s head down and rewarded him with a lazy kiss. “Good, yes,” he said once the boy pulled away. “Muy bueno.”
“Twenty-two hippogriffs, twenty-three hippogryphs,” he whispers to keep track, can’t help pushing his arse back into Potter’s face while a hand slides into his brief and gives his cock a firm squeeze. The potion gurgles along with Draco’s moan and at last, he reaches the thirtieth hippogryph and he can wave his wand to complete this stage of the potion.
“Come on,” gasps Potter, hand already flying over his cock. He’s always a little bit rough with himself, moving far faster than Draco would.
Malfoy seemed to love the sound of his own voice, but he didn’t talk about anything concrete. He complained about the rising cost of taxes, but never mentioned his parents. He goaded Harry about his sexless life, but never asked about Ginny even though Harry had told him he was recently divorced. Their past was never brought up, the war was certainly never even alluded to. It was just the here and now, and Harry found it to be surprisingly refreshing.
Malfoy grunted in response, and continued scrolling through his phone. Harry left without a goodbye.
“Right,” he said as he hopped off what he had come to think of as his stool. “See you around, Malfoy.”
Draco’s already rutting gently against his hip, his mouth working at Harry’s shoulder, but he lifts his head up enough to answer. “I thought you knew by now? I’m terribly rich.”
“Does it have a cooker though?” he asks. A lot of magical houses don’t, he’s discovered. This is why so many witches and wizards he knows don’t know how to cook properly until they get their wands. “Or do the elves just do everything with magic?” Draco suspiciously doesn’t answer, which either means he doesn’t like the answer, or he doesn’t know. “Grimmauld Place has a cooker. A whole proper kitchen even.”
“Alright, fine.” His tone was mild, but Harry could still see Malfoy rolling his eyes. “I spoke French, and someone offered me a free place to live and since your Ministry,” he shot Harry a suspicious look. “Saw fit to strip me of my inheritance, and all of my money, free, seemed like a pretty easy decision for me.”
She’s watching as Draco and Neville work together to carry a heavy armoire into the corridor. They’re using magic, of course, Draco’s holding the thing steady while Neville directs it. It’s a finicky old thing, but they get it settled in the end.
Draco’s form is impeccable, he’s a fantastic technical dueler. Harry’s the opposite, the practical wins in his book every time, but then again he’s spent most of his life duelling for his life so by the time he’d had time to go and learn the basics he’d already defeated Voldemort. His instructors had been less picky then.
“Just like that, just a little more,” encourages Harry, trying not to thrust too deeply. “Fuck the mouth on you. I’ve missed this. Your perfect fucking mouth.” He’s too far gone to censor himself, to pretend he hasn’t been thinking of this exact scenario for the past two months and hasn't been wanking off at the thought of making Malfoy go all soft and desperate for him.
“Oh,” said Lauren and for a moment she stared off into nothingness. “That is very disturbing now that you mention it.” Lauren shook her head and continued. “What I was going to say is that he is no good because he’s married.”
He sinks into the perfect wet heat, relaxes his hold on Draco’s hair and lets him go for it. Draco hums and moans around his cock as if he’s been given a real treat, sliding further and further up his shaft. Draco has a terrible gag reflex so he never tries to fully take Harry’s cock, but that’s no matter when he lavishes such delicate attention on Harry’s cock with his tongue.
Potter reaches around and gives him a stroke, all the way up to his tip. He plays with his foreskin for a moment, rolling it over Draco’s head the way he likes before pushing it down and repeating the stroking motion. This time Draco hisses as the calloused skin strokes against his sensitive tip, nail pressing just slightly into the slit there.
“There we go,” says Harry, pressing the thumb in slightly and humming as Draco closes his lips around it, giving him a little suck. “I’ll give you your potion back, Malfoy, don’t you worry. Only if I’m going to do such a favour for you I think it’s only fair you do something for me, don’t you think?”
Draco wants to dig his fingers into that ridiculous mop, but he does know better, Potter hates when he gets handsy and he doesn’t want to ruin this, so he obeys without hesitation. Anything to get those cocksucking lips closer. He throws his arms out to grip the back of the seat and holds on.
Malfoy made a vaguely interested noise, but accepted his piece of chocolate torte, several seconds later, with more glee. “So then, why spy on me?” He asked just before taking an inhumanely large bite.
“What I’m saying,” Draco interrupts. “Is I like fucking you. For some reason, I even like working with you. I wouldn’t mind spending more time together.”
Before he was ready, Harry was sitting in Albus’ favorite Thai restaurant, celebrating his birthday and his children’s last night in Paris. They had a portkey to catch tomorrow afternoon and he wouldn’t see them again until September 1st when he would make the trek to London to put James and Albus on the train. He was celebrating with all three of his children, but Malfoy had refused the invitation that Lily had extended. Apparently he had a date with his boyfriend.
It had been a long time since he’d had to actively try to pull. When he’d first started seeing men he’d snuck into Muggle London before he realized there were a number of discreet wizards willing to do anything for ‘the Chosen One.’
Draco pulls his knees up, angling Harry forward as he fucks himself on Draco’s cock. Harry moans at the new angle, Draco’s cock pushes deeper. “Face,” he says. “I want it on my face.”
“Well,” smirks Draco, laying back. “I might have needed to blow some steam off after detention today. Francis and Frankie did a horrendous job on the Dreamless Sleep I had them brewing, so I had to stay after and finish it myself. And they arrived after eating a whole bowl of Chuckling Cherries which was a joy, I can tell you.”
With a loud sigh to belay what an effort on his part the action was, Malfoy pulled his body up off the counter. “I know. I’m not talking about sex, Potter,” for some reason Harry’s name came out sounding exactly like ‘idiot.’ “Lucas stood me up on Friday. And this was the second time this week. And it was my birthday. And he turned off his phone. And he hasn’t responded to any of my messages.”
Potter laughs and pumps the vibrator in and out a few times. “Lovely and wet,” he says. “You’re making obscene sounds down here too, you know.”
Potter huffs, pulls off Draco’s back, and then starts fucking him in time with Draco’s counting. Draco wants to smack him, but he’s already watching the potion, counting, and oh yes, being fucked, and he can’t handle anymore damn it.
Since the divorce their relationship had healed somewhat, through short visits and long floo conversations. Since Harry had moved to Paris in the early spring, the floo conversations had stopped, but he’d exchanged numerous letters with his sprog and sent a mobile phone to Ginny so that he could talk to his children on the rotary in his new flat. He called everyday, but Lily was the only one who actually wanted to talk so often.
Lily and Albus exchanged grins and scampered away, James rolled his eyes and continued on in a fashionably slow pace.
“Out,” repeated Malfoy, looking appropriately skeptical. Then he snorted, threw down the still running hosepipe and stomped back into his corner shop.
Draco nodded and folded his arms across his chest. His tongue was pressed between his lips. “See you, Harry.”
The smooth skin of Harry’s shaft soothes his burnt tongue and it’s fantastic to have something to concentrate on while the cards snap and crackle. He has to try not to clench his jaw when they go off, to keep his mouth good and gentle for Harry. He keeps his lips wrapped around his teeth just in case.
And they did indeed leave the table and round the corner of the café hand in hand so Harry tried to put the images he had just witnessed from his mind. Abandoned once more to his quiet solidarity, he turned his attention to finishing his untouched espresso so he could get the hell back to his boring, yet predictable flat.
His longtime friend makes a noise of agreement from the couch, but does not look up from her reading material. It is only after Harry has put away his groceries and returned to the sitting room, coffee and newspaper in hand, that he notices what she is reading.
Harry forces himself not to clench his buttocks together or to thrust his pelvis up as he desires to do. He needs the scene as much as Draco does now, needs to see it to its eventual conclusion. He won’t do anything to ruin the illusion at this point.
“Adequate,” he declares. “You’ve left a few tails, and your patterns are not entirely symmetrical, but not bad for the first time. Now, are you going to suspend from multiple points, the legs and arms for instance? Or just one?”
Harry avoided looking at Malfoy for a bit longer, but when he looked up Malfoy was staring out the balcony window. “I don’t want to leave here while I’m this angry with you.”
“For work,” Draco reminds him. He checks his pocket watch. He has enough time for one more cup of tea and to listen to Potter’s sulk.
He sits back to see. And strangely, very strangely, two little shimmery-white bubbles are floating beside them. “Is that—”
“Yeah, I’m training some devil’s snare for you as we speak, Potter. I’m trying to convince it to suffocate you in your sleep.”
And okay, yes, when Harry holds his cheeks and gives him the gentlest of kisses Draco feels pretty fucking proud of himself too.
Potter tuts and massages the skin at the base of Draco’s stomach, avoiding his cock. Draco doesn’t think he could handle it if he touched his cock right now. “One more,” he says. “You can do it. One more.”
“Fuck, Malfoy,” shouts Potter, finally as riled up as Draco. “What do you want me to say, that I haven’t already? I like you. I like fucking you. I like spending time with you. I want to spend more time with you. What’s wrong with that?”
Malfoy snorted. “Not everyone is as saintly honest as you, Potter. Daniel is just trying to make a living.”
Harry already knows what he’s going to see. He’s seen it, and ignored it, countless times before. It’s ugly, and scared over in thick red welts, representing all the horrible things that he’s had to overcome in his life. The Dark Mark on his lover's arm.
“It’s not though is it?” asked Harry. Nothing about the place was magical in a wands-and-wizards sort of a way. Maybe there was another type of magic going on, but it wasn’t one Harry had seen before.
It felt fucking amazing and all Harry wanted to do was coat the boy in come, but his orgasm still eluded him. There was something wrong with the situation. Sergio’s was young and gorgeous, and his arse was amazing, but another face kept floating through his mind.
For some reason Harry’s heart had sunk at the first mention of ‘years,’ though he did not want to question why. “What’s so bad about him? Malfoy seems pretty happy.”
Draco blinks at him, trying to keep the tears in the corner of his eyes from falling. Harry reaches out to grab his wrist, even if it’s the one with the mark on it, and tugs Draco over, making him roll onto his side.
Harry’s own lips and eyes were open. One set panting, the other drinking in the sight of the slim, brown boy bouncing up and down on his cock. He reached out and pinched a pebbled nipple just to see the boy’s lips separate for a moan.
“From your mother,” Harry hastened to add. He fingered the fringe of his new Christmas scarf and tried to think of Matthew.
“I’m sure you do,” says Draco dryly, but the tension is leaking from the room and the warmth is back in his voice again.
There’s an easy solution to this as they both have mouths and cocks, but then Percy pipes up and says. “There’s always the sucking spell.”
“Could be worse,” he points out. “Could have taken Playwitches offer to become a centrefold couldn’t I?” He waggles his brows and leans closer to Hermoine until Ron has had enough and pushes him back.
Harry glances out over the ever watching assembly of students. “You’re going to scare the first years,” he says.
There’s a litany of words spilling from Draco’s silent lips. Either begging for more, or cursing Harry’s name, either is equally plausible. Harry gives the vibrator one last twist and then swings his legs over Draco’s hips, grinding their cocks together. He moans and rubs himself against Draco’s pretty pink cock. It’s longer than his but narrower, and his skin is much paler next to Harry’s.
He had the boys and Lily for Boxing Day, so he booked a room in a suitably lavish London hotel. They ordered as much room service as they could eat and Lily spent a full hour jumping on the bed trying to touch the ceiling. The boys had been immediately distracted by the complimentary game console, and stayed up far beyond their bedtime battling it out in some sort of shooting game.
Draco takes great care in warming the substance in his hands before reaching out and massaging it into Harry’s skin, first up each of his calves, then beneath the edge of his robe into his thighs. By the time Draco’s untying the cotton robe and pulling the ends apart Harry is hard again and leaking against his belly.
He has to explain what he wants carefully, but the snake isn’t alive, so it is very good at obeying. Probably, he could walk away now for complete deniability, but he wants to watch.
Draco adds the second leech to the cauldron and counts to five hippogriffs in his head then adds the third. He makes the mistake of looking up— three hippogriffs, four hippogriffs— Potter is standing on the other side of the table now looking curiously into the potion.
It was gibberish, but Malfoy was looking at him, and Harry wasn’t a Gryffindor for no nothing so he took a deep breath and said what he hoped sounded vaguely like ‘vous avez plein de merde,’ but probably didn’t.
Harry’s mouth goes a bit dry at that, he suddenly, really, really likes the idea of tying Draco’s hands away.
With great enthusiasm Harry thrust into the tight heat beneath him. Sergio gave out a long whine and hooked his legs over Harry’s shoulders, angling his arse for deeper penetration. Harry held onto the slim hips and pulled them towards his body.
“Are you going to tell me what you’re doing here?” Harry asked once they were both seated on the only two stools in the kitchen.
“What are you—” he says, he’s losing count, which is annoying, but Potter is down on his knees behind him tugging at the end of his robes.
Rosy Lips are dusted across his nails as Draco delicately holds each finger still for the slim brush. He knows he’s not supposed to move, but Harry tilts his head just slightly so he can better see the intense concentration on the other man’s face as he works. Each miniscule movement of the brush captures all of Draco’s energies, each stroke precise in every way.
“Thanks for playing delivery boy, Potter,” drawled Malfoy as he turned away. He tossed the chocolates onto the counter without a second look, he was already headed for the back room again. “See you around.”
Harry shrugs. He does not say it’s because he likes the money nearly as much as he likes the sex. “So how much have I made this month then?”
“I want it,” says Draco, but he doesn’t mention the potion at all and reaches for Harry’s belt, knocking Harry’s hands out of the way for access. “Guess I’m going to have to give it to you then, Potter. I’m going to make it so, so good for you.”
Malfoy’s mouth opened, but no words came forth. He bit his lips together again and turned away in thought. “I’m not that cross,” he said after a moment of consideration.
“Your perfect cock sucking mouth,” moans Harry as he thrusts his hips even though Draco can’t do much more than bob his head and work his tongue to participate. His fingers itch to reach for Harry as they normally do, but they’re tied back and out of reach, so instead he squeezes them together and focuses on sucking firmly. “Merlin,” breathes Harry as Draco creates a vacuum seal, sucking down the precum on Harry’s tip, dipping his tongue into the slit for an extra taste.
Malfoy just shrugged and leaned against the back of his chair. “I’ve used that one at least three times this week alone. Bet you don’t make it through the month without it.”
“Why?” asked Lauren, clearly not understanding. Perhaps she did not know as much about Malfoy as Harry had thought.
It seemed perfectly natural then to lean forward and kiss the man that was still entwined in his arms. Malfoy was sweet and pliant in a way he hadn’t been before. Their kisses were languid and careful now instead of desperate and forceful. Malfoy relinquished control gracefully, and welcomed Harry’s tongue into his own mouth and gasped against Harry’s lips. When Harry moved his attention to lavishing open-mouthed kisses against the other man’s throat, Malfoy gasped and arched his body against Harry’s.
It’s too late to stop, though Draco shouts into his gag, and tries to clench around the steadily thrusting vibrator. Eddie is standing in the doorway, two cups of tea in hand and staring directly at him.
He moves as quickly as he can, and it’s not hard really, to attach one end of a short rope to the ones binding Draco’s wrist together, to the one on Draco’s right ankle.
He cancels the spell and then falls on top of Draco’s chest bonelessly. He did manage to cum mostly on Draco’s face, but just as much ended up on Draco’s chest and is now smeared against Harry’s chest, but he doesn’t mind. Draco is warm beneath him and he can hear his heart racing against his ear. Inside him, Draco softens and they both moan as he slips from Harry’s arse.
“Something,” repeats Potter. “In my rooms. Tonight.” Draco narrows his eyes and Potter relents. “Fine, in my office. Tonight. Before dinner.”
Potter slides it down his cock, letting it just graze his sack which causes Draco to jump and scream into his gag. “Oops,” laughs Potter, not at all sorry. “Let’s see if you’re hungry enough yet. Ready?”
They left the store with two bags each and walked out into the street. Harry nodded at Malfoy as he turned in the opposite direction. “See you around, Malfoy.”
“There’s a difference between having a Death Eater bend over for you in the toilets and having one on your arm.”
“I didn’t have many options, remember,” added Malfoy quickly. “I had no money, and nowhere to go, and no one else wanted me. It was a good deal for someone like me.”
Harry turns and it’s a mistake because the second of inattention costs him. The squid catches him by the ankle and pulls him into the lake. His back scrapes unpleasantly against the rocks and sand and then the water starts to fill his mouth and nose as his whole body is submerged. He throws the bucket, hoping to cause a distraction and reaches for his wand.
He whines low in his throat in approval, hopes he can get that cock in his mouth before he cums, though he’s not sure when Harry intends to pull the beads from his arse. He’s never been able to hold back once they’re pulled out, but Percy’s in charge of when that happens, he knows. He’d heard them talking about it as Harry had pushed them in.
And Harry was left with the realization that he wasn’t just maybe attracted to his sort of friend Malfoy. No, he wanted Draco.
Percy sighs. “Ah, Reggie, he had a mouth viper, and just about the prettiest pink lips you’ve ever seen.”
“Yes,” he admits. He can’t deny it any longer, not even to himself. “But…” Draco’s not brave, he’s not a Gryffindor for a reason so he has to steel himself to admit his fears. “What about when other people find out? Your family? My family? The Prophet? They won’t be happy.”
“You know, for fun. Drinking. You and me. Hogsmeade.” Because they always stay in the castle, because they never really do anything but fuck. Which is great, but maybe there could be more?
There was a bell above the door now, Malfoy looked up when they walked through and Harry could tell from the look on his face that he hated the new addition. The scowl at the bell flitted to surprise and then something like glee before being forced back into boredom when Malfoy spoke.
“Can’t? Not that you don’t want to?” Draco doesn’t explain so Harry sighs. “Malfoy— Draco we’ve been having pretty filthy sex together since last May. What difference does it make if we add in some nights out as well?”
Draco shakes Potter from his person, but he’s curious despite the instincts that are telling him to run. “Show me what?”
The Room of Requirements had been Harry’s idea. Draco hadn’t been keen on it at first, but when he had complained about not knowing what he had looked like suspended, Harry knew it would be perfect.
“I’ve been waiting.” Harry could practically hear the pout, but did not look up. Instead he reached his fingertips under his glasses and pinched his eyes. His mind was decidedly fuzzy and he’d had far too much to drink to think rationally.
“He is no good,” said Lauren. She’d been a good host, introducing Harry to all the other English speakers and making sure he wasn’t getting bored.
“My beads,” says Draco. “I got on my knees, right here on this bed, bent over, and stuffed my hole full. We haven’t used those yet, but we should. They’re so good, Harry. They fill me up so nicely, I had to pop each one in slowly, let them stuff me full one by one by one.”
There didn’t seem to be much sense in pointing out that up until last night Harry hadn’t slept with anyone for months, but he didn’t think it would help matters. “Is that sewn on a pillow somewhere?” he asked instead.
Malfoy would never be the handsome sort, his face was too angular and his body was too sharp for that. But he’d grown his hair out so that it floated around his shoulders and his face, and he had gained a grace in his movements that had not been present when they were both boys. It helped to soften his still pinched expression. It also probably helped that he was clearly enjoying his conversation partner. Harry was sure he’d never seen Malfoy smile and laugh so openly back in England.
The room wasn’t a large one, and it had the same stone floor as the rest of the castle, but all four walls, the door, and the ceiling were all gigantic mirrors. The only blemish was where Percy himself hung, but perhaps when Harry grew more confident they could leave him behind.
He takes stock of his body. He feels pretty normal, no headache, no dry mouth, no ache in his stomach or muscles. He can move all of his fingers and toes, his cock is soft and resting against his thigh, nipples still hard, but they are rubbing against his sweater so that’s not completely— It’s now two fingers slipping in. That is definitely, absolutely a hand caressing his chest. The fingers make a little curving motion, just brushing the edge of his prostate as they sink in deep and he can’t contain the noise that escapes his lips.
Harry sighed when it was clearly Malfoy had no intention of continuing without some concession on his behalf. “Right, I’ll keep my mouth shut, but I really want to know. What did they give you when you left England?”
“I’m not cheating on my boyfriend, Malfoy.” It sounded like he was whining, Harry hated that. He fell onto a chair rather than the couch. He didn’t want Malfoy sitting next to him. Malfoy took the hint, but remained standing, his hands tucked tightly against his chest.
Draco swivels with ease before the class, back straight, turned to the side with one foot in front of the other and his right arm behind his back. He’s deadly gorgeous like this, long and lean, with his wand raised between them, grey eyes challenging.
He’s counting hippogriffs again, up to nine when his robes are pulled. Absently he slaps a hand behind him, hoping to hit Potter, but there’s nothing there.
Draco starts moving his hand faster and Harry can feel the skin on his cock getting tighter and tighter.
“I can’t explain it, Ron,” says Harry. And how could he? His dates vary so much in appearance and personality. How could he explain why one week he’s out with portly, middle-aged Guy Ferguson from the Ministry’s Human Resources, and why the next he’s on the arm of Salina Arellano, the latest up and coming pop sensation.
Draco straightens his shoulders and refuses to show any outward sign of discomfort even as his hole twitches, still adjusting after its recent pounding.
It’s impossible to tell through the gag, but Draco’s cursing at the man to press the damn button already.
“I only need the one labelled 1982,” she tells them. “Although you may as well collect ‘84 while you’re at it. If the Ministry wants Coarker’s O.W.L. results it’s only a matter of time before they request his N.E.W.T.S.”
Up and down he bounces, throwing his head back and closing his eyes to give the impression that Potter’s cock is all he needs. Let him look his fill and regret staying away for so long. Draco’s cock slaps wetly against his stomach, flopping obscenely as Draco fucks himself harder. When he sneaks a peek, Potter’s eyes are laser-focused there, watching as his cock flies about and his balls tighten in their sack.
“Excuse me, not all the students, only certain students, thank you. That Felix Rosier, I could write a novel on the pertness of his arse cheeks alone.”
The potion gurgles so he whips his head back around and judging by the big rolling bubbles he sees he’s at the halfway point. He picks up at sixteen hippogryphs just as Potter's hands run up his bare legs.
There are so many memories. They’ve known one another for so long. Grown up together in one another’s orbit. Draco’s foot smashing down on Potter’s face, Draco crying in the bathroom, Draco disarming Dumbledore, Draco running from the castle, Draco standing beside the Dark Lord, Draco clutching at Potter’s back as fire rages all around, Draco restrained in a courtroom, Draco crying at the verdict and shaking Potter’s hand.
Harry briefly closed his eyes shut as he wished for things to be different, and then went to join Malfoy on the couch. Malfoy fell into his arms easily, tucking his head beneath Harry’s chin, his pale hair tickling Harry’s lip. It wasn’t a comfortable position with Malfoy resting all of his weight on him so Harry dragged them down so that they were half-leaning half-lying against the side of the long couch.
“Oh very much,” he says. Then Draco pulls back and reaches out to push Harry’s glasses back into his hair. Ready to get down to it then.
“Fuck,” he told his reflection. He almost wished it were a magical one that might commiserate with him. Instead his perfectly normal reflection glared back at him. He sighed and rested his forehead against the cool glass. “You are such an idiot, Potter.”
“Existing on your pleasure alone? On servicing your every need?” Draco pauses to suck sharply at his collarbone. “I’ll be gagging for it, you can make me beg for a single glance.”
“Your cock was dirty too,” suggests Harry. He can see it in his head, Draco leaning against the tile, one hand pinching a small pink nipple while the other jerks his cock in that slow, intense way like he’s doing to Harry’s cock now.
Then all at once, the finger is pulled from his arse and the hand on his cock slides down to massage his balls.
It’s hard not to be utterly exasperated even though he knows Draco’s being purposefully forgetful. As if they hadn't been having an argument when they’d last seen each other this morning. And last night. And the night before that. “Drinks?” he says. “With Ron and Hermoine.”
“I am guessing that you thought you were well hidden and therefore hadn’t noticed that I saw you staring at me on the street before you even came in? Is that what that face means?”
He’d been in Paris for over six months now and though it had been a rough start, he had made some other friends. There was Kate, the American expat who brought her sixth month old daughter to the park in front of the Eiffel Tower and who sometimes joined Harry for lunch. There was Craig and Pierre, the long time couple he had met one night at a gay bar. He knew the names of all the waiters at his Albus’ favorite Thai restaurant, and there was the group of artists and hippies Harry went for coffee with after yoga class. He’d even struck up an unlikely friendship with Marie, a woman he’d met at Lauren’s party long ago, who he ran into one day in the supermarket and who liked to meet in coffee shops and traded French lessons for English ones.
Draco’s caught up and as he wrenches Harry’s arm back his papers go flying to the floor. Draco steps on top of his agenda and shoves him against the wall. “You do realise it’s my arse on the line if anything happens to that potion. I know you took it and I want it back— now.”
The cuffs are heavy, it’s awkward holding them, let alone wearing them. “Why would I need to do that?” Harry asks.
Malfoy arched a finely manicured eyebrow and gave Harry a look that was so familiar it made him feel grounded instantly. A world where Draco Malfoy was doing things like smiling and moaning was ridiculous. A world where Draco Malfoy was doing his best to express, ‘How much of an idiot are you really, Potter?’ made much more sense. Instead, Malfoy said, “Hello, Potter. What the hell are you doing here?”
Draco seems to be having a similar effect on himself, there’s the familiar shine of precum across his stomach and he's starting to make little thrusting motions with his hips which just end up wiggling his whole body.
“So you’ll come back?” asked Malfoy and damn him, he actually looked hopeful. Harry’s smile faded. Malfoy snorted and looked away. “Of course not.”
Whatever they’ve taken, they’ve obviously messed up the dosage as by the time Neville reaches the seventh year students they’re all firmly in the octogenarian range. Harry watches for a moment, wondering if Neville might need some help sorting them out when a hand grabs him by the arm and pulls him aside.
She smiled sadly and Harry was struck by how lovely she must have been as a girl and how world worn she looked now. “He prefers that I stay away. Just, tell him I love him.” Then as if she thought this an imposition she added, “If you would, Mr. Potter. I do so appreciate this.”
Harry watches as Draco riffles through his desk drawer and comes up with a pair of magic limiting cuffs.
Harry moans as that tongue delicately fondles him, and lets his cock go, lets it rest against the length of Draco’s face. It’s a good look on him, and his stubble scrapes just enough to tickle as Harry gives a small thrust.
The flat was emptier than ever after the children left. Harry broke down and adopted a cat. She was 6 years old, a bit on the round side, and had black fur that stuck to Harry’s clothes. She woke him up in the mornings by sitting on Harry’s pillow and smacking him in the face with her tail. Harry took this to mean ‘I demand you feed me this instant you lazy man.’ Harry named her Pickles.
“Harry Potter,” said Harry. Malfoy actually bit his lip to keep from saying anything. Harry understood the feeling, he was still fighting the initial burst of irritation he felt whenever he heard the other man's name.
And really it’s his name that does it, hearing it amongst all the filth. Draco hasn’t called him by his first time since the Armortenia incident and Harry loves it. He’s gasping and coming, angling his cock to spurt as close to Draco’s face as he can. His arse clenches rhythmically against Draco’s cock which sets Draco off and Harry just cums harder from the sudden feeling of Draco filling him up. They finish together and Harry’s happy to rest his knees, catch his breath, and let his pounding heart slow but then Draco snaps; “Vibrator!”
He bobs shallowly, and Harry can’t help thrusting a bit, letting his cock head pop in and out of that mouth, feeling the cool air and Draco’s breath on his wet skin whenever he pulls out. It’s near perfect, but Draco’s hands are roving again, massaging his balls, tickling just behind them, pressing on his taint, then back to his hips. It’s annoyingly distracting and when Draco tugs slightly at his pubic hair, Harry’s had enough.
Some of the tension ebbs from Draco’s tightly wound frame, his shoulder stops trying to climb into his ears and his wand points back to the ground. “So you do have it!”
It doesn’t appear that tonight is one of the nights where Draco will spend some time digging through the drawers of silk and lace. He’s apparently bought something new for Harry, it’s still wrapped in delicate paper and tied with a pink ribbon. Draco makes short work of the casing and pulls out several pieces of nude-colored lingerie overlaid with black lace.
Immediately Potter backs off. “You are such a slut for it, Malfoy,” he says, only slightly out of breath. “So desperate for my cock.”
Draco makes a little surprised noise as their lips press together and pushes Harry back. They don’t normally kiss. “Potion, Potter,” he says, but he’s amused, Harry can tell.
“Fuck it,” he says and pulls out his cock. Draco looks like he’s in absolute heaven and he wants in.
“Legilimency,” states Draco finally. It’s an absurd proposal, but now it’s been proposed Draco wants it. Desperately. A chance to see inside Harry Potter’s head. Either he’ll be proved right and Potter doesn’t really see him, isn’t really invested in the way he insists he is, or… well the alternative is maybe he can have this. Have Potter.
He left the two to discuss the merits of adding baby’s breath to the mixture in favor of searching out his far too quiet sons. He found them in the supply room, James having managed to entirely wrap his younger brother in bubble wrap. Harry helped cut Albus free and dragged them back into the main room to apologize to Malfoy for wasting his materials.
Harry smiles. He likes it when Draco’s prickly. Always angry and then melts like a kitten once Harry’s got his hands on him. “Okay, here’s a sentence. Would you like to go to have a drink in Hogsmeade with me?”
His social schedule was much the same, only now Harry also had a weekly pub quiz with his colleagues, and he was regularly invited out for a pint or a glass of wine in the Wizarding quarter on Friday nights.
“I know you’re a bit of an exhibitionist, Malfoy, but if you want to get your hands on my cock that badly I’m going to have to insist on a bit of privacy— ow.” The second hex lands on his nipple. Harry rubs it through his shirt and robes despite how that might look to the rows of students.
Harry laughs and lets his hair drip down into Draco’s face. “I think the squid wants the rest of his breakfast,” he says. Draco looks soft and furious, and very, very, damp. “Think you can wait?”
Unfortunately, Rosmerta has retired and the new proprietor Rogers has no sense of tradition. And to the horror of the adults of Hogwarts, he believes in non-alcoholic Hogsmeade Weekends for the Hogwarts students. He won’t be serving a drop until Monday evening as he does once a month. It makes chaperoning far less enjoyable and means that all the teachers have just moved to the Hogs Head instead for their evening drinks.
“I said, you’re busy.” Draco sighs in exaggeration and grabs Potter’s shoulder. “Potter,” he whines directly into his ear.
“You can do it,” Potter nods encouragingly. “I’ll think about how I feel about you, and you think about what you want to see. I won’t be able to hide. I’m pants at Occlumency, you know that.”
Fingers squeeze into his cheeks, massaging them. He can feel Potter’s hair tickling the skin there. Potter teases the tip of his tongue against his rim, circling and circling and circling until Draco can’t stand it anymore and pushes back against Potter’s face with a growl.
“Fuck off,” snaps Draco, his cock is painfully hard now and he can feel the desperation of his broken orgasm building up again as he wanks himself.
Draco would argue about being bundled up in Potter’s lap like a naked child, but everything is raw. His hands are unbound and the first thing he wants to do is wrap them around Potter's shoulders and pull him close.
Another arch of the eyebrow. It was always the one above Malfoy’s right eye. For some reason Harry wondered if Malfoy had such control over the one above his left.
Malfoy took the apology with a pinched look on his face, Lily sat beside him in Harry’s usual spot, looking like a child beauty queen, proudly holding her winning bouquet.
Harry did not apparently need to answer. Perhaps his response was clear from his expression. Hermione had always said that his face was an open book.
“He likes you,” this time she repeated the words in a singsong sort of voice that his daughter would use.
Simultaneously, Potter thrusts his fingers in hard and sucks down Draco’s cock straight into his throat. Draco practically screams at the onslaught. Potter doesn’t show him any mercy and he is a particularly brutal cocksucker. It’s one of the things Draco loves about having sex with his otherwise frustrating colleague. There’s no build-up, no strokes or kitten licks. The second his mouth is on him, Potter slides his lips from tip to root and back, taking Draco’s cock deep enough that his cock’s spongy head slips in and out of his throat.
Draco makes quick work of Potter’s trousers, opening them up, and spreading them wide so that he has space to pull Potter out of his boxers. It’s a bit strange as he’s stiff all over, stomach, thighs, balls. His cock is hard, in an artificial sort of way, like a dildo. Fitting though, as that’s what Draco intends to use him as.
And despite Harry behind vehemently against it, he finds himself learning the swirling flick motion of a centuries-old sex spell.
“Well spotted,” says Draco, already taking it from Harry’s hands to fasten it around his neck. His voice is still a little stilted, but his hands brush Harry’s hair out of the way with perfect gentleness, so that no curls get stuck in the clasp.
And it’s the strangest, most difficult walk of his life, walking through the Hog’s Head to the toilets as two fingers fuck in and out of his arsehole and another set of fingers pinch his nipple. He barely has the door closed before a third finger is added and he’s sliding to his knees.
“Besides the shop being there, I live around there too, and so do about a dozen other witches and wizards I know,” he looked away from the artist he’d been watching and gave Harry a mocking smile. “Turns out we’re not very original in our escape.”
Draco’s cock feels fantastic, pressed against his, leaving sticky little lines against his stomach as he ruts against him.
“Harry,” said Malfoy in a breathless voice and Harry inhaled sharply at the plea. Another first. Malfoy had never used his first name before.
“It was your portrait who had the idea, remember.” Harry crosses the rope and continues the pattern, ties the knot off, then takes a step back until Draco is looking at him. “Do you really not like it? We can stop, and we never have to do it again if you don’t.”
Draco leaves Neville to fend for himself, and takes his seat as inconspicuous as possible, so as to not interrupt McGonagall. They’ve reports coming up and it’s important information she’s giving. He hopes Harry has written down the dates correctly so he can copy them into his agenda.
It takes Draco a long time to answer. Harry knows he’s clever enough to have all the information he needs, but he’s doing the annoying Slytherin thing of weighing up how much information to give. As an Auror, Harry’s learned the best technique with these types is to wait them out.
However, Harry found out very quickly that for all of his grand plans, he was not very good at being on his own. He was used to having someone remind him to turn off the oven, or to know what kind of milk to buy at the market. Twice he’d run out of loo roll unexpectedly, and it had taken him an embarrassing number of attempts to remember how to cook his eggs how he liked. In defense of his failings he took to living like the bachelor he’d never had the chance to be. He wore his pants two days in a row and ate his cereal out of the chipped mug when all the bowls were dirty. He left rings on the glass coffee table and drank beer with breakfast when he ran out of juice. He killed his first houseplant and bought either far too much food, or far too little, for one person to eat.
He was at the Sunday market and a man was heaping tomatoes into a large bag, trying to bring the total up to five kilos. Harry waved his hands at him and tried to gesture using his fingers that he meant five tomatoes not five kilos, but the man didn’t seem to understand.
“That was expensive,” Draco’s protest is diminished by the fact that he’s currently speaking into the back of Harry’s neck where his nose is nestled into Harry’s hair.
Throughout the night Malfoy made several attempts at catching Harry’s attention, mostly through sidelong glances and plaintive stares. Harry ignored all of it, particularly the way Malfoy had looked at him during the countdown, one lip pressed between his teeth, eyes wide and somehow vulnerable and challenging at the same time. Harry escaped in the aftermath of celebrating the New Year without saying goodbye to any of his friends.
By all rights, the duel is Harry’s, all he needs to do is disarm Draco while his tongue is still too tied to verbalize his next spell, but then three nonverbals hit him in quick succession. He stumbles, loses his duelling stance, and before he can correct himself Draco’s back on his feet.
Worse still, he felt like he’d broken it off with two people. He hadn’t seen Malfoy much through fall and winter, but now it felt like he’d lost the other man all over again. This time when Malfoy caught sight of him from across the street he didn’t wave or acknowledge Harry in any way, he just kept walking.
Draco slams Harry’s diary closed with a slam, bending the lesson plans he’d been reviewing in between the pages of October. “You can leave,” he says.
The other man just grunts, his shoulders are tense and he’s bent hunched over his desk, scribbling away on a long parchment.
“Well, as much as I’d enjoy you worshipping attention on me, one of us needs to remain level headed enough to administer the antidote,” explains Draco who then pauses to suck another kiss into his neck. “Besides,” he says after popping off with an obnoxious sound. “I don’t think you’d enjoy the lack of control. I figured I’d take it.”
“Would you like to keep it, I mean,” asks Harry. He has to be careful to maintain eye contact, to not give Draco a chance to look away. It’s a bit like staring down a real dragon, which Harry knows from experience. You can’t show fear.
Pickles sauntered into the room in a way that drew their attention how only cat’s can, and draped her body down on Malfoy’s feet. He reached down and scratched between her ears and didn’t say a word about the fur sticking to his trouser legs.
Draco hisses at the contact because instead of a pat on the head Potter has reached one cupped palm between his legs. He pushes Potter back, but it’s a token shove at best and they both know it. He doesn’t even stumble back, just gives Draco’s cock a squeeze and starts walking him backwards into the nearest compartment without breaking contact.
Draco doesn’t seem to want to stop fucking around, but if that’s all they are going to do then should Harry even want to bother anymore?
When Harry first saw him he stared. Not because he was surprised, but because he was confused. He knew there was something about that pointed chin and the face it was on that should be familiar, but he couldn’t place why. It wasn’t until he heard the lilting voice that the pieces snapped together. Even in French, Draco Malfoy drawled like a bored aristocrat.
Harry chanced a look at Malfoy from the corner of his eye. The other man looked sullen, his arms were crossed across his chest and he was staring resolutely at the crumb-covered table. But he wasn’t raising any objections, and he wasn’t cursing either Harry or Lauren, so it must be all right. Resolved, Harry gave his best Saviour smile and said; “I’d love to, Lauren.”
Draco lets him drop in the sand and pats his back as he coughs up the rest of the water filling his lungs. When he’s sure he can breathe again he flops back onto the shore.
“Don’t mind me,” says Potter. He pulls Draco’s briefs down around his thighs and then his mouth is on his arse cheek giving him a playful bite. “You haven’t finished your Polyjuice yet, have you? Keep going.”
Harry looks around the dining room and considers the question more seriously than Marie had perhaps intended. They are in attendance at Barrister Fensterwald’s annual Midsummer’s party and there are in fact a number of men and women he’s met before in a professional capacity. Some he’s only escorted, some he’s slept with, the decision to do so has always been his own.
“Alright, alright,” said Harry, wiping tears from his eyes. “Sorry! But you know that wasn’t actually Moody, that was a Death Eater under a Polyjuice? So technically you were turned into a ferret by someone from your own side.”
“No!” Harry’s head snapped back to see the shopkeeper trying to thrust a bucket of cherries at a clearly irritated passerby.
They ordered, Harry a salad, and Malfoy a baguette, Harry a lemonade, and Malfoy another coffee. Then they sat in what Harry felt should be an awkward silence, but somehow wasn’t. Malfoy pulled out his newspaper, presumably to finish the last few pages he had left after their first coffee, the Métro, and the bus, while Harry took in the view. He couldn’t see the cityscape anymore, but the top of Montmartre was not lacking in interesting displays. What looked like dozens of artists had set up their easels and were either painting or drawing passer byers with thick charcoal pieces. Some people posed for caricatures, others looked over the artist’s other wares. A man on stilts was circulating through the crowd, and there was a clown leaning against a nearby food stall smoking a cigarette and chatting with a man with a professional looking camera slung around his neck.
Draco melts and presses into Harry’s arms, his lips. His hands come up to tentatively caress his hair, then more confidently, his fingers sinking into Harry’s curls. He throws a leg over Harry’s hip and presses their bodies together.
“Merlin fucking Morgana, Potter, fuck me!” snaps Draco the second he’s given the use of his voice again. His voice is strained as if he's been screaming and his eyes are wide and frantic.
It’s not strictly a playroom in the traditional sense. Harry’s seen what some witches and wizards call their playroom. They are usually decked out with leather and chains. An entire room dedicated to a particular kink can be quite lavish. Of course, Harry’s also seen entire fetishes banned to sock drawers and secret compartments. But of all the playrooms Harry has seen, Draco’s is his favorite.
Draco licks into the shell of his ear, and that combined with the way he’s flicking his palm over the sensitive head of Harry’s cock is a wicked combination. Harry groans and feels his abdomen clench.
Harry presses his thumb to Draco’s slack mouth and strokes his bottom lip. He has such a lovely mouth, wide with full lips. Draco stares at him for a moment before hesitantly flicking a tongue against the invading thumb.
“Do me,” begs Draco. “I want to go first.” He’s thrusting his hard cock at Harry rather vigorously. His arms are still bound tightly behind his back so he can’t exactly spell himself.
Harry actually stopped walking at that then had to run to catch up to Malfoy who had kept going on without him. “You can’t just say things like that to people!”
Since the shuttered doors that made up the front wall of the café were open it hardly felt as if he was indoor at all. But the thick supports and the other patrons blocked him enough that Harry felt confident in his subterfuge. He ordered an espresso to give himself something to do with his hands and watched.
Draco smirks and exchanges a glance with Francis who is standing with the rest of the Slytherins in a supportive sort of gaggle beside him. “Bow and begin, Professor Potter.”
It was the man from the first night Harry had seen Malfoy again, he was sure of it. And Malfoy was practically hanging off of him. It was disgusting. Not, Harry quickly told himself, because he minded or anything. It was mostly so terrible because he knew what a proud person Malfoy was, and to see him so debased was just wrong somehow.
Predictable, Draco groans, but Harry has him laughing again with an exuberant spin. He lets him go round a few times, but not enough to make him too dizzy, and stops him so he’s got his back this time. Draco hangs his head and stares at the floor, which he complained about earlier because there was less to look at down there.
He gasps into the table and he’s sure there’s drool there now, his face is sticky and messier than it was before. He can feel the euphoria spread through his whole body, radiating out from his pulsing cock to his arsehole, down his legs and up his arms.
It’s not perfect. Harry’s still soaked and now covered in dirt and sand, with pebbles digging into his back. But he has his arms full of a frankly hot man who’s finally admitted to liking him and he can feel another cock hardening against his own even through the layers of wet clothing. Draco whimpers and makes those pathetic little noises that always shoot straight to Harry’s cock. It’s Draco who grows desperate first, panting against Harry’s lips as he thrusts his hips.
And there’s a thought. These rooms have been used by both Snape and Slughorn. Harry can’t help tensing up, what about the bed…
A resulting argument between Malfoy and the attendant ensued, which resulted in Malfoy shouting something that had to be an insult and Harry holding a bag containing five large tomatoes.
“Fifth year spells only, Mr Bellamy,” he sighs, sorting Frankie out with a wave of his wand. “Nonverbal spells are in the sixth year curriculum.”
Thankfully Potter is pressing dirty open-mouthed kisses against his arsehole and gently stroking his cock, neither of which are as distracting as being tongue fucked.
Very briefly Harry considered arguing over the tab, but decided it wasn’t worth it and instead followed Malfoy through the city, down the stairs to the Métro and onto the crowded train. A few quid was definitely worth having someone else navigate the tricky underground system that Harry hadn’t had the heart to brave quite yet.
It turned out that the reason they couldn’t just speak at the café in the city was that the view was spectacular. Malfoy allowed Harry to stare out at the expanse of the city for a full two minutes before he became restless and steered them both back towards the bustle of the hilltop village. Harry was led to yet another café and pushed into one of the increasingly familiar too-tiny metal seats before Malfoy spoke again.
That’s true. Draco’s shown Harry all of his toys. The vibrators, the cuffs, the plugs, the dildos, the beads, there’d been so many Harry’s head had spun thinking about all the nasty little ways Draco might have used them to get himself off. By the time Draco had shown him the perverted portrait he kept in the closet, he’d been too excited to try some new things out that he’d promptly forgotten all about Percy.
It was the loneliness that eventually got to him. It was the drowning silences, the loss of the general buzz of a busy household inhabited by three children and a wife with a large extended family who all had round-the-clock access to the floo. Most days he kept the telly on for company, even though he didn’t understand what the adverts were trying to sell him on. Some days he considered buying a cat so he’d have something to talk to. The dead fern on the balcony was not much for conversation.
“Shit.” Draco twitches and nearly drops the retrieving tweezers. Potter’s prickly chin is scratching against him and his tongue is pushing inside, fucking him in a slow, gentle motion. The muscle is wet and strong, spreading Draco open just so. Potter sets a languid pace, as if he has all the time in the world to eat him out, he’s humming pleased little noises between Draco’s cheeks. It’s impossible not to feel relaxed again, to press back and drop onto his elbows.
And then as Ron and Hermoine start arguing over who does the dishes more Harry feels the definite feeling of a hand nudging aside his balls massaging against his hole and a finger pushes inside him.
It couldn’t be more ideal actually. Potter managed to push himself back from the desk, leaving just enough room for Draco. His arms are hanging off the armrests, and his feet are planted on the floor, hips angled up, but body leaning back. Behind his glasses, Potter’s bright eyes are furious.
“Loud, boorish, always on the lash, hopelessly heterosexual, lads.” Draco settles the argument with a forkful of mash.
Draco is uncharacteristically silent, letting Harry touch to his heart’s content, without a single whimper, or complaint.
That Saturday, while Malfoy was in Giverny, Harry went to a gay bar Malfoy had once talked about. He gave the name to a cab driver and paid the cover fee at the door. He’d worn his tightest jeans and what he hoped was his most flattering button down.
The potion Draco has him to use on his hair leaves it soft and wavy, a texture Harry’s never been able to duplicate outside Draco’s posh flat. Later Draco will style the usually unruly locks, but for now he simply brushes the water  out of the strands and sets the brush away again.
Has he had too much to drink already? Was some kind of sensitizing potion slipped into his drink? He’s usually pretty careful in public— he does have a few stalkers after all, but he’s generally safe in Hogsmeade particularly when suspicious Aberforth is pulling all of his pints.
He’s had enough time to learn the basics now though, even if he doesn’t move as smoothly as Draco and even if his chest sticks out a little more than the other man’s.
Harry felt his eyes watering up and hugged Lily to his chest, touched by his children’s easy acceptance.
“Merlin, calm down,” says Harry. “Yes, I do think we could have a relationship. In fact, I hate to break it to you, but we already have one.”
He shoots a diffinido at the tentacle grasping his ankle and kicks back to the surface, desperate for a breath.
“I cheated on Ginny,” admitted Harry. “A lot. With a lot of different men. I hated myself for it, and I deserve every hurtful thing she ever said to me. I broke up my family and lost more friendships than I can count, I never wanted to be that person again.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes and reached for his coffee as if just remembering its presence. He took a sip and made a face; it must have gone cold. “One out of three is not good when the wager is your life.” There was a pause enough for Draco to order them both another espresso (Harry was starting to wonder just how much coffee one could have in one day) then, “So who turned me into a ferret?”
Draco groans and flops down into the sand beside him. “I don’t know how I feel about that,” he says eventually. “I like spending time with you here, alone. I don’t think I’m ready for dinner.”
The truth in those words hurt, but Harry forced himself to look away again. “But not really. Not truly single.”
“Everywhere does croque madame,” complained Harry. He was still feeling a bit embarrassed but he took his seat at the outdoor table, the same as Malfoy. It was one of the few things he knew about French cuisine. A croque monsieur was basically a cheese toastie with the cheese on the outside instead of on the inside, and a croque madame came with an egg on top. Harry had been in Paris for two months now and was still trying to figure out why either had any business costing over a fiver.
“I don’t want you to see him anymore,” said Malfoy after Harry stood to pour them both a second cuppa.
“I know you took it.” Draco’s not even pretending to settle into the meal, balanced on the edge of his seat as he is.
It’s impossible not to get carried away with the emotions, to feel Potter’s lust and to get turned on by his own wanton image. Draco’s face covered in cum, Draco’s lips wrapped around Potter’s cock, Draco’s hole gaping open, Draco bent over his desk, his workbench, the Quidditch stands, the table in the staff room and on his knees in just as many locations. Potter’s right. They’ve not done it in the toilets yet after all, so that’s something they can remedy.
He can’t even say the words, but Potter must take his pained whimpers for agreement. So, so gently, he presses his lips against Draco’s. Then he does exactly as he’d said. He sits in his chair and watches.
Which just reminds Harry that he’s still wound up and Draco’s already had his. Without Harry. With a portrait.
Potter’s dropped his glasses back on his face, and he’s stopped stroking his fingers against Draco’s prostate, thank Merlin, but he’s still absently playing with his hole, gently thrusting his fingers in and out with a fascinated look on his face as he watches. “You really are a filthy slut aren’t you, Malfoy?” he says. Draco would argue, but the current evidence is not in his favour.
James hummed in a distracted way that Harry took to mean ‘me too, but my comic is more interesting than your love life, thanks dad.’
A long whistle breaks the rather uncomfortable silence. Draco clenches his cheeks and sucks in a deep breath in preparation.
And ridiculous Potter, with his ridiculous glasses, and ridiculous hair sitting in the middle of his pile of pillows just looks so damned earnest that Draco finds himself hoping for the first time in a long time.
“Right,” Harry tells them, clapping his hand once to get their attention. “Last demonstration before we go. Footwork. I’m noticing a lot of shoddy stances out there. Remember that a strong shield takes a great deal of your energy to maintain. What we want is to conserve our energy and strike out as efficiently as possible. If you make a smaller target, you make it harder for your opponent to aim. Professor Malfoy if you’d demonstrate for us?”
“We agreed on Christmas for giving things a proper— public go,” argues Harry. “No reason you can’t come to meet my friends just as a, you know, friend.”
“It’s a good thing, you absolute arse. I think. I was going to say I’ve been thinking it’s time I showed you something.”
“And the thing is, the thing that most people forget, or maybe don’t know,” continues Harry unhurriedly. “Is that, it was my blood he was resurrected with.” He stares hard at the lines he’s smeared across the wood and waits for Draco to catch on. He’s a clever man, it won’t take him long.
The other hand is, Harry, notices, busy in Draco’s trousers, though there’s no way it’s easy to wank yourself within such tight confines. Draco doesn’t seem to mind, palming himself beneath the fabric as he moans around Harry’s cock, moving faster and faster, sucking just slightly harder, but enough to make Harry’s knobbly knees tremble.
“Fuck yes, keep moaning,” commands Harry as he rocks into Draco’s mouth. He’s stopped thrusting and is instead pulling on Draco’s shoulders to let the ropes rock him forwards and back, using the momentum to fuck closer and closer to the back of his throat.
Harry pulls out as Draco coughs. Most of Harry’s cum has gone straight down his throat, but as he wheezes some of it comes back up and drips from his gaping mouth. It takes several deep breaths for Draco to feel in control again and then another card snaps on his upper back.
Draco loves it, loves his cock bouncing with every thrust, his hole aching as it struggles to keep up with the continuous stretching, the friction near burning, but so wet and so good. He drops his wand and tries to get a hand under his robes, but they’re too long in the front and Potter’s got a death grip on his hips. Draco settles for grabbing his cock through the thick fabric and hisses at the rough material rubbing against his cock.
